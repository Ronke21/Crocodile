<text>The B61 nuclear bomb is the primary thermonuclear gravity bomb in the United States Enduring Stockpile following the end of the Cold War. It is a low-to-intermediate yield strategic and tactical nuclear weapon featuring a two-stage radiation implosion design.

The B61 is of the variable yield (&quot;dial-a-yield&quot; in informal military jargon) design with a yield of 0.3 to 340 kilotons in its various mods (&quot;modifications&quot;). It is a Full Fuzing Option (FUFO) weapon, meaning it is equipped with the full range of fuzing and delivery options, including air and ground burst fuzing, and free-fall, retarded free-fall and laydown delivery. It has a streamlined casing capable of withstanding supersonic flight and is long, with a diameter of about . The basic weight of the B-61 is about , although the weights of individual weapons may vary depending on version and fuze/retardation configuration. As of 2020, the weapon was undergoing a 12th modification. According to the Federation of American Scientists in 2012, the roughly 400 B61-12s will each cost &quot;more than its weight in gold&quot; - $28 million apiece.

==Development==

In 1961 a report was issued indicating Navy and Air Force interest in a lightweight bomb to replace existing weapons, but that both services had considerably different military requirements for such a weapon. However, the authors of the report believed that due to advances in technology it was possible for a single weapon to fulfill both requirements. This was followed by a report from Sandia in mid-1962, that believed that a lightweight nuclear bomb with full fuzing option was possible and that such a program could be completed in a short time-span, possibly by 1965 or 1966.

Development of the weapon that would become the B61 was authorized in December 1962. The justification for the program was that the new weapon would modernize the nuclear arsenal, improve the capability of aircraft and simplify the nuclear weapons inventory by replacing lower-yield versions of the B28 and B43 nuclear bombs. The desired production date was June 1965.

The weapon was designated the TX-61 in January 1963. Due to the short time-scales, it was decided to make maximum use of off-the-shelf components such as those developed for the B57 nuclear bomb. Environmental conditions specified included an indefinite temperature range of to , shocks of up to 40g, and in flight temperatures of up to for up to 40 minutes. Parachute deployment was specified to produce a maximum load of .

The weapon was designed and built by the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Production engineering began in 1965, with the first war-reserve B61-0 weapon accepted by the AEC in December 1966. However production was halted in May 1967 for design modifications to be made before resuming in January 1968. Shot Flintlock Halfbeak in June 1966 may have been a full yield test of the weapon with other tests conducted between 1963 and 1968 at the Nevada Test Site.

During testing, spin motors were added to the weapon to produce a spin of 5 revolutions per second. This was to improve stability and decoupling during high speed delivery. Three alternatives to the weapon were also explored for still-classified reasons. The first alternative was halted due to its similarity to the original TX-61 design, and the Department of Defense was unfavorable to the second option which halted its exploration. The TX-61 design was ordered to &quot;proceed along the lines&quot; of the third alternative in May 1964, though it is unclear what that means.

Total production of all versions was approximately 3,155, of which approximately 540 remain in active service, 415 in inactive service and 520 are awaiting dismantlement .

13 versions of the B61 have been designed, known as Mod 0 through Mod 12. Of these, nine have entered production. Each shares the same physics package, with different yield options. The newest variant is the Mod 11, deployed in 1997, which is a ground-penetrating bunker busting weapon. The Russian Continuity of Government facility at Kosvinsky Kamen, finished in early 1996, was designed to resist US earth-penetrating warheads and serves a similar role as the American Cheyenne Mountain Complex. The timing of the Kosvinsky completion date is regarded as one explanation for U.S. interest in a new nuclear bunker buster and the declaration of the deployment of the Mod 11 in 1997: Kosvinsky is protected by about of granite.

The B61 unguided bomb should not be confused with the MGM-1 Matador cruise missile, which was originally developed under the bomber designation B-61.

==Deployment==
The B61 has been deployed by a variety of US military aircraft. US aircraft cleared for its use have included the B-1 Lancer, B-2 Spirit, B-52 Stratofortress, F/A-18 Hornet, A-6 Intruder, A-4 Skyhawk, F-111, F-15E Strike Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon and the F-35A. As part of NATO Nuclear Weapons Sharing, German and Italian Panavia Tornado aircraft can also carry B61s. The B61 can fit inside the F-22 Raptor&#x27;s weapons bays.

B61 tactical variants are deployed with NATO allies in Europe as part of the NATO Nuclear Weapons Sharing Program. About 150 bombs are stored at six bases: Kleine Brogel in Belgium, Büchel Air Base in Germany, Aviano and Ghedi Air Base in Italy, Volkel Air Base in the Netherlands and Incirlik in Turkey. In 2012, NATO agreed to improve the capabilities of this force with the increased accuracy of the Mod 12 upgrade and the delivery of the F-35 aircraft. This added a modest standoff capability to the B61. The F-35A was certified to carry the B61-12 in October 2023, marking the first time a fifth generation fighter has been nuclear capable, and the first new platform in the NATO inventory to achieve such status since the early 1990s.

==Design==
The B61 is a variable yield (&quot;dial-a-yield&quot; colloquially) dual use tactical and strategic bomb equipped with Full Fuzing Option (FUFO) designed for external carriage by high-speed aircraft. It has a streamlined casing capable of withstanding supersonic flight. The original B61-0 weapon was long, with a diameter of and a basic weight of with most later weapons having approximately the same dimensions and weight, except for the Mod 11 version which has a weight of approximately .

===Ground operations===

The B61 is armed by ground-based personnel via an access panel located on the side of the bomb, which opens to reveal nine dials, two sockets, and a T-handle which manually triggers the &quot;command disable&quot; function. One of the sockets is for a MC4142 &quot;strike enable&quot; plug which must be inserted in order to complete critical circuits in the safety/arming and firing mechanisms. The other socket is the PAL connector, which has 23 pins marked with alphabetic letter codes.

The B61 &quot;command disable&quot; mechanism functions as follows: after entering the correct three-digit numeric code it is then possible to turn a dial to &quot;DI&quot; and pull back a T-shaped handle which comes away in the user&#x27;s hand. This action releases a spring-loaded firing pin which fires the percussion cap on an MC4246A thermal battery, powering it up. Electrical power from the thermal battery is sufficient to &quot;fry&quot; the internal circuitry of the bomb, destroying critical mechanisms without causing detonation. This makes the bomb incapable of being used. Any B61 which has had the command disable facility activated must be returned to Pantex for repair.

===Fuzing and delivery===

The B61 can be set for airburst or groundburst detonation, and by free fall, retarded free fall or laydown delivery through the use of a parachute to slow down the weapon during release from the delivery aircraft. Only the Mod 0 to 10 versions of the B61 are equipped with a parachute retarder (currently a 24-ft (7.3 m) diameter nylon/Kevlar chute). This offers the aircraft a chance to escape the blast in its retarded delivery modes, or allows the weapon to survive impact with the ground in laydown delivery mode. Contact preclusion can also be selected by the pilot. The weapon can be released at speeds up to Mach 2 and altitudes as low as . In one of the weapon&#x27;s laydown modes, it detonates 31 seconds after weapon release. 

The Mod 11 is a hardened penetration bomb with a reinforced casing and a delayed-action fuze; this allows the weapon to penetrate several metres into the ground before detonating, damaging fortified structures further underground. Developed from 1994, the Mod 11 went into service in 1997 replacing the older megaton-yield B53 bomb. About 50 Mod 11 bombs have been produced, their warheads converted from Mod 7 bombs. At present, the primary carrier for the Mod 11 is the B-2 Spirit.

===Mods===

As of 2023, the B61 has 13 variants, referred to as Mod 0 through Mod 12.

===B61 Mod 3 and 4===

A Sandia document on the dates of the development phases of the US nuclear stockpile describes the B61-3 as an &quot;improved Mod 2 w/IHE&quot; and the B61-4 as &quot;same as Mod 3 ex. Hi-Y&quot;.

The B61 Mod 3 and 4 bombs do not contain beryllium.

===B61 Mod 5===
A 1978 report on reducing or substituting beryllium in nuclear weapons noted that the B61-5 contained beryllium and that if the use of beryllium were to be restricted, the B61-5 could probably be replaced by the B61 Mod 3.

===B61 Mod 6 and 8===
The B61 Mod 6 and Mod 8 bombs were developed for use by the US Navy beginning in March 1987 and cancelled at the end of the Cold War. The weapons weighed , had a length of and a diameter of , and were one-point safe, used insensitive high explosives (IHE) in their primary stages and utilized enhanced electrical safety (EES). 

The weapons were to be built by converting existing B61-0, −2 and −5 weapons into Mod 6 and 8 weapons and the weapons were to use B61-7 weapon parts where possible. By mass, the largest deviations from the B61-7 were the Acorn assembly, MC4137 TSSG (trajectory sensing signal generator) and the JTA (described as &quot;ballast for WR&quot;).

====Electrical systems====
The weapon&#x27;s computer was the MC4139 Programmer, two of which are used on independent channels, and is identical to the programmer used on the B61-7. The MC3656 Main Battery is identical to the battery used on the B61-7 and is thermally operated, providing 120 seconds of power for the weapon, but initial power is supplied by the MC2238 Pulse Batteries which are activated by the weapon&#x27;s pullout switches during separation from the aircraft.

The weapon contained two neutron generators for initiation, using a 2400 volt 0.6 μF capacitor for neutron generator firing and a 3300 volt 2.0 μF capacitor for the firing set. If neither the radar fuze or the contact crystals actuated, the weapon would detonate at 120 seconds from arming.

The weapons were to initially use the MC4175 Trajectory Sensing Signal Generators which are identical to the TSSG found in the B61-7, but starting from 1991, the Mod 6 was to get a new MC4137 Trajectory Sensing Signal Generator. The MC4175 stored the arming signal for the trajectory stronglink in its memory, so it featured a pair of rolamite acceleration switches designed to prevent the possibility of the signal being transferred to the stronglink before the rolamites were actuated by the spinning of the weapon in flight. The MC4137 instead is provided the unique signal from the MC4139 Programmer, which stores it in a volatile memory that erases after approximately seven seconds of lost power, meaning that without intent from the MC4139 and continuously applied power the MC4137 does not know how to arm the safelink.

====Stronglink switches and weaklinks====

The weapon was to feature a number of weapon stronglinks. Stronglinks are part of the weapon&#x27;s safety systems and are designed to be robust enough that they can survive abnormal environments long enough for the weapon&#x27;s weaklinks to fail. This requires weak and stronglinks to be colocated so they are exposed to the same environmental conditions in an accident.

The first stronglink was the MC2969 Intent Stronglink Switch which was also used on the B61-3, −4 and −7, W78, W80 and B83 weapons. The MC2969 consisted of a 14-pin ceramic-insulated bank of switches that would close upon the receipt of the proper intent unique signal (IUQS) to its electromechanical decoder. Receipt of the wrong signal would lock the MC2969 in the open position until a specific unlock signal was received.

The second stronglink was the MC2935 Trajectory Stronglink Switch of which there were two, one for each channel of the weapon&#x27;s firing set. Like the MC2969, it mechanically locked if it received the wrong input signals, but unlike the MC2969 it could only be manually unlocked, which could only take place at the factory. Signals for the MC2935 come from either of the two MC4175s or the MC4137 Trajectory Sensing Signal Generators.

A third stronglink existed inside the first exclusion region of the weapon and was involved in weapon arming. Details of the system are still classified.

===B61 Mod 12===
As of 2013 the Pentagon saw the B83 nuclear bomb as a &quot;relic of the Cold War,&quot; believing that deploying a megaton-yield gravity bomb, the highest level nuclear weapon left in the U.S. inventory, to Europe was &quot;inconceivable&quot; at this point. It can also only be carried by the B-2 bomber, and integrating it onto additional aircraft would be costly. The Mod 12 upgrade is being pursued as a forward-deployed tactical/strategic nuclear weapon to protect NATO and Asian allies since it can be used from dual-capable fighter aircraft, as well as planned to arm the F-35 and B-21 Raider, and its lower yield options make it more flexible with less collateral effects. Recapitalizing the B61 is hoped to lead to the retirement of the B83, resulting in the elimination of the last megaton-yield U.S. bomb and leave the B61-series as the only U.S. gravity nuclear bomb.

In 2013, the Pentagon and NNSA stated that if B61 refurbishment did not begin by 2019, components in the existing weapons could begin to fail. In 2013 Tom Collina of the Arms Control Association said that the new development could complicate arms control efforts with Russia.

In 2014, Congress slashed funding for the project and called for alternates to be studied.
In January 2014, former Air Force Chief of Staff Norton A. Schwartz stated that the Mod 12 nuclear bomb upgrade would have enhanced accuracy and a lower yield with less fallout compared to previous versions of the weapon. Accuracy has not been a guarantee for air-dropped nuclear weapons, so consequently large warheads were needed to effectively impact a target; the Mod 11 nuclear earth-penetrator is accurate to 110–170 meters from the desired detonation location, so it requires a 400-kiloton warhead. The Mod 12 is accurate to 30 meters from a target and only requires a 50-kiloton warhead. Schwartz believes that greater accuracy would both improve the weapon and create a different target set it can be useful against. An example is the higher-yield Mod 11&#x27;s role of attacking underground bunkers that need a ground burst to create a crater and destroy it through the shockwave. A 50-kiloton yield detonating on the ground produces a crater with a radius of 30–68 meters, depending on the density of the surface, effectively putting the bunker within the circular error probability.

In 2014 critics said that a more accurate and less destructive nuclear weapon would make leaders less cautious about deploying it, while Schwartz said it would deter adversaries more because the U.S. would be more willing to use it in situations where necessary. The improved accuracy would make it more effective than the previous Mod 3/4 currently deployed to the continent. F-16 and Panavia Tornado aircraft cannot interface with the new bomb due to electronic differences, but NATO countries buying the F-35 would be able to utilize it. The first flight test for an inert Mod 12 was conducted in 2015, with a second successful test in August 2017.

Despite claims the Mod 12 has an earth penetrating capability, the weapon does not have the reinforced structure like that of the Mod 11, which is required to function as an earth penetrating weapon. The Mod 11 will be retained in service for the ground penetrating mission.

The Mod 12 Life Extension Program continued in 2018 and on 29 June 2018 two successful non-nuclear system qualification flight tests at Tonopah Test Range were reported. In October 2018, the Mod 12 guided tail-kit assembly received Milestone C approval to enter the production phase; the TKA went through the traditional test program in under 11 months, achieving a 100% success rate for all 31 bomb drops. The B61-12 nuclear bomb completed its successful flight tests with the US Air Force&#x27;s F-15E in June 2020. It was dropped from above 25,000ft and was in the air for approximately 55 seconds before hitting the target.

The first B61-12 bomb was produced in November 2021. The weapon replaces the B61 mod 3, mod 4 and mod 7 bombs while the B61-11 will be retained in the stockpile. It is expected that the LEP will extend the B61&#x27;s life by at least 20 years. In October 2022, that the US military planned to accelerate the deployment of the Mod 12 in Europe. This drew criticism from the Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexander Grushko, who accused the US government of &quot;reducing the nuclear threshold&quot; with the weapon&#x27;s increased accuracy.

The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is not listed as a future platform.

===B61 Mod 13===
Initially, the NNSA Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan anticipated Phase 1 development for the B61 Mod 13 Life Extension Program (LEP) beginning in 2037 with first production of the weapon in 2050, but in 2023 plans were announced to produce a new gravity bomb similar to that of the B61-12, but having a high yield similar to that of the B61-7, named the B61 Mod 13. This discards plans for the Mod 13 to be a future Mod 12 LEP. It is planned that for each B61-13 produced, one fewer B61-12 is to be produced, therefore not increasing the planned number of new B61 bombs; defense officials indicated only &quot;a few dozen&quot; B61-13s may be produced. The new bomb will be carried by the B-21 Raider, but it is not planned to be deployed on the F-35.

The Federation of American Scientists have accused the weapon of being a &quot;political bomb&quot;, introduced to finally retire the B83-1 nuclear bomb, whose retirement has been blocked by hardliners.

===W61 Earth Penetrator Warhead===
A W61 Earth Penetrator Warhead (EPW) with a yield of was developed for the AGM-129 Advanced Cruise Missile and the MGM-134 Midgetman small ICBM. The weapon entered Phase 1 initial development in January 1985 and phase 4 production engineering in September 1992 before being cancelled in December of that year.

In the Advanced Cruise Missile role, the weapon was to replace aging B53 bombs, but after the W61 cancellation the role was filled by the B61-11 bomb.

===Pits===

A declassified technical report on the automation of pit handling at Pantex indicates that the B61-2 and B61-5 share a common pit design, as do the B61-3, B61-10 and W85. The B61-0 and B61-4 do not share a pit with any other weapon. As the B61-7 was a retrofit of the B61-1 and the B61-11 was a retrofit of the B61-7, they presumably share a common pit.

==Cost==
In May 2010 the National Nuclear Security Administration asked Congress for $40 million to redesign the bomb to enable the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II to carry the weapon internally by 2017. This version is designated Mod 12. The four hundred Mod 12 bombs will be used by both tactical aircraft (such as the F-35) and strategic aircraft (such as the B-2) and the Tail Subassembly (TSA) will give them Joint Direct Attack Munition levels of accuracy, allowing the fifty kiloton warhead to have strategic effects from all carrying aircraft. However, refitting the 400 weapons is now expected to cost over $10 billion. The Mod 12 tail assembly contract was awarded to Boeing on November 27, 2012 for $178 million. Boeing will use their experience with the Joint Direct Attack Munition to yield JDAM-equivalent accuracy in a nuclear bomb. This contract is only the first part of the billion-dollar expense of producing and applying the tail kits, over and above the $10 billion cost to refurbish the warheads. The Mod 12 uses an internal guidance system and can glide to its target. On 1 July 2015, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) conducted the first of three flight tests of the Mod 12 tail kit assembly.

According to the Federation of American Scientists in 2012, the roughly 400 B61-12s will cost $28 million each.

<doc id="1045788" wikidata="Q690063" url="?curid=1045788" title="Arn Anderson">
<text>Martin Anthony Lunde (born September 20, 1958), better known by his ring name Arn Anderson, is an American professional wrestling road agent, author, and retired professional wrestler. Although he is widely regarded as one of the greatest tag team wrestlers in history, he also had a successful singles career and became a four-time NWA/WCW World Television Champion, which he often called his &quot;world title&quot;.

Anderson&#x27;s career was highlighted by his alliances with Ric Flair and various members of the wrestling stable The Four Horsemen in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). After his retirement, he worked as a producer for WWE until 2019, when he joined All Elite Wrestling (AEW). On March 31, 2012, Anderson was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a member of the Four Horsemen. His son, Brock Anderson also pursued a career in professional wrestling.

== Early life ==
Martin Anthony Lunde was born in Rome, Georgia, on September 20, 1958.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1981–1984) ===
Lunde began his career on December 16, 1981, in Georgia Championship Wrestling going by the ring name Jim Vertaroso, having been trained by Ted Lipscomb (Allen). He spent much of the year wrestling in various independent wrestling companies across the United States, including a minor run in Mid South Wrestling for Bill Watts from 1982 to 1983. By the middle of 1983, he made his way to Southeastern Championship Wrestling, an NWA affiliated promotion operating out of Tennessee and Alabama. Taking the name of &quot;Super Olympia&quot;, Lunde soon became a member of Ron Fuller&#x27;s Stud Stable before the year was out. Lunde saw success in the tag team ranks by winning the NWA Southeastern Tag Team Championship three times with Mr. Olympia and once with Pat Rose throughout 1984. It was also here in this promotion that Lunde met and began what would become a lifelong friendship with Ric Flair. By the end of the year, however, Lunde left the company and joined Mid South Wrestling based out of Shreveport. Lunde&#x27;s time in Mid South was coming to an end, and during a TV taping the Junkyard Dog mentioned to Bill Watts, the owner of Mid South Wrestling, that Lunde looked like an Anderson. Watts called Jim Crockett and convinced him to book Lunde.

=== Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1984–1988) ===
==== Minnesota Wrecking Crew (1984–1985) ====

Lunde made his way to Jim Crockett, Jr.&#x27;s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, based in the Virginias and the Carolinas. By this time, the company extended its range into Georgia after rival promoter Vince McMahon purchased Georgia Championship Wrestling. There was a strong physical resemblance between Lunde and Ole Anderson, who had achieved legendary status in the Georgia and Mid-Atlantic territories as a tag team wrestler. Ole noticed that Lunde&#x27;s style was a no nonsense approach in the ring and specialized in working over a part of an opponent&#x27;s body throughout the match, much like Ole himself. Anderson agreed to work with Lunde, helping to hone his capabilities, and re-formed the Minnesota Wrecking Crew with Lunde replacing Gene Anderson and taking on the name of &quot;Arn Anderson&quot;, Ole&#x27;s kayfabe brother. The team quickly became a force in the territory by capturing the NWA National Tag Team Championship in March 1985. Arn and Ole defended the titles throughout the year, with their highest profile match being part of the card for Starrcade 1985 on Thanksgiving night. The Crew successfully defended the titles against Wahoo McDaniel and Billy Jack Haynes.

==== The Four Horsemen (1985–1988) ====


In the latter half of 1985, the Andersons formed a loose knit alliance with fellow heels Tully Blanchard and Ric Flair, as they began to have common enemies. The foursome frequently teamed together in six-man, and sometimes, eight-man tag matches or interfered in each other&#x27;s matches to help score a victory or, at least, to prevent each other from losing their titles. The alliance quickly became a force within the territory, working in feuds against some of the biggest stars in the company like Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T. A., the Road Warriors and the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express. Anderson also saw success as a singles wrestler on January 4, 1986, by winning the vacant NWA Television Championship. Simultaneously, Anderson was still one half of the NWA National Tag Team Champions and, even though Crockett promotions abandoned the National Tag titles in March, Anderson&#x27;s success as a dual champion elevated his status within the territory. It was also during this time (in 1986) that the Andersons, Blanchard, and Flair began calling themselves The Four Horsemen with J. J. Dillon serving as the group&#x27;s manager. Anderson also had a tremendous ability to do interviews to further the storylines he participated in. His ability to improvise in interviews allowed him to coin the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot; moniker for the stable, as he likened their coming to wrestle at an event and the aftermath of their wrath as being akin to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the name stuck. Anderson continued his reign as NWA Television Champion for most of the year, holding the championship for just over 9 months before losing it to Dusty Rhodes on September 9, 1986.

The first real setback with the Horsemen occurred at Starrcade 1986 after Anderson and Ole lost a Steel Cage match to the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express, with Ole getting pinned. The subsequent storyline positioned Ole as the weak link within the team, possibly attributed to his age. Ole&#x27;s position with the group was only further weakened after he decided to take two months off after Starrcade. After Ole&#x27;s return in February 1987, the other Horsemen turned on him and threw him out of the group, resulting in Ole incurring numerous attacks over the next several months. Afterwards, Ole was replaced with Lex Luger and the Horsemen resumed their dominance of the company.

As a member of the Horsemen, Anderson continued to be involved in high-profile angles within the company. By mid-1987, Anderson and fellow Horsemen Tully Blanchard began regularly competing as a tag team and rose quickly through the tag team ranks. The duo faced the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express for the NWA World Tag Team Championship on September 29, 1987, and were victorious. This win further solidified the group&#x27;s dominance in the company as Lex Luger was the reigning NWA United States Heavyweight Champion and Ric Flair spent most of 1987 as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, losing it to Ron Garvin in September, only to regain it at Starrcade 1987 on Thanksgiving night. Anderson and Tully continued to feud throughout the rest of the year and first few months of 1988 with the Road Warriors, the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express and the Midnight Express being their most frequent rivals.

By December 1987, Luger had defected from the Horsemen and began a heated feud with the group, with Ric Flair especially. In early 1988, Luger formed a tag team with Barry Windham and began challenging Anderson and Blanchard for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. The bigger, stronger team of Windham and Luger were eventually successful, winning the titles on March 27, 1988. The reign would be short lived, however, as Anderson and Blanchard regained the titles less than a month later after Barry Windham turned on Luger during their match and joined the Horsemen. Though Anderson and Blanchard were two of the biggest stars in Crockett&#x27;s company, they were frequently in dispute with Crockett over their pay. Despite the fact that the two, along with the Horsemen, were helping to generate millions of dollars in revenue for the company, they considered themselves to be underpaid. Their last contracted match with the company took place on September 10, 1988, when they dropped the NWA World Tag Team Championship to the Midnight Express before leaving for the WWF.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1988–1989) ===

Anderson and Blanchard left Crockett&#x27;s company to join Vince McMahon&#x27;s World Wrestling Federation. Upon being named the Brain Busters, the team took Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan as their manager and quickly began rising through the tag team ranks, eventually coming to challenge Demolition for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On July 18, 1989, the Brain Busters won the titles, ending Demolition&#x27;s historic reign of 478 days; the match would air on the July 29 edition of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXII&quot;. Although they would lose the titles back to Demolition on an episode of &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; just over three months later, the Brain Busters continued to be a force in the WWF&#x27;s tag team division.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1989–2001) ===

==== World Television Champion (1990–1991) ====
In December 1989, Anderson left the WWF and went back to WCW. Blanchard was slated to return as well but WWF accused him of testing positive for cocaine. Crockett&#x27;s company was now called World Championship Wrestling and was under the ownership of billionaire mogul Ted Turner. Anderson helped to reform the Horsemen and he quickly found success in the company, winning the NWA World Television Championship on January 2, 1990. Anderson remained the champion almost the entire year before dropping it to Tom Zenk. Zenk&#x27;s reign would be short lived, however, as Anderson regained the title, having been renamed the WCW World Television Championship on January 14, 1991. His third reign with the title was also considered successful as he held the title a little more than five months before dropping it to &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby Eaton on May 19, 1991. Afterwards, with Horsemen members Ric Flair and Sid Vicious gone to the WWF and Barry Windham having turned face, Anderson entered the tag team ranks of WCW.

==== World Tag Team Champion (1991–1992) ====
In the summer of 1991, Anderson formed a tag team with Larry Zbyszko and they called themselves the Enforcers. After competing for several months and moving up in the tag team ranks, they successfully captured the WCW World Tag Team Championship on September 2, 1991. The reign would be short lived, however, as they lost the titles roughly two and a half months later to Ricky Steamboat and Dustin Rhodes. Anderson and Zbyszko wrestled their final match as a tag team in December 1991 as part of WCW&#x27;s &quot;Roar Power&quot; tour of Europe.

Later in December 1991, Anderson joined Paul E. Dangerously&#x27;s new stable the Dangerous Alliance, where he formed a new tag team with &quot;Beautiful&quot; Bobby Eaton. They quickly moved up the tag team division and were soon a threat to Steamboat and Rhodes. Anderson and Eaton quickly won the titles on January 16, 1992, and defended the titles against all comers for the next four and a half months before losing the titles to the Steiner Brothers in May 1992. The Dangerous Alliance disbanded in November 1992 following Clash of the Champions XXI, following which Anderson took a short hiatus from WCW.

==== The Four Horsemen reunion (1993–1994) ====
Ric Flair returned to WCW in February 1993; as a result of a &quot;no-compete&quot; clause he was initially unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short-lived talk show segment called &quot;A Flair for the Gold&quot;. Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show&#x27;s set.

While still under WCW contract, Anderson wrestled a handful of matches for Smoky Mountain Wrestling in March and April 1993, teaming with the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express. At Slamboree &#x27;93: A Legends&#x27; Reunion in May 1993, Anderson unsuccessfully challenged Barry Windham for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

In May 1993, Anderson joined Ole Anderson and Ric Flair to once more reform the Four Horsemen. The Horsemen introduced Paul Roma as their newest member. Although athletic and a skilled in-ring competitor, Roma had spent much of his career as a jobber in the WWF. As part of an interview segment for the &quot;Ric Flair and the Four Horsemen&quot; DVD, Triple H stated that he thought the addition of Roma made the membership the weakest in the history of the group, and Arn himself referred to Roma as &quot;a glorified gym rat&quot;. Although Anderson and Roma won the WCW World Tag Team Championship in August, the group was seen as a failure by WCW. The stable disbanded in October 1993 after Anderson was legitimately injured in an altercation with Sid Vicious.

Anderson returned to the ring in December 1993, facing his former stablemate Paul Roma in a series of matches. In February 1994, he formed a short-lived tag team with Ricky Steamboat. In May 1994, Anderson wrestled at the Eastern Championship Wrestling event When Worlds Collide as part of a talent exchange between WCW and ECW. At the event, Anderson teamed with Terry Funk in an unsuccessful challenge to Sabu and Bobby Eaton.

==== Stud Stable; World Television Champion (1994–1995) ====
In May 1994, Anderson formed another new tag team, this one with Dustin Rhodes. At Bash at the Beach 1994, Anderson and Rhodes faced Col. Rob Parker&#x27;s Stud Stable; during the match, Anderson betrayed Rhodes and cost him them match, subsequently joining the Stud Stable alongside Terry Funk, Bunkhouse Buck, &quot;Stunning&quot; Steve Austin and Meng. The Stud Stable feuded with Dusty and Dustin Rhodes until late 1994 when Funk left.

Anderson&#x27;s last championship run began on January 8, 1995, after winning the World Television Championship from Johnny B. Badd. Anderson helped restore the prestige of the title, which he held for just over six months before dropping it to The Renegade at Great American Bash 1995. He briefly feuded with long-time friend Flair, and was assisted by Brian Pillman in his efforts.

==== The Four Horsemen reunion (1995–1997) ====
In 1995, Anderson reformed the Four Horsemen yet again with Flair, Anderson, Pillman, and a partner to be named later (who ended up being Chris Benoit).

By the end of 1996, Anderson rarely competed in the ring as years of wear and tear on his body finally started to catch up with him. On the November 25 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Anderson fought Luger to a double count-out in a quarter-final tournament match for the vacant WCW United States Championship.

==== Semi-retirement (1997–2002) ====
On the August 25, 1997, episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, Anderson formally announced his retirement from the ring. While standing in the ring, surrounded by Ric Flair and newest Horsemen members Steve McMichael and Benoit, Anderson declared that his last official act as the &quot;Enforcer&quot; for the Four Horsemen was to offer his &quot;spot&quot; in the group to Curt Hennig, as he was forced to retire due to extensive neck and upper back injuries. He worked a couple tag matches afterward, including teaming with David Flair on an episode of &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;, but his physical involvement was extremely limited in those bouts.

On the September 14, 1998, edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, alongside Steve McMichael, Dean Malenko, and Chris Benoit, Anderson ceremoniously reintroduced Ric Flair to WCW after his 12-month hiatus. In doing so, they reformed the Horsemen who then feuded with WCW President Eric Bischoff. Flair won the presidency of WCW from Bischoff on the December 28, 1998, episode of &quot;Nitro&quot; followed by winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Uncensored 1999 and turn heel in the process. Anderson remained Flair&#x27;s right-hand man during this time as he attempted to keep Flair&#x27;s delusional hunger for power at bay.

In 2000, Anderson was a member of the short-lived Old Age Outlaws. Led by Terry Funk, the group of veteran wrestlers battled the revived New World Order. On May 9, Anderson wrestled and lost to David Flair and a week later teamed with Ric Flair to defeat David Flair and Crowbar.

WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in early 2001, ending Anderson&#x27;s tenure there. He later made his return to the WWF.

=== Return to WWF/WWE (2001–2019) ===
Not long after the closing of WCW, Anderson became a road agent for WWF, renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002. He occasionally appeared on WWE television trying to, with the help of other WWE management, pull apart backstage brawls. Before the WCW/ECW Invasion storyline, Anderson took up color commentary for a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Booker T and Buff Bagwell, WCW Cruiserweight Championship match with Billy Kidman and Gregory Helms as well as another WCW Championship match between Diamond Dallas Page and Booker T, which would be his only appearances as a commentator in WWE. He made an appearance on &quot;Raw&quot; in 2002 delivering a video to Triple H before he was supposed to renew his wedding vows to then-heel, Stephanie McMahon. Anderson was assaulted by The Undertaker on February 25, 2002, in an episode of &quot;Raw&quot; leading up the Undertaker vs. Ric Flair match at WrestleMania X8. During that bout, Anderson made an in-ring appearance, delivering his signature &quot;spinebuster&quot; to The Undertaker. He would later turn heel by helping Ric Flair in his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, leading to Austin urinating on him. Anderson became a face once again on June 10, 2002, and attempted to help a then-babyface Flair gain sole ownership of WWE during a match with Mr. McMahon, but backed down from a confrontation with Brock Lesnar, who entered the ring to assist McMahon.

Anderson made a special appearance at the October 2006 &quot;Raw&quot; Family Reunion special, in which he was in Ric Flair&#x27;s corner for his match against Mitch of the Spirit Squad. Anderson was in the corner of Flair, Sgt. Slaughter, Dusty Rhodes, and Ron Simmons at Survivor Series 2006, where the four faced the Spirit Squad, but was ejected from the arena during the match. On the March 31, 2008 &quot;Raw&quot;, Anderson came out to say his final goodbye to Ric Flair and thank him for his career. At No Mercy, he was backstage congratulating Triple H for retaining the WWE Championship against Jeff Hardy.

On an episode of &quot;Smackdown Live&quot; in August 2016, Anderson made an appearance as one of the people asked by Heath Slater to be his tag team partner for the tournament to determine the inaugural winners of the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship. Anderson refused to help Slater upon learning that he was not Slater&#x27;s first choice as a tag team partner. On the August 8, 2017, episode of &quot;Smackdown Live&quot;, Anderson made a guest appearance on Fashion Police, revealing himself to be the one who destroyed Breezango&#x27;s toy horse, Tully, and boasting he was the best horse from The Four Horsemen, and that &quot;Tully&quot; should have been named &quot;Arn&quot;.

On February 22, 2019, it was reported Anderson had been released from the WWE. It was later reported this was due to Anderson allowing an intoxicated Alicia Fox to wrestle a match at a WWE Live Event on February 10. At Starcast II, Anderson spoke briefly about his release saying he didn&#x27;t want to be somewhere he was not wanted and the hours had become too much for him. He couldn&#x27;t say much due to being bound by a non-disclosure agreement.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019–2024) ===
On August 31, 2019, Anderson made a surprise appearance at the All Elite Wrestling (AEW) pay-per-view event, All Out, assisting Cody in his match against Shawn Spears by hitting Spears with a spinebuster. On November 6, 2019, Anderson would be a guest commentator on &quot;Dark&quot;.

On December 30, 2019, AEW announced that Anderson had signed a contract with the company as Cody&#x27;s personal advisor and head coach. He would make his &quot;Dynamite&quot; debut on the January 1, 2020, episode, assisting Cody to win his match against Darby Allin. On June 3, 2020, Anderson announced that he had signed a new multi-year contract with AEW.

On the June 11, 2021 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, in an interview with Tony Schiavone, Anderson, alongside his son Brock and Cody (now going under his original ring name Cody Rhodes), announced that Brock would be wrestling with AEW and would join the Nightmare Family. The interview was interrupted by Q. T. Marshall and a fight ensued. On the June 18 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Anderson accompanied Brock to the ring for his debut match. Brock, teaming with Rhodes defeated Marshall and Aaron Solow. After the match, Anderson hugged Brock and raised his hand.

On the September 29 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Anderson dumped Rhodes, who was on a losing streak, and left the ring with Lee Johnson, who had just successfully scored a winning pinfall while teaming with Rhodes. During the promo when he dumped Rhodes, Anderson (a real-life gun enthusiast) told him that Rhodes would allow a carjacker to steal his car while Anderson would &quot;pull out the Glock, put it on his forehead, and spill his brains all over the concrete&quot;. The promo, which received approval in advance from both Tony Khan and TNT, received universal critical praise from fans and other wrestlers, as the quote got Anderson trending on Twitter; AEW promptly released a T-shirt featuring the quote due to the reaction. Additionally, the promo was sampled by rapper JPEGMafia in the song &quot;End Credits&quot;. However, Anderson would afterwards resume coaching Rhodes, who would later go on to have another reign as AEW TNT Champion. Rhodes departed from the promotion in February 2022, which also caused the end of the Nightmare Family, but Anderson would continue to manage Brock and Johnson for the rest of the year.

On the April 19, 2023 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Anderson assisted Wardlow in his match with Powerhouse Hobbs to win the TNT Championship. Anderson and Wardlow began feuding with Christian Cage and Luchasaurus, and at Double or Nothing, he was involved in a spot where he bit the thumb of Luchasaurus. Wardlow ended up retaining the title at the event, but Anderson and Wardlow&#x27;s partnership ended after he lost the title to Luchasaurus on the June 17 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;. On the August 12 episode of &quot;Collision&quot;, held in Greensboro, North Carolina, Anderson was in Brock&#x27;s corner who unsuccessfully challenged Luchasaurus for the TNT Championship. Brock&#x27;s contract with the promotion would expire later that month and Anderson took a backstage role as a producer.

On May 28, 2024, Anderson announced on his podcast &quot;The ARN Show&quot; that he would not be renewing his AEW contract upon its expiration on May 31, 2024.

=== Second return to WWE (2024) ===
On August 3, 2024, Anderson made an appearance at WWE&#x27;s SummerSlam event in a backstage segment during Cody Rhodes&#x27; entrance as a part of the main event, promising Cody that he would not be facing The Bloodline alone. On January 25, 2025, Anderson was shown alongside Tully Blanchard in the crowd during Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXVII.

==Personal life==
Although he was billed as such, Lunde is not related to the Anderson family. He was given the name &quot;Anderson&quot; and was originally billed as Ole Anderson&#x27;s brother, and later billed as Ole&#x27;s nephew, because of his resemblance to Ole in appearance and wrestling style. He was also billed as Flair&#x27;s cousin at various times, even though he is not related to Ric Flair, but they are long time friends.

Lunde has been married to his wife Erin since 1985. They reside in Charlotte, North Carolina, and have two sons named Barrett and Brock, the latter of whom followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and became a professional wrestler. Lunde stated on an episode of his podcast &quot;The Arn Show&quot; that the only reason he had stayed in the business for so long was to make sure Brock was able to get his start in it.

During a WCW tour of Europe, Lunde and Sid Eudy (better known as Sid Vicious or Sycho Sid) were involved in an argument at a hotel bar in the English town of Blackburn on October 27, 1993. Anderson threatened Eudy with a broken bottle; after being sent to their rooms by security chief Doug Dillinger, Eudy later came to Lunde&#x27;s room and attacked him with a chair leg, and Lunde retaliated with pair of scissors. Eudy received four stab wounds while Lunde received twenty, losing a pint and a half of blood in the process. The fight was broken up by fellow wrestler 2 Cold Scorpio, who was credited with saving Lunde&#x27;s life. Neither man pressed charges against the other, and British police declined to do so since both men would soon be leaving the country. Eudy was later fired over the incident.

As stated in his biography, Lunde was thrown into the ring ropes during a match in 1994. The top rope broke from the turnbuckle, but he was able to land on his feet. Six months later, the same event happened again, but this time he landed full-force on to the concrete and hit his head, neck, and upper back. He never took time off to heal. As time passed, with no down time, the injuries worsened. In his biography, Lunde states that the first sign of problems was his left arm suddenly going numb and unresponsive during a match. Doctors found that a rib, possibly torn away from the spine during the accident, was popping in and out of the joint and causing shoulder discomfort and weakness. Upon seeing his chiropractor in Charlotte, North Carolina, and consulting medical experts in Atlanta, Georgia, the damage to Lunde&#x27;s body was found to be much more severe than previously thought and surgery was deemed the only option to keep his left arm functioning at all. Surgery occurred in Atlanta in late 1996 (resulting in a left posterior laminectomy of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical bones and a fusion of the 7th cervical and 1st thoracic bones) and was successful in repairing most of the damage, but Anderson still has some muscle weakness, loss of fine motor control, and loss of muscle mass in his left arm. He spent many weeks in the hospital during that time, crediting his recovery to his wife, his physical therapist, and the fact he did not want his children to be fatherless. He would be readmitted in March 1997 with symptoms akin to cardiac arrest and pulmonary failure, but was released soon afterwards.

On March 11, 2023, Lunde announced on Twitter that his son Barrett had died the night before at age 37.

<text>Charles Aaron &quot;Bubba&quot; Smith (February 28, 1945 – August 3, 2011) was an American professional football defensive end and actor. Smith played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Baltimore Colts, Oakland Raiders, and Houston Oilers.

Smith played college football for Michigan State University, where he twice earned All-American honors on the Spartans football team. Smith had a major role in a 10–10 tie against Notre Dame in 1966 that was billed as &quot;The Game of the Century&quot;. He is one of only six players to have his jersey number retired by the program. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988.

The first overall pick of the 1967 NFL/AFL draft, Smith played nine years in the NFL for the Colts, Raiders, and Oilers from 1967 to 1976. He was the Colts&#x27; starting left defensive end for five seasons, playing in Super Bowls III and V. He was named to two Pro Bowls and was a first-team All-Pro in 1971. He had tremendous quickness despite being and , a combination which usually earned him a double-team.

During his acting career, Smith specialized in comedic roles in film, television, and television advertising. For about a decade following his retirement from football, he appeared in various commercials for Miller Lite, alongside Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus. His best-known role was as Moses Hightower in the first six &quot;Police Academy&quot; movies.

Smith was posthumously diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurological condition generally related to head trauma. He is one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease.

==Early life==
Smith was born on February 28, 1945, in Orange, Texas, to Willie Ray Smith Sr. and Georgia Oreatha Curl Smith, and raised in nearby Beaumont. His father, Willie Ray Smith Sr., was a football coach who earned 235 victories at three high schools in the Beaumont area. Bubba had the opportunity to play for his father at Charlton-Pollard High School in Beaumont. He developed into one of the state&#x27;s best-ever high school football players. Smith&#x27;s younger brother Tody Smith played collegiately for the University of Southern California, and professionally for the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Oilers, and Buffalo Bills.

==Football career==
===College===
Smith originally had hopes of playing college football at the University of Texas. Even though Longhorns head coach Darrell Royal regarded him as worthy of an athletic scholarship, Royal was unwilling to offer one in the face of racial segregation which prevailed throughout the southern United States at the time. Texas was then a member of the Southwest Conference (SWC), which began to integrate in 1967. The university&#x27;s football program lagged behind, before acquiescing in 1970.

The situation at UT motivated Smith to become a much better player at Michigan State University, where he was an All-American in both 1965 and 1966. He was a popular athlete at Michigan State, earning the arresting fan chant of &quot;Kill, Bubba, Kill.&quot;

His final game at Michigan State was a 10–10 tie with Notre Dame at Spartan Stadium on November 19, 1966. With both teams undefeated, untied and ranked atop the national polls going in (The Fighting Irish were ranked #1 at 8–0–0, the Spartans #2 at 9–0–0), the match-up was hyped as the college &quot;Game of the Century&quot;. Early in the first quarter, Smith tackled Notre Dame starting quarterback Terry Hanratty, who sustained a separated left shoulder. Hanratty was replaced for the remainder of the game by Coley O&#x27;Brien. Smith, who admitted that Hanratty&#x27;s injury actually backfired on the Spartans, stated, &quot;That didn&#x27;t help us any. It just let them put in that O&#x27;Brien who&#x27;s slippery and faster and gave us more trouble. The other guy just sits there and waits, and that&#x27;s what we wanted.&quot; Michigan State finished second behind Notre Dame in the final voting for the national championship.

In 1988, Smith was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. Michigan State retired his number 95 jersey on September 23, 2006, prior to the Spartans&#x27; home game against Notre Dame, amid repeated cheers of his old slogan from the student section. This game also celebrated the 40th anniversary of the &quot;Game of the Century.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; included him on its All-Century Team for college football.

===Professional===

Smith was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1967 NFL draft, taken by the Baltimore Colts with a selection originally held by the expansion New Orleans Saints, which had been traded for quarterback Gary Cuozzo. Smith&#x27;s Michigan State teammate, running back Clint Jones, followed him as the second pick. , Smith is the only Michigan State player to be taken first overall.

Smith spent nine seasons in the NFL as a defensive end and played in the Super Bowl twice in his first five seasons. The heavily-favored Colts lost Super Bowl III to the New York Jets and won Super Bowl V two years later following the 1970 season. It was Smith&#x27;s only Super Bowl ring. However, in interviews, Smith stated that he would never wear the ring, out of a sense of disappointment that he and his teammates were unable to win Super Bowl III.

Smith was injured at Tampa Stadium in the 1972 preseason, when he ran into a solid steel pole the NFL was using at the time to mark yardage and missed the season. He filed a lawsuit against the Tampa Sports Authority and the NFL for $2.5 million. Smith contended the referees mishandled the markers, creating &quot;an undue hazard&quot;. The court battle lasted six years before ending in a mistrial.

Smith was traded from the Colts to the Oakland Raiders for Raymond Chester on July 16, 1973. He finished his career with the Houston Oilers. Smith was selected All-Pro one year, All-Conference two years, and went to two Pro Bowls. His legacy is the inspiration behind the documentary, &quot;Through the Banks of the Red Cedar&quot;, written and directed by MSU teammate Gene Washington&#x27;s daughter, Maya.

==Acting career==
After retiring from professional football, Smith began acting in small movie and television roles in the late 1970s and early 1980s. He is perhaps best known for his role as Moses Hightower in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; movie series, a role he reprised in all but one of the &quot;Police Academy&quot; sequels. He also played as the chauffeur for Ned Beatty&#x27;s character, Clyde Torkle, in the movie &quot;Stroker Ace&quot; starring Burt Reynolds.

Smith starred in the short-lived television series &quot;Blue Thunder&quot;, partnering with Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive star Dick Butkus, with whom he frequently costarred in advertisements for Miller Lite beer. Among other television series Smith appeared in were &quot;Good Times&quot;, &quot;Half Nelson&quot;, &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Open All Night&quot;.

Smith was the longtime spokesman of Baltimore-area law firm Cohen, Snyder, Eisenberg &amp; Katzenberg.

==Personal life==
In 1983, Smith published the autobiography entitled &quot;Kill, Bubba, Kill&quot;, in which he stated he felt it was possible Super Bowl III had been rigged to enable the Jets to win in order to ensure the AFL–NFL merger proceeded smoothly.

Smith was found dead in his Los Angeles home by his caretaker on August 3, 2011. He died from acute drug intoxication and heart disease. Phentermine, a weight-loss drug, was found in his system. His heart weighed more than twice that of an average similar male. He was 66 years old.

===CTE diagnosis===
On May 24, 2016, it was announced that Smith had the brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative illness affecting unknown numbers of former athletes in contact sports. The findings were confirmed by researchers affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation, and released with the permission of the executor of Smith&#x27;s estate.

Smith is the 90th former NFL player found to have had CTE by the researchers at the Boston University brain bank; they have examined 94 former pro players. According to the Concussion Legacy Foundation, on a scale of 1 to 4 used by the neuropathologist who examined Smith&#x27;s brain, Smith had Stage 3 CTE, with symptoms including cognitive impairment and problems with judgment and planning.

<text>Jean Marcel Adolphe Bruller (26 February 1902 – 10 June 1991) was a French writer and illustrator who co-founded the publishing company with Pierre de Lescure.

Born to a Hungarian-Jewish father, he joined the Resistance during the World War II occupation of northern France and his texts were published using the pseudonym Vercors (though he used this name for works published before the 1944 Battle of Vercors).

Several of his novels have fantasy or science fiction themes. The 1952 novel &quot;Les Animaux dénaturés&quot; (translated into English variously as &quot;You Shall Know Them&quot;, &quot;Borderline&quot;, and &quot;The Murder of the Missing Link&quot;) was made into the movie &quot;Skullduggery&quot; (1970) featuring Burt Reynolds and Susan Clark, and examines the question of what it means to be human.

&quot;Colères&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Insurgents&quot;) is about the quest for immortality. In 1960 he published &quot;Sylva&quot;, a novel about a fox who becomes a woman, inspired by David Garnett&#x27;s novel &quot;Lady into Fox&quot; (1922). The English-language version, translated by his wife Rita Barisse, was a finalist for the 1963 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

His historical novel &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; (1985) presents a very intelligent Anne as having determinedly set about marrying Henry VIII of England in order to separate England from Papal power and strengthen England&#x27;s independence.

<text>The vz. 58 (or Sa vz. 58) is a 7.62×39mm assault rifle that was designed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia and accepted into service in the late 1950s as the 7,62 mm samopal vzor 58, replacing the vz. 52 self-loading rifle and the 7.62×25mm Tokarev Sa 24 and Sa 26 submachine guns.

While externally the vz. 58 resembles the Soviet AK-47, it is a different design based on a short-stroke gas piston. The only similarity it has with Kalashnikov rifles is the ammunition.

==History==

Development of the weapon began in 1956; leading the project was chief engineer Jiří Čermák assigned to the Konstrukta Brno facility in the city of Brno. The Soviet Union had begun insisting that the Warsaw Pact forces standardize on a common ammunition. As a result, the prototype, known as the &quot;Koště&quot; (&quot;broom&quot;), was designed to chamber the intermediate Soviet 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge, rather than the Czech 7.62×45mm vz. 52 round, used in both the earlier vz. 52 rifle and the vz. 52 light machine gun. The assault rifle entered service in 1958 and over a period of 25 years (until 1984), over 920,000 weapons had been produced, fielded by the armed forces of Czechoslovakia, Cuba and several Asian and African nations.

The vz. 58 was produced in three main variants: the standard vz. 58 P (&quot;Pěchotní&quot; or &quot;infantry&quot;) model with a fixed buttstock made of a synthetic material (plastic impregnated wood, older versions used a wooden stock), the vz. 58 V (&quot;Výsadkový&quot;—&quot;airborne&quot;), featuring a side-folding metal shoulder stock, folded to the right side, and the vz. 58 Pi (&quot;Pěchotní s infračerveným zaměřovačem&quot;—&quot;infantry with infrared sight&quot;), which is similar to the vz. 58 P but includes a receiver-mounted dovetail rail bracket (installed on the left side of the receiver) used to attach an NSP2 night sight; it also has a detachable folding bipod and an enlarged conical flash suppressor. For the first two variants, the two types of stock are interchangeable and mount to the same mounting point on the rifle itself, which is identical in either variant.

A successor to the vz. 58 was proposed in the 1990s; the 5.56×45mm NATO ČZ 2000 assault rifle has been suggested as a possible replacement but due to a general lack of defense funds within the Czech Republic, the program was postponed. Another recent contender is the ČZW-556 assault rifle and ČZW-762 light machine gun which both use lever-delayed blowback which has more reliable accuracy and performance over the gas operation. In 2011, the Czech army started replacing vz. 58 with CZ-805 BREN. While vz. 58 still remains the main assault rifle of the Slovak army, the Slovak army has also been eyeing CZ-805 as a possible replacement to the aging vz. 58 rifles.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===

The vz. 58 is a selective fire gas-operated weapon that bleeds expanding combustion gases generated in the barrel from the ignited cartridge through a port drilled in the barrel, from the chamber, opening into a hollow cylinder located above the barrel that contains a short-stroke piston. The vz. 58 does not have a gas regulator and the full force of the gas pressure is exerted on the piston head, propelling it backwards in a single impulsive blow. The piston is driven back only when a shoulder on the piston rod butts against the seating and no further movement is possible. There is a light return spring held between the piston shoulder and the seating which returns the piston to its forward position. The gas cylinder is vented after the piston has traveled back and the remaining gases are exhausted into the atmosphere on the underside of the cylinder via two ports. The entire piston rod is chromium-plated to prevent fouling.

The locking system features a locking piece hinged from the bolt and housed in the bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the receiver&#x27;s internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After of unrestricted travel, a wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the hinged breech locking piece and lifts it up and out of engagement with the locking recesses in the steel body. The hinged breech locking piece swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for primary extraction. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty cartridge casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun.

===Features===
The spring-loaded extractor and firing pin are both housed inside the bolt, while the fixed ejector is slotted inside the receiver. The extractor retains the firing pin and is powered by its own plunger and spring.

The weapon does not have a conventional rotating hammer but a linear hammer instead. The hammer is a steel cylinder hollowed from one end almost throughout its entire length to accommodate its own operating spring. At the open end of the cylinder, a plate is welded and a groove is cut in each side of this to slide on the receiver guide rails. This linear hammer enters the hollow bolt and drives a free-floating firing pin forward with each shot.

The vz.58 uses a trigger mechanism with a lever-type fire mode selector, which is also a manual safety against accidental discharge. When the selector lever is placed in its rear position (&quot;1&quot;—single fire) the sear is disabled and the left hammer catch is rotated by the disconnector, which is depressed by the bolt carrier after every shot and is therefore disconnected from the hammer catch. The forward setting of the selector lever (&quot;30&quot;—automatic fire) disables the disconnector, and the left hammer catch meshes with the sear mechanism. The center (&quot;safe&quot;) setting with the selector lever pointing vertically downwards, mechanically lowers the trigger bar and the disconnector so there is no connection between the trigger and the semi-automatic sear which holds the hammer. The rifle also has an internal safety, which prevents the weapon from discharging when out of battery. The right linear hammer catch disables it, and it can only be released by pulling the charging handle back and cocking the weapon.

The weapon is fed from a detachable box magazine with a 30-round cartridge capacity and made from a lightweight aluminium alloy. When the last round from the magazine is fired, the bolt will remain locked open on the bolt catch, activated by the magazine&#x27;s follower. The magazine release tab is located at the base of the receiver on the left side, behind the magazine well. The bolt carrier has a built-in guide rail used for reloading from 10-round stripper clips (from the SKS rifle). Despite their similarity, vz. 58 magazines are not interchangeable with those of the Kalashnikov-pattern weapons.

An interesting feature on this rifle is the ability to quickly change the type of stock. The vz. 58 can appear either with its original fixed stock (in either beech wood or composite material) or folding steel stock, or with one of the many aftermarket stocks available – including AR-15 style stock adapters that mount a buffer tube to the receiver. The latter usually has the buffer tube slightly angled down as to compensate for the very low ironsights on the vz. 58. Switching between the various options requires merely removal of a bolt at the rear of the receiver and swapping in the stock of choice.

===Sights===
The rifle&#x27;s iron sights consist of a fully adjustable front post and a tangent rear sight with a sliding notch with range denominations from 100 to 800 m, graduated every 100 m. Besides this, the left side of the rear sight leaf is marked with the letter &quot;U&quot; (&quot;univerzální&quot; meaning &quot;universal&quot;), for snap shooting, firing at moving targets and night combat at ranges up to 300 m. The rifle&#x27;s sight radius is . The front sight base also serves as a mounting platform for the vz. 58 edged bayonet.

===Accessories===
Several modernization accessories have been manufactured for the vz. 58 platform from different companies.
Accessories include &quot;tactical&quot; bolt release, extended and/or ambidextrous magazine release paddles, ambidextrous fire mode selectors, custom handguard rails, several types of sight mounting options and various muzzle brakes and compensators. Both civilian and military users use these upgrades, and they also see frequent use with private military companies in the Middle East.

Additional equipment supplied with the rifle includes: 4 spare magazines, a magazine pouch (in either canvas, leather, or leatherette), vz. 58 bayonet and scabbard, cleaning brush and rod, muzzle cap, oil bottle, unified sling, front sight adjustment tool, disassembly aid and a threaded blank-firing adaptor. The vz. 58 also has a proprietary bipod, flash hider and scope mount for NSP-2 night vision scope (vz.58 P variant). Grenade launching inserts, as well as under barrel grenade launchers were developed but never adopted.

<text>Kickin&#x27; It at the Barn is the 14th studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 2003 (see 2003 in music). The album&#x27;s name came from its recording at guitarist Fred Tackett&#x27;s barn in Topanga Canyon. Tackett made his debut as a lead vocalist on this album with his own song &quot;In A Town Like This&quot;, fifteen years after he joined the group. The song also served as the title track of Tackett&#x27;s solo debut, released the same year.

<text>A continuous-rod warhead is a specialized munition exhibiting an annular blast fragmentation pattern, thus when exploding it spreads into a large circle cutting through the target. It is used in anti-aircraft and anti-missile missiles.

== Early anti-aircraft munitions ==

Rifle and machine-gun bullets were used against early military aircraft during World War I. Artillery was used when aircraft flew above the range of rifle and machine-gun cartridges. Since the probability of actually striking the aircraft was small, artillery shells were designed to explode at the approximate altitude of the aircraft to throw a shower of fragments in the vicinity of the explosion. Similar anti-aircraft weaponry with larger calibers, higher rates of fire, and improved fuzes continued to be used through World War II. These bullets and small fragments often made small holes in the airframe. Unless a bullet or fragment struck the pilot, or some critical part of the airframe, (like a fuel line, part of the engine coolant system, a critical wire or hydraulic line actuating control surfaces), the aircraft remained operational. Some anti-aircraft artillery projectiles were designed to fragment into long, thin pieces in an attempt to inflict damage on the airframe. Holes made by such fragments were more likely to cause destructive disruption of airflow around high-speed aircraft, but the hit probability was lowered for the smaller number of fragments from a warhead of equal size.

The problem became more significant as anti-aircraft missiles were developed to replace guns after World War II: A smaller number of missiles would require an improved warhead to match the aircraft destruction probability of the larger number of artillery projectiles potentially carried by a weapon of the same size and cost.

The concept of a folded continuous rod warhead was suggested in 1952. The Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University invented the Continuous Expanding Rod Warhead as part of its Navy-contracted development of the U. S. Navy&#x27;s anti-air missile defense program. The details of the warhead were Top Secret until its use was no longer needed.

==Construction==
An even number of individual steel rods are arranged in parallel to form a cylinder. The ends of the rods are welded together—the first rod and the second rod are welded together at the top, the second and third at the bottom, and so on all the way around the form.
==Operation==

When detonated, the high explosive imparts momentum to the rods, thrusting them outward in an expanding circle. The pressure wave from the explosive needs to act evenly on the rods over their length, so some sort of tamper is used to shape the shock wave similar to an explosive lens. The rods are sufficiently soft (ductile) to allow the expansion without breaking the rods or the welded joints, and the detonation velocity is limited to under 1,150 m/s, allowing the rods to bend at these locations instead. At some intermediate point the ring will have a zig-zag (alternating direction) appearance within a cylindrical envelope. Upon ultimate expansion the ring is circular and contained within a plane. The ring will then break and ultimately tend to form one or more straight rods. Since the net momentum of the rod relative to the missile is roughly zero, its effectiveness will rapidly diminish as the broken ring expands.

This rapidly expanding ring, when hitting the aircraft, can be more effective than an equivalent fragmentation warhead: the ring of rods provides a larger surface area than a fragmented ballistic. Portions of the aircraft intercepted by the expanding ring of the continuous rod warhead will receive a continuous cut through the skin, flight or aerodynamic surfaces, underlying cables, hydraulic lines, and other flight or mission-critical structures. This may cause a structural failure, or, if not, can be sufficient for defeating the redundancy of aircraft systems. The effect is only pronounced as long as the ring is unbroken, so multiple layers of rods are employed in practical weapons to increase the effective radius.

When designing the ill-fated SAM-equipped Mauler, Monte Carlo simulations on the then-state-of-the-art IBM 650 indicated that a continuous-rod warhead was likely to be less effective than blast fragmentation types. Subsequent implementations indicated the opposite.

<doc id="1045845" wikidata="Q2651749" url="?curid=1045845" title="Breast fetishism">
<text>As a paraphilia, breast fetishism (also known as mastofact, breast partialism, or mazophilia) is a sexual interest that focuses exclusively on the female breasts, and is a type of partialism. The term &quot;breast fetishism&quot; is also used in the non-paraphilic sense, to refer to cultural attention to female breasts and the sexuality they represent.

Scientists hypothesize that non-paraphilic sexual attraction to breasts is the result of their function as a secondary sex characteristic. The breasts play roles in both sexual pleasure and reproduction.

Some authors have discussed the modern widespread fascination with breasts among heterosexual males in Western societies, especially in the United States, within the context of sexual fetishism.

==Scientific explanation==
Scientists hypothesize that non-paraphilic sexual attraction to breasts is the result of their function as a secondary sex characteristic. The breasts play roles in both sexual pleasure and reproduction. Heterosexual males typically find female breasts attractive and this holds true for a variety of cultures.

Zoologist and ethologist Desmond Morris theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks, which according to Morris in &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; is also unique to humans, other primates as a rule having much flatter buttocks. Evolutionary psychologists theorize that humans&#x27; permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates&#x27; breasts, which only enlarge during ovulation, allows human females to &quot;solicit [human] male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile&quot;. Research has also shown that women with larger and more symmetrical breasts have higher levels of fertility.

Sexual attraction to breasts is considered normal unless it is exclusive and is therefore a form of partialism.

==Society and culture==
===General===

There is a widespread fascination with women&#x27;s breasts, and especially their size. Many people, both male and female, consider breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic.

Modern female fashions which focus on tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed to an increase in breast fetishism. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as well as aesthetic or erotic. Most heterosexual men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman&#x27;s breasts, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline, it may draw attention. There are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public. The extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by dress codes in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of nipples or areolae is almost always considered toplessness, considered by some to be immodest and in some instances as lewd or indecent behavior. Art historian James Laver argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage are more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.

Film producers such as Russ Meyer produced films which featured actresses with large breasts. &quot;Lorna&quot; (1964) was the first of his films where the lead actress, Lorna Maitland, was selected on the basis of breast size. Other large-breasted actresses used by Meyer include Kitten Natividad, Erica Gavin, Tura Satana, and Uschi Digard. Most were naturally large-breasted; Meyer occasionally cast women in their first trimesters of pregnancy to enhance their breast size even further. Author and director William Rotsler said, &quot;With &quot;Lorna&quot; Meyer established the formula that made him rich and famous, the formula of people filmed at top hate, top lust, top heavy.&quot;

With regard to pornography, according to statistics from the websites Pornhub and YouPorn, preference for either breasts or the buttocks varies between countries and, on average, between world regions; the United States and most of Latin America and Africa is in the buttocks group, and most of Europe and much of Asia is in the breasts group.

===Alternative opinions===
The term &quot;breast fetishism&quot; is also used within ethnographic and feminist contexts to describe a society with a culture devoted to breasts, usually as sexual objects. Some feminists have argued that incidents of breast fetishism have been found going back to the neolithic era, with the goddess shrines of Çatalhöyük (in modern Turkey). The archaeological excavations of the town in revealed the walls of the shrine(s) adorned with disembodied pairs of breasts that appeared to have &quot;an existence of their own&quot;. Elizabeth Gould Davis argues that breasts (along with phalluses) were revered by the women of Çatalhöyük as instruments of motherhood, but it was after what she describes as a patriarchal revolution – when men had appropriated both phallus worship and &quot;the breast fetish&quot; for themselves – that these organs &quot;acquired the erotic significance with which they are now endowed&quot;.

Some authors from the United States have discussed attraction to female breasts within the context of sexual fetishism, and have stated that it is the American fetish-object of choice, or that breast fetishism is predominantly found in the United States. In &quot;Patterns of Sexual Behavior&quot;, a 1951 analysis of 191 traditional cultures, the researchers noted that stimulation of the female breast by the male before sex &quot;seemed absent in all subhuman forms, although it is common among the members of many different human societies.&quot;

===Motorboating===
A form of breast fetishism where a person places their face into the cleavage between a woman&#x27;s breasts and moves it from side-to-side is known as motorboating. The person performing the act may also make the sound of a motorboat, from which the name is derived. This act can also be performed in reverse with the woman placing another person&#x27;s face in between her breasts and moving them from side to side.

Hebrew has many idiomatic terms that are not easily translatable to other languages, for example בארבע עיניים &quot;be&#x27;arba enayim&quot;, literally &#x27;with four eyes,&#x27; means face to face without the presence of a third person, as in, &#x27;The two men met with four eyes.&#x27; The expression לא דובים ולא יער &quot;lo dubim ve lo ya&#x27;ar&quot; is literally &quot;neither bears nor forest&quot; but means that something is completely false. The saying טמן את ידו בצלחת &quot;taman et yado batsalakhat&quot; &quot;buried his hand in the dish&quot; means that someone idles away his time.&quot;

==Lexical items deriving from Hebrew==
&quot;Hebraism&quot; may also refer to a lexical item with Hebrew etymology, i.e. that (ultimately) derives from Hebrew. For example, the English word &quot;stiff-necked&quot;, meaning &quot;stubborn&quot;, is a calque of Greek σκληροτράχηλος, which is a calque of Hebrew קשה עורף &quot;qeshēh ʿōref&quot; &quot;hard of neck; stubborn&quot;. Similar calques are &quot;the way of women&quot; (דרך נשים) &quot;menstruation&quot; and &quot;flowing with milk and honey&quot; (זבת חלב ודבש) &quot;abundance&quot;.

Sometimes Hebraisms can be coined using non-Hebrew structure. For example, the Yiddish lexical item ישיבה בחור &quot;yeshive bokher&quot;, meaning &quot;Yeshivah student&quot;, uses a Germanic structure but two Hebrew lexical items.

== Distinctive language ==
Beyond simple etymology, both spoken and written Hebrew is marked by peculiar linguistic elements that distinguish its semitic roots. This hebraism includes word order, chiasmus, compound prepositions, and numerous other distinctive features.

== Systematic Hebraisms==
Finally, the word &quot;hebraism&quot; describes a quality, character, nature, or method of thought, or system of religion attributed to the Hebrew people. It is in this sense that Matthew Arnold (1869) contrasted Hebraism with Hellenism, identifying Thomas Carlyle as his age&#x27;s embodiment of the former. Feldman&#x27;s response to Arnold expands on this usage. Leo Strauss is also well-known for his metaphorical juxtaposition of Jerusalem and Athens in a similar light. Furthermore, Friedrich Nietzsche and Otto Weiniger thought in terms of similar dualities as well.

<doc id="1045854" wikidata="Q1470025" url="?curid=1045854" title="Cambridge Declaration">
<text>The Cambridge Declaration is a statement of faith written in 1996 by the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, a group of Reformed and Lutheran Evangelicals who were concerned with the state of the Evangelical movement in America, and throughout the world.

==Beginnings==
===&quot;No Place for Truth&quot;===
Both the conference and the eventual declaration came about as a result of David F. Wells&#x27; 1993 book &quot;No Place for Truth or Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology?&quot; (). This book was highly critical of the Evangelical church in America for abandoning its historical and theological roots, and instead embracing the philosophies and pragmatism of the world.

While not a best seller, the book was critically acclaimed by a number of important Evangelical leaders. In 1994 a number of these leaders formed the &quot;Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals&quot;. Since much of Wells&#x27; thesis stemmed from the modern church&#x27;s abandonment of historical confessions of faith (such as The Westminster Confession and the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith), the Alliance was based upon Evangelicals who not only adhered to these Reformed confessions of faith, but were able to direct their ministries accordingly.

The two principal players involved in spearheading the conference from which the Cambridge Declaration emerged were James Montgomery Boice of Evangelical Ministries (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), and Dr. Michael S. Horton of Christians United for Reformation (Anaheim, California). Like Wells, Horton and Boice were both strong critics of the shallow nature of contemporary Evangelicalism, and had published a book to that effect. Later in 1996, these men joined forces by merging their respective organizations into The Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals.

===Conference in Cambridge===
Eventually a conference was held between April 17–20, 1996 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The choice of location was deliberate, since Cambridge was the seat of Harvard University and thus the center of ecclesiastical and intellectual life in 17th century America. Cambridge was also the location of The Cambridge Platform, a declaration of church polity made in 1648 by New England Puritans.

Approximately 100 delegates from around the world gathered for the four-day conference, with the explicit intention of creating an official declaration that would be released once the conference concluded. The conference was also important because it included the presence of evangelical Lutherans, who had traditionally kept themselves apart from mainline Evangelical and Reformed movements.

Throughout the conference, a document was drafted, and suggestions and changes were solicited from the delegates. The two principal authors of the Cambridge Declaration, however, were Dr. David F. Wells, and Dr. Michael S. Horton. The papers delivered at the conference were later edited and published in the book &quot;Here We Stand&quot; (Baker Books), edited by James Montgomery Boice and Ben Sasse (republished in 2004).

==Reasons for the Declaration==
The conference, and the eventual declaration that was created, was broadly influenced by the following:

* The culture of the modern world (as represented by Postmodernism) is changing the message that the church preaches. 
* The erosion of Christian doctrine within the modern church, including the lack of Expository preaching. 
* The increasing influence of Relativism within the church, which has led to an environment where &quot;truth&quot; is subjectively determined, and where church leaders aim to preach only &quot;positive&quot; messages.
* The increasing focus upon man, rather than God, within the church.
* An increasing focus on man&#x27;s ability to respond to God&#x27;s grace, rather than a focus upon God&#x27;s ability to save man. 
* A focus on the quantitative and measurable aspects of church growth (which thus links Christian ministry with outward success) rather than the qualitative and spiritual aspects of Biblical ministry.

==Content of the Declaration==
The declaration is a call to repentance for the evangelical church in order to reaffirm the historical Christian truths that are articulated by The Five solas and deny modern teachings:

1. Sola Scriptura: The Erosion of Authority
:* A reaffirmation that the Bible contains all things necessary to understand and obey God. 
:* A denial that any other form of authority is needed to bind the conscience of the Christian.
2. Solus Christus: The Erosion of Christ-Centered Faith
:* A reaffirmation that Christ alone and his penal substitutionary atonement on the cross are the means by which all Christians are saved.
:* A denial that the Gospel can be preached without the atonement being declared and without faith being solicited from the listeners.
3. Sola Gratia: The Erosion of The Gospel
:* A reaffirmation that salvation is a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit.
:* A denial that salvation is in any sense a work of the human heart, either fully or partially.
4. Sola Fide: The Erosion Of The Chief Article
:* A reaffirmation that a person is justified (declared innocent) before God through faith alone and through Christ alone – that Christ&#x27;s righteousness is imputed to the Christian.
:* A denial that justification relies upon any human merit, and that churches which teach this cannot be considered legitimate churches.
5. Soli Deo Gloria: The Erosion of God-Centered Worship
:* A reaffirmation that salvation is ultimately for God&#x27;s glory rather than man&#x27;s, and that Christians everywhere should understand that they are under God&#x27;s authority and act for his glory alone.
:* A denial that God can be glorified through &quot;entertainment&quot;-style worship; the removal of law and/or gospel in preaching; and preaching that focuses upon self-improvement, self-esteem and self fulfillment.

==Attitudes towards the Roman Catholic Church==
The declaration reflects traditional conservative Protestantism in its rejection of the Roman Catholic Church as a legitimate church. This is mainly due to the differences expressed over the issue of Justification. These rejections of the Roman Catholic Church are found implicitly and explicitly in the text of the Declaration:

* In Thesis one (Sola Scriptura), the text asserts &quot;We deny that any creed, council or individual may bind a Christian&#x27;s conscience&quot;. While this has a universal application, it is specifically aimed at the Roman Catholic Church and its insistence that Scripture is to be interpreted by the church&#x27;s institutions and historical councils, and of the Pope&#x27;s authority.
* In Thesis four (Sola Fide), the text asserts &quot;We deny that justification rests on any merit to be found in us, or upon the grounds of an infusion of Christ&#x27;s righteousness in us, or that an institution claiming to be a church that denies or condemns sola fide can be recognized as a legitimate church.&quot; It is this last phrase that indicates a rejection of the Roman Catholic Church, since it is clearly an &quot;institution&quot; that &quot;denies or condemns&quot; the Reformation understanding of Sola Fide.
* In the section Call To Repentance And Reformation, the following point is made: &quot;We also earnestly call back erring professing evangelicals who have deviated from God&#x27;s Word in the matters discussed in this Declaration. This includes those... who claim that evangelicals and Roman Catholics are one in Jesus Christ even where the biblical doctrine of justification is not believed.&quot; This is an explicit reference to the issue discussed in Thesis four.

==Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal Christianity==
The declaration also contains many statements that were intended to criticize the influence and theology of the modern Charismatic movement, along with the continual influence of the historic Pentecostal movement:

* In Thesis one (Sola Scriptura), the text asserts &quot;We deny that... the Holy Spirit speaks independently of or contrary to what is set forth in the Bible, or that personal spiritual experience can ever be a vehicle of revelation.&quot; In seeking to declare that Scripture is the sole source of the Spirit&#x27;s revelatory work, the declaration is at odds with the entire Charismatic and Pentecostal movement with this statement. Private and personal revelation – outside the work of the Bible – is of critical importance to Christians in this movement. Essentially, the declaration calls upon these Christians to stop seeking private revelation and seek guidance from the Bible only.
* In Thesis two (Solus Christus), the text asserts &quot;We deny that the gospel is preached if Christ&#x27;s substitutionary work is not declared and faith in Christ and his work is not solicited.&quot; This is a criticism of the practice of calling for people to &quot;make a decision&quot; through various means without actually preaching the Gospel. In many cases, when people are asked to &quot;come forward&quot; in these churches, it has come at the end of a sermon which may be emotionally charged, but which has not explained the Gospel as represented by the Atonement.
* In Thesis three (Sola Gratia), it states &quot;We deny that salvation is in any sense a human work. Human methods, techniques or strategies by themselves cannot accomplish this transformation. Faith is not produced by our unregenerated human nature.&quot; This section is a specific reference to the influence of revivalism in American Christianity – especially in the influence of historical preachers such as Charles Grandison Finney (especially in the last phrase). It asserts that emotionally manipulative techniques that exist within Charismatic and Pentecostal churches are not necessarily evidence of the work of the Holy Spirit. Moreover, the existence of these emotionally charged atmospheres within a church is certainly not a guarantee that people who have &quot;been saved&quot; in this environment have, in fact, been truly regenerated by the Holy Spirit.
* In Thesis five (Soli Deo Gloria), it states &quot;We deny that we can properly glorify God if our worship is confused with entertainment, if we neglect either Law or Gospel in our preaching, or if self-improvement, self-esteem or self-fulfillment are allowed to become alternatives to the gospel.&quot; Considering the fact that many Charismatic and Pentecostal churches have entertaining worship services, and that the focus of preaching is not necessarily an exposition of the Bible but a positive message of self-fulfillment, this part of the Declaration is also evidence of a critical attitude towards this section of the Christian church.

==Purposes of the declaration, according to participants==
*&quot;In 1994 Dr. James M. Boice called a number of us together in Philadelphia to discuss the possibilities of forming an alliance. Although many of us were already engaged in this sort of work in some fashion, Gordon-Conwell Seminary professor David F. Wells&#x27; book, No Place for Truth, Or Whatever Happened to Evangelical Theology? had just appeared and helped to organize us around a common concern. We came to seek God&#x27;s wisdom together as to how we should proceed…&quot;
:: —Michael S. Horton

*&quot;If we evaluate the pragmatism of the pragmatists on a pragmatic basis, we have to say that by their own standards they have failed. Why don&#x27;t American medical statistics reflect the healings of the charismatics? Why don&#x27;t our crime statistics reflect the holy living of evangelicals? Why, after a generation of church growth methodology and user-friendly worship, is church attendance down significantly?&quot; 
::— Robert Godfrey: One of the framers and a member of the United Reformed Church.

*&quot;This is a somber matter; we are repeating on the evangelical side the very attitudes which led to the birth of liberalism. The irony is that the very things which led to the liberalism which has been the great enemy of evangelicalism early on in this century have been taken into the evangelical churches. We are fools if we think that what happened in liberalism will not happen in evangelicalism too unless we repent and recover the gospel.&quot; 
::— David F. Wells: One of the framers and a member of the Congregational church.

*&quot;What lies ahead of evangelicalism if it does not correct its path is it is going to give birth to a new liberalism. If (the alliance of Confessing Evangelicals – the framers of the Cambridge Declaration) is effective, on the other hand, it is going to give birth to a new focussed resurgence of reformational Christianity. These two paths will become the alternatives between which people are going to have to choose.&quot;
:: — David F. Wells

*&quot;Luther&#x27;s theology of the cross totally destroys the modern gospel of success. It&#x27;s in Calvin too, but a lot of people don&#x27;t realize that.&quot; 
:: — Dr. G. Edward Veith: One of the framers and a member of the Lutheran church.

*&quot;Worship should not be confused with feelings. It is true that the worship of God will affect us, and one thing it will frequently affect is our emotions. At times tears will fill our eyes as we become aware of God&#x27;s great love and grace toward us. Yet it is possible for our eyes to fill with tears and for there still to be no real worship simply because we have not come to a genuine awareness of God and a fuller praise of Himself in His nature and ways… True worship occurs only when that part of man, his spirit, which is akin to the divine nature (for God is spirit), actually meets with God and finds itself praising God for His love, wisdom, beauty, truth, holiness, compassion, mercy, grace, power, and all His other attributes.&quot;
:: — James M. Boice: One of the framers and member of the Presbyterian Church.

<text>President of the Republic () was the title of the head of state during the Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939). The office was based on the model of the Weimar Republic, then still in power in Germany, and a compromise between the French and American presidential systems. The &quot;Republican Revolutionary Committee&quot; set up by the Pact of San Sebastián (1930), considered the &quot;central event in the opposition to the monarchy of Alfonso XIII&quot;, and headed by Niceto Alcalá-Zamora, eventually became the first provisional government of the Second Republic, with Alcalá-Zamora named President of the Republic on 11 December 1931.

Spain is one of the democracies (see President of the Government for the full list of countries) where the term &quot;president&quot; does not solely refer to the head of state but to several distinct offices: President of the Republic for some historical heads of state; President of the Government for the head of the executive; President of the Senate for the speaker of the upper parliamentary chamber, and so on. This has led to some confusion in countries where the term &quot;president&quot; refers solely to the head of state, such as the United States; several incidents involved high-profile American politicians calling the Spanish head of government &quot;President&quot;, including George W. Bush in 2001, Jeb Bush in 2003, and Donald Trump in September 2017. With Spain a constitutional monarchy since 1975, the monarch is head of state.

==First Spanish Republic (1873–74)==

Following the abdication of Amadeo I on 10 February 1873, the short-lived First Republic (1873–74) had four heads of state (officially, Presidents of the Executive Power): Estanislao Figueras, Pi i Margall, Nicolás Salmerón, and Emilio Castelar. On the eve of the of 3 January 1874, General Pavia sent for Francisco Serrano y Domínguez take to the leadership. Serrano took the title of president of the executive and he continued at the end of December 1874 when the Bourbons were restored by another .

=== Presidents of the Executive Power of the First Republic ===
==Second Spanish Republic (1931–1939)==
Following the abdication of Alfonso XIII on 14 April 1931, there was no official head of state, meaning that the Prime Minister was, in effect, the highest office in the land. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora assumed the new role of President of the Republic, the effective head of state, after the approval of the new Constitution in December 1931. Manuel Azaña remained as Prime Minister, head of the government, until 12 September 1933.

=== Presidents (Prime Ministers) of the Provisional Government of the Republic ===
===Presidents of the Republic===
With Franco&#x27;s victory imminent, a National Council of Defense was established to negotiate a peace settlement with the Nationalists. By this point, Franco effectively had military control of the whole country.

===Presidents of the National Council of Defense (Republican Zone)===
===Fall of the Republic===
On 27 February 1939, after both France and the United Kingdom had recognised Franco&#x27;s military victory, President Manuel Azaña, exiled in France, resigned. The following week, the so-called Casado Coup against Prime Minister Negrín&#x27;s government led to the creation of the National Defence Council which attempted, unsuccessfully to negotiate terms, with Franco breaking off talks &quot;motu proprio&quot;. Following Franco&#x27;s final offensive at the end of March 1939, the Republic fell.

<text>Benjamin Hoadly (14 November 167617 April 1761) was an English clergyman, who was successively Bishop of Bangor, of Hereford, of Salisbury, and finally of Winchester. He is best known as the initiator of the Bangorian Controversy.

==Life==
He was educated at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge and ordained a priest in 1700. He was rector of St Peter-le-Poer, London, from 1704 to 1724, and of St Leonard&#x27;s, Streatham, from 1710 to 1723. His participation in controversy began at the beginning of his career, when he advocated conformity of the religious rites from the Scottish and English churches for the sake of union. He became a leader of the low church and found favour with the Whig party.

He battled with Francis Atterbury, who was the spokesman for the high church group and Tory leader on the subject of passive obedience and non-resistance (i.e. obedience of divines that would not involve swearing allegiance or changing their eucharistic rites but would also not involve denunciation of the Established Church practices). The House of Commons, dominated by Whigs, recommended him to Queen Anne, and he became rector of Streatham in 1710. When George I succeeded to the throne, he became chaplain to the King and made bishop of Bangor in 1716. He took up the See on the confirmation of his election, at St Mary-le-Bow on 17 March 1716.

In 1717, his sermon on &quot;The Nature of the Kingdom of Christ&quot; provoked the Bangorian controversy. He was then translated three more times, taking up different bishoprics. He maintained that the eucharist was purely a commemorative act without any divine intervention. During his time as bishop, he rarely visited his dioceses and lived, instead, in London, where he was very active in politics.

From later summer 1722 to January 1725 Hoadly published letters on contemporary topics, articulating his Whig principles and defending the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Revolution had created &quot;&quot;that Limited Form of Government&quot; which is our only Security&quot; and such a government secured freedom of expression, without which Britons would suffer &quot;all the &quot;Mischiefs&quot;, of &quot;Darkness&quot; in the &quot;Intellectual&quot; World, of &quot;Baseness&quot; in the &quot;Moral&quot; World, and of &quot;Slavery&quot; in the &quot;Political&quot; World&quot;. Hoadly also criticised the Pretender, who issued a declaration that he would extinguish opposition. Hoadly wrote that he would impose uniformity on all if he ruled: &quot;Not only that he &quot;must&quot; destroy your &quot;Civil&quot; and &quot;Religious&quot; Rights, but that he plainly before-hand has here &quot;told&quot; You, &quot;to your Face&quot;, He will do so&quot;.

William Hogarth (1697–1764) painted his portrait as Bishop of Winchester and &quot;Prelate of the Most Noble Order of the Garter&quot; about 1743, etched by Bernard Baron (1696–1762). Hoadly&#x27;s son Benjamin aided Hogarth with his &quot;The Analysis of Beauty&quot;.

<text>Economic theories of intertemporal consumption seek to explain people&#x27;s preferences in relation to consumption and saving over the course of their lives. The earliest work on the subject was by Irving Fisher and Roy Harrod, who described &#x27;hump saving&#x27;, hypothesizing that savings would be highest in the middle years of a person&#x27;s life as they saved for retirement.

In the 1950s, more well-defined models were built on discounted utility theory and approached the question of inter-temporal consumption as a lifetime income optimization problem. Solving this problem mathematically, assuming that individuals are rational and have access to complete markets, Modigliani &amp; Brumberg (1954), Albert Ando, and Milton Friedman (1957) developed what became known as the life-cycle model. See for details.

The life-cycle model of consumption suggests that consumption is based on average lifetime income instead of income at any given age. First, young people borrow to consume more than their income, next, as their income rises through the years, their consumption rises slowly and they begin to save more. Lastly, during their retirement these individuals live off of their savings. Furthermore this theory implies that consumption is smoothed out relative to a person&#x27;s income which is the reason economists set consumption proportional to potential income rather than actual income.

Attempts to test the life-cycle model against real world data have met with mixed success. In a review of the literature, Courant, Gramlich and Laitner (1984) note &quot;but for all its elegance and rationality, the life-cycle model has not tested out very well&quot;. The main discrepancies between predicted and actual behaviour is that people drastically &#x27;underconsume&#x27; early and late in their lifetime by failing to borrow against future earnings and not saving enough to adequately finance retirement incomes respectively. People also seem to &#x27;overconsume&#x27; during their highest earning years, the elderly do not consume from their assets as would be expected (particularly from their household equity) and also treat windfall gains in a manner inconsistent with the life-cycle model. Specific alterations to the theory have been proposed to help it accommodate the data; a bequest motive, capital market imperfections such as liquidity constraints, a changing individual utility function over time or a particular form of expectation as to future income.

Behavioural economists have proposed an alternate description of intertemporal consumption, the behavioural life cycle hypothesis. They propose that people mentally divide their assets into non-fungible mental accounts – current income, current assets (savings) and future income. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of each of these accounts is different. Drawing upon empirical studies of consumption, superannuation and windfall gains they hypothesize that the MPC is close to one out of current income, close to zero for future income and somewhere in between with respect to current assets. These differing MPCs explain why people &#x27;overconsume&#x27; during their highest earning years, why increasing superannuation contributions does not cause current savings to be reduced (as the life-cycle model implies) and why small windfall gains (which are coded as current income) are consumed at a high rate but a higher proportion of larger gains is saved.

<doc id="1045876" wikidata="Q12069951" url="?curid=1045876" title="Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse">
<text>The Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse is a grade II listed building and is the world&#x27;s largest brick warehouse, with a net floor area of 1.6 million square feet (148,644 square metres). It is adjacent to the Stanley Dock, in Liverpool, England. Standing high, the building was, at the time of its construction in 1901, claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest building in terms of area. The 14 storey building spans across and its construction used 27 million bricks, 30,000 panes of glass and 8,000 tons of steel.

The overall design is by A. G. Lyster, the Dock Engineer, but Arthur Berrington almost certainly played a part. The warehouse was a late addition to the Stanley Dock complex and was built on land reclaimed from the dock. Stanley Dock is accessible from the dock system or by barge from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal which enters under Great Howard Street bridge.

With the decline of trade going through Liverpool, the warehouse fell into disuse in the 1980s and gradually into disrepair. More recently the building has featured in the Stop the Rot conservation campaign by the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; newspaper. Part of the ground floor of the warehouse was used for the Sunday Heritage Market. In 2010, local club promoter Sean Weaver held a warehouse rave on Boxing Day, which saw 2,500 people descend on the building. Acts included DJ Rolando, Kids in Glass Houses&#x27; lead singer Aled Phillips and Hatcha, as well as local DJs from the area.

In 2014, Stanley Dock Properties, under the auspices of the Irish company who had previously transformed Belfast&#x27;s Titanic Quarter, Harcourt Developments, put forward a proposal for the warehouse to be converted into 550 apartments accompanied by businesses, cafes and retail outlets on the ground floor.

Between 2015–2021, Tobacco Warehouse was redeveloped into several hundred apartments as part of a larger development of the whole Stanley Dock site. The plans involved hollowing out the centre of the warehouse to create a garden-filled courtyard and the building welcomed its first residents in 2021.

<doc id="1045884" wikidata="Q3405210" url="?curid=1045884" title="Bangorian Controversy">
<text>The Bangorian Controversy was a theological argument within the Church of England in the early 18th century, with strong political overtones. The origins of the controversy lay in the 1716 posthumous publication of George Hickes&#x27;s &quot;Constitution of the Catholic Church, and the Nature and Consequences of Schism&quot;. In it, Hickes, as Bishop of Thetford, on behalf of the minority non-juror faction that had broken away from the Church of England after the Glorious Revolution, excommunicated all but the non-juror churchmen. Benjamin Hoadly, the Bishop of Bangor, wrote a reply, &quot;Preservative against the Principles and Practices of Non-Jurors&quot;; his own Erastian position was sincerely proposed as the only test of truth.

The controversy itself began very visibly and vocally when Hoadly delivered a sermon on 31 March 1717 to George I of Great Britain on &quot;The Nature of the Kingdom of Christ&quot;. His text was John 18:36, &quot;My kingdom is not of this world&quot; and from that, Hoadly deduced, supposedly at the request of the king himself, that there is no Biblical justification for any church government of any sort. He identified the church with the Kingdom of Heaven. It was therefore not of this world, and Christ had not delegated His authority to any representatives.

==Background==

Two competing visions of government were in play. On the one hand, there was a vision of God appointing the king and the bishops to be leaders, selecting them from all others and imbuing them with special characters, either through grace or in creation. That view held that the king, as the head of the Established Church, was not only a secular leader of a state but also a religious primate. Power and regulation flowed downward from God to the people. That was the aristocratic model that was favoured by the Tory party and had been used to propose the divine right of kings.

The other view was that power flowed up from the people to the leaders, that leaders were no more intrinsically better than those led, and God gives out revelation freely. That Whig view was also the view of the Puritans and the &quot;Independents&quot; (the various Congregational and Baptist churches, Quakers etc.).

George I favoured the Whigs in Parliament and favoured a latitudinarian ecclesiastical policy in general. That was probably not by any desire to give up royal prerogative but to break the power of the aristocracy and the House of Lords. A significant obstacle to all kings of England had been the presence of bishops in the Lords. While a king could create peers, it was much more difficult for him to move bishops into and out of the Lords.

==Sermon and aftermath==
The sermon was immediately published and instantly drew counterattacks. William Law (&quot;Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor&quot;) and Thomas Sherlock (dean of Chichester), in particular, gave vigorous defences of church polity. Hoadly himself wrote &quot;A Reply to the Representations of Convocation&quot; to answer Sherlock, Andrew Snape, provost of Eton, and Francis Hare, then dean of Worcester. The three men, and another opponent, Robert Moss, dean of Ely, were deprived of their royal chaplaincies by the king. Hoadly did not, however, attempt to answer William Law. It has been claimed that in all, over 200 pamphlets linked to the controversy were published by 53 writers. Of those, 74 were published in July 1717.

In May 1717, the Convocation appointed a committee to study the sermon. When the report was ready for synodal sanction against Hoadly, the king dismissed the convocation, which did not meet again for over 130 years.

<text>The Joseph Smith Academy (&quot;JSA&quot;) was an educational complex run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo, Illinois, less than from the Nauvoo Temple. Until recently, the Academy was home to a BYU distance study program focusing on church history. For this reason, the Academy is sometimes referred to as the BYU Nauvoo Center. 

The Academy no longer is functioning and the building was torn down beginning in September 2007. Any new structures built on the land would be located to meet then-LDS church president Gordon B. Hinckley desire to not have any buildings obstruct the view to and from the Nauvoo Temple.

The dormitories at JSA provided housing for local missionaries, visiting youth groups and conferences, CES students on distance learning expedition, and other interests.

The building in which the JSA is housed was purchased from Catholic nuns who had used the facilities to run a girl&#x27;s boarding school. The building had a unique architecture and interior design, with curving hallways, lampshades, &quot;bubblepaper&quot; wallpaper and many other curious and beautiful traits.

The first group of BYU students to live in the JSA came in January 2000, although BYU had sent students to live in the Nauvoo area previously. Portions of &quot;Peace, Love &amp; Gingerbread&quot;, a book about the first semester students lived in the JSA, circulated around the internet for a while but interest was fleeting.

<doc id="1045912" wikidata="Q634983" url="?curid=1045912" title="Miranda (The Tempest)">
<text>Miranda is one of the principal characters of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;. She is the only female character to appear on stage.

Miranda is the daughter of Prospero, another of the main characters of &quot;The Tempest&quot;. She was banished to the Island along with her father at age three, and in the subsequent twelve years has lived with her father and their slave, Caliban, as her only company. She is openly compassionate and unaware of the evils of the world that surrounds her, learning of her father&#x27;s fate only as the play begins.

== Origins ==
There is some speculation that Miranda, along with her husband, Ferdinand, may be intended to represent Elizabeth Stuart and her new spouse, Elector Frederick V, as &quot;The Tempest&quot; was originally performed for the court of Elizabeth&#x27;s father, King James, in celebration of the Wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V of the Palatinate.

== Role in the play ==
&quot;The Tempest&#x27;s&quot; second scene begins with Miranda, begging her father to spare the lives of the men at sea. She&#x27;s fully aware of the powers Prospero possesses and begs him to cease the storm. In an act of bravery she challenges her father&#x27;s wisdom, arguing that: &quot;Had I been any god of power, I would / Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere / It should the good ship so have swallow&#x27;d and / The souls within her.&quot; As the scene progresses it is revealed to her that she is, in fact, the high ranking daughter of the Duke of Milan.

When Prospero&#x27;s servant appears, Miranda is placed into a magically induced sleep. She awakes when she is summoned and it is quickly shown that the two have a contentious relationship, most probably due to Caliban&#x27;s failed attempt to rape her, she refers to him as &quot;a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.&quot; (I, ii).

As the moment with Caliban progresses, Miranda rebukes Caliban for the hatred he expresses towards her father:

Abhorred slave,
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst like
A thing most , I endow&#x27;d thy purposes
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
Though thou didst learn, had that in&#x27;t which
good natures
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
Deservedly confined into this rock,
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

Moments later she encounters Ferdinand for the first time and the two immediately fall in love. Miranda is amazed by the sight of him, questioning whether or not he is a spirit. While Prospero is pleased by the immediate connection the two display, he purposefully takes up an attitude of towards the shipwrecked prince, forbidding a relationship between the two in order that Ferdinand will place a higher value on his daughter&#x27;s affection.

During the encounter Miranda once again stands up to her father, arguing against his harsh treatment of Ferdinand and defending his honour when Prospero refers to him as nothing more than another Caliban.

Miranda&#x27;s next appearance is in the third act. She and Ferdinand take a few moments together to get acquainted and are quickly married. She insists on doing the work that her father has assigned him, and freely admits her naivety to him before swearing her love for him. The scene ends with their marriage, Miranda swearing she will be his servant if Ferdinand will not take her as his wife.

Later on, she and her new husband enjoy a masque put on by her father in celebration of their nuptials. The celebration is interrupted by Prospero&#x27;s sudden remembrance of Caliban&#x27;s plot against him, after which Miranda displays a strong concern for her father&#x27;s well-being.

Her last appearance is in the play&#x27;s final scene. After Prospero reveals himself to the assembled crowd he reveals the happy couple engaged in a game of chess. Miranda is teasing Ferdinand for cheating but admits that even if he is dishonest, she&#x27;s more than happy to believe it for the love she bears for him.

When she is finally introduced to the assembled crowd she reacts with wonder, proclaiming the play&#x27;s most famous lines:
O wonder!
How many goodly creatures are there here!
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
That has such people in&#x27;t.

== Analysis ==
=== Feminine Virtue Personified ===
&quot;The Tempest&quot; interprets Miranda as a living representation of female virtue. Miranda is typically viewed as having believed herself to be subordinate towards her father. She is loving, kind, and compassionate as well as obedient to her father and is described as &quot;perfect and peerless, created of every creature&#x27;s best&quot;. She is, furthermore, the only female character within a cast of strong male figures, and much of her interaction on stage is dominated by the male figures around her. Miranda&#x27;s behaviour is typically seen as completely dictated by Prospero, from her interactions with Caliban to her ultimate decision to marry Ferdinand. The traits that make her the of femininity are her innocence and vulnerability, and these traits allow her to be readily manipulated first by her father then Ferdinand.

However, some critics argue that those same &quot;feminine&quot; traits enable her to be a strong female presence with important effects on the play&#x27;s outcome. Throughout the course of the play, Miranda acts as a foil to Prospero&#x27;s more violent instincts and serves as a sounding board to move the play&#x27;s plot further. She is also a central figure in her father&#x27;s revenge, enabling Prospero to gain political through her marriage to the Prince of Naples, Ferdinand. Furthermore, while Miranda is very much subservient to Prospero&#x27;s power, some critics argue that her obedience is a conscious choice. Miranda proves herself willing to challenge Prospero&#x27;s power, first by calling into question his treatment of the shipwrecked sailors and then defying his commandment to have nothing to do with Prince Ferdinand.
Her decision to pursue a relationship with Ferdinand is also interpreted by critics as an indication that her marriage to him is more than a simple political match. Miranda makes a very clear decision to seek out Ferdinand and offer her assistance, all the while worrying that her father will discover them. She is also the one to abandon traditional concepts of Elizabethan modesty by ardently stating her love for Ferdinand, proclaiming that &quot;I am your wife, if you will marry me; / If not, I&#x27;ll die your maid&quot;.

Critics also argue that Miranda&#x27;s feminine presence is essential to the central theme of the play. Miranda&#x27;s influence is what dulls the worst of her father&#x27;s anger; Prospero cites her as being his reason for living after their initial banishment and he informs her that everything he does is &quot;in care&quot; of her. Michael Neill argues that Miranda&#x27;s function on the Island is that of a Christ-figure—that she is the indicator of a given character&#x27;s moral status within the social hierarchy of the island and that she also serves to protect the ethical code of the Island&#x27;s inhabitants and visitors. Caliban, whom she rejects, is shown to be a monstrous figure, while Ferdinand—whom she embraces—is saved by her presence, her sympathy lightening the &quot;baseness&quot; of his given task. Critic Melissa Sanchez analyses Miranda in a similar light, discussing her as a representation of an &quot;angelic—but passive—soul &quot;caught in the conflict between enlightenment and base desire (represented by Prospero and Caliban).

Critic Lorie Leininger argues that Miranda fits into the colonialist interpretation of &quot;The Tempest&quot; in that Prospero&#x27;s use of Miranda as an unwitting player in his political revenge is expressive of the play&#x27;s sexist attitude towards women. Leininger equates that the sexist attitudes displayed towards Miranda are equitable to the of racism shown in the treatment of Caliban. She states that Prospero&#x27;s treatment of Miranda is in essence the same as his treatment of Caliban, describing his attitude towards both as indicative of their within the social hierarchy of the Island.

Leininger also argues that Miranda&#x27;s sexualisation is a weapon used against her by her father, stating that Prospero uses Caliban&#x27;s attempted assault and Ferdinand&#x27;s romantic overtures to her, simplifying her into a personification of chastity. In Leininger&#x27;s analysis, Caliban is treated in a similar fashion, forced into the role of an uncivilised savage without heed for his individual needs and desires—much in the same way that Miranda is expected to marry Ferdinand and reject Caliban&#x27;s advances simply because her father wishes it.

Critic Jessica Slights creates claims that although many declare that Miranda only reflects the image of an obedient and subservient woman; she argues Miranda&#x27;s character is independent. Miranda&#x27;s upbringing shapes her character and the view of the world around her. She is not confined to social constructs as she did not grow up within a conventional society. This leads Miranda to view the world without preconceived ideas. Prospero is the main guardian in her life, but she developed personality traits such as kind-heartedness that are, as many describe, distinct in comparison to Prospero’s. In addition, she challenged the rules of traditional courtship when she pursued Ferdinand. What I desire to give; and much less take

What I shall die to want. But this is trifling,

And all the more it seeks to hide itself,

The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning,

And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!

I am your wife, if you will marry me;

If not, I’ll die your maid. To be your fellow

You may deny me, but I’ll be your servant,

Whether you will or no.

Miranda&#x27;s first interaction with Ferdinand was a revelation for her view on men besides Prospero. Having another person in her life shifted her attention away from Prospero, as she became aware of what she wanted out her life. This moment separates her past life to the life Miranda expects for the future. This was an opportunity that let her too not only to express her sexuality, but to also reclaim her independence.

=== Colonialism ===
While &quot;The Tempest&quot; is frequently analysed from postcolonial angles as a reaction to European colonialism in the early modern era, Miranda does not make an appearance in the majority of such analyses. As the play&#x27;s only female character, Miranda functions mostly as a representation of women instead of a representation of a colonised group. Lorie Leininger, discussed in the previous section, argues that Miranda is part of a group subjugated by colonialism due to her gender, but as far as direct connections to European colonisation overseas, Miranda does not connect directly to the majority of postcolonial analyses.

However, Miranda can be interpreted as an allegory for the softer side of colonialism, portraying the more &quot;missionary&quot; aspect of colonisation attempts, in that she tries to educate Caliban instead of treating him as a sub-human citizen like her father seems keen to. She also displays far more sympathy to the shipwrecked Prince Ferdinand than her father does, and is eager to make his stay on the island as comfortable as possible. Her attitude towards the discovered peoples as well as the newly discovered castaway sharply contrasts her father&#x27;s inclination to conquer and destroy, painting her not only as a compassionate figure but as one sympathetic to the colonial plight.

== Controversial lines ==
In Act I, Scene II, the lines spoken by Miranda to Caliban rebuking him for his ill-treatment of Prospero are frequently reassigned to Prospero. Editors and critics of the play felt that the speech was probably wrongly attributed to her either as a printing error or because actors preferred that no character would remain silent too long on stage.

Critics also argue that the language used by Miranda in this speech is out of character for her, given her lack of knowledge of the world that makes Caliban&#x27;s behaviour so shocking, as well as the fact that her style of speaking strongly resembles Prospero&#x27;s mannerisms. Furthermore, the use of anger and strong language removes the image of youth and innocence Shakespeare cultivates of Miranda and does not seem to be in keeping with her behaviour for the rest of the play.

However, others feel that Miranda&#x27;s speech here is correctly attributed. As the play progresses, Caliban refers to Miranda as his &quot;mistress&quot;, saying that it was Miranda who explained to him what the moon and stars are.

Furthermore, some critics do acknowledge that while the language in this particular speech is stronger than expected for Miranda, it is far weaker than Prospero&#x27;s form of address would be given the situation.

== In astronomy ==
Miranda (moon), one of the moons of Uranus is named after her, in keeping with other Uranian moons named after characters from Shakespeare and Pope.

== In popular culture ==
Her lines spoken at the end of Act V, Scene I are the inspiration for the title of the novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

Clare Savage, a protagonist of Michelle Cliff&#x27;s novel &quot;No Telephone to Heaven&quot;, is frequently seen to be a modernised Miranda. Miranda is featured in the 2019 novella &quot;Miranda in Milan&quot;, which imagines the events after &quot;The Tempest&quot;.

<text>Max Heindel (born Carl Louis von Grasshoff, July 23, 1865 – January 6, 1919) was an American Christian occultist, astrologer, and mystic.

== Early life ==

Carl Louis von Grasshoff was born in Aarhus, Denmark, into the noble family von Grasshoff, which was connected to the German Court during the lifetime of Prince Bismarck. His father, Francois L. von Grasshoff, migrated to Copenhagen as a young man and married a Danish woman of noble birth. They had two sons and one daughter. Their older son was Carl Louis von Grasshoff, who would later adopt the pen name of Max Heindel. When he was six years old, his father died, leaving his mother with three small children in difficult circumstances. Max Heindel&#x27;s infancy was thus lived in genteel poverty. His mother&#x27;s small income was dedicated to private tutors for her sons and daughter, so that they might eventually take their place in society as members of the noble classes.

Heindel left home at the age of sixteen to learn engineering at the ship-yards of Glasgow, Scotland. As Chief Engineer of a trading steamer, he traveled extensively, and eventually found himself working on one of the large passenger steamers of the Cunard Line operating between America and Europe. From 1895 to 1901, he was a consulting engineer in New York City. During this time, he married and had a son and two daughters. His wife died in 1905.

== Career ==

In 1903, Max Heindel moved to Los Angeles, California, seeking work. After attending lectures by the theosophist C.W. Leadbeater, he joined the Theosophical Society of Los Angeles, of which he became vice-president in 1904 and 1905. He also became a vegetarian, and began the study of astrology, which he felt gave him the key to unlocking the mysteries of man&#x27;s inner nature. He met his future wife Augusta Foss around this time. However, overwork and privation brought him severe heart trouble in 1905, and for months he lay at the point of death. Upon his recovery he said he was more keenly aware of the needs of humanity. He said that he spent much of the time during this illness out of his body, consciously working and seeking for the truth as he might find it on the invisible planes.

From 1906 to 1907 he started a lecture tour, in order to spread his occult knowledge. He began in San Francisco and then went to Seattle. After a course of lectures in that city he was again forced to spend some time in a hospital with valvular heart trouble. Upon his recovery, still undaunted, he once more took up his work of lecturing in the northwestern part of the United States.
In the fall of 1907, during a most successful period of lectures in Minnesota, he travelled to Berlin (Germany) with his friend Dr. Alma Von Brandis, who had been for months trying to persuade him, in order to hear a cycle of lectures by Rudolf Steiner. During his short stay in Germany, he developed a sincere admiration of Steiner, to which &quot;esteemed teacher and valued friend&quot; he dedicated his magnum opus. He sat in on several lectures and had one or two interviews with Steiner and he could learn about occult truth from the founder of later Anthroposophy, but at the same time he understood that this teacher could not help him to advance along the path of spiritual development. 

Heindel reported that, with his mind already made up to return, feeling that he had given up his work in America in vain to take this trip, he was visited by the vital body of a spiritual being who identified himself as an Elder Brother of the Rosicrucian Order, an Order in the inner worlds formed in the year 1313 and having no direct connection to physical organizations which call themselves by this name. Heindel claimed that the Elder Brother gave him information which was concise and logical and beyond anything he was capable of writing. Later, he found out that during a previous visit of the Elder Brother, he was put to a test to determine his worthiness to be messenger of the Western Wisdom Teachings. He recounts that only then he was given instruction how to reach the etheric Temple of the Rose Cross, near the German/Bohemian border, and how at this Temple he was in direct communication with and under the personal instructions of the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross. The Rosicrucian Order is described as being composed of twelve Elder Brothers, gathered around a thirteenth who is the invisible Head. These great Adepts, belonging to human evolution but having already advanced far beyond the cycle of rebirth, are reported as being among those exalted Beings who guide mankind&#x27;s evolution. Further, some help him manifest without necessarily being under any compulsion to do so.

=== Heindel–Steiner connection ===
Current research on the connection between the two seers Max Heindel and Rudolf Steiner describes that &quot;he [Heindel] felt that what Steiner was doing was not appropriate for America where pragmatism and clear linear thinking is predominant&quot; and &quot;that he did not find what he was looking for there (a Western oriented spirituality that was accessible to the general public)&quot;. It is also described that Heindel&#x27;s magnum opus [see following section] having a &quot;more far-reaching body of Teachings&quot; contains &quot;information not otherwise available in the public domain or available without supersensible perception of an advanced degree&quot;.

=== Magnum opus ===

Heindel returned to America in the summer of 1908 where he at once started to formulate the Rosicrucian teachings, the Western Wisdom Teachings, which he had received from the Elder Brothers, published as a book entitled &quot;The Rosicrucian Cosmo-Conception&quot; in 1909. It is a reference work in the Christian mysticism practice and in the Occult study literature, containing the fundamentals of Esoteric Christianity from a Rosicrucian perspective. The &quot;Cosmo&quot; contains a comprehensive outline of the evolutionary processes of man and the universe, correlating the science of his day with religion. Part I is a treatise on the Visible and the Invisible Worlds, Man and the Method of Evolution, Rebirth and the Law of Cause and Effect. Part II takes up the scheme of Evolution in general and the Evolution of the Solar System and the Earth in particular. Part III treats of Christ and His Mission, Future Development of Man and Initiation, Esoteric Training and a Safe Method of Acquiring Firsthand Knowledge. The first edition was printed in 1909 and has changed little since then.

=== Esoteric school ===
From 1909 to 1919, suffering a severe heart condition and with an adverse financial situation, but with an indomitable will and great energy, Max Heindel was able to accomplish the great work for the Brothers of the Rose Cross. With the help, support and inspiration of his wife Augusta Foss, to whom in August 1910 he was joined in marriage, he gave successful teaching lectures; he sent correspondence lessons to the students, who formed groups in many of the larger cities; he wrote volumes which are translated into many languages all over the world; he founded &quot;The Rosicrucian Fellowship&quot; in 1909/11 at Mount Ecclesia, Oceanside (California); he published the Christian Esoteric magazine Rays from the Rose Cross in 1913 and, above all, he launched the Fellowship&#x27;s Spiritual Healing service.

It is described that, at his death, his body dropped slowly as if loving hands were holding him and laying him down gently; as he looked up, smiling into Mrs. Heindel&#x27;s face, he spoke his last words: &quot;I am all right dear.&quot;

Last, it is worthy of mention that the work prepared by Max Heindel has since been continued through students of the Western Wisdom Teachings who, as Invisible Helpers of mankind, assist the Elder Brothers of the Rose Cross to perform the Spiritual Healing around the world. This is the special work in which the Rosicrucian Order is interested and is provided according to the commands of Christ, namely, &quot;Preach the gospel and heal the sick.&quot;

==Death==
Heindel died on January 6, 1919, in Oceanside, California, United States.

<doc id="1045918" wikidata="Q6311294" url="?curid=1045918" title="Jumping Frenchmen of Maine">
<text>The Jumping Frenchmen of Maine were a group of 19th-century lumberjacks who exhibited a rare disorder of unknown origin. The syndrome entails an exaggerated startle reflex which may be described as an uncontrollable &quot;jump.&quot; Individuals with this condition could exhibit sudden movements in all parts of the body. Jumping Frenchmen syndrome shares some symptoms with other startle disorders.

Individuals with this condition were first found in the Moosehead Lake region of Maine, and were first described by George Miller Beard in 1878.

==Signs and symptoms==
George Miller Beard recorded individuals who would obey any command given suddenly, even if it meant striking a loved one; the Jumping Frenchmen seemed to react abnormally to sudden stimuli. The more common and less intense symptoms consisted of jumping, yelling, and hitting. These individuals exhibited outrageous bursts, and many described themselves as ticklish and shy. Other cases involved echolalia (repeating vocalizations made by another person) and echopraxia (repeating movements made by another person). Beard noted that the men were &quot;suggestible&quot; and that they &quot;could not help repeating the word or sounds that came from the person that ordered them any more than they could help striking, dropping, throwing, jumping, or starting.&quot;

==Causes==
The cause of Jumping Frenchmen syndrome is unknown. One theory is that it is a genetic condition. An observation of 50 cases found the disorder to be remotely located and concentrated in the northern regions of Maine. Fourteen of these cases were found in four families. Another set of cases were found in a single family where the father, his two sons, and his two grandchildren exhibited &quot;jumping&quot; behavior.

It may also be a culture-bound syndrome, mass psychogenic illness, or a formed habit. These French &quot;jumpers&quot; lived in a very remote region and most were lumberjacks. This type of small community would allow for a majority to adapt to this sort of reaction. Also, instances of many being shy may imply that the &quot;jumper&quot; was positively reinforced by the sudden attention as the entertainment for a group.

In 1885, Georges Gilles de la Tourette included Jumping Frenchmen syndrome in the typology of &quot;convulsive tic illness&quot;; studies of the condition in the 1980s cast doubt on whether the phenomenon was in fact a physical condition similar to Tourette syndrome. Documentation of direct observation of &quot;Jumping Frenchmen&quot; has been scarce, and while video evidence was recorded by several researchers that showed the condition to be real, MH and JM Saint-Hilaire concluded from studying eight affected people that it was brought on by conditions at their lumber camps and was psychological, not neurological.

==Differential diagnosis==
Jumping Frenchmen of Maine syndrome must be distinguished from other conditions involving the startle reflex or tics.

Tourette syndrome is characterized by multiple physical (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. There are many overlaps when compared clinically, but the abnormal &quot;jumping&quot; response is always provoked, unlike the involuntary tics in Tourette syndrome.

===Similar conditions===
* Latah is a disorder found in southeast Asia in which one&#x27;s startle response is similar to a state of trance with repetitive speech or movements. 
* Meryachenie is a disorder found in Siberia that also displays an action similar to &quot;jumping.&quot; 
* Neurasthenia is a disorder with a startle response during periods of great fatigue. 
* Hyperekplexia is a rare autosomal dominant neurological disease. The symptoms begin in infancy with hypertonia, an abnormal muscle tension that decreases flexibility, and an exaggerated startle in all ages of life.

==History==
Beard had a unique interest in unusual disorders and took the opportunity to observe the epidemic in Maine. He recorded &quot;startle, jumping, and tic-like behaviors&quot; among the French Canadians and lumberjacks who lived near Moosehead Lake in northern Maine. He published his descriptions of the Jumping Frenchmen in 1880, and he believed the condition was hereditary. History of Medicine professor Howard I. Kushner calls Beard&#x27;s description &quot;the most influential and detailed study&quot; of these behaviors.

According to Kushner, the French physician Jean-Martin Charcot chose his resident, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, to investigate the &quot;relationship between tic disorders and jumping and startle behaviors reported in Malaysia, Siberia, and Maine&quot;; Gilles de la Tourette translated Beard&#x27;s descriptions and published them one year after Beard&#x27;s papers. In 1885, Tourette published &quot;Study of a Nervous Affliction&quot; where he included the startle disorders in the typology of what he called &quot;convulsive tic illness&quot;, that included what later came to be known as Tourette syndrome. Kushner argues that none of the patients studied by Tourette supported this assertion, and says that &quot;many of his contemporaries refuted Gilles de la Tourette&#x27;s typology.&quot;

<text>Dalton McCarthy (October 10, 1836 – May 11, 1898), or D&#x27;Alton McCarthy, was a Canadian lawyer and parliamentarian. He was the leader of the &quot;Orange&quot; or Protestant Irish Canadians, and fiercely fought against Irish Catholics as well as the French Catholics. He especially crusaded for the abolition of the French language in schools in Manitoba and Ontario.

McCarthy originally served in the House of Commons of Canada as a Conservative. An Irish-born Protestant, McCarthy was stridently anti-Catholic and anti-French Canadian. His contemporaries respected his organizational skills and perceived him as a potential Conservative leader after Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald vacated the leadership. However, he broke with the Conservatives in the 1890s, running and being re-elected as an Independent Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1891 Canadian federal election. He appears to have been associated with the Equal Rights Party which ran in that election but did not run as their candidate.

His firm, Boulton &amp; McCarthy in Barrie, was the first incarnation of what is now Canada&#x27;s largest law firm, McCarthy Tétrault. He appeared in the Supreme Court of Canada in the significant constitutional case of &quot;Citizens Insurance Co of Canada v Parsons&quot;, arguing successfully on behalf of two individuals claiming compensation under fire insurance policies. The case helped establish the scope of provincial jurisdiction in contract matters. He also defended Emily Stowe in the 1879 abortion trial of Emily Stowe.

McCarthy was a founder of the &quot;Imperial Federation League&quot;, which proposed uniting the United Kingdom and the emerging dominions under a central Cabinet government responsible to an Imperial Parliament elected from throughout the Empire. McCarthy organized his own slate of McCarthyite candidates for the 1896 election, but he was the only one elected.

Following the 1896 election, McCarthy forged an alliance with the Liberal Party, even though its leader Wilfrid Laurier was a French Canadian Catholic. He might have been appointed to cabinet had he not died following a carriage accident in 1898.

McCarthy was a key figure in the Manitoba Schools Question, and a major proponent in pushing English only in legislatures, courts, and schools of Western Canada.

<doc id="1045945" wikidata="Q157393" url="?curid=1045945" title="Paulownia tomentosa">
<text>Paulownia tomentosa, common names princess tree, empress tree, or foxglove-tree, is a deciduous hardwood tree in the family Paulowniaceae, native to central and eastern China and the Korean Peninsula. It is an extremely fast-growing tree with seeds that disperse readily and is considered an invasive exotic species in North America that has undergone naturalisation in large areas of the Eastern US, even though it might be able to successfully get established through seeds only under ideal conditions. &quot;P. tomentosa&quot; has also been introduced to Western and Central Europe, and is establishing itself as a naturalised species there as well.

==Etymology==

The generic name &quot;Paulownia&quot; honours Anna Pavlovna of Russia, who was Queen Consort of the Netherlands from 1840 to 1849. The specific epithet &quot;tomentosa&quot; is a Latin word meaning &#x27;covered in hairs&#x27;.

==Description==
This tree grows tall, with large heart-shaped to five-lobed leaves across, arranged in opposite pairs on the stem. On young growth, the leaves may be in whorls of three and be much bigger than the leaves on more mature growth. The leaves can be mistaken for those of the catalpa.

The very fragrant flowers, large and violet-blue in colour are produced before the leaves in early spring, on panicles long, with a tubular purple corolla long resembling a foxglove flower. The fruit is a dry egg-shaped capsule long, containing numerous tiny seeds. The seeds are winged and disperse by wind and water. Pollarded trees do not produce flowers, as these form only on mature wood.

&quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; requires full sun for proper growth. It is tolerant of pollution and can tolerate many soil types. It can also grow from small cracks in pavements and walls. &quot;Paulownia&quot; can survive wildfires because the roots can regenerate new, very fast-growing stems.

&quot;P. tomentosa&quot; is drought-resistant and thrives in barren soil, particularly suitable for cold and arid regions. Its main trunk is short, and its growth rate is relatively slow after it reaches maturity.

==Range==

===Native range===
&quot;P. tomentosa&quot; is native to much of central and eastern China and to the Korean peninsula; the Flora of China considers the latter as non-native. In China, it occurs in the following provinces: Anhui, Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan.
===Introduced range===
====Europe====
In August 2021 the EPPO added &quot;P. tomentosa&quot; to its Alert List, not due to any particular known problem within Europe, but as a step to begin assessing whether it should be regarded as a problematic invader.
* Austria, Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, France (including Corsica), Germany, Hungary, Italy (including Sardinia and Sicily), Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom

====Africa====
* South Africa

====North America====
=====United States=====
* Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia

====Oceania====
* New Zealand

====Asian introduced range====
* Japan

==Uses==
&quot;Paulownia tomentosa&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

Because of its tolerance and flexibility, &quot;Paulownia&quot; functions ecologically as a pioneer plant. Its nitrogen-rich leaves provide good fodder and its roots prevent soil erosion. Eventually, &quot;Paulownia&quot; is succeeded by taller trees that shade it and in whose shade it cannot thrive.

The characteristic large size of the young growth is exploited by gardeners: by pollarding the tree and ensuring there is vigorous new growth every year, massive leaves are produced (up to across). These are popular in the modern style of gardening which uses large-foliaged and &quot;architectural&quot; plants.

The soft, lightweight seeds were commonly used as a packing material by Chinese porcelain exporters in the 19th century, before the development of polystyrene packaging. Packing cases would often leak or burst open in transit and scatter the seeds along rail tracks. The magnitude of the numbers of seeds used for packaging, together with seeds deliberately planted for ornament, has allowed the species to be viewed as an invasive species in areas where the climate is suitable for its growth, notably Japan and the eastern United States.

In Japan, it is customary to plant seeds of the tree when a couple has a daughter; it is said that by the time the daughter is in her older teens or at the peak of adulthood when she is ready to marry, the tree by this time has also grown to maturity, which is then felled and made into a tansu dresser as a wedding gift.
The timber is used in making instruments, as well.

&quot;P. tomentosa&quot; has been suggested as a plant to use in carbon capture projects. &quot;P. tomentosa&quot; has large leaves that readily absorb pollutants, and also has value in timber and aesthetics, adding to interest surrounding its use in carbon capture.

Inaccurate citation practices have led to circulating claims that &quot;P. tomentosa&quot; performs C4 carbon fixation. However, this species does not fulfill the experimental criteria necessary to demonstrate C4 photosynthesis.

==Composition==
Some geranyl flavonoids can be found in &quot;P. tomentosa&quot;. Verbascoside can also be produced in hairy roots cultures of &quot;P. tomentosa&quot;.

<doc id="1045951" wikidata="Q2917079" url="?curid=1045951" title="Joy of Cooking">
<text>Joy of Cooking, often known as &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot;, is one of the United States&#x27; most-published cookbooks. It has been in print continuously since 1936 and has sold more than 20 million copies. It was published privately during 1931 by Irma S. Rombauer (1877–1962), a homemaker in St. Louis, Missouri, after her husband&#x27;s suicide the previous year. Rombauer had 3,000 copies printed by A.C. Clayton, a company which had printed labels for fancy St. Louis shoe companies and for Listerine mouthwash, but never a book. Beginning in 1936, the book was published by a commercial printing house, the Bobbs-Merrill Company. With nine editions, &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; is considered the most popular American cookbook.

== Background ==
Born to German immigrants in 1877, Irma Starkloff was born and grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. She married Edgar Rombauer, a lawyer, in 1899. Edgar committed suicide in 1930 after a severe bout of depression, widowing Irma at age 52 and leaving her with $6,000 in savings.

Rombauer&#x27;s children, Marion Rombauer Becker and Edgar Roderick (&quot;Put&quot;) Rombauer, Jr., encouraged her to compile her recipes and thoughts on cooking to help her cope with her loss. Rombauer spent much of the summer of 1930 in Michigan, creating the first drafts that would later become &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;. With the help of her late husband&#x27;s secretary, Mazie Whyte, Rombauer began writing and editing recipes and commentaries while searching for more recipes in St. Louis. During the autumn of 1930, Rombauer went to the A.C. Clayton Printing Company, a printer for the St. Louis shoe manufacturers. She paid them $3,000 to print 3,000 copies of &quot;The Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat&quot; in November 1931.

== Editions ==

=== First edition (1931) ===
In 1931 Rombauer self-published &quot;The Joy of Cooking: A Compilation of Reliable Recipes with a Casual Culinary Chat&quot; with more than 500 tested recipes and related commentaries.

The book was illustrated by Rombauer&#x27;s daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, who directed the art department at John Burroughs School. Working weekends during the winter of 1930–31, Marion designed the cover, which depicted Saint Martha of Bethany, the patron saint of cooking, slaying a dragon. She also produced silhouette cutouts to illustrate chapter headings. By 1932, a majority of the 3,000 copies printed by A.C. Clayton were sold. Rombauer began to look for a new publisher in 1932.

=== Second edition (1936) ===
After searching for a publisher and being rejected many times, the Bobbs-Merrill Company published an expanded (640 page) second edition on May 1, 1936. The company had limited experience with publishing cookbooks, and Irma Rombauer, similarly inexperienced in dealing with publishers, performed the negotiations herself without an agent or lawyer. The resulting contract, in which Bobbs-Merrill was granted the copyright not only for the 1936 edition but also for the original 1931 version, resulted in many years of conflict between the author and the publisher.

The 1936 edition differed from other commercial cookbooks of the era by its retention of the author&#x27;s folksy comments and anecdotes, and its layout of the recipes. Instead of listing the ingredients for a dish at the top with preparation directions following, the recipes in &quot;Joy&quot; (1936) were presented by narratives, with the ingredients indicated as the need for them occurred, with each placed in boldface on a new indented line — thus preserving a conversational style throughout the recipe. This method came to be known as the &quot;action method&quot;. These innovations, along with an aggressive marketing effort by Bobbs-Merrill, resulted in good sales. &quot;Joy&quot; reached the best-seller list in St. Louis and promoted as &quot;the famous private cookbook&quot; in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. By the end of 1942, the second edition had had six printings, and 52,151 copies had been sold.

=== Third edition (1943/1946) ===

In 1939, Rombauer published &quot;Streamlined Cooking&quot;, a collection of recipes that could be prepared in less than 30 minutes, with an emphasis on use of canned and frozen foods. This book was not a commercial success, but many of the recipes it contained became part of a new edition of &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; published during 1943. This edition also included material intended to help readers deal with wartime rationing restrictions, including alternatives to butter in some recipes. Sales of this edition were phenomenal: from 1943 through 1946 a total of 617,782 copies were sold, surpassing sales of &quot;Joy of Cooking&#x27;s&quot; principal competitor, Fannie Farmer&#x27;s &quot;Boston Cooking-School Cook Book&quot;.

During 1946, a minor revision of the 1943 edition was published. While substantially the same as its predecessor, the 1946 revision omitted the material related to wartime rationing and incorporated additional recipes from &quot;Streamlined Cooking&quot;.

=== Fourth edition (1951) ===

Irma Rombauer was 69 years old when the 1946 edition of &quot;Joy&quot; was published, and her health was beginning to decline. She was concerned about the future of her book, since Bobbs-Merrill (which owned the copyright for the original publication) might have selected an author of their own choosing for future editions once Rombauer was unable to continue. To ensure that the book remained a family project, Rombauer negotiated with the publisher a clause in her contract naming her daughter, Marion Rombauer Becker, as her sole successor in any future revision.

Relations between Rombauer and Bobbs-Merrill, never cordial, worsened during the late 1940s, and in the fracas Marion Becker gradually assumed increasing responsibility, at first regarding the book&#x27;s design, and eventually its content. Partly for legal reasons, the 1951 edition was published with Marion Rombauer Becker listed as co-author, and she received 40% of the royalties. The authors strongly resisted the publisher&#x27;s wish to illustrate the book with photographs and instead embellished the book with simple, functional line drawings by Ginnie Hofmann, a friend of Becker&#x27;s.

Becker was a passionate advocate of healthy eating, and the 1951 edition was marked by an increased emphasis of such topics as whole grains and fresh produce. Many of the old &quot;can-opener&quot; recipes from &quot;Streamlined Cooking&quot; were eliminated. This edition also was the first to introduce the use of the blender and other modern household items into its recipes. The number of recipes had increased to more than 4,000.

Because of the time taken by the protracted legal arguments, final editing of the 1951 edition was done hastily. The same edition was reprinted in 1952 with some errors corrected, and again during 1953 with a revised index.

=== Fifth edition (1962/1963/1964) ===
In 1962, the year of Irma Rombauer&#x27;s death, a revised edition of &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; was published. This edition was released without Marion Becker&#x27;s consent. Subsequent releases of the book during 1963 and 1964 were essentially massive corrections, and Becker arranged for the publisher to exchange copies of the 1962 edition for later corrected versions upon request.

The foreword of the 1962 edition explains that Becker&#x27;s favorite recipes include &quot;Cockaigne&quot; in the name, (e.g., &quot;Fruit Cake Cockaigne&quot;), after the name of her country home in Anderson Township, near Cincinnati.

This edition was also published in paperback format (most notably, a two-volume mass market paperback edition); it is still widely available in used bookstores. The 1962 edition was also released as a single-volume comb-ring bound paperback mass-market edition starting in November 1973 and continuing into the early 1990s.

=== Sixth edition (1975) ===
The 1975 edition was the last to be edited by Becker and remains the most popular, with more than 6 million copies sold. More than 1,000 pages long, and with over 4,300 recipes, it became a standard in kitchens throughout the country. The book included sections concerning backpacking, hiking, and substitutions, and though many sections may seem antiquated to contemporary fashion, many home cooks still use it.

=== Seventh edition (1997) ===
After the 1975 edition, the project was unchanged for about 20 years. During the mid-1990s, publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, which owns the &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;&#x27;s copyrights, hired cookbook editor Maria Guarnaschelli, formerly of William Morrow, and editor of works by Jeff Smith and others. Guarnaschelli, supervised by Rombauer&#x27;s grandson Ethan Becker, managed the creation of the 1997 edition, published by Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons division. The new edition kept the concise style of its predecessors, but it eliminated the conversational first-person narration. Much of the edition was ghostwritten by teams of expert chefs instead of the single dedicated amateur Irma Rombauer had been when she created the book. The 1997 version is fairly comprehensive; however, it no longer contains much information about ingredients or frozen desserts.

Upon its publication during January 1997, the edition was titled &quot;The All-New, All-Purpose Joy of Cooking&quot;; during November of that same year, it was reissued with the title &quot;The 1997 Joy of Cooking&quot;.

=== Other special editions and printings ===
In 1995, a hardbound edition illustrated by Ginnie Hofmann and Ikki Matsumoto was released.

In 1998, a reproduction, described as &quot;A Facsimile of the First Edition&quot;, was released.

=== Eighth edition (2006): 75th anniversary edition ===
In 2006, Scribner published a 75th anniversary edition, containing 4,500 recipes, that reproduced much of Rombauer&#x27;s original style. The new version removes some of the professionalism of the 1997 edition and returns many simpler recipes and recipes assisted by ready-made products such as cream of mushroom soup and store-bought wontons. The 2006 edition also reinstates the cocktail section and the frozen desserts section, and restores much of the information that was omitted for the 1997 edition.

The new version includes a new index section named &quot;Joy Classics&quot; that contains 35 recipes from 1931 to 1975 and a new nutrition section. It was still edited and written by the Rombauer-Becker family.

=== Ninth edition (2019) ===
600 new recipes were added to this edition. Irma&#x27;s great grandson, John Becker, and his wife Megan Scott, were responsible for the updates.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; became a bestseller originally due to its readability for the middle classes and Rombauer&#x27;s unique style. Her recipes were designed specifically for middle-class people doing most of their own cooking for their family. She specifically tested and practiced the recipes to ensure they could be produced easily in a relatively brief period of time without much complication. Once she combined her witty comments on the cooking and serving with the action method, her cookbook became readily readable by the average cook in America. Moreover, Rombauer paired the conversational style of the recipes with casual discussions of etiquette and hosting. Her methods were distinct from the other cookbooks of the time, which featured many complex recipes, while her style was simple and conversational. By providing an interesting and easy to read cookbook for the middle class, &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; became the main reference book for many mid-century American cooks.

== Legacy ==
The &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot; is considered the most popular American cookbook.

Julia Child learned to cook from &quot;The Joy of Cooking&quot; and &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine. She enjoyed &quot;Mrs. Joy&#x27;s Book&quot; and believed it taught her the basic principles of cooking.

The book popularized the title formula &quot;The Joy of...&quot; used to indicate an accessible, popular overview of a topic, such as &quot;The Joy of Painting&quot; (1983), &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; (1972), &quot;The Joy of Art&quot; (2020), &quot;The Joy of X: A Guided Tour of Mathematics&quot; (2012), &quot;The Joy of Living&quot; (2007), and even &quot;The Joy of Accounting&quot; (2020).

<doc id="1045971" wikidata="Q622321" url="?curid=1045971" title="Football Association of Hong Kong, China">
<text>The Football Association of Hong Kong, China Limited (HKFA; ) is the governing body of association football in Hong Kong, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Its current chairman is Eric Fok.

== History ==
The HKFA was established in 1914. It is one of the oldest football federations in Asia and is responsible for organising various football competitions including professional and amateur leagues, football development and promoting football in Hong Kong.

In 1954, HKFA joined FIFA, and was also one of twelve founding associations of the Asian Football Confederation. Hong Kong played an important role in the early development of Asian football, and was given the honour of hosting the first Asian Cup competition in 1956, in which Hong Kong finished third in the tournament.

Hong Kong fields a separate FIFA-recognised representative team instead of the China PR national team.

HKFA is also responsible for operating the Hong Kong national football team (), which represents Hong Kong and competes in international football events.

HKFA&#x27;s president is Pui Kwan Kay and its chairman is Eric Fok . The CEO post has been eliminated since Joaquin Tam Chau Long&#x27;s resignation as CEO. Tam&#x27;s tenure was reported by media to have been controversial, with some executives leaving the association on his first day in office, along with being involved in two separate lawsuits with employees later.

=== Project Phoenix ===
Project Phoenix is a government-supported action plan to reform Hong Kong football from top to bottom.

=== 2010–11 ===
Former The FA executive director David Davies led the team of change agent - Scott Wilson Group, which was appointed by Hong Kong Football Association in September 2010 to carry out the reform and restructuring of football in Hong Kong.

On 21 November 2011, HKFA named Gordon McKie as its first chief executive officer (CEO). Gordon, the former chairman of the Scottish Rugby Union, had served HKFA for only ten months and resign from his post in September 2012 with personal reasons.

On 17 December 2011, HKFA appointed Ernie Merrick as the national head coach of Hong Kong Football Team. Merrick told to media that he felt honor to have an opportunity to participate the development and growing of Hong Kong football. Merrick won two titles in six season for Melbourne Victory. He started his new role on 9 January 2012.

On 23 December 2011, Kim Pan-Gon named national academy coach. Coach Kim will be wholly responsible for the identification, development and coaching of all players aged 18 and below.

=== 2012–13 ===
On 17 April 2012, Australian Steve O&#x27;Connor was appointed as the new technical director. The former head coach of the football program at the Australian Institute of Sport will take up his new post in will be responsible to improve the standards of local coaching, referee development, community and youth football activities and women&#x27;s football. He will also oversee the implementation of elite player development pathways from grassroots football to senior international level.

On 17 September 2012, HKFA appointed Mark Sutcliffe to replace Gordon Mckie as the CEO of HKFA.

On 7 February 2013, the Hong Kong Football Association stated that the new Premier League would get under way in Autumn 2014, where it was suggested that the 2013–14 season would be a transition year.

On 28 May 2013, HKFA promoted Korean coach Kim Pan-Gon to replace Ernie Merrick as the head coach of Hong Kong national team.

=== 2015 ===
In June 2015, The Government turned green light to build a national training centre in Tseung Kwan O. The budget of construction will be fully supported by the Hong Kong Jockey Club.

On 29 November 2015, Asian Football Confederation awarded the AFC Developing Member Association of the Year award to Hong Kong Football Association in recognition of its professional administration and governance as well its exceptional contribution to the development and promotion of the game at all levels within the country.

=== 2019 ===
On 4 December 2019, Asian Football Confederation awarded the AFC Developing Member Association of the Year award to the Hong Kong Football Association in recognition of excellent work in football development, women and girls football, community and district football, referee development, sports science, charitable projects and the expansion of facilities with the opening on the long-awaited Football Training Centre.

=== 2023 ===
In March 2023, the football association changed its name from &quot;The Hong Kong Football Association&quot; () to &quot;The Football Association of Hong Kong, China&quot; () as a result of the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China threatening to withdraw government funding for the HKFA. The rebrand was accompanied by a new emblem and a new emblem for the Hong Kong national football team.

== Criticism ==
Timothy Fok has served as president of the Hong Kong Football Association since 1997, after his father held the position for almost 30 years. In July 2020, the Legislative Council&#x27;s Public Accounts Committee criticized the HKFA under Timothy Fok, stating its governance was &quot;appalling and inexcusable&quot;. It noted that an internal audit committee, designed to review the association&#x27;s use of taxpayer funding, was not active between 2015 and 2019, despite receiving HK$34 million in funding for the 2017-18 year. Members of the Legislative Council also questioned if that taxpayer money was justified and well spent. After HKFA&#x27;s governance was criticized, the Legislative Council wanted to appoint board members to improve HKFA&#x27;s governance, but the HKFA rejected the idea and claimed candidates should go through proper election procedures.

In 2020, the government&#x27;s Audit Commission criticized HKFA, stating that the government had given HK$160,000,000 of taxpayer money to the HKFA but there was little improvement, and that Project Phoenix had a &quot;lack of progress&quot;. The report stated that some performance metrics had even declined since 2009, rather than improving.

In August 2022, a former coach of the women&#x27;s team was arrested for alleged sexual harassment of two female players. The association received a report from one of the victims but declined to intervene as the coach was no longer a staff member, stating &quot;We feel there is no authority to intervene in the case after careful consideration since the case did not involve the association&#x27;s current staff or took place at an association-sponsored event.&quot;

In May 2023, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) arrested 23 people suspected of match fixing in lower divisions, including 1 coach and 11 players. Pui Kwan Kay, then-chairman of the HKFA, said that the scandal &quot;would not have much effect on the holistic development of Hong Kong football&quot; and that match fixing &quot;is relatively hard to regulate.&quot;

In June 2024, the ex-head coach of Hong Kong football team, Jørn Andersen, said that HKFA receiving millions of taxpayer dollars every year made the HKFA have no motivation to improve, and said that the HKFA needed to be &quot;more professional, from top to bottom,&quot; and did &quot;not do enough&quot; to improve the sport. He also named Eric Fok as not taking enough action for the sport.

== Renaming ==
After the handover of Hong Kong in 1997, the HKFA has used the founding name - the &quot;Hong Kong Football Association&quot; until 2023.

In early 2023, the HKFA and other Hong Kong national sports associations were required by the &quot;Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China&quot; to add &quot;China&quot; to the name of the association. As the Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong, China warned to withhold government funding of HKFA, the HKFA eventually adopted the name change to &quot;The Football Association of Hong Kong, China&quot; during the annual meeting of the HKFA in March 2023.

In February 2024, the HKFA withdrew the esports team from AFC eAsian Cup 2023 just because the AFC and KONAMI did not use &quot;Hong Kong, China&quot; instead of &quot;Hong Kong&quot; (previous name of the HKFA) in the display name for the team.

== Funding ==
In terms of government funding, the HKFA has been one of the top receivers of taxpayer money out of all National Sports Associations in Hong Kong. Excluding one-time grants, it receives money from the Sports Subvention Scheme (SSS) and the Arts and Sport Development Fund (ASDF).

<doc id="1045978" wikidata="Q3232886" url="?curid=1045978" title="Wine and food pairing">
<text>Wine and food matching is the process of pairing food dishes with wine to enhance the dining experience. In many cultures, wine has had a long history of being a staple at the dinner table and in some ways both the winemaking and culinary traditions of a region will have evolved together over the years. Rather than following a set of rules, local cuisines were paired simply with local wines. The modern &quot;art&quot; of food pairings is a relatively recent phenomenon, fostering an industry of books and media with guidelines for pairings of particular foods and wine. In the restaurant industry, sommeliers are often present to make food pairing recommendations for the guest. The main concept behind pairings is that certain elements (such as texture and flavor) in both food and wine interact with each other, and thus finding the right combination of these elements will make the entire dining experience more enjoyable. However, taste and enjoyment are very subjective and what may be a &quot;textbook perfect&quot; pairing for one taster could be less enjoyable to another.

While there are many books, magazines and websites with detailed guidelines on how to pair food and wine, most food and wine experts believe that the most basic element of food and wine pairing is understanding the balance between the &quot;weight&quot; of the food and the weight (or body) of the wine. Heavy, robust wines like Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a light, delicate dish like a quiche, while light-bodied wines like Pinot Grigio would be similarly overwhelmed by a hearty stew. Beyond weight, flavors and textures can either be contrasted or complemented. From there a food and wine pairing can also take into consideration the sugar, acid, alcohol and tannins of the wine and how they can be accentuated or minimized when paired with certain types of food.

==History==

Wine has had a long history of being served as an accompaniment to food. The early history of wine has its origins as another dietary staple and a beverage that was often more sanitary than the local drinking water supply. There is little evidence that much serious thought was given to pairing particular dishes to particular wines with most likely whatever wine was available being used. However, as culinary traditions in a region developed, so too did local winemaking tradition.

Many pairings that are considered &quot;classics&quot; today emerged from the centuries-old relationship between a region&#x27;s cuisine and their wines. In Europe, lamb was a staple meat of the diet for many areas that today are leading wine regions. The red wines of regions such as Bordeaux, Greece, Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Rhone and Provence are considered classic pairings with the lamb dishes found in the local cuisines of those regions. In Italy, the intimate connection between food and wine is deeply embedded in the culture and is exemplified by the country&#x27;s wine. Historically, Italians rarely dined without wine and a region&#x27;s wine was crafted to be &quot;food friendly&quot;, often with bright acidity. While some Italian wines may seem tannic, lean or tart by themselves they often will show a very different profile when paired with boldly flavored Italian foods.

There have been some historical anecdotes that have related to food and wine pairing before modern times. One anecdote often attributed to British wine merchants is &quot;Buy on an apple and sell on cheese&quot; meaning that if a wine tastes good when paired with a raw, uncooked apple it must be truly good and pairing any wine with cheese will make it more palatable to the average consumer and easier to sell. The principles behind this anecdote lies in the food pairing properties of both fruit and cheeses. Fruits that are high in sugar and acidity (such as the malic acid in green apples) can make wines taste metallic and thin bodied. In contrast, hard cheeses such as cheddar can soften the tannins in wines and make them taste fuller and fruitier.

Another historical anecdote, still repeated today, is &quot;White wine with fish; Red wine with meat&quot;. The root of this adage rests on the principle of matching the body (weight) of the wine with the weight of the food. Meat was generally heavier and &quot;red&quot; in color so it was assumed that a red wine (which was usually heavier than white wine) paired better. Similarly fish was generally light and &quot;white&quot; in color so it was often paired with white wine. This adage has become outdated somewhat due to the variety of wine styles prevalent in modern winemaking where there are now many &quot;heavy&quot; white wines such as &quot;New World&quot; oaky Chardonnay that can have more body than lighter reds such as Pinot noir or Italian Merlots.

Another older idea was &quot;to pair strong cheeses with strong wines,&quot; for example, asiago, a sharply flavored cheese, with Zinfandel, a dark red wine with fruit tones.

===Modern history===
In recent years, the popularity and interest in food and wine pairings have increased and taken on new connotations. Industries have sprung up with print publications and media dedicated to expounding on the principles and ideals of pairing the perfect wine with the perfect dish. In the restaurant industry, there is often a dedicated individual or staff of sommeliers who are trained to recommend wine pairings with the restaurant&#x27;s fare. The origins of this recent phenomenon can be traced to the United States in the 1980s when the wine industry began to advertise wine-drinking as a component of dining rather than as just an alcoholic beverage meant for consumption and intoxication. Winemakers started to emphasize the kind of food dishes that their wines would go well with, some even printing pairing suggestions on back wine labels. Food magazines began to suggest particular wines with recipes and restaurants would offer multi-course dinners matched with a specific wine for each course.

Today there are multiple sources for detailed guidelines and tips on food and wine pairing. But many wine drinkers select wine pairings based on instinct, the mood of the meal or simply a desire to drink a particular wine at the moment they desire to eat a particular meal. The subjective nature of taste makes it possible to drink any kind of wine with any kind of food and have an enjoyable experience. Wine expert Mark Oldman has noted &quot;Food and wine pairing can be like sex and pizza: even when it&#x27;s bad, it can still be pretty good&quot; and gives the example of wedding cake with a dry sparkling wine. A very dry wine with a very sweet food is, according to Oldman, &quot;the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard&quot; and is not a &quot;good pairing&quot; according to most guidelines but the atmosphere of the occasion and the subjective nature of taste can trump any rule or guideline. Today, many wine experts and advocates in the realm of food and wine pairing try to focus on the more objective physical aspects of food that have an effect on the palate, altering (or enhancing) the perception of various aspects of the wine.

==Matching weight==
In food and wine pairings, the most basic element considered is &quot;weight&quot;-the balance between the weight of the food (a heavy, red sauce pasta versus a more delicate salad) and the weight or &quot;body&quot; of the wine (a heavy Cabernet Sauvignon versus a more delicate Pinot grigio). In wine tasting, body is determined primarily by the alcohol level of the wine and can be influenced by the perceptions of tannins (from the grape skins or oak) and extract (the dissolved solids in the wine derived from winemaking processes like extended maceration and sur lie aging). An oaked Chardonnay from a warm wine region, such as Australia will be &quot;heavier&quot; in body than a stainless steel fermented Chardonnay from a cooler wine region such as Chablis. Pairing heavy wines with light dishes or vice versa, can result in one partner overwhelming the other. The &quot;weight&quot; of a food can also be described in terms of the intensity of its flavors – such as delicate and more subtle flavors versus dishes that have more robust and hearty flavors. A key to pairing upon this principle is to identify the dominant flavor of the dish. Sauces can be the dominant flavor instead of the meat or main component. While poached fish is usually light bodied and better served with a light white, if the fish is served with a heavy cream sauce it could be better balanced with a fuller bodied white wine or light red.

Weight is also especially important when considering the wine style to pair with one of the most classic wine pairing dishes: cheese. Cheeses come in a wide range of flavors and textures, and it is important to consider the qualities of each in order to choose the right wine to pair. Soft, rindless cheeses which have not been aged usually sport a delicate texture and mild, tangy flavor, which will go best with dry or even off-dry white wines, along with light-bodied red wines and rosés. For example, fresh mozzarella or burrata will pair well with Italian Pinot Grigio, while a fresh goat cheese will go nicely with Riesling from the Finger Lakes or Germany. Creamy cheeses with a bloomy rind, like Camembert or Brie, will go beautifully with a traditional method sparkling wine, like Champagne or Cava. The acidity of these wines cuts the richness of the cheese, while the yeasty autolytic aromas and medium body complement the creaminess of the latter. Semi-soft cheeses like Gruyere are best with full-bodied white wines with some oak age, like a Meursault or Viognier. And finally, hard cheeses with some age on them, like a nutty Parmesan or Cheddar tend to go with equally nuanced and nutty Sherry or a full-bodied and complex red wine, like a Bordeaux or Barolo.

===Weights of wine===

Below is a rough guideline of the various weights of wines. Winemaker and regional style as well as oak treatment can cause a wine to be lighter or heavier in body. For example, Pinot noir can vary from being very light to more medium bodied. Another example is the influence of regional climates. Warmer climate wine regions tend to produce wines with higher alcohol levels and thus more fuller bodied wines so that a Sauvignon blanc from California may have a heavier weight than a Sauvignon blanc from the Loire.

;Lighter whites: Pinot gris, Pinot blanc, Riesling, Sauvignon blanc, Chablis, Champagne and sparkling wines, Gruner Veltliner, Vinho Verde
;Medium to heavy whites: Oaked Sauvignon blanc, Alsatian wines, Albarino, White Bordeaux (Semillon), White Burgundy, Rhone whites (Viognier, Roussanne, Marsanne), Tămâioasă Românească and New World Chardonnay
;Lighter reds: Beaujolais, Dolcetto, some Pinot noir
;Medium reds: Chianti, Barbera, Burgundy, Chinon, Rioja, Cabernet franc, Merlot, Malbec, Zinfandel, some Pinot noir
;Heavier reds: Syrah, Brunello di Montalcino, Cabernet Sauvignon, Port, Barbaresco and Barolo

===Focus of the pairing===
While a perfect balance where both food and wine are equally enhanced is theoretically possible, typically a pairing will have a more enhancing influence on one or the other. Master Sommelier Evan Goldstein notes that food and wine pairing is like two people having a conversation: &quot;&quot;One must listen while the other speaks or the result is a muddle&quot;.&quot; This means either the food or the wine will be the dominant focus of the pairing, with the other serving as a complement to enhance the enjoyment of the first. In regards to weight and intensity, if the focus of the pairing is the wine then a more ideal balance will be a food that is slightly lighter in weight to where it will not compete for attention with the wine but not too light to where it is completely overwhelmed. If the focus of the pairing is to highlight a dish then the same thought would apply in pairing a wine.

==Complement and contrast==

After considering weight, pairing the flavors and texture can be dealt with using one of two main strategies — complement or contrast.

The first strategy tries to bring wine together with dishes that complement each other such as an earthy, Burgundian Pinot noir with an earthy, mushroom dish.

The second strategy operates under the truism that &quot;opposites attract&quot; and brings together food and wine that have contrasting traits such as a crisp, acidic Sauvignon blanc and a fish with a creamy lemon sauce. The crisp acidity of the wine serves as a contrast that can cut through the creaminess of the sauce and give a different, refreshing sensation for the palate as opposed to what a complementary pairing, such as a creamy, buttery Chardonnay, would bring. For most of history, the &quot;complementary strategy&quot; was the prevailing thought on food and wine pairing. In the 1980s, as more people started to discover and experiment with pairings, the idea of using contrast started to gain more favor. It follows the same idea that the &quot;salty/sweet&quot; pairing does in cooking (such as salty peanut butter with sweet jelly).

The same food may be complemented contrasted: a hard, nutty cheese such as Hirtenkase should have &quot;a nutty, slightly sweet wine with it,&quot; a full bodied red wine.

==Physical properties of wine==
While it is often said that &quot;taste is subjective&quot;, there are quantifiable taste characteristics (like bitter, sweet, salty or sour) that can be perceived and measured as low, moderate or high — such as measuring the sweetness of honey or the saltiness of oysters. Flavors, such as butterscotch, char and strawberry, are more personal and can not be quantifiable. Flavors are either perceived to be present or not. The perception of flavors is linked to our sense of smell, while tastes come from the sensory glands of the taste buds. Though individual sensitivity to the different taste &quot;senses&quot; can vary, wine experts will often recommend pairings based on these more objective measurements rather than the more subjective concept of &quot;flavors&quot;. In wine there are three basic tastes-bitter, sweet and sour. These three tastes can each be identified with a primary component of the wine-tannins (bitter), residual sugar (sweet) and acidity (sour). A fourth component, alcohol, is identified in wine tasting with a perception of &quot;heat&quot; or hotness in the back of the mouth and is the primary factor influencing the body of the wine. The residual heat of the alcohol can be considered in food pairing with some ingredients minimizing the heat of the wine while some will accentuate it.

===Acidity===

Acidity is a dominant player in any food and wine pairing due to the pronounced and complex ways that it can heighten the perception of flavors. In wine tasting, acidity is perceived by a mouth watering response by the salivary glands. This mouth watering can also serve to stimulate the appetite. In wine there are three main acids that have their own associated flavors – malic (green apples), lactic (milky) and tartaric (bitter). In dishes that are fatty, oily, rich or salty, acidity in wine can &quot;cut&quot; (or standout and contrast) through the heaviness and be a refreshing change of pace on the palate. In cooking, acidity is often used in similar fashions such as a lemon wedges with a briny seafood dish such as oysters. The acidity of the lemon juices can make the oysters seem less briny. A wine that is less tart than the dish it is served with will taste thin and weak. A wine that comes across as &quot;too tart&quot; on its own may seem softer when paired with an acidic and tart dish. The complementing &quot;tartness&quot; of the food and wine cancels each other out and allows the other components (fruit of the wine, other flavors of the food) to be more noticeable.

===Sweetness===
The sweetness of wines is determined by the amount of residual sugar left in the wine after the fermentation process. Wines can be bone dry (with the sugars fully fermented into alcohol), off-dry (with a hint of sweetness), semi-dry (medium-sweet) and dessert level sweetness (such as the high sugar content in Sauternes and Tokays). Sweet wines often need to be sweeter than the dish they are served with. Vintage brut champagne paired with sweet, wedding cake can make the wine taste tart and weak while the cake will have off flavors. In food pairings, sweetness balances spice and heat. It can serve as a contrast to the heat and alleviate some of the burning sensation caused by peppers and spices, e.g. in Thai or Sichuan cuisine. It can accentuate the mild sweetness in some foods and can also contrast with salt such as the European custom of pairing salty Stilton cheese with a sweet Port. Sweetness in a wine can balance tartness in food, especially if the food has some sweetness (such as dishes with sweet and sour sauces).

===Bitterness===

The astringency associated with wine is usually derived from a wine&#x27;s tannins. Tannins add a gritty texture and chalky, astringent taste. It can enhance the perception of &quot;body&quot; or weight in the wine. Tannins are normally derived from the skins, seeds, and stems of the grapes themselves (leached out during the maceration process) or from contact with oak during barrel aging. Tannins react with proteins. When paired with dishes that are high in proteins and fats (such as red meat and hard cheeses), the tannins will bind to the proteins and come across as softer. In the absence of protein from the food, such as some vegetarian dishes, the tannins will react with the proteins on the tongue and sides of the mouth – accentuating the astringency and having a drying effect on the palate. Various cooking methods, such as grilling and blackening can add a bitter &quot;char&quot; component to the dish that will allow it to play well with a tannic wine, while fish oils can make tannic wines taste metallic or off. Astringent tannic wines like Barolo and Cabernet Sauvignon can overwhelm a lot of foods but can be softened by fatty foods with a lot of proteins such as hard cheeses or meats. The dry tannins also serve as a cleansing agent on the palate by binding to the grease and oils left over in the mouth. Spicy and sweet foods can accentuate the dry, bitterness of tannins and make the wine seem to have off flavors.

===Alcohol===
Alcohol is the primary factor in dictating a wine&#x27;s weight and body. Typically the higher the alcohol level, the more weight the wine has. An increase in alcohol content will increase the perception of density and texture. In food and wine pairing, salt and spicy heat will accentuate the alcohol and the perception of &quot;heat&quot; or hotness in the mouth. Conversely, the alcohol can also magnify the heat of spicy food making a highly alcoholic wine paired with a very spicy dish one that will generate a lot of heat for the taster.

==Other pairing principles==
Beyond the basic guidelines listed above, food pairings can dive even further into matching several layers of texture and flavors. The term &quot;bridge ingredients&quot; refers to ingredients and flavors that have certain affinities in wine pairing (such as slow-cooked onions with creamy wines, etc.). It can also refer to using particular herbs and spices perceived in the wine (such as rosemary in some Cabernet Sauvignon) and adding them to the dish as an ingredient. Their presence in a dish may increase the likelihood that the certain wines will pair well.

The above principles can be used for pairing wines with Asian cuisine. Pair for the flavor of the dish – whatever the &#x27;main ingredient&#x27; may be – it is not the meat, seafood, or vegetables that stand out as the predominant flavor. Rather the true flavor of the dish is determined by the cooking method (for example, the toasty flavors of a stir fry), the sauce (from curries to sweet-and-sour), the use of seasonings (such as ginger and coriander leaves to mask fishy tastes), or the blending of ingredients to form new flavors (as in sukiyaki or satay). Indeed, it may result from a combination of any of these elements. Also, note that in the case of an Asian meal, several dishes are served at the same time and are shared by everyone present. The wine chosen for such a meal has to be versatile.

He served in the Army Air Forces from March 1943 to March 1946. Upon discharge from the army, Punsly entered the Medical College of the University of Georgia, subsequently obtaining his medical degree in 1949. He returned to California and set up a medical practice in Torrance, never returning to show business.

<text>Cop Land is a 1997 American crime drama film written and directed by James Mangold. It stars Sylvester Stallone, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, and Robert De Niro as the main cast, with Peter Berg, Janeane Garofalo, Robert Patrick, Michael Rapaport, Annabella Sciorra, Noah Emmerich, and Cathy Moriarty in supporting roles. Stallone portrays the sheriff of a small New Jersey town who comes into conflict with the corrupt New York City police officers living in the community. The film received positive reviews and grossed $63.7 million on a $15 million budget.

== Plot ==
The town of Garrison, New Jersey, is home to a cadre of police officers from the NYPD&#x27;s 37th Precinct: Lieutenant Ray Donlan, Detective Leo Crasky and officers Gary Figgis, Jack Rucker, Frank Lagonda and Joey Randone. Exploiting a loophole that allows them to live outside the city by being designated &quot;auxiliary transit cops,&quot; Donlan and his men are effectively untouchable by the NYPD&#x27;s internal affairs division and are further protected by the local sheriff, Freddy Heflin. Unable to fulfill his lifelong dream of joining the NYPD due to losing his hearing in one ear while rescuing a woman as a young man, Heflin idolizes Donlan and refuses to help internal affairs investigator Lieutenant Moe Tilden.

One night, Donlan&#x27;s nephew, Officer Murray Babitch, is sideswiped by two African American youths while driving across the George Washington Bridge. One of the youths points what looks like a weapon at Babitch just as his tire blows out from a glass puncture; a frightened Babitch shoots them both dead. Donlan, Rucker and Crasky show up and try to plant a gun in the teens&#x27; car, only to get caught by a paramedic. In desperation, Donlan convinces Babitch to fake his suicide before hiding him in Garrison with a promise that he will set him up with a new identity.

Randone&#x27;s wife Liz — the woman Heflin saved from drowning — visits Heflin at his home and they confess their feelings for each other. Meanwhile, the cocaine-addicted Figgis is kicked out of Donlan&#x27;s circle, and his house burns down soon after with his girlfriend inside; Heflin lets him stay at his home thinking that Donlan tried to kill him. Fearing Babitch will expose him, Donlan unsuccessfully tries to drown his nephew; Babitch escapes and goes to Heflin for help but flees when he sees Figgis. During a drug bust in New York, Randone is thrown off a roof to his death. Donlan chooses not to save him after learning that Randone has been sleeping with his wife, Rose.

Tired of being pushed around by Donlan and his men, Heflin visits Tilden to offer his help with the investigation, only to learn that the mayor, under pressure from Donlan&#x27;s allies in the police union, has ordered internal affairs to cease investigating. As Heflin leaves, he steals discarded internal affairs files that reveal Donlan&#x27;s ties to organized crime. Donlan has used those connections to create a safe haven in Garrison while trafficking drugs through the 37th Precinct, even having a police officer who sought to testify against him stabbed to death in his jail cell.

Heflin brings the files to his deputies Cindy and Bill, but Bill is reluctant to get involved while Cindy loses faith in Heflin&#x27;s leadership and resigns. Rucker tries to intimidate Heflin over his internal affairs visit at a carnival pistol game, but he is surprised to find that Heflin is a crack shot. While later sharing dinner, a rattled Liz chides Heflin for digging into Donlan and accuses him of trying to take Randone&#x27;s place in her life. Resigned, he walks away from her.

After Lagonda threatens him at a gas station, Heflin looks into the fire at Figgis&#x27; house and realizes that it was arson. Figgis admits that he started the fire to commit insurance fraud so he could leave Garrison and start over. The two men argue, and Figgis abandons Heflin and drives away. Heflin goes to Rose and convinces her to reveal where Babitch is hiding, planning to hand him over to Tilden. After sending Bill away for his own protection, Heflin walks Babitch over to his car but is ambushed by Rucker, who fires a gun next to his good ear and renders him completely deaf. Discombobulated, Heflin follows Rucker as he drives Babitch to Donlan&#x27;s residence.

In the ensuing shootout, Heflin kills Lagonda and Rucker; Crasky wounds him in the shoulder before Figgis suddenly appears and guns Crasky down. Inside, Donlan tries to shoot Heflin in the back before Figgis distracts him, resulting in Heflin fatally shooting Donlan in the chest. The two men drive Babitch to police headquarters in New York and deliver him to Tilden. Figgis turns state&#x27;s evidence, resulting in sweeping arrests and indictments across the union, the mob and the 37th Precinct. Heflin undergoes medical treatment to fix his good ear and returns to his old job in Garrison.

== Production ==

Garrison is based on Mangold&#x27;s hometown of Washingtonville, New York, located about from New York City. Mangold grew up in a development called Worley Heights, where many of the residents were current and former NYPD police officers.
Stallone gained to portray the beaten-down sheriff of Garrison. 

The principal shooting location for the film was Edgewater, New Jersey.

== Music ==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack features two songs from Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 1980 album &quot;The River&quot;: &quot;Drive All Night&quot; and &quot;Stolen Car&quot;, songs by other artists, and an original score from Howard Shore. One additional song, Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s &quot;Burnin&#x27; for You&quot;, was added to the soundtrack of the director&#x27;s cut, first released on home video in 2004.

The score by Howard Shore was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra and released as &quot;Cop Land: Music from the Miramax Motion Picture&quot; in 1997. The soundtrack released on CD contained twelve tracks, with a runtime of 40:11 minutes.

== Release ==
=== Theatrical ===
&quot;Cop Land&quot; premiered at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on August 6, 1997. Some of the film&#x27;s cast members attended, including Stallone, Keitel, Liotta, Sciorra, Moriarty and Rapaport.

Stallone&#x27;s understated performance was praised by critics and he received the Best Actor award at the Stockholm International Film Festival. &quot;Cop Land&quot; was also screened at the 54th Venice Film Festival in the Midnight line-up. Earlier in May 1997, the film was accepted into the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival, but Miramax declined the invitation due to re-shoots that were needed for the film, including footage of Stallone 40 pounds heavier.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Cop Land&quot; has been released on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD numerous times since 1998. The US laserdisc release had the theatrical cut in letterboxed (non-anamorphic) widescreen with special features consisting of an audio commentary with director James Mangold on the left analogue channel and chapter 16 of the laserdisc containing deleted scenes. The initial extras-free DVDs had the theatrical cut in non-anamorphic widescreen, while subsequent issues, including various &quot;Collector&#x27;s Editions&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray, have favored the director&#x27;s cut. StudioCanal&#x27;s French and German region B-locked Blu-rays exclusively feature both the 101-minute theatrical cut and 116-minute director&#x27;s cut.

Extras include an audio commentary (with James Mangold, Sylvester Stallone, Robert Patrick, and producer Cathy Konrad), &quot;The Making of an Urban Western&quot; featurette, a storyboard comparison, two deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.

The two deleted scenes primarily show the racism in the town of Garrison. One scene involves all the resident police officers chasing down a pair of black motorists, and the other shows Heflin&#x27;s deputy pointing out that the majority of the tickets issued in Garrison go to black motorists on charges that suggest racial profiling.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film had a record opening weekend for Miramax with a gross of $13.5 million and went on to gross $44.9 million in the United States and Canada and $63.7 million worldwide.

=== Critical response===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 75% based on 67 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Cop Land&quot; gifts its star-studded cast with richly imagined characters while throttling the audience with carefully-ratcheted suspense, although this potboiler lacks the moral complexity of the crime classics that it harkens to.&quot; On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, &quot;There is a rough balance between how long a movie is, how deep it goes and how much it can achieve. That balance is not found in &quot;Cop Land&quot; and the result is too much movie for the running time&quot;. On the other hand, Gene Siskel praised the movie, especially the screenplay, as &quot;one to be savored.&quot;

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the strength of &quot;Cop Land&quot; is in its hard-edged, novelistic portraits, which pile up furiously during the film&#x27;s dynamic opening scenes ... Yet if the price of Mangold&#x27;s casting ambitions is a story that can&#x27;t, finally, match its marquee value, that value is still inordinately strong. Everywhere the camera turns in this tense and volatile drama, it finds enough interest for a truckload of conventional Hollywood fare. Whatever its limitations, &quot;Cop Land&quot; has talent to burn&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B−&quot; rating, and Owen Gleiberman wrote, &quot;Stallone does a solid, occasionally winning job of going through the motions of shedding his stardom, but the wattage of his personality is turned way down—at times, it&#x27;s turned down to neutral. And that pretty much describes &quot;Cop Land&quot;, too. Dense, meandering, ambitious yet jarringly pulpy, this tale of big-city corruption in small-town America has competence without mood or power—a design but not a vision&quot;. In her review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley wrote, &quot;With its redundancy of supporting characters, snarled subplots and poky pace, &quot;Cop Land&quot; really might have been better off trading the director for a traffic cop&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s Peter Travers praised Stallone&#x27;s performance: &quot;His performance builds slowly but achieves a stunning payoff when Freddy decides to clean up his town... Freddy awakes to his own potential, and it&#x27;s exhilarating to watch the character and the actor revive in unison. Nearly down for the count in the movie ring, Stallone isn&#x27;t just back in the fight. He&#x27;s a winner&quot;. In his review for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle also liked Stallone&#x27;s work: &quot;His transformation is more than a matter of weight. He looks spiritually beaten and terribly sad. He looks like a real person, not a cult-of-the-body film star, and he uses the opportunity to deliver his best performance in years&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
With its dark tone and all-star dramatic cast, &quot;Cop Land&quot; was a shift from Stallone&#x27;s recent comic efforts which were critical and box office bombs (1991&#x27;s &quot;Oscar&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot&quot;). Additionally, &quot;Cop Land&quot; was to show Stallone in a completely different light, both physically (his weight gain got a lot of press coverage), as well as artistically, by letting him showcase his acting skills.

The film posted solid box-office takings, got good reviews, and Stallone received positive critical notices for his performance. Yet Stallone has said the film was bad for his career. In a 2019 interview Stallone called Mangold &quot;the best director I ever worked with [but the film] actually worked in reverse. It was pretty good critically, but the fact that it didn&#x27;t do a lot of box office, again it fomented the opinion that I had my moment and was going the way of the dodo bird and the Tasmanian tiger.&quot;

James Mangold said the hype due to the casting &quot;overscaled the movie&quot; and added: &quot;I&#x27;m very proud of the movie and the ideas in it, but one of the things that was difficult for me at the time was that I&#x27;d imagined the lead being someone you hadn&#x27;t heard of before, so that their extension into a hero would be less Hollywood.&quot;.

<text>Under the Roof of One China is a political principle introduced by James Soong in regard to the relationship between Taiwan and the World Health Organization.

In 2003, during the 2004 Republic of China presidential election campaign, both Mainland China (People&#x27;s Republic of China) and Taiwan (Republic of China) had an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the same time. Taiwan, being one of the most endemic areas, did not receive advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) because it lost its UN seat in 1976. Taiwan claims that the lack of direct communication precluded proper handling of the disease and caused unnecessary deaths on the island.

In May 2003, James Soong, the Vice Presidential candidate under Lien Chan, criticized the ruling party for not being able to participate in WHO and thus receiving no international assistance on controlling the spread of SARS. Soong proposed that once elected, he would not challenge the One-China principle set by the People&#x27;s Republic of China but at the same time would seek international participation in different international organizations. He named this cross-strait policy &quot;Under the Roof of One China&quot;. Soong believed that with this principle, he would be able to lead Taiwan to obtain a seat in WHO. Political opponents questioned how he could guard the sovereignty of Taiwan and accept Taiwan as a part of China at the same time. The principle was subsequently abandoned by him and his running mate in the 2004 presidential election.

<doc id="1045993" wikidata="Q1534871" url="?curid=1045993" title="Richard Hoggart">
<text>Herbert Richard Hoggart (24 September 1918 – 10 April 2014) was an English academic whose career covered the fields of sociology, English literature and cultural studies, with emphasis on British popular culture.

==Early life==
Hoggart was born in the Potternewton area of Leeds, one of three children in an impoverished family. His father, Tom Longfellow Hoggart (1880–1922), the son of a boilermaker, was a regular infantry soldier and housepainter who died of brucellosis when Hoggart was a year old, and his mother Adeline died of a chest illness when he was eight. He grew up with his grandmother in Hunslet, and was encouraged in his education by an aunt. Emulating his elder brother, Tom, the first of the family to go to a grammar school, he gained a place at Cockburn High School which was a grammar school, after his headmaster requested that the education authority reread his scholarship examination essay. He then won a scholarship to study English at the University of Leeds, where he graduated with a first class degree. He served with the Royal Artillery during World War II and was discharged as a staff captain.

==Career==
He was a staff tutor at the University of Hull from 1946 to 1959, and published his first book, a study of W. H. Auden&#x27;s poetry, in 1951. His major work, &quot;The Uses of Literacy&quot;, was published in 1957. Partly autobiography, the volume was interpreted as lamenting the loss of an authentic working class popular culture in Britain, and denouncing the imposition of a mass culture through advertising, media and Americanisation.

He became Senior Lecturer in English at the University of Leicester from 1959 to 1962. Hoggart was an expert witness at the Lady Chatterley trial in 1960, and his argument that it was an essentially moral and &quot;puritan&quot; work, which merely repeated words he had heard on a building site on his way to the court, is sometimes viewed as having had a decisive influence on the outcome of the trial.

While Professor of English at Birmingham University between 1962 and 1973, he founded the institution&#x27;s Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in 1964 and was its director until 1969. Hoggart was Assistant Director-General of UNESCO (1971–1975) and finally Warden of Goldsmiths, University of London (1976–1984), after which he retired from formal academic life. The Main Building at Goldsmiths has now been renamed the &quot;Richard Hoggart Building&quot; in tribute to his contributions to the college.

Hoggart was a member of numerous public bodies and committees, including the Albemarle Committee on Youth Services (1958–1960), the Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting (1960–1962), the Arts Council of Great Britain (1976–1981) and the Statesman and Nation Publishing Company Ltd (1977–1981). He was also Chairman of the Advisory Council for Adult and Continuing Education (1977–1983), and the Broadcasting Research Unit (1981–1991), as well as a Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Company (1962–1988).

In later works, such as &quot;The Way We Live Now&quot; (1995), he regretted the decline in moral authority that he held religion once provided. He also attacked contemporary education for its emphasis on the vocational, and cultural relativism for its tendency to concentrate on the popular and meretricious.

==Personal life==
One of his two sons was the political journalist Simon Hoggart, who predeceased him by three months, and the other was the television critic Paul Hoggart. He was also survived by a daughter, Nicola. In &quot;The Chatterley Affair&quot;, a 2006 dramatisation of the 1960 trial made for the digital television channel BBC Four, he was played by actor David Tennant.

==Death==
In later life he suffered from dementia. He died at a nursing home in London on 10 April 2014, aged 95.

== &quot;Auden: An Introductory Essay&quot; ==
Hoggart wrote a &quot;critical study&quot; of the &quot;whole range of Auden&#x27;s works.&quot; This &quot;range&quot; included &quot;the earlier poems of the thirties, the plays, and the long poems.&quot;

<text>1,000,000 (one million), or one thousand thousand, is the natural number following 999,999 and preceding 1,000,001. The word is derived from the early Italian &quot;millione&quot; (&quot;milione&quot; in modern Italian), from &quot;mille&quot;, &quot;thousand&quot;, plus the augmentative suffix &quot;-one&quot;.

It is commonly abbreviated:
* in British English as m (not to be confused with the metric prefix &quot;m&quot; &quot;milli&quot;, for , or with metre), 
* M, 
* MM (&quot;thousand thousands&quot;, from Latin &quot;Mille&quot;; not to be confused with the Roman numeral = 2,000),
* mm (not to be confused with millimetre), or 
* mn, mln, or mio can be found in financial contexts.

In scientific notation, it is written as or 106. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega (M), when dealing with SI units; for example, 1 megawatt (1 MW) equals 1,000,000 watts.

The meaning of the word &quot;million&quot; is common to the short scale and long scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems.

The million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number, as in &quot;Not in a million years&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re one in a million&quot;, or a hyperbole, as in &quot;I&#x27;ve walked a million miles&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;ve asked a million-dollar question&quot;.

1,000,000 is also the square of 1000 and also the cube of 100.

==Visualizing one million==
Even though it is often stressed that counting to precisely a million would be an exceedingly tedious task due to the time and concentration required, there are many ways to bring the number &quot;down to size&quot; in approximate quantities, ignoring irregularities or packing effects.
* Information: Not counting spaces, the text printed on 136 pages of an Encyclopædia Britannica, or 600 pages of pulp paperback fiction contains approximately one million characters.
* Length: There are one million millimetres in a kilometre, and roughly a million sixteenths of an inch in a mile (1 sixteenth = 0.0625). A typical car tire might rotate a million times in a trip, while the engine would do several times that number of revolutions.
* Fingers: If the width of a human finger is , then a million fingers lined up would cover a distance of . If a person walks at a speed of , it would take them approximately five and a half hours to reach the end of the fingers.
* Area: A square a thousand objects or units on a side contains a million such objects or square units, so a million holes might be found in less than three square yards of window screen, or similarly, in about one half square foot (400–500 cm2) of bed sheet cloth. A city lot 70 by 100 feet is about a million square inches.
* Volume: The cube root of one million is one hundred, so a million objects or cubic units is contained in a cube a hundred objects or linear units on a side. A million grains of table salt or granulated sugar occupies about , the volume of a cube one hundred grains on a side. One million cubic inches would be the volume of a small room  feet long by  feet wide by  feet high.
* Mass: A million cubic millimetres (small droplets) of water would have a volume of one litre and a mass of one kilogram. A million millilitres or cubic centimetres (one cubic metre) of water has a mass of a million grams or one tonne.
* Weight: A million honey bees would weigh the same as an person.
* Landscape: A pyramidal hill wide at the base and high would weigh about a million short tons.
* Computer: A display resolution of 1,280 by 800 pixels contains 1,024,000 pixels.
* Money: A U.S. dollar bill of any denomination weighs . There are 454 grams in a pound. One million dollar bills would weigh or 1 tonne (just over 1 short ton).
* Time: A million seconds, 1 megasecond, is 11.57 days.

In Indian English and Pakistani English, it is also expressed as 10 lakh. Lakh is derived from for 100,000 in Sanskrit.

<text>The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the science fiction novels of Alan Dean Foster. The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the mammalian Humans of the planet Earth and the insectoid Thranx which dwell upon Hivehom. The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the United Federation of Planets from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a human–alien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but symbiotic, allowing an amalgamation of the two species.

<doc id="1046013" wikidata="Q197813" url="?curid=1046013" title="Zhong Hui">
<text>Zhong Hui (225 – 3 March 264), courtesy name Shiji, was a Chinese calligrapher, essayist, military general, and politician of the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was the younger son of Zhang Changpu with Zhong Yao, who served as the Grand Tutor in the Wei imperial court. He was already known for being insightful, intelligent and knowledgeable since he was young. Zhong Hui rose to prominence in the 250s when he became a close aide to Sima Zhao, the regent and &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Wei. He advised Sima Zhao on how to deal with Zhuge Dan&#x27;s Rebellion in Shouchun from 257 to 258 and was highly regarded by the latter. With Sima Zhao&#x27;s help, Zhong Hui steadily moved up the ranks and became one of the key figures in the Wei government.

In 263, the Wei imperial court ordered Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead separate armies to attack and conquer Wei&#x27;s rival state, Shu Han. During and after the campaign against Shu, Zhong Hui framed Zhuge Xu and Deng Ai for cowardice and treason respectively, and seized command of their troops. By the time Shu surrendered to Wei in 263, Zhong Hui was in full control of all the Wei military forces in Shu territory. In 264, with backing from Jiang Wei, a former Shu general, Zhong Hui started a rebellion against Sima Zhao. However, the revolt failed when Zhong Hui&#x27;s plan to purge several Wei officers – because he was worried that they would not support him – was leaked out. The officers escaped from prison, regrouped with their men, mutinied against Zhong Hui, and killed him and Jiang Wei.

==Early life and career==
Zhong Hui&#x27;s ancestral home was in Changshe County (), Yingchuan Commandery (), which is located east of present-day Changge, Henan. He was the younger son of Zhong Yao, who served as the Grand Tutor () in the Wei imperial court. At a young age, he was already known for being insightful and intelligent. His mother, Zhang Changpu, was known for being very strict with her son and for her influential role in his early education.

The Wei official Jiang Ji wrote in one of his works that one can tell what a person&#x27;s character is like by observing his/her eye pupils. When Zhong Hui was four years old, his father sent him to meet Jiang Ji, who noted that the boy was extraordinary. By the time Zhong Hui reached adulthood, he was already famous for being hardworking, well read, and versed in different types of arts. During the Zhengshi era (240–249) of the reign of Cao Fang, he served as a Gentleman Cadet of the Imperial Library () and was later promoted to Attendant Gentleman of the Palace Writers and Masters of Writing (). He was awarded the title of a Secondary Marquis () when Cao Mao ascended the throne in 254.

Zhong Hui studied the &quot;Yijing&quot;. After his death, a 20-volume book titled &quot;Dao Lun&quot; () was discovered in his house. The book, which was believed to be written by Zhong Hui, discussed either Legalist or Logician philosophy even though its title suggests it was about Taoism. When he reached adulthood, his fame placed him on par with the philosopher Wang Bi, who was about the same age as him.

===Gaining the attention of Sima Shi===
The &quot;Shiyu&quot; recorded an incident about how Zhong Hui came to the attention of the Wei regent Sima Shi. Sima Shi instructed Yu Song (), the Prefect of the Palace Writers (), to draft a memorandum. He was not satisfied after reading Yu Song&#x27;s draft and ordered him to rewrite. Yu Song was unable to think of a better way to write the memorandum after racking his brains and felt gloomy. Zhong Hui noticed Yu Song looked troubled, so he offered to help him and changed five words in the memorandum. Yu Song was pleased after looking through Zhong Hui&#x27;s edits and he presented the revised draft to Sima Shi later. After reading it, Sima Shi asked him, &quot;You didn&#x27;t make these changes. Who edited it?&quot; Yu Song replied, &quot;Zhong Hui. I&#x27;ve been wanting to recommend him to you, my lord. Now that you asked, I shan&#x27;t keep him to myself anymore.&quot; Sima Shi said, &quot;He&#x27;s capable of shouldering greater responsibilities. Summon him.&quot; When Yu Song informed Zhong Hui that Sima Shi wanted to meet him, Zhong asked him about Sima&#x27;s abilities, to which Yu replied, &quot;He&#x27;s learned, wise and multi-talented.&quot; Zhong Hui stayed at home for about ten days, during which he refused to meet any visitors and carefully thought about what he would say to Sima Shi. On the day he met Sima Shi, he entered Sima&#x27;s residence early in the morning and left only at midnight. After Zhong Hui left, Sima Shi remarked, &quot;He&#x27;s truly a great talent capable of assisting rulers.&quot;

Pei Songzhi cast doubts on the &quot;Shiyu&quot; account. He felt that it was unlikely that Yu Song had to recommend Zhong Hui to Sima Shi, because Sima would most probably have already at least heard of Zhong due to the following reasons. First, Zhong Hui came from an elite family background. Second, he was already famous when he was still a youth. Third, he started serving in the Wei government as soon as he reached the age of adulthood. Pei also believed that it was impossible for anyone to be able to tell, simply by reading a piece of writing, that a person who edited a few words in it is capable of shouldering greater responsibilities.

==Role in the Shouchun rebellions==
===Sima Zhao&#x27;s rise to power===
In 255, when the Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a rebellion in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Sima Shi led Wei imperial forces to suppress the revolt, with Zhong Hui accompanying him as an assistant officer. Sima Shi&#x27;s younger brother, Sima Zhao, followed behind with another army to support them. Sima Shi died in Xuchang after the rebellion was suppressed. He was succeeded by Sima Zhao, who took over command of his troops. At the time, the Wei emperor Cao Mao ordered Sima Zhao to remain in Xuchang and Fu Jia to lead the armies back to the imperial capital, Luoyang. Zhong Hui conspired with Fu Jia to urge Sima Zhao to disregard the emperor&#x27;s order and lead the troops to a garrison at the south of the Luo River () near Luoyang. Sima Zhao became the new regent and continued to remain in control of the Wei government as his brother did before him. Zhong Hui was appointed as a Gentleman of the Yellow Gate () and awarded the title &quot;Marquis of Dongwu Village&quot; () with 300 taxable households in his marquisate.

===Helping to suppress Zhuge Dan&#x27;s rebellion===
In 257, the Wei imperial court summoned the general Zhuge Dan, who was stationed in Shouchun, to return to Luoyang to serve as the Excellency of Works (). At the time, Zhong Hui was practising filial mourning because his mother recently died. However, he immediately stopped mourning and went to warn Sima Zhao when he foresaw that Zhuge Dan would disobey the order. Sima Zhao felt that it was troublesome to change the order since it had already been sent out so he did not take any action. Zhuge Dan started a rebellion in Shouchun later. Zhong Hui accompanied Sima Zhao as he led imperial forces to attack the rebels.

When Zhuge Dan rebelled in Shouchun, Sun Chen, the regent of Wei&#x27;s rival state Eastern Wu, ordered the general Quan Yì () and others to lead Wu forces to support Zhuge Dan. Quan Yì had disagreements with his relatives Quan Hui () and Quan Yí (), who were in the Wu capital, Jianye (建業; present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu). Quan Hui and Quan Yí brought along their families and followers and defected to Wei. When Zhong Hui received news about their defection, he suggested to Sima Zhao to ask Quan Hui and Quan Yí to write a secret letter to Quan Yì and lie to him that Sun Chen was displeased by Quan Yì&#x27;s failure to conquer Shouchun and wanted to execute Quan Yì&#x27;s family, hence they decided to defect to Wei. Quan Yì became fearful so he brought along his troops and surrendered to Sima Zhao. Without support from Wu, Zhuge Dan&#x27;s rebels were defeated by Sima Zhao&#x27;s forces and Shouchun was taken back by Wei. Zhong Hui was more highly regarded than before by Sima Zhao due to the success of his plan. His contemporaries also compared him to Zhang Liang, a strategist who served under the Han dynasty&#x27;s founder, Emperor Gao.

After Zhong Hui returned to Luoyang, the Wei imperial court offered him the position of Minister Coachman (), but he turned down the offer and chose to be a clerk in Sima Zhao&#x27;s office. He was one of Sima Zhao&#x27;s close aides. Later, the imperial court wanted to enfeoff him as the &quot;Marquis of Chen&quot; () to honour him for his contributions in suppressing Zhuge Dan&#x27;s rebellion, but he declined to accept the marquis title. The court respected his decision and appointed him as the Colonel-Director of Retainers () instead. Zhong Hui was still heavily involved in politics in the imperial court even though he did not serve in the court. He also played a major role in instigating Sima Zhao to execute Ji Kang.

==Conquest of Shu==
===Strategic planning and opening moves===
Between 247 and 262, Jiang Wei, a general from Wei&#x27;s rival state Shu Han, led a series of military campaigns to attack Wei&#x27;s western borders, but failed to make any significant territorial gains. Sima Zhao felt that Shu was growing weak and lacking in resources after all the campaigns, hence he wanted to launch a large-scale invasion of Shu to eliminate it. Among those he consulted, only Zhong Hui agreed that Shu could be conquered. Zhong Hui assisted Sima Zhao in formulating a strategy for the conquest of Shu.

In the winter of 262–263, Zhong Hui was appointed General Who Guards the West () and granted imperial authority to manage military affairs in the Guanzhong region. Sima Zhao also mobilised military forces from the various provinces in Wei and ordered Tang Zi to oversee the construction of warships in preparation for an invasion on Wei&#x27;s other rival state, Eastern Wu.

In the autumn of 263, the Wei imperial court issued an edict ordering Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu to lead 30,000 troops each and attack Shu from two directions: Deng Ai&#x27;s force would pass through Gansong (甘松; southeast of present-day Têwo County, Gansu) and Tazhong (沓中; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu), and engage Jiang Wei&#x27;s army; Zhuge Xu&#x27;s force would pass through Wujie Bridge (武街橋; northwest of present-day Wen County, Gansu) and block Jiang Wei&#x27;s retreat route. Zhong Hui led another army, numbering some 100,000 men, and entered Shu territory via the Xie Valley (斜谷; southwest of present-day Mei County, Shaanxi) and Luo Valley (駱谷; southwest of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi).

Zhong Hui ordered Xu Yi, a son of the veteran Wei general Xu Chu, to oversee the construction of a road leading into Shu. However, when the road turned out to be poorly built, Zhong Hui disregarded Xu Yi&#x27;s background and had him executed for failing his mission. The Wei army was shocked at Zhong Hui&#x27;s audacity.

===Engagements with Shu forces===
In response to the Wei invasion, the Shu government ordered its armed forces to refrain from engaging the enemy and instead retreat to Hancheng (漢城; east of present-day Mian County, Shaanxi) and Lecheng (樂城; east of present-day Chenggu County, Shaanxi) and hold their positions. Liu Qin (), the Administrator of the Wei-controlled Weixing Commandery (魏興郡; around present-day Ankang, Shaanxi), led his army through the Ziwu Valley (子午谷; east of present-day Yang County, Shaanxi) towards the Shu-controlled Hanzhong Commandery. The Shu officers Wang Han () and Jiang Bin () defended Hancheng and Lecheng respectively with 5,000 troops each. Zhong Hui ordered his subordinates Xun Kai () and Li Fu () to lead 10,000 men each to attack Hancheng and Lecheng, while he led his main army towards Yang&#x27;an Pass (陽安口; also known as Yangping Pass, in present-day Ningqiang County, Shaanxi). Along the way, he sent his men to pay respects on his behalf at Zhuge Liang&#x27;s tomb (at the foot of Mount Dingjun, Mian County, Shaanxi). When he arrived at Yang&#x27;an Pass, he ordered Hu Lie () to lead the attack on the pass. Hu Lie succeeded in capturing the pass and the supplies stored there by Shu forces.

Jiang Wei retreated from Tazhong towards Yinping (陰平; northwest of present-day Wen County, Gansu), where he rallied his troops and prepared to reinforce Yang&#x27;an Pass. However, he retreated to a fort at Baishui (白水; in present-day Qingchuan County, Sichuan) when he heard that Yang&#x27;an Pass had been captured by Wei forces. He rendezvoused with the Shu generals Zhang Yi, Liao Hua and others and moved to defend their position at the fortified mountain pass Jiange (劒閣; also known as Jianmen Pass, in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan). Zhong Hui wrote a long address to the Shu forces, urging them to give up resistance and surrender to Wei.

Deng Ai pursued Jiang Wei to Yinping, where he formed a group of elite soldiers from among his troops and took a shortcut to Jiangyou (江由; north of present-day Jiangyou, Sichuan) through Deyang Village (德陽亭; northwest of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), and approached Mianzhu, which was near the Shu capital Chengdu. He asked Zhuge Xu to join him. Zhuge Xu had received orders to block Jiang Wei&#x27;s advance and was not authorised to join Deng Ai in his mission, so he led his force to Baishui County to rendezvous with Zhong Hui. Zhong Hui ordered Tian Zhang () and others to lead a force to bypass the west of Jiange and approach Jiangyou. Along the way, they encountered three groups of Shu ambushers, defeated them and destroyed their camps. Deng Ai let Tian Zhang lead the vanguard and clear the path.

===Fall of Shu===
When Zhong Hui and Zhuge Xu arrived near Jiange, Zhong Hui desired to seize control of Zhuge Xu&#x27;s command, so he secretly reported to the Wei imperial court that Zhuge Xu displayed cowardice in battle. As a result, Zhuge Xu was stripped of his command and sent back to the Wei capital Luoyang, while Zhong Hui took command of his army. Zhong Hui then ordered an attack on Jiange but failed to conquer the mountain pass because the Shu forces put up a strong defence, so he retreated.

In the meantime, Deng Ai and his men reached Mianzhu, where they defeated a Shu army led by Zhuge Zhan, who was killed in action. When Jiang Wei learnt of Zhuge Zhan&#x27;s death, he led his forces east towards Ba Commandery (巴郡; present-day Chongqing). Zhong Hui led his army to Fu County (涪縣; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan) and ordered Hu Lie (), Tian Xu, Pang Hui and others to lead troops to pursue Jiang Wei. At the same time, Deng Ai and his men had arrived outside Chengdu. The Shu emperor Liu Shan surrendered to Deng Ai without putting up a fight, and then gave orders to Jiang Wei to surrender to Zhong Hui. Jiang Wei headed to Fu County, where he ordered his men to lay down their arms and surrender to Zhong Hui.

Following the successful conquest of Shu, Zhong Hui wrote a memorial to the Wei imperial court to report his contributions and urge the government to pacify and restore peace in Shu through benevolent governance. He also gave strict orders forbidding his troops from plundering and pillaging the Shu lands, and treated the former Shu officials in a respectful manner. He got along very well with Jiang Wei.

In the winter of 263–264, the Wei imperial court issued a decree to praise Zhong Hui for his contributions in the conquest of Shu. Zhong Hui was appointed Minister over the Masses, promoted from a village-level marquis to a county-level marquis, and had the number of taxable households in his marquisate increased to 10,000. His two (adoptive) sons were each granted a village marquis title and 1,000 taxable households in their marquisate.

==Downfall and death==
===Arresting Deng Ai===
Zhong Hui had long harboured the intention of rebelling against Wei. When he saw that Deng Ai behaved in an autocratic manner even though his military command was authorised by the Wei imperial court, he secretly reported to the court that Deng was plotting a rebellion. He was skilled in imitating people&#x27;s handwriting. After intercepting a report written by Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court, he edited the report to make it sound arrogant and demanding. At the same time, he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai. The Wei government fell for Zhong Hui&#x27;s ruse and ordered Deng Ai to be arrested and transported back to Luoyang in a prison cart. Sima Zhao was worried that Deng Ai would not submit, so he ordered Zhong Hui and Wei Guan to arrest Deng Ai. With Zhong Hui and his troops following behind, Wei Guan went to Deng Ai&#x27;s camp in Chengdu and used Sima Zhao&#x27;s letter of authorisation to order Deng&#x27;s soldiers to put down their weapons. Deng Ai was arrested and placed in a prison cart.

===Planning===
Zhong Hui had been wary of Deng Ai, so after Deng was arrested, he immediately assumed command of the Wei forces in the former Shu territories. He was overwhelmed by feelings of after seeing that he wielded great power in his hands, so he decided to rebel against Wei. He came up with a strategy for capturing the Wei capital, Luoyang, in the following sequence:
# Jiang Wei would lead a vanguard force out of the Xie Valley () to attack the city of Chang&#x27;an. Zhong Hui would follow behind with the main army and provide support.
# After capturing Chang&#x27;an, the army would be split into two groups – infantry and cavalry. The infantry would sail along the Wei and Yellow rivers towards Meng Ford () near Luoyang while the cavalry would ride towards Luoyang on land. Zhong Hui estimated that the journey would take five days.
# The infantry and cavalry would rendezvous outside Luoyang and attack the city together.

Zhong Hui received a letter from Sima Zhao, which read: &quot;I fear Deng Ai might not submit. I have ordered Jia Chong to lead 10,000 infantry and cavalry into the Xie Valley and station at Lecheng. I will lead 100,000 troops to garrison at Chang&#x27;an. We will be meeting each other soon.&quot; After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, &quot;When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, he knew I was capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours. If we fail, we can retreat back to Shu Han and do as Liu Bei did before us. It is widely known that my plans have never failed once since the Shouchun rebellions. How can I be contented with such fame?&quot;

===Mutiny===

Zhong Hui arrived in Chengdu on 29 February 264. The following day, he summoned all the high-ranking officers and former Shu officers to the old Shu imperial court in the name of holding a memorial service for the recently deceased Empress Dowager Guo. During the service, he showed them an imperial decree and claimed it was issued by the empress dowager before she died. In the decree, Empress Dowager Guo wanted all those who were loyal to Wei to rise up against Sima Zhao and remove him from power. The decree was actually a fake one written by Zhong Hui. Zhong Hui sought the officers&#x27; opinions, asked them to sign on a list if they agreed to carry out the empress dowager&#x27;s dying wish, and then instructed his close aides to take over command of the various military units. He then had all the officers detained in their respective offices with the doors shut, and ordered the gates of the city to be closed and tightly guarded.

Qiu Jian (), an officer serving under Zhong Hui, used to be a subordinate of Hu Lie (). Hu Lie recommended him to Sima Zhao. Zhong Hui favoured and regarded Qiu Jian highly and requested for him to be transferred to his unit. Qiu Jian sympathised with Hu Lie, who was detained alone inside a room, so he approached Zhong Hui and said that each of the detained officers should have a servant to attend to their personal needs. Zhong Hui agreed. Hu Lie lied to his servant and wrote a letter to his sons, in which he claimed he heard from Qiu Jian that Zhong Hui was planning to purge the officers not from his own unit by luring them into a trap and killing them. The rumour spread like wildfire among all the detained officers. When Zhong Hui&#x27;s men received news about the rumour, they suggested to their superior to execute all the officers holding the rank of Cavalry Commandant of the Standard () and above. Zhong Hui could not decide on what to do.

Around noon on 3 March 264, Hu Lie&#x27;s sons and subordinates started beating the drums and their soldiers followed suit. After that, they rushed towards the city gates in a disorderly manner because they had no one to lead them. Around the time, Jiang Wei was collecting his armour and weapons from Zhong Hui when they heard shouting and received news that a fire had broken out. Moments later, it was reported that many soldiers were crowding near the city gates. Zhong Hui was surprised and he asked Jiang Wei, &quot;Those men are causing trouble. What should we do?&quot; Jiang Wei replied, &quot;Kill them.&quot; Zhong Hui then ordered his men to kill the officers who were still detained in their offices. Some of the officers used pieces of furniture to block the doors. Zhong Hui&#x27;s men rammed the doors but could not force them open. A while later, there were reports of people climbing up the city gates on ladders and of people setting fire to buildings. Chaos broke out and arrows were fired in all directions. The detained officers broke out of captivity, regrouped with their men, and attacked Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei fought the mutinying soldiers and slew about five or six of them, but were eventually overwhelmed and killed by them. Zhong Hui was 40 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) when he died. Hundreds of lives were lost in the mutiny.

===Sima Zhao&#x27;s foresight===
Initially, when Sima Zhao wanted to put Zhong Hui in charge of leading the Wei army to conquer Shu, Shao Ti () warned him that Zhong Hui might rebel against Wei because he was in command of an army of thousands, was single, and had no family to worry about. Sima Zhao laughed and said he understood Shao Ti&#x27;s concern very well, but chose to let Zhong Hui lead the Wei army because he had faith in Zhong&#x27;s ability to conquer Shu. He also predicted that Zhong Hui would not succeed even if he rebelled because of two reasons. First, the people of Shu would not support Zhong Hui because they were already fearful after witnessing the fall of Shu. Second, the Wei forces would not support Zhong Hui because they were already exhausted and homesick after the campaign.

Later, after Zhong Hui secretly accused Deng Ai of plotting a rebellion, Sima Zhao wanted to lead his forces to station at Chang&#x27;an. Shao Ti told Sima Zhao that there was no need for him to go to Chang&#x27;an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng Ai. Sima Zhao replied, &quot;Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang&#x27;an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, &#x27;Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?&#x27; I replied, &#x27;If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?&#x27; He could not respond to my reply. Everything will be settled when I arrive in Chang&#x27;an.&quot; By the time Sima Zhao reached Chang&#x27;an, Zhong Hui had already been killed in the mutiny, just as Sima Zhao foresaw.

==Family and relatives==
Zhong Hui&#x27;s father, Zhong Yao, was a prominent politician and calligrapher who held the position of Grand Tutor () in the Wei imperial court. Zhong Hui&#x27;s mother, Zhang Changpu, was one of Zhong Yao&#x27;s concubines and was known for her virtuous conduct, wisdom, and influential role in her son&#x27;s early education.

Zhong Hui&#x27;s elder half-brother, Zhong Yu (), died in the winter of 263. Zhong Hui made no response to the death of his brother. Zhong Yu had four sons: Zhong Jun (), Zhong Yong (), Zhong Yi () and Zhong Chan (). Zhong Yi was raised as Zhong Hui&#x27;s adoptive son because Zhong Hui was single and had no children. Zhong Yong was killed along with his uncle Zhong Hui during the mutiny and his family members were executed. In the aftermath of Zhong Hui&#x27;s failed rebellion, Zhong Jun, Zhong Yi and Zhong Chan were implicated, arrested and placed on death row for their relations to Zhong Hui. However, Sima Zhao took into consideration that Zhong Yao and Zhong Yu had rendered meritorious service to Wei, hence he decided to let them preserve their posterity. He made the Wei emperor Cao Huan issue an imperial decree, which pardoned Zhong Jun and Zhong Chan and restored them to their original official positions and titles. Zhong Yi, however, was executed because he was Zhong Hui&#x27;s adoptive son and was hence not eligible for the pardon.

It is believed that Sima Zhao decided to spare Zhong Jun and Zhong Chan because Zhong Yu once warned him that Zhong Hui was manipulative and should not be placed in positions with great power. Sima Zhao laughed, praised Zhong Yu for his honest advice, and promised that he would spare Zhong Yu&#x27;s family if Zhong Hui really did commit treason.

==Appraisal==

===Chen Shou===
Chen Shou, who wrote Zhong Hui&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), praised him as &quot;knowledgeable and skilled with numerological operations&quot;, as he mentioned Zhong Hui was once as famous as the philosopher Wang Bi when they were young. He then lumped Zhong Hui together with Wang Ling, Guanqiu Jian, and Zhuge Dan in his criticism: &quot;They were famous for their various talents, which helped them rise to high positions. It was a pity that 
they were overly ambitious, had morally crooked ideas, and failed to recognise the hidden pitfalls around them. These resulted in their downfalls and the extermination of their families. Can it be any more fatuous than this?&quot;

===Xiahou Ba===
The &quot;Shiyu&quot; recorded that when the Wei general Xiahou Ba defected to Shu, the Shu officials asked him, &quot;What does Sima Yi do best?&quot; Xiahou Ba replied, &quot;Solidifying his family&#x27;s position in Wei.&quot; They asked him again, &quot;Who are the talents in the Wei capital?&quot; Xiahou Ba replied, &quot;There&#x27;s one Zhong Shiji. Wu and Shu should be worried if he&#x27;s in charge of the Wei government.&quot;

The &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot; mentioned that the Shu general Jiang Wei also asked Xiahou Ba, &quot;Now that Sima Yi is in control of the Wei government, is he still planning to launch any campaigns against Shu and Wu?&quot; Xiahou Ba replied, &quot;He focuses on strengthening his family&#x27;s control of the Wei government and doesn&#x27;t have time to bother about external affairs. However, there&#x27;s one Zhong Shiji. He may be young, but he&#x27;ll definitely become a threat to Wu and Shu in the future. Despite so, even the most extraordinary people can&#x27;t control him.&quot; Xiahou Ba was proven right 15 years later because Zhong Hui was one of the key figures in the Wei conquest of Shu.

Pei Songzhi added the &quot;Shiyu&quot; account to support what Xi Zuochi wrote in the &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Zhong Hui is first introduced as a playable character in the seventh instalment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series.

<text>The Battle for Wesnoth is a free and open-source turn-based strategy video game with a high fantasy setting (similar to J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium), designed by Australian-American developer David White and first released in June 2003. In &quot;Wesnoth&quot;, the player controls a particular faction/race and attempts to build a powerful army by controlling villages and defeating enemies for experience. The game is loosely based on the Sega Genesis games &quot;Master of Monsters&quot; and &quot;Warsong&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; is a turn-based wargame played on a hex map. The strategy of battle involves trying to fight on favorable terrain, at a favorable time of day, and, if possible, with units that are strong or well suited against the enemies. Other concerns are capturing villages that produce a particular trickle rate of gold per turn for unit recruitment, and positioning units to restrict enemy movement. Games of &quot;Wesnoth&quot; come both in the form of single-player campaigns and multiplayer matches. The goal of these games is usually to defeat all enemy leaders, but there may be other goals.

Each unit in &quot;Wesnoth&quot; has its own strengths and weaknesses. A unit&#x27;s defense (which this case means dodge chance) is based on the terrain it stands on. Elves, for example, are difficult to hit when fighting in a forest. Different types of attacks (melee and ranged), weapon types (pierce, blade, impact, arcane, cold, and fire), and a day-night cycle (in most maps) that alternately favors lawful and chaotic units, altering the amount of damage a unit deals. Units can advance to higher level counterparts and become more powerful as they participate in combat.

A central design philosophy of the game is the KISS principle; for a new idea to be accepted, it should not complicate gameplay. Another important facet of the game is randomness and its manipulation: it is never certain whether a unit&#x27;s attack will fail or succeed, only likely or unlikely. Developers have stated that the potential for a skirmish to go better or worse than expected adds excitement, replayability and strategic depth to the game.

==Setting==

&quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; takes place in a world populated by Tolkienesque races such as humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, and trolls, as well as &quot;Wesnoth&quot;-specific races such as dragon-like Drakes, which are creatures distantly related to dragons, but are bipedal, have an organized, albeit warlike, culture, and are only about 10 feet tall. Campaign stories span the history and geography of the world, but most focus on the eponymous human kingdom of Wesnoth, which suffers frequent invasions of orcish raiders and the undead.

The name &quot;Wesnoth&quot; was originally developed by the game&#x27;s creator as a combination of syllables that he thought would sound good as a name for a fantasy land. When the project became larger and more elaborate, the developers created a fictional etymology for the name: the inhabitants of the land of Wesnoth came from the West and North, giving Westnorth, which eventually evolved to Wesnoth. This etymology is explained in the campaign &quot;The Rise of Wesnoth&quot;.

===Factions===

&quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; currently has six default factions to choose from:

* Rebels
: Consist mostly of elvish units, with ent-like woses, mermen, and mages. Most of their level 1 units are capable of both melee and ranged attacks, making the rebels very versatile. Elves ignore the time of day with their neutral alignment and have high defense in forests. They are generally faster, but slightly weaker than other units in most other terrain.
* Knalgan Alliance
: These consist of slow but sturdy dwarves with strong melee attacks, allied with human outlaws who fight better under the cover of darkness. Generally, dwarves gain a high defense when occupying mountains and hills. Dwarves are also more adept at traversing caves than any other faction and ignore the time of day. They are vulnerable to attack in open terrain, while their human outlaws fight better in this same terrain.
* Loyalists
: These are human cavalry, mages and infantry that ordinarily fight better in the daytime, with mermen allies. They are the most diverse faction, with more units than any other faction except the Knalgan Alliance.
* Northerners
: A faction of orcs and goblins, along with troll and naga allies. Their focus is on cheap recruiting, brute force, and close combat, fighting better at night with their chaotic alignment. Most units require little XP (fighting experience) to advance levels. Units often achieve higher mobility when crossing hills.
* Undead
: The undead are vulnerable to fire, impact, and arcane attacks, but have high resistance against blade, pierce and especially cold damage. The undead rely on easy access to magic and poison attacks. Some units are able to drain health from enemies in order to replenish their own, and most are immune to poisoning. Unlike other races, most undead units have no traits and no personal names.
* Drakes
: A dragon-like race that fights better by day. Most can fly and breathe fire. Their Saurian allies are faster and prefer fighting by night and in swamp areas, though they share the Drakes&#x27; vulnerability to cold. Drakes are the most maneuverable faction, though their size makes them prone to attack in most terrain.
* Dunefolk
: The dunefolk are the newest faction added to Wesnoth. The main dunefolk include: Dune Burner, Dune Herbalist, Dune Rider, Dune Rover, Dune Skirmisher, Dune Soldier, and their allies the Naga Dirkfang. Little is known about them. They are groups of humans that live in the desert.

The exact units used by the factions, and the faction names, change based on the era or the campaign. The above are the factions of the &quot;Default&quot; era, which is the most played one on the multiplayer servers, and its extension &quot;Age Of Heroes&quot;.

There are also a number of user-created factions, several of which are grouped together in downloadable &quot;Eras&quot;. For example, the Imperial Era includes the Roman-influenced Lavinians, the Marauders, and the Wild Elves, featuring completely new unit trees and abilities. An alternative era, which contains the Islam-influenced faction Khalifate, was integrated (as of January 2014) in the official development line, &quot;Wesnoth&quot; 1.11.8, tested to become part of the mainline version. This faction has since been renamed to the Dunefolk in version 1.13.11. It is quite possible to create factions that can be used in the default eras, though the amount of blessing given by the creators for each may vary.

===Campaigns===
The stable version of &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; comes with 16 single-player campaigns and a tutorial, each of which has various difficulty levels. More user-authored campaigns can be obtained in the form of add-ons stored on Wesnoth&#x27;s campaign server, and these are sometimes mainlined as official campaigns. The original campaign for &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; was &quot;Heir to the Throne&quot;, a campaign with 23 gameplay scenarios where Konrad, a young heir to the throne of Wesnoth, allies with rebellious elves and other races to claim the throne from the usurper queen Asheviere, her loyalist army, and her orcish mercenaries. Characters from &quot;Heir to the Throne&quot; are protagonists in campaigns such as &quot;Legend of Wesmere&quot; and &quot;Delfador&#x27;s Memoirs&quot;. Other campaigns feature different factions, like the dwarves in &quot;The Hammer of Thursagan&quot; or &quot;Northern Rebirth&quot; or &quot;Sceptre of Fire&quot;, the loyalist army of Wesnoth in &quot;The South Guard&quot; or &quot;The Eastern Invasion&quot;, and undead in &quot;Descent into Darkness&quot; or &quot;Secrets of the Ancients&quot;. Even mermen can be played in &quot;Dead Water&quot;, or orcs in &quot;Son of the Black Eye&quot;. Finally, &quot;Under the Burning Suns&quot; is set in the distant future, long after the time of the other campaigns, featuring elves who fight better during the day.

A multiplayer campaign titled &quot;World of Conquest&quot; is added to the game on version 1.16 after previously being an unofficial add-on. A drake campaign named &quot;Winds of Fate&quot; was added to the game in version 1.18.

==== Unofficial campaigns ====
Many official campaigns were only user-made add-ons, for example &quot;An Orcish Incursion&quot;, which has been removed from the mainline in 1.15.3. Unofficial campaigns are translated into many languages the same way as the official ones. Some of them are very long and well balanced, like &quot;Invasion from Unknown&quot;, while others serve to show units not available in the mainline, or as examples for future campaign makers, like &quot;A simple campaign&quot;, &quot;WML Guide&quot; or &quot;The Final Exam&quot;. The longest unofficial campaigns have more translatable strings than the longest official campaigns.

==Modding==
===Add-ons===
It is possible to create and distribute additional content (user made content, or UMC), such as campaigns, maps and multiplayer &quot;eras&quot; using an &quot;add-on&quot; system. These add-ons can be downloaded, updated and removed using an in-game add-on server; alternatively, they can be installed and updated by manually downloading the add-on&#x27;s files and placing them in the appropriate directory, or they can be removed by deleting these files.

===Editor===
&quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; has a built-in map editor, which supports features such as multiple open maps and random map generation. The editor supports all in-game terrains, as well as custom terrains created for campaigns. The time of day can be selected from one of the built-in presets or custom lighting can be created.

===WML===
Using any standard text editor, new content can be created using what is known as &quot;Wesnoth Markup Language&quot; (WML). As its name suggests, WML is similar to XML and other markup languages in syntax with tags defining events and sides in a scenario. WML has evolved from what was a simple markup/configuration language into a specialized programming language designed for easily modifying the game. Examples for the latest stable version are offered on the site&#x27;s wiki.

===Lua===
From the 1.7 development version upwards, code in Lua can be embedded in WML events which gets executed when those events fire. From 1.7.14 on, Lua can also be used to create alternate (or supplemental) AI implementations.

==Development==

David White began development of &quot;Wesnoth&quot; because he wanted to create a freely available, open source strategy game with very simple rules, but one that had difficult to beat artificial intelligence and that was challenging and fun — a game that was easy to learn but hard to master.

The game is programmed in C++. It is cross-platform, and runs on AmigaOS 4, BeOS, FreeBSD, Linux (including OS flavors running on GP2X and Nokia n800, n810, and n900 handheld devices), OS X/Darwin, Windows, MorphOS, NetBSD, OpenBSD, RISC OS, iOS, Solaris/illumos, Android, Playbook and Google Native Client running under Google Chrome.

&quot;Wesnoth&quot; development is decentralized due to its free and open-source nature. The officially blessed campaigns and units bundled with the game download are often derived from content created by the community, somewhat differently from the user-generated content in proprietary games where such content, while available, is usually not incorporated into official builds of the game. The &quot;Wesnoth&quot; forums and wiki are used to develop new campaigns, including new unit types and story artwork. The game is able to download new campaigns from a central add-on server. Content featured on the official campaign server must be licensed under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later, like the game itself.

Even when not counting this community content, the list of contributors to the official version of the game as displayed in-game contains over 550 unique entries (May 2010). Developers of the game also include well-known authors from the free software and open source scene, like the co-founder of the Open Source Initiative and core Linux kernel developer Eric S. Raymond, or Linux kernel programmer Rusty Russell.

As of July 2024, &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; is available in 56 languages, 7 of which have more than 90% of messages translated.

===Active developers===
As of July 2015, &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; development team consisted of no more than five developers. On the homepage for the game, it was stated that the reason for a lack of bug fixes was that a few developers worked on each new version of the game and the engine itself, and that the project was understaffed.

In September 2021, project manager Pentarctagon released a statement on the Wesnoth Forums claiming that &quot;Wesnoth&quot; had a better internal structure than before, yet still called the project &quot;chronically understaffed&quot;.

===Art===
The art development team was founded by Francisco Muñoz, and directed by Richard Kettering with Hogne Håskjold as the director of terrain art. The current set of portraits were designed primarily by Kathrin Polikeit and Emilien Rotival, replacing the older set of comic-style portraits done by Jason Lutes. Most artwork is stored in the portable network graphics format and all are licensed under the GNU General Public License.

===Music===
The musical style of the game&#x27;s soundtrack is orchestral, with a symphony of strings, brass, winds, percussion, and occasionally ethnic instruments when the game allows for it, covering a variety of genre and periods. Because the themes are based on traditional and medieval styles, the music development department rejects all music with synths, loops, drum kits, electric guitars, or any pop/rock instruments. Because &quot;Wesnoth&quot; has no budget and relies completely on volunteer composers, its soundtrack is entirely synthesized.

The music development team is currently headed by Mattias Westlund and includes some well-known composers like Doug Kaufman and Timothy Pinkham and the game&#x27;s soundtrack is licensed as free music under the GNU General Public License and rendered in the Ogg Vorbis format. Because the game is constantly evolving, the current list of soundtracks evolves.

====Notes====
===Releases===
The first development release of &quot;Wesnoth&quot; 0.1 was released on June 18, 2003. In October 2005, the game reached its 1.0 milestone release. On January 29, 2012, version 1.10 was released and introduced the campaign &quot;Dead Water&quot;.

In January 2014, a new faction under the name of the Khalifate was added in a development release. It was intended offer new multiplayer options. Khalifate units use no magic, but instead are intended to rely on careful use of terrain and coordinated strikes around dusk or dawn. This faction was released as part of version 1.12 in November of the same year. The Khalifate were renamed to Dunefolk in version 1.13.11.

On May 2, 2018, version 1.14.0 was released. This update introduced the campaign &quot;Secrets of the Ancients&quot;. It also made major changes to the desert elves seen in the campaign &quot;Under the Burning Suns&quot;. Many units have had changes, such as new portraits and animations. In October 2021 version 1.16 was released. It included many changes to old campaigns such as &quot;The Hammer of Thursagan&quot; as well changes to the Dunefolk faction. In March 2024, version 1.18 was released, adding a new campaign named &quot;Winds of Fate&quot;.

Aside of the stand-alone source and binary releases, &quot;Wesnoth&quot; was previously made available through the Desura digital distribution service. &quot;Wesnoth&quot; was submitted to Steam Greenlight on July 23, 2016, and was subsequently approved for release by the Steam community. With the release of v1.14.0, the game became then available on Steam in May 2018. At the same time, registration was made mandatory for playing on the official server.

====Development version====
Besides the official wesnoth game version, there is always an alternative development version, that introduces more new features and improvements for players and content creators. This development version is rolling subject to further tweaking and polishing, depending on the wesnoth community feedback. The current development version is 1.19. Several campaigns are expected to be reworked in this version, such as &quot;The South Guard&quot; and &quot;The Rise of Wesnoth&quot;.

==Reception==
Reviews for &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; have generally been positive. In a 2006 review of version 1.1 of the game, Gametunnel rated it a 7/10, adding that &quot;it may seem like a game that belongs in the nineties, but it is engaging and very well put together&quot;.

In a 2007 review of version 1.2.6, Phoronix rated it 9/10, calling it &quot;a must-download game for any gamer&quot;. In 2008 APCMag.com named &quot;The Battle for Wesnoth&quot; among the &quot;Top 5 best (free) open source games&quot;.

In 2010, Full Circle Magazine reviewed the game in Podcast #4. The reviewers called &quot;Wesnoth&quot; a &quot;very good game&quot;, calling the graphics &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;easy to understand&quot; but &quot;dated&quot;. The reviewers called the gameplay &quot;pure and simple&quot;, but complained about the role of chance in the game, making it an &quot;exercise in frustration&quot;, and requiring a policy of reloading and replaying the game that turns &quot;Wesnoth&quot; into a &quot;challenge of patience rather than brainpower&quot;.

In 2010, RPGFan gave it an 88/100, mentioning that &quot;despite its generous price tag, BfW offers more quality and quantity than almost any commercial title available&quot;.

The game was described in-detail in the 2012 book &quot;The Architecture of Open Source Applications&quot;.

Various versions of &quot;Wesnoth&quot; have been downloaded from the central download site SourceForge over eight million times between 2003 and May 2024. Multiple other freeware download outlets delivered the game additionally hundred thousand times; for instance MacUpdate counted over 80,000 downloads of the macOS version alone, while Softonic counted another 40,000 downloads.

<text>Formal equivalence checking process is a part of electronic design automation (EDA), commonly used during the development of digital integrated circuits, to formally prove that two representations of a circuit design exhibit exactly the same behavior.

== Equivalence checking and levels of abstraction ==

In general, there is a wide range of possible definitions of functional equivalence covering comparisons between different levels of abstraction and varying granularity of timing details. 
*The most common approach is to consider the problem of machine equivalence which defines two synchronous design specifications functionally equivalent if, clock by clock, they produce &quot;exactly&quot; the same sequence of output signals for &quot;any&quot; valid sequence of input signals. 
*Microprocessor designers use equivalence checking to compare the functions specified for the instruction set architecture (ISA) with a register transfer level (RTL) implementation, ensuring that any program executed on both models will cause an identical update of the main memory content. This is a more general problem.
*A system design flow requires comparison between a transaction level model (TLM), e.g., written in SystemC and its corresponding RTL specification. Such a check is becoming of increasing interest in a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design environment.

== Synchronous machine equivalence ==
The register transfer level (RTL) behavior of a digital chip is usually described with a hardware description language, such as Verilog or VHDL. This description is the golden reference model that describes in detail which operations will be executed during which clock cycle and by which pieces of hardware. Once the logic designers, by simulations and other verification methods, have verified register transfer description, the design is usually converted into a netlist by a logic synthesis tool. Equivalence is not to be confused with functional correctness, which must be determined by functional verification.

The initial netlist will usually undergo a number of transformations such as optimization, addition of Design For Test (DFT) structures, etc., before it is used as the basis for the placement of the logic elements into a physical layout. Contemporary physical design software will occasionally also make significant modifications (such as replacing logic elements with equivalent similar elements that have a higher or lower drive strength and/or area) to the netlist. Throughout every step of a very complex, multi-step procedure, the original functionality and the behavior described by the original code must be maintained. When the final tape-out is made of a digital chip, many different EDA programs and possibly some manual edits will have altered the netlist.

In theory, a logic synthesis tool guarantees that the first netlist is logically equivalent to the RTL source code. All the programs later in the process that make changes to the netlist also, in theory, ensure that these changes are logically equivalent to a previous version.

In practice, programs have bugs and it would be a major risk to assume that all steps from RTL through the final tape-out netlist have been performed without error. Also, in real life, it is common for designers to make manual changes to a netlist, commonly known as Engineering Change Orders, or ECOs, thereby introducing a major additional error factor. Therefore, instead of blindly assuming that no mistakes were made, a verification step is needed to check the logical equivalence of the final version of the netlist to the original description of the design (golden reference model).

Historically, one way to check the equivalence was to re-simulate, using the final netlist, the test cases that were developed for verifying the correctness of the RTL. This process is called gate level logic simulation. However, the problem with this is that the quality of the check is only as good as the quality of the test cases. Also, gate-level simulations are notoriously slow to execute, which is a major problem as the size of digital designs continues to grow exponentially.

An alternative way to solve this is to formally prove that the RTL code and the netlist synthesized from it have exactly the same behavior in all (relevant) cases. This process is called formal equivalence checking and is a problem that is studied under the broader area of formal verification.

A formal equivalence check can be performed between any two representations of a design: RTL &lt;&gt; netlist, netlist &lt;&gt; netlist or RTL &lt;&gt; RTL, though the latter is rare compared to the first two. Typically, a formal equivalence checking tool will also indicate with great precision at which point there exists a difference between two representations.

== Methods ==
There are two basic technologies used for boolean reasoning in equivalence checking programs:
*Binary decision diagrams, or BDDs: A specialized data structure designed to support reasoning about boolean functions. BDDs have become highly popular because of their efficiency and versatility.
*Conjunctive Normal Form Satisfiability: SAT solvers returns an assignment to the variables of a propositional formula that satisfies it if such an assignment exists. Almost any boolean reasoning problem can be expressed as a SAT problem.

== Commercial applications for equivalence checking ==
Major products in the Logic Equivalence Checking (&quot;LEC&quot;) area of &quot;EDA&quot; are:

* &quot;FormalPro&quot; by Mentor Graphics
* &quot;Questa SLEC&quot; by Mentor Graphics
* &quot;Conformal&quot; by Cadence
* &quot;Jasper&quot; by Cadence
* &quot;Formality&quot; by Synopsys
* &quot;VC Formal&quot; by Synopsys
* &quot;360 EC&quot; by OneSpin Solutions
* &quot;ATEC&quot; by ATEC

== Generalizations ==
*Equivalence Checking of Retimed Circuits: Sometimes it is helpful to move logic from one side of a register to another, and this complicates the checking problem.
*Sequential Equivalence Checking: Sometimes, two machines are completely different at the combinational level, but should give the same outputs if given the same inputs. The classic example is two identical state machines with different encodings for the states. Since this cannot be reduced to a combinational problem, more general techniques are required.
*Equivalence of Software Programs, i.e. checking if two well-defined programs that take N inputs and produce M outputs are equivalent: Conceptually, you can turn software into a state machine (that&#x27;s what the combination of a compiler does, since a computer plus its memory form a very large state machine.) Then, in theory, various forms of property checking can ensure they produce the same output. This problem is even harder than sequential equivalence checking, since the outputs of the two programs may appear at different times; but it is possible, and researchers are working on it.

<doc id="1046027" wikidata="Q520072" url="?curid=1046027" title="Andy Borowitz">
<text>Andy Borowitz (born January 4, 1958) is an American writer, comedian, satirist, and actor. Borowitz is a &quot;New York Times&quot;-bestselling author who won the first National Press Club award for humor. He is known for creating the NBC sitcom &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; and the satirical column &quot;The Borowitz Report&quot;.

==Early life==
Borowitz was born to a marginally observant Reform Jewish family in Shaker Heights, Ohio, and graduated from Shaker Heights High School.

In 1980, Borowitz graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Harvard College, where he lived in Adams House and was president of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;. He also wrote for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals. Borowitz studied with playwright William Alfred and wrote his undergraduate thesis on Restoration comedy.

==Career==

=== Hollywood===
After graduating from Harvard, Borowitz moved to Los Angeles to work for producer Bud Yorkin at Tandem Productions, the company Yorkin co-founded with producer Norman Lear. From 1982 through 1983, he wrote for the television series &quot;Square Pegs&quot;, starring Sarah Jessica Parker. From 1983 through 1984, he wrote for the television series &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. He wrote for various television series through the 1980s.

During his marriage to writer and producer Susan Borowitz (1982–2005), the two co-created &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,&quot; which ran for six seasons on NBC and launched the acting career of Will Smith. The series won NAACP&#x27;s Image Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 1993.

In 1998, Borowitz co-produced the film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, starring Reese Witherspoon, Tobey Maguire, William H. Macy, Joan Allen, and Jeff Daniels. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, and Best Music, Original Dramatic Score.

In 2004 Borowitz appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Melinda and Melinda,&quot; starring Will Ferrell, and in &quot;Marie and Bruce&quot;, starring Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick. &quot;Marie and Bruce&quot; was co-written by Wallace Shawn and director Tom Cairns. In 2007 he appeared in the film &quot;Fired!&quot;

=== Political satire ===
In the late 1990s, Borowitz began e-mailing humorous news parodies to friends. In 2001, he founded &quot;The Borowitz Report&quot;, a site that posts one 250-word news satire every weekday. The site led to greater fame and widespread attention for Borowitz as a political satirist. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; devoted a page-one story to him and his site in 2003 and readership ultimately grew to the millions. In 2005, the newspaper syndicator Creators Syndicate began syndicating &quot;The Borowitz Report&quot; to dozens of major newspapers, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. It is also one of the longest-running features at the &quot;Newsweek&quot; website. He has served as a commentator on the National Public Radio programs &quot;Weekend Edition Sunday&quot; and &quot;Wait Wait… Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, the latter on November 12, 2006. Borowitz is also a regular contributor to humor newspaper &quot;Funny Times&quot;.

In 2007, he started blogging for the &quot;Huffington Post&quot;. His posts were featured on the home page of the blog and quickly became one of its most popular features. His popularity surged during the 2008 campaign, leading &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; to call him &quot;America&#x27;s satire king&quot;.

In 2009, The Borowitz Report began a Twitter feed, which was voted the number-one Twitter account in the world in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine poll in 2011. Eventually, he abandoned the feed.

On July 18, 2012, Borowitz announced that &quot;The New Yorker&quot; had acquired the Borowitz Report website, the first time that the magazine had ever made such an acquisition. In its first 24 hours as a &quot;New Yorker&quot; feature, &quot;The Borowitz Report&quot; garnered the most page views on the entire &quot;New Yorker&quot; website.

=== Television performer ===
In 2002, Borowitz joined the staff of CNN&#x27;s &quot;American Morning&quot; and soon appeared on the program three mornings a week. In 2004, he covered the Democratic National Convention for the channel, paired with comedian Lewis Black of &quot;The Daily Show&quot;. He has made numerous appearances on other television programs including &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, &quot;Best Week Ever&quot; on VH1 and &quot;Live at Gotham&quot; on Comedy Central.

In 2010, Borowitz appeared on the PBS show &quot;Need to Know&quot;. Tom Shales, television critic for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, singled out Borowitz for praise, calling him &quot;one of the wittiest Web wags&quot;.

===Stand-up comedy===
Borowitz&#x27;s success as a television performer led to his becoming a strong draw as a stand-up comedian, and he started headlining at major comedy clubs across the country, including Carolines on Broadway, where he hosts a monthly show called &quot;Next Week&#x27;s News&quot;. Other major comedians who have appeared with him in that show include Amy Sedaris and Susie Essman.

For four consecutive years starting in 2004, he performed at The Comedy Festival in Aspen, Colorado.

In September 2007, he headlined an edition of Next Week&#x27;s News at the Bumbershoot festival in Seattle, Washington, performing to standing-room-only audiences and critical acclaim in the press, including the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;. He also performed to a sold-out house at the 2007 New York Comedy Festival, which featured other prominent comedians including Denis Leary, Bill Maher, and Sarah Silverman.

In 2008, he hosted a series of sold-out shows at New York City&#x27;s 92nd Street Y called &quot;Countdown to the Election&quot;. The show earned rave reviews and featured such guests as Arianna Huffington, Mo Rocca, Jonathan Alter, Joy Behar, and Jeffrey Toobin.

He continued to tour the country performing stand-up, including a performance at the University of California, Santa Barbara in April 2008. The university newspaper, &quot;Daily Nexus&quot;, reported that Borowitz played to a packed house and had the audience &quot;erupting with laughter&quot;.
Comedian Mike Birbiglia praised Borowitz in a May 2009 profile in &quot;Harvard Magazine&quot;: &quot;Andy just picked up stand-up comedy as a hobby, and he&#x27;s as good at it as anybody.&quot;

On November 28, 2010, &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; aired a retrospective of his career as a comedian and writer, calling him &quot;one of the funniest people in America&quot;.

On June 28, 2011, he performed at New York City&#x27;s Central Park Summerstage and drew a crowd estimated at 5,000, setting a new record for turnout at a Summerstage spoken-word event.

===&quot;The New Yorker&quot;===
In 1998, Borowitz began contributing humor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine. He quickly became one of the magazine&#x27;s most prolific humor contributors, writing dozens of essays including &quot;Emily Dickinson, Jerk of Amherst&quot;, selected as one of the funniest humor pieces in the magazine&#x27;s history and included in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s humor collection &quot;Fierce Pajamas&quot;. Two more humor pieces of his appeared in the magazine&#x27;s 2008 collection &quot;Disquiet, Please!&quot; He has also performed at The New Yorker Festival&#x27;s humor revues at The Town Hall in New York City with such other &quot;New Yorker&quot; contributors as Woody Allen, Steve Martin, and Calvin Trillin. Additionally, he has joined &quot;The New Yorker&quot; College Tour, where he has performed with improv group The Second City and David Sedaris.

In addition to writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Borowitz has written for many other magazines, including &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and &quot;The Believer&quot;, and was a primary contributor to the cult magazine &quot;Army Man&quot;.

===National Book Awards===
In 2009, Borowitz was chosen by the National Book Foundation to host the National Book Awards in New York City. Previous hosts have included such comedians and writers as Steve Martin and Garrison Keillor. His performance earned him a return engagement for the 2010 awards ceremony.

===The 50 Funniest American Writers===
In 2011, Library of America chose Borowitz to edit an anthology of American humor, &quot;The 50 Funniest American Writers&quot;. Encompassing American humor from Mark Twain to &quot;The Onion&quot;, the book was set to be released on October 13, 2011. It became a best seller on the day of its publication, reaching number eight on Amazon.com and becoming the number-one humor book in the United States. It also became the first book in the 32-year history of the Library of America to become a &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; bestseller. Both Barnes &amp; Noble and Amazon.com named it a Best Book of 2011, and Amazon.com named it the number-one Entertainment Book of the Year. In a feature about the book, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted its popular success, calling Borowitz &quot;America&#x27;s finest fake-news creator and sharpest political satirist&quot;.

===&quot;An Unexpected Twist&quot;===
In 2012, Borowitz wrote his first autobiographical work, &quot;An Unexpected Twist&quot;, an Amazon Kindle single. The essay recounts Borowitz&#x27;s near-death experience in 2008 while undergoing emergency abdominal surgery in New York City. A mixture of dark comedy, hospital drama and love story, the book became a bestseller on its first day of release, placing number one on Amazon&#x27;s Kindle Single chart. It became the first nonfiction Kindle Single to make &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; bestseller list, debuting at number six.

In his book review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Dwight Garner wrote, &quot;Andy Borowitz is the funniest human on Twitter, and that&#x27;s not mean praise. His first original e-book—the current best-selling Single—is a seriocomic memoir call&quot;ed An Unexpected Twist&quot;, about a blockage in his colon that nearly killed him. This funny book has a sneaky emotional gravity. As the time of his illness, he&#x27;d been married only a few months, and his small book becomes a rather large love story.&quot;

In his review of the book, journalist Seth Mnookin wrote, &quot;Borowitz has become one of the most lauded satirists in the country—think of him as a literary Jon Stewart. His name graces the cover of one of the most successful Library of America volumes ever (The 50 Funniest American Writers* (*According to Andy Borowitz)). He was voted by Time magazine readers as having the #1 Twitter feed in the world. He even hosted the National Book Awards—twice… It&#x27;s no surprise that Borowitz is able to mine his situation for humor. What makes &quot;An Unexpected Twist&quot; even more satisfying is his ability to highlight some of the surreal and infuriating aspects of modern American medical care without hitting the reader over the head with them.&quot;

On June 25, 2012, Amazon named &quot;An Unexpected Twist&quot; the Best Kindle Single of 2012.

===Other===
Since 1999, Borowitz has been the primary host of &quot;The Moth&quot;, a New York-based storytelling group. He sings with the literary rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, a group with a rotating cast of players including Dave Barry, Matt Groening, Roy Blount Jr., Stephen King, Amy Tan, Robert Fulghum, Barbara Kingsolver, and Scott Turow. He has taught screenwriting in the United States and Europe and is on the guest faculty of the Maurits Binger Film Institute in Amsterdam.

In October 2012, he became the host of the BBC comedy series &quot;News Quiz USA&quot;. The hit comedy series has millions of listeners on BBC Radio 4 in the U.K. and is broadcast on the public radio station WNYC in New York.

==Personal life==
He was married to Susan Borowitz, the co-creator of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. After their divorce he married Olivia Gentile, the author of &quot;Life List: A Woman&#x27;s Quest for the World&#x27;s Most Amazing Birds&quot;. He has three children and lives in Hanover, New Hampshire.

<text>Adonis (born Michael A. Smith, current legal name Adonis M. Smith; January 4, 1963) is a pioneering American acid house musician. Adonis is best known for his early Chicago house tracks &quot;No Way Back&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Rockin Down the House&quot;.

==Musical career==
Born and raised on the West Side of Chicago, Adonis was introduced to music at a young age. He studied contemporary jazz at the American Conservatory of Music. Later on, he played bass guitar in several R&amp;B bands and was eventually introduced to the house scene in Chicago through hearing Jesse Saunders&#x27; &quot;On and On&quot;.

As Michael A. Smith, he was a member of the band Clockwork. They recorded &quot;I&#x27;m Your Candy Girl&quot; (1984), a post-disco boogie song.

In 1986, Adonis released &quot;No Way Back&quot;, which is considered to be one of the most influential Chicago house tracks. The single, by estimate, sold over 100,000 copies and was selected as number 14 by on the 2014 Rolling Stone list of the 20 best Chicago house records.

<text>The Battle of Graus was a battle of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, traditionally said to have taken place on 8 May 1063. Either in or as a result of the battle, King Ramiro I of Aragon died.

Antonio Ubieto Arteta, in his &quot;Historia de Aragón&quot;, re-dated the battle to 1069. The late twelfth-century &quot;Chronica naierensis&quot; dates the encounter to 1070.

Ramiro&#x27;s first attempt to take Graus, the northernmost Muslim outpost in the valley of the Cinca, took place in 1055, probably in response to the defeat of García Sánchez III of Navarre at Atapuerca the year before (1054), which placed Ferdinand I of León and Castile in a commanding position against Ramiro&#x27;s western border and the Muslim Taifa of Zaragoza to his south. His first expedition against Graus failed, and in 1059 Ferdinand succeeded in extorting &quot;parias&quot; (tribute) from Zaragoza. Ramiro marched on Graus again in the spring of 1063, but this time the Zaragozans had with them 300 Castilian knights under the &quot;infante&quot; Sancho the Strong and (possibly) his general Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, better known as El Cid. The presence of the Cid at the battle is based on a single source, the generally reliable &quot;Historia Roderici&quot;, which alleges that he was the &quot;alférez&quot; of Sancho at the time. Considering the rarity of the Cid&#x27;s name in the documents of the early 1060s, this is unlikely.

The circumstances of the actual battle are obscure. Reinhart Dozy argued that Ramiro survived four months after the battle and that neither the Cid nor Sancho took any part in it. The &quot;Fragmentum historicum ex cartulario Alaonis&quot; records only that &quot;occisus est a mauris in bello apud Gradus&quot; (he [Ramiro] was killed by the Moors in war near Graus), with no mention of the Castilians. The aforementioned &quot;Chronica naierensis&quot; contains an account generally, though not universally, regarded as a legend: that Sancho Garcés, an illegitimate son of García Sánchez III of Navarre, eloped with the daughter of García&#x27;s wife, Stephanie (probably by an earlier marriage), who was the fiancée of the Castilian &quot;infante&quot; Sancho, and that he sought refuge at the court first of Zaragoza, then later of Aragon. Sancho, to avenge the disruption of his marriage plans, marched against Ramiro and Zaragoza, and Ramiro died in the encounter near &quot;the place called Graus&quot; (&quot;loco qui Gradus dicitur&quot;) in 1064 or 1070. According to the Arabic historian al-Turtūshī, Ramiro (misidentified as &quot;Ibn Rudmīr&quot;, the son of Ramiro) was assassinated by a Muslim soldier who spoke the Christians&#x27; language and infiltrated the Aragonese camp.

Charles Bishko, summarising the position of Pierre Boissonnade, explains how the battle of Graus gave impetus to the War of Barbastro of the next year:

. . . the expedition against Barbastro is above all a French crusade, inspired by Cluny and launched through Cluny&#x27;s persuasion by the papacy of Alexander II, the purpose of which is to preserve a hard-pressed Aragonese kingdom from imminent invasion and possible destruction at the hands of the Muslims, following Ramiro I&#x27;s shattering defeat and death at Graus on 8 May 1063. Graus, in this Hispanic prelude to the Palestinian &quot;gesta Dei per Francos&quot;, serves as an Iberian Manzikert, with King Sancho Ramírez—like the legates of the Emperor Alexius Comnenus at Piacenza—appealing in desperation for papal and Frankish succor. . .

Graus was finally taken by Sancho Ramírez, Ramiro&#x27;s successor, in 1083.

<doc id="1046058" wikidata="Q429733" url="?curid=1046058" title="Wally Joyner">
<text>Wallace Keith Joyner (born June 16, 1962) is an American former professional baseball player. He played for four major league teams during a 16-year career, most notably for the California Angels, for whom he was an All-Star. He was a member of the pennant-winning 1998 San Diego Padres.

==Early life and career==
Joyner attended Redan High School in Stone Mountain, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. He attended college at Brigham Young University. In the 1983 MLB draft, the California Angels selected Joyner in the third round as a compensation pick from the New York Yankees for signing Don Baylor.

Joyner credited a stint with the Mayagüez Indians of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League as fundamental in his improvement as a slugger. Then-batting coach José Manuel Morales forced him to do power weight training and modify his posture at the batting cage, so as to develop upper body strength. He gained 10 pounds of muscle as a result of his workouts. He was consequently the top hitter on Puerto Rico&#x27;s winter league on the 1985–86 season, winning the Triple Crown (.356, 14 HR, 48 RBI) in 54 games.

==California Angels==
During his rookie season with the California Angels, Joyner became a fan favorite and briefly inspired a sensation in which Anaheim Stadium was dubbed &quot;Wally World&quot;, after the fictional theme park in the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot;. ESPN announcer Chris Berman called him Wally &quot;Absorbine&quot; Joyner, a nickname that stuck.

Joyner was the starting first baseman in the 1986 All-Star Game. Joyner tied Darryl Strawberry for first place in that year&#x27;s Home Run Derby.

When the Angels met the New York Yankees in a game in August 1986, a fan threw a knife at Joyner. Joyner was grazed on the left arm by the butt end of the weapon, escaping injury.

Joyner broke up two no-hit bids in the ninth during the 1986 season. Against the Texas Rangers on June 16, he foiled Charlie Hough&#x27;s bid with a single with one out in the ninth, scoring Jack Howell (who had reached on a three-base error) to tie the game at 1–1. Joyner, whose hit would be the Angels&#x27; only one of the game, eventually scored the winning run on Orlando Mercado&#x27;s passed ball for a 2–1 Angels victory. Against the Detroit Tigers on August 20, Joyner broke up Walt Terrell&#x27;s bid for a no-hitter by doubling with two out in the ninth; this would also be the Angels only hit in losing to the Tigers 3–0.

Joyner and the Angels advanced to the 1986 American League Championship Series, where they came within one strike of reaching the franchise&#x27;s first World Series. In game 3 of the series, Joyner was running home on an infield hit, and as he stepped on home plate, he unknowingly opened up a previously unseen staph infection on his shin, which led to him having to be hospitalized and miss the rest of the series.

At the end of the 1986 season, Joyner was the runner-up in the voting for the Rookie of the Year Award, losing to José Canseco. On October 3, 1987, Joyner hit three solo home runs against the Indians in a 12-5 victory on the next to last day of the season. He finished the 1987 season with 34 home runs and 117 RBI, both career highs.

==Post-Angels==
After six years with the Angels, Joyner signed with the Kansas City Royals as a free agent for the 1992 season. He played with the Royals for four years. After the 1995 season, Joyner was traded to the San Diego Padres for Bip Roberts. He played with the Padres for four years, and was the starting first baseman on the 1998 pennant-winning team. After the 1999 season, Joyner was traded to the Atlanta Braves in a deal that also sent Reggie Sanders to the Braves and Bret Boone and Ryan Klesko to the Padres. He played with the Braves for one year before ending his career, as he wished, where it had begun, with the Anaheim Angels.

Joyner announced his retirement on June 16, 2001. In a taped message that was played on the Edison Field videoboard after the first inning that day, he thanked the Angels fans for their support and received a standing ovation.

In a 16 year career, Joyner posted a .289 batting average with 204 home runs and 1,106 RBI in 2,033 games played. Defensively, he was an excellent first baseman, recording a career .994 fielding percentage. He led the American League in fielding percentage at first base in 1989 and 1995 and the National League in 1996 and 1997.

In a November 2005 interview with &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;, Joyner revealed that he had briefly used steroids. At age 36, as his career was beginning to decline, he asked Padres teammate Ken Caminiti how to obtain them and did so. He took three pills before deciding not to continue and flushed them down the toilet. Joyner told Buster Olney that his reason for telling his story in public was to set the record straight for the sake of his daughters. Joyner was listed in the 2007 Mitchell Report.

==Coaching==
On July 31, 2007, Joyner was hired by the San Diego Padres to be their hitting coach, replacing Merv Rettenmund. Previously, Joyner had served as a special assistant to Padres General Manager Kevin Towers. Between 2003 and 2007, he also acted as a roving minor league instructor and spring training instructor for the Padres.

In September 2008, Joyner resigned as the hitting coach for the Padres due to a number of factors including the team&#x27;s low rankings in batting categories and a difference in philosophy in regards to hitting with members of upper management (most notably, CEO Sandy Alderson). The resignation came as somewhat of a surprise due to Joyner&#x27;s relationship with the GM/VP Kevin Towers. Their friendship goes all the way back to the early 1980s as college teammates for the BYU Cougars. Towers even traded for Joyner in late 1995, one of the first few transactions he made as the new GM for the Padres. In spite of this, Joyner was likely to be let go at the end of the year like Bench Coach Craig Colbert was on September 29, 2008, due to the same factors in his resignation.

On October 15, 2012, Joyner was hired by the Philadelphia Phillies as their assistant hitting coach to new hitting coach Steve Henderson. Following the firing of Charlie Manuel, Joyner became the first base coach under interim manager, Ryne Sandberg.

On November 18, 2013, the Detroit Tigers announced the hiring of Joyner as their hitting coach. He was the team&#x27;s hitting coach for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 seasons. He resigned after the 2016 season to pursue other opportunities.

==Personal life==
Joyner resides in Mapleton, Utah. Joyner has invested in and appeared in films marketed to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, including playing &quot;Brother Angel&quot; (a reference to the California Angels) in &quot;The Singles Ward&quot;, and &quot;Brother Jensen&quot; in the 2003 movie, &quot;The R.M.&quot;. He is the nephew of former United States Senator Paula Hawkins.

<doc id="1046069" wikidata="Q1564158" url="?curid=1046069" title="HMCS Halifax (FFH 330)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Halifax&quot; (FFH 330) is a that has served in the Royal Canadian Navy and Canadian Forces since 1992. &quot;Halifax&quot; is the lead ship in her class which is the name for the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. She is the second vessel to carry the designation . She carries the hull classification symbol FFH 330.

She is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is homeported at CFB Halifax in her namesake city, Halifax, Nova Scotia, a name that was also borne by , a during the Second World War as well as the first warship built in Halifax, .

==Description and design==
The &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate design of which &quot;Halifax&quot; belongs, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare. In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates of which &quot;Halifax&quot; was a part, out of twelve that were eventually built. To reflect the changing long-term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities.

As built, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . That made them slightly larger than the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating .

This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The &quot;Halifax&quot; class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers.

===Armament and aircraft===
As built the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a &quot;bear trap&quot; system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The &quot;Halifax&quot; class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar.

As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for &quot;last-ditch&quot; defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow.

As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than .

===Countermeasures and sensors===
As built, the decoy system comprises two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship&#x27;s radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada.

Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.

===Modernization===
The &quot;Halifax&quot; class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates&#x27; capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program.

The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 re-control radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall&#x27;s Multi-Ammunition Soft kill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard and the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile.

==Service==
The frigate&#x27;s keel was laid down on 19 March 1987 by Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at Saint John, New Brunswick. The first warship constructed in Canada since 1971, the vessel was launched on 30 April 1988. The ship was provisionally accepted by the Canadian Forces in June 1991. This was followed by a year of sea trials, which after a series of issues that arose during the trials led to modifications in later vessels of the design. The ship was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 29 June 1992.

On 2 April 1994, &quot;Halifax&quot; sailed to relieve the destroyer as Canada&#x27;s contribution to the naval blockade of Yugoslavia in the Adriatic Sea. While in transit to Adriatic, one of the ship&#x27;s diesel engines broke down and the frigate was forced to continue on gas turbines only. &quot;Halifax&quot;″s tour ended when the ship returned to CFB Halifax on 9 September. In early 1995, the frigate sailed to Europe and made several port visits in connection with the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe. &quot;Halifax&quot; then took part in the NATO naval exercise &quot;Linked Seas&quot; off Portugal, returning to Halifax in June.

On 18 March 1996, &quot;Halifax&quot; departed for the Adriatic for a second tour with the embargo force, operating as flagship of the group for part of the ship&#x27;s deployment. In 1998, the frigate took part in the NATO naval exercise &quot;Strong Resolve&quot; off Norway and assisted in the recovery operation following the crash of Swissair Flight 111. In 2000, &quot;Halifax&quot; deployed with NATO&#x27;s STANAVFORLANT fleet between 26 July and 15 December.

&quot;Halifax&quot; departed Halifax on 15 August 2001 to join STANAVFORLANT. However, on 8 October 2001 the ship was diverted for combat operations in the Indian Ocean following the September 11 attacks on the United States. The frigate was the first Canadian ship on station and was deployed in the north Arabian Sea, integrated into the carrier battle group. &quot;Halifax&quot; was replaced by sister ship in December. The ship returned to Halifax on 11 February 2002.

On 13 January 2010, as part of Operation Hestia, it was announced that &quot;Halifax&quot; would be deployed to the waters around Haiti to assist in relief efforts after the January 2010 earthquake, along with the destroyer . Specifically &quot;Halifax&quot; was to be deployed outside the area of Jacmel, which was slow to receive aid due to the fact the roads were cut off and the airport was too small to handle large aircraft. The frigate arrived off Jacmel on 18 January. &quot;Halifax&quot; provided air traffic control for Jacmel Airport on the ship. The ship departed Haiti&#x27;s waters on 19 February. On 4 September 2010, &quot;Halifax&quot; was turned over to Irving Shipbuilding&#x27;s Halifax Shipyards, to start an 18-month mid-life upgrading and modernization.

&quot;Halifax&quot; participated in the acceptance trials of the new CH-148 Cyclone helicopters acquired for the Royal Canadian Navy. In September 2015, &quot;Halifax&quot;, along with &quot;Athabaskan&quot;, were deployed for two large NATO training missions, &quot;Joint Warrior&quot; and &quot;Trident Juncture&quot;. &quot;Halifax&quot; underwent a year-long refit at Halifax Shipyard beginning in 2016. The vessel returned to service on 27 September 2017. In October 2018, &quot;Halifax&quot; was among the Canadian ships sent to participate in the large NATO exercise Trident Juncture in the North Atlantic and Baltic Seas. On 26 October 2018, a minor fire began in the starboard gas turbine in the forward engine room of &quot;Halifax&quot;. The fire was extinguished quickly and the frigate continued on her deployment.

On 6 July 2019, &quot;Halifax&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean Sea to join Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 (SNMG2) as part of Operation Reassurance. Once the frigate joins SNMG2, &quot;Halifax&quot; will become flagship of the unit. However, within 24 hours of the frigate&#x27;s departure, &quot;Halifax&quot; returned to port after an oil leak was discovered in one of the engine rooms. The vessel&#x27;s departure for the Mediterranean was delayed. The oil leak was repaired and &quot;Halifax&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean, where the frigate spent six months. The vessel returned to Canada on 24 January 2020.

&quot;Halifax&quot; departed Canada on 1 January 2021 to join the Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 (SNMG1) for six months. Upon the vessel&#x27;s arrival on 18 January in Lisbon, Portugal, command was transferred to &quot;Halifax&quot; as the flagship of the unit. Upon the ship&#x27;s return to Canada on 19 July, the crew was ordered to isolate aboard the ship in Halifax, after a crew member tested positive for COVID-19. A second sailor tested positive for COVID-19 on 20 July, and later a third.

On 22 February 2022 the federal government announced that &quot;Halifax&quot; would depart again to accompany for Operation Reassurance to provide additional military support, regional security and humanitarian assistance to Central and Eastern Europe in the wake of Russian aggression in Ukraine. &quot;Halifax&quot; departed Canada on 19 March to join the Standing NATO Maritime Group 1 in the Baltic Sea. The two ships returned to Halifax in July.

<doc id="1046071" wikidata="Q860115" url="?curid=1046071" title="Long Island Rough Riders">
<text>The Long Island Rough Riders are an American soccer team based in South Huntington, New York, United States. Founded in 1994, the team plays in USL League Two, the fourth tier of the American Soccer Pyramid.

The team plays its home games at Hofstra University Soccer Stadium. The team&#x27;s colors are white and blue.

The club also has a women&#x27;s team, also called the Long Island Rough Riders, who play in USL W League.

==History==
===Early years in the USISL===
The Rough Riders played their first season in 1994, fielding a team in the USISL that featured future US national team player Chris Armas, who would lead the team in scoring with eight goals and four assists. Long Island (13–5) won the Northeast Division, finishing seven points ahead of North Jersey Dragons. The Rough Riders were placed in the &quot;Raleigh Group&quot; of the USISL &#x27;Sizzling Nine&#x27; Championships, and qualified along with the Minnesota Thunder to face Greensboro Dynamo in the national semifinal; they lost the game 2–1 in overtime as Greensboro went on to take the title.

For their second season in 1995, the Rough Riders added several more players who would go on to excel in Major League Soccer, including US national team goalkeeper Tony Meola, Jim Rooney, and Giovanni Savarese, who would be named the USISL regular season and playoff MVP, and who scored 23 goals during the campaign. The Rough Riders finished the season with a 19–1 record, top of the Coastal Conference for a second year running, and received a bye to the &#x27;Sizzling Nine&#x27; Championship tournament. Wins over the Monterey Bay Jaguars and the New Mexico Chiles in group play took them to the national semifinal for a second time. Unlike the year prior, the Rough Riders won their semi 5–2 against the Tampa Bay Cyclones, and then beat Minnesota Thunder 2–1 to win the USISL Championship.

The Rough Riders lost several players to the nascent MLS in 1996, including Meola and Savarese, but went on to have a successful season nevertheless, finishing with an 11–7 record and winning the North Atlantic Division. They beat Delaware Wizards 2–0 in the second round of the playoffs, and qualified from a &#x27;Select Six&#x27; tournament group, but lost 1–0 to the Richmond Kickers in the playoff semifinals.

===Promotion to the A-League===
With the merger of the USISL and the American Professional Soccer League in 1997, the Rough Riders decided to move up, and began their first season in the A-League in that year. They finished the regular season third in the Northeast Division behind Montreal Impact with a 13–10–5 record. Long Island beat Rochester Raging Rhinos and the Impact in the playoffs, before losing the Carolina Dynamo in the semifinals. The Rough Riders also enjoyed a run to the quarterfinals of the US Open Cup, beating USASA amateur team Bridgeport Italians in the second round, then upsetting Major League Soccer side New England Revolution 4–3 before eventually falling to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars 1–0 on a golden goal. Defender Travis Rinker made the All A-League Team that year.

The Rough Riders finished fourth in the Northeast Division in 1998, and lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Kickers. The following season was a similar story as the team finished third in the regular season, and were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the Pittsburgh Riverdogs. Strikers John Wolyniec and Darko Kolic were much more prolific, scoring 15 and seven goals, respectively.

Fortunes improved significantly in 2000, as the Rough Riders claimed their first regular-season title at this level, winning the Northeast Division by one point over the Rochester Raging Rhinos with a 16–9–4 record. Striker Edson Buddle scored 11 of the team&#x27;s 54 goals, and goalkeeper Paul Grafer posting a 1.29 goals against average. Their title came thanks to nine bonus points earned for scoring three or more goals in a game. However, for a third straight season, playoff success eluded the Rough Riders, who lost 2–1 to the Toronto Lynx in the conference quarterfinals.

The high of the first year of the new millennium was followed by a disappointing low in 2001 as the Rough Riders slumped to their first losing record in years (8–16–4), finishing sixth in the Northern Conference – 42 points behind divisional champions Hershey Wildcats. Following the campaign, team ownership decided to voluntarily relegate the team to the D3 Pro League for 2002.

===Back to the Third Tier – USL Second Division===

The Rough Riders bounced back magnificently in 2002, winning the D3-Pro League Atlantic Conference with a 13–6–1 record, six points clear of New York Freedom in second place. Derrick Etienne and Cordt Weinstein combined for 27 goals, while goalkeeper Billy Gatti maintained an imposing presence in net. Long Island squeaked past New York on penalty kicks after a 2–2 tie in the playoff quarterfinals, and enjoyed a dominant 3–0 win over the Connecticut Wolves in the semifinal to reach the championship game. The final against Southern Conference champions Wilmington Hammerheads was a tight game, but the Rough Riders emerged as 2–1 victors to take their second championship in franchise history.

The Rough Riders retained their divisional title in 2003, despite the league being re-aligned and renamed the Pro Select League. Long Island went 13–4–3, 13 points clear of the New Jersey Stallions, their closest rival, and with Etienne again scoring 10 goals. The Rough Riders enjoyed some impressive victories in the regular season campaign, including a 3–0 victory on the road in May over Westchester Flames, a 4–1 road win over Jersey Falcons in early July, and a pair of comprehensive wins over Reading Rage, 5–1 and 4–1. The Rough Riders also made their second trip to the US Open Cup, but lost 2–1 in the second round to USL-PDL team Mid Michigan Bucks. Despite being favorites to progress through the playoffs, they were upset by the Stallions 5–4 on penalty kicks after a scoreless tie in the playoff regional final.

Long Island struggled in 2004, finishing last in the Atlantic Division with an 8–11–1 record. The season was, however, significant because it marked the return of two former Rough Riders – Jim Rooney from the New England Revolution and Giovanni Savarese from overseas. Etienne was again Long Island&#x27;s top scorer with 11 goals.

The USL Pro Soccer League became the USL Second Division in 2005, and reverted to a single-table format, consisting of nine teams all based on the East Coast. The season started in up-and-down fashion. An opening day 4–1 win over the Northern Virginia Royals was followed by a win over New Hampshire Phantoms, then two losses, two wins and then three losses. The team enjoyed a couple of comprehensive victories, notably a second 4–1 win over Northern Virginia Royals in which Moussa Sy scored all four goals, and a 5–2 hammering of New Hampshire Phantoms in early July. Their US Open Cup campaign ended early with a shocking 4–0 defeat to PDL side Ocean City Barons in the second round. The Rough Riders lost their final five games of the regular season, including a demoralizing 4–1 thrashing at home to Western Mass Pioneers, and finished the season in sixth place with a 7–13–0 record, missing the playoffs for a second straight year. Etienne was Long Island&#x27;s top scorer again (nine goals), while Wilmer Cabrera contributed five assists.

The next season was arguably the worst in team history, with the Rough Riders finishing at the bottom of the table with three wins and fifteen goals scored. The 2006 season was marred by a 13-game winless streak stretching from opening day through mid-July. Losses included: 5–0 to Richmond Kickers, 3–0 to Harrisburg City Islanders, and 3–0 to Wilmington Hammerheads. Long Island&#x27;s first victory was a scrappy 1–0 home win against New Hampshire Phantoms at home, on an 84th-minute strike from Moussa Sy. The high point was a 3–2 seesaw win over Wilmington in the season finale. Following the campaign, the team chose to voluntarily relegate themselves to the USL-PDL for the 2007 season.

===USL-PDL===
The Rough Riders&#x27; first season in PDL began with four straight wins, including a 3–1 road win against the Brooklyn Knights. Their early season form took them to the US Open Cup for the fourth time, but they exited the competition at the hands of USL First Division stalwarts Rochester Raging Rhinos. Long Island&#x27;s home form was their strong point, with five wins and a tie in front of their fans at Michael Tully Field. The Rough Riders&#x27; first season at this level ended with them fourth in the Northeast Division, nine points behind divisional champs Cape Cod Crusaders, and just out of the playoffs. Mike Grella was top scorer with five goals, while Jose Batista contributed five assists.

Long Island was again a playoff contender in 2008. The Rough Riders tied their first game of the season 1–1 before demolishing Virginia Legacy 5–1, with Mike Grella scoring a hat trick. The team was again successful at home, registering five wins and three ties at Michael Tully Field. They won an exciting 4–3 encounter with the Westchester Flames in early June, scored a 90th-minute equalizer through goalkeeper Hasely Holder to tie 3–3 with Newark Ironbound Express, and flattened New Jersey Rangers 6–0, with Grella and Anthony Barberio scoring two goals each. The Rough Riders finished the season third in the Northeast Division, two points behind Newark Ironbound Express, and agonizingly out of the playoffs for the second consecutive year. Mike Grella and Michael Todd were the team&#x27;s leading scorers, each scoring five goals. Todd and Tadeu Terra tallied four assists apiece.

In 2009, the Rough Riders (12–2–2) finished in second place in the Northeast Division. Despite failing to qualify for the U.S. Open Cup, they clinched a spot in the divisional playoffs. The Rough Riders lost 2–0 to the Ocean City Barons.

The Rough Riders ended the 2010 season in fourth place in the Mid Atlantic Division with an 8–4–3 record. They made their fifth U.S. Open Cup appearance and advanced to the second round for the first time since 1997 when they defeated the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. They opened up the first round against the New York Pancyprian-Freedoms. Long Island took the lead in the first half as Danny Kramer scored off a cross from Ben Arikian. In the second half, the Rough Riders added another goal as Alex Grendi took a shot off a cross from Kramer and it found the back of the net. The Rough Riders were defeated by the Harrisburg City Islanders in the second round. In December, the team was invited by the Bermuda Football Association to participate in its BFA Christmas 2010 tour, a holiday tournament for local and international clubs. The Rough Riders played against Bermuda&#x27;s Under-20 World Cup National Team, The Dandy Town Hornets, and Bermuda&#x27;s Premier Division League Champions.

Long Island (12–1–3) finished atop of the Eastern Conference Mid Atlantic Division in 2011 which solidified a spot in the postseason. In their first playoff appearance in two years, the Rough Riders defeated the New Hampshire Phantoms 3–2 as Dominick Sarlee netted a hat trick in the USL Premier Developmental League&#x27;s Eastern Conference Championships. The Rough Riders&#x27; postseason continued as they advanced to the PDL Eastern Conference Championship against Mid Atlantic Division rivals Jersey Express. Midfielder Stephan Barea&#x27;s winner in the 84th minute propelled the Rough Riders to the PDL Championship semifinal against the Laredo Heat, where they&#x27;d lose 4–1.

In 2012, the Rough Riders welcomed back captain Danny Kramer and former MLS player, Gary Flood. The team finished in fifth place with a record of 6–7–3. The Rough Riders lost 2–0 to second round to Harrisburg City Islanders in the second round of the U.S. Open Cup.

Long Island went 7–5–2 in 2013, finishing in third place in the division, failing to qualify for the postseason and U.S. Open Cup. Former Rough Riders player James Nealis was chosen in the 37th round in the MLS Draft by the Houston Dynamo.

The Rough Riders concluded the 2014 season with an 8–4–2 record. They finished in third place of the Mid Atlantic Division and were four points shy from solidifying a spot in the playoffs.

In 2015, the Rough Riders finished in second place in the Mid Atlantic Division at 9–4–1, advancing to the PDL playoffs for the first time since 2011. The semifinal match against the Jersey Express remained scoreless until the 48th minute when Kramer&#x27;s shot from inside the penalty box put the Rough Riders ahead. A minute later, the Express got on the scoreboard with the equalizer. The Express took the lead in the 52nd minute and provided another goal in the 76th minute en route to a 3–1 comeback win. Former Rough Riders player Tim Parker made his Major League Soccer playoff debut for the Vancouver Whitecaps against the Portland Timbers in early November. Parker also earned his first call-up to the United States National Team training camp in January that included international friendlies versus Canada and Iceland.

The Rough Riders finish third in the Northeast Division with a record of 6–5–3 the next season.

In 2017, the Rough Riders went 10–2–5 en route to the PDL Eastern Conference Final. Long Island, which finished runner-up in the Northeast Division, defeated Mid-Atlantic winners New York Red Bulls U-23 in an Eastern Conference play-in game. The Rough Riders beat the Myrtle Beach Mutiny, winners of the South Division, in the conference semifinals, before losing to eventual PDL champion Charlotte on penalty kicks in the Eastern Conference Final.

Former Rough Riders midfielder Stephen Roche was named head coach on February 13, 2018. He guided Long Island to a 10–5–1 overall record and 9–4–1 record in the PDL, finishing in third place. The offseason was highlighted by midfielder Danny Bedoya signing with New York City FC, Rough Riders&#x27; parent club, on August 9.

<doc id="1046074" wikidata="Q16980781" url="?curid=1046074" title="Joe Isuzu">
<text>Joe Isuzu was a fictional spokesman who starred in a series of 1980s television advertisements for Isuzu cars and trucks. Created by the ad agency Della Femina, Travisano, and Partners, and directed by Hollywood director Graham Baker, the segments aired on American television in 1986–90, reaching their zenith in 1987 after the character was featured during Super Bowl XXI. Played by actor David Leisure, Joe Isuzu was a pathological liar who made outrageous and overinflated claims about Isuzu&#x27;s cars, with one commercial even casting him as the Boy Who Cried Wolf. Joe Isuzu&#x27;s satire of the advertising and automotive sales business met with some resistance within those industries among those who felt the character reflected poorly on them.

Joe Isuzu was a major success, causing a significant jump in Isuzu sales the year he was introduced and maintaining those sales in the following years. In an effort to further boost sales and assuage concerns that Joe Isuzu was becoming more famous than the Isuzu vehicles he was trying to sell, Isuzu tweaked the ad campaign to make Joe more honest about Isuzu&#x27;s benefits, compensating with more assertive sales tactics, such as ambushing salesmen trying to sell other brands by mentioning Isuzu&#x27;s superior performance to the customer and luring them to Isuzu. In 1991, after stagnating sales, Isuzu fired Della Femina, ending Joe Isuzu&#x27;s initial run. The campaign was resurrected briefly in 1999 and continued until 2001 to promote several cars such as the Isuzu Axiom. A decade after Isuzu exited the U.S. market, Leisure reprised the role in a 2018 commercial for Johnny5ive, an Isuzu Trooper repairman.

Famous quotes include these:
* &quot;Hi! (...) It&#x27;s me, Joe Isuzu.&quot;
* &quot;You have my word on it.&quot;
* &quot;If I&#x27;m lying, may lightning hit my mother.&quot; (&quot;Good luck, Mom!&quot; appears on screen.)
* &quot;It has more seats than the Astrodome!&quot;
* &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Joe Isuzu and I used my new Isuzu pickup truck to carry a 2,000-pound cheeseburger.&quot;
* &quot;The Isuzu Impulse: faster than a speeding—[catches a bullet in his teeth]—well, you know.&quot;
* &quot;I swear on my mother&#x27;s grave the quality of this Isuzu!&quot; &quot;cell phone rings&quot; &quot;Hello? Oh, hi Mom!&quot;
* &quot;Hi! It&#x27;s me, Joanne Isuzu, Joe Isuzu&#x27;s twin sister.&quot; (Leisure appears on-screen in drag, with the caption reading &quot;He&#x27;s lying, and so is she.&quot;)
*&quot;Isuzu Trooper II, can hold the whole state of Texas!&quot; (&quot;78.2 cubic feet of it.&quot; stated on the bottom of the screen)

==Legacy==
The character became a fixture in American popular culture. In 1988, Michael Dukakis, in a debate with George H. W. Bush during that year&#x27;s United States presidential election, said, &quot;If Bush keeps it up, he&#x27;s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics.&quot;

Leisure reprised his role as Joe Isuzu in a 1992 A&amp;W Cream Soda commercial. True to form, Isuzu made outrageous claims about the soda.

In 2012, &quot;Daily Finance&quot; (a subsidiary of &quot;AOL&quot;) named David Leisure #15 of Top 25 Celebrity Spokespeople of All Time for having portrayed Joe Isuzu in Isuzu advertisements. The same year, Leisure reprised the role in a series of mock endorsements of Mitt Romney&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign.

<doc id="1046120" wikidata="Q2936505" url="?curid=1046120" title="Canonicalization">
<text>In computer science, canonicalization (sometimes standardization or [[Normalization (statistics)|normalization]]) is a process for converting data that has more than one possible representation into a &quot;standard&quot;, &quot;normal&quot;, or canonical form. This can be done to compare different representations for equivalence, to count the number of distinct data structures, to improve the efficiency of various algorithms by eliminating repeated calculations, or to make it possible to impose a meaningful sorting order.

==Usage cases==

=== Filenames ===
Files in file systems may in most cases be accessed through multiple filenames. For instance in Unix-like systems, the string &quot;codice_1&quot; can be replaced by &quot;codice_2&quot;. In the C standard library, the function codice_3 performs this task. Other operations performed by this function to canonicalize filenames are the handling of codice_4 components referring to parent directories, simplification of sequences of multiple slashes, removal of trailing slashes, and the resolution of symbolic links.

Canonicalization of filenames is important for computer security. For example, a web server may have a restriction that only files under the cgi directory codice_5 may be executed. This rule is enforced by checking that the path starts with codice_6 and only then executing it. While the file codice_7 initially appears to be in the cgi directory, it exploits the codice_8 path specifier to traverse back up the directory hierarchy in an attempt to execute a file outside of codice_9. Permitting codice_10 to execute would be an error caused by a failure to canonicalize the filename to the simplest representation, codice_11, and is called a directory traversal vulnerability. With the path canonicalized, it is clear the file should not be executed.

===Unicode===

In Unicode, many accented letters can be represented in more than one way. For example, &quot;é&quot; can be represented in Unicode as the Unicode character U+0065 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E) followed by the character U+0301 (COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT), but it can also be represented as the precomposed character U+00E9 (LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE). This makes string comparison more complicated, since every possible representation of a string containing such glyphs must be considered. To deal with this, Unicode provides the mechanism of canonical equivalence. In this context, canonicalization is Unicode normalization.

Variable-width encodings in the Unicode standard, in particular UTF-8, may cause an additional need for canonicalization in some situations. Namely, by the standard, in UTF-8 there is only one valid byte sequence for any Unicode character, but some byte sequences are invalid, i.e., they cannot be obtained by encoding any string of Unicode characters into UTF-8. Some sloppy decoder implementations may accept invalid byte sequences as input and produce a valid Unicode character as output for such a sequence. If one uses such a decoder, some Unicode characters effectively have more than one corresponding byte sequence: the valid one and some invalid ones. This could lead to security issues similar to the one described in the previous section. Therefore, if one wants to apply some filter (e.g., a regular expression written in UTF-8) to UTF-8 strings that will later be passed to a decoder that allows invalid byte sequences, one should canonicalize the strings before passing them to the filter. In this context, canonicalization is the process of translating every string character to its single valid byte sequence. An alternative to canonicalization is to reject any strings containing invalid byte sequences.

===URL===

A canonical URL is a URL for defining the single source of truth for duplicate content.

==== Use by Google ====

A canonical URL is the URL of the page that Google thinks is most representative from a set of duplicate pages on your site. For example, if you have URLs for the same page, such as codice_12 and codice_13, Google chooses one as canonical. Note that the pages do not need to be absolutely identical; minor changes in sorting or filtering of list pages do not make the page unique (for example, sorting by price or filtering by item color).

The canonical can be in a different domain than a duplicate.

==== Internet ====

With the help of canonical URLs, a search engine knows which link should be provided in a query result.

A canonical link element can get used to define a canonical URL.

==== Intranet ====

In intranets, manual searching for information is predominant. In this case, canonical URLs can be defined in a non-machine-readable form, too. For example in a guideline.

==== Misc ====

Canonical URLs are usually the URLs that get used for the share action.

Since the Canonical URL gets used in the search result of search engines, they are in most cases a landing page.

===Search engines and SEO===
In web search and search engine optimization (SEO), URL canonicalization deals with web content that has more than one possible URL. Having multiple URLs for the same web content can cause problems for search engines - specifically in determining which URL should be shown in search results. Most search engines support the Canonical link element as a hint to which URL should be treated as the true version. As indicated by John Mueller of Google, having other directives in a page, like the robots noindex element can give search engines conflicting signals about how to handle canonicalization 

Example:
* codice_14
* codice_15
* codice_16
* codice_17

All of these URLs point to the homepage of Wikipedia, but a search engine will only consider one of them to be the canonical form of the URL.

===XML===
A Canonical XML document is by definition an XML document that is in XML Canonical form, defined by The Canonical XML specification. Briefly, canonicalization removes whitespace within tags, uses particular character encodings, sorts namespace references and eliminates redundant ones, removes XML and DOCTYPE declarations, and transforms relative URIs into absolute URIs.

A simple example would be the following two snippets of XML:
# codice_18
# codice_19
The first example contains extra spaces in the closing tag of the first node. The second example, which has been canonicalized, has had these spaces removed. Note that only the spaces within the tags are removed under W3C canonicalization, not those between tags.

A full summary of canonicalization changes is listed below:
* The document is encoded in UTF-8
* Line breaks normalized to #xA on input, before parsing
* Attribute values are normalized, as if by a validating processor
* Character and parsed entity references are replaced
* CDATA sections are replaced with their character content
* The XML declaration and document type declaration are removed
* Empty elements are converted to start-end tag pairs
* Whitespace outside of the document element and within start and end tags is normalized
* All whitespace in character content is retained (excluding characters removed during line feed normalization)
* Attribute value delimiters are set to quotation marks (double quotes)
* Special characters in attribute values and character content are replaced by character references
* Superfluous namespace declarations are removed from each element
* Default attributes are added to each element
* Fixup of codice_20 attributes is performed
* Lexicographic order is imposed on the namespace declarations and attributes of each element

=== Computational linguistics ===
In morphology and lexicography, a lemma is the &quot;canonical form&quot; of a set of words. In English, for example, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;ran&quot;, and &quot;running&quot; are forms of the same lexeme, so we can select one of them; ex. &quot;run&quot;, to represent all the forms. Lexical databases such as Unitex use this kind of representation.

Lemmatisation is the process of converting a word to its &quot;canonical form&quot;.

<text>Stars &amp; Stripes (&quot;Team Dennis Conner&quot;) is the name of an America&#x27;s Cup syndicate operated by Dennis Conner and its racing yachts, which are among the most famous in the world. The name &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; refers to the nickname often used for the flag of the United States. TDC was registered under the flag of San Diego Yacht Club (SDYC).

== 12-metre class yachts ==
The well funded Sail America Foundation commissioned four 12-metre yachts to support a campaign led by Dennis Conner, representing San Diego Yacht Club, to win back the America&#x27;s Cup in the 1987 competition in Fremantle, Australia.
* Stars &amp; Stripes 83 (US 53) built in 1985 by Geraghty Marine, designed by Chance/Nelson/Pedrick.
* Stars &amp; Stripes 85 (US 54) built in 1985 by Robert E. Derektor Inc., designed by Chance/Nelson/Pedrick. Proved to be faster than &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; 83.
* Stars &amp; Stripes 86 (US 56) built in 1986 by Robert E. Derektor Inc., designed by Chance/Nelson/Pedrick. Designed with a different keel and more sail area.
* Stars &amp; Stripes 87 (US 55) built in 1986 by Robert E. Derektor Inc., designed by Chance/Nelson/Pedrick. Designed and built with the experience gained from the first three designs. &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes 87&quot; won the trials to select the challenger and went on to defeat the Australian defender &quot;Kookaburra III&quot; in a four-race sweep to win the Cup back for the USA.

The movie &quot;Wind&quot; is loosely based on Dennis Conner&#x27;s experience, from the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup loss to his America&#x27;s Cup win in Perth, and on a number of events that occurred on various competitor boats throughout the match races of the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup. For artistic reasons, the 12-metre &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes 87&quot; was dramatized in the film as &quot;Geronimo&quot;.

During the 2017 Hurricane Irma, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes 87&quot;, the third iteration of the &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; sustained major damage in Sint Maarten. A total of five 12 meter yachts were damaged, sunk, or were dismasted. It had previously sunk, in 2002 when the rudder shaft broke while the crew was training.

==Catamaran-hull yachts==


The surprise challenge by Sir Michael Fay caught San Diego Yacht Club unprepared. They initially rejected the challenge, but were compelled to respond when Mr. Fay brought the matter before the New York courts. The court&#x27;s decision was handed down in November 1987, leaving little time to prepare for the 1988 challenge race.

As the challenge used the original Deed of Gift as its basis, the design requirements specified only that she be a single masted yacht no more than 90 feet at the waterline. San Diego Yacht Club and Dennis Conner&#x27;s syndicate chose to respond with an assuredly faster multi-hull design. Conner enlisted the help of designers Morrelli, Chance &amp; Hubbart &amp; MacLane, and aircraft manufacturer Scaled Composites. Two &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; cats were built, one with a conventional soft sail (&quot;Stars &amp; Stripes S1&quot;), and the second with a wing mast (&quot;Stars &amp; Stripes H3&quot;) built by Scaled Composites. The wing masted boat proved to have superior performance, and so was used in the defense.

To no one&#x27;s surprise, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; dominated its match races with &quot;KZ 1&quot;, the challenger from New Zealand. Following the race the New Zealand team sued and initially won the America&#x27;s Cup trophy in a court case. The decision was reversed on appeal, and San Diego Yacht Club retained the cup.

After the 1988 America&#x27;s Cup, the wing masted catamaran was bought by Mexican yachtsman Victor Tapia and currently sails in Mexico. The soft sail yacht was bought by Steve Fossett and used to set speed records in various yacht races. The soft sail yacht suffered a dismasting during a Mackinac race which resulted in her being stored for several years. In 2015, Freddie Mills acquired the vessel and has re-rigged and re-commissioned her as a private racing yacht operating out of Newport, Rhode Island. In October 2017 &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; (soft sail) was acquired by Key Lime Sailing Club and Cottages in Key Largo to be used for day charters and racing.

===2008 Port Huron to Mackinac race===

Fossett&#x27;s &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; yacht was entered in the 84th running of the annual Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race to Mackinac from Port Huron, Michigan, and was favored to win and set a new record time. An experienced Chicago sailor Donald Wilson captained the yacht, chartering it from a Florida businessman for both the Port Huron and Chicago to Mackinac races. The same yacht previously competed in the 74th running of the Port Huron regatta (1998) but was unable to complete the race after the mast broke off near Alpena, Michigan. The yacht was again dismasted mid-race in heavy winds while leading a rival multihull yacht &quot;Earth Voyager&quot;, which then went on to finish the race in record time.

== International America&#x27;s Cup Class ==

===1992===

Conner&#x27;s 1992 IACC AC yacht, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes USA-11&quot; lost the defender series final, the Citizen Cup, to Bill Koch&#x27;s &quot;America3 USA-23&quot;.

===1995===

Conner&#x27;s 1995 AC yacht, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes USA-34&quot; won the defender series, the Citizen Cup against &quot;Young America USA-36&quot; and &quot;Mighty Mary USA-43&quot;, by use of tactics. However, it was considered to be the slowest of the three defending yachts, partially due to an old sail inventory, and also a result of neglecting important recommendations from the design team. The defender can choose which boat to use, so Team DC selected &quot;Young America&quot;, considered the fastest defender, instead of &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot; in the America&#x27;s Cup final, losing to Team New Zealand. Dennis Conner did not run a two boat campaign due to cost, so there was no second &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes&quot;.

===2000===

Conner again ran a one-boat campaign, entering &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes USA-55&quot;. Eliminated in the semi-final repechage after an unexpected loss against &quot;America True&quot;.

===2003===

Conner&#x27;s $5 million 2002 entrant, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes USA-77&quot;, was sunk on July 23, 2002, when a rudder broke during preparations for the 2002–2003 races to select the challenger for the America&#x27;s Cup. The boat was raised out of of water just outside Long Beach Harbor. Conner&#x27;s luck that year would not improve, as &quot;Alinghi&quot; and &quot;Oracle BMW Racing&quot;, two well financed boats, would contest for the spotlight. Conner had a backup and training vessel available, &quot;Stars &amp; Stripes USA-66&quot;, which he raced until USA-77 could be repaired.

===2007===

Conner announced that he could not raise sufficient funds for another Cup challenge.

<doc id="1046138" wikidata="Q913981" url="?curid=1046138" title="Urquhart Castle">
<text>Urquhart Castle ( ; ) is a ruined castle that sits beside Loch Ness in the Highlands of Scotland. The castle is on the A82 road, southwest of Inverness and east of Drumnadrochit.

The present ruins date from the 13th to the 16th centuries, though built on the site of an early medieval fortification. Founded in the 13th century, Urquhart played a role in the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century. It was subsequently held as a royal castle and was raided on several occasions by the MacDonald Earls of Ross. The castle was granted to the Clan Grant in 1509, though conflict with the MacDonalds continued. Despite a series of further raids the castle was strengthened, only to be largely abandoned by the middle of the 17th century. Urquhart was partially destroyed in 1692 to prevent its use by Jacobite forces, and subsequently decayed. In the 20th century, it was placed in state care as a scheduled monument and opened to the public: it is now one of the most-visited castles in Scotland and received 547,518 visitors in 2019.

The castle, situated on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, is one of the largest in Scotland in area. It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid out around two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the scant remains of earlier buildings.

==History==

===Early Middle Ages===
The name Urquhart derives from the 7th-century form , itself a mix of the Old Irish (point or promontory) and Old Welsh (thicket or wood). Pieces of vitrified stone, subjected to intense heat and characteristic of early medieval fortification, had been discovered at Urquhart from the early 20th century. Speculation that Urquhart may have been the fortress of Bridei son of Maelchon, king of the northern Picts, led Professor Leslie Alcock to undertake excavations in 1983. Adomnán&#x27;s &quot;Life of Columba&quot; records that St. Columba visited Bridei some time between 562 and 586, though little geographical detail is given. Adomnán also relates that during the visit, Columba converted a Pictish nobleman named Emchath, who was on his deathbed, his son Virolec, and their household, at a place called &quot;Airdchartdan&quot;. The excavations, supported by radiocarbon dating, indicated that the rocky knoll at the south-west corner of the castle had been the site of an extensive fort between the 5th and 11th centuries. The findings led Professor Alcock to conclude that Urquhart is most likely to have been the site of Emchath&#x27;s residence, rather than that of Bridei who is more likely to have been based at Inverness, either at the site of the castle or at Craig Phadrig to the west.

===The early castle===
Some sources state that William the Lion had a royal castle at Urquhart in the 12th century, though Professor Alcock finds no evidence for this. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Meic Uilleim (MacWilliams), descendants of Malcolm III, staged a series of rebellions against David I and his successors. The last of these rebellions was put down in 1229, and to maintain order Alexander II granted Urquhart to his &quot;Hostarius&quot; (usher or door-ward), Thomas de Lundin. On de Lundin&#x27;s death a few years later it passed to his son Alan Durward. It is considered likely that the original castle was built soon after this time, centred on the motte at the south-west of the site. In 1275, after Alan&#x27;s death, the king granted Urquhart to John II Comyn, Lord of Badenoch.

The first documentary record of Urquhart Castle occurs in 1296 when it was captured by Edward I of England. Edward&#x27;s invasion marked the beginning of the Wars of Scottish Independence, which would go on intermittently until 1357. Edward appointed Sir William Fitz Warin as constable to hold the castle for the English. In 1297 he was ambushed by Sir Andrew de Moray while returning from Inverness, and Moray subsequently laid siege to the castle, launching an unsuccessful night attack. The English must have been dislodged soon after, since in 1298 Urquhart was again controlled by the Scots. In 1303 Sir Alexander de Forbes failed to hold off another English assault. This time Edward installed as governor Alexander Comyn, brother of John, as the family had sided with the English against Robert Bruce. Following his murder of the Red Comyn in 1306, Bruce completed his defeat of the Comyns when he marched through the Great Glen in 1307, taking the castles of Inverlochy, Urquhart and Inverness. After this time Urquhart became a royal castle, held for the crown by a series of constables.

Sir Robert Lauder of Quarrelwood was constable of Urquhart Castle in 1329. After fighting at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, where the Scots were defeated, Lauder returned to hold Urquhart against another threatened English invasion. It is recorded as being one of only five castles in Scotland held by the Scots at this time (the others were Dumbarton, Lochleven, Kildrummy and Loch Doon). In 1342, David II spent the summer hunting at Urquhart, the only king to have stayed here.

Over the next two hundred years, the Great Glen was raided frequently by the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, powerful rulers of a semi-independent kingdom in western Scotland, with a valid claim to the earldom of Ross. In 1395, Domhnall of Islay seized Urquhart Castle from the crown, and managed to retain it for more than 15 years. His brother, Alexander Macdonald, Lord of Lochaber, also had a contract from Thomas Dunbar, Earl of Moray, to defend the Regality of Moray, which included access to the Great Glen. In 1411, Donald Macdonald marched through the glen on his way to claim the earldom of Ross. He met Alexander Stewart, earl of Mar at the Battle of Harlaw. Donald won the battle and retained control of Ross thereafter. James I recognized his title as the first earl of Ross of his family. Nevertheless, the crown was soon back in control of Urquhart. 

In 1437 Domhnall&#x27;s son Alexander, Earl of Ross, raided around Glen Urquhart but could not take the castle. Royal funds were granted to shore up the castle&#x27;s defences. Alexander&#x27;s son John succeeded his father in 1449, aged 16. In 1452 he too led a raid up the Great Glen, seizing Urquhart, and subsequently obtained a grant of the lands and castle of Urquhart for life. However, in 1462 John made an agreement with Edward IV of England against the Scottish King James III. When this became known to James in 1476, John was stripped of his titles, and Urquhart was turned over to an ally, the Earl of Huntly.

===The Grants===
Huntly brought in Sir Duncan Grant of Freuchie to restore order to the area around Urquhart Castle. His son John Grant of Freuchie (d.1538) was given a five-year lease of the Glen Urquhart estate in 1502. In 1509, Urquhart Castle, along with the estates of Glen Urquhart and Glenmoriston, was granted by James IV to John Grant in perpetuity, on condition that he repair and rebuild the castle. The Grants maintained their ownership of the castle until 1512, although the raids from the west continued. In 1513, following the disaster of Flodden, Sir Donald MacDonald of Lochalsh attempted to gain from the disarray in Scotland by claiming the Lordship of the Isles and occupying Urquhart Castle. Grant regained the castle before 1517, but not before the MacDonalds had driven off 300 cattle and 1,000 sheep, as well as looting the castle of provisions. Grant unsuccessfully attempted to claim damages from MacDonald. James Grant of Freuchie (d.1553) succeeded his father, and in 1544 became involved with Huntly and Clan Fraser in a feud with the Macdonalds of Clanranald, which culminated in the Battle of the Shirts. In retaliation, the MacDonalds and their allies the Camerons attacked and captured Urquhart in 1545. Known as the &quot;Great Raid&quot;, this time the MacDonalds succeeded in taking 2,000 cattle, as well as hundreds of other animals, and stripped the castle of its furniture, cannon, and even the gates. Grant regained the castle, and was also awarded Cameron lands as recompense.

The Great Raid proved to be the last raid. In 1527, the historian Hector Boece wrote of the &quot;rewinous wallis&quot; of Urquhart, but by the close of the 16th century Urquhart had been rebuilt by the Grants, now a powerful force in the Highlands. Repairs and remodelling continued as late as 1623, although the castle was no longer a favoured residence. In 1644 a mob of Covenanters (Presbyterian agitators) broke into the castle when Lady Mary Grant was staying, robbing her and turning her out for her adherence to Episcopalianism. An inventory taken in 1647 shows the castle virtually empty. When Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland in 1650, he disregarded Urquhart in favour of building forts at either end of the Great Glen.
When James VII was deposed in the Revolution of 1688, Ludovic Grant of Freuchie sided with William of Orange and garrisoned the castle with 200 of his own soldiers. Though lacking weapons they were well-provisioned and, when a force of 500 Jacobites (supporters of the exiled James) laid siege, the garrison was able to hold out until after the defeat of the main Jacobite force at Cromdale in May 1690. When the soldiers finally left they blew up the gatehouse to prevent the reoccupation of the castle by the Jacobites. Large blocks of collapsed masonry are still visible beside the remains of the gatehouse. Parliament ordered £2,000 compensation to be paid to Grant, but no repairs were undertaken. Subsequent plundering of the stonework and other materials for re-use by locals further reduced the ruins, and the Grant Tower partially collapsed following a storm in 1715.

===Later history===
By the 1770s the castle was roofless and was regarded as a romantic ruin by 19th-century painters and visitors to the Highlands. In 1884 the castle came under the control of Caroline, Dowager Countess of Seafield, widow of the 7th Earl of Seafield, on the death of her son the 8th Earl. On Lady Seafield&#x27;s death in 1911 her will instructed that Urquhart Castle be entrusted into state care, and in October 1913 responsibility for the castle&#x27;s upkeep was transferred to the Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Works and Public Buildings. Historic Environment Scotland (formerly Historic Scotland), the successor to the Office of Works, continues to maintain the castle, which is scheduled monument in recognition of its national significance.

In 1994 Historic Scotland proposed the construction of a new visitor centre and car park to alleviate the problems of parking on the main A82 road. Strong local opposition led to a public inquiry, which approved the proposals in 1998. The new building is sunk into the embankment below the road, with provision for parking on the roof of the structure. The visitor centre includes a display of the history of the site, including a series of replicas from the medieval period; a cinema; a restaurant; and a shop. The castle is open all year, and can also host wedding ceremonies. In 2018 518,195 people visited Urquhart Castle, making it Historic Scotland&#x27;s third most visited site after the castles of Edinburgh and Stirling.

==Description==
Urquhart Castle is sited on Strone Point, a triangular promontory on the north-western shore of Loch Ness, and commands the route along this side of the Great Glen as well as the entrance to Glen Urquhart. The castle is quite close to water level, though there are low cliffs along the northeast sides of the promontory. There is considerable room for muster on the inland side, where a &quot;castle-toun&quot; of service buildings would originally have stood, as well as gardens and orchards in the 17th century. Beyond this area the ground rises steeply to the north-west, up to the visitor centre and the A82. A dry moat, across at its widest, defends the landward approach, possibly excavated in the early Middle Ages. A stone-built causeway provides access, with a drawbridge formerly crossing the gap at the centre. The castle side of the causeway was formerly walled-in, forming an enclosed space similar to a barbican.

Urquhart is one of the largest castles in Scotland in area. The walled portion of the castle is shaped roughly like a figure-8 aligned northeast-southwest along the bank of the loch, around , forming two baileys (enclosures): the Nether Bailey to the north, and the Upper Bailey to the south. The curtain walls of both enclosures date largely to the 14th century, though much augmented by later building, particularly to the north where most of the remaining structures are located.

===Nether Bailey===

The 16th-century gatehouse is on the inland side of the Nether Bailey and comprises twin D-plan towers flanking an arched entrance passage. Formerly the passage was defended by a portcullis and a double set of doors, with guard rooms on either side. Over the entrance are a series of rooms which may have served as accommodation for the castle&#x27;s keeper. Collapsed masonry surrounds the gatehouse, dating from its destruction after 1690.

The Nether Bailey, the main focus of activity in the castle since around 1400, is anchored at its northern tip by the Grant Tower, the main tower house or keep. The tower measures , and has walls up to thick. The tower rests on 14th-century foundations, but is largely the result of 16th-century rebuilding. Originally of five storeys, it remains the tallest portion of the castle despite the southern wall collapsing in a storm in the early 18th century. The standing parts of the parapet, remodelled in the 1620s, show that the corners of the tower were topped by corbelled bartizans (turrets). Above the main door on the west, and the postern to the east, are machicolations, narrow slots through which objects could be dropped on attackers. The western door is also protected by its own ditch and drawbridge, accessed from a cobbled &quot;Inner Close&quot; separated from the main bailey by a gate. The surviving interior sections can still be accessed via the circular staircase built into the east wall of the tower. The interior would have comprised a hall on the first floor, with rooms on another two floors above, and attic chambers in the turrets. Rooms on the main floors have large 16th-century windows, though with small pistol holes below to allow for defence.

To the south of the tower is a range of buildings built against the thick, buttressed, 14th-century curtain wall. The great hall occupied the central part of this range, with the lord&#x27;s private apartments of great chamber and solar in the block to the north, and kitchens to the south. The foundations of a rectangular building stand on a rocky mound within the Nether Bailey, tentatively identified as a chapel.

=== Upper Bailey ===
The Upper Bailey is focused on the rocky mound at the southwest corner of the castle. The highest part of the headland, this mound is the site of the earliest defences at Urquhart. Vitrified material, characteristic of early medieval fortification, was discovered on the slopes of the mound, indicating the site of the early medieval fortification identified by Professor Alcock. In the 13th century, the mound became the motte of the original castle built by the Durwards, and the surviving walls represent a &quot;shell keep&quot; (a hollow enclosure) of this date. These ruins are fragmentary but indicate that there were towers to the north and south of the shell keep.

A 16th-century watergate in the eastern wall of the Upper Bailey gives access to the shore of the loch. The adjacent buildings may have housed the stables. To the south of this, opposite the motte, is the base of a doocot (pigeon house) and the scant remains of 13th-century buildings, possibly once a great hall but more recently re-used as a smithy.

==Relics==

After the castle came into public hands repairs and excavations were carried out. These were interrupted by World War I but were resumed and completed by 1922. A large collection of relics was found, including a bronze ewer from the 15th century, coins, jewellery, crosses and other items from the 13th to 17th centuries. The excavations have been criticised for not recording the locations or stratigraphic information, but the collection is of great value, and is now mostly in the care of the National Museum, Edinburgh. Samson (1983) has provided a detailed list with illustrations.

<text>Heatherden Hall is a Grade II-listed, Victorian country house located in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England. It stands in the grounds of Pinewood Studios and is used as offices, film sets, and as a wedding venue.

It was purchased by Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Grant Morden, a Canadian financier and Member of Parliament, who transformed the mansion by adding a large ballroom and a Victorian Turkish bath. During the 1930s it became a retreat and private meeting place for politicians and diplomats.

==History==

When Morden died in 1932, the estate was bought at auction by Charles Boot, who had recently inherited a large construction firm from his father, Henry Boot, who had died in 1931. Within a year Charles Boot had transformed Heatherden Hall into the office building for a new film studio complex that occupied the grounds.

The mansion has two main fronts: one formal three-storey entrance and another that is seen mostly in films. A conservatory was added to the front where the door was once situated, and became known as the Gatsby Suite; however, this was subsequently removed and now forms part of the enlarged outdoor terrace. The grand ballroom runs along the side. Heatherden Hall has extensive grounds with formal gardens and lakes, plants and features. The many trees surrounding the manor served as the inspiration for the name &quot;Pinewood&quot;.

==Use in films==

The house and gardens have been featured in many British films, including &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;, &quot;Twice Round the Daffodils&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Mr Blunden&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot;, &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (as the SPECTRE headquarters) and the &quot;Carry On&quot; films. It has appeared in such television series as &quot;One Foot in the Grave&quot; and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;. The Great Celebrity Bake Off for SU2C and the Great American Baking Show are filmed on the grounds of Heatherden Hall.

<doc id="1046155" wikidata="Q339722" url="?curid=1046155" title="Projection-valued measure">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, a projection-valued measure (or spectral measure) is a function defined on certain subsets of a fixed set and whose values are self-adjoint projections on a fixed Hilbert space. A projection-valued measure (PVM) is formally similar to a real-valued measure, except that its values are self-adjoint projections rather than real numbers. As in the case of ordinary measures, it is possible to integrate complex-valued functions with respect to a PVM; the result of such an integration is a linear operator on the given Hilbert space.

Projection-valued measures are used to express results in spectral theory, such as the important spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators, in which case the PVM is sometimes referred to as the spectral measure. The Borel functional calculus for self-adjoint operators is constructed using integrals with respect to PVMs. In quantum mechanics, PVMs are the mathematical description of projective measurements. They are generalized by positive operator valued measures (POVMs) in the same sense that a mixed state or density matrix generalizes the notion of a pure state.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 denote a separable complex Hilbert space and formula_2 a measurable space consisting of a set formula_3 and a Borel σ-algebra formula_4 on formula_3. A projection-valued measure formula_6 is a map from formula_4 to the set of bounded self-adjoint operators on formula_1 satisfying the following properties:
* formula_9 is an orthogonal projection for all formula_10
* formula_11 and formula_12, where formula_13 is the empty set and formula_14 the identity operator.
* If formula_15 in formula_4 are disjoint, then for all formula_17,
::formula_18
* formula_19 for all formula_20

The second and fourth property show that if formula_21 and formula_22 are disjoint, i.e., formula_23, the images formula_24 and formula_25 are orthogonal to each other. 

Let formula_26 and its orthogonal complement formula_27 denote the image and kernel, respectively, of formula_9. If formula_29 is a closed subspace of formula_1 then formula_1 can be wrtitten as the &quot;orthogonal decomposition&quot; formula_32 and formula_33 is the unique identity operator on formula_29 satisfying all four properties.

For every formula_35 and formula_36 the projection-valued measure forms a complex-valued measure on formula_1 defined as
:formula_38
with total variation at most formula_39. It reduces to a real-valued measure when
:formula_40
and a probability measure when formula_41 is a unit vector.

Example Let formula_42 be a -finite measure space and, for all formula_43, let 
:formula_44
be defined as
:formula_45
i.e., as multiplication by the indicator function formula_46 on &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;X&quot;). Then formula_47 defines a projection-valued measure. For example, if formula_48, formula_49, and formula_50 there is then the associated complex measure formula_51 which takes a measurable function formula_52 and gives the integral
:formula_53

== Extensions of projection-valued measures ==

If is a projection-valued measure on a measurable space (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;), then the map

: formula_54

extends to a linear map on the vector space of step functions on &quot;X&quot;. In fact, it is easy to check that this map is a ring homomorphism. This map extends in a canonical way to all bounded complex-valued measurable functions on &quot;X&quot;, and we have the following.

The theorem is also correct for unbounded measurable functions formula_55 but then formula_56 will be an unbounded linear operator on the Hilbert space formula_1.

This allows to define the Borel functional calculus for such operators and then pass to measurable functions via the Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem. That is, if formula_58 is a measurable function, then a unique measure exists such that
:formula_59

=== Spectral theorem ===

Let formula_1 be a separable complex Hilbert space, formula_61 be a bounded self-adjoint operator and formula_62 the spectrum of formula_63. Then the spectral theorem says that there exists a unique projection-valued measure formula_64, defined on a Borel subset formula_65, such that
:formula_66
where the integral extends to an unbounded function formula_67 when the spectrum of formula_63 is unbounded.

=== Direct integrals===

First we provide a general example of projection-valued measure based on direct integrals. Suppose (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, μ) is a measure space and let {&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; be a μ-measurable family of separable Hilbert spaces. For every &quot;E&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, let (&quot;E&quot;) be the operator of multiplication by 1&quot;E&quot; on the Hilbert space

:formula_69

Then is a projection-valued measure on (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;).

Suppose , ρ are projection-valued measures on (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) with values in the projections of &quot;H&quot;, &quot;K&quot;. , ρ are unitarily equivalent if and only if there is a unitary operator &quot;U&quot;:&quot;H&quot; → &quot;K&quot; such that

:formula_70

for every &quot;E&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;.

Theorem. If (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) is a standard Borel space, then for every projection-valued measure on (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) taking values in the projections of a &quot;separable&quot; Hilbert space, there is a Borel measure μ and a μ-measurable family of Hilbert spaces {&quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot;}&quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; , such that is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by 1&quot;E&quot; on the Hilbert space

:formula_69

The measure class of μ and the measure equivalence class of the multiplicity function &quot;x&quot; → dim &quot;H&quot;&quot;x&quot; completely characterize the projection-valued measure up to unitary equivalence.

A projection-valued measure is &quot;homogeneous of multiplicity&quot; &quot;n&quot; if and only if the multiplicity function has constant value &quot;n&quot;. Clearly,

Theorem. Any projection-valued measure taking values in the projections of a separable Hilbert space is an orthogonal direct sum of homogeneous projection-valued measures:

:formula_72

where

:formula_73

and

:formula_74

==Application in quantum mechanics==

In quantum mechanics, given a projection-valued measure of a measurable space formula_3 to the space of continuous endomorphisms upon a Hilbert space formula_1,

* the projective space formula_77 of the Hilbert space formula_1 is interpreted as the set of possible (normalizable) states formula_79 of a quantum system,
* the measurable space formula_3 is the value space for some quantum property of the system (an &quot;observable&quot;), 
* the projection-valued measure formula_6 expresses the probability that the observable takes on various values.

A common choice for formula_3 is the real line, but it may also be 

* formula_83 (for position or momentum in three dimensions ), 
* a discrete set (for angular momentum, energy of a bound state, etc.), 
* the 2-point set &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot; for the truth-value of an arbitrary proposition about formula_79.

Let formula_85 be a measurable subset of formula_3 and formula_79 a normalized vector quantum state in formula_1, so that its Hilbert norm is unitary, formula_89. The probability that the observable takes its value in formula_85, given the system in state formula_79, is

:formula_92

We can parse this in two ways. First, for each fixed formula_85, the projection formula_9 is a self-adjoint operator on formula_1 whose 1-eigenspace are the states formula_79 for which the value of the observable always lies in formula_85, and whose 0-eigenspace are the states formula_79 for which the value of the observable never lies in formula_85. 

Second, for each fixed normalized vector state formula_79, the association 

:formula_101
is a probability measure on formula_3 making the values of the observable into a random variable.

A measurement that can be performed by a projection-valued measure formula_6 is called a projective measurement. 

If formula_3 is the real number line, there exists, associated to formula_6, a self-adjoint operator formula_63 defined on formula_1 by

:formula_108

which reduces to

:formula_109

if the support of formula_6 is a discrete subset of formula_3. 

The above operator formula_63 is called the observable associated with the spectral measure.

==Generalizations==
The idea of a projection-valued measure is generalized by the positive operator-valued measure (POVM), where the need for the orthogonality implied by projection operators is replaced by the idea of a set of operators that are a non-orthogonal partition of unity. This generalization is motivated by applications to quantum information theory.

<text>Mark Mancina (born 1957) is an American film composer. A veteran of Hans Zimmer&#x27;s Media Ventures, Mancina has scored over sixty films and television series including &quot;Speed&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, &quot;Twister&quot;, &quot;Tarzan&quot;, &quot;Training Day&quot;, &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, &quot;Blood+&quot;, &quot;Planes&quot;, and &quot;Moana&quot;.

He has made several collaborations with The Walt Disney Company, and has won two Grammy Awards, and was nominated for an Annie Award for &quot;Brother Bear&quot;. For his work on the Disney Theatrical Productions adaptation of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Original Score in a Musical.

== Career ==

Mancina has worked primarily as a composer for Hollywood soundtracks, such as his collaboration with Trevor Rabin on the soundtrack for &quot;Con Air&quot;. He arranged many of the songs behind Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot; (while Hans Zimmer wrote the orchestral score with Nick Glennie-Smith and Lebo M for the African chants) including the Broadway musical. He composed the score for the thriller &quot;Twister&quot; (1996) and the action films &quot;Speed&quot; (1994) and &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1995). Mancina co-wrote several songs for Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s 1990 animated film &quot;&quot;.

Mancina collaborated with John Van Tongeren to write the theme to the 1995 revival of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;. They both scored ten episodes for the first season of the show. He collaborated with Phil Collins on two Disney animated feature films, &quot;Tarzan&quot; (for which soundtrack he and Collins received a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album) and &quot;Brother Bear&quot;. Mancina wrote and composed the arrangement of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; from 2006 to 2022 for the previous Walt Disney Pictures logo and was co-arranged with and orchestrated by David Metzger. Furthermore, he composed the music of the Disneynature logo, as well as co-composing the music of the 2013 DisneyToon Studios logo with Metzger.

Mancina composed the music for the 2005–06 anime television series &quot;Blood+&quot;, which had music produced by Hans Zimmer. Additionally in television, he composed score for &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; and &quot;Soldier Of Fortune, Inc&quot;.

Mancina has contributed to a number of progressive rock projects. He toured with Trevor Rabin in support of &quot;Can&#x27;t Look Away&quot; and went on to produce tracks on the Yes album &quot;Union&quot; in 1991. He worked with Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, as he coproduced their 1992 album, &quot;Black Moon&quot;, and he also wrote one song &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; on this record.

With playwright Glen Berger, Mancina has written a musical based on the film &quot;August Rush&quot;, for which he had written the score. Mancina and Berger cowrote the lyrics for the musical, with Mancina writing the music and Berger writing the book. Under the direction of John Doyle, it received its world premiere at the Paramount Theatre in Aurora, Illinois in May 2019.

Although he did not participate in the 2020 film &quot;Bad Boys for Life&quot;, his original theme for &quot;Bad Boys&quot; is used heavily throughout the film as well as the end credits.

== Personal life ==
He resides in Carmel, California, with his wife and daughter. Trained as a classical guitarist, he is an avid guitar player and rare instrument collector.

<text>Richmond Kickers is an American professional soccer club based in Richmond, Virginia. The Kickers compete as a member of USL League One (USL1). The club was established in 1993, and began play that same year as a United States Interregional Soccer League (now USL League Two) expansion team, which at the time, was the fourth tier of soccer in the United States.

The club&#x27;s majority owner is 22 Holdings, LLC, and its minority owners are Richmond Kickers Youth Soccer Club and the Ukrop family, a prominent family from the Greater Richmond Region who founded the Ukrop&#x27;s grocery chain. The company serves as the club&#x27;s primary uniform sponsor. Darren Sawatzky has been the club&#x27;s manager since 2019, taking over for David Bulow. The club&#x27;s director of soccer, Leigh Cowlishaw, coached the team from 2000 until 2018, making him one of the longest tenured professional soccer coaches in American soccer history.

The Kickers play their home league matches at City Stadium, with a reduced capacity of 6,000 seats for most matches. City Stadium has been the club&#x27;s primary home since 1995. The club has one primary supporters group: the Red Army, who sit in Section O of the stadium. Richmond has rivalries with fellow Mid-Atlantic and Deep South soccer clubs including the Charleston Battery and Greenville Triumph. The Kickers had an intrastate rivalry with the Virginia Beach Mariners, where the two sides competed for the James River Cup until the Mariners folded in 2009.

The Kickers played their inaugural match on May 8, 1993, winning 1–0 over the now defunct Columbia Spirit. Richmond has won eight trophies over the course of their history including four regular season titles across the second, third, and fourth divisions, and three playoffs championships across the third and fourth divisions. The club has won the U.S. Open Cup once, winning the domestic cup in 1995. The club earned a berth into the 1996 CONCACAF Cup Winners Cup, but ultimately did not play in the tournament.

Today the club is one of the most well-attended USL League One teams, with an average of 3,000 to 4,000 fans per match.

The team has been known to develop several players who has notable soccer careers. Some notable players who played for the Richmond Kickers include, Derrick Etienne, Dwayne De Rosario, and Matt Turner. Some players who played a majority of their career with Richmond include Matthew Delicâte, Yomby William, Robert Ukrop, and Kevin Jeffrey.

==History==

===1993–2019===
The Richmond Kickers were founded in 1993 and played their inaugural season in the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL), which, at the time, represented the third division of the American soccer pyramid. The team originally played their home matches on the campus of the University of Richmond and targeted players specifically from Virginia. After a poor season in 1994, the club self-relegated to the newly formed fourth-tier USISL Premier League, now known as the USL League Two. During the 1995 season, the Kickers battled to a 15–3 winning season and went on to win the first ever USISL Premier League championship, defeating the now-defunct Cocoa Expos in the championship. That same season, Richmond won their only, Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup championship. The following year, Richmond chose to rejoin the third division, where they reached the USISL Select League championship, only to lose to the California Jaguars in the finals.

For the next nine seasons, Richmond played in the second tier of the American soccer pyramid, earning the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup twice, in 1998 and 2001, as well as earning two conference championships. However, the club was never able to secure a division two league championship, their closest coming in 2005, when the Kickers fell to the Seattle Sounders in the 2005 USL First Division Championship. After the 2005 season, the Kickers ownership self-relegated the team back into the third division, citing possible financial problems for the club if they remained in the second tier. Since joining the third division, the Kickers have had tremendous success, making it to at least the playoff semifinals each season they have played in the third division. Additionally, the Kickers have won two third division premierships and two third division championships during their spell.

In September 2005, the club retired Rob Ukrop&#x27;s #6 jersey. Ukrop played for the inaugural 1993 Kickers and the 1995 U.S. Open Cup team, joined the New England Revolution at the launch of Major League Soccer before returning midway through the 1996 season to play out his career in his hometown.

Richmond Kickers have not only experienced league success, but have been perennial contenders in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup tournament. In the 2007 U.S. Open Cup, the Kickers defeated the Los Angeles Galaxy of the first division, Major League Soccer, 1–0 in the third round of competition. The Kickers won their First Round match of the 2008 U.S. Open Cup, beating the Fredericksburg Gunners of the PDL with a final scoreline of 3–0. The Kickers won their second-round game over the Western Mass Pioneers 2–1 before being eliminated from the Cup in the third round by MLS side, and defending USOC champion, New England Revolution, 3–0. In the 2011 US Open Cup the Kickers made a Cinderella run, defeating MLS clubs Columbus Crew and Sporting Kansas City to reach the semi-finals, before falling to the Chicago Fire.

The Kickers briefly sponsored two developmental teams of their own: Richmond Kickers Future and Richmond Kickers Destiny. Future played in the men&#x27;s USL Premier Development League from 2002 to 2008, while the Destiny played in the women&#x27;s USL W-League from 2004 to 2009. The Kickers entered a multi-year deal to become the USL Pro affiliate of D.C. United in 2013, and continued that affiliation through 2018. Loudoun United FC was launched as a fully owned-and-operated affiliate of D.C. United for the 2019 USL Championship season, presumably ending the Kickers&#x27; affiliation tenure.

===USL League One era and new ownership (2019–present)===
After two losing seasons in the second-division USL Championship, the Kickers announced that they were self-relegating and becoming inaugural members of the new third division league, USL League One. In addition to joining a new league, the Kickers announced that 22 Holdings, LLC, an organization consisting of former Davidson College soccer players and led by former Kickers player Rob Ukrop, had acquired a controlling interest in the team. The former majority owners, the Richmond Kickers Youth Soccer Club, would continue holding a minority interest in the team and operating as the team&#x27;s youth organization.

==Colors and badge==
The Kickers&#x27; primary colors are red and white, having been so since the beginning of the 2001 season. Their kits are manufactured by Adidas, as they have been since at least 2009. In March 2012, the Kickers revealed a new logo designed by branding firm yogg llc to celebrate 20 years since their inception. Along with the new crest, the club also announced they would be using a third uniform with the colors from their first season in 1993, green and blue. They also have a black kit they have used during the 2013 season.

For the 2022 season, the club released &quot;legacy kits&quot; for the season which included the club&#x27;s original green color in the home kits. The club used the original 1993 logo in the kits.

In January 2025, the club released their third logo, featuring an interlocking R and K, as well as alternative logos featuring a kangaroo.

===James River Cup===
The James River Cup was an annual competition held between the Richmond Kickers and the Virginia Beach Mariners (formerly Hampton Roads Mariners) which the team with the most points at the conclusion of all scheduled matches between the two teams would win. The Cup was held every year since 1996 with the exception of 1997 and 2001 when Virginia Beach did not field a team. In 2007, the Virginia Beach team was disbanded.

For the 2008 season, the James River Cup was contested between the Kickers&#x27; organization and the Hampton Roads Piranhas organization. The cup went to the organization that had the most points in games between their PDL and W-League teams. The series ended up tied 2–2–1, with the Piranhas winning the Cup on goal difference.

<text>The Old Gum Tree (also known as The Proclamation Tree) is a historic site in Glenelg North, South Australia. Near this tree on 28 December 1836, the British governor John Hindmarsh delivered the proclamation announcing the establishment of Government of the colony of South Australia. A ceremony is held each year at the site on Proclamation Day, with the current Governor reading out Hindmarsh&#x27;s original speech.

The tree itself, probably a red gum, had died by 1907. Its decayed outer surface was encased in concrete in 1963. 

It was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate in 1978 and listed on the South Australian Heritage Register in 1980.

<doc id="1046187" wikidata="Q2078681" url="?curid=1046187" title="Air Fortress">
<text>is an action-adventure video game developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in Japan in August 1987, in North America in September 1989 after an initial test release of 385 copies in 1987, and an Australian release in 1989.

== Story ==
The people of the planet Farmel, having recently gained the technology for space travel, eagerly explored the galaxy only to find a herd of monstrous &quot;Air Fortresses&quot; moving in their direction. They quickly discovered that the Fortresses behaved like interstellar locusts, consuming all of the resources and living things in their path. The Space Federation sent their mightiest fleet, which was quickly eliminated by the powerful Fortresses. In a final gambit they send a single warrior named Hal Bailman, outfitted with a shielded spacesuit, powerful weapons, and small &quot;lightship&quot; to infiltrate the Fortresses and destroy them from the inside out.

== Gameplay ==

As Hal Bailman, the player infiltrates the progressively more challenging Air Fortresses. Each Air Fortress has two levels: the Air Base and the Fortress itself.

=== Air Base ===
On approach to the Air Fortress, Hal Bailman battles the enemy from his lightship. The gameplay is that of a side-scrolling shooter. During this phase, the player has three attempts to successfully reach the Air Lock that grants access to the Air Fortress. Along the way, the player must dodge a variety of flying enemies and space station parts. The player also has a chance during this phase to collect energy and &quot;crash beam bullets&quot;, a more powerful ammunition that is limited in supply, that can be used inside the Fortress.

In this mode of play, a single hit will destroy the player&#x27;s ship. In the Japanese version, if Hal collides with an enemy while on his lightship he must restart the approach sequence from the beginning, but in the American version the player will automatically be respawned from the same point at which his ship was destroyed, provided that they have extra lives.

=== Air Fortress ===
Inside the Fortress, the game becomes an action-adventure game. The player now has more control over where they go, and finding one&#x27;s way through the massive Fortresses is one of the major challenges of the game. The player must navigate through the maze, fight off enemy robots, security devices, and spacemen with their beam weapon, locate and destroy the central core of the Fortress, and find their ship to escape. The last is perhaps the most difficult part, since the Fortress explodes shortly after the core is destroyed and the player only has a short window of time in which to escape, with the exit never situated in the same place as where the player entered the maze.

== Development and release ==
&quot;Air Fortress&quot; was developed by Japanese video game maker HAL Laboratory. &quot;SUGA&quot;, the password for the final air fortress, is a reference to &quot;Air Fortress&quot; director, game designer, and programmer Hiroaki Suga. While the US version credits sound composer Hideki Kanazashi as &quot;Rodeo Kanagushi&quot;, the Japanese version credits him as &quot;Jumper Kanagushi&quot;.

HAL America offered &quot;Air Fortress&quot; by mail order through a national advertising campaign. Players who purchased the game through HAL received a free &quot;Air Fortress&quot; T-shirt.

== Reception ==
&quot;Air Fortress&quot; garnered average reviews from critics. &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot;″s Andy Eddy remarked that the game offered &quot;a great deal&quot; of originally with its mixture of arcade and adventure aspects, but found the music to be repetitive and felt that the overall design could have used more color. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave the game positive ratings to its audiovisual presentation, control, challenge and fun factor. &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; commended the visuals but noted that the game&#x27;s difficulty increased quickly after the first fortress, and found the shooter sequences less interesting than the fortresses. &quot;Play Time&quot;″s Oliver Menne highlighted its smooth scrolling and lack of flickering, while praising HAL for their work with the graphics and music.

Retrospective reviews for &quot;Air Fortess&quot; have been more mixed. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Shelby Babb said that the game does a good job of combining side-scrolling shooting levels with exploration-style adventure. &quot;Game Freaks 365&quot;″s Stan Stepanic praised the music but felt mixed with the visuals, while criticizing its gameplay and difficulty level. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;″s Adam King felt overall mixed about the audiovisual presentation but commended the controls. A writer for &quot;Jeuxvideo.com&quot; gave the title a positive outlook.

<text>Sir Richard William Scott, (February 24, 1825 – April 23, 1913) was a Canadian politician and cabinet minister.

==Early life==
He was born in Prescott, Ontario, in 1825, a descendant of a family from County Clare. A lawyer by training, Scott was admitted to the bar in 1848 and established a practice in Bytown (now Ottawa).

==Political career==
Scott became a member of municipal council in 1851, was mayor of Bytown in 1852, and held a seat in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada from 1857 to 1863. With Canadian Confederation, Scott won a seat in the Ontario legislature as a Liberal representing Ottawa from 1867 to 1871. He was Speaker of the legislature briefly in December 1871 before he was appointed to the provincial cabinet as Commissioner of Crown Lands. Scott played a leading role in passing legislation ensuring the rights of separate schools in Ontario.

In November 1873, he left provincial politics when he was appointed minister without portfolio by Alexander Mackenzie in the federal Cabinet. Mackenzie had become prime minister after Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s government had been forced to resign because of the Pacific Scandal. Scott was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Mackenzie in January 1874 and became Secretary of State for Canada and Leader of the Government in the Senate.

A supporter of temperance, he drafted the &quot;Scott Act,&quot; which allowed any county or municipality in Canada to prohibit the retail sale of liquor by majority vote. With the defeat of the Liberal government in the 1878 election, Scott became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate until the return of the Liberals to government, under Wilfrid Laurier. Scott resumed his old Cabinet position of Secretary of State.

Scott retired from the cabinet in 1908 but remained in the Senate until his death in 1913.

He was made a knight in 1909 by King Edward VII.

==Family==

Richard William Scott was married in Philadelphia, Pa., November 8, 1853, to Mary Heron, the daughter of John Heron and Frances, his wife. She was born and educated in Dublin, Ireland. The couple had two sons William L. Scott, Local Master in Chancery, and D Arcy Scott, Barrister,
Ottawa and four daughters. Before her marriage, Mrs. Scott was a professional singer who toured in Canada and the United States as a member of &quot;The Heron sisters.&quot; The couple lived at 274 Daly Avenue, Ottawa. She served on the Executive Committee of the National Council of Women and as a Vice-President of the Local Council.

<doc id="1046193" wikidata="Q75292" url="?curid=1046193" title="Max Bodenheimer">
<text>Max Isidor Bodenheimer (; 12 March 1865 – 19 July 1940) was a lawyer and one of the main figures in German Zionism. An associate of Theodor Herzl, he was the first president of the Zionist Federation of Germany and one of the founders of the Jewish National Fund. After his flight in 1933 from Nazi Germany, and a short sojourn in Holland, he settled in Palestine in 1935.

== Biography==
Max Bodenheimer was born on 12 March 1865 in Stuttgart to an assimilated Jewish family. He studied at Tübingen, Strassburg, Berlin and Freiburg universities from 1884 to 1889.

In 1890 he moved to Cologne to start a law practice. In 1891 he published his first Zionist article in the weekly &quot;Die Menorah&quot; (Hamburg). In Cologne he met David Wolffsohn and the two became close friends. Bodenheimer and Wolffsohn participated in various Zionist groups and activities in Cologne and also established a Zionist group named “Zion”. At that time Bodenheimer began correspondence with Theodor Herzl. In 1893 he helped found the Jüdische Humanitätsgesellschaft.

In 1896 he married Rosa Dalberg and had three children: Simon Fritz, a professor of zoology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Henrietta Hannah, who wrote a biography of her father, and Ruth, a lawyer.

When Bodenheimer died, the national institutions flew flags at half staff and a eulogy was delivered by Ussishkin, president of the Jewish National Fund.

==Zionist activity==
Bodenheimer participated at the 1st Zionist Congress and was elected to be a member of the Inner Actions Committee. In 1898 he visited Palestine as a member of the delegation which accompanied Herzl to meet the German Emperor, Wilhelm II. 
Bodenheimer took part in the Zionist Congresses, helped to write the constitution of the Zionist movement and the Jewish National Fund (JNF), and was the chairman of the Board of Directors of the JNF in Germany. When the First World War broke out, he moved the JNF offices from Cologne to The Hague.

It seems like he was the author of the conception of the establishment of the League of East European States - a German client state with autonomous Jewish cooperation, later referred also as Judeopolonia.

Like other veterans from the Herzl period, Bodenheimer&#x27;s status declined after the First World War, and he was not re-elected as a member of the Board of Directors of the JNF. In August 1929, joins the Revisionist party led by Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky. Bodenheimer attended the 17th Zionist Congress as a representative of the Revisionist party. During the Congress, a sharp controversy arose between the majority and the Revisionist party concerning the &quot;ultimate goal&quot; of Zionism, and the Revisionists left the Congress. This was the last Zionist Congress in which Bodenheimer participated.

In 1935 Bodenheimer immigrated to Palestine and settled in Jerusalem, where he began writing his memoirs. He died in July 1940.

<text>, in English often shortened to bunka, is a form of Japanese embroidery originating in the early 19th century that became more widespread around the turn of the 20th century, before then being introduced to the US after World War II. Bunka artists use a specialized embroidery needle and rayon threads (originally silk) to create very detailed pictures that some liken to oil paintings. Typical subjects include people, living things (traditionally fish), landscapes and traditional Japanese scenes.

Bunka is considered a form of punch needle technique, and the rayon threads used are woven in a chainette format, which, when opened, gives a boucle texture to the yarn. Unlike other embroidery techniques, however, bunka is worked from the front of the fabric rather than the back.

Unlike some other forms of embroidery, bunka is fragile and is usually presented as artwork rather than as clothing adornment. Bunka has gained in popularity since the advent of numbered kits (similar to paint-by-number), which provide a step-by-step guide to producing artwork.

<doc id="1046200" wikidata="Q1017618" url="?curid=1046200" title="Slab City, California">
<text>Slab City, also called The Slabs, is an unincorporated, off-the-grid alternative lifestyle community consisting largely of snowbirds in the Salton Trough area of the Sonoran Desert, in Imperial County, California. It took its name from concrete slabs that remained after the World War II Marine Corps Camp Dunlap training camp was torn down. Slab City is known for attracting people who want to live outside mainstream society.

==History==
Prior to the United States&#x27; official entry into World War II, the United States Marine Corps planned a training ground for field and anti-aircraft artillery units in an area accessible by aircraft taking off from carriers near San Diego. To create the training base, were obtained. The government announced that the base was to be named after Marine Corps Brigadier General Robert Henry Dunlap. After construction of Camp Dunlap was completed, it was commissioned on October 15, 1942. The camp had fully functioning buildings, water, roads, and sewage collections. The base was used for three years during the war. By 1949, military operations at Camp Dunlap had been greatly reduced, but a skeleton crew continued on until the base was dismantled. By 1956, all buildings had been dismantled, but the concrete slabs remained.

The area that is now Slab City was the artillery training range for the Camp. It was first settled by a few veterans who had worked at the Marine base, followed later by drifters – then recreational vehicle owners, searching for free camping spots outside Palm Springs. Current residents refer to themselves as &quot;Slabbies&quot; while tourists are called &quot;Normies&quot;.

As of October 6, 1961, a quitclaim deed conveying the land to the State of California was issued by the Department of Defense as it was determined the land was no longer required. The deed did not contain any restrictions, recapture clauses, or restoration provisions. All of the former Camp Dunlap buildings had been removed. The remaining slabs were not proposed for removal. Later, legislation required that revenue generated from this property would go to the California State Teachers&#x27; Retirement System.

Slab City&#x27;s popularity surged after an article was printed in &quot;Trailer Life&quot; and &quot;RV Magazine&quot; around 1984. A 1988 &quot;San Diego Reader&quot; reports there were no more than 600–700 RVs around 1983, and one resident estimated there were about 2000 trailers when he was interviewed in March, 1988.

Leonard Knight, an early settler who created the Salvation Mountain art installation, was featured in Sean Penn&#x27;s &quot;Into the Wild,&quot; released in 2007. An obituary of Knight stated that he &quot;spent almost 30 years building the colorful mountain ... Built out of adobe and donated paint, Knight worked on the mountain all day, every day. He even slept at the mountain&#x27;s base in the back of a pick-up truck, with no electricity or running water&quot;.

An article in &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine in October 2018 referred to the community as a &quot;Squatters’ Paradise&quot; which locals consider to be &quot;one of America&#x27;s last free places.&quot; The article said of the population: &quot;There are clearly people there who don’t want to be found, so there’s something about disappearing, and the desert offers that kind of opportunity.&quot;

==Geography==
Slab City is located on roughly of public land, near the east shore of the Salton Sea. It is northeast of San Diego, southeast of Los Angeles and about from Mexico. To the east of Slab City is Coachella Canal, which is fenced, but the fence gets cut open periodically, especially at Slab City, according to the Coachella Valley Water District.

===Climate===
The area has a large amount of sunshine year round, due to its stable descending air and high pressure. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Slab City has a hot desert climate, &quot;BWh&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2020 that population is seasonal, and balloons up to about 4,000 during the winter, by some estimates, and dwindles to about 150 in the summer. Since the 1950s, Slab City has drawn a variety of people, such as anarchists, artists, eccentrics, outcasts, retirees, and the impoverished. A 1990 &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article by a journalist who stayed in the camp for a week estimated that winter residents (at the time) were mostly senior citizens over 60 years old. It is a &quot;popular winter destination for transients.&quot; Slab City is used by recreational vehicle owners, travellers, and squatters from across North America, including Canada.

==Economy==
According to the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Fred Dickey in 2012, the most common source of income among the permanent residents is &quot;probably&quot; SSI checks. In 2020, &quot;Ranker&quot; indicated that Slab City&#x27;s income mainly comes from tourists and donations. In 1995, almost every resident of Slab City collected disability benefits, social security or unemployment. Another steady source of income at the time was selling salvaged goods to visitors.

Many residents use generators or solar panels to generate electricity. Clean water is dispensed from a tank at the community church. The closest body of civilization with proper law enforcement is approximately southwest of Slab City, in Niland, where residents often went for basic shopping as of 1990. Residents were still obtaining essentials from Niland, a town of about 1,000, 30 years later in 2020.

==Arts and culture==
===Tourism===
Slab City has a free lending library, an outdoor music venue called The Range.

The settlement also has an internet cafe, a hostel, and a skatepark built inside what remains of the military base swimming pool.

During the 2020 pandemic, most tourist destinations, including Salvation Mountain, The Range, and Slab City&#x27;s Library, were closed.

====Salvation Mountain====

Located just east of California State Route 111, the entrance to Slab City is easily recognized by the colorful Salvation Mountain, which is a small hill approximately three stories tall and entirely covered in latex paint, concrete and adobe, and festooned with Bible verses. It was a project built over two decades by Slab City resident Leonard Knight. The work is a 50 ft-tall piece of religious folk art, &quot;an unofficial centrepiece for the community and [cementing] the area’s anarchic creative identity,&quot; according to a 2020 report.

In 2002, Salvation Mountain was named a Congressional National Folk-Art Treasure.

The current Salvation Mountain is actually the second construction to occupy the site; Knight began the first Salvation Mountain in 1984, using highly unstable construction methods that allowed the mountain to collapse in 1989. Knight was not discouraged; he rebuilt the structure using better materials and engineering, including adobe mixed with straw.

Before his death on February 10, 2014, Knight had been living in a nursing home. He was able to visit Salvation Mountain for the last time in May 2013; the visit was recorded by KPBS (TV).

====East Jesus====
&quot;East Jesus&quot; is an experimental and habitable art installation located in the Slab City area. There is no religious connotation in the name &quot;East Jesus&quot; – it is a colloquialism for a place in the middle of nowhere beyond the edge of serviceability. The off-grid facility operates with no municipal utilities.

In early 2007, Charlie Russell left his job in the technology industry, packed all his belongings into a shipping container, and sent it to a trash-strewn field, where he began to surround his two cars with sculptures. Russell, often called Container Charlie, renamed this settlement site &quot;East Jesus&quot;. He died in May 2011. The Chasterus Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit formed after his death in 2011, has since guided the curation and expansion of &quot;East Jesus.&quot;

&quot;East Jesus&quot; features a variety of experimental art, such as live events, performance art, music, photography, and most prominently sculptures. Works are continually added, and degrade quickly in the desert climate, despite the presence of caretakers. One such volunteer referred to it, and Slab City as a whole, as a ‘salvagepunk’ ethos. &quot;East Jesus&quot; pieces are described as decaying, or growing, but always in a state of transformation -unlike traditional galleries- due both to the intense climate, and the thousands of contributing artists who have added to the installation. In 2014, live-in staff were giving dozens of free tours, and hosted visiting artists and overnight guests.

====The Range====
The Range is an open-air nightclub complete with stage, lights, amplifiers, and speakers, with tattered couches and old chairs for seating. Every Saturday night at around dusk, locals and visitors meet for a talent show that features permanent resident musicians and anyone else who wants to get on stage and perform. The venue is run by old-time resident William Ammon, known as &quot;Builder Bill.&quot; Ammon&#x27;s wife, Robin Ammon, collected old prom dresses for people to wear; these are used when the community puts on a prom, because many residents have never been able to actually attend one.

==Government==
Dirt roads are graded by Imperial County and are regularly patrolled by the Imperial County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, as well as by Border Patrol agents searching for illegal immigrants; Slab City is about from Mexico. Fire service for Slab City is provided by the Niland Fire Department. School buses come from nearby communities to pick up the few children there.

==Community==
Slab City is divided into a handful of neighborhoods with different characteristics. As of 2020, the community is largely divided into two: &quot;East Jesus&quot; and &quot;Slab City&quot;. Thousands of campers and RV owners, many retired, use the site during the winter months. The &quot;snowbirds&quot; stay only for the winter before migrating north in spring, to cooler climates. Despite the high temperatures, there are about 150 permanent residents of Slab City. Some of these &quot;Slabbers&quot; or &quot;Year-Rounders&quot; derive their living from government programs and have been driven to Slab City by poverty or job loss. Others have voluntarily moved, to learn how to live off the grid, or otherwise be isolated. &quot;Builder Bill&quot; Ammon described &quot;a kind of segregation&quot; between the older residents, who would exchange goods and services, and young residents, who are sometimes &quot;ill-equipped&quot; for self-sufficiency, or turn to petty theft and drug use.

As of a January 2020 report, Slab City is composed of &quot;more than a dozen individual neighborhoods ... small camps of people with their own particular rules and culture.&quot; Amenities include The Range, a makeshift library, RV rental units, an internet cafe, and establishments that sell food, though most shopping is done at the town of Niland. One resident is reported to have run a weekly self-help group for women in the community. Residents talked about using CB radio as a bulletin board and adopting radio handles when they spoke to the Chicago Tribune in 1990. In 2005, a resident told a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; correspondent for the &quot;On The Streets&quot; documentary how he can just live however he wants.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were heavily impacted by the loss of tourist income, which also provided food and water. Social distancing was also a difficulty, as many residents work closely to trade and maintain services. The pandemic was complicated by the elderly population, no health infrastructure within Slab City (the nearest hospital is 40 minutes away, in Brawley), a lack of insurance, a lack of running water and sanitation, and anti-governmental or conspiratorial beliefs. Residents raised concerns over a past failure to contain an outbreak of canine parvo. As of April 2020, Imperial County had not provided any specific assistance for vulnerable communities.

===Crime===
Crystal meth is fairly common and accounts for much of the crime in Slab City. In 2015, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the usual cause for police response to Slab City is over camping boundary disputes, sometimes burglary, but that methamphetamine use is a recurrent problem. In December 2019, during the two-day Imperial Valley fugitive-seeking effort named Operation Valley Grinch, four fugitives hiding in Slab City were apprehended. The locals also cut the fence to unlawfully use Coachella Canal as a swimming spot.

==Future plans==
Some reports claim that the land is owned by the State of California, while others from 1993 report that the land was purchased by a building contractor. As of 2021, California had not yet decided to sell the land, but the Lands Commission is considering having the land appraised, and, if needed, allow for cleanup due to military waste from the 1950s.

In 2015, several residents formed the Slab City Community Group in an effort to prevent a sale. The group explored obtaining of Slab City in a trust, though this was a contentious issue with other residents. A May 2020 article confirmed that the state was hoping to sell the land. &quot;A sale could potentially go to energy companies ... Many residents worry that a deal could leave them without a community or place to live, as the lawless Slab City has become the last resort for so many.&quot;

<text>The Ross Barnett Reservoir, often called the Rez, is a reservoir of the Pearl River between Madison and Rankin counties in the U.S. state of Mississippi. The lake serves as the state&#x27;s largest drinking water resource, and is managed by the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District. The lake features of shoreline impounded on the south by a man-made dam and spillway. The western shore is bounded by the historic Natchez Trace Parkway.

== History ==
Construction on the Ross Barnett Reservoir began in 1960 by MWH Engineering (now MWH Global) under the direction of the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District. The main purpose of the infrastructure project was to create a permanent water source to supply drinking water for the Mississippi capital city of Jackson. Flooding of the Jackson section of the Pearl River had been studied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers since 1930 and city leaders envisioned commercial and industrial benefits from land reclamation associated with flood control. The Jackson Chamber of Commerce prior to the completion of the reservoir promoted riparian land reclamation with industrial development, a new bypass for U.S. Highway 49 constructed upon a levee, straightening the Pearl River channel and potential navigation. Construction on the lake was completed in 1963, and the water level reached average capacity in 1965. The August 17, 1969 passage of Hurricane Camille over the reservoir caused the surface to tilt and created a one foot level increase at the dam. As part of a national survey the federal government sampled five Mississippi reservoirs in 1973 and determined the Ross Barnett waters to be eutrophic, ranking second among the Mississippi reservoirs in overall trophic quality. In the 1980s two power companies including the local electricity producer, Mississippi Power and Light Company, made applications to the federal government authorities to modify the dam to produce hydropower.

The 1979 Easter flood at Jackson initiated planning to create additional levees below the reservoir and studies of a 68 foot high, dry dam called Shoccoe above the reservoir.

Waterspouts occurred in the reservoir on April 15, 2011, August 19, 2012 and July 23, 2014.

Planning began to provide parks and recreation areas in conjunction with the newly formed lake. Today, the Ross Barnett Reservoir serves as a significant water source, a major recreational area, and a catalyst for residential and economic development. There are 4,600 homes along the reservoir in Madison and Rankin counties.

==Name controversy==
The reservoir is named for Ross R. Barnett, the 53rd governor of Mississippi, who was known nationwide for his vigorous support for segregation. This has led to multiple petitions and other calls for the name to be changed.

==Management==
The Ross Barnett Reservoir is managed by the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District (PRVWSD), an agency of the State of Mississippi. In addition to recreation, the reservoir serves as the primary source of drinking water for the City of Jackson&#x27;s O. B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant. Water released into the Pearl River is monitored and controlled from an electrical/mechanical spillway and gate system that is part of a man-made earthen dam comprising most of the lake&#x27;s southern shore. The maximum output of the 10-gate spillway is . The guaranteed minimum flow was not included in the statute creating the reservoir, but the flow was included in the operational permit. The final design of the reservoir could not be purposed as a flood control project. The target elevation for the lake is above sea level in the summer; in the winter. The average depth is , water clarity is with occasions of , and the water color is stained. The lowest pool level in the last eight years was MLS according to a 1996 boating map, but the lowest pool was according to federal data for 2000. Drought conditions occurred in 2007 prompting local concerns. Seismic tests were performed below the surface of the reservoir in the fall of 2012 by an energy company.

==Recreation==
Each year over two million people visit the Ross Barnett Reservoir for outdoor recreation: types include boating, fishing, water-skiing, and camping. There are five campgrounds, 16 parks, 22 boat launches, three handicapped-accessible trails, two multi-purpose trails, and a mountain bike trail which meanders near Mule Jail Lake. Two state records come from the reservoir: Smallmouth buffalo (57 lbs 12 oz) and Bowfin (18 lbs 14 oz). In 1974, a state record Paddlefish of 65 lbs was caught at the spillway. In 1978 the Bassmaster Classic World Championship was held at the reservoir. In late March 2019 fishermen reported abundant and large Black crappie when normally White crappie are the main catch.

<text>Yarralumla () is a large inner south suburb of Canberra, the capital city of Australia. Located approximately south-west of the city, Yarralumla extends along the south-west bank of Lake Burley Griffin from Scrivener Dam to Commonwealth Avenue.

In 1828, Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant, was granted a lease on the western side of West Ridge, part of which is now Western Park. In 1832, he named his property &quot;Yarralumla&quot;, adopted from the name for an area some 35km to the west surrounding the Goodradigbee River. It is thought the area, spelt &#x27;Yarrowlumla&#x27;, was so named by local Aboriginal people, translated to English as &quot;echo mountain&quot;. In 1881, the estate was bought by Frederick Campbell, grandson of Robert Campbell who had built a house at nearby Duntroon. Frederick completed the construction of a large, gabled, brick house on his property in 1891 that now serves as the site of Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. Campbell&#x27;s house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead, the main portions of which were erected from local stone in the 1830s. Among the old Yarralumla homestead&#x27;s most notable occupants were Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, who owned Yarralumla sheep station from 1837 to 1859, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, who owned the property from 1859 to 1881, and Augustus&#x27; father Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873).

The modern suburb of Yarralumla was gazetted by the government in 1928 and was home to approximately 3,120 people and many diplomatic missions. Notable locations include Lennox Gardens, the Albert Hall and the Hotel Canberra. Parliament House and The Lodge lie just outside its boundary.

== Geography ==
Yarralumla is located in the central Canberra district of South Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory, a federal territory. It is bordered by Lake Burley Griffin to the north, Commonwealth Avenue and Capital Hill to the east, Adelaide Avenue and the Cotter Road to the south, and Scrivener Dam, Lady Denman Drive and part of the Molonglo River to the west. Its southeast corner abuts Capital Hill, the location of Parliament House. The Lodge lies across Adelaide Avenue near its eastern end.
The streets in Yarralumla are named after Australian governors and botanists. Most of the older streets in the suburb are laid out on an approximately rectangular grid with some curved sections, while the more hilly eastern end of the suburb, including the embassy district, is set out with contour-guided roads. Major roads in Yarralumla include Banks Street, Novar Street and Hopetoun Circuit in a north–south direction and Schlich Street, Loftus Street and Weston Street running east–west. Being a dormitory suburb, there are no major through roads. Access to the rest of the city can be made from Adelaide Avenue, Commonwealth Avenue, Lady Denman Drive and Cotter Road, all of which run along the borders of the suburb. From these roads, entry to the suburb can be gained by turning into roads such as Coronation Drive, Hopetoun Circuit and Novar Street. Yarralumla has wide, tree-lined streets, most of which have been planted with exotic trees such as atlas cedars and cherry plums on Banks Street, claret ashes on Loch Street, pin oaks on Schlich Street and English oaks and hawthorns on Weston Street, along with the indigenous white brittle gums on Empire Circuit and river oaks on Solander Place.

Much of the area of Yarralumla consists of open space or non-residential development, including Weston and Stirling Parks, the Royal Canberra Golf Club, and the grounds of Government House. Many houses are occupied by diplomatic missions. The embassy area of Yarralumla is located towards the eastern end of the suburb next to Stirling Park. It is the hilliest area of Yarralumla. The Parliamentary Triangle is located to its east.

The residential areas of Yarralumla are located in the central and western areas of the suburb. The Yarralumla shops at the corner of Novar and Bentham Streets are in the centre of the western residential area, which has typically flat terrain and streets laid out in a rectangular grid, typically lined by exotic trees. This area has a blend of original weatherboard, monocrete and brick dwellings as well as some recently rebuilt detached houses, dual occupancies and units. Minimbah Court at the corner of Banks and Schlicht Streets is an example of Canberra’s earlier medium-density unit buildings. It was constructed in the 1950s and originally named Solander Court in line with nearby streets named after First Fleet botanists. There is an elongated reserve with a walking and bicycle path running in a southwards direction of the Yarralumla Oval, and to the east of this is the central area of the suburb, where the blocks are larger and the streets are more contoured due to the hilly terrain. There is a mixture of housing types in this region, with some larger two-storey houses, and more expansive gardens. The streets in this part of the suburb are typically lined with native trees.

Yarralumla is located on the Yarralumla Formation which is a mudstone/siltstone formation that was formed around 425 million years ago during the Silurian Period. The formation extends from Red Hill and Woden in the South to Lake Burley Griffin in to the north, passing under the suburb of Yarralumla. The formation is evidence of the last major marine sedimentary period when eastern Australia was still covered by shallow seas. It shows fossil evidence of trilobites, coral and primitive crinoids. The Yarralumla brickworks quarry and the Deakin anticline are places where the formation is exposed and easily studied.

== History ==

===European settlement ===
Like the rest of Canberra, Yarralumla forms part of the traditional lands of the Nymuddy people. The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants made to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived on the brig &quot;Ellen&quot; with his wife and family on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of West Ridge. He gave it the name Yarralumla which was taken from the Aboriginal name for a steep-sided valley of the Murrumbidgee River near Mount Stromlo. Sometimes spelled &quot;Yarrowlumla&quot;, the name &#x27;Yarralumla&#x27; was first used on a map by the surveyor Robert Dixon in 1829. Donnison&#x27;s land was named &quot;Yarralumla&quot; in a survey of the area conducted in 1834, and was a name used by the local people for the Mount Stromlo ridge, which lies to the west of the current suburb, and is said to mean &quot;echo mountain&quot;. An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.
A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who bought the land from John Stephen on 7 March 1839.

The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for New South Wales, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. Murray settled Yarralumla and part of Winderradeen (near Collector) on his wife in trust so that they would have some property if he became bankrupt. On his wife&#x27;s death in 1858 Yarralumla passed in trust to her father and her brother Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). In May 1859, Augustus&#x27; parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead.

Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell&#x27;s house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia&#x27;s official Canberra residence, known colloquially as &quot;Yarralumla&quot; or &quot;Government House&quot;. Campbell also built the large wooden Yarralumla Woolshed nearby in 1904.

In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia and in 1913 the Commonwealth Government purchased the property. Tenant farmers were allowed to stay on the land on annual leases, some remaining until 1963 when the Molonglo River was dammed to form Lake Burley Griffin.

=== Development ===

With the construction of Australia&#x27;s capital city underway, the Yarralumla brickworks were established in 1913 to supply building material. The bricks were used for many of Canberra&#x27;s buildings, including the provisional Parliament House. The Brickworks tramway, a 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) goods railway, was constructed for the transportation of bricks to some of the major building sites in central Canberra. This linked the brickworks to places such as Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House.

Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and Westbourne Woods arboretum was started in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra&#x27;s environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation of more than two million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and functioning as a retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.

In 1917, the designer of Canberra, Walter Burley Griffin, named the area surrounding the brickworks &quot;Westridge&quot;. It was part of the original Griffin plan, and the objective was to provide a &#x27;horticultural suburb&#x27; and a &#x27;society suburb&#x27;. In Griffin&#x27;s 1918 document &quot;Canberra: Plan of City and Environs&quot;, the suburb is shown as an isosceles triangle with two equal length roads leading from Capital Hill to Yarralumla Bay and Clianthus Centre respectively. The latter road is now to location of the arterial Adelaide Avenue, and Yarralumla Bay and Clianthus Centre was to be joined along a north-south axis by Novar Avenue (originally to be named Mountain Way), extending all the way to the future lake bearing Griffin&#x27;s name. Griffin&#x27;s vision was for Westridge to become a business centre with an urban waterfront and
promenade, complemented by the bush surroundings. Griffin&#x27;s design was based on a strict hierarchy with core services such as housing, communal space and facilities such health and education, and commercial space. These would be connected outward by boulevards linking to transport routes and trams. By 1928, there were over 130 people on the electoral roll for Westridge. The majority of the population consisted of men working at the brickworks and nursery. The suburb was gazetted as Yarralumla on 20 September 1928.
In 1922, a workers&#x27; tent camp was erected on the eastern side of Stirling Ridge to house the men working on the main intercepting sewer. The following year saw the start of the construction of 62 small, four-room, unlined timber cottages, to be used as housing for the married tradesmen involved in the construction of the provisional Parliament House. Other camps were established at the eastern end of Stirling Park on the hills opposite modern Lotus Bay. The first of these was contractor John Howie&#x27;s settlement (1922–1930), consisting of 25 timber cottages for his married men and timber barracks (Hostel Camp) for his single men. Two other single men&#x27;s tent camps were established nearby—Old Tradesmen&#x27;s Camp (1923–1927) and No 1 Labourers Camp (1924–1927). The men from Howie&#x27;s worked on the Hotel Canberra and the others on the construction of the provisional Parliament House and nearby administrative buildings. The Stirling Park camps were known as Westlake to their new inhabitants, and previously &quot;Gura Bung Dhaura&quot; (stony ground) to the local Aboriginal people. In 1925, the population of this temporary suburb was 700. This represented roughly one-fifth of the total population of the Federal Capital Territory at the time. In 1956, the Department of Interior decided to clear the settlement so that embassies could be built. In 1960, the member of parliament for the ACT, Jim Fraser, described Westlake as one of two &quot;hidden valleys of disgrace, which are never shown to tourists and are seen by visitors only by chance&quot;.

The Commonwealth and the states agreed in 1911 that Australia needed adequately-trained foresters, although they did not agree to establish a forestry school until 1920. Prime minister Stanley Bruce promised to fund it during the 1925 election campaign and construction of the Commonwealth Forestry School commenced in 1926 at Westridge near the brickworks and Westbourne Woods. The now heritage-listed Forestry School and the associated principal&#x27;s residence Westridge House are located on Banks Street, Yarralumla. The school was initially established in March 1926 at the University of Adelaide under the leadership of Charles Lane Poole. After the move to Canberra Lane-Poole acted as principal until 1944. Its permanent building in Yarralumla was designed by Federal Capital Commission architects J.H. Kirkpatrick, and H.M. Rolland. It is built in the Inter-War Stripped Classical style as a single storey rendered brick building with a parapet and a hipped tiled roof. Various Australian woods, including Queensland maple and walnut (Cryptocarya palmerstonii), red cedar, red mahogany, hoop pine and mountain ash, were used throughout the building. It opened in April 1927 and it was completed in June. Due to financial stringency during the Great Depression and other priorities during the Second World War, it had few students in its first years. The Forestry School was absorbed by the Australian National University in 1965 and forestry courses are now carried out at its main campus in Acton. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Forestry and Forestry Products subsumed the school in 1975. Westridge House, an impressive Tudor-style structure, was completed in January 1928. It underwent a A$500,000 refurbishment and was later used as a residence for the chief officer of the CSIRO. The former Forestry School and Westridge House are now leased out by the CSIRO.

=== After World War II ===
The current geographical boundary of Yarralumla was finalised in the early 1960s with the construction of Scrivener Dam, over which Lady Denman Drive passes, allowing for the Molonglo River to be dammed, creating Lake Burley Griffin. Construction began in September 1960 and the dam was locked on 20 September 1963. The lake reached the planned level on 29 April 1964. On 17 October 1964, Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies commemorated the filling of the lake. Yarralumla was expanded to include Westlake, which had up until then been part of Acton.

After the Second World War, the suburb began to expand rapidly with the construction of many private homes. Yarralumla&#x27;s image as a lower-class suburb would persist into the 1960s and 1970s. This general perception began to alter once Lake Burley Griffin had been created and its surrounds landscaped into parklands; the area soon gained a reputation for its attractive lakeside location. During the 1980s, house prices began to rise coincident with a rejuvenation of the suburb. Many of the original government-built monocrete, brick, and weatherboard houses have been demolished and replaced by larger dwellings of a variety of more modern styles and materials, although this process was more advanced in the central part of the suburb than in its east in 2004.

== Demographics ==
The population of the Westridge area on the 1928 electoral roll numbered over 130. At the , Yarralumla had a population of 3,120 people. Of these 47.9% were male. The suburb had only 0.9% indigenous Australians, below the national average of 3.2%. The percentage of married people in the suburb was 12 points higher than the national average, and the proportion of residents who had never married was 10 points lower. The higher level of marriage did not translate into a higher level of children; 49.6% of families consisted of a couple without children in the household, compared to the national average of 38.8%. Yarralumla residents had a median age of 50, compared to a Canberra average of 35. The suburb had an older population for a city of young people; the median national age is 38 and 43.5% of Yarralumla residents were 55 or over, compared to the national figure of 29.1%.

Yarralumla is a comparatively wealthy suburb with a 2021 median weekly personal income of $1,591; this compares to the figure of $1,203 for the entire Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and $805 for all of Australia. The public service or defence force employed around 20.8% of the workforce, somewhat less than the ACT average of 22.9%. This compared to 1.8% for Australia as a whole. The higher incomes were derived from the suburb&#x27;s white-collar base; 68.0% of Yarralumla&#x27;s workforce was employed as professionals or in managerial posts, compared to 37.7% nationally. In contrast, only 2.9% were engaged in blue-collar occupations, compared with 15.3% for the nation as a whole.

== Notable places ==

Yarralumla has a large number of landmarks and places of historical interest. The Governor-General&#x27;s residence Government House, which shares the name &quot;Yarralumla&quot;, is located at the western end of the suburb in of parkland. It sits alongside Lake Burley Griffin, next to the Royal Canberra Golf Club and Scrivener Dam. The house was built in 1891 as the headquarters for the &quot;Yarralumla&quot; property. Also located alongside Scrivener Dam is the National Zoo &amp; Aquarium. The nearby Yarralumla woolshed is available for event hire, often playing host to parties and bush dances. The land surrounding the woolshed has been developed as an equestrian park, including areas for showjumping, eventing and endurance riding.

The Yarralumla brickworks were the first industrial manufacturing facility in the ACT; they were closed temporarily several times due to the Great Depression and both World Wars. Proposals to modernise the brickworks were rejected by the National Capital Development Commission in the early 1970s and they closed permanently in 1976; the site is closed to the public and is in a state of disrepair. The unfenced parkland around the brickworks is a popular recreation area for Yarralumla residents. As of 2020, residential development is proposed for the site, which is , to initially include 1,800 new dwellings, although the project has been scaled down.
The eastern end of Yarralumla is home to many of the diplomatic missions in Canberra, many of which are built in a traditional style reflecting that of their respective home countries. Examples of regionally styled chanceries include the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Thailand, and the High Commissions of India and Papua New Guinea. The United States embassy was the first embassy built in Canberra, with the foundation stone laid on the Fourth of July, 1942. The embassy compound was built in a &quot;typically American&quot; Georgian style, using Australian materials, and was inspired by several buildings designed by Christopher Wren for Virginia at the beginning of the 18th century. The French embassy includes the French-Australian War Memorial opened in 1961, which has a sculpture by André Bizette-Lindet called Winged Victory. Canberra tourist drives take tourists on a car-based tour past many of Canberra&#x27;s embassies including those located in Yarralumla, zig-zagging through the eastern side of Yarralumla past many of the missions.

The Lennox Gardens, Yarralumla Yacht Club, Albert Hall and the Hotel Canberra are located in the eastern end of the suburb. Located on Commonwealth Avenue, the Hotel Canberra opened in 1924 to accommodate politicians when Parliament was in session; Prime Minister James Scullin stayed there to avoid the running costs of the official residence, The Lodge during the Great Depression. It has been heritage listed as an example of the distinctive Garden-Pavilion style of architect John Smith Murdoch in line with the garden city design of Burley Griffin. The hotel was closed in 1974 and the buildings served as an annexe for Parliament House between 1976 and 1984. The Hyatt Hotel Group re-opened the hotel in 1987. Adjacent to the Canberra Hotel is the Canberra Croquet Club. The only croquet club in Canberra, it was opened in 1928 and was restricted to females until 1975. As with the hotel, the clubhouse was built in federation-style architecture and has been heritage-listed along with the croquet lawns. Immediately to the north of Canberra Hotel on Commonwealth Avenue is Albert Hall, built in 1927, which was in the early years of Canberra, one of the main centres of social, musical, theatrical, ceremonial and artistic activity in the capital. It was opened by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce and the subject of royal visits. Although its functionality has been superseded by more specialised entertainment and cultural institutions built in modern times, it is still frequently used for community events. It has been heritage listed for its social and historical value, and as an example of early Canberra architecture.

<text>Craftsman is a line of tools, lawn and garden equipment, and work wear. Originally a house brand established by Sears, the brand is now owned by Stanley Black &amp; Decker.

As with all Sears products, Craftsman tools were not manufactured by Sears during the company&#x27;s ownership, but made under contract by various other companies. While Sears did not directly manufacture tools and equipment in most cases, they did have ownership in some of their suppliers. An example of this was the joint venture that they established with Western Forge in 1965 and their partial ownership of Roper for a number of years. Both companies supplied products to Sears for many years. They were first sold in 1927 through the Sears catalog and in Sears retail stores. After the Sears–Kmart merger, the tools were also for sale in Kmart stores and through several other retailers.

In March 2017, Stanley Black &amp; Decker acquired the Craftsman brand from Sears Holdings, which retained a limited license for Craftsman products.

==History==

The Craftsman trademark was registered by Sears on May 20, 1927. Arthur Barrows, head of the company&#x27;s hardware department, liked the name Craftsman and reportedly bought the rights to use it from the Marion-Craftsman Tool Company for $500 (). The brand&#x27;s early customers were mostly farmers. Barrows&#x27; successor, Tom Dunlap, upgraded the quality of the tools and added chrome plating to them as America moved into the automobile age.

Sears&#x27;s tool line, like many of its other product lines, used a &quot;good, better, best&quot; pricing structure, with the Craftsman brand as the middle tier and Craftsman Professional or Craftsman Industrial as the highest tier. Craftsman Professional and Craftsman Industrial are marketed as being comparable to brands like Cornwell Quality Tools, SK, Snap-on, Proto, Mac, and Matco. The standard Craftsman line is marketed as being comparable in quality to other mid-price brands including UltraPro (NAPA), Westward, Husky, and Kobalt.

The lowest tier was originally branded &quot;Sears&quot;. The company also used the &quot;Dunlap&quot; name for its lesser quality tools from the late 1930s until the late 1950s. The Sears tool line was discontinued in the late 1980s and replaced by the &quot;Companion&quot; tool line. The Companion tool line was itself discontinued and replaced by the &quot;Evolv&quot; tool line in 2008 designed by Ellen Tave Glassman, VP Hardines Design Craftsman, with a focus on homeowners and DIYers. Evolv tools also have a lifetime warranty but require that the customer have the original dated receipt to make a claim.

From 1991 until the store&#x27;s demise, Sears ran the Craftsman Club loyalty program, one of the oldest such programs by a retailer.

Craftsman tools were sold in Sears and sister store Kmart, as well as US military Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service stores, Navy Exchange stores, Summit Racing Equipment, Blain&#x27;s Farm &amp; Fleet, W. W. Grainger, Ace Hardware, Montgomery Ward, Lowe&#x27;s, and Amazon.

On January 5, 2017, Stanley Black &amp; Decker announced its intent to acquire the Craftsman brand in a deal with a total value of $900 million (with an up-front payment of $525 million, and a payment of $250 million after three years). Sears will hold a royalty-free license to the Craftsman brand for a 15-year period after the completion of the sale, and will receive a royalty on all new Craftsman sales over this period. Afterwards, Sears will pay Stanley Black &amp; Decker a 3% licensing fee. The deal was closed on March 9, 2017. Sears maintains the right to manufacture and sell tools using existing supply channels under the Craftsman name for 15 years.

Lowe&#x27;s announced in October 2017 that it would start carrying Craftsman tools beginning in the late half of 2018.

==Sourcing==
Sears has never manufactured Craftsman products itself, instead relying on other manufacturers to make the products for them following Sears designs and specifications, and then applying the Craftsman brand name. Sometimes, the Craftsman branded items include exclusive features or functions that separate them from the manufacturer&#x27;s own brand or other brands that the manufacturer produces. At other times, Craftsman products are identical to models of other brands with a different name on them.

The hardline mechanic&#x27;s tools (such as socket wrenches) that make up the core of the brand have been made by a variety of manufacturers over the years, including New Britain, Moore Drop Forging, Stanley, Easco Hand Tools, Danaher Corporation, and most recently, Apex Tool Group. Screwdrivers have been manufactured by Pratt-Read and Western Forge, but until around 2017–2018 were supplied mostly by the latter company, which also had supplied pliers and adjustable wrenches. Western Forge no longer supplies Craftsman tools.

Beginning in 2010, hand tools manufactured for Craftsman by Apex Tool Group (formerly known as Danaher) such as ratchets, sockets, and wrenches began to be sourced overseas (mainly in China, although some are produced in Taiwan), while tools produced for Craftsman by Western Forge such as adjustable wrenches, screwdrivers, pliers and larger mechanic tool sets were still made in the United States, although most, if not, all of the production for these products has moved to Asia. Sears still has an &quot;Industrial&quot; line which is sold through various authorized distributors. These tools are made in the US, appearing identical to their previous non-industrial US made counterparts, save for the &quot;Industrial&quot; name stamped on them. They are manufactured by Apex on the US production lines that previously produced the US-made standard Craftsman product before production switched overseas to Asia.

Shortly after Stanley acquired the Craftsman brand, Stanley announced the construction of a factory in northern Fort Worth, Texas to bring Craftsman tool manufacturing back to the US. This arrangement was short-lived, however, as the plant produced some ratchets and sockets, but due to equipment problems, could not produce the needed volume that was originally expected. The plant closed shortly thereafter.

Many Craftsman portable power tools have been manufactured by Techtronic Industries who acquired the prior supplier—Diehl Motor Company (a one time division of Singer) and Ryobi. Sears hand power tools have also been produced by DeWalt under the &quot;900&quot; model prefix. Some, such as the corded and cordless drills, were indistinguishable, other than the color and decal labels. Many Craftsman bench and stationary power tools were manufactured by Emerson Electric under the &quot;113&quot; model prefix (previously under the &quot;103&quot; model prefix which was King-Seeley, but Emerson bought them out in the 1960s) and DeWalt. Air compressors were manufactured by DeVilbiss Air Power (formerly part of Dewalt. DeVilbiss is now owned by MAT Holdings who made compressors for Sears under the &quot;921&quot; model prefix), and formerly by Campbell Hausfeld under the &quot;106&quot; model prefix.

Tool storage has typically been manufactured by Waterloo Industries (&quot;706&quot; model prefix), however, as of 2017, they were acquired by Stanley, Black and Decker, and , Waterloo no longer manufactures tool storage for the Sears line of Craftsman. It is now supplied under the &quot;714&quot; model prefix by Montezuma Tool Storage, but the Craftsman tool storage sold in Lowes is still Waterloo made. The Craftsman-branded garage door openers are manufactured by the Chamberlain Group (&quot;139&quot; model prefix). Hammers have been produced by Vaughan-Bushnell (coded &quot;M&quot; on the tool). Many of the automotive specialty tools such as feeler gauges and gap gauges have been made by A&amp;E Tool Company of Racine, Wisconsin (these tools will have an &quot;S&quot; logo in a circle). Ullman Devices of Ridgefield, Connecticut makes many of the magnetic pick up tools, picks, and inspection mirrors for Sears.

==Quality and reputation==
In 2007, a Harris Interactive poll gave Craftsman the highest score for both &quot;Brand Expectations&quot; and &quot;Trust&quot;. In 2009, the readers of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; named Craftsman their favorite brand of hand tools in their Reader&#x27;s Choice Awards.

==Sponsorships==
Under Sears ownership, Craftsman was the first title sponsor of the NASCAR Truck Series from 1996 to 2008, which was branded as the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. In 2022, Stanley Black &amp; Decker acquired the sponsorship rights beginning in the 2023 season, replacing Camping World. Owing to its present ownership of the brand, it was announced that Craftsman would return as the title sponsor of the series.

==Warranty==
Most Craftsman hand tools are advertised as having an unlimited lifetime warranty. This lifetime warranty program was instituted by Sears when they began selling the Craftsman line in 1927. This warranty program requires no receipt or dated proof of purchase. If the owner takes the item into a local retail store, it may be replaced or repaired free of charge.

The full text of the warranty is as follows:

Sears has reduced the warranty in effect on many Craftsman non-powered lawn and garden products including rakes, shovels, clippers, brooms, trowels, pruners, hoses, sprinklers, hose nozzles, and other small gardening hand tools. Previously, it was a lifetime warranty—which on August 2, 2012, was reduced to 25 years with receipt required. The lifetime warranty does not include precision hand tools, such as calipers and torque wrenches.

Many consumers have also been reporting problems when attempting to obtain warranty repair or replacement on tools that are covered by the full lifetime warranty. Sears&#x27; official position is that the warranty should be honored, and much of the problem may lie with individual sales associates. In some cases, Sears no longer sells particular Craftsman tools (tape measures, and wood clamps are two examples), making it impossible to replace a tool sold with a lifetime warranty with a similar Craftsman tool that will continue the warranty.

Some Sears stores limit the number of hand tools that can be exchanged per day, in an effort to reduce the abuse of the lifetime warranty. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has stated that all previous warranties on Craftsman products will be honored after the purchase of Craftsman in 2017. Some of the newer packaging ( onward) on some Craftsman products does indicate that there may be a limit on returning warranty tools. the &quot;non-Sears&quot; Craftsman does not have &quot;open stock&quot; in the stores as Sears does to replace individual items from a set that may require warranty. Stanley Black and Decker has indicated that they are working on introducing more individual tools to stores.

Power tools have a one-year warranty.

Customers are able to exchange any version of the Sears Craftsman product at the stores that sell Sears Craftsman products such as Sears, Kmart, Ace, etc. Stores such as Lowes that sell Stanley Black &amp; Decker Craftsman products will exchange replacement items at Stanley Craftsman supplied stores if they have the item. Lowes Corp stated, &quot;We will honor all lifetime warranties no matter where the Craftsman hand tool was purchased.&quot;.

==Legal disputes==
In 1963, Sears employee Peter M. Roberts developed a quick release feature for socket wrenches. The feature allowed a person using such a ratchet to remove the socket from the wrench with one hand, freeing the second hand from grabbing the socket while the other hand held the ratchet.

Roberts developed a prototype and applied for a patent in 1964. While the patent was pending, he approached Sears and introduced the idea to them. Sears, which sold millions of sockets every year, saw the potential in the invention and asked for the prototype so it could be tested. After testing revealed the quick release would not weaken the ratchet, Sears began market testing the new ratchet and received favorable feedback. Sears then incorporated the quick release into a new line of ratchets, projecting sales of up to 750,000 units in the first year alone.

In January 1965, Roberts received a phone call from a Sears attorney asking for the name of Roberts&#x27; patent lawyer. Without Roberts&#x27;s knowledge, Sears hired the patent lawyer, Charles Fay, and Fay ended up representing both Roberts and Sears regarding the patent. Around this time, Roberts&#x27;s patent was approved, but Fay did not reveal this to Roberts. Negotiations for use of the quick release commenced, with Roberts being told that the quick release wasn&#x27;t new and that any patent issued would be limited. Sears&#x27;s lawyers also said that because of the cost (44 cents per wrench) of adding the quick release to the wrenches, a license was worth only $10,000. What Sears didn&#x27;t tell Roberts was that it planned to make 50,000 of the new wrenches per week. Roberts sued Sears in 1969 after seeing his quick release on a wrench prominently displayed in a Sears catalog, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1989 that the case was finally settled. Neither side revealed the amount of the settlement.

In August 2002, Sears sued Emerson for using Sears-owned manufacturing equipment to create power tools for Home Depot. Upon the expiration of Emerson&#x27;s 30-year contract to make Craftsman tools, Emerson was required to return the Sears-owned equipment. Instead, Emerson kept the equipment, claiming it to be obsolete and of little value. Emerson denied the allegations when the suit was filed, but paid Sears $10.8 million and returned all the equipment, while admitting no wrongdoing.

In 2004, a class action by customers accused Sears of false advertising and consumer fraud for questionable use of the slogan &quot;Made in the USA&quot; for Craftsman tools.

In 2012, Sears was sued by LoggerHead Tools, makers of the Bionic Wrench, after Sears released a competing product, the MaxAccess. Sears had sold the Bionic Wrench in its stores, but decided to not talk to LoggerHead about licensing the patent. Instead, Sears had its tool manufacturer, Apex Tools, create the MaxAccess wrench under the Craftsman name, claiming that the MaxAccess was designed not to infringe the Bionic Wrench patent. Other than coloring, the only substantial difference between the two wrenches was that the Bionic Wrench had the head at a 45-degree angle while the MaxAccess head was straight. LoggerHead was subsequently awarded $6 million in damages, but the verdict to be set aside because the judge misinterpreted the LoggerHead patent.

In April 2017, Sears sued Western Forge, its former supplier of hand tools, for abruptly ending the contract to supply the tools. Western Forge violated the contract by demanding more money because of Sears&#x27;s financial problems.

On March 6, 2019, Sears was sued by Stanley Black &amp; Decker, which accused it of breach of contract and trademark infringement over its new line of professional-grade mechanics tools under the Craftsman Ultimate Collection brand. According to the complaint, Sears breached the license agreement by launching its new tool line and touting its stores as &quot;the real home of the broadest assortment of Craftsman&quot;.

==Sponsorships==
From 1995 to 2008, Craftsman sponsored the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, a deal which began with the inception of the Truck Series. After the 2008 season, Craftsman withdrew from sponsoring the series and was replaced by Camping World. In 2016, Craftsman returned to motorsports sponsorship, serving as the title name for the World of Outlaws, renaming the Sprint Car Series and Late Model Series to the World of Outlaws Craftsman Sprint Car Series and World of Outlaws Craftsman Late Model Series, respectively.

In 2023, Stanley Black &amp; Decker acquired the title sponsorship rights to NASCAR&#x27;s Truck Series, for which it would reinstate the Craftsman branding.

==Licensee==
The main licensees for Craftsman in the UK were Focus DIY (beginning in 2001) and B&amp;Q (beginning in 1993). The main licensees for Craftsman in the rest of Europe were Bosch, and selling product at retailers and Amazon.

<doc id="1046213" wikidata="Q361976" url="?curid=1046213" title="Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre">
<text>Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (; also called Bernardin de St. Pierre) (19 January 1737, in Le Havre – 21 January 1814, in Éragny, Val-d&#x27;Oise) was a French writer and botanist. He is best known for his 1788 novel, &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot;, a very popular 18th-century classic of French literature.

==Biography==
At the age of twelve he had read &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and went with his uncle, a skipper, to the West-Indies. After returning from this trip he was educated as an engineer at the École des Ponts. Then he joined the French Army and was involved in the Seven Years&#x27; War against Prussia and England, but was dismissed for insubordination. After travels around Europe he returned to Paris in 1765.

He received a small inheritance on his father&#x27;s death, and in 1768 he traveled to Mauritius where he served as engineer and studied plants. On his return in 1771 he became friendly with and a pupil of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Together they studied the plants in and around Paris, and Rousseau helped form his character and style.

His &quot;Voyage à l&#x27;Île de France&quot; (2 vols., 1773) gained him a reputation as a champion of innocence and religion, and in consequence, through the exertions of the bishop of Aix, a pension of 1000 livres a year. The &quot;Études de la nature&quot; (3 vols., 1784) was an attempt to prove the existence of God from the wonders of nature; he set up a philosophy of sentiment to oppose the materializing tendencies of the Encyclopaedists. His masterpiece, &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot;, appeared in 1789 in a supplementary volume of the &quot;Études&quot;, and his second great success, less sentimental and showing some humour, the &quot;Chaumière indienne&quot;, not until 1790.

In 1795 he was elected to the Institut de France,in 1797 became manager of the Botanical Gardens (Jardin des plantes) in Paris and in 1803 was elected a member of the Académie française.
Saint-Pierre was an avid advocate and practitioner of vegetarianism, and although he was a devout Christian was also heavily influenced by Enlightenment-era intellectuals like Voltaire and his mentor Rousseau.

In 1792 he married a very young girl, Félicité Didot, who brought him a considerable dowry. After his first wife&#x27;s death he married in 1800, when he was sixty-three, another young girl, Desirée Pelleport.

==Legacy==
:&quot;Barye&#x27;s predators devouring their living prey indulge the emotions in a Romantic way of course, but they also embody a romantically moralizing point of view like those held by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, Mme de Staël, and Victor Hugo. The &quot;Oeuvres complètes&quot; of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre appeared in Paris in 1834 and was surely known to Barye, for the author was the former director of the zoo in the Jardin des Plantes and one of the &quot;masters of genuine poetry&quot; for the arch-romantic Mme de Staël. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre maintained that a carnivorous animal in devouring its prey alive committed a sin against the laws of its own nature.&quot;

Alexander von Humboldt, next to Charles Darwin the best known naturalist of the nineteenth century, belonged to the admirers of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and cherished the novel &quot;Paul et Virginie&quot;.

<doc id="1046225" wikidata="Q562062" url="?curid=1046225" title="Kiyoshi Shiga">
<text>was a Japanese physician and bacteriologist. He had a well-rounded education and career that led to many scientific discoveries. In 1897, Shiga was credited with the discovery and identification of the &quot;Shigella&quot; &quot;dysenteriae&quot; microorganism which causes dysentery, and the Shiga toxin which is produced by the bacteria. He conducted research on other diseases such as tuberculosis and trypanosomiasis, and made many advancements in bacteriology and immunology.

== Personal life ==
Shiga was born in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. His original surname was Satō, but he changed it to his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Shiga, after being brought up by his maternal family. Shiga was raised during Japan&#x27;s Industrial age and restoration. The changing times put financial troubles on his family. In 1900, Kiyoshi Shiga married Ichiko Shiga and in the following years had eight children. He faced many family hardships. Shiga lost his wife in 1944 to stomach cancer, his eldest son to turbulent seas during a voyage, and another son to tuberculosis.

== Career ==
Kiyoshi Shiga attended the Medical School of Tokyo Imperial University in 1896, after his high school studies. It was at the university when he was introduced to Kitasato Shibasaburō, one of Robert Koch&#x27;s successors, who was a world-famous Japanese scientist studying the bacteriology and immunology of deadly disease at the time. Shiga&#x27;s fascination with Kitasato and his work lead him to pursue a career at the Institute for the Study of Infectious Diseases directed by Kitasato Shibasaburō. While working for the institute, Shiga became famous for the discovery of &quot;Shigella dysenteriae&quot;, the organism that causes dysentery, in 1897, during a severe epidemic in which more than 90,000 cases were reported, with a mortality rate approaching 30%. The bacterium &quot;Shigella&quot; was thus named after him, as well as the Shiga toxin, which is produced by the bacterium. After the discovery of &quot;Shigella&quot;, Shiga worked with Paul Ehrlich in Germany from 1901 to 1905. When he returned to Japan, he resumed the study of infectious diseases with Kitasato. Shiga became a professor at Keio University in 1920. From 1929 to 1931, Shiga was the president of Keijō Imperial University in Keijo (Seoul) and was senior medical advisor to the Japanese Governor-General of Korea. Shiga was a recipient of the Order of Culture in 1944. He was also awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, 1st class, on his death in 1957. Along with many of his accomplishments, Shiga had written textbooks on bacteriology and immunology that were widely popular, even after his death in 1957.

== Discovery of &quot;Shigella&quot; &quot;dysenteriae&quot; ==

After graduating from the Tokyo Imperial University school of medicine, Kiyoshi Shiga began his career as an assistant to Kitasato Shibasaburō at the Institute for the Study of Infectious Diseases. While studying many infamous diseases at the time, Kitasato and his colleagues, including Shiga, turned their focus to discovering the microorganism that caused the dysentery outbreak in 1897. In 1898, Shiga was able to isolate and identify the microorganism causing the infectious disease by studying patients who had dysentery and following Koch&#x27;s Postulates. Using gram staining methods, Shiga was able to further deduce that the microorganism causing dysentery was a gram-negative bacillus. Kiyoshi Shiga initially called the bacteria &quot;Bacillus&quot; dysenteriae, but the name was later changed to &quot;Shigella&quot; &quot;dysenteriae&quot; as a tribute to Kiyoshi Shiga. The discovery of the gram-negative bacillus led to the identification of other species of bacteria with similar characteristic. These species of bacteria are classified under the Shigella genus. Species of Shigella are further separated by serogroups that represent different serotypes. Through further studies of the &quot;S. dysenteriae&quot; bacteria, Shiga was able to discover the Shiga toxin that is produced by the organism. With this new discovery, Shiga attempted to make a vaccine from the toxin. He tested his first attempt, a heat-killed &quot;S. dysenteriae&quot; strain vaccine, on himself which proved to be ineffective and caused severe complications. Kiyoshi Shiga continued his efforts and created a passive immunization vaccine that was based on horse serum. Test trials for the passive immunization vaccine showed no beneficial results or immunity to the infection. These setbacks led Shiga to stop any further trials or production of a Shiga toxin-based vaccine.

== Research ==
Shiga had done research on other topics aside from &quot;Shigella&quot; &quot;dysenteriae&quot; including tuberculosis, leprosy, and beriberi throughout his career and grew an interest in chemotherapy and immunology. After the &quot;Shigella dysenteriae&quot; discovery, Kiyoshi Shiga worked with Paul Ehrlich in Europe on discovering chemotherapy methods for a blood diseases called trypanosomiasis which was caused by a protozoan microorganism. Paul Ehrlich is known for his work with dyes and their ability to distinguish and kill certain bacteria and tissues. Ehrlich&#x27;s previous research, before working with Shiga, lead to the discovery of chemotherapy. Shiga and Ehrlich&#x27;s research into chemotherapy dyes lead them to the discovery of trypan red, a drug that was proven to have an effect on trypanosomiasis. In 1905, after the discovery of trypan red, Shiga returned to Japan with an international reputation and continued his work at Kitasato&#x27;s laboratory.

Kiyoshi Shiga also played a role in the development of the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis. In 1924, Shiga delivered a strain of tuberculosis called BCG Tokyo 172 strain from Paris, France to Japan. It was his transportation of the samples that lead scientist to culture and produce a vaccine and tuberculin to fight the disease. Shiga was a supporter of vaccines, but also an advocate for public health prevention and awareness. He participated in many Chinese writings about the education and prevention of diseases such as tuberculosis.

<doc id="1046230" wikidata="Q880495" url="?curid=1046230" title="Black River (New York)">
<text>The Black River is a blackwater river that empties into the eastern end of Lake Ontario on the shore of Jefferson County, New York in the United States. The origin of the name is not clear, but it may stem from the natural tannic acid that darkens the water in places. The river flows in a generally northwest direction, with its valley dividing the Adirondack Mountains on the east from the Tug Hill region to the west.

==Course==

The Black River originates at North Lake in the foothills of the Adirondacks, in Herkimer County, about east of Boonville. The river flows west into Oneida County then north, past Forestport and Boonville into Lewis County. At Lyons Falls, it is joined by the Moose River from the east just above the eponymous waterfall, where the river drops over a gneiss cliff.

Near Glenfield the Black River receives the smaller tributaries of Otter Creek and the Independence River, also from the east. Further north, it passes Lowville, then receives the Beaver River from the east, then the Deer River, its only major western tributary. Starting above Carthage the river briefly divides Lewis and Jefferson Counties before crossing entirely into Jefferson County, where it turns sharply west toward Lake Ontario, flowing past Great Bend, Black River and Watertown. Below Watertown it enters a canyon, well known for its challenging rapids.
The river ends at Lake Ontario in the village of Dexter, about west of Watertown, where it empties into the Black River Bay and Marsh, which are parts of the Golden Crescent. For the last few miles it forms the boundary between the Towns of Brownville and Hounsfield.

==Dams==
There are at least 17 dams on the Black River, with eight in the upper part above Lyons Falls, and nine below Watertown. The upper and lower reaches of the river have a steep gradient and were originally developed to provide mechanical power for mills, such as the old Georgia-Pacific paper mill (which now sits abandoned and falling into disrepair) in Lyons Falls, and later hydroelectricity. In contrast the middle of the river have practically no gradient and are not suitable to the development of head for industrial or hydropower projects.

The three uppermost dams, forming North Lake, Kayuta Lake and the smaller Forestport Reservoir are the only structures forming significant impoundments. The other dams are run-of-the-river, with no appreciable storage capacity, so power generation is entirely dependent on the natural flow of the river combined with releases from upstream reservoirs, which is relatively consistent except for drought years.

Abundant trout, salmon, bass, and pike are present in the stream, and salmon is the most favored.

Whitewater rafting and kayaking are popular on some stretches of the river, notably the Black River Canyon, which begins in Watertown and ends in Brownville. The Black River Canyon is one of few whitewater streams which have reliable flows throughout the summer. The &quot;Canyon&quot; itself is not actually present until you reach Brownville and ends in the Dexter Reservoir.

==Environmental issues==
A number of streams and lakes in the watershed have been impaired as a result of acid rain. Elevated levels of mercury have led to restrictions on the consumption of fish in some areas.

In August 2005, the Black River was contaminated by a spill from a manure lagoon on Marks Dairy Farm (a concentrated animal feeding operation near Lowville) when a retaining wall gave way, allowing the contents of a waste holding pond to spill. About of pollution flowed into the river. An estimated 280,000 to 375,000 fish were killed. 
As of August 3, 2006, a settlement has been reached and Marks Dairy Farm, originator of the spill, was ordered to pay $2.2 million.

<doc id="1046231" wikidata="Q1460386" url="?curid=1046231" title="Reciprocity (international relations)">
<text>In international relations and treaties, the principle of reciprocity states that favors, benefits, or penalties that are granted by one state to the citizens or legal entities of another, should be returned in kind.

For example, reciprocity has been used in the reduction of tariffs, the grant of copyrights to foreign authors, the mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments, and the relaxation of travel restrictions and visa requirements.

The principle of reciprocity also governs agreements on extradition.

==Specific and diffuse reciprocity==
Several theorists have drawn a distinction between &quot;specific reciprocity&quot; and &quot;diffuse reciprocity&quot;. While specific reciprocity is exemplified by international trade negotiations, as suggested above, diffuse reciprocity points to a wider institutionalisation of trust. Through consistent cooperation in an international society, states are seen as building generally accepted standards of behaviour. These general standards exert their own normative pressure on state action, contributing to the development of long-term obligations between states which stress cooperation. Thus in a system of diffuse reciprocity, states need not seek the immediate benefit guaranteed by specific reciprocity, but can act in the confidence that their cooperative actions will be repaid in the long run.

== Reciprocity (International Relations) ==
Reciprocity being the foundation for many bonds of trust between people can be applied in various ways and within various topics. When thinking of reciprocity in relation to international relations, it is clear to see that exchanges play a big role. An example of international relations reciprocity would be trade agreements. Trade agreements make it easier for countries to trade with one another as even big and small countries can end up trading with one another, leading to it benefitting both countries. There is also room for negotiation with the trades being made, as the small counties, usually being at the disadvantage, can now have that power over the bigger countries that can offer more. Security alliances can also be seen as an example of reciprocity within international relations as both countries are in agreement to help one another in a time of military need. NATO is one of those organizations where countries come together to come up with different policies that help the countries in it, with one of those being a type of security agreement where they will aid one another in a time of military conflict. Again, reciprocity can be used within many topics as gift giving is universal within all.

<doc id="1046232" wikidata="Q606222" url="?curid=1046232" title="Star Cruises">
<text>Star Cruises was a cruise line headquartered in Hong Kong. It operated in the Asia-Pacific market and was owned by Genting Hong Kong. It was the 18th largest cruise line in the world after Carnival Corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and 15 others.

The chairman of Star Cruises was Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay, the son of Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong, who had founded Malaysia&#x27;s Genting Highlands.

==History==
=== 1992–1999: Founding, acquisitions ===
Star Cruises was founded as an associate of the Genting Group of Malaysia. It was incorporated in Bermuda on 10 November 1993 with its corporate headquarters in Hong Kong. The company&#x27;s first ships were two cruiseferries acquired from the bankrupt Swedish company Rederi AB Slite. In the following years, the company purchased several other ships.

In 1998, Star Cruises took delivery of its first new build, &quot;SuperStar Leo&quot;, followed by sister ship &quot;SuperStar Virgo&quot; in 1999. Star Cruises also acquired Sun Cruises the same year.

=== 2000–2012: Norwegian Cruise Line, transfers ===
In 2000, Star Cruises acquired Norwegian Cruise Line (NCL), including its subsidiaries Orient Lines and Norwegian Capricorn Line, thus becoming the largest global cruise line in the world. NCL operations were soon merged into those of Star Cruises. Before the purchase of NCL, Star Cruises had had several other new builds either planned or already under construction, but with the merger of the two companies, most of the new ships joined the NCL fleet instead.

In 2001, Star Cruises founded a new sister company, Cruise Ferries, which began operating its sole ship, &quot;Wasa Queen&quot;, on short cruises from Hong Kong to Xiamen, followed by overnight gambling cruises from Hong Kong and gambling cruises from Port Klang in Kuala Lumpur. (&quot;Wasa Queen&quot; was sold in 2007.)

In 2004, &quot;SuperStar Leo&quot; was transferred to NCL. The ship then became &quot;Norwegian Spirit&quot;. It was rushed into service under the NCL America brand because the &quot;Pride of America&quot; wasn&#x27;t ready on time due to sinking at Lloyd Werft shipyard. (Since 2006, the trend was for new ships to be built for NCL, after which old ships in the NCL fleet were transferred to the Star Cruises fleet in Asia.)

In 2007, Star sold 50% of NCL to the Apollo Management group. In 2013, following a corporate reorganization and an initial public offering, NCL was made a wholly owned subsidiary of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. On 3 December 2018, Star and Apollo sold off their remaining stakes in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, marking the end of a relationship that had lasted more than a decade.

In early 2008, both NCL America and Orient Lines brands were discontinued, with the latter&#x27;s sole ship, &quot;Marco Polo&quot;, sold to Greek interests. Also in that year, the first ship from NCL was transferred to the Star Cruises fleet as &quot;SuperStar Libra&quot;.

Starting from 2011, Star Cruises&#x27; ships received new hull art. One year later, it was announced on 27 April 2012 that the &quot;Norwegian Dream&quot; would join the Star fleet, renamed as &quot;SuperStar Gemini&quot;, with service starting in 2012.

=== 2013–2018: New and renamed vessels ===
On 7 October 2013, Star Cruises announced they had entered into an agreement with Meyer Werft shipyard for the construction of one new cruise ship. The vessel would have capacity for 3,364 passengers at double occupancy. The ship would be delivered sometime in late 2016. Star Cruises then announced on 10 February 2014 that a second ship was ordered and would be delivered by late 2017. Both ships would have volumes of 150,000 GT.

On 9 February 2015, the first steel cutting ceremony for &quot;Genting World&quot; was held at Meyer Werft shipyard. In November 2015, it was announced that the vessels under construction would instead be delivered to Dream Cruises, with a new class of ships planned to be designed for Star Cruises.

In March 2018, Star Cruises announced that one of its ships, &quot;SuperStar Libra&quot;, would end her public cruise operations for the company on 27 June 2018. On 8 March 2018, Genting Hong Kong announced that the first global-class build previously allocated to Star Cruises would join the Dream Cruises fleet instead. On 11 September 2018, Genting Hong Kong also announced that &quot;SuperStar Virgo&quot; would move to Dream Cruises in April 2019 and be renamed the &quot;Explorer Dream&quot;. In November 2018, &quot;SuperStar Gemini&quot; returned to Malaysia for a six-month deployment.

=== 2022: Bankruptcy ===
In January 2022, the parent company of Star Cruises, Genting Hong Kong, declared bankruptcy due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April, &quot;SuperStar Gemini&quot;, &quot;SuperStar Aquarius&quot;, and &quot;Star Pisces&quot; were all sold for scrap. Their smaller sister ship, &quot;The Taipan&quot;, was sold to OM Ships International in May 2022 and renamed &quot;Doulos Hope&quot;. Operation Mobilisation (OM) affiliate Gute Bücher für Alle accepted the ship in Penang, Malaysia on 25 May and completed her sea trial on July 20. She then sailed to Singapore to continue a refurbishment which should have conclude by the end of 2023.

In September of 2022, Thay, under the buyer name Resorts World, bought the trademarks for Star Cruises for around $3.5 million.

===2025: Revival as StarCruises===
On 25 February 2025, &quot;Resorts World Cruises&quot; announced that the brand would split its operations, reforming Dream Cruises and Star Cruises as &quot;StarCruises&quot;. Genting Dream is set to rejoin Dream Cruises. While &quot;Resorts World One&quot; will be rebranded into &quot;Star Navigator&quot; and will sail along side the &quot;Star Voyager&quot;.

<text>Carlos Justiniano Ribeiro Chagas, or Carlos Chagas (; July 9, 1879 – November 8, 1934), was a Brazilian sanitary physician, scientist, and microbiologist who worked as a clinician and researcher. Most well known for the discovery of an eponymous protozoal infection called Chagas disease, also called American trypanosomiasis, he also discovered the causative fungi of the &quot;pneumocystis&quot; pneumonia. He described the two pathogens in 1909, while he was working at the Oswaldo Cruz Institute in Rio de Janeiro, and named the former &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; to honour his friend Oswaldo Cruz.

Chagas&#x27;s work holds a unique place in the history of medicine. Working in primitive conditions, Chagas described in detail a previously-unknown infectious disease, its pathogen, vector (Triatominae), host, clinical manifestations, and epidemiology. Chagas was also the first to discover and illustrate the parasitic fungal genus &quot;Pneumocystis&quot;, which later became infamous for being linked to pneumocystis pneumonia in AIDS patients.

==Early life and education==

Chagas was the son of José Justiniano das Chagas, a coffee farmer at Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, and Mariana Cândida Chagas (née Ribeiro de Castro), both of Portuguese descent. His birth place is also recorded as Oliveira, his mother&#x27;s hometown, where the family spent half of their times. He was the eldest of four children, and his father died when he was four years old. At age seven, his mother enrolled him to Jesuit boarding school in São Paulo. In 1888, a political turmoil erupted as Emperor Dom Pedro II declared abolition of slavery. Chagas was compelled to left the school. His mother then transferred him to a nearer Catholic school called San Antonio, where he completed up to his secondary studies. 

Chagas entered the School of Mining Engineering at Ouro Preto, but suffered from beri-beri in 1895 that incapacitated him to continue. While recovering in Oliveira, his uncle Carlos Ribeiro de Castro, an established physician, persuaded him to take up medicine. In 1896, he joined the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro (now the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro). For his dissertation, his mentor, Francisco Fajardo, suggested that he work on malaria, as the process of its transmission had been discovered by a British medical officer Ronald Ross in India in 1898.

For the dissertation research, Fajardo, introduced Chagas to Oswaldo Cruz (1872–1917) founder of the Manguinhos Institute (which was later renamed after Cruz) who would be most suitable to guide him. This led to a lasting friendship between Chagas and Cruz, and Chagas&#x27;s lifelong association with Cruz&#x27;s institute. He graduated in 1902 with a dissertation on malaria and earned his doctorate the following year with a thesis on &quot;Estudos&quot; &quot;Hematológicos do Impaludismo&quot; (&quot;Hematological Studies on Malaria&quot;).

== Early career ==
After a brief stint as a medical practitioner in the hinterlands, Chagas accepted a position in anti-malarial campaigns. In 1905, he worked under the Docas de Santos company in the port authority of Santos, São Paulo, with the mission of fighting the malaria epidemic, which was affecting its workers. With successful malaria prevention, the company was able to complete construction on the port. There, he introduced an innovation, which consisted in using pyrethrum, an insecticide, to treat households, with surprising success. His published work on this method served as the basis of prevention of malaria all over the world, and was adopted by a service of the Ministry of Health in Brazil, which was established expressly for this purpose.

In 1906, Chagas returned to Rio de Janeiro and joined the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, where he worked for the rest of his life. In 1907, there was an outbreak of malaria at the Minas Gerais hinterland, largely affecting railroad workers and greatly hampered the construction on new railway from Rio de Janeiro to the city of Belém in the Amazon. The Brazilian government asked Cruz for help. Cruz immediately assigned Chagas, with an assistant, Belisario Penna, to make the investigation. Camping at Lassance, a small town near the São Francisco River, Chagas stayed there for two years and was able to contain the infection after a year of work. 

==Major discoveries ==

=== Chagas disease ===

During his investigation of malaria in Lassance, Chagas observed the peculiar infestation of the rural houses with a large hematophagous insect of the genus &quot;Triatoma&quot;, a kind of &quot;assassin bug&quot; or &quot;kissing bug&quot; (&quot;barbeiro,&quot; &quot;barber&quot; in Portuguese, so-called because it sucked the blood at night by biting the faces of its victims). In his &quot;Historic Restrospect&quot;, Chagas described:On a journey to Pirapora and while spending the night in an engineers&#x27; camp Dr. Belisario Penna and I first made the acquaintance of the &quot;barbeiro&quot;, shown to us by Dr. Cantarino Motta, chief of the engineering committee. Once we heard of the blood-sucking habits of this insect and of its proliferation in human dwelling-places, we became very interested in knowing its exact biology and above all in ascertaining if by any chance it were, as I immediately supposed, a transmitter of any parasite of man or of another vertebrate.He discovered that the intestines of these insects harbored flagellate protozoans, a new species of the genus &quot;Trypanosoma&quot;, and was able to prove experimentally that it could be transmitted to marmoset monkeys that were bitten by the infected bug. Chagas named this new parasite &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; in honor of Oswaldo Cruz and later that year as &quot;Schizotrypanum cruzi,&quot; and then once again as &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;.

Chagas&#x27;s initial suspicion that the parasite could infect human and other vertebrates was proven right: he soon found the parasites in the blood of a cat. He then looked for a girl, later identified as Berenice Soares de Moura, a two-year-old girl whom he had seen in the same hut where that cat had been a few weeks before. He took Berenice&#x27;s blood samples on 14 April 1909, discovering for the first time the same &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; parasite in the human blood. He also observed parasitic inclusions in the brain and myocardium, which would explain some of the clinical manifestations in diseased people, and closed the proposed lifecycle of the parasite by suggesting that the armadillo could be its natural reservoir. To complete his work on the pathology of the new disease, Chagas described 27 cases of the acute form of the disease and performed more than 100 autopsies on patients who exhibited the chronic form.

Chagas&#x27;s description of the new disease was to become a classic in medicine, and brought him domestic and international distinction. He also persuaded Argentine physician Salvador Mazza to research the epidemic, leading to the latter&#x27;s confirmation of the existence of &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; in Argentina in 1927, and eventually to government action.

==== Chagas heart disease ====
Upon discovering &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; as the parasite of humans, Chagas additionally discovered that the parasite was responsible for a deadly heart disease now known as Chagas heart disease or Chagas cardiomyopathy. In 1909, he reported in the Brazilian medical journal, &quot;Brazil Médico&quot;, a case of human trypanosomiasis and noted the association with severe heart disease. In 1910, he further noticed that the parasitic infection could be classified into at least three different conditions, chronic heart disease, brain disorder, and thyroid problem, especially of goiter. He made an autopsy report of an individual with heart failure whom he found to have heavy trypanosome infection that was associated with blood cell accumulation (interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration) in the heart.

=== &quot;Trypanosoma minasense&quot; and &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; ===
Chagas was also the first to discover the parasitic fungal genus &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; in the lungs of his experimentally trypanosome-infected guinea pigs. In 1908, he reported in &quot;Brazil Médico&quot; the blood sample of marmosets had protozoan parasites that he named &quot;Trypanosoma minasense&quot;. He also described in it that the parasite was associated with another protozoan but which he could not identify. At the time, he did not recognize it as a separate organism from the protozoan he had identified, but believed it as part of the life cycle stage of the protozoan. Therefore, he described both the fungi and the protozoan as &quot;Schizotrypanum&quot; &quot;cruzi&quot;. 

In 1912, French couple at the Pasteur Institute, Pierre Delanoë and Marie Delanoë identified and described the other parasite they found in rats. They knew that the parasite was not related to the trypanosomes and created a new genus &quot;Pneumocystis&quot;. The original name of the species &quot;Pneumocystis carinii&quot; was later changed to &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot; when it was established that the parasite is a fungus that causes human infection. Chagas followed the literature closely and quickly confirmed the distinction, whereupon he again adopted the name &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot; for the protozoan. The original &quot;Pneumocystis&quot; species discovered by Chagas in guinea pigs has not yet been named as a separate species.

== Personal life ==
Chagas was a studious student. At the medical school, he was nicknamed &quot;two-candle student&quot; as he would use up two candles every evening for reading as there was no electricity in Rio de Janeiro at the time. It was during his medical course that his teacher, Miguel Couto, introduced him to a relative, Fernando Lobo. He eventually married Lobo&#x27;s daughter, Iris.

One of his sons, Carlos Chagas Filho (1910–2000), became an eminent and internationally recognized scientist in the field of neurophysiology and president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Another son, Evandro Chagas (1905–1940), was also a physician and researcher in tropical medicine, who died in a plane crash at 35 years of age. His name is honoured by the important biomedical institution Instituto Evandro Chagas, in Belém, state of Pará.

==Later life and death==

After the death of his mentor in 1917, Chagas accepted Cruz&#x27;s directorship of the institute, a post he held until his own death in 1934. From 1920 to 1924, he became the director of the Department of Health in Brazil, the set up of which he initiated. Chagas was very active in organizing special health-care and prevention services and campaigns for the Spanish flu epidemics, sexually transmitted diseases, leprosy, pediatrics, tuberculosis, and rural endemic diseases. He created a nursing school and was the founder of the concept of sanitary medicine, the first chairman of tropical medicine and the graduate study of hygiene.

Chagas died in Rio de Janeiro from a heart attack in 1934 at 55 years of age.

== Awards and honours ==
Chagas was elected to the National Academy of Medicine and received the prestigious Schaudinn Prize for the best work in protozoology and tropical medicine, on June 22, 1912. The contenders included Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915), Emile Roux (1853–1933), Ilya Mechnikov (1845–1916), Charles Laveran (1845–1922), Charles Nicolle (1866–1936), and Sir William Boog Leishman (1865–1926), several of whom had already received or would receive the Nobel Prize for Medicine. Chagas was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, in 1913 and 1921, but never received any.

In 1922, Chagas became member of the Health Committee of the League of Nations.

Since 2020, The World Chagas Disease Day is observed by the World Health Organization every year on 14 April, commemorating the day Chagas discovered &quot;T. cruzi&quot; from Berenice.

== Nobel Prize controversy ==

Chagas&#x27; discovery was recognized at home and abroad as one of the most important achievements in parasitology. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize each time by only a single Brazilian nominator. In 1913, 63 scientists were nominated for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, the top two nominees having received nine and eight nominations, respectively. In 1921, 42 scientists were nominated for the award, the top four nominees having received 11, nine, seven, and seven nominations, respectively. A hundred years after the discovery of the disease, speculation still remains regarding the two official nominations of Carlos Chagas for the Nobel Prize. 

The reason why the prize was not awarded to Chagas may have been the strong opposition that he faced in Brazil, from some physicians and researchers of that time. They went as far as questioning the existence of Chagas disease, thereby possibly influencing the decision of the Nobel Committee not to award the prize to him. Analysis of the database of the Nobel Prize archives, with the revelation of the names of nominators, nominees, and prizewinners from 1901 to 1951, brought information not only about what was considered to be a scientific achievement at that time, but also about who the important scientists were and the relationships between them. The connections of the members of the Nobel Committee with the international scientific community, almost exclusively centered in European and North American scientists, also influenced their choices. The nonrecognition of Carlos Chagas&#x27; discoveries by the Nobel Committee appears to be more correctly explained by these factors than by the negative impact of the local opposition.

<text>Han Xin (; ? – early 196 BCE) was a Chinese military general and politician who served Liu Bang during the Chu–Han Contention and contributed greatly to the founding of the Han dynasty. Han Xin was named as one of the &quot;Three Heroes of the early Han dynasty&quot; (), along with Zhang Liang and Xiao He.

Han Xin is best remembered as a brilliant military leader for the strategies and tactics he employed in warfare, some of which became the origins of certain Chinese idioms, he was undefeated in battle and for his accomplishments he was considered the &quot;God of War&quot;. In recognition of Han Xin&#x27;s contributions, Liu Bang conferred the titles of &quot;King of Qi&quot; on him in 203 BCE and &quot;King of Chu&quot; in the following year. However, Liu Bang feared Han Xin&#x27;s growing influence and gradually reduced his authority, demoting him to &quot;Marquis of Huaiyin&quot; in late 202 BCE. In early 196 BCE, Han Xin was accused of participating in a rebellion, lured into a trap and executed on Empress Lü Zhi&#x27;s orders.
==Early life==

Han Xin was born in Huaiyin (modern-day Jiangsu Province), which was an area of Chu during the warring states. According to legend, he may have been a descendant of the Han Sect of the Han Kingdom, but he was incredibly poor. The people from his hometown say that when his mother died, he did not have enough money to give her a proper burial. Regardless, he still searched until he came across a high and raised plot of land, thinking that one day, he could settle ten thousand households here to live and guard over his mother&#x27;s grave.

Because he was unable to obtain a government post nor become a merchant, he lived a life of destitution and was despised by those around him, as he often relied on others for his meals. He especially often went to the 亭長 (Chief) of Nanchang Pavilion for food, and as months passed the Chief&#x27;s wife increasing began to hate Han Xin. At one point, she cooked and ate very early in the morning, so that when Han Xin arrived, there was no more food. Han Xin understood that he was no longer welcome and never visited them again.

Once, when he was suffering from hunger, he met an old woman washing clothes by the river who provided him food. She did so for all the dozen days that she had laundry to do. Han Xin was incredibly delighted and promised to heavily repay her for her kindness. She, however, scolded him, saying: &quot;A young man such as you cannot feed himself. I take pity that you are a descendant of nobility and so I feed you. I did not do so expecting anything in return!&quot;

A youngster from a butcher&#x27;s family in Huaiyin would humiliate Han Xin, making fun of him by saying that despite Han Xin being tall and carrying around a sword, Han Xin was actually a coward. He said in front of a crowd: &quot;If you do not fear death; stab me. If you fear death; come crawl between my legs.&quot; Han Xin gave it some thought, and eventually decided to crawl between the hooligan&#x27;s legs. Because of this, he was mocked by all the town for his cowardice.

Several years later, after becoming the King of Chu, Han Xin returned to his hometown. He found the woman who fed him and rewarded her with 1,000 taels of gold. He found the Chief of Nanchang Pavilion and gave him a hundred coins, saying, &quot;You are not a good person. You do good things but your generosity is limited.&quot; Han Xin also found the hooligan and appointed the hooligan as a &quot;zhongwei&quot; (中尉; equivalent to a present-day lieutenant). He to his subordinates: &quot;This man is a hero. Do you think I could not have killed him when he humiliated me? I would not become famous even if I killed him then. Hence, I endured the humiliation to preserve my life to achieve great things in the future.&quot;

==Service Under Xiang Yu==

In 209 BC, Han Xin joined Xiang Liang&#x27;s rebel army when rebellions erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Han Xin continued serving Xiang Yu (Xiang Liang&#x27;s nephew) after Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao. He was not placed in high regard and worked as a &quot;langzhong&quot; (郎中; sometimes translated as Captain of the Palace Guards). He constantly proposed strategies to Xiang Yu but was ignored. During this time, he became well acquainted with Zhongli Mo, one of Xiang Yu&#x27;s top generals.

In 206 BC, Han Xin deserted Xiang Yu&#x27;s army and went to join Liu Bang.

==Service under Liu Bang during the Chu–Han Contention==
Initially, after joining Liu Bang&#x27;s army, Han Xin was not given any important roles. Once, he violated military law and was due to be punished by execution. When it was his turn to be beheaded, Han Xin saw Xiahou Ying (one of Liu Bang&#x27;s trusted generals) and said, &quot;I thought the King wanted to rule an empire. Why, then, is he killing valiant men?&quot; Xiahou Ying was surprised by his words and his looks, and spared Han Xin&#x27;s life. After conversing with Han Xin, Xiahou Ying was greatly delighted and recommended Han Xin to Liu Bang. Liu Bang was not overly impressed but made Han Xin the Captain of Rations (治粟都尉) to be in charge of food supplies. During this time, Han Xin often met up with Xiao He (Liu Bang&#x27;s Chancellor), who was greatly impressed by him.

In April of that year, Liu Bang faced a mass desertion of soldiers. Han Xin figured that despite both Xiahou Ying and Xiao He having recommended him to Liu Bang, Liu Bang did not use him, so he saw no reason to stay and also deserted. When Xiao He heard that Han Xin had left, he immediately rushed to personally find Han Xin and bring him back, and did not manage to inform Liu Bang in time. Xiao He eventually caught up with Han Xin and managed to persuade Han Xin to go back with him. This event gave rise to the saying, &quot;Xiao He chases Han Xin under the moonlight&quot; (). In the meantime, Liu Bang had a nervous breakdown after hearing that Xiao He had left him. When Xiao He returned after a few days, while Liu Bang was relieved, he was also furious. He angrily asked Xiao He, &quot;Why did you run away?&quot; Xiao He explained, &quot;I did not run away; I was chasing down Han Xin.&quot; Liu Bang got angry again, saying, &quot;There were dozens of deserters, yet you did not chase after them. When you say that you chased after Han Xin, you must be lying to me.&quot; Xiao He then explained Han Xin&#x27;s talent and forcibly insisted that Liu Bang immediately promote Han Xin to the highest rank in the army, the Commander-in-Chief (大將軍). Xiao He also chided Liu Bang&#x27;s usual ill-mannered behaviour, demanding that Liu Bang hold a formal ceremony for the event. Liu Bang relented and held a special ceremony for Han Xin&#x27;s appointment.

===Conquering the Three Qins===
After the ceremony, Han Xin analysed the situation for Liu Bang and devised a plan to conquer Xiang Yu&#x27;s Western Chu kingdom. In late 206 BCE, Liu Bang&#x27;s forces left Hanzhong and prepared to attack the Three Qins in Guanzhong. Han Xin ordered some soldiers to pretend to repair the gallery roads linking Guanzhong and Hanzhong, while sending another army to secretly pass through Chencang and make a surprise attack on Zhang Han. Zhang Han was caught off guard and the Han forces emerged victorious, proceeding to take over Sima Xin and Dong Yi&#x27;s kingdoms. The strategy employed by Han Xin, known as &quot;mingxiu zhandao, andu Chencang&quot; (明修棧道, 暗度陳倉; lit. &quot;appearing to repair the gallery roads while making secret advances through Chencang&quot;), became one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems.

==Service during the Western Han dynasty==
===Demotion===
When Xiang Yu died in 202 BCE, Zhongli Mo (one of Xiang Yu&#x27;s generals) came to Han Xin and requested refuge. On account of their past friendship, Han Xin protected Zhongli Mo and let him stay with him. When Emperor Gaozu heard that Zhongli Mo was hiding in Han Xin&#x27;s territory, he ordered Han to arrest Zhongli Mo, but Han Xin refused.

A year later, Gaozu heard rumours that Han Xin was plotting a rebellion. By this time, Zhang Liang had already retreated from political affairs, so Chen Ping was Gaozu&#x27;s most trusted advisor. After discussion, they came to the conclusion that Gaozu could not best Han Xin in battle, so it would be most ideal to strike Han Xin when he was unprepared. Chen Ping proposed to lure Han Xin into meeting, on a pretext of Liu Bang touring the Yunmeng Marshes (present-day Jianghan Plains, Hubei Province). He sent this message out to all warlords across the land. When Han Xin heard that Gaozu was heading towards the land of Chu, his first instinct was to rebel, but he decided he had committed no crime and stayed put. At this time, someone told Han Xin that if he were to present Zhongli Mo&#x27;s head to Gaozu, than he would be happy and spare him. Han Xin then met Zhongli Mo to decide their next course of action, and brought up this idea. Zhongli Mo then promptly slit his own throat, but not before claiming Han Xin would follow soon after. Han Xin brought Zhongli Mo&#x27;s severed head to Gaozu and explained his innocence, but Gaozu ordered Han to be arrested. Han Xin exclaimed, &quot;It is true when people say: The hunting dog becomes food as well after it is used to hunt game; a good bow is discarded when there are no birds left for shooting; an advisor dies after he helps his lord conquer a rival kingdom. Now that the empire is in place, I no longer serve any purpose!&quot; Liu Bang&#x27;s only response was: &quot;Someone claimed you had rebelled&quot;, and proceeded to cuff Han Xin and bring him back to Luoyang. Although Gaozu pardoned Han Xin and released him later, he still demoted Han from &quot;King of Chu&quot; to &quot;Marquis of Huaiyin&quot;.

===Downfall and Dispute over death===
After his demotion, Han Xin knew that Gaozu was beginning to distrust him and had become wary of his talent. Hence, Han Xin claimed to be ill and stayed at home most of the time to reduce Gaozu&#x27;s suspicions. Around 197 BCE, Chen Xi (Marquis of Yangxia) met Han Xin before leaving for Julu, where Han Xin promptly pulled him aside, dismissing all nearby servants. He promised to aid Chen Xi from inside the capital if Chen Xi were to start an uprising against the Han dynasty. Not long after, Chen Xi rebelled and Gaozu personally led an army to suppress the rebellion, while Han Xin claimed sickness and stayed behind.

While Gaozu was away, one of Han Xin&#x27;s household servants offended him, so Han Xin locked him up as punishment. The servant&#x27;s young brother gave news of Han Xin&#x27;s desire to rebel to Empress Lü Zhi, who then plotted with Xiao He to lure Han Xin into a trap. They pretended Gaozu had returned from suppressing the rebellion and that there would be a feast to commemorate the success. Xiao He managed to persuade Han Xin into coming to Changle Palace, where the Empress lived, and he was bound and executed as soon as he stepped through the doors. Han Xin&#x27;s clan was exterminated on the Empress&#x27;s orders as well. Upon return from his campaign, Gaozu expressed both relief and regret when he learnt of Han Xin&#x27;s death. He asked the Empress for Han Xin&#x27;s last words, which were, &quot;I regret not listening to Kuai Che&#x27;s advice, and now I have been deceived by such vile people. This is the heaven&#x27;s will!&quot;

In another section of Sima Qian&#x27;s Records of the Grand Historian, The Hereditary House of Chancellor Xiao, the events of the Chu-Han Contention are told from Xiao He&#x27;s point of view, and puts a different narrative on the death of Han Xin. In this autobiography, Liu Bang was immediately notified of Han Xin&#x27;s rebellion and execution, rather than waiting until after his return.

Throughout history, historians and scholars alike have debated over the plausibility of Han Xin&#x27;s rebellion. Although the Records of the Grand Historian have it written in black and white, many believe that Han Xin was loyal until his death. They believe that Lü Zhi and Xiao He framed Han Xin of treason, under the knowledge of Liu Bang, because Han Xin&#x27;s reputation amongst the military was too high, and combined with his talents, became a threat to the throne. Although historians have always looked to Sima Qian&#x27;s records for facts, some believe it is possible that as a citizen of the Han dynasty, he could not go against the government acknowledged version of events. A Tang dynasty poet, Xu Hun, once wrote a poem titled &quot;The Shrine of Han Xin&quot;, in which it states that it is unlikely for Han Xin to stay loyal when he held military power, yet rebel when he had not a single soldier.

==Legacy==
Some Chinese idioms and sayings originating from the events in Han Xin&#x27;s life are listed as follows:
* &quot;Shame of crawling through between someone&#x27;s legs&quot; (): Used to describe a humiliating incident. This idiom originated from the incident when Han Xin was bullied by a hooligan.
* &quot;When Han Xin selects his troops, the more the better&quot; (): Originated from a conversation between Han Xin and Liu Bang. Liu asked Han, &quot;How many men do you think I can command?&quot;, to which Han Xin replied, &quot;A maximum of 100,000.&quot; Liu Bang asked, &quot;What about you?&quot;, and Han Xin replied, &quot;The more the better.&quot; Liu Bang said, &quot;So that means I cannot defeat you?&quot; Han Xin explained, &quot;No, my lord, you command generals while I command soldiers.&quot;
* &quot;Both success and failure are due to Xiao He&quot; (): An idiom describing a common source for a person&#x27;s success and demise. It alludes to the critical role that Xiao He played in recognising Han Xin&#x27;s talent as a general, which enabled Han to put his talent to good use, but also Xiao He&#x27;s collusion with Empress Lu resulting in Han Xin&#x27;s death. 
* &quot;Success and failure stem from Xiao He, life and death are due to two women&quot; (): Refers to Xiao He&#x27;s effect on Han Xin&#x27;s life. The &quot;two women&quot; refers to the old woman who provided Han with food before he found success and Empress Lü Zhi who was responsible for his death.

While Han Xin was under house arrest, he did a mass organization of military books together with Zhang Liang. They put together one hundred and eighty-two books, removed certain parts and chose the reliable bits, and came out with thirty-five books. Han Xin himself also wrote three essays regarding military strategy.

His descendants are said to have fled to the area of modern Guangdong and Guangxi and changed their name to Wéi (韋).

==Evaluation==
At the end of Han Xin&#x27;s biography in &quot;Shiji&quot;, Sima Qian commented on Han as follows:

In volume 12 of &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, after the entry on Han Xin&#x27;s death, Sima Guang commented on Han as follows:

==Han Xin counting troops==
:Main article: Chinese remainder theorem

According to common folklore, one of the archetypal forms of the Chinese remainder theorem was applied by Han Xin during the war with Chu with the common name &quot;Han Xin counting soldiers&quot; (韓信點兵 hang xin dian bing). The narration alleged Han Xin to organized his troops into groups of 3, 5, 7 soldiers and observed the remainders as 2, 3, 2 respectively. After fitting the observation into the estimation of his original troop strength and casualties, he managed to calculated the number of his remaining troops as 1073 people, still more numerous than the contemporary Chu forces in the battle. The correct estimation of troop strength allowed Han Xin to won the battle.

<doc id="1046240" wikidata="Q7302481" url="?curid=1046240" title="Reciprocity (Canadian politics)">
<text>Reciprocity, in 19th- and early 20th-century Canadian politics, meant free trade, the removal of protective tariffs on all natural resources between Canada and the United States. Reciprocity and free trade have been emotional issues in Canadian history, as they pitted two conflicting impulses: the desire for beneficial economic ties with the United States and the fear of closer economic ties leading to American domination and even annexation.

==1880s to 1910s==

After Confederation, reciprocity was initially promoted as an alternative to Prime Minister John A. Macdonald&#x27;s National Policy. Reciprocity meant that there would be no protective tariffs on all natural resources being imported and exported between Canada and the United States. That would allow prairie grain farmers to both have access to the larger American market and make more money on their exports.

In the 1890s, it also meant that Western Canadian farmers could obtain access to cheaper American farm machinery and manufactured goods, which otherwise had to be obtained at higher prices from Central Canada.

In the 1891 election, the Liberal Party of Canada ran on a reciprocity platform. It lost to Macdonald who won with his nationalist slogan, &quot;The Old Flag, The Old Policy, The Old Leader.&quot; The Liberals temporarily shelved the concept.

When reciprocity came up again, in 1896, it was the Americans who proposed it to Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s Liberals. The idea still excited them, and they immediately began to campaign for it. Despite their general belief it would benefit Canada, the Conservatives campaigned against it.

The Liberals went on to win the 1896 election and negotiated an elaborate reciprocity agreement with the United States in 1911. However, in the 1911 election reciprocity again became a major issue, with the Conservatives saying that it would be a &quot;sellout&quot; to the United States. The Liberals were defeated by the Conservatives. Their slogan was &quot;No truck or trade with the Yankees.&quot;

==1980s==
The concept of reciprocity with the United States was revived in the 1985 when the Royal Commission on the Economic Union and Development Prospects for Canada headed by former Liberal Minister of Finance Donald S. Macdonald issued a report, calling for free trade with the US. The Progressive Conservatives, under Brian Mulroney, acted on the recommendation by negotiating the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement. They won the 1988 election on the issue.
