<text>Emperor Gaozu of Tang (7 April 566 – 25 June 635), born Li Yuan, courtesy name Shude, was the founding emperor of the Tang dynasty of China, reigning from 618 to 626 CE. Under the Sui dynasty, Li Yuan was the governor in the area of modern-day Shanxi, and was based in Taiyuan.

In 615, Li Yuan was assigned to garrison Longxi. He gained much experience by dealing with the Göktürks of the north and was able to pacify them. Li Yuan was also able to gather support from these successes and, with the disintegration of the Sui dynasty in July 617, Li Yuan – urged on by his second son Li Shimin (, the eventual Emperor Taizong) – rose in rebellion. Using the title of &quot;Great Chancellor&quot; (), Li Yuan installed a puppet child emperor, Yang You, but eventually removed him altogether and established the Tang dynasty in 618 with himself as emperor. His son and successor Li Shimin honoured him as Gaozu (&quot;high founder&quot;) after his death.

Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s reign was concentrated on uniting the empire under the Tang. Aided by Li Shimin, whom he created the Prince of Qin, he defeated all the other contenders, including Li Gui, Dou Jiande, Wang Shichong, Xue Rengao and Liu Wuzhou. By 628, the Tang dynasty had succeeded in uniting all of China. On the home front, he recognized the early successes forged by Emperor Wen of Sui and strove to emulate most of Emperor Wen&#x27;s policies, including the equal distribution of land amongst his people, and he also lowered taxes. He abandoned the harsh system of law established by Emperor Yang of Sui as well as reforming the judicial system. These acts of reform paved the way for the reign of Emperor Taizong, which ultimately pushed Tang to the height of its power.

In 626, Li Shimin, in a dispute with his brothers Li Jiancheng, the Crown Prince, and Li Yuanji, the Prince of Qi, ambushed Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji at Xuanwu Gate, killing them. Fearful of what Li Shimin might do next, Emperor Gaozu passed the throne to him and became &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (retired emperor). He died on 25 June 635.

==Early life and career==
According to the official genealogy of the Tang ruling house, Li Yuan&#x27;s seventh-generation ancestor was Li Gao, the Han Chinese founder of the Dunhuang-based Sixteen Kingdoms state of Western Liang. After Western Liang&#x27;s destruction by the Northern Liang, Li Gao&#x27;s grandson Li Zhong&#x27;Er () served as a Northern Wei official, but for several generations after that, Li Yuan&#x27;s ancestors had only minor military titles. Li Yuan&#x27;s paternal grandfather Li Hu () served as a major general under Western Wei&#x27;s paramount general Yuwen Tai, and was created the Duke of Longxi and given the Xianbei surname Daye (). Li Hu died before Yuwen Tai&#x27;s son Emperor Xiaomin of Northern Zhou founded Northern Zhou, but was posthumously created the Duke of Tang after Northern Zhou&#x27;s founding. His son and Li Yuan&#x27;s father Li Bing (), of Han ethnicity, inherited the title of the Duke of Tang and married one of the Dugu sisters and daughter of the prominent Xianbei general Dugu Xin. Li Bing died in 572, and Li Yuan inherited the title of Duke of Tang, a title he continued to hold after the Northern Zhou throne was seized by Emperor Wen of Sui (Yang Jian) in 581, establishing the Sui dynasty, as Emperor Wen&#x27;s wife, Empress Dugu, was an aunt of his. 

At some point, he married Lady Dou, a daughter of Dou Yi () the Duke of Shenwu and Northern Zhou&#x27;s Princess Xiangyang (Yuwen Tai&#x27;s daughter) as his wife and duchess.

During Emperor Wen&#x27;s reign (581–604), Li Yuan served three terms as a provincial governor. Early in the reign of Emperor Wen&#x27;s son Emperor Yang, Li Yuan served as commandery governor (as Emperor Yang converted provinces into commanderies), but was later recalled to serve as a junior minister within Emperor Yang&#x27;s administration. When Emperor Yang carried out his second campaign against Goguryeo in 613, Li Yuan was in charge of part of the logistics operation. When the general Yang Xuangan rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang, Emperor Yang commissioned Li Yuan as a general and made him be in charge of the operations west of the Tong Pass, although Yang Xuangan&#x27;s rebellion eventually did not involve that region. Li Yuan took the opportunity to recruit talented people to his staff. Later that year, when Emperor Yang summoned him to his presence, he declined, citing ill health—an excuse that Emperor Yang did not believe, as he questioned Li Yuan&#x27;s niece, Consort Wang (Emperor Yang&#x27;s concubine), &quot;Will he die?&quot;. In fear, Li Yuan took up drinking and receiving bribes to try to show Emperor Yang that he did not have great ambitions. In 615, Emperor Yang placed him in charge of the operations against agrarian rebels in the Hedong () region (roughly modern Shanxi), but recalled him in 616. Later that year, Emperor Yang put him in charge of the key city of Taiyuan (, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi).

==Rebellion against Emperor Yang of Sui==
Emperor Yang grew dissatisfied with Li Yuan and Wang Rengong (), the governor of Mayi Commandery (, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi), over their inability to stop incursions by the Eastern Turks (Tujue) and the growing strength of agrarian rebels—particularly the Turk-supported Liu Wuzhou, the Dingyang Khan, who soon rose against Wang and killed him and captured Emperor Yang&#x27;s secondary palace near Taiyuan. Li Yuan also became fearful due to prophecies circulating throughout the empire that the next emperor would be named Li—and because Emperor Yang had killed another official, Li Hun () and his clan over his fears that Li Hun&#x27;s nephew Li Min (, the son-in-law of Emperor Yang&#x27;s sister Yang Lihua, the Princess Leping) had imperial ambitions.

Traditional accounts, compiled during the reign of Li Yuan&#x27;s second son by the Duchess Dou, Li Shimin (Emperor Taizong), emphasize the latter&#x27;s initiative and major role in instigating his father&#x27;s rebellion. According to these, Li Shimin was secretly planning rebellion against Sui rule with Pei Ji, the majordomo of Emperor Yang&#x27;s secondary palace, and with Liu Wenjing, the magistrate of Jinyang County (, i.e., Taiyuan), but at first did not reveal their plans to Li Yuan. At Li Shimin&#x27;s urging, Pei Ji, who had also earlier, against regulations, allowed Li Yuan to have sexual relations with some of late Emperor Wen&#x27;s imperial concubines, persuaded Li Yuan that it was necessary for him to rebel. Modern researchers, however, have concluded that the initiative for the revolt came from Li Yuan himself.

Li Yuan began to gather forces from the region, claiming that they were necessary to defend against the Turks, which drew suspicions from his deputies Wang Wei () and Gao Junya (). Li Yuan, afraid that Wang and Gao would act against him first, then used a Turkic attack as an excuse to falsely claim that Wang and Gao were working in concert with the Turkic &quot;khagan&quot;, Shibi Khan (Ashina Duojishi), and had them executed. He sent secret messengers to Hedong to recall his sons Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji (both by Duchess Dou) and Li Zhiyun (, by his concubine Lady Wan), whom he had left there to watch over his household, and the capital Chang&#x27;an (modern Xi&#x27;an) to recall his daughter (the future Princess Pingyang) and her husband Chai Shao (). Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, leaving Li Zhiyun at Hedong, soon met with Chai, and they arrived together at Taiyuan. Li Yuan&#x27;s daughter, believing it would be difficult for her to flee with Chai, chose to hide instead.

Once Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and Chai arrived at Taiyuan, Li Yuan formally declared his rebellion, but maintained the guise of a Sui loyalist and declared that his intention was simply to install on the throne Emperor Yang&#x27;s grandson Yang You, the Prince of Dai, who was then at Chang&#x27;an, and honor Emperor Yang as &quot;Taishang Huang&quot; (retired emperor). Li Yuan first secured his northern flank by contacting Shibi Khan, offering tribute, and received men and horses in exchange. He put Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin in charge of his army and, leaving Li Yuanji in charge at Taiyuan, advanced south. Meanwhile, the Sui officials at Hedong arrested Li Zhiyun and delivered him to Chang&#x27;an, where he was executed.

His daughter Pingyang sold her possessions to raise an army for him. She persuaded several other leaders to fight under her banner. They took several towns and her army swelled until she had 70,000 troops under her command.

Meanwhile, Li Yuan wrote another rebel leader, Li Mi the Duke of Wei, who was near Luoyang, trying to see if Li Mi would be willing to follow him, but Li Mi, believing in his own strength, had his secretary Zu Junyan () write Li Yuan for him in this way:

Li Yuan was dismayed but, not wanting to make another enemy, wrote back humbly:

Li Mi was pleased with Li Yuan&#x27;s response, believing that Li Yuan was willing to support him, and from that point on, Li Mi and Li Yuan often exchanged messengers. Li Yuan&#x27;s campaign against Chang&#x27;an thus went without opposition from Li Mi. Meanwhile, however, when Li Yuan arrived near Hedong, his army was bogged down by the weather, and with food running out, there were rumors that Eastern Tujue and Liu Wuzhou would attack Taiyuan. Li Yuan initially ordered retreat, but at the earnest opposition by Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, continued to advance. After defeating Sui forces at Huoyi (霍邑, also in modern Yuncheng), he decided to leave a small contingent to watch over Hedong while advancing across the Yellow River into Guanzhong (i.e., the Chang&#x27;an region). Once he did, he headed for Chang&#x27;an himself, while sending Li Jiancheng to capture the territory around the Tong Pass region to prevent Sui forces at Luoyang from reinforcing Chang&#x27;an and Li Shimin north of the Wei River to capture territory there. Meanwhile, his daughter had also risen in rebellion in support of him, and she was able to gather a sizable army and capture some cities. She joined forces with Li Shimin and her husband Chai Shao. Soon, Li Yuan reconsolidated his forces and put Chang&#x27;an under siege. In winter 617, he captured Chang&#x27;an and declared Yang You emperor (as Emperor Gong). He had himself made regent (with the title of grand chancellor) and created the Prince of Tang. (Meanwhile, most of Sui territory did not recognize Yang You as emperor and continued to recognize Emperor Yang as emperor and not as retired emperor.) He sent his nephew Li Xiaogong south, and Li Xiaogong was able to persuade the Sui cities in modern southern Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing to submit.

==Establishment of Tang and gradual unification==

In spring 618, Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu (, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When the news reached Chang&#x27;an, Li Yuan had Yang You yield the throne to him, becoming Emperor Gaozu of the Tang dynasty. He restored much of the institutions of Sui&#x27;s first ruler, Emperor Wen, reversing a number of changes that Emperor Yang made. He created Yang You the Duke of Xi, Li Jiancheng, his oldest son, was named crown prince, while Li Shimin was made the Prince of Qin and Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi. Meanwhile, the Sui officials at Luoyang declared another grandson of Emperor Yang, Yang You&#x27;s brother Yang Tong, the Prince of Yue, as emperor, and refused to recognize the regime change in Chang&#x27;an.

Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s rule immediately faced a major challenge from Xue Ju, an agrarian leader who had declared himself the Emperor of Qin. During the fall of 618, Xue took advantage of Li Shimin&#x27;s illness to defeat an army commanded by Li Shimin and Liu Wenjing at Qianshui Plain (in modern Xianyang, Shanxi) and approach Chang&#x27;an. In response, Gaozu tried to enter an alliance with Li Gui, the Prince of Liang, between whose domain and the Tang Xue&#x27;s Qin state was located, writing Li Gui and referring to him as cousin. Li Gui briefly submitted to Gaozu. Meanwhile, before he could attack Chang&#x27;an, Xue Ju died of illness and was succeeded by his son Xue Rengao, who was a capable commander but who had alienated his generals because of his cruelty. Li Shimin was soon able to attack Xue Rengao at Gaozhi (, in modern Xianyang as well), and force Xue Rengao to surrender.

Meanwhile, Li Mi, having been defeated earlier in the year in a surprise attack (at the Battle of Yanshi) by the Sui general Wang Shichong, fled to Tang territory and submitted to Gaozu. Li Mi&#x27;s general Xu Shiji, who controlled a major part of Li Mi&#x27;s former territory, also submitted, and Emperor Gaozu, impressed with Xu&#x27;s faithfulness to Li Mi, bestowed the imperial surname of Li on Xu. Gaozu created Li Mi the Duke of Xing, but only made him the Minister of Feasts, a post that Li Mi viewed as below his stature. Around New Year 619, Li Mi requested Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s permission to head east to persuade some of his former subordinates to submit to Tang, but once he left Chang&#x27;an, planned to restore his independence. He was ambushed and killed by the Tang general Sheng Yanshi ().

In spring 619, Wang Shichong at Luoyang had Yang Tong yield the throne to him, ending the Sui dynasty and establishing a new state of Zheng.

Around the same time, Li Gui, while stating that he wished to be a Tang subject, refused the Tang creation of Prince of Liang, instead declaring himself the Emperor of Tang. In summer 619, Li Gui&#x27;s official An Xinggui (), formerly a Tang official, rebelled against Li Gui and captured him, submitting to Tang. Gaozu executed Li Gui and incorporated his domain into Tang. Also around the same time, the rebel leader Du Fuwei, who controlled the modern southern Anhui, submitted to Tang, and Gaozu also bestowed the imperial surname of Li on him, creating him the Prince of Wu. Similarly, Luo Yi, who controlled the modern Beijing region, submitted, was bestowed the imperial surname of Li, and was created the Prince of Yan.

Meanwhile, Tang was facing another serious threat—Liu Wuzhou, now determined to march south against Tang. Emperor Gaozu sent Pei Ji against Liu&#x27;s advancing army, but Pei was defeated by Liu, who then put Taiyuan under siege. Li Yuanji fled back to Chang&#x27;an, and much of modern Shanxi was seized by Liu. Emperor Gaozu then sent Li Shimin against Liu, and by summer 620, Li Shimin had defeated Liu, forcing him to flee to the Eastern Turks. Liu&#x27;s territory was incorporated into Tang. Around the same time, however, Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia made a major offensive against the cities that had submitted to Tang in modern Hebei and Henan, north of the Yellow River, seizing nearly all of them and taking Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s cousin Li Shentong () the Prince of Huai&#x27;an, Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s sister the Princess Tong&#x27;an, and Li Shiji&#x27;s father Li Gai () captive. With Li Gai in Dou&#x27;s custody, Li Shiji surrendered to Dou as well. In 620, Li Shiji, in association with another Tang general who surrendered to Dou, Li Shanghu (), plotted to ambush Dou, but the plot was discovered; Li Shanghu was killed, and Li Shiji fled back to Tang.

In 620, Li Fuwei captured much of the territory of another agrarian ruler, Li Zitong, the Emperor of Wu, in the lower Yangtze River region, in the name of the Tang dynasty. Li Zitong, in turn, defeated and took over the territory of Shen Faxing the Prince of Liang, roughly modern Zhejiang.

After Li Shimin defeated Liu, he started a campaign against Wang&#x27;s Zheng state in fall 620. He initially could not decisively defeat Zheng, but by spring 621 had put the Zheng capital Luoyang under a tight siege, although he was not able to capture it. Wang sought aid from Dou. The latter agreed, concerned that a Tang victory over Zheng would also mean his own demise, but at the same time was eager to exploit the weakness of the Zheng and claim its domains for himself. Emperor Gaozu was initially fearful that Dou and Wang would be able to sandwich Li Shimin&#x27;s forces between them and ordered Li Shimin to retreat, but upon Li Shimin&#x27;s petition changed his mind and permitted Li Shimin to remain in the Luoyang region. Li Shimin, leaving Li Yuanji in charge of the siege of Luoyang, advanced and took up position at Hulao Pass. In summer 621, the Tang and Xia forces engaged at Hulao, and Li Shimin defeated Dou, capturing him. Despairing, Wang also surrendered, and most of the Zheng territory was seized by the Tang. Xia territory was also seized by Tang, but after Emperor Gaozu executed Dou, Dou&#x27;s general Liu Heita rose against the Tang and seized most of the former Xia territory, while Xu Yuanlang, a rebel leader who had previously submitted to Zheng, also rose in revolt, occupying the modern Shandong region.

Also in 621, Li Xiaogong defeated Xiao Xian the Emperor of Liang, who had controlled the modern Hubei, Hunan, and Guangxi region, forcing Xiao Xian to surrender. On another front, Li Fuwei&#x27;s lieutenant Fu Gongshi defeated Li Zitong, forcing him to surrender as well. Liang and Wu territory were seized by Tang.

Meanwhile, while not as noted as Emperor Gao of Han&#x27;s killing of Han Xin and Peng Yue, historians have nevertheless noted that some contributors to Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s establishment of Tang were wrongly killed by him or killed based on fairly little evidence of wrongdoing:
* Liu Wenjing, in 619, on accusation that he engaged sorcerers.
* Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s cousin Dugu Huai&#x27;en (), in 620, on accusation of treason.
* Li Zhongwen () the Duke of Zhenxiang, in 620, on accusation of collaboration with Eastern Tujue.
* Liu Shirang () the Duke of Yingyang, in 623, on accusation of collaboration with Eastern Tujue.

==Struggle between sons and the Xuanwu Gate Incident==
In spring 622, Li Shimin defeated Liu Heita, forcing him to flee to the Eastern Turks, but Liu Heita soon returned with Turkic reinforcements and killed Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s nephew Li Daoxuan () the Prince of Huaiyang in battle, again seizing former Xia territory, although by this point Li Shimin and Li Yuanji had also defeated Xu Yuanlang and reduced his territory to a few cities.

Meanwhile, an intense rivalry had developed between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin, as while Li Jiancheng had some contributions toward Tang&#x27;s reunification of China, Li Shimin had been the one defeating and capturing the major rivals Xue Rengao, Liu Wuzhou, Dou Jiande, and Wang Shichong, causing him to possess the greater reputation among the army. Li Yuanji, who was also often relied on by Emperor Gaozu as a general, supported Li Jiancheng in this rivalry, and often pushed Li Jiancheng toward a more hardline position against Li Shimin, wanting to be crown prince when Li Jiancheng would become emperor. Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji had better relations with Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s favored young concubines than Li Shimin did (as their mother Duchess Dou had died before Tang&#x27;s establishment), and those concubines helped rehabilitate Li Jiancheng&#x27;s standing before Emperor Gaozu, causing him to no longer consider making Li Shimin crown prince instead, as he considered at one point.

By winter 622, Liu Heita posed the only remaining major threat against Tang rule. At the suggestion of his staff members Wang Gui and Wei Zheng, who argued that Li Jiancheng needed some victories himself to establish his reputation, Li Jiancheng volunteered to command the army against Liu Heita. Emperor Gaozu thus sent Li Jiancheng, assisted by Li Yuanji. Around the new year 623, with Liu&#x27;s forced bogged down while attacking Tang&#x27;s Wei Prefecture (, in modern Handan, Hebei), Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji engaged him at Guantao (, in modern Handan as well), crushing him. Liu fled north toward the Eastern Turks, but was ambushed and captured by his own official Zhuge Dewei (), who delivered him to Li Jiancheng. Li Jiancheng executed Liu. Around the same time, Xu was killed in flight. Meanwhile, Lin Shihong the Emperor of Chu, who had one point controlled modern Jiangxi and Guangdong, had died, and his followers scattered. China was by this point completely unified by Tang except for the domain of Liang Shidu the Emperor of Liang, who controlled modern northern Shaanxi and western Inner Mongolia, although, with Li Fuwei at Chang&#x27;an, Fu Gongshi rebelled in 623 and declared himself the Emperor of Song. Fu&#x27;s rebellion, however, was quelled by Li Xiaogong in 624.

Meanwhile, the rivalry between Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin intensified. In 624, Li Jiancheng requisitioned a number of soldiers from the general Li Yi the Prince of Yan, to supplement his guard corps, against Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s regulations. When this was revealed to Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Gaozu rebuked Li Jiancheng and exiled his guard commander Keda Zhi (). When, subsequently, Li Jiancheng nevertheless requested the commandant at Qing Prefecture (, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), Yang Wen&#x27;gan (), to conscript troops, presumably to guard against Li Shimin, the officers Erzhu Huan () and Qiao Gongshan () informed Emperor Gaozu that Li Jiancheng was encouraging Yang to start a rebellion so that they could seize power together. Emperor Gaozu, then at Renzhi Palace (, in modern Tongchuan, Shaanxi), was incensed, and summoned Li Jiancheng, then at Chang&#x27;an, to Renzhi Palace. Li Jiancheng briefly flirted the idea of occupying Chang&#x27;an and not accepting the order, but eventually reported to Renzhi Palace to request forgiveness. Emperor Gaozu put him under arrest. When Yang heard this, Yang rebelled, and Emperor Gaozu, after promising Li Shimin that he would be made crown prince, sent Li Shimin to attack Yang. (Under Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s promise, Li Jiancheng would be removed as crown prince and created the Prince of Shu instead. He would then send Li Jiancheng to the modern Sichuan region.) Once Li Shimin left, however, Li Yuanji, Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s concubines, and the chancellor Feng Deyi, all spoke on Li Jiancheng&#x27;s behalf, and Emperor Gaozu changed his mind, released Li Jiancheng, and allowed him to return to Chang&#x27;an and remain as crown prince. Instead, Emperor Gaozu only blamed the discord between his sons on Li Jiancheng&#x27;s staff members Wang Gui and Wei Ting (), and Li Shimin&#x27;s staff member Du Yan, exiling them. Yang was subsequently assassinated by his own subordinates.

Another problem that Emperor Gaozu faced was constant Eastern Turkic incursions. Emperor Gaozu seriously considered burning Chang&#x27;an to the ground and moving the capital to Fancheng (, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), a suggestion that Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji, and the chancellor Pei Ji agreed with. Li Shimin opposed, however, and the plan was not carried out. Meanwhile, Li Shimin himself was sending his confidants to Luoyang to build up personal control of the army there. After an incident in which Li Shimin suffered a severe case of food poisoning after feasting at Li Jiancheng&#x27;s palace—an event that both Emperor Gaozu and Li Shimin apparently interpreted as an assassination attempt—Emperor Gaozu considered sending Li Shimin to guard Luoyang to prevent further conflict, but Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, after consulting each other, believed that this would only give Li Shimin an opportunity to build up his personal power there, and therefore opposed it. Emperor Gaozu therefore did not carry out the plan.

By 626, Li Shimin was fearful that he would be killed by Li Jiancheng, and his staff members Fang Xuanling, Du Ruhui, and Zhangsun Wuji were repeatedly encouraging Li Shimin to attack Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji first—while Wei Zheng was encouraging Li Jiancheng to attack Li Shimin first. Li Jiancheng persuaded Emperor Gaozu to remove Fang and Du, as well as Li Shimin&#x27;s trusted guard officers Yuchi Gong and Cheng Zhijie (), from Li Shimin&#x27;s staff. Zhangsun, who remained on Li Shimin&#x27;s staff, continued to try to persuade Li Shimin to attack first.

In summer 626, the Eastern Turkic khaganate was making another attack, and under Li Jiancheng&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Gaozu, instead of sending Li Shimin to resist the Turks as he first was inclined, decided to send Li Yuanji instead. Li Yuanji was given command of much of the army previously under Li Shimin&#x27;s control, further troubling Li Shimin, who believed that with the army in Li Yuanji&#x27;s hands, he would be unable to resist an attack. Li Shimin had Yuchi summon Fang and Du back to his mansion secretly, and then on one night submitted an accusation to Emperor Gaozu that Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji were committing adultery with Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s concubines. Emperor Gaozu, in response, issued summonses to Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji for the next morning, convening the senior officials Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, and Chen Shuda to examine Li Shimin&#x27;s accusations. As Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji approached the central gate leading to Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s palace, Xuanwu Gate (), Li Shimin carried out the ambush he had set. He personally fired an arrow that killed Li Jiancheng. Subsequently, Yuchi killed Li Yuanji. Li Shimin&#x27;s forces entered the palace and, under the intimidation of Li Shimin&#x27;s forces, Emperor Gaozu agreed to create Li Shimin crown prince. Meanwhile, Li Shimin accused the late Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji of plotting treason, posthumously demoted them to commoners and had their sons all executed as well, with Emperor Gaozu unable to oppose the action. Two months later, Emperor Gaozu passed the throne to Li Shimin (as Emperor Taizong).

==As retired emperor==
Emperor Gaozu, as retired emperor, did not appear to try to exert much influence in the reign of his son Emperor Taizong, and not much was recorded about his activities. Indeed, Emperor Taizong, almost immediately, began reversing some of his policies, including his policies of creating many relatives to be imperial princes (which Emperor Taizong reversed later in 626, reducing the ranks of most of those princes to dukes) and Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s gathering of many ladies in waiting (which Emperor Taizong reversed in 628, releasing about 3,000 ladies in waiting from service, although Emperor Taizong himself, later in his reign, appeared to have gathered as many if not more).

In 629, Emperor Gaozu moved from the main palace, Taiji Palace () to the subsidiary Hongyi Palace (), which was then renamed Da&#x27;an Palace (). Only then was Emperor Taizong able to move from the crown prince&#x27;s palace to Taiji Palace.

In 630, when Emperor Gaozu, who had been submitting tribute to the Eastern Turks throughout his reign, heard that Emperor Taizong had sent the general Li Jing to defeat and capture the Turkic &quot;khagan&quot; Jiali Khan (Ashina Duobi), commented, &quot;Gaozu of Han was trapped [at Baideng (, in modern Datong, Shanxi) in 200 BCE by Xiongnu forces] and could not avenge himself. Now my son can destroy Tujue. I have entrusted the empire to the right person, and what do I have to worry about?&quot; He subsequently summoned a number of princes and princesses, along with high level officials, to celebrate the victory, playing the pipa himself at the celebration and having the guests dance to it.

As Chang&#x27;an was often hot during the summer, Emperor Taizong often invited Emperor Gaozu to go with him to Jiucheng Palace (, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), to avoid the heat during the summer. However, as Sui&#x27;s Emperor Wen had died there (which was named Renshou Palace () during the Sui dynasty), Emperor Gaozu did not want to visit Jiucheng Palace. Rather, in 634, Emperor Taizong began to construct another summer palace, Daming Palace (), to serve as Emperor Gaozu&#x27;s summer palace, but Emperor Gaozu fell ill before it was completed, and he never visited Daming Palace. He died in June 635.

<text>The First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (Princess Royal&#x27;s Volunteer Corps) (FANY (PRVC)) is a British independent all-female registered charity formed in 1907 and active in both nursing and intelligence work during the World Wars. Its members wear a military-style uniform, but it is not part of the Regular Army or Army Reserve; members do not train at Sandhurst, nor do they hold a commission.

==Formation==
It was formed as the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry in 1907 as a first aid link between the field hospitals and the front lines, and was given the &#x27;yeomanry&#x27; name as its members were originally mounted on horseback. Unlike nursing organisations, the FANY saw themselves rescuing the wounded and giving first aid, similar to a modern combat medic. Their founder, Sergeant Major, later Captain, Edward Baker, a veteran of the Sudan Campaign and the Second Boer War, felt that a single rider could get to a wounded soldier faster than a horse-drawn ambulance. Each woman was trained not only in first aid but signalling and drilling in cavalry movements. The original uniform was a scarlet tunic with white facings, a navy-blue riding skirt with three rows of white braid at the bottom and a hard-topped scarlet hat with black-leather peak. The uniform gradually became more practical and less flamboyant, including importantly, a divided skirt to allow public riding astride. By 1914 it consisted of a khaki tunic, khaki skirt and a khaki solar topee. Shortly after their arrival in France, at the beginning of the First World War, the topee was discarded in favour of a soft bonnet, the hard topee proving impractical for driving an ambulance with a low canvas roof.

Early leaders of the FANY included Grace McDougall and Lilian Franklin, &quot;The Boss&quot;.

== First World War ==

On 27 October 1914, their offer of assistance as paramedics having been refused by the War Office, a party of six FANYs, including Lieutenants Franklin and McDougall, plus three trained nurses and two male orderlies, crossed to Calais. They were shortly followed by a privately funded motor ambulance. The Belgian Army welcomed them with open arms and for the next two years the FANYs drove ambulances, opened a hospital and two convalescent homes and set up a casualty clearing station near the Front. Observing this, British official resistance crumbled, and on 1 January 1916 the FANY became the first women to drive officially for the British Army, with the establishment of an ambulance section at Calais. The role for the British was to transport the dead and dying from clearing stations to hospitals and hospital ships. This was followed by the formation of several convoys for the French Army, stationed in the southern sector of the Front, near Verdun.

By the Armistice, the Corps had been awarded many decorations for bravery, including 17 Military Medals, 1 Legion d&#x27;Honneur and 27 Croix de Guerre. Although a number of FANYs were injured while serving in France, there was only one death; Evelyn Fidgeon Shaw CdeG died while serving with the French and was buried by them with full military honours in Sézanne.

McDougall wrote an anonymous 1917 account of her experiences &quot;Nursing Adventures: A FANY in France&quot;, retitled &quot;A Nurse at War: Nursing Adventures in France&quot; for America. In 1919 Pat Beauchamp wrote a book titled &quot;Fanny Goes to War&quot; about her experiences serving with the Corps during the First World War.
&quot;The Coffin Jump&quot; installation at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park was inspired by the work of the FANY during the First World War.
== Inter-war years ==
Being independent and self financing, the FANY was not disbanded after the First World War, unlike the women&#x27;s services. As a result of service in the general strike of 1926, when the name was briefly changed to Ambulance Car Corps (FANY), the Corps was finally recognised by the War Office and allowed to appear on the Army list, although not publicly funded.

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s FANYs continued training, including radio work, first aid, and motor vehicle maintenance and mechanics. Numbers grew and several regional sections were established. In 1931 an independent unit of the Corps was set up in East Africa, known as The Women&#x27;s Territorial Service (EA). This was the first overseas all-women unit to be formed.

In 1937, wishing to move away completely from any assumed connection with formal nursing, the Corps became the Women&#x27;s Transport Service (WTS (FANY)).

== Second World War ==
At the start of the war the FANY was led by Mary Baxter Ellis who had served with the Corps during the First World War. Helen Gwynne-Vaughan was the first Chief Controller of the newly formed Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS). This was a role that Ellis had turned down as she preferred to lead the FANY. Ellis agreed however to supply 1,500 FANY motor mechanics to serve with the ATS as long as these FANYs could be independent. This was agreed but Gwynne-Vaughan broke the agreement and forced the FANY/ATS to be absorbed into the territorial service. Ellis demurred, but won the agreement that these FANY/ATS would wear their FANY flash, a tradition dating back many years, with the chinstrap of their hats over the crown. An autonomous FANY HQ ran simultaneously in London. These members were known as the ‘Free FANYs&#x27;, and they wore their uniform as of right.

One better known role of the FANY in the Second World War is their service with the Special Operations Executive. FANYs became involved in the SOE in 1940 through the friendship between Phyllis Bingham (secretary to the then Corps commander) and Colonel, later Major-General, Colin Gubbins (Director of Operations and Training SOE). The FANYs service began with their involvement in the highly secretive Auxiliary Units set up in 1940 as a stay-behind force in case of invasion. By the end of the war over 3,000 FANYs had served with SOE; as trainers, coders, signallers, forgers, dispatchers, and, most famously, as agents. Recruits were trained in one of four fields: Motor transport, wireless telegraphy, codes or general. They worked on coding and signals, acting as conductors for agents and providing administration and technical support for the Special Training Schools. Their work was top secret and often highly skilled.

Of the 50 women sent by SOE into France 39 were members of the FANY. Of these 39 women, 12 were murdered by the Nazis and one Corps member died in the field. Many decorations, of both the UK and other countries, were awarded to FANYs for their service and outstanding courage. Among these, four of the highest UK decorations were the George Cross awarded to Odette Hallowes (who was incarcerated and tortured, but survived the war), Violette Szabo and Noor Inayat Khan (these latter two perishing in captivity and decorated posthumously). Nancy Wake&#x27;s awards included the George Medal.

Corps members operated in several theatres of war, including North Africa, Italy, India and the Far East. The FANY served the Finnish Government. A section was attached to the Polish Army, based mainly in Linlithgow where they provided the Poles with uniforms, weapons, vehicles, equipment, food, administration services and drivers’ services. Corps members also provided the guard of honour at the funeral of General Wladyslaw Sikorski, who had gone up to Scotland several times to inspect his troops. A Kenyan section, formed in 1931, which was made the official East African unit by the War Office in August 1941, was very active during the war. This section took women from all over the southern half of Africa. Other FANYs were attached to the British Red Cross, the American Ambulance Corps and the French Committee for the French Red Cross. In 1944 another large group were deployed to the Indian subcontinent and the Far East with South East Asia Command. Altogether over 6,000 FANYs served in the Second World War.

Maud MacLellan, a FANY who served with the ATS during the war, taught the future Queen Elizabeth to drive.

A memorial at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Knightsbridge commemorates 52 named members who died on active service with the Corps in the First and Second World Wars, including 9 members who died when the SS &quot;Khedive Ismail&quot; was sunk by a Japanese submarine in 1944. FANYs are also commemorated on the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey.

Below is a chart of WTS (FANY) ranks compared to the British Army.

==Cold War==
During the Cold War the FANY took on new roles including the provision of national communications support as part of 2 (National Communication) Signal Brigade. These were arrangements in place for ensuring the continuity of government in the event of a substantial attack on the United Kingdom. In such an eventuality, Corps members would have been required to assist the Brigade by deploying to one of a number of secret bunkers established around the country to house dispersed government.

==Contemporary role==

The FANY was officially renamed the Princess Royal&#x27;s Volunteer Corps in 1999, after being given permission by Anne, Princess Royal to use her title, and is now referred to as FANY (PRVC). The original name has greater recognition, and greater prominence even in official publications and on its website. The Princess Royal became Commandant-in-Chief of the Corps in 1981, following the death of her great great aunt Princess Alice who was the Corps&#x27;s first Commandant-in-Chief in 1933.

Today, the Corps focuses on deploying specialist rapid response teams to support civil and military authorities at times of crisis. Most recently the Corps has been deployed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, serving at NHS Nightingale Hospital London, the North London and Westminster Coroners, City of London Police and the National Emergencies Trust Coronavirus Appeal. Members train every week, and are on call 24/7 to help in times of national emergency. The Corps is open to volunteers between the ages of 18 and 45 who reside or work near London, within the M25. Members are trained in communications, first aid skills, map reading, navigation and orienteering, shooting, self-defence, survival techniques and advanced driving. Their working dress is similar to that of the modern British Army; on formal occasions they wear a uniform similar to historic female British Army Service Dress. They also have their own &#x27;rank&#x27; system.

<text>Karl Rudolf Walden (1 December 1878 in Helsinki – 25 October 1946) was a Finnish industrialist and a military leader.

==Education==
Walden received his military education at the Hamina Cadet School and graduated in 1900. He was dismissed from service in 1902, in connection with conscription strikes.

==Finnish civil war==
From 20 February 1918 till 5 March 1918, Walden was chief of Vaasa military district. From then until 6 May 1918, he was chief of headquarters of the rear. He then became chief of security of the occupied areas until 22 May 1918. On 28 November 1918, Walden became minister of war and held this position until 15 August 1919. Walden was then promoted to commander in chief of the Finnish army and the Civil Guard (27 November 1918 - 30 December 1918). Walden and general of the White army Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim developed a close working relationship that continued throughout the inter war period (head of Finnish Red Cross in the 20th century) and during the Winter War and Continuation War.

==Finnish paper industry==
After leaving the army, Walden sought a career in business. He moved to Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, and after few years founded a sales agency for Finnish paper. As a steadfast patriot, Walden also became a prominent figure in the large Finnish community of Saint Petersburg. From 1906 to 1946, Walden worked in the paper industry. He worked to consolidate the Finnish paper industry. He founded &quot;Yhtyneet Paperitehtaat Oy&quot; (United Paper Mills Ltd) and was the first president of &quot;Finpap&quot;, a Finnish paper sales association.

==Winter War==
During the Finnish-Soviet Winter War, Walden was recalled to active service. From 3 December 1939 to 27 March 1940, he was a member of the war cabinet. On 27 March 1940 he became Minister of Defence and continued in this role till 27 November 1944. Walden was able to maintain important diplomatic relationships with Sweden and the United States. Walden represented Finland at the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Moscow Peace Treaty (1940), and the Armistice treaty of Moscow (1944).

After the Civil war and during the 1930s there was general distrust of the labour movement and the patriotism of the Finnish worker. In Winter War this proved unfounded and the nation was united. Industrial leader Walden and Väinö Tanner (Social Democrat leader and Finnish foreign minister) had developed mutual respect and worked well together. In the so-called Betrothal of January 1940, Finland&#x27;s industry associations acknowledged the trade unions as negotiation partners regarding labour issues.

== Civilian and military decorations ==
In 1919, Walden became Commander of the Order of the White Rose. Later, he received the Grand Cross of the order. For his services during and after the Finnish Civil War he was awarded the Grand Cross of Liberty. He was also awarded the Iron Cross (1918). During the 1920s, Walden became a knight of the Order of the Polar Star (Sweden). In 1928, Walden received the Danish Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog personally from King Christian X. During his service as minister of defence, Walden received several decorations including the Swedish Order of the Sword, the German Order of the German Eagle and Iron Cross (1939) 1st and 2nd class, the Hungarian Grand Cross of Order of Merit, and the Romanian Grand Cross of Order of the Star. On 2 December 1944 he received the Mannerheim Cross of the Order of the Cross of Liberty for his services to the country.

<doc id="1065797" wikidata="Q1724995" url="?curid=1065797" title="Monster Garage">
<text>Monster Garage is an American reality television series that aired on the Discovery Channel and hosted by Jesse James. Each episode was an hour in length and was conceived and produced (along with James) by Thom Beers.

The show premiered on June 23, 2002 and concluded on June 12, 2006.

On February 24, 2020, it was announced that the series will be revived and premiere in 2020 on TLC. This was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It premiered on Discovery, Inc.&#x27;s new streaming service Discovery+ on launch day, January 4, 2021.

==Premise==
A team of five people with mechanical, fabricating, or modifying expertise was assembled to modify a vehicle into a &quot;monster machine.&quot; On the show this generally meant making one vehicle that could transform into another such as a PT Cruiser which could change into a wood chipper, or a school bus which transformed into a pontoon boat. Occasionally vehicles were modified so as to hide non-vehicular functions, such as a police car which doubled as a donut shop (built by a team of cops), or a Toyota Tundra which was modified so as to allow it to discharge a motorcycle at high speeds. Build teams who successfully completed their assignment were rewarded with expensive tool kits.

==Rules==
According to the show, the rules were as follows:
# When complete, the monster was to appear to be stock.
# The team had $3000 (later raised to $5000) for parts. Any &#x27;seat change&#x27; found during the build was added to the total.
# The team had seven days to complete the monster.
#*The first day was for designing
#*the next five were for building
#*and the seventh day was for testing the monster

In practice, as the series progressed, some liberties were taken with the first two rules, at times becoming punchlines. In one episode, when a Chevrolet El Camino was turned into a Figure 8 race car, James discarded plans for a spoiler on the vehicle, sarcastically citing the first rule.

Starting with season 4, the winning team also donated a toolkit to a high school of their choice.

==Host==
Host Jesse James claims to be the great-great-grandson of a cousin of the legendary wild west outlaw, Jesse James. Jesse G. James has both mechanical and metal fabricating expertise and is the founder, owner and head bike builder for his custom chopper shop, West Coast Choppers. Jesse said he liked monsters that went fast and did something. He preferred hard working build crew members. His favorite monster vehicles were the Ford Ambulance Wheel-stander and the Chevrolet Blazer Pikes Peak hill climber. One of Jesse&#x27;s ambitions throughout the run of the show was to build a monster that could top 200 mph, which he was unsuccessful at achieving.

==Announcer==
Announcing for this show was done by Brett &quot;The Big Schwag&quot; Wagner who later became the host of the Speed Channel show Pass Time. He was very memorable for frequently shouting out &quot;You gotta be kidding me!&quot; during the tests of the &quot;monster&quot; vehicles and signing off most episodes saying: &quot;The next Monster Garage challenge is JUST... AROUND... THE BEND!&quot;.

==Failed Monsters==
With rules as strict as they were in the Monster Garage, there was a 1 in 10 monster build failure rate. When a team failed to complete a vehicle in time, it was destroyed by host Jesse James.

;Failed Monsters and their Ultimate Demise
* Cadillac Hearse/Car Crusher &quot;Grim Ripper&quot; — was the first failure on Monster Garage. The build team spent more time goofing off than building the car. In one scene, the original Batmobile appeared at the shop, and Jesse quipped &quot;tryin&#x27; to weld&quot; when asked what he was doing. The non-functional Car Crusher was then sent to Terminal Island to meet its fate in a scrapper. At the suggestion of the scrap machine&#x27;s owner, the Hearse came to an explosive end with a propane tank in the back. In Grim Ripper II, the team spoofed the demise of their first project by having the car in which they arrived at Terminal Island meet the same fate as the first hearse.
* Scion xA/Rock&#x27;em, Sock&#x27;em Scions — In this two-episode special, Jesse handpicked a team of the best Monster Garage participants at the time, while the producers picked a &quot;mis-fit&quot; team of quirky and somewhat anti-social participants to build Rock&#x27;em Sock&#x27;em Robots out of two new Scions. The winning team would win a &quot;special edition&quot; set of Mac tools while the other team would see their creation turned into scrap. Jesse&#x27;s handpicked team, dubbed the Red Rockers, secured the Scion xB, while the producer-selected Blue Bombers received the xA. In the challenge, the Bombers&#x27; xA suffered transmission issues, meaning the Rockers won by default. Some members of the Bombers stayed to see their failed monster off, only to find out that they would be receiving tool sets as well.
* DeLorean Hovercraft — In an early attempt to shave time off the build, the team removed the outer bodywork of a De Lorean and put it on a donor personal hovercraft. Quite angry about this decision (even though he himself declared early on that he didn&#x27;t like the project), Jesse fired one of the team members after a snide comment. Working again with a &quot;new&quot; De Lorean donor, the team tried unsuccessfully to make the monster hover but ultimately ran out of time. The car was eventually towed to a naval base where a tank tracked vehicle crushed the unfinished vehicle.
* Mazda Miata Jetski — Some fans have noted that the reason why this build failed was the engine might have contributed to the air intake being flooded due to the heavy weight in the nose area. Nevertheless, three members of the build team opted to send the Miata to the scrapheap with a dynamite explosion.
* Dirt Track Camaro — For the second time in MG history, this build had an all-girl build team (the first was the Black Widow Demolition Derby Car, which was heavily gutted moments before a demolition derby). However, a plague of miscommunication and personal differences sent this Camaro to a steel smelter and eventual recycling into rebar.
* Peel Trident Micro Car — With a team composed of mostly dwarves, the team attempted to put a Hayabusa engine into a tiny Peel Car. Some fans felt that the team was compromised due to their small stature, but Jesse coldly stated that he gave no team any exceptions; they were all equal. Other fans feel the project was simply too ambitious for builders of any size. After they failed, Jesse, sporting some of his personal gun collection, took out the Peel with a .50 caliber sniper rifle.
* Anglia Nitro Dragster — The team did not give themselves enough time to fire up the engine. The engine ended up not firing due to timing issues, and Jesse brought it to a construction site where a crane dropped a large metal box on it.

==Successful monsters destroyed in Day 7==
* Mazda RX-7/Doom Buggy — Unsatisfied with how the Sandrail performed, Jesse destroyed it with a Dillon Minigun.
* 1970 Cadillac Coupe DeVille/Demolition-Derby Car - In day 7, Cindy Regimbald lost the demolition derby, leaving the car smashed from the derby.
* 1970 Oval Racer/RC Car - During the challenge, after Jesse lapped the car about 5 times, he rammed his car into the quarter panel of it and sent it smashing into wall of the short track. The monster was totalled, and it was stored outside the Monster Garage, later to be cannibalized in future episodes.
* 1969-1970 Classic Farm Tractor/Crop Circler - The vehicle was built successfully, but Jesse decided the project was uninteresting, so he burnt it in a desert with a flamethrower.

==Episodes==

==UK version==
A UK version of the show was aired in 2004 by Channel 4. The team always included a Hell&#x27;s Angel known as &quot;Cookie&quot;. There was a budget of £3,000. Only 3 days were used for the build. Cars often looked radically different from the production models. Challenges included; converting a Toyota into a lawnmower, a Lotus into a hovercraft, and an ice cream van into a riot truck. In one episode, the team sold the internal fittings of the car that was to be transformed (A Rolls-Royce) to raise funds to convert it into a muck spreader.

The UK series lasted only 8 episodes.

==Videos==
MBI published &quot;Monster Garage&quot; videos, detailing the Ford Mustang lawn mower, Ford Explorer garbage truck, limousine firetruck, and the Volkswagen Beetle swamp boat.

==Monster Garage sale==
The 2008 Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction included 42 of the surviving project vehicles.

==Adaptations==

===Video games===
Invictus Games Ltd. developed a PC video game, based on the series. An Xbox remake was made by Impulse Games in 2004. Both games were published by Activision Value.

===Books===
&quot;Inside Monster Garage&quot;, a book about the TV series, was published by Meridith Books.

MBI Publishing Company has published Monster Garage instruction books under the Motorbooks brand, including:

*Monster Garage: How to Custom Paint Damn Near Anything
*Monster Garage: How to Customize Damn Near Anything
*Monster Garage: How to Fabricate Damn Near Anything
*Monster Garage: How to Weld Damn Near Anything

&quot;Monster Garage: How to Custom Paint Damn Near Anything&quot;, &quot;Monster Garage: How to Customize Damn Near Anything&quot;, &quot;Monster Garage: How to Weld Damn Near Anything&quot; were also sold together as &quot;Monster Garage Gift Set&quot; and

<text>Samiam (pronounced &quot;sam-I-am&quot;) is an American punk rock band from Berkeley, California, active since 1988.

==History==

Samiam was formed in late 1988 after the breakup of the Gilman club mainstay Isocracy. Their first show was in January 1989 with Christ on Parade. They released records through New Red Archives and Hopeless Records in the US and Burning Heart Records in Europe.

In the mid-&#x27;90s, the band was signed to Atlantic Records, releasing their major label debut &quot;Clumsy&quot; in 1994. Their video for single &quot;Capsized&quot; gained considerable airplay on MTV. Samiam performed on &quot;The Jon Stewart Show&quot; in 1994.

Samiam recorded one more album during their time with Atlantic, though the label opted not to release it. The album, &quot;You Are Freaking Me Out&quot;, was eventually released in 1997 by Burning Heart Records. Its single &quot;She Found You&quot; garnered considerable radio play in 1998.

Over the years, Samiam has toured extensively throughout Europe, North America and Japan, and performed with bands like Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, NOFX, No Doubt, Toadies, Sense Field, Blink-182, Deftones, 311, Millencolin, and Fishbone.

In early 2001, the band went on hiatus after supporting the &quot;Astray&quot; album. Despite what was initially to be a breakup, they continued to tour abroad yearly (Europe and South America) with occasional shows in New York City, San Francisco and Los Angeles. This led to the recording of the band&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Whatever&#x27;s Got You Down&quot;, which was released in 2006. Samiam toured Europe three more times in 2006 and 2007 and played various US dates in 2008. 

Samiam toured Australia in September 2009, together with the band A Death in the Family. This was followed by an appearance at The Fest in Gainesville, Florida in November 2009 and shows in Santiago, Chile; San Miguel, Argentina; and São Paulo, Brazil in December 2009. October 2010 brought them together again with A Death in the Family for a European and East Coast tour.

Samiam released &quot;Trips&quot;, their first album in five years, on September 6, 2011. Semi annual tours have followed ever since in Europe, Australia and South America. In 2015, while in Chicago for an appearance at Riot Fest, a four-song demo was recorded but never finished.

In December 2019, Samiam announced on their Facebook page that they are working on their first studio album in years.

==Musical style==
The band&#x27;s musical style has been described as punk rock, hardcore punk, pop-punk, melodic hardcore, and emo. Samiam&#x27;s influences during their initial 1990s run included the Replacements, Hüsker Dü, Swervedriver, and Short Dogs Grow.

During World War I, she saw front-line service in II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916. saw action during the engagement, and was hit by one large-caliber shell. After the battle, was relegated to guard duty in the mouth of the Elbe River before being decommissioned in late 1917. As one of the few battleships permitted for Germany by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, was again pressed into fleet service in the 1920s. In 1935, the old battleship was converted into a training ship for naval cadets.

 fired the first cannon shots of World War II when she bombarded the Polish base at Danzig&#x27;s Westerplatte in the early morning hours of 1 September 1939. The ship was used as a training vessel for the majority of the war, and was sunk by British bombers in Gotenhafen in December 1944. was subsequently salvaged and then beached for use by the Soviet Navy as a target. As of 1990, the ship&#x27;s bell was on display in the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden.

== Design ==


The passage of the Second Naval Law in 1900 under the direction of (&quot;VAdm&quot;—Vice Admiral) Alfred von Tirpitz secured funding for the construction of twenty new battleships over the next seventeen years. The first group, the five s, were laid down in the early 1900s, and shortly thereafter design work began on a follow-on design, which became the . The -class ships were broadly similar to the s, featuring incremental improvements in armor protection. They also abandoned the gun turrets for the secondary battery guns, moving them back to traditional casemates to save weight. The British battleship —armed with ten 12-inch (30.5 cm) guns—was commissioned in December 1906. &quot;Dreadnought&quot;″s revolutionary design rendered every capital ship of the German navy obsolete, including the class.

 had a length of , a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced normally and up to at combat loading. She was equipped with three triple expansion engines and twelve coal-fired water-tube boilers that produced a rated and a top speed of . In addition to being the second-fastest ship of her class, was the second-most fuel efficient. At a cruising speed of , she could steam for . She had a standard crew of 35 officers and 708 enlisted men.

The ship&#x27;s primary armament consisted of four 28 cm SK L/40 guns in two twin turrets; one turret was placed forward and the other aft. Her offensive armament was rounded out with a secondary battery of fourteen SK L/40 guns mounted individually in casemates. A battery of twenty-two SK L/45 guns in single mounts provided defense against torpedo boats. The ship was also armed with six torpedo tubes, all below the waterline. One was in the bow, one in the stern, and four on the broadside. Her armored belt was thick amidships in the citadel, and she had a thick armored deck. The main battery turrets had thick sides.

== Service history ==
 was laid down on 18 August 1905 at the dockyard in Kiel. She was launched on 17 December 1906, the last pre-dreadnought battleship of the German navy. At ″s launching ceremony, she was christened by Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, the German Empress; Wilhelm II was also in attendance. Ernst Gunther, the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, gave the commissioning speech.

Upon completion, was commissioned for sea trials on 6 July 1908. Her crew largely came from her sister ship . On 21 September the ship was assigned to II Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet, alongside her sister ships. In November, fleet and unit exercises were conducted in the Baltic Sea. The training regimen in which participated followed a similar pattern over the next five years. Fleet maneuvers were conducted in the spring, followed by a summer cruise to Norway, and additional fleet training in the fall. This included another cruise into the Atlantic, from 7 July to 1 August 1909.

Starting in September 1910, Friedrich Boedicker took command of the ship, a position he held for the next three years. On 3 October 1911, the ship was transferred back to II Squadron. Due to the Agadir Crisis in July, the summer cruise only went into the Baltic. In 1913, she won the Kaiser&#x27;s (Gunnery Award). On 14 July 1914, the annual summer cruise to Norway began, but the threat of war in Europe cut the excursion short; within two weeks and the rest of II Squadron had returned to Wilhelmshaven.

=== World War I ===
At the outbreak of war in July 1914, was assigned to guard duty in the mouth of the Elbe River while the rest of the fleet mobilized. In late October, she and her sisters were sent to Kiel to have improvements made to their underwater protection system to make them more resistant to torpedoes and mines, after which II Battle Squadron rejoined the fleet. The squadron covered Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group while they bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby on 15–16 December 1914. During the operation, the German battle fleet of some 12 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens convinced the German commander, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet, and so he broke off the engagement and turned the fleet for home. In April 1916, the ship had two of her 8.8 cm guns removed and replaced with 8.8 cm Flak guns.

 then participated in a fleet advance to the Dogger Bank on 21–22 April 1915. On 11–12 September II Reconnaissance Group conducted a minelaying operation off the Swarte Bank with II Squadron in support. This was followed by another sweep by the fleet on 23–24 October that ended without result. II and III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts conducted an advance into the North Sea on 5–7 March 1916; and the rest of II Squadron remained in the German Bight, ready to sail in support. They then rejoined the fleet during the operation to bombard Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24–25 April. During this operation, the battlecruiser was damaged by a British mine and had to return to port prematurely. Visibility was poor, so the operation was quickly called off before the British fleet could intervene.

==== Battle of Jutland ====
The commander of the High Seas Fleet, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, immediately planned another advance into the North Sea, but the damage to delayed the operation until the end of May. As the last ship assigned to IV Division of II Battle Squadron, the rearmost German formation, was the last battleship in the line. II Battle Squadron was commanded by Rear Admiral . During the &quot;Run to the North&quot;, Scheer ordered the fleet to pursue the retreating battleships of the British 5th Battle Squadron at top speed. and her sisters were significantly slower than the dreadnoughts and quickly fell behind. During this period, Admiral Scheer directed to place herself behind so he would have a flagship on either end of the formation. By 19:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene and confronted Admiral Scheer with significant numerical superiority. The German fleet was severely hampered by the presence of the slower -class ships; if Scheer had ordered an immediate turn towards Germany, he would have had to sacrifice the slower ships to make his escape.

Admiral Scheer decided to reverse the course of the fleet with the , a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. Having fallen behind, the ships of II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn, and fell to the disengaged side of the German line. Admiral Mauve considered moving his ships to the rear of the line, astern of III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line. But by the time II Squadron reached its position at the head of the line, Scheer had ordered another , which placed them at the rear of the German fleet. By 21:00, Scheer had turned the fleet around a third time, but the slow speed of and her squadron mates caused them to fall out of position, to the disengaged side of the fleet.

Later on the first day of the battle, Hipper&#x27;s badly damaged battlecruisers were being engaged by their British rivals. and the other so-called &quot;five-minute ships&quot; came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. These ships were very briefly engaged, owing in large part to the poor visibility. The visibility was so bad, the gunners aboard could not make out a target, and she did not fire her main guns. At 21:35 a heavy caliber shell struck the ship on the port-side, punching a hole approximately 40 cm (16 in) wide before exploding against the inner casemate armor. It tore apart of the superstructure deck and disabled one of the port side casemate guns. Three men were killed and nine were wounded. Admiral Mauve halted the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers and ordered an 8-point turn to starboard.

Late on the 31st, the fleet re-formed for the night voyage back to Germany, with towards the rear of the line, ahead of , , and the battlecruisers and . Around 03:00, British destroyers conducted a series of attacks against the fleet, some of which were directed towards . Shortly thereafter, was struck by at least one torpedo from the destroyer ; the hit detonated an ammunition magazine, destroying the ship in a tremendous explosion. During the attack, was forced to turn away to avoid the destroyers&#x27; torpedoes. Shortly after 05:00, and several other ships fired repeatedly at what they falsely believed to be British submarines.

Despite the ferocity of the night fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British destroyer forces and reached Horns Reef by 4:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later, where the undamaged dreadnoughts of the and es took up defensive positions. Over the course of the battle, had fired only twenty 17 cm rounds.

==== Later actions ====
 was put into dock for repairs 10–25 June 1916. The Navy then decided to withdraw the four remaining -class ships, owing to their obsolescence and vulnerability to underwater attacks, as demonstrated by the loss of . Thereafter, the ship was used as a target for U-boats, except during 12–23 February 1917 when she was used as a guard ship. In April was sent to Altenbruch at the mouth of the Elbe; here she was decommissioned on 2 May. was then disarmed and assigned to the 5th U-boat Flotilla to be used as a barracks ship in Bremerhaven. In 1918 the ship was moved to Kiel, where she remained for the rest of the war.

=== Inter-war years ===
Following the German defeat in World War I, the German navy was reorganized as the Reichsmarine according to the Treaty of Versailles. The new navy was permitted to retain eight pre-dreadnought battleships under —two of which would be in reserve—for coastal defense. &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; was among the ships that were retained, along with her sisters &quot;Hannover&quot; and &quot;Schlesien&quot; and several of the &quot;Braunschweig&quot;-class battleships. &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot; was recommissioned as the new fleet flagship on 31 January 1926 following an extensive refit, with new fire controls and an enlarged aft superstructure for the admiral&#x27;s staff. The secondary 17 cm guns were replaced with pieces and four 50 cm torpedo tubes were fitted in main deck casemates fore and aft, replacing the submerged tubes.

 and her sister went on a training cruise into the Atlantic that lasted from 14 May to 17 June 1926; while on the cruise, she visited Palma de Mallorca in the Mediterranean from 22 to 30 May. She stopped in Barcelona with from 1 to 7 June, and then proceeded to Vigo from 12 to 14 June, where she joined , , and . There, the chief of the fleet, Vice Admiral Konrad Mommsen, met with King Alfonso XIII. went on another training cruise between 30 March and 14 June 1927 into the Atlantic. She visited a series of Iberian ports, including Lisbon, Portugal, where Mommsen was greeted by Óscar Carmona, the president of Portugal. In December 1927 went back into dock, re-emerging in January 1928 with her fore funnel trunked back into the second and both remaining funnels heightened, as had previously been done with her sister .

With the delivery of the new (armored ships) beginning in 1933, the older battleships were gradually withdrawn from front-line service. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was reorganized as the Kriegsmarine by the reforms instituted by Adolf Hitler that created the Wehrmacht. ceased to be fleet flagship on 22 September 1935, and was refitted as a cadet training ship during January–March and May–July 1936. The changes included removing her remaining upper deck 15 cm guns and her torpedo tubes, and her two aft boiler rooms were converted to oil-firing models, although the forward boilers remained coal-fired. The ship&#x27;s standard complement was also reduced from 35 officers and 708 enlisted men to 31 officers and 565 sailors. The crew was supplemented by 175 cadets, who were taken on long cruises in and , the latter sailing in October 1936 on a six-month voyage to South America and the Caribbean. The following year, her cruise took her around Africa, and the 1938–1939 cruise went back to South American and Caribbean waters. Gustav Kieseritzky served as the ship&#x27;s commander from June 1938 until April 1939.

In the mid-1930s, Hitler began pursuing an increasingly aggressive foreign policy; in 1936 he re-militarized the Rhineland, and in 1938 completed the of Austria and the annexation of the Sudetenland. He then demanded German control over the city of Danzig, which had become a free city after World War I.

=== World War II ===
Early on 1 September 1939, Germany launched an invasion of Poland. had been positioned in the port of Danzig, moored close to the Polish ammunition depot at Westerplatte under the guise of a ceremonial visit in August. Around 04:47 on 1 September, opened fire with her main battery at the Polish positions on the Westerplatte, and in doing so fired the first shots of World War II. These shots were the signal for ground troops to begin their assault on the installation, though the first German ground attack in the Battle of Westerplatte was repelled shortly thereafter. A second assault began later that morning, again supported by , though it too had failed to break into the installation by around noon.

 was joined on 4 September by the torpedo boats &quot;T196&quot; and . A force of German infantry and army engineers went ashore to take the depot, with heavy fire support from . The Poles managed to hold off the Germans until they were forced to surrender on 7 September at 10:30. Following the Polish surrender, began shelling Polish positions at Hel and Redłowo; these operations lasted until 13 September. Between 25 and 27 September, the old battleship returned to Hel with her sister ; both vessels conducted further bombardments of Polish positions there. On 25 September the was lightly damaged by Polish coastal batteries at Hel.

The German military then turned its attention westward, and in April 1940 invaded Denmark. was assigned to , a part of the naval component for the German invasion force for Denmark. Along with the torpedo boat and several auxiliary ships, her objective was to support the capture of Korsør and Nyborg. During the invasion, the ship was briefly grounded in the Great Belt, west of Agersø. Following the operation, she was transferred back to training duties, as the flagship of the Chief of Training Units. At the end of 1943, the reactivation of was once again contemplated. In her favor was the fact that she retained some coal-fired boilers, given the ever-worsening oil-supply situation. Thus, on 1 February 1944 she was once again recommissioned, at first taking up her old role as a cadet training ship, then later in the year docking at Gotenhafen (Gdynia) for a refit. She was to be converted into a convoy escort ship with a greatly enhanced anti-aircraft armament, but after being hit three times by Royal Air Force bombers on 18 December 1944, she eventually foundered in shallow water. As the ship was permanently disabled, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg.

Following the Soviet capture of that city, the remaining crew detonated scuttling charges in the wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–1946 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to Tallinn. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water off the island of Osmussaar in the Gulf of Finland. Last used for target practice around 1966, the remains are now submerged. Her bell was held in the collection of the Military History Museum of the Bundeswehr in Dresden as of 1990.

<doc id="1065817" wikidata="Q2629231" url="?curid=1065817" title="Dale Cooper">
<text>Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Dale Bartholomew Cooper is a fictional character who is the protagonist of the ABC and Showtime television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, and plays a supporting role in the prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. He is portrayed in all his appearances by American actor Kyle MacLachlan.

An idiosyncratic FBI agent, Cooper arrives in Twin Peaks in 1989 to investigate the brutal murder of popular high school student Laura Palmer, and begins to uncover several bizarre mysteries around the town, including some supernatural ones.

== Concept and characteristics ==
Co-creator David Lynch named Cooper in reference to D. B. Cooper, the pseudonym of an unidentified man who hijacked a Boeing 727 aircraft on November 24, 1971.

MacLachlan has stated that he views Cooper as an older version of his character in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), a previous David Lynch collaboration. &quot;I see my character as Jeffrey Beaumont grown up. Instead of being acted upon, he has command on the world.&quot; Lynch has stated Cooper&#x27;s character was developed as &quot;a grown-up Jeffrey Beaumont&quot;.

Cooper displays an array of quirky mannerisms such as giving a &quot;thumbs up&quot; when satisfied, sage-like sayings, and distinctive sense of humor along with his love for a good cherry pie and a &quot;damn fine cup of coffee&quot; which he takes black. One of his most popular habits is recording spoken-word tapes to a mysterious woman called &quot;Diane&quot; into his microcassette recorder that he always carries with him, that often contain everyday observations and thoughts on his current case.

In an interview with Scouting Magazine, Lynch said that Cooper is likely an Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America (which incidentally Lynch also held), and that this is the root of Cooper&#x27;s courteous yet determined nature and natural leadership skills. In the same interview, Lynch said that Sheriff Harry S. Truman was probably also a scout as a child, yet one that only made it to the rank of Life Scout, Scouting&#x27;s second-highest rank.

==Character biography==
During the second season of &quot;Twin Peaks,&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster&#x27;s Pocket Books division released several official tie-in publications that provide character details not covered in the show itself. Publications relevant to Cooper include &quot;The Autobiography of F.B.I. Special Agent Dale Cooper: My Life, My Tapes&quot;, which was written by Scott Frost, the brother of series co-creator Mark Frost; and &quot;Diane ... The Twin Peaks Tapes of Agent Cooper&quot;, an audiobook voiced by Kyle MacLachlan, which was nominated for a Grammy Award for best spoken-word performance.

===Personal background and prequel film===
Born on April 19, 1954, Dale Cooper grew up in Philadelphia and attended Germantown Friends School and Haverford College. After graduating from college and the FBI Academy, he joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Pittsburgh office, where he met his longtime secretary Diane Evans. His case partner was the older Windom Earle (Kenneth Welsh), who headed the Pittsburgh office. After Earle went insane, Cooper was transferred to the San Francisco office, the FBI counterintelligence unit, and a FBI-DEA drug cartel task force. Eventually, FBI Regional Bureau Chief Gordon Cole (David Lynch) inducted Cooper into his group that investigated the mysterious &quot;Blue Rose&quot; cases, along with Agent Albert Rosenfield (Miguel Ferrer) and Agent Chester Desmond (Chris Isaak).

Cooper is quirky and intellectual, with a profound interest in the mystical, particularly in Tibet and Native American mythology. Three years before the events of the original series, he had a dream about Tibet, which persuaded him that intuition and dreams could help him solve crimes by unconsciously finding patterns and narratives in scattered evidence. Some of his investigative techniques seem illogical and incomprehensible, but at times they appear to work.

Cooper&#x27;s partnership with Windom Earle led to an early trauma in his career. Earle&#x27;s wife, Caroline, was a witness to a federal crime. Earle and Cooper were assigned to protect her, which led to Cooper having an affair with her. However, one night, while in Pittsburgh, Cooper let his guard down, and Earle murdered Caroline in a jealous rage. Earle was subsequently sent to a mental institution. Cooper was devastated by the loss of the woman he would later refer to as the love of his life, and swore to never again get involved with someone who was a part of a case to which he was assigned.

In the prequel film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, Cooper is meeting with Cole when the long-missing Agent Phillip Jeffries (David Bowie) mysteriously appears and disappears in Cole&#x27;s office. Cooper investigates the disappearance of Agent Desmond, who went missing while investigating the murder of Teresa Banks (Pamela Gidley). He finds only the words &quot;Let&#x27;s Rock&quot; written on the windshield of Desmond&#x27;s car. Later, Cooper tells Diane that he suspects Teresa&#x27;s murderer will strike again. He offers Rosenfield a victim profile that fits Laura, but Rosenfield is skeptical of Cooper&#x27;s predictions since they were based on dreams and responds that the profile fits too many people to be useful.

=== Events of the original &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; series ===
At the start of season one, on February 24, 1989, Cooper comes to the town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). Initially, the prime suspect is Laura&#x27;s boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook), but Cooper quickly determines he is innocent. Cooper meets Phillip Gerard (Al Strobel), a shoe salesman who is possessed by a potentially benevolent spirit called MIKE; MIKE tells him that an evil spirit, BOB (Frank Silva), is the key to solving Laura&#x27;s murder. Eventually, Cooper deduces that Laura&#x27;s father, Leland (Ray Wise), murdered her while possessed by BOB. When BOB forces Leland to commit suicide, Cooper helps him transition into the afterlife by reciting a Buddhist prayer for the dead.

Cooper remains in Twin Peaks after solving the Palmer case, as the FBI soon suspends him for conducting police work across the Canadian border without authorization. Sheriff Truman deputizes him so that he can help the local police investigate other cases. While in Twin Peaks, he learns of the mysterious places called the Black Lodge and the White Lodge and the various spirits inhabiting them, including MIKE and The Man From Another Place (Michael J. Anderson). He also resolves to protect the town from Earle, who has become a serial killer and travels to Twin Peaks to confront him.

In the final episode of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Cooper enters the Black Lodge to rescue his new girlfriend, Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), from Earle. In the Black Lodge, he encounters his evil doppelgänger, who is in league with BOB. Earle appears and says he will let Annie go if Cooper gives him his soul. Cooper agrees, and Earle stabs him in the stomach. Seconds later, BOB appears and reverses time in the Lodge. BOB tells Cooper that Earle cannot ask for his soul, and then kills Earle and takes his soul. BOB then turns on Cooper, who flees, pursued by BOB and Cooper&#x27;s doppelgänger. BOB allows Cooper&#x27;s doppelgänger to leave the Black Lodge, while Cooper remains there. In the show&#x27;s final scene, the doppelgänger smashes his head into a mirror and starts laughing hysterically; BOB&#x27;s face looks back at him in the broken mirror.

=== &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; ===
Although &quot;Fire Walk with Me&quot; is primarily a prequel to the TV series and most of Cooper&#x27;s participation in the film involves his pre-&quot;Twin Peaks&quot; self, the post-season two version of Cooper briefly appears in the film. Laura dreams of the Red Room and meets Cooper, who is still trapped in the Black Lodge. Cooper implores her not to take &quot;the ring,&quot; a mysterious object that gives its wearer a sort of connection to the Black Lodge. At the end of the film, however, Laura puts on the ring, which prompts BOB to kill her. At the end of the film, Cooper comforts Laura&#x27;s spirit in the Red Room.

The film also confirms that the version of Dale Cooper who laughs during the final scene of season two is not the real Dale Cooper. Laura has a vision of a bloody Annie Blackburn beside her in her bed, who tells her: &quot;My name is Annie. I&#x27;ve been with Dale and Laura. The good Dale is in the Lodge, and he can&#x27;t leave. Write it in your diary.&quot; The police discover these diary pages 25 years later, in &quot;Twin Peaks: The Return&quot;.

=== 2017 revival ===
Twenty-five years after the events of the original series, Cooper remains trapped in the Black Lodge, while his doppelgänger continues to assume his identity in the natural realm. An older Laura Palmer whispers something in his ear, which cannot be heard.

After traversing a series of surrealist landscapes, Cooper is finally able to return to the natural realm, with help from entities both inside and outside of the Black Lodge, as well as Diane (Laura Dern) in her Naido form. Although it is asserted that Cooper&#x27;s doppelgänger must leave the natural realm for Cooper to reenter, the doppelgänger manages to frustrate the process. Cooper replaces Douglas &quot;Dougie&quot; Jones, a Las Vegas insurance agent who looks like an overweight version of Cooper, instead of his doppelgänger. The doppelgänger appears to believe that once he kills Cooper-as-Dougie, he will be able to stay in the natural realm indefinitely. He frames Dougie for denying a valid $30 million insurance claim filed by two gangsters and orders corrupt businessman Duncan Todd (Patrick Fischler) to have Dougie assassinated.

After reentering the natural realm, Cooper (universally mistaken for Dougie) is left in a near-catatonic state. He cannot perform basic tasks without assistance and rarely speaks besides repeating words other people say. Only slight traces of Cooper&#x27;s personality appear, such as his passion for coffee and cherry pie. Dougie&#x27;s wife Janey-E (Naomi Watts) does not understand the situation, but provides cover stories for Cooper with the police and Dougie&#x27;s boss Bushnell Mullins (Don Murray). 

Although Cooper is essentially helpless on his own, he survives with help from supernatural forces from the Black Lodge, who help him win at slots to pay off Dougie&#x27;s debt to loan sharks and inspire him to unconsciously expose a corrupt insurance agent in Dougie&#x27;s office. Janey-E, who is frustrated by Dougie&#x27;s whoring, gambling, and mounting debts, is pleased to see that Cooper, even in his diminished state, does not actively undermine his own life and is in much better physical shape than before. She does not question the change and grows more attracted to the man she thinks is Dougie. When the doppelgänger frames Dougie for the insurance fraud, Rodney and Bradley Mitchum (Robert Knepper and James Belushi), the gangsters who filed the valid insurance claim, plan to murder Cooper. However, the Black Lodge sends Bradley Mitchum a dream saying that Cooper is innocent. After Cooper pays the insurance claim, the Mitchums become fast friends with Cooper&#x27;s family. In addition, a man ordered by Todd to assassinate Cooper cracks and cannot bring himself to commit the crime.

Cooper eventually starts to come out of his near-catatonic state after hearing Gordon Cole&#x27;s name spoken while watching the film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. (Lynch named the Gordon Cole character in the series after the character in the film.) Hearing the name prompts Cooper to stick a fork into an electrical socket, electrocuting himself. Although the shock puts him in a coma, he awakens with his senses and memories intact. The Mitchum brothers fly him back to Twin Peaks.

Although Cooper&#x27;s doppelgänger arrives at the Twin Peaks sheriff&#x27;s station before Cooper himself, Lucy Brennan (Kimmy Robertson) detects and shoots the doppelgänger. BOB emerges from the doppelgänger&#x27;s body and tries to terrorize the other characters, but James Hurley&#x27;s friend Freddie Skyes (Jake Wardle) kills BOB with a powerful weapon provided by the supernatural entities. Cooper returns his doppelgänger&#x27;s spirit to the Black Lodge. Naido, who was transported to the natural realm through a strange portal in the woods and taken to the sheriff&#x27;s station for protection, transforms back into Diane.

With BOB and the doppelgänger defeated, Cooper visits Phillip Jeffries (Nathan Frizzell), who sends him to the night of Laura Palmer&#x27;s death and warns of a malevolent spirit named JUDY. Cooper prevents Laura&#x27;s murder, but while leading Laura away from the murder site, she suddenly disappears.

Using information given to Cooper by the Fireman, Cooper and Diane travel to Odessa, Texas in search of Laura. They break through a kind of portal, after which Cooper appears colder, like a mixture between his regular personality and his doppelgänger. Diane is terrified after seeing a woman who may be her own doppelgänger. Cooper and Diane make love in a motel, during which Diane grows increasingly disturbed. When Cooper wakes up the next morning, Diane is gone; the motel is different; and a &quot;Linda&quot; has left &quot;Richard&quot; a note telling him that their relationship is over. The Fireman had previously told Cooper to watch for Linda and Richard.

After investigating a lead at the &quot;Eat at Judy&#x27;s&quot; diner in Odessa, Cooper finds a woman who resembles an older Laura, but identifies herself as Carrie Page (Lee). Carrie does not know a Laura Palmer but recognizes the names of Laura&#x27;s parents, which convinces Cooper that she is Laura. Cooper convinces Carrie, who needs to flee Odessa anyway, to travel to Twin Peaks to reunite with Sarah Palmer. Upon arriving at the Palmer house, however, Cooper discovers that the house has been occupied by two different families for many years; the families&#x27; names are familiar but mysterious. As Cooper asks what year he is in, Carrie hears Sarah calling for Laura. Carrie screams and the lights in the house go out.

The series ends with an image of Laura whispering in Cooper&#x27;s ear in the Red Room, a flashback to the season opener. Unlike the original series, however, Laura&#x27;s message is not revealed.

==Relationships==

=== Town of Twin Peaks ===
Upon his arrival in Twin Peaks, Cooper is enchanted with the place and forms an instant rapport with many of the townspeople - most particularly Sheriff Harry S. Truman and his deputies, Deputy Tommy &quot;Hawk&quot; Hill and Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz). While Truman is initially skeptical of Cooper&#x27;s unconventional investigation methods and other-worldly ideas, he is most often willing to accept Cooper&#x27;s judgment. Over time, a deep bond emerges between the two; Truman even deputizes Cooper during the latter&#x27;s brief suspension from the FBI.

On arrival to Twin Peaks, Cooper becomes quickly aware that 18-year-old Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn), the daughter of local businessman Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer), has a crush on him. Cooper is clearly attracted to Audrey, but he is quick to rebuff her advances when she turns up in his hotel bed. Cooper explains she is too young, but he does genuinely want to be her friend. Following her rescue, there remains a close and affectionate friendship with the two, most notably when Audrey arrives to his hotel room for comfort following her father&#x27;s arrest and her sad farewell when she believes Cooper is leaving Twin Peaks for good. Audrey later gives Cooper a kiss when she discovers evidence that clears him of drug charges, and they later dance at the Milford wedding.

Following his reinstatement to the FBI, Cooper meets Annie Blackburn, the sister of Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton), and falls in love with her. Annie is established as being a kindred spirit, experiencing the world with curiosity and wonder. Much like Cooper&#x27;s pain over Caroline Earle, Annie also nurses a broken heart from someone in her past. Cooper helps her to prepare for participation in the Miss Twin Peaks contest. However, during the contest she is kidnapped by Earle, who takes her to the Black Lodge and uses her fear to open the gateway.

=== FBI ===
Cooper is a good friend of Agent Albert Rosenfield, an abrasive and sarcastic scientific expert whose help Cooper frequently enlists for complicated autopsies and other scientific questions. Though he has strong respect and admiration for Rosenfield&#x27;s medical skills, he is alarmed by Rosenfield&#x27;s growing animosity towards Sheriff Truman and the other town citizens, as Rosenfield has a low opinion of local policemen and small cities. He encourages Rosenfield to treat other people with respect and Sheriff Truman to not get too offended by Rosenfield&#x27;s brusque manner. He eventually helps Rosenfield and Truman develop mutual respect for each other. Cooper also maintains good relations with his boss Gordon Cole and former FBI coworker Denise Bryson, both of whom help Cooper at critical junctures in the series.

Prior to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Cooper&#x27;s strongest romantic relationship was his affair with Caroline Earle, the wife of his former investigative partner, Windom Earle. Caroline had been under Cooper and Earle&#x27;s protection for witnessing a federal crime Earle committed when he lost his mind, but on one night when Cooper&#x27;s guard was down, Caroline was murdered by Windom. Caroline&#x27;s death and his failure to protect her continues to haunt Cooper on his arrival to Twin Peaks, referring to a &quot;broken heart&quot; when discussing women with Truman and his deputies.

== &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance ==

In 1990, at the height of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;″ popularity, MacLachlan hosted the season opener of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The episode frequently referenced the series. In MacLachlan&#x27;s opening monologue, he pretends to spoil the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer (&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s Shelly the Waitress&quot;). David Lynch calls him on set to berate him, after which an embarrassed MacLachlan unconvincingly attempts to walk back his claim.

One sketch explicitly parodies the show, with MacLachlan reprising his performance as Dale Cooper. The basic joke of the sketch is that MacLachlan has fallen in love with the town of Twin Peaks and will come up with any excuse he can to prolong the investigation and avoid going back to Philadelphia. Although Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Kevin Nealon) informs Cooper that Leo Johnson (Chris Farley) has confessed to the murder of Laura Palmer and that he can go home, Cooper remains in denial about Johnson&#x27;s guilt, attributing his skepticism to a dream he had the night before in which &quot;a hairless mouse with a pitchfork sang a song about caves.&quot; The Cooper sketch accentuates some of the quirkier aspects of Cooper&#x27;s personality, including his tendency to ramble when recording messages for Diane and his unusual attention to detail, including the precise number of hairs he found in his shower the night before.

Cooper grows distressed when several town residents, played by &quot;SNL&quot; cast members, visit him to say goodbye. Audrey Horne (Victoria Jackson) gives Cooper a going away gift and ties the ribbon with her tongue, parodying a scene from the show. Leland Palmer (Phil Hartman) asks Cooper to dance with him. Nadine Hurley (Jan Hooks) asks Cooper to take her silent drape runners to the patent office. After Sheriff Truman observes that two women have already appeared and &quot;SNL&quot; has only two female cast members, The Log Lady (also played by Hooks) shows up. Seeking to delay his departure, Cooper asks Truman to perform several pointless and esoteric investigative tasks, including going to a graveyard at midnight disguised as altar boys.

As everyone begins to leave, Cooper declares that he cannot leave because he still does not know who shot him at the end of Season One. However, Deputy Andy Brennan (Conan O&#x27;Brien) drags Leo Johnson to meet Cooper. Leo confesses to shooting Cooper and reminds him that Cooper watched him do it. Cooper reluctantly goes to sleep as The Man from Another Place (Mike Myers) begins to dance at the foot of his bed.

<text>Terminal (Terminal.app) is the terminal emulator included in the macOS operating system by Apple. Terminal originated in NeXTSTEP and OPENSTEP, the predecessor operating systems of macOS.

As a terminal emulator, the application provides text-based access to the operating system, in contrast to the mostly graphical nature of the user experience of macOS, by providing a command-line interface to the operating system when used in conjunction with a Unix shell, such as zsh (the default interactive shell since macOS Catalina). The user can choose other shells available with macOS, such as the KornShell, tcsh, and bash.

The preferences dialog for Terminal.app in OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and later offers choices for values of the TERM environment variable. Available options are &quot;ansi&quot;, &quot;dtterm&quot;, &quot;nsterm&quot;, &quot;rxvt&quot;, &quot;vt52&quot;, &quot;vt100&quot;, &quot;vt102&quot;, &quot;xterm&quot;, &quot;xterm-16color&quot; and &quot;xterm-256color&quot;, which differ from the OS X 10.5 (Leopard) choices by dropping the &quot;xterm-color&quot; and adding &quot;xterm-16color&quot; and &quot;xterm-256color&quot;. These settings do not alter the operation of Terminal, and the xterm settings do not match the behavior of xterm.

Terminal includes several features that specifically access macOS APIs and features. These include the ability to use the standard macOS Help search function to find manual pages and integration with Spotlight. Terminal was used by Apple as a showcase for macOS graphics APIs in early advertising of Mac OS X, offering a range of custom font and coloring options, including transparent backgrounds.

<text>Kočevje (; ; &quot;Göttscheab&quot; or &quot;Gətscheab&quot; in the local Gottscheerish dialect; ) is a town and the seat of Municipality of Kočevje in southern Slovenia.

== Geography ==

The town is located at the foot of the Kočevski Rog karst plateau on the Rinža River in the historic Lower Carniola region. It is now part of the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region. The Rinža River flows through the town. Lake Kočejve, a former open-pit coal mine, lies northeast of the town center.

== Climate ==
Kočevje features a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Cfb&quot;).

== Name ==
Kočevje was attested in written sources in 1363 as &quot;Gotsche&quot; (and as &quot;Gotsew&quot; in 1386, &quot;Kotsche&quot; in 1425, and &quot;propre Koczeuiam&quot; in 1478). The name is derived from &quot;*Hvojčevje&quot; (from &quot;hvoja&quot; &#x27;fir, spruce&#x27;), referring to the local vegetation. The initial &quot;hv-&quot; changed to &quot;k-&quot; under the influence of German phonology. Older discredited explanations include derivation from the hypothetical common noun &quot;*kočevje&quot; &#x27;nomadic settlement&#x27; and Slovene &quot;koča&quot; &#x27;shack&#x27;. The former German name was &quot;Gottschee&quot;.

== History ==
In 1247 Berthold, Patriarch of Aquileia, granted the area around Ribnica within the imperial March of Carniola to the Carinthian counts of Ortenburg. When the counts had received further estates in 1336 on the wooded plateau down to Kostel on the Kolpa River from the hands of Patriarch Bertram, they called for German-speaking settlers from Carinthia and Tyrol. In the following decades they established the town of Gottschee, which was first mentioned in a 1363 deed. The settlement received market rights in 1377 and town privileges in 1471.

Until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian Empire (and part of Cisleithania after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867), in the district of the same name, as one of the 11 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in province of Carniola. The German name alone was used by the post office before 1867.

After the Second World War, a Yugoslav labor camp for political prisoners operated in Kočevje until March 1946.

===Germans of Kočevje===

They first settled in Carniola around 1330 from the German lands of Tyrol and Carinthia and maintained their German identity and language during their 600 years of isolation. They cleared the vast forests of the region and established villages and towns. In 1809, they resisted French occupation in the 1809 Gottscheer Rebellion. With the end of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, Gottschee became a part of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Gottscheer thus went from being part of the ruling ethnicity of Austria-Hungary (and the ruling group in the estates of the province of Carniola itself) to an ethnic minority in a large Slavic state. With the onset of the Second World War and the Invasion of Yugoslavia their situation was worsened further.

== Landmarks ==

The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Bartholomew () and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novo Mesto. It is a Neo-Romanesque building erected between 1887 and 1903 on the site of an earlier church.

== Notable people ==
Notable people that were born or lived in Kočevje include:
* (1931–2011), sculptor, graphic artist and teacher (worked in Kočevje)
* Matej Bor (1913–1993), poet and author

<doc id="1065834" wikidata="Q2708262" url="?curid=1065834" title="Jack Skellington">
<text>Jack Skellington is the protagonist of the 1993 film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. He is a skeleton who is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, a fantasy world based solely on the eponymous holiday. Jack is voiced by Chris Sarandon. Danny Elfman provided Jack&#x27;s singing voice in the original film and soundtrack album, with Sarandon providing Jack&#x27;s speaking and singing voice in subsequent productions.

His overall appearance is a skeleton dressed in a black pin-striped suit and a bow tie that strongly resembles a bat. Originally, his suit was meant to be completely black, but it blended with the background too well, so it was changed. At the beginning of the film, Jack makes his grand entrance by emerging out of the fountain in Halloween Town&#x27;s plaza. His last name is a play on the word &quot;skeleton&quot;. He has a ghost dog named Zero for a pet, who has a small jack-o&#x27;-lantern for a nose. He is adored by Sally, a feminine creation of Doctor Finkelstein. Outside of the film, Jack has appeared in video games such as the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series. Various merchandise has also been produced based on the character.

==In &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;==

Jack Skellington is the undead patron spirit of Halloween, portrayed as being on par with Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny within his own holiday. As a living skeleton, he is supernatural and can remove parts of his body without harm, as is often demonstrated for comic relief. He is the most important of many Halloween spirits, with the implication that their job is to scare people in the real world on Halloween night.

Jack, as the &quot;Pumpkin King&quot; and master of ceremonies, is in charge of Halloweeen Town (film)&#x27;s Halloween celebration. He is loved, respected, and even idolized by the other residents for his role, but he has grown weary of celebrating the same holiday endlessly and is depressed about it. The only one who understands Jack&#x27;s feelings is a lonely ragdoll named Sally. She overhears his singing monologue and feels she can relate to his situation.

One morning after the usual annual celebration, Jack enters a forest containing portals to other worlds themed around holidays. He discovers Christmas Town and decides that this new experience is what his life was missing. He makes preparations for his own Christmas celebration in Halloween Town and wants to impersonate Santa Claus in the real world. While his intentions are not malicious, Jack does not understand the true spirit of Christmas. Halloween Town plans to give the holiday a macabre makeover. Sally reveals to Jack a bad premonition, but Jack&#x27;s basic nature is impulsiveness. He does not seem to register contradictory information. By the end of the film, he notices Sally and her determination to help him. He proves that love can be a part of his nature by calling Sally his &quot;Dearest Friend&quot;, telling Sally that they were meant to be together, embracing his future with her and embracing her.

Jack follows the formula of a tragic hero because he begins the story at a lofty position. In spite of all his fame and talent, he yearns for another side of life. While a desire for completeness is not a flaw, his impulsiveness proves to be. He tends to be enthusiastic and inclusive, and his charisma is enough to sway every member of Halloween Town except Sally. His selfish decisions lead to the near destruction of Christmas and himself. The strength of Jack&#x27;s character is demonstrated by his will to correct his own mistakes.

The official film soundtrack CD contains an epilogue not in the film, stating that &quot;many years later&quot;, Santa returned to Halloween Town to visit Jack, where he discovered that Jack had &quot;four or five skeleton children at hand&quot; who play together in a xylophone band.

===&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas: The Pumpkin King&quot;===

Jack Skellington has been shown to have an extreme hatred for Oogie Boogie as was proven when he spoke of this plan to Lock, Shock, and Barrel, stating to &quot;leave that no account Oogie Boogie out of this!&quot; He later finds out that Santa Claus and Sally have been kidnapped by the Boogie Man and are in his underground lair. While trying to save his friends, Jack manages to destroy Oogie and save Christmas.

===&quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie&#x27;s Revenge&quot;===

Tired of using the same old themes over and over on Halloween, Jack Skellington goes to Doctor Finkelstein, who gives him the Soul Robber, a slimy green creature that changes shape. Jack decided to leave Halloween Town to get new ideas for Halloween frights. When Jack comes back to town, he finds that Oogie Boogie has been resurrected. Now Jack has to set things right again. Jack dances, fights and sings in this game to attack Oogie Boogie&#x27;s minions. Jack is portrayed as inept to some degree in this game.

Chris Sarandon did both the speaking and singing voice for Jack in this game.

===&quot;Disney Universe&quot;===

Jack Skellington features in the Nightmare Before Christmas downloadable expansion pack which includes Jack Skellington, Sally, Oogie-Boogie, Dr. Finkelstein, and the Mayor as in-game playable costumes. The downloadable content can be bought from console stores (e.g. the PlayStation Store). The package included the costumes of which some could be found in the downloaded level. Unlike the worlds originally in the game which all had 3 chapters, the Nightmare Before Christmas world only had 1 chapter called &#x27;Halloween Graveyard&#x27;.

===&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series===

Jack Skellington appears in four installments of the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series. He inhabits the world of Halloween Town, where the evil Heartless threatens its denizens. The games&#x27; protagonists, Sora, Donald Duck and Goofy, befriend Jack and together they battle the Heartless, and also Oogie Boogie. In combat, Jack uses some of his scary powers with demonstrations of some magic, making him a formidable sorcerer.

Chris Sarandon reprises his role for the English version, and Masachika Ichimura provides Jack&#x27;s Japanese voice.

====&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;====

Jack Skellington introduces himself to Sora, Goofy, and Donald Duck as the ruler of Halloween Town. Jack plans to use the heart that Finkelstein created to control the seemingly docile Heartless to make a festival called &quot;Heartless Halloween&quot; so that Halloween can be frightening, but the idea fails when not only the first experiment cause the Heartless to go berserk, but Oogie Boogie steals the finished heart, and plans to use it to take over Halloween Town. At Oogie&#x27;s manor, Jack, Sora, and the gang confront him. After Oogie is defeated, Jack finds out that Oogie uses dark orbs as his source of life, which Oogie combines himself with his manor to become a giant boss. Once the gang defeats Oogie once again, and his manor crumbles, revealing Halloween Town&#x27;s keyhole. Jack is considerably shorter in this game than as he appeared in the movie, though he is still rather tall when compared to the game&#x27;s protagonists.

====&quot;Chain of Memories&quot;====

&quot;Created&quot; from Sora&#x27;s memories of Halloween Town, when Jack Skellington wanted to ask Doctor Finkelstein what happened when he sniffs the potion that can bring &quot;true memories&quot;, Heartless appeared. When Jack Skellington had found out that Oogie Boogie had stolen Doc&#x27;s potion, he must stop him before Oogie drinks the whole potion. They fail to reach him before he does, but they defeat him, as Oogie becomes overwhelmed with fear as a side effect of the potion. Sora becomes worried about what will happen when he discovers his true memories, but Jack reassures him that fear is a sign of a strong heart.

====&quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;====

In this game, Roxas arrives at Halloween Town while Jack is in the middle of brainstorming for Halloween. Jack is having trouble with thinking of things but gets inspiration when he sees Roxas leaving through a Dark Corridor. Time after time, Roxas&#x27; adventures through Halloween Town inspire Jack to create such things as balloons filled with spiders, exploding frost pumpkins, and Halloween lanterns. When Roxas is sent to find the source of a terrible drop in heartless population, he finds the town overrun with monsters called Tentaclaws. After seeing Roxas defeating the source of the Tentaclaws, the cannibalistic Leechgrave, Jack invents a terrifying scarecrowish version of Roxas as his centerpiece for that Halloween.

====&quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;====

Following the film loosely to some degree, out of reference, Jack tries to take Santa Claus&#x27;s place again. To that end, Jack asks Sora and the gang to help him be Santa&#x27;s bodyguards. But after fighting the Heartless and Oogie Boogie, who has been resurrected by Maleficent, Santa explains to Jack that they each have a job to do with their respective holidays. Despite this, he begins to wear a Santa suit Sally sewed together for him. In the second trip to Halloween Town, Jack still wears the Santa suit, as he still longs to deliver Christmas presents and feels that it would be rude not to wear the suit Sally worked so hard on. Along with Sora and the gang, he helps defeat Doctor Finkelstein&#x27;s experiment, who stole Christmas presents from Santa in search of a heart. As a reward for all his hard work and assistance, Santa brings Jack on a ride-along with him in his sleigh for a while. After Santa drops Jack off at Halloween Town, Jack learns the true meaning of Christmas by understanding the act of giving. He dances with Sally in the end, finally realizing all of the gifts she had given to him were all from the heart and wishes to give her something in return. She tells him that the nicest present she could ever ask for is just to be with Jack. Jack responds telling her that she does not even have to ask for that, meaning Jack feels the same way for her. During a cut scene in the end credits, he is shown to be wearing his original suit, suggesting he has taken Santa&#x27;s previous advice to heart completely, and apparently begins presenting new ideas for next Halloween.

<text>Nikolaus “Nik” Welter (2 January 1871 – 13 July 1951) was a Luxembourgish writer, playwright, poet, professor, literary critic (Germanic and Romance languages), and statesman. He wrote predominantly in German. He also served as a Minister for Education in the government of Émile Reuter.

After his university studies in Leuven, Paris, Bonn and Berlin, he became a teacher in Diekirch (1897-1906) and later at the Athénée de Luxembourg in Luxembourg City (1906-1918).

Welter mainly wrote plays and poetry. His work &quot;Griselinde&quot; (1901) inspired the Luxembourgish composer Alfred Kowalsky to write the opera of the same name. Other well-known works are &quot;Die Söhne des Öslings&quot;, &quot;Goethes Husar&quot;, &quot;Der Abtrünnige&quot;, &quot;Professor Forster&quot; and &quot;Lene Frank&quot;.

From early on, Nik Welter was involved with the &quot;Félibrige&quot;, a poets&#x27; movement in the Provence, and was in contact with the members of the &quot;Felibertum félibrige&quot;: Frédéric Mistral, Joseph Roumanille and Théodore Aubanel. He was often at Mistral&#x27;s house in Bouches-du-Rhône and was taken up into the circle of the Féliber. In the same way, he also met German Romanists such as Eduard Koschwitz and August Bertuch. Along with the two German Romanists, he campaigned successfully for Frédéric Mistral to be awarded the 1904 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Nik Welter recorded his travels in the Provence and in Tunisia in the book &quot;Hohe Sonnentage&quot;. In his book &quot;Im Werden und Wachsen&quot;, he wrote about his childhood in Mersch. He was the author of the first Luxembourgish schoolbook &quot;Das Luxemburgische und sein Schrifttum&quot;.

==Life==
Welter studied at the Universities of Leuven, Paris, Bonn and Berlin . He then went to the teaching profession and was teacher in Diekirch and later at the Athénée de Luxembourg. During the government of Émile Reuter, Welter was the Minister of Education from 1918-1921. He belonged to no party. As author Welter wrote plays and poetry, as well as commissioned works such as 1909&#x27;s &quot;history of French literature&quot; on behalf of the University of Marburg .

==Work==
Welter wrote almost exclusively in the German language. His drama &quot;Griselinde&quot; (1901) served the Luxembourg composer Alfred Kowalsky as libretto for his opera of the same name. Around the turn of the century, Welter&#x27;s interest was in themes from Luxembourgish mythology and history, but also especially literature in the French minority language &quot;langue d&#x27;oc&quot; (Provencal), which had been reinvigorated by the Félibrige school. He corresponded with famous German Romanist as Eduard Koschwitz and August Bertuch and traveled twice to Maillane ( Bouches-du-Rhône) to Frédéric Mistral (Mistral Frederi), the &quot;chef de file&quot; of this movement. As one of the German Romanists, he was not indifferent to the efforts that the award of the 1904 Nobel Prize in Literature led to Mistral. In reported Welter in his travelogue &quot;Hohesonne days. A holiday book from Provence and Tunisia &quot;(1912).

<text>BBC Reporting Scotland is the BBC&#x27;s national television news programme for Scotland, broadcast on BBC One Scotland from the headquarters of BBC Scotland in Pacific Quay, Glasgow. The programme usually followed after the nationwide bulletin from New Broadcasting House.

==History==
Although BBC Television was established in Scotland in February 1952 – and broadcast some opt-out programming – it did not start its daily Scottish television news service until Friday 30 August 1957, initially consisting of a five-minute bulletin at 6.05pm on weekdays and a sports results programme on Saturdays. The BBC was keen to launch the &quot;Scottish News Summary&quot; ahead of its new commercial rival in the central belt, Scottish Television (STV) and before the launch of similar bulletins elsewhere in the UK. As it turned out, STV began broadcasting the day after the launch of what was the BBC&#x27;s first opt-out TV news bulletin, with the commercial rival launching its local bulletins the following Monday. Similar five-minute bulletins were introduced to the rest of the UK the following month. Topical magazine programmes were later introduced to supplement the Scottish news bulletins including &quot;Six Ten&quot;, &quot;Scotland at Six&quot;, &quot;A Quick Look Round&quot;, and a weekly regional opt-out programme for the North of Scotland entitled &quot;Talk of the North&quot;.

Following the arrival of future director-general Alasdair Milne as controller of BBC Scotland, &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; was launched on Monday 1 April 1968 with a greater emphasis on hard news coverage. Inspired by the format of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; in the United States, the programme was presented jointly from the BBC&#x27;s studios in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen.

The original team of presenters were former &quot;A Quick Look Round&quot; presenter Mary Marquis (Glasgow), news agency journalist Gordon Smith (Edinburgh) and ex-Grampian Television announcer Douglas Kynoch (Aberdeen). Kynoch later became the main anchor in Glasgow while future &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; host Donny MacLeod took over as the Aberdeen presenter. In Edinburgh, later presenters included Renton Laidlaw (later a veteran golf commentator) and Kenneth Roy.

In September 1969, &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; was integrated into the networked &quot;Nationwide&quot; strand. As with their counterparts in the other BBC Nations and Regions, &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; team often contributed reports to the &quot;Nationwide&quot; programme. When &quot;Nationwide&quot; ended in August 1983, &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; was briefly replaced by &quot;Scotland Sixty Minutes&quot; as part of the revamped news programme, &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot;, but was reinstated in 1984 after &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; ended. Since that time, the &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; brand has also been used as the on-screen identity for most of BBC Scotland&#x27;s television news bulletins.

Arguably the most famous of &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot;&#x27;s ex-presenters was Mary Marquis, who upon her return in September 1975, became its main anchor until her departure in 1988. Regular co-presenters included John Milne - who remained with the BBC for many years - Malcolm Wilson, Viv Lumsden, Alan Douglas and Eddie Mair.

Jackie Bird became the programme&#x27;s longest serving presenter, anchoring the main 6.30pm edition of &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot; for nearly thirty years until her sudden departure in April 2019. Long-serving BBC Scotland sports commentator Archie Macpherson also established the programme&#x27;s weekend sports previews on Friday nights.

In-depth weather forecasts were introduced as part of a major relaunch of the programme in October 1992, initially fronted by Vanessa Collingridge, and later, the popular Heather Reid (aka &quot;Heather the Weather&quot;) who stayed with &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot; for fifteen years. The programme also increased its use of live outside broadcasts and satellite links for news reports and interviews.

The viewing figures for the main 6.30pm programme averaged between 500,000 and 600,000 and have occasionally reached a million, including the night after the Lockerbie disaster in December 1988. In March 1996, part of the programme was shown on BBC1 across the UK following the Dunblane massacre. Occasional special editions, marking major news events, have also aired on the BBC News Channel and BBC Parliament.

BBC Scotland moved to BBC Pacific Quay in 2007. &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;″s first transmission from the new studios was a breakfast bulletin presented by Rob Matheson, transmitted at 6.25am on Monday 20 August 2007. The studio backdrop features the live view from cameras mounted on the roof of BBC Scotland&#x27;s new headquarters on the southern banks of the Clyde. When it opened, the new building at Pacific Quay was one of the most up-to-date digital broadcasting facilities in the world and featured the BBC&#x27;s first HD-capable newsroom. Since 4 October 1999, the programme&#x27;s on-air titles and graphics have reflected the corporate branding of BBC News, including the signature theme tune composed by David Lowe.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; used extracts from both commercial chart songs and library music for signature tunes, such as the Donna Summer cover of &quot;MacArthur Park&quot;, Jeff Wayne&#x27;s &quot;Jubilation&quot; (also used by LWT&#x27;s &quot;The Big Match&quot;) and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s version of &quot;Fanfare for the Common Man&quot;.

&quot;Reporting Scotland&quot;″s on-air look was most recently updated when a new revamped set was built in Studio C at BBC Scotland&#x27;s Pacific Quay studios, reflecting the new look of the BBC&#x27;s News at One, Six and Ten. It was first seen on screen on 12 June 2023. 

Between 2019 and 2024, &quot;BBC Reporting Scotland&quot; had been supplemented by a sister hour-long programme, &quot;The Nine&quot;, which aired each weeknight on the BBC Scotland channel. While &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot; continued to cover Scottish news, &quot;The Nine&quot;″s brief also included UK national and international news coverage from a Scottish perspective. The programme has been compared with the frequent calls to replace &quot;Reporting Scotland&quot; with a &#x27;Scottish Six&#x27; version of the &quot;BBC News at Six&quot;. 

On 9 December 2024, BBC News Scotland announced two new titles which will join its news and current affairs portfolio from the New Year. Launched on 6 January 2025 was &quot;Reporting Scotland: News at Seven&quot;, the new-look 30 minute week-night news programme for the BBC Scotland channel replacing &quot;The Nine&quot;. It is presented by Laura Maciver and Amy Irons - sharing days throughout the week, while Martin Geissler fronts a new current affairs podcast series &quot;Scotcast&quot; in which began a week later on 13 January.

On 30 January 2025, BBC Scotland announced that Sally Magnusson is to leave the programme after 27 years. She will continue to present until April and then work with the BBC as a freelance broadcaster.

==Broadcasting==

On weekdays, the programme airs nine times a day on BBC One Scotland:
*Breakfast bulletins at 0625, 0655, 0725, 0755, 0825 and 0915 during &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot;
*A 10-minute lunchtime programme at 1.35pm, during the &quot;BBC News at One&quot;

*A 30-minute &quot;&#x27;News at Seven&quot;&#x27; programme at 7pm on the BBC Scotland channel
*A 10-minute late night bulletin at around 10.30pm, after the &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot;
There are three weekend bulletins (one bulletin on a Saturday and two bulletins on a Sunday) 

A mid-afternoon news summary used to be broadcast at around 4pm after the &quot;BBC News Summary&quot; on BBC Two Scotland from 1986 until 2003, when the bulletins moved to BBC One Scotland, but this was discontinued at the end of 2012.

Starting in December 2007, a short headline update was aired at 8pm during the &quot;BBC News Summary&quot;, but this was axed along with the national news summary in May 2018.

Along with other BBC Scotland news and current affairs programming, it can be viewed as a live or on-demand (in full or as individual articles) video stream from the online BBC iPlayer.

The programme can also be watched in any part of the UK (and much of Europe) via the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service transmitted from the Astra satellite at 28.2° east:-

<doc id="1065847" wikidata="Q5302426" url="?curid=1065847" title="Dovedale">
<text>Dovedale is a valley in the Peak District of England. The land is owned by the National Trust and attracts a million visitors annually. The valley was cut by the River Dove and runs for just over between Milldale in the north and a wooded ravine, near Thorpe Cloud and Bunster Hill, in the south. In the wooded ravine, a set of stepping stones cross the river and there are two caves known as the &quot;Dove Holes&quot;.

Dovedale&#x27;s other attractions include rock pillars such as &quot;Ilam Rock&quot;, &quot;Viator&#x27;s Bridge&quot; and the limestone features &quot;Lovers&#x27; Leap&quot; and &quot;Reynard&#x27;s Cave&quot;.

==Geology==
The limestone rock that forms the geology of Dovedale is the fossilised remains of sea creatures that lived in a shallow sea over the area during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago. During the two ice ages, the limestone rock (known as reef limestone) was cut into craggy shapes by glacial meltwater, and dry caves such as Dove Holes and Reynard&#x27;s Kitchen Cave were eventually formed.
==History==
The caves were used as shelters by hunters around 13,000 BCE, and Dovedale has seen continuous human activity since. Around 4,500 years ago Neolithic farmers used the caves as tombs. There is evidence from Reynard&#x27;s Cave of Bronze Age activity, and artifacts found there are displayed at Buxton Museum and Art Gallery.

Vikings settled in the area around 800 CE. Local place names such as Thorpe are of Scandinavian origin. These settlements became permanent, and Thorpe is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.

Viator&#x27;s Bridge, a packhorse bridge in Milldale has been in use since the medieval period when silks and flax were transported from nearby Wetton and Alstonefield.

Tourism started in the 18th century, and Dovedale is now one of the most visited natural tourist sites in Britain.

In July 2014 it was announced that a hoard of Late Iron Age and Roman coins has been discovered in Reynard&#x27;s Kitchen Cave. The 26 coins discovered, which have been declared as &quot;treasure&quot;, included three Roman coins from before the Roman invasion of Britain, and gold and silver pieces of Late Iron Age date, which are believed to have come from the Corieltavi, a Celtic tribe based in the East Midlands. National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said: &quot;The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them.&quot; The coins were scheduled to go on display at Buxton Museum in late 2014.

==River Dove ==

The River Dove is a famous trout stream, 45 miles in length. Charles Cotton&#x27;s Fishing House, the inspiration for Izaak Walton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, stands in the woods by the river. From Hartington to its confluence with the River Manifold at Ilam the River Dove flows through the scenic limestone valley known as Dove Valley, or Dovedale. From Hartington south to Ilam, a distance of eight miles (13 km), the Dove flows through Beresford Dale, Wolfscote Dale, Milldale, and then Dovedale.

==National Trust==

Much of the dale is in the ownership of the National Trust&#x27;s South Peak Estate. Dovedale was acquired in 1934, with successive properties added until 1938, and Wolfscote Dale in 1948.

Dovedale became a National Nature Reserve in 2006 in recognition that it is &quot;one of England&#x27;s finest wildlife sites&quot; with diverse plant life and interesting rock formations.
The National Trust became embroiled in controversy in 2010, when in conjunction with Derbyshire County Council it oversaw the renovation of Dovedale&#x27;s iconic stepping stones. It involved topping all but one of the stones with layers of mortar and limestone slabs.

==Thorpe Cloud==
At the southern end of Dovedale, at between the villages of Thorpe and Ilam, stands Thorpe Cloud, , an isolated limestone hill known as a reef knoll. It provides a viewpoint north up the dale and south across the Midlands plain. Its name &quot;cloud&quot; is a derivation of the Old English word &quot;clud&quot; which means &quot;hill&quot;. On the opposite bank, at , is the higher but less isolated Bunster Hill, , which is also a reef knoll. They were acquired by the National Trust in 1934 for the South Peak Estate.

==Milldale==

Milldale is a village of stone cottages at the northern end of Dovedale and the main access point to the dale from the north. A corn mill stood here until the mid-19th century; its stables are now used as an information hut by the National Trust.

===Viator&#x27;s Bridge===

The ancient, narrow packhorse bridge at Milldale originally had no side walls so that horses with panniers could cross the bridge without being impeded. Izaak Walton, who refers to himself as &quot;Viator&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;traveller&quot;, wrote about it in &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;:

From this the bridge acquired the name Viator&#x27;s Bridge.

The bridge has been in use since the medieval period, for packhorses transporting silks and flax from nearby Wetton and Alstonefield. It is listed as an ancient monument.
==Limestone formations==

Dovedale is notable for its numerous limestone formations. The most southerly named formation, Dovedale Castle, is a short distance along the river from the stepping stones at Thorpe Cloud. The limestone promontory called Lover&#x27;s Leap is accessible from a set of steps. The steps were built by Italian prisoners of war captured in the Second World War and are now maintained by the National Trust and the National Park Authority.

At Lover&#x27;s Leap, a young woman who believed her lover had been killed in the Napoleonic Wars threw herself from the promontory. Her skirt caught in the branches of a tree as she fell and saved her life. When she got home, she heard her lover was alive. There are other similar legends about Lover&#x27;s Leap, including one placing the story in World War II.

Opposite Lover&#x27;s Leap is a limestone formation called the Twelve Apostles. The rock spires have been created from hard reef limestone; they protrude from the valley side, and the river has eroded the rock and soil around them. The National Trust clears plant life to ensure the rock formations are visible.

==Natural history==

Dovedale is of special ecological interest for its plant life, particularly the calcareous ash woods, which are considered among the best in England. There are unusual plants such as Solomon&#x27;s seal, lily of the valley, herb-paris and small and large-leaved lime trees. Birds found here include common kingfisher, grey heron and dipper.

==Tourism==
Gentry comprised most of the visitors to Dovedale during the 18th and 19th centuries. From 1899 the Ashbourne-Buxton railway line ran to Thorpe Cloud station, above the village of Thorpe, making Dovedale more widely accessible to walkers and hikers of all social classes. Improvements in road transport facilitated travel to the area as well.

In 1931 Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour government recommended creating a ‘National Park Authority’ to select natural areas for designation as national parks. Dovedale was one of the areas selected, and it was eventually included within the Peak District National Park when it became Britain&#x27;s first National Park in 1951.

In July 1937, Staffordshire County Council converted the Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway into a tarmac path now known as Manifold Way. The Ashbourne-Buxton railway line closed in the mid-1960s and was converted into a track known as Tissington Trail.

In a Peak District National Park survey conducted in 1986/87, more than a fifth of visitors said walking was their main reason for visiting. A footpath count on a Sunday in August 1990 recorded 4,421 walkers on the Staffordshire side of the river and 3,597 on the Derbyshire bank. Riverside paths make the valley accessible to walkers.

==Literary and cultural associations==

Charles Cotton&#x27;s Fishing House, the inspiration for Izaak Walton&#x27;s &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot;, stands in the woods by the River Dove.

Samuel Johnson, Lord Tennyson, John Ruskin and Lord Byron all praised Dovedale&#x27;s scenery. The last wrote of Dovedale to the poet Thomas Moore, &quot;I can assure you there are things in Derbyshire as noble as Greece or Switzerland.&quot;

Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy talk about her travels in Derbyshire, including Dove Dale, after they meet unexpectedly at Pemberley in Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

Dovedale was featured on the 2005 BBC TV programme &quot;Seven Natural Wonders&quot; as one of the wonders of the Midlands. The stepping stones across the river figure prominently in Jorge Grau&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;The Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue&quot;. The area along the river was used in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1996 version and the BBC&#x27;s 2006 version of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, and Dovedale also featured in the 2008 film &quot;The Other Boleyn Girl&quot;. The Ridley Scott film &quot;Robin Hood&quot; also used Dovedale as a location, and it can be clearly seen in several scenes towards the end of the movie.

The Dovedale Dash is an annual cross-country race along the banks of the River Dove, along Dovedale, and between the villages of Ilam and Thorpe. First organised in 1953, the race takes place on the first Sunday of November, although previously it was held on the closest Sunday to Guy Fawkes Night. The race has been cancelled on five occasions, most recently in 1998, 2000 and 2004, as a result of bad weather, and in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1065861" wikidata="Q336368" url="?curid=1065861" title="Drop tank">
<text>In aviation, a drop tank (external tank, wing tank or belly tank) is used to describe auxiliary fuel tanks externally carried by aircraft. A drop tank is expendable and often capable of being jettisoned. External tanks are commonplace on modern military aircraft and occasionally found in civilian ones, although the latter are less likely to be discarded except in an emergency.

==Overview==
The primary disadvantage with drop tanks is that they impose a drag penalty on the aircraft. External fuel tanks will also increase the moment of inertia, thereby reducing roll rates for air maneuvers. Some of the drop tank&#x27;s fuel is used to overcome the added drag and weight of the tank. Drag in this sense varies with the square of the aircraft&#x27;s speed. The use of drop tanks also reduces the number of external hardpoints available for weapons, reduces the weapon-carrying capacity and increases the aircraft&#x27;s radar signature. Usually the fuel in the drop tanks is consumed first, and only when all the fuel in the drop tanks has been used, the fuel selector is switched to the airplane&#x27;s internal tanks. Some modern combat aircraft use conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) instead of or in addition to conventional external fuel tanks. CFTs produce less drag and do not take up external hardpoints but some versions can only be removed on the ground.

==History==


According to Selfridge Field&#x27;s history, drop tanks were first used on 5 March, 1923.

The drop tank was later used during the Spanish Civil War to allow fighter aircraft to carry additional fuel for long-range escort flights without requiring a dramatically larger, heavier, less maneuverable fuselage. 
Mitsubishi A5M, designed by Jiro Horikoshi, began carrying an external underside drop tank to provide fuel for extended range in 1937 and during World War II, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; began using external fuel tanks with the introduction of a light alloy model for the Ju 87R, a long-range version of the &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bomber, in early 1940. The Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter also used this type of drop tank, starting with the Bf 109E-7 variant introduced in August 1940. Fitted also to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the 300-litre tank, available in at least four construction formats — including at least one impregnated paper material, single-use version — and varying only slightly in appearance, became the standard volume for most drop tanks in Luftwaffe service, with a rarely used , fin-stabilized large capacity drop tank used with some marks of the Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighter and other twin-engined &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; combat aircraft.

The first drop tanks were designed to be discarded when empty or in the event of combat or emergency to reduce drag, weight, and to increase maneuverability. Modern external tanks may be retained in combat, to be dropped in an emergency. The Allies commonly used them to allow fighters increased range and patrol time over continental Europe. The RAF used such external fuel tanks in 1942, during the transit of Supermarine Spitfires to Malta. The Imperial Japanese Navy design specification for what came to be the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter included endurance with drop tanks of two hours at full power, or six to eight hours at cruising speed. Drop tanks were commonly used with the Zero, even on combat air patrol (CAP). The Zero entered service in 1940.

American bomber theorists (the so-called Bomber Mafia) wanted to create vast fleets of heavy bombers. They insisted formations of heavy bombers with multiple machine-gun positions would be self-defending, and that long-range escort fighters would be unnecessary, or even impossible to design. They were also concerned that long-range medium bombers might compete for resources. For all these reasons, official policy in the United States held that drop tanks should not be developed or encouraged. In the face of such entrenched attitudes in 1941 airmen such as Benjamin S. Kelsey and Oliver P. Echols worked quietly to get drop tank technology added to American fighters, beginning with the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. It was only with drop tanks supplying of extra fuel per fighter that P-38s could carry out Operation Vengeance, the downing of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s aircraft. (For this mission, each fighter carried one drop tank of approximately , and a larger one of approximately ).

8th Air Force General Ira C. Eaker experimented with British hardened paper drop tanks for the purpose of extending range for his Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, so that they could fly with and defend the strategic bombers for extended periods. But the paper experiments did not satisfy American planners, and Eaker&#x27;s inflexible bomber defense strategy was holding back the fighters, so he was replaced with Major General Jimmy Doolittle who gave escort fighters freedom to engage the enemy far ahead, and implemented metal drop tanks in 1944 for American fighters. External drop tanks turned the Thunderbolt from a short-range interceptor aircraft into a long-range escort and air superiority fighter, enabling it to accompany bombers from the British Isles into Germany and made it possible for heavy bomber formations to undertake daylight raids under escort by North American P-51 Mustangs. The P-38 could also carry two drop tanks for its longest sorties. This teardrop-shaped tank design was long and in diameter at its widest point.

===Paper-based drop tanks===

Faced by wartime metal shortages and a need to extend the range of fighter craft, the British came up with drop tanks made of glue-impregnated kraft paper, which had excellent tolerance characteristics for extreme heat and cold necessary for operation on an aircraft as well as being waterproof.

Since the glue would slowly dissolve from the solvent effects of the fuel (sometimes developing leaks within a few hours of being loaded with fuel) these were strictly a single-use item, used in typically chilly Northern European conditions, filled immediately before takeoff, jettisoned in the event of an aborted mission and only being required for the outbound portion of a flight. Such papier-mâché tanks were assembled from three main components, the nose cone, tail cone and the body, each shaped over wooden forms, the center section created by wrapping layers of the impregnated paper around a cylinder, the end caps hand-laminated with petal-shaped pieces sometimes called gores.

Before final assembly wooden anti-slosh baffles were installed, pipes and fittings were attached and the interiors coated with fuel-resistant lacquer and the three pieces were bonded together in press. Once the tank had cured, it was pressure tested to and passing tanks were given two coats of cellulose dope followed by two coats of aluminium paint. (British paper drop tanks can be distinguished from outwardly similar metal tanks by colour, paper tanks were silver in appearance, while metal tanks were grey.) Some 13,000 papier-mâché tanks were made and used by the RAF, the vast majority during the war, conserving a considerable amount of metal. Very few examples survive due to their expendable nature, low intrinsic value and the fact that they are not inherently robust. While probably a nuisance for those under the flight path when the empty tanks were released, they were lightweight and comparatively fragile. Though they were likely to cause nothing but anxiety, the German authorities went so far as to distribute leaflets explaining that drop tanks were not bombs.
US paper tanks were developed by Col. Bob Shafer and Col. Cass Hough, who spent many hours developing a paper tank, then getting them into series production at Bowater-Lloyd&#x27;s of London, only to be told by experts at Wright Field &quot;paper tanks are absolutely unfeasible and will not do the job for which they are intended&quot;. Since by the time the experts made that pronouncement 8th Air Force fighters had already used more than 15,000 paper tanks without a failure, the criticism was not taken seriously. It may explain why the most often-used fuel tanks for single-engined American fighters operating in Northern Europe were the capacity all-metal tank (made from two halves of formed aluminium with a prominent horizontal seam running along the tank&#x27;s midline). Another common metal drop tank was the model used by P-51s, P-47s and P-38s.

=== Post-war use ===
The Matra JL-100 is a special hybrid drop tank and rocket pack; it combines a rocket launcher in front with 19 SNEB rockets and of fuel behind into one single aerodynamically shaped pod for mounting on combat aircraft such as the Dassault Mirage IIIs and English Electric Lightnings. The Convair B-58 Hustler, the first operational bomber capable of Mach 2 flight, had no bomb bay: it carried a single nuclear weapon plus fuel in a combination bomb/fuel pod underneath the fuselage.

==Automotive use==
After World War II, hot rodders raced the dry lakes of California to set new land speed records. War surplus drop tanks (aka belly tanks) were plentiful, aerodynamically neutral and it did not take long to convert one into a car, dubbed a lakester. According to GM historians, Bill Burke of the So-Cal Speed Shop first attempted to convert a P-51 Mustang belly tank, before switching to the larger P-38 Lightning tank. Even now, lakesters compete at the Bonneville Salt Flats.

<text>Anthony Howard Goldwyn (born May 20, 1960) is an American actor, singer, producer, director, and political activist. He made his debut appearing as Darren in the slasher film &quot;Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives&quot; (1986), and had his breakthrough for starring as Carl Bruner in the fantasy thriller film &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990), which earned him a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. He went on to star as Harold Nixon in the biographical film &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995), which earned him a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, and as Neil Armstrong in the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; (1998).

Goldwyn voiced the titular character in the Disney animated film &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), and portrayed Colonel Bagley in &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), Johnathon &quot;John&quot; Collingwood in the horror film &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; (2009), Andrew Prior in the &quot;Divergent&quot; film series (2014–2015) and Paul Cohen in &quot;King Richard&quot; (2021), the latter of which earned him a second nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award. He starred as President Fitzgerald Grant III in the ABC legal/political drama &quot;Scandal&quot; (2012–2018) and directed a number of episodes for the series, for which he won a Peabody Award. Since 2024, he has starred as District Attorney Nicholas Baxter on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;.

==Early life==
Goldwyn was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of actress Jennifer Howard and film producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. Goldwyn&#x27;s paternal grandparents were mogul Samuel Goldwyn, a Polish Jewish immigrant from Warsaw, and actress Frances Howard, who was originally from Nebraska. His maternal grandparents were playwright Sidney Howard and actress Clare Eames. One of his maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maryland Governor and Senator William Thomas Hamilton. Goldwyn attended Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts (where he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree), and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He additionally studied acting at HB Studio in New York City.

==Career==

Following his departure from drama school, Goldwyn began acting in guest star roles in the mid-1980s. Goldwyn had his breakthrough for playing Carl Bruner, friend-turned-betrayer of Patrick Swayze&#x27;s character Sam Wheat, in the fantasy thriller &quot;Ghost&quot;. It was the highest grossing film of 1990 and the most rented videocassette of 1991. For his performance, Goldwyn earned a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Goldwyn appeared on the comedy series &quot;Designing Women&quot;, in which he played a young interior designer named Kendall Dobbs, an HIV-positive man who was dying from AIDS and who asked the women of Sugarbakers to design his funeral. In the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Goldwyn played astronaut Neil Armstrong, commander of Apollo 11. He also voiced the title character in the 1999 animated feature film &quot;Tarzan&quot; which was produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and grossed over $400 million. He reprised the role in the video games &quot;&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;.

Goldwyn had a recurring role on the NBC-Universal drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; as Frank Goren, brother of lead character Robert Goren, played by Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio.

In 2015, he signed on to star in James Gunn&#x27;s horror thriller film &quot;The Belko Experiment&quot;. In June 2018, Goldwyn was cast as Ben Lefevre in the Netflix supernatural series &quot;Chambers&quot;. On 20 January 2021 during the inauguration of Joe Biden, Goldwyn was the host of the Virtual Parade Across America aired on television networks, organized by the Biden Inaugural Committee.

<text>The subcutaneous tissue (), also called the hypodermis, hypoderm (), subcutis, or superficial fascia, is the lowermost layer of the integumentary system in vertebrates. The types of cells found in the layer are fibroblasts, adipose cells, and macrophages. The subcutaneous tissue is derived from the mesoderm, but unlike the dermis, it is not derived from the mesoderm&#x27;s dermatome region. It consists primarily of loose connective tissue and contains larger blood vessels and nerves than those found in the dermis. It is a major site of fat storage in the body.

In arthropods, a hypodermis can refer to an epidermal layer of cells that secretes the chitinous cuticle. The term also refers to a layer of cells lying immediately below the epidermis of plants.

==Structure==
* Fibrous bands anchoring the skin to the deep fascia
* Collagen and elastin fibers attaching it to the dermis
* Fat is absent from the eyelids, clitoris, penis, much of pinna, and scrotum
* Blood vessels on route to the dermis
* Lymphatic vessels on route from the dermis
* The glandular part of some sweat glands; mammary glands lie entirely within the subcutaneous tissue (which are modified apocrine sweat glands)
* Cutaneous nerves and free endings
* Hair follicle roots
* Ruffini and Pacinian corpuscles
* Mast cells
* Bursae, in the space overlying joints in order to facilitate smooth passage of overlying skin
* Fine, flat sheets of muscle, in certain locations, including the scalp, face, hand, nipple, and scrotum, called the panniculus carnosus

The hypodermis forms an important insulating layer and/or food store in some animals, such as whales and hibernating mammals.

In some plants, the hypodermis is a layer of cells immediately below the epidermis of leaves. It is often mechanically strengthened, for example, in pine leaves, forming an extra protective layer or a water storage tissue.

=== Subcutaneous fat ===

Subcutaneous fat is the most widely distributed subcutaneous tissue layer. It is composed of adipocytes, which are grouped together in lobules separated by connective tissue. The number of adipocytes varies among different body areas, while their size varies according to the body&#x27;s nutritional state. It acts as padding and as an energy reserve, as well as providing some minor thermoregulation via insulation. Subcutaneous fat is found just beneath the skin, as opposed to visceral fat, which is found in the peritoneal cavity, and can be measured using body fat calipers to give a rough estimate of total body adiposity.

==Clinical significance==
===Injection===

Injection into the subcutaneous tissue is a route of administration used for drugs such as insulin: because it possesses few blood vessels, the tissue absorbs drugs slowly. Subcutaneous injection is believed to be the most effective manner to administer some drugs, such as human growth hormones. Just as the subcutaneous tissue can store fat, it can also provide good storage space for drugs that need to be released gradually because of limited blood flow. &quot;Skin popping&quot; is a slang term that includes this method of administration and is usually used in association with recreational drugs.

===Disease===
* Subcutaneous abscess
* Subcutaneous tumor

<doc id="1065866" wikidata="Q1771994" url="?curid=1065866" title="Askia Muhammad I">
<text>Askia Muhammad Ture I (1443–1538), born Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Turi or Muhammad Ture, was the first ruler of the Askia dynasty of the Songhai Empire, reigning from 1493 to 1528. He is also known as Askia the Great, and his name in modern Songhai is Mamar Kassey. Askia Muhammad strengthened his empire and made it the largest empire in West Africa&#x27;s history. At its peak under his reign, the Songhai Empire encompassed the Hausa states as far as Kano (in present-day Northern Nigeria) and much of the territory that had belonged to the Songhai empire in the east. His policies resulted in a rapid expansion of trade with Europe and Asia, the creation of many schools, and the establishment of Islam as an integral part of the empire.

Muhammad was a prominent general under the Songhai ruler Sunni Ali. When Sunni Ali was succeeded by his son, Sunni Baru, in 1492, Muhammad challenged the succession on the grounds that the new ruler was not a faithful Muslim. He defeated Baru and ascended to the throne in 1493.

Ture subsequently orchestrated a program of expansion and consolidation which extended the empire from Taghaza in the North to the borders of Yatenga in the South; and from Air in the Northeast to Futa Djallon in Guinea. Instead of organizing the empire along Islamic lines, he tempered and improved on the traditional model by instituting a system of bureaucratic government unparalleled in Western Africa. In addition, Askia established standardized trade measures and regulations, initiated the policing of trade routes and also established an organized tax system. He was overthrown by his son, Askia Musa, in 1528.

==Name and origins==
The &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; gives Askia Muhammad&#x27;s name as Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Turi or al-Sillanki. The &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot; gives his name as Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr. Al-Turi and al-Sillanki have been interpreted as the Soninke clan names Ture and Sila by many historians. However, Stephan Bühnen has argued that they should be interpreted as &quot;nisba&quot;s referring to ancestry from Futa Toro or Silla in the Senegal valley, and favors the possibility that his ancestors originally came from Futa Toro. 

After going on the &quot;hajj&quot; in 1497–1498, he also became known as Askia al-Hajj Muhammad. In modern Songhai, he is known as Mamar Kassey. Mamar is a form of the name Muhammad, and Kassey is a matronymic.
The theory that Askia Muhammad&#x27;s family originated in Futa Toro is controversial and has been generally rejected by the Songhai people themselves, especially by Muhammad&#x27;s modern descendants who see in it a challenge to their ethnicity. His exact surname has not been definitively determined and no Toucouleur or Soninke oral source claim him as one of their own. The Tarikh al-Fattash uses the title &#x27;maiga&#x27; for him, which is only used for the patrilineal kin of the Sunni dynasty. 

The term &#x27;sonhinkey,&#x27; which suggests a Soninke ethnic origin for Askia, is also the name of a clan of Songhai magicians responsible for the pre-Islamic cult and forming a younger branch of the royal Sunni clan without rights to the throne. Songhai oral traditions claim the father of Askia Mohammed originated from this clan. Omar Komajago, Askia&#x27;s brother, is never described as a Touré or a Sylla. 

The term at-Turi, which designates the geographical origin of a person, could be the name of Askia&#x27;s father&#x27;s village. There is a Songhai village call Tureh in Niger in the Tillabéri Region in the Tera Department. 

Although Askia Mohamed is generally seen as the son of princess Kassey, sister of Sunni Ali Ber, it is impossible that he himself came from Fouta Toro because the post of general was only given to a member of the royal family and ethnic Songhai patrilineally. The theory that he is an ethnic Songhai through both his father and mother is being studied at the Ahmed Baba center in Timbuktu.

==Title==
The title Askia () is of unknown origin, but had been in use since the early 13th century, if not earlier. It may derive from an arabic word for &#x27;general.&#x27; The &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; provides a folk etymology for the title, claiming that Askia Muhammad invented the title himself based on the lament of Sonni Ali&#x27;s daughters when they had learned he had seized power: &quot;a si Kiya&quot;, meaning &quot;it is not his&quot; or &quot;he shall not be it&quot;.

The original pronunciation of the title is not known; in modern Songhai, it is pronounced &quot;siciya&quot;. Moroccan sources spelled the title Sukyā or Sikyā, Leo Africanus spelled it Ischia, and a contemporary Portuguese source spelled it Azquya.

==Early life==

Askia Muhammad was born in Gao. His father, Baru Lum, was of Toucouleur or Soninke ancestry, with ancestors hailing from the Senegal River valley. His mother was named Kassey and is said in oral tradition to have been the sister of Sonni Ali.

==Rebellion==
Under Sonni Ali, Muhammad Ture was a powerful general but frequently clashed with the king. The &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot; paints him as a faithful Muslim opposed to Ali&#x27;s harsh treatment of the &quot;ulama&quot; of Timbuktu.

In 1492, shortly after the death of Sonni Ali, Muhammad Ture, then a general, rose up against Ali&#x27;s son Sonni Baru, claiming he was not a faithful Muslim. He drew his support from the &quot;ulama&quot; of Timbuktu, harshly persecuted under Ali, and Mansa Kura, the Muslim chief of Bara. Sonni Baru drew his from the traditional religious leaders of the Songhay and the &quot;Dendi fara&quot;, commander of an eastern province. Ture defeated Baru at the Battle of Anfao in April 1493 outside of Gao and took power and the title &#x27;Askia&#x27;.

==Reign==

In 1496 he made the hajj to Mecca, accompanied by 500 horsemen and 1000 infantry. Although he made many charitable donations during his pilgrimage, including setting up a place for West Africa pilgrims to stay in Medina, he returned to Gao having accumulated 50,000 ducats in debt. Despite being away for nearly two years, his return buttressed his position with the prestige of the titles of &quot;al-hajj&quot; and &quot;khalifa&quot;, and Islam became a pillar of his rule.

Upon his return, he embarked on a series of campaigns against the Mossi, the Sultanate of Agadez, and the Kanem-Borno empire. In 1501 he defeated the son of the Mansa Mahmud III, Qama-fiti-Kalli, and sacked and captured Diafunu. In 1504 an invasion of Borgu ended in disaster. An expedition to Walata captured the town, but was unable to hold it against Tuareg pressure, and Askia Muhammad accepted tribute in exchange for his abandoning the town. This alliance with the Tuareg was a key pillar of Songhai power, particularly in their control over the salt mines of Taghaza. 

In 1512, his brother Omar Komajago led an army that destroyed Futa Kingi, killed Tenguella, and brought the Kingdom of Diarra under the empire&#x27;s sway. 1515 saw another campaign against Agadez, reinforcing the Songhai position there. This was the peak of his power. Askia Muhammad had earlier conquered Katsina, Zaria and Gobir, devastating the cities with slave-taking and heavy taxation. The expedition against Agadez caused dissession when the Emir of Kebbi felt he had been cheated of his share of the spoils and rebelled, ending Songhai hegemony in Hausaland.

===Reforms===
Askia Muhammad profoundly reorganized the Songhai empire. Where Sonni Ali had been a diffident Muslim, Askia was devout. He based the legal system on sharia law, invited Islamic scholars from North Africa, and established Islam as the official religion of the noble class. He also divided the empire into provinces with centrally appointed governors and created a series of ministries (including finance, justice, interior, protocol, agriculture, waters and forests, and matters pertaining to “tribes of the white race” e.g. Tuaregs and Berbers), with all important positions filled by relatives. Although Gao remained the capital, Timbuktu became a kind of second capital.

Askia Muhammad created a professionalized army, rather than the general levy that his predecessors had commanded. These soldiers, legally slaves of the Askia, could be sent on long expeditions away from the Niger river.

==Exile and death==
Askia Muhammad had many sons, who jockeyed for position and influence at court. When a younger one, Bala, was appointed to a presitigious governorship, Musa threatened to have the king&#x27;s powerful advisor &#x27;Ali Folon killed and drove him to exile in Tindirma in 1526. He had been concealing the fact that Muhammad, well over 70 years old, had gone blind. Ill and increasingly politically isolated, Askia Muhammad was forced to abdicate by his son Askia Musa in August 1528. Musa reigned only 3 years before being killed by his brothers. His successor, the son of Omar Kondjago and Muhammad&#x27;s nephew, exiled the old king to an island in the Niger. From here, he plotted with his son Ismail to retake the throne. This was accomplished in April 1537, and Muhammad returned to Gao where he ceremonially conferred on Ismail the title and regalia of Caliph. He died and was buried in Gao in 1538. 

== Descent from Askia ==

The &quot;Tarikh al fattash&quot; reports the many descendants of Askia Muhammad, who is said to have had 471 children from many wives and concubines of various origins. Just like Genghis Khan in Asia and Charlemagne in Europe, Emperor Askia Muhammad and the emperors descended from his brother Omar Komdjago constitute patrilineal or matrilineal ancestors of a significant part of the native Sahelian populations and descendants of Sahelians who extend over 6 country where the Songhai are present, their descendants are mainly linked to powerful old royal house where always according to the sahel.

=== Mamar Haamey ===

Mamar is the nickname of Askia Muhammad and these many descendants are called mamar hamey, they are the descendants of Askia Ishaq II, Askia Nuh, Askia Muhammad V Gao who were dethroned by Moroccans after the Battle of Tondibi and the successive wars, to those add the descendants of the many ministers, governors, generals who constitute the children and grandchildren of the askia, in Mali they are scattered among their subjects and occupy the positions of village chief, and were under for some under the authority of the Moroccan arma chiefs (Gao Alkaydo of Gao, the Pasha of Timbuktu) before French colonization, only Djenne royal house, Hombori royal house and Kikara royal house have Askyanid ruler in Mali. In western Niger where the great princes migrated with all the strong lineage they founded powerful Emirates such as Dargol, Tera, Gothèye, Karma, Namaro, Sikié, Kokorou, larba Birno, Gounday next to the sunni emirs of Gorouol, Anzourou, they are constantly at war with each other and against the Tuareg ouelleminden and oudalan and the Fulani of Dori, those who mi gre further south reigns in Gaya, Bana, Tanda, Yelou, Bengou, loulami, karimama, Banikoara up to Djougou where they are in the majority and have formed the dendi where they are mixed and reign over the Bariba, Yoruba, Gur, Mandé, Yom, their arrival at the Dendi (province) triggers the assimilation of non-Songhai populations to the Songhai culture and language and an Islamization of the bargou, they are in Niger integrated with the Za and Sunni with the ethnic name Zarma, the most notable are the Emir Oumarou karma who fought against French colonization, Gabelinga Hama Kassa the military leader of goundey allied with wangugnya issa korombeyze moodi the mother of the war of zarmatarey during the wars against the caliphate of sokoto, they joined Babatu in Gurunsi and Dagbon to conquer the Upper Volta and the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast. The three members of the three dynasties on arrival Colonial was associated with the non-royal clans, their attached religious clans and their freedmen to form 1/4 of the Songhai population, 3/4 being made up of the servile mass that they had at their service. The Mamar haamey considering themselves uncles of the Djermas never enter into conflict with them and join forces with them to beat the sokoto, the Toucouleur, the Fulani of Dori and boboye and the Tuaregs.
In Burkina they are overwhelmed by the Fulani and Tuareg masses and many were ethnically assimilated by the Fulani, they are in Darkoye, Markoye and Gorom Gorom with the Sunni.

The descendants of the askia like that of sunni carry the title of Maiga associated with imperial power.

=== Songhai Djermas ===

The descendants of the Askia are also to be found mainly among the Songhai subgroup of the Djermas descending from the previous Za Dynasty of the Sunni Dynasty and Askia Dynasty and who ruled over the Gao Empire, the marriages between the members descending from the three powerful songhai dynasty was frequent and the princesses of blood and noble milk were only exchanged between these three dynasty, thus khaman Duksa, Zarmakoy sambo (Mali Bero) and Tagour Gana of the 17th and 18th century descendants of the za all took wives from the descendants of the askia living with them in the dendi, the askia reigning in the dendi on the right bank of the river and the royal Za lineage of the waazi, sega, fahmey, kogori, kandi, Manay, Zem on the left bank, they bear the royal title of Djermakoy which does not It is to bear that to the descendant of the za, he reigns in the zarmaganda (Tondikiwindi, Ouallam, Simiri ) over the kalley and in the zarmatarey (Dosso, kiota, yeni, Fakara, kouré, Kollo, libore, N&#x27;Dounga, kirtachi, babousaye, Tondikandia, bogole, Hamdallaye, Garankedey, Fabidji ) over the Gooley. The Maouri ( Royale house of Mawrikoy of sokorbe and Mawrikoy of Moussadey), Gubey (Royale house of goubekoy of Loga) assimilated and having constituted royal houses married to the za.

Matrimonial relations between the askia and the za are the basis of cousinhood between the Songhai djermas and the Songhai Mamar Hamey. The Mamar Haamey consider themselves the maternal uncles of the Zarma, the same relationship is observed with the descendants of the Sunni Ali Ber .

The descendants of the Za Dynasty have always occupied high positions in the empire in the Army and the administration, especially in the military province of dendi, where they held the position of Dendi Fari and their role was decisive in stopping the advance Moroccan in the dendi with generals of values like Hawa ize maali and yefarma ishak of the house of Manay.
the Mamar Hamay occupy two djerma kingdoms by imposition during the French colonization in Niger, the French massacre to the last the royal house of the Zarmakoy of Ouallam and bring in a Mamar Haama from Hombori to occupy the vacant throne, same case in the Fakara where a mamar haama is imported from Yonkoto to occupy the throne, all within the framework of the armed revolt of mamar haama oumarou emir of karma against the Colonial administration, the saying between songhai &quot; we are only one family that will chew each other but never swallow each other&quot; is used so that the populations of these two principalities accept the taxes. the Songhai do not have a problem when an ethnic Songhai comes to usurp a throne from them but this revolts in the case of a non-Songhai and leaves the country when they cannot prevent the unknown .

The Djerma, the mamar hamey and the si hamey all qualify as zaberbenda (the descendants of za the great, za el ayaman) and must support each other in the event of an enemy attack, when the mamar haama are attacked on the right bank, the Tubal War drum are struck to warn the left bank where the Djerma princes are beating theirs to gather their armies and cross the river to support their brother in the west and vice versa.

=== Hausa land ===

Askia Mohamed I is the maternal ancestor of the Hausa Sultans of the Bagauda Dynasty through his daughter Awah married to Muhammad Rumfa Sultan of Kano during the conquest of the Hausa Kingdoms by the Songhai Empire, they are replaced by the Fulani Sullubawa clan Dabo Dynasty during the conquest of kano by the Sokoto caliphate, having many daughters the askia contracted diplomatic marriages with the kings subject to his power to ensure their loyalty, kano is certainly not the only Hausa state where this kind relationships were established.

All Hausa descendants of Muhammad Rumfa sultan of Kano are matrilineal line descendants of Askia.

=== Others ===

The Arma who come from the marriage between the Spanish soldiers of Morocco and the Songhai women are also in matrilineal line descending from the Askiya for the most part.

Throughout the Central Sahel, the descendants in patrilineal or matrilineal line of the askia can be around Million drawn from the ethnic Songhai which amounts to nearly 11 million people and possible descendants among the Hausa, The Fula and there are generally only than associated with royal houses.
The pyramidal Tomb of Askia located in Gao has not been the subject of any excavation to examine his remains in order to carry out genetic examinations and these known descendants have no longer been the subject of study, only a genetic study can confirm the historical connection.

Are sons the Askia Dawud also had Total 333 children according to the Tarikh al-Sudan while the Tarikh al-Fattash has 61 children, 30 of whom died at a young age.
the many princes died for the most part young because of the assassinations that occurred during the successions to the imperial throne, especially with the emperors Askia Musa the eldest of the sons of the askia born of his Dahomean concubine who carried out a coup and murdered a good number of these brothers and 25 to 35 of these cousins.

The successions on the imperial Songhai throne are generally preceded by a battle between the princes, the strongest generally takes power, it is this instability which favored the Moroccan invasion and the defeat of Tondibi due to a weak contribution of troops resulting from the cold between the emperor Ishaq II and the balama of the kurmina.

==Legacy==
Askia encouraged learning and literacy, ensuring that Songhai&#x27;s universities produced the most distinguished scholars, many of whom published significant books and one of which was his nephew and friend Mahmud Kati. To secure the legitimacy of his usurpation of the Sonni dynasty, Askia Muhammad allied himself with the scholars of Timbuktu, ushering in a golden age in the city for scientific and Muslim scholarship. The eminent scholar Ahmed Baba, for example, produced books on Islamic law which are still in use today. Muhammad Kati published &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; and Abdul-Rahman as-Sadi published &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of The Black Land&quot;), two history books which are indispensable to present-day scholars reconstructing African history in the Middle Ages.
The king&#x27;s supposed tomb, the Tomb of Askia, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===In popular culture===
* The Nigerien musical group Mamar Kassey is named after Askia Muhammad.
* In the turn-based strategy game &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization V&quot;, Askia Muhammad is depicted as the leader of the Songhai civilization, one of the playable factions.

<doc id="1065871" wikidata="Q2111211" url="?curid=1065871" title="Superreal number">
<text>In abstract algebra, the superreal numbers are a class of extensions of the real numbers, introduced by H. Garth Dales and W. Hugh Woodin as a generalization of the hyperreal numbers and primarily of interest in non-standard analysis, model theory, and the study of Banach algebras. The field of superreals is itself a subfield of the surreal numbers.

Dales and Woodin&#x27;s superreals are distinct from the super-real numbers of David O. Tall, which are lexicographically ordered fractions of formal power series over the reals.

==Formal definition==
Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a Tychonoff space and C(&quot;X&quot;) is the algebra of continuous real-valued functions on &quot;X&quot;. Suppose &quot;P&quot; is a prime ideal in C(&quot;X&quot;). Then the factor algebra &quot;A&quot; = C(&quot;X&quot;)/&quot;P&quot; is by definition an integral domain that is a real algebra and that can be seen to be totally ordered. The field of fractions &quot;F&quot; of &quot;A&quot; is a superreal field if &quot;F&quot; strictly contains the real numbers formula_1, so that &quot;F&quot; is not order isomorphic to formula_1.

If the prime ideal &quot;P&quot; is a maximal ideal, then &quot;F&quot; is a field of hyperreal numbers (Robinson&#x27;s hyperreals being a very special case).

<doc id="1065874" wikidata="Q6604456" url="?curid=1065874" title="List of X-15 flights">
<text>The flights of the [[North American X-15]], an experimental American spaceplane built by North American Aviation and operated by the United States Air Force and NASA, were conducted from 1959 to 1968. Twelve pilots flew three X-15 spaceplanes, flying record high-altitude flights, high-speed flights, and sub-orbital spaceflights. Collectively, pilots and craft performed a total of 199 free flights after being carried aloft and then air launched from one of two modified B-52 mother ships. The pilots and craft also performed twelve scheduled captive carry test flights and 125 aborted flights (frequently due either to technical problems or poor weather) in which the X-15 did not uncouple from its B-52 mother ship, for a grand total of 336 flights. The X-15 program&#x27;s flights generated data and flight experience which supported future development of aircraft, spacecraft, and human spaceflight.

Five principal aircraft were used during the X-15 program: three X-15 spaceplanes and two modified &quot;nonstandard&quot; NB-52 bomber carriers:
* &quot;56-6670&quot;,
* &quot;56-6671&quot;,
* &quot;56-6672&quot;,
* &quot;52-003&quot; nicknamed &quot;The High and Mighty One&quot;,
* &quot;52-008&quot; nicknamed &quot;The Challenger&quot;, later &quot;Balls 8&quot;.
Additionally, F-100, F-104 and F5D chase aircraft and C-130 and C-47 transports supported the program.

==Pilots==

Twelve pilots flew the X-15 over the course of its career. Scott Crossfield and William Dana flew the X-15 on its first and last free flights, respectively. Joseph Walker set the program&#x27;s top two altitude records on its 90th and 91st free flights (347,800 and 354,200 feet, respectively), becoming the only pilot to fly past the Kármán line, the 100 kilometer, FAI-recognized boundary of outer space, during the program. William Knight set the program&#x27;s Mach (6.70) and speed (4,520 mph) records on its 188th free flight. Neil Armstrong was the first pilot to fly the program&#x27;s third plane, the X-15-3. Following his participation in the program, Joe Engle commanded a future spaceplane, the Space Shuttle, on two missions. Robert Rushworth flew 34 free flights, the most in the program. Forrest Petersen flew five, the fewest. Robert White was the first person to fly the X-15 above 100,000 feet. Milton Thompson piloted a series of typical flights during the middle of the program. John McKay was injured in (and recovered from, returning to active flight status) a landing accident which damaged the X-15-2, leading to its refurbishment as the modified X-15A-2. Michael Adams was killed in the program&#x27;s 191st free flight. Five pilots were Air Force personnel, five were NASA personnel, one (Crossfield) was employed by manufacturer North American, and one (Petersen) was a Navy pilot.

Over thirteen flights, eight pilots flew above 264,000 feet or 50 miles, thereby qualifying as astronauts according to the United States definition of the space border. All five Air Force pilots flew above 50 miles and were awarded military astronaut wings contemporaneously with their achievements, including Adams, who received the distinction posthumously following the flight 191 disaster. However the other three were NASA employees, and did not receive a comparable decoration at the time. In 2004, the Federal Aviation Administration conferred its first-ever commercial astronaut wings on Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie, pilots of the commercial SpaceShipOne, another spaceplane with a flight profile comparable to the X-15&#x27;s. Following this in 2005, NASA retroactively awarded its civilian astronaut wings to Dana (then living), and to McKay and Walker (posthumously). Eleven flights above 50 miles were made in the X-15-3, and two were made in the X-15-1.

Every X-15 pilot also flew as a program chase pilot at least once, supporting missions in which they were not flying as lead pilots. Other chase pilots included future astronauts Michael Collins, Fred Haise and Jim McDivitt.

The two NB-52 mother ships were most frequently piloted by Fitz Fulton. On one occasion Chuck Yeager, former pilot of the X-15&#x27;s predecessor X-plane the X-1, the first crewed craft to break the sound barrier, assisted as NB-52 co-pilot for an aborted flight.

==Flight numbering==
Two conventions have been used to number the X-15&#x27;s flights. In one, the numbers 1 through 199 were used to chronologically denote the free flights made by any of the three spaceplanes. For example, flight 1 (8 June 1959) was made by the X-15-1, flight 34 (7 March 1961) was made by the X-15-2, and flight 49 (5 April 1962) was made by the X-15-3. This convention ignores captive and aborted flights.

The other convention was an official three-part flight designation number, described in a 1960 letter by NASA flight research director Paul Bikle, and split into three columns below. The first part, a number—1, 2 or 3—would denote the involved X-15 plane. The second part—a number, or &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;C&quot;—would denote that individual X-15&#x27;s chronological free flights; aborted flights were coded as &quot;A&quot;, and scheduled captive carry test flights were coded as &quot;C&quot;. The third part, a number, would denote the total number of times to-date that the individual X-15 had been taken aloft by a carrier, whether resulting in a free flight or not. For example, the X-15-1 was first taken aloft on scheduled captive test flight 1-C-1, next performed three aborted missions (1-A-2, 1-A-3, and 1-A-4), and then performed its first successful free flight on its fifth time taken aloft (1-1-5).

On 9 November 1962, flight 74 (2-31-52), the X-15-2 suffered a landing accident which damaged the craft and also injured its pilot, John McKay, who suffered crushed vertebrae and later returned to active flight status. This presented North American with an opportunity not only to repair the plane, but to modify it—an idea which the Air Force and NASA were uninterested in while all three spaceplanes were in operational service, but agreed to once repairs were made necessary. The result was a new, distinct airframe known as the X-15A-2 which returned to flight in June 1964, first on a scheduled captive check-out flight (15 June, 2-C-53) and an abort (23 June, 2-A-54) before finally making its return free flight on 25 June (flight 109, 2-32-55), all piloted by Robert Rushworth. The flight numbering conventions made no distinction between the original craft and its modified iteration; it continued to be designated &quot;2&quot;.

Neither convention accounted for which of the two NB-52 carriers took an X-15 aloft, given in a separate column below. On free flights, the NB-52A carried the X-15 aloft 93 times, while the NB-52B carried it aloft 106 times.

<doc id="1065880" wikidata="Q7826754" url="?curid=1065880" title="Torpenhow Hill">
<text>Torpenhow Hill (, ) is claimed to be the name of a hill near the village of Torpenhow in Cumbria, England, a name that is tautological. According to an analysis by linguist Darryl Francis and locals, there is no landform formally known as Torpenhow Hill there, either officially or locally, which would make the term an example of a ghost word.

A.D. Mills in his &quot;Dictionary of English Place-Names&quot; interprets the name as &quot;Ridge of the hill with a rocky peak&quot;, giving its etymology as Old English &quot;torr&quot;, Celtic *&quot;penn&quot;, and Old English &quot;hoh&quot;, each of which mean &#x27;hill&#x27;. Thus, the name &#x27;Torpenhow Hill&#x27; could be interpreted as: hill-hill-hill Hill.

In 1688, Thomas Denton stated that Torpenhow Hall and church stand on a &#x27;rising topped hill&#x27;, which he assumed might have been the source of the name of the village. Denton apparently exaggerated the example to a &quot;Torpenhow Hill&quot;, which would quadruple the &quot;hill&quot; element, but the existence of a toponym &quot;Torpenhow Hill&quot; is not substantiated.

In 1884, G.L. Fenton proposed the name as an example of &quot;quadruple redundancy&quot; in tautological placename etymologies, i.e. that all four elements of the name might mean &quot;hill&quot;.
It was used as a convenient example for the nature of loanword adoption by Thomas Comber in c. 1880.

<doc id="1065882" wikidata="Q660498" url="?curid=1065882" title="Germ layer">
<text>A germ layer is a primary layer of cells that forms during embryonic development. The three germ layers in vertebrates are particularly pronounced; however, all eumetazoans (animals that are sister taxa to the sponges) produce two or three primary germ layers. Some animals, like cnidarians, produce two germ layers (the ectoderm and endoderm) making them diploblastic. Other animals such as bilaterians produce a third layer (the mesoderm) between these two layers, making them triploblastic. Germ layers eventually give rise to all of an animal&#x27;s tissues and organs through the process of organogenesis.

== History ==
Caspar Friedrich Wolff observed organization of the early embryo in leaf-like layers. In 1817, Heinz Christian Pander discovered three primordial germ layers while studying chick embryos. Between 1850 and 1855, Robert Remak had further refined the germ cell layer (&quot;Keimblatt&quot;) concept, stating that the external, internal and middle layers form respectively the epidermis, the gut, and the intervening musculature and vasculature. The term &quot;mesoderm&quot; was introduced into English by Huxley in 1871, and &quot;ectoderm&quot; and &quot;endoderm&quot; by Lankester in 1873.

== Evolution ==
Among animals, sponges show the least amount of compartmentalization, having a single germ layer. Although they have differentiated cells (e.g. collar cells), they lack true tissue coordination. Diploblastic animals, Cnidaria and Ctenophora, show an increase in compartmentalization, having two germ layers, the endoderm and ectoderm. Diploblastic animals are organized into recognisable tissues. All bilaterian animals (from flatworms to humans) are triploblastic, possessing a mesoderm in addition to the germ layers found in Diploblasts. Triploblastic animals develop recognizable organs.

==Development==
Fertilization leads to the formation of a zygote. During the next stage, cleavage, mitotic cell divisions transform the zygote into a hollow ball of cells, a blastula. This early embryonic form undergoes gastrulation, forming a gastrula with either two or three layers (the germ layers). In all vertebrates, these progenitor cells differentiate into all adult tissues and organs.

In the human embryo, after about three days, the zygote forms a solid mass of cells by mitotic division, called a morula. This then changes to a blastocyst, consisting of an outer layer called a trophoblast, and an inner cell mass called the embryoblast. Filled with uterine fluid, the blastocyst breaks out of the zona pellucida and undergoes implantation. The inner cell mass initially has two layers: the hypoblast and epiblast. At the end of the second week, a primitive streak appears. The epiblast in this region moves towards the primitive streak, dives down into it, and forms a new layer, called the endoderm, pushing the hypoblast out of the way (this goes on to form the amnion.) The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The top layer is now called the ectoderm.

Gastrulation occurs in reference to the primary body axis. Germ layer formation is linked to the primary body axis as well, however it is less reliant on it than gastrulation is. &quot;Hydractinia&quot; shows that germ layer formation that transpires as a mixed delamination.

In mice, germ layer differentiation is controlled by two transcription factors: Sox2 and Oct4 proteins. These transcription factors cause the pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells to select a germ layer fate. Sox2 promotes ectodermal differentiation, while Oct4 promotes mesendodermal differentiation. Each gene inhibits what the other promotes. Amounts of each protein are different throughout the genome, causing the embryonic stem cells to select their fate.

==The germ layers==
===Endoderm===

The endoderm is one of the germ layers formed during animal embryonic development. Cells migrating inward along the archenteron form the inner layer of the gastrula, which develops into the endoderm.

The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the epithelial lining of the whole of the digestive tract except part of the mouth and pharynx and the terminal part of the rectum (which are lined by involutions of the ectoderm). It also forms the lining cells of all the glands which open into the digestive tract, including those of the liver and pancreas; the epithelium of the auditory tube and tympanic cavity; the trachea, bronchi, and alveoli of the lungs; the bladder and part of the urethra; and the follicle lining of the thyroid gland and thymus.

The endoderm forms: the pharynx, the esophagus, the stomach, the small intestine, the colon, the liver, the pancreas, the bladder, the epithelial parts of the trachea and bronchi, the lungs, the thyroid, and the parathyroid.

===Mesoderm===
The mesoderm germ layer forms in the embryos of triploblastic animals. During gastrulation, some of the cells migrating inward contribute to the mesoderm, an additional layer between the endoderm and the ectoderm. The formation of a mesoderm leads to the development of a coelom. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions protects them from shocks.

The mesoderm has several components which develop into tissues: intermediate mesoderm, paraxial mesoderm, lateral plate mesoderm, and chorda-mesoderm. The chorda-mesoderm develops into the notochord. The intermediate mesoderm develops into kidneys and gonads. The paraxial mesoderm develops into cartilage, skeletal muscle, and dermis. The lateral plate mesoderm develops into the circulatory system (including the heart and spleen), the wall of the gut, and wall of the human body.

Through cell signaling cascades and interactions with the ectodermal and endodermal cells, the mesodermal cells begin the process of differentiation.

The mesoderm forms: muscle (smooth and striated), bone, cartilage, connective tissue, adipose tissue, circulatory system, lymphatic system, dermis, dentine of teeth, genitourinary system, serous membranes, spleen and notochord.

===Ectoderm===
The ectoderm generates the outer layer of the embryo, and it forms from the embryo&#x27;s epiblast. The ectoderm develops into the surface ectoderm, neural crest, and the neural tube.

The surface ectoderm develops into: epidermis, hair, nails, lens of the eye, sebaceous glands, cornea, tooth enamel, the epithelium of the mouth and nose.

The neural crest of the ectoderm develops into: peripheral nervous system, adrenal medulla, melanocytes, facial cartilage.

The neural tube of the ectoderm develops into: brain, spinal cord, posterior pituitary, motor neurons, retina.

Note: The anterior pituitary develops from the ectodermal tissue of Rathke&#x27;s pouch.

====Neural crest====

Because of its great importance, the neural crest is sometimes considered a fourth germ layer. It is, however, derived from the ectoderm.

<text>APT-RPM is a version of the Advanced Packaging Tool modified to work with the RPM Package Manager. It was originally ported to RPM by Alfredo Kojima and then further developed and improved by Gustavo Niemeyer, both working for the Conectiva Linux distribution at the time.

In March 2005, the maintainer of the program, Gustavo Niemeyer, announced that he would not continue developing it and that he would instead focus on Smart Package Manager, which was planned as a successor to APT-RPM.

In March 2006, development was picked up again by Panu Matilainen from Red Hat at a new home, introducing basic multilib functionality and support for common repository metadata.

==Distributions==
Some distributions using APT-RPM for package management are:
* ALT Linux: APT-RPM is the main, officially supported way to upgrade packages from the ALT Linux repositories in ALT Linux distributions since 2001.
* PCLinuxOS: APT-RPM is the backend for the only official way to upgrade packages in this distribution.
* Vine Linux: APT-RPM has been the main, officially supported way to upgrade packages in Vine Linux distributions since 2001.

<doc id="1065888" wikidata="Q1054543" url="?curid=1065888" title="Cephalization">
<text>Cephalization is an evolutionary trend in animals that, over a sufficient number of generations, concentrates the special sense organs and nerve ganglia towards the front of the body where the mouth is located, often producing an enlarged head. This is associated with the animal&#x27;s movement direction and bilateral symmetry. Cephalization of the nervous system has led to the formation of a brain with varying degrees of functional centralization in three phyla of bilaterian animals, namely the arthropods, cephalopod molluscs, and vertebrates. Hox genes organise aspects of cephalization in the bilaterians.

== Bilateria ==

Cephalization is both a characteristic feature of any animal that habitually moves in one direction, thereby gaining a front end, and an evolutionary trend which created the head of these animals. In practice, this primarily means the bilaterians, a large group containing the majority of animal phyla. These have the ability to move, using muscles, and a body plan with a front end that encounters stimuli first as the animal moves forwards, and accordingly has evolved to contain many of the body&#x27;s sense organs, able to detect light, chemicals, and gravity. There is often a collection of nerve cells able to process the information from these sense organs, forming a brain in several phyla and one or more ganglia (clusters of nerve cells) in others.

=== Complex active bodies ===

The philosopher Michael Trestman noted that three bilaterian phyla, namely the arthropods, the molluscs in the shape of the cephalopods, and the chordates, were distinctive in having &quot;complex active bodies&quot;, something that the acoels and flatworms did not have. Any such animal, whether predator or prey, has to be aware of its environment—to catch its prey, or to evade its predators. These groups are exactly those that are most highly cephalized. These groups, however, are not closely related: in fact, they represent widely separated branches of the Bilateria, as shown on the phylogenetic tree; their lineages split hundreds of millions of years ago. Other (less cephalized) phyla are omitted for clarity.

==== Arthropods ====

In arthropods, cephalization progressed with the gradual incorporation of trunk segments into the head region. This was advantageous because it allowed for the evolution of more effective mouth-parts for capturing and processing food. Insects are strongly cephalized, their brain made of three fused ganglia attached to the ventral nerve cord, which in turn has a pair of ganglia in each segment of the thorax and abdomen, the parts of the trunk behind the head. The insect head is an elaborate structure made of several segments fused rigidly together, and equipped with both simple and compound eyes, and multiple appendages including sensory antennae and complex mouthparts (maxillae and mandibles).

==== Cephalopods ====

Cephalopods including the octopus, squid, cuttlefish and nautilus are the most intelligent of molluscs. They are highly cephalized, with well-developed senses, including advanced &#x27;camera&#x27; eyes and large brains.

==== Vertebrates ====

Cephalization in vertebrates, the group that includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fishes, has been studied extensively. The heads of vertebrates are complex structures, with distinct sense organs for sight, olfaction, and hearing, and a large, multi-lobed brain protected by a skull of bone or cartilage. Cephalochordates like the lancelet (&quot;Amphioxus&quot;), a small fishlike animal with very little cephalization, are closely related to vertebrates but do not have these structures. In the 1980s, the new head hypothesis proposed that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of neural crest and cranial placodes (thickened areas of the embryonic ectoderm layer), which result in the formation of all sense organs outside the brain. However, in 2014, a transient larva tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the neural crest-derived cartilage (which becomes bone in jawed animals) which forms the vertebrate skull, suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire head space could be a viable evolutionary route to forming the vertebrate head. Advanced vertebrates have increasingly elaborate brains.

=== Anterior Hox genes ===

Bilaterians have many more Hox genes controlling the development, including of the front of the body than do the less cephalized Cnidaria (two Hox clusters) and the Acoelomorpha (three Hox clusters). In the vertebrates, duplication resulted in the four Hox clusters (&quot;HoxA&quot; to &quot;HoxD&quot;) of mammals and birds, while another duplication gave teleost fishes eight Hox clusters. Some of these genes, those responsible for the front (anterior) of the body, helped to create the heads of both arthropods and vertebrates. However, the &quot;Hox1-5&quot; genes were already present in ancestral arthropods and vertebrates that did not have complex head structures. The Hox genes therefore most likely assisted in cephalization of these two bilaterian groups independently by convergent evolution, resulting in similar gene networks.

== Partly cephalized phyla ==

The Acoela are basal bilaterians, part of the Xenacoelomorpha. They are small and simple animals with flat bodies. They have slightly more nerve cells at the head end than elsewhere, not forming a distinct and compact brain. This represents an early stage in cephalization.

Also among the bilaterians, Platyhelminthes (flatworms) have a more complex nervous system than the Acoela, and are lightly cephalized, for instance having an eyespot above the brain, near the front end.

Among animals without bilateral symmetry, the Cnidaria, such as the radially symmetrical (roughly cylindrical) Hydrozoa, show some degree of cephalization. The Anthomedusae have a head end with their mouth, photoreceptor cells, and a concentration of nerve cells.

<text>Edward John Mostyn Bowlby (; 26 February 1907 – 2 September 1990) was a British psychiatrist, and psychoanalyst, notable for his interest in child development and for his pioneering work in attachment theory. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Bowlby as the 49th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Family background ==
Bowlby was born in London to an upper-middle-income family. He was the fourth of six children and was brought up by a nanny in the British fashion of his class at that time: the family hired a nanny who was in charge of raising the children, in a separate nursery in the house. Nanny Friend took care of the infants and generally had two other nursemaids to help her. Bowlby was raised primarily by nursemaid Minnie who acted as a mother figure to him and his siblings.

His father, Sir Anthony Alfred Bowlby, was surgeon to the King&#x27;s Household, with a history of early loss: at age five, Anthony&#x27;s father, Thomas William Bowlby, was killed while serving as a war correspondent in the Second Opium War.

Bowlby&#x27;s parents met at a party in 1897 through a mutual friend. About one year after meeting, Mary (age 31) and Anthony (age 43) decided to get married in 1898. The start of their marriage was said to be difficult due to conflict with Anthony&#x27;s sister and physical separation between Mary and Anthony. To resolve this prolonged separation, Mary decided to visit her husband for six months while leaving her firstborn daughter Winnie in the care of her nanny. This separation between Mary and her children was a theme found in all six of her children&#x27;s lives as they were primarily raised by the nanny and nursemaids.

Normally, Bowlby saw his mother only one hour a day after teatime, though during the summer she was more available. Like many other mothers of her social class, she considered that parental attention and affection would lead to dangerous spoiling of the children. Bowlby was fortunate in that the family nanny was present throughout his childhood. When Bowlby was almost four years old, the nursemaid Minnie, his primary caregiver in his early years, left the family. Later, he was to describe this as tragic as the loss of a mother. After Minnie left, Bowlby and his siblings were cared for by Nanny Friend, of a colder and sarcastic nature.

During World War I, Bowlby&#x27;s father Anthony was on military service. He came home once or twice a year and had little contact with him and his siblings. His mother received letters from Anthony but she did not share them with her children.

At the age of seven, Bowlby was sent to boarding school, as was common for boys of his social status. Bowlby&#x27;s parents decided to send both him and his older brother Tony to a prep school, to protect them from the bombing attacks due to the ongoing war. In his 1973 work &quot;Separation: Anxiety and Anger&quot;, Bowlby wrote that he regarded it as a terrible time for him. He later said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t send a dog away to boarding school at age seven&quot;. However, earlier Bowlby had considered boarding schools appropriate for children aged eight and older. In 1951, he wrote: If the child is maladjusted, it may be useful for him to be away for part of the year from the tensions which produced his difficulties, and if the home is bad in other ways the same is true. The boarding school has the advantage of preserving the child&#x27;s all-important home ties, even if in slightly attenuated form, and, since it forms part of the ordinary social pattern of most Western communities today [1951], the child who goes to boarding school will not feel different from other children. Moreover, by relieving the parents of the children for part of the year, it will be possible for some of them to develop more favorable attitudes toward their children during the remainder.

Bowlby married Ursula Longstaff, the daughter of a surgeon, on 16 April 1938, and they had four children, including Sir Richard Bowlby, who succeeded his uncle as third Baronet.

Bowlby died at his summer home on the Isle of Skye, Scotland.

== Career ==
In an interview with Dr. Milton Stenn in 1977, Bowlby explained that his career started off in the medical direction as he was following in his surgeon father&#x27;s footsteps. His father was a well-known surgeon in London and Bowlby explained that he was encouraged by his father to study medicine at Cambridge. Therefore, he followed his father&#x27;s suggestion, but was not fully interested in the lessons in anatomy and natural sciences that he was reading about. However, during his time at Trinity College, he became particularly interested in developmental psychology, which led him to give up medicine by his third year. When Bowlby gave up medicine, he took a teaching opportunity at a school called Priory Gates for six months where he worked with maladjusted children. Bowlby explained that one of the reasons why he went to work at Priory Gates was because of an intelligent staff member, John Alford. Bowlby explained that the experience at Priory Gates was extremely influential on him &quot;It suited me very well because I found it interesting. And when I was there, I learned everything that I have known; it was the most valuable six months of my life, really. It was analytically oriented&quot;. He further explained that the experience at Priory Gates was extremely influential to his career in research as he learned that the problems of today should be understood and dealt with at a developmental level.

Bowlby studied psychology and pre-clinical sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, winning prizes for outstanding intellectual performance. After Cambridge, he worked with maladjusted and delinquent children until, at the age of twenty-two, he enrolled at University College Hospital in London. At twenty-six, he qualified in medicine. While still in medical school, he enrolled himself in the Institute for Psychoanalysis. Following medical school, he trained in adult psychiatry at the Maudsley Hospital. In 1936, aged 30, he qualified as a psychoanalyst.

During the first six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at the London Child Guidance clinic in Canonbury as a physician. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going back and forth from Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research on separation that he was focused on pre-war.

During the first winter of World War II, Bowlby began working on his first published work &quot;Forty-four Juvenile Thieves&quot;. Although he began working on this book at the beginning of the Second World War, it was not published until 1944. Bowlby studied several children during his time at the Canonbury clinic, and developed a research project based on case studies of the children&#x27;s behaviors and family histories. Bowlby examined 44 delinquent children from Canonbury who had a history of stealing and compared them to &quot;controls&quot; from Canonbury that were being treated for various reasons but did not have a history of stealing. Bowlby categorized the delinquent children into six different character types which included: normal, depressed, circular, hyperthymic, affectionless, and schizoid.

One of Bowlby&#x27;s main findings through his research with these children was that 17 out of the 44 thieves experienced early and prolonged separation (six months or more) from their primary caregiver before the age of five. In comparison, only two out of the 44 children who did not steal had experienced prolonged separation from their primary caregiver before the age of five. More specifically, Bowlby found that 12 out of the 14 children who were categorized as affectionless were found to have experienced complete and prolonged separation before the age of five. These findings were important and brought more attention to the impact of early environmental experiences on healthy child development.

After the war, he was deputy director of the Tavistock Clinic, and from 1950, Mental Health Consultant to the World Health Organization.
Because of his previous work with maladapted and delinquent children, he became interested in the development of children and returned to work at the London Child Guidance Clinic in Islington. His interest was probably increased by a variety of wartime events involving separation of young children from familiar people. These included the rescue of Jewish children by the Kindertransport arrangements, the evacuation of children from London to keep them safe from air raids, and the use of group nurseries to allow mothers of young children to contribute to the war effort. Bowlby was interested from the beginning of his career in the problem of separation, the wartime work of Anna Freud and Dorothy Burlingham on evacuees, and the work of René Spitz with orphans.

By the late 1950s, he had accumulated a body of observational and theoretical work to indicate the fundamental importance for human development of attachment from birth. He contributed evidence to the Platt Report 1959 about how separation from mother whilst in hospital could be harmful to children.

Bowlby was interested in finding out the patterns of family interaction involved in both healthy and pathological development. He focused on how attachment difficulties were transmitted from one generation to the next. In his development of attachment theory, he proposed the idea that attachment behaviour was an evolutionary survival strategy for protecting the infant from predators. Mary Ainsworth joined Bowlby&#x27;s research unit at Tavistock and further extended and tested his ideas. She played the primary role in suggesting that several attachment styles existed.

Seven important experiences for Bowlby&#x27;s future work and the development of attachment theory were:

* Bowlby&#x27;s teaching experience at Priory Gates School, where he worked with maladapted and delinquent children.
* His opportunity to work with children who were evacuated from their families due to the war, leading to his work on the forty-four juvenile thieves.
*The addition of an ethology perspective to his thoughts and observations of mother-child separations, which helped him move beyond a psychoanalytic perspective.
* Mary Ainsworth&#x27;s structured observation technique known as strange situation and the development of the different types of attachment styles as well as her contributions and introduction of the secure base to Bowlby.
* James Robertson (in 1952) in making the documentary film &quot;A Two-Year Old Goes to Hospital&quot;, which was one of the films about &quot;young children in brief separation&quot;. The documentary illustrated the impact of loss and suffering experienced by young children separated from their primary caretakers. This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents. When he and Robertson presented their film &quot;A Two Year Old Goes to Hospital&quot; to the British Psychoanalytical Society in 1952, psychoanalysts did not accept that a child would mourn or experience grief on separation but instead saw the child&#x27;s distress as caused by elements of unconscious fantasies (in the film because the mother was pregnant). Bowlby also incorporated Robertson&#x27;s naturalistic observation methods of children&#x27;s behaviors.
* Melanie Klein during his psychoanalytic training. She was his supervisor; however, they had different views about the role of the mother in the treatment of a three-year-old boy. Specifically and importantly, Klein stressed the role of the child&#x27;s fantasies about his mother, but Bowlby emphasised the actual history of the relationship. Bowlby&#x27;s views—that children were responding to real life events and not unconscious fantasies—were rejected by psychoanalysts, and Bowlby was effectively ostracised by the psychoanalytic community. He later expressed the view that his interest in real-life experiences and situations was &quot;alien to the Kleinian outlook&quot;. Furthermore, Bowlby explained in an interview with Milton Stenn in 1977 that the psychoanalytic community did not accept his developmental theories as they were completely different from the unconscious fantasy theories surrounding psychoanalysis during that time. He further explained that:
There were certain groups who took to it with great enthusiasm, other groups were directly lukewarm and other hostile, each profession reacted differently. The social workers took to it with enthusiasm; the psychoanalysts treated it with caution, curiously and for me infuriatingly pediatricians were initially hostile but subsequently many of them became very supporting; adult psychiatrists totally uninterested, totally ignorant, totally uninterested.
* Donald Winnicott, who was a pediatrician and child psychoanalyst, had an immense influence on Bowlby&#x27;s work and career. Bowlby and Winnicott had several similarities within their professional work as they were the first to explain the importance of social interactions at an early age. Both Bowlby and Winnicott argued that humans come into the world with a predisposition to be sensitive to social interactions and to need these interactions in order to have a healthy development. However, although Bowlby and Winnicott&#x27;s ideas were similar, they took vastly different approaches when dealing with their research. For example, Bowlby was interested in how a child&#x27;s environment is internalized and affects the child&#x27;s development, while Winnicott was more interested in &quot;the way the inner world engages with and thereby is affected by external events&quot;. Despite their differences in approaching their research interests, Bowlby explained in an interview that his research for the World Health Organization influenced policies regarding child care; however, none of this would have been possible without the help of Winnicott. Winnicott worked more at a clinical level than Bowlby which influenced several social workers as he spent his career working to change policies. Bowlby explained that Winnicott is one of the more important individuals who was able to push Bowlby&#x27;s work to change policies.

==Maternal deprivation==

In 1949, Bowlby&#x27;s earlier work on delinquent and affectionless children and the effects of hospitalised and institutionalised care led to his being commissioned to write the World Health Organization&#x27;s report on the mental health of homeless children in post-war Europe. The result was &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot;, published in 1951.

Bowlby drew together such limited empirical evidence as existed at the time from across Europe and the US. His main conclusions, that &quot;the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment&quot; and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences, were both controversial and influential. The 1951 WHO publication was highly influential in causing widespread changes in the practices and prevalence of institutional care for infants and children, and in changing practices relating to the visiting of infants and small children in hospitals by parents. The theoretical basis was controversial in many ways. He broke with psychoanalytic theories which saw infants&#x27; internal life as being determined by fantasy rather than real life events. Some critics profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of &quot;privation&quot; (no primary attachment figure) and &quot;deprivation&quot; (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, a failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that may affect children in institutions.

The monograph was also used for political purposes to claim any separation from the mother was deleterious to discourage women from working and leaving their children in daycare by governments concerned about maximising employment for returned and returning servicemen. 

In 1962, WHO published &quot;Deprivation of maternal care: A Reassessment of its Effects&quot; to which Mary Ainsworth, Bowlby&#x27;s close colleague, contributed with his approval, to present the recent research and developments and to address misapprehensions. This publication also attempted to address the previous lack of evidence on the effects of paternal deprivation.

According to Rutter, the importance of Bowlby&#x27;s initial writings on &quot;maternal deprivation&quot; lay in his emphasis that children&#x27;s experiences of interpersonal relationships were crucial to their psychological development.

==Development of attachment theory==
In his 1988 work &quot;A Secure Base&quot;, Bowlby explained that the data was not, at the time of the publication of &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot;, &quot;accommodated by any theory then current and in the brief time of my employment by the World Health Organization there was no possibility of developing a new one&quot;. He then went on to describe the subsequent development of attachment theory. Because he was dissatisfied with traditional theories, Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infant&#x27;s tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure. &quot;Bowlby realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud.&quot; Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the &quot;deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect&quot; in &quot;Maternal Care and Mental Health&quot; in his later work &quot;Attachment and Loss&quot; published in 1969.

== Ethology and evolutionary concepts ==
From the 1950s, Bowlby was in contact with leading European ethologists, namely Niko Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz, and Robert Hinde. Bowlby was inspired by the study Lorenz conducted on goslings, showing that they imprint on the first animate object they see. Bowlby was encouraged by an evolutionary biologist, Julian Huxley, to look further into ethology to help further his research in psychoanalysis as he introduced Bowlby to the impactful work by Tinbergen on &quot;The Study of Instinct&quot;. Bowlby followed this guidance and became interested in ethology as he wanted to rewrite psychoanalysis in order to focus this research field around a concrete theory in which psychoanalysis was lacking. He admired the methodological approach to ethology that psychoanalysis was not familiar with (Van der Horst, 2011). From reading widely in ethology, Bowlby was able to learn that ethologists supported the theoretical ideas through concrete empirical data.

Using the viewpoints of this emerging science and reading extensively in the ethology literature, Bowlby developed new explanatory hypotheses for what is now known as human attachment behaviour. In particular, on the basis of ethological evidence he was able to reject the dominant Cupboard Love theory of attachment prevailing in psychoanalysis and learning theory of the 1940s and 1950s. He also introduced the concepts of environmentally stable or labile human behaviour allowing for the revolutionary combination of the idea of a species-specific genetic bias to become attached and the concept of individual differences in attachment security as environmentally labile strategies for adaptation to a specific childrearing niche. Alternatively, Bowlby&#x27;s thinking about the nature and function of the caregiver-child relationship influenced ethological research, and inspired students of animal behaviour such as Tinbergen, Hinde, and Harry Harlow.

One of Harlow&#x27;s students, Stephen Suomi, wrote about the contributions Bowlby&#x27;s made to ethology, including that Harlow brought attachment research into animal research specifically with rhesus monkeys and various other species of monkeys and apes. Another contribution according to Suomi was that Bowlby influenced animal researchers to examine separation in animals. Furthermore, Suomi wrote that Bowlby brought to the field of ethology the acknowledgement of the consequences over time from different attachment styles that are prevalent in rhesus monkeys (specifically in the work of Harlow). According to Suomi, &quot;Although Bowlby was a psychoanalyst by formal training, he was a true ethologist at heart&quot;.

Van der Horst, Van der Veer, and Van IJzendoorn write:Bowlby spurred Hinde to start his ground breaking work on attachment and separation in primates (monkeys and humans), and in general emphasized the importance of evolutionary thinking about human development that foreshadowed the new interdisciplinary approach of evolutionary psychology. Obviously, the encounter of ethology and attachment theory led to a genuine cross-fertilization.

==&quot;Attachment and Loss&quot; trilogy==

Before the publication of the trilogy in 1969, 1972 and 1980, the main tenets of attachment theory, building on concepts from ethology and developmental psychology, were presented to the British Psychoanalytical Society in London in three now classic papers: &quot;The Nature of the Child&#x27;s Tie to His Mother&quot; (1958), &quot;Separation Anxiety&quot; (1959), and &quot;Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood&quot; (1960). Bowlby rejected psychoanalytic explanations for attachment, and in return, psychoanalysts rejected his theory. At about the same time, Bowlby&#x27;s former colleague Mary Ainsworth was completing extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in Uganda with Bowlby&#x27;s ethological theories in mind. Her results in this and other studies contributed greatly to the subsequent evidence base of attachment theory as presented in 1969 in &quot;Attachment&quot;, the first volume of the &quot;Attachment and Loss&quot; trilogy. The second and third volumes, &quot;Separation: Anxiety and Anger&quot; and &quot;Loss: Sadness and Depression&quot;, followed in 1972 and 1980 respectively. &quot;Attachment&quot; was revised in 1982 to incorporate recent research.

According to attachment theory, attachment in infants is primarily a process of &quot;proximity seeking&quot; to an identified &quot;attachment figure&quot; in situations of perceived distress or alarm for the purpose of survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about 6 months to two years of age. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to &quot;internal working models&quot; which will guide the individual&#x27;s feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. More specifically, Bowlby explained in his three volume series on attachment (1973, 1980, &amp; 1982) that all humans develop an internal working model of the self and an internal working model of others. The self-model and other-model are built off of early experiences with their primary caregiver and shape an individual&#x27;s expectation on future interactions with others and interactions within interpersonal relationships. The self-model will determine how the individual sees themselves, which will impact their self-confidence, self-esteem, and dependency. The other-model will determine how an individual sees others, which will impact their avoidance or approach orientation, loneliness, isolation, and social interactions. In Bowlby&#x27;s approach, the human infant is considered to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur.

As the toddler grows, it uses its attachment figure or figures as a &quot;secure base&quot; from which to explore. Mary Ainsworth used this feature in addition to &quot;stranger wariness&quot; and reunion behaviours, other features of attachment behaviour, to develop a research tool called the &quot;strange situation&quot; for developing and classifying different attachment styles.

The attachment process is not gender specific as infants will form attachments to any consistent caregiver who is sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant. The quality of the social engagement appears to be more influential than amount of time spent.

==Darwin biography==
Bowlby&#x27;s last work, published posthumously, is a biography of Charles Darwin, which discusses Darwin&#x27;s &quot;mysterious illness&quot; and whether it was psychosomatic. In this work, Bowlby explained that:

Bowlby pointed out that Darwin suffered a curious denial about his mother&#x27;s death, once writing in a condolence letter &quot;never in my life having lost one near relation&quot; and during a Scrabble-like game when another player added &#x27;M&#x27; to &#x27;OTHER&#x27;, he stared long at the board then cried: &#x27;There&#x27;s no such word as M-OTHER&#x27;.

==Bowlby&#x27;s legacy==

Although not without its critics, attachment theory has been described as the dominant approach to understanding early social development and it has given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children&#x27;s close relationships. As it is presently formulated and used for research purposes, Bowlby&#x27;s attachment theory stresses the following important tenets:
# Children between 6 and 30 months are very likely to form emotional attachments to familiar caregivers, especially if the adults are sensitive and responsive to child communications.
# The emotional attachments of young children are shown behaviourally in their preferences for particular familiar people; their tendency to seek proximity to those people, especially in times of distress; and their ability to use the familiar adults as a secure base from which to explore the environment.
# The formation of emotional attachments contributes to the foundation of later emotional and personality development, and the type of behaviour toward familiar adults shown by toddlers has some continuity with the social behaviours they will show later in life.
# Events that interfere with attachment, such as abrupt separation of the toddler from familiar people or the significant inability of carers to be sensitive, responsive or consistent in their interactions, have short-term and possible long-term negative impacts on the child&#x27;s emotional and cognitive life.

A mountain in Kyrgyzstan has been named after Bowlby.

<text>Margaux (; ) is a former commune in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the new commune Margaux-Cantenac.

==Geography==
The village lies in the Haut Médoc wine making region on the left bank of the Garonne estuary, northwest of the city of Bordeaux.

==Population==
==Wines==
Margaux is the name of the wine appellation d&#x27;origine, Margaux AOC, that encompasses the village and the neighbouring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac, and is the most southerly of Médoc&#x27;s appellations. The commune makes almost entirely red wine.

The 1855 classification contained more wines from Margaux than from any other appellation, and its best-known vineyard, Château Margaux, was one of only four wines to be awarded the Premier Cru status.

==Cultural references==

The singer-songwriter and oenologist Al Stewart released an album of songs involving wine in 2000 called &quot;Down in the Cellar&quot;, of which one track is entitled &quot;Waiting for Margaux.&quot;

In the movie Withnail &amp; I, the character Uncle Monty brings a bottle of &#x27;53 Margaux (&quot;best of the century&quot;) to the cottage in the country.

In the 2009 movie &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) refers to a Margaux 1858 and expresses fascination that an astronomical event can affect the quality of the harvest, referring to the 1858 Margaux being a comet vintage.

In the Masterpiece Series TV show Downton Abbey Season 5 Episode 9, A conversation between Carson and Mrs. Hughes... Carson states &quot;They didn&#x27;t finish this and they are away tomorrow, so I thought we might. It&#x27;s favorite of mine.&quot; &quot;You won&#x27;t go far wrong with a Margaux&quot; as he pours from a decanter left over from upstairs.

In &#x27;The Final Gambit&#x27; by Jennifer Lynn Barnes, Marguax is mentioned when Avery finds a photograph of three women in the pool as a clue left by Tobias Hawthorne.

<text>John Campbell Elliott, (August 25, 1872 – December 20, 1941) was a Canadian lawyer and politician.

== Early life ==
He was born in Ekfrid, Ontario, the son of George Elliott and Jane Campbell. He was educated at the University of Trinity College in the University of Toronto, studied law at Osgoode Hall and was called to the bar in 1896.

== Career ==
J. C. Elliott was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1908 as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for the London, Ontario area riding of Middlesex West and a member of the Ontario Liberal Party. The Liberals were out of government for the entire time Elliott was an MLA. In 1919, he ran in the first Ontario Liberal Party leadership convention, coming in a poor third, and left provincial politics shortly afterwards.

Elliott moved to federal politics a few years later winning a seat in the House of Commons of Canada in the 1925 federal election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Middlesex West. In March 1926, he was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet by William Lyon Mackenzie King as Minister of Labour. In September of that year, he was moved to the position of Minister of Public Works, and remained in that portfolio until the Liberal government&#x27;s defeat in the 1930 election.

Elliott was personally re-elected and sat on the Opposition benches until the Liberals returned to power in the 1935 election. Elliott was returned to Cabinet, this time as Postmaster-General. In 1940, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada where he sat until his death the next year.

== Personal life ==
J.C. Elliott was a member of a Baptist church, never married and had no issue. Elliott was a District Deputy in the Masonic Order.

<text>Aero Boero S.A. is an Argentine aircraft manufacturer, established in 1956 by Héctor Boero in Morteros in Córdoba Province. It manufactured a range of light civil utility and agricultural aircraft.

==History==
The company began as a repair and maintenance facility for light aircraft. Since the major civil aeronautical activity in the area in the 1950s was crop-dusting, most of the company&#x27;s activities centered on agricultural aircraft. By 1958 the company principals felt they could build aircraft which could be used in such applications, and a trio of designers, brothers Cesar and Héctor Boero and Celestine Barale, began work on the -95. They continued upgrading and adding models until the middle of 2000, when a combination of political instability and economic downturn caused the company to cease aircraft production. Since that time the company has continued providing repair services and supplying spare parts for aircraft in the field.

== List of aircraft produced ==
Several of the models listed below are (or were) manufactured in several variants:
*Aero Boero AB-95 – Single-engine three-seat high-wing monoplane civil utility aircraft with 100 hp engine
*Aero Boero AB-115 – Development of AB-95 with 115 hp engine and improved aerodynamics
*Aero Boero AB-150 – Development of AB-115 with 150 hp engine
*Aero Boero AB-180 – Development of AB-115 with 180 hp engine
*Aero Boero AB-210 – Development of AB-115 with 210 hp engine and tricycle undercarriage. One built
*Aero Boero AB-260 – Development of AB-115 with 260 hp engine and tricycle undercarriage. One built
*Aero Boero 260AG – Single-engine single-seat low-wing monoplane aerial application aircraft

<text>Chanting the Light of Foresight (&quot;imbas forasnai&quot;) is a 1987 composition by Terry Riley written for and commissioned by the Rova Saxophone Quartet, though during the course of the composition it was decided that Rova would compose &quot;The Chord of War&quot; and &quot;The Pipes of Medb/Medb&#x27;s Blues&quot; contains improvisation.

The piece is based on the &quot;Taín Bó Cuailnge&quot; (The Cattle Raid of Cooley, translated by Thomas Kinsella), a part of the eighth-century Ulster Cycle of heroic tales.

The work is partly in resonant intonation, requiring false fingerings, jaw manipulations, and straining the lips and lungs, and contains many unusual time signatures. &quot;The Tuning Path&quot; and &quot;The Pipes of Medb&quot; progresses from simple to more complex areas of tuning, statically depicting night on the battlefield. &quot;Medb&#x27;s Blues&quot; is in the form of a 6 bar 10/4 blues where players alternately keep a cantus firmus while others improvise. &quot;Song Announcing Dawn&#x27;s Combat&quot; depicts foster brothers and main character adversaries Cúchulainn and Ferdia and uses 7/8 rhythms, pulsing drones, and Hindustani scales to refer to the Bhagavad Gita. Ferdia is killed by his brother with a secret weapon, &quot;gae bolga&quot;, which Cúchulainn removes from the body while lamenting in &quot;Ferdia&#x27;s Death Chant&quot;. Cúchulainn completes his training under Scáthach as a warrior and shaman, and she chants to him his future through the imbas forasnai through repeated phrases containing 8/8 and 7/8 measures. Only the first chord of the Rova-composed section does not appear throughout the rest of the piece. Riley responded to Rova&#x27;s concern for this by saying, &quot;Well — that&#x27;s the chord of war.&quot;

In Social Studies, students learn about geography skills such as map reading and longitude and latitude, state history, and early American history. Fourth grade is also the year that most U.S. students learn about their own state&#x27;s history.

In science, most common topics include the rock cycle, fossils, erosion, electricity, forces and motion, light, and heat. Other topics may be taught depending on the school districts or state&#x27;s curriculum.

In English, kids learn skills about reading, writing, and vocabulary. These skills include finding a story&#x27;s theme, comparing and contrasting, citing textual evidence, main idea, writing objective summaries, writing narratives, writing research reports, writing explanatory essays, writing persuasive and argumentative pieces, figurative language, prefixes, suffixes and context clues.

==Spain&#x27;s equivalent==
In Spain, &quot;Primaria&quot; (6 to 12 years old) is compulsory for all children. 4th grade is called &quot;cuarto de Primaria&quot; or simply &quot;cuarto curso&quot;. &quot;Primaria&quot; starts at six years old, so students usually start 4th grade on the year of their tenth birthday.

<text>Saint-Estèphe (; ) is a commune in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.

==Geography==
The village lies northwest of Bordeaux.

==Population==
==Wine==

Saint-Estèphe is best known as the northernmost, and one of the four major wine-growing appellations of the Médoc. The area is separated from Château Lafite-Rothschild in Pauillac to the south by the Jalle de Breuil stream and its vineyards cover around on the banks of the Gironde estuary.
The grounds of St.-Estèphe are varied centered in Château Phélan-Ségur. To the south-east corner of the appellation area, they are similar to those of Pauillac, with deep gravels lying on a hard sandstone base. Progressively to the west and north, they get more clayey, less gravelly, and become heavier. In parts, veins of &quot;alios&quot; (a reduced form of iron) can be found.
The layers of gravel on top of clay lead to comparatively poor drainage, and the harvest is one of the latest of the whole region, although this water retention can be of use in vintages of low rainfall.

<doc id="1065956" wikidata="Q43791171" url="?curid=1065956" title="Seventh grade">
<text>Seventh grade (also 7th Grade or Grade 7) is the seventh year of formal or compulsory education. The seventh grade is typically the first or second year of middle school. In the United States, kids in seventh grade are usually around 12–13 years old. Different terms and numbers are used in other parts of the world.

==Around the world==

===United States===
In the United States, in mathematics, 7th grade students begin to go more into pre-algebra or the beginnings of algebra including ratios, proportions, and percentages. New topics sometimes include scientific notation, concepts with negative numbers or integers, and more advanced geometry. Some schools allow advanced students to take an Algebra I course instead of following the standard 7th grade math curriculum.

In social studies, advanced pre-Civil War History is taught. Though American history is usually the most common, other cultures and time periods may be taught, including state and capital history (in, for example, Texas and South Carolina), European history (in Connecticut and New Jersey), and Civics (in Florida).

<doc id="1065970" wikidata="Q3773734" url="?curid=1065970" title="Brain–body mass ratio">
<text>Brain–body mass ratio, also known as the brain–body weight ratio, is the ratio of brain mass to body mass, which is hypothesized to be a rough estimate of the intelligence of an animal, although fairly inaccurate in many cases. A more complex measurement, encephalization quotient, takes into account allometric effects of widely divergent body sizes across several taxa. The raw brain-to-body mass ratio is however simpler to come by, and is still a useful tool for comparing encephalization within species or between fairly closely related species.


== Brain–body size relationship ==
Brain size usually increases with body size in animals (i.e. large animals usually have larger brains than smaller animals); the relationship is not, however, linear. Small mammals such as mice may have a brain/body ratio similar to humans, while elephants have a comparatively lower brain/body ratio.

In animals, it is thought that the larger the brain, the more brain weight will be available for more complex cognitive tasks. However, large animals need more neurons to represent their own bodies and control specific muscles; thus, relative rather than absolute brain size makes for a ranking of animals that better coincides with the observed complexity of animal behaviour. The relationship between brain-to-body mass ratio and complexity of behaviour is not perfect as other factors also influence intelligence, like the evolution of the recent cerebral cortex and different degrees of brain folding, which increase the surface of the cortex, which is positively correlated in humans to intelligence. The noted exception to this, of course, is swelling of the brain which, while resulting in greater surface area, does not alter the intelligence of those suffering from it.

=== Relation to metabolism ===

The relationship between brain weight and body weight of all living vertebrates follows two completely separate linear functions for cold-blooded and warm-blooded animals. Cold-blooded vertebrates have much smaller brains than warm-blooded vertebrates of the same size. However, if brain metabolism is taken into account, the brain-to-body relationship of both warm and cold-blooded vertebrates becomes similar, with most using between 2 and 8 percent of their basal metabolism for the brain and spinal cord.

== Comparisons between groups ==


Dolphins have the highest brain-to-body weight ratio of all cetaceans. Monitor lizards, tegus and anoles and some tortoise species have the largest among reptiles. Among birds, the highest brain-to-body ratios are found among parrots, crows, magpies, jays and ravens. Among amphibians, the studies are still limited. Either octopuses or jumping spiders have some of the highest for an invertebrate, although some ant species have 14–15% of their mass in their brains, the highest value known for any animal. Sharks have one of the highest for fish alongside manta rays (although the electrogenic elephantfish has a ratio nearly 80 times higher—about 1/32, which is slightly higher than that for humans). Treeshrews have a higher brain to body mass ratio than any other mammal, including humans. Treeshrews hold about 10% of their body mass in their brain.

Generally speaking, the larger the animal, the smaller the brain-to-body mass ratio is. Thus, large whales have very small brains compared to their weight, and small rodents like mice have a relatively large brain, giving a brain-to-body mass ratio similar to humans. One explanation could be that as an animal&#x27;s brain gets larger, the size of the neural cells remains the same, and more nerve cells will cause the brain to increase in size to a lesser degree than the rest of the body. This phenomenon can be described by an equation of the form E = CSr, where &quot;E&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are brain and body weights, &quot;r&quot; a constant that depends on animal family (but close to 2/3 in many vertebrates), and &quot;C&quot; is the cephalization factor. 

It has been argued that the animal&#x27;s ecological niche, rather than its evolutionary family, is the main determinant of its encephalization factor &quot;C&quot;. In the essay &quot;Bligh&#x27;s Bounty&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould noted that if one looks at vertebrates with very low encephalization quotient, their brains are slightly less massive than their spinal cords. Theoretically, intelligence might correlate with the absolute amount of brain an animal has after subtracting the weight of the spinal cord from the brain. This formula is useless for invertebrates because they do not have spinal cords, or in some cases, central nervous systems.

== Criticism ==
Recent research indicates that, in non-human primates, whole brain size is a better measure of cognitive abilities than brain-to-body mass ratio. The total weight of the species is greater than the predicted sample only if the frontal lobe is adjusted for spatial relation. The brain-to-body mass ratio was however found to be an excellent predictor of variation in problem solving abilities among carnivoran mammals.

In humans, the brain to body weight ratio can vary greatly from person to person; it would be much higher in an underweight person than an overweight person, and higher in infants than adults. The same problem is encountered when dealing with marine mammals, which may have considerable body fat masses. Some researchers therefore prefer lean body weight to brain mass as a better predictor.

<doc id="1065985" wikidata="Q1025202" url="?curid=1065985" title="Cadillac Mountain">
<text>Cadillac Mountain is located on Mount Desert Island, within Acadia National Park, in the U.S. state of Maine. With an elevation of , its summit is the highest point in Hancock County and the highest within of the Atlantic shoreline of the North American continent between the Cape Breton Highlands, Nova Scotia, and peaks in Mexico. It is known as the first place in the continental U.S. to see the sunrise, although that is only true for a portion of the year.

==History==
Cadillac Mountain was originally inhabited by the Wabanaki People or the &quot;People of the Dawn Land.&quot; The Wabanaki Confederacy consists of four tribes: Maliseet, Mi&#x27;kmaq, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot. Mount Desert Island provided the Wabanaki with a place to meet, trade, fish, and hunt. Before its name Green Mountain, it was thought the natives referred to the mountain as the Passamaquoddy word Pesamkuk. Additional research indicates that Pesamkuk refers to Mount Desert Island in general, and the name of the mountain itself was Wapuwoc, meaning &quot;white mountain of the first light.&quot;

In the 1500s, the natives were confronted with European colonization; however, they withstood the confrontation and continue to inhabit the land today.

Before being renamed in 1918, the mountain had been called Green Mountain. The new name honors the French explorer and adventurer Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac. In 1688, De la Mothe requested and received from the Governor of New France a parcel of land in an area known as Donaquec which included part of the Donaquec River (now the Union River) and the island of Mount Desert in the present-day U.S. state of Maine. Antoine Laumet de La Mothe, a shameless self-promoter who had already appropriated the &quot;de la Mothe&quot; portion of his name from a local nobleman in his native Picardy, thereafter referred to himself as Antoine de la Mothe, sieur de Cadillac, Donaquec, and Mount Desert.
From 1883 until 1893 the Green Mountain Cog Railway ran to the summit to take visitors to the Green Mountain Hotel. The hotel burned down in 1895 and the cog train was sold and moved to the Mount Washington Cog Railway in New Hampshire.

The summit also played a significant role during World War II as a base for early-warning warcraft detection. The mountain&#x27;s height and location made it the ideal place for a radar facility to achieve strong signals. Today the mountain continues to be used for communication by the police, National Park Service, Coast Guard, and fire department.

==Overview==
There are various hiking trails and a paved road that lead to the summit of Cadillac Mountain. Going to the summit to see the first sunrise in the continental U.S. is a common activity; however, Cadillac only experiences the first sunrise from October 7 through March 6. For a few weeks around the equinoxes, the sun rises first at West Quoddy Head in Lubec, Maine. During the remainder of spring and throughout summer, the sun rises first on Mars Hill, to the northeast.

<text>Eighth grade (also 8th Grade or Grade 8) is the eighth year of formal or compulsory education in the United States of America. The eighth grade is the second, third, or fourth (and typically final) year of middle school. Students in eighth grade are usually 13–14 years old. Different terms and numbers are used in other parts of the world.

==United States==

In the United States, 8th grade is usually a child&#x27;s eighth year of education, aside from kindergarten and preschool. It is often the final year of middle school. Some students take English 1 and or Algebra 1 which are high school classes.

==India==
In India, 8th grade is the last grade before high school. 8th grade exam is the second last year the respective school will be setting the examination. In India, 8th class education falls under the middle education system and the curriculum for 8th grade students typically includes subjects such as mathematics, science, social studies, languages and elective subjects.

<text>Saint-Julien-Beychevelle (; ) is a commune on the left bank of the Garonne estuary in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.

==Population==
==Wine==

The village lies northwest of Bordeaux and is considered by some to be the most underrated of the four major wine growing appellations of the Médoc.

The of vineyards around the villages of St-Julien and Beychevelle produce wine of relative lightness and balance. Its strength stems from the quality of its soil – the characteristic layer of gravel forcing the roots of the vine to go to extra depth to reach its nutrients, as well as retaining additional heat to see it through the cooling winds from the Atlantic away to the west.

St-Julien contains no First Growths but it does have estates ranked as Second, Third and Fourth Growths in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.

<text>The Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope is a radio telescope in the Ahr Hills (part of the Eifel) in Bad Münstereifel, Germany. Inaugurated in 1972, for 29 years the Effelsberg Radio Telescope was the largest fully steerable radio telescope on Earth, surpassing the Lovell Telescope in the UK. In 2000, it was surpassed by the Green Bank Observatory&#x27;s Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, US, which has a slightly larger elliptical 100 by 110-metre aperture.
== Geography ==
The telescope is located about 1.3 km northeast of Effelsberg, a southeastern part of the town of Bad Münstereifel in North Rhine-Westphalia. It is less than 300 m west of the 398 m high Hünerberg, which is in neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate. The boundary is a stream, the Effelsberger Bach, which runs only a few metres east of the telescope. The Effelsberger Bach is 6.5 km long, flowing from the Effelsberger Wald into the Sahrbach, which in turn flows south and into the Ahr river.

A hiking path leads past the telescope; in 2004 part of this was turned into a planet trail with information panels about the Solar System with its planets. The trail ends at the 39 cm model of the Sun next to the visitor centre.

== Radio telescope ==
The Effelsberg radio telescope is operated by the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, the radio astronomy institute of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft. It was constructed from 1968 to 1971 and inaugurated on 1 August 1972. A major technical difficulty in building a radio telescope of 100 m diameter was how to deal with the deformation of the mirror due to gravity when it is rotated to point in a different direction. The mirror must have a precise parabolic shape to focus the radio waves, but a conventionally-designed dish of this size would &quot;sag&quot; slightly when rotated so the mirror loses its parabolic shape. The Effelsberg telescope uses a novel computer-designed mirror support structure which deforms in such a way that the deformed mirror will always take a parabolic shape. The focus will move during such deformation, and the feed antenna suspended in front of the mirror is moved slightly by the computer control system as the telescope is rotated to keep it at the focus. Tests after completion of the telescope showed that the intended accuracy of the mirror surface of 1 mm had not only been met, but exceeded significantly.

About 45% of the observing time is available to external astronomers. The Effelsberg 100-m telescope was involved in several surveys, including the one at 408 MHz (73 cm) by Haslam et al.

<doc id="1066006" wikidata="Q43265577" url="?curid=1066006" title="Third grade">
<text>Third grade (also 3rd Grade or Grade 3) is the third year of formal or compulsory education. It is the third year of primary school. Children in third grade are usually 8–9 years old.

== Examples of the American syllabus ==
In mathematics, students are usually introduced to multiplication and division facts, place value to thousands or ten thousands, and estimation. Depending on the elementary school, third grade students may even begin to work on long division, such as dividings in the double digits, hundreds, and thousands. Decimals (to tenths only) are sometimes introduced. Students begin to work on problem-solving skills working to explain their thinking in mathematical terms.
*In science, third grade students are taught basic physics and chemistry. Weather and climate are also sometimes taught. The concept of atoms and molecules are common, the states of matter, and energy, along with basic chemical elements such as oxygen, hydrogen, gold, zinc, and iron. Nutrition is also sometimes taught in third grade along with chemistry.
*Social studies sometimes begins a study of the culture of the United States and basic idea of the early part of the United States from the time of the Native Americans to the Civil War. Outward expansion and the gold rush are covered.
*In reading and language arts, third grade students begin working more on text comprehension by using informational articles or different genre books than decoding strategies. Students also begin reading harder chapter books. They read and distinguish between a variety of book genres: realistic fiction, non-fiction, poetry, fantasy, historical fiction, science fiction and folktales. Kids learn reading, vocabulary, and writing strategies such as finding main idea, finding theme, citing textual evidence, compare and contrast, nouns, verbs, context clues, writing narratives, writing research reports, writing explanatory essays, and writing persuasive and argumentative pieces.

* Grade 3 students learn how to work on projects on their own and with others. This may start as early as second grade and first grade as well. Social skills, empathy and leadership are considered by some educators to be as important to develop as the academic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic.
* Although more common in the past than today, many students begin writing in cursive at this grade level. In some schools, cursive writing is taught in earlier grades such as in second grade.

Common Core State Standards were launched in 2009, which lay out all of the above curriculum for each grade level.

==Australian equivalent==

In Australia, this level of class is called Year 3. Children generally start this level between the ages of eight and nine.

== Brazilian equivalent ==
In Brazil, third grade is the &quot;terceiro ano do Ensino Fundamental I&quot;, in this case, children begin their first year of elementary school at age 6 or 7 depending on their birthdate. Therefore, the 3rd year of elementary school is typically for students of 8 (96 months)–9 years (108 months) of age. All children students must be 8 years old before the cut-off date.

<doc id="1066015" wikidata="Q1084342" url="?curid=1066015" title="Patty (Peanuts)">
<text>Patty is a fictional character featured in the long-running syndicated daily and Sunday comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;, created by Charles M. Schulz. Patty was formerly a major character whose role was reduced in later years; she never developed a distinct personality like Lucy or Sally. She is sometimes confused with Peppermint Patty, a different and later character with a similar name. Patty appeared in the first &quot;Peanuts&quot; strip, with Shermy and Charlie Brown, on October 2, 1950.

Patty is best known as a girl who thinks highly of herself, and because of her self-opinion, she often torments the hapless Charlie Brown. She usually accompanies her best friend Violet and sometimes the abrasive Lucy.

Patty has appeared in numerous &quot;Peanuts&quot; television specials, cinematic films, theatrical plays, and video games.

In the 2015 film &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, her last name is given as Swanson. This name never appeared in the comic strip or in any official Peanuts media during Schulz&#x27;s lifetime and is thus not canon. (Patty Swanson was in fact the name of the real person who partially inspired Peppermint Patty and had also served as the inspiration for the earlier Patty&#x27;s name.)

== History ==
An early conception of the character was created by Schulz for his comic strip &quot;Li&#x27;l Folks&quot; (a precursor to &quot;Peanuts&quot;). Schulz then reused the character for &quot;Peanuts&quot;, and there he named her Patty.

Patty was featured in the first &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, on October 2, 1950. In subsequent strips, Patty&#x27;s character developed and she appeared regularly, but she eventually became less and less prominent until her succeeding appearances were reduced to mere cameos. By 1966, Schulz recycled the Patty name for a new character: Patricia &quot;Peppermint Patty&quot; Reichardt. Although the original Patty would make cameo appearances throughout the run of &quot;Peanuts&quot;, she had ceased being a featured character by about 1975.

She continued to make cameo or background appearances until the early 1990s. Her last appearance was a rerun of a 1992 strip which was republished on November 27, 1997. Schulz claimed he drew Patty in the March 2, 1994, strip in which she wants Snoopy to chase rabbits with her (a role previously usually taken by Frieda), although some fans have stated that the girl in the strip in question does not resemble Patty.

Both before and after she receded into the background, Patty usually appeared either with her best friend Violet or with the rest of Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team.

=== Other media ===
Patty made her television debut in the 1965 classic &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, and appeared in many of the succeeding specials and theatrical animated films, the most recent of the specials being &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Blanket, Charlie Brown&quot;. Patty had a major part in the original version of the stage musical &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown.&quot; She also appeared in &quot;The Peanuts Movie,&quot; a computer-generated movie based on the strip.

== Character outline ==

As the only female character in the strip&#x27;s very earliest days, Patty often acted as a sort of hen, looking out for the younger characters; however, she also set the tone for the strong female characters in the Peanuts universe. In her (and the strip&#x27;s) second appearance, Patty is shown walking down the sidewalk reciting &quot;Little girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice.&quot; She then punches Charlie Brown in the face and, without missing a beat, continues &quot;That&#x27;s what little girls are made of!&quot;

Patty&#x27;s name was first mentioned on October 26, 1950, 24 days after her first appearance. She was apparently the oldest child in the strip (possibly along with Violet and Shermy), as she attended school when Charlie Brown did not (strip of September 18, 1951). Eventually, she, along with Violet, became best known for their social snobbery and combined cruelty to Charlie Brown, although Violet was generally the more dominant of the two (thus Patty&#x27;s role, in her later appearances, was reduced to that of a yes-girl). Patty is also known for asking Pig-Pen why he is constantly so dirty. In the 2015 film &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, Patty shows a crush towards Pig-Pen.

Patty&#x27;s hair color is light brown (sometimes red, black, or blonde) and she customarily wears a checked dress with a matching bow in her hair, usually colored orange (colored light green in &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;), and Mary Janes shoes.

Patty&#x27;s birthday is December 4, but the strip from October 20, 1954, seemingly contradicts this, indicating that her birthday is October 21. She plays outfield on Charlie Brown&#x27;s baseball team; though in an early strip she was seen as catcher before Schroeder was introduced. It is Patty who first introduces Charlie Brown to Schroeder, who she said lived next door to her.

==Portrayals==
Patty appeared as one of six characters in the original 1967 off-Broadway production of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; (played by Karen Johnson). The character in the original musical was actually a composite of Patty, Frieda (who forces Snoopy to chase rabbits), and possibly Violet. By the time the show was revived on Broadway in the late 1990s, the composite Patty was replaced with Sally, since Patty had ceased making regular appearances in the strip decades earlier.

<text>Moulis-en-Médoc (, literally &quot;Moulis in Médoc&quot;; ) is a commune in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France.

==Geography==
The village is situated in the Médoc on a hill, overhanging the Tiquetorte stream, which flows into the Gironde estuary.

Districts: &quot;Le Bourg, Bouqueyran, Grand-Poujeaux&quot;...

==History==
Vineyards have been cultivated in Moulis at least as far back as Roman times, as three Gallo-Roman establishments have already been discovered. The grape variety biturica is from this era, an ancestor of the variety. The term &quot;biture&quot; meaning &quot;booze-up&quot;, relating to &quot;ivresse&quot; or &quot;intoxication&quot; comes from this variety of grape.

During the Middle Ages, the Médoc was the granary of Bordeaux. This is demonstrated by the presence of numerous mills to grind the grain. It is from the term &quot;Moulin&quot; that Moulis takes its name: &quot;Moulinis&quot;. The vineyards of the era belonged to some feudal proprietors and a religious community which the Roman Church controlled.

In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Haut Médoc, the vine was planted inside rather than at the edge of the estuary to avoid detrimental effects caused by humidity from the river and fog, which can decay and decimate the vineyards.

The vineyards developed quickly in the eighteenth century. The quality of the land was not left unaffected by merchants from Bordeaux, who had made their fortune in the business of islands and invested in Moulis.

The French Revolution did not help the vineyard, but it recovered quickly, reaching its peak at the end of the nineteenth century with an area of 1,500 hectares, before being decimated by the Phylloxera aphid.

==Population==

==Administration==
Moulis-en-Médoc is a commune in the wine-producing area of Médoc. The commune produces wine with a great reputation which benefits from the appellation of Moulis, one of the six communal appellations of the Haut-Médoc vineyards. While not forgetting the classification in 1855 - the best properties of the appellation - such as Château Chasse-Spleen, the Château Poujeaux, the Château Brillette, the Châteaux Antonix, the Château of Dutruch Grand Poujeaux, the Granins Grand Poujeaux Château, the Maucaillou Château, the Biston Brillette Château or even the Moulin à Vent Château, have all made a name amongst the biggest wines of Médoc, notably thanks to the classification of the Crus Bourgeois.

==Sights==
* The Church of Saint-Saturnin. It stands on an early Christian site and is a beautiful example of Romanesque art. This church was named for the first time in 1268 in &quot;Recognitiones feodorum&quot; in Aquitania, a set of administrative texts for the Duke of Aquitaine, then the King of England.. It is dedicated to the Saint Saturnin, the first bishop of Toulouse, who died a martyr around the year 250
* Archaeological excavations have found sarcophagi dating from the early Christian ages, which are evidence of early Christian settlements in the South West of France.
* The Maucaillou Château is home to a &quot;museum of wine and vineyard art and artefacts&quot;.

The only heir of the castle, Darko Moulis, lives in Croatia.

In England and Wales, the first year of primary school is called reception, with pupils 4 to 5 years old. However, the first compulsory school year is Year One, when children are five. As most primary schools have a reception class which is treated like a compulsory school year, i.e. the children wear a uniform and have the same school hours, most children start school in reception. The first grade is the equivalent of Year Two.

Scottish pupils usually enter the corresponding stage one year younger. In Northern Ireland. they are two years younger. In Scotland, first grade is equivalent to Primary 3. Pupils in Primary 3 are 7 to 8 years old. Scotland these grades primary school, as Primary 1 starts after kindergarten (nursery school) at 4 to 5 years of age. Primary school continues through Primary 7.

In arithmetic, students learn about addition and subtraction of natural or whole numbers, usually with only one digit or two digits, and about measurement. Basic geometry and graphing may sometimes be introduced. Clock and calendar time, as well as money, may also be in the curriculum.

In language arts, first graders are taught the fundamentals of literacy, including reading sentences, writing very simple statements, and mastery of the alphabet, building on what they have learned in kindergarten or other forms of pre-school. Expectations for first grade have changed due to Common Core Standards. The curriculum is typically based on standards developed by educators in each state. Most states use the Common Core Standards, so most schools across the country use similar curricula. First graders are expected to read and comprehend stories ranging in length and difficulty. They are also expected to show an improved fluency rate during the school year, with the ability to easily read stories by the end of the year.

Students are also typically introduced to the concept of social studies, with an emphasis on establishing ideas of history or civics in either a personal or larger sense. Some states focus on the basics of US history and patriotism, with a focus on the Founding Fathers and the time period surrounding the American Revolution; other states require social studies focus on family relationships in first grade, leaving community, state, and national studies to higher grades. Basic geography is also taught in the first grade. Focus on the school&#x27;s municipal area and culture, along with basic state geography, is also be focused upon in first grade in some states. First-grade science classes usually involve the discussion of matter, plant and animal science, earth materials, and balance and motion, along with the human body and basic health and nutrition.

Science as inquiry is taught and practiced in first grade classes. Students are encouraged to observe the world around them and begin asking questions about things they notice.

=== Africa ===

*In Sudan, children usually start grade 1 at the age of 6 or 7.
*In South Africa, children start grade 1 at the age of 6 or 7, depending on their curriculum (whether CAPS or Cambridge schooling system, etc).

=== Oceania ===

In some states in Australia, first grade is called Year 1. It is the second year of school after Kindergarten (called Prep in some states), and children are usually between 6 and 7 years old when entering.

In New Zealand, first grade is called &quot;Year 2.&quot; Children generally start this level when they are 6 or 7 years old.

=== South America ===
In Brazil, first grade is the &quot;primeiro ano do Ensino Fundamental I&quot;. That is, the minimum age for first grade was changed from 7 (84 months) to 6 years (72 months) when the &quot;alphabetization&quot; grade, called simply Alfabetização (literacy), was renamed first grade, with all following grades renamed as well. All students must be 6 years old before an assigned cut-off date.

In Uruguay, first graders are usually six years old. However, regulations stipulate that students must be six years old before April 30 in that given year.

<doc id="1066024" wikidata="Q7039258" url="?curid=1066024" title="Ninth grade">
<text>Ninth grade (also 9th grade or grade 9) is the ninth or tenth year of formal or compulsory education in some countries. It is generally part of middle school or secondary school depending on country. Students in ninth grade are usually 13-15 years old, but in some countries are 15–16.

==Afghanistan==

In Afghanistan, ninth grade is the third year of secondary school, which starts in seventh grade. Under the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan, education up to ninth grade (about age 15) was compulsory. In 2013, it was noted that students were generally gender-segregated by ninth grade, with female students taught by female teachers.

In 2021, the Taliban abolished the 2004 constitution and banned female students from attending secondary school. In March 2022, the Taliban announced that secondary schools would reopen for girls but closed them again very soon after.

==Canada==

In most of Canada, Grade 9 is either the last year of junior high school or the first year of high school depending on province and students are typically about age 15. In Quebec, however, Grade 9 is the middle year of its five-year high school program.

==Denmark==

In Denmark, grade 9 (around age 16, also called form level 9) is the final year of compulsory education, and grade 10 is optional. Public comprehensive schools up to grade 10 are called &quot;Folkeskole&quot;. Grade 9 subjects include Danish, English, Christian studies, history, social studies, mathematics, geography, biology, physics/chemistry and German and French as electives. Students must sit compulsory school-leaving exams at the end of grade 9, and must also complete a mandatory project assignment during the year.

After grade 9, students have the option of attending general or vocational upper secondary education for two or three years until they are around 19.

==Finland==

In Finland, ninth grade is the last year of compulsory schooling. Students are generally aged around 16 when they finish 9th grade. They can then go on to attend vocational or academic high schools (generally for 3 years).

==Germany==

In Germany, grade 9 (about age 15) is generally the last year of lower secondary school and the end of compulsory full-time education. Qualifications gained in this year will determine the student&#x27;s eligibility for academic or vocational upper secondary school.

==India==

Following the National Education Policy 2020, ninth grade in India is the first year of high school (generally ages 14 to 15). The intention of the new policy for ninth and tenth grade is to encourage multidisciplinary study, with students having greater flexibility and choice of subjects. Generally ninth grade is the preparatory year for secondary school certificate exams in tenth grade. Schools are affiliated with various curriculum and education boards which set required subjects based on the national curriculum; for example, students attending CBSE schools must take five compulsory subjects (English, Hindi, mathematics, social sciences and science) and may take up to four electives.

==Kuwait==

In Kuwait, ninth grade is the last year of intermediate school and students are usually around 14 years old. At this level, the school district runs standardized tests at the end of the second and fourth quarters of the year, and students will be promoted to grade 10 (the first year of secondary school) if they achieve at least 50% in each subject. Under the Constitution of Kuwait, all Kuwaitis are entitled to a free education until the end of secondary school, but a large percentage of the population is non-Kuwaiti and not covered by this requirement. There are also no legal rules preventing students from dropping out at age 15, after completing ninth grade.

==Mexico==
In Mexico, ninth grade is the last year of &quot;Educación Secundaria&quot; (lower secondary education). Schooling up to ninth grade became compulsory in 1992, although some areas (particularly rural and indigenous communities) still have low participation rates. It is the last year of basic education in Mexico, and students are generally aged 14–15.

Students will either take an academic program (&quot;secundaria general&quot;), a vocational and technical program (&quot;secundaria técnica&quot;) or a distance program (&quot;telesecundaria&quot;). All programs include courses on Spanish, English, mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, history, civics, geography, arts, other languages and sometimes specialised subjects specific to local areas (for example, indigenous languages). , just over half of students were enrolled in &quot;secundaria general&quot;, around 27% in &quot;secundaria técnica&quot;, and the remainder in &quot;telesecundaria&quot;.

After completing ninth grade, students will be awarded a &quot;Certificado de Educación Secundaria&quot;. No examinations are required to graduate.

==Norway==

In Norway, ninth grade is the middle grade of lower secondary school, called &quot;ungdomsskole&quot; (ages 13 to 16). Education up to tenth grade is mandatory for Norwegian students, and courses must align with the national curriculum. Although students must take national standardised tests in numeracy and reading in ninth grade, the results do not affect progression to tenth grade or to admission to upper secondary school.

==Pakistan==

In Pakistan ninth grade is the first year of secondary education, which may be general (four years) or vocational (two years). Students are generally 14–15 years old. The country&#x27;s constitution provides for free and compulsory education up to grade 10 (age 16), but in practice only around 30% of children attend high school. In all school grades, boys outnumber girls; in 2017, only 13% of Pakistani girls were still in school at ninth grade level.

At a general school, students choose their subjects at the beginning of ninth grade and then sit Secondary School Certificate examinations in these subjects at the end of tenth grade. Students usually select eight subjects, including four or five compulsory subjects (typically English, Urdu, mathematics, Islamic studies and Pakistan studies) and three electives. Generally the electives will be chosen from one of three different specialised streams: humanities (e.g. geography, economics), science (e.g. biology, chemistry) or technical subjects (e.g. engineering). Passing the exams allows entry into eleventh grade and upper secondary education.

At a technical school, students typically obtain a vocational diploma after sitting exams at the end of tenth grade, in subjects including English, a Pakistani language, Islamic studies, physics, mathematics, technical drawing and theory, and practical training for their chosen profession.

Some students, particularly those in rural areas, may attend religious Islamic schools (known as &quot;madrasahs&quot;) which do not have standardised curricula. Some of these schools provide only religious education, while others may include subjects from the national curriculum and equivalent examinations. In 2020 it was announced that &quot;madrasahs&quot; would be required to adopt the national curriculum within four to five years.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, ninth grade was formerly known as third year () until it changed to ninth grade or junior year () on June 2, 2014, upon the start of school year 2014-2015 due to the 9-year implementation process of the K-12 curriculum. Students at this level are usually 14-15 years old.

Before the 2016/17 school year, secondary school covered grades 7 to 10 (high school) and was not compulsory. Due to the implementation process of the K-12, secondary education was extended to cover grades up to 12. Grades 7 to 10 are now junior high school and attendance at this level is free and compulsory.

The subjects covered at junior high school level are the same as those covered at elementary school including Filipino, English, Mathematics, Science, Social Science, Philippine history and culture, physical education and arts. Subjects are taught in English and Filipino, unlike earlier grades which may be taught in students&#x27; native or indigenous languages.

Students can also start at the young age of 13.

==Portugal==

In Portugal, the ninth grade (&quot;nono ano&quot;, &quot;9º ano&quot;) is the last year of the three-year lower secondary school program (). Students are generally around 14 years old. It is followed by the tenth grade, the first year of three-year upper secondary education (). School is free and compulsory in Portugal up to twelfth grade. At the end of the ninth grade, students must take national final exams (&quot;Provas finais nacionais&quot;).

==Sweden==

In Sweden, ninth grade (sometimes also called year 9) is the last year of the upper stage of compulsory education (), sometimes known as &quot;högstadium&quot;. The students are usually 15–16 years old. At the end of ninth grade, students must sit national exams in Swedish, mathematics, English and sciences.

After completing 9th grade, students can attend non-compulsory upper secondary school (&quot;gymnasium&quot;) or take another form of education such as a vocational program. Entrance requirements differ depending on programme but generally students will need to have passed at least their Swedish, mathematics and English exams. Although not compulsory, most Swedish students continue to upper secondary school.

==United States==
In the United States, ninth grade is usually the first year in high school. In this system, ninth graders are also often referred to as &quot;freshmen&quot;. It can also be the last year of junior high school depending on state. The average age for the U.S. 9th grade students is 14 to 15 years. The University of Chicago Consortium on School Research identified in 2017 that passing ninth grade courses is a predictor of high school graduation.

In the math curriculum, ninth graders are usually taught algebra, however they may take geometry or more advanced algebra if they&#x27;ve taken algebra previously. Advanced courses are usually available to ninth graders who are prepared for a more rigorous curriculum, depending on the school district.

In the English curriculum, most schools offer basic courses, advanced courses, and honors courses. The basic course for a ninth grader will often teach the fundamentals of higher-level literature and how to analyze and respond to such literature. More advanced courses may be offered depending on the school district and may focus on one type of literature, such as American literature or British literature, and may be taken instead of or in addition to standard classes. Students may begin to study some of the works of William Shakespeare, such as &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;

In the social studies curriculum, there are a variety of different courses that may be offered depending on school district. For example students may take a geography class, a government class, or a world history class.

In the science curriculum, ninth grade students are required, in most areas, to take biology. But they can take different courses before they take Biology such as Integrated Science.. Other forms of sciences such as basic physical science or earth sciences could also be part of the curriculum as well, depending on the school district.

Typically, ninth-graders will be required to earn a minimum number of credits, usually six or seven carnegie units or roughly five classes per year depending on state, in order to advance to tenth grade.

<text>Listrac-Médoc (; ) is a commune in the Gironde department in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region in southwestern France.

==Geography==
The commune is situated in the Médoc on the Route nationale 215, between Bordeaux and Le Verdon-sur-Mer.

==Population==
==Wine==
Lying northwest of the city of Bordeaux, the village is best known as one of the six appellations of the great wine-growing regions of the Médoc. In a region where a mere can be the difference between a great wine and an average one, its distance from the beneficial effect of the Garonne means that its wines are not as highly rated as those of the other appellations. Nonetheless, it is home to many vineyards whose blends of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc can age over a long period.

<text>Tenth grade (also 10th Grade or Grade 10) is the tenth year of formal or compulsory education. It is typically the second year of high school. In many parts of the world, students in tenth grade are usually 15 or 16 years of age.

==Australia==

For most Australian states, Year 10 is the fourth year of a student&#x27;s high school education. However, in the Northern Territory, it is the first year of senior school, which occurs after high school. While in contrast, in most South Australian public schools, it is the third year of high school.

==Finland==
In Finland tenth grade is usually known as the first year of high School (&quot;Lukio&quot; in Finnish and &quot;Gymnasiet&quot; in Swedish). The tenth grade may also refer to an extra year of primary school (&quot;kymppiluokka&quot; in Finnish which literally translates to &quot;tenth grade&quot;). This extra year of primary school is for those without a post-primary school study position or who need some more time to decide on their future.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, &quot;Year 11&quot; is the equivalent of tenth grade, with students aged 15 or 16 during the years. It is the third year of secondary school and the eleventh year of compulsory education. Year 11 is also the first year of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), the main national qualification for secondary school students in New Zealand. Students in Year 11 study English (or Te Reo Māori), mathematics, and a minimum of four elective subjects with a science subject highly recommended. Some schools also offer NCEA alternatives, like the International General Certificate of Secondary Education. 
==Philippines==
In the Philippines, Grade 10 or Senior Year (), is the last year of Junior High School and the fourth year of High School curriculum. Students enrolled in Grade 10 are usually 15–16 years old. Student can also starts as young age education usually on female students than male students at the age of 1-15 years old. This is where they prepare to enter Senior High School.

It was formerly named as &quot;4th Year&quot; or &quot;Year IV&quot; () until it changed to &quot;Grade 10&quot; on June 1, 2015 upon the start of school year 2015-2016 due to the 9-year implementation process of the K-12 curriculum. It was also the last year of the &quot;High School&quot; () stage, as well as basic compulsory education in the country.

There is also the &quot;Citizen Army Training&quot;, a basic military education and training program similar to the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps for college students. As in conscription and ROTC, the program is not mandatory.

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===

For education in England and Wales, this is known as Year 11.
General education certificates will be awarded if the pupils sit the end of year examinations, called GCSEs. In Year 11, students take their GCSEs. With grades ranging from 9 to 1, and the grade below 1 being U, these exams show proficiency in a range of subjects. Results of at least five 5 grades are considered a pass and many employers require their staff to have at least 5s in GCSE, including English and Maths. GCSEs are taken in May and June. Pupils may then go on to sit &#x27;A&#x27; Levels. A new English Baccalaureate has been introduced; this is awarded to students who achieve a 9 to 5 in five subjects: English (literature and language), maths, science (either combined science (2 GCSEs) or three from physics, chemistry, biology and computer science), a humanities subject (history or geography) and a modern or ancient language.

==United States==
The tenth grade is typically the second year of high school, called sophomore year.

In the U.S. curriculum for social studies, tenth grade students are taught recent world history or American history. In some districts, Advanced Placement coursework, such as geography, European history, Global studies, or United States History are offered.

<doc id="1066030" wikidata="Q3304533" url="?curid=1066030" title="Eleventh grade">
<text>Eleventh grade (also known as 11th Grade, Grade 11, or Junior year) is the eleventh year of formal or compulsory education. It is typically the 3rd year of high school. Students in eleventh grade are usually 16–17 years of age.

==Australia==
In Australia, Year 11 is the twelfth year of education and fifth year of high school education. Although there are slight variations between the states, most students in Year 11 are aged around fifteen, sixteen, or seventeen. In Queensland, Year 11 students are the youngest in the country, as they usually enter at age fifteen.

In New South Wales, Year 11 is the shortest year as it only lasts three whole terms. Students commence Year 12 in Term 4 instead of completing a fourth term of Year 11.

Year 11 is followed by Year 12, the final year of high school.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, students get admitted in the 11th grade after passing the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations. Educational institutions offering the 11th–12th grade education are known as colleges. To study in the 11th grade, students must choose one of the three streams. (i.e., science, humanities, business studies.)

==Belgium==
In Belgium, the 11th grade is called &quot;5e secondaire&quot; in the French speaking part of the country, &quot;5de middelbaar&quot; in the Dutch speaking part and &quot;5te sekundäre&quot; in the German speaking part of Belgium.

== Brazil ==
In Brazil, the eleventh grade is the &quot;segundo ano do ensino médio&quot;, meaning &quot;second grade of high school&quot;. Students tend to be 16 years old.

==Bulgaria==
In Bulgaria, the 11th grade is the penultimate year of the high-school (gymnasium) stage. Students tend to be 17–18 years old.

==Canada==
In all provinces and territories except Quebec, a student continues to Grade 12 to complete their high school (or secondary) education. In Quebec, Grade 11 (sec. 5) is the final year of secondary education, followed by CEGEP (college), a pre-university level unique to Quebec.

== Colombia ==
In Colombia, all eleventh-grade students are required to complete an internship, known as alphabetisation, to distinguish it from university-level internships. These internships typically focus on community service, with students engaging in activities such as teaching in schools, assisting in hospitals, or supporting libraries.

Additionally, students must take the ICFES National Test, a standardized exam required for graduation and higher education admission. They are also required to present themselves for the Colombian Army draft. However, since most eleventh-grade students are 16–17 years old, the army cannot legally recruit them due to age restrictions. In most cases, participation in the draft process is substituted by paying a monetary fee.

== Egypt ==
Among Egyptian students it is called تانية ثانوي (tanya thanawy), which means &quot;the second year of secondary school&quot;. In this year, students have the choice to enter either the scientific or literature section. In the scientific section, applied mathematics, biology, chemistry and physics are studied, while in the literature section, history, geography, philosophy and psychology are studied. Both sections study Arabic, foreign languages and mathematics as common subjects between them. After finishing 3 years of secondary school, students can apply to a college depending on their chosen section.

==Finland==
In Finland there are three years of high school. 11th grade is the second.

==France==
The equivalent is the Première, which is the penultimate year of Secondary education in France (followed by the Terminale).

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, 11th grade is called Form 5. Students attending local schools in Hong Kong will study four core subjects in preparation for the HKDSE. (Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination) These include Chinese language, English language, mathematics, and citizenship and social development. 

==India==
In India, the 11th Grade is the first year of higher secondary education and is often considered the third year of high school (Higher/Senior Secondary School or Senior High School). It is commonly known as &quot;Class 11&quot; or &quot;Plus 1&quot; (derived from &quot;10+1&quot;) and, in some states, as the first year of Junior College (Intermediate or Pre-University Course). Other regional names include Intermediate 1st Year, HSC (Higher Secondary Certificate), FJYC (First Year Junior College), and 1st PUC (1st Year Pre-University Course).

During this year, students choose one of three academic streams for specialized study: Science, Commerce, or Arts/Humanities. The Science stream includes core subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology/Mathematics/Applied mathematics, and English or a Modern (Indian/Foreign) language, with optional subjects such as Computer science, Information technology, Psychology, and Biotechnology. The Commerce stream covers Accountancy/Financial Studies, Business Studies/Business Administration, and Economics, with optional subjects like Mathematics, Entrepreneurship, and Marketing. The Arts/Humanities stream offers languages, social studies (History, Political Science, Geography, Economics), and optional subjects such as Psychology, Fine Arts, and Computer Science. Students typically select five to nine subjects, including a compulsory language, an optional subject, and a vocational subject, though offerings vary by institution.

Stream selection may depend on school-conducted model exams, influencing future university studies. While students can switch from Science to other streams during the year, the reverse is usually not allowed. Additionally, students begin preparing for national and state-level entrance exams, which are taken after completing the 12th Grade.

==Indonesia==
In Indonesia, after appearing for Class X Boards, the students opt for the programs they want to study.

There are three programs:
* Science, which comprises physics, chemistry and biology
* Social, which comprises economy, geography and sociology
* Language, which comprises foreign languages, Indonesian literature and anthropology

In Ireland, it is Fifth Year or Cúigú Bhliain of Secondary School. (for 15 to 17-year-olds, as there is an optional year beforehand) In this year, students prepare for their Leaving Certificate.

==Lebanon==
11th Grade is also known as grade 11 or premiere. Students are divided into either scientific (which then proceeds to become life science [LS or SV]) or general science (GS or SG) in grade 12, as well as economics (ES or SE) which proceeds to become economics (ES or SE) or humanities (H) in grade 12. The choice of division is done according to grades and sometimes according to what the student wants to do in college. A student can go from scientific to economics later in grade 12, but not the opposite.

==Nepal==
In Nepal, students complete their SEE boards. Afterwards, they used to start 11th Grade as starting of &quot;college level education&quot;. It is now considered higher secondary education. Students can take in 3 different streams, plus 2. (11, 12)

* Science
* Arts
* Management

Mathematics, social studies, Nepali, and English are compulsory subjects in all streams, but the students can opt to take one subject between math and social.

==Palestine==
In 11th Grade, ages of the students average at around 16–17. 11th Grade is when Palestinian students do their final tests for most of the subjects for their high school diploma.

Many students consider it to be the hardest, and most stressful year. In most schools, they do the final test for every subject besides English, math, and Arabic.

==Malaysia==
In Malaysia, 11th grade also known as Form 5 in secondary school. The students at this stage are 17 years old, and it is the fifth and last year in the secondary school. (compare to Form 6/12th grade) This year is critical as the students in this stage sit for one of the biggest and most important national exams; the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) Exam. This is a crucial exam that determines the future of the student. (Form 6, A-Levels, foundation, or Diploma) Some of them even start work immediately after their SPM.

==Mexico==
In some parts, 11th Grade is the second year of high school. Most students enter this grade at the age of 16, but some might enter as early as 15 or as late as 17.

==Norway==
In Norway, the eleventh year of education is the first year of &quot;Videregående skole&quot;, equivalent to high school. It is not referred to as the 11th Grade, but rather the first grade of &quot;Videregående,&quot; or VG1. Although &quot;Videregående skole&quot; is not compulsory for Norwegians, approximately 93% of people aged 16–18 enroll. There is no upper age limit for starting or finishing &quot;Videregående skole&quot;, but students cannot enroll earlier than the year they turn 16.

**Agri-Fishery arts
**Home economics
**Industrial arts
**Information Communications Technology (ICT)
**TVL Maritime
* Sports track
* Arts and design track

Since 13 June 2016, with the start of school year 2016–2017 as part of the K–12&#x27;s 9-year implementation process. Students are usually 16–17 years old. Students can also start at the age of 15–16 years old.

==Russia==
The 11th Grade is final year of secondary education as well as the end of the high school. It is also an examination-al year, when training to USE is being more powerful than in tenth grade. Priority of education in this year is given to repeat the material learned in high school (fifth to tenth years) in mathematics, Russian language, and in exam subjects by pupils&#x27; choice.

==Singapore==
In Singapore, 11th grade is equivalent of Secondary 5 level.

Only people taking N Levels (normal academic levels) will go to secondary 5, those in express streams will take their O levels (ordinary levels) in secondary 4, and then continue to a Junior College for 2 years or Polytechnic for 3 years.

==Spain==
The closest equivalent to the eleventh grade is the first year of Bachillerato. It is for pupils aged 16 to 17. It is a year of many changes when pupils can start to choose what they would like to study in the future at university. There are three types of &quot;Bachilleratos&quot;:

Main subjects: Spanish, English, Physical education and philosophy.

Science: math, physics and chemistry and biology and geology (health-orientated degrees) or technical drawing.

Humanities/Sociology: Latin and Greek or math oriented for sociology and economy, history and literature.

Arts: music, drama class, design, history of art.

==Sweden==
This is the first year of Upper Secondary School.

==United Kingdom==
===England and Wales===

Year 12, or Lower Sixth form, is comparable to the 11th grade in the US. It is the sixth and penultimate year of secondary education. During Year 12, students usually take the first half of three or four A-Level or equivalent subjects. Some students take Advanced Subsidiary Level (AS-Level) exams at the end of Year 12.

Students then enter Year 13 (equivalent to 12th grade) continuing to study three or four A-Levels, with most (65.8%) taking three A-Levels at 18. Successful completion generally results in the award of A-Level qualifications, though BTECs can be received.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, fifth year (of secondary education) or S5 is optional. Pupils will generally sit Higher qualifications which form the core entry requirements for university. It is followed by an optional final sixth year. (also known as S6) The students ages normally range from 16 to 17 in this year.

===Northern Ireland===
The system is similar to the English one at this age. Lower Sixth Form (Year 13) pupils start on a two-year course; at the end of which they will hopefully have gained three &#x27;A&#x27; Levels in their chosen subjects.

==United States==
In the US, a student in the eleventh grade is typically referred to as a junior.

The vast majority of students who are classified as juniors take the SAT Reasoning Test and/or ACT in the second semester of their third year of high school.

Math students usually take algebra II, but classes like trigonometry or precalculus are sometimes offered for students who wish to take Advanced Placement math classes in their fourth, or senior year of high school. Depending on the location, there may be a combination of any of the listed subjects. They may also take easier courses such as algebra I and geometry if they do not have the required prerequisites for the more advanced courses that are listed above. Students who are advanced in mathematics often take calculus or statistics.

In science classes, third-year students are typically taught biology, physics, or chemistry, with a strong emphasis on laboratory work.

In English class, a college-preparatory curriculum commonly includes American literature. Often, English literature is taught in the third year of high school. Key works may include The Glass Menagerie, The Scarlet Letter, The Crucible, The Great Gatsby, Of Mice and Men, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Grapes of Wrath, and works by authors like Jonathan Edwards, Amy Tan, and Lorraine Hansberry.

In a social studies curriculum, third-year students in the United States are typically taught US history, often covering the period from the 1870s to the 21st Century. These courses may also be taught in ninth or tenth grade. Students may also explore more advanced world culture and geography, as well as other social sciences such as psychology, economics, sociology, and government.

Many high school third-year students in the United States choose to take a foreign language, even though it is not always required in all secondary school curricula.

While normally followed by twelfth grade, some colleges will accept excelling students out of this grade as part of an early college entrance program. Alternatively, some students may choose to graduate early through standardized testing or advanced credits.

<text>Walter Edward Harris (14 January 1904 – 10 January 1999) was a Canadian politician and lawyer.

Harris was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Ontario riding of Grey-Bruce in the 1940 election by defeating Agnes MacPhail. Despite being a newly-elected MP, he enlisted in the military, served for four years, and saw action in France during World War II.

He served as parliamentary secretary to Louis St. Laurent when he was Secretary of State for External Affairs in the Mackenzie King cabinet. He continued as parliamentary secretary to St. Laurent when he became Prime Minister of Canada in 1948 to 1950, when St. Laurent brought Harris into the Canadian Cabinet.

Harris served as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration until 1954, when he was promoted to Minister of Finance. He was Finance Minister during a period of great economic growth. During his term of office, he introduced the regulations permitting Registered Retirement Savings Plans, which have become a staple of the financial planning of millions of Canadians.

Before his 1956 budget speech, a journalist from the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; played a joke on a colleague from &quot;La Presse&quot; by pretending that he had received an advance copy of the budget by mistake. Harris was informed of that and began to draft a letter of resignation until he was informed that the whole story was a prank.

Harris also served as Government House Leader from 1953 to 1957 and thus had to try to manage the government&#x27;s dealings on the floor of the House of Commons during the 1956 Pipeline Debate. The government imposed closure on debate resulting in an outraged parliamentary opposition that complained of &quot;tyranny&quot; and public complaints that the government was acting in an arrogant manner. Harris became a casualty and lost his seat in the 1957 election that brought John Diefenbaker to power.

In 1958, he attempted a move to provincial politics and ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. He led on the first ballot of the Ontario Liberal leadership convention but was defeated by fewer than fifty votes by John Wintermeyer on the third ballot. Following his defeat, Harris retired from politics and returned to his law practice. He was also president and later chairman of Victoria and Grey Trust.

== Heritage ==
The public library in Markdale, Ontario, is named after Walter Harris. There is also a school named after him in Oshawa, Ontario that is part of the Durham District School Board and offers French Immersion.

There is a Walter Harris fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<doc id="1066040" wikidata="Q986388" url="?curid=1066040" title="Twelfth grade">
<text>Twelfth Grade (also known as 12th Grade, Grade 12, Senior Year, Standard 12, 12th Standard, 12th Class, or Grade of the 12th) is the twelfth and final year of formal or compulsory education. It is typically the final year of secondary school and K–12 in most parts of the world. Students in twelfth grade are usually 16-18 years old. Some countries have a thirteenth grade, while other countries do not have a 12th grade/year at all.

==Australia==
In Australia, the twelfth grade is referred to as Year 12. In New South Wales, students are usually 16 or 17 years old when they enter Year 12 and 17 or 18 years during graduation (end of year). A majority of students in Year 12 work toward getting an ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank). Up until the start of 2020 the OP (Overall Position, which applies only to students in the state of Queensland) was used. Both of these allow/allowed them access to courses at university. In Western Australia, this is achieved by completing the WACE; in South Australia, this is achieved by completing the SACE; in Victoria, this is achieved by completing the VCE; in the Australian Capital Territory, this is achieved by completing the AST and in New South Wales this is achieved by completing the HSC.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, educational institutions offering the 11th–12th grade education are known as colleges. In the 12th grade, students study in one of the three streams: science, humanities, and business studies. After completing 12th grade, they have to sit for the Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examinations.

==Finland==
The twelfth grade is the third and usually last year (a fourth-year is possible) of high school or secondary school (or Gymnasium). The students graduate from high school at around 18, with some 17 or 19. The twelfth grade is shorter than previous because the twelfth graders&#x27; lessons end in February and they go on to take their final exams shortly afterward. Compulsory education ends after the twelfth grade, and it is completely optional for a student to continue into fourth-year.

==France==
The equivalent grade in France is Terminale. It is the third and last year of lycée (the French equivalent to high school), whereby students must sit a test called the Baccalauréat to complete the year. French-language schools that teach the French government curriculum (i.e. are part of the AEFE network) use the same system of grades as their French counterparts. This is not compulsory, as education in France is only compulsory until students turn 16.

==Lebanon==

In Lebanon, twelfth grade is the third year of high school, also referred to as the third year of higher secondary education, the class of seniors, or the last class of the school. Students in twelfth grade in Lebanon are between the ages of 17 and 18.

==Netherlands==

In the Netherlands, senior year is named by the school level. From low to high: &quot;VMBO&quot;, &quot;HAVO&quot; and &quot;VWO&quot;. VMBO is composed of four years, with 12th grade being the fourth (4th) and final year. A higher school level is the HAVO, which lasts for five years. The highest school level is VWO, which lasts for six years. So at the HAVO, students are considered senior if they are in &quot;5th class&quot;, whereas at VWO, in &quot;6th class&quot; respectively. The last year mainly focuses on preparing for the final exams, after which students should be ready to go to college or university. Usually, 4th and 5th grade students are aged 16 to 17 and those who are in 6th grade usually are aged 17 to 18.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, 12th grade is known as Year 13 (New Zealand students attend 13 years of school, starting at the age of 5). Students in Year 13 are usually 17–18 years old. This is the last year of secondary school. In Year 13, students complete NCEA Level 3, which involves getting a certain number of &#x27;credits&#x27; from different external exams and other internal assessments. Students must gain 80 achieved credits or higher (20 of which are taken from Level 2) to pass the year.

==Philippines==

In the Philippines, Grade 12 or Ultimate Year is the final year of Senior High School and High School curriculum under the new K–12 that was first implemented on April 24, 2012, as part of the curriculum&#x27;s 9-year implementation process from May 20, 2008, to June 5, 2017. It is also the last year of high school, and the basic and compulsory education in the country before graduates choose to enter tertiary education (e.g. college or university, which are both used interchangeably), entrepreneurship, or employment. Students are usually 17–18 years old.

The last school year to fully use the 1945–2017, or K–10 system, was SY 2011–2012. Kindergarten was made obligatory, which served as a requirement for the implementation of K–12 and process of phasing out the K–10 on April 24, 2012, and part of the K–12&#x27;s 9-year implementation process. The other grades are still the same as before (Grade 1 to Fourth Year), while the last to use this system is SY 2016–2017. By the said school year, Grade 6 is the only grade that is still under the 1945 K–10 system, while the rest are now under K–12.

Subjects on Grade 12 are enrolled on a semestral basis as in Grade 11. Afterwards, Grade 12 students will take the last National Achievement Test called the &quot;Basic Education Exit Assessment&quot;, although this is not a requirement for graduation or college enrollment. Finally, graduation rites are held, being the next grade to do so after Grade 6 for elementary school graduates.

==United Kingdom==

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, &quot;Year 13&quot; (or &quot;upper Sixth&quot;) is the last year of A-Level certifications which are completed to finalize a student&#x27;s last academic year. Students are usually 16–17 in Year 12 and 17–18 in Year 13. While the school leaving age in the rest of the UK is 16 years old, in 2015 education in England became compulsory until the age of 18. After this age, students can leave education if they choose without necessarily completing year 13. Between the ages of 16 and 18, students can either continue in full-time education (for example, at a sixth form college); start an apprenticeship or traineeship; or spend a minimum of 20 hours per week working or volunteering while in part-time education or training. Any education after the age of 18 is then referred to as higher education.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, this is the sixth year (or S6). Sufficiently good marks in 5th year may be adequate for entry into higher education. &#x27;Highers&#x27; are the entry qualifications to university which can be sat in S5, S6 or college, with Advanced Highers equivalent to year one of university.

==United States==
The twelfth grade is the twelfth school year after kindergarten. It is also the last year of compulsory secondary education, or high school. Students are often 16-18 years old, and on rarer occasions, can be 19 years old or older. Many states have a maximum age which free education can be offered, usually but not always age 21. Twelfth graders are referred to as &quot;Seniors&quot;.

===Traditions associated with senior year===
Senior skip day (also known as senior ditch day) is a day during which the seniors do not attend school and skip all their classes. This event/tradition is often not recognized by school administrations and teachers. In some areas it is countered with an officially recognized senior day off, or by allowing graduating seniors to skip their final exams. This official senior day can also be used to sponsor a senior field trip or senior class trip where the class would, for example, go to a theme park, a lake, a resort, the beach, or some other vacation-type activity. Following graduation, many seniors go on senior week, where they spend a week at the beach with their friends.

<text>The Taieri River (a misspelling of the original Māori name &quot;Taiari&quot; ) is the fourth-longest river in New Zealand and is in Otago in the South Island. Rising in the Lammerlaw Range, it initially flows north, then east around the Rock and Pillar range before turning southeast, reaching the sea south of Dunedin.

The upper reaches meander in a series of convoluted loops across a floodplain above Paerau, close to the aptly named locality of Serpentine; the river has created many small oxbow lakes in this area, some of which have been converted into water meadows. From here the river runs through two small hydroelectric power stations before reaching Patearoa in The Maniototo. The Taieri then arcs through almost 180 degrees, entering a broad glacial valley (the Strath-Taieri) surrounded by rugged hill ranges. Immediately downstream the river has cut a steep-sided declivity, the Taieri Gorge. This is known for the Taieri Gorge Railway, which follows a route into Central Otago through it. In the Taieri&#x27;s lower reaches there is a broad floodplain (the Taieri Plains) containing much of Otago&#x27;s most fertile farmland. The river then flows through the lower Taieri Gorge to the Pacific Ocean at Taieri Mouth. Taieri Island lies in the Pacific Ocean several hundred metres from the mouth of the river.

The Taieri is long, of which the last are navigable. Despite its length the Taieri has a minimal amount of water volume compared to other New Zealand rivers with its average discharge being around . Towns along the river include Middlemarch, Outram, Allanton, Mosgiel, Henley, and Taieri Mouth. Its major tributary is the Waipori River, which meets the Taieri near Henley on the Taieri Plains. Google Maps erroneously shows the stretch of the river from the confluence to the mouth as Waipori River. The official correct name is shown on the New Zealand government&#x27;s official NZ Topo Map.

However, while Taieri is the official name of the river, this name is known to be a misspelling of the Te Reo Māori word &quot;Taiari&quot;, meaning &quot;spring tide&quot; or &quot;shining water&quot;.

<doc id="1066080" wikidata="Q1281077" url="?curid=1066080" title="Battle of Elasa">
<text>The Battle of Elasa was fought in April 160 BCE during the Maccabean Revolt between Judean rebels led by Judas Maccabeus (Judah Maccabee) and an army of the Seleucid Empire under the command of Bacchides. The battle resulted in the triumph of the Greek Syrian forces, the defeat of the Maccabees, and the death of Judas Maccabeus.

The leadership of the Maccabees passed to Judas&#x27;s brother Jonathan Apphus (Yonatan), who continued to fight against Bacchides for the remainder of 160 BCE. The Seleucids largely triumphed; control of the cities was restored to them, including Jerusalem, hostages of important Jewish families were taken, and Greek-aligned garrisons were placed around Judea. Despite this setback, unrest continued in the countryside. The Hasmonean sons of Mattathias continued to oppose the government in the following eight years, and eventually succeeded in gaining allies both among Seleucid rulers and the Romans that would allow for autonomy. Judas&#x27;s brother Simon Thassi established an independent Hasmonean kingdom in 142–141 BCE, fulfilling the goal of the Maccabees.

==Primary sources==
The Battle of Elasa is recorded in the book of 1 Maccabees () and in Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; Book 12, Chapter 11. The account in 1 Maccabees is high quality, giving detailed topographic information that makes following the movements of the armies possible, although also focuses on Judas&#x27;s personal actions rather than the army as a whole. It is possible that the author was either an eyewitness or was able to interview someone who was. This episode is also written in a different, more poetic and &quot;epic&quot; style of Koine Greek than the other battles of 1 Maccabees; this makes reconstructing the hypothesized original Hebrew text more difficult for the passages describing Elasa.

Josephus largely paraphrases 1 Maccabees, his main source. He adds in the names of some locations that Judas pitched a camp at such as Arbela and &quot;Bethzetho&quot;, although these may be errors from him not recognizing the more obscure placenames that had been transliterated from Hebrew to Greek. 

==Background==
In 160 BCE, Seleucid King Demetrius I went on campaign in the east to fight the rebellious Timarchus. He left his general Bacchides as a governor of the western part of the empire. Bacchides led an army into Judea on a second expedition, having visited the province earlier in late 162 / early 161 BCE. The Seleucid army carried out a massacre of Jews in the Galilee and marched south to Judea after. This tactic would force Judas to respond in open battle, lest his reputation be damaged by inaction and Alcimus&#x27;s faction gain strength by claiming he was better positioned to protect the people from future killings. Bacchides then took a route toward Jerusalem that likely surprised the Maccabees: the arduous route through Mount Beth El, which required climbing an arid mesa. The Seleucids, possibly with an element of surprise, approached &quot;Berea&quot; next to set up their camp. Berea may be a corruption of Beera/Birra (modern Al-Bireh) and was just south of Beth El. A mere kilometer (.6 miles) away, Judas and a Maccabee army camped at Elasa.

Bacchides&#x27; army is recorded as 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. The size of the rebel army facing them is disputed; 1 Maccabees implausibly claims that Judas&#x27;s army at Elasa was tiny, with 3,000 men of which only 800 (1 Maccabees) or 1,000 (Josephus) would actually fight. Historians suspect the true numbers were larger, possibly as many as 22,000 soldiers as a high estimate, and the author downplayed their strength in an attempt to explain the defeat.

==The battle==
The Maccabees and the Seleucids fought on the plateau between Elasa and Berea. While the terrain there was not perfectly flat, its slope is still open and gentle enough to allow satisfactory use of phalanx tactics, which likely favored the experienced Seleucid heavy infantry. The Seleucids deployed with cavalry on their flanks, a heavy infantry phalanx in the center, and skirmishers including archers and slingers in front. Bacchides himself commanded from the elite cavalry on the right flank, as was custom in Hellenistic armies. Judas opted to attack the right flank of the Seleucid army hoping to kill the commander, similar to the victory over Nicanor at the Battle of Adasa; the loss of a commander could rattle the entire army. The elite horsemen on the right retreated from the Jewish advance, and the rebels pursued, possibly as far as Baal-hazor (modern Tall Asur) at the foot of the Judaean Mountains. The battle is described as lasting from &quot;morning until evening&quot;, suggesting that the pursuit by Judas&#x27;s force after Bacchides may have lasted some time. This retreat may have been a tactic from Bacchides, however, to feign weakness and draw the Maccabees in where they could be surrounded and defeated, their own retreat cut off. Regardless of whether it was intentional or not, the Seleucids regained their formation and trapped the rebel army with their own left flank of cavalry, which circled around to cut off Judas&#x27;s escape. Judas was eventually killed and the remaining Judeans fled.

Despite the loss, the rebels were somehow able to recover Judas&#x27;s body afterward, unlike Eleazar&#x27;s body after his death. 1 Maccabees reports that Judas&#x27;s brothers Jonathan and Simon accomplished the deed; Josephus reports it was thanks to an agreement with Bacchides afterward. 1 Maccabees, keeping with its theme of connecting the Hasmoneans to figures from earlier Jewish scripture, concludes with a lament for Judas quoting King David&#x27;s lament over the death of King Saul: &quot;How the mighty have fallen!&quot;

==Aftermath==
The Seleucids had reasserted their authority in Jerusalem and the other major cities of Judea. Judas&#x27;s brother Jonathan Apphus (Hebrew: Yonatan) became the new leader of the Maccabees, and continued to skirmish against Bacchides&#x27;s troops. These skirmishes do not appear to have accomplished much; Bacchides fortified the major cities of Judea and took hostages from prominent Jewish families as a guarantee of cooperation. Bacchides is recorded as garrisoning fortresses in Jericho, Emmaus, Beth-horon, Bethel, Timnath, Pharathon, and Tephon. The largest concentration of Greek troops remained at the Acra citadel in Jeruslalem, Beth-zur, and Gazara.

The Hasmonean family suffered another loss when Judas and Jonathan&#x27;s brother John Gaddi, sent to negotiate with the Nabateans who had cooperated with the Maccabees in earlier years of the struggle, was killed by the sons of Jambri, a family that had turned hostile to the Hasmoneans. Bacchides and Jonathan eventually came to a peace deal, but the Maccabees were reduced to where they had started the revolt in 167 BCE: as a guerilla movement based in the countryside. Bacchides returned to Syria in late 160 BCE. Jonathan and his allies later attacked a wedding held by a member of Jambri&#x27;s family, killing many of the attendees, to avenge the loss of his brother John.

==Analysis==
Israeli historian Bezalel Bar-Kochva believes that the Judeans would have had equal numbers to the Seleucids in this battle, that Bacchides&#x27; retreat was feigned in order to lure Judah into a vulnerable position, and that the Seleucid phalanx managed to best the Judean phalanx in a full-scale battle. Bar-Kochva&#x27;s argument is that the author of 1 Maccabees admired Judas greatly, and thus gave Judas an excuse for losing the battle by dramatically downplaying the number of soldiers. However, Bar-Kocvha believes the sources when they say that Judas was a superb military commander, and a superb military commander would not have suicidally charged an army outnumbered 20:1 in open terrain. Additionally, the Jewish force performs a fairly complicated maneuver and pursuit in the battle, which is unlikely to have worked had they been so outnumbered. To Bar-Kochva, it is more likely that the battle was &quot;fair&quot; with similar numbers on each side, and the course of the battle simply went to the Seleucid&#x27;s favor. More generally, if the dating of the Battle of Adasa to 161 BC is accurate, then Judas would have had an entire year to rebuild his army with no recorded outside interference. (If Adasa is seen as happening in 160 BC, then a small Jewish army size makes somewhat more sense.) Bar-Kochva also cites other battles of the Seleucid army in places other than Judea where the Seleucids were adapt at using stratagems such as feigned retreats to lure their enemies into difficult positions, as well as other battles in uneven terrain that the Seleucid phalanx acquitted itself well in. Finally, while very little is described of the composition of the Judean army by 1 Maccabees, various &quot;slips of the pen&quot; suggest that the Jews themselves had their own cavalry and phalanxes; Jewish cavalry would be particularly important in chasing retreating Seleucid cavalry as is described at Elasa, as a long chase with solely infantry would be doomed to fail. In the same way, if the battle at Elasa was long and hard-fought, this indicates the Jews had their own heavy infantry phalanxes which fought the Seleucid center: a clash of light infantry and a phalanx would end much faster and more decisively. 

1 Maccabees records a poetic lament for Judas as he sees his army slipping away. As with Judas&#x27;s other pre-battle speeches and prayers in the book, this is best seen as a free composition by the author, not an actual transcription of Judas&#x27;s words, in the style of Hellenistic historians to invent such dialogue to be more literary. One part of the speech also seemingly does not match Judas&#x27;s other actions: &quot;Far be it from us to do such a thing as to flee from them. If our time has come, let us die bravely for our kindred, and leave no cause to question our honor.&quot; However, Judas fled from lost battles and declined to fight unwinnable battles earlier in the Revolt, such as retreating to the safe hills rather than command the siege of Jerusalem after the defeat at the Battle of Beth Zechariah, or not interfering with Bacchides&#x27; first expedition at all. Judas appeared to be more interested in practical victory than honor.

The Seleucid army is described as having slingers among its vanguard. This is unusual but not considered implausible. The sling was not generally a style that Syrian Greeks themselves trained in, but locals from Coele-Syria did (including the Judeans themselves) if used as auxiliaries, as could mercenaries from various nearby regions — the adjoining territory of Rhodes was particularly renowned for their slingers.

<text>Social Justice in the Liberal State is a book written by Bruce A. Ackerman. The book is an essay in political philosophy, a &quot;new view&quot; of the theoretical foundations of liberalism that will &quot;challenge us to clarify our own implicit notions of liberal democracy.&quot; Ackerman addresses the positive case for a liberalism that glorifies neither the state bureaucracy nor the private market. References to the sphere of relations among states are few, but the breadth of the attack on the fundamental issues of man and society is impressive. To Ackerman, liberalism is a kind of structured conversation in which verbal negotiation among those with differing visions of the good life is an alternative to the exercise of naked power. Ackerman has mounted a profound challenge to contract thinking. It works, crudely, on the idea that the premises of a course of contract reasoning can be manipulated so as to yield (more or less) any conclusion that the theorist has some antecedent interest in producing. The social contract is the contract which would be confirmed by the entire population, under ideal conditions, after perfect and complete consideration. Ackerman has offered a suggestion for determining whether any persons among a genetically diverse group are genetically disadvantaged. His suggestion is that to be genetically undominated, a person must possess a set of abilities that permit him to pursue some life purpose that some persons have, with as much facility as any other person is able to pursue that life purpose. He asserts that every person has a right to be genetically undominated. The privatization of religious convictions is also strongly defended. Ackerman argues for a maximal separation doctrine in that religion does not have an appropriate place in the public realm of a liberal democracy. The book also briefly suggests &quot;responsive lotteries&quot;, prototypes of lottery voting as a way to decide issues but leaves the question hanging in the air by inviting others to devote more serious thought to lottery voting.

<text>In mathematics, a real closed field is a field &quot;F&quot; that has the same first-order properties as the field of real numbers. Some examples are the field of real numbers, the field of real algebraic numbers, and the field of hyperreal numbers.

==Definition==
A real closed field is a field &quot;F&quot; in which any of the following equivalent conditions is true:

#&quot;F&quot; is elementarily equivalent to the real numbers. In other words, it has the same first-order properties as the reals: any sentence in the first-order language of fields is true in &quot;F&quot; if and only if it is true in the reals. 
#There is a total order on &quot;F&quot; making it an ordered field such that, in this ordering, every positive element of &quot;F&quot; has a square root in &quot;F&quot; and any polynomial of odd degree with coefficients in &quot;F&quot; has at least one root in &quot;F&quot;.
#&quot;F&quot; is a formally real field such that every polynomial of odd degree with coefficients in &quot;F&quot; has at least one root in &quot;F&quot;, and for every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;F&quot; there is &quot;b&quot; in &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;a&quot; = &quot;b&quot;2 or &quot;a&quot; = −&quot;b&quot;2.
#&quot;F&quot; is not algebraically closed, but its algebraic closure is a finite extension. 
#&quot;F&quot; is not algebraically closed but the field extension formula_1 is algebraically closed.
#There is an ordering on &quot;F&quot; that does not extend to an ordering on any proper algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot;.
#&quot;F&quot; is a formally real field such that no proper algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot; is formally real. (In other words, the field is maximal in an algebraic closure with respect to the property of being formally real.) 
#There is an ordering on &quot;F&quot; making it an ordered field such that, in this ordering, the intermediate value theorem holds for all polynomials over &quot;F&quot; with degree &quot;≥&quot; 0.
# &quot;F&quot; is a weakly o-minimal ordered field.

== Examples of real closed fields ==

* the field of real algebraic numbers
* the field of computable numbers
* the field of definable numbers
* the field of real numbers
* the field of Puiseux series with real coefficients
* the Levi-Civita field
* the hyperreal number fields
* the superreal number fields
* the field of surreal numbers (this is a proper class, not a set)
==Real closure==
If &quot;F&quot; is an ordered field, the Artin–Schreier theorem states that &quot;F&quot; has an algebraic extension, called the real closure &quot;K&quot; of &quot;F&quot;, such that &quot;K&quot; is a real closed field whose ordering is an extension of the given ordering on &quot;F&quot;, and is unique up to a unique isomorphism of fields identical on &quot;F&quot; (note that every ring homomorphism between real closed fields automatically is order preserving, because &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; if and only if ∃&quot;z&quot; : &quot;y&quot; = &quot;x&quot; + &quot;z&quot;2). For example, the real closure of the ordered field of rational numbers is the field formula_2 of real algebraic numbers. The theorem is named for Emil Artin and Otto Schreier, who proved it in 1926.

If (&quot;F&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) is an ordered field, and &quot;E&quot; is a Galois extension of &quot;F&quot;, then by Zorn&#x27;s lemma there is a maximal ordered field extension (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) with &quot;M&quot; a subfield of &quot;E&quot; containing &quot;F&quot; and the order on &quot;M&quot; extending &quot;P&quot;. This &quot;M&quot;, together with its ordering &quot;Q&quot;, is called the relative real closure of (&quot;F&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) in &quot;E&quot;. We call (&quot;F&quot;, &quot;P&quot;) real closed relative to &quot;E&quot; if &quot;M&quot; is just &quot;F&quot;. When &quot;E&quot; is the algebraic closure of &quot;F&quot; the relative real closure of &quot;F&quot; in &quot;E&quot; is actually the real closure of &quot;F&quot; described earlier.

If &quot;F&quot; is a field (no ordering compatible with the field operations is assumed, nor is it assumed that &quot;F&quot; is orderable) then &quot;F&quot; still has a real closure, which may not be a field anymore, but just a
real closed ring. For example, the real closure of the field formula_3 is the ring formula_4 (the two copies correspond to the two orderings of formula_3). On the other hand, if formula_3 is considered as an ordered subfield 
of formula_7, its real closure is again the field formula_2.

==Decidability and quantifier elimination==
The language of real closed fields formula_9 includes symbols for the operations of addition and multiplication, the constants 0 and 1, and the order relation (as well as equality, if this is not considered a logical symbol). In this language, the (first-order) theory of real closed fields, formula_10, consists of all sentences that follow from the following axioms:

* the axioms of ordered fields;
* the axiom asserting that every positive number has a square root;
* for every odd number formula_11, the axiom asserting that all polynomials of degree formula_11 have at least one root.

All of these axioms can be expressed in first-order logic (i.e. quantification ranges only over elements of the field). Note that formula_10 is just the set of all first-order sentences that are true about the field of real numbers.

Tarski showed that formula_10 is complete, meaning that any formula_9-sentence can be proven either true or false from the above axioms. Furthermore, formula_10 is decidable, meaning that there is an algorithm to determine the truth or falsity of any such sentence. This was done by showing quantifier elimination: there is an algorithm that, given any formula_9-formula, which may contain free variables, produces an equivalent quantifier-free formula in the same free variables, where &quot;equivalent&quot; means that the two formulas are true for exactly the same values of the variables. Tarski&#x27;s proof uses a generalization of Sturm&#x27;s theorem. Since the truth of quantifier-free formulas without free variables can be easily checked, this yields the desired decision procedure. These results were obtained and published in 1948.

The Tarski–Seidenberg theorem extends this result to the following &quot;projection theorem&quot;. If is a real closed field, a formula with free variables defines a subset of , the set of the points that satisfy the formula. Such a subset is called a semialgebraic set. Given a subset of variables, the &quot;projection&quot; from to is the function that maps every -tuple to the -tuple of the components corresponding to the subset of variables. The projection theorem asserts that a projection of a semialgebraic set is a semialgebraic set, and that there is an algorithm that, given a quantifier-free formula defining a semialgebraic set, produces a quantifier-free formula for its projection.

In fact, the projection theorem is equivalent to quantifier elimination, as the projection of a semialgebraic set defined by the formula is defined by
:formula_18
where and represent respectively the set of eliminated variables, and the set of kept variables.

The decidability of a first-order theory of the real numbers depends dramatically on the primitive operations and functions that are considered (here addition and multiplication). Adding other functions symbols, for example, the sine or the exponential function, can provide undecidable theories; see Richardson&#x27;s theorem and Decidability of first-order theories of the real numbers.

Furthermore, the completeness and decidability of the first-order theory of the real numbers (using addition and multiplication) contrasts sharply with Gödel&#x27;s and Turing&#x27;s results about the incompleteness and undecidability of the first-order theory of the natural numbers (using addition and multiplication). There is no contradiction, since the statement &quot;&quot;x&quot; is an integer&quot; cannot be formulated as a first-order formula in the language formula_9.

=== Complexity of deciding 𝘛rcf ===
Tarski&#x27;s original algorithm for quantifier elimination has nonelementary computational complexity, meaning that no tower

:formula_20

can bound the execution time of the algorithm if is the size of the input formula. The cylindrical algebraic decomposition, introduced by George E. Collins, provides a much more practicable algorithm of complexity 
:formula_21
where is the total number of variables (free and bound), is the product of the degrees of the polynomials occurring in the formula, and is big O notation.

Davenport and Heintz (1988) proved that this worst-case complexity is nearly optimal for quantifier elimination by producing a family of formulas of length , with quantifiers, and involving polynomials of constant degree, such that any quantifier-free formula equivalent to must involve polynomials of degree formula_22 and length formula_23 where formula_24 is big Omega notation. This shows that both the time complexity and the space complexity of quantifier elimination are intrinsically double exponential.

For the decision problem, Ben-Or, Kozen, and Reif (1986) claimed to have proved that the theory of real closed fields is decidable in exponential space, and therefore in double exponential time, but their argument (in the case of more than one variable) is generally held as flawed; see Renegar (1992) for a discussion.

For purely existential formulas, that is for formulas of the form 
where stands for either or , the complexity is lower. Basu and Roy (1996) provided a well-behaved algorithm to decide the truth of such an existential formula with complexity of arithmetic operations and polynomial space.

== Order properties ==

A crucially important property of the real numbers is that it is an Archimedean field, meaning it has the Archimedean property that for any real number, there is an integer larger than it in absolute value. Note that this statement is not expressible in the first-order language of ordered fields, since it is not possible to quantify over integers in that language.

There are real-closed fields that are non-Archimedean; for example, any field of hyperreal numbers is real closed and non-Archimedean. These fields contain infinitely large (larger than any integer) and infinitesimal (positive but smaller than any positive rational) elements.

The Archimedean property is related to the concept of cofinality. A set &quot;X&quot; contained in an ordered set &quot;F&quot; is cofinal in &quot;F&quot; if for every &quot;y&quot; in &quot;F&quot; there is an &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot;. In other words, &quot;X&quot; is an unbounded sequence in &quot;F&quot;. The cofinality of &quot;F&quot; is the cardinality of the smallest cofinal set, which is to say, the size of the smallest cardinality giving an unbounded sequence. For example, natural numbers are cofinal in the reals, and the cofinality of the reals is therefore formula_25.

We have therefore the following invariants defining the nature of a real closed field &quot;F&quot;:

* The cardinality of &quot;F&quot;.
* The cofinality of &quot;F&quot;.

To this we may add

* The weight of &quot;F&quot;, which is the minimum size of a dense subset of &quot;F&quot;.

These three cardinal numbers tell us much about the order properties of any real closed field, though it may be difficult to discover what they are, especially if we are not willing to invoke the generalized continuum hypothesis. There are also particular properties that may or may not hold:

* A field &quot;F&quot; is complete if there is no ordered field &quot;K&quot; properly containing &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;F&quot; is dense in &quot;K&quot;. If the cofinality of &quot;F&quot; is &quot;κ&quot;, this is equivalent to saying Cauchy sequences indexed by &quot;κ&quot; are convergent in &quot;F&quot;.
* An ordered field &quot;F&quot; has the eta set property η&quot;α&quot;, for the ordinal number &quot;α&quot;, if for any two subsets &quot;L&quot; and &quot;U&quot; of &quot;F&quot; of cardinality less than formula_26 such that every element of &quot;L&quot; is less than every element of &quot;U&quot;, there is an element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;F&quot; with &quot;x&quot; larger than every element of &quot;L&quot; and smaller than every element of &quot;U&quot;. This is closely related to the model-theoretic property of being a saturated model; any two real closed fields are η&quot;α&quot; if and only if they are formula_26-saturated, and moreover two η&quot;α&quot; real closed fields both of cardinality formula_26 are order isomorphic.

== The generalized continuum hypothesis ==

The characteristics of real closed fields become much simpler if we are willing to assume the generalized continuum hypothesis. If the continuum hypothesis holds, all real closed fields with cardinality of the continuum and having the &quot;η&quot;1 property are order isomorphic. This unique field &quot;Ϝ&quot; can be defined by means of an ultrapower, as formula_29, where M is a maximal ideal not leading to a field order-isomorphic to formula_7. This is the most commonly used hyperreal number field in nonstandard analysis, and its uniqueness is equivalent to the continuum hypothesis. (Even without the continuum hypothesis we have that if the cardinality of the continuum is
formula_31 then we have a unique &quot;η&quot;&quot;β&quot; field of size formula_31.)

Moreover, we do not need ultrapowers to construct &quot;Ϝ&quot;, we can do so much more constructively as the subfield of series with a countable number of nonzero terms of the field formula_33 of formal power series on a totally ordered abelian divisible group &quot;G&quot; that is an &quot;η&quot;1 group of cardinality formula_34 .

&quot;Ϝ&quot; however is not a complete field; if we take its completion, we end up with a field &quot;Κ&quot; of larger cardinality. &quot;Ϝ&quot; has the cardinality of the continuum, which by hypothesis is formula_34, &quot;Κ&quot; has cardinality formula_36, and contains &quot;Ϝ&quot; as a dense subfield. It is not an ultrapower but it &quot;is&quot; a hyperreal field, and hence a suitable field for the usages of nonstandard analysis. It can be seen to be the higher-dimensional analogue of the real numbers; with cardinality formula_36 instead of formula_34, cofinality formula_34 instead of formula_25, and weight formula_34 instead of formula_25, and with the &quot;η&quot;1 property in place of the &quot;η&quot;0 property (which merely means between any two real numbers we can find another).

== Elementary Euclidean geometry ==
Tarski&#x27;s axioms are an axiom system for the first-order (&quot;elementary&quot;) portion of Euclidean geometry. Using those axioms, one can show that the points on a line form a real closed field R, and one can introduce coordinates so that the Euclidean plane is identified with R2 . Employing the decidability of the theory of real closed fields, Tarski then proved that the elementary theory of Euclidean geometry is complete and decidable.

<text>Little Bay de Noc is a bay in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. The bay opens into Lake Michigan&#x27;s Green Bay.

The bay, consisting of approximately 30,000 acres (120 km2), is enclosed by Delta County. The cities of Escanaba and Gladstone are on the west side of the bay and the Stonington Peninsula is on the east side.

The bay&#x27;s name comes from the Noquet (or &quot;Noc&quot;) Native American people (thought to have been related to the Menominee of the Algonquian language group), who once lived along the shores. Douglass Houghton came to Sand Point (in Escanaba) in 1844 with his party of government surveyors to chart the land to the north.

Escanaba has a deep harbor, which made it a lumbering center. The first sawmill was built there in 1836. The bay also shipped iron ore from the rich iron ranges in Michigan&#x27;s upper peninsula, with the first ore dock built at Escanaba in 1864. Escanaba was incorporated in 1866. A bit further north, Gladstone was founded in 1887 by U.S. Senator from Minnesota, William D. Washburn, to serve as a rail-lake terminal for lumber products.

The Escanaba, Days, Tacoosh, Rapid, and Whitefish rivers all drain into the bay. Rapid River marks the mouth of the eponymous river and the head of the bay.

<text>James Edward Hamilton, 4th Duke of Abercorn (29 February 1904 – 4 June 1979), styled Viscount Strabane until 1913 and Marquess of Hamilton between 1913 and 1953, was a British peer. 

==Early life and education==
Abercorn was born in 1904 at 15 Montagu Square, London, the son of James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn, and Lady Rosalind Cecilia Caroline Bingham. He inherited his father&#x27;s peerages on 12 September 1953.

He was educated at Eton and Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Career==
After Sandhurst, Lord Hamilton was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards, where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1946, he was elected to the County Council of County Tyrone, served as High Sheriff of Tyrone, and then served in the Senate of Northern Ireland. He became Lord Lieutenant of County Tyrone on his father&#x27;s death, a position he held for the remainder of his life. He was appointed honorary colonel of the 5th Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (a Territorial Army unit), and died at age 75.

He was active in public life in Northern Ireland. He was chairman of the trustees of the Ulster Museum from 1962–79 and Chancellor of the University of Ulster from 1970-79. He was president of the Royal Forestry Society from 1954-66 and also served as president of the International Dendrological Union (later the International Dendrology Society).

==Marriage and issue==
In 1928, Abercorn married Lady Kathleen Crichton (1905–1990), a daughter of Henry Crichton, Viscount Crichton (1872–1914, son of 4th Earl Erne and father of the 5th Earl Erne) and Lady Mary Cavendish Grosvenor (1883–1959, daughter of the 1st Duke of Westminster).

They had two sons and a daughter:
* Lady Moyra Kathleen Hamilton (1930–2020), maid of honour at the coronation of Elizabeth II
*James Hamilton, 5th Duke of Abercorn (born 1934)
*Lord Claud Anthony Hamilton (born 1939), who was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of County Fermanagh in 1978; he was High Sheriff of Fermanagh in 1990 and was made a Justice of the Peace for the county in 1991.

<doc id="1066136" wikidata="Q4895019" url="?curid=1066136" title="Bert Convy">
<text>Bernard Whalen &quot;Bert&quot; Convy (July 23, 1933 – July 15, 1991) was an American actor, singer, game-show panelist, and host known for &quot;Tattletales&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, and &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;.

==Early life==
Convy was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Bernard Fleming and Monica (née Whalen) Convy. Convy&#x27;s family moved to Los Angeles when he was 7 years old. He later attended North Hollywood High School, where he was an all-around athlete. The Philadelphia Phillies offered him a contract when he was just 17 and he played two years of Minor League Baseball in 1951–52. He later joined the 1950s vocal band The Cheers, who had a top-10 hit in 1955 with &quot;Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots&quot;.

Convy attended UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television, where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

==Career==

===Early years===
After a two-season stint in the Philadelphia Phillies&#x27; minor league system with the Klamath Falls Gems, Miami Eagles, and Salina Blue Jays, Convy began his career in the entertainment business as a featured performer and singer in the &quot;Billy Barnes Revues&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s. Bert portrayed a CBS usher on &quot;Art Linkletter&#x27;s House Party&quot; in 1956. He appeared in the 1961 Warner Bros. drama &quot;Susan Slade&quot;, playing Troy Donahue′s rival for the affections of Connie Stevens. Convy went on to become a Broadway actor, starring as Perchik in the original cast of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1964), appearing in &quot;The Impossible Years&quot; (1965), and creating the role of Cliff Bradshaw in &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1966). He also appeared in the Roger Corman film &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot;, playing Lou Raby, and in the soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot;, playing Glenn Hamilton, a rapist. He also appeared on &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, playing the role of politician Richard Lawrence in the 1972 episode &quot;A Likely Candidate&quot;.

===Game shows===
In the 1960s and 1970s, Convy was a popular semi-regular panelist on several game shows, including &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;Match Game&quot; (he later starred as the host of the pilot for &quot;Match Game &#x27;90&quot; in 1989), and &quot;Password&quot;. He soon took the podium himself as host of several game shows, including the fourth edition of &quot;Password&quot; (called &quot;Super Password&quot;, which ran from 1984–1989) and &quot;Tattletales&quot; (1974–1978, 1982–1984), for which he won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host in 1977. In 1979, he appeared on &quot;Password Plus&quot; with fellow celebrity contestants such as Elizabeth Montgomery, Carol Burnett, Phyllis Diller, Judy Norton Taylor, Marcia Wallace, and Elaine Joyce.

Convy and Burt Reynolds formed their own production company, Burt and Bert Productions, during the 1980s. Their first production was a game show titled &quot;Win, Lose, or Draw&quot;, which made its debut in 1987 as part of the NBC daytime lineup and in nightly syndication. Convy hosted the syndicated edition of &quot;Win, Lose, or Draw&quot; for its first two seasons, then left the show to host another of his company&#x27;s productions, the syndicated &quot;3rd Degree&quot;.

When &quot;3rd Degree&quot; went to pilot, Peter Marshall was brought in to be the host. When the series was picked up for syndication, however, Convy decided to leave his position as the host of the syndicated edition of &quot;Win, Lose, or Draw&quot; and take Marshall&#x27;s place on &quot;3rd Degree&quot;. Marshall filed a lawsuit against Convy for the action, but later dropped it after Convy&#x27;s cancer diagnosis was made public.

In 1989, Convy was called upon by Mark Goodson Productions again to host a week&#x27;s worth of pilot episodes for a revival of &quot;Match Game&quot; that Goodson was attempting to sell to ABC. Convy was supposed to have been the host when the series made it to air in 1990, but had to drop out after being diagnosed with brain cancer. He was replaced by Ross Shafer.

===Acting===
Convy turned to acting full-time in 1956 and was in the musical &quot;The Billy Barnes Revue&quot; in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. He appeared in 10 Broadway shows, including &quot;Nowhere to Go but Up&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot; (in which he originated the role of Cliff, a fictionalized Christopher Isherwood), and &quot;The Impossible Years&quot;. He played reporter Hildy Johnson in a 1969 Broadway revival of &quot;The Front Page&quot;, which starred Robert Ryan. In the original Broadway cast of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; with Zero Mostel, Convy played Perchik the Student and sang &quot;Now I Have Everything&quot;. He filled in for Raul Julia in the lead role of Guido Contini in the Broadway musical &quot;Nine&quot; when Julia went on vacation.

Convy guest-starred in an April 1960 episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; titled &quot;The Case of the Nimble Nephew&quot;. In the 1960–1961 season, Convy guest-starred on Pat O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s short-lived sitcom &quot;Harrigan and Son&quot; and the series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; in the role of David. In 1961, he appeared in the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;Museum Piece&quot;. He portrayed Roxy in the pilot episode of &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot; in 1963, although the role went to Pat Renella for the remainder of the series&#x27; run. He was also cast on an episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; as Mary&#x27;s friend Jack Foster, alongside future &quot;Alice&quot; star Beth Howland. In 1973, Convy was a guest star in two episodes of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. 

In 1974, Convy portrayed Lieutenant Steve Ostrowski, the police officer nephew of elderly amateur sleuths on the short-lived series &quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot;.

Convy attempted a short-lived variety series called &quot;The Late Summer Early Fall Bert Convy Show&quot; in 1976. In 1979, he appeared with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in their eponymous television movie. Throughout his career, Convy was a frequent guest star on series such as &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Silent Force&quot;, &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (including the pilot episode). On &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, Season 2 Episode 11: &quot;Legal Eagles&quot; (1978), he played Danny Holt, a divorced man who falls for his ex-wife&#x27;s lawyer. In 1983, Convy was cast as Neil Townsend on the sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Not Easy&quot;, playing opposite Ken Howard. Convy had joined the project when it was recast after its intended premiere in the 1982–83 season was delayed; he earned the role originally given to Larry Breeding, who was killed in a car accident in September 1982 after the first pilot had been shot.

Convy also starred in several movies, perhaps most memorably &quot;Semi-Tough&quot; (1977), in which he played a caricature of Werner Erhard named Friedrich Bismark. His other film credits included &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; (1959), &quot;Susan Slade&quot; (1961), Philippe de Broca&#x27;s &quot;Les Caprices de Marie&quot; (1970), &quot;&quot; (1977), the horror film &quot;Jennifer&quot; (1978), &quot;Hanging by a Thread&quot; (1979), &quot;Racquet&quot; (1979), &quot;The Man in the Santa Claus Suit&quot; (1979), &quot;Hero at Large&quot; (1980), &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot; (1981), and the television movie &quot;Help Wanted: Male&quot; (1982). Convy tried his hand at directing with the comedy &quot;Weekend Warriors&quot; (1986). In 1980, Convy produced and directed the Goodspeed Musicals premiere of &quot;Zapata&quot;, with music and lyrics by Harry Nilsson and Perry Botkin Jr. and libretto by Allan Katz.

==Personal life==
Convy was married twice. He married Anne Anderson in 1959; together they had three children: Jennifer, Joshua, and Jonah. Convy and Anderson divorced in 1991. Convy married his second wife, Catherine Hills, five months before his death.

==Death==
In April 1990, Convy was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after collapsing while visiting his mother, who had been hospitalized for a stroke. He was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive and mostly deadly brain cancer, which forced him into retirement. On July 15, 1991, Convy died at his home in Brentwood, Los Angeles, eight days before his 58th birthday. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

<text>Thin Lizzy is the debut studio album by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released on 30 April 1971. The album was followed by the EP &quot;New Day&quot;, produced and recorded by Nick Tauber at Decca Studios on 14–17 June 1971 and released on 20 August 1971. The songs from the EP were included in later editions of the album.

== Background and recording ==
In the autumn of 1970, Brian Tuite and Peter Bardon took over the management of Thin Lizzy. Lynott told Tuite: &quot;we&#x27;ve got twelve songs at the moment that we&#x27;d be happy enough to record&quot;. after listening to some of the songs Tuite tried to find a record deal for the band. Since he had a good friendship with Decca Records&#x27;s A&amp;R man, Frank Rodgers, tried to arrange a gig for Thin Lizzy and another of his acts, soul singer Ditch Cassidy. Cassidy lacked his regular band, and so Tuite put Thin Lizzy as his backing band. After watching Thin Lizzy&#x27;s performance at the Zhivago Club on 12 November 1970, Frank Rodgers showed his interest in them rather than Cassidy, and offered them a record deal with Decca; however, Rodgers also suggested another showcase gig for other Decca personnel before signing a contract. This time the band performed their original material. &quot;Look What The Wind Blew In&quot; was one of the songs that caught Rodgers&#x27;s attention. Afterward Tuite travelled to London to meet Decca&#x27;s head of A &amp; R, Dick Rowe. The paperwork was drawn up on 12 November 1970, and on the first day of December, Decca officially signed “Tin Lissy&quot; to a one-year recording contract, with the option of extending the deal by two further periods of one year in September 1971 and September 1972. All going well, they were committed to delivering three albums to the company. The advance was £500, with a further £500 to be paid after the album had been completed. Thin Lizzy left Ireland after an afternoon gig on 3 January 1971 at the Afton Club in Dundalk, to start recording their first album in London&#x27;s Decca Studios. On their way to London, Lynott met John Peel and introduced Thin Lizzy to him; within ten months Peel would be booking the group for a session on his Radio 1 show, on 12 October 1971. The band booked a guesthouse in Sussex Gardens in which to stay during the first album recording. The work began on the Monday morning and was done on Friday evening. Brian Downey says: &quot;We got up at nine in the morning, [went] into the studio, played from about ten or half ten to eight or nine, then clocked off and went back to the guesthouse. Then we did it again, for the whole week&quot;. According to manager Brian Tuite, while working with producer Scott English, Lynott had a fight with him about the bass sound: &quot;Philip fell out a bit with him because Scott wanted to turn down the bass. It got to the stage where I was up in the control room and Scott would say, &#x27;Go down and tell the bass player to turn down.&#x27; He wouldn’t use the [talkback] mike because Phil wouldn&#x27;t do it anyway. So I&#x27;d say to Philip, &#x27;The Bearded One wants you to turn down the bass,&#x27; and he&#x27;d say, &#x27;Tell that fucking Yank to piss off.&#x27; He knew full well the mike would be open.&quot; Eric Bell explained that the band was stoned during the whole process of recording and that he doesn&#x27;t remember anything from the sessions but he remembers Scott English&#x27;s accompaniment with band of giving them bags of weed: &quot;We were permanently stoned. Scott English was this jovial American guy, a nice big bloke. He had this enormous bag of grass in one of the drawers in the studio. He brought it out, threw it on the table and said, &#x27;Help yourselves, boys!&#x27; That was it. I can’t actually remember recording the first album. I didn’t know anything until the end of the record, it was just a haze. Smoking a bit of dope and playing music went hand-in-hand for us. We were just that type of band at that point in time. It seemed to work for us, we got ideas. There was a lot of things on that album that were completely ad-libbed.&quot;

==Reception==
Eduardo Rivadavia, in a retrospective review for AllMusic, described the album as &quot;surprisingly mellow&quot; and wrote that a number of songs sound &quot;confused and unfinished&quot;. However, he did describe &quot;Look What the Wind Blew In&quot; as a &quot;hint of things to come&quot;, and that the bonus track &quot;Dublin&quot; from the &quot;New Day&quot; EP contained &quot;Lynott&#x27;s first great lyric&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff appreciated the experimental flavour of the album &quot;drawing mainly from bluesy non-metal influences&quot; and found the compositions &quot;astonishingly well written, very Irish, very heart-felt&quot;.

==Artwork==
According to Decca&#x27;s record sleeve co-ordinator, John Slater, Phil Lynott came to his office to discuss ideas for the album cover and to explain his ideas: &quot;His first notion was for a burning hand coming out of a freshly dug grave! He wasn&#x27;t interested in doing it with a cartoon twist, it had to be real life.&quot; They decided upon an American automobile theme, but failed to find the right car, so eventually chose a fish-eye photograph of the headlight of &quot;a Vauxhall Victor or something like that.&quot; Lack of communication between Decca and Thin Lizzy resulted in the album cover initially having the wrong spelling of the band&#x27;s name, showing &#x27;Tin Lizzy&#x27;. Philip Tapsfield of the Decca Art Department recalls: &quot;One of our in-house artists, David Ansty, designed their sleeve. He actually did the sleeve with the name &#x27;Tin Lizzy&#x27; instead of &#x27;Thin Lizzy&#x27;.&quot; Decca tried to convince the band to change their name instead of designing the cover again, but the band&#x27;s refusal resulted in the postponement of the album release for a week, while the artwork was being corrected. The band&#x27;s manager Ted Carroll has also stated that another designer, Walt McGuire from Decca American, designed different artwork for the US release, which is now a collector&#x27;s item. The US album cover shows a mini cartoon model of a Ford Model T car (aka Tin Lizzie) driving over a naked female hip, while the back sleeve features various band photos including a fish-eye shot taken in Dublin in autumn 1970, by photographer Roy Esmonde, along with some shots taken in the studio.

==Influence==
The song &quot;Honesty Is No Excuse&quot; was covered by Cass McCombs on his 2013 album &quot;Big Wheel and Others&quot;.

<text>William Horace Marshall (August 19, 1924 – June 11, 2003) was an American actor, director and opera singer. He played the title role in the 1972 blaxploitation classic &quot;Blacula&quot; and its sequel &quot;Scream Blacula Scream&quot; (1973), and appeared as the King of Cartoons on the 1980s television show &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot; and as Dr. Richard Daystrom on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. He was 6‘5” (1.96 m) tall and was known for his bass voice.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===

Marshall was born in Gary, Indiana, to Vereen Marshall, a dentist, and Thelma ( Edwards).

He attended New York University as an art student but transferred to the Actors Studio to study theater. He studied at the American Theatre Wing and with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse.

=== Career ===
Marshall made his Broadway debut in 1944 in &quot;Carmen Jones&quot;. In 1950, he understudied Boris Karloff as Captain Hook in the Broadway production of &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; He played the leading role of De Lawd in the 1951 revival of &quot;The Green Pastures&quot;, a role he repeated in 1958 in a BBC telecast of the play. He performed in several Shakespearean plays on the stage in the U. S. and Europe, including the title role in at least six productions of &quot;Othello&quot;. Harold Hobson of the London &quot;Sunday Times&quot; praised Marshall’s portrayal as &quot;the best Othello of our time.&quot;

In 1968, Marshall joined the Center Theatre Group at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles to play Othello in a jazz musical version, &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;, with Jerry Lee Lewis as Iago.

Marshall portrayed Paul Robeson and Frederick Douglass on stage. He researched Douglass&#x27;s life extensively, and in 1983 produced and played the lead role in &quot;Frederick Douglass: Slave and Statesman&quot;.

=== Film and television career ===
Marshall&#x27;s career on screen began in the 1952 film &quot;Lydia Bailey&quot; as a Haitian leader. He followed that with a prominent role as Glycon, comrade and fellow gladiator to Victor Mature in the 1954 film &quot;Demetrius and the Gladiators&quot;. His demeanor, voice and stature gave him a wide range, though he was ill-suited for the subservient roles that many black actors of his generation were most frequently offered. He was a leader of the Mau-Mau uprising in &quot;Something of Value&quot; (1957), and Attorney General Edward Brooke in &quot;The Boston Strangler&quot; (1968). He was arguably most known for his role in the vampire film &quot;Blacula&quot; and its sequel &quot;Scream Blacula Scream&quot;.

In the early 1950s, Marshall starred briefly in &quot;Harlem Detective&quot;, a series about black police officers. The show was canceled when Marshall was named as a communist in the anti-communist newsletter &quot;Counterattack&quot;.

Despite blacklisting because of his supposed communist connections, Marshall continued to appear in both television and films. He appeared on the British spy series &quot;Danger Man&quot; in episodes titled &quot;Deadline&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Galloping Major&quot; (1964). Marshall played the role of traveling opera singer Thomas Bowers in the 1964 &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;Enter Thomas Bowers,&quot; and that same year he appeared, with actor Ivan Dixon, as the leader of a newly independent African nation and as a T.H.R.U.S.H. agent in the first-season episode of &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; entitled &quot;The Vulcan Affair&quot;, also on the 1964 &quot;Rawhide&quot; episode &quot;Incident at Seven Fingers&quot; where he played a Buffalo Soldier. In 1968, he appeared as Dr. Richard Daystrom in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;. In 1969, he had a special guest appearance as the character Amalek in an episode of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; entitled &quot;The Night of the Egyptian Queen&quot;. He reprised his Othello persona in 1979 on Steve Allen&#x27;s &quot;Meeting of the Minds&quot;.

He won two local Emmys for producing and performing in a PBS production, &quot;As Adam Early in the Morning&quot;, a theatre piece originally performed on stage. He also was featured in an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; titled, &quot;The Jar&quot;, with actors Pat Buttram and George Lindsey.

Marshall played the King of Cartoons on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, replacing actor Gilbert Lewis, during the 1980s.

In 1985, guest starred on &quot;Benson&quot; as Mr. Reaper (death) season 7, episode 4 &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

=== Later life and death ===
In addition to acting and producing, Marshall taught acting at various universities including the University of California, Irvine, and the Mafundi Institute, an African-American arts and music institution in the Watts section of Los Angeles. He did similar work at Chicago&#x27;s ETA Creative Arts Foundation, which in 1992 named Marshall one of its Epic Men of the 20th century.

For 42 years, Marshall was the partner of Sylvia Gussin Jarrico, former wife of blacklisted screenwriter Paul Jarrico. Marshall died on June 11, 2003, from complications arising from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and diabetes. He was survived by sons Tariq, Malcolm, and Claude Marshall and daughter Gina Loring. Eulogists at his funeral included Sidney Poitier, Ivan Dixon, Paul Winfield, and Marla Gibbs.

=== Awards ===
In 1974, Marshall won two local Emmys for producing and performing in a PBS production, &quot;As Adam Early in the Morning&quot;, a theatre piece originally performed on stage.

<text>The vice chief of naval operations (VCNO) is the second highest-ranking commissioned United States Navy officer in the Department of the Navy and functions as the principal deputy of the chief of naval operations. By statute, the vice chief is appointed as a four-star admiral.

==Role==
The senior leadership of the U.S. Department of the Navy consists of two civilians, the secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) and the under secretary of the Navy (USECNAV), as well as the four senior commissioned officers on the two military service staffs: Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) and Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC).

The vice chief is the principal deputy of the chief of Naval operations (CNO). The vice chief may also perform other delegated duties that either the secretary of the Navy or the CNO assigns to him or her. If the CNO is absent or is unable to perform their duties, then the vice chief assumes the duties and responsibilities of the CNO. Within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, while there are several Deputy Chiefs of Naval Operations (DCNOs) of either three or two star rank, there is only one VCNO.

The vice chief is appointed by the president of the United States, and must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. While there is not a fixed term nor a term limit in the statute; the historical precedent is that a vice chief of naval operations serves for a tenure of two to three years.

==Historical background==
The equivalent of the current VCNO position was called Assistant for Operations in 1915, and Assistant Chief of Naval Operations in 1922. In 1942 the title became Vice Chief of Naval Operations.

<doc id="1066168" wikidata="Q1076589" url="?curid=1066168" title="Khors">
<text>Khors is a Slavic god of uncertain functions mentioned since the 12th century. Generally interpreted as a sun god, sometimes as a moon god. The meaning of the theonym is also unknown: most often his name has been combined with the Iranian word for sun, such as the Persian &quot;xoršid&quot;, or the Ossetian &quot;xor&quot;, but modern linguists strongly criticize such an etymology, and other native etymologies are proposed instead.

== Sources ==
Khors is the most frequently mentioned Slavic god, after Perun. He first appears in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; along with other gods to whom Vladimir the Great erected statues:

The second source mentioning the god is &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;: &quot;Prince Vseslav was a judge for his subjects, he distributed cities among princes, but by night he ran like a wolf, from Kiev he ran to Tmutarakan, before the cock crowed, as a wolf he ran along the road of the great Khors.&quot;

God is also mentioned in the apocryphal work &quot;Sermon and Apocalypse of the Holy Apostles&quot;, which mentions Perun and Khors as old men, and Khors is credited with real life in Cyprus. Khors also appears in the apocryphal text &quot;Conversation of the Three Saints&quot;, in which St. Basil, St. Gregory the Theologian, and St. John Chrysostom converse. St. John asks: &quot;What was thunder made from?&quot;, St. Basil replies: &quot;There are two angels of thunder. For this, the ancient Greek Perun, Khors is Jewish. And there are two angels of lightning&quot;. This text combines Slavic, Christian, and Bogomil traditions. He also occurs in other letopis-dependent sources.

=== In proper nouns ===
Mikhail Vasil&#x27;yev cited a number of hydronyms from the Novgorod-Severian region (e.g., Khorsovo swamp, Khorsov reservoir) from the 16th-18th centuries, toponyms in Volhynia from the 10th-12th centuries, or Hŭrsovo in Bulgaria, to the right of the Danube. Andrey Beskov notes that in Borova region (Ukraine), not far from the village of , there was the village of Horsivka, which is now under the Oskol reservoir. Significantly, among the inhabitants of this village were bearers of the surname &quot;Khors&quot;.

God was also to be preserved in the Old Serbian name Хьрсь, Old Bulgarian Хръсъ, Serbian Хрс, &quot;Hrs&quot;, Хрсовик, &quot;Hrsovik&quot;, Old East Slavic Хорсъ in analogy to the Polish name Dadźbóg, from the god Dazhbog. It is also possible that he was preserved in the Old Czech name &quot;Chorúš&quot;. It has been proposed that the Serbian names should be regarded as alterations of the Greek name Χρυσης, &quot;Khrisis&quot;, or Χρυσος, &quot;Khrisos&quot;, but according to Aleksander Brückner this is unwarranted: these names are not Christian names, so there was no reason for the Serbs to adopt them, and Χρυσ- is spelled simply as &quot;khris-&quot;.

== Etymology ==

In Old Russian sources, this theonym is noted as Xърсъ, &quot;Xŭrsŭ&quot;, Хорсъ, &quot;Xorsŭ&quot;, Хъросъ, &quot;Xŭrosŭ&quot;, and in modern Russian literature it is written as &quot;Khors&quot; (), similarly spelled by Maciej Stryjkowski - &quot;Khorsum&quot; (, modern ). In English, depending on the transliteration system, the name is written as &quot;Khors&quot;, &quot;Hors&quot;, or &quot;Xors&quot;.

=== Iranian etymology ===
Currently, the most popular view regarding the etymology of the theonym Khors is Iranian, and this etymology has been proposed since the 19th century. The Russian historian Pёtr Butkov, who called Khors &quot;the Slavic Apollo&quot;, was one of the first to connect his name with the Persian &quot;خورشید&quot;, &quot;xuršit&quot; and the Ossetian &quot;xur&quot;, &quot;xor&quot; &quot;sun,&quot; and with the Ossetian &quot;xorošŭ&quot;, &quot;хоrsŭ&quot;, &quot;xorsu&quot; meaning &quot;good&quot;. Iranian &quot;xvar&quot; &quot;halo&quot;, Indian &quot;hāra&quot;, &quot;hāras&quot; &quot;fire&quot; or Persian &quot;xoršid&quot; &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;Xuršid&quot; &quot;sun-god&quot; are also proposed. The Iranian word was also supposed to be the root word for &quot;Krones&quot;, the sky god in the Voguls and Ostyaks, and for the word &quot;kvar&quot; &quot;sky&quot;, &quot;air&quot; in the Votyak language.

Vladimir Toporov believed that the name &quot;Khors&quot; was brought to Kyiv, along with the solar cult, by soldiers from Khwarazm, who were supposedly stationed there during the reign of Vladimir the Great, but this theory has been heavily criticized. Mikhail Vasil&#x27;yev stated that the name could not have been borrowed from Middle Persian, but from Sarmatian-Alan peoples in the first millennium BC (so-called Iranian inversion).

Besides the Iranian etymology, there were other theories. For example, an early loan from Ossetian &quot;xorz&quot; &quot;good&quot; was proposed, which would also explain the Russian word хороший, &quot;khoroshiy&quot; &quot;good,&quot; which was originally supposed to mean &quot;of Khors, belonging to Khors&quot;, but this possibility was rejected by Vasmer. Toporov, who also rejected borrowing from Ossetian, wrote:

==== Criticism ====
Borrowing from Iranian languages has been accepted by religious scholars without much complaint, but linguists, such as Max Vasmer, point out phonetic problems. Iranian &quot;hva-&quot; does not explain the Slavic short vowel ъ (&quot;ŭ&quot;), and &quot;š&quot; could not in Slavic languages remain as &quot;s&quot;, but according to the ruki rule should remain either as &quot;х&quot; (&quot;h&quot;) or as &quot;š&quot; (&quot;sh&quot;) in case the word was borrowed after the rule completion.

Iranian etymology also has historical problems. Khors could not have been borrowed during the reign of Vladimir the Great because by that time Persia had already converted to Islam, and the word &quot;Xoršid&quot; in Persian meant only &quot;sun&quot; and had no religious connotations. The name cannot be derived from the Avestan &quot;Hvar&quot; (because of the final &quot;-s&quot;), or &quot;hvarə хšаētəm&quot;: the expression was shortened to &quot;xwaršēδ&quot;/&quot;xoršid&quot; in Middle Persian during the Sassanid dynasty, at which time sun worship was transferred to the god Mitra. Additionally, at an early stage, iconoclasm prevailed in Persia and idols of Iranian gods were replaced with sacred fires. It is unclear, then, how the Eastern Slavs would have borrowed the word &quot;xwaršēδ&quot;/&quot;xoršid&quot; from Persia in such a short time, made a radical phonetic change, and placed Khors so high in the pantheon. Vasil&#x27;yev tried to solve this problem by suggesting the existence of a hypothetical Sarmatian-Alan word &quot;*xors&quot;/&quot;*xūrs&quot; &quot;King-Sun&quot; obtained through a complex chain of assumptions, but here too the phonetic problems mentioned earlier arise.

A comprehensive critique of Iranian theory was also made by Andrey Beskov.

=== Slavic etymologies ===
==== From Proto-Indo-European &quot;*kr̥ḱós&quot; ====
Aleksander Brückner (1918) also proposed a Slavic origin of the theonym. According to him, &quot;Chъrsъ&quot; in Polish would sound like &quot;chars&quot; and he finds this word in Polish dated phrases &quot;przecharsła&quot; or &quot;wycharsł&quot; meaning &quot;emaciated, haggard, pinched, drawn&quot; creature, or in Czech words &quot;krsati&quot;, &quot;krsnouti&quot; &quot;to emaciate, haggard&quot;, &quot;krsek&quot; &quot;dwarf&quot;, &quot;zakrsly&quot;, &quot;krs&quot; &quot;dwarf shrub&quot; with typical interchange of &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;k&quot; – the Polish word with preserved original &quot;k&quot; is &quot;karślak&quot; &quot;knotty tree&quot;, or toponymes &quot;Karsy&quot;. The Proto-Slavic form of these words is reconstructed as the adjective &quot;*kъrsъ&quot; &quot;declined, skinny, dwarf&quot;, the verb &quot;*kъrsati&quot; &quot;to decrease, decline&quot;, &quot;*krsnąti&quot; &quot;to lose weight&quot; from PIE. &quot;*kr̥ḱós&quot; &quot;skinny&quot; (PIE &quot;ḱ&quot; → PS &quot;s&quot;). This interpretation was supported by Michał Łuczyński (2020). According to him, the Proto-Slavic form of theonym, &quot;*Xъrsъ&quot;, from the earlier &quot;*Kъrsъ&quot;, is formally identical with the surnames: Old Serbian Хьрсь and Old Bulgarian Xrъсъ, as well as the toponyms: Old Polish &quot;*Kars&quot; and &quot;*Chars&quot;, Serbian &quot;Hrs&quot; and Old Russian &quot;Хорсъ&quot; and others, and is derived from the adjective &quot;*kъrsъ&quot; &quot;skinny&quot;. This reconstruction is etymologically correct, and semantically consistent with the lunar interpretation – moon as &quot;skinny&quot;, which may have been related to lunar cycles.

==== From Proto-Indo-European &quot;*kʷr̥s-&quot; ====

According to the Slovak linguist Martin Pukanec (2013), the theonym &quot;Khors&quot; does not have a Proto-Slavic genesis. He points here to a Slavic TarT/TorT (T = any consonant) switch that occurred around 800. Proto-Slavic TorT in East Slavic languages passed into ToroT, so Proto-Slavic &quot;*Xorsъ&quot; should pass into East Slavic &quot;*Xorosъ&quot;, and such a notation is not confirmed by the sources. According to him, there is also no reliable attestation of this theonym in West and South Slavic languages. In that case, according to Pukanec, the theonym was borrowed from Persian &quot;xuršēt&quot; &quot;shining sun&quot;, but he does not address the criticism of such etymology by other linguists presented earlier.

He also points to another possibility. Proto-Slavic TorT passed into Church Slavonic as TъrT and TrъT, which would explain both notations &quot;*Xorsъ&quot; and &quot;*Xъrsъ&quot; and recognizes the &quot;*Xъrsъ&quot; notation as primary. As the PS &quot;*x&quot; may derive from PIE &quot;*k&quot; or &quot;*g&quot;, when searching for the PIE etymology of the word, attention must be paid primarily to the rounded phones &quot;*kʷ&quot;, &quot;*gʷ&quot;, and &quot;*gʷʰ&quot;; the Proto-Indo-European stem can thus be reconstructed as &quot;*kʷr̥s-&quot; or &quot;*gʷr̥s-&quot; or &quot;*gʷʰr̥s-&quot;. Of the aforementioned stems, only one, &quot;*kʷr̥s-&quot;, is found in Julius Pokorny&#x27;s &quot;Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch&quot;, who reconstructed this stem using Greek πρῖνος, &quot;prînos&quot; &quot;oak (holly)&quot;, Gaulish &quot;prenne&quot; &quot;large tree&quot;, Old High German &quot;horst&quot;, &quot;hurst&quot; &quot;bush, thicket&quot; or Slovene &quot;hrást&quot; &quot;oak&quot;, which, like the theonym in question, contain a vowel between &quot;-r-&quot; and &quot;-s-&quot;. Such a reconstruction would indicate functions similar to those of Perun, the god of storms and oaks.

== Interpretations ==

=== Khors-Dazhbog – Sun god ===
Scholars who assume an Iranian etymology most often attribute the solar features to Khors. The main argument is the root of the theonym meaning &quot;sun&quot; in the first place, regardless of which exact word that root was. Moreover, according to &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, Prince Vseslav, who &quot;came to Tmutarakani before the cocks&quot; and &quot;ran along the road of the great Khors&quot;, traveled from west to east and thus reached the castle before the cocks crowed, and in this way &quot;overtook&quot; the Sun.

It has also been pointed out in the text of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; where, when listing the statues of the gods, only between Khors and Dazhbog, the sun god, no conjunction &quot;and&quot; is used (unlike the rest of the gods), and this, according to many scholars, would suggest that Khors is another name of Dadzbog, his hypostasis, or that they are related in some other way. Such a view was supported e.g. by Henryk Łowmiański, according to whom &quot;Dazhbog&quot; was an explanation of &quot;Khors&quot;. He pointed out, however, that he was not sure if conjunction wasn&#x27;t there. Brückner argued against this view, claiming that the lack of conjunctions was irrelevant, and he considered the association of Dazhbog with Khors to be unjustified. An analysis of the spelling of Old East Slavic sources confirms Brückner&#x27;s view: the lack of a conjunction often occurs in the enumeration of choronyms, ethnonyms, hydronyms, anthroponyms, and theonyms, e.g.: copy of &quot;Novgorod First Chronicle&quot;: &quot;... и стриба сенмарекла мокошь&quot;, &quot;Sermon and Revelation by the Holy Apostles&quot;: &quot;пероуна и хорса дыя и трояна&quot;, &quot;Sermon by Saint Gregory, found in the comments&quot;: &quot;молятся (...) нероуноу. хорсу мокоши&quot;.

=== Moon god ===
Some scholars, who also assume an Iranian etymology, believe that Chors was a lunar god, and that the meaning of his name refers not to the rays of the sun, but to the rays of the moon.

It is pointed out here that Vseslav was called a &quot;wolf&quot; and werewolfism is associated with the moon, while the prince&#x27;s journey itself takes place at night when the sun is absent from the sky, thus he could not cut the path of the sun but the moon. Additionally, it is also pointed out that Tmutarakan is not located from Kyiv to the east, but to the southeast. A probable misunderstanding of the phrase &quot;to the hens&quot; is also pointed out. In Old East Slavic this phrase meant &quot;until late; at night&quot;, &quot;until dawn, before dawn&quot;, and Russian dial. phrase &quot;до вторых кочетов&quot; meant &quot;until late; after midnight&#x27; (literally: &quot;to the other roosters&quot;). As phrases beginning with &quot;до&quot; meant night and morning phrases starting with &quot;со&quot; (cf. со вторыми кочетами), it can be concluded that Vseslav arrived in the city at night, not in the morning. Łuczynski also points out that the epithet &quot;great&quot; (OES великому, &quot;velikomu&quot;) used in relation to Khors in &quot;The Tale&quot;, which is usually taken as an argument for the solar interpretation, can be understood differently: in Slavic folklore the epithet &quot;great&quot; is often used in relation to the moon, e.g. the Polish &quot;wielki księżyc&quot;, Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian &quot;velik mesec&quot;, and he further compares the Old Russian phrase to the Old Norse kenning &quot;mána vegr&quot; &quot;sky&quot;, literally &quot;the way of the moon&quot;.

The interpretation of the name &quot;Khors&quot; as &quot;emaciated&quot; was supported by linguist Wanda Budziszewska. She reports that the waning moon was called &quot;puny, frail&quot; among the Slavs: Polish dial. (Podhale and the Kraków area) &quot;wietek&quot;, &quot;wiotek&quot;, Old Czech &quot;vetech&quot;, Belarusian &quot;v́òtak&quot; and Russian &quot;vétoch&quot;. In Old Polish, the word &quot;wiotchy&quot; meant &quot;frail because of wear, use, old age&quot; (PS ).

== Alleged idol ==
The German traveler Johann David Wunderer, who traveled in Russia from 1589 to 1590 and described Pskov in his memoir, mentioned the statues of Khors and Uslad that were supposed to be located near Pskov:

In his diary, Wunderer described Pskov freshly, although when he was editing the manuscript, he added elements that are borrowed from other sources, and they add more detailed information that, however, are easily identifiable. Wunderer could not have known the names of the gods depicted on the stone primarily because the Uslad he mentions is in fact a pseudodeity, his name came about as a result of a distortion of a passage in &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; in which a statue of Perun and other Slavic pagan idols erected by Vladimir of Kiev are described, Sigismund von Herberstein recognized the words &quot;golden moustache&quot; (&quot;us zlat&quot;) in the description of Perun as an independent name &quot;Uslad&quot;,
and he never existed in the Russian pantheon. Many historians considered the mentioned passage unreliable.

Wunderer realized that a field camp of Stephen Báthory, who besieged Pskov in 1581-1582, had once been located near the statues, and this information led to the location of the statues he described. The camp was located south of Pskov and lay on both sides of the Promiezhitsa stream, which separated the flat terrain around the city from the wooded hills and mountains that stretched all the way to the Cheremcha river, and the statues must have been located near it. The existence of the idol was unexpectedly confirmed when, during excavations in 1897, the so-called &quot;stone baba&quot; (a conventional name for stone statues depicting people in Eastern Europe) was found between Promiezhitsa and the factory. The statue was probably not found in its original place, but that place must have been nearby anyway. During World War II, the statue, which was in the Pskov Museum, was lost, but photographs from 1928-1929 have survived. The idol was about 100 cm. long, and had a cross on its chest, which was made at the same time as the rest of the sculpture, but the idol was deliberately damaged, and only the head is preserved in good condition.

According to Russian archaeologist the figure is related to the Slavic paganism. The location of the statue and the sign of the cross coincide exactly with Wunderer&#x27;s description. The cross, which is an ancient symbol of the sun, is supposed to testify to the relationship of the god in the statue with the sun, and the statue itself is supposed to represent Khors or Dazhbog. Some researchers have suggested that the statue belongs to Christian culture. The statue is dated to the 8th to 10th century.

<doc id="1066174" wikidata="Q2701508" url="?curid=1066174" title="Radio Free Roscoe">
<text>Radio Free Roscoe is a teen comedy-drama television series. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, and produced by Decode Entertainment. It first aired on August 1, 2003, on Family Channel in Canada. It has also been dubbed in French (as required for Canadian federally funded TV shows) in the province of Quebec and aired on Vrak. The show was later aired on U.S. network Noggin&#x27;s teen block, The N, where the show received funding for a second season. The series ended on May 27, 2005, because The N decided to stop funding the show, and Family, along with Decode Entertainment, could not fill the gap in the production budget. The show was shown on Family until 2007, when it was replaced. In early 2008, The N began rebroadcasting reruns. As of 2019, episodes could still be found on the Canadian station WildBrainTV.

The pilot was first filmed in New Jersey, with an entirely different cast. At that time, the show was going to be based in Nutley, New Jersey and was to be titled &quot;Radio Free Nutley&quot;. The show was never picked up. Decode Entertainment later decided to move production to Toronto and change the cast and title of the show, leading to the show&#x27;s production and broadcasting.

== Premise ==
Four teens in the suburban New Jersey town of Roscoe start attending Henry Roscoe High School. Fed up with their school&#x27;s radio station (Cougar Radio) dictating how students should live, and the overbearing Principal Waller who seems to favour the popular students, they create their own pirate radio station called Radio Free Roscoe. Lily Randall, Ray Brennan and Robbie McGrath are old friends, and find a friend in Travis Strong when they form the radio station. They assume radio aliases to conceal their identities.

The four friends confront various challenges, such as navigating relationships with their schoolmates and managing their pirate radio station while maintaining their day-to-day lives.

== Cast and characters ==

=== Main cast ===
Note: each member of &quot;Radio Free Roscoe&quot; assumes a pseudonym for broadcasting the radio show, allowing them to remain anonymous and thus prevent the administration from shutting the show down (pseudonym given in quotation marks).

* Ray &quot;Pronto&quot; Brennan – Al Mukadam
* Robbie &quot;Question Mark&quot; McGrath – Nathan Stephenson
* Lily &quot;Shady Lane&quot; Randall – Kate Todd
* Travis &quot;Smog&quot; Strong / Miss Communication – Nathan Carter

=== Supporting cast ===
* Kim Carlisle – Genelle Williams
* Principal Daniel Waller – Hamish McEwan
* Mickey Stone – Kenny Robinson
* Audrey Quinlan – Ashley Newbrough
* Ted – David Rendall
* Ed – Garen Boyajian
* Parker Haynes – Victoria Nestorowicz (season 2)
* Megan – Hill Kourkoutis (season 2)
* Bridget – Lara Amersey (season 2)
* River Pierce – Steve Belford (season 2)
* Grace Sutter – Julia Alexander (season 2)

The final two episodes of the series (&quot;Dance Around the Truth&quot; and &quot;The Last Dance&quot;) included all of the main and supporting cast, excluding Bridget (although she is mentioned) and Audrey.

All members of RFR have been, at some point, part of Cougar Radio. Travis considered joining in Episode One. Ray joined Cougar Radio because he didn&#x27;t like concealing himself behind his persona &quot;Pronto&quot;. Kim Carlisle convinced Robbie to join. Lily joined River Pierce to get air time for her band. Regardless of the rational basis, none of the RFR members departs permanently.

<text>Ross MacKenzie Whicher (February 13, 1918 – April 19, 2002) was a Canadian politician and businessman.

Whicher served in World War II with the 4th anti-tank regiment of the Canadian military. Following the war, he returned home and opened the Wiarton Dairy, operating it for several decades.

Whicher served as mayor of Wiarton, Ontario from 1953 until 1955 when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Bruce. In 1958, he was a candidate for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, but received only 39 votes and dropped off after the first ballot at the party&#x27;s leadership convention.

Whicher was re-elected to the legislature in 1959 and 1963 and served as the Liberals&#x27; finance critic. During this period, the Progressive Conservative government of John Robarts was often to the left of the Liberals, and Whicher often criticised it for overspending.

Following his provincial career, Whicher served two terms in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Bruce. He won his seat in the 1968 federal election, and was re-elected in the 1972 election. He retired from politics when the 1974 election was called.

<doc id="1066195" wikidata="Q2930097" url="?curid=1066195" title="Beta-keratin">
<text>Beta-keratin (β-keratin) is a member of a structural protein family found in the epidermis of reptiles and birds. Beta-keratins were named so because they are components of epidermal stratum corneum rich in stacked beta sheets, in contrast to alpha-keratins, intermediate-filament proteins also found in stratum corneum and rich in alpha helices. Because the accurate use of the term &quot;keratin&quot; is limited to the alpha-keratins, the term &quot;beta-keratins&quot; in recent works is replaced by &quot;corneous beta-proteins&quot; or &quot;keratin-associated beta-proteins.&quot; 

β-keratins add much more rigidity to reptilian skin than alpha-keratins alone do to mammalian skin. β-keratins are impregnated into the stratum corneum of the reptilian skin, providing waterproofing and the prevention of desiccation.

The scales, beaks, claws and feathers of birds contain β-keratin of the avian family. Phylogenetic studies of β-keratin sequences show that feather β-keratins evolved from scale β-keratins. The scale β-keratins form the basal group in avians. Duplication and divergence events then led to claw β-keratin genes, and further recombination resulted in new feather and feather-like avian β-keratin genes. Evidence for these duplication events comes from the correlation of feather β-keratin clade structure with their genomic loci.

Changes in β-keratins may have also influenced the development of powered flight. A recent study using molecular dating methods to link the evolution of avian β-keratin genes in general to that of feathers specifically reveals that the avian β-keratin family began diverging from the crocodile family about 216 million years ago. It also found that the feather β-keratin family did not begin diverging until 125 million years ago, a date consistent with the adaptive radiation of birds during the Cretaceous. β-keratins found in modern feathers have increased elasticity, a factor that may have contributed to their role in flight. Thus, feathered relatives of birds such as &quot;Anchiornis&quot; and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, whose flight capabilities have been questioned, would have had avian, but not feather, β-keratins.

The small alvarezsaurid dinosaur &quot;Shuvuuia deserti&quot; shows evidence of a featherlike skin covering. Analysis by Schweitzer &quot;et al.&quot; (1999) showed that these featherlike structures consisted of beta-keratin. This has since been refuted by Saitta et al., finding that the fibers analyzed instead consisted of inorganic calcium phosphate as evidenced by fluorescence under cross polarised light. Signals from immunohistochemical analyses on fossil samples are prone to false positives and must be used with caution when dealing with geological samples.

<doc id="1066203" wikidata="Q118051" url="?curid=1066203" title="Anderson Dawson">
<text>Andrew Dawson (16 July 1863 – 20 July 1910), usually known as Anderson Dawson, was an Australian politician and unionist who served as the 14th premier of Queensland for one week from the 1 to the 7 of December 1899. This short-lived premiership was the first Australian Labor Party (ALP) government in Australia and the first parliamentary labour party government anywhere in the world.

==Early life==
Dawson was born on 16 July 1863 at Rockhampton, Queensland, the son of Anderson Dawson and his wife Jane (née Smith). When he was six, his mother died in a fire, and Dawson was placed in Diamantina orphanage in Brisbane. His aunt, Mary Ann Park, then retrieved Dawson and took him to live with her family in Redbank. He later moved with the family to Gympie. He began work as a miner at Charters Towers, in 1887 married the Irish widow Caroline Ryan, née Quinn, and later was elected first president of the Miners&#x27; Union. Dawson was originally attracted to politics by the Irish Home Rule question and in 1890 emerged as a political pamphleteer when he published &quot;The Case Stated&quot;, &quot;an able plea for the creation of an Australian republic.&quot; The pamphlet was freely available in Charters Towers, both a trade unionist and a republican stronghold. Throughout 1890, Dawson was closely involved in the running of the Australasian Republican Association (ARA) and in February 1891 was elected the ARA&#x27;s second president. Dawson was also president, and later organiser, of the district council of the Australian Labour Federation (ALF). During the Queensland shearers’ strike, he was appointed chairman of the Queensland provincial council of the ALF, and was public in his support of socialism. He took up journalism and for a time was editor of the local newspaper, the radical &quot;The Charters Towers Eagle&quot;. He was also elected to the Local Council in Charters Towers.

==Colonial politics==

Dawson entered politics at the 1893 election, as one of the two Labor candidates for Charters Towers in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. He won the seat, and retained it at the 1896 and 1899 elections. Dawson was inspired by Marxist economics, and performed speeches to the Social Democratic Federation on Marx and issues surrounding surplus labour.

When the government of James Dickson resigned on 1 December 1899, Dawson formed a ministry. Although it was defeated as soon as the Legislative Assembly next met, it nevertheless became the first socialist or Labour Party government in the world.

This remains one of the shortest ministries of any state government in Australia. In a remarkable coincidence, Vaiben Louis Solomon&#x27;s contemporaneous ministry in South Australia outdid Dawson by a single day (1–8 December 1899). John Cain and Thomas Hollway, both premiers of Victoria in the 1940s–50s, had shorter ministries. Cain served for four days and Hollway for only 70 hours. The very shortest belongs to George Fuller, who was premier of New South Wales for seven hours on 20 December 1921. These, however, were not Cain, Fuller, or Hollway&#x27;s only terms as premier; all three exceeded Dawson for total time in the role.

==Federal politics==
At the first Federal election for the Senate in 1901, Dawson was returned at the head of the Queensland Labor ticket. While in federal parliament, he was regarded as a good speaker, but struggled with persistent ill health associated with chronic lung trouble from his time as a miner, which worsened after he relocated his family from Queensland to the colder climate of Melbourne. He also struggled with alcoholism, and was absent from parliament for periods, frustrating his colleagues.

In April 1904, when Chris Watson formed the first Federal Labor government, Dawson was given the portfolio of Minister for Defence in light of his prominent status as a former Premier. As Minister for Defence, he clashed with Edward Hutton, the aristocratic English General Officer Commanding the Australian Military Forces, who had resisted being answerable to the executive, and had been viewed as disrespectful by previous defence ministers. Dawson proposed a military restructure which eliminated Hutton&#x27;s position, which was adopted by his successor after the ousting of the Watson government, resulting in Hutton&#x27;s resignation and return to England. Dawson reportedly stated that the &quot;most satisfying facet&quot; of his stint as minister had been that he had &quot;pulled down from his pedestal the biggest bounder that had ever commanded the forces in Australia.&quot;

By the time of the 1906 election, Dawson had a poor relationship with the Queensland state executive of the Labor Party, and was initially demoted to the unwinnable fourth position on the Labor Senate ticket. As a result of concerns about the electoral fallout of his dumping, he was reinstated to the winnable third position on the ticket, but resigned as a candidate two months later, citing ill health. He subsequently changed his mind, but the executive refused to reinstate him, so he ran as an independent. That move split the Labor vote, and amidst a generally bad election for Labor in Queensland, the entire ticket lost.

==Later life==
Dawson was unable to find work in Melbourne, and returned to Queensland in 1909, while his wife and four children remained in Melbourne. He was admitted to the Brisbane General Hospital on 6 July 1910 and was expected to recover, but died of the effects of alcoholism on 20 July 1910. His widow and children reportedly did not attend his funeral. He was buried in Toowong Cemetery on 21 July 1910.

==Legacy==
The Federal electoral division of Dawson is named after him.

The ceremonial ritual is an analogical-imitative magic rite that consists of singing and dancing done by young girls or boys in processions following a main performer who is dressed with fresh branches, leaves and herbs, with the purpose of invoking rain, usually practiced in times of droughts, especially in the summer season, when drought endangers crops and pastures, even human life itself.

According to one interpretation, the custom could have Slavic origin and be related to Slavic god Perun, and Perperuna could have been a Slavic goddess of rain, and the wife of the supreme deity Perun (god of thunder and weather in the Slavic pantheon). Recent research criticize invention of a Slavic female goddess, and indicate as possible both Slavic and old-Balkan influences. In Albanian ritual songs are invoked Dielli (the Sun), Perëndi (the Sky, or deity of weather), and Ilia (Elijah, who in Christianized Albanian and South Slavic folklore has replaced the Sun god and the thunder or weather god, Drangue and Perun).

== Names ==

Rainmaking rites are generally called after the divine figure invoked in the ritual songs, as well as the boy or girl who perform the rite, who are called with different names among different peoples (South Slavs, Albanians, Greeks, Hungarians, Moldovans, Romanians, Vlachs or Aromanians, including regions of Bukovina and Bessarabia). The custom&#x27;s Slavic prototype name is &quot;*Perperuna&quot;, with variations:

*&quot;Preperuna&quot;, &quot;Peperuna&quot;, &quot;Preperuda/Peperuda&quot;, &quot;Pepereda&quot;, &quot;Preperuga/Peperuga&quot;, &quot;Peperunga&quot;, &quot;Pemperuga&quot; in Bulgaria and North Macedonia 

*&quot;Prporuša&quot;, &quot;Parparuša&quot;, &quot;Preporuša/Preporuča&quot;, &quot;Preperuša&quot;, &quot;Barburuša/Barbaruša&quot; in Croatia

*&quot;Peperuda&quot;, &quot;Papaluga&quot;, &quot;Papaluda/Paparudă&quot;, &quot;Babaruta&quot;, &quot;Mamaruta&quot; in Romania and Moldova

In Albanian the rainmaking ritual is also called &quot;riti i ndjelljes së shiut&quot; (&quot;Rain-Invoking Ritual&quot;), &quot;riti i thirrjes së shiut&quot; (&quot;Rain-Calling Ritual&quot; or &quot;Rite of Calling the Rain&quot;) or simply &quot;thirrja e shiut&quot; (&quot;Call of the Rain&quot;), &quot;riti i thatësisë&quot; (&quot;Drought Ritual&quot;), as well as &quot;riti me dordolecin&quot; or &quot;riti i dordolecit&quot; (&quot;Dordoleci Ritual&quot;), &quot;riti i dodolisë&quot; (&quot;Dodoli Ritual&quot;).

===Etymology===
Some scholars consider all the Balkan names of the type &quot;per-&quot;, &quot;perper-&quot;, &quot;peper-&quot;, &quot;papar-&quot;, etc. to be taboo-alternations to &quot;avoid profaning the holy name&quot; of the pagan Indo-European god &quot;*Perkʷūnos&quot;. According to Roman Jakobson and others &quot;perperuna&quot; is formed by reduplication of root &quot;per-&quot; (to strike/beat). Those with root &quot;peper-&quot;, &quot;papar-&quot; and &quot;pirpir-&quot; were changed accordingly modern words for pepper-tree and poppy plant, possibly also perper and else. 

Dimitar Marinov derived it from Bulgarian word for butterfly where in folk beliefs has supernatural powers related to rain, but according to Jakobson the mythological context of the customs and links explains the Bulgarian entomological names. Michail Arnaudov derived it from Slavic verb &quot;pršiti&quot; (spray). Petar Skok considered &quot;prporuša&quot; a metaphorical derivation from Slavic &quot;prpor/pŕpa&quot; (hot ash), &quot;pórusa&quot; (&quot;when water is poured on burning ash&quot;). Stanisław Urbańczyk and Michal Łuczyński put into question Jakobson&#x27;s theonymic derivation, deriving instead from Proto-Slavic &quot;*perpera&quot;, &quot;*perperъka&quot; (in Polish &quot;przepiórka&quot;), name for Common quail, which has a role in Polish harvest rituals and the name of the bride in the wedding dance. These are also related to &quot;*pъrpati&quot; (onomatopoeic), cf. Polish dial. &quot;perpotać&quot;, &quot;perpac&quot;, Old East Slavic &quot;poropriti&quot;.

The name &quot;Dodola&quot; has been suggested to be a cognate to the Lithuanian &quot;Dundulis&quot;, a word for &quot;thunder&quot; and another name of the Baltic thunder-god Perkūnas. It is also hypothesised to be distantly related to Greek Dodona and Daedala. Bulgarian variant &quot;Didjulja&quot; is similar to alleged Polish goddess Dzidzilela, and Polish language also has verb &quot;dudnić&quot; (&quot;to thunder&quot;).

The uncertainty of the etymologies provided by scholars leads to a call for a &quot;detailed and in-depth comparative analysis of formulas, set phrases and patterns of imagery in rainmaking songs from &quot;all&quot; the Balkan languages&quot;.

== Origin ==
The rainmaking practice is a shared tradition among Balkan peoples, and it is not clear who borrowed it from whom. The fact so similar customs in the Balkans are known by two different names the differences are considered not to be from the same time period and ethnic groups. Similar customs outside the Balkans have been observed in the Caucasus, Middle East, and North Africa. William Shedden-Ralston noted that Jacob Grimm thought Perperuna/Dodola were &quot;originally identical with the Bavarian &quot;Wasservogel&quot; and the Austrian &quot;Pfingstkönig&quot;&quot; rituals.

Ancient rainmaking practices have been widespread Mediterranean traditions, already documented in the Balkans since Minoan and Mycenaean times. There is a lack of any strong historical evidence for a link between the figures and practices of the ancient times and those that survided to the end of the 20th century, however, according to Richard Berengarten, if seen as &quot;typologically parallel&quot; practices in the ancient world, they may be interpretable at least as forerunners, even if not as direct progenitors of the modern Balkan rainmaking customs.

In the scholarship is usually considered they have a mythological and etymological Slavic origin related to Slavic thunder-god Perun, and became widespread in the Southeastern Europe with the Slavic migration (6th-10th century). According to the Slavic theory, it is a (Balto-)Slavic heritage of Proto-Indo-European origin related to Slavic thunder-god Perun. It has parallels in ritual prayers for bringing rain in times of drought dedicated to rain-thunder deity Parjanya recorded in the &quot;Vedas&quot; and Baltic thunder-god Perkūnas, cognates alongside Perun of Proto-Indo-European weather-god Perkwunos. The same ritual in an early medieval Ruthenian manuscript is related to East Slavic deity Pereplut. According to Jakobson, &quot;Novgorod Chronicle&quot; (&quot;dožd prapruden&quot;) and &quot;Pskov Chronicle&quot; (&quot;dožd praprudoju neiskazaemo silen&quot;) could have &quot;East Slavic trace of Peperuda calling forth the rain&quot;, and West Slavic god Pripegala reminds of &quot;Preperuga/Prepeluga&quot; variation and connection with Perun. Serbo-Croatian archaic variant &quot;Prporuša&quot; and verb &quot;prporiti se&quot; (&quot;to fight&quot;) also have parallels in Old Russian (&quot;porъprjutъsja&quot;). 

According to another interpretation the name &quot;Perperuna&quot; can be identified as the reduplicated feminine derivative of the name of the male god &quot;Perun&quot; (&quot;per-perun-a&quot;), being his female consort, wife and goddess of rain &quot;Perperuna Dodola&quot;, which parallels the Old Norse couple Fjörgyn–Fjörgynn and the Lithuanian Perkūnas–Perkūnija. Perun&#x27;s battle against Veles because of Perperuna/Dodola&#x27;s kidnapping has parallels in Zeus saving of Persephone after Hades carried her underground causing big drought on Earth, also seen in the similarity of the names Perperuna and Persephone. Recent research criticize invention of a Slavic female goddess. 

Another explanation for the variations of the name &quot;Dodola&quot; is relation to the Slavic spring goddess (Dido-)Lada/Lado/Lela, some scholars relate &quot;Dodole&quot; with pagan custom and songs of &quot;Lade&quot; (Ladarice) in Hrvatsko Zagorje (so-called &quot;Ladarice Dodolske&quot;), and in Žumberak-Križevci for the &quot;Preperuša&quot; custom was also used term &quot;Ladekarice&quot;.

Other scholars like Vitomir Belaj, due to the geographical distribution, consider that the rainmaking ritual could also have Paleo-Balkan origin, or formed separate of worship of Perun but could be etymologically related. One theory, in particular, argues that Slavic deity Perun and Perperuna/Dodola customs are of Thracian origin, however, the name of the Slavic thunder-god Perun is commonly accepted to be formed from the Proto-Slavic root &quot;*per&quot; &quot;to strike&quot; attached to the common agent suffix &quot;-unŭ&quot;, explained as &quot;the Striker&quot;. The Romanian-Aromanian and Greek ethnic origin was previously rejected by Alan Wace, Maurice Scott Thompson, George Frederick Abbott among others.

== Ritual ==
Perperuna and Dodola are considered very similar pagan customs with common origin, with main difference being in the most common gender of the central character (possibly related to social hierarchy of the specific ethnic or regional group), lyric verses, sometimes religious content, and presence or absence of a chorus. They essentially belong to rituals related to fertility, but over time differentiated to a specific form connected with water and vegetation. They represent a group of rituals with a human collective going on a procession around houses and fields of a village, but with a central live character which differentiates them from other similar collective rituals in the same region and period (&quot;Krstonoše&quot;, &quot;Poklade&quot;, &quot;Kolade&quot;, &quot;German&quot;, &quot;Ladarice&quot;, those during &quot;Jurjevo&quot; and &quot;Ivandan&quot; and so on). In the valley of Skopje in North Macedonia the Dodola were held on Thursday which was Perun&#x27;s day. In Hungary the ritual was usually held on St. George&#x27;s Day. The core of the song always mentions a type of rain and list of regional crops. The first written mentions and descriptions of the pagan custom are from the 18th century by Dimitrie Cantemir in &quot;Descriptio Moldaviae&quot; (1714/1771, &quot;Papaluga&quot;), then in a Greek law book from Bucharest (1765, it invoked 62nd Cannon to stop the custom of &quot;Paparuda&quot;), and by the Bulgarian hieromonk Spiridon Gabrovski who also noted to be related to Perun (1792, &quot;Peperud&quot;).

South Slavs and non-Slavic peoples alike used to organise the Perperuna/Dodola ritual in times of spring and especially summer droughts, where they worshipped the god/goddess and prayed to him/her for rain (and fertility, later also asked for other field and house blessings). The central character of the ceremony of Perperuna was usually a young boy, while of Dodola usually a young girl, both aged between 10–15 years. Purity was important, and sometimes to be orphans. They would be naked, but were not anymore in latest forms of 19-20th century, wearing a skirt and dress densely made of fresh green knitted vines, leaves and flowers of &quot;Sambucus nigra&quot;, &quot;Sambucus ebulus&quot;, &quot;Clematis flammula&quot;, &quot;Clematis vitalba&quot;, fern and other deciduous shrubs and vines, small branches of &quot;Tilia&quot;, Oak and other. The green cover initially covered all body so that the central person figure was almost unrecognizable, but like the necessity of direct skin contact with greenery it also greatly decreased and was very simple in modern period. They whirled and were followed by a small procession of children who walked and danced with them around the same village and fields, sometimes carrying oak or beech branches, singing the ritual prayer, stopping together at every house yard, where the hosts would sprinkle water on chosen boy/girl who would shake and thus sprinkle everyone and everything around it (example of &quot;analogical magic&quot;), hosts also gifted treats (bread, eggs, cheese, sausages etc., in a later period also money) to children who shared and consumed them among them and sometimes even hosts would drink wine, seemingly as a sacrifice in Perun&#x27;s honor. The chosen boy/girl was called by one of the name variants of the ritual itself, however in Istria was also known as &quot;Prporuš&quot; and in Dalmatia-Boka Kotorska as &quot;Prpac/Prpats&quot; and both regions his companions as &quot;Prporuše&quot;, while at Pirot and Nišava District in Southern Serbia near Bulgarian border were called as &quot;dodolće&quot; and &quot;preperuđe&quot;, and as in Macedonia both names appear in the same song.

By the 20th century once common rituals almost vanished in the Balkans, although rare examples of practice can be traced until 1950-1980s and remained in folk memory. In some local places, like in Albania, can be observed as rare events even in the 21st century.

The main reason is the development of agriculture and consequently lack of practical need for existence of mystical connection and customs with nature and weather. Christian church also tried to diminish pagan beliefs and customs, resulting in &quot;dual belief&quot; (&quot;dvoeverie&quot;) in rural populations, a conscious preservation of pre-Christian beliefs and practices alongside Christianity. Into customs and songs were mixed elements from other rituals including Christianity, but they also influenced the creation of Christian songs and prayers invoking the rain which were used as a close Christian alternative (decline was reportedly faster among Catholics). According to Velimir Deželić Jr. in 1937, it was an old custom that &quot;Christians approved it, took it over and further refined it. In the old days, &quot;Prporuša&quot; were very much like a pious ritual, only later the leaders - &quot;Prpac&quot; - began to boast too much, and &quot;Prporuše&quot; seemed to be more interested in gifts than beautiful singing and prayer&quot;. Depending on region, instead of village boys and girls the pagan ritual by then was mostly done by migrating Romani people from other villages and for whom it became a professional performance motivated by gifts, sometimes followed by financially poor members from other ethnic groups. Due to Anti-Romani sentiment, the association with Romani also caused repulsion, shame and ignorance among last generations of members of ethnic groups who originally performed it. Eventually it led to a dichotomy of identification with own traditional heritage, Christianity and stereotypes about Romani witchcraft.

In the present days, older generations of Albanians demonstrate the common practice of rainmaking rituals in their life, but newer generations generally see them as something applied in the past, a tradition that their parents have gone through. Nevertheless, elders still accompany processions of boys and girls, who perform the rainmaking rite dressed with their best traditional clothing except for the main boy or girl, who is dressed entirely in fresh branches, leaves and herbs. Public exhibitions of the ritual are usually performed during Albanian festivals, often for the local audience, but also in the Gjirokastër National Folk Festival, one of the most important events of Albanian culture.

===Perperuna songs===
Ioan Slavici reported in 1881 that the custom of &quot;Paparuga&quot; was already &quot;very disbanded&quot; in Romania. Stjepan Žiža in 1889/95 reported that the once common ritual almost vanished in Southwestern and Central-Eastern Istria, Croatia. Ivan Milčetić recorded in 1896 that the custom of &quot;Prporuša&quot; also almost vanished from the North Adriatic island of Krk, although almost recently it was well known in all Western parts of Croatia, while in other parts as &quot;Dodola&quot;. Croatian linguist Josip Ribarić recorded in 1916 that it was still alive in Southwestern Istria and Ćićarija (and related it to the 16th century migration from Dalmatia of speakers of Southwestern Istrian dialect). On island of Krk was also known as &quot;Barburuša/Barbaruša/Bambaruša&quot; (occurrence there is possibly related to the 15th century migration which included besides Croats also Vlach-Istro-Romanian shepherds). It was also widespread in Dalmatia (especially Zadar hinterland, coast and islands), Žumberak (also known as &quot;Pepeluše&quot;, &quot;Prepelice&quot;) and Western Slavonia (Križevci). It was held in Istria at least until the 1950s, in Žumberak until the 1960s, while according to one account in Jezera on island Murter the last were in the late 20th century. In Serbia, Perperuna was only found in Kosovo, Southern and Eastern Serbia near Bulgarian border. According to Natko Nodilo the discrepancy in distribution between these two countries makes an idea that originally Perperuna was Croatian while Dodola was Serbian custom. Seemingly it was not present in Slovenia, Northern Croatia, almost all of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro (only sporadically in Boka Kotorska). Luka Jovović from Virpazar, Montenegro reported in 1896 that in Montenegro existed some &quot;koleda&quot; custom for summer droughts, but was rare and since 1870s not practiced anymore.

According to Albanian folk beliefs, the Sun (Dielli) makes the sky cloudy or clears it up. Albanians used to invoke the Sun with rainmaking and soil fertility rituals. In rainmaking rituals from the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast, Albanians used to pray to the Sun, in particular facing Mount Shëndelli (Mount &quot;Holy Sun&quot;), by invoking the names &quot;Dielli&quot;, &quot;Shën Dëlliu&quot;, &quot;Ilia&quot; or &quot;Perëndia&quot;. Children used to dress a boy with fresh branches, calling him &quot;dordolec&quot;. A typical invocation song repeated three times during the ritual was: Afterwards, people used to say: &quot;Do kemi shi se u nxi Shëndëlliu&quot; (&quot;We will have rain because &quot;Shëndëlliu&quot; went dark&quot;). The Sun used to be also invoked when reappearing after the rain, prayed for increased production in agriculture.

===Dodola songs===
The oldest record for Dodole rituals in Macedonia is the song &quot;Oj Ljule&quot; from Struga region, recorded in 1861. The Dodola rituals in Macedonia were actively held until the 1960s. In Bulgaria the chorus was also &quot;Oj Ljule&quot;. The oldest record in Serbia was by Vuk Karadžić (1841), where was widespread all over the country and held at least until 1950/70s. In Croatia was found in Eastern Slavonia, Southern Baranja and Southeastern Srijem. August Šenoa in his writing about the travel to Okić-grad near Samobor, Croatia mentioned that saw two dodole. To them is related the custom of Lade/Ladarice from other parts of Croatia, having chorus &quot;&quot;Oj Lado, oj!&quot; and similar verses &quot;Molimo se višnjem Bogu/Da popuhne tihi vjetar, Da udari rodna kiša/Da porosi naša polja, I travicu mekušicu/Da nam stada Lado, Ugoje se naša stada&quot;&quot;.

<text>Shades of a Blue Orphanage is the second studio album by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1972. The title is a combination of the members&#x27; previous bands: Shades of Blue and Orphanage.

&quot;Sarah&quot; was written for Phil Lynott&#x27;s grandmother who raised him when his mother, Philomena, was unable to do so. This song should not be confused with the 1979 song of the same name, for Lynott&#x27;s daughter, included on &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot;.

A remastered and expanded version of &quot;Shades of a Blue Orphanage&quot; was released on 11 October 2010.

==Reception==
Stuart Berman of Pitchfork stated that Thin Lizzy &quot;weren’t lacking ambition at this stage, but rather direction&quot;, criticizing songs such as the album opener for its &quot;early, clumsy stab at heaviosity from a band that, at this point, had a much better grasp of intimacy&quot;, but praising &quot;Lynott’s lyrical voice&quot; as a &quot;sturdy anchor&quot; to the band&#x27;s output. Martin Popoff defined &quot;Shades of a Blue Orphanage&quot; &quot;a honest work&quot;, showing hints of Lynott&#x27;s folk acoustic past, &quot;some &#x27;60s-directed progressive psychedelia and even out of context rockabilly&quot; typical of such early 1970s rock records. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic was largely critical of the album, describing it as &quot;disappointing&quot;, and both the opening track and the title track as &quot;overblown and disjointed&quot;. However, he picked out &quot;Baby Face&quot; and &quot;Buffalo Gal&quot; as bright moments, and praised Lynott&#x27;s &quot;eloquent and personal&quot; performance on &quot;Sarah&quot;.

<doc id="1066212" wikidata="Q2365510" url="?curid=1066212" title="Scute">
<text>A scute () or scutum (Latin: &quot;scutum&quot;; plural: &quot;scuta&quot; &quot;shield&quot;) is a bony external plate or scale overlaid with horn, as on the shell of a turtle, the skin of crocodilians, and the feet of birds. The term is also used to describe the anterior portion of the mesothorax in insects as well as some arachnids (e.g., the family Ixodidae, the scale ticks).

==Properties==
Scutes are similar to scales and serve the same function. Unlike the scales of lizards and snakes, which are formed from the epidermis, scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface . Forming in the living dermis, the scutes produce a horny outer layer that is superficially similar to that of scales. Scutes will usually not overlap as snake scales (but see the pangolin). The outer keratin layer is shed piecemeal, and not in one continuous layer of skin as seen in snakes or lizards. The dermal base may contain bone and produce dermal armour. Scutes with a bony base are properly called &quot;osteoderms&quot;. Dermal scutes are also found in the feet of birds and tails of some mammals, and are believed to be the primitive form of dermal armour in reptiles.

The term is also used to describe the heavy armour of the armadillo and the extinct &quot;Glyptodon&quot;, and is occasionally used as an alternative to scales in describing snakes or certain fishes, such as sturgeons, shad, herring, and menhaden.

==Mammals==
Prehistoric ancestors of mammals, the synapsids, are thought to have scutes which were later reduced and replaced by hair. Excluding the attachment surface of fingernails, armoured scutes or scales are almost never seen in modern mammals. The horny scales of pangolins are only rarely called scutes, but &quot;scute&quot; is used to describe the heavy armour of the armadillo.

==Turtles==
The turtle&#x27;s shell is covered by scutes formed mostly of keratin. They are built similarly to horn, beak, or nail in other species.

==Fish==

Some fish, such as pineconefish, are completely or partially covered in large armored scales commonly termed scutes. Many Clupeomorpha have an abdominal row of scutes, which are scales with raised, sharp points that are used for protection, and in some cases they also possess dorsal scutes anterior to the dorsal fin, as in &quot;Knightia&quot; spp., &quot;Diplomystus&quot; spp. and certain extant taxa. Jacks of family Carangidae often have a row of scutes following the lateral line on either side. &quot;Coelorinchus&quot; spp. have scutes suborbitally from their preoperculum extending anteriorly onto a triangular snout. Sturgeon have five rows of scutes—modified ganoid scales—and are otherwise scaleless.

==Birds==

The tarsometatarsus and toes of most birds are covered in two types of scales. Large scutes run along the dorsal side of the tarsometatarsus and toes, whereas smaller scutellae run along the sides. Both structures share histochemical homology with reptilian scales; however, work on their evolutionary development has revealed that the scales in bird feet have secondarily evolved via suppression of the feather-building genetic program. Unblocking the feather suppression program results in feathers growing in place of scales along the tarsometatarsus and toes. Dinosaur species very close to the origin of birds have been shown to have had &quot;hind wings&quot; made of feathers growing from these areas, suggesting that the acquisition of feathers in dinosaurs was a whole-body event. The bottoms of bird feet are covered in small, keeled scale-like structures known as reticulae. Evolutionary developmental studies on these scale-like structures have revealed that they are composed entirely of alpha keratin (true epidermal scales are composed of a mix of alpha and beta keratin). These data have led some researchers to suggest that reticulae are in fact highly truncated feathers.

==Insects and other arthropods==
The term &quot;scutum&quot; is also used in insect anatomy, as an alternative name for the anterior portion of the mesonotum (and, technically, the metanotum, though rarely applied in that context).

In the hard ticks, the Ixodidae, the scutum is a rigid, sclerotised plate on the anterior dorsal surface, just posterior to the head. In species with eyes, the eyes are on the surface of the scutum. The flexible exoskeleton posterior to the rigid scutum of the female tick, is called the alloscutum, the region that stretches to accommodate the blood with which the mature female tick becomes d. Males do not engorge nearly as drastically as females, so they do not need a flexible alloscutum; instead the rigid scutum covers practically the entire dorsal surface posterior to the head, and may be referred to specifically as the conscutum. 

In some species of Opiliones, fused abdominal segments are referred to as a scutum.

<text>John Hutt (24 July 1795 – 9 April 1880) was Governor of Western Australia from 1839 to 1846.

== Life ==
Born in London on 24 July 1795, John Hutt was the fourth of 13 children of Richard Hutt of Appley Towers, Ryde, Isle of Wight. He was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, and in 1815 inherited &quot;Appley Towers&quot;. He is said to have lived extravagantly, and eventually found it necessary to sell his estate and enter the Madras Civil Service. When he did so is unknown, but in about 1830 he was collector of the North Arcot district. He later became Governor of North Arcot.

Along with his brother William Hutt, John Hutt was heavily involved in the arrangements for the establishment of the colony of South Australia. He was recommended to the position of first Governor of South Australia, but was instead appointed to succeed Sir James Stirling as Governor of Western Australia. He took office on 1 January 1839, holding the position until resigning his commission on 19 February 1846.

Politically a liberal, one of Hutt&#x27;s first actions as governor was to increase the membership of the Western Australian Legislative Council by adding four unofficial nominees. He also oversaw many changes in the colony&#x27;s land regulations, especially in the enforcement of the conditions governing land grants. It was said that &quot;... the acts of the Governor at this time helped materially to save the infant settlement from utter disaster, even though eventually he may have erred on the side of over-caution.&quot;

Hutt&#x27;s attitude to the Aboriginal peoples of Western Australia was notably different from that of both Stirling and most of the settlers. Relations between the settlers and the natives had deteriorated badly in the final years of Stirling&#x27;s reign, with natives regularly spearing stock, robbing houses, and occasionally murdering settlers. Stirling&#x27;s response was to attempt to subdue the Aboriginal people through harsh punishment. In contrast, Hutt implemented a policy of protecting the rights of Aboriginal people and educating them where possible, intending to integrate them into the British legal system so as to prevent extrajudicial conflict between Aboriginal Australians and settlers by having disputes and conflicts between them settled by way of the rule of law. His approach made him very unpopular with frontier settlers, who thought themselves more in need of protection than the natives. Hutt developed a personal interest in the languages and culture of the Aboriginal peoples, and helped fund George Fletcher Moore&#x27;s book A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia.

In 1841, John Hutt founded the first Freemasons lodge in Western Australia, named the &#x27;Lodge of St John&#x27; No. 485 under the English Masonic constitution, later becoming the first Lodge consecrated under the Western Australian constitution in 1901. The lodge still meets in the Perth suburb of Kingsley to this day.

After resigning as Governor of Western Australia, Hutt returned to England, where he apparently went through more money. He joined the Canterbury Association on 27 March 1848 as one of its first members, but on 29 March 1850 resigned both its chairmanship and membership. Edward Gibbon Wakefield dedicated his book &quot;Art of Colonization&quot; to Hutt. For a while he lived in Chelsea Hospital. He died, unmarried, in his brother&#x27;s house on 9 April 1880.

<doc id="1066222" wikidata="Q134130" url="?curid=1066222" title="Peter Gabriel (1982 album)">
<text>Peter Gabriel is the fourth studio album by the English rock musician Peter Gabriel. In the United States and Canada, the album was released by Geffen Records with the title Security. Some music streaming services refer to it as Peter Gabriel 4: Security. A German-language version, entitled Deutsches Album (&quot;German Album&quot;), was also released. The album saw Gabriel expanding on the post-punk and world music influences from his 1980 self-titled record, and earned him his first US top 40 single with &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;.

Instead of working with Hipgnosis on the cover art as he did for his previous three albums, Gabriel turned to sculptor Malcolm Poynter. The image is of Gabriel&#x27;s face, based on an experimental videotape recorded by Poynter and heavily distorted through the use of flexible mirrors, Fresnel lenses, and lighting techniques.

The album was remastered with most of Gabriel&#x27;s catalogue in 2002.

== Recording ==
The album was recorded in 1981 at Ashcombe House in Somerset, half a mile from where Gabriel was living. The album was an early example of digital recording, having been mixed to a Sony PCM-1610 digital 2-track. The songs contain many unique sounds from the sampler/synthesizer Fairlight CMI. The first two weeks of recordings involved use of the Mobile One, a London-based recording truck which offered 46-track recording facilities.

== Songs ==
The songs of this album cover a wide variety of subject matter. &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; is based on Swiss psychologist Carl Jung&#x27;s experience watching a group of drummers and dancers in Kenya, during which he became overwhelmed and worried that the music and dancing would subsume him. &quot;San Jacinto&quot; reflects on the fear and pain experienced by an Indigenous American man who sees his culture overwhelmed by modern white society, based on a story told to Gabriel by an Apache man. &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot;, a meditation on jealousy, uses imagery of a primate to describe personal anxieties. &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; deals with a theme of healing, through trust, which is further explored on later albums. &quot;The Family and the Fishing Net&quot; compares a modern-day wedding to a voodoo sacrifice. &quot;Wallflower&quot; is about the treatment of political prisoners in Latin America during the 1980s.

Larry Fast, who played synthesizer, mentioned during a presentation on Moog synthesizers that the working title for &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; was &quot;Jung in Africa&quot;, the working title for &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; was &quot;Black Bush&quot;, and the working title for &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; was &quot;93&quot; – this was the number of the Linn LM-1 pattern used on the track. Additionally, in the &quot;South Bank Show&quot; documentary on the album, the working title for &quot;I Have the Touch&quot; was shown to be &quot;Hands&quot;.

Gabriel discussed several of the songs in an interview with DJ Alan Freeman:
*&quot;The Family and the Fishing Net&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s basically a wedding song, but it&#x27;s more an approach from the undercurrents of the wedding ritual. There are quite a lot of situations that we accept as perfectly normal and regular, traditional, that have this element of ritual that makes deep impressions on the psyche. And this is a somewhat impressionistic account of a wedding. I&#x27;d also been reading quite a lot of Dylan Thomas at the time, so there is that influence in the lyric writing.&quot;
*&quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;: &quot;It is part [hymn] and part the sort of faith healing aspect, which I think occurs in that and in &#x27;Kiss of Life&#x27; too… I&#x27;m convinced that we have abilities within ourselves that are not really acknowledged yet. There&#x27;s also the fairly dry, urban images in the verses, and then there&#x27;s the sense of cleansing through this laying-on of hands. There&#x27;s the screaming for the hands to be laid on in the choruses.&quot;
*&quot;Wallflower&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Wallflower&#x27; began almost as a love song. In fact, that&#x27;s probably the oldest of the songs. I started doing a version of it on the third album, which was never finished. And then I rerecorded it for this one. The Amnesty programme that they were running on the television (possibly &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball&quot;) made quite a big dent on me as a prisoner of conscience situation. And I thought that the emotion that&#x27;s in the song could be usefully directed with that sort of lyric. So, after a certain amount of soul-searching, I decided to go for it on this album. And it feels real to me, so I&#x27;m quite pleased with it.&quot;

== Title ==
As with his previous three albums, the album is titled &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot;. In the United States and Canada Geffen Records issued the album under the title &quot;Security&quot; to differentiate it from his previous releases. The title was changed with Gabriel&#x27;s reluctant agreement. The new title was displayed in a sticker on top of the LP sleeve&#x27;s shrink-wrap and on the disc labels. Whilst Gabriel provided the title himself, the album was officially known as &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; in other territories. The &quot;Security&quot; title was maintained on American and Canadian releases of the album until 2010, when it reverted to the original &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; title for reissues by Gabriel&#x27;s own Real World Records label.

==Critical reception==
In &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Howard Hampton wrote that &quot;though I have serious reservations about the album, it is just varied, provocative, and experimental enough to have radio programmers and fans murmuring &#x27;artistic breakthrough.&#x27; It even has commercial potential (up to a point – &quot;Asia&quot; it isn’t).&quot;

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic thought that the album &quot;continued where the third Gabriel album left off, sharing some of the same dense production and sense of cohesion, yet lightening the atmosphere and expanding the sonic palette.&quot; Erlewine partially attributed the album&#x27;s &quot;brighter feel&quot; to Gabriel&#x27;s embrace of African and Latin rhythms, which he thought were effective in complimenting the synthesizers. He asserted that certain songs required greater attention from the listener , including &quot;The Family and the Fishing Net,&quot; &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me,&quot; and &quot;Wallflower&quot;, but felt that some of them failed to deliver a rewarding experience.

== &quot;Deutsches Album&quot; ==
&quot;Deutsches Album&quot; (1982) is Gabriel&#x27;s German-language adaptation of his fourth album. It was released simultaneously with the English-language edition in Germany.

Like Gabriel&#x27;s previous German-language album, &quot;Ein deutsches album&quot; (1980), &quot;Deutsches Album&quot; differs from its English-language release in several ways. The album has a different running order: &quot;San Jacinto&quot; is swapped with &quot;The Family and the Fishing Net&quot; (here, &quot;Das Fischernetz&quot;). Some of the songs are substantially remixed and are, for instance, 15–30 seconds longer or shorter than their international versions. Track eight gains a final coda not found on the English version, while track seven has an earlier instrumental fade. The background vocals are redone in German. In the third track, a shouted nonsense refrain has been added. All songs were written by Peter Gabriel with &quot;Texte&quot; (lyrics) by Peter Gabriel and .

===Track listing===

#&quot;Der Rhythmus der Hitze&quot; – 5:36
#&quot;Das Fischernetz&quot; – 6:45

== In other media ==
&quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot; appears in the opening scene of &quot;Evan&quot;, an episode aired during the first season of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Gabriel, who had seven songs used, had the most songs featured by a solo artist in the series. He is also the only artist to have had a song used in four of the show&#x27;s five seasons. (None of his songs were used in the second season, though &quot;Take Me Home&quot; by Phil Collins, which features backing vocals by Gabriel, was used in the second-season premiere.) The song was also used in the feature film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, and in the commercials for the 2001 film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;.

&quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; was featured on the 1987 film &quot;Project X&quot; (starring Matthew Broderick and Helen Hunt). The song was referenced in the 1988, Season 6, Episode 17 of the American sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;. Lillith says she will never be able to hear &quot;Shock the Monkey&quot; again without crying. The song also appeared in the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Raisins&quot;.

&quot;I Have the Touch&quot; featured in the 1988 film &quot;The Chocolate War&quot;. An alternate version of the track was featured on the 1996 film &quot;Phenomenon&quot;, starring John Travolta. A cover version by Heather Nova was featured in &quot;The Craft&quot;.

&quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; appears in &quot;Crossbreed&quot;, a fifth season episode of &quot;The Americans&quot;. It was the third appearance of a Gabriel song in the series, the first being &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; in the season one finale, &quot;The Colonel&quot;, and the second being &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; in the third episode of season two, &quot;The Walk In.&quot;

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Clarke KCH (1793 – 11 February 1847) was Governor of Western Australia from 1846 until his death in 1847.

Andrew Clarke was born in Donegal, Ireland in 1793. He entered the British Army as an ensign in the 8th West India Regiment (without purchase) at the age of 13 in 1806, and rose rapidly through the ranks. In 1808 he transferred to the 46th Foot as lieutenant, again without purchase. At the age of 18, he was given temporary command of the troops in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. In 1813 he became a captain and went to New South Wales with his regiment. In 1818 he was in India, and in 1823 he married a widow named Frances Lardner, while on leave in England. A son was born in July 1824. In 1825 he purchased a majority. He returned to Europe in 1833, was created a knight of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order in 1837, was promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the Army in 1838, and purchased the lieutenant-colonelcy of his regiment in 1839. In 1842 Colonel Clarke took his regiment to the West Indies and was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of St. Lucia, which he left in 1844. In the following year he exchanged into the 41st Foot and was appointed Governor of Western Australia, where he arrived on 26 January 1846. He became ill not long afterward and died on 11 February 1847.

Andrew&#x27;s Clarke&#x27;s son, also named Andrew Clarke, held a number of important public positions for the colony of Victoria, and was for a time a Member of its Legislative Assembly. For six years, he was the governor of the Straits Settlements in Malaya. His stepdaughter, Fanny Jackson, married George Fletcher Moore. Amongst his nephews was the Australian novelist and poet Marcus Clarke.

<doc id="1066237" wikidata="Q4546473" url="?curid=1066237" title="103rd (Tyneside Irish) Brigade">
<text>The Tyneside Irish Brigade was a British First World War infantry brigade of Kitchener&#x27;s Army, raised in 1914. Officially numbered the 103rd (Tyneside Irish) Brigade, it contained four Pals battalions from Newcastle upon Tyne, largely made up of men of Irish extraction. (Another Newcastle brigade — the 102nd (Tyneside Scottish) — contained Tynesiders with Scottish connections).

== History ==
The brigade&#x27;s four battalions were known as the 1st to 4th Tyneside Irish. When taken over by the British Army, these became battalions of the Royal Northumberland Fusiliers:
*24th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (1st Tyneside Irish)
*25th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (2nd Tyneside Irish)
*26th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (3rd Tyneside Irish)
*27th Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (4th Tyneside Irish)
The reserve battalions were the 30th and 34th (Reserve) Battalions, Northumberland Fusiliers (Tyneside Irish).

Along with the 101st and 102nd Brigades, the Tyneside Irish made up the 34th Division which arrived in France in January 1916 and first saw action in the Battle of the Somme that year. On the first day on the Somme, the 34th Division attacked astride the Albert-Bapaume road at La Boisselle. The brigade&#x27;s task was to follow up the main attack by the 101st and 102nd Brigades and advance on a line from Pozières to Contalmaison.

Advancing at the same time as the main attack, the brigade started from the reserve trenches on the Tara-Usna Line. The four battalions, marching in extended line (from left to right; the 2nd, 3rd, 1st and 4th), advanced down into Avoca Valley and then up the other side to the British front-line trench. From there they had to cross no man&#x27;s land, pass through the German front-line and advance to their objectives. However, the main attack was an almost complete failure and the Tyneside Irish were utterly exposed to the machine guns of the German defences. The brigade suffered heavy casualties even before its battalions reached the British front-line. Opposite La Boisselle the brigade was halted but on the right, elements of the 1st and 4th battalions were able to advance up &#x27;Sausage Valley&#x27; and pass through the German front-line. Two small parties met up behind the German support trench and pushed on towards their objective of Contalmaison. Their effort was in vain as they were eventually killed or captured.

The 1st battalion suffered 620 casualties on 1 July (18 officers and 602 other ranks), its commander, Lieutenant Colonel L.M. Howard, was among the dead. The 4th battalion suffered 539 casualties (20 officers and 519 other ranks). The commanders of the 2nd and 3rd battalions were both wounded, as was the brigade commander, Brigadier General N.J.G. Cameron.

The brigade&#x27;s losses on 1 July were so severe that on the 6th, it, along with the 102nd (Tyneside Scottish) Brigade, was transferred to the 37th Division, swapping with the 112th Brigade. The two brigades returned to the 34th Division on 22 August.

In February 1918 the 1st, 3rd and 4th Tyneside Irish battalions were disbanded and the remaining battalion, the 2nd, was transferred to the 116th Brigade of the 39th Division. From then on the Tyneside Irish Brigade ceased to exist and the brigade was simply the 103rd Brigade.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Chidley Irwin, KH (22 March 1794 – 31 March 1860) was acting Governor of Western Australia from 1847 to 1848.

Born in 1794 in Drogheda, Ireland, Frederick Chidley Irwin was the son of Reverend James Irwin. Some sources give the year 1788 as his birthyear. In 1808, he was commissioned into the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. He saw service in Spain and Portugal, and took part in several major battles of the Peninsula War, for which he was awarded a medal. In 1816-17 he was stationed in Cape of Good Hope, and later in Ceylon.

In 1828, the British government decided to establish a colony on the western coast of Australia, and a cousin of Irwin&#x27;s, James Stirling, was appointed its first Lieutenant-Governor. Irwin was subsequently sent to the colony as a major in command of a detachment of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, whose mission was to protect and help establish the colony. He arrived with his men on board HMS &quot;Sulphur&quot; in June 1829, six days after the arrival of the first settlers and Stirling on the &quot;Parmelia&quot;.

Irwin&#x27;s position as officer commanding the troops afforded him the further position of vice chairman of the Legislative Council appointed by Stirling in January 1831. From September 1832 until September 1833, Irwin was temporarily appointed to act as administrator of the colony while Stirling was in England.

During Irwin&#x27;s period in charge the colony experienced difficulty in its relations with the Aboriginal people, and both colonists and Aboriginals were killed in different encounters such as the Pinjarra Massacre. After the killing of several settlers Irwin placed a bounty on the heads of the most aggressive Noongar warriors, including Yagan and Midgegooroo. This was to be among the most controversial of Irwin&#x27;s initiatives during his tenure in the Swan River Colony. According to his account, immediately after a series of skirmishes Irwin conferred with his Executive Council &#x27;to take such steps for a prompt and summary retaliation, as the means at my disposal admitted.&#x27; A proclamation was issued and published in the Perth Gazette offering a reward of 30 pounds for the capture &#x27;dead or alive&#x27; of Yagan, and 20 pounds of &#x27;Midgigooroo&#x27; and Munday. The proclamation declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws &#x27;deprived of the protection of British laws, and I do hereby authorise and command all and every His Majesty&#x27;s subjects residents in any part of this colony to capture, or aid or assist in capturing the body of the said &#x27;Egan&#x27; DEAD OR ALIVE, and to produce the said body forthwith before the nearest Justice of the Peace.&#x27; Frederick Irwin rationalized his actions to the Secretary of State in the following terms: This pecuniary stimulus has had the hoped for effect, by bringing forward some efficient volunteers among the Settlers whose ----- and occupations have necessarily given them a more intimate knowledge of the haunts of the natives in the neighbourhood of the settled district than is possessed by the Military, but no volunteers have received permission to act unless headed by a Magistrate or a Constable. Parties of the Military have also been in constant movement, traversing the bush is such directions as reports or conjecture rendered most likely to lead to a discovery of the lurking place of the offending tribes. These parties have all received express instructions to attempt the lives of no other than the three outlaws, unless hostility on the part of others of the tribe should render it necessary in self defense. I am happy to say these measures have already been attended with considerable effect. The whole of this hostile tribe have been harassed by the constant succession of parties sent against them, and in some instances have been hotly pursued to a considerable distance in different directions.

By the time Irwin&#x27;s dispatch had been received in London, Midgegooroo had been captured and executed. Despite his efforts to convince his superiors that his actions were justified, Irwin was criticised by the Secretary of State, who would have preferred a sentence of imprisonment, believing that execution would do little to improve relationships between the traditional owners and the colonists. But as Irwin intended, the search for Midgegooroo, Yagan and Munday proceeded quickly as the military and private settlers combed the region. One volunteer party led by a colonist named Thomas Hunt (according to G.F. Moore, &#x27;a most appropriate name&#x27; who had previously been a constable in London) headed south &#x27;in the direction of the Murray&#x27; and came across a number of &#x27;native huts&#x27; not far from the south shore of the Swan. They &#x27;routed&#x27; the Aboriginal people there, and pursued a group south, shooting and killing one man who was believed to be the brother of Midgegooroo and according to Moore, bringing his ears home &#x27;as a token.&#x27; According to the Perth Gazette, throughout the period immediately after the proclamation, Midgegooroo remained near the property of the Drummonds on the Helena River &#x27;employed as he usually had been of late in taking care of the women and children of the tribe&#x27; and clearly unaware of his outlaw status and his impending doom. On Thursday 16 May, a military party led by Captain Ellis, acting on information that Midgegooroo was in the area, joined forces with a number of civilians, including Thomas Hardey and J. Hancock. After camping overnight, the next morning they came across Midgegooroo and his young son: The old man finding a retreat impossible, became desperate; Jeffers, a private of the 63rd ... rushed forward and seized him by the hair, Captain Ellis seized his spears and broke them in his hand, he still retained the barbed ends, with which he struck at Jeffers repeatedly; the alarm he created by crying out for Yagan, and the apprehensions of his escaping, required the exercise of the greatest firmness on the part of Captain Ellis to accomplish his being brought in alive. The capture of this man as effected in a masterly manner, and redounds highly to the credit of Captain Ellis. ... Midgegooroo in his dungeon presents a most pitiable object. In the same issue, the Perth Gazette went on to invite citizens to &#x27;forward the ends of justice&#x27; by coming forward with their evidence of Midgegooroo&#x27;s wrongdoings, indicative of the close relationship between the early colonial media, the Government and the nascent system of justice. The Perth Gazette constitutes one of the principle records of the events over the next few days, and it is difficult to be definite about the chronological sequence between Midgegooroo&#x27;s capture on 17 May and execution on the 22nd. It appears likely that Irwin spent the period weighing up his alternatives, consulting with the Executive Council as well as men such as G.F. Moore who, as well as being a private colonist, held the official post of Commissioner of the Civil Court. On Monday 20 May, Moore records a meeting with Irwin and hints that his personal view was that Midgegooroo should be transported but there was a strong public sentiment that he should be executed; &#x27;there is a great puzzle to know what to do with him. The populace cry loudly for his blood, but it is a hard thing to shoot him in cold blood. There is a strong intention of sending him into perpetual banishment in some out of the way place.&#x27; Irwin told the Secretary of State he had conducted a &#x27;patient examination&#x27; and had received statements from &#x27;several credible witnesses&#x27;, twelve-year-old Ralph Entwhistle, John Staunton of the 63rd Regiment of Foot, Charles Bourne, constable Thomas Hunt, James Lacey, Thomas Yule (sworn before Magistrates at Fremantle) and John Ellis. Each gave brief details of Midgegooroo&#x27;s alleged crimes, and identified the prisoner as the same man. Irwin reported that he gave &#x27;much anxious consideration&#x27; to Midgegooroo&#x27;s punishment: &quot;The experiment of confinement, which had been tried to some extent in the case of the three Natives whose transportation to Carnac Island and ultimate escape I have reported to your Lordship in a former dispatch appeared to have produced no good effect on the subjects of that trial, and the age of the prisoner in question apparently exceeding fifty years, forbad any sanguine hopes from such an experiment in his case.&quot; 
There was no trial, even in the sense of an informal hearing. Midgegooroo was clearly not allowed the opportunity to give evidence or defend himself and indeed it is probable that he did not understand what was being alleged.
By 22 May, Irwin had made up his mind: &quot;With the unanimous advice of the Council, I therefore decided on his execution as the only sure mode of securing the Colony from an enemy, who was doubly dangerous from his apparently implacable hostility and from his influence as an acknowledged Chief. The latter circumstance being also calculated to render his death a more striking example.&quot; The Perth Gazette recorded the execution as follows: &quot;In the absence of a Sherriff, the warrant was directed to the Magistrates of the District of Perth, the duty therefore devolved upon J. Morgan Esq., as Government Resident, who immediately proceeded to carry the sentence into execution. The death warrant was read aloud to the persons assembled who immediately afterwards went inside the Jail, with the Constables and the necessary attendants, to prepare the Prisoner for his fate. Midgegooroo, on seeing that preparations were making [sic.] to punish him, yelled and struggled most violently to escape. These efforts availed him little, in less than five minutes he was pinioned and blindfolded, and bound to the outer door of the Jail. The Resident then reported to his Honor the Lieutenant Governor (who was on the spot accompanied by the Members of the Council), that all was prepared, – the warrant being declared final – he turned around and gave the signal to the party of the 63rd [which had volunteered] to advance and halt at 6 paces, – they then fired – and Midgegooroo fell. – The whole arrangement and execution after the death warrant had been handed over to the Civil Authorities, did not occupy half an hour.&quot; 
Irwin reported simply: &#x27;He was accordingly shot, in front of the jail at Perth on the 22 Ultimo.&#x27; Moore also recorded the execution although it is not clear whether he was a witness: &#x27;The native Midgegoroo, after being fully identified as being a principal in 3 murders at least, was fastened to the gaol door &amp; fired on by a Military party, receiving 3 balls in his head, one in his body.&#x27; According to the Perth Gazette, the execution was witnessed by a &#x27;great number of persons ... although the Execution was sudden and the hour unknown.&#x27; &quot;The feeling which was generally expressed was that of satisfaction at what had taken place, and in some instances loud and vehement exaltation, which the solemnity of the scene, – a fellow human being – although a native – launched into eternity – ought to have suppressed.&quot;

The aftermath it appears from the extant record that, while there was a crowd in attendance at the execution, few if any Aboriginal people were present. The boy who was captured along with Midgegooroo, who was identified as his son &#x27;Billy&#x27; (later referred to also as &#x27;young Midgegooroo&#x27;) was estimated to be between five and eight years old. He was removed &#x27;out of sound and hearing of what was to happen to his father and has since been forwarded to the Government Schooner, Ellen, now lying off Garden Island, with particular instructions from the Magistrates to ensure him every protection and kind treatment.&#x27; Irwin informed the Secretary of State that &#x27;the child has been kept in ignorance of his father&#x27;s fate, and it is my present intention to retain him in confinement, and by kind treatment I am in hope from his tender age he may be so inured to civilized habits as to make it improbable he will revert to a barbarous life when grown up.&#x27; The Noongar population appears to have remained unaware of Midgegooroo&#x27;s fate, possibly to ensure that the news would not reach the feared Yagan. Four days after the execution, G. F. Moore recorded an encounter with Yagan near his homestead when he arrived with Munday, Migo and seven others, possibly with the aim of finding out from Moore what had happened to his father. Moore, caught by surprise, decided to conceal the truth from Yagan, whereupon Yagan told him that if Midgegooroo&#x27;s life was taken, he would retaliate by killing three white men. Six days later, it appears that news of the killing had still not penetrated the Noongar community for, when Moore was visited on 2 June by Weeip, Yagan&#x27;s son Narral, and some women, they asked him again about Midgegooroo and his young son. Moore again concealed the execution but assured them that his son &#x27;would come back again by &amp; bye.&#x27; Two days later, Moore recorded that thefts of sheep and goats continued on the Canning River, and expressed his despair at the prospects for a people in whom he felt &#x27;a very great interest&#x27;: &#x27;These things are very dispiriting. I fear it must come to an act of extermination between us at last if we cannot graze our flocks in safety.&#x27; It was not until 11 July that the colonists succeeded in killing Yagan, his death at the hands of sixteen-year-old James Keats on the Upper Swan, who duly collected his reward and left the colony.

The Perth Gazette recorded its satisfaction at the deaths and believed that most of the citizenry supported the ruthless actions of the Government. Midgegooroo&#x27;s execution, it claimed, met with &#x27;general satisfaction ... his name has long rung in our ears, associated with every enormity committed by the natives; we therefore join cordially in commending this prompt and decisive measure.&#x27; On the other hand, it is clear that a number of colonists were unhappy with the actions of the government. Robert Lyon, who published his account of the period in 1839 after he had left the colony, wrote that while the killing of Midgegooroo and Yagan was &#x27;applauded by a certain class&#x27;, they were &#x27;far from being universally approved. Many were silent, but some of the most respectable of the settlers loudly expressed their disapprobation.&#x27; There was criticism also from other Australian colonies about the execution of Midgegooroo. The Hobart Town Review of 20 August 1833 was full of vitriol for Irwin&#x27;s actions: &quot;It is hard to conceive any offence on the part of the poor unfortunate wretch that could justify the putting him to death, even in the open field, but to slay him in cool blood to us appears a cruel murder without palliation.&quot;

Irwin, however, was convinced that his actions were merited. Writing in England about two years after the events of 1833, he asserted that &#x27;these acts of justice so completely succeeded in their object of intimidating the natives on the Swan and Canning Rivers that recent accounts from the colony represent the shepherds and others in the habit of going about the country, as having for a considerable laid aside their usual precaution of carrying firearms, so peaceable had the conduct of those tribes become.&#x27;

In September 1833, after more than four years in Western Australia, Irwin returned to England, partly to give an account to the Colonial Office of the events that had occurred in the colony while it was under his charge. While there, he published &quot;The State and Position of Western Australia&quot;, the first published account of the colony. He also sought religious assistance for the colony, resulting in the arrival of the colony&#x27;s first missionary, Louis Giustiniani, in 1836. He married his wife Elizabeth Courthope, sister of auditor-general of Western Australia in December 1836. In 1837, having been promoted to Major, he returned to Western Australia, and was made permanent Commandant of the Western Australian Forces. He was further promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in 1845.

On the death of Governor Andrew Clarke in February 1847, Irwin took office as acting Governor until the arrival of the new governor, Charles Fitzgerald, in August 1848. His administration was extremely unpopular with the settlers of Western Australia, due to both the poor financial state of the colony and his stern character, and the arrival of Fitzgerald was widely celebrated. Irwin retired from the army in 1854 and returned to England in 1856, where he died in Cheltenham in 1860.

In 1839 the explorer George Grey named the Irwin River after him while on his second disastrous exploration expedition along the Western Australian coast.

In 1948 the Irwin Army Barracks in Karrakatta were named after him, in recognition of his place in Western Australia&#x27;s military history.

In 1991 the Frederick Irwin Anglican School was opened and named in honour of his contributions to Western Australia.

<text>Charles Fitzgerald ( – 29 December 1887) was an officer in the British Royal Navy and Governor of The Gambia from 1844 until 1847, then Governor of Western Australia from 1848 to 1855.

Son of Robert Fitzgerald and Lucinda Jackson of Kilkee, county Clare, Ireland (then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), Fitzgerald joined the Royal Navy in March 1809, passed his examination in 1815, and was commissioned in March 1826. While in the naval service Fitzgerald was assigned to the Royal Navy&#x27;s West Africa Squadron which was tasked with interdicting the Atlantic slave trade, where he served with distinction.

Either during this time or possibly before, Fitzgerald became a staunch abolitionist and fierce opponent of slavery. In 1839 he seized two Spanish slave ships falsely flying the American flag. For legal reasons he escorted the ships to New York where the courts ruled them to be unlawful and Fitzgerald was allowed to take the freed slaves back to Sierra Leone. Severe weather resulted in a number of deaths during the return voyage. Subsequently Fitzgerald became involved in the notorious Amistad incident which was dramatized in the 1997 film &quot;Amistad&quot;; Fitzgerald was portrayed by actor Peter Firth. In 1840 he was sent home, promoted to the rank of commander and placed on half pay for medical reasons. 

In 1844 Fitzgerald was appointed as the colonial governor of British Gambia. His three-year tenure as governor was largely unremarkable although he gained a reputation for being sympathetic to the native population and was seen as something of a reformist. 

Fitzgerald&#x27;s administration of Western Australia saw numerous public works projects and an active campaign to encourage immigration by both voluntary colonists and convicts. This resulted in a dramatic improvement in infrastructure as well as an increase in population from roughly 5,000 to 12,000 at the end of his governorship. Soon after his arrival in Western Australia in 1848, Fitzgerald accompanied Augustus Gregory on an expedition in the Northampton region where Gregory and his brother had discovered lead the year before. An encounter with Aboriginal people resulted in Fitzgerald being speared in the leg and at least three Aborigines shot dead.

Following his return to England, his tenure as governor was reviewed with satisfaction and he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1857. After which Fitzgerald retired to his home in Kilkee Ireland where he died on December 29, 1887 at 96, an unusually advanced age for the time.

The town of Geraldton, Western Australia, was named after him.

<text>, born and also known as Dom Justo Takayama (c. 1552/1553 - 5 February 1615) was a Japanese Catholic daimyō and samurai during the Sengoku period that saw rampant anti-Catholic sentiment. 

Takayama was baptized into the Catholic Church in 1564 when he was twelve, though he later became disenfranchised from his religion due to his actions as a samurai. He eventually renewed his faith after a coming-of-age ritual near the age of 20. He renounced his samurai status to devote himself to Christianity and was exiled to Manila, where he lived until his death two months later.

His cause for sainthood began after his death and he was declared a Servant of God. Pope Francis beatified him on 21 January 2016; the celebration occurred on 7 February 2017 in Osaka with Cardinal Angelo Amato presiding on the pope&#x27;s behalf.

==Biography==
Dom Justo Takayama was the eldest son (thus the heir) of Takayama Tomoteru who was the lord of the Sawa Castle in the Yamato Province. His childhood name was Hikogorō (彦五郎). 

In 1564, his father converted to Roman Catholicism after meeting with Portuguese missionaries. Hikogorō was baptized as Justo (Latin: Iustus; Japanese: ジュスト or ユスト, based on Portuguese or Latin pronunciation). After his coming-of-age celebration his name was changed to Shigetomo (重友). However he is better known as Takayama Ukon (高山右近), &quot;Ukon&quot; being a title. Portuguese and Spanish Europeans also referred to him as Dom/Don Justo &quot;Ucondono&quot; (from 右近殿, &quot;Ukon-dono&quot;).

In 1571, he fought in an important and successful battle as part of his coming-of-age ritual which culminated in a duel to the death with a compatriot whom he killed; however, Takayama received grievous wounds in the process and during his convalescence realized he had cared little about Catholicism.

He married in 1574 and went on to have three sons (two died as infants) and one daughter. Justo and his father fought through the turbulent age to secure their position as a &quot;daimyō&quot;. He managed to acquire Takatsuki Castle (in Takatsuki, Osaka) and participated in the Ishiyama Hongan-ji War (1570-1580) under the warlord Oda Nobunaga. He also fought under the daimyō Toyotomi Hideyoshi during his rule&#x27;s earlier times, participating in the Battle of Yamazaki (1582), Battle of Shizugatake (1583) and Siege of Kagoshima (1587). 

During their domination of Takatsuki region, he and his father pushed their policies as &quot;kirishitan daimyōs&quot;. Several of their subjects converted to Catholicism under their influence. During his reign, Takayama destroyed numerous Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines in both Takatsuki and Akashi. 

However, Hideyoshi became hostile towards the Christian faith and in 1587 ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and that all Christian &quot;daimyōs&quot; should renounce their faith. While several daimyō obeyed this order and renounced Roman Catholicism, Justo proclaimed that he would not give up his faith and would rather give up his land and all that he owned.

Takayama lived under the protection of Maeda Toshiie until 1614 when Tokugawa Ieyasu (the ruler at the time) prohibited the Christian faith which resulted in Takayama&#x27;s expulsion from Japan. On 8 November 1614, with 300 other Japanese Christians, he left his home from Nagasaki. He arrived at Manila on 11 December 1614 where he received a warm welcome from the Spanish Jesuits and the local Filipinos. 

The governor Juan de Silva wished to provide him with an income to support him and his relations but he declined this offer saying he was no longer in a position to offer his services in exchange for income nor did he wish to act like a lord.

The colonial government of the Spanish Philippines offered to invade Japan and overthrow Tokugawa in order to protect Japanese Christians and place him in a position of great power and influence. Takayama declined to participate and even opposed the plan.

==Death==
After suffering from a violent fever, he died of illness at midnight on 3 or 5 February 1615, 44 days after arriving in Manila. The Spanish government gave him a Christian burial with full military honors befitting a daimyō. His remains were buried in the Jesuit church there. He is the only daimyō buried on Philippine soil.

==Memorials==

At Plaza Dilao in Paco, Manila, the last vestige of the old town where around 3000 Japanese immigrants lived after the expulsion, a statue of Takayama stands depicting him in the traditional samurai garb and a topknot. He is holding a sheathed katana that is pointed downward upon which hangs a figure of a crucified Jesus Christ. The University of Santo Tomas also has a statue in honor of Takayama in front of the Thomas Aquinas Research Complex building.

==Beatification==
His cause for sainthood started at a diocesan level which resulted in the validation of the process on 10 June 1994 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (CCS) were given all the boxes of documentation pertaining to the cause. The commencement to the cause saw him titled as a Servant of God. There had been failed attempts to start the cause in the past. The first attempt came in 1630 when the Manila priests decided to commence it but this failed due to the isolationist Japanese policies which prevented the collection of the documentation that was needed; the petition was presented but was rejected. The second attempt in 1965 failed due to several errors being made. In October 2012, a letter was presented to Pope Benedict XVI asking for the cause to be re-examined.

The positio dossier was submitted in 2013 to the competent authorities in Rome for further assessment. According to Cardinal Angelo Amato, the beatification would have occurred in 2015 on 21 October 2014 to Japanese pilgrims; 2015 marked four centuries after his death but the formal beatification did not occur since it was close to completion at that stage. His cause was to meant to confirm - in a rather unorthodox case - that Ukon was a martyr because of the treatment he received and because he renounced all he had to pursue and profess his faith.

Historical consultants met to discuss the cause on 10 December 2013, and the theologians met on 20 May 2014 to discuss and vote on the cause. The cardinals and bishop members of the CCS met on 18 June 2015 to make a final decision on the cause before it could go to Pope Francis for his approval, and they had to meet again on 12 January 2016. Pope Francis approved Takayama&#x27;s beatification on 21 January 2016; it was celebrated in Osaka on 7 February 2017 with Cardinal Amato presiding on the pope&#x27;s behalf.

<text>John Stephen Hampton (c. 1806 – 1 December 1869) was Governor of Western Australia from 1862 to 1868.

==Early life==
Little is known of John Hampton&#x27;s early life. His death certificate states that he was born in 1810, but other evidence suggests 1806 or perhaps 1807; these latter figures are considered more likely. He undertook medical studies at Edinburgh, graduating with a diploma of medicine in September 1828. He was appointed an assistant naval surgeon with &quot;Britannia&quot;, but shortly afterwards was transferred to &quot;Sphinx&quot;. In 1832 he was attached to the Plymouth dockyards, where he worked to prevent the spread of cholera. He later served on &quot;Savage&quot;, &quot;Firebrand&quot; and finally &quot;Portland&quot;. In December 1834 he was promoted to full surgeon, and in March 1843 became surgeon-superintendent. Between 1841 and 1845, Hampton was surgeon-superintendent on a series of convict ships to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land: &quot;Mexborough&quot;, &quot;Constant&quot; and &quot;Sir George Seymour&quot;.

==Comptroller General of Convicts in Tasmania==
Having served well on a number of convict ships to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, Hampton was appointed Comptroller-General of Convicts in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in May 1846. He arrived at the colony on 27 October 1846. During his time in the office, allegations of inhumanity and corruption were frequently published in the press. In 1855, the Tasmanian Legislative Council established a select committee to look into the allegations. Hampton was summonsed to appear in the House for questioning, but refused. The House then found him guilty of contempt and issued a warrant for his arrest, but both the police magistrate and the local sheriff refused to help arrest him. Hampton eventually wrote a letter to the Council, in which he agreed to remain under house arrest until the legality of the warrant had been established. The Council refused to accept this proposal, but a political crisis was averted when the Governor of Tasmania Fox Young appointed a judicial tribunal to pronounce on the legality of the warrant, then prorogued parliament.

While the tribunal was still sitting, Hampton obtained a leave of absence on grounds of ill health, and left the colony. The tribunal eventually returned a decision that the warrant was not legal. The Tasmanian Legislative Council then appealed to the Privy Council&#x27;s judicial committee, who again found in Hampton&#x27;s favour. Eventually the inquiry proceeded with evidence from Hampton. The final report presented findings that Hampton had engaged in corrupt practices, including the employment of convict labour for personal profit.

Not much is known of the next five years of Hampton&#x27;s life. He took no government service, spending some of the time in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on &quot;urgent private affairs&quot;.

==Governor of Western Australia==
In 1861, Hampton was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He arrived in the colony the following year, and immediately took far more direct control of Western Australia&#x27;s convict establishment than had his predecessors. He imposed a far stricter regime than in the past, with increased use of flogging as a punishment, and the reintroduction of solitary confinement. Hampton constantly quarrelled with the Comptroller General of Convicts and in 1866 he had him removed. Hampton then appointed his son George to act in the position. George Hampton had no particular qualifications for the position, and already held a number of other salaried positions. This &quot;unusually blatant act of nepotism&quot; was extremely unpopular within the colony, and was compounded when Hampton approved his son a living allowance, to which he was entitled but did not need since he lived in Government House. Thereafter, both Hamptons became figures of public hostility and ridicule within the colony.

The Government of Western Australia was in acute debt when Hampton took over as governor. He immediately imposed strict cost-cutting measures, including using convict labour instead of contract labour whenever possible. Within a year the colony had recovered from its financial problems, and a few years later was on a firm financial footing. His sound financial management endeared him to the Colonial Office, and went some way to alleviating his unpopular public image. His vigorous public works program also met with strong approval by the colonists.

It is not known whether Hampton sought a second term as governor. 

In 1868 George Hampton married the daughter of the photographer Alfred Stone.

On the expiry of his term in November 1868, he returned to England on &quot;Emily Smith&quot;. His wife died shortly after their arrival in England, and Hampton himself lived only until 1 December 1869.

==Legacy==
John Hampton has Hampton Park Primary School and Hampton Senior High School named after him.

<doc id="1066271" wikidata="Q891783" url="?curid=1066271" title="Vagabonds of the Western World">
<text>Vagabonds of the Western World is the third studio album by Irish hard rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1973. It was the band&#x27;s last album with original guitarist Eric Bell and the first to feature the artwork of Jim Fitzpatrick, whose work would appear on many subsequent albums by the band.

==Reception==
&quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Stuart Berman remarked how the band were &quot;starting to kick out the jams with greater confidence and consistency&quot; on this album, with Phil Lynott producing &quot;the sound of a spiritually adrift musician ecstatically discovering his true calling&quot; on &quot;The Rocker&quot;. Berman also commented favourably on the &quot;swinging&quot; &quot;Mama Nature Said&quot;, the &quot;gorgeous soul serenade &#x27;Little Girl in Bloom&#x27;&quot; and the title song. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic described the album as Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;first sonically satisfying album&quot;, with Lynott &quot;brimming with attitude and dangerous swagger&quot; on &quot;The Rocker&quot;, their &quot;first bona fide classic&quot;. He described &quot;Little Girl in Bloom&quot; as &quot;absolutely flawless&quot;, and noted Eric Bell&#x27;s slide guitar playing on the environmentalist &quot;Mama Nature Said&quot;, but criticised &quot;The Hero and the Madman&quot; and &quot;Slow Blues&quot; as &quot;overblown&quot; and &quot;tepid&quot; respectively. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff remarked on the album&#x27;s &quot;crusty sound quality and style-searching waywardness&quot;, mixing influences ranging from American blues, to Motown, to early metal. He rated &quot;Vagabonds of the Western World&quot; the lowest of all Thin Lizzy&#x27;s albums for four tracks which &quot;seem either simple and out-of-character or dated&quot;, &quot;bearing scant few traces of the high class Lizzy imprint.&quot;

==Track listings==

When the album was repackaged for CD in 1991, it included the respective A and B-sides of the two singles released at around the same time. &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; was Lizzy&#x27;s first hit.

===Remastered and expanded release===
On 11 October 2010 &quot;Vagabonds of the Western World&quot; was reissued as a 2CD deluxe edition. This version was remastered with bonus tracks. The original album and bonus material is featured on disc 1, while disc 2 features bonus material.

<text>George Geoffrey Dawson (25 October 1874 – 7 November 1944) was editor of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1912 to 1919 and again from 1923 until 1941. His original last name was Robinson, but he changed it in 1917. He married Hon. Margaret Cecilia Lawley, daughter of Arthur Lawley, 6th Baron Wenlock, in 1919.

==Early life==
Dawson was born 25 October 1874, in Skipton-in-Craven, Yorkshire, the eldest child of George Robinson, a banker, and his wife Mary (née Perfect). He attended Eton College and Magdalen College, Oxford. His academic career was distinguished; he took a First in Classical Moderations in 1895 and a First in Literae Humaniores (&#x27;Greats&#x27;) in 1897. In 1898 he was elected a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford, a position he held for the rest of his life. He chose a career in civil service, entering in 1898 by open examination. After a year at the Post Office, he was transferred to the Colonial Office and in 1901 he was selected as assistant private secretary to Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. Later the same year Dawson obtained a similar position with Lord Milner, high commissioner in South Africa.

As Milner&#x27;s assistant, Dawson participated in the establishment of British administration in South Africa in the aftermath of the Boer War. While there, he became a member of &quot;Milner&#x27;s kindergarten&quot;, a circle of young administrators and civil servants whose membership included Leo Amery, Bob Brand, Philip Kerr, Richard Feetham, John Buchan and Lionel Curtis. United by a common aspiration for Imperial Federation, all later became prominent in the &quot;round table of Empire Loyalists&quot;.

==Career in journalism==
Milner wanted to ensure the support of the local newspapers after his return to England. He persuaded the owners of the &quot;Johannesburg Star&quot; to appoint Dawson as the paper&#x27;s editor. Dawson later parlayed this post into a position as the Johannesburg correspondent of &quot;The Times&quot; in February 1911; and then attracted the attention of Lord Northcliffe, owner of &quot;The Times&quot;, who appointed him editor of the paper in July 1912.

Dawson was unhappy, however, with the way that Northcliffe used the paper as an instrument to further his own personal political agenda and broke with him, stepping down as editor in February 1919. Dawson returned to the post in 1923 after Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s death, when the paper&#x27;s ownership had passed to John Jacob Astor V. Bob Brand had become the Astors&#x27; brother-in-law, and it is thought that he introduced Dawson to the Astors&#x27; circle at Cliveden, the so-called Cliveden set presided over by Nancy Astor. 

In his second stint as editor, Dawson began to use the paper in the same manner as Lord Northcliffe had once done, to promote his own agenda. He also became a leader of a group of journalists that sought to influence national policy by private correspondence with leading statesmen. Dawson was close to both Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain. He was a prominent proponent and supporter of appeasement policies, after Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. He was a member of the Anglo-German Fellowship. Candid news despatches from Berlin by Norman Ebbutt that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy. Dawson explained to Lord Lothian on 23 May 1937: &quot;I should like to get going with the Germans. I simply cannot understand why they should apparently be so much annoyed with &quot;The Times&quot; at this moment. I spend my nights in taking out anything which I think will hurt their susceptibilities and in dropping little things which are intended to soothe them&quot;.

In March 1939, however, &quot;The Times&quot; reversed course and called for war preparations. Dawson was a lifelong friend and dining companion of Edward Wood, later Lord Halifax, who was Foreign Secretary in the period 1938–1940. He promoted the policies of the Baldwin/Chamberlain governments of the period 1936–1940. Dawson retired in September 1941 and died on 7 November 1944 in London. He was succeeded as editor by Robert Barrington-Ward.

<text>Nowy Kurier Warszawski, initially Nowy Kurjer Warszawski (&quot;New Courier of Warsaw&quot;) was a German propaganda newspaper issued in the occupied Poland during World War II. Its name was coined after a popular pre-war newspaper &quot;Kurier Warszawski&quot;, with which it had nothing to do but the name. According to German sources the newspaper was issued in 200 000 copies daily, but it was commonly boycotted by the Poles (often defaced with the Kotwica) and the numbers seem to be much overestimated.

== History ==

Following the Polish defeat against the joint Nazi German and Soviet Invasion of Poland of 1939, on 6 October German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland. The success of the invasion marked the end of the Second Polish Republic, though Poland never formally surrendered. On 8 October, after an initial period of military administration, Germany directly annexed western Poland and the former Free City of Danzig and placed the remaining block of territory under the administration of the newly established General Government.

Within the General Government all Polish newspapers were immediately banned. In their stead, the German authorities established eight Polish language daily newspapers as part of their propaganda machine aimed at subjugated nations. The largest of them was the Warsaw-based Nowy Kurier Warszawski with daily circulation of over 200,000 copies. By comparison, it is estimated that all German-published journals in occupied Poland had a circulation of 700,000 in 1941 and over 1 million in 1944.

The new newspaper drew its name from pre-war &quot;Kurier Warszawski&quot;, established in 1821 and highly popular in pre-war Warsaw. However, the &quot;New Courier&quot; had little to do with the original journal apart from the name and the printing press (in the former Dom Prasy building). The profile of the newspaper was akin to modern tabloid journalism. Apart from front line news, propaganda and overly optimistic reports on constant successes of the German Wehrmacht, the newspaper featured a collection of sensational crime stories, astrology, gossip columns and such. As such, the newspaper was primarily a tool of indoctrination, primarily of less-educated strata of Polish society.

Because of that it was commonly referred to by a variety of derogatory names. The most popular name, &quot;gadzinówka&quot; (Polish for &quot;Reptile [newspaper]&quot;) became a generic term for any foreign propaganda publication in standard Polish language. Other popular nicknames include Kurwar (abbreviation of the title, but also a pun on the Polish word &quot;kurwa&quot; - whore) and &quot;szmatławiec&quot; (Rag-journal).

Despite its clear propaganda flavour, the newspaper remained highly popular in Poland, as it included useful information on new regulations introduced by the Germans and actual info on monthly food rations as well as many ads and obituaries. In addition, it was cheap: each issue was priced at only 20 groszes (later 25), an average price for a newspaper in pre-war Poland, but very inexpensive in reality of rampant hyperinflation in war-torn Poland.

Following the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, the headquarters of the newspaper was moved to Łódź, where it continued to circulate until January 1945. After the war at least 15 former employees of the New Warsaw Courier had been tried and sentenced to prison for their collaboration with the Nazis during the war.
