<text>Wendy Williams Hunter (; born July 18, 1964) is an American former broadcaster, media personality, and writer. From 2008 to 2021, she hosted the nationally syndicated television talk show &quot;The Wendy Williams Show.&quot;

Prior to television, Williams was a radio DJ and host and quickly became known in New York City as a shock jock. She gained notoriety for her on-air spats with celebrities and was the subject of the 2006 VH1 reality television series &quot;The Wendy Williams Experience,&quot; which broadcast events surrounding her radio show.

Williams&#x27;s other endeavors include authoring several books, appearances in various films and television shows, touring her comedy show, and her own product lines, including a fashion line, a jewelry collection and a wig line. Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2009. On her 50th birthday, the council of Asbury Park, New Jersey, renamed the street on which she grew up Wendy Williams Way.

In 2023, Williams retired from broadcasting after being diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia.
==Early life==
Wendy Joan Williams was born on July 18, 1964, in Asbury Park, New Jersey. She is the second of three children born to Shirley () and Thomas Dwayne Williams. The couple had a combined three master&#x27;s degrees; Shirley was a special education teacher while Thomas was a teacher and school principal who in 1969 became the first black school administrator in Red Bank, New Jersey. Following race riots in Asbury Park in 1970, the family moved to the predominantly white, middle income suburb of Wayside in Ocean Township, New Jersey. They attended a Baptist church and visited the town of Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts, each summer. As a child, doctors recommended Williams be medicated to control her hyperactivity. She suffered from poor body image due to the diet her parents put her on after gaining weight in elementary school. Williams was a Brownie in the Girl Scouts and volunteered as a candy striper. Her parents believed she would become a nurse.
Williams acted as an announcer at her younger brother&#x27;s Little League Baseball games. She graduated from Ocean Township High School in 1982 among four black students, ranking 360th in the class of 363. Her academic performance contrasted with that of her older sister, who received a university scholarship at the age of 16. As she was able to use &quot;white&quot; diction instead of African-American Vernacular English, Williams&#x27;s white classmates considered her one of their own and freely used the word &quot;nigger&quot; around her. She did not get along with the other black students and said their only commonality was smoking cannabis. According to Williams, she did not listen to hip hop music and instead listened to rock bands like AC/DC because they were popular with her classmates. Due to her suburban upbringing, Williams considers herself &quot;a multicultural woman who happens to be Black&quot;.

Williams attended Northeastern University in Boston with the intent of becoming a television anchor. Less than a month after starting, she switched from television communications to radio because she could advance her career faster—a move of which her parents disapproved. Williams graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in communication and, to appease her parents, a minor in journalism. She was a disc jockey for the college radio station, WRBB, where rapper LL Cool J was her first celebrity interviewee. As an intern for Matt Siegel at contemporary hit radio station WXKS-FM, Williams recapped the soap operas &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot; on air. In 2021, Williams revealed that she was date raped while in college.

==Media career==
===1986–1994: Career beginnings, WQHT, and WRKS===
Two weeks after graduating from Northeastern, Williams began her career as a disc jockey working for the small, calypso and reggae-oriented WVIS in Frederiksted, U.S. Virgin Islands, but disliked the role because she did not learn as much about radio from her colleagues as she expected. Due to low pay and isolation from her family, Williams began sending resumes and demo tapes of herself to other radio stations. She left WVIS after eight months and obtained a position at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WOL, but found its oldies radio format incompatible with her personality. Williams continued sending tapes to other stations and on November 1, 1987, began as a weekend fill-in on New York City&#x27;s WQHT. After the urban contemporary station hired her full-time to work overnight shifts, she left WOL.

Williams was fired from WQHT after two years and briefly worked overnight shifts at WPLJ before being hired by WRKS. Initially working as a fill-in, WRKS gave Williams a non-compete clause and permanent morning position in May 1990 after WBLS began poaching its employees. She joined Jeff Foxx and Spider Webb as part of the station&#x27;s &quot;Wake-Up Club&quot;. There, Williams began gossiping about rappers and celebrities during a segment called &quot;Dish the Dirt&quot;. Those she talked about, such as Bill Cosby and Russell Simmons, called the station and (unsuccessfully) demanded she be fired. As she grew into a popular radio personality, WRKS moved Williams to host the evening drive time slot in April 1991. By 1993, she was the highest-rated host in her time slot in the New York City market and received a &quot;Billboard&quot; Radio Award for R&amp;B Major Market Radio Air Personality of the Year.

Williams co-hosted American Urban Radio Networks&#x27; syndicated &quot;Top 30 USA&quot; song countdown program in 1993 and &quot;USA Music Magazine&quot; in 1994. By mid-1994, WRKS had suffered a ratings decline amid competition from hip hop-oriented WQHT, which was owned by Emmis Broadcasting. In an effort to reverse the trend, WRKS moved Williams back to mornings on September 26, 1994, where she hosted a program titled &quot;Wendy and Company&quot;. However, Emmis purchased WRKS less than three months later and transferred Williams to WQHT, where she began hosting the evening drive time slot on December 12, 1994. As WRKS was reformatted into an urban adult contemporary outlet geared toward older audiences, they believed Williams would better reflect WQHT&#x27;s younger demographic.

===1994–2001: WQHT, website, move to WUSL===
By this time, Williams attended parties to gain information which she would report on air in addition to reading tabloid newspapers. She continued gossip segments and gave relationship advice to teenage girls during &quot;Ask Wendy&quot;. Williams&#x27;s ratings increased dramatically after she read aloud a magazine article about an anonymous rapper confessing to being gay. She became known for speculating about his identity and spread rumors that there was not one, but multiple gay rappers who were not open about their sexuality. Among her insinuations was that Tupac Shakur was raped in prison, which he denied. Williams employed the term &quot;pinky&#x27;s up&quot; when alleging someone was gay and regularly used the slur &quot;faggot&quot;, which she considered to be inoffensive. Her comments contributed to an increase of homophobia in hip hop culture.

Williams created a website, www.gowendy.com, as an offshoot of her radio program. Featuring photos and rumors of celebrities, it received up to 100,000 views per day. In April 1997, WQHT suspended Williams for one week after mentioning her website on air, which displayed a doctored image of Bad Boy Records executive Sean Combs naked from the waist down having sex with another man. The station suspended Williams again in September 1997 for online comments insinuating that her colleague Angie Martinez&#x27;s boyfriend Q-Tip was gay. Upon her return after deleting the post a month later, Williams called the Bad Boy Records girl group Total &quot;broke hoes&quot; after their comments favoring her suspension. WQHT permanently removed Williams and her fans protested outside of their offices. By this time, Williams had received more than 50 letters from the station regarding her &quot;lack of good judgment&quot;. She speculated her removal was due to pressure from music industry executives and stood by her comments, stating: &quot;I stopped caring about artists when I realized it&#x27;s more lucrative to talk about them than with them.&quot;

She was fired from Hot 97 in 1998. Williams was hired by a Philadelphia urban station, WUSL (&quot;Power 99FM&quot;). She was very open about her personal life on air, discussing her miscarriages, breast enhancement surgery, and former drug addiction. She helped the station move from 14th place in the ratings to 2nd.

===2001–2008: WBLS===

In 2001, Williams returned to the New York airwaves when WBLS hired her full-time for a syndicated 2–6 p.m. time slot. Williams&#x27; friend, MC Spice of Boston, offered his voiceover services to the show, often adding short rap verses tailored specifically for Williams&#x27; show. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that her &quot;show works best when its elements – confessional paired with snarkiness – are conflated&quot;. By 2008, she was syndicated in Redondo Beach, California; Shreveport, Louisiana; Wilmington, Delaware; Toledo, Ohio; Columbia, South Carolina; Emporia, Virginia; Lake Charles, Louisiana; Tyler, Texas; and Alexandria, Louisiana, among other markets. Williams left her radio show in 2009 to focus on her television program and spend more time with her family.

Media outlets have described Williams&#x27;s 2003 interview with Whitney Houston as her most infamous. After Williams asked Houston about her marriage and breast implants, they began a shouting match and Houston said she would have fought Williams if she were younger. In a later interview with Williams, Houston&#x27;s confidant Robyn Crawford said they planned to confront her years earlier after she talked about Houston on air. Wu-Tang Clan performer Method Man had a personal and publicized conflict with Williams in 2006 after she revealed details about his wife&#x27;s cancer diagnosis.

===2008–2016: Breakthrough with &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; ===
In 2008, Debmar-Mercury offered Williams a six-week television trial of her own talk show. A syndicated daytime talk show hosted by Williams titled &quot;Wendy&#x27;s World&quot; was poised to debut in fall 1997, but never aired. On July 14, 2008, Williams debuted her daytime talk show, &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, in four cities during the summer of 2008. During the tryout, &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked that the show created a &quot;breakthrough in daytime&quot; by introducing the genre of the &quot;backtalk show&quot;. After a successful run, Fox signed a deal with Debmar-Mercury to broadcast the show nationally on their stations beginning in July 2009. In addition, BET picked up cable rights to broadcast the show at night. In 2010, BET started airing the show internationally in 54 countries through BET International. The show attracted 2.4 million daily viewers on average, with Williams trading off daily with Ellen DeGeneres as the number one female host on daytime television.
Williams hosted a game show for GSN called &quot;Love Triangle&quot; (2011) for which she and her husband Kevin Hunter served as executive producers. Williams played a judge on the Lifetime network show &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot; (2011) and served as a guest judge on &quot;The Face&quot; (2013). Williams was paired with Tony Dovolani as a contestant on the twelfth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;; she was eliminated second. Williams later alleged the show&#x27;s producers portrayed her as an angry black woman, a racial stereotype. Williams appeared in the film adaptation of Steve Harvey&#x27;s book, &quot;Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man&quot;, titled &quot;Think Like a Man&quot; (2012), and its sequel, &quot;Think Like a Man Too&quot; (2014). In 2012, it was announced Williams would enter into a &quot;production alliance&quot; with producers Suzanne de Passe and Madison Jones to create movies and television shows aimed at multicultural audiences. These projects will appear under the heading &quot;Wendy Williams presents&quot; and their first project will be VH1 adaptation of a Star Jones novel.

In February 2013, it was announced that Williams and her husband and manager, Kevin, were launching a reality television production company, Wendy Williams Productions. that will produce unscripted content, including reality television and game shows. Williams was an executive producer on the show &quot;Celebrities Undercover&quot; (2014). Williams also executive produced a biographical film for Lifetime, &quot;&quot;, which premiered on November 15, 2014. The film attracted controversy due to its casting and depiction of Aaliyah&#x27;s relationship with R. Kelly. and received predominantly negative reviews from critics. In September 2015, the documentary series &quot;Death By Gossip with Wendy Williams&quot; premiered on the Investigation Discovery channel, both hosted and produced by Williams. In 2013, Williams was cast to play the role of Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton on the Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot;. She began her tenure on July 2 and finished her seven-week run on August 11, 2013. Her preparations for the musical were documented in the TV Guide docuseries &quot;Wendy Williams: How You Doin&#x27;, Broadway?!&quot;, which was produced by her own production company, Wendy Williams Productions.

Williams was accused of victim blaming singer Kesha in 2016 after questioning why she did not film the alleged sexual abuse by record producer Dr. Luke against her. Williams later apologized for the remarks and stated &quot;unfortunately a lot of people lie about rape so I was just being skeptical&quot;.

===2017–2021: Personal and professional issues, end of talk show===
Williams&#x27;s health issues caused her to take multiple hiatuses from hosting her show, including three weeks in 2018 and six weeks in 2019.

During this time, Williams received criticism for several remarks she made on her show. In January 2018, Williams was criticized by activist Tarana Burke after saying an alleged 14-year-old sexual assault victim of R. Kelly gave him consent and that she was tired of the #MeToo movement. Williams stood by her comments, saying &quot;I feel like I know things about R. Kelly that he&#x27;s told me himself that I promised I would keep in confidence.&quot; While talking about actor Joaquin Phoenix in January 2020, Williams used her finger to pull up a part of her lip to resemble a cleft palate, which Phoenix denies having. Although Williams said she found it attractive, critics claimed that it appeared as if she was mocking him. After a Change.org petition in favor of firing her garnered over 70,000 signatures, Williams apologized on Twitter and her show donated to cleft palate charities. The following month, Williams was criticized for making homophobic comments. While talking about the fictional holiday &quot;Galentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, she criticized gay men for wearing skirts and high heels and falsely assumed they aspire to be women. Williams later apologized for her remarks. While talking about the murder of Amie Harwick shortly thereafter, Williams made a joke referring to Harwick&#x27;s ex-fiancé Drew Carey and his job on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, saying that show&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;Come on down!&quot;, in response to news that Harwick was thrown to her death.

Williams hosted her show remotely from March to May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, after which she took a hiatus due to fatigue caused by Graves&#x27; disease. She returned to a studio broadcast in September of that year. The next month, Williams competed in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Lips&quot; where she was mostly sitting on something due to the weight of the costume and was eliminated after her first appearance.

In July 2021, Williams received criticism for her tone while covering the murder of 19-year-old TikTok star Swavy. After comparing their social media followers, Williams stated &quot;I have no idea who this is&quot; and casually informed her studio audience of his death. Williams did not return to her show after that month due to health issues; guests hosted in her absence. She tested positive for a breakthrough infection of COVID-19 in September 2021.
Production of &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; concluded in 2022 due to Williams&#x27;s ongoing health issues.

==== The Hunter Foundation ====
Williams and her ex-husband created The Hunter Foundation in 2014, a non-profit organization that funded anti-poverty programs and provided resources to people as they transitioned from drug addiction to recovery. During the Holiday season in 2016, the couple hosted dinners for over 1000 for those in need through the foundation. In 2017 the organization donated $1000 for the opening of an emergency food pantry. In 2018, the organization paid for a student&#x27;s college tuition. During March 2019, The Hunter Foundation launched a 24/7 national hotline 1-888-5HUNTER for those struggling with addiction. The Foundation was dissolved following Williams&#x27; divorce from Hunter in May 2019. Following the dissolution, Williams partnered with SNAX-Sational Brands and Operation Backpack with the objective to raise funds to provide backpacks filled with various school supplies for children in New York homeless and domestic violence shelters.

===Products and endorsements===
While working for WRKS, Williams was a spokesperson for a hip-hop clothing brand. In 2006, she became a spokesperson for George Veselles champagne and Alizé liqueurs. Williams debuted a jewelry and shoe line on shopping channel QVC called &quot;Adorn&quot; in 2012.

She suffered multiple miscarriages before giving birth to their son in August 2000. In April 2019, Williams filed for divorce due to irreconcilable differences after Hunter fathered a baby with a mistress. Although the divorce was finalized in January 2020, her legal surname remains Hunter.

===Health issues and guardianship===
Williams has been open about her cocaine addiction in the late 1980s and early 1990s, for which she never received treatment.

In late October 2017, Williams fainted during a live broadcast of her show from dehydration. Williams was often in the news for the next two years because of her health issues and relationship with Hunter. In February 2018, Williams disclosed that she has Graves&#x27; disease which causes hyperthyroidism, conditions she had been diagnosed with nearly two decades prior. Due to the increased pressure behind her eyes, they sometimes have a pronounced bulging appearance. Williams wears wigs in public because her thyroid condition thins her natural hair. She fractured her shoulder in December 2018. In March 2019, Williams said she had been living in a sober house &quot;for some time&quot; and that she has vertigo. Later that year, Williams revealed she had been diagnosed with lymphedema, a condition that causes swelling in her ankles.

Williams&#x27;s bank, Wells Fargo, froze her accounts in January 2022 and requested a New York Supreme Court hearing to determine whether she was in need of a guardianship due to her health conditions. She disputed the allegations and accused her former manager and a Wells Fargo financial advisor of impropriety. A judge appointed a temporary financial guardian, Sabrina Morrissey, in March, and they were confirmed in May. Williams entered a wellness facility to treat her health issues. She returned to public activity in November and prepared to launch a podcast, though she did not end up releasing it.

According to her representatives, Williams was diagnosed with aphasia and frontotemporal dementia in 2023 and entered a cognitive facility. A documentary chronicling Williams&#x27;s life since 2022, &quot;Where Is Wendy Williams?&quot;, aired on Lifetime in February 2024. Morrissey unsuccessfully sued to prevent its release, claiming the documentary exploited Williams. In November 2024, legal documents filed by Morrissey described Williams as &quot;cognitively impaired, permanently disabled and legally incapacitated.&quot; However, in January 2025, Williams said during her appearance on the radio show &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; that she was &quot;not cognitively impaired&quot;. She described her guardianship as &quot;emotional abuse&quot; and compared it to prison, citing the many restrictions placed on her, and called for broader reforms of the guardianship system, which she said is &quot;broken&quot;. Her niece Alex Finnie, who also appeared on the show, expressed support for her, saying that Williams &quot;sounds great&quot; and that her state &quot;does not match [that of] an incapacitated person&quot;. Finnie encouraged people who wish to support Williams to use the hashtag #FreeWendy or donate to a GoFundMe account she set up for Williams.

== Achievements ==
City University of New York professor Tanisha C. Ford credits Williams for creating the format by which other personalities conduct gossip segments of their own. The scholars ThedaMarie Gibbs Grey and Bonnie J. Williams-Farrier contend Williams is among the African American women who, through their television programs, popularized the term &quot;sipping tea&quot;. Williams&#x27;s voice is a popular sound on the social media service TikTok; her quote &quot;That&#x27;s what she said, and you know what? I— what was that? ...OK ...James&quot; is used in over 100,000 videos. Other phrases such as &quot;Oh she passed away?&quot; and mispronunciation of singer Dua Lipa&#x27;s name as &quot;Dula Peep&quot; became internet memes. YouTube users uploaded compilation videos of various Williams-isms to the platform, such as her misinterpreting the word &quot;corona&quot; as &quot;cornova&quot;.

Williams was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2009. On her 50th birthday in 2014, Asbury Park renamed the street on which she grew up Wendy Williams Way. She was honored with the 2,677th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on October 17, 2019. A wax figure of Williams is located at Madame Tussauds New York. In Washington, D.C., various artifacts related to Williams&#x27;s career such as a microphone, outfit, and wig used by her are located at a television exhibit in the National Museum of American History. A documentary, &quot;Wendy Williams: What a Mess!&quot;, and a TV movie, &quot;Wendy Williams: The Movie&quot;, are based on her life.

<doc id="1056202" wikidata="Q780568" url="?curid=1056202" title="French post offices in Egypt">
<text>The French post offices in Egypt were a system of post offices maintained by France in Egypt during the 19th century and the early years of the 20th century. They were primarily intended to facilitate commercial and trading interests that needed to communicate between France and points east.

The post offices were located at Alexandria, Cairo, Suez and Port Said.

Initially, in the pre-stamp period, letters were sent with appropriate postal markings to indicate payment and non-payment (letters traveling &quot;bearing&quot; in philatelic terms). In 1857, the regular postage stamps of France were distributed for use at the French Consular Post Offices in Egypt. Although letters could still be sent without postage affixed, in practice most letters were sent franked with stamps paying the required rate. The use of the generally issued stamps of France stopped in 1898 and in 1899, stamps were officially overprinted for the post offices at Alexandria and Port Said (the post offices at Suez and Cairo closed prior to this change). France issued postage stamps for each of the two remaining post offices, generally at the same time and with the same general characteristics, with the one overprinted or inscribed &quot;ALEXANDRIE&quot; and the other &quot;PORT-SAID&quot;.
The first issue appeared in 1899; it consisted of the post office name (as described above) overprinted on the current &quot;Type Sage&quot; stamps, a total of 15 values ranging from one centime to five francs. A shortage of the 25c values at Port Said necessitated surcharges on the 10c value, reading &quot;PORT SAID / VINGT / CINQ&quot;. A few of these were additional overprinted with &quot;25&quot; in red ink.

The first stamps inscribed for these post offices were the French designs of 1900 modified to include the post offices&#x27; names. The 15 values appeared in 1902 and 1903.

In 1921 the stamps were surcharged in Egyptian currency, at the rate of about 2.5 centimes per milieme. Several forms of the surcharge exist. In Alexandria, local surcharges read &quot;4 Mill.&quot; etc., while in Port Said they read &quot;4 / Milliemes&quot;, with the number in a sans-serif typeface. Soon after Paris-produced surcharges arrived in both offices; they read &quot;4 / MILLIEMES&quot; etc. A new round of surcharges in 1925 added black bars to obscure the French currency values.

In 1927 and 1928 the old designs were reprinted but with millieme values substituted, ranging from 3 m to 250 m.

<doc id="1056205" wikidata="Q1046879" url="?curid=1056205" title="Gold reserve">
<text>A gold reserve([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: سونے کے زخائر) is the gold held by a national central bank, intended mainly as a guarantee to redeem promises to pay depositors, note holders (e.g. paper money), or trading peers, during the eras of the gold standard, and also as a store of value, or to support the value of the national currency.

The World Gold Council estimates that all the gold ever mined, and that is accounted for, totalled 190,040 metric tons in 2019 but other independent estimates vary by as much as 20%. At a price of US reached on 16 August 2017, one metric ton of gold has a value of approximately $40.2 million. The total value of all gold ever mined, and that is accounted for, would exceed $7.5 trillion at that valuation and using WGC 2017 estimates.

==Wartime relevance==
During most of history, a nation&#x27;s gold reserves were considered its key financial asset and a major prize of war.

A typical view was expressed in a secret memorandum by the British Chief of the Imperial General Staff from October 1939, at the beginning of World War II. The British Military and the British Secret Service laid out &quot;measures to be taken in the event of an invasion of Holland and Belgium by Germany&quot; and presented them to the War Cabinet:

The Belgian government transferred remainder to southern France. Following the outbreak of war, the gold held in France was sent to Dakar, the capital of Senegal, then part of the French colonial empire. This was against the Belgian Government&#x27;s wishes, with the Belgians having directed the French to transfer it to the United States. After the Germans occupied Belgium and France in 1940, they demanded the Belgian gold reserve held in Senegal. In 1941, Vichy French officials arranged the transport of 4,944 boxes with 198 tonnes of gold to officials of the German Reichsbank and the German Government used it to purchase commodities and munitions from neutral countries. The Banque de France fully compensated the Belgian National Bank for the loss of its gold after the war.

==IMF holdings==
Since early 2011, the gold holdings of the IMF have been constant at 2,814.1 tonnes (90.5 million troy ounces).

==Officially reported holdings==

The IMF regularly maintains statistics of national assets as reported by various countries. This data is used by the World Gold Council to periodically rank and report the gold holdings of countries and official organizations.
On 17 July 2015, China announced that it increased its gold reserves by about 57 percent from 1,054 to 1,658 tonnes, while disclosing its official gold reserves for the first time in six years.

In July 2015, the State Bank of Vietnam stated that gold reserves totalled 10 tonnes. However, it was not ranked below due to the current absence of any published data.

In 2019, the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) extended the gold allocation limit from 5% to 10%, in accordance with the amendments made to the Investment Policy of the Fund for diversification purposes. However, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan does not hold any gold.
The gold listed for each of the countries in the table may not be physically stored in the country listed, as central banks generally have not allowed independent audits of their reserves. Gold leasing by central banks could place into doubt the reported gold holdings in the table below.

<doc id="1056206" wikidata="Q5030650" url="?curid=1056206" title="Canadian University Press">
<text>Canadian University Press is a non-profit co-operative and newswire service owned by more than 50 student newspapers at post-secondary schools in Canada. Founded in 1938, CUP is the oldest student newswire service in the world and the oldest national student organization in North America. Many successful Canadian journalists got their starts in CUP and its member papers. CUP began as a syndication services that facilitated transnational story-sharing. This newswire continued as a private function until 2010 when it was turned into a competitive source for campus news in the form of an online public wire at cupwire.ca.

CUP&#x27;s head office is in Toronto. Prior to April 1995, the head office was located in Ottawa. In Ottawa, CUP ran a printing company, called Common Printing Group, which was owned jointly with the National Union of Students, which was located in the same building as CUP for several years.

A national conference, which doubles as an annual general meeting, is held once a year in a different city. Each member paper exercises one vote at conferences. The president and national bureau chief are elected at the national conference, or NASH, while the regional CUPboard members are either elected via online referendum, or at regional conferences held in the spring. Each region has an annual event subsidy which can be used to host events within the region, or jointly with other regions. This usually takes the form of regional conferences held in the spring and in the fall. January 2011 will mark CUP&#x27;s first fully bilingual national conference, in Montreal, hosted in part by the McGill Daily and Le Delit.

The current structure for CUP, of a permanent newswire offered to Canadian University newspapers including the full-time president, was established at CUP 22 in Quebec City in 1959. Prior to this date the service was looser and more oriented towards an exchange of clippings between the papers. One of the delegates at CUP 22 was future Canadian Prime Minister, Joe Clark, representing the University of Alberta paper, The Gateway.

CUP is divided into six regions: WRCUP (Western, including British Columbia and Yukon), PNCUP (Prairies and Northern, including Alberta, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Saskatchewan), ORCUP (Ontario), CUPbeq (Quebec), ARCUP (Atlantic, including New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island), and PUC (Presse Universitaire Canadienne, including all French language members regardless of geography). Other acronyms for regions include CUPberta (Alberta), and CCUP (Central CUP, Saskatchewan and Manitoba). It also has four special issues caucuses to promote diversity, address the under-representation of marginalized groups and encourage discussion of social issues: Colour Caucus; Disabilities Caucus; Queer, Trans and Allies Caucus; and Women&#x27;s Caucus.

Member papers contribute articles to the CUP wire, which also runs stories authored by CUP staff. There are news, features, opinions, arts, sports, and graphics wires. After stories are edited by the national bureau chief, they are made available on the wire for publication in CUP member papers.

CUP formerly owned a multi-market ad placement agency, Canadian University Press Media Services Limited, which operates as Campus Plus, offering advertisers one-stop access to student newspapers. Campus Plus declared bankruptcy in 2013. Until 2007, CUP was the sole member of the John H. McDonald Journalism Foundation, a charity named after CUP&#x27;s first president. Though the charity has been folded, it lives on through the yearly John H. McDonald Student Journalism Awards.

In 2005, CUP declared the last full week of every January, Sunday to Saturday, would be observed as National Student Press Week to celebrate the achievements, diversity and freedom of the student press.

==National and regional staff==
Now and in recent years, the national bureau chief has also served as CUP&#x27;s vice-president. In some previous years, the national executive was made up of three or four staff and also included a national features editor (who also held the title of vice-president) or national affairs writer. These staffers held their positions at the conference listed and were elected at the previous conference. In CUP&#x27;s early days, the titles of president and secretary were awarded at a conference to a newspaper, which would then fill those roles from among staff members.

Currently, the national office staff consists of a single national executive, Jane Lytvynenko, who combines the functions of president and national bureau chief. Until the spring of 2014, the national office staff consisted of the president, who oversaw CUP&#x27;s finances and administration, and the national bureau chief, who managed its part-time editorial staff and curated the CUP wire service.

Part-time editorial staff consists of six regional bureau chiefs (British Columbia, Prairies and Northern, Ontario, Ottawa, Quebec and Atlantic) and at least four section editors (arts and features, opinions and humour, sports, and French). CUP also employs a communications manager, translator, two special issues coordinators (queer and anti-racism). In order to organize the national conference each year, CUP hires two conference coordinators and one awards coordinator.

==Board of directors==
Until the early 2000s, CUP was administered and controlled between national conferences by only the president and other national office staff. While the staff was required to execute the will of members are agreed upon at plenary, many major decisions could be made by the national office on its own. After the &quot;Agent&quot; Magazine problems, a movement spearheaded by staffers at the &quot;Ontarion&quot; drafted and approved a motion calling for the creation of a CUP Board of Directors. Approved at NASH 63, the board guarantees every region at least one director. Any region with 20 or more member papers receives an additional director. All directors are elected at the plenary of their spring regional conference.

At NASH 69 in Vancouver, CUP membership voted to add the position of a continuity representative to the board of directors as a voting member. Subsequently, at NASH 70 in Ottawa, this position was made into an ex-officio member of the board of directors. A staff member (President/NBC/Regional Director) from the previous year fills the position. It was created as an attempt to stabilize CUP&#x27;s leadership since it goes through an almost yearly changeover.

Currently, the board of directors consists of six regional directors (Western, Prairies, Quebec, Atlantic, and two Ontario directors), along with a national Francophone director, an industry advisor, and the continuity representative.

Subsequent changes have changed the governance landscape on the CUP board of directors. As of NASH78, the board of directors structure has been adjusted to a 12-member board, consisting of the following positions;
Additional changes voted in by the membership included removing all industry advisors from the board, and removing the president as a paid staff member, instead confirming the president as chair of the board. Relevant bylaw changes are being prepared by the board of directors for NASH79.

==Conferences==
Every year since its inception, CUP has held a national conference, also known as NASH. The conference moves around the country and serves as the annual general meeting of the organization. It also features a number of training seminars and high-profile keynote speakers. The New Year&#x27;s Eve parties were sometimes raucous events, as the new year was rung in five times to mark each of the nation&#x27;s time zones. The extinguishing of a motel fire put a damper on the party at North Bay, Ontario, on the last day of 1983.

NASH has also served as the platform for the John H. McDonald Awards for Excellence in Student Journalism, also known as the Johnnies, since 2003. Inspired by the National Newspaper Awards, the vision of the awards is to &quot;celebrate and reward the excellence that can be found in so many publications at universities and colleges across the country.&quot; Any student whose work has been published in a student publication may be nominated for an award. There are currently 21 award categories, which cover different types of reporting (such as news, arts, features, sports, opinions, and some of their French counterparts), art and photography, design, and a new category for Most Promising Student Journalist.

NASH78 was organized by CUP staff and held in Toronto, Ontario. At that conference, the Brunswickan (University of New Brunswick) successfully bid to host the next conference, NASH78, in Fredericton, New Brunswick. NASH79 is scheduled for 4–8 January 2017 with the theme &quot;START UP&quot;.

CUP also encourages member papers to host smaller regional conferences each year for the Western, Ontario, Prairie &amp; Northern, Quebec, and Atlantic regions. Regional conferences have recently been held in the Ontario and Atlantic regions as of 2016.

In 2022, The Concordian hosted NASH84, online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The theme for NASH84 was &quot;Evolve,&quot; and featured many multimedia and independent journalists to discuss the evolving modern landscape of journalism. The 2022 conference featured over 70 prominent journalists from across North America including Brian Stelter of CNN, Jesse Brown of CANADALAND, Anita Li of The Green Line, Jason Chiu of The New York Times (a former Graphics Bureau Chief for CUP), and many others.

==Partnerships==
In April 2013, CUP signed a three-year agreement with a new national advertising partner called FREE Media. The marketing group was co-founded as a division of the independent national advertising agency FREE by two CUP alumni, former Gateway business staffers Ashleigh Brown and Vikram Seth.

CUP&#x27;s previous national advertising representative was Campus Plus (officially Canadian University Press Media Services Ltd.) which was formed in 1980 and closed in June 2013 after declaring bankruptcy. Campus Plus&#x27; bankruptcy trustee MNP took charge of collections in the months that followed and issued payouts to member papers.

CUP is partnered with CWA Canada, a division of Communications Workers of America, a union which &quot;advances the economic interests of its members, improves their standard of living, and strives to guarantee equal job opportunities and human rights.&quot; CUP members may join CWA Canada as an associate member in order to join its mentorship program with professional journalists, attend training and networking courses and events, and seek opportunities for internships and freelance work. The CWA representative for CUP also helps members coordinate training opportunities at their publication.

CUP also has partnerships with Journalists for Human Rights, Marketwired, and ScribbleLive.

==Financial crisis of 2014==
In March 2014, CUP launched a 42-day fundraising campaign on the platform Indiegogo in an attempt to raise $50,000 toward its operating budget after finding itself in a financial crisis. Beginning 1 March, all 12 of CUP&#x27;s part-time staff members (including section editors and regional bureau chiefs) were laid off, and the president and national bureau chief received cuts to their salaries and benefits.

After an audit by the Canada Revenue Agency, CUP was forced to pay $9,000 for incorrect taxes. It was then discovered that the organization was projecting its third deficit in a row, this time for $7,000. With all of its savings now spent, CUP stated that &quot;with no reserves to draw on, it&#x27;s imperative for the existence of CUP to take action now.&quot;

The crisis comes not long after 10 members of CUP left in September 2013, resulting in a 15 per cent drop in total membership, due to complaints over high membership costs. CUP may also see further trouble as a number of those member publications have now formed a service called the National University Wire similar to and rivaling the CUP wire. The most recent CUP national conference in Edmonton, Alta. also attracted fewer than the expected number of delegates and therefore did not generate as much revenue as expected. Additionally, the demise of Campus Plus left CUP with fewer dividends to generate income. With all this having taken place in a relatively short period of time, CUP lost more than $70,000 in three years and ended up in financial and existential crisis with just more than $1,500 in the bank before the fundraising campaign.

==CUP National Bureau Chiefs and other National Office staff==
The national bureau chief also served as CUP&#x27;s vice-president. In some previous years, the national executive was made up of three or four staff and also included a national features editor (who also held the title of vice-president) or national affairs writer. These staffers held their positions at the conference listed and were elected at the previous conference. In CUP&#x27;s early days, the titles of president and secretary were awarded at a conference to a newspaper, which would then fill those roles from among staff members.

The NBC position ended in 2014.

<doc id="1056208" wikidata="Q662552" url="?curid=1056208" title="Jure Francetić">
<text>Jure Francetić (3 July 1912 – 27/28 December 1942) was a Croatian Ustaša Commissioner for the Bosnia and Herzegovina regions of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II, and commander of the 1st Ustaše Regiment of the Ustaše Militia, later known as the Black Legion. In both roles he was responsible for the massacre of Bosnian Serbs and Jews. A member of Ante Pavelić&#x27;s inner circle, he was considered by many Ustaše as a possible successor to Pavelić as Poglavnik (leader) of the NDH. He died of wounds inflicted when he was captured by Partisans near Slunj in the Kordun region when his aircraft crash-landed there in late December 1942.

==Early life prior to formation of NDH==
Francetić was born in Otočac in the mountainous Lika region of modern-day central Croatia on 3 July 1912. After high school where he was influenced by nationalist teachers, he went to study law at the University of Zagreb, where he joined the Ustaša movement and abandoned his studies. Soon after, he was exiled from Zagreb for five years as a result of his anti-Yugoslav political activities. He stayed in Otočac for a short time before emigrating to Italy in March 1933, where he took the Ustaša oath in the Borgotaro camp on 24 April 1933. He spent the next four years in Austria, Italy and Hungary. In Hungary he joined the Ustaša camp at Jankapuszta under the nom de guerre &quot;Laszlo&quot;, became deputy commander of the camp, and developed into a fanatical Ustaša.

After the assassination of King Alexander, Francetić was interned on Sardinia by Mussolini at the request of the Yugoslav government. After a general declaration of amnesty in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Francetić returned to Croatia in November 1937, but was immediately arrested and exiled to his hometown. The next year Francetić returned to Zagreb hoping to complete his study of law but was forced to complete his military service instead. His nationalist activities included greeting all the inhabitants of Otočac with the slogan &quot;Long live Ante Pavelić! Long live the Independent State of Croatia!&quot;. In late 1940 he was arrested in Zagreb due to a congratulatory telegraph to Dr Jozef Tiso, president of the newly formed Slovak Republic, signed by a number of Croat nationalists. He was again exiled to his native Otočac. After delivering an inflammatory nationalistic speech at a local school&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s celebration in Otočac on 12 January 1941, he escaped to Germany to avoid arrest.

==World War II==

===Commissioner for Bosnia and Herzegovina===
After the establishment of the NDH on 10 April 1941, Francetić was appointed as the chief Ustaša delegate in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the role of strengthening the Ustaša regime there. He arrived in Sarajevo on 24 April 1941 with Marshal Slavko Kvaternik, around 800 Ustaša militia, and 300 Ustaša police to establish formal control. Francetić effectively became the most powerful political leader in Sarajevo, and established a reputation for ruthlessness in dealing with Serbs and Jews. Francetić&#x27;s Ustashe took control over the local administration by dismissing all civil servants and teachers belonging to the category of &quot;Srbijanci&quot; (Serbs), as well as Jews. Killings, arrests, and deportation of Serbs and Jews was a regular duty of Francetić&#x27;s henchmen—based and justified by the official Ustashe policy which demanded the total extermination of Jews and the murder (1/3) and/or expulsion (1/3) and/or forced conversion to Roman Catholicism by Orthodox Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1/3). &quot;On 23 July 1941 the headquarters of the NDH Ustasha police sent an order to the heads of all regions, including Francetić, to begin with the arrest and transportation of Jews, Serbs and communists to the Gospić concentration camp.

In September 1942, Francetić was removed from his role as the chief government delegate in Bosnia, probably to address the concerns of the Muslims of Bosnia about the atrocities perpetrated by the Ustaše over the last eighteen months.

===Black Legion===
In August 1941, Ustaša militia under (then Major) Francetić&#x27;s command were deployed to eastern Herzegovina in order to counter the uprising there.

The 1st Ustaša Regiment () was raised by Francetić and Ante Vokić in Sarajevo in September 1941. When the original commander of the regiment was killed, Francetić took over command, and the regiment grew quickly and gained a reputation for fanaticism and violence. Raised for service in eastern Bosnia, by December it had been dubbed the Black Legion () after adopting a black uniform. It was feared for its fanatical morale and fighting qualities, but also for the atrocities it committed against the Bosnian Serb population. It soon grew to a strength of between 1000–1500 men.

In the winter of 1941–1942, the Black Legion carried out massacres in both Prijedor in the north-west of Bosnia and also in the Romanija mountains north-east of Sarajevo. In the latter massacres, they killed thousands of defenceless Bosnian Serb civilians and threw their bodies into the Drina river. Francetić was rumoured to have ordered the killing of more than 3000 of those massacred in these operations.

Francetić earned his only military education and officer rank while serving in the Royal Yugoslav Army. He became a non-commissioned officer in the rank of sergeant. Regarding Francetić&#x27;s military experience and knowledge, Eugen Dido Kvaternik wrote: &quot;He did not have basic military knowledge and military education, nor did he have any talent for basic military organization.&quot; After establishment of the Independent State of Croatia in April 1941 Francetić and 10 others organized the Black Legion. Francetić became the leader of the Black Legion and earned the rank of colonel in the Ustaša army. Kvaternik believed Francetić &quot;a born guerrilla and a son of our mountainous Herzegovina&quot;, which was sufficient reason to elevate him to military leader in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Commencing on 31 March 1942, and against German wishes, Francetić launched an independent offensive against the Partisans and Chetniks in eastern Bosnia. The Black Legion quickly captured Drinjača, Vlasenica, Bratunac and Srebrenica from the Partisans and defeated larger Chetnik forces led by Major Jezdimir Dangić.

Francetić also led the Black Legion during the joint German-Italian-Ustaša offensive Operation Trio in eastern Bosnia in April to June 1942, and according to the overall commander, General Bader, the Black Legion &quot;significantly aided the success of the joint offensive&quot;. In May, the Black Legion massacred about 890 Serbs and Jews from Vlasenica after raping women and girls.

As justification for the mass killing of Bosnian Serbs and Jews, Francetić cited &quot;the propaganda of &#x27;the Jewish communist hydra&#x27;&quot;, which had succeeded in &quot;misleading a majority of the Serb Orthodox population in eastern Bosnia into committing &#x27;criminal acts against the state.&#x27;&quot; Francetić stated that &quot;the most drastic means&quot; would have to be employed against them.

Francetić personally arrested and interrogated prominent Serbian and Jewish leaders, and ordered the murders of some of them. Francetić turned his own Sarajevo apartment into a prison kitchen/laundry room. The Ustashe&#x27;s savagery against Serbs and dissidents reportedly prompted the German command to demand that Francetić, as the commander of the 1st Brigade Black Legion, be dismissed. Pavelić refused, promoting Francetić to commander of all Ustashe field formations.

===Death===
Francetić died on either 27 or 28 December 1942, aged 30. While flying to Gospić on 22 December, his plane was downed by Yugoslav Partisans near the village of Močile, near Slunj, which was a Partisan-held area. Both he and his pilot were immediately captured by local villagers. Severely wounded, Francetić was taken to NOVJ General Staff Hospital where Partisan surgeons attempted to save his life in order to exchange him for inmates of Ustaše camps and prisons, but failed.
Ustashe authorities were so concerned about the effect of his death would have on supporters of their movement that the news of his death was delayed until the beginning of March 1943. Official announcement of his death came on March 31, 1943, and Ustashe declared eight days of official mourning.

==Legacy==

The Croatian Defence Forces () (HOS) was the military arm of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP) from 1991 to 1992 during the first stages of the Yugoslav wars. The 13th (Tomislavgrad) and 19th (Gospić) battalions of the HOS were given the title &#x27;Jure Francetić&#x27; in his memory. In May 1993, one of the formations of the Croatian Defence Council (, HVO) operating in the Zenica region of Bosnia and Herzegovina was called the &quot;Jure Francetić&quot; Brigade.

A memorial plaque to Francetić was raised in Slunj in June 2000 by the Association of War Veterans (&quot;Hrvatski domobran&quot;). Four years later, in late 2004, the Croatian government ordered the removal of the memorial plaque. In January 2005, in the outskirts of Split, another memorial to Francetić and Mile Budak was built by unknown persons.

<text>The French post offices in Zanzibar were post offices operated by France in Zanzibar from January 16, 1889, to July 31, 1904, when the United Kingdom took direct control of what had previously been a protectorate. 

The first issues prepared by France for use in Zanzibar were French stamps of the &quot;Type Sage&quot; design, overprinted with denominations expressed in annas (i.e. a sub-division of the Zanzibar rupee) across the top of the stamp. These began to appear in 1894. In 1896, France re-issued these stamps with an additional &quot;ZANZIBAR&quot; overprint across the bottom of the stamp. Many of the stamps of this design, especially those of 1897 created by printing on stamp margins, are very rare and expensive.

In 1902 French stamps of the &quot;Type Blanc&quot;, &quot;Type Mouchon&quot;, and &quot;Type Merson&quot; design were issued for use. These stamps incorporated the word &quot;Zanzibar&quot; as a part of the design, but still overprinted with denominations in annas. Stamps of this design were not regularly issued without the surcharge in annas.

<doc id="1056214" wikidata="Q2916545" url="?curid=1056214" title="Ljubo Miloš">
<text>Ljubomir &quot;Ljubo&quot; Miloš (25 February 1919 – 20 August 1948) was a Croatian public official who was a member of the Ustaše of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II. He served as commandant of the Jasenovac concentration camp on several occasions and was responsible for various atrocities committed there during the war. He was responsible for the deaths of thousands.

He fled Yugoslavia in May 1945 and sought refuge in Austria. In 1947, he returned to Yugoslavia with the intention of starting an anti-communist uprising. He was soon arrested by Yugoslav authorities and charged with war crimes. Miloš was found guilty on all counts and hanged in August 1948.

Ljubo Miloš has been described as an &quot;extremely sanguine fanatic and sadist. While Matkovic Ivica was a refined killer, Milos Ljubo was a brutal butcher.&quot; He is noted as being &quot;one of the worst Ustase murderers&quot;.

==Early life==
Miloš was born in Bosanski Šamac on 25 February 1919. Miloš attended primary school in Orašje and Bosanski Brod and finished secondary school in Subotica. He stayed in Subotica and worked as a municipal clerk.

==World War II==
On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. The country was then dismembered and the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić, who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, was appointed &quot;Poglavnik&quot; (leader) of an Ustaše-led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day Croatia, all of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern-day Serbia into an &quot;Italian-German quasi-protectorate&quot;. NDH authorities, led by the Ustaše militia, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb, Jewish and Romani population living within the borders of the new state.

Miloš arrived in Zagreb in June 1941 and met with his first cousin, Ustaše commander Vjekoslav Luburić. Luburić made him his right-hand man and used his influence to get Miloš a position within the Ustaše Supervisory Service (, UNS), which ran the Jasenovac concentration camp. In October, Miloš was named camp commander and promoted to the rank of First Lieutenant. Miloš was personally responsible for the safety of Croatian politician Vladko Maček during his imprisonment, from 15 October 1941 to 15 March 1942. Maček seeing Miloš, before going to bed, always made the sign of the cross, asked him if he &quot;feared God&#x27;s punishment&quot; for the atrocities he committed in the camp. Miloš replied, &quot;Say nothing to me. I know I will burn in hell for what I have done. But I will burn for Croatia.&quot;

Miloš was transferred to the Đakovo concentration camp in early 1942, but returned to Jasenovac and reassumed the position of camp commander in the spring. He seemed to compete with the other commanding officers in the camp to see who could torture and kill the most inmates. A witness reported that Miloš stabbed a man twice with a big knife due to the man hiding money. Another time Miloš took 25 prisoners from a line, grabbed a rifle and shot all of them. Miloš was often dressed in a white robe and pretended to be a doctor in front of sick inmates. He would sometimes take those applying to be hospitalized, line them up against a wall and slit their throats with a slaughtering knife. He seemed &quot;very proud&quot; of this &quot;ritual slaughter of the [Jews]...&quot;. Witness Milan Flumiani recalled:
[As] soon as the seventeen of us arrived at Jasenovac, Ustaše beat us with rifle butts and took us to the Brick Factory, where Ljubo Miloš had already lined up two groups, while we arrived as a special third group. Maričić asked Ljubo Miloš, &quot;who should I aim at first?&quot;, and Miloš replied, &quot;where there’s more of them&quot;, and both of them pointed automatic rifles at the 40 men from the first two groups and shot them all. After that, he asked the first man from our group why he came here, and when that man replied that he was guilty of being born a Serb, he shot him on the spot. Then he picked out Laufer, a lawyer from Zagreb, and asked him what he was, and when he replied, he called him out like this — &quot;I like lawyers very much, come closer&quot; — and killed him right away. Then he found out that a third man was a doctor from Zagreb, and he ordered him to examine the first two men and to establish whether they were dead. When the doctor confirmed that they were, he turned to the fourth man and when he found out that he too was a doctor, he &quot;forgave&quot; the whole group.

Miloš also raised a wolfhound and trained it to assault inmates. During the summer of 1942, he travelled to Italy to complete a law enforcement course in Turin, but returned to the NDH after only ten days. In September, he returned to Jasenovac and assumed the role of assistant-camp commander. Troops under Miloš&#x27;s command raided several villages near Jasenovac in October 1942, looted countless homes, arrested hundreds of Serb peasants and deported them to the camps. NDH authorities learned about the raids shortly after and arrested Miloš. He was not imprisoned long, as Luburić ordered his release on 23 December 1942. In January 1943, Miloš joined the Croatian Home Guard (&quot;Hrvatsko domobranstvo&quot;) and was stationed in Mostar. He returned to Zagreb in April 1943, where he remained until spring the following year. In September, he was named commander of Lepoglava prison.

A witness, Danon Jakob, reported about the killing of newly arrived victims on Christmas Day, stating that:

==Capture and death==

By the end of World War II, Miloš had attained the rank of Major. He fled Yugoslavia at the beginning of May 1945, and withdrew through Austria to Allied-controlled northern Italy with help from the Roman Catholic church. He soon returned to Austria and established links with Croatian émigrés there. He illegally crossed the Yugoslav–Hungarian border in 1947 with the intention of infiltrating Croatia with anti-communist guerrillas known as Crusaders (&quot;križari&quot;). Miloš was arrested by Yugoslav authorities on 20 July 1947, charged with war crimes and tried the following year. During his trial, he confessed to killing Jasenovac inmates and testified that the Ustaše had drawn up plans for the extermination of Serbs long before 1941. Miloš was found guilty on all counts on 20 August 1948 and sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of the People&#x27;s Republic of Croatia. He was hanged in Zagreb the same day.

<doc id="1056228" wikidata="Q5429608" url="?curid=1056228" title="Fahrenheit 9/11 controversies">
<text>The 2004 documentary film &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; generated controversy before, during, and after its release a few months prior to the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The film, directed by Michael Moore, criticizes the Bush administration&#x27;s attempt to pursue Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as well as the Iraq War. Although &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was generally praised by film critics and won various awards including that year&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or, the content was criticized by several commentators for accuracy, and lack of context. Additionally, the distributors protested Moore&#x27;s inaction on unauthorized copying.

==Ray Bradbury&#x27;s title dispute==
The title of the film refers to Ray Bradbury&#x27;s novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; and the September 11 attacks of 2001. The &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; reference is emphasized by the film&#x27;s tagline &quot;The temperature where freedom burns&quot; (compared with &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;″s tagline, &quot;The temperature at which books burn&quot;). Moore has stated that the title came from the subject of an e-mail he received from a fan shortly after September 11.

Bradbury was upset by what he considered the appropriation of his title, and wanted the film renamed. In response, Dan Gillmor wrote that titles cannot be copyrighted and that some of Bradbury&#x27;s own titles had been copied.

==Move America Forward&#x27;s letter-writing campaign==
The conservative political action group Move America Forward mounted a letter-writing campaign pressuring theater chains not to screen the film, which it compared to &quot;an al-Qaeda training video.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve been causing them [the cinemas] an enormous amount of aggravation&quot;, said group member and talk radio host Melanie Morgan.

== Citizens United&#x27;s FEC challenge ==
Citizens United, a conservative group run by David Bossie, filed a complaint before the Federal Election Commission charging that ads for the film constitute political advertising and thus may not be aired 60 days before an election or 30 days before a party convention. On August 5, the FEC unanimously dismissed the complaint finding no evidence that the movie&#x27;s ads had broken the law. A further complaint filed in 2005 was also rejected.

== Controversy over the film&#x27;s content ==
Shailagh Murray described &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as a &quot;harshly satirical and controversial portrait of the Bush presidency.&quot; Stephen Dalton of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the movie &quot;hits enough of its satirical targets to qualify as an important and timely film.&quot; Desson Thomson says &quot;there is more to &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; than partisan ridicule. ... What&#x27;s remarkable here isn&#x27;t Moore&#x27;s political animosity or ticklish wit. It&#x27;s the well-argued, heartfelt power of his persuasion.&quot; Author and blogger Andrew Sullivan expressed the opposite view, writing that Moore&#x27;s film is &quot;deeply corrosive of the possibility of real debate and reason in our culture.&quot; Canadian journalist Linda McQuaig wrote in response to Sullivan: &quot;Hell, the media shut down real debate long ago. It is precisely because the debate has been so thoroughly corroded by the mainstream media ... that Moore&#x27;s film is being so gratefully received by so many.&quot; Denis Hamill considers &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; to be a &quot;corrective to the daily drumbeat of right-wing talk radio.

English-American journalist and literary critic Christopher Hitchens and Democratic politician Ed Koch contended that &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; contains distortions and untruths and is propaganda. Hitchens also compared Michael Moore to Leni Riefenstahl in his critique for &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, saying &quot;Here we glimpse a possible fusion between the turgid routines of MoveOn.org and the filmic standards, if not exactly the filmic skills, of Sergei Eisenstein or Leni Riefenstahl.&quot; He later labeled Moore &quot;a completely promiscuous opportunist [and] extremely callous person.&quot;

Author and political commentator Peter Holding called Hitchens&#x27; analogy &quot;hysterical, unfair and offensive,&quot; adding that &quot;some of the criticism directed towards Moore&#x27;s film displays the very same characteristics for which Moore&#x27;s film has been criticised&quot;. Fellow &quot;Slate&quot; columnist and Iraq war critic David Edelstein, though generally supportive of the film, wrote &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; &quot;is an act of counterpropaganda that has a boorish, bullying force&quot;, but called it a &quot;legitimate abuse of power.&quot; Prominent French intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy agreed the war was &quot;a bad idea&quot;, but was sympathetic to the neoconservative point of view and disagreed with what he perceived to be the film&#x27;s &quot;core&quot; argument, that &quot;we have no reason to be interfering&quot; in the Middle East. Joe Scarborough alleged that Moore has ducked criticism and dodged interviews from both himself and Hitchens.

Moore has published both a list of facts and sources for &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; and a document establishing agreements between the points made in his film and the findings of the 9/11 Commission, an independent, bipartisan panel charged by Congress and U.S. president George W. Bush with investigating the facts and circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks.

=== Bush reading to school children ===
Early on in the film, Moore explains that Bush continued reading &quot;The Pet Goat&quot; with a classroom of second graders at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida for an extended period of time after being told of the attacks.

The school&#x27;s principal, Gwendolyn Tose-Rigell, explained, &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone could have handled it better. What would it have served if he had jumped out of his chair and ran out of the room?&quot; Some of the schoolchildren, now grown, have expressed similar views; Mariah Williams, one of the students, stated in 2011 that, &quot;I&#x27;m just glad he didn&#x27;t get up and leave because then I would have been more scared and confused.&quot;

A 9/11 Commission staff report, titled &quot;Improvising a Homeland Defense&quot;, said: &quot;The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.&quot;

According to senior White House correspondent Bill Sammon and his inside look at the Bush administration&#x27;s response to 9/11, &quot;Fighting Back: The War on Terrorism from Inside the White House&quot;, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer was holding up a legal pad upon which he had written a message telling Bush not to say anything yet.

=== Alleged discrepancy on bin Laden&#x27;s presumed innocence ===

According to Christopher Hitchens, Moore had argued in a previous public debate that Osama bin Laden was to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, and thus questions the treatment of bin Laden in the film. &quot;Something – I cannot guess what, since we knew as much then as we do now – has since apparently persuaded Moore that Osama Bin Laden is as guilty as hell. Indeed, Osama is suddenly so guilty and so all-powerful that any other discussion of any other topic is a dangerous &#x27;distraction&#x27; from the fight against him. I believe that I understand the convenience of this late conversion.&quot; Hitchens was subsequently invited to appear on Joe Scarborough&#x27;s MSNBC talk show, &quot;Scarborough Country&quot;, at which point a tape recording of his debate with Moore at the Telluride Film Festival in 2002 was replayed.

When the video ended, Hitchens proceeded to explain: &quot;Why does someone who thought that Osama was innocent and Afghanistan was no problem suddenly switch in this way? Because unless he says that he was dead wrong all along and Osama Laden was innocent and wronged, he can&#x27;t say that everything else is a distraction from the hunt for Osama.&quot; Host Joe Scarborough, a personal friend of Hitchens, agreed with Hitchens and criticised Moore for inconsistency, accusing him of &quot;hypocrisy&quot; for assuming bin Laden is innocent one minute &quot;and yet, in this movie, at the very beginning, he criticizes George Bush for not assuming the bin Laden family is somehow guilty, then letting them out of the country.&quot;

&quot;Flak&quot; magazine editor Stephen Himes, after watching &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; and reviewing a transcript of the Telluride debate, wrote that Hitchens had misconstrued Moore&#x27;s remarks: &quot;Hitchens actually performs some Clintonian semantic gymnastics here. Moore&#x27;s &quot;if&quot; is not intending &#x27;I think Osama is innocent and the Afghan war is unjustified;&#x27; he&#x27;s trying to make an argument for American due process: &#x27;If he and his group were the ones who did this, then they should be tracked down, captured and brought to justice&#x27;.&quot; Film critic Christopher Parry also took issue with Hitchens&#x27; interpretation of Moore&#x27;s remarks, writing &quot;If you&#x27;ve got to build a case against Jeffrey Dahmer, you&#x27;ve got to build a case against Bin Laden.&quot;

CNN news anchor Daryn Kagan asked Moore why, if he is so willing to uphold the law, he could also be critical of the Bush administration for pursuing Osama bin Laden at the same time. Moore replied:

=== Saudi flights ===
Moore implicates the White House in allowing relatives of Osama bin Laden to leave the United States without being interviewed at length by the FBI. In his narration in the movie, Moore states that &quot;At least six private jets and nearly two dozen commercial planes carried the Saudis and the Bin Ladens out of the U.S. after September 13.&quot; Moore based this statement on the research of Craig Unger, author of &quot;House of Bush, House of Saud&quot;, whom he interviewed for the film. Passenger lists can be found at the House of Bush website.

====Approval of the flights====

Christopher Hitchens points to a statement by former counterterrorism chief Richard A. Clarke, when interviewed by &quot;The Hill&quot; newspaper in May 2004, in which &quot;he, and he alone, took the responsibility for authorizing [the] Saudi departures.&quot; Hitchens says that Moore interviewed Clarke and &quot;either he didn&#x27;t ask Clarke, who authorized those flights, or Clarke told him it was me and only me, and he didn&#x27;t think it was good enough to use. ... Either way, that&#x27;s below the level of trash TV, trash journalism.&quot; After quitting his White House position, Clarke became a prominent critic of the Bush administration&#x27;s war on terrorism. Hitchens contends that the film does not mention Clarke&#x27;s remarks so that it can criticize Bush for not going after Bin Laden&#x27;s family, while holding up Clarke as a heroic, anti-war figure.

The filmmaker defended himself in an interview with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper, answering: &quot;Actually I do [display the] article and it&#x27;s blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke&#x27;s name right there saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It&#x27;s right there, right up on the screen. I don&#x27;t agree with Clarke on this point. Just because I think he&#x27;s good on a lot of things doesn&#x27;t mean I agree with him on everything.&quot;

Moore, on his website and in &quot;The Official Fahrenheit 9/11 Reader&quot;, points to additional statements by Richard Clarke, also published in &quot;The Hill&quot;, which he believes support his contention that the White House approved the flights. The following is a chronological summary:

* September 3, 2003: In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Terrorism, Clarke said: &quot;It is true that members of the bin Laden family were among those who left. We knew that at the time. I can&#x27;t say much more in open session, but it was a conscious decision with complete review at the highest levels of the State Department and the FBI and the White House.&quot;
* March 24, 2004: In testimony to the 9/11 Commission, Clarke indicated that the request was not abnormal, &quot;The Saudi embassy, therefore, asked for these people to be evacuated; the same sort of thing that we do all the time in similar crises, evacuating Americans. The request came to me and I refused to approve it.&quot; He goes on to explain that the FBI eventually approved the flights and he describes conversations in which the FBI has said that there was no one who left on those flights who the FBI now wants to interview.
* March 24, 2004: &quot;I would love to be able to tell you who did it, who brought this proposal to me, but I don&#x27;t know. The two – since you press me, the two possibilities that are most likely are either the Department of State or the White House Chief of Staff&#x27;s Office. But I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
* May 25, 2004: In an interview with &quot;The Hill&quot; newspaper, published the following day, Clarke said: &quot;I take responsibility for it. I don&#x27;t think it was a mistake, and I&#x27;d do it again.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;It didn&#x27;t get any higher than me... On 9–11, 9–12 and 9–13, many things didn&#x27;t get any higher than me. I decided it in consultation with the FBI.&quot;

====The FBI&#x27;s denial that it had a role in approving the flights====
On May 18, 2004, &quot;The Hill&quot; quoted FBI spokesman on counterterrorism John Iannarelli as denying that the FBI had any &quot;role in facilitating these flights one way or another.&quot; The FBI&#x27;s denial of involvement was repeated to &quot;The Hill&quot; by another spokesperson, Donna Spiser, in a May 26, 2004 article. She is quoted as saying &quot;We haven&#x27;t had anything to do with arranging and clearing the flights.&quot; She states that the FBI&#x27;s involvement was limited to interviewing those people on the flight it thought were of interest: &quot;We did know who was on the flights and interviewed anyone we thought we needed to.&quot;

====Alleged lack of cooperation from the White House====
The May 18 article in &quot;The Hill&quot;, which was published prior to Clarke&#x27;s May 25 claim of responsibility, quoted 9/11 Commission vice-chair Lee H. Hamilton as saying: &quot;We don&#x27;t know who authorized [the flights]. We&#x27;ve asked that question 50 times.&quot; A May 26 article in &quot;The Hill&quot; quoted another commission member, Tim Roemer, as being unconvinced by Clarke&#x27;s claim of sole responsibility for approving the flights: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t seem that Richard Clarke had enough information to clear it... I just don&#x27;t think that the questions are resolved, and we need to dig deeper... Clarke sure didn&#x27;t seem to say that he was the final decisionmaker. I believe we need to continue to look for some more answers.&quot;

Allegations concerning the Bush administration&#x27;s refusal to provide information to the 9/11 Commission about the Saudi flights are disputed. The May 18, 2004 article in &quot;The Hill&quot; says that commission vice-chairman Lee Hamilton &quot;disclosed the administration&#x27;s refusal to answer questions on the sensitive subject during a recent closed-door meeting with a group of Democratic senators, according to several Democratic sources.&quot; It also says that Republican commission member John Lehman &quot;said... that he told the senators the White House has been fully cooperative.&quot; President Bush, who met privately with the Saudi Arabian ambassador on the morning of Sept. 13, 2001, is suspected of personally authorizing the controversial flights while all other air travel had been halted.

====Interviewing of bin Laden relatives====
Moore interviews author Craig Unger and retired FBI agent Jack Cloonan, both of whom say bin Laden family members were not questioned in a serious manner at length before being allowed to leave. The 9/11 Commission has found that 22 of the 26 people on the &quot;bin Laden&quot; flight were interviewed before being allowed to leave the country with many being asked &quot;detailed questions&quot;. A September 2, 2004 CNN news article reported that &quot;However, in a recent interview with the AP, bin Laden&#x27;s estranged sister-in-law said she does not believe that family members have cut [Osama] off entirely. Carmen Binladin, who has changed the spelling of her name and lives in Switzerland, said bin Laden is not the only religious brother in the family, and she expects his sisters to support him as well. &#x27;They are very close to Osama,&#x27; she said.&quot;

====Declassified FBI documents====
In June 2007, Judicial Watch published partially declassified FBI documents on the flights obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request. Eric Lichtblau, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said the heavily redacted documents &quot;do not appear to contradict directly any of those central findings [of the Sept. 11 commission] but they raise some new questions about the episode.&quot; In several cases, &quot;Saudi travelers were not interviewed before departing the country, and F.B.I. officials sought to determine how what seemed to be lapses had occurred.&quot; Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said: &quot;The documents contain numerous errors and inconsistencies which prove the FBI conducted a slapdash investigation of the Saudi flights.&quot;

=== War in Iraq ===

The film suggests that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was an illegitimate attack on a sovereign nation, an unnecessary attack against an exaggerated threat. It makes a case against components of the Bush Doctrine; specifically, against the concepts of pre-emptive war combined with American unilateralism. The film also contends that the focus of the United States should have been directed elsewhere.

Christopher Hitchens criticized the film for not mentioning the history of repression, aggression, war crimes and the general state of human rights in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq, nor Iraq&#x27;s noncompliance with numerous United Nations resolutions. Hitchens wrote, &quot;in this peaceable kingdom, according to Moore&#x27;s flabbergasting choice of film shots, children are flying little kites, shoppers are smiling in the sunshine, and the gentle rhythms of life are undisturbed. Then—wham! From the night sky come the terror weapons of American imperialism. Watching the clips Moore uses, and recalling them well, I can recognize various Saddam palaces and military and police centers getting the treatment. But these sites are not identified as such. In fact, I don&#x27;t think Al Jazeera would, on a bad day, have transmitted anything so utterly propagandistic.&quot; While interviewing Hitchens on his show, Scarborough claimed to be outraged at Moore&#x27;s portrayal of the Iraqi insurgency, claiming Moore&#x27;s film suggests &quot;those killing Americans in Iraq aren&#x27;t the enemy, but rather they are the revolution and the Minutemen, who are sure to win their battle against the occupation&quot; and that &quot;Moore says that the enemy is George Bush and Saddam Hussein and Mr. Zarqawi and Mr. Bin Laden are no problem. ... Indeed, they are the Minutemen. They&#x27;re the staunch American revolutionaries.&quot;

Moore has frequently stated his opinion that Saddam was a brutal tyrant, though this opinion is not mentioned in the film. He said calling attention to Saddam&#x27;s crimes was unnecessary considering the corporate media had continually pressed that point themselves, making it public knowledge.
Christopher Hitchens criticizes Moore for stating, in his film, that Iraq had not killed or attacked an American: &quot;Moore asserts that Iraq under Saddam had never attacked or killed or even threatened (his words) any American. I never quite know whether Moore is as ignorant as he looks, or even if that would be humanly possible.&quot; Hitchens writes that Palestinian terrorists Muhammad Zaidan and Abu Nidal had been free to move in and out of Baghdad, and that Saddam&#x27;s armed forces had exchanged fire and killed American soldiers during the first Gulf War. When interviewed by Jake Tapper, Moore denied having said Hussein&#x27;s regime had not ever killed an American, insisting his movie had been misquoted: &quot;That isn&#x27;t what I said. Quote the movie directly. &quot;Murdered&quot;. The government of Iraq did not commit a premeditated murder on an American citizen.&quot; His narration is reproduced verbatim in &quot;The Official Fahrenheit Reader&quot;, including a chapter on critiques and supporting evidence.

====Children of members of Congress serving in Iraq====

Moore says that only one member of Congress had a child serving in Iraq: Army Staff Sergeant Brooks Johnson, the son of Senator Tim Johnson. According to Karen Kucher, when &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; was nearing release to the home-video market, two additional Congressmen&#x27;s children were stationed in Iraq: the son of Congressman Duncan L. Hunter, United States Marine Corps Lieutenant Duncan D. Hunter (who was later elected to Congress himself); and the son of Joe Wilson, Army National Guard Captain Alan Wilson.

&quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; also used footage of Moore confronting various members of Congress, encouraging them to enlist their own children to fight in Iraq. Moore approached Congressman Mark Kennedy and showed Kennedy giving Moore a quizzical, confused look. Kennedy expressed displeasure about his portrayal, saying he offered to help Moore and also indicated he had a nephew serving in Afghanistan, but this was edited out of the film.

====Raymond Plouhar====
Raymond Plouhar (May 26, 1976June 26, 2006) was a United States Marine Corps staff sergeant killed by a roadside bomb in Anbar Province, Iraq, during the Iraq War. His death raised media attention because he had been filmed in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. Plouhar was acting as a recruiter for the U.S. Marine Corps at the time he was filmed by Moore, whose film portrayed Plouhar attempting to enlist recruits in Moore&#x27;s hometown of Flint, Michigan. At the time, Plouhar was then taking time off from active duty in the wake of his having donated a kidney to an uncle. Plouhar&#x27;s father reported that his son willingly allowed himself to be filmed, and was unaware that Moore was making a film critical of the Iraq War. Other Marines filmed in the segment claimed they were deceived, saying they were not told that the filming was associated with Moore, or would be used to criticize their activities. They did not make explicit whether they had asked the purpose of the film; however, the Marines indicated that Moore&#x27;s crew represented themselves as a New York-based television production company, &quot;Westside Productions&quot;, interested in making a small documentary on high school career choices. A ten-year veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, Plouhar was an infantry unit leader assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division, I Marine Expeditionary Force out of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. He had been part of a unit engaged in projects to rebuild and revitalize schools in Iraq. He reportedly had 38 days left on his tour of duty at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife and two children.

=== Peter Damon lawsuit ===
Moore&#x27;s inclusion of a 10-second clip with amputee Peter Damon was criticized. Damon said the filmmaker &quot;should be ashamed of himself&quot; for claiming that soldiers were deceived into supporting the Iraq War and for using his injuries as reason to oppose the conflict. Damon &quot;agree[s] with the President 100%. A lot of the guys down at Walter Reed feel the same way.&quot; According to Damon&#x27;s doctor, Lt. Col. Chester Buckenmaier, Moore took &quot;a very positive thing we&#x27;re doing for soldiers&quot; who lost limbs and &quot;used it to tell a lie.&quot; Responding to the criticism, associate producer Joanne Doroshow said, &quot;Anybody who has seen the film knows we have nothing but the deepest respect for the soldiers who were wounded. One of the purposes of the movie was to examine the impossible situation they were put into and to raise questions about why they were sent there.&quot;

Peter Damon sued Moore in federal court for $85 million, alleging that the film gave a false impression and was defamatory. Moore&#x27;s attorney argued in response that the film quoted Damon verbatim and did not take his statements out of context nor give a false impression. The judge agreed and dismissed Damon&#x27;s suit. In March 2008, the First Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the ruling in Moore&#x27;s favor.

==Rebuttal documentaries==
Documentary films made in response to &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot; include: &quot;Celsius 41.11&quot; and &quot;Fahrenhype 9/11&quot; (narrated by Ron Silver).

==Unauthorized copying==
Unauthorized copying of the film was widespread. An early version taped at a cinema was distributed using the peer-to-peer file sharing protocol BitTorrent. The distributors expressed unhappiness and suggested potential legal action, but according to the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot;, Moore responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a problem with people downloading the movie and sharing it with people as long as they&#x27;re not trying to make a profit off of my labor&quot;. A &quot;mint copy&quot; of the film possibly appeared on the Lionsgate website itself, reported &quot;The Inquirer&quot;. Unlicensed screenings were also held in Cuba.

<text>John Langton (died 1337) was a chancellor of England and Bishop of Chichester.

==Life==
Langton was a clerk in the royal chancery, serving as the first Master of the Rolls from May 1286, and became chancellor in 1292. He obtained several ecclesiastical appointments (including as Vicar of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Horncastle), but owing to the resistance of Pope Boniface VIII he failed to secure the bishopric of Ely in 1298, although he was supported by King Edward I of England and visited Rome to attain his end. Resigning his office as chancellor in 1302, he was chosen Bishop of Chichester on 5 April 1305, consecrated bishop on 19 September 1305, and again became chancellor shortly after the accession of Edward II in 1307. Langton was one of the ordainers elected in 1310, and it was probably his connection with this body that led to his losing the office of chancellor about this time. He continued, however, to take part in public affairs, mediating between the king and Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster in 1318, and attempting to do so between Edward and his rebellious barons in 1321. He died on 19 July 1337. Langton built the chapterhouse at Chichester, and was a benefactor of the University of Oxford.

<text>Voices Carry is the first studio album by American new wave band &#x27;Til Tuesday, released in 1985.

&#x27;Til Tuesday&#x27;s debut single was the album&#x27;s title track, which went to #8 on the Billboard singles chart and remains the band&#x27;s best-known song. The &quot;Voices Carry&quot; video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist and was played heavily on MTV. The album&#x27;s second and third singles were &quot;Looking Over My Shoulder&quot; (which peaked at No. 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and &quot;Love in a Vacuum&quot;.

==Production==
Martin Rushent was considered for the role of producer for &quot;Voices Carry&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Voices Carry&quot; was released on April 20, 1985. The album entered the Billboard 200 at 152nd place on June 25. The album spent 31 weeks on the chart, peaking at 19.

==Reception==

&quot;Spin&quot; described the album as &quot;a pleasure, but not a revelation&quot; and that &quot;almost all the tunes are instantly catchy, if not especially inspired.&quot;
&quot;Spin&quot; praised the group&#x27;s vocalist stating that &quot;in lead singer Aimee Mann they may have a star. [...] she has her own look and a voice that&#x27;s evocative, thought not yet distinctive enough to stake out its own turf in the crowded field of female vocalists.&quot; Robert Christgau gave the album a B− rating, stating that the group rolls out &quot;synth-pop hooks like vintage A Flock of Seagulls, but Aimee Mann&#x27;s throaty warble sounds almost human. And while the generalization level of her aggressively banal lyrics signals product, not expression, every one lands square on a recognizable romantic cliché.&quot;

From retrospective reviews, AllMusic wrote that &quot;While most bands from Boston suffered from lack of production, Mike Thorne does a decent job on much of the album and excellent work on the title track.&quot; The review found that &quot;Love in a Vacuum&quot; was &quot;over-produced, creating a good album track when the true follow-up hit was actually in hand.&quot; The review went on to note haunting lyrics on &quot;I Could Get Used to This&quot; and &quot;No More Crying&quot; which &quot;separate this recording from work of similar &#x27;80s bands&quot;. The review concluded that &quot;this album and its follow-ups should have had as much commercial success as the Cars, because artistically, they are equal to that band&#x27;s dynamic debut.&quot;

==Legacy==
The popular Canadian teen drama &quot;&quot;, which is known for naming each episode after an ‘80s hit song or album, named a two-part episode after this album.

<text>William Greenfield (died 6 December 1315) served as both the Lord Chancellor of England and the Archbishop of York. He was also known as William of Greenfield.

==Early life==
Greenfield was born in the eponymous Lincolnshire hamlet of Greenfield. The date of his birth is now lost yet we know that he was related to a predecessor in the See, Archbishop Walter Giffard, who paid for the young Greenfield&#x27;s Oxford education in the year 1269. Giffard instructed that his bailiff at Churchdown (near Gloucester), &quot;...to pay to Roger the miller of Oxford twenty shillings, for our kinsman William of Greenfield while he is studying there, because it would be difficult for us to send the money to him on account of the perils of the ways&quot;. Greenfield next studied in Paris, where he became a doctor of both civil and canon law. Walter Giffard&#x27;s brother was Godfrey Gifford, the Bishop of Worcester.

Greenfield was the first of a number of Archbishops who ruled the northern English Archiepiscopal diocese as well as being significant statesmen during the fourteenth century.

Before being made Archbishop he was variously:
*Dean of Chichester,
*Rector of Stratford-upon-Avon
*Prebend of Ripon – where his stall was for a time sequestrated, on account of his non-residence – as at this time he was mainly occupied on affairs of state as a clerk and counsellor to Edward I
*Temporal Chancellor of Durham
*Chancellor of England (1302–1305). On 30 September 1302 Greenfield received the custody of the great seal as chancellor at St. Radegund&#x27;s Abbey (near Dover). During his absence in France, one Adam of Osgodby, then the Master of the Rolls, acted as his substitute.
*Employed in the service of the State by King Edward I from 1290 onwards.

==Archbishop of York==
Greenfield was elected by the Chapter of York on 4 December 1304; however there was delay in his consecration due to the death of Pope Benedict XI; when finally consecrated it was by Clement V at Lyons, on 30 January 1306. Greenfield was strongly commended to the pope and cardinals by the King, who told them of his &quot;...wisdom in council, industry, literary knowledge, and usefulness to the state&quot;.

Before his appointment Greenfield had lived for some time resident in Rome where the cost of his living and the procuring of the Papal assent were very heavy leaving Greenfield obliged to borrow money and to remark, &quot;All the money lenders were ecclesiastics. The Jews had disappeared some years before and the greater part of the treasure of the country was now stored away in the chests of some wealthy clerk or in the coffers of the monastery.&quot; He was forced to raise money to pay his debts from the company of the Bellardi of Lucca. In an attempt to free himself from the Italian money lenders he exacted aids from the clergy, and borrowed from many church dignitaries in the north of England.

As a result of the ongoing war with Scotland York became almost the de facto capital of England, with Parliament being held there in 1298, 1299 and 1300. The Courts of Justice were also moved to York and did not return to London for seven years.

When the attack on the Templars in England began in 1308 Greenfield was favourable to them and so refused to take any part in actions against them within the province of Canterbury; he was however present at the Great Council of Vienne in 1312, when Pope Clement V issued an edict dissolving the Order of the Templars.

Greenfield died at his palace of Cawood on 6 December 1315, and was buried in the eastern part of the north transept of York Minster, where his monument still remains. A gold ring with a ruby was taken from his finger when in 1735 his tomb was opened; these mementoes have been preserved by the Cathedral authorities.

<doc id="1056241" wikidata="Q266030" url="?curid=1056241" title="Julia Livia">
<text>Julia Livia (7 – 43 AD), was the daughter of Drusus Julius Caesar and Livilla, and granddaughter of the Roman Emperor Tiberius. She was also a first cousin of the emperor Caligula, and niece of the emperor Claudius.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Julia was born in the later years of the reign of her adoptive great-grandfather, Emperor Augustus, and was the daughter of Drusus Julius Caesar (a grandson of Augustus wife&#x27; Livia Drusilla through her son Tiberius) and Livilla (a granddaughter of Livia Drusilla through her son Nero Claudius Drusus, and a granddaughter of Mark Antony through his daughter Antonia Minor). At the time of Augustus&#x27; death in AD 14, Julia, who was in early childhood, fell ill. Before he died, the aged emperor had asked his wife Livia whether Julia had recovered.

===Marriages===
Upon the death of Augustus, Julia&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Tiberius, succeeded him as Rome&#x27;s second Emperor. It was during her grandfather&#x27;s rule, when she was around the age of 16, that Julia married her cousin Nero Caesar (the son of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder). The marriage appears to have been an unhappy one, and fell victim to the machinations of the notorious palace guardsman Sejanus, who exploited his intimacy with Julia&#x27;s mother Livilla to scheme against Germanicus’ family. In the words of Tacitus, 
: Whether the young prince spoke or held his tongue, silence and speech were alike criminal. Every night had its anxieties, for his sleepless hours, his dreams and sighs were all made known by his wife to her mother Livia &quot;[i.e. Livilla]&quot; and by Livia to Sejanus.

Later in 29, owing to the intrigues of Sejanus, and at the insistence of Tiberius, Nero and Agrippina were accused of treason. Nero was declared a public enemy by the Senate and taken away in chains in a closed litter. Nero was incarcerated on the island of Pontia (Ponza). The following year he was executed or driven to suicide. Cassius Dio records that Julia was now engaged to Sejanus, but this claim appears to be contradicted by Tacitus, whose authority is to be preferred. Sejanus was condemned and executed on Tiberius’ orders on 18 October 31. His lover, Julia&#x27;s mother Livilla, died around the same time (probably starved by her own mother: Julia&#x27;s grandmother Antonia, or committed suicide).

In 33, Julia married Gaius Rubellius Blandus, a man from an equestrian background. Despite that Blandus had been consul suffect in 18, the match was considered a disaster; Tacitus includes the event in a list of &quot;the many sorrows which saddened Rome&quot;, which otherwise consisted of deaths of different influential people. They had at least one child, Rubellius Plautus, Juvenal, in Satire VIII.39, suggests another son, also named Gaius Rubellius Blandus and an inscription implies Julia was probably the mother of Rubellius Drusus, a child who died before the age of three. Julia also had a daughter or step-daughter Rubellia Bassa who married a maternal uncle of the future Roman Emperor Nerva.

Around 43, an agent of the Roman Emperor Claudius&#x27; wife, Empress Valeria Messalina, had falsely charged Julia with incest and immorality. Messalina considered her and her son a threat to the throne. The Emperor, her uncle Claudius, without securing any defence for his niece, had her executed &#x27;by the sword&#x27; (&quot;Octavia&quot; 944–946: &quot;ferro... caesa est&quot;). She may have anticipated execution by taking her own life. Her distant relative Pomponia Graecina remained in mourning for 40 years in open defiance of the Emperor, yet was unpunished. Julia was executed around the same time as her first cousin Julia Livilla, the daughter of Germanicus and sister of the former Emperor Caligula.

==Cultural depictions==
In Robert Graves&#x27; novels &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and &quot;Claudius the God&quot; Julia was known as &quot;Helen the Glutton&quot;. Graves did this as comic relief in the novels, but in reality she did not have a reputation for gluttony.

In the 1976 television adaptation she was played by Karin Foley. It unhistorically has her mother attempting to poison her to prevent Sejanus from marrying her, but it is not explicit about whether she died as a result, so glossing over her fate under Claudius.

<doc id="1056243" wikidata="Q470694" url="?curid=1056243" title="Vjekoslav Luburić">
<text>Vjekoslav Luburić (6 March 1914 – 20 April 1969) was a Croatian Ustaše official who headed the system of concentration camps in the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during much of World War II. Luburić also personally oversaw and spearheaded the contemporaneous genocides of Serbs, Jews and Roma in the NDH.

Luburić joined Ante Pavelić&#x27;s Ustaše movement in 1931, left Yugoslavia the following year and relocated to Hungary. Following the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the establishment of the NDH with Pavelić at its head, Luburić returned to the Balkans. In late June 1941, Luburić was dispatched to the Lika region, where he oversaw a series of massacres of Serbs, which served as the &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Srb uprising. Around this time, he was appointed head of Bureau III, a department of the Ustaše Surveillance Service tasked with overseeing the NDH&#x27;s sprawling network of concentration camps. The largest of these was Jasenovac, where approximately 100,000 people were killed over the course of the war. In late 1942, Luburić was appointed commander of the Croatian Home Guard&#x27;s 9th Infantry Regiment but was stripped of his command after shooting and killing one of his subordinates. Under German pressure, he was placed under house arrest, but retained &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Ustaše concentration camps. In August 1944, he played a leading role in the disruption of the Lorković–Vokić plot, which sought to overthrow Pavelić and replace him with a pro-Allied government. In February 1945, Pavelić dispatched Luburić to Sarajevo, where over the next two months, he oversaw the torture and killing of hundreds of known and suspected communists. Luburić flew back to Zagreb in early April and was promoted to the rank of general.

The NDH collapsed in May 1945 and its territory was reintegrated into Yugoslavia. Luburić stayed behind to conduct a guerrilla warfare campaign against the communists, during which he was seriously wounded. In 1949, he emigrated to Spain and became active in Ustaše émigré circles. In 1955, Luburić broke with Pavelić over the latter&#x27;s professed support for a future division of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia, and formed a rival Croatian nationalist organization known as the Croatian National Resistance. The disagreement resulted in great acrimony between the two men and, when Pavelić died in 1959, Luburić was forbidden from attending his funeral. In April 1969, Luburić was found murdered in his home, a victim of either the Yugoslav secret police or rivals in the Croatian émigré community.

==Early life==
Vjekoslav Luburić was born into a Herzegovinian Croat family in the village of Humac, near Ljubuški, on 6 March 1914. He was the third child of Ljubomir Luburić, a bank clerk, and Marija Soldo, a homemaker. The couple had another son, Dragutin, and two daughters, Mira and Olga. Luburić was a devout and practising Roman Catholic. In December 1918, his father was shot by a police officer while smuggling tobacco and died of blood loss. Following his father&#x27;s death, Luburić came to &quot;detest and resent Serbs and the Serbian monarchy&quot;, the historian Cathie Carmichael writes. Shortly thereafter, Luburić&#x27;s sister Olga committed suicide by jumping into the Trebižat River after their mother forbade her from marrying a Muslim. Following the deaths of Luburić&#x27;s father and sister, his mother found work in a tobacco factory to provide for her remaining children. She soon married a man named Jozo Tambić, with whom she had three more children. Luburić&#x27;s half-siblings, born of his mother&#x27;s second marriage, were named Zora, Nada and Tomislav.

Luburić completed his primary education in Ljubuški, before relocating to Mostar to attend secondary school. There, he began associating with Croatian nationalist youths. He became increasingly aggressive towards his teachers and peers, and often truanted. Luburić’s first encounter with law enforcement occurred on 7 September 1929, when he was arrested for vagrancy and sentenced to two days’ imprisonment by a Mostar court. In his senior year, Luburić dropped out of high school to work in the Mostar public stock exchange. In 1931, he joined the Ustaše, a Croatian fascist and ultra-nationalist movement committed to the destruction of Yugoslavia and the establishment of Greater Croatia. The same year, he was arrested for the embezzlement of funds belonging to the exchange. On 5 December, Luburić was sentenced to five months in prison for embezzlement. Shortly thereafter, he escaped captivity and made it as far as the Albanian–Yugoslav border before being recaptured. Upon release, Luburić relocated to northern Croatia, and then to Subotica, where he surreptitiously crossed the Hungarian–Yugoslav border. Luburić first rendezvoused with the Croatian émigré community in Budapest before relocating to an Ustaše training camp called Janka-Puszta. Situated close to the Yugoslav frontier, Janka-Puszta was one of several Ustaše training camps established in Hungary and Italy, whose governments were sympathetic to the Ustaše cause and had territorial aspirations in Yugoslavia. It housed several hundred Croat émigrés, mostly manual labourers returning from Western Europe and North America. The recruits swore an oath of loyalty to the leader of the Ustaše, Ante Pavelić, took part in pseudo-military exercises, and produced anti-Serb propaganda material. It was at Janka-Puszta that Luburić earned the nickname Maks, which he was to use for the remainder of his life.

In October 1934, King Alexander of Yugoslavia was assassinated while on a diplomatic visit to Marseille, in a joint conspiracy between the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization and the Ustaše. Following the assassination, most of the Ustaše residing in Hungary were evicted by the country&#x27;s government, with the exception of Luburić and several others. For a short time, Luburić resided in Nagykanizsa, where, after a brief love affair, a local woman bore him a son.

==World War II==

===Creation of the NDH===

Following the 1938 &quot;Anschluss&quot; between Germany and Austria, Yugoslavia came to share its northwestern border with the Third Reich and fell under increasing pressure as its neighbours aligned themselves with the Axis powers. In April 1939, Italy opened a second frontier with Yugoslavia when it invaded and occupied neighbouring Albania. Following the outbreak of World War II, the Yugoslav government declared its neutrality. Between September and November 1940, Hungary and Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, aligning themselves with the Axis, and Italy invaded Greece. Yugoslavia was by then almost completely surrounded by the Axis powers and their satellites, and its neutral stance toward the war became strained. In late February 1941, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The following day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia. Intending to secure his southern flank for the impending attack on the Soviet Union, German dictator Adolf Hitler began placing heavy pressure on Yugoslavia to join the Axis. On 25 March 1941, after some delay, the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact. Two days later, a group of pro-Western, Serbian nationalist Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers deposed the country&#x27;s regent, Prince Paul, in a bloodless coup d&#x27;état. They placed his teenage nephew Peter on the throne and brought to power a &quot;government of national unity&quot; led by the head of the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, General Dušan Simović. The coup enraged Hitler, who immediately ordered the country&#x27;s invasion, which commenced on 6 April 1941.

On 10 April, the creation of the Independent State of Croatia (; NDH) was announced over the radio by Slavko Kvaternik, a former Austro-Hungarian Army officer who had been in contact with Croatian nationalists abroad. Pavelić arrived in Zagreb on 15 April and proclaimed himself leader () of the NDH, having assured the Germans that the NDH would be loyal to the Axis cause. Disenchanted with more than twenty years of Serb hegemony, the majority of Croats enthusiastically welcomed the NDH&#x27;s creation. The Axis invasion of Yugoslavia had transformed the Ustaše from a small and relatively obscure Croatian nationalist organization into a popular movement almost overnight. The Germans initially wanted to install Croatian Peasant Party leader Vladko Maček as the head of the Croatian puppet state, but Maček refused, citing his democratic convictions and his firm belief that the Axis powers would not win the war. The NDH was divided into German and Italian areas of influence. The Italian area of influence was divided into three operational zones. Zone I, which consisted of the coastal and island area surrounding the cities of Zadar, Šibenik, Trogir and Split, was directly annexed by Italy. Zone II was consigned to the NDH. It encompassed much of Dalmatia and the Dalmatian Hinterland. Zone III, also allotted to the NDH, extended as far as western and central Bosnia, a sliver of eastern Bosnia, and all of Herzegovina.

On 17 April, the Ustaše instituted the Legal Provision for the Defence of the People and State, a law legitimizing the establishment of concentration camps and the mass shooting of hostages across the NDH. The Jewish Question was only of secondary concern to the Ustaše. Their foremost goal was to rid the NDH of its 1.9 million Serbs, who made up about 30% of the fledgling puppet state&#x27;s total population. Senior Ustaše officials openly stated that they sought to kill one-third of Serbs living in the NDH, expel one-third and convert one-third to Roman Catholicism. The Ustaše movement&#x27;s grievances centred around the perceived injustices inflicted upon the Croats in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia during the interwar period. Senior Ustaše officials cited the shooting of five Croatian parliamentary deputies in June 1928, the murder of the Croatian nationalist anthropologist and historian Milan Šufflay in 1931, the suppression of the Velebit uprising in 1932, the murder of the Croatian Peasant Party vice-president Josip Predavec in 1933, and the arrest and incarceration of dozens of other Croatian political figures.

===Initial cleansing operations===

In early April 1941, Luburić had illegally crossed the Yugoslav border near the town of Gola. By mid-April, he arrived in Zagreb and was appointed to the Economic Bureau of the Main Ustaša Headquarters (; GUS), the Ustaše ruling body, serving as an adjutant to Vjekoslav Servatzy. On 6 May, Luburić was dispatched to the village of Veljun, near Slunj, to lead the round-up of 400 Serb males from the village in retaliation for the murder of a Croat family in neighbouring Blagaj the night before. Although the identity of the perpetrators remained a mystery, the Ustaše announced that the Serbs of Veljun were responsible and decided that the village&#x27;s male inhabitants were to be collectively punished. Luburić had a total of fifty men at his disposal, many of them longtime Ustaše who had lived in exile in Italy in the 1930s. On the evening of 9 May, the Serb males of Veljun were brought to Blagaj, and killed with knives and blunt objects in the backyard of a local elementary school. The murders lasted all night. The following morning, Luburić was seen emerging from the school covered in blood, washing his hands and sleeves by a water well.

In late June, Ustaše officials driving through the villages of Gornja Suvaja and Donja Suvaja, in the Lika region, reported being shot at, prompting the regional authorities to order a &quot;cleansing&quot; action against the villages. On the morning of 1 July, Luburić led a group of Ustaše into the two villages. The historian Max Bergholz writes that up to 300 Ustaše took part in the operation. According to the journalist and Holocaust survivor Slavko Goldstein, Luburić had about 150 members of the Ustaše Auxiliary Force at his disposal, in addition to 250 members of the Croatian Home Guard. Many of Gornja Suvaja and Donja Suvaja&#x27;s male inhabitants had fled into the wilderness before the Ustaše arrived. Their female relatives stayed behind and were subjected to rape and sexual mutilation. The massacre lasted about two hours; the Ustaše relied primarily on knives and clubs to kill their victims. At least 173 villagers were killed, mostly women, children and the elderly.

On 2 July, 130–150 Ustaše attacked the nearby village of Osredci. Most of the village&#x27;s inhabitants had fled in anticipation of a massacre, having heard of what happened in Gornja Suvaja and Donja Suvaja the day before. Over the course of the following two days, the Ustaše massacred about thirty of the village&#x27;s inhabitants, mostly the elderly and infirm, who had been unable to flee along with the others. Concurrently, Luburić and his followers massacred the inhabitants of the nearby village of Bubanj. According to their own internal documents, the Ustaše killed 152 Serb civilians in Bubanj and burned down twenty homes. In some households, not a single person was left alive. Survivor accounts suggest that the number of fatalities was about 270. On 3 July, one of Luburić&#x27;s units detained 53 inhabitants of the village of Nebljusi, including ten children under the age of 12. They were transported by horse-drawn cart to the nearby village of Boričevac, which contained a barracks and a karst pit. The residents of Nebljusi were detained inside the barracks until nightfall, alongside twelve adult males who had been arrested earlier. That evening, they were marched to the karst pit in groups of eight and pushed inside to their deaths. Two of the victims managed to survive the ordeal. By the end of July, the Ustaše had killed at least 1,800 Serbs in and around Lika.

The Ustaše atrocities against the NDH&#x27;s Serb population prompted thousands of Serbs to join Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Partisans and Draža Mihailović&#x27;s Chetniks. The Lika massacres in particular served as the &quot;casus belli&quot; for the Srb uprising, which commenced on 27 July. The revolt led to the Italian military occupations of Zone II and Zone III. &quot;Luburić and his superiors had wrongly calculated that the brutal killings of an innocent population would quash any embryonic resistance to their plan for the creation of an &#x27;ethnically pure area&#x27;,&quot; Goldstein remarked. &quot;Their actions ... provoked the completely opposite effect.&quot; In mid-July 1941, Luburić was tasked with recapturing dozens of inmates who had escaped from the Kerestinec camp. Almost all the fugitives were captured or killed, and several Ustaše also lost their lives.

===Ustaše Surveillance Service, Bureau III===
====Jasenovac, I–III====

The NDH&#x27;s security sector was made up of two agencies, the Directorate for Security and Public Order (; RAVSIGUR) and the Ustaše Surveillance Service (; UNS). Both the RAVSIGUR and the UNS were led by Kvaternik&#x27;s son, Dido. The RAVSIGUR was established on 4 May 1941. The UNS was established in August. The latter was divided into three bureaus: Bureau I, Bureau III and Bureau IV. Bureau III, also known as the Ustaše Defense, was tasked with administering the NDH&#x27;s concentration camps. There were about 30 in total stretching across the NDH. From April to August 1941, the RAVSIGUR was responsible for the camps&#x27; administration. For much of the war, Bureau III was headed by Luburić. According to Siegfried Kasche, the German ambassador to the NDH, Luburić had envisaged creating a network of concentration camps during his time in exile.

In May 1941, Kvaternik had ordered the construction of two detention centres in the villages of Krapje (Jasenovac I) and Bročice (Jasenovac II), the first two sub-camps of what was to become the Jasenovac concentration camp. Krapje and Bročice opened on 23 August. The same day, faced with the Italian military occupation of Zone II, Bureau III ordered the dissolution of all concentration camps situated in the NDH&#x27;s coastal areas. In the first months of the Jasenovac concentration camp system&#x27;s operation, Luburić rarely ordered mass executions without the consent of his superiors. Ante Moškov, a leading Ustaše official, remarked: &quot;He was more fond of the &quot;Poglavnik&quot; than he was even of his own mother and brothers, and loyalty and obedience to him was the meaning of his life.&quot; Luburić&#x27;s loyalty and dedication eventually paid off, and as the war progressed, he became a trusted member of Pavelić&#x27;s inner circle. In late September 1941, the government of the NDH dispatched Luburić to the Third Reich to study German methods of creating and maintaining concentration camps. Luburić&#x27;s tour of the camps lasted ten days. Subsequent Ustaše camps were modelled on Oranienburg and Sachsenhausen. The Jasenovac camp system was situated in a heavily Serb-populated area. On Luburić&#x27;s orders, between September and October 1941, all Serb villages in the vicinity of the two sub-camps were razed, their inhabitants rounded up and deported to Krapje and Bročice. Between 14 and 16 November 1941, Krapje and Bročice were dissolved. Able-bodied prisoners were forced to construct a third sub-camp, Jasenovac III, which came to be known as the Brickyard (). The sick and infirm were either killed or left to die in the abandoned campgrounds. Of the 3,000–4,000 prisoners detained in Krapje and Bročice at the time of their dissolution, only 1,500 lived to see the Brickyard.

====Jasenovac, IV–V====

Armed with the information he had gathered in Germany, Luburić was able to organize the Brickyard more efficiently than Krapje and Bročice had been. In January 1942, Bureau III ordered the establishment of Jasenovac IV, a sub-camp dedicated to leather production, which became known as the Tannery (). A fifth and final sub-camp, Jasenovac V, was established around the same time. Known as Stara Gradiška, after the village in which it was located, it was overseen by both male and female guards. Among them were Luburić&#x27;s half-sisters, Nada and Zora. The former participated extensively in the tortures and executions that took place at Stara Gradiška. She went on to marry Dinko Šakić. During the war, Šakić served as the deputy commander of Stara Gradiška, and later, as the commander of the Brickyard. Luburić also recruited his cousin Ljubo Miloš. Miloš served as the labour service commandant at the Brickyard. Like Luburić, who was in his late twenties when he was appointed head of Bureau III, most of the Ustaše tasked with administering the Jasenovac camp system were extremely young. Šakić was 20 in 1941 and Miloš was 22.

The Jasenovac camp system was guarded by more than 1,500 Ustaše. The Brickyard, the Tannery and Stara Gradiška were capable of holding 7,000 inmates, although the number of inmates never exceeded 4,000 at any given time. Luburić visited the Jasenovac camp system two or three times per month. He insisted on personally killing at least one inmate on each of his visits. Luburić enjoyed taunting prisoners as to the date and method of their execution. He would &quot;amuse himself by placing his revolver up against the heads of the prisoners,&quot; the Tito biographer Jasper Godwin Ridley writes. &quot;Sometimes he pulled the trigger; sometimes he did not.&quot; Luburić&#x27;s cruelty also extended to the other Ustaše camps. In one instance, he deliberately dispatched hundreds of typhus-ridden inmates from Stara Gradiška to Đakovo so as to expedite the spread of the disease among its prisoners. &quot;Luburić created such an atmosphere,&quot; Miloš recalled, &quot;that every Ustaša actually felt himself called upon to kill a prisoner, believing that this would be an act of patriotism.&quot; After unsuccessfully experimenting with gas vans, Luburić ordered that a gas chamber be constructed at Stara Gradiška, which used a combination of sulfur dioxide and Zyklon B. The gas chamber was poorly constructed and this method of killing was abandoned after three months. Over the course of the war, unlike in the German camps, most inmates were killed with knives or blunt objects.

In early 1942, conditions at Jasenovac improved somewhat in anticipation of a visit by a Red Cross delegation. Healthier inmates, who were provided with new beds and bedclothes, were allowed to speak to the delegation, while sick and emaciated ones were killed. After the delegation left, camp conditions reverted to their prior state. Whenever he was pressed for information by the families of those detained at Jasenovac, Luburić remained equivocal. When a Croatian Jewish civil servant named Dragutin Rosenberg attempted to persuade him to allow food and clothing to be delivered to Jasenovac on a name-by-name basis, Luburić only agreed to bulk consignments, so as not to reveal which detainees were still alive. Luburić also proved impervious to bribes, as exemplified by the case of Julius Schmidlin, a Red Cross representative, who attempted to bribe Luburić into treating the inmates at Jasenovac more humanely but was angrily rebuffed. In addition, Luburić did not tolerate the mishandling of goods seized from camp inmates, as exemplified by his response to the so-called Gold Affair, in which camp guards were caught attempting to smuggle confiscated jewellery out of Jasenovac. Luburić ordered that the culprits be killed. Among those killed was the brother of Luburić&#x27;s deputy Ivica Matković, who was beaten to death.

===Kozara Offensive===

On 21 December 1941, Ustaše units under the command of Luburić, Rukavina and Moškov marched into Prkosi, near Bosanski Petrovac. Luburić declared: &quot;We have to kill everyone, in Prkos [&quot;sic&quot;] and in all of their villages, to the last man, even children.&quot; The Ustaše proceeded to round up more than 400 Serb civilians, mostly women, children and the elderly. Shortly thereafter, they were led to a nearby forest and killed. On 14 January 1942, Luburić led a group of Ustaše into the village of Draksenić, in northern Bosnia, and ordered the killing of its inhabitants. More than 200 villagers were killed in the ensuing massacre, mostly women, children and the elderly. In mid-1942, the State Intelligence and Propaganda Bureau (; DIPU) issued a stern warning to all newspapers in the NDH, forbidding them from reporting on Luburić, Bureau III and the NDH&#x27;s so-called &quot;collection centers&quot;. Despite the DIPU&#x27;s warning, Luburić was featured in a 1942 propaganda short film titled &quot;Guard on the Drina&quot; (, ).

In June 1942, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, Home Guard and Ustaše Militia launched the Kozara Offensive, aimed at dislodging Partisan formations around Mount Kozara, in northwestern Bosnia, which threatened Germany&#x27;s access to the Belgrade–Zagreb railway line. Although the Partisans did suffer a humiliating defeat, the area&#x27;s civilian population bore the brunt of the offensive. Between 10 June and 30 July 1942, 60,000 civilians living in the vicinity of Mount Kozara, mostly Serbs, were rounded up and taken to concentration camps. &quot;Kozara was cleared to the last man,&quot; &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; Plenipotentiary General Edmund Glaise-Horstenau wrote, &quot;and likewise, the last woman and last child.&quot;

Following Kozara&#x27;s depopulation, Luburić envisaged creating an annual &quot;tax&quot;, whereby Serb boys would be taken from their families, conditioned to renounce their Serb national identity, and inducted into the Ustaše fold. In late 1942, he &quot;adopted&quot; 450 boys who had been displaced during the fighting around Mount Kozara. Dressed in black Ustaše robes, Luburić dubbed the boys his &quot;little janissaries&quot;, an allusion to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s &quot;devşirme&quot; system, which saw tens of thousands of boys taken from Christian families across the Balkans and inducted into the Ottoman military. Each morning, Luburić&#x27;s &quot;janissaries&quot; were forced to take part in military drills and say the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. The experiment failed and the majority of the boys refused to become Ustaše. Most subsequently died of malnutrition, dysentery and other diseases. Hundreds of other children abducted by the Ustaše in the aftermath of the Kozara Offensive were saved by a group of Red Cross volunteers from Zagreb, led by Diana Budisavljević. In her diary, Budisavljević recalled an encounter she had with Luburić at Stara Gradiška, in which the latter chastised her and her colleagues for &quot;caring only about Serb children&quot;, while there were Croat and Bosnian Muslim children across the NDH who were suffering as well. According to Budisavljević, Luburić threatened to have her and her colleagues detained, ominously warning that, &quot;no one would know what had happened to them or their whereabouts.&quot;

===House arrest and disruption of the Lorković–Vokić plot===
In August 1942, Luburić was promoted to the rank of &quot;Bojnik&quot; (Major). Glaise-Horstenau complained to Pavelić that Luburić was interfering with German operations. The Germans distrusted Luburić, with one of their internal memorandums describing him as &quot;a neurotic, pathological personality&quot;. Seeking to appease the Germans, Pavelić reassigned Luburić to Travnik. He appointed him commander of the Croatian Home Guard&#x27;s 9th Infantry Regiment (), whose purpose would be to secure the NDH&#x27;s border with Italian-occupied Montenegro in East Herzegovina, which had a heavy Chetnik presence.

As the 9th Infantry Regiment was preparing to leave for Herzegovina, Luburić shot and killed one of the Home Guards under his command. The killing sparked an outcry among the Home Guards. Luburić was immediately stripped of his command, which went to Colonel Franjo Šimić. In late November, at the urging of the Germans, Luburić was placed under house arrest, which he spent in a Zagreb apartment together with his mother and half-sisters. Stanko Šarc was appointed to oversee operations at Jasenovac in Luburić&#x27;s absence. Luburić&#x27;s deputy Ivica Matković was replaced by Ivica Brkljačić. The terms of Luburić&#x27;s house arrest were very lenient and he was allowed to leave his apartment for strolls. Luburić exercised &quot;de facto&quot; control over the operations at Jasenovac, despite his officially having been replaced. For example, in late 1942, he arranged for the release of Miroslav Filipović, who had been jailed for committing a series of atrocities against the Serb population of northern Bosnia. Filipović was subsequently appointed commander of Stara Gradiška. For a period of two months, Maček and his wife lived alongside Luburić and his family. According to Maček, Luburić&#x27;s mother tearfully told Maček&#x27;s wife that she would regret having given birth to Luburić if her son had been responsible for the atrocities that he was rumoured to have committed.

By late 1942, the growing unrest in the NDH was beginning to harm German interests in Southeast Europe. The Germans began placing pressure on Pavelić to bring stability to the NDH. To this end, they encouraged him to halt the Ustaše atrocities against the Serbs. In response, the Ustaše established the so-called Croatian Orthodox Church, whose purpose was to assimilate the NDH&#x27;s Serb population, designating them as &quot;Croats of the Orthodox faith&quot;. Pavelić singled out Slavko and Dido Kvaternik as scapegoats for all the NDH&#x27;s troubles. He blamed the former for the Home Guard and Ustaše Militia&#x27;s inability to bring the Partisans and Chetniks to heel, and the latter for the massacres of Serbs, even though the atrocities had been committed with Pavelić&#x27;s knowledge. In October 1942, the father-and-son duo were exiled to Slovakia. On 21 January 1943, the UNS was dissolved and amalgamated into the Main Directorate for Security and Public Order (; GRAVSIGUR), which had been established to replace the RAVSIGUR earlier that month. The GRAVSIGUR then assumed responsibility for the administration of the NDH&#x27;s concentration camps.

Still officially under house arrest, Luburić relocated to the village of Šumec, near Lepoglava, in mid-1943. Around this time, he also began planning guerrilla operations against the Partisans with Gestapo officer Kurt Koppel in the event of Germany&#x27;s defeat. The number of Partisans in the NDH continued to grow, from a mere 7,000 in 1941, to 25,000 in 1942, and 100,000 in late 1943. On 8 September 1943, the Italians capitulated to the Allies. Countless Italian units surrendered to the Partisans, who disarmed them and thus acquired a significant amount of modern weaponry. Luburić remained sidelined for much of 1944, but his fortunes changed after the Lorković–Vokić plot came to light in August 1944. On 30 August, Luburić personally oversaw the arrests of government ministers Mladen Lorković and Ante Vokić. Lorković, the Minister of Internal Affairs, and Vokić, the Minister of Defense, were accused of conspiring to overthrow Pavelić and install a pro-Allied government. Following their arrests, Luburić was tasked with interrogating Lorković and Vokić, as well as other suspected conspirators. That October, Luburić was promoted to the rank of &quot;Pukovnik&quot; (Colonel). In December 1944, the Croatian Home Guard and the Ustaše Militia were unified to create the Croatian Armed Forces. On 7 December, Luburić forced more than thirty members of the collaborationist Serbian Volunteer Corps off a train passing through Zagreb&#x27;s main railway station and ordered that they be shot. Destined for Slovenia, they had received Pavelić&#x27;s approval to pass through Zagreb unmolested, but Luburić showed no regard.

===Terror in Sarajevo===

In early 1945, Pavelić dispatched Luburić to Sarajevo to undermine the communist underground there. Luburić arrived in the city on 15 February. Five days later, Hitler declared Sarajevo a &quot;Festung&quot; (or &quot;fortress&quot;), insisting that it be defended at all costs. Hitler appointed General Heinz Kathner to organize the city&#x27;s defences in anticipation of a Partisan attack. On 24 February, Kathner organized a banquet in Luburić&#x27;s honour. At the banquet, Luburić announced his intention to destroy the communist resistance in Sarajevo. Luburić soon appointed nine Ustaše officers to a special task force for carrying out executions of known and suspected communists. His headquarters was located inside a villa in downtown Sarajevo, which came to be known as the &quot;house of terror&quot; among the city&#x27;s residents.

On 1 March, the Partisans launched Operation Sarajevo, which aimed to wrest the city from the Germans and the Ustaše. By early March, Sarajevo had been encircled and cut off from the rest of the NDH. Luburić established a kangaroo court that he dubbed the Criminal War Court of Commander Luburić, which dealt with cases of alleged treason. The court also dealt with more gratuitous charges such as price fixing. The first batch of prisoners to be tried was a group of 17 Muslim refugees from Mostar. Over the course of the month, dozens of suspected communists were executed. The arrests and subsequent executions were of an alarmingly arbitrary nature, which only served to exacerbate the terror felt by Sarajevans. According to survivors, the torture method most commonly used by Luburić&#x27;s agents involved tying prisoners&#x27; hands behind their backs, pulling their hands between their legs, placing a rod between their knees, hanging them upside down and then beating them. These torture sessions, which the Ustaše euphemistically referred to as interrogations, were usually followed by the prisoner&#x27;s execution or deportation to a concentration camp. Luburić is said to have revelled in inviting the family members of his victims to the villa and then describing in great detail how their loved ones had been tortured and killed. As the killings progressed, some Sarajevans took to bomb shelters in fear for their lives, though the city had not been bombed in weeks.

On 16 March, Luburić convened a meeting of over 1,000 Ustaše political and military figures, and in the presence of senior German officials, issued a declaration denouncing Bolshevism, the Yalta Conference, and the new communist government in Belgrade. On 21 March, the Ustaše uncovered a plot to assassinate Luburić. His would-be assassin was a communist youth named Halid Nazečić, who was betrayed by one of his accomplices. Four Ustaše were subsequently killed in Partisan attacks within the city. On the night of 27–28 March, the Ustaše hanged fifty-five Sarajevans from trees and street lamps in Sarajevo&#x27;s Marindvor neighbourhood. Signs bearing the phrase, &quot;Long live the &quot;Poglavnik&quot;!&quot; were placed around their necks. Their bodies were left to hang as an example to others. Those attempting to retrieve the bodies were fired upon. On 4 April, Luburić and his entourage left Sarajevo. About 350 Ustaše policemen and 400 Ustaše soldiers stayed behind to defend the city. Luburić&#x27;s reign of terror in Sarajevo claimed 323 lives, according to a post-war war crimes commission. Several hundred others were deported to concentration camps. The Partisans entered Sarajevo on 6 April and proclaimed its liberation. The city&#x27;s capture coincided with the fourth anniversary of the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The exhumation of bodies from the backyard of Luburić&#x27;s villa, many of which belonged to children, was documented by a Soviet film crew. Another witness to the aftermath of Luburić&#x27;s crimes was the American journalist Landrum Bolling, who recalled seeing a roomful of bodies &quot;stacked like cordwood on top of one another.&quot; Many of the cadavers showed signs of torture and mutilation. Among the corpses was that of Halid Nazečić, whose head had been mutilated, eyes gouged out and genitals burned with boiling water.

===Destruction of the NDH===
Upon leaving Sarajevo, Luburić boarded a plane for Zagreb. While attempting to land at the Borongaj airfield, Luburić&#x27;s plane crashed on a bomb-damaged runway. Luburić sustained a head injury and had to be hospitalized. Pavelić visited Luburić while he was convalescing and found his subordinate jaded and disillusioned, accusing the Germans of betraying Croatia. Shortly thereafter, Luburić was promoted to the rank of General. In early April, he ordered that Jasenovac&#x27;s remaining prisoners be killed. He also ordered that documents pertaining to the camp&#x27;s operation be destroyed, and the corpses from surrounding mass graves exhumed and cremated. Several individuals who possessed incriminating information pertaining to Luburić&#x27;s wartime activities, such as the Gestapo agent Koppel, were killed at his behest. In late April, Luburić approved the executions of Lorković and Vokić, as well as others who had been implicated in the Lorković–Vokić plot.

As the Partisans neared, Luburić suggested that the Ustaše make their last stand in Zagreb, but Pavelić refused. The Ustaše were divided as to what to do. Some proposed retreating towards Austria as quickly as possible. Others, Luburić foremost among them, advocated establishing irregular formations in the countryside that would carry out guerrilla attacks following the NDH&#x27;s demise. On 24 April, forty-three Roma and Sinti were killed in Hrastina by Luburić&#x27;s followers. In early May, Luburić met with the Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, who implored him not to put up armed resistance against the Partisans. On 5 May, the government of the NDH left Zagreb, followed by Pavelić. By 15 May, the NDH had completely collapsed. Tens of thousands of Ustaše surrendered to the British Army but were handed back to the Partisans. An untold number were killed in subsequent Partisan reprisal killings, together with several thousand Serbian and Slovenian collaborationists.

Some Ustaše, who came to be known as Crusaders (), remained in Yugoslavia and carried out guerrilla attacks against the communists. Among these was a small group of fighters led by Luburić, which remained in the forests of southern Slovenia and northern Slavonia, skirmishing with the newly formed Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (; JNA). Luburić evaded capture and probable execution by placing his identification papers next to the body of a dead soldier. Through Matković and Moškov, Luburić sent a letter to Pavelić, who had escaped to Austria, in which he signalled his intention to keep fighting. Three different accounts exist of Luburić&#x27;s activities in post-war Yugoslavia. According to one, Luburić then headed south towards the Bilogora mountain range, where he rendezvoused with a group of more than fifty Crusaders under the leadership of Branko Bačić. They headed west, establishing a base at Fruška Gora. In November 1945, Luburić and about a dozen Crusaders crossed the Hungarian–Yugoslav border and escaped Yugoslavia. The second version holds that Luburić was wounded in a gunfight with the JNA, and carried across the Drava River to Hungary by General Rafael Boban, who subsequently returned to Yugoslavia and was never heard from again. The third version, espoused by Luburić himself, is that Luburić fought with the Crusaders until late 1947 when he was seriously wounded and forced to leave the country.

Luburić&#x27;s half-sister Nada and her husband Dinko Šakić escaped to Argentina. Some of Luburić&#x27;s remaining kin were not as fortunate. Miloš was captured by the Yugoslav authorities in July 1947, together with several other Crusaders, after sneaking back into the country as part of the Crusaders&#x27; insurgency efforts. He was subsequently put on trial for the atrocities that he was alleged to have committed during the war. During his trial, he confessed in graphic detail to his role in the killings that took place at Jasenovac. He was convicted on all counts and executed in 1948.

==Later years==
===Exile===
In 1949, Luburić relocated to Spain. The country was viewed as a favourable destination by many Ustaše exiles, as it had been the only one outside the Axis to recognize the NDH. Luburić entered Spain under the pseudonym Maximilian Soldo. Upon arrival, Luburić was imprisoned by the Spanish authorities, but released shortly thereafter. With support from Agustín Muñoz Grandes, the former commander of the Blue Division, he was able to settle in the country. He took up residence in Benigànim.

Pavelić, in the meantime, had settled in Buenos Aires with his family and started a construction business. He became the unofficial leader of the Croatian émigré community in South America. Pavelić&#x27;s exile in distant and remote Argentina rendered him virtually irrelevant in the eyes of increasing numbers of Croatian émigrés elsewhere, particularly in Europe. Faced with open rebellion, in July 1950, Pavelić dispatched Luburić to Rome as a warning to anyone wishing to challenge his authority in Western Europe&#x27;s Croatian émigré communities. Given his wartime record, Luburić arrived &quot;with a fearsome reputation,&quot; the historian Guy Walters writes. In August, Pavelić issued a declaration in a Chicago-based Croatian diaspora newspaper, warning Croats against joining foreign militaries. While Luburić is not thought to have killed any of Pavelić&#x27;s political opponents in the post-war period, the mere invocation of his name drastically reduced the size of the anti-Pavelić faction among the émigrés. When the grumblings of discontent against Pavelić subsided, Luburić returned to Spain. In 1951, he appeared in Hamburg and set up a recruiting centre for the pro-Pavelić faction. That same year, he established a newspaper called &quot;Drina&quot;. In November 1953, Luburić married a Spanish woman named Isabela Hernaiz. The couple went on to have four children, two boys and two girls.

===Rift with Pavelić===

In 1955, Pavelić entered discussions with Chetnik émigrés over the future partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Greater Croatia and Greater Serbia in the event of Yugoslavia&#x27;s collapse. Luburić was incensed. In his writings, Luburić argued that Croatia, much like the NDH, should extend as far as the Drina River, but also include areas of Serbia, such as Sandžak, which had never been part of the wartime puppet state. Luburić vehemently denounced Pavelić and his followers. Shortly thereafter, he founded the Friends of the Drina Society () and the Croatian National Resistance (; HNO). In June 1956, Pavelić founded a rival organization, the Croatian Liberation Movement (; HOP).

In 1957, Luburić&#x27;s wife received an anonymous letter detailing her husband&#x27;s wartime atrocities, with great emphasis placed on his role in the killing of children. She filed for divorce shortly thereafter. During the divorce proceedings, Luburić was granted joint custody of the couple&#x27;s children, as well as possession of their home. The same year, he sold the home and moved to the town of Carcagente, near Valencia, where he opened a poultry farm. The farm quickly went out of business and Luburić soon became a traveling salesman. Upon moving to Carcagente, he founded Drina Press, an amateur publishing house, which was situated in his home. Luburić&#x27;s neighbours, who knew him by the name Vicente Pérez García, were apparently unaware of his wartime past. He wrote articles under the pseudonyms General Drinjanin and &quot;Bojnik&quot; Dizdar (Colonel Dizdar). In his writings, Luburić conceded that he had made certain mistakes during the war, but never admitted to or expressed remorse for the atrocities that had been attributed to him. He advocated &quot;national reconciliation&quot; between the pro-Ustaše and pro-communist Croats. Luburić also claimed to have made contact with the Soviet Union&#x27;s intelligence services. He argued that Croatia should become a neutral state in the event of Yugoslavia&#x27;s disintegration, which was received particularly poorly in some fiercely anti-communist Croatian émigré circles.

On 10 April 1957, while returning from a celebratory gathering marking the anniversary of the NDH&#x27;s establishment in Buenos Aires, Pavelić was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt by the State Security Administration (; UDBA), the Yugoslav secret service. He died in Madrid in December 1959 of complications related to his wounds. Owing to the mutual resentment between the two men, Luburić was barred from attending his funeral. Following Pavelić&#x27;s death, Luburić unsuccessfully attempted to take control of the HOP, citing his role as the last commander of the Croatian Armed Forces. After the HOP&#x27;s senior leadership rebuffed him, Luburić went down an increasingly militarist path, establishing neo-Ustaše training camps in several European countries and publishing articles relating to military tactics and guerrilla techniques. In 1963, he established a paper called &quot;Obrana&quot; (&quot;Defense&quot;).

==Death==
On the morning of 21 April 1969, Luburić&#x27;s teenage son discovered his father&#x27;s bloody corpse in one of the bedrooms in his home. Luburić had been killed the day before. Blood stains on the floor suggested he had been dragged by his feet from the kitchen and crudely stuffed under a bed. He had been bludgeoned over the head multiple times with a blunt instrument. An autopsy determined that Luburić had not died from the blows to his head, but rather that he had choked on his own blood. He was buried in Carcagente in a funeral ceremony attended by hundreds of Croatian nationalists wearing Ustaše uniforms, who chanted Ustaše slogans and delivered fascist salutes. Luburić&#x27;s death spelt the end of &quot;Drina&quot; and &quot;Obrana&quot;.

Luburić&#x27;s murder came at a time when the UDBA was carrying out assassinations of leading Croatian nationalist figures across Europe and suspicion inevitably fell on them. In 1967, Luburić had employed his godson, Ilija Stanić, to work at his publishing firm. Stanić&#x27;s father, Vinko, had served alongside Luburić during the war. He was captured by the Yugoslav authorities while fighting with the Crusaders and died in captivity. Declassified Yugoslav intelligence documents show that Stanić was a UDBA agent, codenamed Mongoose. According to the minutes of his May 1969 debriefing, Stanić told his handlers that he first poisoned Luburić&#x27;s coffee, which had been given to him by another UDBA agent. After the poison failed to kill him, Stanić began to panic and went to his room to retrieve a hammer. When he returned to the kitchen, Luburić complained he was feeling unwell. As he went to vomit in the sink, Stanić struck him over the head several times, causing him to fall to the floor. Stanić then left the kitchen to make sure the front door was locked. When he returned, he saw Luburić standing over the sink and wincing in pain. Stanić struck him over the head once more, fracturing his skull, and then wrapped his body in blankets and dragged it to a nearby bedroom. Stanić said he initially wanted to hide the body in the print shop, but that Luburić was too heavy, so he decided to hide it under the bed and calmly left the house. He then fled to France before making his way back to Yugoslavia. In a speech delivered on 20 May 1969, exactly one month after the murder, Tito hinted at the UDBA&#x27;s responsibility for the string of recent assassinations of Croatian émigrés, and noted how the agency had achieved some remarkable successes, &quot;especially recently.&quot;

In a July 2009 interview with the Croatian weekly &quot;Globus&quot;, Stanić changed his story, claiming that Luburić had been killed by two HOP members. Aggrieved by a disparaging comment that Luburić had allegedly made about Stanić&#x27;s father and his post-war guerrilla activities, Stanić claims that he sought out the two men, who assured him that they merely wished to administer a beating. The day that Luburić was murdered, Stanić alleged that he allowed the men inside Luburić&#x27;s home, and the two then killed Luburić with a single blow to the head from a heavy metal bar. In 2012, Stanić changed his story once more, this time accusing two different men of killing Luburić. As of 2020, Stanić lived freely in Sarajevo.

==Legacy==
===Influence on Croatian nationalism===
Following Luburić&#x27;s death, the leadership of the HNO went to several of his close associates, eventually splitting into rival leaderships in North America, Australia, Sweden and Argentina. Leadership of the HNO&#x27;s Argentine faction was delegated to Luburić&#x27;s brother-in-law Dinko Šakić. In April 1971, two HNO affiliates entered the Yugoslav embassy in Stockholm and killed Yugoslavia&#x27;s ambassador to Sweden, Vladimir Rolović. The two men were arrested but set free the following year after a group of Croatian nationalists hijacked a Swedish domestic flight demanding their release. One of Rolović&#x27;s killers, Miro Barešić, underwent a baptism while in prison and adopted the Christian name Vjekoslav in Luburić&#x27;s honour. The HNO boasted several thousand members at its height. Notable members included Zvonko Bušić, Gojko Šušak and Mladen Naletilić, among others. Bušić masterminded the hijacking of TWA Flight 355 in September 1976. Šušak became Croatia&#x27;s Minister of Defence in 1991. Naletilić was convicted of committing war crimes against Bosniak civilians during the Bosnian War by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

During the Croatian War of Independence, open admiration for Luburić could be found in the Croatian Army&#x27;s officer corps. Ante Luburić (no relation), who served as a senior officer during the Battle of Vukovar, was nicknamed Maks by his confederates because of his battlefield ferocity. Luburić &quot;seemed pleased with his sobriquet&quot;, the journalist Robert Fox remarked. In early 1992, General Mirko Norac expressed admiration for Luburić after being relieved of his duties on the orders of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman. &quot;Fuck all the Croatian generals with Tuđman at the top,&quot; Norac remarked. &quot;The only general for me is ... Maks Luburić.&quot; Luburić is referenced in the opening lines of the Croatian nationalist song &quot;Jasenovac i Gradiška Stara&quot;, which read as follows:
Darko Hudelist, a journalist and Tuđman biographer, considers Luburić one of the three most important Croatian political figures of the post-war period, alongside Tito and Tuđman. Hudelist argues that Tuđman was influenced by Luburić&#x27;s writings, which called for the unification of the ideologically disparate factions that made up the Croatian diaspora. This became a key policy priority of Tuđman&#x27;s Croatian Democratic Union during his presidency. The historian Ivo Goldstein concurs with Hudelist&#x27;s hypothesis and surmises that Luburić in turn was influenced by Francisco Franco&#x27;s calls for reconciliation between Republicans and Nationalists in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. Hudelist&#x27;s hypothesis has been challenged by the journalist Ivan Bekavac, who accuses Hudelist of attempting to cast Tuđman in a pro-fascist light.

In 2017, flyers containing excerpts from a speech delivered by Luburić appeared in Sarajevo&#x27;s Dobrinja neighbourhood. In July 2018, Spain&#x27;s ruling Socialist Workers&#x27; Party proposed a law against the memorization of fascist figures. It was speculated that if the law was passed, the Spanish authorities would be able to usurp Pavelić and Luburić&#x27;s tombs, under the pretext that they had become places of pilgrimage for neo-fascists, and move them to less prominent locations or transfer them to Bosnia. On 29 September 2018, the historian Vlado Vladić held an event at a Roman Catholic priory in Split promoting his book &quot;Hrvatski vitez Vjekoslav Maks Luburić&quot; (&quot;The Croatian Knight Vjekoslav &quot;Maks&quot; Luburić&quot;). The event was condemned by the Croatian left, who accused Vladić of glorifying Luburić and the Catholic Church of facilitating historical revisionism. Among those in attendance was Dario Kordić, who served as the vice-president of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia during the Bosnian War. Kordić was later found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the ICTY for his role in the Lašva Valley ethnic cleansing, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.

===Assessment===

Contemporary German accounts place the number of Serbs killed by the Ustaše at about 350,000. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, between 320,000 and 340,000 Serbs were killed by the Ustaše throughout the war. Most modern historians agree that the Ustaše killed over 300,000 Serbs, or about 17 per cent of all Serbs living in the NDH. At the Nuremberg trials, these killings were judged to have constituted genocide. The Ustaše were also responsible for the deaths of 26,000 Jews and 20,000 Roma. The historian Emily Greble estimates that approximately 200,000 wartime deaths can be attributed to Luburić. During the war, Luburić boasted that the Ustaše had killed more Serbs in Jasenovac, &quot;than the Ottoman Empire was able to do during its occupation of Europe.&quot; He also confided in Hermann Neubacher, the Reich Ministry of Foreign Affairs&#x27; Plenipotentiary for Southeastern Europe, that he believed about 225,000 Serbs had been killed at Jasenovac. An incomplete list of victims compiled by the Jasenovac Memorial Site contains the names of 83,145 individuals, including 47,627 Serbs, 16,173 Roma and 13,116 Jews. Most historians agree that around 100,000 people were killed at Jasenovac.

In 1998, Šakić was arrested in Argentina. The following year, he was extradited to Croatia to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Šakić was convicted on all counts and sentenced to twenty years&#x27; imprisonment. He died in July 2008. Luburić&#x27;s half-sister Nada was arrested around the same time as her husband but was released due to lack of evidence. She died in February 2011. In July 2011, the Government of Serbia issued a warrant for her arrest, apparently unaware that she had died earlier that year. When the Serbian authorities learned of her death, the warrant was revoked. Šakić described his brother-in-law as a &quot;humanitarian&quot; and &quot;a protector of the Jews&quot;. Several of Luburić&#x27;s contemporaries, as well as numerous scholars, have offered a starkly different assessment. Arthur Häffner, an &quot;Abwehr&quot; officer, denounced Luburić as one of Pavelić&#x27;s &quot;fiercest bloodhounds.&quot; In academic literature, Luburić is frequently described as a sadist. The Holocaust scholar Uki Goñi characterizes him as &quot;a bloodthirsty madman.&quot; &quot;Of all the &quot;Poglavnik&quot;&#x27;s thugs,&quot; Walters writes, &quot;Luburić was the worst.&quot; Jozo Tomasevich, a historian specializing in the Balkans, described Luburić as one of the &quot;most brutal and bloodthirsty&quot; members of the Ustaše movement. Carmichael refers to Luburić as &quot;one of the most notorious war criminals of the Second World War.&quot; The historians Ladislaus Hory and Martin Broszat describe Luburić as &quot;one of the most feared and most hated&quot; Ustaše leaders.

<doc id="1056254" wikidata="Q1129976" url="?curid=1056254" title="In Bloom">
<text>&quot;In Bloom&quot; is a song by American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain. It appears as the second track on the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, released by DGC Records in September 1991.

The &quot;Nevermind&quot; version is the second of two versions of the song that were released in 1991, the earlier of which was recorded in 1990, while the band was still signed to their original record label, Sub Pop. This version was initially released as a music video only, on the &quot;Sub Pop Video Network Volume 1&quot; VHS compilation.

&quot;In Bloom&quot; was released as &quot;Nevermind&#x27;s&quot; fourth and final single in November 1992 and generated heavy American airplay, reaching number 5 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, despite never being released as a physical single in the United States. The international release of the single made the top 10 in Ireland and Portugal, as well as the top 20 in Finland and New Zealand and the top 30 in Sweden and the United Kingdom. It was accompanied by a new music video, directed by American filmmaker Kevin Kerslake, which won Best Alternative Video at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.

==Early history==
According to Nirvana&#x27;s bassist Krist Novoselic, &quot;In Bloom&quot; &quot;originally sounded like a Bad Brains song,&quot; before being slowed down and reworked by Cobain at home. In a 2002 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with David Fricke, Novoselic recalled that Cobain &quot;went home and [he] hammered it. He kept working on it. Then he called me on the phone and said, &#x27;Listen to this song.&#x27; He started singing it on the phone. You could hear the guitar. It was the &#x27;In Bloom&#x27; of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, more of a pop thing.&quot;

The song was first performed live on April 1, 1990, at the Cabaret Metro in Chicago. The following day, the band began work on recording a new release for their then-label Sub Pop, at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin with producer Butch Vig. Among the eight songs recorded during the five-day session was &quot;In Bloom&quot;, which originally featured a bridge that Vig removed by physically cutting it out of the 16-track master tape with a razor blade, and throwing it in the garbage. The original plan of releasing the songs recorded during this session on a single release were abandoned later in the year, after the exit of drummer Chad Channing. The band instead used the material as a demo tape, which circulated amongst the music industry and generated interest in the group among major record labels. However, a few songs from the session still appeared on various official releases in 1990 and 1991. &quot;In Bloom&quot; was released as a music video only, on the &quot;Sub Pop Video Network Volume 1&quot; VHS compilation in 1991.

==&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
&quot;In Bloom&quot; was re-recorded by Vig at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California in May 1991, during the sessions for the band&#x27;s second album and major label debut, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. It was one of the first songs worked on during the sessions, due to Vig&#x27;s familiarity with it from his previous session with the band. Like the other songs recorded at Smart Studios, the arrangement for &quot;In Bloom&quot; was left mostly unchanged, with the band&#x27;s new drummer Dave Grohl staying close to what Channing had played.

According to Vig, Cobain&#x27;s impatience with recording multiple vocal takes made it difficult to acquire a master vocal take. In the 2005 documentary &quot;Classic Albums: Nirvana – Nevermind&quot;, Vig revealed the methods he used to get Cobain to record multiple takes, which included tricking him into believing that certain parts were not properly recorded and needed to be done again, and reminding him that the Beatles&#x27; John Lennon double-tracked his vocals in the studio. The varying intensity of Cobain&#x27;s vocals from one take to the next, and from the verses to the choruses, also presented a problem for Vig, who had to adjust the input levels &quot;on the fly&quot; while recording Cobain. Ultimately, Vig was able to edit several takes together into a single master, due to the consistency of Cobain&#x27;s vocal phrasing.

Vig also decided to have Grohl sing high harmonies, double-tracking them as he did with Cobain&#x27;s. Grohl initially had difficulty hitting the proper notes, but ultimately was able to sing what Vig wanted. The original studio version of &quot;In Bloom&quot; featured no harmonies, possibly due to time constraints.

==Post-&quot;Nevermind&quot;==
&quot;In Bloom&quot; was performed for the final time live on March 1, 1994, at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany, Nirvana&#x27;s last show.

==Composition==
===Music===
Like many other Nirvana songs, &quot;In Bloom&quot; shifts back and forth between quiet verses and loud choruses. Cobain uses a Mesa Boogie guitar amplifier for the verses, and during the chorus he switches to a Fender Bassman amp (suggested by Vig) for a heavier, double-tracked fuzztone sound. The rhythm section of Novoselic and Grohl kept its parts simple; Grohl stated it was &quot;an unspoken rule&quot; to avoid unnecessary drum fills, while Novoselic said he felt his role was about &quot;serving the song&quot;.

===Lyrics===
According to the 1993 Nirvana biography &quot;Come As You Are&quot; by Michael Azerrad, &quot;In Bloom&quot; was originally written about &quot;the jocks and shallow mainstream types&quot; of the underground music scene the band began to find in their audience after the release of their 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;. As Azerrad points out, the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed&quot; following the breakthrough success of their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. &quot;The brilliant irony,&quot; Azerrad wrote, &quot;is that the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it.&quot; English journalist Everett True suggested the song may also have addressed the band&#x27;s discomfort with being part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, saying that &quot;I assumed it was directed towards the fans who would show up at concerts with signs saying Even Flow [a Pearl Jam song] on one side and Rape Me – I think – on the other: the fans who did not understand there was a point of difference between Nirvana and other Seattle bands or media representations of grunge. I&#x27;ve always associated the song with [In Utero single] Rape Me. Like they&#x27;re a pair.&quot;

In his biography of Cobain, &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot;, Charles R. Cross asserted that the song was a &quot;thinly disguised portrait&quot; of Cobain&#x27;s friend Dylan Carlson.

==Release and reception==
Originally Cobain wanted to release In Bloom on a promotional EP as well as their first major label debut single after signing with DGC, for the then-second album sessions with Sub Pop, entitled Sheep. The EP would&#x27;ve been titled &quot;NIRVANA Sings Songs of the Vaselines, the Wipers, Devo, &amp; Nirvana&quot;.

&quot;In Bloom&quot; was released as the fourth and final single from &quot;Nevermind&quot; on November 30, 1992. The commercial single was only released in Europe, while promotional copies were released in the United States. The 12-inch vinyl and CD versions of the commercial single featured live versions of &quot;Polly&quot; and &quot;Sliver,&quot; from the band&#x27;s show at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California on December 28, 1991, as b-sides. The 7-inch vinyl and cassette versions featured only &quot;Polly.&quot; The single peaked at number 28 on the British singles chart. Despite the lack of a commercial release domestically, the song reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Album Rock Tracks chart. In Israel, it was voted in at number 15 on the IBA&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Israel&quot; singles chart.

Music journalist Everett True wrote an uncharacteristically unfavorable review of the single in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, accusing it of &quot;milking&quot; the success of &quot;Nevermind&quot;. &quot;Whoop whoop bloody whoop&quot;, wrote True, &quot;forgive me if I don&#x27;t sound too thrilled. This release is stretching even my credulity beyond repair. Like, milking a still-breathing (sacred) cow, or what? Badly inferior live versions of &#x27;Polly&#x27; and &#x27;Sliver&#x27; on the flip don&#x27;t help matters either.&quot;

===Legacy===
In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;In Bloom&quot; at number 415 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2019, the magazine ranked it second on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2023, Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked &quot;In Bloom&quot; at number 10 on &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list. According to Nielsen Music&#x27;s year-end report for 2019, &quot;In Bloom&quot; was the seventh most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 131,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s.

In 2019, Cobain was given a songwriting credit on the single &quot;Panini&quot; by American rapper and singer Lil Nas X, due to the song having a similar chorus melody as &quot;In Bloom&quot;. As Nas X explained in a SiriusXM interview, &quot;I put out the snippet [of &#x27;Panini&#x27;] and everyone was like, &#x27;Wow, he&#x27;s sampling Nirvana.&#x27; I was like, &#x27;Where? I&#x27;m not sampling Nirvana, this beat doesn&#x27;t have Nirvana in it.&#x27; Then, I listened to &#x27;In Bloom&#x27; in full, and I was like, &#x27;Oh, okay.&#x27;&quot; Nas X revealed that the song was approved by Kurt&#x27;s daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, and that the experience &quot;actually got me into &quot;[Nevermind]&quot; for the first time.&quot;

In a 2021 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Cobain&#x27;s widow, Courtney Love, said she was &quot;very firmly in the club that says ‘In Bloom’ should have been the first single&quot; from &quot;Nevermind&quot;, calling it &quot;a far better song&quot; than &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;

==Music videos==
===&quot;Alternate&quot; version===
The first music video for &quot;In Bloom&quot;, for the Smart Studios version, was directed by Steve Brown, and filmed in New York City in April 1990, shortly after the song had been recorded. It features footage of the band walking around lower Manhattan, including the South Street Seaport, the Lower East Side, and Wall Street on April 25, as well as rehearsal footage and clips from the band&#x27;s show at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, New Jersey on April 28. Novoselic had shaved his head as punishment for what he perceived to be a bad performance at the Pyramid Club in New York City on April 26, and so appears with hair in some shots, and with a shaved head in others.

The video was first released in 1991 on the &quot;Sub Pop Video Network Volume 1&quot; compilation. It was re-released on the DVD of the band&#x27;s rarities box set, &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, in November 2004. The audio of this version appeared on some copies of the promotional EP, &quot;Selections from With the Lights Out&quot;, which was released shortly before the box set, but not on the box set itself. It did not appear on a commercial release until the full Smart session was included on disc two of the 20th anniversary &quot;Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; versions of &quot;Nevermind&quot; in September 2011.

The video is listed as &quot;Alternate Version&quot; on Nirvana&#x27;s official YouTube channel.

===&quot;Nevermind&quot; version===
The second music video for &quot;In Bloom&quot;, for the &quot;Nevermind&quot; version, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had directed the videos for the band&#x27;s previous two singles from &quot;Nevermind&quot;, &quot;Come as You Are&quot; and &quot;Lithium&quot;. The video was filmed on October 15, 1992 and first aired in late November. According to Michael Azerrad, Cobain&#x27;s original concept for the video was &quot;a surrealistic fable about a little girl who is born into a Ku Klux Klan family and one day realizes how evil her parents are.&quot; This proved to be &quot;too ambitious,&quot; so Cobain instead came up with the idea of making a video that parodied the musical performances of wholesome pop bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

The low-def black and white footage was filmed on old Kinescope cameras, following Cobain&#x27;s request that Kerslake use authentic cameras from the period, and the band&#x27;s performance was improvised. The satirical tone was a result of Cobain being &quot;so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously . . . I wanted to fuck off and show them that we have a humorous side to us&quot;. The video begins with an unnamed variety show host, played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of American reality show &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, introducing Nirvana to an in-studio crowd of young fans, whose screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as &quot;thoroughly all right and decent fellas,&quot; perform dressed in suits, while Cobain wears glasses that made him dizzy. As Cobain explained in a 1992 &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview, &quot;We wanted to be like The Beatles – no, The Dave Clark Five, I was wearing glasses – we would never make fun of The Beatles.&quot; Novoselic had cut his hair short for the video, and liked it so much he kept it that way afterwards. As the song progresses, the band members destroy their instruments and the set.

Three edits of the Kerslake video were made. Cobain wanted MTV to first play the first edit, featuring the band in suits only, and eventually replace it with a second edit featuring the band wearing dresses and performing in their traditional manner, which included destroying the set. However, Cobain was skeptical that MTV&#x27;s alternative rock show &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, which insisted on premiering the video, would properly convey the humor of the &quot;pop idol&quot; version. As a result, the familiar third edit was produced which contained shots of the band in both suits and dresses. The original edit of the video never aired.

The &quot;In Bloom&quot; music video won the award for Best Alternative Video at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards, and topped the music video category in the 1992 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. It was placed into heavy rotation on MTV in the US. It was also played on MTV Europe. It was also played on MTV Australia, &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Video Smash Hits&quot; in Australia.

<doc id="1056258" wikidata="Q7691332" url="?curid=1056258" title="Teachings of Prem Rawat">
<text>The core of Prem Rawat&#x27;s teaching is that the individual’s need for fulfillment can be satisfied by turning within to contact a constant source of peace and joy. Rather than a body of dogma, he emphasizes a direct experience of transcendence, which he claims is accessible through the four techniques of meditation which he teaches. He calls these techniques &quot;Knowledge&quot; and says that Knowledge will take &quot;all your senses that have been going outside all your life, turn them around and put them inside to feel and to actually experience you.&quot;

In his public speeches he quotes from Hindu, Muslim and Christian sources, but he relies on the experience provided by the four meditation techniques for his inspiration and guidance. According to scholar and follower Ron Geaves, this lack of professed concepts allows his followers a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal. Rawat places no outer requirements or prohibitions on those taught the techniques, nor does he regard himself as an exemplary leader. Practitioners are asked not to reveal these techniques to anyone else, but to allow others to prepare to receive the experience for themselves. Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses.

==History==
Scholars have asserted that Prem Rawat&#x27;s teachings originate in the traditions of the North Indian Sants, who dismiss all religious ritual and dogma and emphasize the possibility of a direct experience of God, who, they claim, &quot;dwells in the heart&quot;. Theologically, their teachings are distinguished by an inward, loving devotion to a divine principle, and socially by an egalitarianism that is opposed to the qualitative distinctions of the Hindu caste system. Sants believe that the Guru or Perfect Master is an embodiment of God and a fitting object of worship. Some of the more notable Sant gurus include Namdev (d.1350), Kabir (d.1518), Nanak (d.1539), Mirabai (d.1545), Surdas (d.1573), Tulsidas (d.1623), and Tukaram (d. 1650). Other scholars refer to affinities with medieval traditions of Nirguna Bhakti (Sanskrit = &quot;formless devotion&quot;), with a similar emphasis on universalism, equality and direct experience, and criticism of blind allegiance to religious ritual and dogma.
Hans Ji Maharaj, Rawat&#x27;s father and guru, was a devotee of Swarupanand, and became a guru in 1936 on Swarupanand&#x27;s death. He began presenting his message and teaching the techniques of Knowledge in the small town of Najibabad, near Haridwar. His talks were strongly influenced by the reformist philosophy of the Arya Samaj, and he viewed himself primarily as the &quot;Guru of the Poor&quot;. His teachings were rich in metaphor and more concerned with practical applications than theory. Unusually for an Indian teacher, he accepted students irrespective of caste, religion or status, and drew his share of criticism from traditional Hindus. In 1936 he published a book &quot;Hans Yog Prakash&quot; as a first step to broadening the dissemination of his message.

==Teachings==
Prem Rawat did not inherit a formal set of teachings nor did he develop one, as he sees conceptual thinking as the main enemy of the direct religious experience which he claims can be obtained through the techniques of Knowledge. His central claim is that God resides in every human being and the human quest for fulfillment can be resolved by turning inward to discover a constant source of contentment and joy. He gives equal billing to all religions, quoting from Hindu, Muslim and Christian sources, but rather than rely on scriptures for inspiration and guidance, Rawat relies on the experience provided by the four techniques of Knowledge. This lack of professed concepts allow his followers a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal.Neither in the time of the father, Shri Hans, nor in that of the son, did the Divine Light Mission possess a systematically developed set of teachings. Both saw [doctrines] as presenting more problems than advantages ... The young Guru explains that conceptual thinking, translated with the English word “mind” in German translations also, is the main enemy of direct religious experience. It is therefore hardly surprising that little firm information about DLM teachings can be obtained from his followers. On the other hand, the lack of professed concepts allows them a freedom of expression which is spontaneous and personal, and which makes an agreeable contrast with the unexamined reproduction of received teachings [such as are found in other Indian-inspired groups.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Rawat relocated to the U.S. and while his teachings remained essentially Hindu in origin and he continued with many Indian traditions, he managed with the minimum of Hindu terms and concepts, keeping his main emphasis on an individual, subjective experience. His first western discourses were criticized by some religious scholars as evangelical and lacking in substance and for stressing direct experience over intellect or religious conceptual thinking.

A reporter at an appearance in Boston described Rawat as &quot;...a real human being. He spoke humbly, conversationally, and without any apparent notion that he was God. In fact he seemed to consciously undercut the divine stage show and the passionate words said in his honor. Devotees and mahatmas speak of him as the guy who will out-Christ Christ, yet the guru himself claims, not that he is divine, but that his Knowledge is&quot;. Sociologist James Downton observed that from his early beginnings Rawat appealed to his followers to give up the concepts and beliefs that might impede them from fully experiencing the &quot;Knowledge&quot; or life force, but this did not prevent them from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity, and to project millennial preconceptions onto him and the movement. Stephen A. Kent, in the preface of his book &quot;From Slogans to Mantras&quot;, described his disappointment at hearing what he considered to be a poorly delivered and banal message by Rawat in 1974, and was surprised that his companions spoke glowingly about the same message.

Prem Rawat has never asked for payment for teaching Knowledge but it was reported that in the 1970s, some Indian mahatmas asked would-be initiates to empty their pockets and give what they had prior to receiving Knowledge. In 1974, Rawat began using Western initiators to teach the techniques of Knowledge and continued to transform his teachings in order to appeal to a Western context.

By the early 1980s Prem Rawat had dropped the title &quot;Guru&quot; and eliminated the last of the Indian aspects. Rawat does not see himself as bound by conventional beliefs or practices of any institutionalized religion or tradition-honored world view. He is essentially an iconoclast who plots his route by pragmatic decisions to meet the demands and challenges that occur in his public career as a teacher striving to convince people of the value of self-knowledge. Rawat claims that practicing Knowledge will allow the practitioner to experience joy, self-understanding, calmness, peace and contentment. Practitioners describe Knowledge as internal and highly individual, with no associated social structure, liturgy, ethical practices or articles of faith. According to Ron Geaves, Rawat speaks spontaneously, with an emphasis on an individual&#x27;s subjective experience rather than on a body of theoretical knowledge, and he draws upon real life experiences, including his own, rather than on interpretations of the scriptures. He is uncluttered by tradition in the manner of a contemporary Kabir or Nanak. Rawat advises students that for maximum benefit the techniques should be practised daily for at least one hour. He does not demand obedience, in that no outer requirements or prohibitions are placed on those taught the techniques. The axiom, &#x27;If you like it, practice it; if you don’t, try something else,&#x27; is frequently given in his public discourses. Neither does Prem Rawat regard himself as an exemplary leader, a role often ascribed to religious founders.

The experience of Knowledge is described by practitioners as internal and highly individual. The techniques are to be practised privately, and have no related social structure or hierarchy. According to students, there is no liturgy or social obligation involved. They also say that the techniques are universally applicable and their practice has no impact on, or relationship to, a student&#x27;s gender, race, sexual orientation, economic status, religion,
or national origin.

===Techniques of Knowledge===

According to the Dutch religious scholar and Christian minister Reender Kranenborg and the American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, the techniques of Knowledge are secret and were originally called &quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Sound&quot;, &quot;Name&quot; (or &quot;Word&quot;) and &quot;Nectar&quot;, but Maharaji now refers to them as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th techniques. Rawat asks practitioners to promise &quot;not to reveal these techniques to anyone&quot;, but says to &quot;let other people go through their own journey ... [so] they, too, can have the techniques when they are ready.&quot;

Kranenborg and Melton provide differing details of them in their writings but agree on a general description of the practices. &quot;Light&quot; involves careful pressure on the eyes, seeking to open the &quot;third eye&quot; after a long period of training and practice. This is comparable to similar Tantric practices. &quot;Sound&quot; involves positioning the hands over the ears and temples, with the goal of hearing the &quot;heavenly music&quot;. This is reported to be related to sabda-brahman meditation. &quot;Name&quot; or &quot;Word&quot; is a meditation concentrating on breath. &quot;Nectar&quot; involves tongue positioning, eventually leading the student to taste the &quot;nectar of life&quot;. Michael Drury describes these techniques as helping the practitioner to develop &quot;a deep and spiritual self-knowledge.&quot;

===Teaching Knowledge / The Keys===
In his early days in the West, Prem Rawat or his Mahatmas (renamed to &quot;Initiators&quot; in 1974) conducted &quot;Knowledge Sessions&quot; face-to-face in small groups. From 2001 the techniques were taught via a multimedia presentation made by Rawat. In 2005, Prem Rawat introduced &quot;The Keys&quot;, a program of five DVD&#x27;s which prepare the student for receiving Knowledge. The techniques are taught in Key Six. A request from a practitioner who feels they are ready to view Key Six will result in an invitation to a Knowledge Session. It is available in more than 50 languages (of which he speaks five himself: English, Hindi, Nepali, Spanish and Italian; the other languages are dubbed). In this presentation, Maharaji explains the techniques step-by-step, to ensure that they are understood and practiced correctly. This process takes 2½ hours, of which one hour is dedicated to practicing the techniques, 15 minutes each. Before the presentation starts, people are asked to keep three promises: a) to keep in touch, b) to give Knowledge a fair chance, and c) to not share these techniques with anyone. If attendees agree with these three promises they are invited to stay and receive &quot;the gift of Knowledge.&quot;

The Knowledge Sessions are facilitated by volunteers who operate the video equipment and ensure the comfort of the attendees. Knowledge Sessions are available throughout the year in most Western countries. In special cases, such as people who are in hospitals etc., or are otherwise bed-ridden, the volunteers go to them to conduct the Session.

==Reception==

===Scholars===
George D. Chryssides writes that the Knowledge according to Prem Rawat was based on self-understanding, providing the practitioner with calmness, peace, and contentment, as the inner-self is identical with the divine. Rawat emphasizes that this Knowledge is universal, not Indian, in nature.

Ron Geaves, who specializes in studies in comparative religion at Liverpool Hope University in England and who is one of the Western students of Prem Rawat,&lt;ref name=&quot;PIP/Cagan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; writes that Prem Rawat himself has stated that he does not consider himself to be a charismatic figure, preferring to refer to his teachings and the efficacy of the practice of the four techniques on the individual as the basis of his authority. The showing of the four techniques replaces the traditional diksha, and although it marks the sealing of master/disciple relationship, that is not emphasized in the session itself. Rather, the focus is on correct practice and staying in touch through participation or listening. Prem Rawat’s teachings make no reference to any traditional authority, neither person nor text.

Stephen J. Hunt describes Rawat&#x27;s major focus as being on stillness, peace and contentment within the individual, and his &#x27;Knowledge&#x27; consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one&#x27;s &quot;own nature.&quot; The Knowledge includes four secret meditation procedures and the process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full. They claim that Rawat&#x27;s authority comes from the nature of his teachings and their benefit to the individual.
In Sacred Journeys sociologist James V. Downton writes
Aside from all the psychological and social explanations one could offer to explain their conversions, the fact is that, during the Knowledge session or afterward in meditation, these young people had a spiritual experience which deeply affected them and changed the course of their lives. It was an experience which moved many to tears and joy, for they had found the answer they had been seeking. It was an experience which gave their lives more positive direction, meaning, and purpose. It was an experience which brought them into a new relationship to life and removed many blocks to growth. It was an experience-which sages have spoken about throughout history-of the oneness of life.

Marc Galanter (MD), professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse at the New York University Medical Center, writes that &quot;over the long term of membership, meditation also played an important role in supporting a convert&#x27;s continuing involvement. An analysis of the relationship between the time members spent in meditation and the decline in their level of neurotic distress revealed that greater meditation time was associated with diminished neurotic distress. This association suggests that the emotional response to meditation acts as a reinforcement for its continued practice.&quot; That is, the more a member meditated, in general, the better the person was likely to feel. Members apparently used meditation to relieve distress, both at scheduled times and on an ad hoc basis.

Paul Schnabel a sociologist, references Van der Lans, a religious psychologist employed at the Catholic University of Nijmegen. Van der Lans says that among his Western students, Rawat appeared to stimulate an uncritical attitude, giving them an opportunity to project their fantasies of divinity onto his person. According to these authors, the divine nature of the guru is a standard element of Eastern religion, but removed from its cultural context, and confounded with the Western understanding of God as a father, what is lost is the difference between the guru&#x27;s person and that which the guru symbolizes—resulting in what they refer to as limitless personality worship. Schnabel writes that this kind of understanding of the master-disciple relationship, alien to the original Eastern guru-disciple context, often ends in disillusionment for the disciple, who finds that the teacher in the end fails to live up to his or her expectations.

===Former followers===
Reports obtained by Ted Patrick and several scholars after deprogramming of several of Rawat&#x27;s former worshippers refer to the experience of Rawat&#x27;s &quot;meditation&quot; techniques as self-hypnosis, and as diminishing the ability to think both during the practice and for an extended period of time after cessation.

===Others===
Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses According to David V. Barrett, at the heart of Prem Rawat&#x27;s teaching is the Knowledge, and the experience is an individual, subjective experience rather than a body of dogma. In its Divine Light days the movement was sometimes criticized for this stressing of emotional experience over intellect. The teaching could perhaps best be described as practical mysticism.

<text>Corona is an Italian Eurodance project. Initially as a group formed by Brazilian-Italian singer and model Olga Maria de Souza and producer Francesco &quot;Checco&quot; Bontempi (a.k.a. Lee Marrow), they found commercial success with the worldwide hits &quot;The Rhythm of the Night&quot; (1993) and &quot;Baby Baby&quot; (1995). After the second album, Bontempi left the group and was replaced by Francesco Conte and Paolo Dughero.

== History ==
=== Beginning of the band&#x27;s career: 1993–1996 ===
Corona&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Rhythm of the Night&quot;, was released in Italy in November 1993 on Roberto Zanetti&#x27;s DWA record label and became an instant hit. It featured the voice of the Italian singer Giovanna Bersola, better known by her stage name Jenny B. It stayed at number 1 on the Italian music chart for eight consecutive weeks, but was not released elsewhere until the following year. A remixed version of the song became a number 2 hit in the United Kingdom in September 1994. Like several early 1990s Eurodance/Hi-NRG songs that eventually became American hits, &quot;The Rhythm of the Night&quot; did not become popular in the United States until well after its success had peaked in Europe. However, by spring 1995, the song was all over American radio and clubs, eventually reaching #11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was later released as a track in the 1995 studio album &quot;The Rhythm of the Night&quot;. Lead vocals for the remaining songs in the album were by the Welsh singer Sandy Chambers who also sang on the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Walking On Music&quot;.

Corona followed up with the 1995 singles &quot;Baby Baby&quot; and &quot;Try Me Out&quot;, with similar success. The single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Star&quot; was a moderate hit. A fifth single, &quot;Do You Want Me&quot;, became a regional hit in discotheques in the Eastern U.S. &quot;The Rhythm of the Night&quot; album sold modestly, peaking at #2 on the US Top Heatseekers chart and at #154 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

=== 1996–2004 ===
In 1996, after the demise of Discomagic Records, DWA Records reorganized its staff due to internal conflicts. As a result, the production of Corona was moved from DWA Records to Bontempi&#x27;s own label (World Of Music, which was also a sublabel of Discomagic).

The third album, &quot;And Me U&quot;, was released in 2001 by Brazil&#x27;s Abril Music, under the name Corona X. This time the vocals were by new vocalists, the sisters Bernadette &quot;Brandy&quot; Jones and Bambi Jones&#x27; (who died of complications from a benign tumor). Again, de Souza was just the face but still not the voice, as many people thought. Although Bontempi co-wrote some of the material in the album, he did not participate in the production and left the band. In 2004, as a tribute to de Souza&#x27;s native Brazil, Corona sang &quot;A cor dos teus olhos&quot; (&quot;The Colour of Your Eyes&quot;) which was distributed by 5000. De Souza described the song like an imprint of her childhood memory. It was an immediate hit. The same year &quot;Garota Brasileira&quot;, a song with spicy samba sounds, became a hit in Japan.

=== 2005–2009 ===
Towards the end of 2005, Souza finally sang on the records for the first time and re-emerged onto the European music scene with &quot;Back in Time&quot;, peaking at #36 in the Italian charts. It was followed by &quot;I’ll Be Your Lady&quot; (2006), the first song co-authored by de Souza.

=== 2010–2016 ===
Corona&#x27;s album &quot;Y Generation&quot; (2010), reached #1 on the Italian iTunes dance album chart. The first single was &quot;Angel&quot;”, followed by &quot;Saturday&quot; and &quot;My Song&quot;. Corona&#x27;s last single, &quot;Super Model&quot; reached #44 on the Italian Singles Chart and was later included in a re-edition of the album called &quot;Y Generation Remixed&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
In February 2024, they were selected alongside DJ Jad, Wlady and Ice MC to compete in the final of &quot;Una voce per San Marino 2024&quot;, the Sammarinese national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024. They finally placed 14th in the contest classification while the Spanish Rock music band Megara took 1st place.

<text>Sergeant John Ordway (c. 1775 – c. 1817), the youngest of ten siblings, was an important part of the Lewis and Clark Expedition across the United States. John Ordway was one of the sergeants from the United States Army who stepped forward to volunteer for the Corps of Discovery. Ordway exercised many responsibilities on the trip, such as issuing the provisions, appointing guard duties, and keeping the registers and records. John Ordway also kept a detailed journal about Native American life during the expedition.

==Early life==
John Ordway was probably born in 1775 in the town of Hebron, New Hampshire, though some sources say Dunbarton.

==Lewis and Clark Expedition==
Sergeant Ordway was recruited for the journey at Fort Kaskaskia. He was 29 years old and one of the few educated men on the trip. The expedition lasted from May 1804 to September 1806. Before the journey, John Ordway sent a message to his parents telling them of the purpose and determination of the expedition:
In February 1804, during the staging of the journey and still at Camp Dubois (also known as Camp Wood), Illinois, while Lewis and Clark were away and Ordway was in charge, some of the men became drunk while they were on their guard duty. In another incident on March 29, 1804, privates John Shields and John Colter, who were second cousins, threatened Ordway&#x27;s life. Both were put on trial for mutiny. However, both of them pleaded for, and received, forgiveness. After Colter&#x27;s return from the Oregon Coast with the Lewis and Clark Expedition Colter became the first known person of European descent to explore Yellowstone National Park and to see the Teton Mountain Range. Colter is widely considered to be the first known mountain man..

On the trip back to St. Louis, Missouri, where they started, John Ordway was asked to lead 10 men back to the head of the Jefferson River, where the Corps left their canoes before crossing the mountains. They were to follow the river and travel to the Missouri River, where they would meet Lewis and Clark. Ordway and his group successfully completed this assignment. 

==Post-Expedition years==
John Ordway returned from the Lewis and Clark Expedition and married Gracey Walker and became a successful landowner in what became New Madrid County, Missouri. He became the owner of two plantations, peach and apple orchards, which became very prosperous.

==Death==
In 1817, Ordway died of unknown causes at approximately age 42.

<doc id="1056273" wikidata="Q124467080" url="?curid=1056273" title="Attempted assassination of Theodore Roosevelt">
<text>On October 14, 1912, former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt survived an assassination attempt by John Schrank, a former saloonkeeper, while campaigning for the presidency in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Schrank&#x27;s bullet lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest after penetrating Roosevelt&#x27;s steel eyeglass case and passing through a 50-page-thick (single-folded) copy of his speech titled &quot;Progressive Cause Greater Than Any Individual&quot;, which he was carrying in his jacket pocket. Schrank was immediately disarmed and captured; he might have been lynched had Roosevelt not shouted for Schrank to remain unharmed. Roosevelt assured the crowd that he was alright, then instructed the police to take charge of Schrank and ensure he was not harmed.

As an experienced hunter and anatomist, Roosevelt correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung; he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, &quot;Friends, I shall ask you to be as quiet as possible. I don&#x27;t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot—but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.&quot;

Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Since doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.

Both President William Howard Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson suspended their campaigning until Roosevelt recovered and resumed his own. When asked if the shooting would affect his election campaign, he said to the reporter &quot;I&#x27;m fit as a Bull Moose.&quot; The Bull Moose had become a symbol of both Roosevelt and the Progressive Party, often referred to as simply the Bull Moose Party, after Roosevelt boasted that he felt &quot;strong as a bull moose&quot; after losing the Republican nomination in June 1912. He spent two weeks recuperating before returning to the campaign trail. He later wrote to a friend about the bullet inside of his body: &quot;I do not mind it any more than if it were in my waistcoat pocket.&quot;

The shooter, John Schrank, initially pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted murder, but the trial judge, unconvinced of Schrank&#x27;s sanity, declined his plea and the case was brought to trial. Schrank was found not guilty by reason of insanity by the jury and was committed to indefinite institutionalization.

==Background==
Theodore Roosevelt had ascended to the presidency following the assassination of William McKinley in 1901, serving the remaining 3 years 6 months of the term, and was then elected to a full term in the 1904 presidential election. He refused to run for another term in 1908, in accordance with the tradition established by George Washington that no one should serve more than two terms as US president (later codified in the 22nd Amendment). Roosevelt endorsed William Howard Taft, his secretary of war, at the 1908 Republican National Convention. Taft went on to win both the Republican nomination and the general election, but Roosevelt became dissatisfied with the work of his successor and in the next election sought to retake the presidency.

The 1912 presidential election campaign was characterized by a serious split in the Republican Party between the conservative wing under President Taft and the liberal/reform wing under ex-President Roosevelt. After a bitter confrontation at the 1912 Republican National Convention, Taft won renomination. Roosevelt led a bolt of his followers, who held a convention of their own and nominated him for president on the ticket of the Progressive Party, nicknamed the &quot;Bull Moose Party&quot;. Taft and his supporters attacked Roosevelt for being power-hungry and seeking to break the tradition that U.S. Presidents only serve two terms in office.

==Assassination attempt==


According to documents found on Schrank after the attempted assassination, Schrank had written that the ghost of William McKinley came to him in a dream and told Schrank to avenge his death, pointing to a picture of Theodore Roosevelt. Ultimately, on October 14, 1912, while Roosevelt was campaigning in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Schrank attempted to assassinate him.

Roosevelt was at the Gilpatrick Hotel, at a dinner provided by the hotel&#x27;s owner, a supporter. The ex-President was scheduled to deliver a speech at the Milwaukee Auditorium. News had circulated that Roosevelt was at the hotel, and Schrank (who had been following Roosevelt from New Orleans to Milwaukee) went to the hotel. The ex-president had finished his meal and left the hotel to enter an open car. Roosevelt stood to acknowledge the cheering of the assembled crowd, and Schrank acted.


Schrank did shoot Roosevelt, but the bullet lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest only after hitting both his steel eyeglass case and a 50-page copy of his speech titled &quot;&quot;, which he was carrying in his jacket pocket. As onlookers gasped and screamed, Elbert E. Martin, one of Roosevelt&#x27;s secretaries and an ex-football player, was the first to react, leaping at Schrank, wrestling him to the ground and seizing his gun. A. O. Girard, a former Rough Rider and bodyguard of the ex-president, and several policemen were upon Schrank at the same moment. Roosevelt stumbled, but straightened himself, and again raised his hat, with a reassuring smile upon his face. His aide, Harry Cochems, asked Roosevelt if he was hit, and Roosevelt simply said assuredly, &quot;He pinked me, Harry.&quot;

As Schrank was subdued and held up on his feet, the crowd went into a frenzy. Several of the closest men around Schrank began pummeling him, and others screamed &quot;kill him!&quot;, and &quot;hang him!&quot;. Roosevelt, seeing what was happening, shouted to the crowd, &quot;Don&#x27;t hurt him. Bring him here. I want to see him.&quot; The crowd, hearing Roosevelt&#x27;s voice, looked at Roosevelt, astonished to see him standing up and talking. A member asked, &quot;Is he okay?&quot;; Roosevelt, with a reassuring smile, waved his hat in the air and said, &quot;I&#x27;m all right, I&#x27;m all right.&quot; In relief, the crowd erupted in cheers, enabling four policemen to gain their way into the crowd and hold Schrank.

Roosevelt ordered, &quot;Bring him to me.&quot; Schrank was led to Roosevelt, and the two men looked into each other&#x27;s eyes. Putting his hands on Schrank&#x27;s head so he could look at him, and to determine if he had seen him before, Roosevelt said to Schrank, &quot;What did you do it for?&quot; Getting no response, he said, &quot;Oh, what&#x27;s the use? Turn him over to the police.&quot; As police held Schrank, Roosevelt looked down at him, and said, &quot;You poor creature.&quot; Roosevelt ordered, &quot;Officers, take charge of him, and see that there is no violence done to him.&quot; Girard and another officer led Schrank away into the hotel as the crowd booed at him and applauded for Roosevelt, abiding by his wishes. Roosevelt gave another reassuring tip of the hat to the crowd before he took off in his car. Schrank was led into the kitchen where he was turned over to the local police.

Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung, and he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his with blood seeping into his shirt. He spoke for 50 minutes before completing his speech and accepting medical attention. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I don&#x27;t know whether you fully understand that I have just been shot, but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.&quot;

Afterwards, probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt&#x27;s chest muscle, but did not penetrate the pleura. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, probably remembering what had happened to Roosevelt&#x27;s immediate predecessor who died after the bullet&#x27;s wound got infected, and Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life. In later years, when asked about the bullet inside him, Roosevelt would say, &quot;I do not mind it any more than if it were in my waistcoat pocket.&quot;

Both Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson suspended their own campaigning until Roosevelt recovered and resumed his. When asked if the shooting would affect his election campaign, he said to the reporter, &quot;I&#x27;m fit as a bull moose.&quot; Roosevelt made only two more speeches in the campaign. Although Roosevelt won more votes and electoral votes than Taft, Wilson bested both of them to win the presidency.

==Perpetrator==

The attempt on Roosevelt&#x27;s life was perpetrated by John Schrank, a Bavarian-born saloonkeeper from New York. Schrank was born in Erding, Bavaria, on March 5, 1876. He emigrated to the U.S. at the age of 9. His parents died soon after, leaving Schrank to work for his uncle, a New York tavern owner and landlord. Upon their deaths, Schrank&#x27;s aunt and uncle left him valuable properties, with the expectation that Schrank could live a quiet and peaceful life. Schrank was heartbroken, not just because he had lost his second set of parents, but also because his first and only girlfriend Emily Ziegler had died in the &quot;General Slocum&quot; disaster on New York&#x27;s East River. Schrank sold the properties, and drifted around the East Coast for years. He became profoundly religious, and a fluent Bible scholar, whose debating skills were well known around his neighborhood&#x27;s watering holes and public parks. He wrote spare and vivid poetry. He spent a great deal of time walking around city streets at night but caused no documented trouble.

==Aftermath and motives==
Schrank was arrested, pleaded guilty and held on US$7,500 () bail. Sergent Robert Flood asked him why he did it, and he said, &quot;I did it because I was opposed to the third term. Don&#x27;t talk to me I will not say anything until tomorrow, for I want to sleep.&quot; &quot;The Milwaukee Sentinel&quot; published a Newspaper extra on October 15, 1912 with the headline, &quot;Insane Man Shoots Roosevelt&quot;.

Soon after the assassination attempt, psychologists examined Schrank and reported that he had &quot;insane delusions, grandiose in character,&quot; declaring him to be insane. At his trial, the would-be assassin claimed that William McKinley&#x27;s ghost had visited him in a dream and told him to avenge his assassination by killing Roosevelt. Schrank was committed to the Central State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in Waupun, Wisconsin, in 1914. He remained there for 29 more years, until he died on September 15, 1943, of bronchial pneumonia. His body was donated to the medical school at Marquette University (now the Medical College of Wisconsin) for anatomical dissection.

Theodore Roosevelt opposed Schrank&#x27;s insanity claims. Roosevelt noted that Schrank, who had started following him in Louisiana, had the good sense to wait until he got to Wisconsin to attempt the murder, because Schrank probably would have gotten lynched if he had attempted the murder in a Southern state (as it was, he almost got lynched even in Wisconsin), and because Schrank would have been executed in a Southern state even if he had not been lynched.

For the 100th anniversary of the attempted assassination Historic Milwaukee Inc. reenacted the assassination attempt. The event was attended by Mayor Tom Barrett and took place on Sunday, October 14, in front of the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee, 333 W. Kilbourn Ave.

==Archive==
While John F. Schrank was committed, he wrote a number of letters to the doctor he was consulting at the mental hospital, Adin Sherman. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington possesses twenty of them. The letters are dated between 1914 and 1918. The accession number in the Manuscripts Collection is 148. 

The Milwaukee Public Library contains a collection of court exhibits and transcripts from Schrank&#x27;s trial. It is Local History Manuscript Collection 43.

<text>The SX-6 is a NEC SX supercomputer built by NEC Corporation that debuted in 2001; the SX-6 was sold under license by Cray Inc. in the U.S. Each SX-6 single-node system contains up to eight vector processors, which share up to 64 GB of computer memory. The SX-6 processor is a single chip implementation containing a vector processor unit and a scalar processor fabricated in a 0.15 μm CMOS process with copper interconnects, whereas the SX-5 was a multi-chip implementation. The Earth Simulator is based on the SX-6 architecture. 

The vector processor is made up of eight vector pipeline units each with seventy-two 256-word vector registers. The vector unit performs add/shift, multiply, divide and logical operations. The scalar unit is 64 bits wide and contains a 64 KB cache. The scalar unit can decode, issue and complete four instructions per clock cycle. Branch prediction and speculative execution is supported. A multi-node system is configured by interconnecting up to 128 single-node systems via a high-speed, low-latency IXS (Internode Crossbar Switch).

The peak performance of the SX-6 series vector processors is 8 GFLOPS. Thus a single-node system provides a peak performance of 64 GFLOPS, while a multi-node system provides up to 8 TFLOPS of peak floating-point performance.

The SX-6 uses SUPER-UX, a Unix-like operating system developed by NEC. A SAN-based global file system (NEC&#x27;s GFS) is available for a multinode installation. The default batch processing system is NQSII, but open source batch systems such as Sun Grid Engine are also supported.

<doc id="1056278" wikidata="Q1225065" url="?curid=1056278" title="New Rice for Africa">
<text>New Rice for Africa (NERICA) is a cultivar group of interspecific hybrid rice developed by the Africa Rice Center to improve the yield of African rice cultivars. Although 240 million people in West Africa rely on rice as the primary source of food energy and protein in their diet, the majority of this rice is imported. Self-sufficiency in rice production would improve food security and aid economic development in West Africa.

Beginning in 1992 and receiving extra impetus after the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, NERICA is available in three main varieties: upland, lowland, and irrigated.

==Background==
African rice &quot;Oryza glaberrima&quot; has been cultivated for 3,500 years and is well adapted to the African environment, but because of relatively low yield its cultivation has to a great extent been abandoned in favor of the import of (Asian) rice. The 2007–2008 world food price crisis provided an impetus for African countries and institutions to look to expand the growth of African rice varieties and become less dependent on imports.

===NERICA===
The NERICA Project, run by the Africa Rice Center, dates back to 1992, when Monty Jones began working on types of rice that &quot;combine the high yield potential of Asian rice with the local adaptation of African rice&quot;, with the first developed in 1994. For his leadership in developing NERICA, Monty Jones was named a co-recipient of the 2004 World Food Prize.

It is funded by the African Development Bank, the Japanese government, and the United Nations Development Programme, and preliminary data were presented at the Fourth Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD-IV) in 2008. The new rice varieties, which are suited to drylands, were distributed and sown on more than 200,000 hectares during the last five years in several African countrie. Despite these developments, in 2008 the yields were projected to fall short of meeting the growing demand for rice as a food staple.

==New rice for Africa==
The new rice for Africa was created by crossing &quot;O. glaberrima&quot; and &quot;O. sativa&quot;. Because the different species do not naturally interbreed, a plant tissue culture technique called embryo-rescue was used to assure that crosses between the two varieties survive and grow to maturity. The new rices display heterosis, the phenomenon in which the progeny of two genetically different parents grow faster, yield more, or resist stresses better than either parent.

Key features of the new varieties include:
*An increase in grain head size from 75-100 grains per head to 400 grains per head.
*An increase in yield from 1 tonne per hectare to 2.5 tonnes per hectare, yield increases to 5 tonnes per hectare with fertilizer use.
*Contains 2% more protein than their African or Asian parents.
*They are taller than most rices, which makes harvesting easier.
*They resist pests, and they tolerate drought and infertile soils better than Asian varieties.

Some NERICA lines show high growth with low uptake of water and seem to be appropriate for long periods of cultivation in drought condition.

==Uganda==
Upland varieties of NERICA were introduced in Uganda in 2003, as part of a strategy to eradicate poverty. Its high yield, short maturity, and resistance to drought were thought to make it worth growing throughout the country. A study published in 2012 found that half of the farmers who started growing NERICA in 2004 were no longer growing it in 2006; this high dropout rate was thought to be caused by factors including a lack of credit and agency support for farmers, the newness of rice as a crop in the country, and a lack of good seeds. However, the study also suggested that family income among NERICA adopters had been boosted.

<text>Welcome Home is the second studio album by the American band &#x27;Til Tuesday, released in 1986. It peaked at No. 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band supported the album with a North American tour.

==Production==
The album was produced by Rhett Davies. All of its songs were written or cowritten by Aimee Mann.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mann is adept at writing melancholy lyrics about shattered romance, but they don&#x27;t have to be set to languid music.&quot; &quot;The Gazette&quot; determined that &quot;none of the members of this East Coast modern pop quartet could put together a decent song if it were written on their beautiful foreheads, and one more video band takes the gas.&quot; The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; called &quot;Welcome Home&quot; &quot;a warm, sepia-toned collection of tunes that exploit Mann&#x27;s songwriting abilities.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded that &quot;one by one, the songs just barely steer clear of self-pity... But together, they add up to an album as single-mindededly morose as Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;.&quot; Timothy White in &quot;Spin&quot; noted that &quot;Mann writes taut yet warmly ironic songs that succeed for their keen subtleties.&quot;

<text>In Apple&#x27;s macOS operating system, Quartz is the Quartz 2D and Quartz Compositor part of the Core Graphics framework. Quartz includes both a 2D renderer in Core Graphics and the composition engine that sends instructions to the graphics card. Because of this vertical nature, &quot;Quartz&quot; is often synonymous with &quot;Core Graphics&quot;.

In a general sense, &quot;Quartz&quot; or &quot;Quartz technologies&quot; can refer to almost every part of the graphics model from the rendering layer down to the compositor including Core Image and Core Video. Other Apple graphics technologies that use the &quot;Quartz&quot; prefix include these:
* Quartz Extreme
* QuartzGL (originally Quartz 2D Extreme)
* QuartzCore
* Quartz Display Services
* Quartz Event Services

==Quartz 2D and Quartz Compositor==
Quartz 2D is the primary two-dimensional (2D) text and graphics rendering library: It directly supports Aqua by displaying two-dimensional graphics to create the user interface, including on-the-fly rendering and anti-aliasing. Quartz can render text with sub-pixel precision; graphics are limited to more traditional anti-aliasing, which is the default mode of operation but can be turned off. In Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, Apple introduced Quartz 2D Extreme, enabling Quartz 2D to offload rendering to compatible GPUs. However, GPU rendering was not enabled by default due to potential video redraw issues or kernel panics. 
In Mac OS X v10.5 Quartz 2D Extreme was renamed to QuartzGL.

The Quartz Compositor is the compositing engine used by macOS. In Mac OS X Jaguar and later, the Quartz Compositor can use the graphics accelerator (GPU) to vastly improve composition performance. This technology is known as Quartz Extreme and is enabled automatically on systems with supported graphics cards.

<doc id="1056297" wikidata="Q432103" url="?curid=1056297" title="Suffragette City">
<text>&quot;Suffragette City&quot; is a song by the English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was originally released in April 1972 as the B-side of the single &quot;Starman&quot; and subsequently appeared on his fifth studio album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; (1972). The song was later reissued as a single in 1976, with the US single edit of &quot;Stay&quot; as the B-side, to promote the compilation album &quot;Changesonebowie&quot; in the UK. Co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, it was recorded by Bowie at Trident Studios in London with his backing band the Spiders from Mars, consisting of Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey, at a late stage of the album&#x27;s sessions. The song was originally offered to English band Mott the Hoople, who declined it and recorded Bowie&#x27;s &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; instead. It is a glam rock song that is influenced by the music of Little Richard and the Velvet Underground. The lyrics include a reference to Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; and the lyric &quot;Oooohh wham bam, thank you, ma&#x27;am&quot;.

&quot;Suffragette City&quot; received acclaim from music critics, with many praising the guitar work, the band&#x27;s performance, the false ending, the lyric and the song&#x27;s power. It has subsequently been called one of Bowie&#x27;s greatest songs by multiple publications, including &quot;NME&quot;. Bowie performed the song frequently during his concert tours and it has appeared on multiple compilation albums. It has been remastered several times, including 2012 for the 40th anniversary of the album; this version was included as part of the 2015 box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot;.

==Composition and recording==
&quot;Suffragette City&quot; was recorded on 4 February 1972 at Trident Studios, London, towards the end of the &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; sessions. Also recorded during this session were &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Suicide&quot; and &quot;Starman&quot;. It was co-produced by Bowie and Ken Scott and recorded with Bowie&#x27;s backing band the Spiders from Mars, consisting of Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder and Mick Woodmansey. Before recording it himself, Bowie offered &quot;Suffragette City&quot; to Mott the Hoople, an English band he greatly admired, provided they forgo their plan to break up. The group refused but recorded Bowie&#x27;s &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; instead.

The track is a glam rock, proto-punk, and hard rock song. The piano riff was heavily influenced by the music of Little Richard. The song features one of Bowie&#x27;s earliest uses of the ARP synthesiser, which would later become the backbone of his Berlin Trilogy. The instrument was used to mimic a saxophone, which underscores the guitar throughout the track. Bowie composed the riff, while Scott used the ARP located at Trident to find the right sound and Ronson played the notes. The backing vocals move from the left channel in the first verse to the right in the second. According to biographer Peter Doggett, while other rock songs such as the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and the Kinks&#x27; &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; use a standard three-chord structure that is spaced &quot;two and three semitones apart&quot; (such as E-G-A or A-G-C), &quot;Suffragette City&quot; uses tighter, two-semitone gaps (F-G-A), which &quot;leaves the ear to expect a softer A minor as the root of the song, only for a decisive A major chord to appear instead&quot;. Doggett believes that this decision gives the track its &quot;unrelenting power&quot;. The track&#x27;s acoustic guitar instrumentation was played by Bowie, but is mostly buried in the mix under Ronson&#x27;s electric guitar. After a false ending, Bowie cries &quot;wham bam, thank you, ma&#x27;am!&quot; before the band gets back into the groove, finishing with Bowie shrieking &quot;Suffragette!&quot;

According to Doggett, before &quot;Suffragette City&quot;, the only popular song to contain &quot;suffragette&quot; in its title was &quot;Sister Suffragette&quot;, from the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. He argues the film&#x27;s song has more to do with women&#x27;s liberation than &quot;Suffragette City&quot; does. &quot;Suffragette City&quot; includes the lyric &quot;Ah droogie, don&#x27;t crash here&quot;, a direct reference to the Anthony Burgess&#x27; novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1962); Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s film adaptation was a major influence on Ziggy Stardust&#x27;s cultural grab-bag, dictating both costumes and pre-show music on tour. The song was written only a few months after the film&#x27;s release in 1971. The famous, &quot;sexually charged&quot; hook &quot;wham bam, thank you, ma&#x27;am!&quot; previously appeared as the title of a song on jazz bassist Charles Mingus&#x27;s 1961 album &quot;Oh Yeah&quot;, as well as a 1967 song by the Small Faces. Bowie also uses the &quot;hey man!&quot; backing vocals in the same style as &quot;white light!&quot; from the Velvet Underground&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, a line from the 1970 song &quot;I Found Out&quot; by John Lennon, a Marc Bolan-esque boogie, &quot;some Flamin&#x27; Groovies speed, some Jerry Lee Lewis swagger&quot;, and a &quot;dose of hard rock theatrics&quot; to finish it out.

Bowie&#x27;s handwritten lyrics for the song were included in the &quot;David Bowie Is&quot; travelling exhibit from 2013 to 2018 and were put up for auction by the owner, who had been gifted the lyrics by Bowie, in late 2023.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Suffragette City&quot; was originally released on 28 April 1972 by RCA Records as the B-side of Bowie&#x27;s single &quot;Starman&quot; (as RCA 2199). It was subsequently released as the 10th and penultimate track on his fifth studio album &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot;, on 16 June of that year. RCA reissued the track as the A-side of a single (RCA 2726) on 9 July 1976, to promote the compilation album &quot;Changesonebowie&quot; in the UK, with the US single edit of the &quot;Station to Station&quot; track &quot;Stay&quot; as the B-side. The single failed to chart.

Since its release, &quot;Suffragette City&quot; has received critical acclaim, with many writers praising the guitar work. In a review of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; on its release, Richard Cromelin of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Suffragette City&quot; Bowie&#x27;s &quot;supreme moment as a rock &amp; roller&quot;. Noting the Velvet Underground influence, he praised the guitar work in the second half and the false ending, writing that the lyric &quot;Oooohh Wham Bam Thank you Ma&#x27;am!&quot; brings you back into it and would make you want to do somersaults. Cromlin concluded by saying that there&#x27;s only one thing left for the Star, quoting the lyric &quot;There&#x27;s only room for one and here she comes, here she comes&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised Ronson&#x27;s guitar work, writing, &quot;[Ronson] plays with a maverick flair that invigorates rockers like &#x27;Suffragette City&#x27;, &#x27;Moonage Daydream&#x27; and &#x27;Hang On to Yourself&#x27;&quot;. Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, noted the influence of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground, which was previously seen on the &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; track &quot;Queen Bitch&quot;, but found an overall better result in &quot;Suffragette City&quot;. Raggett similarly praised Ronson&#x27;s guitar work, acknowledging it as both a glam trademark and rock trademark. He further complimented the keyboards and piano, saying they add to song&#x27;s power and drive. Of the lyrics, Raggett said that some seem like &quot;bad ideas&quot; but that the false ending and famous hook make up for it.

Ian Fortnam of &quot;Louder&quot;, in a review ranking every song on &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&quot; from worst to best, placed &quot;Suffragette City&quot; at number five, calling it &quot;Ziggy&#x27;s most reconstructed rocker&quot;. Also praising the false ending and famous hook, he ends his review by describing the track as &quot;glam rock in excelsis&quot;. Jordan Blum, writing for &quot;PopMatters&quot;, described &quot;Suffragette City&quot; and &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; as the album&#x27;s standout tracks that are &quot;still endlessly addicting and pleasantly infectious&quot; 40 years later. He adds that both songs have &quot;archetypal&quot; guitar riffs that, together with the instrumentation and dynamics, make for phenomenal recordings. Blum concluded his review praising this track&#x27;s hook, chorus and horns, while acknowledging it as &quot;one of the best anthemic tracks ever made&quot;. In 2018, the writers of &quot;NME&quot; listed &quot;Suffragette City&quot; as Bowie&#x27;s 14th greatest song. In 2015, &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed the track on their list of the top 200 songs of the 1970s, writing, &quot;this song underscored Bowie&#x27;s broad interests – he pulled in references from Charles Mingus and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; – even as it showcased his willingness to experiment with things like the ARP synth&quot;.

==Live versions and subsequent releases==
On 16 May 1972, Bowie recorded &quot;Suffragette City&quot; for the BBC radio programme &quot;Sounds of the 70s, presented by John Peel&quot;; the session was broadcast one week later. In 2000, this recording was released on the compilation album &quot;Bowie at the Beeb&quot;. Pegg called the performance &quot;excellent&quot;, praising Ronson&#x27;s &quot;sharp&quot; guitar work and the boogie-woogie piano-playing from Nicky Graham. The song was frequently performed by Bowie during concert tours throughout his career. Performances from the &quot;Ziggy Stardust Tour&quot; (1972–1973) have appeared on the live albums &quot;Live Santa Monica &#x27;72&quot; (2008) and &quot;Ziggy Stardust: The Motion Picture&quot; (1983), the final concert of the tour at which Bowie unexpectedly announced it as &quot;the last show we&#x27;ll ever do&quot;. Performances from the 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour have appeared on &quot;David Live&quot; (1974), &quot;Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles &#x27;74)&quot; (2017), and &quot;I&#x27;m Only Dancing (The Soul Tour 74)&quot; (2020). A performance from the 1976 Isolar Tour was released on &quot;Live Nassau Coliseum &#x27;76&quot; (2017), while performances from the 1978 Isolar II Tour were included on the 2017 edition of Bowie&#x27;s live album &quot;Stage&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Blackout&quot; (2018).

Since its release, &quot;Suffragette City&quot; has appeared on numerous compilation albums, including &quot;Changesonebowie&quot; (1976), &quot;Changesbowie&quot; (1990), &quot;The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974&quot; (1997), and &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; (2002). The song, along with the entire &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; album, has been remastered multiple times, including in 1990 by Rykodisc, and 2012 for its 40th anniversary. The 2012 remaster and a 2003 remix, by producer Ken Scott, were included as part of the box set &quot;Five Years (1969–1973)&quot; in 2015.

<text>Seongnam Football Club () is a South Korean professional football club based in Seongnam that competes in the K League 2, the second tier of South Korean football. It is one of the most successful clubs in South Korea and the Asian Football Confederation, having won seven K League 1 titles and 2 AFC Champions League titles. 

== History ==
=== Ilhwa Chunma era 1989–2013===
==== Foundation ====
In 1975, Sun Myung Moon, the owner of Tongil Group, wanted to found a professional football club in South Korea. 

Since the Korean Super League was founded in 1983, he tried to find a club to participate in the league but Choi Soon-young, the head of Korea Football Association, ignored Moon&#x27;s interest due to a religious reasons.

Nevertheless, Tongil Group prepared the foundation of a new football club since 1986 and finally obtained a license from Korea Football Association as a club based in Seoul. 

Tongil Group firstly considered to establish the club in Honam provinces but there was objection from the local community.

Officially, the club was founded on 18 March 1989 as &quot;Ilhwa Chunma Football Club&quot;, and became the sixth member of the Korean Super League. 

The foundation ceremony was held in the Sheraton Walkerhill Hotel in Seoul. 

The club had chosen six players, including Ko Jeong-woon and signed Park Jong-hwan as the head coach. The contract with Park was a lucrative deal back then; a signing bonus of 100 million KRW was paid along with 48 million KRW as annual salary.

==== Early Successes ====
The club was successful from its beginning, winning its first League Cup three years after its foundation in 1992 and winning three consecutive league titles from 1993 to 1995. 

In 1995, K League clubs wanted to stop the club&#x27;s third consecutive title and agreed to change the league format back to two stages and the championship playoffs system; however, Ilhwa Chunma still won the title. 

The club won its first Asian title in the same year, defeating Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr in the final to achieve a league and continental double. 

==== Cheonan Bound ====
The club was forced to move out from Seoul in 1996 as part of the decentralization policy of the league.

Ilhwa Chunma moved to the city of Cheonan due to the city council proposition of refurbishing the Cheonan Oryong Stadium into the football-specific stadium and building another sports complex in Baekseok-dong. 

The club also changed its name to &quot;Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma&quot; as a part of the policy.

By the end of 1997, Ilhwa was still a successful team. The club reached the final of the 1996–97 Asian Club Championship and the 1997 Korean FA Cup. 

However, from 1998, the club went into a slump due to the core players moved out for various reasons, including Valeri Sarychev, Ilhwa&#x27;s goalkeeper, due to the K League&#x27;s year-by-year gradual restriction on foreign goalkeepers&#x27; appearances.

As a result, they had recorded the bottom of the league for two consecutive seasons, in 1998 and 1999. 

In mid-1999, Cha Kyung-bok considered to resign voluntarily due to the poor results.

On 21 November 1999, Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma was crowned as the winners of the 1999 Korean FA Cup by winning the final 3–0 against Jeonbuk Hyundai Dinos at Jeju Stadium.

==== Resettled in Seongnam ====
In 2000, the club moved to the Seoul satellite city of Seongnam and renamed themselves to &quot;Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma&quot;.

The move worked out very well, as the rejuvenated club went on to win three consecutive K League titles from 2001 to 2003, as well as a league cup title in 2002 and an A3 Champions Cup in 2004.

A disappointing 2004 campaign saw them meekly relinquish their title. The club&#x27;s shocking home ACL final defeat to Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad in the same year led to the resignation of their manager Cha Kyung-bok.

With Kim Hak-bum&#x27;s management, the club bounced back to the forefront of South Korean football in style as they claimed their seventh league title in 2006, defeating Suwon Samsung Bluewings 3–1 on aggregate in the championship playoff final. This was their seventh K League title which is a record out of all the K League clubs.

Before they were defeated by Suwon Bluewings 2–1 on 15 July 2007 in the 2007 season, they went undefeated for 22 consecutive league matches – the third longest streak in the history of the K League.

Seongnam reached the final of the 2007 K League Championship but were beaten 4–1 on aggregate by the Pohang Steelers, despite finishing in first place during the regular season.

Seongnam&#x27;s former player Shin Tae-yong returned as caretaker manager in the 2009 season, then as manager from the following season and continued the club&#x27;s success.

The club won the 2010 AFC Champions League, defeating local rivals Suwon in the quarter-finals and Iranian side Zob Ahan 3-1 in the final before 27,000 fans in Tokyo&#x27;s National Stadium. 

Another FA Cup trophy was won in 2011, with Seongnam beating Suwon 1–0 in the final.

=== Seongnam FC era (2014–present)===
In October 2013, Lee Jae-myung, the mayor of Seongnam, had a conference and announced that Seongnam City Council agreed to take over the club from Ilhwa Sports and will be participating under the name &quot;Seongnam FC&quot;.

In December 2013, Seongnam City officially took over the club from Ilhwa Co., Ltd. 

They changed their symbol to magpie, the symbol of the Seongnam city, from chunma, which was the symbol of the Unification Church. The yellow color of their uniform was also replaced with black. 

Their first manager Park Jong-hwan, who had managed the club from 1988 to 1996, returned to the club as manager once again.

The club played the first home game as Seongnam FC on 15 March 2014 against FC Seoul, resulting in a 0–0 draw. 

Their first post-rebranding victory came on 26 March, when they beat their bitter rivals Suwon Samsung Bluewings 2–0. The following month, manager Park Jong-hwan resigned after it was revealed that he had been assaulting players.

After months of confusion, the club appointed Kim Hak-bum, who previously led their golden age, as their manager. 

The return turned out to be successful, as Seongnam not only escaped relegation but also won their third FA Cup trophy, beating FC Seoul in a penalty shoot-out.

In the 2016 season, after Incheon&#x27;s win over Suwon FC on the final day of the season, Seongnam finished 11th and were relegated to the second division for the first time in their history after being defeated by Gangwon FC on away goals rule in the promotion-relegation playoffs.

Nam Ki-il was announced as the club&#x27;s new manager on 6 December 2017, replacing Park Kyung-hoon. He contributed a lot to the promotion of Seongnam FC to the first division just one season after it was demoted to the second division. 

Nam resigned his position as the manager of the club on 16 December 2019

Kim Nam-il was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager on 23 December 2019 to lead the club in the 2020 K League 1 season.

In 2022, the club was once again relegated to K League 2.

The club finished the 2024 K League 2 season dead last, but remained in the league due to no promotion and relegation between K League 2 and K3 League.

== Facilities ==
The club has played their home games in Tancheon Sports Complex since 2005. 

The stadium earned the nickname &quot;Tancheon Fortress&quot; (탄천요새) in the 2000s due to the club&#x27;s successful home record in the AFC Champions League.

The modern Seongnam Football Center, serving as the club&#x27;s training ground, was completed in December 2021, built at a cost of 26 billion won. It includes a natural grass training field, sauna, weight room, physical therapy room, and medical facilities.

=== Historical ===
Seongnam previously played their home games in the Cheonan Oryong Stadium when the club was based in Cheonan. On 22 August 1998, Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma had to finish the game against Jeonnam Dragons during the penalty shoot-out, after 1–1 draw in extra time. According to K League regulations back then, teams were required to decide the winner with the golden goal or the penalty shoot-out after the extra time, if the match score is level at the end of normal time. Since the stadium was not equipped with a floodlight system, they had to finish their games before sunset. Cheonan Ilhwa Chunma won the game by a draw.
== Supporters and rivalries ==
The club&#x27;s main supporters group is called Black List. 

Supporters of Seongnam have worked to protect the club amid rumors of its departure or dissolution.

Seongnam&#x27;s biggest rival team is Suwon Samsung Bluewings. Their rivalry has been dubbed the Magyedaejeon.

== Historical Asian performance ==
Seongnam won the 1995 Asian Club Championship, defeating Al-Nassr 1–0 after extra time in the final.

Seongnam reached the final of the 2004 AFC Champions League. Despite winning the away leg 3–1, they lost the home leg 5–0 to Saudi Arabian club Al-Ittihad and lost the tie 6–3 on aggregate. 

On 13 November 2010, Seongnam beat Iranian club Zob Ahan FC 3–1 in the final of the 2010 AFC Champions League.

This was Seongnam&#x27;s second AFC Champions League title and qualified them directly into the quarter-finals stage of the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup which they finished fourth.

Seongnam also placed fifth in the IFFHS Asian Clubs of the 20th century.

<text>2 Skinnee J&#x27;s (alternatively spelled Two Skinnee J&#x27;s or Too Skinnee J&#x27;s) is an American hip hop band from Brooklyn, New York, whose music has been categorized as nerdcore and rap rock. The band was founded in 1991 by Special J (vocals), Rabbi J-Slim (vocals), Joey Viturbo (guitar), Sammy B (bass guitar), DJ Casper (keyboards), and Andy Action (drums). With numerous line-up changes, the band was active through the 1990s until 2003, when they officially disbanded. The group recorded several demos, 2 EPs, and 3 studio albums; &quot;SuperMercado!&quot; on Capricorn Records, &quot;Volumizer&quot; on Volcano Records, and &quot;Sexy Karate&quot; on Dolphins vs. Unicorns. The band went through several key membership changes before its breaking up in 2003, although they briefly reunited for reunion tours in 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2012.

==History==
2 Skinnee J&#x27;s formed in 1991 at Columbia University in New York City. The original line-up was Special J and Rabbi J-Slim (vocals), Joey Viturbo (guitar), Sammy B (bass), DJ Casper (keyboards), and Andy Action (drums). Their first independent release was on cassette, titled &quot;6 Songs for 5 Bucks&quot;. They attracted a fan following through heavy touring in their early years. A second cassette release entitled &quot;American Heroes&quot;, was released in 1994 with the band titled &quot;Too Skinnee J&#x27;s&quot;. Several personnel changes saw original rapper J-Slim bass player Sammy B and guitarist Joey Viturbo part with the band; whilst J Guevara (formerly of Canadian ska band Me Mom and Morgentaler) and Stevie Spice (of Connecticut ska band Spicy Gribblets) were recruited. Former bassist Sammy B rejoined the band in 1995 as a guitarist and using the name King Vitamin.

They started to break into the mainstream in 1998 after signing with Capricorn and releasing &quot;SuperMercado!&quot;, which found airplay on modern-rock radio stations. 2 Skinnee J&#x27;s performed at Woodstock &#x27;99 and later criticized the event. Relations soured with Capricorn and the label delayed release of the second album on 2 Skinnee J&#x27;s two-album contract, &quot;Volumizer&quot;, produced by Mickey Petralia, for two years after it was recorded. The label folded and the band&#x27;s contract was bought by Volcano Records. When the album was officially released in 2002, many critics refused to review it again as they had reviewed a pre-release version years earlier. Rockworthy says the delay and its fallout, which left the band without a label, were a major problem and contributed to their decision to break up in 2003. &quot;Sexy Karate&quot; was released on indie label Dolphins vs Unicorn that year, before their farewell tour in 2003. They returned for a &quot;Five Nights of Fury&quot; tour in 2005 and another five-show reunion tour in 2008.

In 2009 the band website announced the September premier of &quot;Get In The Van&quot;, a film shot during the 2008 reunion tour.

Special J, Eddie Eyeball, Lance Rockworthy and Andy Action got together for the band&#x27;s next reunion tour, billed as &quot;acoustically-charged, tell-all brawls,&quot; of which there were seven dates between February 12 and April 16, 2010. These shows were held at small, intimate venues, and featured heavy audience participation, through Q&amp;A sessions and singalongs. In between acoustic versions of selections from their entire catalog of songs, each band member told stories about how songs were written, life on the road and the evolution of the band. J Guevara was scheduled to join the band for two of the April shows, and several hints were dropped about plans for a &quot;full-on electric&quot; tour to follow in summer 2010.

<text>Idrissa Ouédraogo (21 January 1954 – 18 February 2018) was a Burkinabé filmmaker. His work often explored the conflict between rural and city life and tradition and modernity in his native Burkina Faso and elsewhere in Africa. He is best known for his feature film &quot;Tilaï&quot;, which won the Grand Prix at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival and &quot;Samba Traoré&quot; (1993), which was nominated for the Silver Bear award at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival.

==Early life and education==
Idrissa Ouédraogo was born in Banfora, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), in 1954. He grew up in the town of Ouahigouya in the northern region of his homeland, and in 1976 he was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree. To ensure a better life his farmer parents sent him to Ouagadougou for further education, where he attended the African Institute for Cinema Studies () completing his studies in 1981 with a masters. After studying in Kyiv in the USSR he moved to Paris, where he graduated from the (IDHEC) in 1985 with a DEA from the Sorbonne.

==Early career==
On graduating from IAFEC in 1981, Ouédraogo set up his own independent film company, &quot;The Future of Films&quot;, which became &quot;Les Films de la Plaine&quot;. In 1981, before moving to Kyiv, he worked for the Burkina Faso Directorate of Cinema Production (), where he directed several short films.

In his earliest short, &quot;Pourquoi&quot; (1981), a man dreams of killing his wife, but is unsure if it is a dream or reality. Ouédraogo followed this with another short film, &quot;Poko&quot; (1981), which won the short film prize at that year&#x27;s Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO). &quot;Poko&quot; follows a young pregnant woman who dies after failing to reach medical facilities whilst being transported on a cart. The film highlighted the fact that despite paying their taxes, the poor gain little real help in day to day necessities from the government. This was followed by the shorts &quot;Les Écuelles&quot; (&quot;The Platters&quot;; 1983), &quot;Les Funérailles du Larle Naba&quot;, (&quot;Larle Naba&#x27;s Funeral&quot;; 1984), &quot;Ouagadougou, Ouaga deux roues&quot; (&quot;Ouagadougou, Ouaga Two Wheels&quot;; 1985) and &quot;Issa le tisserand&quot; (&quot;Issa the Weaver&quot;; 1985). His last short was &quot;Tenga&quot; (1985), which explores a villager who after moving to the city, returns to his hometown. In these shorts Ouédraogo explores themes and film techniques that he would return to in his future feature films.

==Feature films==
Ouédraogo&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Yam Daabo&quot; (&quot;The Choice&quot;; 1986) was well received, and focuses on a rural family&#x27;s decision to remain reliant on aid or to move location and become self-sufficient. His first film to receive greater distribution was &quot;Yaaba&quot; (&quot;Grandmother&quot;), which won awards at festivals, including the FIPRESCI Prize at Cannes, and was shown around the world, popular because of its beauty and simplicity. Despite its popularity, critics felt the &quot;Yaaba&quot; lacked the critical insight into the serious issues that affected village life.

His next film &quot;Tilaï&quot; (&quot;A Question of Honour&quot;) won the Grand Prix at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Centered around a moment of change in the Mòoré culture, where the lives of the children of a family are torn apart by the unwavering adherence to tradition in a rapidly transforming modern world. The success of both &quot;Yam Daabo&quot; and &quot;Tilaï&quot; placed pressure on Ouédraogo to produce another international success, and his next film &quot;Karim and Sala&quot; was rushed to be shown at the 12th Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) and was not well received and suffered from poor distribution. &quot;Samba Traoré&quot; (1993), returns to the themes of rural versus city life, tradition against change and was well received, being nominated for the Silver Bear at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. Ouédraogo followed &quot;Samba Traoré&quot; with &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Cry&quot; (&quot;Le Cri du cœur&quot;; 1994), &quot;Kini and Adams&quot; (1997), &quot;Anger of the Gods&quot; (&quot;La Colère des dieux&quot;; 2003) and &quot;Kato Kato&quot; (2006).

Ouédraogo&#x27;s output has been criticised as being too focused on appealing to audiences in Africa and the West. Françoise Pfaff names Ouédraogo, amongst a group of African directors, as a storyteller who has a predilection for filming shots of atypical African rural scenes, such as &quot;monotonous images of women pounding millet or corn&quot;. Pfaff&#x27;s view is that Ouédraogo&#x27;s work is too focused on non-African audiences and alienates African viewers. In defence, Sharon A. Russell argues that Ouédraogo must always consider the needs of a director who wishes to keep filming in Africa, and that funding for the next film is a priority and that he is a talented person making films under difficult circumstances.

==Later life and death==
In February 2015, Ouédraogo announced shortly before the opening of the 24th Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) his desire to direct &quot;an important film&quot; on foreign colonization of the African continent, the anti-colonial struggle and the leading figures of that movement. During a March 2015 interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Ouédraogo underlined what he believed to be three issues facing the film industry of Burkina Faso. Among those issues are the lack of sufficient knowledge and professionalism when it comes to cinematography. Funding shortages and the absence of a demanding local market are the two other problems he mentioned. During his last few years, Ouédraogo&#x27;s relatives noted his disappointment in modern African cinema due to what he considered to be deficiency in talent and in means of production.

At around 5:30 a.m. GMT on 18 February 2018, Ouédraogo died at the Bois clinic in Ouagadougou at the age of 64 as a result of an unspecified &quot;illness&quot;, according to a statement by the UNCB (Union nationale des cinéastes du Burkina). Shortly after his death, Burkinabé president Roch Marc Christian Kaboré said that his country &quot;had lost a filmmaker of immense talent&quot;. On 20 February, he was buried at the Gounghin Cemetery. On its way there, the funeral procession stopped by the Monument of African Filmmakers at the Place des Cinéastes, close to the Ouagadougou City Hall, where he was commemorated by the city&#x27;s mayor. The convoy then stopped in front of the gate of the FESPACO. Politicians, religious figures and artists were present at the procession, where he was given a military funeral.

<doc id="1056319" wikidata="Q2386239" url="?curid=1056319" title="Robert Herbert">
<text>Sir Robert George Wyndham Herbert, (12 June 1831 – 6 May 1905), was the first Premier of Queensland, Australia. At 28 years and 181 days of age, he was the youngest person ever to become premier of an Australian state.

==Early years==
Born in Brighton, England, on 12 June 1831, Herbert was the only son of the Hon. Algernon Herbert, a younger son of the first Earl of Carnarvon. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. He won a Balliol scholarship in 1849 and, subsequently, the Hertford and Ireland scholarships. He took a first-class in Classical Moderations, won the Latin verse prize in 1852, and obtained second-class final honours in the classical school. He was elected Fellow of All Souls in 1854, and was Eldon law scholar. In 1855, he became private secretary to William Ewart Gladstone and was called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1858.

==Queensland colony==
When Queensland was formed into a separate colony, Sir George Bowen was appointed the first governor. He arrived at Brisbane on 10 December 1859 and brought Herbert with him as his private secretary. On the day of the governor&#x27;s arrival, Herbert was gazetted as colonial secretary, with Ratcliffe Pring as attorney-general. These with the governor formed an executive council to which additions were made afterwards. At the election held early in 1860, Herbert was returned unopposed for one of the Leichhardt seats in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, and became the first Premier of Queensland. He showed himself to be a good leader and held office from December 1859 to February 1866.

During his time as Premier, four land acts were passed, and the education question was also the subject of early measures. The governor, in writing to the secretary of state, stated that the Queensland parliament &quot;had passed a greater number of really useful measures than any other parliament in any of the Australian colonies&quot;. Certainly, the first Queensland government was in marked contrast to those of the other colonies, each of which averaged half a dozen ministries in the same period. However, Herbert fell into some disfavour when financial difficulties arose. He resigned in February 1866 and was succeeded by Arthur Macalister who served as premier until 20 July 1866. Herbert was anxious to return to England on account of private business but, at the request of the governor, formed a ministry which lasted less than three weeks and before being merged into the second Macalister ministry. Herbert then left for England, having gained the sort of experience which was to be very useful to him in later years.

==Career in England==
A few months after Herbert&#x27;s arrival in England, he was appointed Assistant-Secretary to the Board of Trade. In 1870 was made Assistant Under-Secretary for the Colonies, while his relative, Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, was the serving Secretary of State and, in 1871, became Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. He held that position with great distinction for 21 years. In 1899/1900 he briefly took on the role as Acting Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies because of illness to Sir Edward Wingfield. His attitude was generally conciliatory and he was tactful in dealing with men who came in contact with him.

In 1882, he was created K.C.B. and, in 1892, G.C.B. In the same year, he was appointed chancellor of the Order of St Michael and St George. He left the Colonial Office in 1892, but afterwards took up his duties again for a few months at the special request of Joseph Chamberlain. In 1893–6, he was agent-general for Tasmania, and did active work in connection with the formation of the British Empire League. In December 1903, he was chairman of the tariff commission.

== Later years ==
In later years, Robert Herbert suffered from heart trouble. Believing his health would benefit from a sea voyage, he went for a cruise in the Mediterranean. He met his sister in Marseilles, France, where his health worsened and he returned immediately to England. He was taken in an ambulance railway car on the Great Eastern Railway to his residence at Ickleton, Cambridgeshire, where he died on 6 May 1905.

==Personal life==

Robert Herbert met his companion, John Bramston, at Balliol College Oxford University, England in the early 1850s. The pair shared rooms at Oxford, and also in London. When Herbert was Premier of Queensland, and Bramston his Attorney-General, the two created a farm on what is now the site of the Royal Brisbane and Women&#x27;s Hospital. They named the farmhouse in which they both lived &quot;Herston&quot;, a combination of their names, which is now the name of the modern day suburb.

Herbert never married, and modern historians, such as Robert Aldrich, Clive Moore, Robert French, and Garry Wotherspoon, conclude that he was likely gay. In 1864, Herbert gave this explanation as to why he had not married: &quot;It does not seem to me reasonable to tell a man who is happy and content, to marry a woman who may turn out a great disappointment.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Herston became the name of a modern-day Brisbane suburb surrounding the site of the Royal Brisbane and Women&#x27;s Hospital.

The Herbert River is located in Far North Queensland, Australia. The southernmost of Queensland&#x27;s wet tropics river systems, it was named in 1864 by the explorer George Elphinstone Dalrymple after Robert Herbert.

The Queensland federal electorate of Herbert, one of the original 65 divisions contested at the first federal election, was named after him.

Governor George Bowen, Queensland&#x27;s first Governor, appointed Sir Robert George Wyndham Herbert as first Colonial Secretary of Queensland before leaving England in 1859. This document was ranked #5 in the &#x27;Top 150: Documenting Queensland&#x27; exhibition when it toured to venues around Queensland from February 2009 to April 2010. The exhibition was part of Queensland State Archives&#x27; events and exhibition program which contributed to the state&#x27;s Q150 celebrations, marking the 150th anniversary of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales.

<doc id="1056321" wikidata="Q262479" url="?curid=1056321" title="Samuel Fuller">
<text>Samuel Michael &quot;Sam&quot; Fuller (August 12, 1912 – October 30, 1997) was an American film director, screenwriter, novelist, journalist, actor, and World War II veteran known for directing low-budget genre movies with controversial themes, often made outside the conventional studio system. Fuller wrote his first screenplay for &quot;Hats Off&quot; in 1936, and made his directorial debut with the Western &quot;I Shot Jesse James&quot; (1949). He would continue to direct several other Westerns and war thrillers throughout the 1950s.

Fuller shifted from Westerns and war movies in the 1960s with his low-budget thriller &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; in 1963, followed by the neo-noir &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; (1964). He was inactive in filmmaking for most of the 1970s, before writing and directing the semi-autobiographical war epic &quot;The Big Red One&quot; (1980), and the drama &quot;White Dog&quot; (1982), whose screenplay he co-wrote with Curtis Hanson. Several of his films would prove influential to French New Wave filmmakers, notably Jean-Luc Godard, who gave him a cameo appearance in &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (1965).

==Early life==
Samuel Michael Fuller was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, of Jewish parents, Rebecca (née Baum) and Benjamin Fuller. His father died in 1923 when Samuel was 11. After immigrating to the United States, the family&#x27;s surname was changed from Rabinovitch to Fuller, a name possibly inspired by Samuel Fuller (Pilgrim), a doctor who arrived in America on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. In his autobiography, &quot;A Third Face&quot; (2002), he says that he did not speak until he was almost five. His first word was &quot;Hammer!&quot;

After his father&#x27;s death, the family moved to New York City, where at the age of 12, he began working as a newspaper copyboy. He became a crime reporter in New York City at age 17, working for the &quot;New York Evening Graphic.&quot; He broke the story of actress Jeanne Eagels&#x27; death. He wrote pulp novels, including &quot;The Dark Page&quot; (1944; reissued in 2007 with an introduction by Wim Wenders), which was later adapted into the 1952 movie &quot;Scandal Sheet&quot;.

Late in life he said, &quot;If only a reporter could get a thousand dollars an hour the way a director does, I&#x27;d be in it today&quot;.

==Military service==

During World War II Fuller joined the United States Army. He was assigned as an infantryman to the 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, and saw heavy fighting. He was involved in landings in Africa, Sicily, and Normandy, and also saw action in Belgium and Czechoslovakia. In 1945, he was present at the liberation of a German concentration camp in Falkenau and shot 16-mm footage, known as &quot;V-E +1&quot;, that was later integrated into the French documentary &quot;Falkenau: The Impossible&quot; (1988). In 2014, the footage was selected for the United States National Film Registry. For his military service, Fuller was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and Combat Infantryman Badge. He reached the rank of corporal.

Fuller used his wartime experiences as material in his films, especially in &quot;The Big Red One&quot; (1980), the nickname for the U.S. 1st Infantry Division. After the war, Fuller co-authored a regimental history of the 16th Infantry.

==Career==
===Writing and directing===
&quot;Hats Off&quot; (1936) marked Fuller&#x27;s first credit as a screenwriter. He wrote many screenplays throughout his career, such as &quot;Gangs of the Waterfront&quot; in 1945. He was unimpressed with Douglas Sirk&#x27;s direction of his &quot;Shockproof&quot; screenplay, and made the jump to writer/director after being asked to write three films by independent producer Robert Lippert. Fuller agreed to write them if he would be allowed to direct them, as well, with no extra fee. Lippert agreed. Fuller&#x27;s first film under this arrangement was &quot;I Shot Jesse James&quot; (1949), followed by &quot;The Baron of Arizona&quot; with Vincent Price.

Fuller&#x27;s third film, &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot;, established him as a major force. The first film about the Korean War, made just six months into that conflict, he wrote it based largely on his own World War II experiences and tales coming out of Korea. The film was attacked by reporter Victor Riesel for being &quot;pro-Communist&quot; and &quot;anti-American.&quot; Critic Westford Pedravy alleged Fuller was secretly financed by &quot;the Reds.&quot; Fuller had a major argument with the U.S. Army, which provided stock footage for the film. When army officials objected to Fuller&#x27;s American characters executing a prisoner of war, Fuller replied he had seen it done during his own military service. A compromise was reached when the lieutenant threatens the sergeant with a court martial. The film marked the first collaboration between Fuller and actor Gene Evans. The studio wanted a more prominent star such as John Wayne, but Fuller was adamant that Evans be used because he was impressed by his fellow veteran&#x27;s authentic portrayal of a soldier.

After the success of &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot;, Fuller was sought out by the major studios. All gave him advice on tax shelters, except for Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century-Fox, who replied, &quot;We make better movies,&quot; the answer Fuller was seeking. Zanuck signed Fuller for a contract for seven films, the first being another Korean War film, &quot;Fixed Bayonets!&quot;, to head off other studio competition copying &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot;. The U.S. Army assigned Medal of Honor recipient Raymond Harvey as Fuller&#x27;s technical advisor; the two struck up a long friendship during filming, and Harvey later returned to advise him on &quot;Verboten!&quot;.

The proposed seventh film, &quot;Tigrero&quot;, based on a book by Sasha Siemel, is the subject of a 1994 documentary by Mika Kaurismäki. &quot;Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made&quot; featured Fuller and Jim Jarmusch visiting the proposed Amazon locations of the film. Film Fuller shot on location at the time was featured in his &quot;Shock Corridor&quot;.

Fuller&#x27;s favorite film was &quot;Park Row&quot;, a story of American journalism. Zanuck had wanted to adapt it into a musical, but Fuller refused. Instead, he started his own production company with his profits to make the film on his own. &quot;Park Row&quot; was a labor of love, and served as a tribute to the journalists he knew as a newsboy. His flourishes of style on a very low budget led critics such as Bill Krohn to compare the film to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Fuller followed this with &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; (1953), a film noir starring Richard Widmark, which became one of his best-known films. Other films Fuller directed in the 1950s include &quot;House of Bamboo&quot;, &quot;Forty Guns&quot;, and &quot;China Gate&quot;, which led to protests from the French government and a friendship with writer Romain Gary. After leaving Fox, Fuller started his Globe Productions that made &quot;Run of the Arrow&quot;, &quot;Verboten!&quot;, and &quot;The Crimson Kimono&quot;, and produced, wrote, and directed a television pilot about World War II soldiers to be titled &quot;Dogface&quot;, which was not picked up.

In 1961, Warner Bros. offered to finance &quot;The Big Red One&quot; in return for his making &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;. When Fuller had problems with Warner Bros.&#x27; editing of his film, the &quot;Big Red One&quot; fell through.

Fuller&#x27;s films throughout the 1950s and early 1960s generally were lower-budget genre movies exploring controversial subjects. &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; (1963) is set in a psychiatric hospital, while &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; (1964) featured a prostitute attempting to change her life by working in a pediatric ward. Both films were released by Allied Artists.

Between 1967 and 1980, Fuller directed only one film, the Mexican-produced &quot;Shark!&quot; (1969). Fuller unsuccessfully asked the Directors Guild to remove his name from the credits of &quot;Shark&quot;. He returned in 1980 with the epic &quot;The Big Red One&quot;, the semiautobiographical story of a platoon of soldiers and their harrowing experiences during World War II. The film won critical praise, but failed at the box office.
In 1981, he was selected to direct the film &quot;White Dog&quot;, based on a novel by Romain Gary. The controversial film depicts the struggle of a black dog trainer trying to de-program a &quot;white dog,&quot; a stray that was programmed to viciously attack any black person. He readily agreed to work on the film, having focused much of his career on racial issues. Already familiar with the novel and with the concept of &quot;white dogs,&quot; he was tasked with &quot;reconceptualizing&quot; the film to have the conflict depicted in the book occur within the dog rather than the people. He used the film as a platform to deliver an anti-racist message through the film&#x27;s examination of the question of whether racism is a treatable problem or an incurable disease.

During filming, Paramount Pictures grew increasingly concerned the film would offend African-American viewers, and brought in two consultants to review the work and offer their approval on the way Black characters were depicted. One felt the film had no racist connotations, while the other, Willis Edwards, vice president of the Hollywood NAACP chapter, felt the film was inflammatory and should never have been made. The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to producer Jon Davison along with warnings that the studio was afraid the film would be boycotted. Fuller was not told of these discussions, nor given the notes until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving Black actors nonstereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio&#x27;s actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film. After the film&#x27;s completion, Paramount refused to release it, declaring it did not have enough earnings potential to go against the threatened NAACP boycotts and possible bad publicity.

After &quot;White Dog&quot; was shelved by Paramount Pictures, Fuller moved to France in 1982, and never directed another American film. He directed two theatrical French films, &quot;Les Voleurs de la nuit&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Street of No Return&quot; in 1989. &quot;Les Voleurs de la nuit&quot; was entered into the 34th Berlin International Film Festival. He directed his last film, &quot;The Madonna and the Dragon&quot;, in 1990, and he wrote his last screenplay, &quot;Girls in Prison&quot;, in 1994.

With his wife, Christa Lang, and Jerry Rudes, Fuller wrote an autobiography &quot;A Third Face&quot; (published in 2002). This was the culmination of a long career as an author. Among his books are the novels “Burn, Baby, burn” 1935 &quot;Test Tube Baby&quot; (1936), &quot;Make Up and Kiss&quot; (1938) and &quot;The Dark Page&quot; (1944); novelizations of his films &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Big Red One&quot; (1980; reissued 2005); and &quot;144 Piccadilly&quot; (1971), and &quot;Quint&#x27;s World&quot; (1988). A book-length interview of Fuller by Jean Narboni and Noel Simsolo, &quot;Il etait une fois ... Samuel Fuller&quot; (with a preface by Martin Scorsese) appeared in 1986.

===Acting===
Fuller made a cameo appearance in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot le Fou&quot; (1965), where he famously intones: &quot;Film is like a battleground ... Love, hate, action, violence, death. In one word, emotion!&quot; He also made a cameo appearance at an outdoor cafe in Luc Moullet&#x27;s &quot;Brigitte et Brigitte&quot; (1966) along with French New Wave directors Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer, and André Téchiné. He plays a film director in Dennis Hopper&#x27;s ill-fated &quot;The Last Movie&quot; (1971); an Army colonel in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;1941&quot; (1979); a war correspondent in his film &quot;The Big Red One&quot; (scene deleted in the original release, restored in the reconstructed version), a talent agent in his film &quot;White Dog&quot; (1981), and a cameraman in Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;The State of Things&quot; (1982). He portrays an American gangster in two films set in Germany: &quot;The American Friend&quot; by Wenders and &quot;Helsinki Napoli All Night Long&quot; by Mika Kaurismäki. He also appeared in Larry Cohen&#x27;s &quot;A Return to Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; (1987), and played a businessman in (1992) by Aki Kaurismäki. His last work in film was as an actor in &quot;The End of Violence&quot; (1997). A photo of Fuller also appears on one of the mirrors of a stripper in his &quot;Shock Corridor&quot;.

===Style and theme===
Fuller&#x27;s work has been described as primitive by Luc Moullet and by the influential American critics Manny Farber and Andrew Sarris. Grant Tracey has used the term &quot;narrative tabloid&quot; to refer to Fuller&#x27;s style of filmmaking. This was the result of his often lower budgets, but also reflected Fuller&#x27;s pulp-inspired writing.

Fuller was known for using intense close-ups, off-centered framings, and shock editing in many of his films, which were often about men facing death in combat. These scenes were both violent and tragic.
Fuller often featured marginalized characters in his films. The protagonist of &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; is a pickpocket who lives on a floating shack in the East River. &quot;Shock Corridor&quot; concerns the patients of a mental hospital. &quot;Underworld U.S.A.&quot; (1961) focuses on an orphaned victim of mobsters. The lead female characters of &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot;, &quot;China Gate&quot;, and &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot; are prostitutes or gun molls. These characters sometimes find retribution for the injustices against them. &quot;White Dog&quot; and &quot;The Crimson Kimono&quot; (1959) have definite antiracist elements. &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot;, set during the Korean War, features a racially mixed cast and contains dialogue about the internment of Japanese-Americans and the segregation of the American military in World War II.

A number of Fuller&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Naked Kiss&quot;, &quot;The Baron of Arizona&quot;, &quot;Shockproof&quot;, &quot;House of Bamboo&quot;, &quot;Forty Guns&quot;, and &quot;The Big Red One&quot;, feature a leading character with the same name, Griff.

==Death==
In the early 1990s, Samuel Fuller, along with his wife, Christa, and their daughter Samantha, settled into a small apartment at 61 rue de Reuilly in the 12th arrondissement of Paris, but after he suffered a stroke in 1994, they returned to the States the following year. They resided in Los Angeles, where Fuller lived until he died at home of natural causes. In November 1997, the Directors Guild held a three-hour memorial in his honor, hosted by Curtis Hanson, his longtime friend and co-writer on &quot;White Dog.&quot; He was survived by his wife and daughter.

==Legacy==
Although Fuller&#x27;s films were not considered great cinema in their times, they gained critical respect in the late 1960s. Fuller welcomed the new-found esteem, appearing in films of other directors and associating himself with younger filmmakers. The French New Wave claimed Fuller as a major stylistic influence, especially Luc Moullet. His visual style and rhythm were seen as distinctly American, and praised for their energetic simplicity. Martin Scorsese praised Fuller&#x27;s ability to capture action through camera movement. In the 1996 Adam Simon-directed documentary &quot;The Typewriter, the Rifle &amp; the Movie Camera&quot;, Quentin Tarantino and Jim Jarmusch credited Fuller as influential upon their works. Most recently, his wife Christa Lang produced a documentary directed by their daughter Samantha about him. &quot;A Fuller Life&quot; uses footage he captured himself with celebrities such as James Franco reading from his autobiography.

In the mid-1980s, Fuller was the first international director guest at the Midnight Sun Film Festival. The festival&#x27;s hometown, Sodankylä, Finland, named a street &quot;Samuel Fullerin katu&quot; (&quot;Samuel Fuller&#x27;s street&quot;).

The moving image collection of Samuel Fuller is housed at the Academy Film Archive. The archive has preserved several of Samuel Fuller&#x27;s films, including &quot;The Crimson Kimono&quot;, &quot;Underworld U.S.A.&quot;, and &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot;. Additionally, the archive has preserved several of Fuller&#x27;s home movies, including those shot during his war service.

<doc id="1056327" wikidata="Q3302014" url="?curid=1056327" title="Max Baer Jr.">
<text>Maximilian Adelbert Baer Jr. (born December 4, 1937) is an American former actor, producer, comedian, and director widely known for his role as Jethro Bodine, the dim-witted relative of Jed Clampett (played by Buddy Ebsen) on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

==Early life==
Baer was born in Oakland, California, on December 4, 1937, the son of boxing champion Max Baer and his wife Mary Ellen Sullivan. His paternal grandfather was of German Jewish descent, and his mother was of Irish descent. His brother and sister are James Manny Baer and Maude Baer. His uncle was boxer and actor Buddy Baer.

He attended Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento, where he earned letters in four sports and twice won the junior title at the Sacramento Open golf tournament. Playing with Charlie Sifford, he later won the pro–am tournament at the 1968 Andy Williams - San Diego Open.

Baer served as a medical technician in the U.S. Air Force at Gunter Air Force Base, Alabama. Baer later earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from Santa Clara University, with a minor in philosophy.

==Career==
Baer began acting professionally in 1960 at Warner Bros., where he made appearances on television programs such as &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Surfside 6&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;The Roaring 20&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. His career took off two years later, when he joined the cast of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

===&quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;===

In 1962, Baer was cast in the role of the naïve but well-meaning Jethro Bodine, Jed Clampett&#x27;s cousin Pearl&#x27;s son. He also played Jethro&#x27;s twin sister Jethrine, though her voice was dubbed by actress Linda Kaye Henning.

He continued to take other parts during the nine-year run of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and appeared on the television programs &quot;Love, American Style,&quot; as well as in the Western &quot;A Time for Killing.&quot;

He declined to appear in the 1981 TV movie &quot;Return of the Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and his character was recast as a result.

===Later career===
Following the cancellation of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; in 1971, Baer made numerous guest appearances on television, but he found his TV acting career hampered by typecasting. He concentrated on feature motion pictures, especially behind the camera, writing, producing, and directing. Baer wrote and produced the drama &quot;Macon County Line&quot; (1974), in which he played Deputy Reed Morgan, the highest-grossing movie per dollar invested at the time. Made for less than US$200,000, it earned upwards of US$30 million at the box office, a record that lasted until &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; surpassed it in 1999. Baer also wrote, produced, and directed the drama &quot;The Wild McCullochs&quot; (1975), and played the role of Culver Robinson.

Baer is credited with being one of the first to use the title of a popular song as the title and plot anchor of a film, acquiring the rights to Bobbie Gentry&#x27;s hit song and producing the 1976 film &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot;, which he also directed. Made for US$1.1 million, the film grossed $27 million at the box office, and earned over US$2.65 million outside the US, US$4.75 million from television, and US$2.5 million from video. The film starred Robby Benson and Glynnis O&#x27;Connor.

Since the success of &quot;Ode to Billy Joe&quot;, the motion picture industry has produced more than 100 song-title movies. Baer pursued the rights to the hit song &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, recorded by the singer Madonna in 1984. When ABC tried to prevent him from making the film, he sued and won a judgment of more than US$2 million.

He directed the 1979 comedy &quot;Hometown U.S.A.&quot; before retiring to his home at Lake Tahoe, Nevada. He continues to make occasional guest appearances on television.

===Other ventures===
In 1985, Baer began investigating the gambling industry. He noted that tourists paid a US$5 to $6 admission to tour the &quot;Ponderosa Ranch&quot;, in Incline Village, Nevada, which was the location for filming exterior scenes for episodes of TV&#x27;s popular program &quot;Bonanza&quot;. The Ponderosa was a cattle ranch with horses, barns, Bonanza displays, restaurants, hay rides, and a wedding chapel, and tourists enjoyed the Ponderosa because of the &quot;Bonanza&quot; connection. Baer decided that tourists would also pay for something dealing with &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. He began using his Jethro Bodine role as a marketing opportunity toward the gambling and hotel industry. Baer obtained the sublicensing rights, including food and beverage rights, to &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; from CBS in 1991. His business partner estimates the cost of obtaining the rights and developing the ideas at US$1 million. Sixty-five &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot; slot machines were built in 1999 and placed in 10 casinos.

In late 2003, Baer attempted the redevelopment of a former Walmart location in Carson City into a &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;-themed hotel and casino, but was unsuccessful due to building code conflicts and other developers on the neighboring properties. On May 4, 2007, he announced the sale of the property and the purchase of another parcel just outside Carson City, in neighboring Douglas County, where he expected less resistance to his plans. Baer purchased a parcel in north Douglas County for US$1.2 million, and would purchase an additional once he obtained the required zoning variances. The plans were for a gambling area with 800 slot machines and 16 tables, flanked by various eateries, including &quot;Jethro&#x27;s All You Ken Et Buffet&quot;. The project would feature a showroom, cinema complex and a 240-room, five-story hotel.

Plans for Baer&#x27;s casino included a mock oil derrick spouting a 20- to flame.

As of July 2012, development of Jethro&#x27;s Casino had been suspended. Ongoing litigation involving Baer, the developer and Douglas County has delayed the development of the project indefinitely.

In 2014, Baer sued CBS after claiming a secret deal with a Des Moines-based Jethro&#x27;s BBQ was interfering with his opportunity to cash in on his role from the iconic television show. The lawsuit claims that Baer negotiated a deal with CBS in 1991 for the rights to use the fictional character and other motifs from the show to create a chain of restaurants, hotels, and casinos.

==Recent years==
He remained close friends with Buddy Ebsen until Ebsen&#x27;s death from pneumonia on July 6, 2003. Just before his acting mentor&#x27;s death, Donna Douglas and he had both visited Ebsen in the hospital.

In January 2008, Baer&#x27;s live-in girlfriend, 30-year-old Penthouse model Chere Rhodes, died from suicide in the 70-year-old&#x27;s Lake Tahoe home. Her suicide note mentioned &quot;relationship problems&quot;.

The 2015 death of co-star Donna Douglas left Baer as the last surviving regular cast member of &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;.

<doc id="1056329" wikidata="Q2740129" url="?curid=1056329" title="Authorship of the Johannine works">
<text>The authorship of the [[Johannine literature|Johannine works]] (the Gospel of John, the Johannine epistles, and the Book of Revelation) has been debated by biblical scholars since at least the 2nd century AD. The debate focuses mainly on the identity of the author(s), as well as the date and location of authorship of these writings.

Although authorship of all of these works has traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, only a minority of contemporary scholars believe he wrote the gospel, and most conclude that he wrote none of them. Although some scholars conclude the author of the epistles was different from that of the gospel, most scholars agree that all three epistles are written by the same author or school of thought.

With respect to the date and location of authorship of these writings, there is general agreement that all four works probably originated from the same Johannine community. That community is traditionally and plausibly either attributed to Ephesus or Damascus, AD.

In the case of Revelation, many modern scholars agree that it was written by a separate author, John of Patmos, , with some parts possibly dating to Nero&#x27;s reign in the early 60s.

==Early use and attribution of the Johannine works==
===Attestation===
The first supposed witness to Johannine theology among the Fathers of the Church is in Ignatius of Antioch, whose Letter to the Philippians some claim references John 3:8 and alludes to John 10:7-9 and John 14:6, but none of these are direct quotations or contain information exclusive to John. Polycarp of Smyrna quotes about the &quot;antichrist&quot; in his Epistle to the Phillipians 7:1, a sure reference from the letters of John because the antichrist doctrine is not found in the textual record before the Johannine letters. Justin Martyr also alludes to ideas in John, though this reference is not certain, so the dating of John is not settled.

The earliest testimony to the author was that of Papias, preserved in fragmentary quotes in Eusebius&#x27;s history of the Church. This text is consequently rather obscure. Eusebius says that two different Johns must be distinguished, John the Apostle, and John the Presbyter, with the Gospel assigned to the Apostle and the Book of Revelation to the Presbyter.

Irenaeus&#x27;s witness based on Papias represents the tradition in Ephesus, where John the Apostle is reputed to have lived. Irenaeus was a disciple of Polycarp, thus in the second generation after the apostle. According to many scholars, he states unequivocally that the apostle is the author of the Gospel. (Other scholars note, however, that Irenaeus consistently refers to the author of the gospel, as well as of Revelation, as &quot;the disciple of the Lord,&quot; whereas he refers to the others as &quot;apostles.&quot; And so Irenaeus appears to distinguish John, the author of the fourth gospel, from John the Apostle.) Koester rejects the reference of Ignatius of Antioch as referring to the Gospel and cites Irenaeus as the first to use it.

For some time it was common practice to assert that the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, which contains a small portion of chapter 18 of the Gospel of John, demonstrated that the text of the gospel spread rapidly through Egypt in the second century. However, more recent scholarship has shown the fragment may date from as late as the third or fourth century, rather than the second century, as was previously supposed.

Clement of Alexandria mentions John the Apostle&#x27;s missionary activity in Asia Minor, and continues, &quot;As for John, the last, upon seeing that in the Gospels they had told the corporal matters, supported by his disciples and inspired by the Holy Spirit, he wrote a spiritual Gospel.&quot; Origen, when asked how John had placed the cleansing of the Temple first rather than last, responded, &quot;John does not always tell the truth literally, he always tells the truth spiritually.&quot; In Alexandria, the authorship of the Gospel and the first epistle was never questioned. Bruce Metzger stated &quot;One finds in Clement&#x27;s work citations of all the books of the New Testament with the exception of Philemon, James, 2 Peter, and 2 and 3 John.&quot;

Rome was the home to the only early rejection of the fourth Gospel. The adversaries of Montanism were responsible. Irenaeus says that these persons tried to suppress the teaching about the Holy Spirit in order to put down Montanism, and as a result denied the authorship of the Gospel and its authority. Later Epiphanius called this group, who were followers of the priest Caius, the Alogi in a wordplay between &quot;without the Word&quot; and &quot;without reason&quot;.

===Quotations===
The gospel was not widely quoted until late in the 2nd century. Justin Martyr is probably the first Church Father to quote the Gospel of John. Some scholars conclude that in antiquity John was probably considered less important than the synoptics. Walter Bauer suggests:
One reason for this &#x27;orthodox ambivalence&#x27; was gnostic acceptance of the fourth gospel. The early Gnostic use is referred to by Irenaeus, Hippolytus and Origen in quoted commentary made on John by the Gnostics Ptolemy, Basilides and Heracleon. In the quote below Irenaeus argues against the gnostic heresy from his book &quot;Against Heresies&quot;:
Several church fathers of the 2nd century never quoted John, but the earliest extant written commentary on any book of the New Testament was that written on John by Heracleon, a disciple of the gnostic Valentinus.

The following table shows the number of times various church fathers cited John compared to the synoptic gospels.

==Gospel of John==

The authorship of the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, is widely contested. Scholars have debated the authorship of Johannine literature since at least the third century, but especially since the Enlightenment.

=== Overview ===
A summary of the proposed candidates is as follows:
* The apostle John, son of Zebedee – traditionally the author was identified as John the Apostle, but his authorship is almost universally rejected by modern scholars.
* John of Patmos, the author of the Book of Revelation (alias the Apocalypse of John) – mainstream scholars conclude that John of Patmos did not write the Gospel of John due to a wide range of differences in eschatology, language, and tone between the two texts.
* John the Presbyter – an obscure early church figure mentioned in the writings of Papias of Hierapolis.
* John the Evangelist – apart from being a potential nickname for any of the figures mentioned above, he could be an otherwise unknown person called John who wrote the Fourth Gospel.
* The Disciple whom Jesus loved (or Beloved Disciple) – an unnamed person referenced several times in the Fourth Gospel itself. Some theologians and scholars have, by way of elimination, identified this disciple as one of the Twelve Disciples of Jesus, usually John, son of Zebedee. Other scholars point out that verse 21:24 indicates that the author is someone other than this disciple, and that the author has merely used a (written or oral) report, allegedly from this disciple, as a source for the writing of the Fourth Gospel.
* A hypothetical &quot;Johannine community&quot; – a number of different authors who wrote the Fourth Gospel together, none of whom were necessarily named &#x27;John&#x27;.
* An unknown author – some scholars have concluded that, since the Fourth Gospel is anonymous, none of the proposed candidates are plausible (there is no reason to assume he was actually named &#x27;John&#x27;), and that because no new evidence is likely to emerge, the real author will remain unknown and unnamed. At most, the author is merely referred to as &#x27;John&#x27; (and the Fourth Gospel as &#x27;Gospel of John&#x27;) for the sake of convention, a placeholder name for an otherwise unknown person.
* Cerinthus – A group of Christians, referred to as Alogi by Epiphanius, credit Cerinthus with writing the Gospel of John and rejected this Gospel, while also accepting the Synoptic Gospels and maintaining a more-or-less standard Christology and Orthodox form of worship. According to Dionysius bar Salibi citing a lost work by Hippolytus of Rome, the Alogi were led by a man named Caius. The name Alogi was applied to them by their enemies, and what little is known about them comes from those who considered them heretics. The name Alogi is a play on words, meaning illogical in Biblical Greek and referring both to their beliefs as being illogical and a rejection of the Logos of John&#x27;s Gospel.
* Lazarus of Bethany

===Dating===
The Gospel of John is considered to be the last of the four canonical Gospels to be written. Most modern scholars date it to between 90 and 100AD, although a minority suggest an even later date. The Fourth Gospel may also have been written later as it was penned for a smaller group within the Johannine community, and was not circulated widely until a later date. However, claims of authorship that date much later than 100AD have been called into question due to the Rylands Library Papyrus P52, a fragment of the gospel found in Egypt that was probably written around 125AD.

===19th century views===
According to Adolf Julicher, K.G. Bretschneider&#x27;s 1820s work on the topic of Johannine authorship pioneered the modern critical scholarship on this topic. Bretschneider called into question the apostolic authorship of the Gospel, and even stated that, on the basis of the author&#x27;s unsteady grip of topography, the author could not have come from Palestine. He argued that the meaning and nature of Jesus presented in the &quot;Gospel of John&quot; was very different from that in the Synoptic Gospels, and thus its author could not have been an eyewitness to the events. Bretschneider cited an apologetic character in John, indicating a later date of composition. Scholars such as Wellhausen, Wendt, and Spitta have argued that the fourth gospel is a &quot;Grundschrift&quot; or a, &quot;..work which had suffered interpolation before arriving at its canonical form; it was a unity as it stood.&quot;

Walter Bauer opened the modern discussion on John with his book &quot;Rechtgläubigkeit und Ketzerei im ältesten Christentum.&quot; Bauer&#x27;s thesis is that &quot;the heretics probably outnumbered the orthodox&quot; in the early Christian world and that heresy and orthodoxy were not as narrowly defined as we now define them. He was &quot;convinced that none of the Apostolic Fathers had relied on the authority of the Fourth Gospel. It was the gnostics, the Marcionites, and the Montanists who first used it and introduced it to the Christian community.&quot;

===John the Apostle===
Most scholars claim that the apostle John, son of Zebedee, wrote none of the Johannine works, including the Gospel of John Various objections to John the Apostle&#x27;s authorship have been raised: 
* The Synoptic Gospels are united in identifying John as a fisherman from Galilee, and refers to John as &quot;without learning&quot; or &quot;unlettered&quot;.
** The Fourth Gospel is written by someone who, based on their style and knowledge of the Greek language and grammar, would have to have been well-educated in Greek; on the other hand, as an uneducated illiterate Galilean fisherman, John the Apostle would most likely have had Aramaic as his native language, and no knowledge of any other language, let alone the ability to write in the sophisticated Greek of the Fourth Gospel.
** The Fourth Gospel emphasises Judea, and the author seems to have had advanced knowledge of Judean topography, so likely came from there; on the other hand, John the Apostle came from Galilee.
** The Fourth Gospel is a highly intellectual account of Jesus&#x27; life and is familiar with Rabbinic traditions of biblical interpretation.

A minority of scholars, mostly Anglo-American ones, continue to support John the Apostle as the author of the Fourth Gospel. In favor of the historical and eyewitness character of the Gospel, a few passages are cited. John&#x27;s chronology for the death of Jesus seems more realistic, because the Synoptic Gospels would have the trial before the Sanhedrin occurring on the first day of the Passover, which was a day of rest.

The question remains why the anonymously written Fourth Gospel was eventually given the title &#x27;the Gospel of John&#x27; (or &#x27;the Gospel according to John&#x27;), especially because John, son of Zebedee is never even mentioned in the Fourth Gospel. This may be due to the fact that John, son of Zebedee, who is one of the most important apostles in the Synoptic Gospels, would otherwise be entirely missing in the Fourth Gospel. However, critical scholars have suggested some other possibilities, as it was common at the time to forge documents in someone else&#x27;s name, or attribute anonymous works already in circulation to a famous person, for credibility.

===The beloved disciple===

The phrase &quot;the disciple whom Jesus loved&quot; (, &quot;ho mathētēs hon ēgapā ho Iēsous&quot;) or, in John 20:2, the disciple beloved of Jesus (, &quot;hon ephilei ho Iēsous&quot;) is used six times in the Gospel of John, but in no other New Testament accounts of Jesus. states that the Gospel of John is based on the written testimony of this disciple. Although since the 2nd century some people have taken verse 21:24 to mean that the author of the Gospel of John himself was the eyewitness (namely the disciple whom Jesus loved), other scholars point out that verse 21:24 indicates that the author is someone else than this disciple, because he&#x27;s speaking about himself in the first person plural (&#x27;we know&#x27;) and the disciple in the third person (&#x27;the disciple... who has written all these things&#x27;). Therefore, the author merely claims to have used an earlier written report, allegedly from this disciple, as a source for writing the Fourth Gospel. Even if the beloved disciple is to be accepted as the author of the Fourth Gospel, however, this still leaves open the question of what the identity of this beloved disciple was.

Hugh J. Schonfield, in the controversial &quot;The Passover Plot&quot; (1965) and other works, saw evidence that the source of this Gospel was the Beloved Disciple of the Last Supper and further that this person, perhaps named John, was a senior Temple priest and so probably a member of the Sanhedrin. This would account for the knowledge of and access to the Temple which would not have been available to rough fishermen and followers of a disruptive rural preacher from the Galilee, one who was being accused of heresy besides, and probably for the evanescent presence of the Beloved Disciple in the events of Jesus&#x27; Ministry. On this reading, the Gospel was perhaps written by a student and follower of this disciple in his last years, perhaps at Patmos. Schonfield agrees that the Gospel was the product of the Apostle&#x27;s great age, but further identifies him as the Beloved Disciple of the Last Supper, and so believes that the Gospel is based on first hand witness, though decades later and perhaps through the assistance of a younger follower and writer, which may account for the mixture of Hebraicisms (from the Disciple) and Greek idiom (from the assistant).

==== Identification with John the Apostle ====
Possibly since the end of the first century, the Beloved Disciple has been commonly identified with John the Evangelist. In his early-4th-century &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;, Eusebius wrote &#x27;the apostle and evangelist John, the one whom Jesus loved...&#x27;. Objections are raised against the identification of John the Apostle with the &quot;disciple whom Jesus loved&quot;, because the latter is not mentioned before the Last Supper. The title (&quot;beloved disciple&quot;) is also strange to George Beasley-Murray because &quot;if the beloved disciple were one of the Twelve, he would have been sufficiently known outside the Johannine circle of churches for the author to have named him&quot;.

==== Identifications with others ====
Parker suggested that this disciple might be John Mark; nonetheless, the Acts of the Apostles indicate that John Mark was very young and a late-comer as a disciple. J. Colson suggested that &quot;John&quot; was a priest in Jerusalem, explaining the alleged priestly mentality in the fourth gospel. R. Schnackenburg suggested that &quot;John&quot; was an otherwise unknown resident of Jerusalem who was in Jesus&#x27; circle of friends. The &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot; and the &quot;Gospel of Mary&quot; identify Mary Magdalene as the disciple whom Jesus loved, a connection that has been analyzed by Esther de Boer and made notorious in the fictional &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Finally, a few authors, such as Loisy and Bultmann and Hans-Martin Schenke, see &quot;the Beloved Disciple&quot; as a purely symbolic creation, an idealized pseudonym for the group of authors.

Filson, Sanders, Vernard Eller, Rudolf Steiner, and Ben Witherington suggest Lazarus, since and specifically indicates that Jesus &quot;loved&quot; him.

===Johannine community===

While evidence regarding the author is slight, some scholars believe this gospel developed from a school or Johannine circle working at the end of the 1st century, possibly in Ephesus. This hypothetical group of writers has been termed the Johannine community.

Raymond E. Brown, among others, posit a community of writers rather than a single individual that gave final form to the work. In particular, Chapter 21 is very stylistically different from the main body of the Gospel, and is thought to be a later addition (known as the &quot;appendix&quot;). Among many Christian scholars the view has evolved that there were multiple stages of development involving the disciples as well as the apostle; Brown (1970) distinguishes four stages of development: traditions connected directly with the apostle, partial editing by his disciples, synthesis by the apostle, and additions by a final editor. At the very least, it seems clear that in chapter 21 someone else speaks in the first person plural (&quot;we&quot;), ostensibly as the voice of a community that believes the testimony of this other person called the &quot;beloved disciple&quot; to be true.

More recently, scholars including Adele Reinhartz and Robert Kysar have challenged the idea of a Johannine community and cite the lack of evidence for such a community.

===Possible Gnostic origins===

Criticism in the early 20th century centered on the idea of the &quot;Logos&quot; (&quot;word&quot;), which was perceived as a Hellenistic concept. Thus H. J. Holtzmann hypothesized a dependence of the work on Philo Judaeus; Albert Schweitzer considered the work to be a Hellenized version of Pauline mysticism, while R. Reitzenstein sought the work&#x27;s origin in Egyptian and Persian mystery religions.

Rudolf Bultmann took a different approach to the work. He hypothesized a Gnostic origin (specifically Mandaeanism which maintains that Jesus was a mšiha kdaba or &quot;false prophet,&quot;) for the work. He noted similarities with the Pauline corpus, but attributed this to a common Hellenistic background. He claimed that the many contrasts in the Gospel, between light and darkness, truth and lies, above and below, and so on, show a tendency toward dualism, explained by the Gnostic roots of the work. Despite the Gnostic origin, Bultmann commended the author for several improvements over Gnosticism, such as the Judeo-Christian view of creation and the demythologizing of the role of the Redeemer. He saw the Gospel as an investigation into a God who was wholly Other and transcendent, seeing no place in the vision of the author for a Church or sacraments.

Bultmann&#x27;s analysis is still widely applied in German-speaking countries, although with many corrections and discussions. Wide-ranging replies have been made to this analysis. Today, most Christian exegetes reject much of Bultmann&#x27;s theory, but accept certain of his intuitions. For instance, J. Blank uses Bultmann in his discussion of the Last Judgment and W. Thüsing uses him to discuss the elevation and glorification of Jesus. In the English-speaking world, Bultmann has had less impact. Instead, these scholars tended to continue in the investigation of the Hellenistic and Platonistic theories, generally returning to theories closer to the traditional interpretation. By way of example, G.H.C. McGregor (1928) and W.F. Howard (1943) belong to this group.

The discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in Qumran (1946/47–1956) marked a change in Johannine scholarship. Several of the hymns, presumed to come from a community of Essenes, contained the same sort of plays between opposites – light and dark, truth and lies – which are themes within the Gospel. Thus the hypothesis that the Gospel relied on Gnosticism fell out of favor. Many suggested further that John the Baptist himself belonged to an Essene community, and if John the Apostle had previously been a disciple of the Baptist, he would have been affected by that teaching.

The resulting revolution in Johannine scholarship was termed the &quot;new look&quot; by John A. T. Robinson, who coined the phrase in 1957 at Oxford. According to Robinson, this new information rendered the question of authorship a relative one. He considered a group of disciples around the aging John the Apostle who wrote down his memories, mixing them with theological speculation, a model that had been proposed as far back as Renan&#x27;s &quot;Vie de Jésus&quot; (&quot;Life of Jesus,&quot; 1863). The work of such scholars brought the consensus back to a Palestinian origin for the text, rather than the Hellenistic origin favored by the critics of the previous decades.

Gnosticism scholar Elaine Pagels claimed in 2003 that the author of the Fourth Gospel was a Gnostic, citing similarities with the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot; and the &quot;Gospel of Philip&quot;. According to Gnosticism scholar Pagels, &quot;Qumran fever&quot; that was raised by the discovery of the Scrolls was gradually dying down, with theories of Gnostic influences in the Johannine works beginning to be proposed again, especially in Germany. Some recent views have seen the theology of Johannine works as directly opposing &quot;Thomas Christians&quot;. Most scholars, however, consider the Gnosticism question closed.

==Epistles of John==
Most scholars agree that all three letters are written by the same author, although there is debate on who that author is. These three epistles are similar in terminology, style, and general situation. They are loosely associated with the Gospel of John and may result from that gospel&#x27;s theology. Internal evidence as well as commentary by Papias and Polycarp suggest that the Johannine epistles originated in Asia Minor. Early references to the epistles, the organization of the church apparent in the text, and the lack of reference to persecution suggests that they were written early in the 2nd century.

===First epistle===
The phraseology of the first letter of John is very similar to that of the fourth gospel, so the question of its authorship is often connected to the question of authorship of the gospel. The two works use many of the same characteristic words and phrases, such as &quot;light&quot;, &quot;darkness&quot;, &quot;life&quot;, &quot;truth&quot;, &quot;a new commandment&quot;, &quot;to be of the truth&quot;, &quot;to do the truth&quot; and &quot;only begotten son&quot;. In both works, the same basic concepts are explored: the Word, the incarnation, the passing from death to life, the truth and lies, etc. The two works also bear many stylistic affinities to one another. In the words of Amos Wilder, the works share &quot;a combination of simplicity and elevation which differs from the flexible discourse of Paul and from the more concrete vocabulary and formal features of the Synoptic Gospels.&quot;

Given the similarity with the Gospel, the &quot;great majority&quot; (as of 1957) of critical scholars assign the same authorship to the epistle that they assign to the Gospel. At the end of the 19th century, scholar Ernest DeWitt Burton was able to write that, &quot;the similarity in style, vocabulary and doctrine to the fourth gospel is, however, so clearly marked that there can be no reasonable doubt that the letter and the gospel are from the same pen.&quot; Starting with Heinrich Julius Holtzmann, however, and continuing with C. H. Dodd, some scholars have maintained that the epistle and the gospel were written by different authors. There are at least two principal arguments for this view. The first is that the epistle often uses a demonstrative pronoun at the beginning of a sentence, then a particle or conjunction, followed by an explanation or definition of the demonstrative at the end of the sentence, a stylistic technique which is not used in the gospel. The second is that the author of the epistle, &quot;uses the conditional sentence in a variety of rhetorical figures which are unknown to the gospel.&quot;

The book was not among those whose canonicity was in doubt, according to Eusebius; however, it is not included in an ancient Syrian canon. Theodore of Mopsuestia also presented a negative opinion toward its canonicity. Outside of the Syrian world, however, the book has many early witnesses, and appears to have been widely accepted.

The First Epistle of John assumes knowledge of the Gospel of John, and some scholars think that the epistle&#x27;s author might have been the one who redacted the gospel.

===Second and third epistles===
Irenaeus, in the late second-century, quotes from 1st and 2nd John, and states that he is quoting the Apostle John. Eusebius claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not John the Apostle but actually John the Elder, due to the introductions of the epistles. However, modern scholars have argued that Eusebius made this conclusion based on a misinterpretation of a statement from Papias and a desire to invent a second John to be the author of Revelation. Carson suggests that the vocabulary, structure, and grammar of the Gospel of John is remarkably similar to 1st John, 2nd John and 3rd John.

==Book of Revelation==

The author of the Book of Revelation identifies himself as &quot;John&quot;. The book has been traditionally credited to John the Apostle. Reference to the apostle&#x27;s authorship is found as early as Justin Martyr, in his &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;. Other early witnesses to this tradition are Papias, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, Cyprian, and Hippolytus. This identification, however, was denied by other Fathers, including Dionysius of Alexandria, Eusebius of Caesarea, Cyril of Jerusalem, Gregory Nazianzen, and John Chrysostom. The Apocryphon of John, a Gnostic work, claims John as both the author of itself and Revelation.

A work of Epiphanius of Salamis records a Presbyter of Rome named Gaius who fiercely condemns Cerinthus, a Gnostic, and accuses Cerinthus of &quot;lyingly introducing portents to us, supposedly shown him by angels, saying that after the resurrection the kingdom of Christ will be on earth and that again the flesh dwelling in Jerusalem will be the subject of desires and pleasures. And being an enemy of the Scriptures of God and wishing to deceive, he says the period of the marriage feast will be a thousand years.&quot; This is considered to probably be a reference to Revelation and an accusation that Cerinthus was its true author.

In the 3rd century, Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria rejected apostolic authorship but accepted the book&#x27;s canonicity. Dionysius believed that the author was another man also named John, John the Presbyter, teacher of Papias, bishop of Hieropolis. Eusebius of Caesarea later agreed with this. Eusebius records Dionysius of reporting that in his day, those who disagreed with the authority of the book cited the argument that Cerinthus was the true author. It goes into more detail, saying that in this view, Cerinthus was a libertine who was a &quot;lover of the body and quite carnal&quot;, and he wrote the book as wish fulfillment wherein the saints would enjoy similar fleshly pleasures in the future. Because apostolic authorship was one of several considerations for canonization, several Church Fathers and the Council of Laodicea rejected Revelation.

Mainstream scholars conclude that the author did not also write the Gospel of John because of wide differences in eschatology, language, and tone. The Book of Revelation contains grammatical errors and stylistic abnormalities whereas the Gospel and Epistles are all stylistically consistent which indicate its author may not have been as familiar with the Greek language as the Gospel/Epistles&#x27;s author. Contemporary scholars note that when Revelation and the Gospel refer to Jesus as &quot;lamb&quot; they use different Greek words, and they spell &quot;Jerusalem&quot; differently. There are differing motifs between the book and the Gospel: use of allegory, symbolism, and similar metaphors, such as &quot;living water&quot;, &quot;shepherd&quot;, &quot;lamb&quot;, and &quot;manna&quot;. The Book of Revelation does not go into several typically Johannine themes, such as light, darkness, truth, love, and &quot;the world&quot; in a negative sense. The eschatology of the two works are also very different. Still, the author uses the terms &quot;Word of God&quot; and &quot;Lamb of God&quot; for Jesus Christ, possibly indicating that the author had a common theological background with the author of John.

Another issue arguing against authorship by John the Apostle is that &quot;the apostles&quot; are occasionally mentioned within the work, yet the author never indicates that he is one. Revelation 4 describes a vision of twenty-four elders seated on twenty-four thrones, which is generally assumed to be a reference to Jesus&#x27;s promise that the twelve disciples would be seated on thrones and judge the Twelve Tribes of Israel (; ). Yet, if the identification of the twenty-four elders as the disciples and the Patriarchs of the twelve tribes is accurate, the author does not mention seeing himself among the elders.

According to the testimony of Irenaeus, Eusebius, and Jerome, the writing of this book took place near the very end of Domitian&#x27;s reign, around 95 or 96.

<text>Kirk Alyn (born John Feggo Jr.; October 8, 1910 – March 14, 1999) was an American actor, best known for being the first actor to play the DC Comics character Superman in live-action for the 1948 movie serial &quot;Superman&quot; and its 1950 sequel &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot;, as well as fellow DC Comics characters Blackhawk from the &quot;Blackhawk&quot; movie serial in 1952, and Lois Lane&#x27;s father Sam Lane in 1978&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot;.

==Early life==
Kirk Alyn was born as John Feggo Jr. on October 8, 1910, in Oxford, New Jersey, to working class parents from Austria-Hungary. In his youth he lived in Wharton, New Jersey. A plaque commemorating his life in the borough is hung in the municipal building.

==Career==
Alyn started as a chorus boy for Broadway plays, appearing in notable musicals such as &quot;Girl Crazy&quot;, &quot;Of Thee I Sing&quot;, and &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot; during the 1930s.
He also worked as a singer and dancer in vaudeville before relocating to Hollywood during the early 1940s to act for feature movies, but he was successful only in gaining bit parts for low-budget movies before obtaining the role of Superman in 1948. During World War II, he served in the United States Navy.

Alyn also featured in movie serials, including &quot;Federal Agents Vs. Underworld Inc.&quot; (1948), &quot;Radar Patrol Vs. Spy King&quot; (1950) and &quot;Blackhawk&quot; (1952).

Alyn recalls the day producer Sam Katzman asked him to play Superman:
I thought it was a publicity stunt. I didn&#x27;t think you could ever put Superman on film. They brought the people from D.C. Comics over and they said, &#x27;Hey, he looks just like Clark Kent.&#x27; They said take off your shirt, so I did and flexed my muscles. Then the guy said, &#x27;Take off your pants&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Wait a minute.&#x27; I was 37 when I played Superman. I picked up that girl and ran up that flight of stairs like it was nothing.&quot;
Alyn played Superman for the first live-action &quot;Superman&quot; movie serial, released in 1948. The serial consisted of 15 episodes which recounted Superman&#x27;s arrival on Earth, getting a job as a reporter at the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; newspaper, and meeting Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. The main plot consisted of Superman&#x27;s battle against the arch criminal the Spider Lady.

Two years later, &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; was released, featuring Lyle Talbot as Superman&#x27;s arch-villain Lex Luthor. This serial also included a sequence involving an eerie alternate dimension, not unlike the Phantom Zone, which would not appear in the comics for another 11 years.

Alyn gave the &quot;Man of Steel&quot; a different portrayal to Clark Kent, adding to the element of disguise. This was in the tradition of radio&#x27;s Superman, Bud Collyer. By contrast, his successor George Reeves played the dual roles more alike, as pointed out in Gary Grossman&#x27;s book, &quot;Superman: Serial to Cereal&quot;. The character&#x27;s flight was affected by having Alyn jump up, at which point he becomes represented by an animated character by way of rotoscoping, which flew away. Alyn had tried &quot;flying&quot; while suspended by hidden wires for the first serial but the wires turned out to be clearly visible and that footage was scrapped.)

After playing Superman, he again suffered casting problems. Apart from featuring in some similar comic book-type serials, he had few roles in television series and movies, some even uncredited, until he retired.

Alyn was reportedly offered the part of Superman for the television version of 1951, but refused it. In 1971, he published an autobiography entitled &quot;A Job for Superman&quot;.

Alyn shared a very brief cameo with his serial co-star, Noel Neill, as Sam and Ellen Lane, the parents of the young Lois Lane for the 1978 feature movie, &quot;Superman&quot;. In a brief on-set interview, he explains his method of portraying Superman and Clark Kent, contained in a documentary narrated by Ernie Anderson, &quot;The Making of Superman: The Movie&quot; (1978).

In 1981, Alyn appeared as &quot;Pa Cant&quot; in the parody movie &quot;Superbman: The Other Movie&quot;, a role that lasted only seconds, as Cant dies from heart failure immediately after discovering the strange visitor from the planet &quot;Krapton&quot;.

Alyn made his final movie, the horror movie &quot;Scalps&quot;, in 1983.

In 1988, he participated in the 1988 TV special &quot;Superman 50th Anniversary Special&quot; as himself. He also had a very brief appearance in a &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; episode.

==Personal life==
When he first went to Hollywood, Alyn met another performer, singer, dancer, and actress Virginia O&#x27;Brien. They were married in 1942, and had three children: daughters Terri O&#x27;Brien and Elizabeth Watkins and son John Feggo III. They were divorced in 1955.

==Death==
Alyn died on March 14, 1999, in The Woodlands, Texas, at the age of 88 from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He was cremated. His ashes were scattered off the coast of California.

==Honors==
Alyn was the Grand Marshal of the Metropolis, Illinois Christmas parade and Annual Superman Celebrations several times. In 1985, DC Comics named Alyn as one of the honorees in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.

Alyn received the Inkpot Award in 1974.

FC Seoul have won six K League titles, two FA Cups, two League Cups and one Super Cup. Internationally, the club reached the AFC Champions League final on two occasions, in 2001–02 and 2013.

FC Seoul is one of the most successful and popular clubs in the K League 1, with financial backing from the GS Group. In 2012, the club was evaluated as the most valuable football brand in the K League. Their main rivals are Suwon Samsung Bluewings, with whom they contest the Super Match.

==History==
===Founding and early years (1983–1989)===

FC Seoul was officially announced on 18 August as the new club and founded on 22 December 1983, and started out in 1984 as Lucky-Goldstar Football Club, owned and financially supported by the Lucky-Goldstar Group (later renamed the LG Group), with the Chungcheong Province its franchise and Hwangso (meaning bull) as its mascot.

In order to launch the professional football club, Lucky-Goldstar Group had a preparation period from 1982 and demanded that the original franchise should be Seoul. In the 1984 season, the club finished seventh out of the eight clubs. The club fared better in the 1985 season when they won the championship with the help of Thailand national football team player Piyapong Pue-on, who was the top scorer, as well as the top assistor.

===Moving to Seoul and then to Anyang (1990–2003)===
From the beginning of 1988, Lucky-Goldstar Hwangso pushed forward a relocation to Seoul At the end of the 1989 season, the Korea Professional Football League (renamed as the K League in 1998), worried about the financial stability of the clubs, invited a number of clubs to play in Seoul. Thus, the Lucky-Goldstar Hwangso, which had always wanted to be based in the capital, moved to Seoul Stadium (Currently Dongdaemun Stadium) in Seoul at the end of 1989. 
The club finished first season in Seoul as champions. The club changed its name to LG Cheetahs in 1991 to mirror the LG Twins, a professional baseball team also owned by LG Group. After several seasons in Seoul, the club was forced to move in 1996, as part of the K League&#x27;s decentralization policy. This policy was carried out to stimulate the growth of football in the provinces. In addition, in 1995, Korea was bidding to host the 2002 FIFA World Cup. This warranted the construction of a soccer-specific stadium in Seoul. The three clubs based in Seoul – LG Cheetahs, Ilhwa Chunma, and Yukong Elephants did not want to recognize the decentralization policy. Ultimately, it proved necessary for the Korean government to issue an eviction order to the disaffected clubs. However, the government did guarantee if the clubs built a soccer-specific stadium in Seoul, the clubs could have a Seoul franchise and return to Seoul.

As a result, 3 clubs were evicted from Seoul to other cities. This entailed the move of the LG Cheetahs to the Anyang Sports Complex in the city of Anyang, a satellite city of Seoul, 21 km away. The club was now known as the Anyang LG Cheetahs. In the upcoming years, a solid base of supporters was formed, and it established a strong league rivalry with the Suwon Samsung Bluewings. This rivalry was partly fueled by the fact that LG Group and Samsung Group, which owned the Suwon club, were also considered rivals in the business world, especially in electronics. The club continued to grow and in 2000, they won their third Championship, behind the firepower of striker Choi Yong-Soo.

===Return to Seoul and renaming to FC Seoul (2004–2006)===
For the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, ten brand new stadiums of World Cup standards were built in South Korea. After the World Cup, the Korean World Cup Organizing Committee and the KFA actively supported the move of regional K League clubs into the new stadia. This was designed to avoid or at least minimize any financial losses through having to maintain a stadium in playing condition without regular income. However, due to the previous decision by the K League to exclude any member club from being based in Seoul, Seoul World Cup Stadium remained vacant, except as a host of some international friendlies. Thus, the city government of Seoul and the KFA both actively sought for a K League club to play at the stadium to take on the cost of maintaining the stadium. Initially, it was intended to create a new club, but when it later transpired that any club playing in Seoul World Cup Stadium would have to pay partially for the construction fees of the stadium, this would have placed an unreasonable burden on a fledgling club. Thus, the KFA tried to lure one of the current clubs to Seoul. The Anyang LG Cheetahs, with the financial backing of the LG Group, who not only viewed the move back to Seoul as a way to increase its advertising presence, but had the right to come back to Seoul because it had its franchise moved by force in 1996, as part of the K League&#x27;s decentralization policy. Anyang LG announced in February 2004 that it would pay the share of the construction fees (which turned out to be 15 billion won, or at that time US$15 million). This proposed move provoked a significant amount of controversy from the Korean football fans as KFA and K League failed to launch a new football club based in Seoul due to a high Seoul franchise fee. Regardless, KFA and K League ultimately permitted relocation of Anyang LG Cheetahs.

===Şenol Güneş years (2007–2009)===

Şenol Güneş managed FC Seoul for a three-year period starting on December 8, 2006. The club started the 2007 season with three consecutive wins and a draw, including a 4–1 win over arch rivals Suwon Samsung Bluewings in the Super Match. However, FC Seoul failed to qualify for the play-off phase of the season, but the club succeeded in getting into the final of the 2007 Korean League Cup. Before the next season, Park Chu-young, the ace of FC Seoul at that time, was transferred to Ligue 1 club Monaco. FC Seoul finished in a second-place in the K League regular season, and progressed to the play-offs. FC Seoul defeated Ulsan Hyundai in the play-off semi-final but was defeated by Suwon Samsung Bluewings in the final. Despite the loss, the club still qualified for the 2009 AFC Champions League. During the season, Dejan Damjanović scored 15 goals.

FC Seoul&#x27;s 2009 AFC Champions League campaign began with a 2–1 win over Indonesian side Sriwijaya FC. In the next three games, FC Seoul obtained only one point in the matches against Gamba Osaka and Shandong Luneng. However, Seoul then defeated the title holders Gamba Osaka and qualified to the round of 16 after Sriwijaya&#x27;s unexpected victory over Shandong Luneng. On June 24, 2009, FC Seoul beat Kashima Antlers 5–4 after penalties after a 0–0 draw in the round of 16 clash and advanced to the quarter-finals, but were beaten 4–3 on aggregate by Qatari club Umm Salal. FC Seoul&#x27;s appearance in the AFC Champions League was its first since the Asian Club Championship era.

The Şenol Güneş era ended on November 25, 2009, with the manager returning to Trabzonspor.

===K League and League Cup &quot;double&quot; (2010)===
FC Seoul appointed Nelo Vingada as manager on December 14, 2009. Vingada won the K League and League Cup with FC Seoul. FC Seoul had 20 wins, 2 draws, and 6 defeats in the domestic league under Vingada&#x27;s management.

FC Seoul recorded an attendance of 60,747 against Seongnam Ilhwa on May 5, 2010, at Seoul World Cup Stadium, which is the highest single-game attendance record in South Korean professional sports history. FC Seoul also recorded the single season (League, K League Championship, and League Cup) highest total attendance record – 546,397, and the single regular &amp; post season (League and K League Championship) highest average attendance record of 32,576.

On August 25, 2010, FC Seoul beat Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors 3–0 to become the 2010 League Cup winners. FC Seoul were also crowned K League champions by defeating Jeju United 4–3 on aggregate in the K League Championship final, thus achieving their first &quot;double&quot; in the club&#x27;s history. The crowd of 56,769 in the second leg also set the record of the highest attendance in K League Championship history.

On December 13, 2010, FC Seoul wanted to extend Vingada&#x27;s one-year contract but FC Seoul and Vingada could not come to an agreement over the salary conditions, resulting in Vingada returning to Portugal.

===AFC Champions League final and the sixth K League title (2011–2016)===

FC Seoul&#x27;s former player Choi Yong-soo was hired to manage the club in 2012, after previously serving as the assistant manager and caretaker for the club in 2011. In 2013, FC Seoul lost the AFC Champions League final on away goals rule against Chinese side Guangzhou Evergrande. The AFC Champions League campaign has earned Choi Yong-soo the 2013 AFC Coach of the Year award, becoming the second South Korean in succession to win the individual accolade following the previous year&#x27;s winner Kim Ho-kon. Choi left the club in June 2016.

On June 21, 2016, FC Seoul appointed Hwang Sun-hong as their eleventh manager in the club&#x27;s history. On November 6, 2016, FC Seoul won their sixth K League title after defeating Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors 1–0 in the final round of the season.

=== A period of oscillation (2017–present) ===

Hwang Sun-hong resigned on April 30, 2018. In the 2018 season, FC Seoul finished in eleventh place and had to play the K League promotion-relegation playoffs for the first time in their history. In the playoffs, they defeated Busan IPark 4–2 on aggregate, thus staying in the top flight.

On October 11, 2018, Choi Yong-soo was appointed as the twelfth manager in the club&#x27;s history, having previously managed the club between 2011 and 2016.

During the 2020 season, FC Seoul lost five consecutive games for the first time in 22 years. Following a new departure by Choi Yong-soo, three different caretakers took turns managing the team, with Park Hyuk-soon replacing Kim Ho-young after just a month and guiding the team to the end of the K League season, which they finished in ninth place, before being substituted by Lee Won-jun; under his management, the team made a promising start in the group stage of the 2020 AFC Champions League, even obtaining a 5–0 victory against Thai outfit Chiangrai United, but then proceeded to lose all of their last three matches, thus being eliminated from the tournament. A difficult season was made even more devastating by the death of defender Kim Nam-chun on October 30, 2020, just a day before their last K League 1 fixture against Incheon United.

In the 2024 K League 1 season, the club broke average attendance records due to a recovery of the league itself and the signing of Jesse Lingard, as the club finished in the top half of K League 1 for the first time since 2019. Lingard was appointed captain ahead of the 2025 season.

==Club culture==
===Supporters===
FC Seoul has a diverse fanbase, including former Lucky-Goldstar fans, LG Cheetahs fans, and Anyang LG Cheetahs fans. The club&#x27;s number 12 shirt is reserved for supporters of the club. The main supporters group of FC Seoul is called Suhoshin (meaning &quot;guardian deity&quot;), formed in April 2004. There are also some smaller fan groups.

=== Rivalries ===
The club&#x27;s main rivalry is with Suwon Samsung Bluewings in a derby known as the Super Match, as two of the most successful teams in the Seoul Capital Area. The rivalry began during the Anyang LG Cheetahs era and has continued as the club was relocated to Seoul.

Other major rivalries include Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors (Jeonseol Match) and Incheon United (Gyeongin Derby). In an away match versus Incheon in May 2024, the home fans at the Incheon Football Stadium threw water bottles at Seoul players.

Fans of FC Anyang, a phoenix club that was founded in Anyang since the departure of Anyang LG Cheetahs, feel great animosity towards FC Seoul and a willingness to get their revenge on the pitch, with Anyang&#x27;s fans lighting flares in a show of defiance in a 2017 Korean FA Cup match versus FC Seoul. Anyang&#x27;s first-ever appearance in the 2025 K League 1 season allowed them to play against FC Seoul in a league match for the first time in the &quot;Relocation Derby.&quot;

===V-Girls and V-Man===
V-Girls &amp; V-Man are FC Seoul&#x27;s cheerleaders. The V stands for victory. They cheerlead at the East Stand.

==Stadiums==

Since 2004, FC Seoul&#x27;s home is the Seoul World Cup Stadium, which is the largest football-specific stadium in South Korea. FC Seoul&#x27;s players train at the GS Champions Park training center, a purpose-built facility completed in 1989, located east of Seoul in the city of Guri.

In the past, FC Seoul played at Daejeon Stadium, Cheongju Civic Stadium, Cheonan Oryong Stadium (1987–1989), Dongdaemun Stadium (1990–1995), and Anyang Stadium (1996–2003).

==Crests and mascots==
FC Seoul has had different names, and consequently different crests for different periods of the club: Lucky-Goldstar FC (1983–1990), LG Cheetahs (1991–1995), Anyang LG Cheetahs (1996–2003).

There has also been different club mascots representing different periods. Former mascots were a bull and a cheetah. The club&#x27;s current mascot, introduced in 2004, is named &quot;SSID&quot;.

The &quot;SSID&quot; stands for Seoul &amp; Sun In Dream. In the 2018 season, FC Seoul added another mascot, &quot;Seoul-i&quot;.

A special crest for the club&#x27;s 20th anniversary was used in 2003. The current crest has been used since 2004.

== Kits ==
FC Seoul&#x27;s home kits have red and black stripes, as in their crest.

FC Seoul wore both red kits and yellow kits in home matches from 1984 to 1985.

From 1988 to 1994, the club&#x27;s home shirt&#x27;s main colour was yellow, same as the Lucky-Goldstar Group&#x27;s company colour at the time.

In 1995, Lucky-Goldstar Group pushed ahead with corporate identity unification and the company colour was changed to red. As a result, FC Seoul&#x27;s jersey colour was changed from yellow to red as part of the unification project.

From 1999 to 2001, FC Seoul wore red and blue stripes but returned to all red in the 2002 season and In 2005, FC Seoul changed to red and black stripes and this colour has been in use since.

In June 2016, FC Seoul released the 1984–1985 retro jersey to commemorate foundation of the club and the first K League title.

<text>Sir Robert Philp, (28 December 1851 – 17 June 1922) was a Queensland businessman and politician who was Premier of Queensland from December 1899 to September 1903 and again from November 1907 to February 1908.

==Early life==
Philp was born in Glasgow, Scotland, the second son of John Philp, a lime-kiln operator, and Mary Ann Philp (&quot;née&quot; Wylie). He emigrated to Brisbane with his parents and siblings in 1862, where his father took a lease on the municipal baths, and later became involved in the cattle and sugar industries. Philp was educated at the National (Normal) School until 1863 when he started work at Bright Bros &amp; Co shipping company, before moving to Townsville in 1874 to take up the position of junior partner in the trading company Burns, Philp and Company.

Burns, Philp &amp; Co acted as agents and provisioners for the sugar cane and pastoral industries that sustained Northern Queensland, and Philp served as manager of the Townsville office. Beginning in 1881, Philp diverted some of the company&#x27;s vessels to the labour trade, recruiting South Pacific Islanders (known as Kanakas) to work as indentured labourers on the canefields, despite the reservations of his business partner James Burns. A royal commission into recruiting practices in 1885 coincided with a downturn in the sugar industry, and as a result the company&#x27;s vessels were returned to other commercial operations. While this affair had been profitable for Burns, Philp, it did not contribute significantly to later commercial success, although it would not be Philp&#x27;s last interest in the South Pacific labour trade.

Despite the success of Burns, Philp &amp; Co, Philp made some poor personal investments, such as his loss of £5000 on the &quot;Comet&quot; mine. Like many others he was affected by the economic depression of the 1890s, borrowing £20,000 to purchase property in Brisbane which three years later was valued at only £16,230. He also owed considerable sums of money to the North Queensland Mortgage &amp; Investment Co., as well as holding a £5000 mortgage with respect to other properties. Although Burns tried to assist him, Philp was forced to sell his shares in Burns, Philp &amp; Co in 1893, and was still in financial difficulty as late as 1898, although by this stage he had restricted his business ventures to more conservative investments.

When the business-friendly McIlwraith government lost office in 1883 it was succeeded by the Liberal government of Samuel Griffith that sought to end the trade in Kanakas. As a prominent businessman who had served several times on the local council Philp was active in bankrolling and supporting candidates in opposition to Griffith. He supported the growing movement for the separation of North Queensland from the rest of the colony.

==Early parliamentary career==
Philp entered the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in 1886 as Member for Musgrave. He supported the North Queensland separatists in their unsuccessful attempts to gain independence, but spent most of his early parliamentary career preoccupied with his business affairs. His seat of Musgrave was abolished and in 1888 he was successfully returned as one of the two members for the electorate of Townsville. His parliamentary activity was mainly in support of North Queensland and his business interests – extending railway links to North Queensland, and the abolition of import tariffs. When the import of Pacific islanders was temporarily halted in 1892 Philp was instrumental in securing its resumption.

==Premier and opposition leader==
Philp was a prolific speculator and in 1893 he was forced by debt to resign from the board of directors of Burns, Philp. In May of the same year McIlwraith, now governing in coalition with Griffith in what was known as the &quot;Continuous Ministry&quot;, appointed Philp as Minister for Mines. He held several other ministerial posts, such as Public Instruction, Railways, Public Works and Treasurer until 1899. when the Continuous Ministry was briefly unseated by the Labor government of Anderson Dawson. Philp was an able administrator. He codified mining regulations and encouraged the private development of railways throughout the colony. The railway construction process was alleged to be corrupt by the Labor members, and after narrowly winning a vote of confidence in November 1899 James Dickson resigned as Premier. Dawson&#x27;s government lasted a week before losing Parliamentary support and Philp, despite his protestations in support of Dickson, was chosen as Premier by his colleagues.

The Australian colonies federated in 1901 and the new prime minister Edmund Barton immediately ended the trade in Kanakas. By this stage Queensland was severely depleted in revenue, and Federation exacerbated this situation by depriving Queensland of excise and customs funds. Despite a severe drought and the dire state of the state&#x27;s finances, Philp was re-elected in 1902. Discontent brewed among Ministerialists who were bitter at missing out on Cabinet positions, and in August 1903 Digby Denham crossed the floor with supporters to bring down the government and form a coalition led by Arthur Morgan.

Philp, with his genial nature, was ill-suited to the position of Opposition Leader, and showed little enthusiasm in attacking the new government. Morgan briefly lost control of the Legislative Assembly in 1904 and Philp was called upon by Governor Sir Herbert Chermside to form a ministry, but could not secure sufficient support from among his colleagues. The end result was a dissolution of Parliament and a solid defeat of the Opposition. Philp resumed his position as Leader and his conciliatory treatment of the government continued when fellow Scot William Kidston became Premier. Philp cultivated good relations with Kidston and helped foster the increasing gap between Kidston and the Labor movement.

Philp&#x27;s party was again unsuccessful in the elections of 1907. Kidston was encountering difficulties in securing the passage of his legislation through the intransigent Legislative Council and after Lord Chelmsford as Governor refused Kidston&#x27;s request to appoint sufficient new councillors so as to give Kidston a majority, he resigned in November. Lord Chelmsford commissioned Philp as Premier, but, unable to entice any of Kidston&#x27;s supporters to his cause, he remained without a majority in the Legislative Assembly, which promptly blocked supply. Over Kidston&#x27;s protests, Lord Chelmsford guaranteed supply through the issuing of writs and then dissolved the Assembly, but Philp failed to win the subsequent election.

In 1908 Kidston, alienated from the Labor party, relied on Philp&#x27;s support to pass legislation approving construction of private railways. By October the two leaders had sufficient in common that they negotiated a merger of their two parties, ending Philp&#x27;s career as opposition leader.

==Later life==
Philp remained in parliament, and also returned to tending his business interests. He enjoyed the status that his long parliamentary career gave him and participated in the foundation of the University of Queensland in 1912. He was a member of the University&#x27;s first Senate, and its representative at a conference of universities in Glasgow in 1912. Philp lost his seat by a small margin in the Labor landslide of 1915 but remained active in politics, campaigning for the conscription referendums of the First World War and leading the resistance to the abolition of the Legislative Council. In 1920 he led a delegation to London which thwarted Premier Ted Theodore&#x27;s attempts to gain loans from London financiers to fund government expenditure.

On 17 June 1922 he died in Brisbane and was buried at Toowong Cemetery.

== Family ==
Philp married Jessie Banister Campbell (daughter of prominent Brisbane businessman James Campbell) in 1878; she died in 1890. In 1898 he married Wilhelmina Fraser Munro; she died in 1940

==History==

In 1997, Joseph Farah created the news website WorldNetDaily as a division of the Western Journalism Center. It was subsequently spun off in 1999 as a for-profit organization with the backing of $4.5 million from investors, Farah owning a majority of the stock. The site describes itself as &quot;an independent news company dedicated to uncompromising journalism&quot;. In 1999, WorldNetDaily.com, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware with offices in Cave Junction, Oregon.

The website gained notoriety for stoking false &quot;birther&quot; conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama.

In 2018, Farah wrote about WorldNetDaily″s financial problems, saying it faced an &quot;existential threat&quot;. Farah ceased contributing to the site after his March 12, 2019, column; the site announced a few weeks later that he had suffered a major stroke. In April 2019, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; suffered from declining revenue and diminishing readership. Farah blamed the website&#x27;s financial woes on what he claimed was suppression by powerful technology companies.

In 2019, WorldNetDaily created the WND News Center, a nonprofit organization where its reporting operation would move. The structure is similar to that used by another conservative news website, &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;.

===Application for congressional press credentials (2002)===
Seeking credentials to cover the United States Congress in 2002, WND was opposed by the Standing Committee of Correspondents. This panel of journalists is charged by Congress with administering press credentials. Until 1996, Internet-only publications had been deemed unacceptable. &quot;WND&quot; turned to the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration for help, arguing that the panel&#x27;s decision had violated the site&#x27;s constitutional rights to due process, equal protection, and freedom of the press. Faced &quot;with legal threats and negative publicity, the panel reversed itself, voting 3–2 to award &quot;WND&quot; its credentials&quot;. Shortly after, the rules were formally adjusted to clarify the participation of online publications.

===Ann Coulter speech at Homocon (2010)===
In 2010, when Ann Coulter accepted an invitation to attend and speak at GOProud&#x27;s Homocon 2010 convention, Farah announced the withdrawal of Coulter&#x27;s name from the list of speakers at the company&#x27;s &#x27;Taking America Back&#x27; conference. Coulter responded by saying that speaking engagements do not imply endorsement of the hosting organization.

==Content==
WND provides news, editorials, letters to the editor, forums, videos and conducts a daily poll. Its CEO Joseph Farah has said that &quot;WND&quot; provides &quot;the broadest spectrum of opinion anywhere in the news business&quot;, but acknowledges &quot;some misinformation by columnists&quot;. &quot;WND&quot;&#x27;s content is predominantly conservative. Besides providing articles written by its own staff, the site links to news from other publications.

WND″s political lean has been described as alt-right and far-right. &quot;WND&quot; is known for promoting fake news and conspiracy theories, including the white genocide conspiracy theory and the false claim that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) labels &quot;WND&quot; an anti-government extremist group.

===Anthony C. LoBaido commentary on September 11 attacks (2001)===
On September 13, 2001, &quot;WND&quot; published an opinion article by Anthony C. LoBaido regarding the September 11 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C., that had occurred two days earlier. In his column, LoBaido described what he said was the moral depravity of America in general and New York in particular, asking whether &quot;God (has) raised up Shiite Islam as a sword against America&quot;. Commentators Virginia Postrel of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine and James Taranto of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized LoBaido and Joseph Farah for the piece and called for columnists Hugh Hewitt and Bill O&#x27;Reilly to sever their ties with &quot;WND.&quot; Founder Farah responded with his own column, saying that LoBaido&#x27;s opinion piece did not reflect the viewpoint of &quot;WND&quot;, and that it, like most other commentary pieces, had not been reviewed before publication.

===Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories===
WND has published hundreds of articles promoting &quot;birther&quot; conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama&#x27;s U.S. citizenship, for which it has gained notoriety. It has falsely claimed that Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen and thus is not eligible to serve as president. After the 2008 presidential campaign, WND began an online petition to have Obama&#x27;s Hawaiian birth certificate released to the public and Farah offered a $15,000 award for its release. The website also unsuccessfully urged Supreme Court justices to hear several lawsuits aiming to release Obama&#x27;s birth certificate. The White House released copies of the president&#x27;s original long-form birth certificate on April 27, 2011. After the long-form birth certificate was released, Farah refused to pay the promised award and WND continued to promote its conspiracy theory, publishing an article questioning the certificate&#x27;s authenticity.

===Advertisement featuring Neil Patrick Harris (2013)===
In January 2013, a WorldNetDaily article criticized a Super Bowl XLVII advertisement in which Neil Patrick Harris wore eye black with &quot;Feb 3 2013&quot; written on it. The website accused Harris of &quot;mocking Christianity&quot;. Quarterback Tim Tebow was known for inscribing Bible verses with eye black to wear during NFL games. A similar advertisement by Beyoncé for the Super Bowl had not been criticized. In a later Twitter post by Harris about the Super Bowl, he used the hashtag &quot;#noagenda&quot;.

===Russian interference in US politics===

On August 7, 2017, WorldNetDaily published &quot;The 8 Dirtiest Scandals of Robert Mueller No One Is Talking About&quot;, which was pushed out by Elena Khusyaynova&#x27;s operation, targeting the Mueller investigation.

=== COVID-19 misinformation ===

In April 2020, the SPLC reported that WND &quot;has boosted a number of articles featuring antisemitic dog whistles, fake cures and other disinformation&quot; about COVID-19, with headlines such as &quot;Coronavirus is being weaponized by Soros, others behind anti-Trump ads&quot;, &quot;Clyburn: Democrats must use Chinese virus to restructure America &#x27;to fit our vision&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Newt Gingrich&#x27;s question for Biden exposes Obama&#x27;s undeniable role in N95 mask shortage&quot;. Another headline proclaimed that a three-drug cocktail promoted by Vladimir Zelenko had a &quot;100% success&quot; rate in treating 350 COVID-19 patients.

A 2020 study by researchers from Northeastern, Harvard, Northwestern and Rutgers universities found that &quot;WND&quot; was among the top 5 most shared fake news domains in tweets related to COVID-19, the others being &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, &quot;InfoWars&quot;, Judicial Watch and Natural News.

==Products==
WND publishes books under the imprint &quot;WND Books&quot;. The imprint was launched in 2002. &quot;WND&quot;″s imprint publishing partner was Christian publishing house Thomas Nelson Publishers (2002–2004). Cumberland House Publishing (2004–2007), and conservative publisher World Ahead Publishing (2007). In 2008, &quot;WND&quot; acquired World Ahead Media.

WND Books has published books written by right-wing politicians and pundits such as Katherine Harris, former Secretary of State of Florida in office in 2000 during the presidential election under Governor Jeb Bush; commentator Michael Savage; conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi; ex-congressman Tom Tancredo; and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell. In October 2009, WND Books published &quot;Muslim Mafia: Inside the Secret Underworld That&#x27;s Conspiring to Islamize America&quot; by Paul David Gaubatz and Paul Sperry. In April 2011, Paul Harris, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described &quot;WND Books&quot; as &quot;a niche producer of rightwing conspiracy theories, religious books and &#x27;family values&#x27; tracts&quot;.

WND also publishes a printed magazine, &quot;Whistleblower&quot;. It operates other companies such as the &quot;G2 Bulletin&quot;, a subscription-only website described as an &quot;intelligence resource&quot; for &quot;insights into geo-political and geo-strategic developments&quot;.

The WND website also sells survivalist gear.

== Reception ==
The SPLC has accused WND of &quot;peddling white nationalism&quot;, due to its publication of a series of articles on &quot;black mob violence&quot; by writer Colin Flaherty. It accused the website of being a source of &quot;anti-government conspiracy theories, gay-bashing, anti-Muslim propaganda, and End Times prophecy&quot;.

== Litigation ==
===Clark Jones libel lawsuit (2000–2008)===
On September 20, 2000, WND published an article saying that Clark Jones, a Savannah, Tennessee car dealer, a fund-raiser for then-Vice President Al Gore in his presidential campaign, had interfered with a criminal investigation, had been a &quot;subject&quot; of a criminal investigation, and was listed on law enforcement computers as a &quot;dope dealer&quot;. It implied that he had ties to others involved in alleged criminal activity. The authors later put forward the theory that the publication of this article, as well as other &quot;WND&quot; articles that were critical of Gore, contributed significantly to Gore losing his home state of Tennessee that November.

In 2001, Clark Jones filed a lawsuit against WND; the reporters, Charles C. Thompson II and Tony Hays; the Center for Public Integrity, which had underwritten Thompson and Hays&#x27; reporting on the article and related ones; and various Tennessee publications and broadcasters whom he accused of repeating the claim, arguing these entities had committed libel and defamation. The lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial in March 2008; but, on February 13, 2008, WND announced that a confidential out-of-court settlement had been reached with Jones. A settlement statement jointly drafted by all parties in the lawsuit stated that a Freedom of Information Act request showed that the allegations had been false, and that WND had misquoted sources.

== Staff ==
Notable staff members include Jerusalem Bureau Chief Aaron Klein, former White House correspondent Lester Kinsolving, Ohio State Senate Senior Press Secretary Garth Kant, and staff writer Jerome Corsi. Its commentary pages feature editorials by the site&#x27;s founder Joseph Farah, as well as by commentators including 2016 Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, Pat Buchanan, Ann Coulter, David Limbaugh, Chuck Norris, Walter E. Williams, Ilana Mercer, Bill Press, and Nat Hentoff.

In February 2020, Right Wing Watch reported that Michael J. Thompson, who worked in WND&#x27;s marketing department, had also worked at white nationalist publications such as VDARE and &quot;American Renaissance&quot; under the pseudonym of &quot;Paul Kersey&quot;. It found that his position at &quot;WND&quot; allowed him to move in professional circles that included white nationalists, writers at &quot;Breitbart News&quot; and &quot;The Daily Caller&quot;, and prominent Trump supporters such as Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec.

<doc id="1056353" wikidata="Q5417924" url="?curid=1056353" title="Everything's Different Now">
<text>Everything&#x27;s Different Now is the third and final studio album by the American band &#x27;Til Tuesday, released in 1988.

==Production==
The album was produced primarily by Rhett Davies. &quot;&#x27;J&#x27; for Jules&quot; is about Mann&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Jules Shear. &quot;The Other End (Of the Telescope)&quot; was cowritten by Elvis Costello.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; &quot;the most confessional album since Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot;.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; deemed it &quot;a touching meditation on the ebb and flow of love.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; labeled it a &quot;little masterpiece of melancholy.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Mann never comes off as a bitter whiner... What comes through in these gentle but not too genteel pop songs is a profound sense of, above all, disappointment.&quot;

<doc id="1056354" wikidata="Q2036553" url="?curid=1056354" title="Oswego River (New York)">
<text>The Oswego River () is a river in upstate New York in the United States. It is the second-largest river (after the Niagara River) flowing into Lake Ontario. James Fenimore Cooper’s novel &quot;The Pathfinder, or The Inland Sea&quot; is set in the Oswego River valley.

The name &quot;Oswego&quot; is a Mohawk name that means &quot;flowing out&quot;, or specifically, &quot;small water flowing into that which is large&quot;.

==Description==
James Fenimore Cooper described the Oswego in these words:

The Oswego is formed by the junction of the Oneida and the Onondaga, both of which flow from lakes; and it pursues its way, through a gently undulating country, some eight or ten miles, until it reaches the margin of a sort of natural terrace, down which it tumbles some ten or fifteen feet, to another level, across which it glides with the silent, stealthy progress of deep water, until it throws its tribute into the broad receptacle of the Ontario.
==River course==
The Oswego River starts at the confluence of the Oneida River (flowing from Oneida Lake) and the Seneca River (flowing from Seneca Lake, Cayuga Lake, and Montezuma Marsh). The river drains an area of , as large as the states of Rhode Island and Delaware together, comprising most of the Finger Lakes region of upstate New York.

At its mouth at Lake Ontario, the river divides the City of Oswego, just as it divides the City of Fulton 11 miles upstream.

===Oswego Canal===
Part of its length the Oswego Canal was built. The Oswego River also serves as a part of the New York State Canal System, providing a route from the Erie Canal to Lake Ontario. This section of the canal was completed in 1827, two years after completion of the Erie Canal. In 1917, as part of a general overhaul of the canal system, the Oswego Canal was deepened and refurbished. The canal is now deep and has an overhead clearance of .

==Pollution==
The Oswego River was listed as a Great Lakes Areas of Concern in The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between the United States and Canada until it was formally removed on July 21, 2006.

==Sportfishing==
The river is known for its steelhead run in the early spring, followed by a salmon run in early autumn. The river is stocked annually by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation with 140,000 Chinook salmon and 20,000 steelhead.

<doc id="1056366" wikidata="Q169985" url="?curid=1056366" title="Pohang Steelers">
<text>The Pohang Steelers (Hangul: 포항 스틸러스) are a South Korean professional football club based in Pohang, North Gyeongsang Province that compete in the K League 1, the top flight of South Korean football. The Steelers were founded on 1 April 1973 as POSCO FC, named after the steel company POSCO, which still owns the club today. They are one of South Korea&#x27;s most successful teams, having won the K League five times and the AFC Champions League three times.

==History==
The club was founded on 1 April 1973 as Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Company FC, or simply POSCO FC. Initially a semi-professional club, they turned professional in the 1984 season and changed its name to POSCO Dolphins. A year later they renamed as the POSCO Atoms. In 1986 they won their first Championship, and enjoyed a great spell of domination in the league; between 1985 and 1998 they were continuously in the top four of the K League.

In 1995, the club was renamed again, becoming the Pohang Atoms. This name change was an attempt to further strengthen local ties with the region, and in 1997 they adopted their current name, the Pohang Steelers. The team won the Asian Champions Cup in 1997 and 1998.

In the 2000s, the club struggled near the bottom of the table, but bounced back to the forefront of South Korean football by winning the first stage of the 2004 K League Championship. The club qualified for the final Championship match of the 2004 season, but lost 4–3 on penalties to Suwon Samsung Bluewings.

In 2007, the club won the Championship play-off by beating Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma, who finished in first place in the regular season of the K League. Pohang won the first leg 3–1 at home, and then traveled to Seongnam for the second leg game, recording a 1–0 victory to seal a 4–1 aggregate triumph. The Steelers had ended the K League season in fifth place, but then defeated Gyeongnam FC, Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i, Suwon Samsung Bluewings and finally Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma in the play-offs to win the championship.

Pohang again made the play-offs in the 2008 season by finishing the season in fifth place, but were knocked out in their play-off game by Ulsan Hyundai after the penalty shoot-out. However, the club fared much better in the 2008 Korean FA Cup. After beating Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma in the quarter-finals, Pohang knocked out Daegu FC in the semi-finals and then defeated Gyeongnam FC in the final to ensure qualification for the 2009 AFC Champions League.

In the 2009 AFC Champions League, the Steelers defeated Umm-Salal of Qatar 4–1 on aggregate in the semi-finals to advance to their first ever AFC Champions League final. The Steelers defeated Saudi club Al-Ittihad 2–1 at the National Stadium in Tokyo, Japan to claim the title. For the 2009 K League season, Pohang once again qualified for the play-off phase of the league by finishing the regular season in second place, equal with FC Seoul on points, but ahead on goal difference. The Steelers had a bye to the semi-finals, but lost to Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma. Nonetheless, their regular season placing saw them qualify for the 2010 AFC Champions League Group stage.

Following the conclusion of the 2009 K League season, at the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in December, the Steelers finished in third place after defeating Mexican side Atlante 4–3 on penalties.

Pohang saw further success on the pitch under new manager Hwang Sun-hong with a unique playstyle dubbed &#x27;Steel Taka&#x27;, winning the 2012 and 2013 editions of the Korean FA Cup, and also the 2013 K League season. However, the club has not won a league title since 2013 as Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors and later Ulsan rose to dominate the league, and went into an extended trophy drought.

In April 2019, Kim Gi-dong took over as manager. He led Pohang back to the top half of the league, and in 2020, they finished third in the league, qualifying for the AFC Champions League. The club made a strong run in the 2021 AFC Champions League, reaching the final but finishing as runners-up after losing to continental rivals Al Hilal.

In 2023, Pohang celebrated their 50th anniversary by winning the FA Cup, defeating Jeonbuk Hyundai in the final and securing their first FA Cup victory in ten years.

After Kim Gi-dong left for FC Seoul in December 2023, Pohang appointed Park Tae-ha as the new manager. While they started the season well, their form deteriorated and the club finished sixth in the league. However, they won the rebranded Korea Cup, defeating rivals Ulsan HD 3–1 in extra time in the final for a second consecutive cup victory.

== Stadium ==
Pohang&#x27;s home is the Pohang Steel Yard, completed in 1990 as South Korea&#x27;s first football-specific stadium.

The club&#x27;s players train at the Pohang Steelers Club House, located in the Buk District of the city. It was completed in 2001 at the cost of approximately 8 billion won.

== Club culture ==
=== Supporters ===
The Steelers have a number of supporters groups, including Levante, Steel Warriors, and Marines. The club enjoys the support of many actual ROK Marines members.

Steelers fans have friendly relations with the supporters of Suwon Samsung Bluewings in a friendship dubbed the Supo Alliance (수포동맹). Suwon&#x27;s Frente Tricolor supporters group raised money for the city of Pohang in the aftermath of Typhoon Hinnamnor.
=== Rivalries ===
The club&#x27;s arch-rival is Ulsan HD, in a match dubbed the East Coast Derby. The geographically close cities of Pohang and Ulsan are two of the largest industrial cities in South Korea, with Pohang being home to POSCO, one of the world&#x27;s largest steelmakers and Ulsan being home to HD Hyundai, the world&#x27;s largest shipbuilding company. One of the most memorable matches between the two sides was played in the final round of the 2013 K League Classic season. Ulsan were top of the table coming into the final round, and Pohang needed to defeat Ulsan away from home to win the title. Kim Won-il scored the winning goal for Pohang late in injury time for the club&#x27;s fifth K League title. Pohang also triumphed over Ulsan in the 2024 Korea Cup final to secure their record sixth cup title.

Another rivalry is shared with Jeonnam Dragons, another club owned by POSCO and located in Gwangyang, home to POSCO&#x27;s largest steelworks that are even larger than the ones in Pohang. The two met in the final of the 2007 Korean FA Cup, with Pohang losing both legs of the tie.

== Kits ==

In 1994, POSCO Atoms wore a green kit and a white kit with a multicoloured sun in the middle. In 1997, Pohang Steelers wore a white shirt with black stripes on the shoulders and black shorts. In 2000, the first kit consisted of a sky blue shirt and white shorts, while the away kit was a black and red hooped shirt with black shorts (similar to the current kit). In 2002, the kit was red with a black &quot;V&quot; on the chest.

<text>The Mazda Titan is a commercial truck produced by the Japanese automaker Mazda since 1971. From the fourth generation onwards, the vehicle had become a rebadged Isuzu Elf truck.

== Predecessor ==
Mazda&#x27;s original entry into the mid-sized Light mini truck class was the Mazda E2000 TF 2FAC in January 1964. This, in turn had replaced the earlier D series. The E2000 came with a standard bed (&quot;EVA12&quot;), with a three-way dropside bed (&quot;EVA12S&quot;), and as a long-wheelbase dropside (&quot;EVA32S&quot;). The truck had an , (VA) engine which had also been used in the earlier D2000. At the time of introduction, the production target was 1,900 units per month. In 1970 a version called the E2500 was added to the lineup. It was fitted with the Perkins-developed &quot;XA&quot;, a diesel engine which was rated at . Its chassis code is &quot;EXA&quot;.

== First generation (1971–1980) ==
The first Titan was presented in 1971, as a successor to the two-ton Mazda E2000. The box-section chassis rails were unusual for the class. Receiving the chassis code &quot;EXB&quot;, the tilt-cab Titan retained the 2.5-litre &quot;XA&quot; diesel engine of the earlier E2000 without any change. For heavier duty usage, there was also the XB-engined Titan T2700: a diesel version with four more horsepower (). A 2.0-litre petrol four cylinder engine was also available. In 1977, the Titan underwent a minor change and facelift. Along with a new grille and bumpers, the turn signals were bigger and more squared off and incorporated vents for the cabin. Most obviously, the old round &quot;M&quot; logo was replaced by the new corporate &quot;MAZDA&quot; logo.

The larger, 3.7-litre XC-engine also became available for heavier versions, rated at . This generation Titan was also the first to provide the basis for the Australian-market 3-tonne truck badged &quot;Ford Trader&quot;.

This generation had also been made under license by Kia, badged as Kia Titan when Mazda granted Kia the rights to manufacture it in South Korea., and was shared with a minibus called the Mazda Parkway.
== Second generation (1980–1989) ==

The second generation was announced in October 1980. Engine capacity increased to 4052 cc with the introduction of the new, six-cylinder ZB diesel engine. 2.0, 2.5, and 3-liter four-cylinder models were also available. This model also received a dual range (ten-speed) transmission, marketed as the &quot;Two Way Shift.&quot; In 1982 the second generation Mazda Parkway bus version was introduced, based on the new Titan.

May 1984: Minor change, with a new front grille. Japanese market models were now also compliant with the 1983 emissions regulations.

1987: Minor change. As part of the facelift, the four round headlights were changed to four square units of standard type. A DIN-standard audio space is provided.

The Mazda Titan also appeared in export markets as the Mazda T2000, T2500, T3000 or the Mazda T4100. It was also license built in India under Swaraj Mazda, beginning in 1985 (trial production) and 1986 (full production). The company was renamed SML Isuzu in 2010 and the truck is marketed under SMLI.
== Third generation (1989–2000) ==

The third generation Titan was announced in 1989. The truck received all-new bodywork, albeit still rather similar looking. The biggest difference is that the side windows received a pronounced dip at the leading edge, to allow the driver better visibility. The &quot;Titan&quot; logos were changed to all-caps. The new Titan also received mudguards, with prominent &quot;Titan&quot; script. In 1992, the Titan underwent a minor facelift, softening the design somewhat.

In 1995, the Titan received another facelift although there were also some mechanical changes this time: To be compliant with the stricter 1994 emissions standards, Mazda had to replace the higher output engines with Isuzu&#x27;s 4HF1 and 4HG1 engines. The Mazda logo was made considerably larger.

In October 1997, a third facelift was implemented. The front was rounded off, with the windscreen made to look larger by placing a piece of black plastic beneath it. The four square lamps were replaced by more irregularly shaped single units which wrap around the corners. The Titan logo was changed from red to white characters.

In May 1999, the 1998 emissions standards were met - except for the four-litre version, which did not become compliant until November.

In export markets, the Titan was sold as the Mazda T series and Ford Trader. Buyers had a choice of rear ends that included ute bed, tray top, and a box which included a hydraulic lifting tray. The choice of motor was either a four or six-cylinder diesel (some of which are of Perkins origin) or a petrol engine with either four or six cylinders.
== Fourth generation (2000–2004) ==

The fourth generation Titan was launched on May 4, 2000.

On October 25, 2000, the 1-ton payload Titan Dash was launched, replacing the Bongo Brawny truck. In November, CNG powered versions were added to the range.

On June 24, 2004, the fifth generation of the Titan was launched, built by Isuzu (see below). The Titan (from 1.5- to 4-ton payload) became a rebadged Isuzu Elf. The 1-ton Titan Dash remained in production. In December, the Diesel versions adopted the Bongo&#x27;s DPF-equipped 2.0 litre turbo-diesel engine, in order to meet new short-term emission regulations. A driver&#x27;s seat airbag became standard equipment across the Titan Dash range.

In August 2007, Diesel versions became compliant with the new long-term emission regulations for compact vans and trucks with a loading capacity of 1 ton or less, due to changes in the compression ratio and DPF capacity. The Titan Dash was discontinued in 2010.

== Fifth generation (2004–2007) ==

In June 2004, the lighter Titan Dash became the only truck to be built in-house by Mazda, as the fifth generation Titan was an OEM-supplied Isuzu Elf. The fourth generation Titan was the last 1.5-4t truck developed by Mazda, and saw an uncommonly short production run of only four years - the production life of a truck in the Japanese market usually being around 10 years.

The Isuzu-built Titan featured three Diesel options, 3.1 L, 4.8 L and 4.8 L turbo, in addition to LPG and CNG engines. 4-wheel drive versions and crew cabs were now also available.
== Sixth generation (2007–2023) ==
In January 2007, the sixth generation of the Titan was launched for the Japanese market featuring a newly designed body, Mazda&#x27;s auto start-stop system, a new range of engines and lighter body panels. The target sales volume was limited to 430 units per month.

== Seventh generation (2023–present) ==

<text>Jeju SK FC () is a South Korean professional football club based in Jeju Province that competes in the K League 1, the top division in South Korea. In the past, the club has been known as the Yukong Elephants, Bucheon SK, and Jeju United.

==History==
The club was founded on 17 December 1982 as Yukong FC, becoming the second professional football club to be established in South Korea. The club&#x27;s mascot was an elephant and the team became known as the Yukong Elephants. It was owned and financially supported by the Sunkyoung Group&#x27;s subsidiary, Yukong (currently SK Group&#x27;s &quot;SK Energy&quot;), along with Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi as its franchise. Yukong FC was a founding member of the &quot;Korean Super League&quot;, South Korea&#x27;s first professional football league and forerunner to the K League. Yukong Elephants won the league championship on only one occasion, in 1989.

When the Super League was established there was no home and away system, but following its implementation in 1987, Yukong FC was initially based within the Seoul Metropolitan Area. From 1990, the club shared Dongdaemun Stadium in Seoul with Ilhwa Chunma and LG Cheetahs. In 1992, the three clubs even allowed spectators to use their club memberships to watch each other&#x27;s home matches. 

As part of the K League&#x27;s decentralization policy, in 1995 the Seoul government gave an eviction order to the three clubs based in Seoul (Yukong Elephants, LG Cheetahs and Ilhwa Chunma). However, they guaranteed that if clubs built a football-specific stadium in Seoul, they could have a Seoul franchise and return to Seoul. As a result, the three clubs were forced to move their home base from Seoul to other cities. 

In 1996, Yukong moved to the city of Bucheon, a satellite city of Seoul. Mid-way through the 1997 season, the club re-branded itself as Bucheon SK. Because the city of Bucheon lacked a stadium, they used the Mokdong Stadium in Seoul until 2000. At the start of the 2001 season, the team moved to the 35,545-capacity Bucheon Leports Complex. In February 2006, Bucheon SK announced their move to Jeju without any fore notice, and renamed as Jeju United FC. They adopted the vacant Jeju World Cup Stadium as their new home ground. In 2025, the club rebranded as Jeju SK FC.

<text>Oracle Grid Engine, previously known as Sun Grid Engine (SGE), CODINE (Computing in Distributed Networked Environments) or GRD (Global Resource Director), was a grid computing computer cluster software system (otherwise known as a batch-queuing system), acquired as part of a purchase of Gridware, then improved and supported by Sun Microsystems and later Oracle. There have been open source versions and multiple commercial versions of this technology, initially from Sun, later from Oracle, then from Univa Corporation, and later from HPC Gridware as Gridware Cluster Scheduler. The open source version is still under active development under the SISSL license as Open Cluster Scheduler.

On October 22, 2013 Univa announced it acquired the intellectual property and trademarks for the Grid Engine technology and that Univa will take over support. Univa has since evolved the Grid Engine technology, e.g. improving scalability as demonstrated by a 1 million core cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced on June 24, 2018.

The original Grid Engine open-source project website closed in 2010, but versions of the technology are still available under its original Sun Industry Standards Source License (SISSL). Those projects were forked from the original project code and are known as Son of Grid Engine, Open Grid Scheduler and Univa Grid Engine.

Grid Engine is typically used on a computer farm or high-performance computing (HPC) cluster and is responsible for accepting, scheduling, dispatching, and managing the remote and distributed execution of large numbers of standalone, parallel or interactive user jobs. It also manages and schedules the allocation of distributed resources such as processors, memory, disk space, and software licenses.

Grid Engine used to be the foundation of the Sun Grid utility computing system, made available over the Internet in the United States in 2006, later becoming available in many other countries and having been an early version of a public cloud computing facility predating AWS, for instance.

==History==
In 2000, Sun acquired Gridware a privately owned commercial vendor of advanced computing resource management software with offices in San Jose, Calif., and Regensburg, Germany. Later that year, Sun offered a free version of Gridware for Solaris and Linux, and renamed the product Sun Grid Engine.

In 2001, Sun made the source code available, and adopted the open source development model. Ports for Mac OS X and *BSD were contributed by the non-Sun open source developers.

In 2010, after the purchase of Sun by Oracle, the Grid Engine 6.2 update 6 source code was not included with the binaries, and changes were not put back to the project&#x27;s source repository. In response to this, the Grid Engine community started the Open Grid Scheduler project to continue to develop and maintain a free implementation of Grid Engine.

On January 18, 2011, it was announced that Univa had recruited several principal engineers from the former Sun Grid Engine team and that Univa would be developing their own forked version of Grid Engine. The newly announced Univa Grid Engine did include commercial support and would compete with the official version of Oracle Grid Engine.

On October 22, 2013 Univa has announced that it had acquired the intellectual property and trademarks pertaining to the Grid Engine technology and that Univa will take over support for Oracle Grid Engine customers.

In September 2020, Altair Engineering, a global technology company providing solutions in data analytics, product development, and high-performance computing (HPC) acquired Univa.

2023 the lead developers of Sun Grid Engine, Oracle Grid Engine, Univa Grid Engine and successor decided to build
Gridware Cluster Scheduler(GCS) based on their open source Open Cluster Scheduler which is 100% &quot;SGE&quot; backward compatible.

== Cluster architecture ==

A typical Grid Engine cluster consists of a master host and one or more execution hosts. Multiple &quot;shadow masters&quot; can also be configured as hot spares, which take over the role of the master when the original master host crashes.

==Support and training==
Univa is providing commercial support and training for Univa Grid Engine and Oracle Grid Engine. Below is a description of some of the historic options.

Sun provided support contracts 
for the commercial version of Grid Engine on most UNIX platforms and Windows. Professional services, consulting, training, and support were provided by Sun Partners. Sun partners with Georgetown University to deliver Grid Engine administration classes. &quot;The Bioteam&quot; runs short SGE training workshops that are 1 or 2 days long.

Users obtained community support on the Grid Engine mailing lists.
Grid Engine Workshops were held in 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009, and 2012 in Regensburg, Germany.

<doc id="1056425" wikidata="Q129673" url="?curid=1056425" title="Ulsan HD FC">
<text>Ulsan HD FC (), formerly Ulsan Hyundai FC, is a South Korean professional football club based in Ulsan that competes in the K League 1, the top tier of South Korean football. Founded in 1983 as Hyundai Horang-i, they joined the K League in 1984. Their home ground is Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium. The club is owned by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries.

Ulsan HD have won the league title five times, most recently in 2024, and the Korean FA Cup once, in 2017. At the international level, they have won the AFC Champions League twice, in 2012 and 2020, and are the only club to have won the tournament twice without defeat.

==History==

===Early years: before Ulsan (1983–1989)===
The club was founded on 6 December 1983 as Hyundai Horang-i, with tiger as its mascot (horangi means tiger in Korean). Their original franchise area was Incheon and Gyeonggi Province. They joined the professional K League from 1984 season. While they finished their debut season as 3rd place, the team&#x27;s striker Baek Jong-chul became the K League Top Scorer, scoring 16 goals in 28 matches. They won their first professional trophy in 1986, winning the Professional Football Championship, which is the origin of Korean League Cup. From the 1987 season, the club moved their franchise from Incheon and Gyeonggi Province to Gangwon Province. In the 1988 season, they finished the season as the runners-up in the league.

===Move to Ulsan and rise to power (1990–1999)===
Beginning in the 1990 season, the club moved their franchise to Ulsan, where the headquarters of several branches of owner company Hyundai are located at, from Gangwon Province. Former South Korea&#x27;s striker Cha Bum-kun took the managerial position in the 1991 season, leading the club to the runners-up position in the league in his debut season. However, he failed to win any trophy and was replaced by Ko Jae-wook after the 1994 season. Under Ko Jae-wook, Ulsan won their second Korean League Cup trophy in 1995, which was his debut season as Ulsan manager. Ulsan won their first ever league title in 1996, beating Suwon Samsung Bluewings 3–2 on aggregate in the championship playoffs. The club then entered a long dry-spell in terms of league trophies, although they won their third Korean League Cup trophy in 1998, beating Bucheon SK 2–1 on aggregate in the finals.

===Two Kims era (2000–2013)===

Failure to add a major title for years did affect the team negatively. After the exodus of key players like Kim Hyun-seok and a terrible start in the 2000, manager Ko Jae-wook resigned in the middle of the season.

====Kim Jung-nam era: Gangsters of Asia (2000–2008)====
Ulsan appointed Kim Jung-nam, who had formerly managed South Korea, as their next manager. They finished as runners-up in 2002 and 2003, and started to emerge as a strong force. In 2005, with the return of two key players, Yoo Sang-chul and Lee Chun-soo, they qualified for the championship playoffs. In the play-off semi-final, they beat Seongnam Ilhwa 2–1, and in the final, they beat Incheon United 6–3 on aggregate, with a hat-trick from Lee Chun-Soo in the first leg. They became the league champions for the second time in their history.

The club also went on to win the A3 Champions Cup in 2006, in which they participated as K League champions. Although they lost their first match in the competition against JEF United Ichihara Chiba 3–2, they beat Dalian Shide 4–0 and Gamba Osaka 6–0 to clinch the trophy. Lee Chun-soo became the competition&#x27;s top scorer, scoring six goals in three matches. They repeated the merciless attacks in the AFC Champions League that season, beating Al-Shabab 6–0 in the first leg of the quarter-finals. These overwhelming attacks they showed in the season gave Ulsan the nickname &quot;Gangsters of Asia&quot;.

Ulsan won the 2007 Korean League Cup, beating FC Seoul 2–1 in the final on 27 June 2007. In 2008, the team changed their official name from Ulsan Hyundai Horang-i to Ulsan Hyundai FC.

====Kim Ho-kon era: Iron Mace Football (2009–2013)====
Manager Kim Jung-nam stepped down after the 2008 season. Kim Ho-kon, who had managed the South Korea under-23 team that reached the quarter-finals in the 2004 Summer Olympics was appointed as Ulsan&#x27;s next manager.

Kim Ho-kon did not enjoy Ulsan fans&#x27; full support for his first few seasons at the club, mainly because of his defensive tactical style and unsatisfying outcomes. The 2011 season was a dramatic changeover; Ulsan won their fifth Korean League Cup, beating Busan IPark 3–2 in the final. Ulsan also finished the season as runners-up in the K League that season. Their unique style of having many players pushing forward in counterattacks earned them the nickname &quot;Iron mace football&quot;.

In 2012, the club won the AFC Champions League, defeating Al-Ahli 3–0 in the final on 10 November. In the run up to the final, Ulsan went on an unbeaten run throughout the twelve games of the competition, winning nine consecutive games and scoring 27 goals in the process.

=== Downfall of the club (2014–2016) ===
Ulsan Hyundai went trophyless for three years after both Cho Min-kook and Yoon Jong-hwan failed to guide the club to any major honours.

=== Return of the golden generation (2017–present) ===
On 21 November 2016, Ulsan Hyundai hired Kim Do-hoon as their manager. He restored the club status back by guiding the club to the 2017 Korean FA Cup final and winning it 2–1 on aggregate against Busan IPark, the club&#x27;s first trophy in five years. Three years later, Kim also led Ulsan Hyundai to victory in the 2020 AFC Champions League, defeating Iranian club Persepolis 2–1 in the final. Júnior Negrão scored a brace to secure the club&#x27;s second AFC Champions League trophy, subsequently qualifying for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup, where Ulsan finished sixth.

For the 2021 season, Ulsan Hyundai signed former South Korea international player Hong Myung-bo as their manager. He guided the club to consecutive league titles in the 2022 and 2023 seasons. The 2022 title was won in dramatic fashion, as Ulsan defeated rivals Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors, the winners of the previous five K League 1 seasons, with two goals scored by Hungarian international Martin Ádám in injury time. It was Ulsan&#x27;s first league title since 2005.

In December 2023, Ulsan Hyundai changed its name to Ulsan HD and unveiled a new emblem ahead of the 2024 season. The &quot;HD&quot; comes from the club parent company &#x27;HD Hyundai&#x27;, which was renamed from Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings in December 2022. In April 2024, the team qualified for the expanded 2025 FIFA Club World Cup by defeating Yokohama F. Marinos at home in the first leg of the semi-final of the 2023–24 AFC Champions League.

With the departure of Hong Myung-bo to guide the South Korea national team, Ulsan HD hired former Malaysia national team head coach Kim Pan-gon on 28 July 2024. He successfully guided the team to a third consecutive championship title in 2024, thereby establishing a dynasty.

== Stadium ==
Ulsan plays at the Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium, completed in 2001 in preparation for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It is one of the largest football-specific stadiums in South Korea.

The club&#x27;s players train at the Hyundai Sport Club House, completed in 2002, in the city&#x27;s Dong District.

== Supporters and rivalries ==

=== Supporters ===

The club&#x27;s main supporters group is called the Cheoyong Warriors (처용전사), founded in 1997. Cheoyong refers to a legendary figure in Korean folklore associated with the city of Ulsan.

Ulsan&#x27;s on-pitch success led to an all-time high average attendance in 2024, with the club recording 348,119 fans across 19 home games in the season, the second highest in the league behind only FC Seoul. Besides the city of Ulsan, the club&#x27;s fans hail from all over South Korea and the surrounding Gyeongsang region in particular.

The club&#x27;s growing popularity has led to continuously increasing revenue, with the club earning a record 48 billion South Korean won in 2024.

=== Rivalries ===

==== East Coast Derby ====

Ulsan contests the fierce East Coast Derby with Pohang Steelers, based in nearby Pohang, another of the most successful clubs in the K League. The rivalry is one between two of the wealthiest industrial cities in South Korea, with Ulsan being a global center for shipbuilding, automotive manufacturing, and oil refining, while Pohang is home to steel giant and Steelers owner POSCO.

One of the most memorable matches between the two sides was played in the final round of the 2013 K League Classic season. Ulsan only needed a draw to win the title, but conceded a goal late in injury time and Pohang won the title instead. Ulsan also faced Pohang in the 2024 Korea Cup final, which Pohang won 3–1 after extra time.

In January 2025, members of the Cheoyong Warriors supporters group protested a move by the city government of Ulsan to change the color of some of the seating of the Munsu Football Stadium to red, citing that red is the color of their arch rivals Pohang.

==== Hyundai Derby ====
Since the late 2010s, Ulsan&#x27;s chief rivals have been Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in a match known as the Hyundai Derby. Ulsan rose to become the primary rival of Jeonbuk, which dominated South Korean football in the 2010s. Once a one-sided affair, Ulsan&#x27;s eventual triumph over Jeonbuk in the 2022 season led to an intensification of an already heated rivalry that is arguably still the biggest matchup in the league.

Although the parent companies of Ulsan and Jeonbuk share the Hyundai brand, the parent companies (HD Hyundai for Ulsan and Hyundai Motor for Jeonbuk) are legally separate entities.

<text>Joan Clos i Matheu, (; born 29 June 1949) is a Spanish politician who was mayor of Barcelona, Spain from September 1997 to September 2006. He took over from Pasqual Maragall in 1997. In 1999 he was elected to a four-year term, and was then re-elected in the municipal elections of 25 May 2003. In September 2006, he left Barcelona Town Hall, after nine years of office, as he was appointed Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade by Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. After a stint as the Spanish Ambassador in Turkey and Azerbaijan, in 2010 he was appointed as executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, (UN-HABITAT), and Under Secretary General of the United Nations. Joan Clos is also president of the Spanish Chapter of The International Real Estate Federation (FIABCI).

== Beginnings ==

He graduated from the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona (UAB) with a degree in medicine and pursued his studies in the Sant Pau Hospital of Barcelona. During the political transition he took part in anti-Franco movements for the profession and the modernization of the healthcare services. He worked in the Analysis and Healthcare Programs Centre (CAPS) with a group of doctors who defended the political transformation of the country as a means for recovering professional dignity.

Once he graduated in medicine and after having worked for some time as an anaesthetist, he decided to change his professional career and moved into epidemiology, community medicine and healthcare resources management. He studied his specialty at the University of Barcelona, in the United States and in Edinburgh (Scotland). Between 1981 and 1991 he was the chairman of the Spanish Society of Epidemiology and Healthcare Administration.

== Political career ==

Continuing this process of involvement and dedication to healthcare management, he joined the Barcelona municipal government as director of healthcare services. In 1993 he was elected councillor on the Barcelona Council for the PSC (Catalonia Socialist Party).

Achieving efficient municipal management and “city making” have been two constant features that have marked his municipal career. He thus directed the regeneration project for the neighbourhood of Ciutat Vella, following a comprehensive plan that combined planning intervention, financial and social investment and facilities strengthening in order to open up this district to the city and to improve the quality of life for its residents. In 1999, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) awarded the City of Barcelona the Royal Gold Medal personified in the men who have driven the transformation of the city: Narcís Serra, Pasqual Maragall and Joan Clos.

As second deputy mayor with direct responsibility for organisation, economy and treasury, he started a thorough reorganisation of the economic and financial structure of the City Hall with the aim of reaching budgetary stability and, at the same time, establishing a consistent investment programme to tackle the period after the Olympic Games with new projects.

His mayor’s office was enhanced by the design, preparation and holding of the first Universal Forum of Cultures, held in Barcelona during the summer 2004 and by the consequent development of the area of Besós and Diagonal Mar, a project of urban development ten times as big as the one Barcelona went through for the Olympic Games in 1992. The project 22@, a new technological neighbourhood built on the old Poblenou, together with the reorganisation of La Sagrera, are another two examples of his urbanistic activities as Mayor of Barcelona .

In September 2006, the Spanish President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero appointed Clos as a Minister of Industry, Tourism and Trade. In July 2008, he became the Spanish Ambassador in Turkey and Azerbaijan. Since 18 October 2010, he is the executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme, UN-HABITAT, and Under Secretary General of the United Nations.

In 2012 the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon appointed Clos as a Secretary-General of the Habitat III Conference and to act as a focal point on behalf of the United Nations.

== Awards and honours ==
Dr. Clos received a number of awards, including a gold medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1999 for transforming Barcelona. In 2002, he won the UN-Habitat Scroll of Honour Award for encouraging global cooperation between local authorities and the United Nations.

===Honours===
* Grand-Cross of the Order of Prince Henry, Portugal (25 September 2006)

== Scandals ==

On 4 February 2006, a local police was seriously injured during the eviction of an illegal party held in a squatted theatre owned by the Barcelona city council. The initial version of the events given by Joan Clos to the press described the policeman being hit in the head by a flower pot thrown from one of the windows of the theatre and suffering a vertebra fracture as a result. This version was later changed to fit the official version given by the police, two of whom were later found to have been tortured the detainees and to have fabricated evidence and lied in court in a different case.
Five young people were condemned to up to five years in prison solely based on the second version of these events. One of the condemned, poet Patricia Heras committed suicide during prison leave. These events were later described in detail in the award-winning documentary Ciutat morta.

<text>Jonathan James Bush (May 6, 1931 – May 5, 2021) was an American banker. Bush was the fourth child and third son of U. S. Senator Prescott Bush and his wife Dorothy Bush. Through his brother, President George H. W. Bush, he was an uncle of President George W. Bush and former Florida governor Jeb Bush. He died in Florida, hours before his 90th birthday.

==Early life==
Bush was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, to Prescott Sheldon Bush, a politician, and Dorothy Walker Bush. He graduated from The Hotchkiss School and Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. The fourth child in the family, he was the brother of Prescott Bush, Jr. (1922–2010), the 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush (1924–2018), Nancy Bush Ellis (1926–2021), and William &quot;Bucky&quot; Bush (1938–2018). He was the uncle of the 43rd President George W. Bush. Like his brother George H. W. Bush, he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Yale.

Bush and his wife Josephine are the parents of entertainment reporter Billy Bush and health care executive Jonathan S. Bush.

==Career==
As of December 31, 2018, Jonathan Bush had retired from Fairfield, Bush &amp; Co., an Investment Advisory Firm in New Haven, Connecticut.

Jonathan Bush founded J. Bush &amp; Co., which provided discreet banking services for the Washington, D.C., embassies of foreign governments for many years. In 1997, Riggs Bank bought J. Bush &amp; Co. and made Bush CEO &amp; President of Riggs Investment, a firm based in New Haven, Connecticut.

In the early 1980s, Jonathan Bush helped organize investors for George W. Bush&#x27;s first oil venture, Arbusto Energy, later called Bush Explorations.

During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush was a major contributor and fundraiser to his nephew&#x27;s election and was named a &quot;Bush Pioneer&quot; for raising more than $100,000 for the campaign.

Bush died on May 5, 2021, the day before his 90th birthday. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving child of Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush.

==Controversy==
On May 15, 2004, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an article that said, &quot;A political Web site written by a Democratic operative drew attention yesterday to the fact that President Bush&#x27;s uncle, Jonathan J. Bush, is a top executive at Riggs Bank, which this week agreed to pay a record $25 million in civil fines for violations of law intended to thwart money laundering.&quot;

The bank accounts under investigation may have been Saudi, though the article did not say so. It did, however, go on to say: &quot;a source familiar with the multiple federal investigations of the bank&#x27;s Saudi accounts and other embassy accounts say Jonathan Bush&#x27;s investment advice unit has &#x27;no relationship whatsoever&#x27; with any of the Riggs&#x27;s Saudi accounts.&quot; Moreover, the newspaper quoted a spokesman for the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as saying &quot;any suggestion of political influence in the Riggs situation is &#x27;preposterous.&#x27;&quot;

In 1991, Bush was fined $30,000 in Massachusetts and several thousand dollars in Connecticut for violating registration laws governing securities sales. He was barred from securities brokerage with the general public in Massachusetts for one year.

<doc id="1056439" wikidata="Q486637" url="?curid=1056439" title="Turkmen manat">
<text>The manat (; abbreviation: m; code: TMT) is the currency of Turkmenistan. The original manat was introduced on 1 November 1993, replacing the rouble at a rate of 1 manat = Rbls 500. The manat is subdivided into 100 &quot;tenge&quot; ().

Due to heavy inflation a new manat was introduced on 1 January 2009 at the rate of 5,000 old manats to 1 new manat.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;manat&quot; is derived from the Russian word монета (&quot;moneta&quot;) meaning &quot;coin,&quot; which derived from Latin &quot;Monēta&quot;. It was used as the name of the Soviet currency in Turkmen () and in Azerbaijani.

==Coins==
In 1993, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 tenge. The 1, 5, and 10 tenge were struck in copper-plated-steel, with the higher denominations in nickel-plated-steel. This first series of coins was short lived as their metal value soon became worth more than their actual face value. After a period of high inflation, new coins of 500 and 1,000 manats were introduced in 1999. All coins of this period had to depict the incumbent president by law.

During the monetary reform of 2009, new coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 tenge were issued with bimetallic 1 and 2 manats following in 2010. The 1, 2, and 5 tenge are nickel-plated steel while the 10, 20, and 50 tenge are struck in brass. Instead of depicting the current head of state the coins feature a map of Turkmenistan with the Independence Tower superimposed in front of it. All circulating coins of Turkmenistan are struck by the Royal Mint.

==Banknotes==

===First manat (TMM, 1993—2009)===
In 1993, manat notes were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 manats, replacing the Soviet rouble. These were followed by notes for 1,000 manats in 1995 and 5,000 and 10,000 manats in 1996. In 2005, a new series of notes was introduced in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 manats. All notes, with exception of the 1 and 5 manat banknotes bear a portrait of former president Saparmurat Atayevich Niyazov Turkmenbashi. All Turkmen banknotes are produced by the De La Rue printing and banknote company.

===First manat (second issue)===
In 2005, a new series of manat banknotes was introduced. They had originally been intended to replace the first manat at a fixed rate, with 1 equal to 1,000 of the first manat, but the revaluation was postponed and this issue was released to circulate with previous manat issues. The series of notes was introduced in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 manats. Two new coins were also introduced in only two denominations, 500 and 1,000 manats. Both the first and second issue manat banknotes circulated in tandem until the issue of the redenominated issue in 2009.

===Second manat===
After hyperinflation significantly devalued the currency, a new manat with a fixed exchange rate was introduced, replacing the old manat on a ratio of 5,000 old manats = 1 new manat. Banknotes in this series were printed in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 500 manats. As part of an effort by the Turkmen government to dismantle Niyazov&#x27;s extensive cult of personality and help politically disambiguate the current rule, only the highest valued banknote, 500 manats, bears a portrait of the former leader. The 500 manat note has yet to be released into circulation. The other denominations feature images of buildings in Ashgabat or technological achievements (TurkmenSat 1) and portraits of Ahmed Sanjar, Oghuz Khan, Magtymguly Pyragy and other figures in Turkmen history.

===Exchange rates===
*Before Apr 2009: US$1 = 1.04 manat
*Apr 2009 - Jan 2015: US$1 = 2.85 manats
*Jan 2015 onwards: US$1 = 3.5 manats

A black market for exchange rate exists as cash exchanges are forbidden by law in Turkmenistan. The parallel exchange rate varied between 40–41m per U.S. dollar .

<text>Red velvet cake is a red-colored layer cake with cream cheese or ermine icing. The origin of the cake is unknown, although it is popular in the Southern United States and has been served as a dessert at New York City&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria hotel since the 1920s. Both the hotel and Eaton&#x27;s in Canada claim to have developed the recipe. 

Ingredients of the cake include baking powder, butter, buttermilk or vinegar, cocoa powder, eggs, flour, salt, vanilla extract, and in most modern recipes, red food coloring. 

The cake lost popularity after Red Dye #2 was linked to cancer in the 1970s. In the late 20th century, the cake regained popularity in the United States to the point that other food products were being made to mimic the flavor and other consumer products were being made to mimic the scent.

== History ==
Although popular in the Southern United States, it is unknown where the red velvet cake originated. Recipes for &quot;velvet&quot; cakes, designated so because of the fineness of their crumb texture, date to the 19th century, but include a variety of types of cake, including shortcakes and pancakes, whose recipes included ingredients such as almond flour, cocoa powder or corn starch to soften the wheat flour proteins and make finer-textured cakes. At the time, brown sugar, which was also called red sugar, was also more readily and cheaply available than refined white sugar, and may have turned the cakes &quot;vaguely reddish&quot;, according to food writer Stella Parks.

Additionally, in the 19th century, the first recipes for chocolate cakes appeared, with some including buttermilk, which, when combined with raw cocoa powder, would turn the batter and resulting cake a naturally occurring burgundy hue. Cakes from this type of recipe include the devil&#x27;s food cake, mahogany cake, and oxblood cake. According to Parks, the concept of a velvet cocoa powder cake originated in the early 20th century when the recipes for mahogany cake and devil&#x27;s food cake were merged. During World War I and the Great Depression, cakes made with beetroot were red, while chocolate cakes made with beetroot were burgundy-colored.

In the 1920s, red velvet layer cake became a famous dessert at New York City&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria hotel. According to John Harrisson and John Doherty, the authors of the &quot;Waldorf-Astoria Cookbook&quot;, the cake is considered a Southern recipe. When food dye was in development in the 1930s, manufacturers marketed it by creating recipes that featured it to enhance naturally occurring colors from other ingredients. One such recipe was developed during World War II by the Adams Extract company; the owners created it based on the mahogany cake with ermine icing after eating the cake at Waldorf-Astoria. Their recipe thereafter became known throughout the country. By the 1960s, recipes for red velvet cake appeared in newspapers and multiple cookbooks. Starting in the 1970s after Red Dye #2 was linked to cancer, the cake became less popular. In the late 20th century, the cake regained popularity as a result of the 1989 film &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot;, which featured the cake in a scene.

In Canada, the cake was popular in the 1940s and 1950s. It was featured at restaurants inside Eaton&#x27;s department store in Toronto and was widely attributed as a favorite of Flora Eaton. The &quot;Lunch with Lady Eaton&quot; cookbook refers to it as an &quot;exclusive sweet recipe of Eaton&#x27;s&quot;. The Waldorf-Astoria also claims to have created the cake.

== Ingredients and preparation ==
The primary ingredients of red velvet cake are baking powder, butter, buttermilk, cocoa powder, eggs, flour, sugar, salt, vanilla extract, vinegar, and, in modern recipes, red food coloring. 

The batter is made by first creaming together butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract. Separately, cocoa powder and red food coloring are combined and then integrated into the mixture. The remaining ingredients are then added, mixed, and blended. After pouring the batter into a cake pan, the cake is baked for 20 to 25 minutes and cooled before adding icing between the layers. Most modern recipes call for a cream cheese frosting, but some recipes call for ermine icing. 

=== Variations ===
Chef Pamela Moxley&#x27;s beetroot variation has beetroot, lemon juice, and goat cheese as additional components. According to the variation&#x27;s recipe, beetroots are chopped to the size of sliced onions and added to the batter, while lemon juice is used to tint the batter red; goat cheese is combined with the cream cheese icing. Other cake variations include red velvet bundt cake, doberge cake, ice cream cake and cheesecake. Non-cake alternatives of red velvet cake include red velvet cookies, brownies, cinnamon rolls, lattes, teas, waffles, Pop-Tarts, and sundaes. The flavor has also been used in protein powders and vodka and the scent in candles and air fresheners.

== In culture ==
In popular culture, it appeared in the film &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; as an armadillo-shaped red velvet cake, which resulted in an immediate increase in interest in it. In 2002, singers Jessica Simpson and Nick Lachey used it as their wedding cake. Eventually, it became trendy in upscale bakeries. The research director of Packaged Facts, a food research publisher, notes that the cake accounted for 1.5% of all menu items in the United States, and by 2013, 4.1%. According to Kim Severson of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the cake had become &quot;a national commercial obsession&quot; by 2014; she described the cake as having &quot;got its sleeve caught in the American food merchandising machine&quot;.

Cookbook writer Nicole A. Taylor observes that red velvet cake is commonly served for Christmas and Juneteenth celebrations. However, it is not a dish that is otherwise closely associated with African-American culture. Although the cake is often considered a Southern cake, chef Virginia Willis described categorizing the cake as part of Southern cuisine as &quot;insulting on some level culturally&quot;.

== Reception ==
Chef James Beard considered red velvet cake bland and uninteresting, yet published a recipe for it in his 1972 book &quot;James Beard&#x27;s American Cookery&quot;. Angie Mosier of the Southern Foodways Alliance said, &quot;It&#x27;s the Dolly Parton of cakes: a little bit tacky, but you love her&quot;.

<text>The (known as the in China and Japan (first three generations), a combination of &quot;accelerate&quot; and &quot;excellent&quot;) is a compact car manufactured by Mazda. It was first introduced in 2003 as a 2004 model, replacing the Familia/323/Protegé in the C-segment.

The second-generation Mazda3 for the 2009 model year was unveiled in late 2008, with the sedan premiering at the Los Angeles Auto Show and the hatchback at the Bologna Motor Show. For the 2012 model year, Mazda began offering the Mazda3 with their newly developed Skyactiv technology, including a more rigid body, a new direct-injection engine, and a new 6-speed transmission.

The third generation was introduced in mid-2013 as a 2014 model year. The third-generation model is the first Mazda3 to adopt the &quot;Kodo&quot; design language and a more complete Skyactiv range of technologies.

The fourth-generation Mazda3 for the 2019 model year was unveiled in November 2018 at the Los Angeles Auto Show. For the 2019 model, the all-new Mazda3 is equipped with the updated Skyactiv technologies, including a spark-controlled compression ignition engine marketed as the Skyactiv-X.

A performance-oriented version of the Mazda3 was marketed until 2013 as the Mazdaspeed3 in North America, Mazdaspeed Axela in Japan, and the Mazda3 MPS in Europe and Australia.

The Mazda3 became one of Mazda&#x27;s fastest-selling vehicles, with cumulative sales in January 2019 of over 6 million units.


== First generation (BK; 2003) ==
The BK series Mazda3 was first unveiled at the 60th Frankfurt Motor Show on 10 September 2003, and launched in Japan in October 2003 as the Axela. The model was well received by the automotive press for its performance, handling, styling and interior, with some describing it as feeling like a more expensive sports sedan/saloon despite its value-oriented price. Some criticisms have included fuel economy and crash test results (only receiving four out of a maximum five stars from the Euro NCAP Safety Testing Programme) the latter of which was rectified by making six airbags standard. In 2006, the Mazda3 was the second best-selling car in Canada and the best selling car in Israel during 2005–2007.

=== Design ===
The Mazda3 is based on the Ford global C1 platform, shared with the latest European Ford Focus and Volvo S40. Previewed by the MX-Sportif concept car, the first-generation Mazda3 was available in two body styles, a four-door fastback sedan/saloon, marketed as a &quot;4-door coupé style&quot; in Europe, and a five-door hatchback, branded the Sport version in Canada, Japan, and the United States. Design work began under chief designer Hideki Suzuki in 1999 at three Mazda design centres in California, United States; Frankfurt, Germany; and Hiroshima, Japan. By 2001, Hasip Girgin&#x27;s design was chosen as a finalist. Girgin was sent to work in Hiroshima for 6 months, after which the final design was frozen for scheduled 2003 production.

The front suspension comprises MacPherson struts, with coil springs and an anti-roll bar. The rear suspension is a Ford-designed &quot;E-link&quot; multi-link suspension, with four locating links per wheel and an anti-roll bar, suspended on coil springs that are mounted inboard of the shock absorbers to reduce suspension intrusion into the cargo area. The first generation Mazda3 has been known to have spontaneous piston failure in the form of the piston itself cracking which is a result of manufacturing anomalies that has plagued a small percentage of the normally reliable car. Four-wheel Disc brakes are fitted, with discs in the front and discs in the rear; ABS and electronic brake force distribution are available as standard, depending on the model. Wheel and tire sizes vary with model, from 15&quot; on base models to optional 17&quot; wheels on upper-level models. The Mazda3 was used as a regular police patrol car by the Public Security Police Force of Macau alongside the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic police cars in Macau, China.

When first introduced, United States-market Mazda3 models were available in only two trim levels, i and s, with the 2.0 L and 2.3 L engines, respectively. Since then Mazda has introduced additional models under the Touring and Grand Touring labels. British Mazda3s are offered in S, TS, TS2, Sport, and a top end 2.3 L turbocharged Mazda3 MPS (Mazda Performance Series) models. Since April 2008, when there was a mainly cosmetic facelift of the Mazda3, there have been some changes to the trim designations for UK cars, with the models now being the entry-level S, then Takara (which replaces TS &amp; TS2), the Tamura Special Edition and the Sport and MPS as before.

All three models use the inline-4 Mazda MZR engine, with various types, displacements and outputs including the MZ-CD turbo-diesel, depending on model and market. Transmissions are a five-speed manual transmission and a four-speed automatic transmission; since the 2006 model year, a five-speed automatic is optional on models with the 2.3 L engine. This transmission has now been made standard on the 2.0 L engine in Japan (FWD models only), as part of a minor facelift in early 2008 which includes different front/rear bumper designs, new wheel designs and body colours, stiffened chassis, and better interior materials. The MPS / Mazdaspeed version is only available with a six-speed manual.

=== 2006 ===
For the 2006 model year, Mazda added variable valve timing and variable-length intake runners to the 2.0-litre engine resulting in a power increase to . The automatic transmission used in the S trim Mazda3 with the 2.3-litre engine was changed from a four-speed to a five-speed design. The larger engine was now PZEV-certified (Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle) for vehicles sold in California and other states that have adopted California automotive emission standards. The smaller engine had already been PZEV-certified. The colour palette was also simplified in 2006, with the deletion of Canary Yellow and Lava Orange Mica.

=== 2007 ===
The 3 received a minor cosmetic facelift for the 2007 model year with minimal exterior, interior and mechanical changes. On base models, the black plastic at the top of the grille became body-coloured. The front fascia and bumper were changed with a floating foglight design and the lower air intake opening was reshaped to better resemble the typical &quot;Mazda five-point face.&quot; All Mazda3 sedans and five-doors gained the same &quot;Axela&quot; clear-lens style rear tail-lights as the SP23 model, which in 2007, Mazda brought out the Mazda Axela similar to the Mazda6 Atenza. In addition, the Grand Touring trim also featured LED brake lights. The LED brake lights were added to compete with the growing trend of higher-end vehicles using LED tail lamps for more visible light output. The range of alloy wheels were redesigned, featuring a 17-inch alloy wheel for the Grand Touring version. The rear fascia was slightly changed adding a notch on the bumper cover of the sedan. Several new exterior colours were added, phantom blue, a copper red metallic (April 2008), Aurora Blue and dark cherry. The Titanium Gray colour was replaced with a darker Galaxy Gray colour.

The interior of the Mazda3 was offered with several new colour choices and an audio jack in the centre console, allowing the use of digital music players. Also, Takara models, which were introduced in the 2008 upgrade, added climate control and 6-CD autochanger to the TS specification.

The 2007 model also includes less visible mechanical changes. The keyless entry system was improved. Reinforcements to the body shell improve overall chassis rigidity. The front dampers of the MacPherson strut suspension have been re-tuned to quicken steering response and reduce understeer. The hydraulic dampers of the multi-link rear suspension were also re-tuned to match the front suspension changes. Mazda engineers and designers addressed concerns regarding cabin noise level by redesigning or changing multiple systems and adding sound-deadening material to the roof lining and hood panel.

The bumper-to-bumper warranty was reduced to 36 months / 36,000 miles while the powertrain warranty was increased to 60 months / 60,000 miles in most markets. In the UK, all Mazda3s have a 3-year unlimited mileage warranty, 3-year roadside assistance and 12 year anti perforation warranty as standard.

Canadian-spec Mazda3s received standard seat-mounted side-airbags and body-shell-mounted side-curtain airbags across the model range. Previously, both airbag types were not available.

It comes with Mazda&#x27;s Skyactiv-G 2.0-litre, direct-injection petrol engine, and Skyactiv-Drive 6-speed automatic or Skyactiv-MT 6-speed manual transmission. The chassis rigidity was increased with the use of additional high tensile steel most significantly in the centre floor pan and B-pillar where reinforcement was extended 7 inches. Additionally, Mazda increased the number of spot welds to join suspension crossmembers to improve handling and stability. There are minor exterior updates: revised grille and air intakes, and a reshaped rear valance panel. Skyactiv models receive a blue ring around the projectors in the headlamps, a Sky Blue engine cover, as well as an optional Skyactiv specific paint colour known as &quot;Sky Blue&quot;. &quot;Car and Driver&quot; reported that such a Mazda3 can reach estimated EPA fuel-economy ratings of 30 mpg city and 39 to 40 highway.

=== Engines ===
== Third generation (BM/BN/BY; 2013) ==
The third-generation 2014 Mazda3 was revealed in Australia on 26 June 2013. It now sits atop the new Skyactiv chassis, no longer sharing the Ford C1 platform. It is the third vehicle to adopt the Mazda&#x27;s &#x27;Kodo&#x27; design language, after the CX-5 and the Mazda6.

It has a drag coefficient (Cd) of 0.26 for the sedan/saloon, slightly higher for the hatchback. Combined with the Skyactiv technology, this produces a rating from the U.S. EPA of city and highway for the 2-litre sedan, and one less mpg highway for the 5-door hatchback.

Two Skyactiv engines are offered in North American markets, the 2.0-litre (with and of torque) and the 2.5-litre (with 184 hp and 185 lb-ft of torque).

The 2.0-litre engine with the 6-speed manual transmission accelerates from in 7.8 seconds and finishes the quarter-mile in 16.1 seconds. Initially the 6-speed manual gearbox was only for the 2.0-litre cars, and automatic transmission was standard on the 2.5, or available for the 2.0. In its first-drive review of the 2014 Mazda3, the auto enthusiast weblog &quot;Jalopnik&quot; stated that &quot;once the 2.5 comes with a manual transmission, there is really no reason to buy anything else in this class.&quot;

=== 2015 ===
For the 2015 model year in North America, the 2.5-litre cars are also offered with manual gearbox. Model trim levels for the U.S. market are SV (2.0 Sedan only), Sport (2.0 Sedan &amp; Hatchback), Touring, and Grand Touring (available in all body styles with either engine). The 2014 model ranked number one among Affordable Small Cars in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s&quot; rankings.

The exterior design of the sedan and hatchback models are heavily differentiated, with both models only sharing the hood and headlights, while front wing fenders and front doors are designed uniquely for each body styles. Its body uses an increased amount of ultra-high-strength steel 980 MPa or higher to 30 percent of the vehicle body, an increase over the 3 percent in the prior generation.

Mazda has swapped the more sophisticated multilink independent rear suspension from its predecessor for a cheaper and more compact torsion beam setup which is claimed to improve the car&#x27;s quietness, along with the added sound deadening materials. To enhance the vehicle&#x27;s NVH, Mazda included a &#x27;two-wall&#x27; structure that leaves space between the body and carpeting on the floor. The model is also equipped with an updated version of the torque vectoring system marketed as the G-Vectoring Control Plus.

Interior materials are upgraded with a stitched dash pad, metal trim for the climate control knobs and central infotainment controller, a new steering wheel design, and a newly developed 8.8-inch display screen with a redesigned Mazda Connect system interface.

<text>Kookmin Bank (), also known as KB Kookmin Bank, is a bank headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. It was the largest bank in Korea and the 60th largest in the world as of 2017. The name Kookmin Bank is a contraction of Citizens National Bank, an English name by which it also used to be referred to in the past. 

== History ==

The Citizens National Bank was founded by the Korean government in late 1962, initially focused on providing financial services for middle- and low-income consumers. Its privatization process was initiated by the sale of a 10 percent stake by initial public offering in 1994. Meanwhile, Kookmin Bank expanded abroad by opening operations in Luxembourg in 1991, Tokyo in 1992, Singapore in 1994, and Hong Kong in 1996, followed by other locations around the world.

Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Kookmin Bank absorbed a number of distressed or insolvent banks, including Daedong Bank in 1998, then Long-Term Credit Bank as announced on , then in 2001. In May 1999, Goldman Sachs invested $500 million into KB and became its largest single shareholder with a 17 percent equity stake, ahead of the Korean government which at the time held 7.2 percent. By 2002, Goldman Sachs had sold most of its investment with a significant profit. At that point, Kookmin had become the largest bank in South Korea. The privatization process was completed in December 2003.

In September 2004, Kookmin Bank said it would restate its 2003 and 2004 earnings after a financial watchdog found that the bank avoided $270 million in taxes.

KB further acquired various companies include credit card, insurance and brokerage firms, transforming into the current financial group in 2008.

<doc id="1056452" wikidata="Q184637" url="?curid=1056452" title="Ten Years' War">
<text>The Ten Years&#x27; War (; 1868–1878), also known as the Great War () and the War of &#x27;68, was part of Cuba&#x27;s fight for independence from Spain. The uprising was led by Cuban-born planters and other wealthy natives. On 10 October 1868, sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes and his followers proclaimed independence, beginning the conflict. This was the first of three liberation wars that Cuba fought against Spain, the other two being the Little War (1879–1880) and the Cuban War of Independence (1895–1898). The final three months of the last conflict escalated with United States involvement, leading to the Spanish–American War.

==Background==
===Slavery===
Cuban bourgeoisie demanded fundamental social and economic reforms from the Crown. Lax enforcement of the slave trade ban had resulted in a dramatic increase in imports of Africans, estimated at 90,000 slaves from 1856 to 1860. This occurred despite a strong abolitionist movement on the island, and rising costs among the slave-holding planters in the east. New technologies and farming techniques made large numbers of slaves unnecessary and prohibitively expensive. In the economic crisis of 1857 many businesses failed, including many sugar plantations and sugar refineries. The abolitionist cause gained strength, favoring a gradual emancipation of slaves with financial compensation from the Government for slaveholders. Additionally, some planters preferred hiring Chinese immigrants as indentured workers and in anticipation of ending slavery. Before the 1870s, more than 125,000 were sent to Cuba. In May 1865, Cuban creole elites placed four demands upon the Spanish Parliament: tariff reform, political representation in Parliament, judicial equality for all Spaniards (including Cubans), and full enforcement of the slave trade ban.

===Colonial policies===
The Spanish Parliament at the time was changing; gaining much influence were reactionary, traditionalist politicians who intended to eliminate all liberal reforms. The power of military tribunals was increased; the colonial government imposed a six percent tax increase on the Cuban planters and businesses. Additionally, all political opposition and the press were silenced. Dissatisfaction in Cuba spread on a massive scale as the mechanisms to express it were restricted. This discontent was particularly felt by the powerful planters and hacienda owners in Eastern Cuba.

The failure of the latest efforts by the reformist movements, the demise of the &quot;Information Board,&quot; and another economic crisis in 1866/67 heightened social tensions on the island. The colonial administration continued to make huge profits which were not re-invested in the island for the benefit of its residents. It funded military expenditures (44% of the revenue), colonial government&#x27;s expenses (41%), and sent some money to the Spanish colony of Fernando Po (12%). The European Spaniards (known as &quot;peninsulares&quot;) concentrated a good deal of the island&#x27;s wealth through their paramount role in Cuban trade. In addition, the Cuban-born population still had no political rights and no representation in Parliament. Objections to these conditions sparked the first serious independence movement, especially in the eastern part of the island.

===Revolutionary conspiracy===
In July 1867, the &quot;Revolutionary Committee of Bayamo&quot; was founded under the leadership of Cuba&#x27;s wealthiest plantation owner, Francisco Vicente Aguilera. The conspiracy rapidly spread to Oriente&#x27;s larger towns, most of all Manzanillo, where Carlos Manuel de Céspedes became the main protagonist of the uprising in 1868. Originally from Bayamo, Céspedes owned an estate and sugar mill known as &quot;La Demajagua&quot;. The Spanish, aware of Céspedes&#x27; anti-colonial intransigence, tried to force him into submission by imprisoning his son Oscar. Céspedes refused to negotiate and Oscar was executed.

== History ==
===Uprising===
Céspedes and his followers had planned the uprising to begin 14 October, but it had to be moved up four days earlier, because the Spaniards had discovered their plan of revolt. In the early morning of 10 October, Céspedes issued the cry of independence, the &quot;10th of October Manifesto&quot; at La Demajagua, which signaled the start of an all-out military uprising against Spanish rule in Cuba. Céspedes freed his slaves and asked them to join the struggle. 10 October is now commemorated in Cuba as a national holiday under the name &quot;Grito de Yara&quot; (&quot;Cry of Yara&quot;).

During the first few days, the uprising almost failed: Céspedes intended to occupy the nearby town of Yara on 11 October. In spite of this initial setback, the uprising of Yara was supported in various regions of the Oriente province, and the independence movement continued to spread throughout the eastern region of Cuba. On 13 October, the rebels took eight towns in the province that favoured the insurgency and acquisition of arms. By October&#x27;s end, the insurrection had enlisted some 12,000 volunteers.
===Military responses===
That same month, Máximo Gómez taught the Cuban forces what would be their most lethal tactic: the &quot;machete charge&quot;. He was a former cavalry officer for the Spanish Army in the Dominican Republic. Forces were taught to combine use of firearms with machetes, for a double attack against the Spanish. When the Spaniards (following then-standard tactics) formed a square, they were vulnerable to rifle fire from infantry under cover, and pistol and carbine fire from charging cavalry. In the event, as with the Haitian Revolution, the European forces suffered the most fatalities due to yellow fever because the Spanish-born troops had no acquired immunity to this endemic tropical disease of the island.

=== 10th of October Manifesto ===
Carlos Manuel de Céspedes called on men of all races to join the fight for freedom. He raised the new flag of an independent Cuba, and rang the bell of the mill to celebrate his proclamation from the steps of the sugar mill of the manifesto signed by him and 15 others. It cataloged Spain&#x27;s mistreatment of Cuba and then expressed the movement&#x27;s aims:

=== Escalation ===

After three days of combat, the rebels seized the important city of Bayamo. In the enthusiasm of this victory, poet and musician Perucho Figueredo composed Cuba&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;La Bayamesa”. The first government of the Republic in Arms, headed by Céspedes, was established in Bayamo. The city was retaken by the Spanish after 3 months on 12 January, but the fighting had burned it to the ground.

The war spread in Oriente: on 4 November 1868, Camagüey rose up in arms during the Las Clavellinas Uprising and, in early February 1869, Las Villas followed. The uprising was not supported in the westernmost provinces of Pinar del Río, Havana and Matanzas. With few exceptions (Vuelta Abajo), resistance was clandestine. A staunch supporter of the rebellion was José Martí who, at the age of 16, was detained and condemned to 16 years of hard labour. He was later deported to Spain. Eventually he developed as a leading Latin American intellectual and Cuba&#x27;s foremost national hero, its primary architect of the 1895–98 Cuban War of Independence.

After some initial victories and defeats, in 1868 Céspedes replaced Gomez as head of the Cuban Army with United States General Thomas Jordan, a veteran of Confederate States Army in the American Civil War. He brought a well-equipped force, but General Jordan&#x27;s reliance on regular tactics, although initially effective, left the families of Cuban rebels far too vulnerable to the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; tactics of the ruthless Blas Villate, Count of Valmaceda (also spelled Balmaceda). Valeriano Weyler, known as the &quot;Butcher Weyler&quot; in the 1895–1898 War, fought alongside the Count of Balmaceda.

After General Jordan resigned and returned to the US, Cespedes returned Máximo Gómez to his command. Gradually a new generation of skilled battle-tested Cuban commanders rose from the ranks, including Antonio Maceo Grajales, José Maceo, Calixto García, Vicente García González and Federico Fernández Cavada. Raised in the United States and with an American mother, Fernández Cavada had served as a colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War. His brother Adolfo Fernández Cavada also joined the Cuban fighting for independence. On 4 April 1870, the senior Federico Fernández Cavada was named Commander-in-Chief of all the Cuban forces. Other war leaders of note fighting on the Cuban Mambí side included Donato Mármol, Luis Marcano-Alvarez, Carlos Roloff, Enrique Loret de Mola, Julio Sanguily, Domingo de Goicuría, Guillermo Moncada, Quintin Bandera, Benjamín Ramirez, and Julio Grave de Peralta.

Because of the escalating violence, after the first year of the war, around 100,000 Cubans fled the country. Generally speaking, those rich enough settled in Europe or else in northern cities in America like New York, Philadelphia, or Boston. Meanwhile, the poorer workers moved to south Florida, first settling in Key West, and then in Tampa.

===Constitutional assembly===
On 10 April 1869, a constitutional assembly took place in the town of Guáimaro (Camagüey). It was intended to provide the revolution with greater organizational and juridical unity, with representatives from the areas that had joined the uprising. The assembly discussed whether a centralized leadership should be in charge of both military and civilian affairs, or if there should be a separation between civilian government and military leadership, the latter being subordinate to the first. The overwhelming majority voted for the separation option. Céspedes was elected president of this assembly; and General Ignacio Agramonte y Loynáz and Antonio Zambrana, principal authors of the proposed Constitution, were elected secretaries. After completing its work, the Assembly reconstituted itself as the House of Representatives and the state&#x27;s supreme power. They elected Salvador Cisneros Betancourt as president, Miguel Gerónimo Gutiérrez as vice president, and Agramonte and Zambrana as secretaries. Céspedes was elected on 12 April 1869, as the first president of the Republic in Arms and General Manuel de Quesada (who had fought in Mexico under Benito Juárez during the French invasion of that country), as Chief of the Armed Forces.

===Spanish repressions===
By early 1869, the Spanish authorities had failed to reach an agreement with the insurrection forces. Harsher measures to repress the insurrection and its supporters were taken, and troops began to flood in from the Peninsula.

Apart from the regular army, the government relied on the Voluntary Corps, a militia created in 1855 a few years earlier to face the announced invasion by John A. Quitman in collaboration with Ramón Pintó. By early-1869 more than 70,000 men, both &quot;peninsulares&quot; and creoles had joined the Volunteers. In the big cities, the Volunteers were used to keep public order in the cities, earning some notoriety for their lack of discipline and harsh acts of repression against independence supporters. Its forces executed eight students from the University of Havana on 27 November 1871. The corps seized the steamship &quot;Virginius&quot; in international waters on 31 October 1873. Starting on 4 November, its forces executed 53 persons, including the captain, most of the crew, and a number of Cuban insurgents on board. The serial executions were stopped only by the intervention of a British man-of-war under the command of Sir Lambton Lorraine. 

Apart from their controversial role in the cities, hundreds of Volunteer units were created in the countryside. Most of the Volunteers there were Cubans loyal to Spain who organised sections and companies to defend their hometowns from rebel attacks, giving a tone of civil war to Cuba&#x27;s first war of independence. According to a Spanish journalist, by 1872, 52,000 of the 80,000 Volunteers were Cuban-born.

In the so-called &quot;Creciente de Valmaseda&quot; incident, the corps captured farmers (Guajiros) and the families of Mambises, killing them immediately or sending them &quot;en masse&quot; to concentration camps on the island. The Mambises fought using guerrilla tactics and were more effective on the eastern side of the island than in the west, where they lacked supplies.

Another Voluntary Corps was formed by Germans, the so-called &quot;Club des Alemanes&quot;. Presided by Fernando Heydrich, a committee of German merchants and landowners created a troop to defend their possessions in 1870. A neutral force initially, as ordered by Otto von Bismarck in a telegram to consul Luis Will, they were considered to favor the government.

===Rebel political strife===
Ignacio Agramonte was killed by a stray bullet on 11 May 1873, and was replaced in the command of the central troops by Máximo Gómez. Because of political and personal disagreements and Agramonte&#x27;s death, the Assembly deposed Céspedes as president, replacing him with Cisneros. Agramonte had realized that his dream Constitution and government were ill-suited to the Cuban Republic in Arms, which was the reason he quit as secretary and assumed command of the Camaguey region. He became a supporter of Cespedes. Céspedes was later surprised and killed on 27 February 1874, by a swift-moving patrol of Spanish troops. The new Cuban government had left him with only one escort and denied permission to leave Cuba for the US, from where he intended to help prepare and send armed expeditions.

===Continued warfare===
Activities in the Ten Years&#x27; War peaked in the years 1872 and 1873, but after the deaths of Agramonte and Céspedes, Cuban operations were limited to the regions of Camagüey and Oriente. Gómez began an invasion of Western Cuba in 1875, but the vast majority of slaves and wealthy sugar producers in the region did not join the revolt. After his most trusted general, the American Henry Reeve, was killed in 1876, Gómez ended his campaign.

Spain&#x27;s efforts to fight were hindered by the civil war (Third Carlist War) that broke out in Spain in 1872. When the civil war ended in 1876, the government sent more Spanish troops to Cuba, until they numbered more than 250,000. The severe Spanish measures weakened the liberation forces ruled by Cisneros. Neither side in the war was able to win a single concrete victory, let alone crush the opposing side to win the war, but in the long run Spain gained the upper hand.

=== Failing insurgency ===
The deep divisions among insurgents regarding their organisation of government and the military became more pronounced after the Assembly of Guáimaro, as resulting in the dismissal of Céspedes and Quesada in 1873. The Spanish exploited regional divisions, as well as fears that the slaves of Matanzas would break the weak existing balance between whites and blacks. The Spanish changed their policy towards the Mambises, offering amnesties and reforms.

The Mambises did not prevail for a variety of reasons: lack of organization and resources; lower participation by whites; internal racist sabotage (against Maceo and the goals of the Liberating Army); the inability to bring the war to the western provinces (Havana in particular); and opposition by the US government to Cuban independence. The US sold the latest weapons to Spain, but not to the Cuban rebels.

===Peace negotiations and hold-outs===
Tomás Estrada Palma succeeded Juan Bautista Spotorno as president of the Republic in Arms. Estrada Palma was captured by Spanish troops on 19 October 1877. As a result of successive misfortunes, on 8 February 1878, the constitutional organs of the Cuban government were dissolved; the remaining leaders among the insurgents started negotiating for peace in Zanjón, Puerto Príncipe.
General Arsenio Martínez Campos, in charge of applying the new policy, arrived in Cuba. It took him nearly two years to convince most of the rebels to accept the Pact of Zanjón; it was signed on 10 February 1878, by a negotiating committee. The document contained most of the promises made by Spain.
The Ten Years&#x27; War came to an end, except for the resistance of a small group in Oriente led by General Garcia and Antonio Maceo Grajales, who protested in Los Mangos de Baraguá on 15 March.

== Aftermath ==
===Pact of Zanjón===
Under the terms of the pact, a constitution and a provisional government was set up, but the revolutionary élan was gone. The provisional government convinced Maceo to give up, and with his surrender, the war ended on 28 May 1878. Many of the graduates of the Ten Years&#x27; War became central players in Cuba&#x27;s War of Independence that started in 1895. These include the Maceo brothers, Maximo Gómez, Calixto Garcia and others.

The Pact of Zanjón promised various reforms to improve the financial situation for residents of Cuba. The most significant reform was the manumission of all slaves who had fought for Spain. Abolition of slavery had been proposed by the rebels, and many persons loyal to Spain also wanted to abolish it. Finally in 1880, the Spanish legislature abolished slavery in Cuba and other colonies in a form of gradual abolition. The law required slaves to continue to work for their masters for a number of years, in a kind of indentured servitude, but masters had to pay the slaves for their work. The wages were so low, however, that the freedmen could barely support themselves.

===Remaining tensions===
After the war ended, tensions between Cuban residents and the Spanish government continued for 17 years. This period, called &quot;The Rewarding Truce&quot;, included the outbreak of the Little War (&quot;La Guerra Chiquita&quot;) between 1879 and 1880. Separatists in that conflict became supporters of José Martí, the most passionate of the rebels who chose exile over Spanish rule. Overall, about 200,000 people died in the conflict. Together with a severe economic depression throughout the island, the war devastated the coffee industry, and American tariffs badly damaged Cuban exports.

=== Further legacy ===
Fidel Castro sought to frame the 26th of July Movement as a direct continuation of the anti-colonial struggle of the Ten Years&#x27; War and the War of Independence.

<text>Chonbuk Buffalo () was a South Korean professional football club, based in Jeonbuk. Lasting only one year in the K League, the club was the root of the Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. However, K League and Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors officially considers Chonbuk Buffalo as a different club.

== History ==
Predecessor of Chonbuk Buffalo was established in January 1993 as Wansan Puma FC. Wansan Puma was scheduled to join the 1993 season of K League, but was postponed for one year due to draft boycott.

In 1994, Wansan Puma changed its name to Chonbuk Buffalo. Their one and only season in 1994 saw them gather only 14 points from their 30 matches, winning just three times and finishing last, before the club folded.

<doc id="1056460" wikidata="Q739519" url="?curid=1056460" title="Electronic brakeforce distribution">
<text>Electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies the amount of force applied to each of a vehicle&#x27;s wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc, thus providing intelligent control of both brake balance and overall brake force. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), EBD can apply more or less braking pressure to each wheel in order to maximize stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. Typically, the front end carries more weight and EBD distributes less braking pressure to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause a skid. In some systems, EBD distributes more braking pressure at the rear brakes during initial brake application before the effects of weight transfer become apparent.

==ABS==

Vehicle wheels may lock-up due to excessive wheel torque over tire–road friction forces available, caused by too much hydraulic line pressure. The ABS monitors wheel speeds and releases pressure on individual wheel brake lines, rapidly pulsing individual brakes to prevent lock-up. During heavy braking, preventing wheel lock-up helps the driver maintain steering control. Four channel ABS systems have an individual brake line for each of the four wheels, enabling different braking pressure on different road surfaces. Three channel systems are equipped with a sensor for each wheel, but control the rear brakes as a single unit. For example, less braking pressure is needed to lock a wheel on ice than a wheel that is on bare asphalt. If the left wheels are on asphalt and the right wheels are on ice, during an emergency stop, ABS detects the right wheels are about to lock and reduces braking force on the right front wheel. Four channel systems also reduce brake force on the right rear wheel, while a three channel system would also reduce force on both back wheels. Both systems help avoid lock-up and loss of vehicle control.

==EBD==
As per the technical paper published by Buschmann et al.,
&quot;The job of the EBD as a subsystem of the ABS system is to control the effective adhesion utilization by the rear wheels. The pressure of the rear wheels are approximated to the ideal brake force distribution in a partial braking operation. To do so, the conventional brake design is modified in the direction of rear axle overbraking, and the components of the ABS are used. EBD reduces the strain on the hydraulic brake force proportioning valve in the vehicle. EBD optimizes the brake design with regard to: adhesion utilization; driving stability; wear; temperature stress; and pedal force.&quot;

EBD may work in conjunction with ABS and electronic stability control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. &quot;Yaw&quot; is the vehicle&#x27;s rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects less(more) yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is understeering(oversteering) and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward to the outside of the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.

<text>Eugène Joseph Bozza (4 April 1905 – 28 September 1991) was a French composer and violinist. He was one of the most prolific composers of chamber music for wind instruments. Bozza&#x27;s large ensemble works include five symphonies, operas, ballets, large choral work, wind band music, concertos, and many works for large brass or woodwind ensembles. Outside of France, he is best known for his chamber music, rather than his larger works.

==Biography==
===Childhood and early years (1905–1915)===
Bozza was born in Nice to an Italian musician and a French woman. His father, Umberto Bozza, was a violinist who made his living playing in French casinos along the Mediterranean coast. His mother&#x27;s name was Honoré Molina. With a professional musician for a father, Bozza was exposed to music early on. He began studying the violin with his father when he was only five years old. Under such expert tutelage, Bozza became an outstanding young violinist and would occasionally go with his father to performances and play with the orchestra. In 1915, at the age of ten, Bozza and his father moved to Italy to avoid the turmoil of World War I.

===Formative years (1915–1934)===
In Italy, Bozza studied violin, piano, and solfège in Rome at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. He graduated in 1919 with a diploma as Professor of Violin. Bozza then returned to France and enrolled in the Conservatoire de Paris in 1922 where he studied violin with Édouard Nadaud. After two years of study, he earned the Conservatory&#x27;s Premier Prix for violin and secured the chair of concert master at the Pasdeloup Orchestra in 1925. He married Juliette Arnaud, his first wife, in 1924 and had a son, Pierre, in 1925. After five years of touring Europe with the orchestra, Bozza resigned and returned to the Conservatory to study conducting with Henri Rabaud. His wife once confided that, &quot;In fact, he was haunted by stage fright&quot;. Continuing his pattern of excellence, Bozza ended his study of conducting in 1931 by winning another Premier Prix, this time for conducting. Bozza was hired as the conductor for the Ballets Russes of Monte Carlo where he stayed for only a year before returning the Paris Conservatoire for a third and final time in 1932 to study musical composition. Following another two-year study with Henri Büsser, Bozza again won the Premier Prix for his area.

===Middle years and career (1934–1950)===

Bozza won the Prix de Rome in 1934 for his work &quot;La Légende de Roukmani&quot;, a one-act cantata. As part of the prize, he lived in Rome at the Villa de Medici for the following four years and five months so he could focus on growing as a composer, developing a voice, and honing his art. In Rome, Bozza composed several large-scale works such as his opera &quot;Leonidas&quot;, his &quot;Psalms&quot;, and the &quot;Introduzione and Toccata&quot; for piano and orchestra. He then returned to Paris after being appointed to conduct the Opéra-Comique from 1938 to 1948.

===Academic career and later life (1950–1991)===
In 1950, he was appointed the director of the École Nationale de Musique in Valenciennes and maintained the position until his retirement in 1975. The years spent at the École Nationale were extremely productive for Bozza. He composed many of his books of études and solo works during this time for students and staff at his school. Additionally, he was made a Chevalier of the Légion d’Honneur in 1956. He divorced Juliette Arnaud in the early 1950s. Also during this time he met his second wife, a pianist named Nelly Baude, and they had a daughter, Cécile, who went on to study at the Paris Conservatory and become a harp teacher in Denain. After retirement in 1975, Bozza stayed in Valenciennes and continued to write music. He fell ill late in life and died in Valenciennes aged 86.

== Compositions ==
: See &quot;List of compositions by Eugène Bozza&quot;

Bozza was a prolific composer throughout his life. Beginning in the mid-1930s, he published at least one new work each year until just a few years before his death. Though a trained violinist, Bozza wrote an enormous amount of music for wind instruments during his life. Most of his wind music was composed and published during his time in Valenciennes. There are over 250 known published works as well as a wealth of manuscripts. During a posthumous assessment of the archives of Bozza&#x27;s music over 70 unpublished manuscripts were found as well as several dozen that are no longer in print.

During his studies music in the inter-war period, the musical styles in Paris were moving away from Romanticism and Impressionism and towards the ideas of wit and eclecticism as laid out in Jean Cocteau&#x27;s 1918 manifesto &quot;Le Coq et l’Arlequin&quot;. Cocteau said, &quot;We have had enough clouds, waves, aquaria, watersprites, and nocturnal perfumes&quot;. These ideals of music being sharp, cutting, and always new are present in nearly all of Bozza&#x27;s music. Additionally, Bozza&#x27;s works are widely known to be very sensitive to the techniques of the instrument(s) for which they are written. His style shows many traditions of the French Impressionist school mixed with the fundamental mastery of harmony of Bach. His compositions can be placed within the Neo-Classicist genre which is also populated by Darius Milhaud and Igor Stravinsky.

Another major influence on his compositional style was the result of the cultural infusion, which occurred during and following World War I. Over two million American soldiers were sent to Europe which included roughly 10% African American soldiers. The influx of American and African American soldiers brought new styles and attitudes about music which were assimilated in French culture. This style of music quickly became part of French popular music and Bozza was introduced to it at an early age. Elements of jazz style and harmony are present in many of his works.

Another significant element of Bozza&#x27;s output was educational methods and étude books. During his tenure as director in Valenciennes, Bozza composed at least 18 étude collections for many instruments including violin, double bass, flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, trumpet, horn, and trombone. This compositional history lends itself as a partial explanation to the popularity of Bozza&#x27;s music in academic institutions.

===Important works===
An unaccompanied work for solo flute, &quot;Image&quot; is a substantial piece that showcases many elements of flute technique including extreme registral and timbral changes and flutter tongue. 

The &quot;Concerto for Clarinet and Chamber Orchestra&quot; is a three-movement work and one of 19 concertos written by Bozza. 

Bozza created a wide repertoire of music for Bassoon. &quot;Recit, Sicilienne, et Rondo&quot; is a solo piece with piano accompaniment that explores both the high and low range of the bassoon. Due to its technical demands and lyrical melodies, this piece is a mainstay of the conservatory repertoire for bassoon. 

&quot;Aria&quot;, a piece written for alto saxophone and piano, draws inspiration from the works of J. S. Bach, especially the &quot;Manual for the Fantasy in F&quot; and the &quot;Pastorale in F Major&quot; (BWV 590). It is one of his most frequently played works for saxophone and is also available in an edition for clarinet. The piece was written during Bozza&#x27;s stay in Rome at the Villa de Medici for French saxophonist Marcel Mule. Some of the lore around this piece says that it was written very quickly after Bozza was questioned about how much he had accomplished in the first few months in Rome.

&quot;Nuages&quot; for saxophone quartet is indicative of the Impressionistic side of Bozza. This scherzo focuses on the image of clouds and showcases masterful technique on the saxophone. Written in 1946, this piece comes from his time as the director of the Paris Opéra Comique and had the best instrumentalists available to him. 

In his horn solo, &quot;En forêt&quot;, the Impressionistic technique of planing can be seen in the piano part combined with a solo part that is masterfully written for the instrument. Bozza also reminds us of the horn&#x27;s roots as hunting horns with frequent calls and responses. This piece is one of the mainstays of the solo horn repertoire as well as one of the most difficult pieces overall.

&quot;New Orleans&quot; for bass trombone and piano is a solo work written in 1962 for bass saxhorn. Since that instrument has fallen to obscurity, this solo is now frequently played on bass trombone or tuba. Influenced heavily by the jazz culture of New Orleans, this piece explores many styles that might be heard walking around the city such as ragtime and dixieland. This piece is a major element of the bass trombone solo repertoire and is often called upon for auditions.

Bozza&#x27;s &quot;Concertino for Tuba and Orchestra&quot; represents a significant addition to the major solo repertoire for the Tuba.

==Reception==
Though he spent much of his life in the central and southern large population centers of Paris and Valenciennes, many of Bozza&#x27;s stage works were premiered in Lille, located in northeastern France. His work transcended the metropolitan mentality and he felt the music would be well served in this more pastoral area. His large works—such as symphonies, concertos, and operas—are largely unknown outside of central Europe, but his solo and chamber works are fixtures in music schools throughout the world.

Bozza&#x27;s music has largely been a critical and popular success. His style was normally highly accessible to listeners, students, and academics; and he composed such a mass of solo and chamber music that his name is commonly heard in studios. Norman Heim, professor of clarinet at the University of Maryland, may have encapsulated the success of Bozza&#x27;s work with this:

&quot;He is a performer&#x27;s composer, in that the music is well written for the instrument, is challenging to play and enjoyable to rehearse. He is the listener&#x27;s composer since the music is always interesting, and has a familiarity of melody and tonality that even the untrained ear can enjoy.&quot;

A testament to the universality of his music is that when Bozza died at midnight on 28 September 1991, his woodwind quintet &quot;Scherzo&quot; was being played on Belgian Radio at the request of a listener.

Bozza remains frequently played and recorded today (Naxos Music Library lists 126 albums with recordings of his works and a YouTube search for Bozza yields thousands of videos). However, for whatever reason, very little has been written about his life, especially the earlier years. Reference works such as the Grove Music Dictionary have very short entries or sometimes no entries at all. Most modern writing about his past cites a single dissertation, published in 1978, by Denise Rogers Rowen about his bassoon music.

<doc id="1056464" wikidata="Q1208723" url="?curid=1056464" title="Diamond Rio">
<text>Diamond Rio is an American country music band from Nashville, Tennessee. The band consists of Marty Roe (lead vocals, guitar), Jimmy Olander (lead guitar, banjo), Dan Truman (keyboards), Dana Williams (bass guitar, vocals), Micah Schweinsberg (drums), and Carson McKee (fiddle, mandolin, vocals). The band was founded in 1982 as an attraction for the Opryland USA theme park in Nashville, Tennessee, and was originally known as the Grizzly River Boys, then the Tennessee River Boys. It was founded by vocalists Matt Davenport, Danny Gregg, and Ty Herndon, the last of whom became a solo artist in the mid-1990s. After undergoing several membership changes in its initial years, the band held the same membership from 1989 to 2023, which consisted of Roe, Olander, Truman, Williams, Brian Prout (drums), and Gene Johnson (fiddle, mandolin, vocals). After the latter two retired in 2022, they were respectively replaced by Schweinsberg and McKee.

Diamond Rio was signed to Arista Nashville in 1991 and debuted with the single &quot;Meet in the Middle&quot;, which made them the first band ever to send a debut single to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. The band charted 32 more singles between then and 2006, including four more that reached No. 1: &quot;How Your Love Makes Me Feel&quot; (1997), &quot;One More Day&quot; (2001), &quot;Beautiful Mess&quot; (2002), and &quot;I Believe&quot; (2003).

Diamond Rio has recorded nine studio albums, four Greatest Hits compilations, and an album of Christmas music. Three of the band&#x27;s albums have achieved RIAA platinum certification in the United States. In addition, Diamond Rio has received four Group of the Year awards from the Country Music Association, two Top Vocal Group awards from the Academy of Country Music, and one Grammy Award. The band is known for its vocal harmonies, varied instrumentation, and near-exclusive use of only its own band members on recordings instead of session musicians. Their sound was originally defined by mainstream country, bluegrass, and rock influences, but later albums drew more influence from Christian country music and country pop.

==Beginnings==

In 1982, Matt Davenport and Danny Gregg founded a band at Opryland USA, a former country music-based amusement park in Nashville, Tennessee. The band was first named the Grizzly River Boys, after a new river rafting ride at the park, but quickly changed names to the Tennessee River Boys due to its members disliking the original name. Originally intended to promote the park through a one-time television special, the band proved popular enough that it became one of many regular performers there. Davenport, Gregg, and Ty Herndon alternated as lead vocalists, with Davenport also playing bass guitar and Gregg on rhythm guitar; completing the lineup were Larry Beard (lead guitar, fiddle, banjo), Mel Deal (steel guitar), Al DeLeonibus (piano), and Ed Mummert (drums). The group &quot;swapped lead voices, told jokes, and balanced old-school country concert shtick with a contemporary sound&quot;. Herndon left the group in 1983 to compete on the talent show &quot;Star Search&quot;, and became a solo artist for Epic Records between 1995 and the early 2000s. Herndon was temporarily replaced by Anthony Crawford and then Virgil True before his role was taken over by Marty Roe, who had originally toured nationally with the Christian band Windsong, and worked in the park by doing impersonations of Larry Gatlin. Following Herndon&#x27;s departure, DeLonibus and Mummert quit as well, with Dan Truman (who had previously played in Brigham Young University&#x27;s Young Ambassadors) and Jimmy &quot;J. J.&quot; Whiteside taking their places. Beard quit shortly afterward and ultimately became a session musician, and former Mel McDaniel sideman Jimmy Olander took his place. The band, through the assistance of Bill Anderson&#x27;s drummer Len &quot;Snuffy&quot; Miller, submitted demos to various Nashville record labels with no success.

By 1985, the Tennessee River Boys had quit working at Opryland. According to Roe, while the band enjoyed playing at the park, they also felt that their status as a theme park attraction discredited them as &quot;real musicians&quot; to those in the Nashville community. For the next few years, they played at small venues, such as high school auditoriums, and usually worked no more than four concerts a month. They also competed on &quot;Star Search&quot;, but were eliminated in the first round. Frustrated by the sporadic touring schedules, Whiteside quit the group and was replaced by Brian Prout, who previously performed in Hot Walker Band and Heartbreak Mountain. Around 1986, Deal and Gregg both left the group, the latter due to health complications from a serious illness he had developed as a teenager. They initially chose to operate as a quintet, with Davenport as the sole lead vocalist and Roe and Prout singing harmony; when this arrangement proved unsuccessful, they found mandolinist Gene Johnson, a former member of the bluegrass group Eddie Adcock&#x27;s IInd Generation, which Olander was a fan of as a child. Johnson debuted at a concert in Clewiston, Florida, in May 1987. Also at this point, the band members supplemented their incomes with outside jobs: Johnson continued to work in carpentry, Olander and Roe mowed lawns, and Prout drove tour buses.

In 1988, the band caught the attention of Keith Stegall, a singer-songwriter who would later become known primarily for his work as Alan Jackson&#x27;s record producer. Stegall produced demos for the Tennessee River Boys, but noted that Davenport could not record the lead vocal and bass parts at the same time, as they would be difficult to separate in the control room. As a result, Stegall had Roe sing a &quot;scratch&quot; vocal track live with the other musicians, which would then be replaced by Davenport&#x27;s voice in post-production. Upon hearing Roe sing the &quot;scratch&quot; track, Stegall successfully convinced the other members that Roe should be the lead vocalist instead. Due to his discomfort outside the lead role and his wife&#x27;s dissatisfaction with his career, Davenport quit in late 1988, becoming the last founding member to leave. The group quickly had to find a replacement, as they were scheduled to appear on the talk show &quot;Nashville Now&quot; on January 23, 1989. Alan LeBeouf, who had just left Baillie &amp; the Boys, expressed interest in replacing Davenport but ultimately declined due to other commitments. They finally chose Dana Williams, a nephew of the bluegrass group Osborne Brothers and former sideman for Jimmy C. Newman, who had been a fan of the Tennessee River Boys since Herndon was a member.

===1990: Signing with Arista Nashville===
Williams officially joined before the &quot;Nashville Now&quot; appearance, but the band still did not have a record deal at this point. They continued to record demos in Prout&#x27;s garage with assistance from Monty Powell, who had previously hired Roe and Olander for recording jingles, but wanted to produce commercial music. Powell was a friend of audio engineer Mike Clute, who would later become one of the band&#x27;s producers, and songwriters Tim DuBois and Van Stephenson. DuBois was talking with record executive Clive Davis about creating a country music branch of Arista Records called Arista Nashville; Stephenson would later sign to the label in 1993 as a member of Blackhawk. Initially, DuBois was hesitant about signing the Tennessee River Boys, as he felt that there were too many popular bands in country music, and he was about to sign both Asleep at the Wheel and Exile. He expressed interest in signing Roe as a solo artist, but at Powell&#x27;s insistence, he agreed to see the band open for George Jones at a May 1989 concert, and officially signed them to Arista Nashville in 1990. The band members also decided to choose a new name, as they thought that Tennessee River Boys sounded more suitable for a bluegrass or gospel group than a country one. Among the names they had chosen were Kilroy and T-Town Mavericks, the latter of which was rejected by Arista executives. Prout suggested Diamond Rio, after the truck manufacturing company Diamond Reo Trucks. The name had been previously rejected by another country band, Shenandoah, whose lead singer Marty Raybon (also a former member of Heartbreak Mountain) gave Prout permission to use the name even though Shenandoah &quot;conducted business&quot; under that name.

Shortly after the band received its record deal, the band underwent a series of misfortunes when Olander, Johnson, and Williams came down with health problems. On August 9, 1990, Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday, severely cutting his left thumb. Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band&#x27;s tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne. On September 6, four weeks after Johnson&#x27;s accident, Williams was water skiing with his family in Cookeville, Tennessee, as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up. The propeller slashed Williams&#x27; legs, and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries. Brian Helgos and Paul Gregg (Danny Gregg&#x27;s brother, and a member of Restless Heart) substituted for Williams. Meanwhile, Olander discovered that he had a lemon-sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus. The tumor was never successfully diagnosed, although it ultimately vanished.

==Musical career==

===1991–1992: &quot;Diamond Rio&quot;===
After Olander, Williams, and Johnson had recovered, the six musicians set to work on their debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon discovered that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, to the point that they occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.

Arista Nashville released Diamond Rio&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Meet in the Middle&quot;, on February 6, 1991. As the lead single to their self-titled debut album, &quot;Meet in the Middle&quot; went on to spend two weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts, making Diamond Rio the first country music group ever to send its debut single to the top of that chart. Following its release, the band performed its first official concert as Diamond Rio on May 4, 1991. They shared the bill with Wild Rose, whose membership included Prout&#x27;s then-wife, Nancy Given Prout. Released three weeks later with DuBois and Powell as producers, &quot;Diamond Rio&quot; was met with positive critical reception from critics such as Allmusic, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, which praised the band&#x27;s vocal harmonies, instrumentation, and song choices.

Four more singles were released from &quot;Diamond Rio&quot;, all reaching top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts: &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Forget to Pray for Me&quot;, &quot;Norma Jean Riley&quot; (which was previously the B-side of &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Forget to Pray for Me&quot;), and &quot;Nowhere Bound&quot;, the latter two of which were co-written by Powell. Roe and Prout had found both &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Forget to Pray for Me&quot; and &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; by attending shows at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, a popular spot for performances by aspiring songwriters. Truman and an employee of Arista had found &quot;Norma Jean Riley&quot;, which was originally titled &quot;Pretty Little Lady&quot; until DuBois remarked that the lady in the song should have a name: &quot;It could be &#x27;Norma Jean Riley&#x27;, anything!&quot; Johnson spoke positively about &quot;Mama Don&#x27;t Forget to Pray for Me&quot;, which was written and originally recorded by Larry Cordle, and the impact that it had on fans. He recalled a letter sent to him by a female fan who had run away from home and chose to return after hearing that song, and said that &quot;We already didn&#x27;t wanna do the drinkin&#x27; songs and stuff ... if you&#x27;re gonna touch someone, touch them with something that&#x27;s positive.&quot;

&quot;Diamond Rio&quot; was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping one million copies in the United States. In addition, the band won the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s Top Vocal Group for 1992, an award they would receive again in 1993, 1994, and 1997. They were also nominated for Top New Vocal Duet or Group by the same association in 1992. A cut from the album, the instrumental &quot;Poultry Promenade&quot;, gave the band its first Grammy Award nomination.

===1992–1995: &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; and &quot;Love a Little Stronger&quot;===
&quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, the group&#x27;s second album, was released in 1992. Certified gold by the RIAA for U.S. shipments of 500,000 copies, the album produced the Top 5 country hits &quot;In a Week or Two&quot; and &quot;Oh Me, Oh My, Sweet Baby&quot;, the latter of which was originally recorded by George Strait on his 1989 album &quot;Beyond the Blue Neon&quot;. The next singles, &quot;This Romeo Ain&#x27;t Got Julie Yet&quot; and &quot;Sawmill Road&quot;, both failed to reach top 10. Roe considered &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it; in a 1994 interview with &quot;New Country&quot; magazine, he stated: &quot;There aren&#x27;t ten great songs out there for everybody, certainly not that you could find in a 30-day period of time.&quot; Olander was also critical of the novelty factor of &quot;This Romeo Ain&#x27;t Got Julie Yet&quot;, which he co-wrote, saying that it was &quot;by far not my favorite Diamond Rio recording – but that&#x27;s at the time when I&#x27;m thinkin&#x27;, &#x27;Oh, this is easy, let&#x27;s write this. It&#x27;s kinda cute.&#x27;&quot; Brian Mansfield of Allmusic was also critical of the song, but described the rest of the album with favor, saying that its &quot;strongest material emphasizes the virtues of God, family and honest living – traditional stuff, no doubt influenced by the members&#x27; bluegrass background&quot;, while Jack Hurst of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; thought that &quot;In a Week or Two&quot; and &quot;Sawmill Road&quot;, &quot;which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood&quot;, were the strongest tracks.

In 1994, the band released its third album, &quot;Love a Little Stronger&quot;. The album was recorded on a more relaxed schedule than the previous album; as a result, they did not have a single on the charts for three months after &quot;Sawmill Road&quot; fell off the charts. For this album, Clute joined DuBois and Powell as co-producer, a role that he has held on all of the band&#x27;s subsequent releases. The title track (co-written by Billy Crittenden, later a member of the vocal group 4 Runner), reached a peak of No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles charts, and No. 1 on the country singles chart published by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. It was followed by the No. 9 hit &quot;Night Is Fallin&#x27; in My Heart&quot;, originally recorded by J. P. Pennington in 1991. Next were the Top 20 hits &quot;Bubba Hyde&quot; and &quot;Finish What We Started&quot;. Because the band had taken a longer period of time to choose songs for &quot;Love a Little Stronger&quot;, they considered it a superior album to its predecessor; Mansfield shared a similar opinion in his review of the album, stating that &quot;Spurred by the relatively lackluster performance of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; ... Diamond Rio explored the musical possibilities of its talents rather than digging for easy commercial success.&quot; Bob Cannon of &quot;New Country&quot; was more mixed, saying that &quot;the production on &quot;Love a Little Stronger&quot; is so sparkling clean it could&#x27;ve been recorded in an operating room.&quot; This album also earned the band its second platinum certification.

===1996–1999: &quot;IV&quot;, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, and &quot;Unbelievable&quot;===

&quot;IV&quot;, Diamond Rio&#x27;s fourth album, was released in 1996. It was the &quot;first country release recorded entirely on a digital console&quot;; specifically, a Fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive. Produced by DuBois, Clute, and the band itself, it was also their first album not to have Powell as a co-producer. According to DuBois, Powell left this role on good terms, as he &quot;saw a need to go in a certain direction, and the guys saw a need to go in a different direction.&quot; Roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters. He recalled to &quot;Billboard&quot; that the label&#x27;s head of artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) recommended the lead single &quot;Walkin&#x27; Away&quot; while co-writer Craig Wiseman (who co-wrote &quot;Bubba Hyde&quot;) was still recording its demo, and the band was able to record the song in the same day that the demo was completed. &quot;Walkin&#x27; Away&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the country charts in early 1996. Three more singles were released from the album: the top 10 hits &quot;That&#x27;s What I Get for Lovin&#x27; You&quot; and &quot;Holdin&#x27;&quot; (also written by Wiseman), with the top 20 &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Head&quot;, co-written by Van Stephenson, in between. The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Head&quot; featured Martin Sheen and Ramon Estevez, the former playing the part of a snake handling preacher.

A year after &quot;IV&quot;, Diamond Rio released its first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package, which included eleven of the singles from their first four albums, plus the album cut &quot;She Misses Him on Sunday the Most&quot; from &quot;IV&quot; and two new songs: &quot;How Your Love Makes Me Feel&quot; and &quot;Imagine That&quot;. &quot;How Your Love Makes Me Feel&quot; became the band&#x27;s second No 1 on Hot Country Songs, as well as their longest-lasting at three weeks, making it the biggest chart hit for any country group that year. &quot;Imagine That&quot;, co-written by Bryan White, reached Top 5 by early 1998. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; became the band&#x27;s third platinum album.

Diamond Rio was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in April 1998, becoming the first band in fourteen years to be inducted. Later in the year, the band released its fifth studio album, &quot;Unbelievable&quot;. Contributing songwriters to the album included Paul Williams, former NRBQ member Al Anderson, Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, and Huey Lewis. The lead single was the ballad &quot;You&#x27;re Gone&quot;, which reached top 5 on the country charts. After it was the title track, which peaked at No. 2 on the country charts and became the band&#x27;s first entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it reached No. 36. The third and final single was &quot;I Know How the River Feels&quot;, originally recorded on Herndon&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Living in a Moment&quot; and later released as a single by McAlyster in 2000. Diamond Rio&#x27;s rendition peaked at 33 on the country charts, their lowest chart peak at the time.

In 1998, Prout began dating Mary Bono, the widow of singer and politician Sonny Bono. The two became engaged but later ended their relationship in 2001. On December 28 of the same year, Prout married singer-songwriter Stephanie Bentley, best known for co-writing Faith Hill&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Breathe&quot;.

===2000–2002: &quot;One More Day&quot;===
Diamond Rio released its twenty-third official chart single, &quot;Stuff&quot;, in May 2000. The song was originally intended to be the title track to their sixth studio album, which would have been released on August 22 of the same year, but according to Truman, &quot;Certain radio stations, for some reason, didn&#x27;t want to play &#x27;Stuff&#x27;.&quot; As a result, &quot;Stuff&quot; was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts, and the album was delayed until February 2001. Following this song&#x27;s failure, the band released &quot;One More Day&quot; later in 2000. The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby Tomberlin, the same two writers who wrote &quot;She Misses Him on Sunday the Most&quot;. &quot;One More Day&quot; went on to spend two non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the country charts, with the album, by this point re-titled &quot;One More Day&quot;, having its release date moved up to February 6, 2001. The song also peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts (the band&#x27;s first appearance on that chart). Regarding the song&#x27;s popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses, Prout said, &quot;Actually, &#x27;One More Day&#x27; was recorded as a love song. Then one of Oklahoma State&#x27;s basketball team&#x27;s plane went down, then in early 2001 we lost Dale [Earnhardt] in Daytona, and then of course, 9/11 came after that. And every event of that year, the song took on a different meaning to different people ... We hear quite often in e-mails and people talking to us in shows. If you&#x27;re asking how it makes us feel? Pretty darn special ... to know that you had that impact on someone&#x27;s life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope.&quot;

The third and fourth singles from &quot;One More Day&quot; were less successful: &quot;Sweet Summer&quot; made Top 20, while &quot;That&#x27;s Just That&quot; failed to make Top 40. The album featured a guest vocal from Chely Wright on &quot;I&#x27;m Trying&quot;, making for the band&#x27;s first ever duet with another artist on one of their own albums. It also included a cover of &quot;Hearts Against the Wind&quot;, originally recorded by JD Souther and Linda Ronstadt for the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; soundtrack. Chris Neal of &quot;Country Weekly&quot; thought that the album showed a greater musical variety than its predecessors, specifically noting the &quot;spoken-word verses&quot; of &quot;Here I Go Fallin&#x27;&quot;, the &quot;Hearts Against the Wind&quot; cover, and the Wright duet as standout tracks. Rick Cohoon of Allmusic cited the album&#x27;s singles and the Wright duet as the album&#x27;s best tracks, adding that &quot;If any flaw can be found here it would be the band&#x27;s choice not to experiment with new sound, but then again, why tamper with a good thing?&quot;

Starting in 2001, the other members had noticed that Roe was having difficulty maintaining proper pitch in concert. Although they did not want to confront him about it for fear of &quot;bruis[ing] his ego&quot;, they eventually convinced Roe of his problems by listening to concert recordings together. Roe also consulted unsuccessfully with vocal coaches and throat doctors at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The band attempted to cover up Roe&#x27;s problems by removing certain songs from concert set lists, lowering the key on others, having Truman sometimes take the lead vocal, and using pitch correction software, but even these did not fully correct the issues. Finally, they consulted vocal coach Diane Sheets, a friend of Johnson&#x27;s son-in-law. She determined that Roe was over-compensating for a small degree of hearing loss typical of musicians who have performed live for long periods of time, thus tightening muscles in his throat and diaphragm and causing him to lose pitch. Although Roe was initially &quot;cynical&quot; toward Sheets&#x27;s coaching, she was ultimately successful in restoring his voice.

===2002–2007: &quot;Completely&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t You Tell&quot;, and &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot;===
In 2002, Diamond Rio released its seventh studio album, &quot;Completely&quot;. The band originally conceived it as a double album, featuring traditional country on one disc and more pop-oriented country on the other, but according to Prout, this concept did not fully materialize because &quot;country music has blinders on as far as what&#x27;s acceptable – and what isn&#x27;t&quot;, although Olander and Williams noted that the idea allowed them &quot;more leeway in choosing songs&quot;. In addition to earning a gold certification, it produced two consecutive No. 1 singles in &quot;Beautiful Mess&quot; and &quot;I Believe&quot;, the latter being the band&#x27;s last single to top Hot Country Songs. Third single &quot;Wrinkles&quot; made Top 20, while the last single, &quot;We All Fall Down&quot; (also written by Steven Dale Jones), failed to reach top 40. Two of the album&#x27;s tracks were previously recorded by other artists: &quot;Make Sure You&#x27;ve Got It All&quot;, written by Bill Anderson and Steve Wariner, was originally recorded on Collin Raye&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;The Walls Came Down&quot;, and &quot;If You&#x27;d Like Some Lovin&#x27;&quot; by its co-writer, David Ball, on his 1996 album &quot;Starlite Lounge&quot;.

Rick Cohoon of Allmusic praised the album for its musical variety, saying, &quot;With artists as well anchored in the business as Diamond Rio, the musical quality is a given. The real challenge is outdoing yourself and coming up with fresh concepts. The selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal&quot;. He cited &quot;Beautiful Mess&quot; and &quot;I Believe&quot; as standout tracks. Ray Waddell of &quot;Billboard&quot; also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album, while highlighting the instrumental track &quot;Rural Philharmonic&quot; (which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album) as an example of the band&#x27;s strong musicianship. Chrissie Dickinson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was less favorable, commending the &quot;masterful musicianship&quot; and Roe&#x27;s &quot;light vocal timbre&quot;, while criticizing the song selections as &quot;mostly a paint-by-numbers trip around the musical block, from the predictable power balladry of &#x27;I Believe&#x27; to the saccharine sentiments of &#x27;We All Fall Down.&#x27;&quot;

A seventh album, tentatively titled &quot;Can&#x27;t You Tell&quot;, was recorded in 2003, but it was cancelled after its first two singles – the title track and &quot;One Believer&quot; – both failed to make Top 40 upon their releases in late 2004 and early 2005 respectively. Diamond Rio&#x27;s second Greatest Hits package, &quot;Greatest Hits II&quot;, was released in 2006. Like their first Greatest Hits album, this compilation included several new songs as well as the band&#x27;s greatest hits; one of these new songs, &quot;God Only Cries&quot;, was released as a single, peaking at No. 30. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Diamond Rio parted ways with Arista Nashville.

===2007–present: New record label, &quot;The Reason&quot;, and &quot;I Made It&quot;===
On August 31, 2007, Diamond Rio signed with Word Records, a Christian music label based in Nashville. Their first album for Word was a Christmas album entitled &quot;A Diamond Rio Christmas: The Star Still Shines&quot;, which they recorded in Olander&#x27;s basement studio. Roe said in an interview with CMT that &quot;we just didn&#x27;t try to copy anybody else. We tried to make up our own arrangements.&quot; The group released its first contemporary Christian album, &quot;The Reason&quot;, on September 22, 2009. It earned the band three Dove Award nominations: Song of the Year for &quot;God Is There&quot;, Country Song of the Year for the title track, and Country Album of the Year.

In 2014, Olander told &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; that the group was no longer signed to Word Records and planned to release new material independently. &quot;I will say that I was proud of the material, but maybe it&#x27;s not the best version of Diamond Rio,&quot; Olander told the publication. &quot;We were kind of in a no-man&#x27;s land. We didn&#x27;t fit in with country radio and we didn&#x27;t fit with Christian radio. It was something that wasn&#x27;t fully realized.&quot; The band began releasing records independently, starting with a live album in 2014 and following in 2015 with the studio album &quot;I Made It&quot;.

Prout and Johnson both retired from the band in 2022. Micah Schweinsberg filled in on drums, and Carson McKee on harmony vocals, mandolin, and fiddle, for a series of concerts in 2022. Said tour, focused on songs from their 2007 Christmas album, was the band&#x27;s first since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Schweinsberg and McKee both became official members of the band in mid-2023, making McKee the band&#x27;s first female member. The first single following their addition to the lineup, an instrumental called &quot;The Kick&quot;, was released soon after.

===Outside contributions===
Diamond Rio has been featured on several projects featuring multiple country artists, including three tribute albums released between 1993 and 1994. The first was a cover of the Eagles&#x27; 1975 hit &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot; for &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot;, an album released in late 1993 via Giant Records which featured various country musicians covering that band&#x27;s songs. Diamond Rio had originally wanted to record the song for &quot;Love a Little Stronger&quot;, but DuBois rejected the idea because he felt that they were not yet well-established enough to record a cover song on one of their own albums. The second was &quot;Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album&quot;, to which they contributed a cover of Keith Whitley&#x27;s 1986 hit &quot;Ten Feet Away&quot;, and the third was a cover of Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;Workin&#x27; Man Blues&quot; for a tribute album entitled &quot;Mama&#x27;s Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard&quot;. This rendition, which featured guest appearances from Lee Roy Parnell and Steve Wariner (both of whom were also signed to Arista Nashville at the time), was credited to &quot;Jed Zeppelin&quot;. The song peaked at No. 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts from unsolicited airplay, and was made into a music video. In 1996, the band covered &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; for the multi-artist compilation &quot;The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney&quot; and contributed the original song &quot;Christmas Spirit&quot; (which Powell and Roe co-wrote) to &quot;Star of Wonder: Country Christmas Collection&quot;, a Christmas album featuring various artists on Arista Nashville&#x27;s roster. A year later, Diamond Rio contributed a recording of the gospel standard &quot;Walkin&#x27; in Jerusalem&quot; to a compilation entitled &quot;Peace in the Valley: A Country Music Journey Through Gospel Music&quot;. Diamond Rio and Collin Raye also sang backing vocals on Kenny Rogers&#x27; 2000 single &quot;He Will, She Knows&quot;. In 2002, the band was featured on country parodist Cledus T. Judd&#x27;s &quot;Man of Constant Borrow&quot;, a parody of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; on his album &quot;Cledus Envy&quot;. Jerrod Niemann&#x27;s late-2017 album &quot;This Ride&quot; features Diamond Rio on the song &quot;I Ain&#x27;t All There&quot;.

Some of the individual members have also contributed to songs by other artists. Roe sang duet vocals with then-labelmate Pam Tillis on &quot;Love Is Only Human&quot;, a cut from her 1992 album &quot;Homeward Looking Angel&quot;. Olander was featured along with bluegrass musicians Carl Jackson and Mark O&#x27;Connor on the track &quot;Hap Towne Breakdowne&quot; from Steve Wariner&#x27;s 1996 instrumental album &quot;No More Mr. Nice Guy&quot;. He also co-wrote Kenny Chesney&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;I Lost It&quot;, Marshall Dyllon&#x27;s 2001 single &quot;You&quot;, and the track &quot;The Night Before (Life Goes On)&quot; from Carrie Underwood&#x27;s 2005 debut album &quot;Some Hearts&quot;. Truman co-wrote Shane Minor&#x27;s 1999 single &quot;Ordinary Love&quot;; Minor would later co-write the band&#x27;s hit &quot;Beautiful Mess&quot;. In 2003, Truman and songwriter Jason Deere co-founded the Nashville Tribute Band, which has recorded three albums for missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, of which Truman is a member. Roe, Johnson, and Williams sang backing vocals on Josh Turner&#x27;s 2006 single &quot;Me and God&quot; (from the album &quot;Your Man&quot;), which also featured a guest vocal from bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley.

==Musical stylings==
In the country music industry particularly, record producers hire mostly session musicians to record instrumental tracks for an album for both solo artists and bands, as opposed to rock bands who record their own instrumental and vocal tracks on their albums. Diamond Rio has been one of few self-contained country bands to have followed the practice of each member playing their own instruments and singing their own vocals on all their albums themselves, without any additional input from outside musicians. The sole exception has been the inclusion of string sections on some of their later work, starting with &quot;I Know How the River Feels&quot; and continuing through certain tracks on &quot;One More Day&quot; and &quot;Completely&quot;. According to Prout, other labels had rejected the band prior to their signing with Arista Nashville due to the band members&#x27; insistence that they play all their own instruments.

Their early music blended neotraditionalist country with occasional traces of country rock, primarily in the song&#x27;s prominent rhythm sections. A bluegrass influence has also been shown, primarily in the three-part harmonies among Roe (lead), Williams (baritone), and Johnson (tenor). Bluegrass influences are also shown in the band&#x27;s prominent use of the mandolin, as well as in the instrumentals featured on many of their earlier albums. The band&#x27;s later material has tended towards pop-oriented ballads, such as &quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;One More Day&quot; – songs which received critical acclaim for their often religious-themed messages, but were considered departures from the more traditional material of their first four albums.

Another trademark of Diamond Rio&#x27;s sound is the custom-built B-Bender guitar played by Olander. He refers to this instrument as the &quot;Taxicaster&quot; because of its yellow body and black-and-white checkered pickguard, which give it the coloration of a taxicab.

==Awards==
Diamond Rio received the Academy of Country Music&#x27;s award for Top Vocal Group in 1991 and 1992.

<doc id="1056468" wikidata="Q249668" url="?curid=1056468" title="Whatever (Aimee Mann album)">
<text>Whatever is the first solo album by the American singer-songwriter Aimee Mann, released in 1993.

&quot;I&#x27;ve Had It&quot; is one of the songs featured in Nick Hornby&#x27;s book &quot;31 Songs&quot;. The album, with special note for the song &quot;4th of July&quot;, was included by Elvis Costello in his &quot;Costello&#x27;s 500&quot; list for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. It has also been included in the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die &quot;list.

==Reception==

&quot;Whatever&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. Most praised her sense of melody and the wordplay of her lyrics, exemplified by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in &quot;hooky songs&quot; and &quot;evocative lyrics&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reflected this by saying she &quot;mixes words like a master, catching lifetimes of ache and &quot;Angst&quot;&quot; in her songs while the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; compared her to Elvis Costello. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cited her music as &quot;sunny, surreal melodies&quot; with &quot;razor-sharp lyrics&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Andy Gill highly recommended the album, concluding that &quot;it&#x27;s the tension between Mann&#x27;s disarmingly direct, conversational lyric style and the complexity of her musical design that gives &quot;Whatever&quot; its peculiar charge.&quot; On the other hand, Robert Christgau only cited &quot;Mr. Harris&quot; as a &quot;choice cut&quot;, finding nothing else to say about it.

The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; and in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &quot;150 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
As of February 2001, combined sales for two releases of &quot;Whatever&quot; stood at 170,000 copies sold in United States.

===&quot;Whatever – An Exclusive Collection&quot;===
In 1994, BMG Records in Germany released a limited edition &quot;Whatever – An Exclusive Collection&quot;. This featured a second CD containing previously released B-sides. The cover of the CD was unchanged, there just being a sticker announcing the bonus material. It appears that Aimee was unaware of this release until it was mentioned in the message forum at her website in 2004, her management calling it a bootleg before it being confirmed as an official release.

<doc id="1056472" wikidata="Q2758697" url="?curid=1056472" title="Zaghadia">
<text>Zhagadia (also spelled Jhagadia) is a taluka in Bharuch district in the state of Gujarat, India. Zhagadia is located south of the southern bank of the Narmada River. It is southeast of the historic town ShuklaThirth, where Chanakya apparently lived until he returned to Pataliputra (now Patna). The economy of Zhagadia is dependent on industrial area (GIDC) and the fertile land where bananas, sugar cane, cotton, wheat, sorghum, and other vegetables and fruits are grown and exported. Trade to the interior villages, local government offices, and Seva Rural Hospital and local businesses provide most of the employment.

In Zhagadia is the town Bhalod, on the Narmada riverbank, across from another town, Koral. Bhalod is known for farming bananas, cotton, and sugar cane, although it suffers from a high rate of emigration, primarily to the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and Africa. The town has cultural activities, such as the three-day program of Gangadashahara. During this period, many Brahmins from various parts of Gujarat and elsewhere travel to Bhalod to be &quot;blessed&quot; by their &quot;holy River&quot; Narmada&quot;, in celebration of the &#x27;birth&#x27; of the &quot;holy River&quot; Ganges. Bhalod has a number of temples, including Ramnath Mahadev, Mokshnath Mahadev, Datatrey, Ranchhodnathji &amp; Gayatri Mata.

==Industries==
Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation has developed a megaindustrial estate in Zhagadia. Companies there include: Abbott Laboratories, Saint-Gobain, PepsiCo, United Phosphorus, Gulbrandsen Technologies, Kohler, S. Kumar, Century Textile and Industries, Aarti Industries Limited, BEC Fertilizers Limited, Welspun, Brakes India and Agrotech (an affiliate of ConAgra).

== Education ==
For students too young for high school, the public schools are divided into male and female schools. Zaghadia has an all-female primary and middle school and an all-male primary and middle school. Two high schools serve the local population. The oldest high school is Diwan Dhanji Shah High School, which was founded in 1942 by Diwan of Rajpipla&#x27;s King, a group of concerned citizens in response to the lack of public education in the remote region. The result of their efforts, at least in part, was that the strength of the education program in the 1950s and 1960s was noted throughout Gujarat.

A private school, Manav School, also exists in Zaghadia.

== Tourism ==

Places to visit include: Jain Daherasar, Kabirvad, Gayatri Mandir, Dholi Reservoir, and Hanuman Temple. Trips to banana farms and a ride in bullock cart in fields are popular experiences.

Gumandev, an old temple of the Hindu god Hanuman, is a holy place for Hindus in Bharuch, from Zhagadia.

<doc id="1056473" wikidata="Q1061269" url="?curid=1056473" title="Palawan (island)">
<text>Palawan () is the largest island of the province of Palawan in the Philippines and fifth-largest by area and tenth-most populous island of the country, with a total population of 994,101 as of 2020 census. The northwest coast of the island is along the Palawan Passage in the eastern South China Sea, while the southeast coast forms part of the northern limit of the Sulu Sea. Much of the island remains traditional and is considered by some as under-developed. Abundant wildlife, jungle mountains, and some white sandy beaches attract many tourists, as well as international companies looking for development opportunities.

One city and 12 out of the 23 municipalities of the Province of Palawan are on this island. Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm, one of seven operating units of the Bureau of Corrections, is located on the island.

==Geography==
The entire length of the island forms a mountain range, with a peak altitude of at Mount Mantalingajan. Other significant peaks include Mount Gantung () in Batazara and Victoria Peak () in Narra. Cagayancillo is far to the east of the island, while Dumaran Island and the more distant Cuyo Archipelago are to the northeast, with Linapacan and Busuanga Island nearby in the north-northeast. The archipelago of Kalayaan Municipality is west of Palawan, while Balabac Municipality is south of the island&#x27;s western edge.

===Geology===
The geology of Palawan is, in many ways, unlike other parts of the Philippines. The crust of northeast Palawan was derived from the southeast edge of the continental crust of China, part of the Eurasian Plate. It is the exposed portion of a microcontinent that drifted southward with the opening of the South China Sea. This microcontinent also forms the shallow water north of Palawan in the Reed Bank-Dangerous Ground area of the southern South China Sea. Some of the oldest rocks of the Philippines are found in northeast Palawan (Permian-Carboniferous age). Southwest Palawan exposes primarily ophiolitic material (rocks derived from uplifted oceanic crust and mantle). This 34 Myr old (latest Eocene-earliest Oligocene) ophiolite appears to have been thrust upon the continental crust as well as the older, Cretaceous ophiolitic and sedimentary units. The transition from &quot;oceanic&quot; ophiolite in the southwest to &quot;continental&quot;-type rocks in the northeast occurs in the area of central Palawan around Ulugan Bay and the Sabang area. In the southern coasts of Ulugan Bay and Sabang Beach, are several exposures showing that the Palawan ophiolite has been thrust on to the continent-derived clastic rocks (&quot;Sabang thrust&quot;).

The Palawan Trough is an area of deeper water adjacent to the north coast of Palawan in the South China Sea. The Palawan Trough is thought to exist due to downbending of the continental crust due to the weight of the ophiolite thrust sheet.

Further north, around the Malampaya Sound area and up to the El Nido area, one finds older (Triassic-Jurassic) deep marine chert and limestone. The limestone forms spectacular karst terrain. These units are part of the microcontinent (&quot;North Palawan Block&quot;) although they are deep marine rocks marginal to the continental crust. They were accreted to the Chinese continental crust in the Mesozoic at a time when an Andean-type subduction zone existed in southeast China.

Intruding these rocks in central Palawan (Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle area) and northern Palawan (Mount Capoas or Kapoas area) are young granite bodies (true granite to granodiorite). The Kapoas intrusion is of Miocene age (13-15 million years old based on zircon and monazite U-Pb dating). In the Taytay area of northern Palawan, a young basaltic cinder cone is another manifestation of young magmatic activity. The granitic magmatism and basaltic magmatism are both expressions of what has been identified as a widespread post-South China Sea spreading magmatism that has affected many areas around the South China Sea.

Tectonically, Palawan with the Calamian Islands, is considered to be a north-east extension of the Sunda Plate, in collision with the Philippine Mobile Belt at Mindoro.

==Flora and fauna==
Unlike most of the country, Palawan is biogeographically part of Sundaland, with a fauna and flora
related to that found in Borneo.

===Prehistory===
Two articulated phalanx bones of a tiger, besides another phalanx piece, were found amidst an assemblage of other animal bones and stone tools in Ille Cave near the village of New Ibajay. The other animal fossils were ascribed to macaques, deer, bearded pigs, small mammals, lizards, snakes and turtles. From the stone tools, besides the evidence for cuts on the bones, and the use of fire, it would appear that early humans had accumulated the bones. Additionally, the condition of the tiger subfossils, dated to approximately 12,000 to 9,000 years ago, differed from other fossils in the assemblage, dated to the Upper Paleolithic. The tiger subfossils showed longitudinal fracture of the cortical bone due to weathering, which suggests that they had post-mortem been exposed to light and air. Tiger parts were commonly used as amulets in South and Southeast Asia, so it may be that the tiger parts were imported from elsewhere, as is the case with tiger canine teeth, which were found in Ambangan sites dating to the 10th to 12th centuries in Butuan, Mindanao. On the other hand, the proximity of Borneo and Palawan also makes it likely that the tiger had colonized Palawan from Borneo before the Early Holocene.

Using the work of Von den Driesch, all chosen anatomical features of appendicular elements&#x27; anatomical features which were chosen, besides molars, were measured to distinguish between taxa that had close relationships, and see morphometric changes over ages, though not for pigs or deer. For the latter two, cranial and mandibular elements, besides teeth of deer from Ille Cave were compared with samples of the Philippine brown deer (&quot;Cervus mariannus&quot;), Calamian hog deer (&quot;Axis calamianensis&quot;), and Visayan spotted deer (&quot;Cervus alfredi&quot;), and thus two taxa of deer have been identified from the fossils: &quot;Axis&quot; and &quot;Cervus&quot;. Remains of pigs were compared with the Eurasian (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) and Palawanese wild boar (&quot;Sus ahoenobarbus&quot;). It is known that the Eurasian wild boar was imported as a domesticate to the islands from mainland Southeast Asia to the islands during the Terminal Holocene.

Throughout deposits of the Terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene and Terminal Pleistocene at Ille Cave, elements of deer skeletons are regular, gradually becoming less before vanishing in the Terminal Holocene. One &#x27;large&#x27; and one &#x27;small&#x27; taxon can be easily differentiated by the significant change in size observed in the postcranial elements and dentition. From comparisons of the mesial-distal and labio-lingual measurements of individual fossil teeth and mandibular toothrows with those of surviving deer taxa in the Philippines and other Southeast Asian islands, it appears that the Calamian hog deer is most plausible candidate for the small taxon. The hog deer exists in forest edges and open grassland habitats on the islands of Culion and Busuanga, which during the Pleistocene were part of the landmass of Greater Palawan, but not on Palawan itself nowadays. As for the &#x27;large&#x27; taxon of deer found in the Palawanese fossils, the Philippine brown deer from Luzon appears to be closely matched to them, from dental biometric comparisons which are similar between the latter and extant members of the genus &quot;Cervus&quot; or &quot;Rusa&quot;, particularly the Philippine brown deer (&quot;C. mariannus&quot;) and spotted deer (&quot;C. alfredi&quot;). However, the Philippine brown deer shows significant variation across its range, with populations on Mindanao Island being smaller than those of Luzon. Thus, it is possible that the overlap between the Luzonese brown deer and the archaeological material is coincidental, and that the fossils could belonged to another species of Cervus that had occurred in Palawan, with the taxonomic classification being unresolved.

Thus, it is possible that the overlap between the Luzonese brown deer and the archaeological material is coincidental, and that the fossils could belonged to another species of Cervus that had occurred in Palawan, with the taxonomic classification being unresolved. Otherwise, members of the genus &quot;Cervus&quot; are no longer seen in the region of Palawan.

==History==
In April 2013, a fishing vessel loaded with illegally poached animals ran aground on a coral atoll off the coast of Palawan Island.

In May 2014, armed forces chief of staff General Emmanuel T. Bautista said that Oyster Bay may be developed into a naval base with United States Navy support.

==Culture==
===Language===

More than 50 percent of the residents speak Tagalog. Languages native to the island are Cuyonon (26.27 percent) and Palawano (4.0 percent). Kinaray-a is also present in Palawan, spoken by 19 percent of inhabitants. Before mass immigration to Palawan by various groups of people from Southern Tagalog, Ilocandia, Central Luzon, and Panay, Cuyonon was an established lingua franca among many of Palawan&#x27;s native peoples, including the Agutaynen, Cagayanen, Tagbanua, Palawan, and others. The usage of Cuyonon suddenly dropped during 1990s &amp; the approach of the new millennium, being replaced by the now-majority Tagalog language, the reason for making Palawan part of Southern Tagalog. Tagalog may be usually spoken with Batangas dialect due to its geographical contact with Batangas and Mindoro and Batangueño residents in the island. In the south of Palawan during the occupation of the Sulu Sultanate, Tausug was a lingua franca amongst the minority Islamized ethnic groups, i.e., the Molbog, the Tausug (a non-native ethnic group), the Muslim Palaw&#x27;an, and the migrant Badjao. By the 19th century, Cuyonon had replaced Tausug as a lingua franca. Many local Muslims and barter traders can also speak Sabah Malay.

English is spoken by a majority of the younger (age 20–39) population of Puerto Princesa. It is spoken by a minority in every other area of the province.

<doc id="1056476" wikidata="Q211053" url="?curid=1056476" title="Amalienborg">
<text>Amalienborg () is the official residence for the Danish royal family and is located in Copenhagen. Frederick VIII&#x27;s palace complex has four identical Classical façades, effectively four palaces, with Rococo interiors, laid around an octagonal courtyard (). At the centre is a large equestrian statue of Frederick V. Amalienborg was originally built for four noble families, but after Christiansborg Palace burned in 1794 the royal family bought the palaces and moved in. Over the years various monarchs and their families have lived there, including today&#x27;s King Frederik X and Queen Mary.

==History==
===The first palaces on the site===
The Frederiksstaden district was built on the former grounds of two other palaces. The first palace was called Sophie Amalienborg. It was built by Queen Sophie Amalie, consort to Frederick III, on part of the land which her father-in-law Christian IV had acquired outside of Copenhagen&#x27;s old walled city, now known as the Indre By district, in the early 17th century when he had been king. Other parts of the land were used for Rosenborg Castle, Nyboder, and the new Eastern fortified wall around the old city.

It included a garden, a replacement for the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Garden&quot; which had been located beyond the city&#x27;s western gate &quot;Vesterport&quot;, an area today known as Vesterbro, and which had been destroyed under siege from Sweden in 1659.

Work on the garden began in 1664, and the castle was built from 1669 to 1673. The King died in 1670, and the Queen Dowager lived there until her death on February 20, 1685.

Four years later on April 15, 1689, Sophie Amalie&#x27;s son Christian V celebrated his forty-fourth birthday at the palace with the presentation of a German opera, perhaps the first opera presentation in Denmark, in a specially-built temporary theatre. The presentation was a great success, and it was repeated a few days later on April 19. However, immediately after the start of the second performance a stage decoration caught fire, causing the theatre and the palace to burn to the ground, and about 180 people died.

The King planned to rebuild the palace, whose church, Royal Household and garden buildings were still intact. Ole Rømer headed the preparatory work for the rebuilding of Amalienborg in the early 1690s. In 1694, the King negotiated a deal with the Swedish building master Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, who spent some time in Copenhagen that summer reviewing the property. His drawing and model were completed in 1697. The King, however, found the plans too ambitious and instead began tearing down the existing buildings that same year, with the reclaimed building materials used to build a new Garrison Church.

The second Amalienborg was built by Frederick IV at the beginning of his reign. The second Amalienborg consisted of a summerhouse, a central pavilion with orangeries, and arcades on both side of the pavilion. On one side of the buildings was a French-style garden, and on the other side were military drill grounds. The pavilion had a dining room on the groundfloor. On the upper floor was a salon with a view out to the harbour, the garden and the drill grounds.

===Development of Frederiksstaden by Frederick V===
Amalienborg is the centrepiece of Frederiksstaden, a district that was launched by King Frederick V to commemorate in 1748 the tercentenary of the Oldenburg family&#x27;s ascent to the throne of Denmark, and in 1749 the tercentenary of the coronation of Christian I of Denmark. This development is generally thought to have been the brainchild of Danish Ambassador Plenipotentiary in Paris, Johann Hartwig Ernst, Count von Bernstorff. Heading the project was Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke, one of the most powerful and influential men in the country, with Nicolai Eigtved as royal architect and supervisor.

The project consisted of four identical mansions, built to house four distinguished families of nobility from the royal circles, placed around an octagonal square. These mansions (now called Palaces) form the modern palace of Amalienborg, albeit much modified over the years.
===As a royal residence===
When the Royal Family found themselves homeless after the Christiansborg Palace fire of 1794, the palaces were empty for long periods throughout the year, with the exception of the Brockdorff Palace, which housed the Naval Academy. The noblemen who owned them were willing to part with their mansions for promotion and money, and the Moltke and Schack Palaces were acquired in the course of a few days. Since that date successive royal family members have lived at Amalienborg as a royal residence and kings have lent their names to the four palaces; Christian VII&#x27;s Palace, Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace, Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace and Christian IX&#x27;s Palace.

A colonnade, designed by royal architect Caspar Frederik Harsdorff, was added in 1794–1795 to connect the recently occupied King&#x27;s palace, Moltke Palace, with that of the Crown Prince, Schack&#x27;s Palace.

On the morning of 9 April 1940, the day of the German invasion of Denmark during World War II, Amalienborg palace was the site of an hour-long firefight between the Danish Royal Life Guards and the 2nd Battalion of 308th Infantry Regiment of the German 198th Infantry Division. The firefight ended after Christian X of Denmark called for a ceasefire to spare his country from destruction.

==The four palaces==

According to Eigtved&#x27;s master plans for Frederikstad and the Amalienborg Palaces, the four palaces surrounding the plaza were conceived of as town mansions for the families of chosen nobility. Their exteriors were identical, but interiors differed. The site on which the aristocrats could build was given to them free of charge, and they were further exempted from taxes and duties. The only conditions were that the palaces should comply exactly to the Frederikstad architectural specifications, and that they should be built within a specified time framework.

Building of the palaces on the western side of the square started in 1750. When Eigtved died in 1754 the two western palaces had been completed. The work on the other palaces was continued by Eigtved&#x27;s colleague and rival, Lauritz de Thurah strictly according to Eigtved&#x27;s plans. The palaces were completed in 1760.

The four palaces are:
* Christian VII&#x27;s Palace, originally known as Moltke&#x27;s Palace
* Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace, originally known as Levetzau&#x27;s Palace
* Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, originally known as Brockdorff&#x27;s Palace
* Christian IX&#x27;s Palace, originally known as Schack&#x27;s Palace

Currently, only the palaces of Christian VII and Christian VIII are open to the public.

===Christian VII&#x27;s Palace===

Christian VII&#x27;s Palace is also known as Moltke&#x27;s Palace, and was originally built for Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke. It is the southwestern palace, and has been since 1885 used to accommodate and entertain prominent guests, for receptions, and for ceremonial purposes.

Moltke&#x27;s Palace was erected in 1750–54 by the best craftsmen and artists of their day under the supervision of Eigtved. It was the most expensive of the four palaces at the time it was built, and had the most extravagant interiors. Its Great Hall (&quot;Riddersalen&quot;) featured woodcarvings (&quot;boiserie&quot;) by Louis August le Clerc, paintings by François Boucher and stucco by Giovanni Battista Fossati, and is acknowledged widely as perhaps the finest Danish Rococo interior.

The mansion formally opened on 30 March 1754, the King&#x27;s thirtieth birthday. Due to Eigtved&#x27;s death a few months later, final work such as the Banqueting Hall, was completed by Nicolas-Henri Jardin.

Immediately after the Christiansborg Palace fire in February 1794 and two years after the death of the original owner, the royal family, headed by the King Christian VII, purchased the first of the four palaces to be sold to the royal family, and commissioned Caspar Frederik Harsdorff to turn it into a royal residence. They occupied the new residence December 1794.

After Christian VII&#x27;s death in 1808, Frederick VI used the palace for his Royal Household. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the palace from 1852 to 1885. For short periods of time in the intervening years the palace has housed various members of the royal family while restoration took place on their respective palaces. In 1971–1975 a small kindergarten was established at the palace, and later a schoolroom, for Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim.

After 200 years the façade, decorated by German sculptor Johann Christoph Petzold, was severely damaged, causing parts of Amalienborg Place to be closed to prevent injury. In 1982, exterior and interior restoration began that completed in early 1996, Copenhagen&#x27;s year as European Capital of Culture. In 1999, Europa Nostra, an international preservation organisation, acknowledged the restoration with by presenting a medal.

The palace is occasionally open to the general public for tours.

===Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace===

Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace, also known as Levetzau&#x27;s Palace, is the northwestern palace and was originally built for Privy Councillor Count Christian Frederik Levetzau in 1750–60. Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s grandson Count Felix currently lives in an apartment in the palace. Prince Joachim and Princess Marie, who reside permanently in France, have also had an apartment made available to them in the palace when they perform engagements in Denmark.

After Eigtved&#x27;s death in 1754, royal architect Lauritz de Thurah carried out supervision of the building&#x27;s construction according to Eigtved&#x27;s plans.

The palace was sold by the entailed estate of Restrup, which had been established in 1756 by Levertzau, the late owner. The family set one condition when they sold the building— that the Count&#x27;s coat of arms should never be removed from the building. It can still be seen beside that of the monarch&#x27;s.

The King&#x27;s half-brother Frederik bought the palace in 1794, and painter and architect Nikolai Abildgaard modernized the interiors in the new French Empire style. The palace was named Christian VIII&#x27;s Palace after his son, Christian Frederik, who grew up in the palace, took over the building in 1805 upon the death of his father, and would become king in 1839.

Christian VIII died in 1848, and the Queen Dowager, Caroline Amalie, died in 1881. From 1885 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs used parts of the palace, but moved in 1898 when the palace became the residence of Crown Prince Christian (X) and Princess Alexandrine. After the death of Christian X the Palace was placed at the disposal of Prince Knud, the Heir Presumptive.

The palace was the home of Crown Prince Frederik until his marriage in 2004. From 2018 to 2019, Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s eldest grandchild Prince Nikolai lived in an apartment in the palace.

Today, there is little left of the remaining rococo interior; much of the interior reflects the changing taste and style of its residents over the years.

In the 1980s the palace was restored as residence for the Crown Prince, storage facilities for the Queen&#x27;s Reference Library and a museum for the Royal House of Glücksborg. The museum features private royal apartments from 1863 to 1947 including original fittings and furnishings. Tours are sometimes held of the rooms on the piano nobile.

===Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace===

Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, also known as Brockdorff&#x27;s Palace, is the northeastern palace. It has been the home of King Frederik X and Queen Mary since their marriage.

It was originally built for Count Joachim Brockdorff in the 1750s. Brockdorff died in 1763, and Lord High Steward Adam Gottlob Moltke acquired the palace. Moltke sold it two years later to King Frederick V.

From 1767 it housed the Royal Danish Military Academy, also known as the Army Cadet Academy (&quot;Landkadetakademi&quot;). In 1788 naval cadets replaced the army cadets until the academy moved to another location in 1827.

The following year the palace was prepared to house King Christian VIII&#x27;s son, Frederik VII, who ascended the throne in 1848, and his bride, Princess Vilhelmine. Architect Jørgen Hansen Koch successfully and thoroughly refurbished the palace in French Empire style in 1827–28.

After the marriage was dissolved in 1837, various members of the royal family lived in the palace. In 1869, it became the home of Frederik VIII. In 1934, it became the home of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid. The latter lived there until her death in 2000. From 2006 to 2010 the palace underwent major renovation to accommodate the then Crown Prince couple.

===Christian IX&#x27;s Palace===

Christian IX&#x27;s Palace is the southeastern palace, and is also known as Schack&#x27;s Palace. It has been the home of Queen Margrethe II since 1967.

Building work was commenced in 1750 by Eigtved, and was supervised first by architect Christian Josef Zuber and later by Philip de Lange.

It was originally commissioned by Privy Councillor Severin Løvenskjold, but in 1754 he had to give up due to economic difficulties. The project was taken over by Countess Anna Sophie Schack née Rantzau and her step-grandson Hans Schack, 4th Count of Schackenborg. A fire shortly after the change of ownership delayed completion by a couple of years.

On 7 January 1757 Hans Schack married Countess Ulrikke Auguste Vilhelmine Moltke, daughter of Adam Gottlob Moltke, and as his son-in-law had use of the best artists and craftsmen to complete the interiors.

In 1794, the palace was taken over from private residence by the Prince regent, then Crown Prince Frederick, and his wife, Crown Princess Marie. He died in 1839, and she in 1852. The palace was used after her death by, among others, the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It was later the home of Christian IX until his death in 1906. The home remained untouched afterwards until 1948. In 1967, the palace was restored for the then successor to the throne, Princess Margrethe and her husband Prince Henrik. She succeeded to the throne at the age of 31 as Margrethe II in 1972.

== Royal Guard ==

Amalienborg is guarded day and night by Royal Life Guards (&quot;Den Kongelige Livgarde&quot;). Their full dress uniform is fairly similar to that of the Foot Guards regiments of the British Army: a scarlet tunic, blue trousers, and a navy bearskin cap. The guard march from Rosenborg Castle at 11.30 am daily through the streets of Copenhagen and execute the changing of the guard in front of Amalienborg at noon. In addition, post replacement is conducted every two hours.

When the monarch is in residence, the King&#x27;s Guard (&quot;Kongevagt&quot;) also march alongside the changing of the guard at noon, accompanied by a band that plays traditional military marches. The Guard Lieutenant (&quot;Løjtnantsvagt&quot;) is always alerted when King Frederik or another member of the royal family is in residence. There are three types of watches: King&#x27;s Watch, Lieutenant Watch and Palace Watch. A King&#x27;s Watch is when His Majesty the King takes up residence in Christian IX&#x27;s Palace. A Lieutenant Watch is when Prince Joachim, or Princess Benedikte, takes the place as regent, when the monarch is unable to. A Palace Watch is when no member of the royal family is in the palace, and it is the smallest one.

==Equestrian statue==
The equestrian statue of King Frederik V was commissioned by Moltke, as Director for the Danish Asiatic Company, and it was made by French sculptor Jacques Saly. Work began in 1753, and the foundation stone was laid in place in 1760 at the 100-year celebration of political absolutism in Denmark. The statue was finally unveiled in 1771, five years after King Frederik V&#x27;s death in 1766.

==Amaliehaven==

The Amalie Garden () is located between the waterfront and Amalienborg Slotsplads. Established in 1983, it was a gift from the A.P. Møller and Chastine McKinney Møller Foundation to the citizens of Copenhagen. The two-level garden was designed by Belgian architect Jean Delogne. It features marble sculptures and a central fountain designed by Italian Arnaldo Pomodoro. It is owned jointly by the Danish state and the municipality of Copenhagen, and maintained by the Palaces and Properties Agency.

==Axis alignments==
The short axis on which Amalienborg lies, Frederiksgade (English: &quot;Frederik&#x27;s Street&quot;), has been much discussed due to construction the building of the Copenhagen Opera House in 2001–04.

Aligned on the short axis are:
* Frederik&#x27;s Church (Danish: &quot;Frederikskirke&quot;), commonly known as The Marble Church (Danish: &quot;Marmorkirken&quot;).
* Amalienborg
* Copenhagen Opera House

The long axis on which Amalienborg lies is Amaliegade (English: &quot;Amalie Street&quot;).

<text>Goyang Zaicro Football Club () was a South Korean professional football team based in Goyang. The club competed in the K League Challenge between 2013 and 2016. They played their home games at Goyang Stadium.

The club traces its origins to &quot;Immanuel FC&quot;, a Christian football club founded in 1983. The team previously played in Iksan and Gimpo before moving to Ansan.

==History==
Immanuel FC, the predecessor of Goyang Zaicro FC, was founded in 1983. In 1985, Immanuel FC and Hallelujah FC decided to join to create a unified Christian football club. As a result, Immanuel FC became Hallelujah&#x27;s reserve team. After the 1985 season, Hallelujah FC left the professional ranks in order to concentrate their financial efforts on missionary work.

The two clubs separated after one year. Immanuel FC participated in many tournaments as an amateur football club. They even competed with Hallelujah FC in 1991.

In 1992, Immanuel FC suffered from a lack of funds. Therefore, E-Land took over the team and renamed it &quot;E-Land Puma FC&quot;. From 1992 to 1998, they won the three championships in some tournaments.

At the start of 1998, the Asian economic crisis affected the club&#x27;s parent group E-Land, necessitating the release of the club, which became amateur again as Immanuel FC. The club brought in some footballers for Hallelujah FC and changed their name to Hallelujah FC. in 1999. This Hallelujah FC founded in 1999 is the official starting point of Goyang Hi FC history by K League. In 2003 the team moved to Iksan and joined the Korea National League, finishing a creditable third after the First Stage, but were prevented from competing in the Second Stage after protests by radical Won Buddhists led to the club being barred from playing in Iksan. The club moved to Gimpo, where they enjoyed their most successful season in the National League in 2006, completing the Second Stage at the summit of the league, before being defeated in the Championship Play-off. The club moved again, this time to Ansan, in 2007, enjoying another successful campaign in 2008, a season which saw them reach the final of the National League Championship, where they were defeated on penalties, before evolving into Ansan &#x27;H&#x27; FC for the 2012 National League season. In September 2012, it was confirmed that the team would be moving to Goyang City for the 2013 season, and will change its name to Goyang Hi FC.

On 18 January 2016, the club name officially changed to Goyang Zaicro FC for the 2016 season due to sponsorship reasons. The club was disbanded after the 2016 season.

<text>The Ontario Research and Innovation Optical Network (ORION) is a high-speed optical research and education network in Ontario, Canada. It connects virtually all of Ontario&#x27;s research and education institutions including every university, most colleges, several teaching hospitals, public research facilities and several school boards to one another and to the global grid of R&amp;E networks using optical fibre.

==History==
ORION was founded in 2001 (then as The Optical Regional Advanced Network of Ontario, or ORANO) with the support of the Ontario Government. ORION is a self-sustaining not-for-profit organization kickstarted by the Ontario Government under Premier Harris.

ORION is owned and operated by a not-for-profit corporation governed by a board of directors, which includes representatives from the fields of education, research and business. ORION was initially funded by the Government of Ontario with additional funding from CANARIE, as well as private and public sector organizations and institutions. ORION is a self-sustaining organization, generating revenue from its connected institutions through user access fees and over network-based services.

In April 2023, &quot;GTAnet&quot; merged with ORION.

== Network ==
The network spans and connects 28 communities throughout Ontario. Almost 100 organizations and special projects connect to ORION directly, including 21 universities, 22 colleges, 34 school boards representing 2 million students, 13 teaching hospitals and medical research centres, and other research and educational and public library facilities. 

ORION connects to research and education networks elsewhere in Canada and internationally through the national CANARIE network, which exchanges with ORION at the Toronto Internet Exchange.

== Events ==
=== THINK Conference ===

ORION hosts the annual THINK Conference and bestows the annual ORION Leadership Awards, to recognize individuals and groups who have led and championed the use of advanced and collaborative technologies to support research, education, innovation and discovery here at home in Ontario or on the global stage.
