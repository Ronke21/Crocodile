<text>Car 54, Where Are You? is an American sitcom that aired on NBC from September 1961 to April 1963. Filmed in black and white, the series starred Joe E. Ross as Gunther Toody and Fred Gwynne as Francis Muldoon, two mismatched New York City police officers who patrol the fictional 53rd precinct in The Bronx. Car 54 was their patrol car.

The series had a rotating group of directors, including Al De Caprio, Stanley Prager, and series creator Nat Hiken. Filming was done both on location and at Biograph Studios in the Bronx.

== Synopsis ==
The series follows the adventures of New York City Police Department officers Gunther Toody (Joe E. Ross), badge #1432, and Francis Muldoon (Fred Gwynne), badge #723 and #1987 in early episodes, assigned to Patrol Car 54. Toody is short, stocky, nosy, and not very bright, and he lives with his loud, domineering wife Lucille (Beatrice Pons). College-educated Muldoon is very tall, quiet, and more intellectual. A shy bachelor, he lives with his mother and two younger sisters. He is reluctant to get married.

Much of the series is set in the station house, with commanding officer Captain Block (Paul Reed) ordering his men to answer neighborhood police calls or investigate baffling cases that have stymied the force at large. Toody and Muldoon often blunder into these cases, encountering the criminals accidentally and proceeding on a wrong assumption. By sheer perseverance, inadvertence, and luck, Toody and Muldoon bring each case to a successful conclusion.

==Episode list==

==Production==
Many of the scripts were written by Nat Hiken, who won an &quot;Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy&quot; Emmy Award for his work on the series.

Hiken had previously produced &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; in New York; it was a military comedy with Silvers (as Sgt. Bilko) and his gang of comical soldiers. Hiken recruited many of the Bilko alumni for this new series. Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne had featured roles on the Bilko show, and Beatrice Pons was hired to reprise her old role of Ross&#x27;s wife. Other veterans from the Bilko show were Paul Reed, Al Lewis, Charlotte Rae, Jimmy Little, Jack Healy, Frederick O&#x27;Neal, Martha Greenhouse, Bob Hastings, Billy Sands, and Gerald Hiken.

Some supporting players on &quot;Car 54&quot; were so well received that they were brought back for additional episodes. Molly Picon played Mrs. Bronson, an enterprising matron who made life miserable for city authorities but always adhered strictly to the law, forcing her whims to be accommodated. Larry Storch played a gypsy husband, and Charlie, the town drunk, whose constant scrapes with the police compelled Toody and Muldoon to rehabilitate him. Gene Baylos was the hapless Benny the Bookie, whose attempts at swearing off gambling always involved Toody and Muldoon. Carl Ballantine appeared as Al, Toody&#x27;s imperious brother-in-law, who commanded instant obedience from his wife, Rose (Martha Greenhouse).

Interiors were filmed at Biograph Studios, Inc. at 807 East 175th Street, in The Bronx, New York City, New York. Precinct exteriors is of Biograph Studios building,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyheritage/164&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; within the territory of New York&#x27;s 48th Precinct.&lt;ref name=&quot;homesteadcloud/car54&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cars===
So that they would not be mistaken for actual police cars during location filming, the cars used for the series were painted dark red and white, which appeared as the proper shade of gray on Orthochromatic black-and-white film to replicate NYPD cars of that era, which were black and green, with a white roof and trunk.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1996/new-color-scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Three cars were used as the title vehicle during the series: a 1961 Plymouth Belvedere during most of the first season, followed by a 1962, and later a 1963, Plymouth Savoy.

===Theme song===
The theme song&#x27;s lyrics were written by series creator, writer, and occasional director, Nat Hiken, with music by John Strauss.

&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:24px;&quot;&gt;
There&#x27;s a holdup in the Bronx,
Brooklyn&#x27;s broken out in fights;
There&#x27;s a traffic jam in Harlem
That&#x27;s backed up to Jackson Heights;
There&#x27;s a Scout troop short a child,
Khrushchev&#x27;s due at Idlewild;
Car 54, Where Are You?
&lt;/poem&gt;

The line &quot;Khrushchev&#x27;s due at Idlewild&quot; refers to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. In September 1960, a year before the series began, Khrushchev flew to New York&#x27;s Idlewild Airport (now John F. Kennedy International Airport) to attend the United Nations General Assembly.

==Broadcast history==

==Syndication==
&quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; first entered into syndication in January 1964. It began airing on the cable channel Nick at Nite in 1987 and ran on the network until 1990. It was seen for less than one year on the short-lived &quot;Ha!&quot; Channel in 1990–1991 and also aired on another Viacom-owned cable channel, Comedy Central, in the early 1990s. In 2016, the show aired early Sunday mornings on MeTV, and currently airs Monday through Friday on its sister network Decades.

==1994 film==
&quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; was made into a 1994 film, shot mainly in Toronto, starring John C. McGinley as Muldoon, David Johansen as Toody, and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell as Toody&#x27;s wife Lucille. Though made in 1990, it was not released until 1994 due to the bankruptcy of Orion Pictures. Original cast members Al Lewis and Nipsey Russell appeared in the film, which underperformed both critically and commercially upon release.

==Home media==
In the early 1990s, Republic Pictures Home Video released some episodes on VHS. Shanachie Entertainment announced in late 2010 it was releasing season one on DVD Region 1 on February 22, 2011. The second and final season was released on April 24, 2012.

==In popular culture==
The show&#x27;s theme song is parodied as “Mario, Where Are You?” in an Atari commercial for &quot;Mario Bros.&quot;

In the 1966 film &quot;Munster, Go Home!&quot; Herman Munster (also played by Fred Gwynne) starts calling for police agencies, eventually yelling, “Car 54, where are you?”

<text>James Halliday (27 February 1927 – 3 January 2013) was a Scottish author, historian and politician. He was the chairman (leader) of the Scottish National Party (SNP) from 1956 to 1960.

==Early life==
Halliday was born in Woodburn Cottage, Wemyss Bay, Renfrewshire, the son of James Wightman Halliday, an estate gardener. Halliday was educated at Skelmorlie Primary School and Greenock Academy. He joined the SNP in 1943, aged 16, and also registered for military service in World War II. Halliday began studying at the University of Glasgow in 1944, joining the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association and playing an active part in union debates. Then tuberculosis of the spine left him unable to stand until 1947, and it was 1952 before he graduated.

==Educator==
Halliday worked teaching history at Coatbridge High School, Uddingston Grammar School and Dunfermline High School. From 1967 to 1988 he taught at the Dundee College of Education, initially joining as a lecturer in history before becoming principal lecturer of history and head of department in 1979. He specialised in modern history and had a particular interest in the history, politics and constitution of the United States.

==Political office==
In 1956, Halliday was elected leader of the SNP when Robert McIntyre decided to step down due to his belief that there was some opposition to him remaining leader amongst the party ranks. Although aged only 28, Halliday seemed the natural replacement as he had been the SNP parliamentary candidate for Stirling and Falkirk Burghs at the 1955 general election, and the only other SNP candidate besides McIntyre. Halliday contested the Stirling and Falkirk Burghs seat again at the 1959 general election and West Fife in 1970.

Halliday led the SNP for four years but felt he had to resign due to the pressures of working life. Halliday remained active in the SNP, and was a regular columnist for the Scots Independent newspaper and chairman of the company which publishes it.

==Personal life==
In 1955 he married Olive Campbell and they had two sons.

<text>Edfu (, , , ; also spelt Idfu, or in modern French as Edfou) is an Egyptian city, located on the west bank of the Nile River between Esna and Aswan, with a population of approximately 60,000 people. Edfu is the site of the Ptolemaic Temple of Horus and an ancient settlement, Tell Edfu. About south of Edfu are remains of ancient pyramids.

==Ancient history==

=== Ancient Tell Edfu ===

The remains of the ancient settlement of Edfu are situated about 50 m to the west of the Ptolemaic temple – to the left of the older temple pylon. This settlement is known as &quot;Wetjeset-hor&quot; and the Greek name was &quot;Apollinopolis Magna&quot; (Ancient Greek: &quot;Apollinòpolis&quot;, &quot;Απολλινόπολις&quot;). According to &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, part of Legio II &quot;Traiana Fortis&quot; was camped in &quot;Apollo superior&quot;, which was the Roman name for the town.

Although unassuming and unglamorous to the visiting tourists, Tell Edfu is a monument that contains evidence of more Egyptian history and is of more archaeological interest than the Ptolemaic temple. Although major parts of the settlement show severe signs of erosion, cut away or have been exposed during sebakh-digging, enough is preserved to gain information from as far back as the Predynastic Period. The remains of the settlement (tell) provides an insight into the development of Edfu as a provincial town from the end of the Old Kingdom until the Byzantine period. The settlement at Edfu was the capital of the Second Upper Egypt nome, and played an important role within the region. The oldest part of the town which can be dated to the late Old Kingdom lies on the eastern part of the tell, not far from the Ptolemaic temple.
There is evidence that the town flourished during the First Intermediate Period when it expanded extensively to the west. It is one of few settlements in southern Egypt that thrived when it seems that the north, especially around the delta, was in economic decline.
Today, the ancient mound of Tell Edfu is preserved in some areas up to 20 m high and contains complete archaeological sequences of occupation dating to the Old Kingdom until the Graeco-Roman period, more than 3000 years of history, therefore providing ideal conditions to study the development of a provincial town. A central part of the site was explored by Henri Henne from the Institute for Egyptology in Lille in 1921 and 1922. His team identified the remains of a small sanctuary from the Late or Ptolemaic period, possibly the Osiris chapel built by Psamtek I. Henne was followed by Octave Guéraud in 1928 then by Maurice Alliot in 1931 who each explored and excavated different aspects of the settlement remains. The top layers of the settlement containing the Byzantine, Roman and Ptolemaic remains and the Old and Middle Kingdom cemetery at the southern western corner were recorded by a Franco-Polish expedition in 1937–39. The expedition was organized in cooperation between the University of Warsaw and the Institut français d’archéologie orientale (IFAO) in Cairo, and was directed by B. Bruyère, J. Manteuffel and Kazimierz Michałowski. Three elaborate reports on the archaeology of Tell Edfu were published. 

Unfortunately, since mid-1939 no new detailed discoveries or thorough research has been completed at the tell except for 
recent work done by Barry Kemp, from the University of Cambridge. Since 2001, the Tell Edfu project has been directed by Nadine Moeller (Oriental Institute, University of Chicago). The current work focuses on the eastern part of the site. So far the administrative centre of the ancient town has been discovered with remains of a columned hall dating to the late Middle Kingdom as well as a large granary courtyard that functioned as a grain reserve for this provincial capital. Latter dates to the Second Intermediate Period (17th Dynasty). At least seven large round silos have been excavated here with a diameter between 5.5 and 6.5 meters which makes them the largest ones so far discovered within an ancient Egyptian urban centre.
=== 3rd Dynasty Pyramid ruins ===

The remains of one of seven small provincial step pyramids built along the Nile Valley, is situated about 5 km south of Edfu near the west bank village of Naga el-Goneima. The structure was built from rough reddish sandstone and rises to a present height of 5.5 m. The pyramid has been loosely attributed to King Huni of the Third Dynasty. The purpose of these pyramids is unknown. Further investigations and a detailed survey are carried out by the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago since 2010.

=== 5th and 6th dynasties ===

No larger remains dating earlier than the 5th Dynasty have been found at Edfu. The ancient cemetery comprised mastabas of the Old Kingdom as well as later tombs. Before the beginning of the New Kingdom, the necropolis was transferred to Hager Edfu, to the west and then in the Late period to the south at Nag’ el-Hassaya. The entire area was called Behedet. The god Horus was herein worshipped as Horus Behedet.

One of these mastabas belonged to Isi, a local administrator, who, it was quoted was the &quot;great chief of the Nome of Edfu&quot; in the Sixth Dynasty. Isi lived during the reign of King Djedkare Isesi of the Fifth and into the reign of Pepi I of the Sixth Dynasties. He was an administrator, judge, chief of the royal archives and a &quot;Great One among the Tens of the South&quot; [ref?]. Isi later became a living god and was so worshipped during the Middle Kingdom. As the Sixth Dynasty and the Old Kingdom drew to a close, local regional governors and administrative nobles took on a larger power in their areas, away from the royal central authority.

=== Temple of Horus ===
The town is known for the major Ptolemaic temple, built between 237 BC and 57 BC, into the reign of Cleopatra VII. Of all the temple remains in Egypt, the Temple of Horus at Edfu is the most completely preserved. Built from sandstone blocks, the huge Ptolemaic temple was constructed over the site of a smaller New Kingdom temple, oriented east to west, facing towards the river. The later structure faces north to south and leaves the ruined remains of the older temple pylon to be seen on the east side of the first court.

=== Apollonopolis Magna ===
In the Hellenistic period and under the Roman Empire, the city was known as Apollonopolis Magna or Apollinopolis Magna (Greek: , Strabo xvii. p. 817; Agartharch. p. 22; Plin. v. 9. s. 11; Plut. &quot;Is. et Osir.&quot; 50; Aelian. &quot;Hist. An.&quot; x. 2; Ptol. iv. 5. § 70; , Steph. Byzant. &quot;s. v.&quot;; , Hierocl. p. 732; It. Ant. p. 160, 174; Not. Imp. Orient. c. 143; Latin: Apollonos Superioris [urbs]). Ptolemy assigns Apollinopolis to the Hermonthite nome, but it was more commonly regarded as the capital town of the nome Apollopolites. Under the Roman emperors it was the headquarters of the Legio II Trajana. Its inhabitants were enemies of the crocodile and its worshippers.

The ancient city derived its principal reputation from two temples, which are considered second only to the Temple of Dendera as specimens of the sacred structures of Egypt. The larger temple is in good preservation, and is being excavated. The smaller temple, sometimes, but improperly, called a Typhonium, is apparently an appendage of the former, and its sculptures represent the birth and education of the youthful deity, Horus, whose parents Noum, or Kneph and Athor, were worshipped in the larger edifice. The principal temple is dedicated to Noum, whose symbol is the disc of the sun, supported by two asps and the extended wings of a vulture. Its sculptures represent (Rosellini, &quot;Monum. del Culto&quot;, p. 240, tav. xxxviii.) the progress of the Sun, Phre-Hor-Hat, Lord of Heaven, moving in his bark (Bari) through the circle of the Hours. The local name of the district round Apollinopolis was &quot;Hat&quot;, and Noum was styled Hor-hat-kah, or Horus, the tutelary genius of the land of Hat. This deity forms also at Apollinopolis a triad with the goddess Athor and Hor-Senet. The members of the triad are youthful gods, pointing their fingers towards their mouths, and before the decipherment of the hieroglyphics were regarded as figures of Harpocrates.

The entrance into the larger temple of Apollinopolis is a gateway (πυλών) 50 feet high, flanked by two converging wings (πτερά) in the form of truncated pyramids, rising to . The wings contain ten stories, are pierced by round loop-holes for the admission of light, and probably served as chambers or dormitories for the priests and servitors of the temple. From the jambs of the door project two blocks of stone, which were intended, as Ddnon supposes, to support the heads of two colossal figures. This propylaeon leads into a large square, surrounded by a colonnade roofed with squared granite, and on the opposite side is a pronaos or portico, in height, and having a triple row of columns, six in each row, with variously and gracefully foliaged capitals. The temple is wide, and long from the entrance to the opposite end. Every part of the walls is covered with hieroglyphics, and the main court ascends gradually to the pronaos by broad steps. The whole area of the building was surrounded by a wall high, of great thickness. Like so many of the Egyptian temples, that of Apollinopolis was capable of being employed as a fortress. It stood about a third of a mile from the river. The sculptures, although carefully and indeed beautifully executed, are of the Ptolemaic era, the earliest portion of the temple having been erected by Ptolemy VI Philometor in 181 BC.

Apollonopolis Magna became a Christian bishopric, a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Ptolemais, the capital of the Roman province of Thebais Secunda. Papyrus documents record the names of perhaps five of its bishops. No longer a residential bishopric, Apollonopolis Magna is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

<text>The  (; CESID) was the Spanish intelligence agency before the current Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI) took over as its successor in 2002.

==History==
Following the dissolution of the Information Service and Military Police, &quot;Servicio de Información y Policía Militar (SIPM)&quot; at the end of the civil war, the intelligence organizations of the Francoist period were the Central Documentation Service, &quot;Servicio Central de Documentación (SECED)&quot;, the Political-Social Brigade, &quot;Brigada Político-Social&quot; (BPS)—a special branch of the plainclothes corps later renamed &quot;Brigada de Investigación Social&quot; (BIS) (Social Investigation Brigade)—and the Intelligence Service of the Civil Guard. Keeping files on the rural and urban population of every part of Spain, these bodies carried on close surveillance and political intimidation on behalf of the Francoist government. &lt;br&gt;

But the most notable of all was the &quot;&quot; which was the abbreviated name for the &quot;Servicios de Información del Ejército de Tierra, la Armada y el Ejército del Aire&quot; (Information Services of the Army, Navy and Air Force). It was the Second &quot;Section&quot;, or Intelligence, of the respective Headquarters, hence the name &quot;Segunda&quot; or Second. During the 1940s, its main role was to counter the activities of the Spanish Maquis in their attempted resurgence in Spain who in October 1944, attempted an invasion of the Aran Valley. In 1957, its expenses amounted to 311,455₧ (€100,000).

The was established in 1977 by Defense Minister Manuel Gutiérrez Mellado to replace the discredited former organizations in order to prepare Spain for a more democratic rule. On 2 November 1977 The (SIPG) was merged with the CESID.

By a royal decree of January 1984, CESID was defined legally as the intelligence agency of the prime minister. Nevertheless, it was fundamentally military in nature, and its head in 1988 was an army lieutenant general, Emilio Alonso Manglano. Observers speculated, however, that Manglano, who had held the post since 1981, eventually would be succeeded by a civilian.

Employing about 2,000 individuals as of 1988, CESID was staffed primarily by the military, supplemented by 500 members of the Civil Guard and by 80 plainclothes police. About 30 percent of the members of the staff were civilians, said to be selected usually from among close relatives of military officers. Women had been confined largely to administrative tasks, but they were increasingly being entrusted with operational assignments.

The principal operating units were domestic intelligence; foreign intelligence; counterintelligence; economics and technology (primarily industrial espionage); and operational support (principally application of devices for surveillance and eavesdropping). Considerable emphasis in external intelligence was allotted to North Africa and to the security of Ceuta and Melilla. Liaison was maintained with a number of intelligence services of North African and Middle Eastern nations, as well as with the Israeli agency, Mossad. Interception of ship transmissions in the strait area was another focus of activity. Domestic intelligence centered on exposure of plots against the government, monitoring activities of unrecognized political parties, and counterterrorism.

Although CESID was the senior agency, it did not have a firmly established coordinating function over other intelligence bodies, which included the General Headquarters of Information of the Ministry of Defense; the second sections of the army, the air force, and the navy staffs; and the Civil Guard Information Service (SIGC), dedicated to criminal and terrorist intelligence.

In addition, the National Police Corps had a General Commissariat of Information (CGI), with an antiterrorist mission that included a Foreign Intelligence Brigade to investigate international terrorism aimed against Spain. Considerable rivalry and overlapping of missions characterized the entire intelligence system. CESID, in particular, was reported to be seeking to gain exclusive jurisdiction over police foreign intelligence activities.

<doc id="1057223" wikidata="Q6305414" url="?curid=1057223" title="Juke Box Jury">
<text>Juke Box Jury was a music panel show which ran on BBC Television between 1 June 1959 and 27 December 1967. The programme was based on the American show &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;, itself an offshoot of a long-running radio series. The American series, which was televised, aired from 1953 to 1959 and was hosted by Peter Potter, Suzanne Alexander, Jean Moorhead, and Lisa Davis.

The series featured celebrity showbusiness guests on a rotating weekly panel who were asked to judge the hit potential of recent record releases. By 1962 the programme was attracting 12 million viewers weekly on Saturday nights.

The concept was later revived by the BBC for one series in 1979 and a further two series in 1989/1990.

==Format==
&quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; took a format where a guest panel reviewed new record releases in a 25-minute programme, extended to an hour for some Christmas shows. The format was drawn from that of the US TV series, &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;. Host David Jacobs each week asked four celebrities (the &#x27;Jurors&#x27;) to judge newly released records on his jukebox (a Rock-Ola Tempo II) and forecast which would be declared a &quot;hit&quot; or a &quot;miss&quot; – the decision accompanied by either a bell for a &#x27;hit&#x27; or a hooter for a &#x27;miss&#x27;. A panel of three members of the audience voted as a tie-breaker if the guests&#x27; decision was deadlocked, by holding up a large circular disc with &#x27;Hit&#x27; on one side and &#x27;Miss&#x27; on the other. Most weeks the performers of one of the records would be hidden behind a screen and emerge to &quot;surprise&quot; the panel after they had given their verdict.

The series was usually broadcast from the BBC TV Theatre, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Green, London. Each programme normally consisted of between seven and nine records. Those editions which were pre-recorded normally followed a live transmission, and broadcast in the regular slot.

==History==

===1959–1967===
&quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; was first broadcast on BBC Television on 1 June 1959. Originally on Monday evenings, the BBC show was moved to early Saturday evenings starting on 3 September 1959 due to its immediate popularity. The series was produced by Russell Turner.

The original panel consisted of Pete Murray, Alma Cogan, Gary Miller and Susan Stranks, who gave a &#x27;teenager&#x27;s view&#x27;. Murray appeared every week for the first 11 episodes, however, generally the panel of judges changed from week to week and mainly featured current stars from music, television and film. The panel normally comprised two male and two female guests, many of whom appeared more than once. Singers Gary Miller and Alma Cogan were regular panelists in the early shows. Actor Eric Sykes was often a panelist and Katie Boyle was a frequent Juror (appearing at least 37 times), as were Lulu and Cilla Black, who appeared twelve and nine times respectively. From 31 December 1966, a regular panel was established for eight consecutive editions. Jimmy Savile, Simon Dee, Alan Freeman and Pete Murray sat in judgement for all these programmes, having first appeared together on 3 December 1966. From 25 February until 1 April, the foursome continued as regular panelists, but alternating in pairs each week, with Savile and Murray appearing together, followed by Freeman and Dee. Among the diverse others from the world of entertainment who appeared were Thora Hird, Alfred Hitchcock, Spike Milligan, Lonnie Donegan, Johnny Mathis, Roy Orbison and David McCallum.

By October 1959 &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; had reached a weekly audience of almost 9 million viewers. Bill Cotton took over production of the series during 1960, to be followed later in the year by Stewart Morris and then Neville Wortman, who was to remain the producer until the series ended in 1967.

On 7 December 1963, the panel was the four Beatles, while George Harrison and Ringo Starr both appeared separately later, as did their manager Brian Epstein, who was twice a panellist. John Lennon had already appeared on 29 June 1963. Then on 4 July 1964 the five members of the Rolling Stones formed the panel, the only time there were more than four Jurors on the programme. Keith Richards later wrote of this appearance: &quot;We didn&#x27;t give a shit... We just trashed every record they played.&quot;

By early 1962, &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; had a weekly audience of over 12 million viewers, while the Beatles appearance on 7 December 1963 garnered an audience of 23 million, and news of the Rolling Stones&#x27; appearance the following June garnered 10,000 applications to the BBC for tickets for the recording. The attraction of the programme deftly crossed generational boundaries – younger viewers revelling in the appearance of their current pop stars, while older adults identified with the often anti-pop sentiments of the panellists from a non-musical or older background, confirming &quot;adult and youthful prejudices at the same time&quot;&#x27;.

In January 1967, the Sunday tabloid newspaper &quot;News of the World&quot; in a series of attacks on the new hippy sub-culture and LSD, castigated David Jacobs in one article for playing the Mothers of Invention single &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot; on a &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; broadcast in November 1966 as it was &#x27;recorded on a trip&#x27;, and also blamed two of the jury for voting it a hit. The jury on this occasion included Bobby Goldsboro, Susan Maughan and comedian Ted Rogers. In fact, by the time of the article, the BBC had already cut seven minutes from the 7 January 1967 programme because of drug references in one of that week&#x27;s chosen songs, &quot;The Addicted Man&quot; by the Game, which had resulted in universal disapproval by the Jurors during an extended discussion. This was part of a new policy for the programme during its last year of broadcast, when a regular panel of four disc jockeys was introduced, with a more detailed discussion of each song.

On 24 December 1966 and again on 5 August 1967 the Seekers became only the fourth band to appear as Jurors in the series, appearing just a few weeks after The Bachelors. The programme had by this time seen a drop in ratings, and from 27 September 1967 &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; was moved from its prime place in the Saturday evening schedules and transmitted on early Wednesday evenings, replaced in the key Saturday slot by &quot;Dee Time&quot;. On November 8, 1967, the scheduled edition of the show was cancelled without notice, leading to speculation the show was to end. At the end of 1967, &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; was dropped from the BBC schedule because of its falling ratings, and the last broadcast was on 27 December 1967, with original Jurors Pete Murray and Susan Stranks appearing once more.

David Jacobs hosted a one off &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; in 1989 to mark the centenary of the phonograph. Pete Murray was on the panel.

===Post 1967===
The programme has been revived twice, first in 1979 with Noel Edmonds as presenter, and then with Jools Holland for two seasons in 1989/1990, ending on 25 November 1990. Frequent jurors from the original run Katie Boyle &amp; Lulu both returned for the Jools Holland era, which also included impressionist Steve Nallon on the panel impersonating the sitting Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The 1979 series was most notable for a panel containing Johnny Rotten (John Lydon), who gave a characteristically acerbic performance before walking out before the end of 30 June 1979 programme.

The final televised edition of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; aired on BBC2 on 25 November 1990. Dusty Springfield was on the final panel, joining Alan Freeman who appeared on 30 September 1990, as the only personalities to feature as jurors in all three eras of the television run. Lulu appeared in the 1990s run, but was not a juror during the 1979 series, although her single &quot;I Love To Boogie&quot; was featured in the series; where it was erroneously judged to be a likely hit.

BBC Radio Merseyside has run a radio version of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; for some years, hosted by Spencer Leigh and normally broadcast under the programme name &quot;On The Beat&quot; although it is often scheduled as &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;. The broadcaster Chris Evans also ran a variation of the format in 2008 on his BBC Radio 2 &quot;Chris Evans Drivetime&quot; programme, where listeners were invited to text either &#x27;hit&#x27; or &#x27;miss&#x27;, plus their comments, to the programme.

The format also crossed over into children&#x27;s television on &quot;Going Live!&quot; and later &quot;Live and Kicking&quot; having a segment entitled &#x27;Trev and Simon&#x27;s Video Galleon&quot; (also Garden/Goldmine and Grandprix).

==Surviving recordings==
Because of the BBC&#x27;s policy of wiping tapes of its programmes in the 1960s, and the practice of not recording live programmes, only two episodes (29 October 1960 and 12 November 1960) are thought to still exist in their complete form, although transcripts also exist of the Beatles&#x27; appearances – both solo and together. In 2001, during a year-long drive to find lost archive material, the BBC announced that an audio recording of the Beatles&#x27; appearance in December 1963 had re-surfaced, a tape taken directly from the television broadcast.

==Theme music==
For the first six weeks of the programme, the theme to &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; was &quot;Juke Box Fury&quot;, written by composer and arranger Tony Osborne and recorded by his band under the name Ozzie Warlock and the Wizards.

The programme&#x27;s producer Russell Turner then replaced the theme with another instrumental, &quot;Hit and Miss&quot;, performed by the John Barry Seven Plus Four, which remained the title music from 1960 to 1967. For the last few months of the original series this was replaced by a version recorded by the Ted Heath Band.

The 1989–1990 Jools Holland series also featured &quot;Hit and Miss&quot;, this time recorded by Courtney Pine.

==Cultural references==
&quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; has a history of being parodied, and the format has been used a number of times for other programmes:

In 1959, the BBC refused Tommy Steele permission to use David Jacobs in a &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; comedy sketch for his &quot;Tommy Steele Show&quot; on ATV. The sketch went ahead in October 1959 with another BBC personality, announcer McDonald Hobley taking Jacobs&#x27; part.

Benny Hill parodied the show as &#x27;Soap Box Jury&#x27; on a show for the BBC on 4 March 1961. He impersonated David Jacobs and the panellists, one of whom was called &quot;Fred Curry&quot;, a takeoff on Pete Murray and another &quot;Lady Edgware&quot;, a takeoff on Lady Isobel Barnett – the joke being that Barnet and Edgware are neighbouring London suburbs. The sketch ended with a shot of Hill as all four panellists in one shot, achieved through filming each &quot;panellist&quot; separately and keeping the other three-fourths of the lens covered, which made this a landmark in both Hill&#x27;s career and the development of television production. The sketch can be seen on the DVD compilation &quot;Benny Hill: The Lost Years&quot;, which was released in 2005.

Also in 1961, comedian Jimmy Edwards promoted a tea-shop band &#x27;The Burke Adams Tea-Time Three&#x27;, who had a record judged a hit on &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, in &quot;The Face of Enthusiasm&quot;, part of his &quot;Faces of Jim&quot; comedy series.

Finnish television ran its own version of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; called &quot;Levyraati&quot;. The Finnish version long outlasted &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; – it ran from 1961 to 1992, and has both been revived since, and also re-imagined as &quot;Videoraati&quot; by Finnish cable TV channel MoonTV.

On 7 July 1962, BBC TV broadcast &quot;Twist Music With a Beat&quot;, a pop music programme about the dance craze &#x27;The Twist&#x27;, featuring a Twist competition between &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; members and members of the cast of &quot;Compact&quot;. The show featured Petula Clark, Don Lang &amp; His Twisters, Tony Osborne &amp; His Mellow Men and the Viscounts.

A ten-minute version of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; also featured as part of a regular 1960s BBC Christmas Day variety show &quot;Christmas Night with the Stars&quot; on Christmas Day 1962 and 1963.

The 1963 Gordon Flemyng film about the pop music industry &quot;Just For Fun&quot; had a &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; section which featured David Jacobs in his usual host position while Jimmy Savile, Alan Freeman and Dick Emery played the jury panel. The film was scripted by Milton Subotsky, who was one of the earliest guests on the programme.

In 1964, the Rolling Stones recorded an advert for the breakfast cereal Rice Krispies, which used themes from the programme including a jukebox, studio audience scenes and both the &#x27;Hit&#x27; button and the &#x27;Hit&#x27; signs that the audience jury used.

The British comedy duo French and Saunders, who appeared on the programme in 1989, referred to &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; in their parody of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; in their eponymous 1990 comedy series.

The Generation X 1978 song &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; referenced the programme in its lyrics: &quot;I&#x27;m not in love with Juke Box Jury/I&#x27;m not in love with Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot;.

Ian Dury and The Blockheads named their November 1981 album, &quot;Juke Box Dury&quot;.

In 1989, BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Arena&quot; produced a programme titled &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; to commemorate the centenary of the jukebox. Hosted by David Jacobs, it also featured &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot; regulars Pete Murray and Dusty Springfield, with Phil Collins and Sarah Jane Morris making up the rest of the team.

&quot;The Late Show programme&quot;, &quot;Classical Juke Box Jury&quot; (1990) was a spoof of &quot;Juke Box Jury&quot;, in which a panel of three people with a background in classical music voted on different versions of Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony by a variety of conductors.

==Jurors==
An incomplete list of the guest panellists. Each week had four guest &#x27;Jurors&#x27;, often plus one surprise artist chosen from among the records played that week.

<text>Sir Edward Leader Williams (28 April 1828 – 1 January 1910) was an English civil engineer, chiefly remembered as the designer of the Manchester Ship Canal, but also heavily involved in other canal projects in north Cheshire.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Worcester on 28 April 1828, the son of a civil engineer also named Edward (responsible for works to make the River Severn navigable; also a keen amateur artist and friend of John Constable) and his Quaker wife Sarah Whiting. His brother Benjamin Williams Leader became a notable landscape artist. The family lived at Diglis House in Worcester (today the Diglis Hotel).

==Career==
After attending the Royal Grammar School Worcester Williams became an apprentice to his father. In 1856 he was chosen out of 110 applicants to be chief engineer for the development of the navigable northern section of the River Weaver in Cheshire. He began to specialise in canal construction and in 1865 produced plans for enlarging the Weston Canal, a short stretch of canal linking the river near Frodsham to docks at Weston Point, Runcorn.

On 1 September 1872, he joined the Bridgewater Navigation Company and worked on the Bridgewater Canal.

===Manchester Ship Canal===
After submitting proposals in competition with another engineer (Hamilton Fulton), Williams was then appointed by Daniel Adamson in 1882 to design a new ship canal linking Manchester with the Irish Sea. Williams became chief designer and chief engineer, helping the Manchester Ship Canal Company formulate its proposals for the necessary Act of Parliament. From its initial reading in 1883, it took two years for the Bill to receive Royal Assent, and a further two years before the first construction work started, in November 1887.

The canal opened in 1894, and has been described as &quot;a feat without precedent in modern history&quot;. As well as the canal itself, major engineering landmarks of the scheme included the Barton Swing Aqueduct (carrying the Bridgewater Canal over the Ship Canal) and a neighbouring swing bridge for road traffic at Barton.

After the official opening of the Manchester Ship Canal on 21 May 1894, Edward Leader Williams of the Oaks, in the Parish of Dunham Massey, in the County Palatine of Chester was knighted by Queen Victoria on 2 July by Letters Patent.

Williams&#x27; other works include the Anderton Boat Lift (1875) near Northwich in Cheshire, which links the navigable stretch of the River Weaver with the Trent and Mersey Canal.

<text>A railway roundhouse is a building with a circular or semicircular shape used by railways for servicing and storing locomotives. Traditionally, though not always the case today, these buildings contained or were adjacent to a turntable.

==Overview==


Early steam locomotives normally traveled forwards only. Although reverse operations capabilities were soon built into locomotive mechanisms, the controls were normally optimized for forward travel, and the locomotives often could not operate as well in reverse. Some passenger cars, such as observation cars, were also designed as late as the 1960s for operations in a particular direction. Turntables allowed locomotives or other rolling stock to be turned around for the return journey, and roundhouses, designed to radiate around the turntables, were built to service and store these locomotives.

Most modern diesel and electric locomotives can run equally well in either direction, and many are push-pull trains with control cabs at each end. In addition, railroads often use multiple locomotives to pull trains, and even with locomotives that have distinct front and rear ends, the engines at opposing ends of a locomotive &quot;consist&quot; (a group of locomotives coupled together and controlled as a single unit) can be aligned so they face opposite directions. With such a setup, trains needing to reverse direction can use a technique known as a &quot;run around,&quot; in which the engines are uncoupled from the train, pull around it on an adjacent track or siding, and reattach at the other end. The engineer changes operating ends from the original locomotive to the one on the opposite end of the locomotive consist.

Railroad terminals also use features such as balloon loops and wyes (Commonwealth: triangle) to reverse the orientation of railroad equipment. Because of the advent of these practices, modern roundhouses are frequently not round and are simply large buildings used for servicing locomotives. Like much other railroad terminology, however, the structure has retained its traditional name. The alternative term &quot;engine-house&quot; encompasses both semi-circular and rectangular structures and broadly describes all buildings intended for storage and servicing of locomotives. &quot;Shops&quot; or &quot;workshops&quot; are buildings containing hoists and heavy machinery capable of major repairs beyond routine servicing. Some roundhouses include shop facilities internally or in adjoining buildings.

Since the great dieselisation era of the 1940s and 1950s, many roundhouses have been demolished or put to other uses, but a few still stand and remain in use on the railroads. Early roundhouses were too small for later locomotives. The buildings&#x27; peculiar shapes can make it challenging to adapt them to new uses, but they can also be visually pleasing.

==Purpose==
Roundhouses were originally constructed to service steam locomotives. In North America, regular daily serving began with a hostler moving an engine to an ash pit to remove the detritus of burned wood or coal. The locomotive&#x27;s tender would be filled with fuel and water, the locomotive&#x27;s sand dome would be filled, and the engine would be placed above an inspection pit so that workers could inspect it for any maintenance needs, like wear on its brake shoes and wheels. The engine&#x27;s many moving parts would also be thoroughly lubricated, although this meant that engines typically required frequent cleanings to remove old lubricating fluid along with dirt and anything else that stuck.

At larger 24-hour North American roundhouses, steam locomotives would often be turned around and made ready for service within a few hours of arrival. However, locomotives with major issues or in need of semi-regular maintenance required additional time. Larger roundhouses were adequately staffed with boilermakers, blacksmiths, and pipefitters so that this work could be accomplished on-site; only the most extensive work, such as major unexpected repairs or scheduled major maintenance, required the transport of locomotives to specialized backshops.

==History by country==
The location of the first roundhouse is thought to be Birmingham. England, built in 1837. Some turntables that were built in earlier days rapidly became unsuitable for the longer locomotives introduced. For example, the Roundhouse in London was built in 1846 to turn around steam locomotives on the line to Birmingham, but newer locomotives were too long within ten years—the building has been preserved and used for other purposes over the years.

===Australia===
Valley Heights roundhouse, west of Sydney, New South Wales, is the oldest surviving roundhouse in Australia, and has been preserved as a railway museum.

===Canada===
The London Roundhouse Project London, Ontario, Canada, is an extensive renovation of the Michigan Central Railroad steam locomotive repair shop which was built in 1887. It is to become the new home of Ellipsis Digital and Engine SevenFour, a pair of emerging technology companies.

The Canadian National Railways roundhouse at the Turcot Yard in Montreal, built in 1906, was the largest ever built in Canada. Its demolition in 1962 to make way for the Turcot Interchange illustrated a profound change in transportation habits across North America.

The Steam Whistle Brewing brewery in Toronto, Ontario is located in the building known as the John Street Roundhouse, a former Canadian Pacific Railway steam locomotive repair facility.

The Canadian Pacific 374 steam engine is on display at the former CPR Drake Street Roundhouse in Vancouver, now the Roundhouse Community Centre designed by VIA Architecture.

The Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Roundhouse in Victoria, British Columbia

===France===
Several roundhouses exist in France; two exist at Chambéry, built between 1906 and 1910. Another two exist at Avignon, and three exist at Lyon with other roundhouses being at Bordeaux, Strasbourg, Dijon, Bayonne, Colmar, Paris, Marseille, Clermont-Ferrand, Mulhouse, Nevers, Toulon, Valence, and Saint Etienne.

===Germany===

Several roundhouses survive in Germany, The roundhouses at Augsburg and Freilassing are home to a museum. The German Museum of Technology shows a doubled roundhouse.

===Hungary===
The former Budapest North Depot in Budapest is home to a railway museum since 2000.

===Indonesia===
At its height, there were four railway roundhouses in Indonesia; three of which survive: the roundhouse near Lempuyangan station in Yogyakarta, the one in Tebing Tinggi station in North Sumatera, and a former roundhouse inside Jatibarang sugar mill in Central Java which is now used as a mini railway museum.

===Italy===
There are two roundhouses at Turin, still in use by the FS. There is one in Rome.

===Japan===
The Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum, built around a roundhouse and turntable in Kyoto dating from 1914, is the oldest surviving concrete-reinforced roundhouse structure in Japan.

===New Zealand===
There were three roundhouses in New Zealand. Elmer Lane in Greymouth was one of the largest and most famous roundhouses in New Zealand and had up to 17 total berths. The last remains were demolished in the 1990&#x27;s. None of the original roundhouses survive however Mainline Steam as part of their Mercer project will build a roundhouse at Mercer.

=== Norway ===
Norway has had many roundhouses, and many still survive. Examples include Voss, Ål, Kongsberg on the Bergen line. Hamar, Otta and Oppdal on the Dovre line, Lodalen - Oslo (covered) and Egersund on the Sørland line.

===North Korea===
A roundhouse is known to exist at Manpo-Jian.

===Japan===
Roundhouses were a significant feature of Japanese railways. Many smaller roundhouses are still in use today as fully operational buildings on a few private and third-sector railways.

One Japanese roundhouse that remains intact is at the Kyoto Railway Museum. The museum comprises a number of structures classified by the Japanese Government as &#x27;Important Cultural Properties&#x27;. One of these structures is the museum roundhouse, the oldest reinforced concrete car shed extant in Japan.

===Poland===
The museum roundhouse in Wolsztyn, in western Poland, continued to supply steam locomotives for regular national rail services as of 2011.

===Portugal===
The Roundhouse at Entroncamento is home to the Portuguese National Railway Museum.

=== Serbia ===
===Switzerland===
The Uster roundhouse in Uster.

===Taiwan (ROC)===
Changhua Roundhouse in Changhua City built in 1922 is the only surviving roundhouse in Taiwan and is still in use as of 2022.

===United Kingdom===
Probably the first railway roundhouse, designed by Robert Stephenson, was built in 1837 in Birmingham, at Curzon Street station. Its central turntable, inspection pits, and an exterior wall were uncovered in March 2020 during work to build the HS2 line.

Another was built in 1839 at Derby, England by the North Midland Railway. A guidebook of the time says:

This roundhouse narrowly escaped demolition when the works closed down, and was classified as a listed building. It was restored in 2010, being converted into a brand new site for Derby College, with a new addition called the &#x27;Stephenson Building&#x27; including the other survival of demolition – the original Midland Counties Railway workshop. The new site was opened in September 2009. Tours can be arranged through Derby Tourist Information Centre.

In Leeds, Thomas Grainger designed the roundhouse near Armley Gyratory that was opened in 1847, with accommodation for 20 trains from the Leeds &amp; Thirsk Railway. It was operational until 1904.

The Fenton, Murray and Jackson building in Leeds (1831–1843), a private workshop, may previously have been laid out in a radial pattern like a roundhouse.

The Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London was built in 1847, but was too small for its function within 20 years; it is now an arts center and concert venue.

Barrow Hill Engine Shed, which is home to a number of preserved locomotives is still in use.

===United States===

It is estimated that there were about 3,000 roundhouse sites in the United States, although at least three times that many were built between 1840 and 1950. Many were demolished and rebuilt as locomotives became increasingly large. Several were built around 1840 for the earliest railroads. It is likely that the first in the US was built by the Baltimore and Ohio at Mt. Clare (Baltimore), although this cannot be confirmed because early records have been lost. Early roundhouses, especially those built in cold climates, were fully enclosed, with the turntable as well as the stalls under cover. Once locomotives became too large to fit in these structures, they were torn down and replaced with &quot;doughnut&quot;-shaped structures that surrounded an open turntable. Although some roundhouses used by Class 1 railroads were built as a full-circle with as many as 52 stalls, the vast majority were only part of a circle with 12 or fewer stalls.

Nearly every locomotive terminal in the country was anchored by a roundhouse, especially if a railroad owned more than a few locomotives. The largest concentration of roundhouses was in Chicago, with over 75 in and around the metropolitan region during the early 1900s. Other cities where multiple railroads terminated or were major division points also had over 20 roundhouses, such as Boston, Cleveland, St. Louis, Sioux City, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati. 

The largest &quot;as-built&quot; roundhouse ever constructed is believed to have been the Boston and Maine&#x27;s East Somerville roundhouse outside Boston, today the site of the Boston Engine Terminal. It was built with stalls long, of open space between the roundhouse and the turntable, and a turntable, giving it a diameter of . However, several roundhouses were enlarged over time to become larger than the one in Boston; for example, the Union Pacific roundhouse in Cheyenne, Wyoming was lengthened in 1930 to accommodate the new 4-8-8-4 &quot;Big Boy&quot; articulated locomotives being delivered. After the expansion it was in diameter and constituted a near full-circle. A portion of this roundhouse still stands and is used by Union Pacific to store heritage rolling stock.

The vast majority of roundhouses were torn down beginning in the 1950s as railroads converted from steam to diesel-electric power, which needed far less maintenance. Some were converted to service diesel engines, while others were used as storage or sold to other parties. Several dozen roundhouses stand today in active use by modern railroads and museums, although the majority of those still standing have been abandoned. An average of two per year are demolished or otherwise destroyed. 

The only roundhouse still in use as a locomotive servicing facility by the same railroad that constructed it is the Long Island engine house in Queens, New York. The largest surviving roundhouse by interior square footage is owned and operated by the North Carolina Transportation Museum in Spencer, North Carolina. It was built by the Southern Railway in 1924 and contains 37 stalls. 

The B&amp;O Railroad Museum complex in Baltimore, Maryland contains the restored railcar maintenance roundhouse of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, originally built in 1884.

The roundhouse in Aurora, Illinois, constructed in 1856, was purchased and restored by NFL football player Walter Payton in 1995. After Payton&#x27;s death, the roundhouse was occupied by a micro-brewery and renamed Two Brothers Roundhouse, with a plaque mounted in Payton&#x27;s honor.

==Operational roundhouses==
===North America===
The vast majority of roundhouses built in the US and Canada no longer exist, lie in ruins, or have been repurposed; however, a small number of them still exist and continue to operate in their intended capacity as locomotive storing and servicing facilities. Of the roughly 3,000 roundhouses that once existed in North America, fewer than 200 roundhouses are extant in the US ; in Canada, none exist east of Montreal. Below is a list of locations with operational roundhouses that are also open to the public.

<text>Charles Douglas Drysdale (October 1915 – 1984) was a Scottish nationalist activist and businessman.

Drysdale was born in Glasgow in October 1915, the second son of William Drysdale of Drysdales of Yoker, the pump manufacturers who supplied most of Glasgow&#x27;s shipbuilding industry. He qualified as an engineer, and spent the war years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME), achieving the rank of major and being awarded the MBE.

At the end of the war, Douglas and his elder brother, Ian Drysdale, left Drysdales (which had been bought out by Weir Pumps by then) and started Drysdale Brothers (Larbert) Ltd, Bronze Founders and Engineers.

He became active in the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1962, having moved from Glasgow first to Dunblane and then to Dollar, Clackmannanshire. His wife, Olwen Drysdale, started the Dollar Branch of the SNP in 1962 and they were both very active politically.

Despite having no previous political experience, he was elected as the SNP&#x27;s Vice Chairman with responsibility for Organisation and Finance in 1964. In 1966, his area of responsibility was reduced to only Finance.

Drysdale first stood for the SNP at the 1964 general election in Clackmannan and Eastern Stirlingshire, taking 12.2% of the vote and narrowly failing to hold his deposit. At the 1966 general election, Drysdale increased his vote share to just over 20%, one of the SNP&#x27;s best results. However, he became unhappy with the leadership of Arthur Donaldson, and in 1967 he stood for the leadership of the party against Donaldson. He had little support among the party&#x27;s grassroots, and was heavily defeated, 362 votes to 37.

He had a major stroke in 1969, but continued to be supportive of the cause for independence as much as he could until his death in 1984. His elder daughter Karen married the SNP National Organiser, Ian Macdonald, in 1963, and his younger daughter Lorna married Robert Anderson, who was involved in the &quot;Tartan Army&quot; Scottish nationalist direct action movement of the mid-1970s.

<doc id="1057235" wikidata="Q1978694" url="?curid=1057235" title="Early history of Switzerland">
<text>The early history of Switzerland begins with the earliest settlements up to the beginning of Habsburg rule, which in 1291 gave rise to the independence movement in the central cantons of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden and the growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy during the Late Middle Ages.

==Prehistory==
===Paleolithic to Mesolithic===
A hand-axe fashioned by Homo erectus has been found in Pratteln, which has been dated to 300,000 years ago. Neanderthal presence is known from the Grotte de Cotencher in Neuchâtel, dating to 70,000 years ago and from the caves of Wildkirchli in the Appenzell Alps, dated to about 40,000 years ago.
Anatomically modern humans reached Central Europe 30,000 years ago,
but most of what is now Switzerland was covered by glaciers during the Last Glacial Maximum (Würm glaciation). The ice-free parts, northern Switzerland along the High Rhine and part of the Aar basin, were exposed to permafrost.
Human habitation in the Swiss Plateau can be shown for the beginning Mesolithic, in Wetzikon-Robenhausen beginning around 10,000 years ago.

===Neolithic to Copper Age===
The Neolithic reached the Swiss plateau before 7,000 years ago (late 6th millennium BC), dominated by the Linear Pottery culture.
The area was relatively densely populated, as is attested to by the many archeological findings from that period. Remains of pile dwellings have been found in the shallow areas of many lakes, attributed to archaeological cultures such as Cortaillod, Pfyn and Horgen. Artifacts dated to the 5th millennium BC were discovered at the Schnidejoch in 2003 to 2005. The pre-Indo-European population of the Alpine region is typified by Ötzi the Iceman, an individual of the late 4th millennium BC found in the Austrian Alps (some 25 km east of the Swiss border). The Bell Beaker culture marks the transition from the Chalcolithic to the early Bronze Age.

===Bronze Age===
In the 3rd millennium BC, Switzerland lay on the south-western outskirts of the Corded Ware horizon, entering the early Bronze Age (Bell Beaker culture) in step with Central Europe, in the late centuries of the 3rd millennium. The Early Bronze Age Rhône culture in western Switzerland (-1500 BC) developed from the Bell Beaker culture and was closely related to the Unetice culture in central Europe. This was followed by the Tumulus culture (-1300 BC) in the Middle Bronze Age, and the Urnfield culture in the Late Bronze Age (). Settlements included lakeside villages and fortified settlements on elevated sites.

The Bronze Hand of Prêles dating from the 16th-15th century BC, is a unique find from the Tumulus culture period. Described as &quot;the earliest metal representation of a human body part ever found in Europe&quot;, it may have been a ritual object, or mounted on a standard like similar metal hands known from the Iron Age, or possibly a prosthesis. It was found in a grave along with a bronze hair-ring, pin and dagger. The hand had a golden bracelet or cuff decorated with solar motifs.

===Iron Age===

The Swiss plateau lay in the western part of the Early Iron Age Hallstatt culture, and it participated in the early La Tène culture (named for the type site at Lake Neuchâtel) which arose out of the Hallstatt background from the 5th century BC.

By the final centuries BC, the Swiss plateau and Ticino were settled by Continental Celtic speaking peoples (Gauls): the Helvetii and Vindelici inhabited the western and eastern part of the Swiss plateau, respectively, and the Lugano area
by the Lepontii.
The interior Alpine valleys of eastern Switzerland (Grisons) were inhabited by the non-Celtic Raetians.

The distribution of La Tène culture burials in Switzerland indicates that the Swiss plateau between Lausanne and Winterthur was relatively densely populated. Settlement centres existed in the Aare valley between Thun and Bern, and between Lake Zurich and the Reuss. The Valais and the regions around Bellinzona and Lugano also seem to have been well-populated; however, those lay outside the Helvetian borders.

Almost all the Celtic &quot;oppida&quot; were built in the vicinity of the larger rivers of the Swiss plateau.
About a dozen oppida are known in Switzerland (some twenty including uncertain candidate sites), not all of which were occupied during the same time. For most of them, no contemporary name has survived; in cases where a pre-Roman name has been recorded, it is given in brackets.
The largest were the one in Bern-Engehalbinsel (presumably &quot;Brenodurum&quot;, the name recorded on the Bern zinc tablet), on the Aare, and the one in Altenburg-Rheinau on the Rhine.
Of intermediate size were those of Bois de Châtel, Avenches (abandoned with the foundation of &quot;Aventicum&quot; as the capital of the Roman province), Jensberg (near vicus Petinesca, Mont Vully, all within a day&#x27;s march from the one in Bern, the Oppidum Zürich-Lindenhof at the Lake Zurich–Limmat–Sihl triangled Lindenhof hill, and the Oppidum Uetliberg, overlooking the Sihl and Lake Zurich shore.
Smaller oppida were at Geneva (&quot;Genava&quot;), Lausanne (&quot;Lousonna&quot;) on the shores of Lake Geneva, at Sermuz on the upper end of Lake Neuchâtel, at Eppenberg and Windisch (&quot;Vindonissa&quot;) along the lower Aar,
and at Mont Chaibeuf and Mont Terri in the Jura Mountains, the territory of the Rauraci.

A female who died in about 200 B.C was found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy woolen dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman.

==Roman era==
In 58 BCE, the Helvetii tried to evade migratory pressure from Germanic tribes by moving into Gaul, but were stopped and defeated at Bibracte (near modern-day Autun) by Julius Caesar&#x27;s armies and then sent back. In 15 BCE, Tiberius and Drusus conquered the Alps, and the region became integrated into the Roman Empire: the Helvetii settlement area became part first of Gallia Belgica and later of the province of Germania Superior, while the eastern part was integrated into the Roman province of Raetia.

The following 300 years saw extensive Roman settlement, including the construction of a road network and the founding of many settlements and cities. The center of Roman occupation was at &quot;Aventicum&quot; (Avenches), other cities were founded at &quot;Arbor Felix&quot; (Arbon), &quot;Augusta Raurica&quot; (Kaiseraugst near Basel), &quot;Basilea&quot; (Basel), &quot;Curia&quot; (Chur), &quot;Genava&quot; (Geneva), &quot;Lousanna&quot; (Lausanne), &quot;Octodurum&quot; (Martigny, controlling the pass of the Great St. Bernard), &quot;Salodurum&quot; (Solothurn), &quot;Turicum&quot; (Zürich) and other places. Military garrisons existed at &quot;Tenedo&quot; (Zurzach) and &quot;Vindonissa&quot; (Windisch).

The Romans also developed the Great St. Bernard Pass beginning in the year 47, and in 69 part of the legions of Vitellius used it to traverse the Alps. The passes were expanded from dirt trails to narrow paved roads. Between 101 and 260, the legions moved out of the region, allowing trade to expand. In Raetia, Roman culture and language became dominant. Nearly 2,000 years later, some of the population of Graubünden still speak Romansh which is descended from Vulgar Latin.

In 259, Alamanni tribes overran the Limes and caused widespread devastation of Roman cities and settlements. The Roman empire managed to reestablish the Rhine as the border, and the cities on Swiss territory were rebuilt. However, it was now a frontier province, and consequently the new Roman cities were smaller and much more fortified.

==Christianization and post-Roman era==

In the late Roman period in the 3rd and 4th centuries, the Christianization of the region began. Legends of Christian martyrs such as Felix and Regula in Zürich probably are based on events that occurred during the persecution of Christians under Diocletian around 298. The story of the Theban Legion, which was martyred near Saint Maurice-en-Valais in Valais, figures into the histories of many towns in Switzerland.

The first bishoprics were founded in the 4th and 5th centuries in Basel (documented in 346), Martigny (doc. 381, moved to Sion in 585), Geneva (doc. 441), and Chur (doc. 451). There is evidence from the 6th century for a bishopric in Lausanne, which may have been moved from Avenches.

With the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Germanic tribes moved in. Burgundians settled in the Jura, the Rhône valley and the Alps south of Lake Geneva; while in the north, Alemannic settlers crossed the Rhine in 406 and slowly assimilated the Gallo-Roman population, or made it retreat into the mountains. Burgundy became a part of the Frankish kingdom in 534; two years later, the dukedom of Alemannia followed suit.

The Burgundy kings furthered the Christianization through newly founded monasteries, e.g. at Romainmôtier or St. Maurice in the Valais in 515. In the Alaman part, only isolated Christian communities continued to exist; the Germanic faith including the worship of Wuodan was prevalent. The Irish monks Columbanus and Gallus re-introduced Christian faith in the early 7th century. The Bishopric of Konstanz also was founded at that time.

==Switzerland in the Middle Ages==

=== Early Middle Ages ===
Under the Carolingian kings, the feudal system proliferated, and monasteries and bishoprics were important bases for maintaining the rule. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 assigned the western part of modern Switzerland (Upper Burgundy) to Lotharingia, ruled by Lothair I, and the eastern part (Alemannia) to the eastern kingdom of Louis the German that would become the Holy Roman Empire. The boundary between Alamania, ruled by Louis, and western Burgundy, ruled by Lothar, ran along the lower Aare, turning towards the south at the Rhine, passing west of Lucerne and across the Alps along the upper Rhône to Saint Gotthard Pass.

Louis the German in 853 granted his lands in the Reuss valley to the monastery of St Felix and Regula in Zürich (modern day Fraumünster) of which his daughter Hildegard was the first abbess. According to legend this occurred after a stag bearing an illuminated crucifix between his antlers appeared to him in the marshland outside the town, at the shore of Lake Zürich. However, there is evidence that the monastery was already in existence before 853. The Fraumünster is across the river from the Grossmünster, which according to legend was founded by Charlemagne himself, as his horse fell to his knees on the spot where the martyrs Felix and Regula were buried.

When the land was granted to the monastery, it was exempt from all feudal lords except the king and later the Holy Roman Emperor (a condition known as Imperial immediacy; in German or ). The privileged position of the abbey (reduced taxes and greater autonomy) encouraged the other men of the valley to put themselves under the authority of abbey. By doing so they gained the advantages of the Imperial immediacy and grew used to the relative freedom and autonomy. The only source of royal or imperial authority was the or of the abbey which was given to one family after another by the emperor as a sign of trust.

In the 10th century, the rule of the Carolingians waned: Magyars destroyed Basel in 917 and St. Gallen in 926, and Saracens ravaged the Valais after 920 and sacked the monastery of St. Maurice in 939. The Conradines (von Wetterau) started a long time rule over Swabia during this time. Only after the victory of king Otto I over the Magyars in 955 in the Battle of Lechfeld were the Swiss territories reintegrated into the empire.

===High Middle Ages===

King Rudolph III of the Arelat kingdom (r. 993–1032) gave the Valais as his fiefdom to the Bishop of Sion in 999, and when Burgundy and thus also the Valais became part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1032, the bishop was also appointed count of the Valais. The Arelat mostly existed on paper throughout the 11th to 14th centuries, its remnants passing to France in 1378, but without its Swiss portions, Bern and Aargau having come under Zähringer and Habsburg rule already by the 12th century, and the County of Savoy was detached from the Arelat just before its dissolution, in 1361.

The dukes of Zähringen founded many cities, the most important being Freiburg in 1120, Fribourg in 1157, and Bern in 1191. The Zähringer dynasty ended with the death of Berchtold V in 1218, and their cities subsequently thus became &quot;independent&quot;, while the dukes of Kyburg competed with the house of Habsburg over control of the rural regions of the former Zähringer territory. When the house of Zähringen died out in 1218 the office of Vogt over the Abbey of St Felix and Regula in Zürich was granted to the Habsburgs, however it was quickly revoked.

The rise of the Habsburg dynasty gained momentum when their main local competitor, the Kyburg dynasty, died out and they could thus bring much of the territory south of the Rhine under their control. Subsequently, they managed within only a few generations to extend their influence through Swabia in south-eastern Germany to Austria.

Under the Hohenstaufen rule, the alpine passes in Raetia and the St. Gotthard Pass gained importance. Especially the latter became an important direct route through the mountains. The construction of the &quot;Devil’s Bridge&quot; (&#x27;) across the &#x27; in 1198 led to a marked increase in traffic on the mule track over the pass. Frederick II accorded the &quot;Reichsfreiheit&quot; to Schwyz in 1240 in the &quot;Freibrief von Faenza&quot; in an attempt to place the important pass under his direct control, and his son and for some time co-regent Henry VII had already given the same privileges to the valley of Uri in 1231 (the &#x27;). Unterwalden was &#x27; &quot;reichsfrei&quot;, since most of its territory belonged to monasteries, which had become independent even earlier in 1173 under Frederick I &quot;Barbarossa&quot; and in 1213 under Frederick II. The city of Zürich became &quot;reichsfrei&quot; in 1218.

While some of the &quot;Forest Communities&quot; (&quot;Waldstätten&quot;, i.e. Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden) were &quot;reichsfrei&quot; the Habsburgs still claimed authority over some villages and much of the surrounding land. While Schwyz was &quot;reichsfrei&quot; in 1240, the castle of Neu Habsburg was built in 1244 to help control Lake Lucerne and restrict the neighboring Forest Communities. In 1245 Frederick II was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV at the Council of Lyon. When the Habsburgs took the side of the pope, some of the Forest Communities took Frederick&#x27;s side. At this time the castle of Neu Habsburg was attacked and damaged. When Frederick failed against the Pope, those who had taken his side were threatened with excommunication and the Habsburgs gained additional power. In 1273 the rights to the Forest Communities were sold by a cadet branch of the Habsburgs to the head of the family, Rudolf I. A few months later he became King of the Romans, a title that would become Holy Roman Emperor. Rudolph was therefore the ruler of all the &quot;reichsfrei&quot; communities as well as the lands that he ruled as a Habsburg.

He instituted a strict rule in his homelands and raised the taxes tremendously to finance wars and further territorial acquisitions. As king, he finally had also become the direct liege lord of the Forest Communities, which thus saw their previous independence curtailed. On 16 April 1291 Rudolph bought all the rights over the town of Lucerne and the abbey estates in Unterwalden from Murbach Abbey in Alsace. The Forest Communities saw their trade route over Lake Lucerne cut off and feared losing their independence. When Rudolph died on 15 July 1291 the Communities prepared to defend themselves. On 1 August 1291 an Everlasting League was made between the Forest Communities for mutual defense against a common enemy.

In the Valais, increasing tensions between the bishops of Sion and the Counts of Savoy led to a war beginning in 1260. The war ended after the Battle at the &quot;Scheuchzermatte&quot; near Leuk in 1296, where the Savoy forces were crushed by the bishop&#x27;s army, supported by forces from Bern. After the peace of 1301, Savoy kept only the lower part of the Valais, while the bishop controlled the upper Valais.

===The 14th century===
With the opening of the Gotthard Pass in the 13th century, the territory of Central Switzerland, primarily the valley of Uri, had gained great strategical importance and was granted &quot;Reichsfreiheit&quot; by the Hohenstaufen emperors. This became the nucleus of the Swiss Confederacy, which during the 1330s to 1350s grew to incorporate its core of &quot;eight cantons&quot; (&quot;Acht Orte&quot;)

The 14th century in the territory of modern Switzerland was a time of transition from the old feudal order administrated by regional families of lower nobility (such as the houses of Bubenberg, Eschenbach, Falkenstein, Freiburg, Frohburg, Grünenberg, Greifenstein, Homberg, Kyburg, Landenberg, Rapperswil, Toggenburg, Zähringen etc.) and the development of the great powers of the late medieval period, primarily the first stage of the meteoric rise of the House of Habsburg, which was confronted with rivals in Burgundy and Savoy. The free imperial cities, prince-bishoprics and monasteries were forced to look for allies in this unstable climate, and entered a series of pacts. Thus, the multi-polar order of the feudalism of the High Middle Ages, while still visible in documents of the first half of the 14th century such as the Codex Manesse or the Zürich armorial
gradually gave way to the politics of the Late Middle Ages, with the Swiss Confederacy wedged between Habsburg Austria, the Burgundy, France, Savoy and Milan.
Bern had taken an unfortunate stand against Habsburg in the battle of Schosshalde in 1289, but recovered enough to confront Fribourg (Gümmenenkrieg) and then to inflict a decisive defeat on a coalition force of Habsburg, Savoy and Basel in the battle of Laupen in 1339. At the same time, Habsburg attempted to gain influence over the cities of Lucerne and Zürich, with riots or attempted coups reported for the years 1343 and 1350 respectively. This situation led the cities of Lucerne, Zürich and Bern to attach themselves to the Swiss Confederacy in 1332, 1351, and 1353 respectively.

As elsewhere in Europe, Switzerland suffered a crisis in the middle of the century, triggered by the Black Death followed by social upheaval and moral panics, often directed against the Jews as in the Basel massacre of 1349. To this was added the catastrophic 1356 Basel earthquake which devastated a wide region, and the city of Basel was destroyed almost completely in the ensuing fire.

The balance of power remained precarious during the 1350s to 1380s, with Habsburg trying to regain lost influence; Albrecht II besieged Zürich unsuccessfully, but imposed an unfavourable peace on the city in the treaty of Regensburg. In 1375, Habsburg tried to regain control over the Aargau with the help of &quot;Gugler&quot; mercenaries. After a number of minor clashes (Sörenberg, Näfels), it was with the decisive Swiss victory at the battle of Sempach 1386 that this situation was resolved. Habsburg moved its focus eastward and while it continued to grow in influence (ultimately rising to the most powerful dynasty of early modern Europe), it lost all possessions in its ancestral territory with the Swiss annexation of the Aargau in 1416, from which time the Swiss Confederacy stood for the first time as a political entity controlling a contiguous territory.

Meanwhile, in Basel, the citizenry was also divided into a pro-Habsburg and an anti-Habsburg faction, known as &quot;Sterner&quot; and &quot;Psitticher&quot;, respectively. The citizens of greater Basel bought most of the privileges from the bishop in 1392, and from this time on, though Basel nominally remained the domain of the prince-bishops until the Reformation, it was de facto governed by its city council, which since 1382 had been dominated by the city&#x27;s guilds. Similarly, the bishop of Geneva granted the citizenry substantial political rights in 1387.

Other parts of western Switzerland remained under the control of Burgundy and Savoy throughout the 14th century; the Barony of Vaud was incorporated into Savoy in 1359 and was annexed by Bern only in the context of the Swiss Reformation, in 1536. In the Valais, the bishop of Sion, allied with Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, was in conflict over the Walser-settled upper Valais during the 1340s. Amadeus pacified the region in 1352, but there was renewed unrest in 1353. In 1355, the towns of the upper Valais formed a defensive pact and negotiated a compromise peace treaty in 1361. This lasted until a renewed uprising in response to the 1383 accession of Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy. Amadeus invaded the Valais in 1387, but after his death in a hunting accident, his mother, Bonne de Bourbon, made peace with the Seven Tithings of the upper Valais, restoring the status quo ante of 1301. From this time, the upper Valais was mostly independent de facto, preparing the Republican structure that would emerge in the early modern period.
In the Grisons, similar structures of local self-government arose at the same time, with the League of God&#x27;s House founded in 1367, followed by the Grey League in 1395, both in response to the expansion of the House of Habsburg.

<text>Spetses (, &quot;Pityussa&quot;) is an island in Attica, Greece. It is counted among the Saronic Islands group. Until 1948, it was part of the old prefecture of Argolis and Corinthia Prefecture, which is now split into Argolis and Corinthia. In ancient times, it was known as Pityussa.

The island is now an independent municipality, with no internal boundaries within the municipality. The town of Spetses is the only large settlement on the island. The other settlements on the island are Moní Ayíon Pánton, Ligonéri, Ágioi Anárgyroi, Kouzoúnos. Also part of the Municipality of Spetses are the islands of Spetsopoula, Falkonera, and Velopoula (all uninhabited). The municipality has an area of 27.121 km2.

An unusual aspect of Spetses is that no private automobiles are allowed within the town limits. The most common modes of transport are walking, horse-drawn carriages, bicycles, mopeds, and motorcycles. Only taxis and delivery vehicles are allowed in the downtown area. Ferries and high-speed hydrofoils arrive regularly from the Athenian port of Piraeus.

Trails encircle the island and total about 25 to 30 km. Beaches closest to the town of Spetses include Ayios Mamas in the center of town; and Kaíki (previously College) beach to the northwest and Ayia Marina to the south, both of which offer water-sports. Public buses serve beaches further outside town, including Zogeria, Ayioi Anaryiroi, and Ayia Paraskevi.

== Etymology ==
The name of the island derives from the Medieval and Modern Greek noun σπέτσες, &quot;spétses&quot; , which in turn derives from the Italian and Venetian &quot;spezie&quot; . The Ancient Greek name for the island Πιτυοῦσσα describes its forested nature &#x27;abounding in pine trees&#x27;.

==History==
The island of Spetses, located in the Mediterranean Sea, was first occupied during the Mesolithic Age, in around 8000 BC. During that period the island was connected by an isthmus to the mainland of Argolida, at the point now named Kosta. Pieces of flint from that time were found near the part of the island named Zogeria, containing a water source probably available since the same period. Other archaeological finds were located in the area of Saint Marina, the site of the first Hellenic settlement to be found on the island, dating to the 3rd millennium BC. At least three natural harbours of Spetses (Saint Marina, Saint Paraskevi and Zogeria) served as a refuge for ships carrying goods to and from the Argolis Gulf during the peak of the State of Lerna (about 2300 BC).

After the collapse of the State of Lerna, Spetses suffered a period of decline. Artefacts in the areas of Saint Marina and Saint Anargyroi are characteristic of the existing settlements belonging the late Mycenaean period; the 12th to 13th century BC. At the time of the Peloponnesian War, stone observatories were built at the sites of Prophet Elias and Zogeria.

Mention of the island of Spetses was made both by Strabo in the 1st century BC and Pausanias in the 2nd century AD, referring to the island as Pitiousa. The raid by the Goths in the Eastern Roman empire caused a wave of refugees to flee to Spetses, resulting in the re-settlement of the island. They were concentrated in the Old Port, which became one of the three largest cities of Argolis (including Argos and Hermione).

===Venetian and Ottoman rule===
In the 15th century, the Venetians, who had ruled the island since 1220, named it &quot;Spezia&quot; (&quot;Spice&quot;) for its position on a major traderoute that dealt in spices. Over time the name was Hellenised to &quot;Spetsai&quot; (Spetse/Spetses).

During the 18th century, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Ottomans and the Venetian expulsion, many Arvanites took refuge in Spetses in order to escape Ottoman persecution. These refugees created the old village of Spetses, in the area of Kastelli; it is fortified by a wall that reinforces the natural protection provided by the terrain. Over the years the island developed a significant naval power. The Greek Coalition, in cooperation with the Russians in the Russian-Turkish war in 1768–1774, turned the powerful merchant fleet of Spetses to a significant power against the Ottoman Empire during the so-called Orlov Revolt, also known as the &quot;Orlofika&quot;. In response to these events, in 1770 the Turks destroyed the only village on the island.

For some years after the destruction of the village, the island was deserted. It was re-occupied in 1774 by new settlers from the opposite coast of the Peloponnese after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This allowed the Russians free movement of ships in the Mediterranean. A powerful commercial fleet was recreated by using the Russian flag to establish trade routes with neighbouring countries. Merchant seafaring was the only source of livelihood for men of many of the rocky, non-arable Greek islands, and the brisk Mediterranean and Black Sea trade of the 18th and 19th centuries allowed them to prosper. They did especially and spectacularly so during the trade embargoes that were imposed during the Napoleonic Wars; Greek merchantmen and crews were willing and able to work with, or against, both belligerent sides at tremendous profit.

After the re-occupation of Spetses, the settlement began to expand beyond the Kastelli region. This growth stimulated a corresponding increase in the maritime economic activities of the island.

An Arvanite community still inhabits the island.

===War of Independence===
From 1821, the island played an important role in the Greek War of Independence, and it was the home of celebrated war heroine Laskarina Bouboulina. Her life sized statue can be seen in the main dock. Spetses was the first of the Greek islands to raise the flag of Revolution on the morning of 3 April (O.S.) 1821. Its fleet, consisting of merchant ships, played a key role in the struggle, both by participating in raids against the Turkish coast and the siege of fortresses in the Peloponnese. Particularly important is the involvement of the Spetsiote fleet in sieges of the fortresses of Nafplion and Monemvasia and naval battles of Samos (1824) and Kafireas (1825). Along with their counterparts in nearby Hydra, Spetsiote captains were so wealthy they had been hoarding their gold in wells, a wealth that they tapped to fund the war of liberation.
Several ships have been named after the island, including modern Hydra class frigate &quot;F 453 Spetsai&quot;, the World War 2-era Greek destroyer Spetsai (D83), and the historic Greek battleship &quot;Spetsai&quot;.

===Modern===
The Poseidonion Hotel was built by Sotirios Anargyros, descendant of a great 18th-century Spetsiot shipping family. His branch of the family had fallen on hard times, and he emigrated to the United States as a young man in 1868, when Spetses was declining as a maritime center. In 1899 he returned from the US, now a wealthy tobacco tycoon and started to transform the island of his youth. He built a mansion and met with rich Athenians who visited Spetses from August to October, in order to hunt the turtledoves and quail migrating between Africa and Europe. Anagyros had pine seedlings planted in the hills. In the early 21st century, the island is one of the most wooded in the southern Aegean.

He saw the need for a comfortable hotel and built the Poseidonion in the style of its French Mediterranean models, the Carlton in Cannes (1911) and the Negresco in Nice (1912). The hunters could bring along their wives and children to enjoy the comfort of the hotel, the spa, donkey rides, dancing to the orchestra in the evening, and mixed bathing on the beaches across the channel. The Poseidonion rapidly became the favorite vacation spot for high society, royalty, and the rich Athenians who came to enjoy a small slice of the grand life.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the island attracted a number of wealthy Greek vacationers from Athens and elsewhere, who owned second villas or lived on their large yachts in the port. Some had children who became students of the Anargirios School. Although some hotels had been constructed, tourists often stayed in purpose-built holiday homes. From the 1980s, the Greek vacationers were often supplanted by north European tourists, especially from Britain, who were attracted by the low cost of a holiday.

Package tours to Spetses declined and eventually ceased during the 1990s. In the early 21st century, the island&#x27;s holiday clientele is of a higher economic class and largely Greek.

The main Athenian tourist season lasts for only two months of the year, although most hotels and restaurants are open from Easter until October. Efforts are being made by officials to extend the season, by adding major events to attract visitors:

* The Spetses Classic Yacht Regatta
:In June a weekend of sailing races, starting/finishing in the straight between Spetses and Kosta. A record number of 75 yachts took part in the 2015 Regatta, which celebrated its 5th anniversary; categories were Vintage (built prior to 1947), Classic (built between 1948–1974), Spirit of Tradition (built after 1976), Traditional Caiques and Open Boats.
* The Spetses Mini Marathon
:The main event is an international marathon around the island. A race was added to the program in 2014. The mini marathon has been held since 2011. Swimming races of and have been added, as well as a children’s 1000 m. Running and swimming races are also part of the three-day program. More than 2,000 men and women participate in the running events, while over 3,000 athletes in total take part in all sports. According to the Greek press, this has become the biggest annual sporting event in Greece outside of Athens.

In September 2013, Dr Marina Lyda Coutarelli, President of the Organizing Committee and CEO of Communication Lab, was named &quot;Honorary Citizen&quot; of Spetses island. She was honored for her work and effort, with regard to the island&#x27;s development.

In the early 21st century, there was a distinct shift away from package tourism on Spetses and the island once again became fashionable among wealthier Greeks. Nowadays, the majority of visitors are Greek or independent travellers from around the world. Whilst it is still possible to find traditional lower cost rooms to rent and tavernas to eat in on the island there are now many higher priced restaurants and &#x27;boutique&#x27; hotels around the town.

== The Armáta Festival ==


On 8 September (O.S.) 1822 the Ottoman fleet, coming from Monemvasia, endeavoured to supply the town of Nafplion, which was at the time besieged by Greek forces since the spring of 1821. Sailing between Trikeri and Spetsopoula, the Turkish force confronted the combined fleets of the three nautical islands, Spetses, Hydra and Psara. The admiral of the Greek fleet, Andreas Miaoulis, gave orders to withdraw to the Gulf of Argolis, in order to outmanoeuvre the more numerous and powerful Ottoman fleet.

According to general descriptions, the battle consisted in distant and ineffectual cannonade between the two fleets. An Algerian brig was damaged by fire, having boarded by mistake a Greek fireship.

According to Spetsiot local historian Anastasios Orlandos, however, the retreat of the Ottoman fleet was the result of an attack by the fireship of Kosmas Barbatsis (1792–1887) against the Ottoman flagship. The latter fled to avoid it, followed by the other Ottoman ships. The besieged castles of Nafplion could not be relieved, and fell to the Greeks two and a half months later.

Each year, the second weekend of September is dedicated to celebratory events aimed at commemorating the events of the battle of 8 September 1822, in combination with the feast of the chapel of &quot;Panagiá Armáta&quot; (the Madonna-in-arms), near the lighthouse. The events culminate with a fictionalized re-enactment of the battle, including the torching of the Turkish flagship in the harbour, an incident not mentioned in historical depictions of the battle.

Spetses is one of nine European cities that participates in the European Network of Historical Reconstructions (Brussels, Belgium; Dublin and Cork, Ireland; Bailen, Spain; Slavkov, Czech Republic; Tewkesbury, UK; and Hydra and Spetses in Greece).

==In wider culture==
Spetses was the basis for the island of Phraxos in John Fowles&#x27; 1965 novel &quot;The Magus&quot;. Many locations described in the book actually existed, including the &quot;Lord Byron School&quot; (the private Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses) and the &quot;Villa Bourani&quot; (located on the south side of the island above a popular public beach). Both the school and villa still exist, although the house is under private ownership. Fowles himself taught English at the school between the years 1951 and 1953.

Spetses is the setting of Richard H. White&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;Miro&#x27;s Knot&quot;. The book describes real locations on Spetses in extensive detail, with a portion of the book set on Spetsopoula. As of 2024, &quot;Miro&#x27;s Knot&quot; is in development to be adapted into a feature film.

Spetses is also the basis for Catherine Lind’s 2014 novel &quot;Unexpected Journeys&quot;. Both the apartment hotel and the tavern described exist on Spetses, though under different names. All the other locations described in the book are also actual, many under their real names. The tavern sits at the corner of the old harbour, while the hotel resides just above the small pebbled beach at the end of the new harbour. In the book, one of the main characters tells the island&#x27;s history through the memories of his grandparents, and the novel&#x27;s historical descriptions are fairly accurate, amongst other things recounting the story of Laskarina Bouboulina.

Maggie Gyllenhaal&#x27;s 2021 drama &quot;The Lost Daughter&quot; and Rian Johnson&#x27;s 2022 mystery-comedy &quot;Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery&quot; were shot on Spetses.

<doc id="1057256" wikidata="Q1341156" url="?curid=1057256" title="Imperial immediacy">
<text>In the Holy Roman Empire, imperial immediacy ( or ) was the status of an individual or a territory which was defined as &#x27;immediate&#x27; () to Emperor and Empire () and not to any other intermediate authorities, while one that did not possess that status was defined as &#x27;mediate&#x27; ().
The possession of this imperial immediacy granted a constitutionally unique form of territorial authority known as &quot;territorial superiority&quot; () which had nearly all the attributes of sovereignty, but fell short of true sovereignty since the rulers of the Empire remained answerable to the Empire&#x27;s institutions and basic laws. In the early modern period, the Empire consisted of over 1,800 immediate territories, ranging in size from quite large such as Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, and Brandenburg, down to the several hundred tiny immediate estates of the Imperial knights of only a few square kilometers or less, which were by far the most numerous.

==Acquisition==

The criteria of immediacy varied and classification is difficult especially for the Middle Ages. The situation was relatively clear in the case of the cities: imperial cities were directly subject to the king&#x27;s jurisdiction and taxation, and a first list can be found in the imperial tax register of 1241. In the case of the nobility, the enfeoffment with an imperial fief and high aristocratic lineage was regarded as decisive criteria for immediacy. However, towards the end of the Middle Ages, the counts were generally considered to be immediate to the Empire, although they often had obtained their fiefs from neighboring princes. The imperial immediacy of bishops was acquired automatically when they were enfeoffed with their (prince-bishopric) and granted immunities. The situation for the prelates (abbots) was not always clear since there were some who, although recognized as immediate, had not been enfeoffed directly by the king. In the end, for the Middle Ages, the formal grant of immediacy was of relative importance; the decisive factor was the capacity to assert and enforce one&#x27;s claim to immediacy against competing claims.

The position of the princes with regard to the crown had strengthened progressively since the reign of Frederick Barbarossa (1152–1190) who restricted the immediate crown vassalage to the archbishops, bishops and imperial abbots, roughly ninety of them, and to distinguish most dukes and a selection of reliable margraves, landgraves and counts as (&quot;great imperial princes&quot;). They were intended to be the only direct vassals, apart from the Imperial who did homage within the royal household, and the royal towns which offered collective fealty. From the thirteenth century onward, the growing exclusiveness of the princes derived from their determination to enforce their preeminence and make the other lords feudally dependent on themselves, and to incorporate them into their own territorial lordships, thus making them &#x27;mediate&#x27; by cutting them off from direct legal relationship with the crown. 

During the High Middle Ages, and for those bishops, abbots, and cities then the main beneficiaries of that status, &quot;immediacy&quot; could be exacting and often meant subjection to the fiscal, military, and hospitality demands of their overlord, the Emperor. However, from the mid-13th century onwards, with the gradually diminishing importance of the Emperor, whose authority to exercise power became increasingly limited to the enforcement of legislative acts promulgated by the Imperial Diet, entities privileged by imperial immediacy eventually found themselves vested with considerable rights and powers previously exercised by the emperor.

== Gradations ==
Several immediate estates held the privilege of attending meetings of the Imperial diet in person, including an individual vote ():
* the seven prince-electors designated by the Golden Bull of 1356
* the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire
** secular: dukes, margraves, landgraves, etc.
** ecclesiastical: prince-bishops, prince-abbots and prince-provosts.

They formed the Imperial estates, together with 99 immediate counts, 40 Imperial prelates (abbots and abbesses), and 50 Imperial cities, each of whose &quot;banks&quot; only enjoyed a single collective vote ().

Further immediate estates not represented in the Imperial diet were the Imperial Knights as well as several abbeys and minor localities, the remains of those territories which in the High Middle Ages had been under the direct authority of the Emperor and since then had mostly been given in pledge to the princes.

At the same time, there were classes of &quot;princes&quot; with titular immediacy to the Emperor which they exercised rarely, if at all. For example, the Bishops of Chiemsee, Gurk, and Seckau (Sacken) were practically subordinate to the prince-archbishop of Salzburg, but were formally princes of the Empire.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Additional advantages might include the rights to collect taxes and tolls, to hold a market, to mint coins, to bear arms, and to conduct legal proceedings. The last of these might include the so-called (&quot;blood court&quot;) through which capital punishment could be administered. These rights varied according to the legal patents granted by the emperor.

As pointed out by Jonathan Israel, the Dutch province of Overijssel in 1528 tried to arrange its submission to Emperor Charles V (who was also King of Spain) in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor rather than as Duke of Burgundy. If successful, that would have evoked Imperial immediacy and would have put Overijssel in a stronger negotiating position, for example giving the province the ability to appeal to the Imperial Diet in any debate with Charles. For that reason, the Emperor strongly rejected and blocked Overijssel&#x27;s attempt. 

Disadvantages might include direct intervention by imperial commissions, as happened in several of the southwestern cities after the Schmalkaldic War, and the potential restriction or outright loss of previously held legal patents. Immediate rights might be lost if the Emperor and/or the Imperial Diet could not defend them against external aggression, as occurred in the French Revolutionary wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The Treaty of Lunéville in 1801 required the emperor to renounce all claims to the portions of the Holy Roman Empire west of the Rhine. At the last meeting of the Imperial Diet () in 1802–03, also called the German mediatisation, most of the free imperial cities and the ecclesiastic states lost their imperial immediacy and were absorbed by several dynastic states.

<text>Although Australia is mostly arid, the nation is a major agricultural producer and exporter, with around 421,000 people employed in agriculture, forestry and fishing as of 2023. Agriculture&#x27;s farm gate output was $100 billion a year for a 5.7% share of GDP in 2023. Farmers and grazers own 135,997 farms, covering 61% of Australia&#x27;s landmass. Across the country, there is a mix of irrigation and dry-land farming. The success of Australia in becoming a major agricultural power despite the odds is facilitated by its policies of long-term visions and promotion of agricultural reforms that greatly increased the country&#x27;s agricultural industry.
There are three main zones: the high rainfall zone of Tasmania and a narrow coastal zone (used principally for dairying and beef production); wheat, sheep zone (cropping (principally winter crops), and the grazing of sheep (for wool, lamb and mutton) plus beef cattle) and the pastoral zone (characterised by low rainfall, less fertile soils, and large scale pastoral activities involving the grazing of beef cattle and sheep for wool and mutton). An indicator of the viability of agriculture in the state of South Australia is whether the land is within Goyder&#x27;s Line.

==History==
Agriculture in Australia has a lively history. Aboriginal Australians have been variously described as hunter-gatherer-cultivators and proto-farmers, as there is evidence that farming activities were undertaken prior to the arrival of Europeans, including tilling, planting and irrigating. However, these practices were non-industrialised and complementary to hunting, gathering and fishing. Whether the people could be termed agriculturalists is controversial. In 1788, the first European settlers brought agricultural technology from their homelands which radically changed the dominant practices. After some initial failures, wool dominated in the 19th century and, in the first half of the 20th century, dairying increased in its popularity, driven by technological changes like canning and refrigeration.

Meat exports were very significant in the development of Australian agriculture. By 1925, there were 54 export freezing works, capable of killing 6000 cattle and 90,000 sheep and lambs daily. Initially, the meat for British markets had to be frozen, but later beef could be exported chilled.

=== 2000-2019 ===
At the turn of the millennium, Australia produced a large variety of primary products for export and domestic consumption. Australia&#x27;s production in the first five years was as follows:

Australia&#x27;s main crops were contrasting in preferred climate: sugar cane (typical of tropical countries), wheat and barley (typical of cold countries).

In 2018, Australia was the world&#x27;s largest producer of lupin bean (714 thousand tons), the world&#x27;s second largest producer of chickpeas (1 million tons), the world&#x27;s fourth largest producer of barley (9.2 million tons) and oats (1.2 million tons), the 5th largest producer of rapeseed (3.9 million tons), the 9th largest producer of sugarcane (33.5 million tons) and wheat (20.9 million tons) and the 13th largest producer of grape (1.66 million tons). In the same year, the country also produced 1.2 million tons of sorghum, 1.1 million tons of potato, in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, such as rice (635 thousand tons), maize (387 thousand tons), tomato (386 thousand tons), orange (378 thousand tons), fava beans (377 thousand tons), banana (373 thousand tons), pea (317 thousand tons), carrot (284 thousand tons), onion (278 thousand tons), apple (268 thousand tons), lentils (255 thousand tons), melon (224 thousand tons), watermelon (181 thousand tons), tangerine (138 thousand tons) etc.

===2019===
Late in 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began, and Australian agriculture was heavily impacted by the resulting supply chain issues. The scarcity of freight space and disruption to Chinese New Year purchases was particularly painful, with China being Australia&#x27;s largest export market and a particularly large buyer of live seafood.

==== China Tariffs ====

In May, the Australian government proposed an independent investigation of the origin of COVID-19. Shortly afterwards, China placed large restrictions on their imports of a number of Australian agricultural products, as well as coal. Agriculture is one of Australia&#x27;s most trade-exposed economic sectors.

==== Labour shortages ====
The agricultural workforce was heavily reliant on international workers, and by the end of 2020, the pandemic resulted in a severe shortage of farm workers across the country. Much produce could not be picked, with losses estimated at $22 million, thanks to a backpacker workforce diminished from 200,000 to 52,000. The shortage lingered through 2021, with skilled labour also in short supply, leading to calls to double Australia&#x27;s skilled migrant uptake.

== Products ==

===Crops===
Cereals, oilseeds and grain legumes are produced on a large scale in Australia for human consumption and livestock feed. Wheat is the cereal with the greatest production in terms of area and value to the Australian economy. Sugarcane, grown in tropical Australia, is also an important crop; however, the unsubsidised industry (while lower-cost than heavily subsidised European and American sugar producers) is struggling to compete with the huge and much more efficient Brazilian sugarcane industry.

===Horticulture===

In 2005, McDonald&#x27;s Australia Ltd announced it would no longer source all its potatoes for fries from Tasmanian producers and announced a new deal with New Zealand suppliers. Subsequently, Vegetable and Potato Growers Australia (Ltd.) launched a political campaign advocating protectionism.

===Viticulture===

Although the Australian wine industry enjoyed a large period of growth during the 1990s, overplanting and oversupply led to a large drop in the value of wine, forcing out of business some winemakers, especially those on contracts to large wine-producing companies. At the time, the future for some Australian wine producers seemed uncertain, but by 2015 a national study showed that the industry had recovered and the combined output of grape growing and winemaking were major contributors to the Australian economy&#x27;s gross output while the associated industry of wine tourism had also expanded. A follow-up report from 2019 demonstrated further consolidation, by which stage wine had become Australia&#x27;s fifth-largest agricultural export industry, with domestic and international sales contributing AU$45.5 billion to gross output.

Wine producers were impacted by the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season, with Adelaide Hills losing 30% of its vineyards. Grapes around the country were affected by smoke, with the smell affecting the wine produced.

=== Beef industry ===
The beef industry is the largest agricultural enterprise in Australia, and it is the second largest beef exporter, behind Brazil, in the world. All states and territories of Australia support cattle breeding in a wide range of climates. Cattle production is a major industry that covers an area in excess of 200 million hectares. The Australian beef industry is dependent on export markets, with over 60% of Australian beef production exported, primarily to the United States, Korea and Japan.
In southern Australia (NSW, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and south-western Western Australia) beef cattle are often reared on smaller properties as part of a mixed farming or grazing operation, but some properties do specialise in producing cattle. The southern calves are typically reared on pasture and sold as weaners, yearlings or steers at about two years old or older. Artificial insemination and embryo transfer are more commonly used in stud cattle breeding in Australia, but may be used in other herds.

In the Top End, sub-tropical areas and in arid inland regions, cattle are bred on native pastures on expansive cattle stations. Anna Creek Station in South Australia, Australia is the world&#x27;s largest working cattle station. The North Australian Pastoral Company Pty Limited (NAPCO) is now one of Australia&#x27;s largest beef cattle producers, with a herd of over 180,000 cattle and fourteen cattle stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Australian Agricultural Company (AA Co) manages a cattle herd of more than 585,000 herd. Heytesbury Beef Pty Ltd owns and manages over 200,000 herd of cattle across eight stations spanning the East Kimberley, Victoria River and Barkly Tablelands regions in Northern Australia.

Prior to European settlement, there were no cattle in Australia. The present herd consists principally of British and European breeds (Bos taurus) in the southern regions, with Aberdeen Angus and Herefords being the most common. In northern Australia, Bos indicus breeds predominate along with their crosses. They were introduced to combine the resistance to cattle ticks and greater tolerance to hot weather.

In 1981, the industry was shaken by the Australian meat substitution scandal, which revealed that horse and kangaroo meat had been both exported overseas and sold domestically as beef.

===Dairy===

Domestic milk markets were heavily regulated until the 1980s, particularly for milk used for domestic fresh milk sales. This protected smaller producers in the northern states who produced exclusively for their local markets. The Kerin Plan (named after politician John Kerin) began the process of deregulation in 1986. The final price supports were removed in 2000 with the assistance of Pat Rowley, head of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation and the Australian Dairy Industry Council. Deregulation ultimately saw 13,000 Australian dairy farmers produce 10 billion litres of milk in comparison to the 5 billion litres of milk produced by 23,000 farmers prior to deregulation, a 30% reduction in farmers with a 55% rise in milk production. As the Australian dairy industry grows, feedlot systems are becoming more popular.

===Fisheries===
 The fisheries in Australia is a very large scale industry. Australia produces many species of fish, including farmed, sustainable and intensive, and wild caught such as tuna and other schooling fish.

===Seaweeds===
The shorelines, especially the Great Barrier Reef, are providing motivation to help the continent by using seaweed (algae) to absorb nutrients. Because of the giant number of natural Australian seaweeds, not only could seaweed cultivation be used to help absorb nutrients around the GBR and other Australian shores, cultivation could also help feed a large part of the world. Even the Chinese, who could be considered far more advanced in seaweed cultivation, are interested in the future of Australian seaweeds. Lastly, the GBR itself, because of the delicate corals, has lent itself to utilising seaweed/algae purposely as a nutrient reduction tool in the form of algae.

===Olives===
Olives have been grown in Australia since the early 1800s. Olive trees were planted by the warden of the self-funded penal settlement on St Helena Island, Queensland in Moreton Bay. By the mid-90s, there were of olives, and from 2000 to 2003 passed . By 2014 (Ravetti and Edwards, 2014) there were 2000 plantations, covering over , and producing of olives. were used as table olives and around exported to the United States, China, the European Union, New Zealand and Japan. Between 2009 and 2014, Australia imported an average of predominantly from Spain, Italy and Greece. China&#x27;s olive oil consumption is increasing, and Chinese investors have begun to buy Australian olive farms. Olive cultivars include Arbequina, Arecuzzo, Barnea, Barouni, Coratina, Correggiola, Del Morocco, Frantoio, Hojiblanca, Jumbo Kalamata, Kalamata, Koroneiki, Leccino, Manzanillo, Pendulino, Picholine, Picual, Sevillano, UC13A6, and Verdale. Manzanillo, Azapa, Nab Tamri and South Australian Verdale produce table olives.

===Wool===
Australia is the world&#x27;s largest producer of wool. The Australian wool industry was worth $3.6 billion in 2022. The total number of sheep is estimated to be 75 million. In the late 1980s, the sheep flock was 180 million. Only 5% of Australia&#x27;s wool clip is processed onshore. The Merino produces fine wool and was first introduced to Australia in 1797, with the breed being well-suited to the Australian environment. By the 1870s Australia had become the world&#x27;s greatest wool-growing nation.

==Issues facing Australian agriculture==

===Political values===
Historian F.K. Crowley finds that:
: Australian farmers and their spokesman have always considered that life on the land is inherently more virtuous, more healthy, more important and more productive than living in the towns and cities. The farmers complained that something was wrong with an electoral system which produced parliamentarians who spent money beautifying vampire-cities instead of developing the interior.

The Country Party, from the 1920s to the 1970s, promulgated its version of agrarianism, which it called &quot;countrymindedness&quot;. The goal was to enhance the status of the graziers (operators of sheep properties) and small farmers and justified subsidies for them.

=== Water management ===
Water management is a major issue in Australia. The nation is struggling with over-allocation issues and increasing variability. Effectively governing such issues has proven to be problematic. Public institutions responsible for water management include the Murray–Darling Basin Authority, which manages water resources in the Murray–Darling basin, Australia&#x27;s largest river catchment.

Because of Australia&#x27;s large deserts and irregular rainfall, irrigation is necessary for agriculture in some parts of the country. The total gross value of irrigated agricultural production in 2004-05 was A$9,076 million compared to A$9,618 million in 2000–01. The gross value of irrigated agricultural production represents around a quarter (23%) of the gross value of agricultural commodities produced in Australia in 2004–05, on less than 1% of agricultural land.

Of the 12,191 GL of water consumed by agriculture in 2004–05, dairy farming accounted for 18% (2,276 GL), pasture 16% (1,928 GL), cotton 15% (1,822 GL) and sugar 10% (1,269 GL).

=== Environmental issues ===
In 2006, the CSIRO, the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia, forecast that climate change will cause decreased precipitation over much of Australia and that this will exacerbate existing challenges to water availability and quality for agriculture.

Climate change has damaged farming productivity, reducing broadacre farm profits by an average of 22% since 2000. In 2023, the Department of Agriculture published a National Statement on Climate Change and Agriculture, exploring resilience in the agriculture sector.

Agriculture contributes 13% of Australia&#x27;s total greenhouse emissions, however, much of this is methane of biological origin, rather than from fossil fuels.

Although native, kangaroos have been known to destroy fences and eat cattle feed, sometimes in problematic numbers.

===Organic farming===

As of 2021, $2.3 billion worth of commodities were produced in Australia by the organic agriculture sector, representing approximately 3% of agricultural output.
Australia leads the world with 35 million hectares certified organic, which is 8.8% of Australia&#x27;s agricultural land and Australia now accounts for more than half (51%) of the world&#x27;s certified organic agriculture hectares.

=== Genetic modification ===
GM grains are widely grown in all states and territories in Australia with the exception of Tasmania, which is the last state to maintain a moratorium against GM. GM crops are regulated under a national scheme by the Gene Technology Regulator, through the Gene Technology Act 2000. As of 2022, there are four GM crops approved to be grown in Australia: cotton, safflower, carnations and canola. In particular, 99.5% of cotton growers in Australia use GM cotton.

===Foreign land ownership===
Australia has seen a major increase in foreign ownership of agriculture in the 2010s. According to a report in 2020, it was found that the amount of Australian agricultural land in foreign ownership, increased slightly from 13.4 to 13.8 percent.

A 2016 Lowy Institute poll found that 87% of respondents were against the Federal Government allowing foreign companies to buy Australian agricultural land a 6% points higher than a similar survey four years ago.

A 2022 ABC&#x27;s Vote Compass Poll found that 88% of Australians want tighter controls on foreign ownership of farm land, which is an increase from Compass poll results in 2013 and 2016.

=== Animal welfare and live exports ===

Animal welfare has caused public concern, with exports of live animals particularly scrutinised. The practice of exporting live animals has received strong public opposition (a petition carrying 200,000 signatures of people opposed to live export was tabled in parliament) and opposition from the RSPCA because of cruelty.

In 2022, the Labor Party committed to ending live exports of sheep, if elected. In 2023, they commenced the process, however, it is not likely to be completed within the government&#x27;s first term.

In 2006, animal rights organisations including PETA promoted a boycott of Merino wool, as a protest against the practice of mulesing, a procedure used to prevent the animals from becoming fly blown with maggots. In 2004, due to the worldwide attention, AWI proposed to phase out the practice by the end of year 2010; this promise was retracted in 2009.

In 2022, new regulations for chicken welfare were introduced.

===Farm safety===
Farming is the most dangerous occupation in Australia. 55 farmers died while working in 2022. Accidents involving tractors accounted for 20 per cent and quad bikes for 14 per cent of deaths.

=== Information Technology ===
Drone technology, Self driver tractors, Online Marketplaces are recent and growing trends. There is little standardisation and no accreditation authorities, though the CSIRO and other independent organisations have evaluated individual developments, the lack of a coordinated approach and lead agency restricts developments and risks Australia&#x27;s competitiveness.

== Public governance ==
Before the Federation of Australia in 1901, individual state governments bore responsibility for agriculture. As part of the federation, the Department of Commerce and Agriculture was created to help develop the agricultural industry. The newly created Department of Trade and Customs had additional responsibilities for sugar agreements, as well as cotton.

These responsibilities were merged into a single agricultural department in 1956. Since the merger, the department responsible for agriculture has been renamed and re-structured many times:

* 1956–1974 - Department of Primary Industry 
* 1974–1975 - Department of Agriculture 
* 1975–1987 - Department of Primary Industry 
* 1987–1998 - Department of Primary Industries and Energy 
* 1998–2013 - Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
* 2013–2015 - Department of Agriculture 
* 2015–2019 - Department of Agriculture and Water Resources 
* 2019–2020 - Department of Agriculture 
* 2020–2022 - Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment 
* 2022– Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry

<doc id="1057264" wikidata="Q447101" url="?curid=1057264" title="Kiki Dee">
<text>Pauline Matthews (born 6 March 1947), better known by her stage name Kiki Dee, is an English pop singer. Known for her blue-eyed soul vocals, she was the first female singer from the UK to sign with Motown&#x27;s Tamla Records.

Dee is best known for the hit singles &quot;Amoureuse&quot; (1973), &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Music in Me&quot; (1974) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;, her 1976 duet with Elton John, which reached number 1 on the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. Her 1981 single &quot;Star&quot; became the theme song for the talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; when it was revived by the BBC in 1987. In 1993, she performed another duet with John for his &quot;Duets&quot; album, a cover version of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;True Love&quot;, which reached number 2 in the UK. During her career, she has released 40 singles, three EPs and 12 albums.

==Early life==
Dee was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. At the age of 10 she won a local talent contest, and at 16 she had her first paid job in show business. &quot;I realised when I sang at family parties and Christmases I&#x27;d suddenly get everyone&#x27;s attention and, being the youngest of three, I thought what a brilliant attention-seeking ploy it was&quot;, stated Dee in a 2013 interview. She added: &quot;My older brother had a lot of Elvis on vinyl and really that was my first introduction to music during the Fifties.&quot;

Aged 16, Dee worked at Boots in Bradford during the day, while in the evenings she sang songs with a dance band in Leeds. A record scout liked her singing and invited her to London for an audition. There, in 1963, she signed as a solo artist to Fontana Records.

==Career==
===Musician===
After singing with a local band in Bradford in the early 1960s, Dee began her recording career as a session singer. She sang backing vocals for Dusty Springfield, among others, but did not achieve solo success in the UK for many years. In 1963, Dee released her first single, &quot;Early Night&quot;, the first of eleven singles on Fontana, none of which reached the charts. Her 1966 release &quot;Why Don&#x27;t I Run Away From You&quot; (a cover of Tami Lynn&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Run Away From You&quot;) was a big hit on Radio London and Radio Caroline, and she sang the B-side &quot;Small Town&quot; in her appearance in &quot;Dateline Diamonds&quot; the same year. Also in 1966, she achieved wider coverage by singing &quot;Take a Look at Me&quot; in the hit comedy, &quot;Doctor in Clover&quot;. She brought out an EP, &quot;Kiki In Clover&quot; – which included &quot;Take a Look at Me&quot; – at the same time as the film&#x27;s release. She was one of the backing vocalists on Love Affair&#x27;s 1968 UK number one single &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;.

She recorded her debut album, &quot;I&#x27;m Kiki Dee&quot;, in 1968 which included a series of Phil Spector-style tracks and covers. Her 1968 release &quot;On a Magic Carpet Ride&quot;, which was originally a B-side, has remained popular on the northern soul circuit. Much of her early recorded work for Fontana Records, was released on 24 January 2011, on the CD compilation &quot;I&#x27;m Kiki Dee&quot;.

Songwriter Mitch Murray created her stage name, and penned her first single, &quot;Early Night&quot;. In the United States she became the first white British artist to be signed by Motown, releasing her first Motown single in 1970.

In the days before BBC Radio 1, Dee was a regular performer of cover versions on BBC Radio, and she starred with a group of session singers in the BBC Two singalong series, &quot;One More Time&quot;. She also appeared in an early episode of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; in January 1971, performing the Blood, Sweat and Tears hit, &quot;You&#x27;ve Made Me So Very Happy&quot;. Nevertheless, it was only after she signed with Elton John&#x27;s label, The Rocket Record Company, that she became a household name in the UK. Her first major solo hits were &quot;Amoureuse&quot; (written by Véronique Sanson, with English lyrics by Gary Osborne) (1973) and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Music in Me&quot; (written by Tobias Stephen Boshell), the latter credited to the Kiki Dee Band (1974). In addition to her burgeoning career as a lead vocalist, she could sometimes be heard singing backing vocals on various John recordings, such as &quot;All the Girls Love Alice&quot; from &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; and various tracks on &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;. 

Her biggest hit came in 1976, a duet with John, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; (pseudonymously written by John and lyricist Bernie Taupin). The single reached number 1 in both the UK and US, remaining at the top for six weeks in the UK. At the end of the summer, she played as support act to Queen at their Hyde Park concert in front of a crowd of 150,000 people. Prior to the concert, in an interview for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, she stated, &quot;My confidence is at an all-time high.&quot;

After a quiet period in the late 1970s, Dee launched a comeback in 1981, releasing one of her biggest hits, &quot;Star&quot;, written by Doreen Chanter of the Chanter Sisters. This later became the theme music to the BBC1 programme &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; between 1987 and 1990. Dee joined forces again with John in 1981, recording a cover of the Four Tops&#x27; song &quot;Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever&quot; which was written by Ivy Jo Hunter and Stevie Wonder. Both of these were included on her album &quot;Perfect Timing&quot;, which became a modest hit on the album chart, and she supplied backing vocals for John&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;Too Low for Zero&quot;. Dee also sang the song &quot;What Can&#x27;t Speak Can&#x27;t Lie&quot; (1983), composed and recorded by the Japanese jazz fusion group Casiopea, and with lyrics by Gary Osborne. 
She performed at Live Aid in 1985, reprising &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; with John, and performing backing vocals on the other songs in his set. After signing to Columbia, Dee released the album &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; in 1987. She contributed backing vocals to Elton John&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;The One&quot;, and a year later recorded &quot;True Love&quot; with John for his 1993 album &quot;Duets&quot;.

Dee released the live album &quot;Almost Naked&quot;, a joint effort with Carmelo Luggeri in 1995, followed by the studio albums &quot;Where Rivers Meet&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Walk Of Faith&quot; (2005) with Luggeri. In September 2013, Dee and Luggeri released their third studio album, &quot;A Place Where I Can Go&quot;, on Spellbound Records. They have been touring together ever since and have played alongside Roger Taylor, Jack Bruce, Fish, Paul Young, Tom Robinson, Graham Gouldman and Madeline Bell.

In October 2009 she performed, with Luggeri, at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, in aid of the PRS for Music (formerly the Performing Right Society) for Music Members&#x27; Benevolent Fund.

Dee&#x27;s single &quot;Sidesteppin&#x27; with a Soul Man&quot;, released in October 2013, was her 40th single release.

Dee and Luggeri&#x27;s album &quot;Long Ride Home&quot; was released in April 2022. In November that year Dee joined Elton John on stage to sing &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; again for the final US show of his Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.

===Musical theatre===
Dee has appeared in musical theatre, including a leading role in Willy Russell&#x27;s West End musical &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, in which she took on the role originally played by Barbara Dickson for the 1988 production and recording. She received an Olivier Award nomination in 1989 in the Best Actress in a Musical category. In 1990, she contributed to the last recording studio collaboration between Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, on the album &quot;Freudiana&quot;, performing &quot;You&#x27;re On Your Own&quot; and part of &quot;No One Can Love You Better Than Me&quot;.

In 2008, Dee&#x27;s first DVD was released. &quot;Under The Night Sky&quot; was a collaboration with guitarist Carmelo Luggeri, filmed live at the Bray Studios in London; the music was produced by Ted Carfrae. That same year, several albums from her earlier 1970s–1980s Rocket catalogue were re-released by EMI Records, including an expanded edition of &quot;Almost Naked&quot; with extra tracks, such as a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; and a new take on &quot;Sugar on the Floor&quot;. The same year, Demon Records (UK) issued a remastered edition of &quot;Perfect Timing&quot;, with several bonus tracks, including an alternate mix of &quot;Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever&quot;.

Dee had previously starred in &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot; in London&#x27;s West End, at the Piccadilly Theatre, from 20 September 1984 to 8 June 1985.

In 2019, Dee was portrayed by actress Rachel Muldoon in the Elton John biopic &quot;Rocketman&quot;.

<text>The Urengoy gas field in the northern West Siberia Basin is the world&#x27;s second largest natural gas field after South Pars / North Dome Gas-Condensate field. It lies in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, Tyumen Oblast, Russia, just south of the Arctic Circle. It is named after the settlement of Urengoy. The gas field is operated by Gazprom Dobycha Urengoy and serviced by the town of Novy Urengoy, founded in 1973.

==History==
Urengoy gas field was discovered in June 1966. The first drilling hole hit gas on 6 July 1966 and the field started production in 1978. On 25 February 1981, Urengoy extracted its first one hundred billion cubic meters (1011 m3) of natural gas. From January 1984, Urengoy gas started to be exported to Western Europe through the Urengoy–Pomary–Uzhhorod pipeline. A fire hit the Urengoy in 2021 which led to an increase in natural gas prices. In June 2022 the gas field caught fire again.

==Production==
The Urengoyskoye conventional gas field has over ten trillion cubic meters (1013 m3) in total deposits. It recovered by the end of 2021 more than 90% of its reserves. Its current output is six times lower than at its peak from 1985 to 1996, but this accounts still to 3% of the country&#x27;s natural gas output.
The Urengoy gas field extracts 230 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year, plus condensate and oil. In September 2013, Gazprom announced that a total of 6.5 trillion cubic meters of gas had been produced.

<text>Göd () is a small city in Pest County, Hungary.

== Location ==
The city is northeast of Budapest.

==Economy==
Göd has a thriving tourist trade. It has a thermal spa open almost 365 days a year with water rich in minerals.

Along the M2 motorway
Göd is the second town to the north of Budapest, and the first one without large socialist-era housing estates. That is, the green belt around Budapest starts with Göd on the left bank of the Danube.

The Samsung SDI Hungary plant is one of Samsung SDI&#x27;s trio of advanced Lithium-ion automotive battery production facilities: the others are in Ulsan (Korea) and Xi&#x27;an (China). The plant at Göd is not far from the Austria-based battery pack division of Magna Steyr which was acquired by Samsung SDI in 2015 for $120 million. In 2016-2017, the Ulsan plant trained several employees for the Hungary plant. The Ulsan plant had supplied the BMW i3, but the Hungary plant will provide the BMW i3, i5, and X5 with advanced Li-ion batteries.

== Infrastructure ==
Göd is connected to Budapest (via Dunakeszi, southbound) and to Vác (via Sződliget, northbound) by railway and public roads. On an average weekday, there are buses and trains every 30 minutes to both directions. Vác is 15 minutes by car and by train, and 25 minutes by bus. Budapest Nyugati railway station is 30 minutes by train. Because of these benefits, Göd is sometimes categorized as a dormitory town, but it has a vivid social life: civil organizations, churches, galleries, clubs, a monthly newspaper, that make it different from an average dormitory town.

== Gallery ==
== Famous people ==
* Eugene Wigner – physicist, Nobel-prize winner;
* – biologist, cancer researcher, founder of the Biology Research Centre of Göd;
* Fülöp Beck Ö – sculptor;
* – ballet-dancer;
* Kálmán Latabár – actor;
* Mór Kóczán – sportsman, athlete (javelin throw), Olympic bronze medalist, Hungarian champion;

* Zoltán Kammerer – sportsman (kayak), World Champion, European Champion, Olympic Gold winner;
* Colonel – hero of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848;
* Gábor Koncz – actor;
* László Arany – poet (son of János Arany)

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Göd is twinned with:
* Marignane, France
* Monthey, Switzerland
* Paleu, Romania
* Yanoshi, Ukraine

==Sport==
The local sports and football team is Gödi SE.

<doc id="1057268" wikidata="Q110877008" url="?curid=1057268" title="Castration complex">
<text>The [[castration]] complex is a concept developed by Sigmund Freud, first presented in 1908, initially as part of his theorisation of the transition in early childhood development from the polymorphous perversity of infantile sexuality to the ‘infantile genital organisation’ which forms the basis for adult sexuality. The trauma induced by the child’s discovery of anatomical difference between the sexes (presence or absence of the penis) gives rise to the fantasy of female emasculation or castration.

== Phallic stage ==
According to Freud the early stages of the child’s psychosexual development are characterised by polymorphous perversity and a bisexual disposition, and are the same for both sexes. Up to and including the phallic stage of this development the penis and clitoris are the leading erogenous zones. Once the castration complex is initiated with the child’s discovery and puzzlement over the anatomical difference between the sexes (presence or absence of the penis), it makes the assumption that this difference is due to the female&#x27;s penis having been cut off or mutilated. The libidinal equivalence of penis/clitoris, based on the recognition by the child of only one genital organ, gives way to the fantasy that females have been castrated. This entails a legacy of castration anxiety for the boy and penis envy for the girl.
== Oedipus Complex ==
Freud argued that the castration complex is closely linked to the Oedipus Complex, especially with its prohibitive and normative function. The structure and consequences of the castration complex are different for the boy and the girl, terminating the Oedipus Complex for the boy, initiating it for the girl. For the boy, anatomical difference (the possession of a penis), induces castration anxiety as a result of an assumed paternal threat made in response to his sexual thoughts and activities. In the case of the girl the absence of a penis is experienced as a deprivation, a wrong suffered which she attempts to deny, remedy or compensate for by seeking to have her own child. Accordingly the girl’s castration complex leads to the redirection of her libidinal desires toward the father and away from the mother, whom she resents for depriving her of the penis, and the concomitant displacement of the clitoris by the vagina as the leading erogenous zone.

== Primal phantasy ==
In his later work Freud includes the castration complex in the category of primal phantasies that are universal in their derivation from the incest taboo, the necessary founding condition for all human social and cultural formations. As such they have their effects independently of the individual subject&#x27;s specific cultural setting.

<doc id="1057284" wikidata="Q622049" url="?curid=1057284" title="Gidget (film)">
<text>Gidget is a 1959 American CinemaScope comedy film directed by directed by Paul Wendkos and starring Sandra Dee, Cliff Robertson, James Darren, Arthur O&#x27;Connell, and the Four Preps.

The film is about a teenager&#x27;s initiation into the California surf culture and her romance with a young surfer.

The film was the first of many screen appearances by the character Gidget, created by Hollywood writer Frederick Kohner (based on his daughter Kathy). The screenplay was written by Gillian Houghton, who was then head writer of the soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot;, using the pen name Gabrielle Upton. This would be Upton&#x27;s sole contribution to the Gidget canon. The story was based on Kohner&#x27;s 1957 novel &quot;Gidget, the Little Girl with Big Ideas&quot;.

The film, which received one award nomination, not only inspired various sequel films, a television series, and television films, but is also considered the beginning of the entire &quot;beach party film&quot; genre. &quot;Gidget&quot; is credited by numerous sources (&quot;Stoked! A History of Surf Culture&quot; by Drew Kampion; &quot;The Encyclopedia of Surfing&quot; by Matt Warshaw; and &quot;Riding Giants&quot;, a documentary film by Stacy Peralta—to name just three) as the single biggest factor in the mainstreaming of surfing culture in the United States.

==Plot==
Francine Lawrence is about to turn 17 and is on her summer break between her junior and senior years of high school. She resists the pressure to go &quot;man-hunting&quot; with her girlfriends and laments the days when the girls had fun together without boys. Francine also rejects her parents wishing to fix her up on a date with the son of a friend of the family, Jeffrey Matthews.

On a jaunt to the beach with her well developed girlfriends, flat-chested tomboy Francine meets surfer Moondoggie. She quickly becomes infatuated with him, but he shows no romantic interest; at any rate, Francine is more attracted to surfing than man-hunting.

At home, Francine importunes her parents for $25 for a used surfboard. Russ and Dorothy Lawrence grant their daughter&#x27;s request as an early birthday present and the excited youngster returns to the beach to surf. The gang dubs their female associate &quot;Gidget&quot;, a combination of &quot;girl&quot; and &quot;midget&quot;.

Gidget associates with an all-male surfer gang led by the worldly beach bum, The Big Kahuna. Kahuna is a Korean War Air Force veteran twice the age of Gidget who is fed up with all the rules he had to live by when he flew combat missions, and dropped out of normal society. He travels the hemisphere surfing with his pet bird. Moondoggie admires Kahuna and wants to emulate him by joining Kahuna in working his way on a freighter to go surfing in Peru at summer&#x27;s end, instead of going to university as his self-made father plans. Kahuna and Gidget enjoy each other&#x27;s company, with Gidget questioning how he can survive an aimless and lonely existence without a job. She questions whether if Kahuna knew then what he knew now would he still make the same lifestyle choice after leaving the Air Force. Kahuna later reflects on Gidget&#x27;s words after the death of his only friend, the pet bird.

Hoping to make Moondoggie jealous, Gidget hires one of the other surfers in the gang to be her date to a luau party on the beach. Her plan backfires when the surfer she hired pawns the job off on none other than Moondoggie, unaware that he was the one Gidget wanted to make jealous. Gidget lies and tells Moondoggie that it is Kahuna that she wants to make jealous, and they have a romantic evening at the luau. Eventually, Moondoggie says something that upsets Gidget and, as she flees the luau, she runs into Kahuna and agrees to take him to a nearby beach house. Alone with Kahuna, Gidget tries to make Kahuna take her virginity. Amused, Kahuna attempts to call Gidget&#x27;s bluff by pretending to take her up on her offer, but finds himself falling under her spell. Realizing what he was about to do and angry at the situation he&#x27;s been put in, Kahuna throws her out of the beach house just as Moondoggie arrives. Gidget is mortified and escapes out of the back of the beach house as Moondoggie confronts Kahuna. The cops are called to break up the fight between Kahuna and Moondoggie and, after leaving the beach house, they find Gidget stranded with a flat tire and without her driver&#x27;s license. They take her in to the police station. Gidget&#x27;s father, having heard about the incident, decides to take over control of her social life, and orders her not to see the surfer gang again. Gidget feels devastated at her failure, at which point her mother points out the needlepoint sampler from her grandmother, on her own bedroom wall. She rereads it: &quot;To Be A Real Woman / Is To Bring Out The / Best In A Man&quot;.

In the end, her father arranges a date for Gidget with Jeffrey Matthews that she grudgingly accepts. To her surprise, Matthews turns out to be Moondoggie. The two return to the beach to find Kahuna tearing down his beach shack and find out that he has taken a job as an airline pilot. Moondoggie and Gidget realize how they feel about each other and, as an act of romantic devotion, Moondoggie asks Gidget to wear his class pin. Kahuna cheerfully warns Moondoggie that Gidget is quite a woman.

== Cast ==
Cast notes:
*The studio wanted Elvis Presley to play the role of Moondoggie, but he was in the United States Army at the time.
*Malibu surfers Miki Dora and Mickey Munoz appear in the surfing scenes.

==Production==

The film was shot in just 26 days during June–July 1958 at Leo Carrillo State Park and Columbia Pictures Studios. Sandra Dee originally was going to film the sequel &quot;Gidget Goes Hawaiian&quot; but didn&#x27;t. Rose Marie Reid designed all of the women&#x27;s swimsuits in the film.

==Reception==
===Contemporary domestic reviews===
Howard Thompson wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot; of April 23, 1959, &quot;[The film] is enough to make anybody leave one of the neighborhood theatres, where it opened yesterday, and light out for Long Island Sound. Pictorially, this mild little Columbia frolic, about a teen-age girl with boy trouble, seems an ideal way to usher in the beach season.&quot; He praised performers Dee, Robertson, and La Roche. A self-proclaimed &quot;Screen Scout&quot; for the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote that &quot;the studio should have released it for the birds. Even Sandra Dee, cute as she is, couldn&#x27;t save this one.&quot; Margaret Harford of the &quot;Los Angeles Mirror&quot; wrote that &quot;Gabrielle Upton&#x27;s screenplay forestalls censorship troubles. In her well-written script, overheated romance boils down to a wholesome and virtuous little frolic on the beach. And a crew of attractive young performers keeps things lively with seldom a dull moment.&quot; Harold Whitehead of the Montreal &quot;Gazette&quot; said that &quot;this is a pretty aimless little item about surf-board acrobats and their peculiar views on life, but it is saved from complete lack of point by a charming performance from Sandra Dee, a pert little blonde teen-ager who is making a name for herself in the movies these days.&quot; A critic using the G.H.A. in the &quot;Montreal Star&quot; called it &quot;a pleasant little comedy-romance [...] in which the teenagers are depicted as healthy and attractive young people— none of them are suffering from frustration or neurosis, none of them are juvenile delinquents. and none of them an psychopathic cases.&quot; A critic for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; remarked that &quot;adolescense is so seldom lensed without distortion that &quot;Gidget&quot; is a welcome sight for eyes sorely tired of the delinquency angle. Treated with neither acid nor saccharine, the film achieves a reasonably good facsimile of the aging teens. Even better, perhaps, is the &#x27;flair for comedy in both dialogue and situation.&quot; Marjory Adams of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; remarked called the film &quot;sparking and very youthful entertainment, designed to appeal to those under 25, but the intelligence of the adult theatregoer won&#x27;t be insulted.&quot; Myles Standish opened his review in the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; by writing: Helen Bower of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; called the film &quot;summer sea-sand-and-sun fun&quot; and noted that &quot;older people can enjoy watching the bright, happy young ones idling away the hours on the Pacific ocean beach at Mali-bu, where much of the movie is set. They&#x27;ll see some quite exciting surfboard riding, too, in the sport imported from our 50th state.&quot; Mildred Martin of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; wrote that &quot;the film is spiked with a song or two, spends endless Eastman Colored CinemaScope footage on &quot;riding the curl&quot; and other aspects of surfboarding and fairly crawls with energetic, carefree youth in all types of bathing costumes.&quot; R.H. Gardner of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that &quot;it would be ironic if in the rubble of our present civilization, future generations unearthed a print of &quot;Gidget,&quot; for, after seeing it, they&#x27;d never understand the kind of people we were. The film, now at the Stanley, is in my experience unique. Its characters—answering to the names of Moondoggie, Kahoona, Lover Boy, B. L., Hot Shot, Waikiki, Lord Byron, etc.—look like human beings instead of shaggy dogs, cartoon creations or science-fiction monsters, but their behavior brands them as products of a culture with which I am totally unfamiliar.&quot; Kaspar Monahan of &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; wrote that &quot;although &quot;Gidget&quot; was obviously designed to appeal to the younger set, there&#x27;s no law against an oldster viewing it and even enjoying it. In fact, I found the new arrival at the Harris a most refreshing and original slant on the troubles and problems besetting a young maiden on the threshold of womanhood.&quot; Leonard Mendlowitz of the &quot;Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;there are no weighty problems or significant messages in this light and bright musical, might well have been called &#x27;How Frannie Got her Fraternity Pin.&#x27;&quot;

===Contemporary international reviews===
The film received generally negative reviews in other continents. Campbell Dixon stated, in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Swedish director Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Journey Into Autumn&quot;, &quot;which will corrupt nobody&#x27;s morals, has an &#x27;X&#x27; certificate. &quot;Gidget&quot;, a moronic story for teenagers about a girl suffering from sex in the head, is &#x27;U&#x27;, presumably because she is only 16 and, if she does succeed in getting herself seduced after long and patient effort, it will be all in girlish fun. Am I alone in finding these values a little odd?&quot; John Waterman of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; described Sandra Dee as &quot;acting valiantly and with a background of brilliantly photographed surf-riding.&quot; Margaret Winxman of the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; said that &quot;when it comes to chilling the spine, you can keep your electro-plated invaders from outer space, mangled marrows from the interior of the earth and finned things from the bottom of the sea. For me the most terrifying Monster of the lot is the all-American teenager—at least, as currently portrayed in &quot;Gidget&quot;. It isn&#x27;t the noise they make—which is deafening. It isn&#x27;t the lingo, they speak-which is untranslatable: It isn&#x27;t even the capers they cut—which are maddening. It&#x27;s their devilish disregard for anybody else&#x27;s feelings, comfort or dignity which is so appalling. (Parents, of course, being strictly from &#x27;squaresville,&#x27; are quite expendable.) And these, mark you. are supposed to be &quot;nice&quot; teenagers.&quot; Dick Richards of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; called the film &quot;a frail little piece [that] will make anybody over the age of twenty-one feel very old and jaded.&quot; An unnamed critic for Australia&#x27;s &quot;Sun-Herald&quot; newspaper called it an &quot;unevenly coloured but passably pleasant and quite innocuous film.&quot; Colin Bennett of &quot;The Age&quot; called it &quot;a picture that might be roughly described as a tusical, or teen-agers&#x27; musical.&quot; He added: 

===Retrospective reviews===
Craig Butler in &quot;Allmovie&quot; notes, &quot;Although the very title prompts snorts of derision from many, &quot;Gidget&quot; is actually not a bad little teenaged flick from the &#x27;50s. Great art it definitely isn&#x27;t, but as frivolous, lighthearted entertainment, it more than fits the bill. Those who know it only by reputation will probably be surprised to find that it does attempt to deal with the problems of life as seen by a teenager—and that, while some of those attempts are silly, many of them come off quite well. It also paints a very convincing picture of the beach-bum lifestyle, much more so than the Frankie Avalon–Annette Funicello beach party movies.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
The film received a 1960 Golden Laurel Award nomination for Top Female Comedy Performance for actress Sandra Dee.

<doc id="1057285" wikidata="Q1305486" url="?curid=1057285" title="University of Costa Rica">
<text>The University of Costa Rica (Spanish: &quot;Universidad de Costa Rica,&quot; abbreviated UCR) is a public university in the Republic of Costa Rica, in Central America. Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria Rodrigo Facio, is located in San Pedro Montes de Oca, in the province of San José. It is the oldest and largest institution of higher learning in Costa Rica, originally established as the &quot;Universidad de Santo Tomás&quot; in 1843. Approximately 45,000 students attend UCR throughout the year.

==History==
The first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the &quot;University of Saint Thomas&quot; (&quot;Universidad de Santo Tomás&quot;), which was established in 1843. That institution maintained close ties with the Roman Catholic Church and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and anti-clerical government of President Bernardo Soto Alfaro as part of a campaign to modernize public education. The schools of law, agronomy, fine arts, and pharmacy continued to operate independently. In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia.

The UCR remained the country&#x27;s sole university until the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (&quot;Tecnológico de Costa Rica&quot;) and the National University of Costa Rica (&quot;Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica&quot;) were opened by the government in 1972 and 1973, respectively. Years later, in 1979, another public university opened: the Distance State University (&quot;Universidad Estatal a Distancia&quot;), modeled after the British Open University, and lastly the National Technical University opened in 2008 after merging several trade schools. Today, Costa Rica has those five public universities, and approximately fifty-three small private ones, but the UCR remains the largest and most well funded institution.

==Application==

Costa Rican applicants to the UCR must take an admission test. This test is similar to the SAT in the United States. The score of this test is used along with the grades from the student&#x27;s last years in high school to determine the student&#x27;s admission score, which is later used to determine admission to a specific major and financial aid. 800 is the highest possible score on the admission test and 442 is the minimum score required for admission. Students who score 800 usually appear in the front pages of Costa Rican newspapers.

Undergraduate Admission is highly selective, having an acceptance rate of approximately 25%. In 2009, out of the 31.042 that completed the admission test, only 16,593 obtained a score above the 442 points required to gain admission. Gaining admission to the university, however, does not assure admission to a chosen departmental program or major. In 2007, only 60% of those admitted to the university were accepted into their chosen major. The remaining 40% have to take classes that may not work for their major, hoping it will lift their grade point average to the level necessary in order to be admitted to the program of their liking.

International applicants must revalidate their high school certificate and grades from their country of origin at the Ministry of Public Education (&quot;Ministerio de Educación Pública&quot;) in order to apply and take the admission test. Graduate school applicants must revalidate their undergraduate certificate also.

==Campuses and local branches==
The main campus is located on a campus in San Pedro, San José (Rodrigo Facio campus). Other regional campuses are located throughout the country to reach plural eata Costa Ricans. The regional campuses are:

* Western Campus (In the city of San Ramón, Alajuela): includes a local branch in Tacares, Grecia
* Atlantic Campus (In the city of Turrialba, Cartago): includes a local branch in Paraíso, Cartago and another one in Guápiles, Limón
* Guanacaste Campus (In the city of Liberia, Guanacaste): includes a local branch in Santa Cruz
* Limon Campus (In the City of Port Limón, Limon).
* Pacific Campus (In the city of Puntarenas, Puntarenas).
* The Golfito Campus (Southern Pacific coast) (in the City of Golfito, Puntarenas).

The main campus in San Pedro offers the most diverse course curricula of any other campus, in addition to hosting the Medical School and graduate programs.

==Social relevance==
The university, while neutral on most aspects of Costa Rican life, defines itself as a secular and humanist institution. The university encourages social work and social research activities. In order to graduate, most students must work in the (University Community Service), which is organized by the university. The university maintains a prestigious position in Costa Rican society and is the most often cited governmental institution in Costa Rican media. Opinions generated on scientific, ethical and economic matters strongly influence Costa Rican policies and public sentiment. Costa Rican law requires the Costa Rican Congress to request the university&#x27;s opinion (amongst other institutions) on whether a new law should be approved or not.

UCR counts Costa Rica&#x27;s Nobel laureate Oscar Arias, ex-presidents, many ministers, and many heads of the country&#x27;s public institutions as alumni.

UCR is also part of the (National Council of University Rectors), a watchdog body that overviews higher education quality, and recognition of university-level degrees from foreign countries.

For many years, UCR grew in close partnership with public action of the State, forming the professional staff necessary for the growth of new public institutions such as the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), the Costa Rican Social Security Fund may Social (CCSS) and the State Bank.

==Reputation and rankings==

Currently, the university occupies the first place in Central America and the Caribbean, 19th place in Latin America and 511-520th place worldwide in the QS World University Rankings. In the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities it occupies the 4th place in Central America and the Caribbean, 28th in Latin America and 844 globally.

==International cooperation==
The university maintains international cooperation alliances with the DAAD (the German Academic Trust), the governments of Japan, France, Mexico, Spain, Taiwan (R.O.C.), the European Union, the OAS and United States research institutions such as the Organization for Tropical Studies, whose headquarters in Costa Rica are located within UCR&#x27;s central campus (Rodrigo Facio campus). Other universities with ties to the University of Costa Rica are: University of Florida, State University of New York at Albany, University of Texas at Austin, University of Illinois, University of Maryland, Rutgers University and the University of Kansas, which is the oldest standing agreement between two universities in the Western Hemisphere .

The university maintains academic relationships with more than 41 countries, including (in alphabetical order): Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Honduras, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jamaica, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Panama, Peru, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan (R.O.C.), Uruguay, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.

==Organization==
UCR is divided into six major academic areas: Agricultural Sciences, Arts and Letters, Basic Sciences, Engineering, Health and Social Sciences. These areas are divided into colleges, schools and departments, research centers and institutes. The Graduate Studies System offers masters and doctorate degrees in a variety of academic fields.

<text>The Biellmann spin is a difficult variation of the layback spin in figure skating. It was made popular by world champion Denise Biellmann.

== Description ==
The Biellmann spin is a difficult variation of the layback spin in figure skating. It is executed by the skater grabbing their free blade and pulling the heel of their boot behind and above the level of the head so that their legs are in an approximate full split, with the head and back arched upward. The spin demands high levels of strength and flexibility. The Biellmann increases the complexity of a skater&#x27;s short or free program only if they execute eight revolutions, in either a backward and/or sideway position without any changes, before attempting the Biellmann and if they clearly increase the speed of the spin. Advanced novice skaters must complete six revolutions before executing a Biellmann spin. Like other categories of difficult spin variations, the Biellmann is counted in a skater&#x27;s score, in both the short and free skating programs, only the first time it is completed.

The Biellmann spin was made popular by world champion Denise Biellmann. Russian figure skater Irina Slutskaya invented and was noted for the double Biellmann spin with a foot change, which is executed by the skater reaching back with their hands, grabbing the blade of one skate and pulling it straight over their head, and then performing the same action with the other skate. The Biellmann spin, due to the flexibility required in executing it, is more commonly executed by women than by men. A notable exception is two-time Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu.

<text>West of Eden is a 1984 science fiction novel by American writer Harry Harrison.

==Overview==
In the parallel universe of this novel, Earth was not struck by an asteroid 65 million years before the present. Consequently, the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event which wiped out the dinosaurs and other related reptiles never happened, leaving the way clear for an intelligent species to eventually evolve from mosasaurs, a family of Late Cretaceous marine lizards closely related to the modern monitor lizards.

The intelligent reptiloid species is called the &quot;Yilanè&quot;, and represents the dominant life form on most of the planet. However, during the evolutionary process, the species became non-viable on the North American continent and Caribbean area, leaving them free of Yilanè for millions of years and opening an ecological niche for a top predator. A human-like species, the Tanu, evolved to fill the niche in North America, but are only found on that continent. Unlike humans, which evolved from African primates, the Tanu have evolved from a lineage of New World monkey. By the time the novel begins, the humanoids have reached a late Stone Age level of technology and culture, with a number of societies having developed farming skills.

The Yilanè, having had millions of years of civilization, have a very advanced society primarily based on a mastery of the biological sciences, especially genetic engineering, so much so that almost every tool and artifact they use is a modified lifeform. Their boats were originally squids, their submarines are enhanced ichthyosaurs (here called &quot;uruketos&quot;), while their guns are modified monitor lizards which eject projectiles using pressurised gas.

The Yilanè are a matriarchal society. The females control all political, military, and scientific aspects of the culture and keep the males segregated. Males are primarily poets and artisans, and enjoy dull, pampered lifestyles. Repeated matings will kill males, so they are generally very wary of the females. The Yilanè language is incredibly complex, based on sounds, color (the Yilanè are able to alter the skin color on parts of their body, notably the hands, akin to chameleons) and body movements, and a key factor in social status among females is how well the language is mastered. As their emotions are directly and immediately translated into the movement of their bodies, Yilanè cannot lie. In order to deceive others they may only restrict their movements or go into a state of immobility until the emotion or thought has passed.

The Yilanè normally are inseparable from their society; if a city leader casts out a member of the Yilanè society, in a ritual which involves taking away her name, then the cast-out member will immediately die due to a reaction in her brain to the fear of being cast out. For this reason the Yilanè society has remained a monoculture for millions of years, with no divisions. However, by the time of the events in the novel, a new schism in the society has emerged for the first time, consisting of a group who call themselves the &quot;Daughters of Life&quot; (known as &quot;Daughters of Death&quot; to outsiders). The Daughters of Life are the first to reject the regimented society of the Yilanè, in favour of a higher power, the &quot;Spirit of Life&quot;. Because of this belief in a power greater than that of the society&#x27;s leaders, the usual fatal reaction to being cast out does not occur when a Daughter of Life is expelled by a leader.

==Plot==
The story revolves around the eventual discovery of the American continents by the Yilanè, who are searching for new resources and territories for colonization. Being reptiloid and cold-blooded, they target tropical and sub-tropical zones.

Eventually, they encounter the humanoids, whom they regard as barely sentient animals. The humanoids, in their turn, are terrified of the Yilanè. As the winters become colder the Tanu are forced to travel south into warmer climates to hunt, onto Yilanè territory. It is not long before a state of conflict exists between the two species.

The central characters are Vaintè, an ambitious Yilanè; Stallan, her vicious and obedient adjutant; and Kerrick, a &quot;ustuzou&quot; (the Yilanè word for mammal) who is captured by the reptiloids as a boy, and raised as a Yilanè. Kerrick eventually escapes to rejoin his own people, ultimately becoming a leader. Another notable Yilanè character is Enge, the leader of a faction of pacifist Yilanè who reject the militaristic and violent attitudes of their culture. This group is violently opposed by most other Yilanè, especially Vaintè. Enge befriends Kerrick, and acts as his teacher, while he lives with the Yilanè.

After Kerrick escapes he joins other humanoid tribes and journeys over the mountains, being pursued all the while by Vaintè, who wants nothing more than the absolute destruction of the ustuzou. After a number of victories, Kerrick realizes that despite the losses inflicted upon the Yilanè, the Yilanè will never stop pursuing the humanoids. Kerrick organizes an expedition back to the Yilanè city of Alpèasak where he was held as a boy, and burns it down. The North American continent is freed of the Yilanè.

==Notes==
The story continues in two sequels, &quot;Winter in Eden&quot; (1986) and &quot;Return to Eden&quot; (1988).

The title can be seen as a reference to the Book of Genesis. Adam and Eve are driven east out of the Garden of Eden. Being &quot;west of Eden&quot;, then, is a reference to the counterhistorical premise of the novel.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;West of Eden&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #59, and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s the density of background detail which makes this, not a Great book, but the best Harrison for some while. Nice illustrations, too.&quot;

<text>The Division of Bass is an Australian electoral division in Tasmania.

It includes most of the city of Launceston and its surrounds. It has traditionally been a marginal seat and has had more members than any other federal electorate.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was one of the five established when the former Division of Tasmania was redistributed on 2 October 1903 and is named for the explorer George Bass. It has always been based on the city of Launceston and surrounding rural areas, and its boundaries have changed very little in the century since its creation. For most of its history it has been a marginal seat, changing hands between the Australian Labor Party and the conservative parties—since 1949 the Liberal Party. Its most notable member has been Lance Barnard, who was Deputy Prime Minister in the Whitlam government. His resignation in 1975 was followed by Labor&#x27;s heavy defeat in the Bass by-election, which is seen as the beginning of the end of the Whitlam government.

The Liberals won the seat at the 2019 election.

Bass has had the most different members of any federal electorate at seventeen.

Bass is currently the Coalition&#x27;s 5th most marginal electorate, held by a 1.43% margin on the two-party-preferred vote.

<doc id="1057295" wikidata="Q2576388" url="?curid=1057295" title="Corpus albicans">
<text>The corpus albicans (Latin for &quot;whitening body&quot;; also known as atretic corpus luteum, corpus candicans, or simply as albicans) is the regressed form of the corpus luteum. As the corpus luteum is being broken down by macrophages, fibroblasts lay down type I collagen, forming the corpus albicans. This process is called &quot;luteolysis&quot;. The remains of the corpus albicans may persist as a scar on the surface of the ovary.

== Background ==
During the first few hours after expulsion of the ovum from the follicle, the remaining granulosa and theca interna cells change rapidly into &quot;lutein cells&quot;. They enlarge in diameter two or more times and become filled with lipid inclusions that give them a yellowish appearance.

This process is called &quot;luteinization&quot;, and the total mass of cells together is called the &quot;corpus luteum&quot;. A well-developed vascular supply also grows into the corpus luteum.

The &quot;granulosa cells&quot; in the corpus luteum develop extensive intracellular smooth endoplasmic reticula that form large amounts of the female sex hormones &quot;progesterone&quot; and &quot;estrogen&quot; (more progesterone than estrogen during the luteal phase). The &quot;theca cells&quot; form mainly the androgens androstenedione and testosterone. These hormones may then be converted by aromatase in the granulosa cells into estrogens, including estradiol.

The corpus luteum normally grows to about 1.5 centimeters in diameter, reaching this stage of development 7 to 8 days after ovulation. Then it begins to involute and eventually loses its secretory function and its yellowish, lipid characteristic about 12 days after ovulation, becoming the corpus albicans. In the ensuing weeks, this is replaced by connective tissue and over months is reabsorbed.

<text>Pivdenne (, ), formerly known as Yuzhne ( in Russian) is a port city in Odesa Raion, Odesa Oblast (province) of south-western Ukraine. Pivdenne hosts the administration of Yuzhne urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. It is situated on the country&#x27;s Black Sea coast. Population: 

Initially created as a settlement of the Odesa Portside Plant in the Small Adzhalyk Estuary, since 1981 it was transformed into a suburb of Odesa within the Suvorovsky District of the city. From the Southern Marine Terminal of the city port, the Odesa–Brody pipeline takes its beginning towards the Western Ukraine.

Until 18 July 2020, Yuzhne was incorporated as a city of oblast significance. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Odesa Oblast to seven, the city of Yuzhne was merged into newly established Odesa Raion.

The city&#x27;s port Pivdennyi (formerly Yuzhnyi) is an internationally important oil terminal, and one of Ukraine&#x27;s top three ports, with Odesa and Chornomorsk. These three nearby port cities have grown into a single conurbation, and Pivdenne is considered a satellite of Odesa.

== Name ==

11 May 1978 by the order of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) of the Ukrainian SSR the newly built populated place was given the name of the village Yuzhne. Although it sounds awkward in Ukrainian, the city&#x27;s name is the Russian word for &quot;Southern&quot;. The Ukrainian term for &quot;Southern&quot; would be &quot;Pivdenne&quot;. The city is located about east of Odesa.
In February 1993 the Verkhovna Rada declared to give the urbanized village a special status in the Odesa Oblast as a city of oblast significance. In 2000 the declaration of Verkhovna Rada #1914-III confirmed the city limits.

In April 2023 the city council of Yuzhne decided to rename the city since the city name was not in accordance with the requirements of the law &quot;On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language&quot;. It was stated that the name of the city did not meet the spelling norms and standards of Ukrainian (the state language). On 20 March 2024, the Committee of the Verkhovna Rada on issues of organization of state power, local self-government, regional development and urban planning decided to propose the name Port-Anental.

On 9 October 2024, the Verkhovna Rada voted to rename Yuzhne to Pivdenne. Meanwhile, the proposed name Port-Annental did not get enough votes and was rejected.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Pivdenne has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;).

== Sport ==
Pivdenne is home to the team BC Khimik in the Ukrainian Basketball Superleague, league champions in the 2014/15 season. Pivdenne is also home to the &quot;BK Khimik&quot; women&#x27;s volleyball team, Ukrainian champions in 2010/11 and 2011/12. The handball team named HC Portovik plays in the highest men&#x27;s League.

<text>Rajpramukh was an administrative title in India which existed from India&#x27;s independence in 1947 until 1956. Rajpramukhs were the appointed governors of certain Indian provinces and states.

==Background==

The British Indian Empire, which included most of present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, was made up of two types of political units. British India consisted of fifteen provinces, all British possessions, ruled directly by the British in all respects, either through a governor or a chief commissioner, officials appointed by the viceroy. Existing alongside British India were a large number of princely states, ruled by local hereditary rulers, who acknowledged British suzerainty, including British control of their external affairs, but who retained local autonomy. At the time of the proclamation of Queen Victoria as Empress of India in 1875, more than 700 Indian princely states and territories enjoyed treaty relations with the British Crown. The exact relationship between the Government of India (controlled by the British) and these states varied enormously, ranging from treaties of alliance, defence, protection, or supervision to almost outright control. The British Crown assumed control of British India from the East India Company in 1857 and thereafter controlled the internal governance through a Secretary of State for India in London and a Viceroy in India.

The hundreds of princely states varied greatly in size, from Hyderabad, with a population of over ten million, to tiny states. Most of the rulers of the princely states worked closely with a British political agent who was responsible to the governor of a British province, but the four largest princely states, Hyderabad, Gwalior, Baroda, Mysore, and Jammu and Kashmir, had Residents directly under the authority of the viceroy. Two agencies, the Central India Agency and Rajputana Agency, were made up of numerous princely states, and their political agents were appointed by the Viceroy.

==After independence under the Dominion of India, 1947–1950==

On 20 February 1947, the British government announced its intention to transfer power in British India to Indian hands by June 1948. However by 16 May 1947, the Cabinet Mission Plan had failed to evolve a constitution for India acceptable to all contending parties. Subsequently, the British government announced on 3 June 1947 its intention to partition British India into two dominions. On 15 July 1947, the House of Commons passed the Indian Independence Act 1947, to divide British India into the dominions of India and Pakistan. The House of Lords followed suit the next day. The Bill received the Royal assent on 18 July 1947. From this day the suzerainty of the British Crown over the Indian princely states lapsed as per 7(b) of the India Independence Act 1947, and with it all treaties between the British Crown and the Indian states also had a legal quietus. The rulers of the Indian States became sovereign rulers from 18 July 1947, and in principle they were free to accede to either of the two dominions or to remain independent. As per the provisions of the Act, on 15 August 1947 two independent dominions of India and Pakistan were established. The leaders in the Indian Independence movement put strong pressure on the Indian princes to accede their states to the Dominion of India. By 15 August 1947, virtually all of the rulers had signed an Instrument of Accession with the Governor-General of India, giving power to the dominion government to make laws on the three subjects of foreign policy, communication and defence, and otherwise they remained sovereign rulers. These rulers also signed another agreement known as the &quot;Stand Still Agreement&quot;, to provide continuity to any existing agreements between British India and their States.

Three Indian states namely Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, and Junagadh, failed to accede to either of the dominions. Jammu together with parts of Kashmir was incorporated into India after the Maharaja Hari Singh was forced to seek Indian military intervention against the marauding Pakistani sponsored tribal lords (Afridis). In time, the two remaining states of Hyderabad and Junagadh were invaded and annexed by India.

In 1948 the Maharaja of Gwalior signed a covenant with the rulers of the adjoining princely states to form a new state known as Madhya Bharat. This new covenanting state was to be governed by a council of the rulers with a head known as Rajpramukh. This new state signed a fresh Instrument of Accession with the Indian dominion. Subsequently, many other Indian states merged with their neighbouring Indian states on the same lines to form the covenanting states known as Vindhya Pradesh, Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), Rajputana, etc.

==Rajpramukhs in the Republic of India, 1950–1956==

In the intervening period the Dominion Government of India had set up a Constitution Assembly to formulate a new Constitution for India. Simultaneously each of the independent Indian rulers and Rajpramukhs of covenanting states had set up Constituent Assemblies for their respective states and also sent their representatives to the Constituent Assembly of India so as to make uniform laws for their respective states. The thinking among Indian leaders at that time was that each princely state or covenanting state would remain independent as a Federal state along the lines suggested originally by the 1935 Act. But as the drafting of the constitution progressed and the idea of forming a republic took concrete shape, it was decided that all the princely states/covenanting states would merge with the Republic of India, and all the Maharajas would be provided with a Privy Purse and privileges as enjoyed by them on 15 August 1947 by constitutional guarantees. Hence Art. 294, Art 362, Art 366, Art 363 were incorporated. Besides it was also decided that the Maharaja of Gwalior, Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, the Nizam of Hyderabad, and the Rajpramukhs of the covenanting states would continue to be the constitutional heads of their respective states. By 26 October 1949, the constituent assembly had finalised a new constitution for India and all the acceding Indian princely states and the covenanting states merged with the new Republic of India. In accordance with constitutional provisions all the Maharajas entered into another agreement with the Governor-General of India to provide for the specific privy purse amount, the right to their personal properties (as distinct from state properties), and the right to succession in accordance with the practice in their territories. These agreements were entered into before 26 January 1950 so as to bring them within the ambit of Art. 363. On 26 January 1950, India became a republic. The new constitution created four types of administrative divisions in India: nine Part A states, the former British provinces, which were ruled by an appointed governor and state legislature; eight Part B states, former princely states or groups of covenanting states, which were governed by a Rajpramukh; ten Part C states, including both former princely states and provinces, which were governed by a chief commissioner; and a union territory ruled by a governor appointed by the President of India.

As per Art.366 of the Indian Constitution (as it existed in 1950):

Art 366(21): Rajpramukh means-&lt;br&gt;
(a) in relation to the State of Hyderabad, the person for the time being is recognised by the President as Nizam of Hyderabad.;&lt;br&gt;
(b) in relation to the State of Jammu and Kashmir or the State of Mysore, the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Maharaja of that State;&lt;br&gt; and
(c) in relation to any other State specified in Part B of the First Schedule, the person who for the time being is recognised by the President as the Rajpramukh of that State, and includes in relation to any of the said States any person for the time being recognised by the President as competent to exercise Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), and Rajasthan.

==Governing Rajpramukhs, 1948–1956==

* Hyderabad State had its last Nizam, HEH Mir Osman Ali Khan (b. 1886 -d. 1967) as Rajpramukh of the state from 26 January 1950 to 31 October 1956.
* Patiala and East Punjab States Union had Maharaja Yadavindra Singh (b. 1913 -d. 1974), the Maharaja of Patiala, as the Rajpramukh and had Maharaja Jagatjit Singh (b. 1872 -d. 1949), the Maharaja of Kapurthala, as the Uprajpramukh (Deputy Rajpramukh).
* Saurashtra had Krishna Kumarsinhji Bhavsinhji (b. 1912 -d. 1965), the former Maharaja of Bhavnagar State, and Digvijaysinhji Ranjitsinhji (b. 1895 -d. 1966), the former Maharaja of Nawanagar State, as acting and regular Rajpramukh respectively. Meanwhile, Maharana Maharaja Shri Raj Mayurdhwajsinhji Meghrajji III Ghanshyamsinghji Sahib, the former Maharaja of Dhrangadhra State, on the establishment of the United State of Kathiawar (Saurashtra) in 1948, was installed as Uprajpramukh (Deputy Rajpramukh) and he served as Acting Rajpramukh during the absence of the Rajpramukh.
*Mysore had the Maharaja of Mysore, Jayachamaraja Wodeyar Bahadur (b. 1919 -d. 1974) as Rajpramukh. He continued as governor from 1 November 1956 to 4 May 1964. He held office as Governor of Madras State (present-day Tamil Nadu) from 4 May 1964 to 26 June 1966.
*Travancore-Cochin state had the last Maharaja of Travancore, Bala Rama Varma II (b. 1912 -d. 1991) as Rajpramukh from 1 July 1949 – 31 October 1956.
*Madhya Bharat had the last Maharaja of Gwalior, Sir Jiwajirao Scindia (b. 1916 -d. 1961) as Rajpramukh from 28 May 1948 to 31 October 1956.
*Rajasthan had several Rajpramukhs, Sir Bhim Singh II (1909-1991), the Maharao of Kota, from 25 March 1948 to 18 April 1948 and Sir Bhopal Singh (b. 1884 -d. 1955), the Maharana of Udaipur, from 18 April 1948 – 1 April 1949, then continuing with the designation of Maha Rajpramukh from 1 April 1949 to 4 July 1955; and Man Singh II, Maharajah of Jaipur, from April 1949 to October 1956. The Maharana of Udaipur was appointed Rajpramukh and Kota Naresh was appointed Up-Rajpramukh of the Union of many former princely states of Rajasthan, and subsequently Maharana Bhupal Singh of Udaipur was appointed the Maha-Rajpramukh and the Kota Naresh was appointed the Up-Rajpramukh.
*Vindhya Pradesh had Rameshwar Prasad Singh, Maharaja of Singrauli as Rajpramukh but then he died, so Martand Singh the Maharaja of Rewa was appointed.

==After 1956==

On 1 November 1956, the States Reorganization Act took effect, which erased the distinction between parts A, B, and C states, and reorganised state boundaries along linguistic lines. Of the Part B states, Rajputana was merged with Ajmer-Merwara state to become Rajasthan; Hyderabad was partitioned among Mysore, Andhra Pradesh, and Bombay state; Saurashtra was merged into Bombay state; Travancore-Cochin was merged with Malabar district to form the new state of Kerala; Madhya Bharat and Vindhya Pradesh were merged into Madhya Pradesh; Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU) was merged into Punjab state, and Mysore state was enlarged with the addition of Coorg state and parts of Bombay, Madras and Hyderabad states.

By 1956, the system of voluntary unions of states was dismantled and the position of Rajpramukh abolished. New states were created along linguistic and ethnic lines, which tore apart the traditional ties that existed in the former princely states. As the princely rulers died one by one more time was being taken before their successors were recognised by the Government of India. When they were recognised it was usually after they were persuaded to accept lower privy purses or reductions in privileges. But many influential Maharajahs and Maharanis were not content with being mere nominal title holders enjoying privileges. They started contesting in elections either as independents or by joining political parties. Growing popularity and success of many of the former royalty in the hustings particularly Maharani Gayatri Devi of Jaipur and Rajmata of Gwalior, Vijaya Raje Scindia among others was not to the liking of Mrs. Indira Gandhi who had become prime Minister by 1966.

By the year 1969 Indian National Congress had split into Congress (Organisational) and Congress (Requisitionist). Congress (R) was headed by Mrs. Indira Gandhi and to score public support she coined slogans like Garibi Hatao (Stop Poverty) which included promise to abolish the royal order. She de-recognized all the Maharajahs by a presidential order in 1969. But this was struck down by the Supreme Court of India. Eventually, the government by the 26th Amendment of the Constitution of India was successful in abolishing the Princely order. This process was completed by the end of 1971. Though a challenge to this amendment was mounted in the Supreme Court, the court neither heard the matter immediately nor gave any relief to the rulers. The case was ultimately decided against the rulers by as late as in 1993, by which time it had become fait accompli.

They have since only enjoyed their traditional styles and titles on a social basis and seem to have adapted well. Former royals like Captain Amarinder Singh - Maharaja of Patiala, Maharani Vasundhara Raje Scindia of Dholpur even rose to post of Chief Ministers of Punjab and Rajasthan respectively till recently. Many others like Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar - Maharaja of Mysore and his heir Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, V. P. Singh, Digvijay Singh, Madhavrao Scindia and his son Jyotiraditya Scindia, Arjun Singh, and many others have been active politics and been prime minister, governors, ministers, MPs and MLAs at different times.

<text>Town privileges or borough rights were important features of European towns during most of the second millennium. The city law customary in Central Europe probably dates back to Italian models, which in turn were oriented towards the traditions of the self-administration of Roman cities.

Judicially, a borough (or burgh) was distinguished from the countryside by means of a charter from the ruling monarch that defined its privileges and laws. Common privileges involved trade (marketplace, the storing of goods, etc.) and the establishment of guilds. Some of these privileges were permanent and could imply that the town obtained the right to be called a borough, hence the term &quot;borough rights&quot; (; ). Some degree of self-government, representation by diet, and tax-relief could also be granted. Multiple tiers existed; for example, in Sweden, the basic royal charter establishing a borough enabled trade, but not foreign trade, which required a higher-tier charter granting staple right.

<text>Raymond Edward &quot;Gilbert&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan (born 1 December 1946) is an Irish singer-songwriter who achieved his most significant success during the early 1970s with hits including &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;, &quot;Clair&quot; and &quot;Get Down&quot;. His songs are often marked by his distinctive, percussive piano playing style and observational lyrics using word play.

Born in Waterford, Ireland, O&#x27;Sullivan settled in Swindon, England, as a child. In 1967, he began pursuing a career in music. Worldwide, he has charted 16 top 40 records including six No. 1 songs, the first of which was 1970&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Rhymed&quot;. Across his career, he has recorded 19 studio albums. The music magazine &quot;Record Mirror&quot; voted O&#x27;Sullivan the top UK male singer of 1972. He has received three Ivor Novello Awards, including &quot;Songwriter of the Year&quot; in 1973.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Sullivan was born on 1 December 1946 in Cork Road, Waterford, Ireland. He was one of six children. His mother May ran a sweet shop and his father was a butcher with Clover Meats. The O&#x27;Sullivans emigrated due to a job offer in England. The family first moved to Battersea, London when O&#x27;Sullivan was seven, before settling in Swindon, Wiltshire a year later. He began playing piano there, later explaining: &quot;I come from a working-class background, but we always had a piano, the thinking of my parents was that if one of your kids could play it, you could make some money at it.&quot; A period of going to piano lessons was short-lived, as O&#x27;Sullivan was not enamoured of music theory and played the pieces by ear instead. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s father died two years after the move to Swindon. O&#x27;Sullivan did not mourn his death, later stating, &quot;the fact of the matter is, I didn&#x27;t know my father very well, and he wasn&#x27;t a good father anyway.&quot;

O&#x27;Sullivan attended St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic College before studying at Swindon College, specialising in graphic design. There, he played with several semi-professional bands including the Doodles and the Prefects, and was most notably a drummer in a band called Rick&#x27;s Blues, along with Malcolm Mabbett (guitar), Keith Ray (bass) and founder Rick Davies. Davies, who later founded Supertramp, taught O&#x27;Sullivan how to play both drums and piano. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s drumming informed his style of piano-playing, which often utilises a distinct, percussive piano pattern. O&#x27;Sullivan has explained, &quot;My left hand is hitting the high hat and the right hand is the snare.&quot; He started writing songs, heavily influenced by the Beatles as writers and Bob Dylan as a performer.

==Career==

In 1967, O&#x27;Sullivan moved from Swindon to London in pursuit of a career in music. Determined to get a record deal and looking to stand out, he created an eye-catching visual image consisting of a bowl cut, cloth cap and short trousers. O&#x27;Sullivan has said his love of silent film inspired the look. He scored a five-year contract with April Music, CBS Records&#x27; house publishing company, after coming to the attention of the professional manager Stephen Shane, who also suggested changing his name from Ray to Gilbert as a play on the name of the light opera partnership Gilbert and Sullivan. He was paid an advance of £12 (equivalent to £ as of 2025), with which he bought a piano. He was signed to CBS Records by the A&amp;R manager Mike Smith, who produced the Tremeloes, the Marmalade and the Love Affair.

His first single was &quot;Disappear&quot;, produced by Mike Smith and released in November 1967 credited to the mononym &quot;Gilbert&quot;. It failed to chart, as did his second single &quot;What Can I Do&quot;, released in April 1968. A switch to the Irish record label Major Minor in 1969 yielded a third single &quot;Mr. Moody&#x27;s Garden&quot;, which was again unsuccessful. O&#x27;Sullivan then sent some demo tapes to Gordon Mills, the manager of Tom Jones and Engelbert Humperdinck, whereupon O&#x27;Sullivan was signed to Mills&#x27; newly founded label, MAM Records. Mills reportedly hated O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s self-created image, but O&#x27;Sullivan insisted on using it initially. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s unique signature look garnered much attention and often saw him compared to the Bisto Kids. O&#x27;Sullivan explained his thinking behind his appearance in a 1971 interview: &quot;My mother probably doesn&#x27;t like Neil Young because she hates the way he looks, his hair and everything. If you can get them interested in the way you look then they tend to like the music. The thing which I&#x27;m trying to create is of the thirties; Keaton and Chaplin.&quot;

===Early success===
At the end of 1970, O&#x27;Sullivan achieved his first UK top 10 hit with &quot;Nothing Rhymed&quot;, which also reached number one in the Netherlands,&lt;ref name=&quot;Top40/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; where it earned O&#x27;Sullivan his first gold disc. Over 1971, O&#x27;Sullivan scored hits with &quot;Underneath The Blanket Go&quot; (which also reached number one in the Netherlands), &quot;We Will&quot; and &quot;No Matter How I Try&quot;, the latter being named &quot;Best Ballad or Romantic Song&quot; at the 17th Ivor Novello Awards in 1972. O&#x27;Sullivan released his debut album, &quot;Himself&quot;, in August 1971. It received a warm critical reception, with O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s observational and conversational style of songwriting garnering comparisons to Paul McCartney and Randy Newman. O&#x27;Sullivan opted not to tour in promotion of the album, but did however make a number of appearances on British television during 1971, most notably recording an edition of &quot;BBC In Concert&quot; broadcast 18 December 1971.

In 1972 O&#x27;Sullivan achieved major international fame with &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;, a ballad which touches on suicide and loss. The single peaked at no. 3 in the UK but in America spent six non-consecutive weeks at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100, selling nearly two million copies. It peaked at no. 2 in New Zealand (during an 11-week chart run) and spent two weeks at number one in Canada (13 weeks in the Top 40); and reached number one in Japan (during a 21-week chart run). In America the single ranked no. 2 (behind Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;) in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s year-end chart, based on both sales and airplay. In 1973 both titles were Grammy-nominated for both Song of the Year and Record of the Year, with Flack winning in both categories. This international success coincided with a new image, with O&#x27;Sullivan discarding the appearance he had used since 1967. He unveiled a more modern &#x27;college-like&#x27; look in which he often wore a sweater bearing a large letter &#x27;G&#x27;. This was a deliberate attempt to prevent &quot;[making] an impact like Tiny Tim&quot; in the US that &quot;would have taken years to shake off,&quot; and the subsequent American edition of &quot;Himself&quot;, which included &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;, featured an updated image of O&#x27;Sullivan on the album artwork. O&#x27;Sullivan followed up on the success of &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot; with &quot;Clair&quot;, which reached no. 2 in the United States on the Hot 100 and no. 1 in the UK, Norway, France, Belgium, Ireland and Canada (14 weeks in the Canadian Top 40). Its parent album (and O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s second), &quot;Back to Front&quot;, spawned a further hit with &quot;Out of the Question&quot;, which reached no. 17 in the US and no. 14 in Canada.

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s disc sales exceeded ten million in 1972 and made him the top star of the year. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s success led to his taking part in the BBC&#x27;s anniversary programme &quot;Fifty Years of Music&quot; in November 1972. O&#x27;Sullivan was ranked by &quot;Record Mirror&quot; as the number one male singer of 1972, and in May 1973, he won an Ivor Novello award for &quot;British Songwriter of the Year.&quot;

1973 saw the release of O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s third album, &quot;I&#x27;m a Writer, Not a Fighter&quot;, which reflected a new emphasis on rock music and funk influences. Its lead single, the electric keyboard-based &quot;Get Down&quot;, reached number one in the UK, Belgium and Germany, no. 7 in both the US and Canada, and no. 3 in the Netherlands. Following &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot; and &quot;Clair&quot;, &quot;Get Down&quot; was O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s third million-seller, with the RIAA gold disc award presented on 18 September 1973.

O&#x27;Sullivan enjoyed nearly five years of success with MAM, a run that included seven UK top 10 singles and four UK top 10 albums; three US top 10 singles and one top 10 album; five Dutch top 10 singles and three top 10 albums; five New Zealand top 10 singles; three Canadian top 10 singles; and seven Japan top 10 singles. By 1974, his sales were decreasing. His fourth album &quot;A Stranger In My Own Back Yard&quot;, was his first to miss the top five on the UK Albums Chart, charting at no. 9. Its lead single, &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Place&quot;, generated controversy due to its lyric (&quot;I believe / A woman&#x27;s place is in the home&quot;), seen by some as sexist. It was O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first single since his 1970 breakthrough to miss the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, reaching a peak of no. 42. His November 1974 single &quot;Christmas Song&quot; reached no. 12 in the UK and no. 5 in Ireland. In June 1975, O&#x27;Sullivan had his last top 20 hit, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Love You But I Think I Like You&quot;.

O&#x27;Sullivan released a fifth album with MAM in 1977, &quot;Southpaw&quot;, but it failed to chart. O&#x27;Sullivan discovered his recording contract with MAM Records greatly favoured the label&#x27;s owner, Gordon Mills. A lawsuit followed, with a prolonged argument over how much money his songs had earned and how much of that money he had actually received. Eventually, in May 1982, the court found in O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s favour, describing him as a &quot;patently honest and decent man&quot;, who had not received a just proportion of the vast income his songs had generated. They awarded him £7 million in damages (£ as of 2025). Although he had won, the court battle put his recording career on hold, and he said he was unable to obtain management or a major record label deal.

===Later career===
In 1980, after a five-year hiatus, he returned to his old record label, CBS.

The first single, &quot;What&#x27;s in a Kiss?&quot;, reached No. 19 in the UK in 1980 and No. 21 in Japan. It was his first UK top 20 hit in five years. Following the release of his subsequent 1980 and 1982 albums, &quot;Off Centre&quot; and &quot;Life &amp; Rhymes&quot;, and due in part to the then-ongoing MAM court case, O&#x27;Sullivan released no new material between 1983 and 1986. Apart from the single &quot;So What?&quot; in 1990 and a compilation album in 1991, &quot;Nothing But the Best&quot;, O&#x27;Sullivan was absent from the charts until another compilation album, &quot;The Berry Vest of Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan&quot;, returned him to the UK top 20 in 2004.

O&#x27;Sullivan is also noted for his role in bringing about the practice of clearing samples in hip hop music as a result of the 1991 court case Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records, Inc., in which he sued rapper Biz Markie over the rights to use a sample of his song &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;. He won 100% of the royalties and made sampling an expensive undertaking.

O&#x27;Sullivan has continued to record and perform into the 21st century. He enjoys particular acclaim in Japan. His album &quot;A Scruff at Heart&quot; was released in 2007, featuring &quot;Just So You Know&quot;. On 14 July 2008, O&#x27;Sullivan released &quot;Never Say Di&quot;. He appeared at the 2008 Glastonbury Festival, to which he performed his well know hits &quot;Alone Again (Naturally), Clair, Ooh Wakka Doo Wakka Day, Nothing Rhymed, and Get Down&quot;, but his latter two performances overran. O&#x27;Sullivan, feeling embarrassed, wrote a &quot;long apologetic&quot; letter to Michael Eavis, yet received no response; O&#x27;Sullivan was never asked to return to the Glastonbury stage, which led to a brief period of sourness between him and his Agent. O&#x27;Sullivan played London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall on 26 October 2009. On 26 August 2010, O&#x27;Sullivan announced that he had joined Hypertension, a record company whose artists have included Leo Sayer, Chris DeBurgh, Fleetwood Mac and Gerry Rafferty.

His album &quot;Gilbertville&quot; was released on 31 January 2011; it featured &quot;All They Wanted to Say&quot;, which dealt with the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and his single &quot;Where Would We Be (Without Tea)?&quot;. On 19 July 2011, O&#x27;Sullivan played live on the BBC Radio 2 Ken Bruce Show. On 26 August that year, the documentary &quot;Out on His Own&quot; was broadcast by BBC 4 (before by Irish RTÉ). In March 2012, the compilation album &quot;Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan: The Very Best Of – A Singer &amp; His Songs&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 12. 2015 saw O&#x27;Sullivan re-emerge on Irish and BBC radio and television. He toured Ireland beginning of June and on 8 June 2015 his album &quot;Latin à la G!&quot; was released.

On 24 August 2018, O&#x27;Sullivan released his 19th studio album, &quot;Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan&quot;. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 20, his first UK charting studio album in over 40 years.

On 22 July 2022, O&#x27;Sullivan released his 20th studio album, &quot;Driven&quot;, produced by Andy Wright. The album peaked in the UK Albums Chart at No. 26.

In December 2023, councillors of Waterford City and County Council agreed to award O&#x27;Sullivan the Freedom of the City &amp; County. He received the honour in person on 27 March 2024.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Sullivan purposely avoided dating at the peak of his career; he feared that doing so would inhibit his songwriting abilities. In January 1980, O&#x27;Sullivan married his Norwegian girlfriend Aase Brekke. Later that year, the first of their two daughters, Helen-Marie, was born. Tara was born two years later.

He currently lives in Jersey.

<doc id="1057312" wikidata="Q6146073" url="?curid=1057312" title="James the Red Engine">
<text>James the Red Engine is a fictional anthropomorphic tender locomotive from &quot;The Railway Series&quot; children&#x27;s books by the Reverend Awdry and the TV series adaptation &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;. James is the number 5 engine on the North Western Railway, the Fat Controller&#x27;s railway on the Island of Sodor.

James debuted in the 1946 book &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. Two books in the series, &quot;James the Red Engine&quot; and &quot;James and the Diesel Engines&quot;, are dedicated to James.

==Prototype and background==

James first appeared in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; in the 1946 book &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. He was named after James Furze, a friend of the publisher&#x27;s son. He was originally painted black. At the request of the publishers, Awdry dedicated &quot;James the Red Engine&quot; to the character. James was painted red in this and subsequent books. 
James is based on the L&amp;YR Class 28, an mixed-traffic tender engine designed by George Hughes and based on the earlier L&amp;YR Class 27 designed by John Aspinall. According to Awdry, the Class 28s were powerful engines but had a tendency to be nose-heavy, especially when used as relief engines on excursion trains and driven at speed. In the book &quot;The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways&quot;, Awdry gave a fictional history of the engine. James was built by Hughes as an experiment to see if the nose-heaviness could be counteracted. The locomotive was fitted with larger driving wheels and a pony truck, making it into a . (The real Class 28 has wheels.) James is also missing the prominent front sandboxes fitted to the Class 28s. The improvement was not as great as hoped for and after the grouping, the LMS sold James to the Fat Controller&#x27;s North Western Railway.

===Models===
Awdry had two models of James on his OO gauge model railway. The first, from the 1950s, was based on a 2-6-0 Glasgow and South Western Railway locomotive, the Austrian Goods, designed by Peter Drummond; this is the design that Awdry had originally intended to use for James. The model was red with yellow lining. Despite being professionally made and &quot;a beautiful model&quot;, the motor was unreliable, so it could not be used regularly. Awdry later noted that it was sent away in the 1980s for a new motor and chassis and came back &quot;completely transformed&quot;.

Awdry&#x27;s second model of James was based on a 1960s Tri-ang Johnson 3F 0-6-0; a conversion which Hornby used for the production version of their model of James several decades later.

==James in &quot;The Railway Series&quot;==

&quot;James the Red Engine&quot; was the third book in the Railway Series by Reverend W. Awdry. It picked up where the previous book, &quot;Thomas The Tank Engine&quot;, left off, as James was introduced in &quot;Thomas &amp; The Breakdown Train&quot; where the Troublesome Trucks pushed him into a field after his wooden brake blocks caught fire. James was rescued by Thomas and the Breakdown Train and was repainted red.

===James and the Top Hat===
The Fat Controller has given James a new coat of red paint, to cheer him up after the accident on his first day, and becomes rather conceited. He lets off steam and accidentally sprays water on the Fat Controller&#x27;s new top hat. He hurries Edward and the coaches away in panic and initially pulls too far from their first stop station platform. After meeting Thomas again, he focuses enough to move their train over Gordon&#x27;s Hill, and he and Edward laugh about its comical name origin, which unfortunately leads to James&#x27; laughter becoming hiccups, frightening an elderly passenger. After an eventful day, James is content with his success, yet worried about the Fat Controller&#x27;s response.

===James and the Bootlace===
The next day, the Fat Controller, still cross over his hat&#x27;s dampening, threatens to repaint James blue if he continues to cause trouble. An upset James is impatient and rough with the coaches, to where their resistance brings a leak in the brake pipe, which his driver, fireman, and conductor mend with newspaper and a passenger&#x27;s bootlace, after coercing the only passenger with a bootlace to reluctantly hand it over. Once the hole has been mended, James miserably resolves not to bump coaches as he awaits the outcome.

===Troublesome Trucks===
After the incident with the coaches, James has been confined to the shed for several days. The Fat Controller lets James out and assigns him a goods train. The trucks try to make him give up when they come to Gordon&#x27;s Hill, but James keeps on. Eventually, a rusty coupling snaps, and some trucks roll downhill. The conductor stops them and Edward the Blue Engine offers to help, but James prefers to go it alone instead. The trucks seem to realize James will keep trying whatever they do, and finally allow James to reach the top of the hill. After hearing about what happened, the Fat Controller deems James worthy of his red coat.

===James and the Express===
Gordon the Big Engine boasts to James that he is the only engine who is able to pull the Express. James is resting in the shed the next day when Gordon arrives feeling mournful (he has accidentally been switched to the loop line and had a long, wasted journey). James teases him about it, but a horde of angry passengers arrives and demands refunds. Instead, James pulls the Express and does so well that the Fat Controller allows him to take the Express when Gordon needs a rest. James and Gordon are now the best of friends. Gordon never mentions bootlaces, and the two engines bond over their dislike of trucks.

==James in &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;==
Unlike the books, the TV episode &quot;Thomas and the Breakdown Train&quot; had a red-coloured James from the beginning. For unknown reasons, James also appeared in all episodes before &quot;Thomas and the Breakdown Train&quot; even though this story established him as being a new engine.

Like in the books, James is very proud of his red paintwork and does not like getting dirty, which often gets him into trouble.

James is one of only four characters that appears in every &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; film, but only has major roles in four of them.

He is one of the leads of the 2013 film &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: King of the Railway&quot;, in which he, Thomas, and Percy assist in the restoration of Ulfstead Castle and the construction of the Earl of Sodor’s estate.

James is the main antagonist of the 2014 film &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: Tale of the Brave&quot;. He pulls a prank on Percy which leads the latter to think there is a monster on the island. They make amends after Percy saves James from a rockslide.

&quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: The Adventure Begins&quot; retells the first seven episodes of the show, with some alterations; most notably, James appears in his original black livery from the second book. In this version, James arrived on Sodor before Thomas and is the engine Annie and Clarabel originally belonged to. Thomas chases after the runaway James but fails to stop him and James crashes into a field. Thomas then gets the breakdown train, has James put back on the tracks, and takes him to the Steamworks. James comes back some time later, now painted in his familiar red, but finds that his two coaches have been assigned to Thomas&#x27;s newly acquired branch line.

In the 2017 film &quot;Journey Beyond Sodor&quot; Henry is prevented from taking a freight train to the mainland, so James is assigned to take his place. James has been teasing Thomas for being stuck on his branch line, so Thomas takes the train to spite him. James volunteers to go find the missing Thomas in the hope of being praised as a hero. After some investigation, he uncovers and is imprisoned in a large steelworks that Thomas had escaped from earlier and is forced to work there. He is eventually rescued by Thomas and a group of misfit experimental engines.

===James in &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;===
In the 2000 film, &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, James was threatened by Diesel 10 and almost got pushed back into a smelting pit before being teleported out by Mr. Conductor Jr. (portrayed by Michael E. Rodgers). In the beginning, the fly annoying James was a reference to the original Awdry story &quot;Buzz, Buzz&quot;.

Susan Roman voiced James in the film. Michael Angelis provided James&#x27;s voice in the workprint, along with Percy.

===James in &quot;All Engines Go&quot;===

In the 2021 reboot, James was brought back as a supporting character, rather than as part of the main cast as with the original series. Much like many of the other characters in the reboot, many of James&#x27; design elements and personality were altered to a more engaging dynamic towards the young engines. He does exhibit carelessness with his often-dropped cargo.

==Legacy==
===Awards===
A large-scale working replica of James, along with Thomas, Percy, Gordon, Harold and Jack, was created by BBC Visual Effects for &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: The All Aboard Live Tour&quot;. This battery-powered locomotive is listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the &quot;largest model railway engine&quot; ever built, at 2.64 x 1.5 x 6.52 metres.

===Real-life replicas===

The Mid-Hants Railway repainted one of its engines – a Southern Railway N Class – into the livery of James. The engine retained this colour scheme for many years and participated in &quot;The Railway Series&quot; golden jubilee celebrations at the National Railway Museum. This engine was the only replica Thomas character to be certified to run on the mainline. On the East Lancashire Railway, unrestored LMS Ivatt Class 2 Mogul No. 46428 has been painted as James the Red Engine.

The Japanese Ōigawa Railway&#x27;s locomotives include five characters from the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; series: Thomas the Tank Engine, Hiro, Percy, James, and Rusty. The locomotives are based at Shin-Kanaya Station.

<text>The Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works, located in Paterson, New Jersey, manufactured steam railroad locomotives from 1852 until it was merged with seven other manufacturers to form American Locomotive Company (ALCO) in 1901.

==History==
The firm was established in 1852 by former Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works superintendent (and son-in-law of William Swinburne of Swinburne, Smith and Company) John Cooke and former Montreal resident Charles Danforth as the Danforth, Cooke, and Company, as a manufacturer of steam locomotives as well as cotton machinery. The company was renamed Danforth Locomotive and Machine Company in 1865, with Danforth serving as president until 1871, four years before his death in 1875. Cooke succeeded Danforth as president in 1871, continuing in such capacity until his own death in 1882, after which Cooke&#x27;s sons, John, Frederick, and Charles reorganized the firm as the Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works, and continued operating the company as such until the merger in 1901.
In 1901, Cooke and several other locomotive manufacturers merged to form the American Locomotive Company; Cooke&#x27;s plant becomes the Alco-Cooke Works, and locomotive production continued at the plant until 1926. Approximately 2600 locomotives were built by Cooke from 1852 to 1901, among the most notable engines produced by the firm are the C. P. Huntington, and the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad &quot;Texas&quot;.

==Exports==
In addition to providing motive power for North American railroads, Cooke has also produced many locomotives for Central and South America as well as other parts of the world. Examples of exported locomotives include two 0-8-2 tank locomotives for the Port Talbot Railway and Docks Company, South Wales, in 1899, as well as Barry Railway&#x27;s five class K 0-6-2T locomotives the same year. The firm also produced 2-6-2T locomotives for the War Department Light Railways to be used in France during World War I, preserved examples of which can be found on the Froissy Dompierre Light Railway and Ffestiniog Railway.

==Preserved Cooke locomotives==
The following is a list of preserved locomotives built by Cooke before the ALCO merger in 1901. They are listed here in serial number order.

In addition to the above locomotives, the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad WP&amp;YR owns and maintains a steam-powered snowplow built by Cooke in 1899. This unit is on static display in Skagway, Alaska (see Rotary snowplow for a photo).

The following is a list of preserved locomotives built at the Cooke factory after the ALCO merger.

<text>Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic (; German: Bohuslaus Lobkowitz von Hassenstein) (1461 – 11 November 1510) was a nobleman, writer and humanist of the old Bohemian family (later the princes) of the House of Lobkowicz. Regardless of his Bohemian roots, he explicitly referred to himself as German.

He was born at Hasištejn Castle, near Kadaň, Bohemia. He studied in Bologna and Ferrara (doctor of law, 1482) and converted from Utraquism to Catholicism there. After 1483, he became provost of Vyšehrad in Prague and between 1490–91 he travelled to the Holy Land and Egypt, earning the nickname &quot;the Czech Ulysses&quot;. He was elected the bishop of Olomouc, but he was refused by the Pope. After this, he lived with a few of his writer friends in his &#x27;Tusculum&#x27;, Hasištejn Castle in north-eastern Bohemia.

Lobkovic was an author of philosophical prose, letters, and verses, including satire on Bohemian national life: &quot;Ad sanctum Venceslaum satira&quot; (1489). He was a successful essayist and poet and became &quot;poeta laureatus&quot;. Lobkovic wrote in German and Latin, but never in Czech, which was &quot;barbaric&quot; in his eyes. Moreover, he clearly considered himself a German (&quot;Ego me Germanum esse et profiteor et glorior&quot; ― &quot;I openly confess to be a German and am proud of it&quot;).

His close friends were Jan Šlechta z Všehrd, a philosopher, Viktorin Kornel ze Všehrd and Racek Doubravský z Doubravy, both of whom were theorists of Bohemian common law. He was the younger brother of Jan Hasištejnský z Lobkovic.

He died in Hasištejn Castle in 1510.

<doc id="1057368" wikidata="Q591927" url="?curid=1057368" title="Blidworth">
<text>Blidworth is a village and civil parish approximately five miles east of Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 4,457, this dropped to 4,295 in the 2021 census. Its history can be traced back to the 10th century. The area around Main Street, west of Beck Lane and including the church, is the older portion of Blidworth, containing historic buildings. 
Many of the current houses were built in the first half of the 20th century to provide housing for workers at Blidworth Colliery (1926–1989). These are mainly in estates north of Dale Lane. Outside of Blidworth village but within the parish, Blidworth Bottoms is a hamlet about 0.5 km south of Blidworth. Haywood Oaks is the portion of the village south of Dale Lane and the south eastern rural area of the parish surrounding Haywood Oaks Lane.

==Toponymy==
Blidworth seems to contain the Old English personal name, &quot;Blitha&quot;&#x27; + &quot;worð &quot; (Old English) an enclosure, so &#x27;Blitha&#x27;s enclosure&#x27;.

==History and geography==
The first recorded reference of Blidworth was in the Domesday Book, a national survey which was executed for William I of England in 1086. It is recorded as Blideworde, its recorded population was five households and the total tax assessed was 1.1 Geld Units. Although this is the first recorded reference of Blidworth, the village is much older and was possibly used by the Romans.

Up to the end of the 19th century it was a farming community with 150 houses clustered around Main Street and 26 farms and three mills, with a population of about 2000. A major change came with the construction of a colliery north of Belle Vue Road in 1921 with the resulting construction of housing for workers. Thus the major part of the population is in an area in the east of Blidworth, between Belle Vue Lane in the north and Dale Lane in the south. Mansfield Road forms the west of this and is the main shopping area. The mine closed in 1989. There is now an industrial estate on Burma Road, north of Belle Vue Lane, as well as a Leisure Centre and the Miners Social Welfare Centre.

Other 20th century industries included factories for the manufacture of shoes, hosiery, textiles and metal products. Much of these industrial areas have been redeveloped and new housing has been constructed around the periphery of the village, with new street names, such as Will Scarlet Close.
==Places of worship==
There are four places of worship, the C of E parish Church of St Mary of the Purification, Blidworth Methodist Church, Sherwood Forest Community Church and the St Andrew&#x27;s Mission Hall. 
==Robin Hood links==

According to legend, Will Scarlet is buried in the churchyard of the Church of St. Mary of the Purification. An unmarked grave stands near the iron gates of the churchyard, formed from the original apex of the church tower and other assorted stones, and is generally attributed to the outlaw. As outlaws were not generally buried in churchyards, though, it is more likely that, if he existed, Will Scarlet was buried in one of the much older graves to be found on the same hillside within the boundaries of Sherwood Forest.

Other local legends suggest that Blidworth was the birthplace of Maid Marian, although there is little or no evidence to support these claims.

==Blidworth Mill==
This Subscription Mill was built c. 1816 as a three-storey brick tower windmill. With 3 pairs of millstones, it was working in 1892 but was dismantled some time during the First World War.
It had 4 double patent sails, an ogee cap and an 8-bladed fantail. Millers listed as working the mill include Foster (1842), Edmund Clark (1864 and Thomas Penford (1904). The tower still stands to a height of 26 feet north of the older part of Blidworth ().

One of the post windmills from Nottingham was moved to Blidworth in the 1850s, and was later moved to Hemsworth. A post windmill at Windmill Close, between Mount Pleasant and Belle Vue Lane was recorded in 1842; the owner was John Need and the tenant miller Thomas Blatherwick. A post windmill in Mill Croft, behind the Wesleyan chapel, was worked by miller William Holloway in 1864. It was demolished c. 1878.

==Druid Stone==

On the outskirts of the village of Blidworth, on farmlands, lies a stone known locally as the Druid Stone (Grid Reference: SK5787-558), a pillar of cemented glacial gravel standing on a base of the Nottingham Castle rock formation (Bunter Pebble Beds). This monumental object is 14 ft high, 84 ft around the base and has a hollow centre large enough for a man to pass through. Though known as the Druid Stone, there is no evidence to suggest that it has ever been used by druids. It is a naturally forming outcrop.

Blidworth Welfare were formed in 1926. They have played in the Central Midlands Football League and the Northern Counties East Football League. 
In 1982, they changed their name from Folk House Old Boys F.C. to their present name.

== Blidworth Welfare Band ==
Blidworth Welfare Band is a brass band with mining heritage, starting in the late 19th century as the Stanton Hill Temperance Band based in Sutton in Ashfield; the band later changed their name to the Stanton Hill Silver Band until the coal industry showed an interest in brass banding in general. An alliance with Teversal, Silver Hill and Sutton Collieries saw a name change for the band, and it became the Teversal Collieries Band until the demise of those mines in the late 1970s, which forced the band to relocate to Blidworth in 1980 and a change of name to the Blidworth Welfare Band.

The band has established itself over the years as a contesting band and competes in the Championship Section.

<text>Ahn Jung-hwan (, or ; born 27 January 1976) is a South Korean television personality and former professional footballer. A versatile forward known for his technical skills and clutch goalscoring, Ahn represented South Korea at three FIFA World Cups, notably scoring a golden goal against Italy in 2002. Following his retirement, Ahn transitioned into a successful career in broadcasting, becoming a popular football commentator and television host. He is also recognised for his philanthropic endeavors.

== Early life ==
Ahn Jung-hwan was raised in poverty by his grandmother after his father passed away, leaving his mother unable to care for him. Despite his grandmother&#x27;s initial concerns, Ahn joined his elementary school&#x27;s football team, drawn to the bread and milk they provided. He quickly discovered his talent for the sport and began to excel.

== University career ==
Ahn&#x27;s exceptional skills in high school attracted numerous offers from universities, including prestigious institutions like Yonsei University and Korea University. However, Ahn ultimately chose Ajou University due to their enticing offer, which included a substantial signing bonus and a guaranteed draft pick by the professional team Busan Daewoo Royals (later Busan IPark) upon graduation. Additionally, Ajou University agreed to Ahn&#x27;s condition of accepting his entire high school team, solidifying his decision.

Ahn&#x27;s presence at Ajou University ushered in a golden era for the team. A legendary moment occurred during the 1997 Autumn University Football League final against Hongik University. Ahn, returning from Italy after participating in the Summer Universiade, arrived directly from the airport at the match during the second half with Ajou University trailing 2-1. Despite his exhaustion from the long flight, Ahn scored two goals and provided an assist, leading Ajou University to a dramatic victory. His consistently outstanding performance throughout his university years, including his contribution to Ajou University&#x27;s championship victory, led to his signing with the Busan Daewoo Royals, where he quickly rose to prominence, becoming one of the K League Best XI in his debut year and winning the Most Valuable Player award in 1999.

== Club career ==
=== Busan Daewoo Royals ===
In 1998, Ahn started his professional career at K League club Busan Daewoo Royals. He was selected as one of the K League Best XI that year after showing great performance as soon as he went there. The next year, in 1999, he was named the K League Most Valuable Player by leading his team to finish as runners-up in the K League.

==== Loan to Perugia ====
In 2000, Ahn joined Perugia on loan, becoming the first South Korean footballer to play in Italy&#x27;s Serie A. Despite facing challenges integrating into the team due to racist remarks from teammate Marco Materazzi and limited playing time, Ahn made 30 appearances including 13 starts and scored five goals over two seasons.

His time at Perugia was marked by his performance at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he scored a crucial golden goal against Italy, leading to their elimination. The following day, Perugia&#x27;s owner Luciano Gaucci controversially terminated Ahn&#x27;s contract, citing his goal as the reason and making xenophobic remarks about Ahn and the Korean nation. This decision was widely condemned as discriminatory and sparked a global outcry.

Gaucci later retracted his decision and approved an option to sign Ahn on a permanent basis, but Ahn had a legal dispute with the club after refusing it. After FIFA intervened, Ahn was required to pay Perugia a compensation fee, which he did with the help of a Japanese entertainment company. This incident led to Ahn spending the next three years playing in the J1 League instead of big leagues in Europe.

=== Shimizu S-Pulse ===
In 2002, following a legal dispute with Perugia, Ahn joined Shimizu S-Pulse in the J1 League. Despite the circumstances surrounding his transfer, he quickly adapted to Japanese football, scoring 7 goals in 16 appearances during his first season, including matches in the J.League Cup, Emperor&#x27;s Cup, and AFC Champions League qualifiers. He continued to maintain his form in the 2003 season, becoming the club&#x27;s top scorer with 11 goals in 28 league appearances.

=== Yokohama F. Marinos ===
In 2004, Ahn transferred to Yokohama F. Marinos, the reigning J1 League champions. He quickly established himself as a key player, leading Yokohama to win the first stage. Although his performance was not continued in the second half of the season due to a mid-season injury, he became the team&#x27;s top scorer with 12 goals in 25 league appearances. Yokohama secured back-to-back league titles by defeating second stage champions Urawa Red Diamonds in the championship play-offs after his contribution.

In 2005, Ahn continuously showed his impressive form, scoring four goals in nine appearances before receiving an offer from Ligue 1 club Metz.

=== Metz ===
In July 2005, Ahn signed a one-year contract with Metz in the Ligue 1. Another J1 League club Nagoya Grampus offered about four times more salary than Metz, but he chose to return to Europe. However, he underperformed at Metz, scoring only 2 goals in 16 league matches. Metz struggled throughout the season, eventually facing relegation even after Ahn left the club in winter.

=== MSV Duisburg ===

In January 2006, Blackburn Rovers invited Ahn to a tryout for them, but Ahn refused their offer in order to request a definite deal. In February, he secured a 17-month deal with Bundesliga club MSV Duisburg. He aimed to acclimate to the environment of Germany, the host country of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, ahead of the tournament. He scored two goals in 12 outings, and Duisburg was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. He was interested in a move to Heart of Midlothian of the Scottish Premier League after the end of the season, but it fell through. Released by Duisburg in August, he returned to South Korea.

=== Suwon Samsung Bluewings ===
In January 2007, Ahn joined K League club Suwon Samsung Bluewings on a one-year deal. He initially showed promise, scoring a hat-trick in a League Cup match against Daejeon Citizen. However, his performance declined, and he was left out of the national team for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.
While playing for the reserve team in a R League match to regain his ability, Ahn tried to get into the stand after being verbally abused by FC Seoul fans. Although he was not protected from their impolite insults, he was ejected from the match and had to pay a fine.

Ahn&#x27;s stint at Suwon was ultimately underwhelming, scoring 5 goals without a league goal in 25 appearances. He left the club at the end of the season.

=== Return to Busan ===
In 2008, Ahn returned to his former club, now known as Busan IPark. His performance at Busan was statistically not outstanding, but set an example for his teammates. Busan offered him a contract extension including the best treatment in the team after the season, but he looked forward to playing in one of foreign leagues, especially the Major League Soccer.

=== Dalian Shide ===
On 20 March 2009, Ahn joined Chinese Super League side Dalian Shide on a seven-month contract until the end of the 2009 season. Quickly attracted to Ahn&#x27;s performance, Dalian executives extended his contract for another year in less than three months. Despite his old age, he played a key role in Dalian&#x27;s attack, becoming the team&#x27;s top scorer in 2009 and 2010. Especially, Dalian reached fourth place in the league standing with three matches left of the 2010 season, approaching an AFC Champions League berth under his influence. However, a knee injury sidelined him for the last matches, and his team finished sixth after failing to earn any victories during his absence.

Ahn re-signed with Dalian for the 2011 season, but his prime was finished that year. On 29 October 2011, he wore the captain&#x27;s armband in his last match at Dalian, and bade farewell to Dalian fans at half-time of the match. He announced his retirement as a player in January 2012.

== International career ==
=== Early career ===
In 1994, Ahn was selected for the South Korean under-20 team for the AFC Youth Championship. About three years later, on 23 April 1997, he made his senior international debut in a 2–0 friendly win over China. He also played for the South Korean Universiade team in the 1997 Summer Universiade in August, winning a silver medal.

=== 2002 World Cup ===
Ahn took charge of South Korea&#x27;s striker position with Hwang Sun-hong in rotation at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Despite initial doubts from national team manager Guus Hiddink, Ahn gained the manager&#x27;s trust in pre-tournament friendlies. Especially in a 4–1 win over Scotland, he destroyed the opponents by having two goals and an assist.

In the second group stage match against the United States, Ahn scored an equaliser which saved his team from defeat. In the Round of 16 match against Italy, he missed an early penalty, but later scored a dramatic golden goal in extra time, securing South Korea&#x27;s historic advancement to the quarter-finals. This goal is considered one of the most iconic moments in World Cup and South Korean football. In the third place match against Turkey, his shot hit the opponents&#x27; net, but was not recognised as a goal by an offside call. He was shortlisted for the All-Star Team by his contribution to South Korea&#x27;s top-four finish.

&quot;Ahn is the same type of striker as Romário or Raúl. They can completely omit a certain phase of the game. On the bench, you will rotate every other player, but toward this type of player, you will sometimes feel he can just turn the game upside down.&quot; – Guus Hiddink, in an interview with football magazine &quot;De VoetbalTrainer&quot;

=== 2004 Asian Cup ===
Ahn scored a goal in a 3–1 victory over Hong Kong, while helping South Korea win the inaugural EAFF Championship in 2003. His reputation in South Korea at the time was transcendental. He was undergoing basic military training instead of mandatory military service, from which he was specially exempt by an outcome at the 2002 World Cup, but exceptionally got a vacation in the middle of the training to play a friendly against Argentina.

On the other hand, Ahn had less opportunity to play at the AFC Asian Cup. He was not called up for the 2000 and 2007 tournaments due to his slumps at clubs. At the 2004 tournament, his first and last Asian Cup, he played as a substitute in three subsequent matches after showing a lethargic harmony with Jo Bonfrère&#x27;s first-choice striker Lee Dong-gook in the first match. Despite his limited playing time, he scored against the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.

=== 2006 World Cup ===
Ahn played as a substitute for South Korea in three group stage matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In the opening match against Togo, he was named the official Man of the Match by scoring the winning goal, which brought South Korea&#x27;s precious victory. He also became Asia&#x27;s all-time leading goalscorer in World Cup history with three goals. Despite his contribution, South Korea failed to progress beyond the group stage, finishing third in their group.

=== Retirement ===
Ahn was no longer South Korea&#x27;s key player after the 2006 World Cup, but was selected for the national team for the 2010 FIFA World Cup due to his experiences as a veteran. 
However, he did not play in any matches at the 2010 World Cup until South Korea was eliminated by Uruguay in the Round of 16. In an interview after 10 years, then manager Huh Jung-moo revealed he really wanted to use Ahn in the middle of the match against Uruguay, but finally chose Lee Dong-gook as a substitute after judging that Ahn&#x27;s physical condition was not recovered.

Ahn announced his retirement as a player on 31 January 2012. He had a retirement ceremony at half-time in a World Cup qualifier against Kuwait on 29 February.

== Style of play ==
Ahn&#x27;s technical gifts for passing, dribbling and shooting based on two-footed ability could deploy him in any attacking position, and led him to be called the &quot;fantasista&quot; in South Korea. He looked comfortable when playing as an attacking midfielder, but also could play as a winger or striker. However, he had some drawbacks such as lack of physical strength and defensive contribution.

&quot;Ahn was a rare type of player in our country. His skills were impossible for me, and were not behind European players. He showed Korean players also can play technical football.&quot; – Park Ji-sung

== After retirement ==
After retiring from professional football, Ahn has usually worked as a television personality. He is considered one of the most successful athletes-turned-comedians in South Korea, alongside Kang Ho-dong and Seo Jang-hoon. His unaffected and sharp talking has attracted a lot of viewers. He also hosted some television shows including &quot;Please Take Care of My Refrigerator&quot;.

Ahn has worked as a football commentator, and has provided live commentaries of South Korea&#x27;s football matches broadcast by Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation since 2014.

In 2012, Ahn was appointed an honorary ambassador for the K League. He toured all 16 stadiums of K League clubs and invited his teammates at the 2002 World Cup to the K League All-Star Game. He was acclaimed for his enthusiastic publicity campaign.

Ahn was one of the carriers of the Olympic flame at the opening of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

Ahn, who steadily volunteered his services and donations since becoming footballer, was appointed an honorary ambassador for Save the Children in 2019. Until 2023, he donated ₩300 million, the profits from his YouTube channel, to Save the Children and participated in various charity activities.

In 2021, Ahn co-founded entertainment company &quot;Moongchin Project&quot;.

In October 2024, he participated in the Nexon Icon Match in Korea as a striker team.

==Personal life==
Ahn, who married former Miss Korea Lee Hye-won in 2001, has one daughter and one son. He was nicknamed &quot;The Lord of the Ring&quot; after kissing his wedding ring whenever he celebrated his goal, and his celebration became fashionable among South Koreans at the time.

Ahn is widely regarded as one of the most handsome footballers in South Korea. Before his retirement, his face was frequently compared with South Korean actors and appeared in various television advertisements.

<text>The Korea National League was a South Korean semi-professional football league held annually from 2003 to 2019. It was considered the second-highest division of the South Korean football league system before the K League 2 was launched in 2013, and the third-highest division since then.

==History==
The Korea National League was officially founded in the name of &quot;K2 League&quot; in 2003 to execute a plan to professionalize the Korean National Semi-Professional Football League. The participating clubs of the National League had to have their hometowns unlike in the Semi-professional League era.

In 2006, the K2 League was re-branded as the Korea National League, and its champions were decided to promote to the K League. However, Goyang KB Kookmin Bank and Hyundai Mipo Dockyard, the champions of the 2006 and 2007 season respectively, judged that they couldn&#x27;t derive benefit from their professionalization, and rejected their promotion. The Korea Football Association and the K League Federation eventually prepared another project to found the second-tier professional league which is irrelevant to the National League.

At the end of 2019, the Korea National League was absorbed into the K3 League.

<doc id="1057389" wikidata="Q296287" url="?curid=1057389" title="Ben Gazzara">
<text>Biagio Anthony &quot;Ben&quot; Gazzara (August 28, 1930 – February 3, 2012) was an American actor and director of film, stage, and television. He received numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and a Drama Desk Award, in addition to nominations for three Golden Globe Awards and three Tony Awards.

Born to Italian immigrants in New York City, Gazzara studied at The New School and began his professional career with the Actors Studio, of which he was a lifelong member. His breakthrough role was in the Broadway play &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1955–56), which earned him widespread acclaim. A memorable performance as a soldier on trial for murder in Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959) transitioned Gazzara to an equally successful screen career. As the star of the television series &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (1965–1968), he was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards and two Emmy Awards. He won his only Emmy Award for the television film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (2002).

Gazzara was a recurring collaborator of John Cassavetes, working with him on &quot;Husbands&quot; (1970), &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; (1976) and &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977). His other best-known films include &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; (1969), &quot;Capone&quot; (1975), &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976), &quot;Saint Jack&quot; (1979), &quot;Road House&quot; (1989), &quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot; (1997), &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;, &quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;, &quot;Happiness&quot; (all 1998), &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (both 1999), &quot;Dogville&quot; (2003) and &quot;Paris, je t&#x27;aime&quot; (2006). He also had a successful and prolific film career in Europe, particularly Italy, where he worked with eminent directors such as Giuseppe Tornatore, Giuliano Montaldo, Marco Ferreri, and Lars von Trier.

Gazzara was known for his gritty, naturalistic portrayals of intense, often amoral characters. According to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;Gazzara positioned himself for &#x27;creative elbow room,&#x27; seeking edgy characters in non-mainstream productions or infusing mainstream productions with idiosyncratic supporting turns.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Gazzara was born in New York City, the son of Sicilian immigrants Angelina () and Antonio Gazzara, a laborer and carpenter; both parents were from the province of Agrigento—his mother from Castrofilippo and his father from Canicattì. He was raised in a monolingual, Sicilian-speaking household, and did not learn English until he went to school. 

Gazzara grew up in New York&#x27;s Kips Bay neighborhood; he lived on East 29th Street. He participated in the drama program at Madison Square Boys &amp; Girls Club located across the street. He attended New York City&#x27;s Stuyvesant High School, but finally graduated from Saint Simon Stock in the Bronx. Years later, he said that the discovery of his love for acting saved him from a life of crime during his teen years.

He went to City College of New York to study electrical engineering. After two years, he abandoned the subject and took classes in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School in New York with the influential German director Erwin Piscator and afterward joined the Actors Studio.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Gazzara guest-starred in shows like &quot;Treasury Men in Action&quot; and &quot;Danger&quot;.

He received acclaim for his off-Broadway performance in &quot;End as a Man&quot; in 1953. The production was transferred to Broadway and ran until 1954.

In 1954, Gazzara (having modified his original surname from &quot;Gazzarra&quot;) made several appearances in NBC&#x27;s legal drama &quot;Justice&quot;, based on case studies from the Legal Aid Society of New York. He also guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Medallion Theatre&quot; and &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot;.

=== Broadway success ===

Gazzara became a Broadway sensation when he portrayed the role of Brick in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; (1955–56) opposite Barbara Bel Geddes, directed by Elia Kazan. Gazzara turned down the role in the film version. The studio planned to offer the role to James Dean, but the part was given to Paul Newman after Dean&#x27;s death.

He followed it with another long run in &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot; (1956).

Gazzara was in the 1963 Actors Studio production of &quot;Strange Interlude&quot; on Broadway.

=== Film work ===
He joined other Actors Studio members in the 1957 film &quot;The Strange One&quot; produced by Sam Spiegel.

He had a Broadway flop with &quot;The Night Circus&quot; (1958) and continued to guest-star on shows like &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; and &quot;DuPont Show of the Month&quot;.

His second film was a high-profile performance as a soldier on trial for avenging his wife&#x27;s rape in Otto Preminger&#x27;s courtroom drama &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959).

Gazzara told Charlie Rose in 1998 that he went from being mainly a stage actor who often would turn up his nose at film roles in the mid-1950s to, much later, a ubiquitous character actor who turned very little down. &quot;When I became hot, so to speak, in the theater, I got a lot of offers&quot;, he said. &quot;I won&#x27;t tell you the pictures I turned down, because you&#x27;ll say, &#x27;You are a fool&#x27;—and I was a fool.&quot; He went to Italy to make a comedy, &quot;The Passionate Thief&quot; (1960), with Anna Magnani and Totò.

Back in the US he did a TV movie, &quot;Cry Vengeance!&quot;, and was second-billed in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; (both 1961). He was also the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; (September 6, 1961). He starred in &quot;Convicts 4&quot; (1962). He returned to Italy to make &quot;The Captive City&quot; (1962) with David Niven. Gazzara was the male lead in &quot;A Rage to Live&quot; (1965) with Suzanne Pleshette.

=== Television star ===

Gazzara became well known in several television series, beginning with &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, which ran from 1963 to 1964 on ABC.

He also appeared in the TV special &quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot; (1964) and had a short Broadway run in &quot;A Traveller without Luggage&quot; in 1964. He also guest-starred on &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;.

He gained fame in the TV series &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; which ran from 1965 to 1968 on NBC, in which he played a terminally ill man trying to get the most out of the last two years of his life. For his work in the series, Gazzara received two Emmy nominations for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series&quot; and three Golden Globe nominations for &quot;Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Drama.&quot;

When the series ended Gazzara had a cameo in &quot;If It&#x27;s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&quot; (1969) and a lead in the wartime action film &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; (1969).

=== John Cassavetes ===
Some of the actor&#x27;s most formidable characters were those he created with his friend John Cassavetes in the 1970s. They collaborated for the first time on Cassavetes&#x27;s film &quot;Husbands&quot; (1970), in which he appeared alongside Peter Falk and Cassavetes.

Gazzara starred in a television movie, &quot;Pursuit&quot; (1972), the directorial debut of Michael Crichton. He also made the television movies &quot;When Michael Calls&quot; (1972), &quot;Fireball Forward&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Family Rico&quot; (1972).

He made &quot;The Sicilian Connection&quot; (1972) in Italy, and did a science fiction film &quot;The Neptune Factor&quot; (1973). There were more television films &quot;You&#x27;ll Never See Me Again&quot; (1973) and &quot;Maneater&quot; (1973).

He starred in the television miniseries &quot;QB VII&quot; (1974), which won six primetime Emmy Awards. The six-and-a-half-hour series was based on a book by Leon Uris and co-starred Anthony Hopkins. He then played gangster Al Capone in the biographical film &quot;Capone&quot; (1975). Cassevetes was in the support cast.

Gazzara appeared on Broadway in &quot;Hughie&quot; (1975) then worked again for Cassavetes as director in &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; (1976), in which Gazzara took the leading role of the hapless strip-joint owner, Cosmo Vitelli. He starred in an action movie, &quot;High Velocity&quot; (1976), and was one of many stars in &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; (1976).

Gazzara returned to Broadway for a production of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; with Colleen Dewhurst in 1976.

A year later, he starred in yet another Cassavetes-directed movie, &quot;Opening Night&quot;, as stage director Manny Victor, who struggles with the mentally unstable star of his show, played by Cassavetes&#x27;s wife Gena Rowlands. He made an acclaimed TV movie &quot;The Death of Richie&quot; (1977).

=== Peter Bogdanovich ===
Gazzara&#x27;s career received a boost when Peter Bogdanovich cast him in the title role of &quot;Saint Jack&quot; (1979). His increased profile helped him be cast in the male lead of &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979) and the Korean War epic &quot;Inchon&quot; (1980) co-starring Laurence Olivier and Richard Roundtree.

He made another for Bogdanovich, &quot;They All Laughed&quot; (1981).

=== 1980s–1990s ===
Gazzara made some films in Europe: &quot;Tales of Ordinary Madness&quot; (1981), &quot;The Girl from Trieste&quot; (1982), &quot;A Proper Scandal&quot; (1984), &quot;My Dearest Son&quot; (1985). He starred with Rowlands in the critically acclaimed AIDS-themed TV movie &quot;An Early Frost&quot; (1985), for which he received his third Emmy nomination. He had a villainous role in the oft-televised Patrick Swayze film &quot;Road House&quot;, which the actor jokingly said is probably his most-watched performance.

Gazzara appeared in 38 films, many for television, in the 1990s. He worked with a number of renowned directors, such as the Coen brothers (&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;), Spike Lee (&quot;Summer of Sam&quot;), David Mamet (&quot;The Spanish Prisoner&quot;), Walter Hugo Khouri (&quot;Forever&quot;), Vincent Gallo (&quot;Buffalo &#x27;66&quot;), Todd Solondz (&quot;Happiness&quot;), John Turturro (&quot;Illuminata&quot;), and John McTiernan (&quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;). He was on Broadway in &quot;Shimada&quot; (1992).

In his seventies, Gazzara continued to be active. In 2003, he appeared in &quot;Nobody Don&#x27;t Like Yogi&quot;, an off-Broadway show about Yogi Berra that had a solid run, and was in a revival of &quot;Awake and Sing!&quot; (2006). He was in the ensemble cast of the experimental film &quot;Dogville&quot;, directed by Lars von Trier of Denmark and starring Nicole Kidman, as well as the television film &quot;Hysterical Blindness&quot; (he received an Emmy Award for his role). In 2005, he played Agostino Casaroli in the television miniseries &quot;Pope John Paul II&quot;. He completed filming his scenes in the film &quot;The Wait&quot; in early 2012, shortly before his death.

In addition to acting, Gazzara worked as an occasional television director; his credits include the &quot;Columbo&quot; episodes &quot;A Friend in Deed&quot; (1974) and &quot;Troubled Waters&quot; (1975). Gazzara was nominated three times for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play—in 1956 for &quot;A Hatful of Rain&quot;, in 1975 for the paired short plays &quot;Hughie&quot; and &quot;Duet&quot;, and in 1977 for a revival of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, opposite Colleen Dewhurst.

== Personal life ==
Gazzara was married three times, first to actress Louise Erickson (1951–1957). He married actress Janice Rule on November 25, 1961 in San Francisco. They had a daughter named Elizabeth. They divorced in 1979. He married model Elke Krivat in 1982 and remained married to her until his death. Gazzara adopted his wife&#x27;s daughter Danja from her prior relationship. Following his separation from his first wife, Gazzara was engaged to stage actress Elaine Stritch and later disclosed a love affair with actress Audrey Hepburn. He and Hepburn co-starred in two of her final films, &quot;Bloodline&quot; (1979) and &quot;They All Laughed&quot; (1981).

In 1968, during filming of the war movie &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot;, co-starring Gazzara and friend Robert Vaughn, the Soviet Union and its allies invaded Czechoslovakia. The cast and crew were detained for a time; filming was later completed in West Germany. During their departure from Czechoslovakia, Gazzara and Vaughn assisted with the escape of a Czech waitress whom they had befriended. They smuggled her to Austria in a car waved through a border crossing that had not yet been taken over by the Soviet army in its crackdown on the Prague Spring.

Gazzara was featured in a 1994 article in &quot;Cigar Aficionado&quot;, in which he admitted smoking four packs of cigarettes a day until taking up cigar smoking in the mid-1960s.

Beginning in the late 1970s, Gazzara held permanent residence status in Italy. He maintained a second home in Umbria, where he lived while working in Europe.

== Death ==
Gazzara was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1999. He suffered a stroke in 2005. On February 3, 2012, he died of pancreatic cancer at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. He was cremated.

<text>Pierre Alphonse Laurent (18 July 1813 – 2 September 1854) was a French mathematician, engineer, and Military Officer best known for discovering the Laurent series, an expansion of a function into an infinite power series, generalizing the Taylor series expansion.

He was born in Paris, France. His father, Pierre Michel Laurent (1769 – 1841) was French, whereas his mother, Eleanor Cheshire (1778 – 1840) was English. Pierre Laurent entered the École Polytechnique in Paris in 1830 and graduated in 1832 as one of the best students in his year. Afterwards, he joined the engineering corps as a second lieutenant, before attending the École d&#x27;Application at Metz until he was sent to Algeria.

Laurent returned to France from Algeria around 1840 and spent six years directing operations for the enlargement of the port of Le Havre on the English Channel coast. Rouen had been the main French port up to the nineteenth century, but the hydraulic construction projects on which Laurent worked in Le Havre turned it into France&#x27;s main seaport. It is clear that Laurent was a good engineer, putting his deep theoretical knowledge to good practical use.

It was while Laurent was working on the construction project at Le Havre that he began to write his first mathematical papers. He submitted a memoir for the Grand Prize of the Académie des Sciences of 1842. His result was contained in a memoir submitted for the Grand Prize of the Académie des Sciences in 1843, but his submission was after the due date, and the paper was not published and never considered for the prize. Laurent died at age 41 in Paris. His work was not published until after his death. Possibly the result was first discovered by Weierstrass in an 1841 paper, but not published at the time.

<doc id="1057410" wikidata="Q296233" url="?curid=1057410" title="Parmenion">
<text>Parmenion (also Parmenio; ; 400 – 330 BC), son of Philotas, was a Macedonian general in the service of Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great. A nobleman, Parmenion rose to become Philip&#x27;s chief military lieutenant and Alexander&#x27;s strategos (military general). He was assassinated after his son Philotas was convicted on a charge of treason. His siblings Asander and Agathon would also become prominent members of Alexander&#x27;s Macedonia.

== Military service to Philip II ==
During the reign of Philip II, Parmenion achieved a great victory over the Illyrians in 356 BC. Ten years later, Parmenion destroyed the southern Thessalian town of Halos. He was one of the Macedonian delegates appointed to conclude peace with Athens in 346 BC, and was sent with an army to oversee Macedonian influence in Euboea in 342 BC.

In 336 BC, Phillip II sent Parmenion, with Amyntas, Andromenes and Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia to make preparations to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Persian rule. At first, all went well. The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip&#x27;s death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Persians under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.

==Military service to Alexander==

Although Alexander was recognized as king in Macedonia in October 336 BC, his accession was opposed by Attalus, a general in Parmenion&#x27;s army. In response, Parmenion put the general to death even though Parmenion was father-in-law to Attalus. However, Parmenion recognised that this was a necessary act if Alexander&#x27;s succession was to be smooth. As a consequence, Alexander was in Parmenion&#x27;s debt particularly given that Parmenion was his most experienced general and commanded a large army.

As a result, a number of Parmenion&#x27;s relatives were placed by Alexander in key positions in the Macedonian army. His youngest son Nikanor became commander of the infantry regiment known as the Shield bearers, his son-in-law Coenus commanded a phalanx battalion while another relative named Nicanor became admiral of the navy made up of Macedonia&#x27;s fellow-Greek allies. Parmenion&#x27;s friend Amyntas and his brother Asander were placed in key positions. Parmenion&#x27;s oldest son Philotas was made commander of the Companion cavalry, a unit of 1,800 horsemen that was Macedonia&#x27;s most effective weapon in its battles. Parmenion became Alexander&#x27;s second in command, the same position he had held under Philip.

== Campaign against the Persian Empire ==
In 334 BC, Alexander joined Parmenion in Anatolia with reinforcements, thus starting Alexander&#x27;s campaign against Persia. During the great battles that followed, Parmenion commanded the left wing while Alexander himself commanded the right wing.

Meanwhile, the Persian satraps of Cilicia, Lydia, Hellespontine Phrygia and other territories had assembled at Zelea, near Dascylium. The two armies met near the river Granicus. Most ancient sources agree that Parmenion advised Alexander not to attack and that it was Alexander&#x27;s own idea to attack at once.

Parmenion is said to have acted as a foil to his commander&#x27;s innovative strategies, by expertly formulating the orthodox strategy. For instance, according to Arrian&#x27;s &quot;Anabasis of Alexander&quot;, at the Battle of Granicus, Parmenion suggested delay before the attack, as the army had already marched all day, always presenting the cautious path and often resulting in his being ignored by the King. Alexander attacked across the river regardless of this counsel and gained a victory nevertheless; however, Diodorus Siculus contradicts Arrian by stating clearly that Alexander accepted the advice. It is suggested that the Greeks were initially repulsed, and then stole a march on the Persians and crossed the river at night. This brought the Persian cavalry onto the field first against the Greeks the next morning, setting up a defeat in detail, as is reported in the accounts from that time. In any event, despite the Macedonians winning the overall battle, the near loss by Alexander during the battle may have tempered any youthful brashness on the part of Alexander, for he proceeded very cautiously the next six months or so as he liberated Greek cities in Asia Minor, and that muting of his aggressiveness is more in line with a near defeat.

After the battle, Parmenion captured the Persian stronghold Dascylium, the capital of Hellespontine Phrygia. Later, he seized Magnesia and Tralleis. His brother Asander was given responsibility for governing Lydia.

Meanwhile, Alexander liberated the Greek towns in Anatolia including Sardis, Ephesus, Miletus and Halicarnassus. During the winter of 334-333 BC, the king moved through Lycia. At the same time, Parmenion invaded central Anatolia from the west, driving out the remaining Persian troops and occupying the region. The two forces met each other in April 333 BC at Gordium, the capital of Phrygia. The united army then moved east to Cilicia where Parmenion captured the city of Tarsus.

Alexander planned to attack Darius in the plains of Sochi. However the Persian king with his large army had crossed the Amanus Mountains, captured Issus and then cut off the only Macedonian line of supply. The battle between the two forces took place south of Issus in November 333 BC. The Macedonians were victorious despite the Persian army being much larger, mainly because Parmenion had been able to counter the Persian attack. This gave Alexander a chance to launch a counter-attack.

It has been stated that Parmenion counselled a night attack in 331 BC on Darius&#x27; assembled superior forces at the Battle of Gaugamela, which Alexander took as evidence that Darius would keep his troops at the ready through the night and offer the Macedonians some advantage if they rested for a battle in daylight. During the battle, Parmenion led the Pezhetairos on the left flank which had been hurt by an opening made by Alexander&#x27;s speedy advance with the cavalry. In Plutarch&#x27;s Parallel Lives it is further suggested the escape of Darius was due to Parmenion&#x27;s &quot;sluggish and ineffectual&quot; leadership, or even that he was jealous of Alexander&#x27;s successes.

Parmenion would continue to be a significant influence and commander up until the conquest of Babylon. A steady hand commanding the left was critical in the overall Macedonian scheme and philosophy of battle, allowing the king to strike the decisive blow.

==Assassination==
After the conquest of Drangiana, Alexander was informed that Philotas, son of Parmenion, was involved in a conspiracy against his life. Philotas was condemned by the army and put to death. Alexander, fearing the consequences if he were to allow the father to live, sent orders to Media for the assassination of Parmenion. There was no proof that Parmenion was in any way implicated in the conspiracy, but he was not afforded the opportunity to defend himself. In Alexander&#x27;s defense, a disaffected Parmenion would have been a serious threat, especially since he was commanding an army of his own, second in prestige only to Alexander, and was stationed near Alexander&#x27;s treasury and on his supply lines. Also, as head of Philotas&#x27; family, Parmenion would have been held responsible for his actions, despite a lack of evidence connecting them to him. Alexander therefore acted swiftly and sent Cleander and Sitalces on racing camels across the desert by the most direct route possible to assassinate Parmenion. Before the news reached Parmenion of Alexander&#x27;s order, the two officers arrived and stabbed Parmenion to death.

His brother Asander would suffer in court for a short period following this but would later regain prominence in Alexander&#x27;s empire.

==In fiction==

Parmenion is the main character in David Gemmell&#x27;s books &quot;Lion of Macedon&quot; and &quot;Dark Prince&quot;.

In the 1956 film &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;, directed by Robert Rossen, Parmenion was played by Irish actor Niall MacGinnis.

In the 1961 television version of Terence Rattigan&#x27;s play &quot;Adventure Story&quot;, Parmenion is played by William Devlin.

In the 1999 film &quot;G2&quot;, Parmenion is portrayed as the Mongol rival to Alexander the Great&#x27;s swordbearer, who reincarnates along with the latter in 2003 to resolve a millennia-spanning conflict.

In the 2004 film &quot;Alexander&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone, Parmenion (played by John Kavanagh) is depicted as a trusted but conservative commander and is slightly marginalized. The film depicts him as being assassinated by Cleitus the Black and Antigonus just after reading from their letter informing him of his son&#x27;s execution (instead of by Cleander and Sitalces before he learns of it as is historically accurate).

<doc id="1057414" wikidata="Q1995526" url="?curid=1057414" title="Traumatic brain injury">
<text>A traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as an intracranial injury, is an injury to the brain caused by an external force. TBI can be classified based on severity ranging from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI/concussion) to severe traumatic brain injury. TBI can also be characterized based on mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury) or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury is a broader category that may involve damage to other structures such as the scalp and skull. TBI can result in physical, cognitive, social, emotional and behavioral symptoms, and outcomes can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death.
Causes include falls, vehicle collisions and violence. Brain trauma occurs as a consequence of a sudden acceleration or deceleration within the cranium or by a complex combination of both movement and sudden impact. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, a variety of events following the injury may result in further injury. These processes may include alterations in cerebral blood flow and pressure within the skull. Some of the imaging techniques used for diagnosis of moderate to severe TBI include computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).
Prevention measures include use of seat belts and helmets, not drinking and driving, fall prevention efforts in older adults and safety measures for children. Depending on the injury, treatment required may be minimal or may include interventions such as medications, emergency surgery or surgery years later. Physical therapy, speech therapy, recreation therapy, occupational therapy and vision therapy may be employed for rehabilitation. Counseling, supported employment and community support services may also be useful.
TBI is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children and young adults. Males sustain traumatic brain injuries around twice as often as females. The 20th century saw developments in diagnosis and treatment that decreased death rates and improved outcomes.

==Classification==

Traumatic brain injury is defined as damage to the brain resulting from external mechanical force, such as rapid acceleration or deceleration, impact, blast waves, or penetration by a projectile. Brain function is temporarily or permanently impaired and structural damage may or may not be detectable with current technology.
TBI is one of two subsets of acquired brain injury (brain damage that occur after birth); the other subset is non-traumatic brain injury, which does not involve external mechanical force (examples include stroke and infection). All traumatic brain injuries are head injuries, but the latter term may also refer to injury to other parts of the head; however, the terms &quot;head injury&quot; and &quot;brain injury&quot; are often used interchangeably. Similarly, brain injuries fall under the classification of central nervous system injuries and neurotrauma. In neuropsychology research literature, in general the term &quot;traumatic brain injury&quot; is used to refer to non-penetrating traumatic brain injuries.

TBI is usually classified based on severity, anatomical features of the injury, and the mechanism (the causative forces). Mechanism-related classification divides TBI into closed and penetrating head injury. A closed (also called nonpenetrating, or blunt) injury occurs when the brain is not exposed. A penetrating, or open, head injury occurs when an object pierces the skull and breaches the dura mater, the outermost membrane surrounding the brain.

===Severity===
Brain injuries can be classified into mild, moderate, and severe categories. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the most commonly used system for classifying TBI severity, grades a person&#x27;s level of consciousness on a scale of 3–15 based on verbal, motor, and eye-opening reactions to stimuli. In general, it is agreed that a TBI with a GCS of 13 or above is mild, 9–12 is moderate, and 8 or below is severe. Similar systems exist for young children; however, the GCS grading system has limited ability to predict outcomes. Because of this, other classification systems such as the one shown in the table are also used to help determine severity. A current model developed by the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs uses all three criteria of GCS after resuscitation, duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA), and loss of consciousness (LOC). It also has been proposed to use changes that are visible on neuroimaging, such as swelling, focal lesions, or diffuse injury as method of classification.

===Pathological features===
Systems also exist to classify TBI by its pathological features. Lesions can be extra-axial, (occurring within the skull but outside of the brain) or intra-axial (occurring within the brain tissue). Damage from TBI can be focal or diffuse, confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner, respectively; however, it is common for both types of injury to exist in a given case.
Diffuse injury manifests with little apparent damage in neuroimaging studies, but lesions can be seen with microscopy techniques post-mortem, and in the early 2000s, researchers discovered that diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a way of processing MRI images that shows white matter tracts, was an effective tool for displaying the extent of diffuse axonal injury. Types of injuries considered diffuse include edema (swelling), concussion and diffuse axonal injury, which is widespread damage to axons including white matter tracts and projections to the cortex.
Focal injuries often produce symptoms related to the functions of the damaged area. Research shows that the most common areas to have focal lesions in non-penetrating traumatic brain injury are the orbitofrontal cortex (the lower surface of the frontal lobes) and the anterior temporal lobes, areas that are involved in social behavior, emotion regulation, olfaction, and decision-making, hence the common social/emotional and judgment deficits following moderate-severe TBI. Symptoms such as hemiparesis or aphasia can also occur when less commonly affected areas such as motor or language areas are, respectively, damaged.
One type of focal injury, cerebral laceration, occurs when the tissue is cut or torn. Such tearing is common in orbitofrontal cortex in particular, because of bony protrusions on the interior skull ridge above the eyes. In a similar injury, cerebral contusion (bruising of brain tissue), blood is mixed among tissue. In contrast, intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding that is not mixed with tissue.
Hematomas, also focal lesions, are collections of blood in or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. Epidural hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptoms are dependent on the type of TBI (diffuse or focal) and the part of the brain that is affected. Unconsciousness tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury&#x27;s severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.

A person with a moderate or severe TBI may have a headache that does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions, an inability to awaken, dilation of one or both pupils, slurred speech, aphasia (word-finding difficulties), dysarthria (muscle weakness that causes disordered speech), weakness or numbness in the limbs, loss of coordination, confusion, restlessness, or agitation. Common long-term symptoms of moderate to severe TBI are changes in appropriate social behavior, deficits in social judgment, and cognitive changes, especially problems with sustained attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. Alexithymia, a deficiency in identifying, understanding, processing, and describing emotions occurs in 60.9% of individuals with TBI. Cognitive and social deficits have long-term consequences for the daily lives of people with moderate to severe TBI, but can be improved with appropriate rehabilitation.

When the pressure within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, it can be deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing&#x27;s triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory depression is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.

Small children with moderate to severe TBI may have some of these symptoms but have difficulty communicating them. Other signs seen in young children include persistent crying, inability to be consoled, listlessness, refusal to nurse or eat, and irritability.

==Causes==
The most common causes of TBI in the U.S. include violence, transportation accidents, construction site mishaps, and sports. Motor bikes are major causes, increasing in significance in developing countries as other causes reduce. The estimates that between 1.6 and 3.8 million traumatic brain injuries each year are a result of sports and recreation activities in the US. In children aged two to four, falls are the most common cause of TBI, while in older children traffic accidents compete with falls for this position. TBI is the third most common injury to result from child abuse. Abuse causes 19% of cases of pediatric brain trauma, and the death rate is higher among these cases. Although men are twice as likely to have a TBI, domestic violence is another cause of TBI, as are work-related and industrial accidents. Firearms and blast injuries from explosions are other causes of TBI, which is the leading cause of death and disability in war zones. According to Representative Bill Pascrell (Democrat, NJ), TBI is &quot;the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot;

==Mechanism==

===Physical forces===

The type, direction, intensity, and duration of forces all contribute to the characteristics and severity of TBI. Forces that may contribute to TBI include angular, rotational, shear, and translational forces.
Even in the absence of an impact, significant acceleration or deceleration of the head can cause TBI; however in most cases, a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed &quot;contact&quot; or &quot;impact loading&quot;, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed &quot;noncontact&quot; or &quot;inertial loading&quot;, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along the path of a projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.

Damage may occur directly under the site of impact, or it may occur on the side opposite the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a moving object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object.

===Primary and secondary injury===
A large percentage of the people killed by brain trauma do not die right away but rather days to weeks after the event; rather than improving after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs at the moment of trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.

Secondary injury events include damage to the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, excessive release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain&#x27;s white matter may separate from their cell bodies as a result of secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or brain herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is suspected based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, most prominently a neurological examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally in response to light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score. Neuroimaging helps in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give. DSM-5 can be utilized to diagnose TBI and its psychiatric sequelae.
The preferred radiologic test in the emergency setting is computed tomography (CT): it is quick, accurate, and widely available. Follow-up CT scans may be performed later to determine whether the injury has progressed.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can show more detail than CT, and can add information about expected outcome in the long term. It is more useful than CT for detecting injury characteristics such as diffuse axonal injury in the longer term; however, MRI is not used in the emergency setting for reasons including its relative inefficacy in detecting bleeds and fractures, its lengthy acquisition of images, the inaccessibility of the patient in the machine, and its incompatibility with metal items used in emergency care. A variant of MRI since 2012 is high-definition fiber tracking (HDFT).
Other techniques may be used to confirm a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography may be used to detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome.
Neuropsychological assessment can be performed to evaluate the long-term cognitive sequelae and to aid in the planning of the rehabilitation. Instruments range from short measures of general mental functioning to complete batteries formed of different domain-specific tests.

==Prevention==

Since a major cause of TBI are vehicle accidents, their prevention or the amelioration of their consequences can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.
Changes to common practices in sports have also been discussed. An increase in use of helmets could reduce the incidence of TBI. Due to the possibility that repeatedly &quot;heading&quot; a ball practicing soccer could cause cumulative brain injury, the idea of introducing protective headgear for players has been proposed. Improved equipment design can enhance safety; softer baseballs reduce head injury risk. Rules against dangerous types of contact, such as &quot;spear tackling&quot; in American football, when one player tackles another head first, may also reduce head injury rates.
Falls can be avoided by installing grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.

==Treatment==
It is important to begin emergency treatment within the so-called &quot;golden hour&quot; following the injury. People with moderate to severe injuries are likely to receive treatment in an intensive care unit followed by a neurosurgical ward. Treatment depends on the recovery stage of the patient. In the acute stage, the primary aim is to stabilize the patient and focus on preventing further injury. This is done because the initial damage caused by trauma cannot be reversed. Rehabilitation is the main treatment for the subacute and chronic stages of recovery. International clinical guidelines have been proposed with the aim of guiding decisions in TBI treatment, as defined by an authoritative examination of current evidence.

===Acute stage===
Tranexamic acid within three hours of a head injury decreases the risk of death. Certain facilities are equipped to handle TBI better than others; initial measures include transporting patients to an appropriate treatment center. Both during transport and in hospital the primary concerns are ensuring proper oxygen supply, maintaining adequate blood flow to the brain, and controlling raised intracranial pressure (ICP), since high ICP deprives the brain of badly needed blood flow and can cause deadly brain herniation. Other methods to prevent damage include management of other injuries and prevention of seizures. Some data supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes. Further research is required to determine the effectiveness and clinical importance of positioning the head at different angles (degrees of head-of-bed elevation) while the person is being treated in intensive care.

Neuroimaging is helpful but not flawless in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate way to measure ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has the added benefit of allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the person&#x27;s bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Propofol and midazolam are equally effective as sedatives.

Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be as effective as hypertonic saline at reducing ICP; however, some concerns have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Hyertonic saline is also suitable in children with severe traumatic brain injury.

Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Giving corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so their routine use is not recommended. There is no strong evidence that the following pharmaceutical interventions should be recommended to routinely treat TBI: magnesium, monoaminergic and dopamine agonists, progesterone, aminosteroids, excitatory amino acid reuptake inhibitors, beta-2 antagonists (bronchodilators), haemostatic and antifibrinolytic drugs.

Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation may be used to ensure proper oxygen supply and provide a secure airway. Hypotension (low blood pressure), which has a devastating outcome in TBI, can be prevented by giving intravenous fluids to maintain a normal blood pressure. Failing to maintain blood pressure can result in inadequate blood flow to the brain. Blood pressure may be kept at an artificially high level under controlled conditions by infusion of norepinephrine or similar drugs; this helps maintain cerebral perfusion. Body temperature is carefully regulated because increased temperature raises the brain&#x27;s metabolic needs, potentially depriving it of nutrients. Seizures are common. While they can be treated with benzodiazepines, these drugs are used carefully because they can depress breathing and lower blood pressure. Anti-convulsant medications have only been found to be useful for reducing the risk of an early seizure. Phenytoin and Levetiracetam appear to have similar levels of effectiveness for preventing early seizures. People with TBI are more susceptible to side effects and may react adversely to some medications. During treatment monitoring continues for signs of deterioration such as a decreasing level of consciousness.

Traumatic brain injury may cause a range of serious coincidental complications that include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised as part of the core care. Surgery can be performed on mass lesions or to eliminate objects that have penetrated the brain. Mass lesions such as contusions or hematomas causing a significant mass effect (shift of intracranial structures) are considered emergencies and are removed surgically. For intracranial hematomas, the collected blood may be removed using suction or forceps or it may be floated off with water. Surgeons look for hemorrhaging blood vessels and seek to control bleeding. In penetrating brain injury, damaged tissue is surgically debrided, and craniotomy may be needed. Craniotomy, in which part of the skull is removed, may be needed to remove pieces of fractured skull or objects embedded in the brain. Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is performed routinely in the very short period following TBI during operations to treat hematomas; part of the skull is removed temporarily (primary DC). DC performed hours or days after TBI in order to control persistently high intracranial pressures (secondary DC), although can reduce intracranial pressure and length of stay in ICU, but have worse Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, and high chances of death, vegetative state, or severe disability when compared to those receiving standard medical therapies.

===Chronic stage===
Once medically stable, people may be transferred to a subacute rehabilitation unit of the medical center or to an independent rehabilitation hospital. Rehabilitation aims to improve independent functioning at home and in society, and to help adapt to disabilities. Rehabilitation has demonstrated its general effectiveness when conducted by a team of health professionals who specialize in head trauma. As for any person with neurologic deficits, a multidisciplinary approach is key to optimizing outcome. Physiatrists or neurologists are likely to be the key medical staff involved, but depending on the person, doctors of other medical specialties may also be helpful. Allied health professions such as physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, cognitive rehabilitation therapy, and occupational therapy will be essential to assess function and design the rehabilitation activities for each person. Treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as emotional distress and clinical depression may involve mental health professionals such as therapists, psychologists, and psychiatrists, while neuropsychologists can help to evaluate and manage cognitive deficits. Social workers, rehabilitation support personnel, nutritionists, therapeutic recreationists, and pharmacists are also important members of the TBI rehabilitation team. After discharge from the inpatient rehabilitation treatment unit, care may be given on an outpatient basis. Community-based rehabilitation will be required for a high proportion of people, including vocational rehabilitation; this supportive employment matches job demands to the worker&#x27;s abilities. People with TBI who cannot live independently or with family may require care in supported living facilities such as group homes. Respite care, including day centers and leisure facilities for disabled people, offers time off for caregivers, and activities for people with TBI.

Pharmacological treatment can help to manage psychiatric or behavioral problems. Medication is also used to control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.
The most effective research documented intervention approach is the activation database guided EEG biofeedback approach, which has shown significant improvements in memory abilities of the TBI subject that are far superior than traditional approaches (strategies, computers, medication intervention). Gains of 2.61 standard deviations have been documented. The TBI&#x27;s auditory memory ability was superior to the control group after the treatment.

There is a promising technology called activation database-guided EEG biofeedback, which has been documented to return a TBI&#x27;s auditory memory ability to above the control group&#x27;s performance
=== Effect on the gait pattern ===

In patients who have developed paralysis of the legs in the form of spastic hemiplegia or diplegia as a result of the traumatic brain injury, various gait patterns can be observed, the exact extent of which can only be described with the help of complex gait analysis systems. In order to facilitate interdisciplinary communication in the interdisciplinary team between those affected, doctors, physiotherapists and orthotists, a simple description of the gait pattern is useful. J. Rodda and H. K. Graham already described in 2001 how gait patterns of CP patients can be more easily recognized and defined gait types which they compared in a classification. They also described that gait patterns can vary with age. Building on this, the Amsterdam Gait Classification was developed at the free university in Amsterdam, the VU medisch centrum. A special feature of this classification is that it makes different gait patterns very recognizable and can be used in patients in whom only one leg and both legs are affected. The Amsterdam Gait Classification was developed for viewing patients with cerebral palsy; however, it can be used just as well in patients with traumatic brain injuries. According to the Amsterdam Gait Classification, five gait types are described. To assess the gait pattern, the patient is viewed visually or via a video recording from the side of the leg to be assessed. At the point in time at which the leg to be viewed is in mid stance and the leg not to be viewed is in mid swing, the knee angle and the contact of the foot with the ground are assessed on the one hand.

Classification of the gait pattern according to the Amsterdam Gait Classification: In gait type 1, the knee angle is normal and the foot contact is complete. In gait type 2, the knee angle is hyperextended and the foot contact is complete. In gait type 3, the knee angle is hyperextended and foot contact is incomplete (only on the forefoot). In gait type 4, the knee angle is bent and foot contact is incomplete (only on the forefoot). With gait type 5, which is also known as crouch gait, the knee angle is bent and the foot contact is complete.

=== Orthotics ===

To improve the gait pattern, orthotics can be included in the therapy concept. An Orthosis can support physiotherapeutic treatment in setting the right motor impulses in order to create new cerebral connections. The orthosis must meet the requirements of the medical prescription. In addition, the orthosis must be designed by the orthotist in such a way that it achieves the effectiveness of the necessary levers, matching the gait pattern, in order to support the proprioceptive approaches of physiotherapy. The orthotic concepts of the treatment are based on the concepts for the patients with cerebral palsy. The characteristics of the stiffness of the orthosis shells and the adjustable dynamics in the ankle joint are important elements of the orthosis to be considered.

The orthotic concepts of the treatment are based on the concepts for the patients with cerebral palsy. Due to these requirements, the development of orthoses has changed significantly in recent years, especially since around 2010. At about the same time, care concepts were developed that deal intensively with the orthotic treatment of the lower extremities in cerebral palsy. Modern materials and new functional elements enable the rigidity to be specifically adapted to the requirements that fits to the gait pattern of the patient. The adjustment of the stiffness has a decisive influence on the gait pattern and on the energy cost of walking. It is of great advantage if the stiffness of the orthosis can be adjusted separately from one another via resistances of the two functional elements in the two directions of movement, dorsiflexion and plantar flexion.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis worsens with the severity of injury. Most TBIs are mild and do not cause permanent or long-term disability; however, all severity levels of TBI have the potential to cause significant, long-lasting disability. Permanent disability is thought to occur in 10% of mild injuries, 66% of moderate injuries, and 100% of severe injuries. Most mild TBI is completely resolved within three weeks. Almost all people with mild TBI are able to live independently and return to the jobs they had before the injury, although a small portion have mild cognitive and social impairments. Over 90% of people with moderate TBI are able to live independently, although some require assistance in areas such as physical abilities, employment, and financial managing. Most people with severe closed head injury either die or recover enough to live independently; middle ground is less common. Coma, as it is closely related to severity, is a strong predictor of poor outcome.

Prognosis differs depending on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with epidural hematoma are expected to have a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient&#x27;s involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.

Medical complications are associated with a bad prognosis. Examples of such complications include: hypotension (low blood pressure), hypoxia (low blood oxygen saturation), lower cerebral perfusion pressures, and longer times spent with high intracranial pressures. Patient characteristics also influence prognosis. Examples of factors thought to worsen it include: abuse of substances such as illicit drugs and alcohol and age over sixty or under two years (in children, younger age at time of injury may be associated with a slower recovery of some abilities). Other influences that may affect recovery include pre-injury intellectual ability, coping strategies, personality traits, family environment, social support systems and financial circumstances.

Life satisfaction has been known to decrease for individuals with TBI immediately following the trauma, but evidence has shown that life roles, age, and depressive symptoms influence the trajectory of life satisfaction as time passes. Many people with traumatic brain injuries have poor physical fitness following their acute injury and this may result with difficulties in day-to-day activities and increased levels of fatigue.

==Complications==


Improvement of neurological function usually occurs for two or more years after the trauma. For many years it was believed that recovery was fastest during the first six months, but there is no evidence to support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.
Complications are distinct medical problems that may arise as a result of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.

Movement disorders that may develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), spasticity (muscle contractions are overactive), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), and loss of movement range and control (in particular with a loss of movement repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas. People with early seizures, those occurring within a week of injury, have an increased risk of post-traumatic epilepsy (recurrent seizures occurring more than a week after the initial trauma). People may lose or experience altered vision, hearing, or smell.

Hormonal disturbances may occur secondary to hypopituitarism, occurring immediately or years after injury in 10 to 15% of TBI patients. Development of diabetes insipidus or an electrolyte abnormality acutely after injury indicate need for endocrinologic work up. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism may develop and be screened for in adults with moderate TBI and in mild TBI with imaging abnormalities. Children with moderate to severe head injury may also develop hypopituitarism. Screening should take place 3 to 6 months, and 12 months after injury, but problems may occur more remotely.
Cognitive deficits that can follow TBI include impaired attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive functions such as abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have had TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken or written language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed may be at risk for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).
TBI may cause emotional, social, or behavioral problems and changes in personality. These may include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, hypomania, mania, apathy, irritability, problems with social judgment, and impaired conversational skills. TBI appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, substance abuse, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. In patients who have depression after TBI, suicidal ideation is not uncommon; the suicide rate among these persons is increased 2- to 3-fold. Social and behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include disinhibition, inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, asociality and social withdrawal, and changes in personality.
TBI also has a substantial impact on the functioning of family systems Caregiving family members and TBI survivors often significantly alter their familial roles and responsibilities following injury, creating significant change and strain on a family system. Typical challenges identified by families recovering from TBI include: frustration and impatience with one another, loss of former lives and relationships, difficulty setting reasonable goals, inability to effectively solve problems as a family, increased level of stress and household tension, changes in emotional dynamics, and overwhelming desire to return to pre-injury status. In addition, families may exhibit less effective functioning in areas including coping, problem solving and communication. Psychoeducation and counseling models have been demonstrated to be effective in minimizing family disruption.

==Epidemiology==
TBI is a leading cause of death and disability around the globe and presents a major worldwide social, economic, and health problem. It is the number one cause of coma, it plays the leading role in disability due to trauma, and is the leading cause of brain damage in children and young adults. In Europe it is responsible for more years of disability than any other cause. It also plays a significant role in half of trauma deaths.

Findings on the frequency of each level of severity vary based on the definitions and methods used in studies. A World Health Organization study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head injuries that receive treatment are mild, and a US study found that moderate and severe injuries each account for 10% of TBIs, with the rest mild.

The incidence of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors. Findings of incidence and prevalence in epidemiological studies vary based on such factors as which grades of severity are included, whether deaths are included, whether the study is restricted to hospitalized people, and the study&#x27;s location. The annual incidence of mild TBI is difficult to determine but may be 100–600 people per 100,000.

===Mortality===
In the US, the case fatality rate is estimated to be 21% by 30 days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter at the beginning of the 21st century. This decline in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.

Biological, clinical, and demographic factors contribute to the likelihood that an injury will be fatal. In addition, outcome depends heavily on the cause of head injury. In the US, patients with fall-related TBIs have an 89% survival rate, while only 9% of patients with firearm-related TBIs survive. In the US, firearms are the most common cause of fatal TBI, followed by vehicle accidents and then falls. Of deaths from firearms, 75% are considered to be suicides.
The incidence of TBI is increasing globally, due largely to an increase in motor vehicle use in low- and middle-income countries. In developing countries, automobile use has increased faster than safety infrastructure could be introduced. In contrast, vehicle safety laws have decreased rates of TBI in high-income countries, which have seen decreases in traffic-related TBI since the 1970s. Each year in the United States, about two million people have a TBI, approximately 675,000 injuries are seen in the emergency department, and about 500,000 patients are hospitalized. The yearly incidence of TBI is estimated at 180–250 per 100,000 people in the US, 281 per 100,000 in France, 361 per 100,000 in South Africa, 322 per 100,000 in Australia, and 430 per 100,000 in England. In the European Union the yearly aggregate incidence of TBI hospitalizations and fatalities is estimated at 235 per 100,000.

===Demographics===

TBI is present in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The greatest number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24. Because TBI is more common in young people, its costs to society are high due to the loss of productive years to death and disability. The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80, and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65. The incidence of fall-related TBI in First-World countries is increasing as the population ages; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased.
Regardless of age, TBI rates are higher in males. Men have twice as many TBIs as women do and have a fourfold risk of fatal head injury, and males account for two thirds of childhood and adolescent head trauma; however, when matched for severity of injury, women appear to fare more poorly than men.
Socioeconomic status also appears to affect TBI rates; people with lower levels of education and employment and lower socioeconomic status are at greater risk. Approximately half of those incarcerated in prisons and jails in the United States have had TBIs.

==History==
Head injury is present in ancient myths that may date back before recorded history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation may have been used to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550 BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain to be the center of thought, probably due to their experience observing the effects of head trauma.
Medieval and Renaissance surgeons continued the practice of trepanation for head injury. In the Middle Ages, physicians further described head injury symptoms and the term &quot;concussion&quot; became more widespread. Concussion symptoms were first described systematically in the 16th century by Berengario da Carpi.
It was first suggested in the 18th century that intracranial pressure rather than skull damage was the cause of pathology after TBI. This hypothesis was confirmed around the end of the 19th century, and opening the skull to relieve pressure was then proposed as a treatment.
In the 19th century it was noted that TBI is related to the development of psychosis. At that time a debate arose around whether post-concussion syndrome was due to a disturbance of the brain tissue or psychological factors. The debate continues today.

Perhaps the first reported case of personality change after brain injury is that of Phineas Gage, who survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven through his head, destroying one or both of his frontal lobes; numerous cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since.
The 20th century saw the advancement of technologies that improved treatment and diagnosis such as the development of imaging tools including CT and MRI, and, in the 21st century, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The introduction of intracranial pressure monitoring in the 1950s has been credited with beginning the &quot;modern era&quot; of head injury. Until the 20th century, the mortality rate of TBI was high and rehabilitation was uncommon; improvements in care made during World War I reduced the death rate and made rehabilitation possible. Facilities dedicated to TBI rehabilitation were probably first established during World War I. Explosives used in World War I caused many blast injuries; the large number of TBIs that resulted allowed researchers to learn about localization of brain functions. Blast-related injuries are now common problems in returning veterans from Iraq &amp; Afghanistan; research shows that the symptoms of such TBIs are largely the same as those of TBIs involving a physical blow to the head.

In the 1970s, awareness of TBI as a public health problem grew, and a great deal of progress has been made since then in brain trauma research, such as the discovery of primary and secondary brain injury. The 1990s saw the development and dissemination of standardized guidelines for treatment of TBI, with protocols for a range of issues such as drugs and management of intracranial pressure. Research since the early 1990s has improved TBI survival; that decade was known as the &quot;Decade of the Brain&quot; for advances made in brain research.

==Research directions==
===Diagnosis===
Quantitative EEG and EEG, which has no specific patterns in TBI is used in research settings to differentiate between mild TBI and no TBI.

===Medications===
As of 2008, no medication is approved to halt the progression of the initial injury to secondary injury. The variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with the damage processes.

Further research is necessary to determine if the vasoconstrictor indomethacin (indometacin) can be used to treat increased pressure in the skull following a TBI. In addition, drugs such as NMDA receptor antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as excitotoxicity showed promise in animal trials but failed in clinical trials. These failures could be due to factors including faults in the trial designs or in the insufficiency of a single agent to prevent the array of injury processes involved in secondary injury. Other topics of research have included investigations into mannitol, dexamethasone, barbiturates, magnesium (no strong evidence), and calcium channel blockers.

===Procedures===
Although neuroprotection methods to decrease secondary injury have been the subject of interest follows TBI, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure as of 2008. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2020 Cochrane review did not find enough evidence to see if it was useful or not. Maintaining a normal temperature in the immediate period after a TBI appeared useful. One review found a lower than normal temperature was useful in adults but not children. While two other reviews found it did not appear to be useful. In addition to traditional imaging modalities, there are several devices that help to monitor brain injury and facilitate research. Microdialysis allows ongoing sampling of extracellular fluid for analysis of metabolites that might indicate ischemia or brain metabolism, such as glucose, glycerol, and glutamate. Intraparenchymal brain tissue oxygen monitoring systems (either Licox or Neurovent-PTO) are used routinely in neurointensive care in the US. A non invasive model called CerOx is in development.

Research is also planned to clarify factors correlated to outcome in TBI and to determine in which cases it is best to perform CT scans and surgical procedures.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) has been evaluated as an add on treatment following TBI. The findings of a 2012 Cochrane systematic review does not justify the routine use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy to treat people recovering from a traumatic brain injury. This review also reported that only a small number of randomized controlled trials had been conducted at the time of the review, many of which had methodological problems and poor reporting. HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.

===Psychological===
Further research is required to determine the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment approaches for treating depression in children/adolescents and adults with TBI.

As of 2010, the use of predictive visual tracking measurement to identify mild traumatic brain injury was being studied. In visual tracking tests, a head-mounted display unit with eye-tracking capability shows an object moving in a regular pattern. People without brain injury are able to track the moving object with smooth pursuit eye movements and correct trajectory. The test requires both attention and working memory which are difficult functions for people with mild traumatic brain injury. The question being studied, is whether results for people with brain injury will show visual-tracking gaze errors relative to the moving target.

===Monitoring pressure===

Pressure reactivity index is used to correlate intracranial pressure with arterial blood pressure to give information about the state of cerebral perfusion, thus guiding treatment and prevent excessively high or low blood flow to the brain. However, such method of monitoring intracranial pressure of equal or less than 20 mmHg is no better than imaging and clinical examination that monitor the neurological status of the brain in prolonging the survival, preserving the mental or functional status of the subject.

===Sensory processing===
In animal models of TBI, sensory processing has been widely studied to show systematic defects arise and are slowly but likely only partially recovered. It is especially characterised by an initial period of decreased activity in upper cortical layers. This period of decreased activity has also been characterised as by specific timing effects in the patterns of cortical activity in these upper layers in response to regular sensory stimuli.

<text>A typographical error (often shortened to typo), also called a misprint, is a mistake (such as a spelling or transposition error) made in the typing of printed or electronic material. Historically, this referred to mistakes in manual typesetting. Technically, the term includes errors due to mechanical failure or slips of the hand or finger, but excludes &quot;errors of ignorance&quot;, such as spelling errors, or changing and misuse of words such as &quot;than&quot; and &quot;then&quot;. Before the arrival of printing, the copyist&#x27;s mistake or scribal error was the equivalent for manuscripts. Most typos involve simple duplication, omission, transposition, or substitution of a small number of characters.

&quot;Fat finger&quot; typing (especially in the financial sector) is a slang term referring to an unwanted secondary action when typing. When a finger is bigger than the touch zone, with touchscreens or keyboards, there can be inaccuracy and one may hit two keys in a single keystroke. An example is &quot;&quot; instead of &quot;&quot;, due to the &quot;L&quot; key being next to the &quot;K&quot; key on the QWERTY keyboard, the most common keyboard for Latin-script alphabets.

==Marking typos==
===Typesetting===
Historically, the process of converting a manuscript to a printed document required a typesetter to copy the text and print a first &quot;galley proof&quot; (familiarly, &quot;a proof&quot;). It may contain typographical errors (&quot;printer&#x27;s errors&quot;), as a result of human error during typesetting. Traditionally, a proofreader compares the manuscript with the corresponding typeset portion, and then marks any errors (sometimes called &quot;line edits&quot;) using standard proofreaders&#x27; marks.

===Typing===

When using a typewriter without correction tape, typos were commonly struck out with another character such as a strikethrough. This saved the typist the trouble of retyping the entire page to eliminate the error, but as evidence of the typo remained, it was not aesthetically pleasing. Correction fluid was invented to hide the original mark and allow the typist to correct the error almost invisibly. Word processing software all but eliminated the need for this solution.

===Social media===
In computer forums, sometimes &quot;^H&quot; (a visual representation of the ASCII backspace character) was used to &quot;erase&quot; intentional typos: &quot;Be nice to this fool^H^H^H^Hgentleman, he&#x27;s visiting from corporate HQ.&quot;

In instant messaging, users often send messages in haste and only afterward notice the typo. It is common practice to correct the typo by sending a subsequent message in which an asterisk (*) is placed before (or after) the correct word.

===Textual analysis===
In formal prose, it is sometimes necessary to quote text containing typos or other doubtful words. In such cases, the author will write &quot;[&quot;sic&quot;]&quot; to indicate that an error was in the original quoted source rather than in the transcription.

==Scribal errors==
Scribal errors receive a lot of attention in the context of textual criticism. Many of these mistakes are not specific to manuscripts and can be referred to as typos. Some classifications include homeoteleuton and homeoarchy (skipping a line due to the similarity of the ending or beginning), haplography (copying once what appeared twice), dittography (copying twice what appeared once), contamination (introduction of extraneous elements), metathesis (reversing the order of some elements), unwitting mistranscription of similar elements, mistaking similar looking letters, the substitution of homophones, fission and fusion (joining or separating words).

== Biblical errors ==

The Wicked Bible omits the word &quot;not&quot; in the commandment, &quot;thou shalt not commit adultery&quot;.

The Judas Bible is a copy of the second folio edition of the authorized version, printed by Robert Barker, printer to James VI and I, in 1613, and given to the church for the use of the Mayor of Totnes. This edition is known as the &quot;Judas Bible&quot; because in Matthew 26:36 &quot;Judas&quot; appears instead of &quot;Jesus&quot;. In this copy, the mistake is corrected with a slip of paper pasted over the misprint.

==Intentional typos==
Certain typos, or kinds of typos, have acquired widespread notoriety and are occasionally used deliberately for humorous purposes. For instance, the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Grauniad&quot; due to its reputation for frequent typesetting errors in the era before computer typesetting. This usage began as a running joke in the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The magazine continues to refer to &quot;The Guardian&quot; by this name.

Typos are common on social media, and some—such as &quot;teh&quot;, &quot;pwned&quot;, and &quot;&quot;—have become in-jokes among Internet groups and subcultures. P0rn is not a typo but an example of obfuscation, where people make a word harder for filtering software to understand while retaining its meaning to human readers.

In mapping, it was common practice to include deliberate errors so that copyright theft could be identified.

===Typosquatting===

Typosquatting is a form of cybersquatting that relies on typographical errors made by users of the Internet. Typically, the cybersquatter will register a likely typo of a frequently-accessed website address in the hope of receiving traffic when internet users mistype that address into a web browser. Deliberately introducing typos into a web page, or into its metadata, can also draw unwitting visitors when they enter these typos in Internet search engines.

An example of this is codice_1 instead of codice_2 which could potentially be harmful to the user.

===Typos in online auctions===
Since the emergence and popularization of online auction sites such as eBay, misspelled auction searches have quickly become lucrative for people searching for deals. The concept on which these searches are based is that, if an individual posts an auction and misspells its description and/or title, regular searches will not find this auction. However, a search that includes misspelled alterations of the original search term in such a way as to create misspellings, transpositions, omissions, double strikes, and wrong key errors would find most misspelled auctions. The resulting effect is that there are far fewer bids than there would be under normal circumstances, allowing the searcher to obtain the item for less. A series of third-party websites have sprung up allowing people to find these items.

==Atomic typos==
Another kind of typo—informally called an &quot;atomic typo&quot;—is a typo that happens to result in a correctly spelled word that is different from the intended one. Since it is spelled correctly, a simple spellchecker cannot find the mistake. The term was used at least as early as 1995 by Robert Terry.

A few illustrative examples include: 
* &quot;now&quot; instead of &quot;not&quot;,
* &quot;unclear&quot; instead of &quot;nuclear&quot;
* &quot;you&quot; instead of &quot;your&quot;
* &quot;Sudan&quot; instead of &quot;&quot; (leading to a diplomatic incident in 2005 between Sudan and the United States regarding a nuclear test code-named Sedan)
* instead of &quot;United States&quot;
* &quot;the&quot; instead of &quot;they&quot;
and many more. For any of these, the converse is also true.

<doc id="1057439" wikidata="Q302413" url="?curid=1057439" title="Lobkowicz family">
<text>The House of Lobkowicz (&quot;Lobkovicové&quot; in modern Czech, sg. &quot;z Lobkovic&quot;; &quot;Lobkowitz&quot; in German) is an important Bohemian noble family that dates back to the 14th century and is one of the oldest noble families of the region. Over the centuries, the family expanded their possessions through marriage with the most powerful families of the region, which resulted in gaining vast territories all across central Europe. Due to that, the family was also incorporated into the German, Austrian and Belgian nobility. 

== History ==
The first Lobkowiczs were members of the gentry of north-eastern Bohemia in the late 14th century. On 3 August 1459 they were granted the title of Freiherr. In the 17th century, members of the family were awarded with the title of Prince, which was granted to them on 17 October 1623 by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1786, Emperor Joseph II further ennobled the 7th Prince when he created him Duke of Roudnice (&quot;Herzog von Raudnitz&quot; in German, &quot;vévoda roudnický&quot; in Czech).

The family&#x27;s Imperial immediacy over Princely county of Störnstein was mediatized to Bavaria in 1807. As such, the House of Lobkowicz belong to the small group of families that constitute the and is one of the mediatised houses.

==Notable family members==
* Mikuláš Chudý (&quot;the Poor&quot;) z Újezda (c. 1378–1435) was a poor squire from the village of Újezd in Bohemia. After studying at the Charles University in Prague, he became a scribe in Kutná Hora. King Wenceslaus IV rewarded him for his services with the title to the village of Lobkovice (after which he began styling himself Nicholas of Lobkowicz), and he became the supreme scribe of the Bohemian kingdom in 1417. At the king&#x27;s command, he captured several castles belonging to rebellious nobles; he was allowed to keep one, Hasištejn Castle, as a hereditary possession.
* Nicholas Hasištejnský z Lobkowicz (died 1462). The elder son of Nicholas of Lobkowicz, he inherited Hasištejn Castle. He and his brother Jan were raised to the status of free lords by Emperor Frederick III in 1459. Twenty years later, they were awarded Czech lordly status as well.
* Jan Popel z Lobkowicz (died 1470) was the younger son of Nicholas of Lobkowicz. He inherited Hluboká Castle and the village of Lobkovice from his father&#x27;s estate. Along with his elder brother Nicholas, he was ennobled in 1459. 
* Jan Hasištejnský z Lobkovic (1450–1517) was a diplomat who traveled on ambassadorial missions to Luxembourg in 1477 and Rome in 1487. King Vladislaus II entrusted him with negotiating his marriage to Mary of Burgundy, but the match ultimately never occurred. Much like his younger brother Bohuslav, the so-called “Czech Ulysses,” Jan journeyed to the Holy Land, later writing a book about his experiences (&quot;Pilgrimage to the Holy Grave in Jerusalem&quot;, 1505). He helped develop a Franciscan monastery in Kadaň, and is buried there. 
* His brother Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic (1461–1510) was a poet, essayist, and philosopher. He was well known for his prose, letters, and verses, including a satire on life in Bohemia. An extensive traveler who studied in Bologna and Ferrara and who voyaged to Egypt and the Holy Land, Bohuslav was elected Bishop of Olomouc but never held that office, as the pope refused to appoint him. He collected more than 650 books, primarily humanist and classical texts—an astonishing number for the era in which he lived. Roughly two thirds of his collection remains in the Lobkowicz Library, including more than 400 of the 750 incunabula belonging to the library.
* Krystof Popel the Younger of Lobkowicz (1549–1609) was the Chief Steward of Bohemia during the reign of Emperor Rudolf II. Kryštof was a close friend of Hans von Aachen, the celebrated court painter. Known for his diplomatic and linguistic skills, he was often tasked with welcoming foreign visitors—including Persians, Turks, and Russians—to the Emperor&#x27;s court, and was responsible for peace negotiations with the Polish king Sigismund.
* Jiří Popel z Lobkowicz (c. 1551–1607 or 1613) was a devout Catholic nobleman who founded a Jesuit college in Chomutov and reestablished a monastery in Kadaň after it had been abolished due to connections with Lutheranism. Influential at the Imperial Court, in 1585 he became the Court Administrator, the second-highest office in Bohemia. However, he soon fell out of favor with Emperor Rudolf II, who blamed him and the other councillors for his brother Maximilian&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Byczyna and subsequent imprisonment. In 1593, he and his brother Ladislav Popel z Lobkowicz led an unsuccessful revolt against Rudolf II among the nobility. The two brothers fled Prague and were sentenced to death in absentia; Jiří was captured, but the Emperor lessened his sentence to life imprisonment and loss of property. He remained in prison for the rest of his life; the date of his death is unknown, but the years most frequently cited are 1607 and 1613.
* Vilém mladší Popel z Lobkovic (c. 1575–1647). On 15 June 1587, he inherited the lordship of Horšovský Týn, which his father, John the Younger, had purchased in 1546. He was a royal councillor, and a court justice from 1628 to 1634. Being a Protestant, he was dispossessed in favour of the Catholic Lobkowicz line after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620. 
* Zdeněk Vojtěch Popel z Lobkovic (1568–1628), 1st Prince Lobkowicz, was Chancellor to the Czech Kingdom under Emperors Rudolf II, Matthias, and Ferdinand II. Zdeněk Vojtěch was a major political figure in both Bohemia and the larger Habsburg empire. He and his wife Polyxena Pernštejn (1566–1642), the daughter of a Chancellor to the Czech Kingdom and an influential Spanish noblewoman, were leaders of the “Spanish” (i.e. Catholic) bloc at court, opposed to the Protestant factions. When the Emperor&#x27;s Catholic ministers were hurled from the windows of Prague Castle in the famous Defenestration of Prague in 1618, they took refuge in the nearby Lobkowicz Palace. The incident also signalled a turning point in the fortunes of the Lobkowicz family: although their property was confiscated by rebellious Protestants in 1618, the Catholic victory at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 resulted in the restoration of their property and ensured that the family, as Catholic nobles, would continue to be highly influential. That same year, King Philip III of Spain awarded Zdeněk Vojtěch the Order of the Golden Fleece, the highest order of European chivalry. In 1624, Ferdinand II granted him the title of Imperial Prince, and he became the first hereditary Prince Lobkowicz.
* Polyxena Pernštejn (1566–1642), 1st Princess Lobkowicz, was the daughter of Vratislav II of Pernštejn (1530–1582), Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom, and Maria Maximiliana Manrique de Lara y Mendoza (1538–1608), an influential Spanish noblewoman. In 1587, she became the fourth wife of William of Rosenberg (1535–1592), High Treasurer and High Burgrave of Bohemia and the wealthiest man in the country. After William&#x27;s death, she married Zdeněk Vojtěch of Lobkowicz, Chancellor of the Czech Kingdom and later 1st Prince Lobkowicz. As all of William&#x27;s marriages had been childless, Polyxena&#x27;s marriage to Zdeněk Vojtěch brought considerable wealth and property into the Lobkowicz family. Polyxena and her husband were highly influential at the Imperial Habsburg court, where they spearheaded Catholic opposition to Protestant factions. After the Defenestration of Prague in 1618, the Emperor&#x27;s Catholic ministers took refuge in the Lobkowicz Palace. A later painting shows a romanticized version of the incident, with Polyxena barring the door of the palace against a Protestant mob while the battered ministers cower behind her—while another version of events claims that Polyxena concealed the ministers under her skirts. The defeat of the Protestants at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620 ensured that the Lobkowicz family would continue to play a major role in Bohemian and Imperial politics.
* Kateřina Benigna Popelovna Lobkowicz (1594–1653), wife of Vilém mladší Popel z Lobkowicz, helped establish Loreta as a significant pilgrimage destination in Prague. She financed the construction of the site, which was designed by Italian architect Giovanni Orsi and built between 1626 and 1631. 
* Anna Magdalene (1606–1668), Baroness Popel von Lobkowicz, was the daughter of William the Younger Popel of Lobkowicz, Lord of Horšovský Týn. She married Julius Henry, Imperial Field Marshal and future Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, in 1632. Of their six children, two survived infancy. The youngest, Julius Francis (1641–1689), was the last Ascanian duke of Saxe-Lauenburg.
* Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (1606–1682) was a Spanish Catholic philosopher, mathematician, architect and architectural theorist, ecclesiastic, and writer, believed to be a grandson of the eldest daughter of Jan Popel z Lobkowicz (c. 1527–1590). After a precocious childhood, he entered the Cistercian Order and was later awarded a doctorate of theology by the University of Leuven. His titles and positions included Philip IV of Spain&#x27;s envoy to the court of Emperor Ferdinand III; Abbot of Melrose, Scotland; Abbot-Superior of the Benedictines of Vienna; Grand Vicar to the Archbishop of Prague; Bishop of Satrianum; Bishop of Campagna; and, at his death, Bishop of Vigevano. His intellectual pursuits were no less illustrious: he published 262 works on subjects from poetry to astronomy to asceticism, was one of the earliest scholars to write on probability, and designed the façade of the Vigevano Cathedral. When the Swedes attacked Prague in 1648, he armed and led a band of ecclesiastics to serve in defense of the city, and the emperor rewarded him for his bravery with a collar of gold.

* Václav Eusebius František (1609–1677), 2nd Prince Lobkowicz, was the only child of Zdeněk Vojtěch and Polyxena Pernštejn, and became one of the most influential European statesmen of the 17th century. He raised his own regiment to fight in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and held high offices at the Habsburg court, advising Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I in his capacity as President of the Imperial War Cabinet (from 1652) and President of the Imperial Privy Council (from 1669). He had a close connection with the Infanta Margarita Teresa of Spain, Leopold I&#x27;s young wife. The Lobkowicz Collections’ portrait of the Infanta (attributed to Velázquez) was presumably acquired during Leopold&#x27;s reign. He also transformed his family&#x27;s properties, overseeing the remodeling of the Lobkowicz Palace in Prague by Italian Baroque artists and the reconstruction of Roudnice Castle from a ruin to the family seat, and purchasing the ducal estate of Sagan in Silesia from Ferdinand III in 1646.
* František Vilém (1616–1670), the fourth son of Vilém mladší Popel z Lobkowicz, served as a councillor to Emperors Ferdinand III and Leopold I between 1647 and 1659. He was rewarded with the title of Highest Hunter in the Kingdom of Bohemia, a hereditary honor. 
* Ferdinand August (1655–1715), 3rd Prince Lobkowicz, was a painting connoisseur whose additions to the Lobkowicz Collections include Veronese&#x27;s &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot;, Rubens&#x27;s &quot;Hygieia and the Sacred Serpent&quot;, Pieter Brueghel the Younger’s &quot;Village in Winter&quot; and Jan Brueghel the Elder’s &quot;St. Martin Dividing His Cloak&quot;. In addition to his own acquisitions, his wives also brought paintings as their dowries. The first, Claudia Franziska von Nassau Hadamar, brought with her portraits from the house of Nassau as well as a series of amateur portraits painted by her mother. The second, Maria Anna von Baden, brought a variety of Northern paintings, including Lucas Cranach the Elder&#x27;s &quot;The Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine of Alexandria&quot; and Cranach the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Jesus and the Woman Taken in Adultery&quot;. Ferdinand August was also the first Prince Lobkowicz to systematically collect musical scores, and was an accomplished lutenist.
* Wenzel Ferdinand (1656–1697), Count of Bílina. As well as being Count of Bílina, a Bohemian town famous for its healing mineral water, Wenzel Ferdinand was an Imperial councillor and chamberlain. He served as an envoy to Bavaria, France, Spain, England, and the Netherlands. While in the Netherlands, he commissioned a Delft service from Lambertus Cleffius – the earliest and largest Delft service still in existence.
* Philip Hyacinth (1680–1734), 4th Prince Lobkowicz, was a patron of the arts who collected musical scores on several journeys to England. The composer Sylvius Leopold Weiss, one of the finest lutenists of his day, taught music to both Philip Hyacinth and his second wife Anna Maria Wilhelmina von Althan, and dedicated several works to the princess.
* Eleonore, Princess Lobkowicz (1682–1741) was the daughter of Ferdinand August, 3rd Prince Lobkowicz. At the beginning of the 18th century, she had the mineral spring at Bílina cleaned, leading to the town becoming a well-known spa. In 1701 she married Adam Franz Eusebius, hereditary Prince von Schwarzenberg, whom Emperor Charles VI killed in a hunting accident in 1732. Subsequently, the Emperor took her son Joseph Adam to his court in Vienna, and she was paid a baronial maintenance of 5,000 gulden.
* Eleonora Carolina (1685–1720), Countess of Bílina. The daughter and sole heir of Count Wenzel Ferdinand, she married her distant cousin Philip Hyacinth, 4th Prince Lobkowicz.
* Johann Georg Christian, Prince of Lobkowicz (1686–1755). A field marshal of the Imperial forces, Georg Christian was the fourth son of Ferdinand August, 3rd Prince Lobkowicz. He commanded the Lobkowicz regiment founded during the Thirty Years&#x27; War by Václav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz, and was commander-in-chief of the Habsburg armies in Italy. The Lobkowicz Collections holds portraits of eighteen officers that served in the Lobkowicz regiment under his command. 
* Ferdinand Philip (1724–1784), 6th Prince Lobkowicz. After Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Silesia during the War of the Austrian Succession, Ferdinand Philip supported Frederick over Empress Maria Theresa of Austria in order to protect his huge and highly profitable Silesian estate, originally acquired by Václav Eusebius, 2nd Prince Lobkowicz. It was probably for this reason that he was one of only two reigning princes of Lobkowicz not to be awarded the Order of the Golden Fleece, the highest Austrian order of chivalry. Wishing to avoid the war in Silesia and Bohemia but unwelcome at the Habsburg court in Vienna, Ferdinand Philip spent much of the 18th century in England, accompanied by Christoph Willibald Gluck, whom he had employed in the Lobkowicz Palace orchestra. He returned to Bohemia with two of Canaletto&#x27;s finest paintings of London. His shrewd protection of his Silesian estate paid off: after his death, it was sold to the Duke of Courland for the incredible (at the time) sum of one million gulden.
* Ferdinand Maria von Lobkowicz (1726-1795), Bishop of Namur and of Ghent. Son of Johann Georg Christian, Prince of Lobkowicz.
* Joseph František Maximilian (1772–1816), 7th Prince Lobkowicz, was a patron of Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Despite the previous Prince of Lobkowicz&#x27;s lack of support for Maria Theresa, Joseph František Maximilian remained on good terms with the Habsburgs: Emperor Joseph II granted him the title of Duke of Roudnice in 1786, and to celebrate the coronation of Emperor Leopold II as King of Bohemia in 1791 he commissioned a reconstruction of the Lobkowicz Palace&#x27;s exterior, giving it the appearance that it retains to this day. A talented singer, violinist, and violoncellist, Joseph František Maximilian was a noted patron of the arts: he was a founding member of the Society of the Friends of Music in Vienna, a member of the Society for the Promotion of Musical Culture in Bohemia, and a director of the Court Theatre of Vienna. He made his greatest impact on the musical world as a patron of Beethoven, who dedicated several major works to him, including the 3rd (&quot;Eroica&quot;), 5th, and 6th (&quot;Pastoral&quot;) symphonies.
* Ferdinand Joseph Johann Nepomuk (1797–1868), 8th Prince Lobkowicz. A notable industrialist as well as a patron of the arts, he was a particular benefactor of the geologist and paleontologist August Emanuel von Reuss. In 1835 he established one of the largest sugar factories in Bohemia, in the town of Bílina. He served as a member of parliament in Bohemia from 1860 to 1863. 
* Karl Johann Josef of Lobkowicz (1815–1879). After having been head of government from 1852 to 1856, he served as a privy councillor in 1857. He was a stadholder in Lower Austria, Moravia, and Tyrol and Vorarlberg in the late 1850s and early 1860s.
* Moric (1831–1903), 9th Prince Lobkowicz. He served as an Imperial Privy Councilor beginning in 1890.
* Georg Christian, Prince of Lobkowicz (1835–1908) was a political leader among the conservative Bohemian nobility. Georg Christian was a member of the Bohemian Diet from 1865 to 1872 and 1883 to 1907, presiding over it twice as Land Marshal of Bohemia. He served as deputy in the Austrian Parliament from 1879 to 1883 and became a hereditary member of the Austrian House of Lords in 1883.
* Ferdinand Zdenko Maria (1858–1938), 10th Prince Lobkowicz. In 1907, he was appointed chamberlain to Archduke Charles, later Charles I of Austria, the last ruler of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
* Wilhelmina(1863–1945) was the daughter of Moric, 9th Prince Lobkowicz. She sponsored a religious institution for widowed and unmarried noblewomen, The Order of the Sisters of God&#x27;s Love, in Nelahozeves Castle.

* Ferdinand Lobkowicz (1885–1953), known as &quot;the Evangelist&quot;. He was the eldest son of Ferdinand Zdenko Maria, 10th Prince Lobkowicz, but renounced his inheritance rights in 1920. His younger brother Maximilian inherited the family&#x27;s properties instead. 
* Maximilian Lobkowicz (1888–1967). Despite the government&#x27;s decision to redistribute inherited property and abolish the use of noble titles, Maximilian provided crucial support to the newly formed, democratic Czechoslovakia as a lawyer and diplomat, campaigning abroad for international recognition of the young republic. In the 1930s he mustered diplomatic support for opposition to the German annexation of the Sudetenland, and during World War II he served as ambassador to Great Britain for the Czechoslovakian government in exile. In 1945 he and his family regained the property that had been confiscated by the Nazis, only to see it seized again in 1948 by the Communist government. At the same time, Maximilian and his family were forced into exile.

<text>Luhansk (, ; , ), also known as Lugansk (, ; , ), is a city in the Donbas in eastern Ukraine. As of 2022, the population was estimated to be making Luhansk the 12th-largest city in Ukraine.

Luhansk served as the administrative center of Luhansk Oblast, before pro-Russian separatists seized control of the city in 2014 and made it the capital of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic. The Ukrainian administration was located in Sievierodonetsk from 2014 to 2022 during the war in Donbas, due to Ukraine not being in control of Luhansk. Sievierodonetsk was captured by Russia in 2022 and Luhansk Oblast was later annexed by Russia in late 2022.

==History==
===Founding and early history===

The city traces its history to 1797 when the British industrialist Charles Gascoigne, commissioned by the Imperial Russian government in 1795, founded an ammunition and cannon factory for the Black Sea Fleet. Gascoigne had emigrated to Saint Petersburg years earlier, and founded factories and mines across the Russian Empire during his time there. There is a prominent bust of him in Luhansk commemorating his role in the city&#x27;s founding.

The factory was built in the Donets Basin (or Donbas) at the confluence of the Luhan and rivers. The Russian craftsmen settled upstream, at the settlement of Kamianyi Brid. The name &quot;Luhansk&quot; comes from the Luhan River, which flows through the city. According to folk etymology, the name is also derived to the word &quot;Luh&quot; (Ukrainian: Луг), which means &quot;meadow&quot;, referring to the floodplains around the river.

The factory was greatly expanded during the Napoleonic Wars, and again during the Crimean War. By 1880, the factory was a large industrial node, linked by rail to other major cities and to the Azov Sea. In 1882, the Luhansk Factory was merged with Kamianyi Brid into a new settlement named Luhansk, which received city status. In 1897, Luhansk had a population of 20,400, 68.2% of whom were Russians.

In summer 1896, German industrialist founded a locomotive-building company in Luhansk, which is now Luhanskteplovoz. It became operational in 1900, and soon produced a large proportion of all locomotives in the Russian Empire.

===In the Soviet Union===
Luhansk was economically devastated by the Russian Civil War. In April 1918, Luhansk was occupied by the Central Powers during their invasion of Ukraine. Then, it was taken by Anton Denikin&#x27;s anti-communist Volunteer Army in May 1919, before changing hands several times. It was finally taken by the Red Army in January 1920.

After the end of the war, the victorious Bolsheviks created the Soviet Union on the territory of the former Russian Empire, and began restoring the city. The city grew rapidly during the interwar period. On 5 November 1935, the city was renamed Voroshilovgrad (; ) in honour of Soviet military commander and politician Kliment Voroshilov. In 1938, Voroshilovgrad Oblast was established, with the city as its center.

The economic recovery and development of the city was also accompanied by significant demographic change. The population grew from 72,000 to 212,000 between 1926 and 1939, and there was an influx of Ukrainians from the countryside into the city. The proportion of Ukrainians grew from 19.1% to 58.7% between 1897 and 1939, many of whom were refugees fleeing the Holodomor, a manmade famine across Soviet Ukraine. The Russian proportion of the population shrank to 34.5%.

Voroshilovgrad became a frontline city in World War II after the failure of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Operation Barbarossa to capture major Soviet cities. In March 1942, a grand concert featuring the work of Taras Shevchenko was held in the city to inspire Ukrainians to fight off the invading Nazis. In July 1942, Germany concentrated its forces in the area and forced the Soviets to retreat to the Volga and the North Caucasus. On 14 July 1942, German troops captured Voroshilovgrad. Locals waged partisan warfare against the occupation. The city was eventually liberated by the Red Army on 14 February 1943.

In the postwar period, the city was rebuilt. The population recovered and grew, again alongside demographic change. More Russians were brought in to rebuild and help with industrialization, again reducing the share of Ukrainians to a minority of 48.3% by 1959 and raising the share of Russians to 47.1%.
On 5 March 1958, after Khrushchev&#x27;s call to not name cities after living people, the old name of Luhansk was reinstated. Kliment Voroshilov himself opposed the restoration of the old name in 1958. In January 1970, after the death of Kliment Voroshilov on 2 December 1969, the city&#x27;s name was changed again to Voroshilovgrad.

Demographic shifts continued during the late Soviet period; by 1989, Ukrainians made up 41.8% of the population and Russians had a majority of 52.4%. On 4 May 1990, a decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR gave the city back its original name.

===Ukrainian independence===

Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1994, a consultative referendum took place in Donetsk Oblast and Luhansk Oblast, with around 90% supporting the Russian language gaining status of an official language alongside Ukrainian, and for the Russian language to be an official language on a regional level.

The previous demographic trends reversed in independent Ukraine; by 2001, Ukrainians - who increasingly spoke Russian - were 50% of the population and Russians made up 47%. The population as a whole began to decline as the economy stagnated, dropping from 505,000 in 1992 to 424,000 in 2014.

====Russo–Ukrainian War====
In April 2014, Russia-backed separatists seized governmental buildings in the region, proclaiming the Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic (LPR), with its capital in Luhansk. An independence referendum, unconstitutional under Ukrainian law, was held on 11 May 2014. This referendum was not recognized as legitimate by any government. These events escalated into the War in Donbas.

In August 2014, Ukrainian government forces completely surrounded rebel-held Luhansk. Heavy shelling caused civilian casualties in the city. On 17 August, Ukrainian soldiers entered the rebel-controlled Luhansk and for a time had control over a police station. A statement released on 22 August by Lithuanian foreign minister Linas Antanas Linkevičius said that the Lithuanian honorary consul in Luhansk, Mykola Zelenec, was abducted by the pro-Russian separatists and murdered. Linkevičius defined the abductors as &#x27;terrorists&#x27;.

After the Ilovaisk counteroffensive, LPR forces regained Lutuhyne and other Luhansk suburbs. Ukrainian forces withdrew from the Luhansk International Airport on 1 September 2014, after heavy fighting. Human Rights Watch reported high civilian casualties in and around the city, recording over 300 civilian deaths caused by explosive weapons between May and September 2014. The temporary administration of Luhansk Oblast was moved to Sievierodonetsk by the government of Ukraine.

On 21 November 2017, armed men in unmarked uniforms took up positions in the center of Luhansk in what appeared to be a power struggle between the head of the republic Igor Plotnitsky and the (sacked by Plotnitsky) LPR appointed interior minister Igor Kornet. Media reports stated that the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, a parallel Russian-backed entity in neighboring Donetsk Oblast, had sent armed troops to Luhansk the following night. Three days later the website of the separatists stated that Plotnitsky had resigned &quot;for health reasons. Multiple war wounds, the effects of blast injuries, took their toll.&quot; The website stated that security minister Leonid Pasechnik had been named acting leader &quot;until the next elections.&quot; 

===== 2022 Invasion and annexation =====
On September 30, 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree declaring the annexation of four regions of Ukraine (Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson, and Zaporizhiya Oblasts) to Russia. The annexation was illegal under international law and was condemned by the General Assembly of the United Nations.

<text>The Catholic Defence Association was an organisation founded in 1851 to defend the rights of Irish Roman Catholic tenant farmers. The first meeting held at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, Dublin was chaired by Lord Gormanston, with MPs William Keogh, George Henry Moore and John Sadleir on the platform. 

Moore owned 5000 ha (50 km²) in Mayo, and 40 ha in County Roscommon. In 1852 Henry Wilberforce became Secretary, living in Ireland for two or three years. As Secretary he engaged in a correspondence on Church of Ireland proselytizing which was published as &quot;Proselytism in Ireland: the Catholic Defence Association versus the Irish Church Missions on the charge of bribery and intimidation; a correspondence between the Rev. Alex Dallas and the Rev. Henry Wilberforce&quot; (1852).

<doc id="1057458" wikidata="Q7359358" url="?curid=1057458" title="Rogers v. Tennessee">
<text>Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451 (2001), was a U.S. Supreme Court case holding that there is no due process violation for lack of fair warning when pre-existing common law limitations on what acts constitute a crime, under a more broadly worded statutory criminal law, are broadened to include additional acts, even when there is no notice to the defendant that the court might undo the common law limitations, so long as the statutory criminal law was made prior to the acts, and so long as the expansion to the newly included acts is expected or defensible in reference to the statutory law. The court wrote, 
In the context of common law doctrines... Strict application of &quot;ex post facto&quot; principles... would unduly impair the incremental and reasoned development of precedent that is the foundation of the common law system.&quot; The decision did not affect the requirement of fair warning placed on statutes passed by legislatures - &quot;The Constitution&#x27;s &quot;Ex Post Facto&quot; Clause... &#x27;is a limitation upon the powers of the Legislature, and does not of its own force apply to the Judicial Branch of government&#x27;... a judicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law [only] violates the principal of fair warning... where it is &#x27;unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.

The case was about a murderer, Wilbert Rogers, who stabbed his victim in the heart, causing the victim to have cardiac arrest and lapse into a coma. The victim was kept alive for fifteen months using modern medical methods. An ancient common law was that if a victim of a crime died more than a year after a criminal act, that act was not considered to be murder, under a justification that medical science was not capable of establishing causation so far beyond the criminal act, whereby there was reasonable doubt as to the cause of death. This was known as the year and a day rule. The rule dated from as far back as the 12th century, and most modern courts that examined the rule found it to be obsolete given modern medical scientific advances. The court wrote, 
At common law, the year and a day rule provided that no defendant could be convicted of murder unless his victim died by defendant&#x27;s act within a year and a day of the act... The Supreme Court of Tennessee... had recognized the... rule... &#x27;was part of the common law [in 1907]... however [in the underlying case involving Rogers], the court found that the original reasons for recognizing the rule no longer exist [at the time of the Rogers homicide].

The Tennessee Supreme Court abolished the rule in the Rogers homicide case, without Rogers having any notice that the rule change would occur. The US Supreme Court held that the Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s abolition of the common-law year and a day rule could apply retroactively to crimes committed before the court abolished the rule under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, so long as there was a statutory criminal law passed prior to the criminal act, and the change in common law interpretation of the statutory law was either expected or defensible in reference to that statutory law. Accordingly, the defendant&#x27;s conviction for murder was sustained on appeal despite the fact that the victim died 15 months after the defendant struck the ultimately fatal blow.

==Facts==
Rogers stabbed James Bowdery with a butcher knife on May 6, 1994. One of the stab wounds penetrated Bowdery&#x27;s heart, and during surgery to repair the wound, Bowdery went into cardiac arrest. Bowdery survived, but due to cerebral hypoxia Bowdery slipped into a coma. Eventually Bowdery developed a kidney infection, from which he died on August 7, 1995, 15 months after the stabbing. The medical examiner ruled the cause of death as cerebral hypoxia &quot;secondary to a stab wound to the heart.&quot;

Rogers was convicted of second-degree murder under Tennessee&#x27;s homicide statute, which does not include the year and a day rule. Rogers appealed to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, arguing that the year-and-a-day rule was part of the common law of Tennessee, despite its absence from the Tennessee homicide statute. The appellate court disagreed, noting that the state&#x27;s Criminal Sentencing Reform Act had abolished all common-law defenses in criminal cases, including the year-and-a-day rule.

Rogers appealed again to the Tennessee Supreme Court. The court held that the common-law year-and-a-day rule survived in Tennessee, but was outmoded. It therefore abolished the rule. Rogers had also argued that abolishing the rule after he had committed his crime would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I of the U.S. Constitution. The Tennessee Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that although judicial decisions can be &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws, retroactive abolition in this case would not offend due process principles because the year-and-a-day rule was so outmoded that a reasonable person would not expect it to exist under modern law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case at Rogers&#x27;s request.

==Majority opinion==
The Court evaluated this case under the rubric of due process rather than the limitations on &quot;ex post facto&quot; lawmaking present in the Constitution. This is so because the Ex Post Facto Clause limits only legislative actions rather than judicial decisions. However, limitations on &quot;ex post facto&quot; judicial decisionmaking are inherent in the notions of due process. For instance, in &quot;Bouie v. City of Columbia&quot;, , the Court had held that due process forbade applying a novel interpretation of South Carolina&#x27;s criminal trespassing statute to a criminal defendant who had no prior warning that the statute might be interpreted in a manner adverse to the defendant.

&quot;Bouie&quot; and subsequent cases applying &quot;Bouie&quot; made clear that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not incorporate the Ex Post Facto guarantee against the states in any particular manner. The rationale of &quot;Bouie&quot; rested on &quot;core due process concepts of notice, foreseeability, and, in particular, the right to fair warning as those concepts bear on the constitutionality of attaching criminal penalties to what previously had been innocent conduct.&quot; Although the set of interests protected by the Due Process Clause might overlap substantially with the set of interests protected by the Ex Post Facto Clauses, to elide the distinction between the two provisions as set forth in &quot;Bouie&quot; would be to ignore the textual differences between the clauses as well as the contextual differences between legislative and judicial lawmaking. Put another way, imposing a strict prohibition against ex post facto lawmaking on common law courts would deprive such courts of the ability to interpret the law in a manner consistent with settled expectations of parties before it who live in the modern world.
Common law courts at the time of the framing undoubtedly believed that they were finding rather than making law. But, however one characterizes their actions, the fact of the matter is that common law courts then, as now, were deciding cases, and in doing so were fashioning and refining the law as it then existed in light of reason and experience. Due process clearly did not prohibit this process of judicial evolution at the time of the framing, and it does not do so today.

Rogers should have anticipated that the year-and-a-day rule might no longer exist under modern circumstances. Thirteenth century medical science was not capable of determining the cause of death beyond a reasonable doubt after a significant amount of time had elapsed following the ultimately fatal blow. For this reason, the year-and-a-day rule served as a kind of limitation period on murder prosecutions. However, as medical science has advanced, forensic scientists have been able to determine the cause of a person&#x27;s death later and later after the fatal event occurs. &quot;For this reason, the year and a day rule has been legislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue,&quot; as the Tennessee Supreme Court observed. This pervasive change in the law should have put Rogers on notice that, although the rule had not been formally abolished in Tennessee, it was clearly moribund in 1994 in American law generally and Tennessee law specifically. Accordingly, it was hardly unexpected and indefensible for the Tennessee Supreme Court, while considering an appeal from Rogers&#x27;s own conviction, to first formally abolish the rule and then to apply that decision retroactively to his own case.

==Dissenting opinion==
Applying his originalist understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause, Justice Scalia concluded that the Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s retroactive application of its decision to remove the year-and-a-day rule from its jurisprudence rendered Rogers&#x27;s conviction for murder invalid. Scalia began with a different premise than the majority—that the Tennessee Supreme Court had changed that state&#x27;s law of murder when it abolished the year-and-a-day rule in Rogers&#x27;s case. If the legislature had abolished the rule, the Ex Post Facto Clause would not allow that abolishment to apply to Rogers&#x27;s case. Why should the fact that it was the state supreme court that abolished the rule make a difference? The process of lawmaking by common-law courts—applying legal principles to novel fact situations—is not interrupted by forbidding them from applying &quot;new&quot; legal principles to &quot;new&quot; factual situations, after all. Scalia thus believed that there was no reason not to apply the Ex Post Facto Clause to &quot;unelected judges&quot; just as it applied to the &quot;elected representatives of all the people.&quot;

What occurred in the present case, then, is precisely what Blackstone said—and the Framers believed—would not suffice [as a rationale of decision by a common-law court]. The Tennessee Supreme Court made no pretense that the year-and-a-day rule was &#x27;bad&#x27; from the outset; rather, it asserted the need for the rule, as a means of assuring causality of the death, had disappeared with time. Blackstone—and the Framers who were formed by Blackstone—would clearly have regarded that &quot;change&quot; in law as a matter for the legislature, beyond the &quot;power&quot; of the court... That explains why the Constitution restricted only the legislature from enacting &quot;ex post facto&quot; laws. Under accepted norms of judicial process [that prevailed in the time of the Framers], an &quot;ex post facto&quot; law... was simply not an option for the courts.

For these historical reasons, Scalia believed, the majority should not have circumvented the strictures of the Ex Post Facto Clause by analyzing what the Tennessee Supreme Court had done under the rubric of due process. &quot;I find it impossible to believe, as the Court does, that this strong sentiment [against ex post facto lawmaking] attached only to retroactive laws passed by the legislature, and would not apply equally to a court&#x27;s production of the same result through disregard of the traditional limits on judicial power.&quot;

Scalia also disagreed with the conclusion that Rogers had had fair warning that the year-and-a-day rule was so moribund as to have been effectively abolished. Other common-law crimes had outmoded elements, and certainly a common-law court could not say those elements no longer existed because the ancient rationale for them had changed—asportation, as an element of common-law larceny, or &quot;breaking the close&quot; as an element of burglary, for instance. (Of course, today this behavior would be subject to punishment under statutory definitions of crimes rather than common-law definitions.) Rogers might have known that the rule was outmoded, but he could not have known that the rule had ceased to exist until the court or the legislature told him so. And although the rule might have had dubious status in Tennessee law, the Tennessee Supreme Court had explained that it was the law, and the Court typically takes such statements at face value. In the absence of any fair warning, as he saw it, Scalia concluded that Rogers&#x27;s conviction for murder was not valid.

<doc id="1057462" wikidata="Q528783" url="?curid=1057462" title="Cormac Murphy-O'Connor">
<text>Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor (24 August 1932 – 1 September 2017) was a British cardinal, the Archbishop of Westminster and president of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales. He was made cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2001. He submitted his resignation as archbishop on reaching his 75th birthday in 2007; Pope Benedict XVI accepted it on 3 April 2009.

By virtue of his position as Archbishop of Westminster, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was sometimes referred to as the Catholic Primate of England and Wales. However, though the holders within the Church of England of the posts of Archbishop of Canterbury and Archbishop of York are called the &quot;Primate of All England&quot; and &quot;Primate of England&quot; respectively, the title of primate has never been used by the &quot;de facto&quot; leaders of the Catholic Church in England and Wales.

== Early life ==
Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was born on 24 August 1932 in Reading, Berkshire, the fifth son of George Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, a G.P., and Ellen (née Cuddigan; died 1971), who emigrated from County Cork in Ireland before the First World War and married in 1921. The Murphy-O&#x27;Connor family was middle class, with the men becoming doctors or priests, and one in each generation taking over the family business as wine merchants &#x27;to the clergy and gentry of Southern Ireland&#x27;. A forebear, Daniel Murphy, became the first Archbishop of Hobart, Tasmania, in 1888, having served as a bishop there since 1865. Two of his uncles, one aunt, two cousins and two of his brothers, Brian (1930–2012) and Patrick, were also ordained or members of religious orders. His youngest brother, John, was a regular officer in the Royal Artillery who died of renal cell carcinoma; he had two other siblings, James (a doctor and rugby player) and Catherine. His cousin, Jerome Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, was a Dominican priest and expert on St Paul who served as Professor of New Testament at the École Biblique in Jerusalem from 1967 to his death in 2013.

After attending Presentation College in Reading and Prior Park College in Bath, in 1950 Murphy-O&#x27;Connor followed his brother Brian to the Venerable English College in Rome and began his studies for the priesthood, where he received a degree in theology. Thereafter, he earned a licentiate in philosophy and a Licentiate of Sacred Theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University. He was ordained on 28 October 1956, by Cardinal Valerio Valeri. For the next decade, he was engaged in pastoral ministry in Portsmouth and Fareham.

== Church career ==

=== Parish priest ===
In 1966, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor became the private secretary to Bishop Derek Worlock of Portsmouth. In September 1970, he was appointed parish priest of the Immaculate Conception church in Portswood, Southampton. Soon afterwards, in late 1971, he was appointed rector of the Venerable English College, his alma mater. As rector, he hosted the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Donald Coggan, on his historic visit to Pope Paul VI in 1977.

=== Bishop ===
On 17 November 1977, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was named Bishop of Arundel and Brighton by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 21 December from Bishop Michael Bowen, with Archbishop George Dwyer and Bishop Anthony Emery serving as co-consecrators. He held important positions among the bishops of Europe and has also been consistently influential in ecumenical work; from 1982 to 2000 he was a co-chairman of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission. In 2000 he was awarded the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, in recognition of his work for Christian unity.

=== Archbishop and cardinal ===

Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was appointed the tenth Archbishop of Westminster, and thus head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, on 15 February 2000; in November of that year he was elected President of the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of England and Wales.

In the consistory of 21 February 2001 he was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria sopra Minerva by Pope John Paul II.

He was appointed to four curial organisations: the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See, the Pontifical Council for the Study of Organisational and Economic Problems of the Holy See, and the Pontifical Council for the Family. He also served on the Pontifical Councils for Culture and for Laity, and was secretary of the &quot;Vox Clara&quot; commission which oversees the translating of liturgical texts from Latin into English.

Murphy-O&#x27;Connor belonged to a group of approximately a dozen like-minded cardinals and bishops – all Europeans – who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, to discuss reforms with respect to the appointment of bishops, collegiality, bishops&#x27; conferences, the primacy of the papacy and sexual morality; they differed among themselves, but shared the view that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was not the sort of candidate they hoped to see elected at the next conclave.

In August 2001, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was created a Freeman of the City of London.

In January 2002, he preached during the Anglican morning service at Sandringham, the first time a Roman Catholic prelate delivered a sermon to an English monarch since 1680. In 2002, in Westminster Abbey, he was the first cardinal to read prayers at an English Royal Funeral Service (for the Queen Mother) since 1509. In 2002 he had his portrait painted for Westminster Cathedral by the artist Christian Furr. In advance of the 2005 papal conclave, where Murphy-O&#x27;Connor served as a cardinal elector, Cardinal Achille Silvestrini told reporters to watch for Murphy-O&#x27;Connor to emerge as a possible new pope.

He was ineligible to participate in the 2013 conclave due to being aged over 80. In a piece for the BBC in the lead up to the 2013 conclave, Murphy O&#x27;Connor recorded his experiences of the 2005 conclave that elected Benedict XVI, remembering as the doors closed to the conclave, &quot;One of us will be going out with a white cassock on&quot;. The cardinal also referenced that he personally had three names in mind for himself in the unlikely event that he was elected as pope, settling on Adrian, Gregory, or Benedict.

On 28 October 2006, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor celebrated 50 years of ordination with a Jubilee Mass in Westminster Cathedral.

=== Retirement ===

Shortly before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor submitted his resignation as Archbishop of Westminster to Pope Benedict XVI, who asked that Murphy-O&#x27;Connor remain in his position &quot;until he chooses otherwise&quot;. On 3 April 2009 Benedict appointed Vincent Nichols as Murphy-O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s replacement. All Murphy O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s predecessors died in office, so he was the first Archbishop Emeritus of Westminster. He lived the remainder of his life in semi-retirement in Duke&#x27;s Avenue, Chiswick, London.

On 30 October 2009, Pope Benedict appointed Murphy-O&#x27;Connor a member of the Congregation for Bishops, a post he held until his 80th birthday. It was unusual to receive such an appointment after retirement.

In June 2010, after the Ryan Report and Murphy Report on the abuses by the Catholic Church in Ireland, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was named along with others to oversee the apostolic visitation of certain dioceses and seminaries. Murphy-O&#x27;Connor was named as the visitor to the Diocese of Armagh and its suffragan sees.

Murphy-O&#x27;Connor, in a speech delivered on 17 May 2012 at Leicester&#x27;s Anglican cathedral, said, &quot;In the name of tolerance it seems to me tolerance is being abolished&quot;. He said:
A friend of Pope Francis, he was a hardliner with regard to sexual child abuse cases. In 2018, the dioceses of Arundel and Brighton, Westminster, Portsmouth and Northampton were put under the so-called &quot;Truth Project&quot;, a government-commissioned investigation which asked the Archdiocese of Westminster to release its files pertaining to the minor victims&#x27;allegations.

Murphy-O&#x27;Connor died of cancer on 1 September 2017 after an extended hospital stay. He was buried under the 10th Station of the Cross in Westminster Cathedral. As he was the 10th Archbishop of Westminster, and also because this station is directly opposite the Chapel of St Patrick, he was buried there in accordance with his wishes due to his Irish connection with County Cork in Ireland.

== Views ==
=== Abuse scandal ===

Murphy-O&#x27;Connor found himself subject to public scrutiny regarding a priest in his diocese when he was Bishop of Arundel and Brighton. During this time it was brought to his attention that a priest, Michael Hill, was a sexual abuser of children. In 2000, when Murphy O&#x27;Connor became Archbishop of Westminster, the case became known to the general public.

Instead of reporting Hill to the police, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor allowed the crime to be covered up and transferred Hill to Gatwick Airport chapel, where the Cardinal believed he would not be able to molest children. In 1997, Hill was convicted as a child molester and jailed for sexually assaulting nine children. After three years in jail, Hill was given another five years for assaulting three other boys.

=== Islam ===
In 2004, the Muslim Council of Britain criticised Murphy-O&#x27;Connor when he said that Muslim leaders were not doing enough to denounce terrorists who carried out attacks &quot;in the name of Allah&quot;, while clarifying that they denounced terrorism.

=== Response to &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; ===
In July 2007, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor welcomed Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s relaxation of restrictions on the use of the 1962 Roman Missal. He said:

When he issued a letter implementing the pope&#x27;s rules to the clergy of his diocese in November, he was criticized in some quarters for requiring parish priests to request permission before Mass could be celebrated in that traditional form.

=== AIDS prevention ===

On 3 December 2006, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor issued a response to a statement made by Prime Minister Tony Blair on World AIDS Day (1 December 2006) in which Blair said, &quot;The danger is if we have a sort of blanket ban from religious hierarchy saying it&#x27;s wrong to do it, then you discourage people from doing it in circumstances where they need to protect their lives.&quot; In response to this Murphy-O&#x27;Connor said,
=== Status of immigrants ===
On 7 May 2007, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor addressed a crowd of undocumented immigrants in Trafalgar Square in support of the Strangers into Citizens campaign, which advocates a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Previously he had commissioned major research on the pastoral challenges migrants present in his parishes, which received widespread press coverage when published as &quot;The Ground of Justice&quot;.

=== Adoption by same-sex couples ===
In early 2007, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor sent a letter to Tony Blair opposing pending regulations extending to same-sex couples the right to adopt on the same basis as different-sex couples. He said that the law would force people to &quot;act against the teaching of the Church and their own consciences&quot; with regard to Catholic adoption agencies and requested an exemption from the law. He continued:
=== Family planning ===
Murphy-O&#x27;Connor denounced contraception and abortion many times. In February 2008 he ordered the board of St John and St Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, a Catholic hospital partly funded by the NHS, to resign because its general practice prescribed the morning-after pill and issued abortion referrals.

In February 2013, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor said that while a radical departure from previous teaching was not likely, it would be &quot;wise&quot; to focus on &quot;what&#x27;s good and what&#x27;s true&quot; about marriage and family life instead. He said:
=== Embryo bill ===
In March 2008, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor joined Cardinal Keith O&#x27;Brien of Scotland in opposing the government&#x27;s proposed embryology bill. The government had instructed its MPs to vote for the bill, which angered some Catholic MPs. Murphy-O&#x27;Connor said &quot;Certainly, there are some aspects of this bill on which I believe there ought to be a free vote, because Catholics and others will want to vote according to their conscience&quot;. The government gave in to the pressure and promised to allow MPs a free vote.

=== Atheism ===
In 2008, Murphy-O&#x27;Connor urged Christians to treat atheists and agnostics with deep esteem, &quot;because the hidden God is active in their lives as well as in the lives of those who believe&quot;. However, in 2009, speaking after Archbishop Vincent Nichols&#x27; installation, he said that a lack of faith is &quot;the greatest of evils&quot;.

=== Iraq War ===
Murphy-O&#x27;Connor opposed the Iraq War.

<text>James E. Rumbaugh (born August 22, 1947) is an American computer scientist and object-oriented methodologist who is best known for his work in creating the Object Modeling Technique (OMT) and the Unified Modeling Language (UML).

== Biography ==
Born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Rumbaugh received a B.S. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), an M.S. in astronomy from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and received a Ph.D. in computer science from MIT under Professor Jack Dennis.

Rumbaugh started his career in the 1960s at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) as a lead research scientist. From 1968 to 1994 he worked at the General Electric Research and Development Center developing technology, teaching, and consulting. At General Electric he also led the development of Object-modeling technique (OMT), an object modeling language for software modeling and designing.

In 1994, he joined Rational Software, where he worked with Ivar Jacobson and Grady Booch (&quot;the Three Amigos&quot;) to develop Unified Modeling Language (UML). Later they merged their software development methologies, OMT, OOSE and Booch into the Rational Unified Process (RUP). In 2003 he moved to IBM, after its acquisition of Rational Software. He retired in 2006.

He has two grown up children and (in 2009) lived in Saratoga, California with his wife, Madeline Morrow.

== Work ==
Rumbaugh&#x27;s main research interests are formal description languages, &quot;semantics of computation, tools for programming productivity, and applications using complex algorithms and data structures&quot;.

In his graduate work at MIT, Rumbaugh contributed to the development of data flow computer architecture. His thesis described parallel programming language, parallel processor computer and a basis for a network architecture, which orients itself at data flow. Rumbaugh made further contributions to Object Modeling Technique, IDEF4, the Rational Unified Process and Unified Modeling Language.

== Publications ==
Rumbaugh has written a number of books about UML and RUP together with Ivar Jacobson and Grady Booch. A selection includes:

* 1975. &quot;A Parallel Asynchronous Computer Architecture For Data Flow Programs&quot;. MIT thesis 
* 1991. &quot;Object-Oriented Modeling and Design&quot;. With others. Prentice Hall, .
* 1996. &quot;OMT insights : perspectives on modeling from the Journal of Object-Oriented Programming&quot;. Foreword by James Coplien.
* 1999. &quot;Unified software development process&quot;
* 2005. &quot;Object-oriented modeling and design with UML&quot;

<text>Hermann Ungar (April 20, 1893 in Boskovice – October 28, 1929 in Prague) was a Czech-Jewish writer (in the German language) and an officer in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

==Biography==
Ungar&#x27;s father, Emil, was a cider maker who served as Mayor of Boskovice. After graduating from the public schools in Brno, Hermann Ungar went to Berlin, where he took courses in Oriental Studies until 1911, followed by legal and philosophical studies in Munich and Prague. After service in World War I, where he sustained serious injuries on the Galician Front, he passed the state examination and received his degree in 1918.

At first, he worked as a lawyer and director of the theater in Cheb, where he also wrote plays. In 1922, he became the (Legation Counselor) at the new Czechoslovak embassy in Berlin. In the same year he married Margarete Weiss (born Stransky). Later he returned to Prague and became the Ministerial Commissioner at the Foreign Affairs ministry. While there, he began to associate with a literary circle that included Franz Kafka, Max Brod and Ernst Weiß.

His writing was becoming successful, so he quit the diplomatic service in 1929, but died not long after, aged only 36, during an appendectomy that had been postponed for too long.

His wife and two sons fled to the UK in 1939. His brother and parents were murdered in Auschwitz in 1942, but his sister was able to escape and went to Tel Aviv. 
His play &quot;Der rote General&quot; was a great success in Berlin in 1928. His second play &quot;Die Gartenlaube&quot; was also a great success but was not performed in Berlin until shortly after his death. These plays have been printed and extensively reviewed. His novels were influenced by expressionism and psychoanalysis and were praised by Thomas Mann, who became a godfather to Ungar&#x27;s son, Tom (born Thomas Michael Ungar). According to a 2012 obituary of Tom (who had changed his name to Unwin), his father &quot;wrote about sex and psychosis in a manner that shocked the establishment&quot;.

<doc id="1057471" wikidata="Q5667368" url="?curid=1057471" title="Harry Blackstone Jr.">
<text>Harry Bouton Blackstone Jr. (June 30, 1934 – May 14, 1997) was an American stage magician, author, and television performer. He is estimated to have pulled 80,000 rabbits from his sleeves and hats.

==Early life==
Blackstone was born in Three Rivers, Michigan, the son of noted stage magician Harry Blackstone Sr. (also known as &quot;The Great Blackstone&quot;). As an infant, he was used as a prop in his father&#x27;s act.

==Career==

In his performances, Blackstone used several of his father&#x27;s tricks and illusions, including the &quot;floating light bulb&quot;, &quot;sawing a woman in half&quot;, and the &quot;dancing handkerchief&quot;. His wife, Gay Blackstone, was his magician&#x27;s assistant, keeping his performances running smoothly onstage and offstage.

Blackstone created four levels (beginner to advanced) of magic kits that were the best selling in the field. In the early 1970s, he promoted a &quot;PF Magic Wedge Kit&quot; on a television commercial for PF Flyers sneakers, and he appeared on several commercials for Jiffy Pop popcorn.
In 1985, on the 100th anniversary of his father&#x27;s birth, Blackstone donated to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. the original floating light bulb – designed and built by Thomas Edison – and the original Casadega Cabinet, used in the &quot;Dancing Handkerchief&quot; illusion. This was the first donation accepted by the Smithsonian in the field of magic.

Blackstone appeared as a guest on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;Donahue&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; and &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot; and 3-2-1 Contact. He also made occasional appearances as the mysterious Dr. Mephisto on the TV soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; and as fictitious magician Marcus the Magnificent on Hart to Hart in 1981. Of his several TV specials, the PBS two-hour special was unique due to the intros by some of The Muppets. Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Backstage with Blackstone&quot; appearances on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Square One TV&quot;, where he used magic tricks to teach mathematics to young people, was one of his favorites. He was a regular host of &quot;ABC Weekend Specials&quot; in the 1980s.

Blackstone designed the illusions used on SeaWorld&#x27;s water show featuring the DC Comics superheroes. They included The Joker cutting Batgirl up into multiple pieces, a variation of a classic multi-box illusion, and the first use in many years of the Jarrett pedestal to vanish Wonder Woman.

Blackstone and his wife Gay created and produced the special effects for &quot;The Magic Summer Tour&quot; for New Kids on The Block, as well as their &quot;No More Games Tour&quot;. He also did special effects for Alice Cooper, Michael Jackson (&quot;The Victory Tour&quot;), Earth, Wind and Fire, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction with Perry Farrell.

During his career, Blackstone toured the U.S. extensively. Notably, his &quot;Blackstone! The Magnificent Musical Magic Show&quot; played in 156 U.S. cities and Broadway at the Majestic Theatre from May 13 to August 17, 1980. It played 118 performances.

Blackstone received the Academy of Magical Arts Magician of the Year Award in 1979 and 1985.

==Death and legacy==
Blackstone lived in Redlands, California. He died on May 14, 1997, in Loma Linda, California at the age of 62 due to pancreatic cancer.

After his death, much of his performance equipment was sold off in two highly publicized auctions held by Sotheby&#x27;s and Darien Julian. Many of the pieces went to collectors scattered around the world, and numerous props have made it into actual shows. Las Vegas performer Scarlett now owns and uses his Topsy Turvy. David Copperfield houses the Tire Vanish (performed by Harry Blackstone Sr.) in his museum of magic. Touring illusionist Aaron Balcom uses the Owen-built Clown Jammer. Washington state performer John Walton uses his menacing Buzz Saw. Dutch illusionist Hans Klok and Darren Romeo perform the famous &quot;Blackstone Floating Light Bulb&quot; illusion under a licensing agreement with Blackstone Magik Enterprises Inc. (It is one of only two magic illusions to be protected as intellectual property.)

The Performing Arts Theater at Redlands East Valley High School is named in his honor.

His third wife and widow, Gay Blackstone, is the former president of The Magic Castle in Hollywood. Their daughter Bellamie is a television producer; Harry and Gay&#x27;s other children include son Harry Bouton Blackstone III.

Gay Blackstone appeared in the season 10 episode 14 &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; episode &quot;Tricky Ricky&quot;, in 2014, and sold a vanishing birdcage prop used by both Harry Sr. and Harry Jr. to Rick Harrison for $2,600.

<text>Finn Erling Kydland (born 1 December 1943) is a Norwegian economist known for his contributions to business cycle theory. He is the Henley Professor of Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He also holds the Richard P. Simmons Distinguished Professorship at the Tepper School of Business of Carnegie Mellon University, where he earned his PhD, and a part-time position at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH). Kydland was a co-recipient of the 2004 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, with Edward C. Prescott, &quot;for their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early years===
Kydland grew up as the eldest of six siblings at the family farm in Søyland, Gjesdal, which is located in the Jæren farming region in Rogaland county, southwestern Norway. He recalls having had a liberal upbringing, his parents not imposing many limitations on their children. Finn Kydland became interested in mathematics and economics as a young adult, after he did some bookkeeping at a friend&#x27;s mink farm.

With a freshly awakened interest in theoretical economics, Kydland earned a BSc from NHH in 1968 and a PhD in economics from Carnegie Mellon in 1973, dissertation: &quot;Decentralized Macroeconomic Planning&quot;, supervised by Edward C. Prescott. After his PhD he returned to NHH as an assistant professor. In 1978 he moved back to Carnegie Mellon as an associate professor. He has been living in the United States since then.

===Scholarship===
Kydland&#x27;s areas of expertise are economics in general and political economy. His main areas of teaching and interest are business cycles, monetary and fiscal policy and labor economics. He joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University in 1977, where he served as a Professor of Economics until 2004, when he became a faculty member of the University of California, Santa Barbara and founded the Laboratory for Aggregate Economics and Finance (LAEF) at this same institution. He is a Research Associate for the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, Cleveland and St. Louis, and a Fellow at the IC² Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. He is also an adjunct professor at the NHH, and has held visiting scholar and professor positions at, among other places, the Hoover Institution and the Universidad Torcuato di Tella in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

===Personal life===
Kydland married Liv Kjellevold in 1968, with whom he had four children: Jon Martin, Eirik, Camilla, and Kari. He is now married to Tonya Schooler.

<doc id="1057486" wikidata="Q2893548" url="?curid=1057486" title="Culture of Aruba">
<text>The culture of [[Aruba]], encompassing its language, music, and cuisine, is diverse and has been influenced by both regional and foreign cultures. One significant foreign influence originates from the Iberian Peninsula, which had a significant impact on the island for approximately 137 years, starting . These influences were characaterized by a strong religious presence, missionary activities, and economic exploitation.

Since 1636, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1621–1648), the Dutch played a crucial role in shaping Aruba&#x27;s identity, driven by their exploratory and mercantile spirit, contributing to the island&#x27;s modern character.

The Aruban tourism industry dates to the 1930s when the first commercial airline landed on Aruba and a guest house was established in Oranjestad. Starting in the early 1960s with the rise of a new wave in the tourism industry and the opening of the first luxury resort, Aruba Caribbean Hotel, a national aspiration arose to become &quot;The little Miami of the Caribbean&quot;. However, this focus on developing a small island tourism economy (SITES or SIDS) led to rapid and uncontrolled expansion of the tourism sector. As consequence, it brought about a range of socio-ecological challenges and disrupted the sociocultural fabric of the island, known internationally as &quot;One Happy Island&quot;.

== Customs and traditions ==
The three Dutch Leeward Islands, Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire, located just off the coast of Venezuela, are among the driest islands in the Caribbean. An example of these economical exploitation in Aruba was deforestation during the Spanish and Dutch colonization, exacerbating significant soil erosion. Due to their advantageous proximity to Venezuela, these islands received supplies of fruit and vegetables. Presently, Aruba imports tropical fruits from United States of America, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and the Netherlands.

=== Cuisine history ===
Antillean cuisine shares similarities with dishes from other Caribbean islands and Venezuela, but it also possesses its own distinct character. Over the course of history, these islands changed ownership multiple times and were inhabited by diverse races, each contributing to the development of the culture, language, music, and food.

==== Arawak diet ====
The original inhabitants, known as the Arawak speaking Caquetios, sustained themselves through simple farming, fishing, and hunting. They cultivated corn and brown beans together, because beans helped maintain the soil&#x27;s fertility. They also grew sweet potatoes, groundnuts, cocoa, and cassava. Their sources of protein included turkey, duck, iguanas, and seafood from the nearby waters. Fruits were readily available.

Upon the arrival of the Spaniards in the Caribbean islands, they recognized the value of crops like corn, cocoa, groundnuts, and peppers. They were introduced to new fruits like papaya, avocado, coconut, guava, and pineapple. Herbs like basil and oregano, used by the indigenous people for flavoring, also caught their attention. The Spaniards learned about annatto (a saffron substitute), allspice, and other seasonings. This blend of indigenous and Spanish influences laid the foundation for the diverse Antillean cuisine.

==== Spanish influence ====
The Arawak people also adopted some of the Spaniards&#x27; food practices, including the use of pork fat. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the indigenous people cooked their food by boiling, steaming, roasting (&quot;barbacoa&quot;, now known as barbecue), or dry-frying on a clay plate (the &quot;comal&quot;). Sometimes, they even ate their food raw. They learned to appreciate the pig as a source of food and how to use its fat for frying. To enhance the flavor, they used &quot;coui&quot;, a sauce made from cassava juice and various types of pepper. They also began using annatto for its red-orange color and were introduced to salt. Other new foods included mango, lemon, and olive, brought by the Spaniards from Asia. Initially, they used honey as a sweetener, but the Spaniards introduced sugar.

==== African influence ====
The African slaves brought to the Caribbean by the Spaniards to work on sugarcane plantations made significant contributions to Caribbean cuisine. One important contribution was the banana, which has become a crucial part of our cuisine.

The indigenous people made flat cakes from cassava or corn, while the Africans introduced or &quot;funge&quot;, similar to Italian &quot;polenta&quot;. Later, the corn flour mash adopted from the indigenous people was also called funchi. Various types of beans and okra (&quot;guiambo&quot;) were also brought to the Caribbean with the slaves.

The black slaves in the Caribbean introduced their cooking methods, including using banana leaves to cook their food. They also brought tools like the &quot;lélé&quot; wooden stirring stick and iron pots for making funchi. Black slaves were given the most economical food by their masters. This typically did not include fresh meat or fish. Instead, they ate salted mackerel or cod, which was affordable and could withstand the tropical heat. Dried fish became a primary source of protein for the slaves. They paired the fish with dishes like funchi or starchy tubers such as yam and sweet potatoes.

After the abolition of slavery, Asian immigrants arrived on other Caribbean islands, bringing with them leafy vegetables like spinach, lettuce, and curds.

In the early seventeenth century, the West India Company acquired the islands that would later form the colony of Curaçao.

==== Dutch and Jewish influence ====
The Dutch introduced cheese, bacon, and various types of beans, such as and peas. Dutch workers who came to work at the oil refineries (Lago Oil and Transport Company and Arend Petroleum Company) brought changes to the local food culture. Before their arrival, most families had two hot meals a day, with the main meal in the afternoon and a lighter one in the evening. With the influence of the oil industry, the evening meal for many people shifted to a simpler bread-based meal. People started to learn about different sandwich fillings and how to use cheese as a sandwich filling. The consumption of potatoes and canned vegetables also became more common.

In the seventeenth century, Sephardic Jews, who had previously migrated from Spain and Portugal and later settled in Brazil, were granted permission by the Netherlands to establish themselves on the islands. They had to leave Brazil during that period. The arrival of these Sephardic Jews, some of whom were affluent, greatly enriched Curaçao&#x27;s cuisine with the finest Spanish and Portuguese culinary influences, giving it a distinct and more refined character compared to other Caribbean islands and South American regions.

One noteworthy aspect was their mastery of combining sweet and sour ingredients, including capers, dried plums, olives, and raisins, in a single dish, which created a unique flavor that required an acquired taste to appreciate. They also introduced the cooking method &quot;au bain marie&quot; to the existing culinary practices.

==== Chinese and Indonesian influence ====
Chinese sailors, originally part of their own oil fleet, decided to settle in Curaçao and opened restaurants, a tradition often seen in Chinese communities worldwide. In the 1970s, the first Chinese restaurants, like Dragon Phoenix in 1971 and Kowloon in 1975, were established in Aruba.

During Second World War, a significant number of Indonesians, mainly Royal Netherlands Navy sailors, stayed in Curaçao. When they left after the war, they left behind dishes like nasi goreng, bami goreng, and satay, which gradually blended into the local cuisine. In 1955, the floating Bali restaurant opened its doors in Aruba.

==== United States of America influence ====
From the Americans stationed here during the Second World War, the local population learned to enjoy Coca-Cola and developed a taste for various bottled soft drinks.

=== Specialities ===

As previously mentioned, many elements commonly associated with the Antilles can also be found in Venezuela and other Caribbean islands, albeit with some variations. Local cuisine often features the use of regional papaya-based hot sauces, locally known as &quot;pica di papaya,&quot; in both accompaniments and cooking.

==== &quot;Ayaca&quot; ====
The &quot;ayaca&quot; is a dough of white corn flour, also known as &quot;masa harina&quot;, sugar, salt, aniseeds, finely grated cheese, butter and milk spread thinly is placed on a banana leaf. A stuffing consisting of stewed chicken and pork, capers, raisins, plums, olives, piccalilli, ham, peeled almonds, celery, parsley, gherkins and chili pepper is placed on top. The banana leaf is closed and made into a small, neat package, which is wrapped in a second leaf and then tied with packing string and boiled in boiling water. The prepared ayacas are then allowed to cool. Shortly before serving, the ayaca is warmed up and eaten stripped of the banana leaves. Ayacas are made and eaten during the Christmas and New Year holidays.

==== &quot;Keshi yená&quot; ====
The &quot;keshi yená&quot; (stuffed cheese) is traditionally a hollowed out red Edam cheese is soaked and then stripped of the red wax layer and filled with a meat or fish filling, including capers, raisins, plums and olives. In a well-fitting form it is then prepared in a bain marie or put in the oven. The heat softens the cheese rind. At the end of the baking time, the keshi yená is turned out onto a plate, after having cooled down a bit, cut like a cake and served. For convenience, instead of the hollowed-out, round Edam cheese, which gives the dish its typical taste and soft pink color, a tin baking sheet is lined with slices of Gouda cheese. Similarly to the ayaca, the keshi yená is often served as an hors d&#x27;oeuvre.

==== &quot;Sancocho&quot; ====

The &quot;sancocho&quot; is a typical example of a soup as a main course. In addition to fresh and salted meat, this dish contains vegetables, plantain, tubers, corn on the cob; and both sweet and regular potatoes.

==== &quot;Sopi mondongo&quot; ====

&quot;Mondongo&quot; is a stewed tripe dish made from the stomachs and hooves of cattle or goat. This stew, like so many other local specialties, is quite expensive. A thinner variant of this is also made, known as &quot;sòpi di mondongo&quot; (tripe soup).

After being thoroughly cleaned and washed with plenty of &quot;lamunchi&quot; (lime), the stomachs are parboiled and cut into small pieces. Capers, raisins, plums, olives and most of the sankocho ingredients are added later and the whole thing is simmered over a low heat. Finally, cognac or sherry is added. Foreign visitors sometimes call the stewed mondongo the &quot;Antillean pepperpot&quot;.

==== &quot;Sopi yambo&quot; ====
The &quot;yambo&quot; dish is a thick hearty okra soup. Yambo can be as simple or rich as one would like. A rich yambo contains cured meat and pig tail, fish, cheese, shrimp and &quot;kalko&quot; (conch meat) paired with funchi. This dish is not popular with many, especially foreigners, due to the slipperiness of the dish.
=== Festivals and celebrations ===

==== &quot;Dera Gai&quot; ====
&quot;Dera Gai&quot; is a traditional celebration in Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire, particularly associated with &quot;Dia di San Juan&quot; (St. John the Baptist Day) on June 24. In the past, it involved lighting bonfires on the eve of St. John&#x27;s day, signaling the upcoming holiday. Bonfires were fueled by the remains of the previous year&#x27;s harvest, a practice symbolizing preparation for the new growing season. Men, fueled by singing and music, used to leap over the flames, but this custom faded due to concerns about fire safety. Nowadays, fires are lit all over the island on St. John the Baptist Day itself.

A persistent belief advises against fishing or swimming on St. John&#x27;s Day due to strong northeast trade winds. In Aruba, the celebration takes the form of Dera Gai, an Aruban harvest festival and cultural event featuring traditional song and dance. Songs were played by violin, guitar, &quot;wiri&quot;, and tambú. The festival includes a unique ritual, historically involving the symbolic burial of a rooster.

In the traditional Dera Gai ritual, a hole is dug, and a rooster is placed inside with only its head protruding often covered with a green or dried Calabash gourd. The rooster symbolizes the betrayal of Jesus Christ by Judas. Participants, blindfolded, attempt to hit rooster encouraged by music and singing. The festivals include symbolic attire with females wearing yellow outfits representing the &quot;kibrahacha&quot; flower (&quot;Tabebuia billbergii&quot;), and males donning black trousers, white shirts, and a yellow tie.

This holidays is widely celebrated, with both pagan and Christian symbols that reflect the influences of the Arawak natives and the Spanish missionaries, respectively. This festival is no longer as widely practiced, nowadays, the rooster is omitted, and only the calabash and a plastic rooster serves as the target for the reenactment.

==== Carnival ====

The Allied victory of World War II was commemorated by a large parade in San Nicolas, consisting largely of Caribbean-English immigrants who came to Aruba to work at the Lago Oil Refinery. The first steel and brass bands debuted a few years later and small parades sprouted here and there. Groups within the Aruban elite have taken up this celebration and expended it further. Aruba Tivoli Club, a private social club, started in 1944 with small celebrations.

In 1955, different clubs and districts came together for the inaugural public Aruba Carnival, featuring the first official Carnival queen. The traditional Grand Parades were introduced in 1957. On November 11, 1966, at 11:11 am, the &quot;Stichting Arubaanse Carnaval (SAC)&quot;, the organization responsible for Carnival, was established. The Carnival season officially commences at this exact moment each year. Since 1981, Tivoli has been producing the Lighting Parade, a nighttime parade. Carnival begins with a small &quot;Fakkeloptocht&quot; (torchlight parade) that symbolizes the start of the Carnival season. This parade takes place on the first Saturday after New Year.

Every year, Carnival (the big parade) is celebrated on a different date. The timing of Carnival is determined by Easter Day. Easter Sunday, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the beginning of Spring, sets the date for the first day of Carnival day. To find the first Carnival Day, you count back seven weeks or 47 days before Easter. Carnival officially kicks off on a Sunday. Easter can fall as early as March 22 or as late as April 25. As a result, Carnival is celebrated between February 1 and March 7. Following Carnival, there&#x27;s Ash Wednesday, marking the start of Lent, a 40-day period during which people abstain from eating meat or animal products. These 40 days provide an opportunity for the body to detoxify. After following. Following the period of fasting, Easter arrives.

==== New year ====
The New Year celebration in Aruba also includes a cultural tradition known as &quot;Dande&quot;. The name Dande, derived from the Papiamento word &quot;dandara&quot;, meaning &quot;to revel, to carouse, or to have a good time&quot;, reflects the festive spirit of the occasion. The celebration originated after King William III of the Netherlands declared slaves to be free.

Typically, a group of five or six people, though more can join, engages in these rituals. Accompanied by a singer, they go door-to-door, offering New Year&#x27;s wishes through repetitive songs. The chorus includes the phrase &quot;ai nobe&quot;, meaning &quot;new year&quot;, sung after each phrase. The celebratory journey usually leads them to the homes friends and family, where the host collects money in his a hat to give to the group. In some regions, specific dande groups may perform on the second day of the year.

== Society ==

=== Nationality ===
Central Bureau of Statistics indicate that in 2022, the population of Aruba consists of individuals from 138 different countries and represents 99 different nationalities. Nearly two-thirds (64.4%) of the population of Aruba are born in Aruba or the former Netherlands Antilles, 9.7% are born in Colombia, 5.4% in Venezuela, 4.6% in the Dominican Republic, and 4.5% in the Netherlands.

=== Superstition and pagan beliefs ===

The origins of beliefs and superstitions in Aruba can be traced back to pre-Columbian times when indigenous peoples inhabited the island. However, after 1820, when the indigenous population disappeared, their cultural heritage and beliefs were lost. Subsequently, with the arrival of African slaves during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, some African beliefs and superstitions became integrated into the culture, known as &quot;Brujería&quot; or &quot;Brua.&quot; An example of a superstition that aligns with the pagan belief of Brua is &quot;ojada or hojada&quot;, which is equivalent to the belief in the evil eye. Children, especially newborns, are the most vulnerable and should be protected against the ojada. Bracelets made from &quot;Abrus precatorius&quot;, locally known as &quot;Bonchi hojada&quot; (&quot;Bean of hojada&quot;), are worn as amulets for protection against bad spirits.

=== Music ===

==== Origin of musical styles ====
The current Aruban population is the product of cultural and racial blending, evident in the diverse influences shaping Aruban music. Little is known about the music of the initial indigenous inhabitants. Aruban music is often seen as a creation of the later island residents. This unique musical style, rooted in the blend of rhythms from various cultures, embodies the distinct characteristics. It features its own rhythm and vitality—sometimes melancholic, usually cheerful, occasionally turbulent yet relaxing, predominantly romantic, and expressive. Notably, Aruban music carries discernible traces of the following influences:Here, distinctions are made in Aruban musical styles:I. African origin (melody, form, and rhythm)II. European origin (melody, form and rhythm)III. Caribbean and South American origin (melody, form, and rhythm)IV. Hybrid formsV. Aruban music crafted for particular instruments
==== Musical styles ====
The Aruban waltz, exemplified by the national anthem &quot;Aruba Dushi Tera&quot;, originates from Europe. It&#x27;s characterized by the unmistakable three-fourths beat of the Viennese waltz. Through rhythm variations within the bar (syncope), the Aruban waltz gains its distinctive flexibility and character, setting it apart from Viennese or Curaçaoan waltzes.

Other European-inspired music styles include the Danza, which also has roots in Europe and is known in places like Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. The mazurka, an original Polish dance with a three-fourths rhythm accented on the second beat. Lastly, the Bolero, originally Spanish, with a clear four-four measure, probably arrived in Aruba through Cuban labor migration.

Waltz and Bolero, alongside the Tumba and Merengue, play a vitol roles in the vibrant music legacy shaped by the pioneers of Aruban culture, such as composer and pianist Padu Lampe, renowned as Padu del Caribe, and Victor Camacho. Noteworthy musical groups like &quot;Placentero Ritmo y Cuerda&quot; and Vicente Kelly have also made significant contributions to this vibrant musical tradition. An Aruban singer and composer, , is widely acknowledged as the mother of Aruban culture.

Tumba holds a place in the ABC islands similar to what merengue does in the Dominican Republic, calypso in Trinidad, and son in Cuba. Originally a two-part dance set to a 2/4 time signature (now often in 6/8), Tumba, at the dawn of the 20th century, served as a vehicle for songs of satire and ridicule. What was once a means for the community to convey gossip through song has evolved to nurture professional songwriters.

In 1971, Tumba was officially designated as the national style for the annual Carnival Road March and Tumba festival. Much like Trinidad, Curaçao, and Aruba, these celebrations include competitions to crown the &quot;E Rey di Tumba&quot; (King of Tumba). The festivities begin with lively parades and jump-up events. The finals are broadcast throughout the entire island group, with live radio connections to the Netherlands, allowing the vast Antillean community to cheer for their favorite performers.

==== Tradition and modernity in Aruban music ====
In Aruban music, a fusion of tradition and modernity has emerged, by musicians like Ivan Jansen, Delbert Bemabela, Ivan Quandus, and Cuban saxophonist Eduardo Proveyer. This blend seamlessly incorporates traditional Aruban rhythms such as danza, waltz, merengue, tumba, and steelpan music into a modern cross-over genre, giving rise to Aruban &quot;Crioyo Jazz&quot;. Described by Jansen as &quot;a fusion of Caribbean rhythms and adventurous jazz improvisations&quot;, this musical direction has gained popularity, exemplified by events like the Caribbean Sea Jazz Festival (which concluded in 2019).

Notable bands like Oreo, BMW, and Basic One play a crucial role in preserving the Afro-Caribbean musical tradition introduced by Caribbean migrants in the first half of the twentieth century. The younger generation of musicians, including professionals, semi-professionals, and amateurs, infuse rock, reggae, rock, and hip-hop into the evolving Aruban musical landscape. Aruban musical landscape. The heightened interest in South American rhythms like Vallenato, spurred by increased migration in the 1990s, has further diversified the local musical scene. As Aruban music extends its global reach, it embraces diverse styles, from classical and funk to Latin jazz, rock, reggae, and hip-hop.

=== Cinema ===

The CineAruba foundation, established in 2010, strives to supports the sustainable growth of the local film industry by providing multidisciplinary workshops, producing original feature-length movies and short films, and promoting cultural awareness. CineAruba&#x27;s endeavors have garnered 5 film awards and facilitated 28 international screenings. &quot;Abo So&quot; (2013) stands out as Aruba&#x27;s inaugural feature-length movie and musical, featuring music from Padu del Caribe. The film explores identity and examines how different ethnicities in Aruba interact and handle prejudice. Original content from CineAruba also includes three narrative short films, including &quot;10 Ave Maria&quot; (2011), &quot;Awa Brak&quot; (2012), and &quot;Alto Vista&quot; (2015). Aruba&#x27;s first five-episode fictional television series, &quot;Ciudad Oraño&quot;, premiered in 2018 and was broadcast on Telearuba 13. Events such as Playa Film Festival, Shortcutz Aruba, and Rooftop Film Club, and 48 Hour Film Project Aruba promote cultural diversity of the Caribbean, provide a platform for emerging talent, offer an open-air cinematic experience, and host an annual 48-hour film competition, respectively.

=== Visual arts ===
The inaugural Art Fair in September 2016 marked the beginning of Aruba&#x27;s street art scene, with San Nicolas emerging as the focal point. The Main Street of San Nicolas features vibrant art murals created by both local talents and renowned international artists.

== Sports ==

=== Football ===
Football (or Soccer) is the dominant sport on the island. Many football pitches (fields) are available for the youth to practice this sport. The Aruba Football Federation is currently the governing organization. The Aruba national football team has also participated in many International events.

=== Baseball ===
In the 1930s, baseball on Aruba was initially limited to United States expatriates residing in the colony and working for Lago. Jim Bluejacket played a pivotal role in boosting the game&#x27;s popularity within the colony. Beyon the colony, the introduction of baseball to Aruba was facilitated by Venezuelan immigrants and sailors on Venezuelan fishing boats, with notable figures like Felix Garrido, the grandfather of Evelyn Wever-Croes, contributing to its spread. The Amateur Baseball Bond of Aruba (ABBA) was established in 1950, and Aruba became a member of the International Amateur Baseball Association by 1952. The Little League has notably produced five players who reached the major leagues: Calvin Maduro, Gene Kingsale, Radhames Dykhoff, Sidney Ponson, and Xander Bogaerts.

<text>Motru () is a city in Romania, Gorj County. It is situated on the river Motru and its tributary, the river Ploștina, in western Oltenia. The county capital Târgu Jiu is located about northeast. The city administers eight villages: Dealu Pomilor, Horăști, Însurăței, Leurda, Lupoița, Ploștina, Roșiuța, and Râpa.

== History ==
The region has been inhabited since at least the time of the Roman Empire, attested by the discovery of some silver coins from the era of Emperor Septimius Severus (193–211) in Leurda in 1964.

The Dacian town Amutria is also mentioned in ancient sources like Ptolemy&#x27;s Geographia (c. 150 AD) and Tabula Peutingeriana (2nd century AD), and potentially placed here. The name is homonymous with the ancient name of the Motru River. After the Roman conquest of Dacia, Amutria was part of an important road network, between Drubetis and Pelendava. A settlement and a Roman castrum were discovered in archeological digs near the village of Valea Perilor in the Cătunele commune, close to the road between Motru and Baia de Aramă. The Roman road connecting to Drobeta on the Motru valley was also identified in Cătunele.

The oldest documented settlement in the territory of the present-day city is Ploștina (mentioned as &quot;Ploștină&quot; in the chrysobulls granted to Tismana in 1385 and 1444). Until 1863, the village belonged to the estate of the Tismana monastery with the monks collecting the tithe from the land. From 1863 on, the estate was administered by the state. For three years, the estate was also leased to Tudor Vladimirescu, and the inhabitants of this area participated in the uprising of 1821 as well.

Two villages incorporated into the present-day city, Roșiuța and Lupoița, were inhabited by free farmers who owned their own plots of land.

=== Present ===
The present city of Motru was established by an administrative decision on 24 May 1966 on the territory of the former Ploștina commune. Seven other villages became part of the new city. The reason behind the decision was the development of several coal deposits. Motru was declared a municipiu in 2000. Mining is the city&#x27;s main industry; agriculture and livestock are also important, especially in its attached villages.

In 1981, Motru was the site of riots from miners who were working in the mines of the city. The riots, which took place between 17 and 19 October of that year, were triggered by poor work conditions, tight control of legislative organizations and the general exhaustion of the miners, further exacerbated by a decree that limited consumption of bread only to the dwellers of the city. During the riots, Emil Bobu visited the city, where he was attacked by angry crowds with potatoes; when he returned to Bucharest, he ordered the army to intervene in the city after 2 days of protests from the local populace. At the time, the inexpensive Motru bread attracted many workers and farmers into the city, who carried the bread loafs in sacks and arrived in the town by local trains known as &quot;trains of hunger&quot;. Nowadays the bread factory is in ruins.

== Demography ==
According to the 2021 census, Motru had a population of 15,950 of which 13,626 Romanians, 14 Hungarians, 107 Roma, 4 Italians, and 7 of other ethnicity. In 2011, the population was 18,142, including 17,988 Romanians, 38 Hungarians, 83 Roma, and 3 Germans.

== Transportation ==
Motru is the terminus of a railway line that branches off the CFR main line Bucharest–Craiova–Lugoj at Strehaia, which was put into operation in 1962. In addition, there are bus connections with the county seat of Târgu Jiu. Motru is on the National Road from Drobeta-Turnu Severin to Râmnicu Vâlcea.
