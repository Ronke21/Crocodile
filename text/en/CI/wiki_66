<text>2raumwohnung (; meaning &quot;2-Room Apartment&quot;) are a German electro-pop duo that was formed in 2000 in Berlin. Its two members are singer, Inga Humpe, and her life partner, Tommi Eckart. They reached the high point of their career to date with the album &quot;36 Grad&quot; (&quot;36 Degrees&quot;), which remained in the German music charts for a total of 33 weeks. Their most successful single has been the album&#x27;s eponymous title song. 2raumwohnung have also appeared internationally, e.g. at Expo 2010 and as a DJ team. The band releases its music on their own record label &quot;it-sounds&quot;.

== History ==
2raumwohnung first met in East Berlin where they both settled shortly after German reunification in 1990. The band&#x27;s first appearance was in &quot;Sternradio&quot; in 2001, a legendary club at Alexanderplatz. Before their formation as a band, the duo had been collaborating as a studio project, releasing their music under a pseudonym.

Recordings from that period were used in advertisements, such as for Imperial Tobacco&#x27;s &quot;Cabinet&quot; brand (&quot;Wir trafen uns in einem Garten&quot; (&quot;We Met in a Garden&quot;)) and for HypoVereinsbank. The latter used the song &quot;2 von Millionen von Sternen&quot; (&quot;Two Out of Millions of Stars&quot;) as a jingle in a TV advertisement for the introduction of the Euro, although the wider public remained unaware of the song&#x27;s performers at that point in time.

The group released its debut album under the title &quot;Kommt zusammen&quot; (&quot;Come Together&quot;) on 2 July 2001. It included a total of 13 songs and was ultimately released by Goldrush on the record label BMG. The reviews were mostly positive and ranged from a &quot;new feeling of lightness&quot; to &quot;esoteric children&#x27;s disco&quot;. Due to successful sales, a remixed version of &quot;Kommt zusammen&quot;, which combined house and electro elements, was also produced in January 2002. &quot;In wirklich&quot; (&quot;In Real&quot;) appeared in September of the same year and furthered the band&#x27;s success that had been established with the debut album. Although some critics felt it was lacking the characteristic charm of their previous album, it nevertheless quickly rose to #5 in the German charts. 2raumwohnung had the following to say during the release of &quot;In wirklich&quot;:

&quot;In wirklich&quot; earned 2raumwohnung the German Dance Award for &quot;Best Album&quot;. Their next album, &quot;Es wird Morgen&quot; (&quot;It Will Be Tomorrow&quot; / &quot;It Will Be Morning&quot;), soon followed in August 2004, contained twelve songs and was sold in three different CD editions. Reviewers felt the songs echoed the musical stylings of the &#x27;80s. Reviewers also felt that 2raumwohnung exhibited an impressive musical maturity, even though a certain lack of relevance was simultaneously mentioned. The record was performed live on tour throughout Germany and various neighboring European countries, with Jansen and Kowalski appearing as the opening act. The summer album, &quot;Melancholisch schön&quot; (&quot;Melancholically Beautiful&quot;), followed in 2005 and featured twelve of the band&#x27;s most well-known songs, which were re-recorded and remixed in Bossa Nova style. The album included &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;, a single that had been previously released on &quot;Kommt zusammen&quot;, where it had become somewhat popular nationwide. In 2005, 2raumwohnung also received the Goldene Stimmgabel for &quot;Best Duo&quot;.

In February 2007, following after a short break, 2raumwohnung composed two singles with Peter Plate from Rosenstolz and producer Ulf Leo Sommer for the album &quot;36 Grad&quot;. With the first single, &quot;Besser geht&#x27;s nicht&quot; (&quot;It Can&#x27;t Get Any Better Than This&quot;), the duo made it into the top thirty of the German charts for the first time. The song was also featured in an AOK commercial. The second single, &quot;36 Grad&quot; (&quot;36 Degrees&quot;), was even more successful and placed directly in the top ten of the charts. It became a massive summer hit in 2007 and continues to be frequently played during the summer on national radio. Inga Humpe compared the song to George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, stating that it has maintained its summer popularity throughout the years, with ongoing possibilities of re-recordings and remixes. One such re-recording of &quot;36 Grad&quot; was produced in 2008 for the record Rhythms del Mundo, in which 2raumwohnung collaborated with Cuban musicians. Other German bands featured on this record included Rosenstolz, Culcha Candela, Ich + Ich and Jan Delay.

&quot;36 Grad&quot; has been 2raumwohnung&#x27;s most commercially successful album to date, entering the charts on #7 and reaching #63 in the 2007 year end charts. Various remixes of the album&#x27;s songs were produced with Paul van Dyk and Oliver Huntemann, among others. During the summer of 2007 and leading up to the tour for &quot;36 Grad&quot;, it became known that Inga Humpe and Tommi Eckart were planning to live separately from each other. At that time, they were still living together in Berlin&#x27;s Mitte district. Both artists spoke publicly about their age and the necessary distance without which their creativity was at risk. The tour covered a total of 17 cities, including Berlin, Cologne and Munich, as well as Vienna und Zürich. 2raumwohnung subsequently released a live &quot;36 Grad&quot; video DVD that included both the entire concert at Berlin&#x27;s Columbia Hall as well as performances from 2003 to 2005.

Although a new record was not released in 2008, &quot;Lasso&quot; finally came out in August 2009. The name was chosen with reference to Orlando di Lasso. The album contained a total of 13 songs, including the singles &quot;Wir werden sehen&quot; (&quot;We Will See&quot;) and &quot;Rette mich später&quot; (&quot;Save Me Later&quot;). Although Lasso could not quite match the success that &quot;36 Grad&quot; had acquired, reviewers saw the album as an expression of &quot;Berliners&#x27; sense of and approach to life in understandable musical language&quot;. Inga Humpe admitted in an interview that the urban jungle has significantly influenced &quot;Lasso&quot;. 2raumwohnung also went on tour with the album (Lasso Tour 2009), along with German-American-Persian musician Malakoff Kowalski. Furthermore, a remix album of Lasso appeared in 2010, in collaboration with Paul Kalkbrenner, Blake Baxter and Abe Duque, among others.

In 2010, 2raumwohnung had two guest appearances in the television soap opera GZSZ. The episodes were aired on February 12 and 15, with 2raumwohnung performing both &quot;36 Grad&quot; and &quot;Rette mich später&quot; in the so-called &quot;Mauerwerk&quot;. The appearance helped promote the new album and the following tour. In addition to television, 2raumwohnung have also found their way into contemporary German literature: specifically, in Oliver Bendel&#x27;s &quot;Nachrückende Generationen&quot; (&quot;Coming Generations&quot;). In the novel, there is a scene of a boy dancing to the song &quot;Wir sind die anderen&quot; (&quot;We Are The Others&quot;). In addition, the band received the &quot;Kulturpreis&quot;-award (a cultural award) by Berliner Zeitung in January 2010. In 2011, 2raumwohnung played Gustav Mahler&#x27;s 5th Symphony together with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony conducted by the composer Moritz Eggert. The purpose of this collaboration, called &quot;Music Discovery Project&quot;, aimed to merge different musical worlds.

On 6 September 2013 the album &quot;Achtung fertig&quot; (&quot;Ready Set&quot;) was released. It was produced in Los Angeles, among other places, and the first single &quot;Bei dir bin ich schön&quot; (&quot;With You I&#x27;m Beautiful&quot;) was released in August of the same year. During the release of the album, the song &quot;Ich mag&#x27;s genau so&quot; (&quot;I Like It Just Like That&quot;) was provided as a free download. The videos for these two songs were shot by actor Henning Gronkowski. In October and November 2013 and in March 2014, 2raumwohnung went on tour with &quot;Achtung fertig&quot; throughout Germany, Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The concerts received mixed reviews by critics.

=== Inga Humpe ===
Humpe grew up in Herdecke on the Ruhr, where her parents owned a pastry shop. After graduating from high school, she began her studies in Art History and Comparative Literature at the RWTH Aachen in 1975. The following year, she switched to the Free University of Berlin. Occasionally she attended acting courses at the &quot;Max Reinhardt School&quot;. Following her first musical projects, she founded the punk band &quot;Neonbabies&quot; in the late 1970s, in which she was active as a singer until 1983. Humpe became known to a larger public as a member of the group DÖF with their hit &quot;Codo&quot;. In the second half of the 1980s she recorded two albums in a duo with her sister Annette Humpe.

=== Tommi Eckart ===
Eckart was born in West Berlin and spent parts of his childhood in Munich. Together with colleagues, he founded the punk band &quot;Alternative Arschlöcher&quot;. His collaboration with Andreas Dorau began in the late 1980s and lasted into the 1990s. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Eckart moved to East Berlin, where he lived in a former wiretapped apartment of the Ministry of State Security. In 1992, he and Ralf Hertwig from Palais Schaumburg founded the trance projects &quot;Transform&quot; and &quot;Perry &amp; Rhodan&quot;, releasing the single &quot;The Beat Just Goes Straight On &amp; On&quot; (Rising High Records) in 1993, among others. Eckart also worked with Klaus Löschner.

== Miscellaneous ==
In April 2008, 2raumwohnung and about 200 other artists signed an open letter of the German Music Industry Association to chancellor Angela Merkel, which was published in the Süddeutsche Zeitung and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspapers, among others. In the letter they argued in favor of increased protection of intellectual property, which was being prejudiced by file sharing in particular. In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, 2raumwohnung and other artists initiated another open letter and a held a vigil in front of the Federal Chancellery, with the aim of phasing-out nuclear power without delay.

2raumwohnung have repeatedly represented German music at major international events, such as a concert on the German National Day at Expo 2010 in Shanghai, along with other artists such as Nobelpenner and Konrad Chef. In June 2010, at the invitation of the Goethe Institute and the German Embassy in Pretoria, 2raumwohnung were guests at the FIFA World Cup 2010 in South Africa. They appeared together with Frank Dellé at the &quot;Soccer Meets Culture&quot; event.

The pseudonym 2raumwohnung was developed due to the fact that the two artists did not want to be associated with music for commercials. Working in this field was frowned upon in certain circles. The duo initially used the spelling &quot;Zweiraumwohnung&quot;, but later changed this since the corresponding domain had already been registered.

2raumwohnung have been active throughout their career as a DJ team, appearing in New York City among other cities. In 2008, they played as part of Moguai &amp; Friends at Weststadthalle in the city of Essen, and on Munich&#x27;s Praterinsel during the &quot;Smirnoff Experience&quot; in 2003 (also with Moguai).

<doc id="1066856" wikidata="Q2333535" url="?curid=1066856" title="Johnny the Fox">
<text>Johnny the Fox is the seventh studio album by Irish hard rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1976. This album was written and recorded while bassist/vocalist Phil Lynott was recovering from a bout of hepatitis that put him off the road halfway through the previous &quot;Jailbreak&quot; tour. &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot; was a British hit single. &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; was the last Thin Lizzy studio album on which guitarist Brian Robertson featured as a full member of the band, as the personality clashes between him and Lynott resulted in Robertson being sacked, reinstated, and later sacked again.

==Recording==
Once Lynott had returned to the UK from the aborted US tour in June 1976, when the band had been scheduled to support Rainbow, he spent time in hospital in Manchester recovering from hepatitis. He had an acoustic guitar with him and wrote the songs for &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; during June and July, with one outing to play a gig at Hammersmith Odeon on 11 July. After his release from hospital, Lynott joined the other members of the band and travelled to Munich, Germany in August to record the album at Musicland Studios with producer John Alcock. Alcock has said that the decision to record outside the UK was for tax reasons.

Early in the recording process, it became clear that neither the band nor the production team were happy with the studios or the recording process, and they experienced particular trouble obtaining a satisfactory drum sound. Lynott was still finishing the songwriting and, according to Alcock, the band were arguing about musical direction. On 6 August, they abandoned the sessions and returned to Ramport Studios in Battersea (where the previous &quot;Jailbreak&quot; album had been recorded), and Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. Brian Robertson has said that there was plenty of material from which to choose for the album, up to eight or nine tracks apart from the ten that appeared on the final release. However, Alcock claims that the album suffered because Lynott needed more time to finish the songs, and that some tracks, like &quot;Boogie Woogie Dance&quot;, were not strong enough to make the album.

===Songs===
Lynott and Robertson clashed over musical differences, such as the composition of &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot;. When Lynott first played the song in a slow 12-bar blues format, Robertson claimed it was &quot;shite&quot;, and Lynott reacted badly, disappearing for a few days. Robertson then felt that he may have been a little harsh, and he and drummer Brian Downey decided to rework the song. Downey devised a faster shuffle rhythm and Robertson wrote the riff, and Lynott was pleased with the outcome when he returned to the studio. Robertson was annoyed when the song was credited solely to Lynott, as he felt that all three members involved should have been credited. The original bluesy arrangement was subsequently recorded by Lynott and Gary Moore on Moore&#x27;s &quot;Back on the Streets&quot; in 1978, and Thin Lizzy versions later appeared on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s 1983 double live album &quot;Life&quot; and the deluxe edition of &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;.

Robertson also co-wrote &quot;Borderline&quot; with Lynott, for which he did receive a writing credit. He later revealed that the song was about a girlfriend: &quot;I was really in love, [but] she hated me. I was extremely down when I wrote it.&quot; Alcock confirmed that Robertson had significant lyrical input on this track, and that the band&#x27;s other guitarist Scott Gorham had similar influence on the lyrics for &quot;Sweet Marie&quot;.

According to Robertson, Lynott wrote &quot;Rocky&quot; with him in mind. John Alcock has stated that &quot;Massacre&quot; was written in the studio. Its lyrics came after Lynott was visited in hospital by a Protestant clergyman, and Catholic Lynott became defensive. Later he regretted his reaction, and wrote the lyric condemning religious prejudice.

&quot;Fools Gold&quot; was inspired by the Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–52. The lyric imagines Irish people travelling to America to escape the famine and start a new life.

The album included two tracks with the name &quot;Johnny&quot; in their titles as well as the album title itself, a character by that name having appeared in earlier songs such as &quot;Showdown&quot; and &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;. Gorham noted the name&#x27;s proliferation: &quot;Phil should&#x27;ve been this guy&#x27;s publicity agent, as he was cropping up everywhere!&quot;

&quot;&#x27;Johnny the Fox meets Jimmy the Weed&#x27; was really the only song that Lizzy did in a funk style…&quot; noted Scott Gorham. &quot;Phil Lynott was a huge fan of The O&#x27;Jays and their song &quot;For the Love of Money&quot;. At every soundcheck, he&#x27;d be playing that funky riff… Once we&#x27;d found that riff, we just went for it. The whole thing really took off when Brian Downey sat down and put his personal funk take on it with the drums… And these characters – Johnny the Fox and Jimmy the Weed – they were real people. They were from the Manchester area, where Phil&#x27;s mom had her hotel… They were part of a gang of cultured thieves… They weren&#x27;t drug dealers, like it says in the lyrics for the song… But they were pretty heavy guys, yet they were real funny, so you couldn&#x27;t help but like them.&quot;

===Backing musicians===
Phil Collins of Genesis was brought in to contribute some percussion to one or more tracks, seemingly because he was a friend of Lynott&#x27;s. Robertson later said, &quot;Collins was just a mate of Phil&#x27;s... I think Phil probably just wanted to get him on the album to name-drop.&quot; Neither Robertson nor Downey was able to remember which songs Collins played on.

Irish musician Fiachra Trench provided string arrangements, for example on &quot;Sweet Marie&quot;, on which he used one bank of violins and two viola sections. Trench also contributed a brass arrangement to &quot;Johnny&quot;, while Kim Beacon of String Driven Thing sang backing vocals. Again, none of the band members could recall which song(s) Beacon appeared on. Robertson claimed that Beacon was only used because Frankie Miller was unavailable.

==Album cover==
Thin Lizzy used their usual cover artist, Jim Fitzpatrick, to design the sleeve for &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;, but he was asked to provide the finished design before the album was given a title. When Lynott asked him for something Celtic, but not the usual kind of Celtic rock design, Fitzpatrick drew a complicated neo-gothic Celtic border with a disc in the centre, left blank for the title and central design. When the deadline was approaching and he grew desperate to finish it, he asked Lynott for any idea of a title to inspire him. Lynott replied, &quot;Ah, call it &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;, that&#x27;ll do.&quot; Fitzpatrick reminded him that there was no track with that title on the album, and Lynott replied, &quot;No-one will notice, Jim. The album will be massive.&quot; Fitzpatrick subsequently drew the fox design and added the title. An idea of a cut-out with the fox&#x27;s head showing through was rejected by the record company.

An earlier Fitzpatrick design had the same border with the figure of a warrior in the centre, but both Lynott and Fitzpatrick felt that the fox represented a sort of &quot;outsider&quot; character, much like the panther on the cover of Thin Lizzy&#x27;s 1974 album, &quot;Nightlife&quot;.

==Album release and tour==
&quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; was released in October 1976, and reached No.11 in the UK charts. The single &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot; reached No.12 in the UK and No.2 in Ireland. Thin Lizzy toured the UK during October and November, supported by American band Clover, led by Huey Lewis. The tour was successful enough that an extra date was added at the Hammersmith Odeon in November. There was also a successful appearance on Rod Stewart&#x27;s BBC TV show in the UK, where Thin Lizzy upstaged their host by playing live, whereas Stewart mimed.

The tour was scheduled to continue in the US in late November, but was cancelled after Robertson suffered a hand injury in a fight at the Speakeasy Club in London. Robertson&#x27;s friend Frankie Miller was about to be attacked with a glass bottle by the Gonzalez guitarist Gordon Hunte, and Robertson tried to intervene. The bottle cut his hand, badly damaging an artery and a nerve, preventing him from playing guitar effectively for several months. The tour was postponed until January 1977, when Thin Lizzy began a three-month US tour opening for Queen with Gary Moore standing in for Robertson.

==Reception==

Harry Doherty of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, comparing the album to &quot;Jailbreak,&quot; wrote that there was &quot;more subtlety, the melodies are stronger, and, most importantly, the scope of the material is much wider than the hard rock associated with Lizzy&quot;, showing a band more versatile than on the previous recording. To the contrary, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; fell short in comparison to the previous album, &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, suggesting that the album veered toward &quot;an odd, half-baked concept album&quot;, despite showing the same strengths as its predecessor, i.e. Lynott&#x27;s lyrics and the group&#x27;s musical power. Praising &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; as great moments, he said that the album &quot;never falls flat&quot;, but is &quot;never quite as gripping as &quot;Jailbreak&quot;&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff considered &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; Thin Lizzy&#x27;s first real masterpiece and described it as &quot;a rich textural work of melodic, soft-edged metal, lyrically soulful, melancholy, in many places tragic&quot;. Stuart Bailie, reviewing the 2011 reissue for &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, described the album as &quot;an exercise in tight, rousing tunes with the chiming Les Paul guitars and Phil&#x27;s patented blarney&quot;, but wrote that the bonus tracks were &quot;less revealing&quot; than on other Thin Lizzy expanded editions.

The track &quot;Johnny the Fox Meets Jimmy the Weed&quot; features on the &quot;Ultimate Breaks and Beats&quot; series of compilation albums.

==Track listings==

===Remastered edition===
On 24 January 2011, a new remastered and expanded edition of &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot; was released. This new edition is a 2-CD set, with the original album on disc one, and bonus material on disc two.

However, the track listing on the back cover is incorrect, as it accidentally lists &quot;Johnny the Fox Meets...&quot; (BBC Session) twice. Also the track listing on the back of the CD booklet is wrong as well. That lists &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot; three times when only two versions appear. The correct track listing is listed below.

Only the bonus material on disc two has been remastered in 2010 (despite what it says on the back of the CD booklet). Disc one uses the same remaster as the 1996 edition. New remasters were made, but scrapped at the last minute before the release, for reasons unknown.

==Singles==
*&quot;Johnny the Fox Meets Jimmy the Weed&quot; / &quot;Old Flame&quot; – 30 July 1976 (USA only)
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot; / &quot;Old Flame&quot; – 26 November 1976

<doc id="1066865" wikidata="Q2417698" url="?curid=1066865" title="Bad Reputation (Thin Lizzy album)">
<text>Bad Reputation is the eighth studio album by the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1977. As the front cover suggests, most of the tracks feature only three-quarters of the band, with guitarist Brian Robertson only credited on three tracks. He had missed most of their previous tour, following a hand injury sustained in a brawl, and this album turned out to be his last studio effort with Thin Lizzy. On 27 June 2011, a new remastered and expanded version of &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; was released.

==Recording==
With Robertson out of the band, band leader Phil Lynott had decided that Scott Gorham would be able to handle all the guitar duties himself, and that no replacement for Robertson would be recruited prior to recording the album. However, Gorham believed that a second guitarist was required, particularly for live work, performing songs that were written for two guitars. He later said, &quot;I was always a big believer in the magic circle – once you broke the magic circle, the whole thing was broken, right?&quot; He deliberately left two songs (&quot;Opium Trail&quot; and &quot;Killer Without a Cause&quot;) without guitar solos recorded, and persuaded Lynott to allow Robertson to return to the band to record the solos for them. Lynott relented, and Robertson flew to Toronto and recorded his lead guitar parts. However, he initially refused to socialise with the other band members: &quot;Christ, I wouldn&#x27;t even have a drink with them,&quot; he said. He later added, &quot;I tried not to go out to clubs for about a week, then succumbed...&quot; Robertson and Gorham shared lead guitar parts on only one song, &quot;That Woman&#x27;s Gonna Break Your Heart&quot;.

&quot;It was such an important album to us because of all the adversities that we&#x27;d been going through,&quot; recalled Gorham. &quot;We had to pull this together or we were going to go down in a ball of flames.&quot;

Robertson stayed on for the subsequent &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; tour, which provided some tracks for the &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; album (released 1978), but he left the band when the tour concluded.

==Cover art==
Thin Lizzy&#x27;s usual cover artist, Jim Fitzpatrick, did not contribute to the cover of &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, after a misunderstanding between himself and Lynott. With the deadline for the submission of the cover drawing near, Lynott travelled to the US to meet Fitzpatrick at his home in Madison, Connecticut, but went to Madison, Wisconsin by mistake. Unable to meet with Fitzpatrick in time, Lynott agreed to use an image by Sutton Cooper which featured the band as a trio, without Robertson. A photo of the band including Robertson was used on the reverse. The interior artwork featured photos of all four members, plus photos from &quot;The Incredible Case of the Stack O&#x27;Wheat Murders&quot; by Les Krims, which Lynott had seen in New York. The album also featured the playing card suit motifs that previously featured on the &quot;Fighting&quot; album in 1975, with the spade (Lynott), club (Downey), heart (Gorham) and diamond (Robertson).

Lynott insisted that Robertson would not appear on the front cover, with which Robertson &quot;agreed entirely&quot;, although he did appear in a group photograph on the back cover. Robertson later said, &quot;This was another of my little moods. I didn&#x27;t want my picture on the album cover because I hadn&#x27;t done any of the backing tracks, and I was even in a bad mood shooting for the back of it.&quot;

==Reception==

Hailing &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; as an improvement on the previous album, &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as &quot;leaner and tougher&quot; than its predecessor, partly due to the influence of producer Tony Visconti. He claimed that Robertson&#x27;s absence was not noticeable due to Scott Gorham&#x27;s &quot;double duty&quot;, and that this was &quot;pure visceral rock &amp; roll, the hardest and heaviest that Thin Lizzy ever made&quot;. He considered &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; as a rival to &quot;Jailbreak&quot; as the band&#x27;s best studio album. Martin Popoff considered the album &quot;a third stroke of genius in two short years&quot;, thematically resembling &quot;Fighting&quot; &quot;but more confessional, reflecting and spiritual.&quot;

Released during the rise of punk rock music, and despite Thin Lizzy being a hard rock band, &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; saw the band appealing to many punks due to the band&#x27;s &quot;tuneful and musical approach&quot; and with the &quot;energy delivered both live and in the studio&quot;, ensuring a &quot;youthful zest&quot;. As such, the album has been described as the band &quot;finding fresh fields to cultivate, not only musically but also in terms of their audience&quot;.

&quot;Bad Reputation&quot; reached No. 4 in the UK Albums Chart. The single &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight (It&#x27;s Caught Me in Its Spotlight)&quot; reached No. 14 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1977. The track should not be confused with a similarly titled song, &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot;, recorded by King Harvest and Toploader, amongst others.

==Cover versions and other uses==
Although it was not released as a single, the title track became a live staple. American all-girl heavy metal band Phantom Blue covered &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; on their 1993 sophomore album &quot;Built to Perform&quot;. A cover version of the song is a playable track in the 2006 music video game &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;, and the Thin Lizzy version was featured in the soundtrack of the 2001 documentary movie &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot;. 24-7 Spyz also covered the song on their album &quot;Face the Day&quot; (2006). Foo Fighters covered &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; and released it on their covers album, &quot;Medium Rare&quot; (2011). In 2012 video game &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; was featured on the in-game radio station Sagittarius FM. In 2015 English speed metal band Raven covered &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; on their album of covers titled &quot;Party Killers&quot;. This album was only made available to backers of Raven&#x27;s kickstarter for their album &quot;ExtermiNation&quot;, released in April 2015.

The Smashing Pumpkins covered &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight (It&#x27;s Caught Me in Its Spotlight)&quot; for various live performances, turning the upbeat, overlaid melody of the original into a slowly paced acoustic tune; it was recorded as B-side of the single &quot;Disarm&quot;. British indie pop singer-songwriter Diana Vickers covered the song as the first of several covers used as teasers leading up to the release of her second studio album. In 2005, the Thin Lizzy version of &quot;Dancin&#x27; in the Moonlight&quot; was used as part of an advertising campaign to launch Magners Irish Cider in the UK. In 2012 the English indie rock band Alt-J released a cover of &quot;Dancing in the Moonlight&quot; for the compilation &quot;The Saturday Sessions from The Dermot O&#x27;Leary Show &quot;.

Swedish guitarist John Norum of the Swedish rock band Europe covered &quot;Opium Trail&quot; on his second solo album, &quot;Face the Truth&quot; (1992).

<doc id="1066875" wikidata="Q1090100" url="?curid=1066875" title="Live and Dangerous">
<text>Live and Dangerous is a live double album by the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released in June 1978. It was recorded in London in 1976, and Philadelphia and Toronto in 1977, with further production in Paris. It was also the last Thin Lizzy album to feature guitarist Brian Robertson, who left the band shortly after its release.

The band decided to release a live album after their producer Tony Visconti did not have enough time to work on a full studio session. They listened through various archive recordings from earlier tours and compiled the album from the best versions. Various studio overdubs were made to the live recordings during early 1978 in Paris; exactly how much of the album is overdubbed has been a contentious topic since its release. The album reached No. 2 in the UK Albums Chart, ultimately selling over half a million copies in the UK. It has continued to attract critical acclaim and it has appeared in several lists of the greatest live albums of all time.

==Recording==

By the mid-1970s, Thin Lizzy had stabilised around its founding members – singer and bassist Phil Lynott and drummer Brian Downey – and guitarists Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson. The band had scored hit singles and developed a strong live following, including headlining the Reading Festival. Robertson had briefly left the band in 1977 but subsequently returned. 

The group planned to make a new studio album at the start of 1978, helmed by producer Tony Visconti, with whom they had created the successful &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;. However, Visconti had a very tight schedule and had committed to producing albums for other artists, so Lynott suggested they instead spend two weeks together compiling a live album.

The band and Visconti listened to over 30 hours of archive recordings, looking for the best performances. The album&#x27;s sleeve notes credit two concerts as its source: Hammersmith Odeon, London, England on 14 November 1976 (part of the tour for &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;, released earlier that year), and Seneca College Fieldhouse, Don Mills, Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 28 October 1977 (part of the tour for &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;). 

Visconti later revealed that shows at the Tower Theater, Philadelphia on 20 and 21 October 1977, a week earlier than the Toronto gig, had also been recorded. The band had listened to the Hammersmith tapes shortly after recording and agreed that the performances sounded better than the studio versions. Thin Lizzy biographer Mark Putterford believes the majority of recordings on the finished album are from the Hammersmith show. Visconti later said the performance of &quot;Southbound&quot; came from a soundcheck before one of the Philadelphia gigs, with the audience reaction dubbed from another song.

On the album, the band segues immediately from &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; into &quot;The Boys Are Back in Town&quot;, on the line &quot;a cowboy&#x27;s life is the life for me&quot; – the last chord of the former was the first of the latter, although their studio versions were recorded as separate songs. This segue remained a staple of the band&#x27;s setlist for the rest of their career, and examples can be found on other live releases. The band had rearranged &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; to be slower and more emotional than the original studio version, and the version on &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; was considered by Putterford the highlight of Lynott&#x27;s musical career. &quot;That was us at our best,&quot; observed Gorham, &quot;before the bad drugs came in.&quot;

To promote the album, the group filmed a gig at the Rainbow Theatre, London on 29 March 1978 for a television broadcast. However, this was cancelled and the footage went unaired.

==Production==

The album was mixed and overdubbed at Studio Des Dames, Paris in January 1978. All sources agree that overdubbing took place on &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot;, although there is considerable disagreement about the extent of them. According to Visconti, the album was &quot;75% recorded in the studio&quot; with only the drums and audience noise remaining from the original live recordings. Visconti later said the overdubs and production were essential in order that the listener could hear a professional sounding band. He claims to have created some audience sounds from a keyboard-triggered tape loop in a similar manner to a Mellotron or sampling keyboard. Nevertheless, Visconti was happy with the production and believes the end result sounds authentic.

However, manager Chris O&#x27;Donnell said the album was 75% live, with overdubs restricted to backing vocals and a few guitar solos to &quot;clean the sound up&quot;. Lynott said that there were a few necessary overdubs, but &quot;anything else would have ruined the atmosphere on those recordings and made a mockery of putting out a live album&quot;. Robertson has been particularly critical over Visconti&#x27;s view. He has said the album is almost all live, and the sound levels on stage would make overdubbing impossible due to the lack of acoustic separation between instruments. He claims a recording of &quot;Still In Love With You&quot;, featuring a guitar solo he felt was better than the one at the gig that was eventually released, could not be used due to phaser noise on the bass. From this, he concluded that if the bass could not be overdubbed, nothing else could either.

O&#x27;Donnell hired Chalkie Davies, a photographer for &quot;New Musical Express&quot; for two weeks to photograph the band on a US tour in early 1978 in order to capture enough pictures suitable for the album artwork. The front cover, featuring Lynott in the foreground, was originally supposed to be the back cover as the group wanted equal coverage of all members. O&#x27;Donnell disagreed and reversed the front and back photographs at the last minute. The album had a working title of &quot;Thin Lizzy Live&quot; but Lynott decided that &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; was better.

Some pressings of the record sleeve include a montage photograph in the studio containing a mirror, straw, razor blade and a rolled up five pound note (as an overt reference to cocaine consumption). Lynott insisted on adding the picture over the rest of the band&#x27;s objections.

==Release==

&quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; was released as a double album on 2 June 1978. In the UK, it was released on Vertigo Records and reached a high of No. 2 in the UK album charts, held from the top spot by the &quot;Grease soundtrack album&quot;. It remained in the charts for 62 weeks and eventually sold 600,000 copies. It was also the first album to be released by Warner Bros. Records in America after the band left Mercury Records in that area. A single from the album, &quot;Rosalie / Cowgirl&#x27;s Song&quot; backed with a live version of &quot;Me And The Boys&quot;, which was a frequent encore but not included on the album, was released in April and reached No. 20 in the UK Singles Chart.

The band began touring to promote the album, but after a one-off gig in Ibiza, Lynott and Robertson had an acrimonious argument. Robertson subsequently quit Thin Lizzy permanently to form Wild Horses with former Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain. He was replaced by a returning Gary Moore, who had already been a band member in 1974 and 1977.

The album was reissued on CD in 1989. The March 1978 footage from the Rainbow Theatre concert was released a first time in 1980 on VHS by VCL Video and as a 60-minute edit by Castle Communications in 1994 and titled &quot;Live &amp; Dangerous&quot;. The footage was released on DVD in 2007, with other group performances including a show from their farewell tour on 26 January 1983, and four &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; clips from the 1970s.

In 2009, the live album &quot;Still Dangerous&quot; was released, which features material from the 20 October 1977 gig at Philadelphia that was used for some of &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot;. There is some overlap of tracks between the two albums, though &quot;Still Dangerous&quot; is completely live with no overdubs.

In 2022, a deluxe box set of the album was released, containing the original live recordings that made up the album. These showed that there was far less overdubbing than previously claimed.

==Reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as &quot;one of the best double live LPs of the 70s&quot;, and &quot;a true live classic&quot;, containing more energy and power than the original studio albums. He also praised the &quot;expert song selection&quot;. Stuart Bailie in his review for &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine praised the quality of the music and played down rumours of studio overdubbing. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Tim Chester declared &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; &quot;the best live album we ever heard&quot; despite the alleged overdubs, which he dismissed as irrelevant. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; for &quot;supercharging some of the old guitar-based tunes that were a bit stiff, dated or under-dressed on studio vinyl&quot; and paired it with UFO&#x27;s &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; as critics&#x27; favourite live albums.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at No. 50 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

The album continues to attract critical praise. In 2010 &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; was ranked number one in PlanetRock.com&#x27;s The Greatest Live Album Top 40. The following year, the British music magazine &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; at No. 1 in its &quot;50 Greatest Live Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; put the album at No. 46 in its list of the greatest live albums. The album is included in the 2011 revision of &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

==Track listings==

===Remastered edition===
A new remastered and expanded version of &quot;Live And Dangerous&quot; was released in 2011. As well as the full album, remastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham, it featured two additional tracks from the period that were not originally included on the album (although they were later released on the &quot;Killers Live&quot; EP in 1981). The set also included a DVD with the Rainbow Theatre footage. The sleeve notes were written by Malcolm Dome and included a debate of exactly how much of the album was live and how much was overdubbed.

<doc id="1066886" wikidata="Q4027452" url="?curid=1066886" title="Chinatown (Thin Lizzy album)">
<text>Chinatown is the tenth studio album by Irish band Thin Lizzy, released in 1980. It introduced guitarist Snowy White who would also perform on the next album as well as tour with Thin Lizzy between 1980 and 1982; he replaced Gary Moore as permanent guitarist. White had previously worked with Cliff Richard, Peter Green and Pink Floyd. &quot;Chinatown&quot; also featured eighteen-year-old Darren Wharton on keyboards, and he joined Thin Lizzy as a permanent member later that year.

==Recording==
Having recruited new guitarist Snowy White just before Christmas 1979, Thin Lizzy began recording sessions at Good Earth Studios for what would become the &quot;Chinatown&quot; album in January 1980, and finished recording &quot;Dear Miss Lonely Hearts&quot; (co-written with Jimmy Bain) in early February. This song was not considered for the album and was instead used for Phil Lynott&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Solo in Soho&quot;, despite all the musicians playing on the song (and ultimately appearing in the video) being members of Thin Lizzy. Between March and May, the band worked on more songs, including &quot;Lady Killer on the Loose&quot;, &quot;The Sacred Sweetheart&quot; and the title track &quot;Chinatown&quot;, the latter two of which were also performed live at this time, at shows in Ireland and Scandinavia. Another song which had already been played live was &quot;Didn&#x27;t I&quot;, on the recent Japanese tour with temporary guitarist Dave Flett in the band.

The co-producer on the album was Kit Woolven, who was employed by Thin Lizzy&#x27;s previous producer, Tony Visconti. New keyboard player Darren Wharton later described Woolven as a &quot;really nice guy, easy-going, diplomatic type of guy&quot;, and a &quot;really good engineer&quot;. Wharton also described how Woolven acted as a guide for Lynott in terms of production, rather than either man producing the album himself. Woolven described the recording as &quot;hard to do&quot; due to Lynott&#x27;s tendency to make up ideas on the spot rather than undertake any pre-production work. He also stated that this made it harder for new guitarist White, who was used to a more regimented style of working. Bass guitarist Jerome Rimson, who worked on Lynott&#x27;s solo albums, described the scene in the studio: &quot;I watched him [Lynott] record most of the &quot;Chinatown&quot; album standing at the microphone and making up the words as he was standing there. There was a full-blown party going on in the control room.&quot;

Midge Ure had been performing live with the band up to this point, but left after the Scandinavian shows in April. The band reconvened at Good Earth to continue work on the album, but soon had to relocate to RAK Studios when more time at Good Earth became unavailable. It was there that the band met teenage keyboard player Wharton, who had been recommended to Lynott by a friend in Manchester. Wharton travelled to London for an audition in the form of a loose jam, but the band were too busy finishing &quot;Chinatown&quot;, which was to be released as a single in May. He returned the following week, having learned all the band&#x27;s material, and was hired on a temporary basis. Promotional videos were recorded for &quot;Chinatown&quot; and the completed &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot; around the same time, without Wharton. These were directed by David Mallet, with whom the band had worked on videos for the previous album &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot;, at Hewitt Studios in London.

Recording was subsequently delayed by more touring, and some shows were recorded to provide material for a potential live album, although most of it was used for B-sides and an EP, &quot;Killers Live&quot;. By mid-June, the band returned to Good Earth to complete &quot;Chinatown&quot;, although it was still unclear which songs would be featured. By July, a preliminary running order had been established for the album. Side one featured &quot;Chinatown&quot;, &quot;We Will Be Strong&quot;, &quot;Didn&#x27;t I&quot;, &quot;Turn Around&quot; and &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot;. Side two consisted of &quot;Hey You, You Got It Made&quot;, &quot;Having a Good Time&quot;, &quot;Sweetheart&quot;, &quot;The Act&quot;, &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; and &quot;Sugar Blues&quot;. 

Two of the songs which had been worked on were ultimately considered unsuitable for the album: &quot;The Act&quot; (also known as &quot;It&#x27;s Going Wrong&quot;) and &quot;The Story of My Life&quot;. The former was eventually re-recorded and finished for Lynott&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;The Philip Lynott Album&quot;, as &quot;Don&#x27;t Talk About Me Baby&quot;, while &quot;The Story of My Life&quot; with lead guitar by White remained unfinished. Another song, &quot;Turn Around&quot;, which had been played during soundchecks for live shows, was completed as &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Around&quot;, and was used as the B-side of the &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot; single instead of being included on the album. A soundcheck recording of the song appeared on the expanded version of the album, released in 2011. In August, having decided that these three songs would not be included, the band decided to reduce the number of tracks on the album rather than write and record new material. The only new song brought in at this time was &quot;Genocide (The Killing of the Buffalo)&quot;.

The finished album opened with &quot;We Will Be Strong&quot;, which was released in the US as a single, albeit without a promotional video. &quot;Chinatown&quot; followed, based on ideas by new member White and a bass exercise shown to Lynott by Brush Shiels, and completed by the whole band, with drummer Brian Downey adding double bass drum fills. &quot;Sweetheart&quot; (renamed from &quot;The Sacred Sweetheart&quot;) featured keyboards by Wharton, while &quot;Sugar Blues&quot; was another band collaboration which strongly featured White. Side one closed with &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot;, which attracted attention from the press amid the ongoing murders and attacks on women by the Yorkshire Ripper, particularly when the song was released as a single in September. The song was a hit, reaching number 10 in the UK charts, despite the record company failing to press sufficient records to meet demand. 

Side two opened with &quot;Having a Good Time&quot;, followed by &quot;Genocide (The Killing of the Buffalo)&quot;, which Lynott wrote with the help of Thin Lizzy artist Jim Fitzpatrick, who also designed the cover for the album. Fitzpatrick did not contribute to the lyrics but assisted in maintaining the historical accuracy of Lynott&#x27;s theme of the slaughter of American bison in the 19th century, and its effects on the Plains Indians people. Fitzpatrick was unhappy with the lyrics, and Lynott&#x27;s lyrics in general: &quot;I felt [they] deteriorated horrendously. His mind wasn&#x27;t making the connections it used to make.&quot; &quot;Didn&#x27;t I&quot; was completed with the help of Tim Hinkley, who added piano parts, and Fiachra Trench, who provided string arrangements. Hinkley had previously added keyboards to &quot;Running Back&quot; on the &quot;Jailbreak&quot; album in 1976, and Trench had worked on &quot;Johnny the Fox&quot;, also in 1976, as well as &quot;Vagabonds of the Western World&quot; in 1973. Trench also worked on Lynott&#x27;s solo albums, and said &quot;Didn&#x27;t I&quot; ultimately &quot;could&#x27;ve gone either way, Lizzy or solo&quot;. &quot;Chinatown&quot; closed with &quot;Hey You&quot;, a collaboration between Lynott and Downey, the song&#x27;s title having been shortened.

==Cover==
The cover for the album was designed by regular band artist Jim Fitzpatrick, who drew many sketches for Lynott&#x27;s approval. One featured a dragon with flames emanating from it, in a &quot;Chinese type of pagoda style&quot;, which Lynott liked. Fitzpatrick developed the theme and finished the front cover. There was another piece in a similar style on the back, which Fitzpatrick finished and sent to the record company directly. &quot;They loved it...&quot; he later said. &quot;One of my best pieces of work. It&#x27;s why I want it back, right? If it ever turns up anywhere.&quot;

==Reception==

Greg Prato of AllMusic described &quot;Chinatown&quot; as a &quot;letdown&quot; compared to the previous album &quot;Black Rose: A Rock Legend&quot;, blaming the absence of Gary Moore and producer Tony Visconti, and the drug problems experienced by Phil Lynott and Scott Gorham. Prato praised side one as containing the best material, including the &quot;anthemic&quot; &quot;We Will Be Strong&quot;, and the &quot;pop perfection&quot; of &quot;Sweetheart&quot;. However, he described side two as &quot; almost entirely of bland filler&quot;, although he believed that &quot;Chinatown&quot; was &quot;not their worst album&quot;. Canadian journalist Martin Popoff wrote that &quot;although comprising some spirited tunes, (...) lyrically and thematically the songs seem forced and all too topical&quot; and &quot;the overall level of quality below Lizzy&#x27;s soulful standards&quot;, with Snowy White &quot;more a studied session man&quot; than a new band member.

Guitarist White later described the album as &quot;pretty strong&quot;, although it was in need of more work. He was frustrated at what he saw as wasted time in the studio, and also stated that some guitar ideas he recorded while waiting for the band were subsequently wiped at Lynott&#x27;s instructions without listening to them. Co-producer Kit Woolven felt the album could have been more &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;: &quot;It needed a Robbo or someone like that in there,&quot; he said. Woolven also described the increasing substance abuse within the band as a problem.

Gorham himself described &quot;Chinatown&quot; as &quot;kind of a strange album&quot;, and cited his increasing drug use as a reason why the album was &quot;a tough album to actually get through&quot;, adding that he does not remember recording some of the material. Drummer Brian Downey remembered, &quot;There&#x27;s some great tracks on both [&quot;Chinatown&quot; and the follow-up &quot;Renegade&quot;], but Phil&#x27;s songwriting seemed to be slipping a bit. All that pressure was getting to him and the drugs were starting to take effect... For some reason we were becoming a little bit unfashionable as well.&quot; Gorham added, &quot;We realised that at this point we weren&#x27;t actually getting any bigger.&quot;

<text>Renegade is the eleventh studio album by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1981. Though not his first appearance, this was the first album in which keyboard player Darren Wharton was credited as a permanent member, becoming the fifth member of the line-up. As such, he made a contribution as a songwriter on the opening track &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. However, even though he had officially joined the band, his picture was omitted from the album sleeve. &quot;Renegade&quot; was the second and final album to feature guitarist Snowy White. By his own admission, White was more suited to playing blues than heavy rock and he quit by mutual agreement the following year. He went on to have a hit single with &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; in 1983.

==Recording==
The previous album &quot;Chinatown&quot; having been released in October 1980, Thin Lizzy travelled to Compass Point Studios, Nassau, in early January 1981 to start work on the follow-up. &quot;Chinatown&quot; co-producer Kit Woolven accompanied them, and they worked on four songs during the following week. However, band leader and main songwriter Phil Lynott was also using this studio time to record material for his second solo album, and two of these songs, &quot;Cathleen&quot; and &quot;A Little Bit of Water&quot;, appeared on &quot;The Philip Lynott Album&quot; the following year. &quot;In the Delta&quot; ultimately remained unused, but &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Dangerous for Us&quot; became the first song earmarked for the as yet untitled Thin Lizzy album.

The band then went on the road, before convening at Townhouse Studios in London in March to work on more new material. Work continued on &quot;In the Delta&quot;, and a song left over from the &quot;Chinatown&quot; sessions, &quot;The Act&quot;, was reworked and abandoned again, while another song destined to be a Lynott solo track, &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Dream&quot;, was recorded. Three other songs were brought in: the upbeat &quot;Kill (Gotta Get a Gun)&quot;; guitarist Scott Gorham&#x27;s song &quot;Wham Bam&quot;, and a song begun by Snowy White called &quot;Fats&quot;. The latter was the only track which emerged on &quot;Renegade&quot;.

In early May, Thin Lizzy began work at the new Odyssey Studios in London, as they were increasingly unable to secure time at Good Earth Studios. More time was spent on &quot;The Act&quot;, while Lynott recorded an eight-minute demo of a tune called &quot;Mexican Girl&quot;. Another song recorded at this time which was eventually left unused was &quot;For Always&quot; (originally titled &quot;Darren&#x27;s Tune&quot;), which originated with keyboard player Darren Wharton, and featured a string arrangement by Fiachra Trench. Later in May and June, two songs featuring White on lead vocals, &quot;Only Woman&quot; and &quot;Moving Away From Here&quot;, were recorded but unfinished. Two further songs were started which did find their way on to &quot;Renegade&quot; – &quot;Banging My Head Against the Wall&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Leave This Town&quot;. The former was rewritten as &quot;Down on Your Luck&quot; in July, before receiving its final title of &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot;. &quot;Kill (Gotta Get a Gun)&quot; was developed, as was &quot;Mexican Girl&quot; (now retitled &quot;Mexican Blood&quot;).

===&quot;Trouble Boys&quot;===
Also in July, the band recorded two covers: &quot;Trouble Boys&quot;, written by Billy Bremner of Rockpile (who was present in the studio at the time), and Percy Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Memory Pain&quot;, suggested by White and featuring his bluesy lead guitar. Lynott wanted to release the former as a single, against the wishes of the rest of the band, and convinced the band&#x27;s record company to do so. White later said, &quot;Nobody wanted to put that out except Phil. Scott was dead against putting it out.&quot; Wharton remembered, &quot;Everyone hated the damn song,&quot; while British music newspaper &quot;Record Mirror&quot; described it as &quot;dinosaur stuff&quot;. The title of the forthcoming album was pencilled in to be &quot;Trouble Boys&quot; to link to the single, but when it stalled at number 53 in the UK charts, the title and the two covers were dropped.

Between touring and festival dates, Thin Lizzy also began work on &quot;Disaster&quot;, co-written by Lynott and Wharton. This song, along with &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot;, was performed live for the first time in Germany in late August. Also around this time, Lynott and drummer Brian Downey reunited with the band&#x27;s original guitarist Eric Bell, who had left in 1973, to record &quot;Song for Jimmy&quot;, Lynott&#x27;s tribute to Jimi Hendrix. This was never considered for the &quot;Renegade&quot; album, although possibly as a Lynott solo track, but it ultimately appeared on a flexi disc given away with Flexipop magazine in the UK in August. It was later released on the Vagabonds Kings Warriors Angels box set in 2001, with the title corrected to &quot;Song for Jimi&quot;.

===Change of co-producer===
The band continued working at Odyssey Studios and Morgan Studios, recording overdubs and developing more material during September. At this point Lynott and co-producer Kit Woolven had a disagreement about sharing studio time between Thin Lizzy and Lynott&#x27;s solo project. Woolven had become frustrated: &quot;I wanted to try and make sure that the solo album sounded one way and the Lizzy stuff sounded another way. If you&#x27;re flipping between things all the time, it&#x27;s quite confusing.&quot; He also said he was not keen on the &quot;Renegade&quot; material: &quot;It didn&#x27;t do it for me. I stuck with the solo stuff as it was more interesting.&quot; Downey added, &quot;There was definitely confusion, absolutely. There was a definite crossover where you didn&#x27;t know which album the songs were going to appear on... Kit questioned the whole procedure, and I had to agree with him.&quot;

Young producer Chris Tsangarides was working at Morgan Studios at the time, and he met with the band and reviewed their progress, agreeing to help them finish the album. He expressed concern at the lack of focus within the material, and urged the band to write some new songs. As well as the two covers from the failed single, other songs were dropped. These consisted of songs considered best suited to Lynott&#x27;s solo project, such as &quot;Beat of the Drum&quot; and &quot;Someone Else&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and unfinished material like &quot;Bad Is Bad&quot;, &quot;Only Woman&quot; and &quot;Moving Away From Here&quot;. Also abandoned were &quot;For Always&quot; and the &quot;Trouble Boys&quot; soundalike &quot;Kill (Gotta Get a Gun)&quot;. New songs brought in included the revamped &quot;Disaster&quot;, now titled &quot;Angel of Death&quot;, which was also considered as an album title. Gorham expressed his dislike of the title, and the song: &quot;I thought &quot;Angel of Death&quot; was too heavy metal for words, and I hated it.&quot; He later clarified, &quot;For a time there, it wasn&#x27;t one of our favourites... [but] that song, more than any other song convinced me that [Wharton] had a right to be in Thin Lizzy.&quot;

Also recorded at this stage were &quot;The Pressure Will Blow&quot; and &quot;No-One Told Him&quot;, as well as a reworking of an idea of White&#x27;s from earlier in the year with the title &quot;If You Save Souls&quot;. On leaving the studio for a break, Lynott saw a biker with the Thin Lizzy and Motörhead logos on his jacket. Also on the man&#x27;s jacket was the word &quot;Renegade&quot;, which inspired Lynott to rewrite &quot;If You Save Souls&quot; as &quot;Renegade&quot;, giving him the idea for the album title at the same time. Lynott was also inspired by reading &quot;The Rebel&quot; by Albert Camus. &quot;It sort of came in a blinding flash: the idea of there being a rebel in us all,&quot; he said.

===Completion===
&quot;Angel of Death&quot; opened the album and represented Wharton&#x27;s first co-writing credit with the band. Lynott&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by seeing &quot;The Man Who Saw Tomorrow&quot;, about the predictions of Nostradamus. The title track &quot;Renegade&quot; follows, co-written by White with most of the lead guitar played by him. Tsangarides remembered: &quot;That was mostly all Snowy on &quot;Renegade&quot;. The whole style of the song was really him.&quot; He added that this was the song which needed most work at the time he took over the co-producer role. White has named it as his favourite Thin Lizzy song. Next was &quot;The Pressure Will Blow&quot;, co-written with Gorham, which Lynott explained was about a man who discovered his partner&#x27;s affair, and who told her to leave before he became violent. &quot;So it&#x27;s controlled anger,&quot; he said. The last song on side one, &quot;Leave This Town&quot;, was influenced by ZZ Top. On hearing Gorham play the riff, Lynott later said, &quot;Immediately I sort of ripped off ZZ Top for all their worth.&quot;

Side two opened with &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot;, which was released as the only single from the album in March 1982, after the album was released. It reached number 53, the same position as &quot;Trouble Boys&quot; a few months earlier. Tsangarides said they all struggled to find a single to release from the album, &quot;but I think we felt that &quot;Hollywood&quot; was the closest.&quot; It is followed by &quot;No-One Told Him&quot;, one of only two songs written solely by Lynott. Some members of the band expressed reservations about the Lynott/White collaboration &quot;Fats&quot;, about Fats Waller and somewhat in Waller&#x27;s style. Gorham said, &quot;I remember &quot;Fats&quot; going down on tape and thinking, &#x27;Whoa, what was &quot;that&quot;?&#x27;&quot; Wharton added, &quot;Despite the fact I got to do a piano solo, I thought &quot;Fats&quot; missed the mark. So did &quot;Mexican Blood&quot; and one or two others.&quot; Downey, however, liked the Western-themed &quot;Mexican Blood&quot;: &quot;I play some timbales as well as marimbas on &quot;Mexican Blood&quot;. Good song, I like that one.&quot; The album closes with &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Dangerous&quot;, one of the first ideas Lynott brought to the sessions at Compass Point in January, with a lyric describing friends drifting apart. Tsangarides stated, &quot;It&#x27;s one of my favourite tracks that I still listen to, to this day.&quot;

==Cover==
Regular Thin Lizzy artist Jim Fitzpatrick was initially engaged in designing the album cover, and drew an apocalyptic scene as a preliminary idea while the album title was pencilled in as &quot;Angel of Death&quot;. Once the title was established as &quot;Renegade&quot;, Fitzpatrick drew rough drafts of a cover featuring Lynott on a wanted poster reminiscent of the Wild West, which Lynott liked. However, Phonogram / Vertigo were unwilling to provide funding for an outside artist, and the final cover was photographed by Graham Hughes, a cousin of Roger Daltrey. One idea was to show the band superimposed on a dark mountain with a red sky in the background, but the final version showed an arm waving a deep red flag with a yellow five-pointed star on it. On release, Lynott said the flag had nothing to do with communism, &quot;It&#x27;s not supposed to be a communist flag,&quot; he said, &quot;although it looks like one... nothing to do with North Vietnam or anything.&quot; The red colour was inspired by Lynott seeing the colour of a box of Dunhill cigarettes belonging to co-producer Tsangarides, although Lynott claimed at the time they were his own.

The back cover featured Hughes&#x27; portraits of four of the band members, with Wharton omitted. The record company said the layout of the back cover dictated that there was only room for four photos, which angered Wharton: &quot;It was a horrible excuse and it hurt me a great deal,&quot; he said. Another suggestion was that the record company were unaware that Wharton was by this time a full member of the band. Lynott was keen at the time to quash any suggestion of the group breaking up.

==Reception==

Greg Prato of AllMusic claimed that &quot;Renegade&quot; is Thin Lizzy&#x27;s worst album, with &quot;blatant pop leanings and a production too similar to British heavy metal bands of the early &#x27;80s&quot;, blaming Snowy White&#x27;s incompatibility with the group, Lynott&#x27;s &quot;flat vocals&quot; and the band&#x27;s drug problems. Prato named &quot;The Pressure Will Blow&quot;, &quot;Leave This Town&quot; and &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot; as the album&#x27;s better songs. David Fricke in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated his disappointment for Lynott&#x27;s performance as singer and songwriter on the album, writing that &quot;only the rousing chorus of &quot;Hollywood (Down on Your Luck)&quot; and the poignant sense of loss in &quot;It&#x27;s Getting Dangerous&quot; hint at the sensitive yet anthemic writing and hard-rock smarts that usually separate Thin Lizzy from the lunkheads&quot;. On the contrary, Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised the album for its superb production and the professional state-of-the-art sound, calling &quot;Renegade&quot; &quot;an absolute masterpiece of deeply soulful and richly textured hard rock&quot;, whose &quot;fullness and maturity tend to emerge only when played repeatedly&quot;.

Co-producer Chris Tsangarides said later, &quot;When I hear the &quot;Renegade&quot; album now, I get it... I think it was maybe ahead of its time. It was just too diverse for people to accept when it was first released. If you listen to it you&#x27;ll notice that no one song on there is like another.&quot;

<doc id="1066892" wikidata="Q1059947" url="?curid=1066892" title="Shimo-kitazawa Station">
<text>is an interchange station on the Odakyu Odawara and the Keio Inokashira lines located in Kitazawa, Setagaya, Tokyo, and jointly operated by the private railway operators Odakyu Electric Railway and Keio Corporation.

The station gives its name to the surrounding Shimokitazawa neighborhood in the southern corner of the Kitazawa district, which is a popular area for young people in large numbers. It includes small independently owned shops, cafes, live music venues and theaters.

==Lines==
Shimo-kitazawa Station is served by the Odakyu Odawara Line from in Tokyo, and also by the Keio Inokashira Line from in Tokyo to . Located between and , it is from the Shibuya terminus of the Inokashira Line.

==Service pattern==
On the Keio Inokashira Line, both all-stations &quot;Local&quot; services and limited-stop &quot;Express&quot; services stop at this station. On the Odakyu Odawara Line, only Limited Express services pass the station.

==Station layout==
The Odakyu Odawara and Keio Inokashira lines cross at this station, with the Keio line on elevated tracks above the Odakyu line. After a major station reconstruction project, the Odakyu lines were relocated in March 2013 from their prior surface position to new platforms three stories underground. Additional construction work, ending in 2018, separated the express line trains from the local line trains, one level above. Now, the four-track route that formerly ended at is complete as far as station.

An unusual feature of Shimo-kitazawa Station for many years was the use of a single ticket gate serving two independent lines and ticketing systems; this was a legacy of the Inokashira Line&#x27;s former ownership by Odakyu. Additionally, there were no ticket gates between the two lines. However, as part of a major Station renovation construction project, this was changed in March 2019. Now, both lines have separate entrances and ticket gates, and it is necessary to exit and enter ticket gates in order to switch between lines.

===Odakyu platforms===
The Odakyu station consists of two underground island platforms located on the first and second basement levels, serving two tracks each.

====Basement 2F: express, commuter express, and rapid express====


====Basement 1F: local, semi-express, express, and commuter semi-express====

===Keio platforms===
The Keio station consists of an elevated island platform serving two tracks.

==History==
The Odakyu section was opened on 1 April 1927, and the Keio section on 1 August 1933.

From 22 February 2013, station numbering was introduced on Keio lines, with Shimo-kitazawa being assigned station number IN05.

From 23 March 2013, trains used the new underground platforms located on the third basement (B3F) level, and the original ground-level platforms were taken out of service. As of 3 March 2018, platforms on the second basement (B2F) level have opened for use by all-stations services, with the lower platforms used by limited-stop services only.

Station numbering was introduced to the Odakyu platforms in 2014 with Shimo-kitazawa being assigned station number OH07.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2011, the Keio station was used by an average of 127,124 passengers daily. The passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.
In the 2015 data available from Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Shimo-kitazawa → Takadanobaba was one of the train segments among Tokyo&#x27;s most crowded train lines during rush hour.

<text>Different Trains is a three-movement piece for string quartet and tape written by Steve Reich in 1988.

==Background==
During World War II, Reich made train journeys between New York and Los Angeles to visit his parents, who had separated. Years later, he pondered the fact that, as a Jew, had he been in Europe instead of the United States at that time, he might have been traveling in Holocaust trains.

Steve Reich&#x27;s earlier work had frequently used tape, looped and played back at different speeds. However, &quot;Different Trains&quot; was a novel experiment, using recorded speech as a source for melodies.

==Structure==
&quot;Different Trains&quot; is made up of three movements, which bear the following titles:

In each part, melodies are introduced, usually by a single instrument (viola for women and cello for men), a recording of the spoken phrase from which the melody derives is played. The melody is then developed for a while, with the instruments playing along with the recording of the phrase or part of the phrase. The music for the strings makes extensive use of paradiddle rhythms, with alternating pitches instead of alternating drum sticking. In addition to speech, the piece includes recordings of train sounds, as well as of sirens and warning bells, and prerecorded multiple lines by the string quartet, thus effectively creating four quartets out of one, reflective of three &quot;Counterpoint&quot; pieces that preceded it: &quot;Vermont Counterpoint&quot; for multiple multitracked flutes, &quot;New York Counterpoint&quot; for multiple multitracked clarinets, and &quot;Electric Counterpoint&quot; for multiple multitracked electric guitars.

The recorded version on this album lasts for approximately 27 minutes.

The recorded speech that forms the basis for &quot;Different Trains&quot; is taken from interviews with people in the United States and Europe about the years leading up to, during, and immediately after World War II. In the first movement, &quot;America — Before the War&quot;, Reich&#x27;s governess Virginia and Lawrence Davis, a Pullman porter, reminisce about train travel in the U.S. while American train sounds are heard in the background. In the second movement, &quot;Europe — During the War&quot;, three Holocaust survivors (identified by Reich as Paul, Rachel, and Rachella) speak about their experiences in Europe during the war, including their train trips to concentration camps. European train sounds and sirens are heard in this movement. The American train whistles are long perfect intervals of ninths and fifths, while the European train whistles are mostly short triadic shrieks. The third movement, &quot;After the War&quot;, features the Holocaust survivors talking about the years immediately following World War II, along with recordings of Davis and Virginia. There is a return to the American train sounds from the first movement.

Reich developed his &quot;speech melody&quot; work further with projects such as &quot;The Cave&quot; (1993) and &quot;City Life&quot; (1995). The technique also appears in &quot;WTC 9/11&quot; (2011), a similar work dealing with human tragedy juxtaposed with everyday life and responses to it.

Reich created these works by transferring his speech recordings into a digital sampling keyboard (a Casio FZ-1). &quot;City Life&quot; used sampling keyboards in performance (rather than using a backing tape) and the samples are notated and played in exactly the same way as the conventional instruments.

==Reception==
The world premiere was performed by the Kronos Quartet at the First Presbyterian Church in Miami, during the 1988 New Music America festival. 

Its original recording, also performed by the Kronos Quartet, won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Contemporary Composition in 1989.

<text>Thunder and Lightning is the twelfth and final studio album by Irish hard rock band Thin Lizzy, released on 4 March 1983. Guitarist John Sykes was hired to replace Snowy White after 1981&#x27;s &quot;Renegade&quot;, and Sykes helped to provide a heavier sound and guitar tone than Thin Lizzy had used on previous albums. However, the bulk of the songwriting (except for &quot;Cold Sweat&quot;) was completed before he joined the band. Keyboard player Darren Wharton also offered a stronger musical influence to Thin Lizzy&#x27;s final studio album, co-writing many of the tracks including &quot;Some Day She Is Going to Hit Back&quot;, and the final single &quot;The Sun Goes Down&quot;. A farewell tour followed the album&#x27;s release, followed by the live album &quot;Life&quot;. The group&#x27;s co-founder, frontman and bass player Phil Lynott died in 1986.

== Reception ==

AllMusic&#x27;s Greg Prato proclaimed &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; &quot;a definite improvement&quot; compared to much of their other output in the 1980s, but remarked that the record was not the &quot;best release&quot; by the band.

<doc id="1066909" wikidata="Q1870313" url="?curid=1066909" title="Lorica (prayer)">
<text>In the Irish (Hiberno-Scottish) monastic tradition, a lorica is a prayer recited for protection. It is essentially a &#x27;protection prayer&#x27; in which the petitioner invokes all the power of God as a safeguard against evil in its many forms. 

The Latin word &quot;lōrīca&quot; originally meant &quot;armour&quot; (body armor, in the sense of chainmail or cuirass).
The idea underlying the name is probably derived from Ephesians 6:14, where Paul bids his readers stand, &quot;having put on the breast-plate of righteousness,&quot;.
The Greek word here translated as &quot;breast-plate&quot; is θώραξ, in the Vulgata version rendered &quot;lorica&quot;. 

==Invocation==

Similar to a litany, the lorica often listed whose protection was requested. &quot;Gabriel be my breastplate, Michael be my belt, Raphael be my shield...&quot;

Notable loricas include &quot;Rob tu mo bhoile, a Comdi cride&quot;, which in its English translation provides the text for the hymn &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot;, the &quot;Lorica of Laidcenn&quot;, and the &quot;Lorica of Gildas&quot;.

Scholar of recent Scottish Gaelic literature Ronald Black has praised Father Allan MacDonald&#x27;s work of Christian poetry &quot;Adhram Thu, Adhbhar Mo Bhith&quot; (&quot;I Worship You, O Cause of My Being&quot;) as, &quot;A powerful hymn of the St. Patrick&#x27;s Breastplate type.&quot;

== Lorica of St Patrick ==

The Lorica of Saint Patrick, begins:&lt;poem&gt;
:I arise today
:Through a mighty strength, the invocation of the Trinity,
:Through a belief in the Threeness,
:Through confession of the Oneness
:Of the Creator of creation.&lt;/poem&gt;

Linguists cannot trace this lorica back further than the eighth century, which raises the question of whether it was based on an earlier poem dating back to the time of St. Patrick (fifth century), or whether it was actually completely unknown to the saint to whom it has been ascribed.

== Lorica of St Fursey (or Fursa) ==
The Lorica of St Fursa dates from the early seventh century and is still a popular prayer in Ireland. The original text of the Fursey Lorica is held in the British Library. The translation, from Old Irish and German, was made by Fr Francis Mullaghy CSSR and Fr Richard Tobin CSSR, for use in St Joseph&#x27;s Monastery, Dundalk, County Louth. This Lorica translation is quoted by John Ó Ríordáin (3) and begins:
&lt;poem&gt;The arms of God be around my shoulders,
The touch of the Holy Spirit upon my head,
The sign of Christ’s cross upon my forehead,
The sound of the Holy Spirit in my ears,&lt;/poem&gt;

==Caim==
A &quot;caim&quot; is similar to a lorica, being a type of protection prayer. The word &quot;caim&quot; possibly derives from Scottish Gaelic as listed in the Carmina Gadelica meaning &quot;loop, curve, circle, or sanctuary&quot;. English lexicographer Edward Dwelly&#x27;s dictionary of Scottish Gaelic lists &quot;sf Stain, blot, fault. 2(AC) Loop, curve, circle, sanctuary, guard, imaginary circle described with the hand round himself by a person in fear, danger or distress.&quot;

The Carmina Gadelica does not contain liturgical rubrics, nor is there a ritual action described that accompanies the prayer. However, one usage of a caim prayer involves the creation of an invisible circle around the self with the index finger while the individual turns round.

One prayer that is used can be found in the Carmina Gadelic with additions, and by tradition is often attributed to St. Columba:
&lt;poem&gt;Be to me a bright flame before me
Be to me a guiding star above me,
Be to me a smooth path below me,
Be to me a kind shepherd behind me,
Today, tonight, and forever.&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="1066910" wikidata="Q114893760" url="?curid=1066910" title="Johnson Street Bridge">
<text>The Johnson Street Bridge is a bascule bridge spanning the Victoria Harbour in Victoria, British Columbia. Four known bridges have spanned the narrows between Victoria&#x27;s Inner Harbour and Upper Harbour, connecting Johnson Street on the east shore with Esquimalt Road on the west shore. The current bridge is Canada&#x27;s largest single-leaf bascule bridge. It carries three vehicular traffic lanes, with a pedestrian walkway on its south side, and a multi-use pathway on its north side. The bridge is lit with blue LED lighting as a homage to its predecessor, which was referred to as the &quot;Blue Bridge&quot;.

== History ==
The first bridge connecting the west and east shores of the Victoria Harbour was a low wagon bridge, completed in 1855. The bridge blocked marine traffic, and was ultimately dismantled seven years later in 1862 and replaced with a ferry service.

A second bridge, for rail and foot traffic only, was constructed in 1888. This hand-operated swing bridge of limited load capacity was in operation until 1923.
=== Third bridge, 1924–2018 ===
The third Johnson Street Bridge, completed in 1924, was built as two adjacent, independent, heel trunnion bascule bridges. It later became referred to as the &quot;Blue Bridge&quot; or &quot;Old Blue&quot;, after it was painted a light blue colour following corrosion repairs in the late 1970s. 

==== Background and construction ====
The third Johnson Street Bridge was designed under the direction of city engineer Mr. F. M. Preston in 1920. The Strauss Bascule Bridge Company, which held the patents on the design, prepared the plans for the bascule spans and the operating machinery. The superstructure of the bridge was fabricated in Walkerville, Ontario of 100 tons of steel. The sub-structure was built by the City of Victoria Engineering Department and required of concrete. The bridge was constructed to carry a three-lane road span of , and a single-track rail span of . The approaches were fixed steel girders; the east was and the west was . Counterweights were made of hollow concrete weighing . Its operating struts were moved by pinions powered by electric motors. The bridge was completed at a cost of $918,000 (27 percent higher than the estimated cost of $720,000) and opened in January 1924.

==== Modifications and use ====
The bridge originally had street car rails running down the center of the road span, but they were never used, and were removed a few years after opening. In 1966, the wood deck was replaced with steel grid, as rainwater absorbed by the deck unbalanced the bridge, straining the lifting gear. 
In 1979, extensive repairs were made to the superstructure, which had become severely corroded. Following these repairs, the bridge was painted blue. The paint was selected because the oxides of its pigment are the same colour as the paint so that little fading of the colour occurs. The City of Victoria had used the same blue paint for the lamp standards throughout the city.

In 1995, abnormally high temperatures caused the steel decking to expand to the point the bridge would not open or close properly. This necessitated the removal of about of the decking.

Daily traffic in 2010 was 30,000 trips a day at peak usage, of which 4000 were pedestrians, 3000 cyclists, and 23,000 vehicles. Until 2011, the rail span for the E&amp;N Railway was used twice a day by the Via Rail Dayliner, for trips up Vancouver Island towards Duncan, Nanaimo and Courtenay.

==== Condition assessment ====
On April 2, 2009, the preliminary results of an overall condition assessment of the Johnson Street Bridge were presented to Victoria City Council. Given the seismic vulnerability of the existing bridge, combined with its heavy use and high volumes of traffic, it was recommended that the bridge either undergo a seismic retrofit or full replacement within 2 to 3 years. After a detailed presentation by City Engineering staff and Delcan engineering consultants, and lengthy discussion by council, the city council gave approval-in-principle on April 23, 2009 to replace the 85-year-old Johnson Street Bridge.

=== Development of a replacement bridge ===

On July 9, 2009, Victoria City Council asked staff to proceed with pursuing a design-build model and developing terms of reference for an advisory panel of community representatives to participate in the Johnson Street Bridge Replacement Project. Later that month, seven residents of Greater Victoria were named to the Johnson Street Bridge Citizen Advisory Committee and City Council awarded the Owner&#x27;s Representative contract to MMM Group Limited to project manage the replacement of the 85-year-old bascule bridge. Victoria City Council was presented on September 8, 2009 with three design concepts for the replacement Johnson Street Bridge. On September 24, 2009, City Council decided on the Rolling Bascule Bridge as the design for the new bridge after reviewing public feedback, recommendations from the Citizens Advisory Committee, and advice from a staff technical committee. On November 19, 2009, the city council voted in favour (4 in favour, 2 against and 2 absent) of an Alternate Approval Process to require a counter petition. If more than 10% of residents would oppose the borrowing bylaw, then the issue would go to a referendum. By the deadline on January 4, 2010, organizers presented a successful counter petition to City Hall, exceeding this 10% threshold.

During October and November 2009, the provincial government declined to contribute to funding the bridge project. A few weeks later the federal government approved a $21 million grant for the replacement project, funding of which came from the Build Canada Fund. In December 2009, a counter petition was launched to force the city to go to a referendum to obtain approval to borrow the further $42 million needed towards the $63 million total cost. In February 2010, the city commissioned MMM Group to prepare a full Class C report on comparable options for both replacement and rehabilitation.

On May 27, 2010, the results of an Ipsos-Reid survey were released, summarizing local resident priorities for the bridge. These priorities included having a dedicated pedestrian walkway, effective lifespan, acceptable cost, dedicated bike lanes, accessibility for other users (i.e., wheelchairs, scooters, strollers, visually impaired), and safety, above heritage value and having a rail crossing. Local business owners did not see a benefit from one bridge option over the other, but concerns over cost and construction issues including potential closures were noted.

On June 11, 2010, Banjar Management&#x27;s Economic Impact Assessment identified economic benefits of the bridge. Negative economic impacts were assessed as follows:
* Downtown Victoria business impairment: Full closure, $10.3 million; one lane open, $5.1 million; two lanes open, $2.6 million
* Vehicle diversion travel time costs: Full closure, $1.6 million; one lane open, $1.0 million; two lanes open, $0.4 million
* Bus diversion costs over one year (two years): Transit Operation Cost, $0.5 million ($1.0 million); transit passenger travel time, $1.0 million ($2.0 million)

On June 14, 2010, MMM Engineering Group made a presentation to council of their report on the rehabilitation and replacement options, including updated cost estimates, revised timelines, and an economic impact study of potential closures and options for different levels of seismic upgrading ($6.5 million, vs. $8.5 million). Refurbishment, with seismic upgrades to $8.5 million as recommended in the report, and a third, new span to be a multi-use bridge, was estimated to cost $103 million. Replacement of the existing structure, with accompanying work on the approaches to the bridge, with priority given to a mix of users including vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists, was estimated to cost $89 million. The MMM Group study was also peer-reviewed by Stantec Consulting Ltd, Victoria, agreeing that the proposed new designs were appropriate, and that the projected costs of either rehabilitation or replacement were reasonable.

On June 17, the city council decided to ask other municipalities to help fund the costs of maintaining the rail link. This would reduce the cost of refurbishment by $23 million, and replacement by $12 million. Long-term planning for commuter rail to the western communities would be affected if the rail line no longer crossed into downtown Victoria, terminating instead in the Victoria West neighbourhood. The deadline for obtaining this funding was August 12, 2010. The city council also voted on this date to update the bridge to a seismic standard of 8.5 magnitude. Information packages and numbered surveys were sent out to all Victoria residents, inviting input up to the August 12 deadline. During the month of July, City of Victoria hosted 2 open houses and bridge tours to provide information on the projects to residents. City staff, engineers, and project managers were present to answer questions.

On August 12, 2010, Victoria city councillors voted to replace the Johnson Street Bridge, rather than refurbish the existing bridge. The vote was done after tours, open houses, and surveys were done to inform residents of Victoria of the options. An Ipsos-Reid survey found that 64% and 68% of residents and businesses respectively preferred replacing the bridge with a new one. On November 20, 2010 the referendum to support the city borrowing money for the cost of the new bridge passed 61% to 39%. The new bridge was scheduled to be completed in 2015, at which time the old bridge would be removed.

==== Closure of rail span ====
On March 31, 2011, the rail span was closed to rail traffic after a routine inspection found corrosion damage on key structural elements. A preliminary estimate of repair costs was $120,000.
The railway span and approaches were removed in February 2012 to make room for the new bridge.

Rail freight service up Store St. to commercial properties on the east side of the Upper Harbour had been discontinued decades before. Since then, the line terminated at a small passenger station beside the bridge. Victoria–Courtenay passenger service was suspended indefinitely in March 2011 due to deteriorating track.

=== Fourth bridge, 2018–present ===
Construction of a rolling bascule bridge beside the third bridge began in 2013, and opened to the public on March 31, 2018. On the same date, the road span of the third bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic, after being closed to vehicular traffic two days earlier. The closing and commissioning ceremony was attended by Victoria City Councillors, mayors from across the Capital Regional District, project managers and engineers for the new bridge, and members of the public. Finally, the road span and approaches of the third bridge were removed during spring 2018.

As of December 31, 2017, actual costs of $96.08 million had been incurred, to an approved budget of $105.06 million.

== Construction ==
The current Johnson Street Bridge took almost six years to complete, and was constructed on the north side of its predecessor. Road re-alignment began in 2011, nearly two years prior to the start of bridge construction. In late 2012, the contract was awarded to PCL Constructors Westcoast Inc.

After construction began in May, 2013, piles were driven to install temporary work platforms on the east and west sides of the channel. Construction of a cofferdam began on the west side of the bridge in September, and the first of the bridge&#x27;s 16 caissons was installed in the harbour in late October. While steel fabrication began overseas in March, 2014, it was halted a few months later when form deficiencies were found following inspection. Steel fabrication resumed in March, 2015, with the first steel shipment finally taking place over a year later in August, 2017.

The bridge affords a three-lane roadway, a pedestrian walkway on the south side, and a multi-use pathway on the north side. Both the pedestrian walkway and multi-use path are cantilevered off of the main span and fully separated from vehicle traffic.

<text>Hannah Duston (also spelled Dustin, Dustan, Durstan, Dustun, Dunstun, or Durstun) (born Hannah Emerson, December 23, 1657 – March 6, 1736, 1737 or 1738) was a colonial Massachusetts Puritan woman who was taken captive by Abenaki people from Quebec during King William&#x27;s War, with her first newborn daughter, during the 1697 raid on Haverhill, in which 27 colonists, 15 of them children, were killed. In her account she stated that the Abenakis killed her newborn baby soon after they were captured. While detained on an island in the Merrimack River in present-day Boscawen, New Hampshire, she killed and scalped ten of the Abenaki family members holding them hostage, with the assistance of two other captives.

Duston&#x27;s captivity narrative became famous more than 100 years after she died. During the 19th century, she was referred to as an American folk hero and the &quot;mother of the American tradition of scalp-hunting.&quot; Some scholars assert Duston&#x27;s story became a legend in the 19th century only because her story was used to justify violence against Native American tribes as innocent, defensive, and virtuous. Duston is believed to be the first American woman honored with a statue.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hannah Emerson was born December 23, 1657, in Haverhill, Massachusetts, to Michael Emerson and Hannah Webster Emerson; she was the oldest of 15 children. At age 20, she married Thomas Duston Jr., a farmer and brick-maker. The Emerson family would later become the subject of attention when Elizabeth Emerson, Hannah&#x27;s younger sister, was hanged for infanticide on June 8, 1693. One of Hannah&#x27;s cousins, Martha Toothaker Emerson, and her father, Roger Toothaker, were accused of practicing witchcraft and tried at the Salem witch trials (1692–93).

===Captivity===
During King William&#x27;s War, Hannah, her husband Thomas, and their nine children, including a newborn baby, lived in Haverhill, Massachusetts. On March 15, 1697, when she was 40 years old, the town was raided by a group of about 30 Abenaki from Quebec. In the attack, 27 colonists were killed (half of them children), and 13 were taken captive, to be either adopted or held as hostages for the French. Hannah&#x27;s husband Thomas, who was building a new brick home about half a mile away, fled with eight of their nine children. The Indians captured Hannah and her nurse, Mary Neff (1646–1722, née Corliss), set fire to Hannah&#x27;s home, and forced the two women to march into the wilderness, Hannah carrying her newborn daughter, Martha. According to the account Hannah gave to Cotton Mather, along the way her captors killed six-day-old Martha by smashing her head against a tree:

About 19 or 20 Indians now led these away, with about half a score of other English captives, but ere they had gone many steps, they dash&#x27;d out the brains of the infant against a tree, and several of the other captives, as they began to tire in the sad journey, were soon sent unto their long home.

Hannah and Mary were assigned to a family group of 12 people (probably Pennacooks) and taken north, &quot;unto a rendezvous...somewhere beyond Penacook, New Hampshire; and they still told these poor women that when they came to this town, they must be stript, and scourg&#x27;d, and run the gauntlet through the whole army of Indians.&quot; The group included Samuel Lennardson (1683–1718, also spelled Leonardson, Lenorson or Lennarson), a 14-year-old boy captured in Worcester, Massachusetts, in late 1695.

===Rebellion and escape===
The captives were taken north to an island in the Merrimack River at the mouth of the Contoocook River, where, during the night of April 29 or 30, while the Indians were sleeping, Hannah led Mary and Samuel in a revolt:

...furnishing themselves with hatchets for the purpose, they struck home such blows upon the heads of their sleeping oppressors, that ere they could any of them struggle...they fell down dead.

Hannah used a hatchet to kill one of the two grown men (Lennardson killed the second), two adult women, and six children. According to Cotton Mather&#x27;s account, Hannah and her partners let one of the children sleep, &quot;intending to bring him away with them,&quot; but the boy awoke and escaped. One severely wounded Abenaki woman also managed to escape the attack.

The former captives immediately left in a canoe, after scalping the dead as proof of the incident and to collect a bounty. They went downriver, traveling only during the night, and after several days reached Haverhill.

===Reward===
A few days later, Thomas Duston brought Hannah, Samuel and Mary to Boston, along with the scalps, the hatchet and a flintlock musket they had taken from the Indians. Although New Hampshire had become a colony in its own right in 1680, the Merrimack River and its adjacent territories were considered part of Massachusetts; therefore, Hannah and the other former captives applied to the Massachusetts Government for the scalp bounty.

Massachusetts had posted a bounty of 50 pounds per scalp in September 1694, which was reduced to 25 pounds in June 1695, and then entirely repealed in December 1696. Wives had no legal status at that time in colonial New England, so her husband petitioned the Legislature on behalf of Hannah Duston, requesting that the bounties for the scalps be paid, even though the law providing for them had been repealed:

The Humble Petition of Thomas Durstan of Haverhill Sheweth That the wife of ye petitioner (with one Mary Neff) hath in her Late captivity among the Barbarous Indians, been disposed &amp; assisted by heaven to do an extraordinary action, in the just slaughter of so many of the Barbarians, as would by the law of the Province which [only] a few months ago, have entitled the actors unto considerable recompense from the Publick. That tho the [want] of that good Law [warrants] no claims to any such consideration from the publick, yet your petitioner humbly [asserts] that the merit of the action still remains the same; &amp; it seems a matter of universal desire thro the whole Province that it should not pass unrecompensed... Your Petitioner, Thomas Durstun

On June 16, 1697, the Massachusetts General Court voted to give them a reward for killing their captors; Hannah Duston received 25 pounds, and Neff and Lennardson split another 25 pounds:

Vote for allowing fifty pounds to Thomas Dustun in behalf of his wife Hannah, and to Mary Neff, and Samuel Leonardson, captives escaped from the Indians, for their service in slaying their captors. Voted, in concurrence with the representatives, that there be allowed and ordered, out of the public treasury, unto Thomas Dunston of Haverhill, on behalf of Hannah his wife, the sum of twenty-five pounds; to Mary Neffe, the sum of twelve pounds ten shillings; and to Samuel Leonardson, the sum of twelve pounds ten shillings...as a reward for their service.

===Later life===
Following her return, Hannah gave birth to a second daughter, Lydia, on October 4, 1698. Her neighbor Hannah Heath Bradley, who had also been abducted in the 1697 raid (and two of her children killed), was held for nearly two years before she was ransomed, returning to Haverhill in 1699. During Queen Anne&#x27;s War Indians raided Haverhill again in 1704 and 1707. In yet another raid on Haverhill (1708), Algonquin and Abenaki Indians led by the French officer Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville killed sixteen, including the town&#x27;s minister.

Although she claimed to have been baptized as a child, Hannah rarely attended church and did not take communion until late in life, for reasons that are unclear. In May 1724 she asked to be formally admitted to the Haverhill Center Congregational Church. Her husband had made a similar petition in January of that year.

Following her husband&#x27;s death (between 1724 and 1732) Hannah Duston is believed to have lived with her son Jonathan on his farm in southwest Haverhill. She probably died between 1736 and 1738, and was most likely buried near Jonathan Duston&#x27;s home.

Samuel Lennardson moved to Preston, Connecticut, to join his father. He married and had five children and died on May 11, 1718. Mary Neff died in Haverhill on October 17, 1722. In 1739 Mary Neff&#x27;s son Joseph was granted two hundred acres of land at Penacook by the General Court of New Hampshire &quot;in consideration of his mother&#x27;s services in assisting Hannah Duston in killing divers Indians.&quot;

===Written accounts===

==== Contemporary accounts ====
The event became well known, due in part to Cotton Mather&#x27;s account in &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana: The Ecclesiastical History of New England&quot; (1702). Mather interviewed Hannah after her return to Haverhill, and on May 6, 1697, he preached a sermon celebrating her return from captivity, with Hannah herself in the audience. He later published the story three times in five years: in &quot;Humiliations follow&#x27;d with Deliverances&quot; (1697), &quot;Decennium Luctuosum&quot; (1699), and in &quot;Magnalia Christi Americana&quot; (1702). Mather titled the story &quot;A Notable Exploit: &quot;Dux Faemina Facti,&quot;&quot; (Latin: &quot;The leader of this deed/exploit was a woman&quot;) and compared Hannah Duston&#x27;s story to the murder of Sisera by Jael in the Old Testament, and to the captivity narratives of Hannah Swarton (captured in 1690) and Mary Rowlandson (captured in 1675). Captivity narratives featuring women were often used as metaphors for the identity struggle evolving in New England at that time, wherein submissive, humble and obedient Puritan women fought to regain their freedom from the oppression of their Indian captors, in the same way that during the American revolution, the long-suffering colonists resisted the oppressive governance by the British crown.

Hannah&#x27;s story also appears in the diary of Samuel Sewall, who had heard the story directly from her on May 12, 1697, less than two weeks after her escape. Sewall&#x27;s account adds the detail that the night before their escape, one of their male captors showed Samuel Lennardson how to take a scalp:

April 29...is signalized by the achievement of Hannah Dustun, Mary Neff, and Samuel Lennerson, who killed two men, their masters, and two women and six others, and have brought in ten scalps...May 12:...Hannah Dustan came to see us; . . . She said her master, whom she kill&#x27;d did formerly live with Mr. Roulandson at Lancaster...The single man shewed the night before, to Saml Lenarson, how he used to knock Englishmen on the head and take off their Scalps; little thinking that the Captives would make some of their first experiment upon himself. Sam. Lenarson kill&#x27;d him.

Hannah&#x27;s story is recorded in the diary of John Marshall (1634–1732), a bricklayer in Quincy, Massachusetts, who wrote the following entry for April 29, 1697:
At the latter end of this month two women and a young lad that had been taken captive from Haverhill in March before, watching their opportunity when the Indians were asleep, killed ten of them, scalped them all and came home to Boston. [They] brought a gun with them and some other things. The chief of these Indians took one of the women captive when she had lain in childbed but a few days, and knocked her child in [the] head before her eyes, which woman killed and scalped that very Indian.

Another reference to Hannah Duston is found in the journal of John Pike (1634–1714, son of New Jersey judge John Pike), in the following entry:

March 15: The Indians fell upon some part of Haverhill, about 7 in the morning, killed and carried away 39 or 40 persons -- two of these Captive women, viz. Dunstan &amp; Neff (with another young man), slew ten of the Indians &amp; returned home w[i]th ye scalps.

Although Hannah herself never provided a written account of her captivity and escape (there is no evidence that she was literate), the Haverhill Historical Society possesses a letter dated May 17, 1724, addressed to the elders of the church, declaring her desire to be admitted as a full member of the church so that she might take communion with the other congregants, and offering a confession. It seems likely to have been composed from dictation by her minister. In reference to her captivity, the letter states simply: 
I am Thankful for my Captivity, twas the Comfortablest time that ever I had; In my Affliction God made his Word Comfortable to me.

====Later renditions====
After Cotton Mather&#x27;s death, Hannah Duston&#x27;s story was largely forgotten until it was included in “&quot;Travels in New England and New York”&quot; by historian Timothy Dwight IV, published in 1821. After this, Duston became more famous in the 19th century as her story was retold by authors like Nathaniel Hawthorne, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau&#x27;s version adheres to information provided in primary sources, whereas Whittier describes her &quot;thirst of revenge...an insatiate longing for blood. An instantaneous change had been wrought in her very nature; the angel had become a demon, —and she followed her captors, with a stern determination to embrace the earliest opportunity for a bloody retribution.&quot; Hawthorne, clearly horrified, pauses in his retelling to exclaim: &quot;But, Oh the children! Their skins are red; yet spare them, Hannah Duston, spare those seven little ones, for the sake of the seven that have fed at your own breast.&quot;

Duston&#x27;s story entered popular imagination along with other tales of violence perpetrated by women, sold as cheap works of short fiction or portrayed on stage in productions intended to appeal to working-class crowds. The rebellion was illustrated in theatrical style in Junius Brutus Stearns&#x27; historical painting, &quot;Hannah Duston Killing the Indians&quot; (1847) in which Stearns, for reasons that remain unclear, depicted Samuel Lennardson as a woman. The Indian children Duston killed are omitted. A second painting, showing Hannah&#x27;s husband fleeing with her children, is now lost. Violent revenge against American Indians was another popular subject of literature and theater, as in Robert Montgomery Bird&#x27;s 1837 novel &quot;Nick of the Woods.&quot;

From the 1820s until the 1870s, Duston&#x27;s story was included in nearly all books about US history, as well as many biographies, children&#x27;s books, and magazine articles. The story was popular among white Americans when the country was engaged in the westward expansion, which increased conflict with the American Indian tribes living in places where American settlers wanted to live.

Later versions of the story added numerous details (including dialogue and the names of the Indians) not found in any primary source, as in Robert Boody Caverly&#x27;s &quot;Heroism of Hannah Duston&quot; (1875). Haverhill tradition, recorded in Mirick&#x27;s &quot;History of Haverhill&quot; (1832), adds the details that Hannah was wearing only one shoe when she was captured, that her daughter was thrown against an apple tree from which local people remembered eating fruit, and that the captives had already started down the river when Hannah insisted that they return to take the Indian scalps.

===Memorials===
There are eight memorials that were or are dedicated to Hannah Duston and the other captives that were with her.

====Aborted first memorial (erected 1861–1865)====
The campaign to build the first monument in Haverhill, Massachusetts, began in 1852, at a time when building public monuments was still a somewhat rare occurrence. The monument chosen was a simple marble column that would cost about $1,350, and by 1861 the necessary funds had been raised. On its base was a shield, surrounded by a musket, bow, arrows, tomahawk, and scalping knife. Engravings on its sides told the story of the &quot;barbarous&quot; murder of Duston&#x27;s baby and her &quot;remarkable exploit;&quot; the column was topped by an eagle. The monument was erected on June 1, 1861, at the site of Duston&#x27;s capture, but it was never fully paid for. Some subscribers were upset that the monument was in the middle of farmland on the outskirts of town instead of Haverhill Common. After successfully suing the association, the builders quietly removed the monument in August 1865, erased the inscription, engraved a new one, and resold it to the town of Barre, Massachusetts, where it stands to this day as a memorial to that town&#x27;s Civil War soldiers.

====First successful memorial (erected 1874)====
Now known as the Hannah Duston Memorial State Historic Site, the first Duston memorial actually executed was sculpted by William Andrews (1836–1927), a marble worker from Lowell, Massachusetts. An attorney named Robert Boody Caverly, author of &quot;The Heroism of Hannah Duston, Together with the Indian Wars of New England&quot; (1875), raised $6,000 from 450 subscribers to erect the 35-foot-tall statue depicting Hannah with a hatchet in one hand and ten scalps in the other. It was dedicated on June 17, 1874, on the island in Boscawen, New Hampshire, where Duston killed her captors. An inscription on the east side reads: 

:The war whoop, tomahawk, faggot &amp; infanticides were at Haverhill 
:The ashes of wigwam-camp-fires at night &amp; of ten of the tribe are here.

A crowd of almost five thousand people overwhelmed the island on the day of its dedication, with speeches presented all day long, culminating with a dedication by New Hampshire Governor James A. Weston. It was the first publicly funded statue in New Hampshire and the first statue in the US to honor an American woman.

Local members of the Cowasuck Band of the Pennacook Abenaki People have proposed adding another statue to the island park to honor fallen Abenaki, in order to &quot;tell a more complete story about New England&#x27;s indigenous peoples.&quot; They also want to erect plaques with historical information on the Merrimack and Contoocook rivers and the old railroad track that runs across to the island.

====Second memorial (erected 1879)====

In 1879, a bronze statue of Hannah Duston grasping a hatchet was created by Calvin H. Weeks (1834–1907) in Haverhill town square (now Grand Army Park), where it still stands on the site of the Haverhill Center Congregational Church, of which Hannah Duston became a member in 1724. It depicts Hannah wearing only one shoe, per Haverhill tradition. 

Over the years, the statue has been repeatedly vandalized, including twice by gunshots to the face. On October 31, 1934, the statue&#x27;s hatchet was stolen, but it was later recovered and welded back into place. On May 6, 2020, the monument was defaced with splashes of red paint. On July 10, 2020, the words &quot;Haverhill&#x27;s own monument to genocide&quot; were found written on the statue&#x27;s base in pink chalk. The statue was vandalized again on August 28, 2020, with splashes of red paint. On Thanksgiving Day, 2021, the statue was again vandalized with either red spray-paint or with splashes of red paint. To prevent further vandalism, city workers draped the statue in a blue plastic tarp, pending cleaning by the highway department.

Some local residents have proposed that the statue should be removed because it promotes harmful stereotypes of warlike Indians. A city council subcommittee was assigned to consider the possibility of moving the statue to another location after a period of public discussion. It has been suggested that the statue be moved to the Buttonwoods Museum or to the Dustin Garrison house, but these institutions indicated they were afraid that this would attract even more vandalism. In April, after several public meetings to consider moving the statue to a less conspicuous site, the City Council voted unanimously not to move it, and to provide space for a memorial honoring Indigenous peoples. Haverhill mayor James Fiorentini subsequently established the Native American Commemorative Task Force to examine the history and culture of the Native peoples of the Haverhill region, and to recommend ways in which the community might honor them.

In May, 2021, the city decided to keep the statue but alter some of the offensive language on the base, remove the hatchet and provide space in the park for a Native American monument, including a memorial to Duston&#x27;s victims and information about Abenaki history. An additional debate is ongoing, over whether the name of the park should be changed. One proposal calls for renaming the New Hampshire site &quot;Unity Park &quot;N&#x27;dakinna&quot;,&quot; which means &quot;our land&quot; in Abenaki.

====Third memorial (1902)====
In 1902 a third memorial was placed by the Daughters of the American Revolution on a small plot of land at Allds and Fifield streets in Nashua, New Hampshire, at the site of John Lovewell&#x27;s home (part of Dunstable, New Hampshire, in Lovewell&#x27;s time), where Hannah, Mary, and Samuel spent the night on their way home from captivity. The stone marker&#x27;s inscription reads:
 On this point of land dwelt John Lovewell, one of the earliest settlers of Dunstable at whose house Hannah Duston spent the night after her escape from the Indians at Penacook Island March 30, 1697. Erected by Matthew Thornton Chapter, DAR 1902

====Fourth memorial (1902)====
In December 1902 a millstone was placed on the shores of the Merrimack River where Hannah, Mary, and Samuel beached their canoe upon their return to Haverhill.

====Fifth memorial (inscribed in 1908)====
The fifth memorial was created in 1908, when an inscription was placed on a boulder in memorial to both Hannah and Martha. The 30-ton glacial erratic rock was pulled out of Bradley Brook where it emptied into the Merrimack, near where Hannah landed her canoe after her escape, and placed on the site of Hannah&#x27;s son Jonathan&#x27;s home in Haverhill, where Hannah had lived during her final years. Hannah Duston died at this location &quot;circa&quot; 1736, 1737 or 1738 and is believed to have been buried nearby. Haverhill public library records say it took 30 horses with 14 drivers to haul the boulder to its present location.

====Leonardson Memorial (1910)====

The Worcester Society of Antiquity sponsored the bronze &quot;Lenorson&quot; tablet (using the spelling they considered correct) and dedicated it on October 22, 1910. The &quot;Worcester Sunday Telegram&quot; reported it was hung on the Davis Tower at Lake Park in Worcester, at the site of the Lenorson boyhood home on the shore of Lake Quinsigamond. It was reported stolen in 1969, just before the tower was demolished, and has not been recovered.

==== Mount Dustan ====
Mount Dustan in Wentworth Location, New Hampshire, was named after Hannah Duston sometime before 1870, using an alternate spelling of her last name.

===Duston hatchet===
The original small axe or hatchet held by Hannah Duston can be found today in the Buttonwoods Museum. The Duston hatchet is not a tomahawk; it is usually called a Biscayan or biscayenne, a common trade item of the late 17th-century New England frontier. It is on display with the knife she allegedly used to scalp her captors, along with her letter of confession petitioning to join the Center Congregational Church of Haverhill.
===Commemorative structures===
Other commemorations, all in the city of Haverhill, include: 
* Dustin House, which Hannah&#x27;s husband Thomas Duston was building at the time of the 1697 raid, was completed in the 1700 and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.
* Haverhill Elementary school was renamed Hannah Dustin Elementary School on July 10, 1911. It closed in the 1980s.
* The Hannah Duston Healthcare Center is located on Monument Street in Haverhill.

<doc id="1066919" wikidata="Q388460" url="?curid=1066919" title="Observatorio metro station (Mexico City)">
<text>Observatorio is an under-reconstruction station on Mexico City Metro Line 1. It is located in the Álvaro Obregón borough of Mexico City, west of the city centre. When operational it is the western terminus of Line 1. Before its shutdown for reconstruction, the station had an average ridership of 72,296 passengers per day, making it the eighth busiest station in the network. 

The station will become the terminal station of Line 12. The station will also connect with Observatorio railway station of the El Insurgente commuter rail system. Since 9 November 2023, part of the Line has remained closed for modernization work on the tunnel and the line&#x27;s technical equipment. Observatorio metro station was mostly demolished by December 2023. The station will be reconstructed to facilitate the access between the Line 1, Line 12 and the El Insurgente stations.

==Name and iconography==
The station logo represents the stylised dome of an astronomical observatory. It is named after an observatory that was built by the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México at the top of a hill near the station. However, due to the light pollution that came as a consequence of urban growth hardly any observations were done in the observatory, and thus it was transformed into a planetarium. Previously on the site was a colonial palace that belonged to the city&#x27;s Bishop.

==General information==
This station is one of the most important metro terminus in the city. It serves Mexico City&#x27;s western bus depot, which connects with areas of western Mexico such as México state, Michoacán, Jalisco, Querétaro and others.

The Observatorio Mexico City Metro station is the 1st station of Line 1 and the Mexico City Metro system. Service at this station began on 10 June 1972. This Mexico City Metro train station is at ground level. The trains take passengers to Tacubaya, Juanacatlán, Chapultepec, Sevilla, Insurgentes, Cuáuhtemoc, Balderas, Salto del Agua, Isabel la Catolica, Pino Suárez, Merced, Candelaria, San Lazaro, Moctezuma, Balbuena, Boulevard Puerto Aéreo, Gómez Farías, Zaragoza, and Pantitlán Mexico City Metro stations.

Originally Line 9 had its plans to end here, even pictograms in Line 1 showed this station as a transfer station for Line 9. But for an unknown reason the station was not built and the Line 9 finished at Tacubaya.

In 2017, Toluca-Mexico City commuter rail started test trains and will enter full service by 2025.

===Ridership===
==Future==

Observatorio will be the eastern terminus for El Insurgente commuter rail when the line commences regular service, projected to begin its service in 2025.

As of March 2021, an extension of Line 12 to Observatorio is under construction, which will connect it with Line 1. The new Line 12 station is expected to open by 2021.

As of 2018, the connection from Line 9 Tacubaya station towards Observatorio is planned, but a completion date has not been announced. This would make Observatorio, together with Tacubaya, Chabacano and Pantitlán, the only transfer stations in the Mexico City Metro network to have connections with three lines, in this case Line 1, Line 9 and Line 12.

In October 2020, Mexico City&#x27;s government announced a project to renovate the Observatorio area and to build a terminal that will allow users to transfer between metro, commuter rail and other public transportation services. It has been projected to be used by a million people every day and will be the most important complex of this type in Latin America. Works are expected to be finished by the end of 2024.

<doc id="1066920" wikidata="Q2606813" url="?curid=1066920" title="Life (Thin Lizzy album)">
<text>Life (subtitled &quot;Live&quot;, and labelled &quot;Life:Live&quot; on the original vinyl LP editions) is a double live album by Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 1983. This double album was recorded during their farewell tour in 1983, principally at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, UK. Phil Lynott had felt reluctantly that it was time to disband the group after the 1983 tour and to mark the occasion, former Thin Lizzy guitarists Eric Bell (1969–73), Brian Robertson (1974–78) and Gary Moore (1974, 1977 and 1978–79) joined the band on stage at the end of these gigs to do some numbers. This was called &quot;The All-Star Jam&quot;.

The versions of &quot;Renegade&quot;, &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Killer on the Loose&quot; featuring Snowy White had been performed two years earlier when he was still with the band. White&#x27;s participation was only credited to &quot;Renegade&quot;.

Lynott described the slower tempo version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe a Word&quot; as being the original arrangement. A version of the song with the slower arrangement appears on Moore&#x27;s &quot;Back on the Streets&quot; album from 1978, with Lynott on bass guitar and lead vocals and Brian Downey on drums.

During the performance of &quot;The Rocker&quot;, all of the guitarists (except for White) played at the same time (Moore, John Sykes, Scott Gorham, Robertson and Bell), making a total of eight members on stage performing at once (including keyboard player Darren Wharton).

<text>Travels with Charley: In Search of America is a 1962 travelogue written by American author John Steinbeck. It depicts a 1960 road trip around the United States made by Steinbeck, in the company of his standard poodle Charley. Steinbeck wrote that he was moved by a desire to see his country because he made his living writing about it. He wrote of having many questions going into his journey, the main one being &quot;What are Americans like today?&quot; However, he found that he had concerns about much of the &quot;new America&quot; he saw.

Steinbeck tells of traveling throughout the United States in a specially made camper he named Rocinante, after Don Quixote&#x27;s horse. His travels start in Long Island, New York, and roughly follow the outer border of the United States, from Maine to the Pacific Northwest, down into his native Salinas Valley in California across to Texas, through the Deep South, and then back to New York. Such a trip encompassed nearly 10,000 miles.

According to Thom Steinbeck, the author&#x27;s oldest son, the reason for the trip was that Steinbeck knew he was dying and wanted to see his country one last time. The younger Steinbeck has said he was surprised that his stepmother allowed his father to make the trip; his heart condition meant he could have died at any time. A new introduction to the 50th anniversary edition of the book cautioned readers that &quot;it would be a mistake to take this travelogue too literally, as Steinbeck was at heart a novelist.&quot;

==Summary==
===Part One===
Steinbeck opened the book by describing his lifelong wanderlust and his preparations to rediscover the country he felt he had lost touch with after living in New York City and traveling in Europe for 20 years. He was 58 years old in 1960 and nearing the end of his career, but he felt that when he was writing about America and its people he &quot;was writing of something [he] did not know about, and it seemed to [him] that in a so-called writer this is criminal&quot; (p. 6). He bought a new GMC pickup truck, which he named Rocinante, and had it fitted with a custom camper-shell for his journey. At the last minute, he decided to take his wife&#x27;s 10-year-old French Poodle Charley, with whom he has many mental conversations as a device for exploring his thoughts. He planned on leaving after Labor Day from his summer home in Sag Harbor on the eastern end of Long Island, but his trip was delayed about two weeks due to Hurricane Donna, which made a direct hit on Long Island. Steinbeck&#x27;s exploits in saving his boat during the middle of the hurricane, which he details, foreshadow his fearless, or even reckless, state of mind and his courage in undertaking a long, arduous and ambitious cross-country road trip by himself.

===Part Two===
Steinbeck began his trip by traveling by ferry from Long Island to Connecticut, passing the U.S. Navy submarine base at New London where many of the new nuclear submarines were stationed. He talked to a sailor stationed on a sub who enjoyed being on them because &quot;they offer all kinds of – future&quot;. Steinbeck credited uncertainty about the future to rapid technological and political changes. He mentioned the wastefulness of American cities and society and lamented the large amount of waste that resulted from everything being &quot;packaged.&quot;

Later he had a conversation with a New England farmer. The two concluded that a combination of fear and uncertainty about the future limited their discussion of the coming election between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. Steinbeck enjoyed learning about people by eating breakfast in roadside restaurants and listening to morning radio programs, though he noted that, &quot;If &#x27;Teen-Age Angel&#x27; [sic] is top of the list in Maine, it is the top of the list in Montana&quot; (35), showing the ubiquity of pop culture brought on by Top 40 radio and mass media technologies.

He drove north into Maine. On the way he noted a similarity among the &quot;summer&quot; stores, which were all closed for the winter. Antique shops sold old &quot;junk&quot; that Steinbeck would have bought if he thought he had room for it, noting that he had more junk at home than most stores. He stopped at a little restaurant just outside the town of Bangor where he learned that other people&#x27;s sour attitudes about life can greatly affect your own attitude. Steinbeck then went to Deer Isle, Maine, to visit the friend of his literary agent Elizabeth Otis, who vacationed there each summer. Otis always raved about Deer Isle, but could never describe exactly what it was that was so captivating. While driving to Deer Isle, Steinbeck stopped and asked for directions. He later learned from a native that it wasn&#x27;t wise to ask for directions in Maine because locals don&#x27;t like to talk to tourists and tend to give them incorrect information. When Steinbeck arrived at the house on Deer Isle where he was supposed to stay, he met a terse female cat named George and ate the best lobster he had ever tasted, fresh from the local waters. Next, he drove to northern Maine, where he spent the night in a field alongside a group of French-speaking migrant potato pickers from Canada, with whom he shared some French vintage. Steinbeck&#x27;s descriptions of the workers was sympathetic and even romanticized, a clear nod to his amazing description of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; which made him famous.

Steinbeck then traveled west across Upstate New York to Niagara Falls and Buffalo, then on to Chicago by way of western New York and the northern tops of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana. At the Canadian border in Niagara Falls he decided not to cut across southern Ontario to get to Detroit faster, as he planned, because Charley didn&#x27;t have the proper inoculations to get back in the USA. After his encounter with American border officials, he discussed his dislike of the government. He said the government makes a person feel small because it doesn&#x27;t matter what you say, if it&#x27;s not on paper and certified by an official, the government doesn&#x27;t care. As he traveled on, he described how wherever he went people&#x27;s attitudes and beliefs changed. All states differ by how people may talk to one another or treat other people. For example, as he drove into the Midwest there was a marked increase in the population from state to state. Instead of small New England villages he was skirting the growing cities of great production such as Youngstown, Cleveland, Akron, Toledo, South Bend and Gary. The roads, specifically U.S. 20 and the stretch of Interstate 90 between Buffalo and Madison, Ohio, were wider and faster and filled with traffic. Also, everywhere he went, people&#x27;s views changed. For example, when he was in New England he saw that people there spoke tersely and usually waited for the newcomer to come up to him and initiate conversation. However, in Midwestern cities, people were more outgoing and were willing to come right up to him. He explained how strangers talked freely without caution as a sense of longing for something new and being somewhere other than the place they were. They were so used to their everyday life that when someone new came to town, they were eager to explore new information and imagine new places. It was as if a new change had entered their life every time someone from out of town came into their state.

Traveling further, Steinbeck discovered that technology was advancing so quickly as to give Americans more and more instant gratification, whether it was soup from vending machines or mobile homes. Steinbeck was intrigued by mobile homes. He thought they showed a new way of living for America, reflecting the attitude that if you don&#x27;t like a given place, you should be able to pick up and leave. He reflects on rootedness, finds much to admire both ways, going and staying, and finds a secret language and camaraderie among truckers. At the end of the section, Steinbeck arrives in Chicago to meet up with his wife. After dropping off Charley at a groomer&#x27;s, he gets to his hotel early and finds his room not ready yet. Being tired and scruffy, he makes a deal with the hotel to borrow a room which hasn&#x27;t been cleaned up after its last occupant, and once in the room investigates what the previous tenant, whom he refers to as &quot;Harry,&quot; has left behind, constructing a half-grounded, half-fictional idea of him as a traveling businessman who hires a woman to spend the evening with, though Steinbeck believes neither enjoyed their time that much.

===Part Three===
Steinbeck traveled across Wisconsin and Minnesota toward North Dakota. He traveled along U.S. Highway 10 through St. Paul on an &quot;Evacuation Route&quot; that would be used in the case of a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. He called it &quot;a road designed by fear&quot; (p. 129) and it sparked one of Steinbeck&#x27;s many realizations about American society: the fact that the country was driven by fear. Once through St. Paul, he went to Sauk Centre, the birthplace of writer Sinclair Lewis, but was disheartened to talk to locals at a restaurant who had no understanding of who Lewis was.

Stopping at a diner for directions, Steinbeck realized that Americans are often oblivious to their immediate surroundings and their own culture. He also complained that Americans have put &quot;cleanliness first at the expense of taste&quot; (141). He lamented that &quot;It looks as though the natural contentiousness of people has died&quot; (142) and he worried that Americans had grown too comfortable and no longer interested in risk-taking and rebellion, two of the traits that made the country great. Crossing into North Dakota, Steinbeck said that Fargo always fascinated him as a place where the winters were (seemingly) colder and the summers hotter than anywhere else. He found the real Fargo to be just like any other busy American town, but said the reality of Fargo didn&#x27;t interfere with his old mental image of Fargo. Driving across North Dakota, Steinbeck decided that the real dividing line between east and west was at the Missouri River. East of the river, odors and scenes were essentially &quot;eastern&quot;; west of the river was where &quot;The West&quot; really started. Steinbeck crossed North Dakota into Montana, where he declared, &quot;I am in love with Montana.&quot; He explained Montana was a place unaffected by television; a place with kind, laid-back individuals. &quot;It seemed to me that the frantic bustle of America was not in Montana (158).&quot; He went to the battlefield of Little Big Horn. He traveled through the &quot;Injun Country&quot; and thought of an author who wrote a novel about the war against the Nez Perce tribes. Steinbeck and Charley then traveled to Yellowstone National Park, a place packed with natural wonders that he said &quot;is no more representative of America than Disneyland.&quot; In the park the gentle and non-confrontational Charley showed a side of himself Steinbeck had never seen: Charley&#x27;s canine instincts caused him to bark like crazy at the bears he saw by the side of the road.

The pair next stopped briefly at the Great Divide in the Rocky Mountains before continuing on to Seattle. Steinbeck reflected on seeing the Columbia River and how the American explorers Lewis and Clark must have felt when they came west for the first time. He noted the changes the West Coast had undergone in the last 20 years (p. 180): &quot;It was only as I approached Seattle that the unbelievable change became apparent...I wonder why progress looks so much like destruction.&quot; (181) Steinbeck then drove down the Pacific Coast through Oregon and California. On the way, Rocinante, Steinbeck&#x27;s overloaded truck, had a flat tire and he had to change it in a rainstorm. In Steinbeck&#x27;s retelling of the event, he wrote, &quot;It was obvious that the other tire might go at any minute, and it was Sunday and it was raining and it was Oregon.&quot; (185) Though the specialized tires were hard to come by, the problem was resolved in mere hours by the unexpected generosity of a gas station attendant.

Steinbeck then visited the giant redwood trees he had come to appreciate and adore in his lifetime. He said &quot;The vainest, most slap-happy and irreverent of men, in the presence of redwoods, goes under a spell of wonder and respect.&quot; (189) When Charley refuses to urinate on the trees (a &quot;salute&quot; for a dog, as Steinbeck remarks), Steinbeck opines: &quot;&#x27;If I thought he did it out of spite or to make a joke,&#x27; I said to myself, &#x27;I&#x27;d kill him out of hand.&#x27;&quot; (193)

Steinbeck grew up in the Salinas Valley region of California in Monterey County and he describes his revisit to the area after a 20-year absence in detail. Remarking on the many changes, he notes the population growth and the progress the Monterey area had made. He then visited a bar from his youth where he met his old friend Johnny Garcia and learned that a lot of regulars and childhood chums had died. He then seemed to say goodbye to his hometown, on pages 205 to 208, for the last time, making an allusion to &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home Again, a book by Thomas Wolfe.&quot; Climbing Fremont Peak, the highest point in what would someday be called &quot;Steinbeck Country,&quot; he said goodbye to the place he had made famous in his novels. &quot;I printed once more on my eyes, south, west, and north, and then we hurried away from the permanent and changeless past where my mother is always shooting a wildcat and my father is always burning his name with his love.&quot; (208).

===Part Four===
Heading east again, Steinbeck then cut through the Mojave Desert, where he almost decided to shoot a pair of curious coyotes (but didn&#x27;t). Reflecting on the resiliency of desert life, he opened a can of dog food for the coyotes instead. He made his way to Texas, where he and his wife Elaine attended what he called a Thanksgiving Day &quot;orgy&quot; at a wealthy cattle ranch near Amarillo. Steinbeck, whose third wife Elaine was a Texan, talked at length about the Lone Star State and its citizens and culture. He felt that &quot;people either passionately love or passionately hate Texas,&quot; which he described as a &quot;mystique closely approximating a religion,&quot; but he loved and respected Texas.

After detailing his Thanksgiving at the ranch, Steinbeck drove to New Orleans where he witnessed the angry and racist protests by white mothers outside the recently integrated William Frantz Elementary School in the Ninth Ward. The encounter depressed him.

By the time Steinbeck nears Virginia, he says that in his heart, his journey was over. His journey had ceased to be a journey and became something that he had to endure until he reached his home in New York again. After passing through Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Steinbeck finds himself back in New York where, ironically, he realizes that he is lost and has to ask for directions home. As he spent a good deal of his journey lost, it becomes evident at the end of the story that being lost is a metaphor for how much America has changed in Steinbeck&#x27;s eyes. America, it seems, is in a sense directionless and is therefore endangered as it moves into an uncertain future marked by huge population shifts, racial tensions, technological and industrial change, and unprecedented environmental destruction.

==Best seller==
&quot;Travels With Charley&quot; was published by the Viking Press in mid-1962, a few months before Steinbeck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. The book reached #1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list (Non-Fiction) on October 21, 1962, where it stayed for one week, replaced by Rachel Carson&#x27;s &quot;Silent Spring&quot; on October 28.

==In the arts==
In the Steinbeck novel &quot;The Pastures of Heaven&quot;, one of the characters regards Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes&quot; as one of the single greatest works of English literature and eventually names his infant son Robert Louis. Later, Steinbeck and his wife Elaine were inspired by Stevenson in choosing the title &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;.

In 2010 the Dutch journalist and author Geert Mak traveled the same route Steinbeck had followed, basing himself on the notes from Steinbeck&#x27;s diary as well as the book. Mak wrote a book about it, called &quot;Reizen zonder John&quot; (translation from Dutch: &quot;Traveling without John&quot;). He reviews American society and comments on the changes he encounters since Steinbeck traveled the same parts of the country.

In 2018 Minnesota-based Bluegrass group Trampled by Turtles released a track entitled &quot;Thank you, John Steinbeck.&quot; This track references the book with the lines: &quot;I left in a hurry, my clothes barely buttoned/ And &#x27;Travels With Charley&#x27; tucked under my arm.&quot;

In 1973 The Beach Boys wrote a song for their Holland album called California Saga a three part song with the following lyrics: [Verse 2]
Have you ever been down Salinas way
Where Steinbeck found the valley?
And he wrote about it the way it was
in his travelin&#x27;s with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be?
There, the monarch&#x27;s autumn journey ends
On a windswept cypress tree

==Criticism==
Steinbeck&#x27;s narrative has been challenged as partly fictionalized. Bill Steigerwald, a former staff writer for &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; and an associate editor for &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;, followed the route as it is laid out in the &quot;Travels with Charley,&quot; and wrote about it in a 2011 article titled &quot;Sorry, Charley,&quot; published in &quot;Reason&quot; magazine. He later self-published his analysis in a 2012 book, titled &quot;Dogging Steinbeck&quot;. Steigerwald concluded that &quot;Travels&quot; contains such a level of invention, and Steinbeck took such great liberty with the truth, that the work has limited claim to being non-fiction.

He uses the dialogue with the itinerant Shakespearean actor near Alice, North Dakota, to exemplify his point. On October 12, Steinbeck wrote a letter to his wife describing a motel in the Badlands where he was staying, on the same date (October 12) as the supposed conversation in Alice. Given that the Badlands are some 350 miles away from Alice, Steigerwald concluded that the conversation with the actor was unlikely to have occurred. Steigerwald also challenges the idea that Steinbeck was &quot;roughing it&quot; during his journey, or that it was a solo voyage, save for Charley. Steigerwald wrote:

Steigerwald was not the only person to claim Steinbeck did not write a purely nonfictional travelogue; Steinbeck&#x27;s son believed that his father invented much of the dialogue in the book, saying: &quot;He just sat in his camper and wrote all that [expletive].&quot;

Steinbeck scholars generally have not disputed Steigerwald&#x27;s findings, but they have disputed their importance.

For example, Susan Shillinglaw, a professor of English at San Jose State University and scholar at the National Steinbeck Center, told the &quot;New York Times&quot;: &quot;Any writer has the right to shape materials, and undoubtedly Steinbeck left things out. That doesn&#x27;t make the book a lie.&quot; In regard to the supposed conversations, she said: &quot;Whether or not Steinbeck met that actor where he says he did, he could have met such a figure at some point in his life. And perhaps he enhanced some of the anecdotes with the waitress. Does it really matter that much?&quot;

Jay Parini, author of a Steinbeck biography, who wrote the introduction for the Penguin edition of &quot;Travels&quot;, told the &quot;New York Times&quot;:
Bill Barich, who wrote &quot;Long Way Home: On the Trail of Steinbeck&#x27;s America&quot;, also a retracing of Steinbeck&#x27;s footsteps, said:
Writer Geert Mak, who made the same trip in 2010, discovered factual inconsistencies and physical impossibilities when trying to replicate Steinbeck&#x27;s traveling schedule. He too came to the conclusion that Steinbeck had probably invented much of what happened, only to give rise to his musings about the country, which the Dutch writer nevertheless considered to be truthful and valuable.

Published in 2012, the 50th anniversary edition of &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; included a disclaimer by Parini, who wrote:

<text>Insurgentes is an under-reconstruction station on the Line 1 of Mexico City Metro. It is located within the Glorieta de los Insurgentes at the intersection of Avenida de los Insurgentes and Avenida Chapultepec in Mexico City&#x27;s Cuauhtémoc borough, close to the Zona Rosa shopping and entertainment district and the Colonia Roma, two of the most iconic neighborhoods in the city. In 2019, the station had an average ridership of 65,134 passengers per day, making it the 12th busiest station in the network. Since 9 November 2023, the station has remained closed for modernization work on the tunnel and the line&#x27;s technical equipment.

==Name and pictogram==
Insurgentes receives its name from Avenida de los Insurgentes, one of Mexico City&#x27;s most important thoroughfares, the station is located under the intersection of Insurgentes and Avenida Chapultepec.

The station pictogram depicts the church bell of Dolores Hidalgo, a symbol of the start of the Mexican War of Independence (1810) and the eleven-year-long insurgency that followed.

==General information==
Metro Insurgentes was built in a particular style. Surrounding the station is a circular shopping mall-cum-plaza, called the Glorieta de los Insurgentes. The station&#x27;s exterior walls are intended to evoke pre-Hispanic architecture, while the platform walls are decorated with mock-ups of platforms from the Paris Métro and the London Underground. The station was opened on 5 September 1969. Exterior shots of the plaza and metro entrance were used in the 1990 motion picture &quot;Total Recall&quot;.

This is an important station for bus transfers, connecting with an extensive local network of urban buses (RTP, or Red de Transporte de Pasajeros) that serves zones like Villa Olímpica and Tlalpan, south of the city, and Metro Indios Verdes, north of the city. The Insurgentes Metrobús bus rapid transit line also has a stop in the vicinity of Metro Insurgentes.

In recent years, the Glorieta de los Insurgentes (and, therefore, the station itself), has been a meeting and starting point for some social and political rallies; for example, in December 2019, it was used as a meeting point for several feminist rallies.

The station serves the following neighborhoods: Colonia Juárez and Colonia Roma Norte.

<text>Pantitlán metro station is a Mexico City Metro transfer station in the boroughs of Iztacalco and Venustiano Carranza, in Mexico City. The station features a combination of underground, at-grade, and elevated buildings. It has six island platforms and two side platforms, serving Lines 1 (the Pink Line), 5 (the Yellow Line), 9 (the Brown Line), and A (the Purple Line). Pantitlán metro station is the only quadra-line interchange station in the system. It serves as the terminal station for all lines and is followed by Zaragoza (Line 1), Hangares (Line 5), Puebla (Line 9), and Agrícola Oriental (Line A) metro stations.

Pantitlán metro station opened on 19 December 1981 with northwestward service toward Consulado on Line 5; westward service toward Observatorio on Line 1 began on 22 August 1984; westward service toward Centro Médico on Line 9 started on 26 August 1987; and southeastward service toward La Paz on Line A commenced on 12 August 1991. The station services the (neighborhoods) of Ampliación Adolfo López Mateos, Aviación Civil, and Pantitlán, and is named after the last one. It is located along Avenida Miguel Lebrija and Avenida Río Churubusco. The station&#x27;s pictogram features the silhouettes of two flagpoles with blank flags, reflecting the meaning of &quot;Pantitlán,&quot; which is &quot;between flags&quot; in Nahuatl.

The station facilities offer partial accessibility for people with disabilities as there are elevators, wheelchair ramps, tactile pavings, and braille signage plates. Inside, there is a cultural display, an Internet café, a women&#x27;s defense module, a public ministry office, a health module, a mural, and a bicycle parking station. Outside, the station includes a transport hub servicing local bus routes. Pantitlán is the busiest station in the system. In 2019, before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transport, the station recorded a ridership of 132,845,471 passengers. In comparison, Cuatro Caminos metro station, which ranked second, had 39,378,128 passengers. Out of all the passengers at Pantitlán, 45,550,938 accessed Line A, making it the busiest line when considered individually.

The station area has experienced subsidence issues since the 1990s, primarily due to the extraction of groundwater to meet the needs of the large population in eastern Mexico City and the metropolitan area. From July 2022 to October 2023, the Line 1 station was closed for upgrades to the tunnel and technical equipment. Between December 2023 and September 2024, the Line 9 station was closed for releveling of the elevated bridge due to continued subsidence.

==Location and layout==

Pantitlán is a metro transfer station situated on Avenida Miguel Lebrija and Avenida Río Churubusco in the boroughs of Iztacalco and Venustiano Carranza, in eastern Mexico City. The station serves three (neighborhoods), Ampliación Adolfo López Mateos, Aviación Civil, and Pantitlán. The station was named after Colonia Pantitlán, which means &quot;between flags&quot; in Nahuatl. During the Aztec era, the area, formerly part of Lake Texcoco, was marked with flagpoles to warn canoeists of dangerous currents. The station&#x27;s pictogram features the silhouette of two flagpoles with blank flags.

Pantitlán metro station functions as the terminal station of Lines 1, 5, 9, and A. It is followed by Zaragoza station on Line 1, Hangares station on Line 5, Puebla station on Line 9, and Agrícola Oriental station on Line A. Pantitlán metro station provides disabled-accessible services featuring elevators on Lines 1 and A, wheelchair ramps and escalators on Line 9, and tactile pavings and braille signage plates on Lines 1, 9 and A.

Pantitlán metro station has multiple exits serving its various lines. The exit for Line 1 is located to the west and provides access to Avenida Miguel Lebrija and Calle Alberto Braniff in Colonia Aviación Civil, Venustiano Carranza. For Line 5, there are two exits: the northern exit is situated along Calle Alberto Braniff in Colonia Aviación Civil, while the southern exit is positioned on Avenida Miguel Lebrija, also in Colonia Aviación Civil.

Line 9 has two exits as well. The western exit can be found along Avenida Río Churubusco in Colonia Ampliación Adolfo López Mateos, Venustiano Carranza. The eastern exit is located at the corner of Avenida Miguel Lebrija and Calle 2ª Cerrada de Río Churubusco in Colonia Pantitlán, Iztacalco.

Lastly, Line A offers three exits. The northern exit is at the corner of Avenida Río Churubusco and Calle Talleres Gráficos in Colonia Ampliación Adolfo López Mateos, Venustiano Carranza. The northwestern exit is situated on Avenida Río Churubusco and Calle Guadalupe Victoria, within the same neighborhood. The southern exit is also along Avenida Río Churubusco, but in Colonia Pantitlán, Iztacalco.

The area is serviced by a (CETRAM), which functions as a transport hub for connecting various modes of transportation. It supports the Metrobús (Line 4), Mexibús (Line III) and trolleybus (Line 2) systems. Additionally, the hub is serviced by Routes 11-B, 11-C, 19-F, and 19-G of the city&#x27;s public bus system (locally known as ), and by Route 168 of the bus network. Over 3,600 transport units operated in the hub as of 2010. By 2016, it was estimated to be the most used CETRAM in the country. Pantitlán is also the nearest metro station to Terminal 2 of the Mexico City International Airport, situated around away.

==History and construction==

The architects of Pantitlán metro station were Aurelio Nuño Morales and Isaac Broid. Originally, Line 8, which runs from the historic center of Mexico City to Constitución de 1917 metro station in Iztapalapa, was planned to run from Pantitlán to Indios Verdes station, in Gustavo A. Madero, northern Mexico City. However, the project was canceled due to potential structural issues near the Zócalo area, where it was intended to interchange with Line 2 at Zócalo metro station.

===Line 1===
The line was built by Ingeniería de Sistemas de Transportes Metropolitano, Electrometro, and Cometro, the latter being a subsidiary of Empresas ICA. Its first section was inaugurated on 4 September 1969, operating from Zaragoza towards Chapultepec station. It opened to the general public the following day. An eastward extension toward Pantitlán opened on 22 August 1984, operating westward towards Observatorio metro station and connecting Lines 1 and 5. Before Pantitlán was opened, Zaragoza served as the terminal for Line 1, and the workshops are located between both stations. This positioning indirectly benefited operations by allowing trains to depart every 90 seconds to either station. Pantitlán is an underground metro station with an interstation tunnel to Zaragoza measuring . The passenger transfer tunnel connecting Line 1 with Line A is approximately long, making it the third-longest in the system, after those at Atlalilco and La Raza stations.

In 2016, the station underwent renovation work. The station was closed on 11 July 2022 for modernization work on the tunnel and technical equipment of the line. After fifteen months of renovations, authorities reopened Pantitlán station on 29 October 2023. &quot;Excélsior&quot; reported in July 2024 that all the modernized stations had leaks of varying dimensions, despite authorities having stated they would seal them during the repairs.

===Line 5===
Cometro built the line and its first section was opened on 19 December 1981, with operations extending toward Consulado station. Pantitlán is an at-grade metro station where the segment between it and Hangares station transitions from street level to underground. This section is long.

Remains of mammoths, fish, and birds were discovered during its construction.

===Line 9===
Cometro built the line and its first section was opened on 26 August 1987, with service toward Centro Médico station. Pantitlán is an elevated metro station with a long bridge connecting it to Puebla station. Additionally, there is a train shed after the station. During the station&#x27;s construction, a tusk and a molar of a mammoth were discovered at a depth of .

===Line A===
Empresas ICA built the line and it was opened on 12 August 1991, operating towards La Paz station, in the municipality of the same name of the State of Mexico. It is the line&#x27;s only underground station as the trains pass below the Line 5 tracks. To build the station, ICA used the Milan method to construct a false rectangular-shaped tunnel. The company added floor slabs and the ceiling is made up of pre-fabricated slabs. Above the ceiling, pavement was installed as needed.

Pantitlán is a light metro station with its first segment to Agrícola Oriental station measuring in length. As the line incorporates Calzada Ignacio Zaragoza Avenue, it transitions to street level.

From its opening until 12 December 2013, passengers transferring from Line A to other lines, and vice versa, were required to make two separate payments.

===Landmarks===

Inside the station, there is a cultural display, an Internet café, a women&#x27;s defense module, and a health module. Outside the station, a public ministry office was established in 2002 to reduce criminal offenses within the station. On 1 May 2007, the system unveiled the mural &quot;Alegoría a la Ciudad de México y el Sistema de Transporte Colectivo&quot; (), painted by José Luis Elías Jáuregui. According to him, he was inspired by the country&#x27;s history, painting various elements that symbolize it, such as the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanoes, an eagle devouring a snake (a reference to the national coat of arms), a pyramid, and a Mestiza holding a white dove. The acrylic-on-canvas artwork, which is wide, honors the metro workers by featuring four train models used by the system. In 2014, the Government of Mexico City built a bicycle parking station adjacent to the CETRAM.

==Incidents==
===Sinking issues===
Sinking reports have existed since at least 1998. By 2016, the system reported cracks and subsidence that were expected to take about five years to resolve. Following the collapse of the elevated railway near Olivos metro station on Line 12 in May 2021, users reported structural damage at other elevated stations, including Pantitlán metro station. Claudia Sheinbaum, the then-head of government of Mexico City, said that these reports would be examined appropriately.

According to a LatinUS investigation, Sheinbaum&#x27;s government commissioned Constructores ICI in September 2022 to study and identify solutions for the structural problems of the bridge, particularly the Pantitlán–Puebla bridge. The firm recommended 539 actions, with the most significant being:

* The overhead track between Pantitlán and Puebla stations should be demolished and rebuilt.
* A section of the bridge along Río Churubusco Avenue should be re-leveled and refurbished.
* Maintenance and replacement are needed for the line&#x27;s overpass equipment.
* Reinforcement is required for the buildings and structures at Pantitlán and Puebla stations.
* Replace all electrical material, 520 ties, 60 rails, and of ballast along the of the elevated viaduct.
* Renew the line&#x27;s centralized control, automatic piloting, signaling, and communication systems.

According to LatinUS, as of August 2023, none of the recommended actions had been performed based on information provided by the city&#x27;s Secretariat of Public Works.

In February 2023, authorities reinforced Line 9&#x27;s overpass near Pantitlán station with metallic supports. After strengthening the bridge, the city government assured that the elevated section was safe. This reinforcement was in line with recommendations from the Institute for Building Safety, which, in April 2022, advised shoring up Gerber beams with support beams.

Because the bridge shoring did not resolve the issues and the sinking persisted, metro authorities announced in September 2023 that three Line 9 stations—Pantitlán, Puebla, and Ciudad Deportiva—would be closed. The repairs were expected to be completed between December 2023 and May 2024. The section reopened on 10 September 2024.

===Other===
From 1 to 16 March 2020, Pantitlán, Hangares and Terminal Aérea stations on Line 5 were closed due to a gasoline leak at a surface petrol station. The Line 9 station was closed from 27 March to 7 April 2021 due to repairs on the section between Velódromo and Ciudad Deportiva station. Platforms M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, and T at the CETRAM were closed on 11 October 2021 due to structural failures detected in the station&#x27;s basement, which houses out-of-service trains.

On 26 January 2022, a man threatened to jump from one of the station&#x27;s line-connecting bridges. A police officer rappeled down to rescue him, but the weight of both individuals caused the rope to break, resulting in a fall of approximately . The fall resulted in severe head trauma for the officer, while the man was unharmed.

==Ridership==

According to the data provided by the authorities, all of Pantitlán&#x27;s platforms rank among the busiest of the system&#x27;s 195 stations when considered individually. Overall, and before the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public transport, the station&#x27;s ridership totaled 132,845,471 passengers (363,960 passengers per day) in 2019. In comparison, the second-busiest station, Cuatro Caminos, registered 39,378,128 passengers.

For Line 1, ridership reached 17,860,457 passengers in 2019, averaging 48,932 per day, representing an increase of 1,874,257 passengers compared to 2018. Line 5 saw a ridership of 36,594,748 passengers, with an average of 100,259 per day, but experienced a decrease of 716,435 passengers from the previous year. Line 9 had 32,839,328 passengers, averaging 89,970 per day, marking an increase of 1,060,592 passengers compared to 2018. For Line A, ridership totaled 45,550,938 passengers, averaging 124,797 per day, which was an increase of 4,700,613 passengers from the previous year.

In 2019, when considered individually, the Line 1 station was the 17th busiest out of 195 stations in the system and the 5th busiest on the line. The Line 5 station ranked as the 4th busiest in the system and was the most used on its line. The Line 9 station was the 5th busiest overall and the busiest on its line. The Line A station was the busiest in the network, a position it held from 2017 to 2021.

As of 2010, approximately 789,000 commuters used the station daily. In the same year, it was estimated that 65 percent of these users came from the State of Mexico. By 2019, user traffic approached 100,000 passengers per hour between 6 and 10 a.m. To manage this high volume and reduce accidents, the system announced measures to distribute passengers more effectively and planned to complete the construction of a ring to connect all the platforms efficiently.

<text>One Night Only is a live album by rock band Thin Lizzy, released in 2000. Thin Lizzy had reformed in 1994 for a series of gigs marking ten years since the band split in 1984. Latter-day Lizzy guitarist John Sykes now took the lead vocal while Marco Mendoza was recruited on bass. The venture was popular enough to be repeated but by the time this album came out, original drummer Brian Downey had decided the affair was too disorganised and retired from the group leaving none of the original trio remaining. Keyboardist Darren Wharton also quit around the time of this album&#x27;s release. The band, led by Sykes and Scott Gorham, subsequently continued performing with various lineups. This album features ex-Ozzy, Whitesnake, and Black Oak Arkansas drummer Tommy Aldridge.

<text>Juanacatlán is a metro station on the Mexico City Metro. It is located in Mexico City&#x27;s Miguel Hidalgo borough in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood, and lies on Line 1 of the Metro. In 2019 the station had an average ridership of 11,669 passengers per day, making it the least used station in Line 1. Since 9 November 2023, the station has remained closed for modernization work on the tunnel and the line&#x27;s technical equipment.

==Name and pictogram==
When the station opened in 1970, it was originally named for the street that was in front of the station, Juanacatlán (the name of the street changed and it is now known as Alfonso Reyes, in honor of the Mexican writer, philosopher and diplomat).

The street was in turn named for Juanacatlán in the state of Jalisco. &quot;Xonacatlan&quot;, means &quot;place of onions&quot; (sometimes mistakenly read as meaning &quot;place of butterflies&quot;) in Nahuatl. Therefore, the station&#x27;s pictogram depicts a butterfly.

==General information==
The station was opened on 11 April 1970.

The station&#x27;s building also contains the offices of the Metro workers&#x27; trade union, the windows of which depict the front of a metro train. This station runs under Avenida Pedro Antonio de los Santos. It serves the San Miguel Chapultepec and Condesa districts.

From 23 April to 23 June 2020, the station was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.

<text>San Lázaro is a station on the Mexico City Metro. It is located in the Venustiano Carranza borough of Mexico City. It lies along Lines 1 and B. The station was opened on 5 September 1969. The station was designed by Félix Candela and consists of interlocked hyperbolic paraboloidal or saddle roof sections. From July 2022 to October 2023, the Line 1 station was closed due to modernization works on the tunnel and the line&#x27;s technical equipment.

==General information==
The station logo depicts an old steam locomotive. Near the site of the metro station stood the San Lázaro mainline train station. San Lázaro was the main terminus for the Interoceanic Railway, which linked the port of Veracruz, on the Gulf of Mexico, with the Pacific Ocean. Today, some railway tracks can still be seen near the metro station, but nothing more.

Nearby is the building that houses the Chamber of Deputies (&quot;Palacio Legislativo&quot; in Spanish), the lower house of the Mexican Congress &quot;(Congreso de la Unión)&quot;.

San Lázaro metro station is connected with TAPO, Mexico City&#x27;s Eastern intercity bus station. This bus station serves states including Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Yucatán. It is used by some of the most prestigious and safest bus lines in Mexico, such as ADO, UNO, and Maya de Oro.

<doc id="1066946" wikidata="Q165402" url="?curid=1066946" title="Milton Cato">
<text>Robert Milton Cato, , (3 June 1915 – 10 February 1997) was a socialist Vincentian politician who served as the first Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and also held the offices Premier of Saint Vincent and Chief Minister of Saint Vincent before independence. Cato was the leader of the Saint Vincent Labour Party, and led the country through independence in 1979.

==Life and career==
Robert Milton Cato was born in Saint Vincent, British Windward Islands on 3 June 1915. He attended the St. Vincent Grammar School from 1928 to 1933. On leaving school, the young Cato was articled to a Barrister-at-law in Kingstown, and began his career in law and was called to the Bar, Middle Temple in 1948. In 1945, he joined the First Canadian Army, attained the rank of Sergeant and gave active service in the Second World War in France, Belgium, Holland and Germany. Robert Milton Cato was married to Lucy-Ann Alexandra Cato.

After returning to Saint Vincent, Cato became involved in politics. In 1955 he co-founded the Saint Vincent Labour Party.

Elected to the office of Chief Minister on 19 May 1967, as head of the St. Vincent Labour Party, Mr. Cato did much to improve the economic standing of the island. He was St. Vincent&#x27;s first Premier on the island&#x27;s entry to Statehood on 27 October 1969. Cato held the additional portfolio of Minister of Finance. He was out of government during the period 1972 to 1974 following his party&#x27;s defeat. Cato&#x27;s Labour Party lost elections in 1972 and the opposition leader, James Fitz-Allen Mitchell became Premier. Cato was appointed leader of the opposition from 1972 to 1974. Cato&#x27;s party and its coalition partners won elections in 1974, and he became the premier and minister of finance again.

Robert Milton Cato led Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to complete independence from Britain on 27 October 1979, and is known as &#x27;The Father of Independence&#x27;. He took the offices of Prime Minister and Minister of Finance.
Mr. Cato, the longtime representative of the West St. George Constituency, was appointed leader of the opposition from August to November 1984 following his party&#x27;s defeat in the general elections. He then retired from active politics. He died on 10 February 1997 at the age of 81. His hope was for unity in Vincentian society and a brighter future for the people. The Kingstown General Hospital was renamed The Milton Cato Memorial Hospital in his honour in October 2000.

<doc id="1066948" wikidata="Q917194" url="?curid=1066948" title="Modus vivendi">
<text>Modus vivendi (plural modi vivendi) is a Latin phrase that means &quot;mode of living&quot; or &quot;way of life&quot;. In international relations, it often is used to mean an arrangement or agreement that allows conflicting parties to coexist in peace. In science, it is used to describe lifestyles.

&quot;Modus&quot; means &quot;mode&quot;, &quot;way&quot;, &quot;method&quot;, or &quot;manner&quot;. &quot;Vivendi&quot; means &quot;of living&quot;. The phrase is often used to describe informal and temporary arrangements in political affairs. For example, if two sides reach a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; regarding disputed territories, despite political, historical or cultural incompatibilities, an accommodation of their respective differences is established for the sake of contingency.

In diplomacy, a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; is an instrument for establishing an international accord of a temporary or provisional nature, intended to be replaced by a more substantial and thorough agreement, such as a treaty. Armistices and instruments of surrender are intended to achieve a &quot;modus vivendi&quot;.

==Examples==

The term often refers to Anglo-French relations from the 1815 end of the Napoleonic Wars to the 1904 Entente Cordiale.

On 7 January 1948, the United States, Britain and Canada, concluded an agreement known as the &quot;modus vivendi&quot;, that allowed for limited sharing of technical information on nuclear weapons which officially repealed the Quebec Agreement.

<doc id="1066950" wikidata="Q7540341" url="?curid=1066950" title="Slide cube projector">
<text>The Slide Cube Projector is a slide projector and system, manufactured and marketed by Bell &amp; Howell, which was introduced in 1970 and marketed through the 1980s. The projector derived its name from its transparent cubical plastic slide storage magazine, approximately in each dimension (a bit larger than a standard 135 film slide mount), that held 36 to 44 slides, depending on the mount thickness. The magazine used a sliding lid to hold the slides in place. Unlike competing systems which used straight tray or carousel magazines, the slides in a Slide Cube are stacked on top of each other rather than stored in separate slots.

The system consisted of Slide Cubes and a projector designed to use them. Bell &amp; Howell subsequently introduced a Slide Cube Projector II, with revised features, before discontinuing the system in the 1980s. Although Slide Cube Projectors are no longer manufactured, cubes, bulbs, a few replacement parts, and complete used projectors are available on the second-hand market.

==Design and operation==
When a cube is placed on the slide projector in the PRE-LOAD position, then slid into the LOAD position, its lid opens. As the advance trigger is activated, a sequence is initiated which starts by dropping a single slide into the slide advance mechanism, which uses a circular turntable with slide-size holes. The turntable has four distinct positions; in sequence, these are:
# LOAD
# PREVIEW
# PROJECTION
# RETURN
The turntable is thinner than a single slide, which allows just one slide at a time to drop from the cube into the LOAD position. The PREVIEW position allows the operator to check if the slide is loaded correctly before advancing into the PROJECTION position, where the image is projected onto the screen for viewing by the audience. The next position, RETURN, is available so the turntable can be reversed, allowing a slide in RETURN position to move back to PROJECTION, which gives the projector the capability to manually reverse the show by a single slide. After the RETURN position, the turntable finally rotates to the (RE)LOAD position, where the slide drops out of the turntable into a stack and another slide is taken from the cube. After the slides have been viewed, the operator presses a lever which lifts the slides back into the cube.

Most of the projectors use a 300 watt 120 V multifaceted reflector halogen lamp (ANSI code ELH) as a light source; early models use a 500 W lamp without reflector (code CBA) instead. In addition to the on-projector controls, it could optionally be operated by a wired remote control, or the &quot;Time Cube&quot; automatic advancement accessory. The projector had an integrated handle, plastic lid or optional lid which incorporated additional cube storage. A sliding front foot or tilting lens adjustment were used to change the elevation of the projected image. Several alternative projection lenses were offered.

Bell &amp; Howell Slide Cubes were less expensive than trays and provided denser and cheaper storage capacity, with a book or drawer of 16 forty-slide cubes (640 slides) occupying the same space as a single round tray holding at most 140 slides. Stack storage and preview facilitated editing of slideshows; slides could be added to or removed from the show without having to move all of the remaining slides to fill the gap. Some tray-based projectors (e.g. some Kodak round-tray and Hähnel straight-tray slide projectors) also could use stack loaders to view a stack of slides, but did not allow addition or removal of slides, and did not have an associated storage system.

Drawbacks of the slide cube included the inability to go back by more than one slide, the fragility of the cubes, and the advancing turntable&#x27;s tendency to jam if a slide mount was not perfect, interrupting slide shows and making the projectors challenging to operate.

===Models===
A version of the AF70 was sold by Sears as the Opticube (model 802).

===Lenses===
All Slide Cube projectors are compatible with any of the four available lenses. Lens appearance depends on age, with the earliest lenses featuring silver-colored finishes on the focusing (and zoom) ring, coordinating with the earliest Slide Cube projectors; lenses originally sold with the Slide Cube System II may be marked as &quot;Lumina II&quot;.
* &quot;Lumina&quot; 64 mm (2&quot;) for 110 film slides
* &quot;Filmovara Lumina&quot; 85–115 mm (3–4&quot;) 
* &quot;Lumina&quot; 100 mm (4&quot;) 
* &quot;Lumina&quot; 100 mm (4&quot;)

<text>The Skulls is a 2000 American thriller film directed by Rob Cohen and starring Joshua Jackson, Paul Walker and Leslie Bibb. Its plot is based upon some of the conspiracy theories surrounding Yale University&#x27;s Skull and Bones student society. The film was critically panned, but successful enough to spawn two direct-to-video sequels, &quot;The Skulls II&quot; and &quot;The Skulls III&quot;, released in 2002 and 2004, respectively.

==Plot==
Luke McNamara is a student aspiring to become a lawyer. An orphaned &quot;townie&quot; who grew up on the &quot;wrong side of the tracks&quot;, he did well enough in school to attend college on a scholarship where he is a champion rower. His best friends at college are his love interest Chloe, and Will. Will is the coxswain of the Bulldog 8&#x27;s rowing team and Luke is the captain. Luke&#x27;s friendships become strained when he is invited to join a secret society known as &quot;The Skulls&quot;. Luke passes the first part of the initiation process by stealing an artifact from a rival secret society. He does this with boxing prodigy Caleb Mandrake, who The Skulls declare his co-conspirator and &quot;soulmate&quot;. Luke and Caleb are lectured in the secret ritual room by a senior Skull who is standing in front of a wall with the word &quot;WAR&quot; engraved into it in huge capital letters. A senior Skull explains that the Skulls require their members to prove themselves in war. Luke has a falling out with Will over Luke becoming a Skull.

Luke strikes up a friendship with Caleb&#x27;s father, Litten Mandrake. Litten is the current Chairman of the Skulls and a Federal Court Judge who is pushing for a position in the Supreme Court. Litten and his partner, Senator Ames Levritt, take an interest in Luke. Will, who has researched the Skulls for some time, discovers their ritual room. Will gets caught in the room by Caleb and in the ensuing struggle he is knocked unconscious. Caleb is ordered to leave the room by his father, who then orders Skulls member and the University&#x27;s provost Martin Lombard to break Will&#x27;s neck. The Skulls make it appear that Will hanged himself in his dorm room.

Stricken with grief over Will&#x27;s death, Luke begins to suspect he was murdered by Caleb. Caleb also believes that he is guilty, suspecting Will died as a direct consequence of Caleb hitting him. Luke enlists his friends from childhood to help solve the mystery. With their help, Luke obtains the Skulls security tapes that prove Lombard committed the murder. In trying to convince Caleb of the truth, Luke realizes how scared Caleb is of his father. Before Luke can show the evidence to police, the Skulls council, who know Luke has the tapes, vote that he is no longer loyal. Ames Levritt is blackmailed into voting against Luke by Litten Mandrake, who has pictures of him with his much younger mistress. When Luke goes to the police, the tape is switched by Detective Sparrow and Luke is confined to a mental hospital.

With the help of Ames and Chloe, Luke escapes the hospital and he and Chloe survive an attempt on his life by Martin Lombard, who is shot and killed by Detective Sparrow, who is working for Levritt. Luke decides that his only option is to fight the Skulls by their own rules, and &quot;bring war to them&quot;. He challenges Caleb to a duel at the Skulls&#x27; private island, by invoking rule 119. Litten tries to take his son&#x27;s place in the duel but is denied the opportunity due to another Skull rule. After Luke and Caleb take their ten paces and turn around, Luke drops his gun and tries convincing Caleb of the truth and that he is not responsible for Will&#x27;s murder. Despite being pressured by Litten to kill Luke, Caleb cannot bring himself to pull the trigger. Litten grabs a pistol and attempts to shoot Luke, but before he can fire, Caleb shoots his father. Mortified at what he has done, Caleb tries to kill himself but is stopped by Luke.

Luke realizes that Senator Levritt manipulated Luke and others to bring about Litten&#x27;s downfall. Luke becomes disgusted with The Skulls and refuses to participate further, despite Levritt telling him that he will be tracked down and that The Skulls will accept him because he has proven himself in war. As Luke walks away Levritt says to himself, &quot;Well done son, well done&quot;.

Many of University of Toronto&#x27;s most notable buildings are featured in the film. A part of University College stands in for the Skulls&#x27; headquarters, while the office of the Skulls&#x27; leader shown as being in Trinity College. The rival society is headquartered in the student council building. The protagonists live and eat in Burwash Hall. The opening rowing scene was shot in St. Catharines, Ontario. Several scenes were shot on Dark Island in the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

==Production==
In March 1999 Universal acquired the U.S. and U.K. rights as part of an expansion into teen driven genre fare. Summit Entertainment handled international sales on the film. Newmarket Films financed the Original films produced film as part of a joint venture.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened at #3 at the North American box office, making US$11,034,885 in its opening weekend, behind &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; and &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 9% rating based on 85 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Skulls&quot; is full of nonsense and empty of a good script and plot&quot;. On Metacritic it has a score of 24% based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it &quot;so ludicrous in so many different ways it achieves a kind of forlorn grandeur&quot;.

Director Rob Cohen is very fond of the film and the cast: &quot;It was a very intense set because I had in my mind that I was telling the story of George Senior and George W. Bush. I had gone to Harvard that had the dining clubs but not the Skull and Bones, the secret societies. But I knew a lot about the secret societies, and I thought this is how the elite functions. This is how the elite knits together these bonds that take them through life and keep them in the elite heights of any society, and I was very excited about portraying that with Paul and Josh and all the cast. To create this secret world of power elites… that was very exciting to me and I got the cast excited about that idea. It&#x27;s interesting how many of the critics missed this and didn&#x27;t understand it and blowed it off as silly. Skull and Bones is a reality and the film got very close to how that reality works at Yale&quot;.

<doc id="1066958" wikidata="Q179496" url="?curid=1066958" title="Margaret Leighton">
<text>Margaret Leighton (26 February 1922 – 13 January 1976) was an English actress, active on stage and television, and in film. Her film appearances included Anthony Asquith&#x27;s &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (her first credited film role), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Under Capricorn&quot;, Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot;, George More O&#x27;Ferrall&#x27;s &quot;The Holly and the Ivy&quot;, Martin Ritt&#x27;s &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;, John Guillermin&#x27;s &quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;, Franklin J. Schaffner&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot;, Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Loved One&quot;, John Ford&#x27;s &quot;7 Women&quot;, and Joseph Losey&#x27;s &quot;The Go-Between&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot;. For &quot;The Go-Between&quot;, she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Leighton began her career on stage in 1938, before joining the Old Vic and making her Broadway debut in 1946. A four-time Tony Award nominee, she twice won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play: for the original Broadway productions of &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1962). She also won an Emmy Award for a 1970 television version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Barnt Green, Worcestershire, Leighton made her stage debut as Dorothy in &quot;Laugh with Me&quot; (1938), which also was performed that year for BBC Television. She became a star of the Old Vic. Her Broadway debut was as the Queen in &quot;Henry IV&quot; (1946), starring Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson during a visit of the Old Vic to the U.S., and the company performed a total of five plays from its repertoire before returning to London.

After appearing in two British films, including the starring role of Flora MacDonald opposite David Niven in &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot; (1948) and in the popular &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot; (also 1948), the actress appeared in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Under Capricorn&quot; (1949) and the crime/mystery &quot;Calling Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1951). In the U.S., she portrayed the wife of a presidential candidate in &quot;The Best Man&quot; (1964).

Leighton won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1956); she won another Tony in that category for &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1962), playing Hannah Jelkes (a role played by Deborah Kerr in the film version) opposite Bette Davis&#x27;s Maxine Faulk. Leighton was nominated for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; (1959) and for &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot; (1962). Her last appearance on Broadway was as Birdie Hubbard in a revival of Lillian Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1967).

She had a noteworthy list of TV appearances, including &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;. She won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in Drama for &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1970) and she was nominated for an Emmy in 1966 for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Drama for four episodes of &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;. Her final TV performance was in the first season of &quot;&quot; where she played Queen Arra in the episode &quot;Collision Course.&quot;

For her film role as Mrs Maudsley in &quot;The Go-Between&quot; (1971), Leighton won the British BAFTA Film Award for Best Supporting Actress. She also received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for the role. She received a BAFTA nomination for Best British Actress for her role as Valerie Carrington in &quot;Carrington V.C.&quot; (1954).

==Personal life==
Leighton was married three times, to publisher Max Reinhardt from 1947 to 1955, to actor Laurence Harvey from 1957 to 1961, and to actor Michael Wilding from 1964 until her death. She had no children by any of the marriages.

She was appointed a CBE in 1974. Leighton died of multiple sclerosis in 1976, aged 53, in Chichester, Sussex.

<text>The PeopleMover, sometimes referred to as the Goodyear PeopleMover and WEDWay PeopleMover, was a transport attraction that opened on July 2, 1967, in Tomorrowland at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. Guests boarded small trains that ran on elevated tracks for a &quot;grand circle tour&quot; above Tomorrowland. The term &quot;people mover&quot;, now in wider use to describe many forms of automated public transport, was first coined as the name for this attraction. &quot;PeopleMover&quot; was originally only a working title, but became attached to the project over time. The attraction was initially seen as a serious prototype for intercity public transport. The ride closed on August 21, 1995, but its station and track infrastructure—which it shared with its short-lived successor, Rocket Rods—remain standing as of 2025. A second PeopleMover opened on July 1, 1975 in Tomorrowland at the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando, Florida, and is still operating today.

==Operation==

The attraction&#x27;s vehicles were always moving. Passengers boarded and alighted by a large speed-matched rotating platform inside the station. The trains were not powered by motors within themselves. Rather, they were pushed by rotating tires embedded in the track once every nine feet, each of which had its own electric motor. There were 517 motors embedded in the track. 

Each car included its own sound system which broadcast a continuous audio commentary and soundtrack, relative to the train&#x27;s location. The commentary pointed out Disneyland&#x27;s attractions along the way as well as announcing promotional items.

The tour continued from the center of Tomorrowland through a few of Tomorrowland&#x27;s buildings, for a look inside, and over Disneyland&#x27;s Submarine Lagoon and Autopia areas, before returning to Tomorrowland.

The attraction&#x27;s onboard soundtrack originally consisted of the Goodyear jingle &quot;Go, Go, Goodyear&quot; and George Bruns&#x27; instrumentals &quot;Nation on Wheels&quot; and &quot;The Monorail Song&quot;. From 1976 until its closure, the attraction&#x27;s onboard soundtrack consisted of instrumental pieces composed by Danish composer Ole Georg for Capitol Records&#x27; production music library, Capitol Media Music.

===Sponsorship===
The attraction used an updated WEDway system based on the WEDway used for the Ford Magic Skyway at the 1964–65 New York World&#x27;s Fair. When Disney asked Ford Motor Company to continue sponsorship by sponsoring Disneyland&#x27;s new PeopleMover, they declined, because Ford was reluctant to support technology that appeared to replace the automobile. Goodyear was then approached to sponsor it, and accepted. The wheels used in the WEDway system were replaced by Goodyear&#x27;s tires. The PeopleMover&#x27;s logo was then fashioned after Goodyear&#x27;s logo, sharing a similar typeface. Goodyear sponsored the PeopleMover from its opening until December 31, 1981. However, Goodyear&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Go Go Goodyear&quot; advertising jingle still served as part of the attraction&#x27;s soundtrack until at least 1990.

==History==

The PeopleMover opened as part of New Tomorrowland in 1967. Originally, each four-car train was colored either red, blue, yellow or green with white roofs. They were repainted all white with colored stripes in 1987-88, similar to the new Mark V Monorails that began operation around the same time. In 1968, each of the 62 trains were retrofitted with safety rails for each car, to deter guests from climbing out. In 1985, these safety rails were modified to completely wrap around each car, making it even more difficult for possible accidents to occur.

===SuperSpeed Tunnel===
In 1977, the SuperSpeed Tunnel was added to the PeopleMover. It was located in the upper level of the Carousel Building, which then housed America Sings. Race cars were projected on the walls of the tunnel all around the trains. In 1982, the projections were changed to scenes from the film &quot;Tron&quot; and the tunnel was announced as the &quot;Game Grid of Tron&quot; by the on-board audio guide. After this addition, the attraction was advertised as the &quot;PeopleMover Thru the World of Tron&quot;.

===Deaths and incidents===

In August 1967, a 16-year-old boy from Hawthorne, California, was killed while jumping between two moving PeopleMover cars as the ride was passing through a tunnel. He stumbled and fell onto the track, where an oncoming train of cars crushed him beneath its wheels and dragged his body a few hundred feet before it was stopped by a ride operator. The attraction had only been open for one month at the time.

In 1972, four teenage girls were riding the PeopleMover when one teenager lost her mouse ears cap. She and her cousin jumped onto the track to retrieve them. Realizing they&#x27;d have to get on a different PeopleMover car, the first girl successfully got into a car, while the second girl ran through a tunnel and out the exit and then fell into a guard rail and onto the concrete 30 feet below. She broke an arm, hip, and pelvis; she had to be in a body brace and have a pin inserted into her leg. She sued Disney for not having any warnings about the exit.

On June 7, 1980, an 18-year-old male was crushed and killed by the PeopleMover while jumping between moving cars. The accident occurred as the ride entered the SuperSpeed tunnel.

===Closure===
The PeopleMover closed on August 21, 1995 since Imagineers thought the ride was past its time and no longer a prototype, but rather a place to rest one&#x27;s feet and also as part of Michael Eisner and Paul Pressler&#x27;s program to save money by shutting down expensive attractions. When Toy Story Funhouse operated as a temporary attraction during the 1996 season, a few character statues from the film sat on the PeopleMover track. It was replaced by the short-lived Rocket Rods in 1998. Due to the failure of Euro Disney, officials kept the PeopleMover track unbanked and original.

A few of the retired PeopleMover cars were used in other parts of the resort after its closing. Three cars from train #45 used to sit outside the Team Disney Anaheim building, but they were removed in 2007. One of the cars from train #45 is now in display at the cast members cafe called the Eat Ticket. Another car from train #45 is now owned by a local resident. Two cars were repainted with a blue and orange grid to resemble a blueprint (along with Rocket Jets vehicles and the front of a Mark III Disneyland-ALWEG monorail train) and placed in the queue display for Rocket Rods, which would later close in 2000. These were later sold on Disney Auctions after Rocket Rods closed.

The checkout counters at the Little Green Men Store Command in Tomorrowland resemble PeopleMover cars and the store has former Rocket Jets vehicles retrofitted as merchandise shelves. The store also had Skyway buckets hanging from the ceiling when it was the Premiere Shop.

In 2000, almost five years after the attraction&#x27;s closure, an updated version of the Autopia attraction opened. The old on-board audio music from the PeopleMover served as the background area music in Autopia&#x27;s queue from 2000 to 2017.

The ride track infrastructure, as well as the loading station, which served both the PeopleMover and Rocket Rods still stands unused in Tomorrowland as of 2024. Portions of the track, however, are still being maintained, as it was repainted in 2005 along with the rest of Tomorrowland, and foliage over the Autopia area was trimmed away or removed from the track. In September 2010 at D23&#x27;s &quot;Destination D&quot; event, then-president of Disneyland Resort George Kalogridis said that while there may be plans to bring back the ride, the park would not be able to return the attraction to its original form due to stricter regulations. Kalogridis stated &quot;Everyone understands the passion everyone has for it.&quot; He additionally stated, &quot;Hang in there.&quot;

Portions of the track can still be viewed from the monorail, Autopia, and Astro Orbiter rides.

<text>Viaducto is a station on Line 2 of the Mexico City Metro system. It is located in the border of Benito Juárez and Iztacalco boroughs of Mexico City, south of the city centre on Calzada de Tlalpan. It is a surface station.

==General information==
It is represented by the stylised logo of a cloverleaf interchange, which represents crossing of Calzada de Tlalpan (a former Aztec road) and Viaducto Miguel Alemán, a crosscutting freeway that runs across the middle of the Federal District which opened in September 1950. The station was opened on 1 August 1970.

===Ridership===
==Train crash==
On October 20, 1975, at about 09:40 local time (15:40 GMT), two trains crashed, while both were going towards Tasqueña station. The first was parked at Viaducto station picking up passengers when it was hit by another train that did not stop in time. According to official reports, from 31 to 39 people died, and between 71 and 119 were injured. To date, it is the worst railroad accident recorded in the Mexico City Metro. The driver, Carlos Fernández, was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years in prison. After the crash, automatic traffic lights were incorporated to all lines.

<text>Sackcloth ( &quot;śaq&quot;) is a coarsely woven fabric, usually made of goat&#x27;s hair. The term in English often connotes the biblical usage, where the &quot;Hastings&#x27; Dictionary of the Bible&quot; remarks that haircloth would be more appropriate rendering of the Hebrew meaning.

In some Christian traditions (notably Catholicism), the wearing of hairshirts continues as a self-imposed means of mortifying the flesh that is often practiced during the Christian penitential season of Lent, especially on Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, and other Fridays of the Lenten season.

==As fabric==
Hessian sackcloth or burlap is not the intended biblical meaning, according to a number of scholarly sources: but the identification represents a common misconception based on phonetic association. &quot;Sackcloth, usually made of black goat hair, was used by the Israelites and their neighbors in times of mourning or social protest.&quot; Burlap, another term used in English translation, is also generally understood as goat haircloth. Stiff camel hair was also used.

==As garment==
Sackcloth came to mean a garment, too, made from such cloth, which was worn as a token of mourning by the Israelites. It was also a sign of submission (1 Kings 20:31–32), or of grief and self-humiliation (2 Kings 19:1), and was occasionally worn by the Prophets. It is often associated with ashes. 

The 1906 &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; says the Old Testament gives no exact description of the garment. According to Adolf Kamphausen, the sacḳ was like a corn-bag with an opening for the head, and another for each arm, an opening being made in the garment from top to bottom. Karl Grüneisen thought it resembled a hairy mantle used by the Bedouins. Friedrich Schwally concluded otherwise that it originally was simply the loin-cloth. Schwally based his opinion on the fact that the word &quot;ḥagar&quot; חָגַר (to gird) is used in describing the putting on of the garment (see Joshua 1:8; Isaiah 3:24, 15:8, 22:12; Jeremiah 6:26, 49:3). One fastens it around the hips (&quot;sim be-motnayim&quot;, Genesis 37:34; &quot;he&#x27;elah &#x27;al motnayim&quot;, Amos 8:10), while, in describing taking it offing of the sacḳ, the words &quot;pitteaḥ me-&#x27;al motnayim&quot; are used (Isaiah 20:2). According to 1 Kings 21:27 and 2 Kings 6:30, it was worn next to the skin.

In later times it came to be worn for religious purposes only, on extraordinary occasions, or at mourning ceremonies. Isaiah wore nothing else, and was commanded by God to don it (Isaiah 20:2). &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; suggests that &quot;old traditions about to die out easily assume a holy character&quot;. Thus Schwally points to the circumstance that the Muslim pilgrim, as soon as he puts his foot on Ḥaram, the holy soil, takes off all the clothes he is wearing, and dons the iḥram.

<text>The United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois (in case citations, C.D. Ill.) serves the residents of forty-six counties, which are divided into four divisions. The counties are: Adams, Brown, Bureau, Cass, Champaign, Christian, Coles, DeWitt, Douglas, Edgar, Ford, Fulton, Greene, Hancock, Henderson, Henry, Iroquois, Kankakee, Knox, Livingston, Logan, McDonough, McLean, Macoupin, Macon, Marshall, Mason, Menard, Mercer, Montgomery, Morgan, Moultrie, Peoria, Piatt, Pike, Putnam, Rock Island, Sangamon, Schuyler, Scott, Shelby, Stark, Tazewell, Vermilion, Warren, and Woodford counties.

The courthouses for the Central District&#x27;s four divisions are in Peoria, Rock Island, Springfield, and Urbana. In 2018, all court operations for the Rock Island District were moved to the federal courthouse in Davenport, Iowa, due to uninhabitable conditions at the Rock Island courthouse.

Appeals are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

, the acting United States attorney is Gregory M. Gilmore.

==History==
The United States District Court for the District of Illinois was established by a statute passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1819, 3 Stat. 502. The act established a single office for a judge to preside over the court. Initially, the court was not within any existing judicial circuit, and appeals from the court were taken directly to the United States Supreme Court. In 1837, Congress created the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, placing it in Chicago, Illinois and giving it jurisdiction over the District of Illinois, .

On February 13, 1855, by , the District of Illinois was subdivided into Northern and the Southern Districts. An Eastern District was created on March 3, 1905 by , by splitting counties out of the Northern and Southern Districts. It was later eliminated in a reorganization on October 2, 1978 which replaced it with the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois District, . The newly created Central District was formed primarily from parts of the Southern District, and returned some counties to the Northern District. Some judges from both the Eastern and Southern Districts were transferred to the Central District by operation of law.

<text>Sattar Khan (, , October 20, 1866 – November 17, 1914), honorarily titled Sardār-e Melli ( meaning &quot;National Commander&quot;) was a pivotal figure in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and is considered a national hero by the Iranian people.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sattar Khan was born in Sardar Kandy, of Iranian Azerbaijani origin, some time in 1868. He was the third son of Haj Hasan Bazzaz, from the Qaradagh. During his childhood, his eldest brother, who had become a highway robber, was executed by the authorities.

The family later moved to Tabriz where Sattar himself came into conflict with the law when he tried to find a hideout for two Caucasian fugitives to whom his father had given shelter. He was incarcerated for two years in Narin Qalʿa, a notorious local prison. Afterwards he too became a brigand and was subsequently imprisoned again. He also served in the gendarmerie controlling the main road between Khoy and Marand, and for a while found employment as part of the armed escort to the crown prince Mozaffar-al-Din Mirza and was given the title of &quot;khan&quot; (which means &quot;sir&quot; in the Persian language).

Later, after a period in Tehran, he headed an auxiliary troop fighting Turkmen highway robbers near Mashhad.

===Revolutionary===
Sattar Khan had close ties to the Social Democratic Party. He rose from obscurity to head Constitutionalist rebels from the Amirkhiz district of Tabriz. By 1907, he had become a favored leader of the rebels. After shelling the Majles (parliament) of Iran in the capital Tehran, 40 thousand of Mohammad Ali Shah&#x27;s soldiers were ordered to attack Tabriz, where Constitutional rebels were holding out. In June 1908, under the leadership of Sattar Khan, a High Military Council was established. Sattar Khan was appointed the Commander in chief of High Council, Bagher Khan as his deputy, and Ali Musyo, Haji Ali and Seyed Hashem Khan as other notable members.

By April 1909, the Tabriz rebels had lost a large number of their fighters in driving out royalist forces from the city. Taking into account Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan&#x27;s heroism during the battle, Sattar Khan was honored by the title of &quot;Sardar-e Melli&quot; (, &quot;National General&quot;) and Bagir khan &quot;Salar-e Melli&quot; (, &quot;National Leader&quot;) by the order of the Assembly.

The early victories of the rebels in Tabriz greatly influenced other Constitutionalists across Iran. Special committees with the name of &quot;Sattar Khan&quot; were established in Tehran, Rasht, Qazvin, Isfahan and other cities. Sattar Khan&#x27;s reputation also led to the powerful Bakhtiyari tribal leaders to throw in their lot with the Tabriz rebels.

Most of the cities of Azarbaijan province were cleared of royalist military forces by October 1908. Mohammad Ali Shah authorized the reopening of the Majles in Tehran in order to try and placate the opposition.

The Second Majles was held in December 1908. It ordered a plaque of honor with images of Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan carved on it in gold as a token of appreciation for their services.

The strengthening of revolutionary power in the wake of the Tabriz victory frightened not only the Qajar Shah but also his allies, Russia and Great Britain. In March 1910, Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan set out for the capital Tehran with 300 pro-Moderates soldiers, where they were greeted by large numbers of supporters April 3, 1910.

Sattar Khan and his warriors camped out in Atabek Park, where they refused to obey the Shah&#x27;s order to disarm. The Shah&#x27;s troops and police forces led by Yeprem Khan (Davidyans), head of Tehran police, launched a brief but violent confrontation on the night of August 7, 1910, and succeeded in surrounding and disarming Sattar Khan&#x27;s forces. About 30 warriors were killed and Sattar Khan was wounded in his leg – remaining disabled until his death at the age 48, on November 9, 1914. He was buried in the famous Shah-Abdol-Azim shrine cemetery in Shahr-e Ray, just outside Tehran.

==Legacy==
Sattar Khan is remembered in Iran as the heroic leader of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution and is the subject of poems and songs.

<text>Paullus Aemilius Lepidus (c. 77 BC – after 11 BC) was a Roman senator.

==Biography==
He was a grandson of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Appuleia through their son Lucius Aemilius Paullus and his wife. His paternal uncle Marcus Aemilius Lepidus served as a member of the Second Triumvirate. He was named an augur in 35 BCE. Paullus served as consul in 34 BC and censor in 22. Paullus was in some way related to a Cassia.

Paullus first married Cornelia (c. 54 BC-16 BC). With Cornelia, Paullus had three children: Lucius Aemilius Paullus (c. 37 BC-14 AD) the husband of Julia the Younger and consul in AD 1; Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (c. 30 BC-33 AD), consul in AD 6; and a daughter Aemilia Paulla (c. 22 BC). Aemilia was married twice: first to Lucius Munatius Plancus, consul in AD 13; second to Publius Memmius Regulus. 

Paullus was widowed in 18 BC, the same year Cornelia&#x27;s brother Publius Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus was consul. Not long after Cornelia&#x27;s death, he married Claudia Marcella Minor, a daughter of Octavia the Younger, sister of the Roman emperor Augustus. The marriage of Marcella and Paullus linked two honored republican houses and tied them closely to the imperial circle. At some point after 11 BC, Marcella bore him a son, Paullus Aemilius Regulus, who later served as a quaestor during the rule of the Roman emperor Tiberius.

<doc id="1067016" wikidata="Q371924" url="?curid=1067016" title="Junior Chamber International">
<text>Junior Chamber International, commonly referred to as JCI, is a non-profit international non-governmental organization of young people between and years old. It has members in about 127 countries, and regional or national organizations in most of them.

The first local Junior Chamber chapter was founded in 1915, but the international umbrella organization Junior Chamber International (JCI) was founded in Mexico in 1944. It has consultative status with the Council of Europe, with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and with UNESCO. It encourages young people to become active citizens and to participate in efforts towards social and economic development, international cooperation, good-will, and understanding.

==History==
By the age of 18, Henry Giessenbier Jr. had formed the Health Services Club, a social outlet for the community&#x27;s youth. On October 13, 1915, the first JCI Movement was founded when 32 men joined to form the Young Men&#x27;s Progressive Civic Association (YMPCA) at the Mission Inn located in their hometown of St. Louis, USA. The Young Men&#x27;s Progressive Civic Association members received acknowledgement from the broader community, however on November 30, 1915 official recognition of the organization was granted after enrolling as a member of the Mayor&#x27;s Conference of Civic Organizations. One year later, the YMPCA became known as the Junior Citizens and soon the Junior Chamber of Commerce, after affiliating with the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce. On December 11, 1944, an Inter-American Congress was held in Mexico City. Representatives from the United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama gathered to officially establish Henry Giessenbier&#x27;s 24-year-old civic association as an international organization, Junior Chamber International. In 2015 the organization celebrated its 100th anniversary.

==Activities==
The local organizations are referred to as Local Organization (LO) with a local board, and it is at the local level that most activities take place: conferences, projects, local publications, etc. A LO will be member of a national organization or National Organization (NO) that is governed by a national board. The different NOs are members of Junior Chamber International.
The international organization publishes &quot;JCI World&quot;, a quarterly magazine, in six languages. It holds an annual conference, the JCI World Congress, in November of each year and regional annual meetings, the JCI Area Conferences.

Typically leadership positions in the organization are held only for one year; this goes for JCI local Presidents, for JCI National Presidents and also for the JCI World Presidents. Some members are given life membership of the organization and become &quot;senators&quot; and members of the JCI Senate. The Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World (TOYP) program is organized annually by Junior Chamber International and is a well-known activity that is often reported on by local news media.

<doc id="1067017" wikidata="Q1047642" url="?curid=1067017" title="Montreal Casino">
<text>The Montreal Casino (French: &quot;Casino de Montréal&quot;) located in Montreal, Quebec, is the largest casino in Canada. Situated on Notre Dame Island, in Jean-Drapeau Park, it consists of two former Expo 67 pavilion buildings. The casino is open to the public seven days a week, operating morning until late night. It first opened on October 9, 1993. 

The casino is owned and operated by the &quot;Société des casinos du Québec&quot; (a subsidiary of Loto-Québec), which owns three other casinos in the province. All profits go to the provincial Government of Quebec. As of 2019, it employed 2,800 people.

==Grounds==
The casino is located within the St Lawrence river on Notre Dame Island–a man-made island built for the 1967 World&#x27;s Fair. It is situated within Jean-Drapeau Park, an urban park and former grounds of Expo 67, and shares the island with the Gilles Villeneuve racing circuit, the Olympic Basin and an artificial lake with small beach. 

Access to the casino is served by the De la Concorde bridge through Cité du Havre, or by public transit via the Jean Drapeau Metro station (on the neighbouring Saint Helen&#x27;s Island) and then boarding a dedicated connecting bus.

== History ==
In 1992, the government of Quebec created the Société des casinos du Québec (SCQ) and tasked them to build casinos in the province. The Montreal Casino was the first among the two to be founded for the project and cost $95 million to build. The casino replaced the Palais des civilisations which used to showcase international cultural exhibitions, and prior to that was the Quebec Pavilion during Expo 67. It also made use the formerly vacant France pavilion, which was annexed via a constructed bridge way when both buildings were renovated to become the casino.

The casino received thousands of players within the first few weeks of its opening and 780,000 in its first year. During its opening year it employed 700 people.

In 1993, it went through its first major expansion.

In 1997, the Casino became a 24-hour establishment.

In 2003, it became a non-smoking casino since July that year, and the former smoking lounges were closed in May 2006 with the passing of a new provincial law.

In 2013, it saw a second major renovation when Loto-Québec collaborated with Moment Factory to renew the gaming areas of the casino. The installation featured a digital wall that expanded over three floors. Late the following year, it opened the area dubbed The Zone. 

In 2020, following the COVID-19 pandemic, the casino no longer operated 24 hours, instead closing at 3 AM (and 5 AM on weekends). A reversal of its 1997 change.

In 2021, the casino&#x27;s fine dining L&#x27;Atelier de Joël Robuchon restaurant permanently closed.

==Features and events==
The casino consists of three interconnected buildings. Two of these, the France Pavilion and the Québec Pavilion, were built for Expo 67. The third is an annex built by the casino to the south and east of the main building. An enclosed bridge joins the annex to the former Quebec Pavilion. The main building has six floors, in addition to the annex and the secondary building (with four floors). The casino boasts a gaming floor of over . Within the three structures there are over 3,000 slot machines, over 80 gaming tables and large number of speed lotteries and virtual games. The casino also contains three restaurants,
five bars,
a cabaret, and meeting and banquet facilities. The casino is known for certain unconventional structural features for such an establishment, such as its numerous windows and low ceilings.

The Montreal Casino holds all kinds of events and shows throughout the year, including band performances, dances, and comedy shows. Most of the events are free for visitors while others charge a fee for tickets. Every year, the casino holds a New Year&#x27;s party which lasts from the afternoon all the way to the morning of the next day. The casino invites DJs and musicians to the venue and features a giant screen showing the New Year&#x27;s Eve countdown.

== Keno scandal ==
In April 1994, Daniel Corriveau won $600,000 CAD playing keno. He picked 19 of the 20 winning numbers three times in a row. Corriveau claims he used a computer to discern a pattern in the sequence of numbers, based on chaos theory. However, it was later found that the sequence was easy to predict because the casino was using an inadequate electronic pseudorandom number generator. In fact, the keno machine was reset every morning with the same seed number, resulting in the same sequence of numbers being generated. Corriveau received his winnings after investigators cleared him of any wrongdoing.

<doc id="1067030" wikidata="Q4546417" url="?curid=1067030" title="102nd (Tyneside Scottish) Brigade">
<text>The 102nd Brigade was an infantry formation of the British Army during World War I. It was raised as part of &#x27;Kitchener&#x27;s Army&#x27; and assigned to the 34th Division. After the original formation was converted into a reserve brigade, the number was transferred to a brigade of &#x27;Tyneside Scottish&#x27;, four &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27; of the Northumberland Fusiliers recruited from men of (mainly) Scottish birth or heritage working on Tyneside. The brigade landed in France at the end of 1915 and then served on the Western Front for the rest of the war. The brigade suffered appalling casualties on the First day of the Battle of the Somme. It recovered to participate in the Battle of Arras in 1917, but was virtually destroyed during the German spring offensive of 1918. It was reconstituted with different units in time to take part in the final battles of the war and the post-war occupation of the Rhineland.

==Original 102nd Brigade==

On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army. The newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: &#x27;Your King and Country Need You&#x27;, urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener&#x27;s First New Army, or &#x27;K1&#x27;. The K2 and K3 battalions, brigades and divisions followed soon afterwards. So far, the battalions had all been formed at the depots of their parent regiments, but recruits had also been flooding in to the Special Reserve (SR) battalions (the former Militia). These were deployed at their war stations in coastal defence where they were training and equipping reservists to provide reinforcement drafts to the Regular Army fighting overseas. The SR battalions were soon well above their establishment strength and on 8 October 1914 the War Office (WO) ordered each SR battalion to use the surplus to form a service battalion of the 4th New Army (&#x27;K4&#x27;). In November K4 battalions were organised into 18 brigades numbered from 89 to 106 and formed into the 30th–35th Divisions.

Initially, the K4 units remained in the coast defences alongside their parent SR battalions. 

On 5 November 1914 four K4 battalions in the Portland Harbour Garrison were ordered to be formed into 102nd Brigade in 34th Division:
* 14th (Service) Battalion, Royal Scots, formed at Weymouth, Dorset
* 9th (Service) Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, formed at Portland
* 7th (Service) Battalion, Dorset Regiment, formed at Weymouth
* 8th (Service) Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment, formed at Weymouth

On 2 November Brigadier-General R.B. Fell was appointed to command the brigade. The units began training for active service, but the lack of uniforms, weapons, equipment and instructors that had been experienced by the K1–K3 units was even greater for those of K4, and by April 1915 their training was still at an elementary stage. On 10 April 1915 the WO decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve units, to provide drafts for the K1–K3 battalions in the same way that the SR was doing for the Regular battalions. The K4 divisions were broken up and the brigades were renumbered: 102nd Brigade became 14th Reserve Brigade.

==102nd (Tyneside Scottish) Brigade==

Meanwhile, the K5 units had been forming since late 1914. These were largely raised by local initiative rather than at regimental depots, and were known as &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27;. The first six K5 divisions (37–42) and their constituent brigades were given the numbers of the disbanded K4 formations on 27 April 1915. Thus 123rd Brigade of 41st Division became the new 102nd Brigade in 34th Division. This brigade had been raised on Tyneside largely from Scots working in the mines and industry of the area, though many native &#x27;Geordies&#x27; also joined. The request to the WO to form the brigade was originally turned down, but after a visit to Newcastle upon Tyne by Lord Haldane on 10 October 1915, permission was granted. The complete Tyneside Scottish Brigade of four battalions was raised by 16 November 1915 by Johnstone Wallace, Lord Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne and a committee of Scotsmen. Reports of bodies of men and groups of miners marching 10 miles into the city to enlist are common. It was numbered as 123rd Bde on 10 December and the battalions were assigned to the local regiment, the Northumberland Fusiliers (NF):
* 20th (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (1st Tyneside Scottish), commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel C.H. Innes Hopkins (formerly of the Scottish Rifles)
* 21st (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (2nd Tyneside Scottish), commanded by Colonel V.M. Stockley (formerly of the Indian Cavalry)
* 22nd (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (3rd Tyneside Scottish), commanded by Lt-Col A.P.A. Elphinstone (formerly of the Indian Army)
* 23rd (Service) Battalion, Northumberland Fusiliers (4th Tyneside Scottish), commanded by Captain J.C. Campbell (5th Royal Irish Rifles (Special Reserve))

(The 29th (Reserve) Bn (Tyneside Scottish) was formed in July 1915 from the depot companies of the brigade to train reinforcements, and was expanded to form 33rd (Reserve) Bn (Tyneside Scottish) in addition in June 1916.)

The brigade was concentrated in hutments at Alnwick by March 1915 under the command of retired Brig-Gen Trevor Ternan brought back from the reserve. Training was hampered by the same lack of equipment as the other Kitchener formations, but 34th Division began to form in June 1915. Most of the division trained in North Yorkshire, but 102nd Bde remained at Alnwick until the end of August when the division concentrated on the Salisbury Plain Training Area for final battle training. Although many of the elderly &#x27;dugout&#x27; officers were replaced by younger men, Boer War veteran Lt-Col Arthur Elphinstone (a former pupil of Monkton Combe School) continued to command the 3rd Tyneside Scottish. On 13 December the division was ordered to mobilise for service in Egypt, but these orders were rescinded on 26 December and instead the division embarked for France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting on the Western Front. Entrainment for the embarkation ports began on 7 January 1916 and on 15 January it completed its concentration round La Crosse, near Saint-Omer.

==Active service==
34th Division went into reserve behind III Corps. Parties of all arms were then sent into the line with 8th and 23rd Divisions to learn the routines of Trench warfare. On 24 February the division took over its own sector of the front line. 208th (Norfolk) Field Company, Royal Engineers (RE), was attached to 102nd Bde, but the REs remained in their places in the line while the infantry brigades were rotated between line holding and reserve.

The brigade was joined by its support troops in early 1916:
* 102nd Brigade Machine Gun (MG) Company – formed at Grantham, disembarked at Le Havre on 26 April and joined next day
* 102nd Trench Mortar Battery (TMB) – formed by 17 June from:
** A/102 TMB formed by 16 February, redesignated 102/1 TMB on 12 March
** 102/2 TMB formed by 1 June

The TMBs were manned by troops drawn from the infantry battalions.

On 7 April 34th Division was relieved in the line and went to the Second Army training area behind St Omer. Early in May it proceeded by route march and train to Albert in the Somme sector, where it rejoined III Corps, which had moved south to prepare for the forthcoming &#x27;Big Push&#x27; (the Battle of the Somme).

===First day on the Somme===

The First day on the Somme was the first offensive operation for 34th Division. Attacking on the right of III Corps, its objectives (recognised as being ambitious) were the Capture of La Boisselle situated on a spur, and then an advance of almost to Contalmaison, crossing six successive trench lines. The bombardment began on 25 June but bad weather hindered artillery observation so the bombardment was extended by two days and the attack was postponed until 1 July. The battalions moved into their assembly trenches between 05.00 and 07.00 as the artillery began their final bombardment. The plan was for 34th Division to attack with 102nd Bde on the left, 101st on the right, each brigade forming two columns. 102nd Brigade&#x27;s columns were led by the 21st NF south and 20th NF north of the La Boisselle salient; a special force of &#x27;bombers&#x27; from each battalion would turn inwards to clear the village itself. The attacking battalions were to be preceded by a creeping barrage. Each battalion was to advance in four waves, with special parties detailed to &#x27;mop up&#x27; the captured trenches, and others to carry up supplies. This first line would be followed by the 22nd NF to the south and 23rd NF to the north. 103rd Brigade, starting from behind the British front line, would then pass through to capture the third objective. The infantry commanders had been dissatisfied with the results of the preliminary bombardment, so a special bombardment of La Boisselle village by Stokes mortars had been laid on, and other mortars laid a smoke screen on the village. Over preceding weeks 179th Tunnelling Company, RE, had placed huge mines under the flanking defences of La Boiselle, the Schwabenhöhe or Schwaben redoubt to the south (the Lochnagar mine), and the &#x27;Y Sap&#x27; mine to the north. These mines were fired 2 minutes before Zero, at 07.28, obliterating sections of the German defences and creating very large craters.

At 07.30 the whole infantry of the division went &#x27;over the top&#x27;, the pipers of the Tyneside Scottish playing their men into action. The leading waves rose from their assembly trenches, the rear waves came down the Tara–Usna ridge behind. The However, the Germans were unsubdued by the bombardment or the mines, and came up from their deep dugouts as soon as the barrage moved off them. Their machine guns and rifles opened up before the British had got half way across the of No man&#x27;s land. Within 10 minutes of Zero, 80 per cent of the leading British battalions were casualties. With the shortest distance to cross, 21st NF managed to overrun the trenches of the Schwabenhöhe and attempted to pass between La Boisselle and the Lochnagar crater, crossing two more trench lines. However, their right flank was exposed by the failure of 101st Bde&#x27;s column attempting to advance up &#x27;Sausage Valley&#x27;. In addition, the bombing parties made no progress into La Boisselle despite the trench mortar bombardment that had continued for 12 minutes beyond Zero. The defenders of the village were able to fire into the left flank of the column. Very heavy casualties were suffered here by 21st NF, by 22nd NF following, and then by the battalion of 103rd Bde. With the bombing party eliminated, and German reinforcements arriving, the group in the third line trench under Major Spencer Acklom of 21st NF were forced to withdraw to the second line and consolidated a position there by 08.00, with another party of men from 101st, 102nd and 103rd Bdes holding onto Lochnagar crater nearby. To the north of La Boisselle, along the side of &#x27;Mash Valley&#x27;, No man&#x27;s land was much wider, and even less progress was made. Fired upon from La Boisselle and from Ovillers in the other side of the valley, 21st and 23rd NF were practically wiped out, their casualties strewn across No man&#x27;s land. Apart from a few individuals, this column fell back to its starting line. During the rest of the day Acklom&#x27;s party held off six counter-attacks, and by 15.00 the signallers had established a telephone line back to 102nd Bde HQ, by which time Acklom had gathered seven officers and about 200 other ranks (ORs). After dark Acklom established communications with the Lochnagar crater party, and together they improved their position. During the night the remnants of 102nd Bde were joined by 19th (Western) Division, some of them making their way up the tunnel used to dig the Lochnagar mine. Next day, 2 July, 19th (W) Division continued the attack on La Boisselle while Acklom held the crater with his party and some machine guns from 102nd MG Co later joined by some trench mortars. He reported his position secure at the end of 2 July, but his strength was down to five officers and 150 ORs. On 3 July he was able to extend his line rightwards with a mixed party from various battalions while 19th (W) Division completed the capture of La Boisselle. 34th Division was relieved from the line by 23rd Division during the night of 3/4 July.

The 34th Division suffered more infantry casualties than any other division on 1 July 1916, with the Tyneside Scottish Brigade suffering the worst losses of any brigade (the Tyneside Irish Brigade had the next worst):
* 20th NF (1st Tyneside Scottish): 16 officers and 337 ORs killed, 10 officers and 268 ORs wounded; total 631
* 21st NF (2nd Tyneside Scottish): 11 officers and 161 ORs killed, 10 officers and 296 ORs wounded; total 478
* 22nd NF (3rd Tyneside Scottish): 7 officers and 198 ORs killed, 1 officer missing, 14 officers and 319 ORs wounded; total 539
* 23rd NF (4th Tyneside Scottish): 9 officers and 178 ORs killed, 2 officers missing, 7 officers and 444 ORs wounded; total 640
* 102nd MG Co: 1 officer and 6 ORs killed, 5 officers and 24 ORs wounded; total 36

Lieutenant-Col Elphinstone and all the battalion commanders (or acting commanders) of the brigade were among the dead. The 4th Tyneside Scottish had suffered the third-heaviest casualties of any battalion engaged on 1 July.

When the Tyneside Scottish were first raised a request to wear kilts had been refused, though they did wear a Glengarry bonnet in place of the normal Peaked cap. After La Boisselle they were granted the right to wear a 3-inch tartan patch as a backing to their cap badge. One Geordie remarked, &#x27;Man, we&#x27;ll have to fight a hell of a lot of battles before we get our kilts&#x27;.

The casualties among 102nd and 103rd Bdes were so severe that on 6 July they were exchanged for two fresh brigades from 37th Division so that 34th Division could continue the offensive. 102nd and 103rd Brigades were temporarily amalgamated under the command of Brig-Gen Ternan and held the quiet line opposite Monchy-au-Bois and then the more active Vimy Ridge sector while being reinforced.

On 15 August 34th Division left the Somme and marched north to the Armentières sector, where it was rejoined on 22 August by 102nd Bde. It spent the rest of the year routinely holding the line at Bois-Grenier, with regular trench raids.

===Arras===
On 26 January 1917 the division was suddenly rushed from Armentières to go into reserve at Méteren in case the Germans attacked over the now-frozen marshes north of Boezinge. This did not happen, but the division underwent three weeks&#x27; training there for the forthcoming offensive before moving to the Arras sector to continue preparations. The First Battle of the Scarpe launched the Arras Offensive at 05.30 on 9 April. 34th Division was to assault three successive lines of German trenches, designated the Black, Blue and Brown lines, the Black being in front of the start line, the Brown about away. The attack by 102nd Bde went well: the defenders were shattered by the barrage (including an overhead machine gun barrage) and most of the survivors wee eager to surrender. 21st and 22nd NF captured the Blue Line on schedule and the advance was continued by 20th NF on the right and 23rd NF on the left. However, the failure of 103rd Bde meant that 24th NF&#x27;s flank was &#x27;in the air&#x27;, and the battalion was delayed cutting through barbed wire and lost the protection of the creeping barrage. It had a stiff fight for the German support line, taking it by short rushes and losing 165 men in the process. Both 20th and 23rd NF had to dig in a little short of the final objective (the Green Line). Conditions on the bare uplands were bad, and there were deaths from exposure during the night. Next day 103rd Bde was still held up but 102nd Bde occupied the Green Line without difficulty. As the brigade secured its position over the following days amidst snowstorms it was subjected to heavy shelling. Large numbers of men also had to be evacuated sick because of the bad weather. 102nd Brigade moved back to billets on the night of 14/15 April.

Brigadier-Gen Ternan gave up the command of 102nd Bde and was replaced on 22 April 1917 by the younger Brig-Gen N.H.T. Thomson from the Seaforth Highlanders. The brigade returned to the line while the Second Battle of the Scarpe was being fought. The battalions were still weak after the recent fighting, and many of the replacements were poorly trained. On 25 April 34th Division relieved 51st (Highland) Division in the line, with orders to attack on 28 April (Battle of Arleux). For this operation 102nd Bfde was in divisional reserve, but loaned 20th NF to 101st Bde, which was tasked with attacking the village of Rœux. The assault was delivered at 04.25, and 20th NF took over the British front line once 101st Bde had gone forward. THe attack went badly and by nightfall 101st Bde – including 20th NF – had only 25 officers and 790 men left in the line. XVII Corps and 34th Division decided to make a surprise attack that night with 102nd Bde in an attempt to capture the chemical works at Rœux. 22nd NF would jump off from 103rd Bde&#x27;s positions in Cawdor Trench and 23rd NF from 101st Bde&#x27;s Corona Trench. No reconnaissance was possible, and 23rd NF could not get through the crowded communication trenches into position until an hour after the planned Zero hour, Unfortunately, orders to 22nd NF to delay the attack did not reach the battalion in time, and it jumped off as planned at 03.00, quickly ejecting the enemy from Calabar Trench. However, the battalion could make no further progress because the ground ahead was under machine gun fire from three side. 23rd NF, fatigued from its march, attacked at 04.00 up Corona trench, but was also stopped by machine gun fire. 34th Division was now so exhausted that it had to be relieved on 30 April/1 May.

===Greenland Hill and Hargicourt===
34th Division spent the rest of May resting and training, with 102nd Bde round Fienvillers. Reinforcements were scarce: consequently battalions of 34th Division were temporarily reduced from four to three companies. 34th Division went back into the line on 30 May, with 102nd Bde in divisional reserve. 102nd Brigade relieved 101st on 4/5 June and carried out an attack to capture some trenches on the slope of Greenland Hill. Although small-scale, this attack was supported by 164 field guns, numerous heavy guns, all three of the division&#x27;s MG companies and all three TMBs. The assault was made with 20th NF, 21st NF and 22nd NF in line, with 23rd NF in support. Each assaulting battalion had all three companies in line, each in four waves. The first two waves were to capture and mop up the first objective (&#x27;Curly&#x27; and &#x27;Charlie&#x27; trenches), the third and fourth to pass through and take the second objective (&#x27;Cod&#x27; and &#x27;Cuthbert&#x27; trenches). 10th Lincolnshire Regiment from 101st Bde would provide carrying parties, and 103rd Bde would dig a new trench to link up the second objective with the existing front line. Zero was at 20.00, and the barrage crashed down on Curly and Charlie trenches for four minutes and when it lifted the stormers were immediately into the trenches. There was stubborn close-quarters fighting in a few places, but the first objective was cleared with the exception of a small part of 20th NF&#x27;s area. The third and fourth waves quickly disengaged from the fighting and went on to the second objective close behind the barrage, and established themselves by midnight. At 22.00 the 18th NF (the divisional pioneer battalion) was already digging a communication trench across the old No man&#x27;s land while the Lincolns carried up supplies and 208th Field Co, RE, helped to form strongpoints in the new front line. The enemy kept up a heavy barrage all night and made several bombing attacks but these were driven off by rifle grenades and rifle fire. The last German outpost in Curly trench was captured by 20th NF at 14.00 next day, supported by trench mortars, but the battalion still had to call down artillery fire to break up an enemy counter-attack that evening. After 55 hours&#x27; combat, 102nd Bde was relieved on 8 June.

34th Division spent the rest of June refitting and training the replacements it received, but these were not enough to replace all the losses. Then between 8 and 10 July the division moved to Péronne, with 102nd Bde moving into the Hargicourt sector. The area had been devastated by the Germans before they retreated to the Hindenburg Line earlier in the year, and much labour was required to repair roads and erect huts to replace the destroyed buildings. The front line consisted of a chain of posts rather than continuous trenches, and No man&#x27;s land was unusually wide. At first the TMBs could not reach across No man&#x27;s land, but they used some captured German 7.7 cm guns instead. Earl on 26 August, 101st Bde carried out a small attack assisted by 20th and 23rd NF from 102nd Bde and two mortars of 102nd TMB. It was a minor operation planned in great detail, one of a number of such attacks being carried out as diversions from that summer&#x27;s main Ypres Offensive. The objectives were &#x27;Malakoff Farm&#x27; and the adjoining trench system on Cologne Ridge in front of Hargicourt, about in front of the Hindenburg Line proper. The capture of these positions would reduce German observation over British positions. The attack was carefully rehearsed behind the lines where turf had been cut to represent the enemy trenches. 101st Brigade put all its battalions into the line, with 20th NF in reserve behind a railway embankment, while 23rd NF would send a company bombing up &#x27;Rifle Pit Trench&#x27; to link up with the outer flank. Each of 101st Bde&#x27;s four battalions was also loaned a company from 102nd Bde as a carrying party. The barrage came down at 04.30 on 26 August and lifted after four minutes then began to creep towards the enemy front line, followed by the infantry. 101st Brigade pushed through Malakoff Farm and the bombers of 23rd NF had no difficulty linking up with them. However, the following night 103rd Bde failed to complete the capture of the high ground of Cologne Ridge in front Fire directed from this position made the Hargicourt valley dangerous, so 102nd Bde carried out another small formal attack to complete its capture on 9–11 September. It had been taken out of the line to rehearse for this attack, returning on 7 September. Preparations on 8 September were hampered by enemy artillery fire but promptly at 23.45 21st and 23rd NF were formed up on their jumping off tapes in No man&#x27;s land, about from the German trenches. Each battalion had two companies in the front line, each in four waves, the first to cross the first trench (&#x27;Farm&#x27; trench) and form a screen the other side, the second to mop up, and the third and fourth to consolidate. The other two companies were to carry up barbed wire and string it across the whole front, even if fighting was still going on in the trench. The guns opened up at 00.15 and the assaulting waves followed the creeping barrage. The right company of 21st NF lost direction in the mist, but the rest of the attack went well, the enemy fleeing. Brigadier-Gen Thomson then ordered 21st NF to bomb their way forward to join up with the new position, which was consolidated by 22nd NF, 20th Fd Co and the pioneers of 18th NF. German retaliatory fire was heavy, but the position was held. 21st NF attempted to expand their position that afternoon, but the Germans counter-attacked at the same time, and a confused fight ensued under bombardment by both sides. 102nd Brigade completed the capture of the last lengths of trench on 11 September, then handed a secure position over to 101st Bde and went back into divisional reserve. The brigades total casualties were 290 officers and 374 ORs, mostly caused by shellfire after the assault. 34th Division remained in this sector until the end of the month but there were only patrol actions and raids.

===Ypres===
Many of the reinforcements received at the end of September had minimal training, and it was claimed that some of them had never fired their rifles. 34th Division was now transferred north to the Ypres Salient where the offensive was continuing. After arriving on 9 October the division was employed to repair roads so that the advance could continue. 103rd Brigade took over part of the line across the Broembeek valley on 12 October, and was relieved by 102nd Bde on the night of 16/17 October. The troops were now existing in wrecked farms and captured pillboxes linked by duckboard tracks amidst a sea of flooded shellholes. On 19 October 101st Bde relieved the battalions of 102nd Bde in the front line and carried out a preliminary advance (the &#x27;Action of 22 October 1917&#x27;) north of Poelcapelle to protect the left flank of the projected main attack. A company of 20th NF held the line on the right of 101st Bde, standing fast and keeping the enemy under fire. To its right 102nd Bde attacked with 24th/27th NF borrowed from 103rd Bde. Two companies of 24th/27th NF stood fast, the other two pivoted, to keep touch with 18th (Eastern) Division&#x27;s attack further right. Unlike, 101st Bde, which suffered badly, 102nd Bde&#x27;s small operation went well, 24th/27th NF taking all its objectives, including a farm that had been overlooked by 18th (E) Division. The division was withdrawn on 24 October.

===Winter 1917–18===
34th Division spent three months in a quieter sector to the south, then went into reserve in February 1918. By the beginning of 1918 the BEF was suffering a manpower crisis. Brigades were reduced from four to three battalions each, and the remainder were broken up to provide reinforcements for the others. In 34th Division the Tyneside Scottish and Tyneside Irish battalions were amalgamated to form a single 102nd Bde. The 1st and 2nd Tyneside Scottish were disbanded on 3 February and replaced by the 2nd Tyneside Irish from 103rd Bde. At the same time the brigade MG companies were concentrated into a divisional MG battalion. The composition of 102nd Bde therefore was:
* 22nd NF (3rd Tyneside Scottish)
* 23rd NF (4th Tyneside Scottish)
* 25th NF (2nd Tyneside Irish)
* 102nd TMB

===German spring offensive===
34th Division returned to the Arras sector in March 1918. The Germans were soon to launch their Spring offensive, and their plans in the Arras area were quite well known. The offensive began at 04.15 on 21 March with a massive bombardment, mainly on 102nd Bde on the division&#x27;s right and the adjacent 59th (2nd North Midland) Division. The shelling cut telephone lines to the front line battalions and mist shrouded the enemy advance. About 10.00 the enemy broke through 59th (2nd NM) Division&#x27;s left brigade, forcing back the adjacent company of 22nd NF, which had practised this manoeuvre and sent up signal rockets to inform the artillery that this had been done. A company of 25th NF was sent down from brigade reserve to help form a defensive flank, but the enemy advance was too fast. By noon the whole of 25th NF was trying to form a line facing south; about 14.00 A and B Companies and stragglers from other battalions were lining the railway embankment. However, the rest of the brigade was still in the front line, and Germans moving north were behind the battalion&#x27; HQs in a railway cutting in the support line (&#x27;Bunhill Row&#x27;). A signal party trying to restore communications to the HQs was briefly captured, but got away to warn them. The battalion HQs burned their papers and prepared for all-round defence with C Company of 34th MG Bn. At 17.00 Lt-Col Acklom was killed trying to break out with the HQ party of 22nd NF. The position being hopeless, and surrounded by wounded and gassed men, the other two battalion. commanders surrendered at 17.30, having prevented the Germans from rolling up the support line for hours. The companies in the front trench had fallen back slowly, using each communication trench in turn as a defence line (as 34th Division had planned). Finally a frontal attack on the original front line turned these positions, driving them back until the remnants of 22nd and 23rd NF formed a trench block in the support line at &#x27;Queen&#x27;s Lane&#x27;. This held up the advance for some time with rifle and Lewis gun fire, then about 15.30 they were pushed back until they joined up with the defensive flank formed by 101st Bde along &#x27;Factory Avenue&#x27;, where the companies of 25th NF had gathered. That night the survivors of 102nd Bde, together with a company of the 18th BF (Pioneers) and J Special Company, RE, were formed into a 500-strong composite battalion under the command of Maj H.S. Neaves, holding the line between the other two brigades. Brigadier-Gen Thomson established 102nd Bde HQ in the Sensée valley behind St Léger.

The following morning also dawned with mist, covering the German advance, which after a whoile succeeded in penetrating between 101st and 102nd Bdes, the 25th NF losing a few men surrounded and captured. 101st Brigade was forced back by heavy artillery fire, opening a wide gap that the 102nd Bde battalion was too small to fill, even with reinforcement from the pioneers of 18th NF and 207th and 209th Field Companies, RE. The enemy kept probing behind its flank, but at 13.30 three companies of 1st East Lancashire Regiment arrived from 103rd Bde. Together they held their own front in the &#x27;Third System&#x27; trenches behind Henin Hill, but their left flank was forced further and further back as the enemy pushed through towards St Léger. Another group of men from 22nd and 23rd NF assisted 101st Bde on the other side of this salient. Late in the day 31st Division arrived to relieve 34th Division, which withdrew to the rear areas.

===Battle of the Lys===
34th Division was moved north to a quieter area to recuperate, occupying a line in the Houplines sector, in front of Armentières under First Army. The exhausted battalions had to absorb inexperienced reinforcements and improve the neglected defences. Unfortunately, this was the sector chosen for the next phase of the German spring offensive (the Battle of the Lys). It began with heavy mustard gas shelling of Armentières on 7/8 April, the gas drifting across the rear areas of the defences; 34th Division had over 900 gas casualties, mainly among 102nd Bde, the pioneers of 18th NF and sappers of 207th Fd Co, RE. On 8 April the brigade was reinforced by two companies from 15th Royal Scots with 101st Bde in reserve. The bombardment began at 04.00 on 9 April, but the attack did not at first affected 34th Division&#x27;s front, being concentrated against its neighbours to the south, where it broke through 40th Division. Once again, the division was forced to form a defensive flank to the south, while 102nd Bde remained defending Armentières, with Brigade HQ in an old jute factory by the railway line. That night Houplines was heavily bombarded, but 102nd Bde was not attacked. However, the following afternoon it had to evacuate the town, which was now in a dangerous salient following the breakthrough to the south. The orders arrived at 11.45 and 102nd Bde got away without difficulty, crossing the River Lys by 18.30. After the bridges had been destroyed behind them, the troops of 102nd Bde took up position along the north bank of the river with B Company 34th MG Bn, linking up with Second Army to the north. However, 34th Division was still in a narrow salient around Nieppe, packed with troops from First and Second Armies, and no rations arrived that night. 102nd Brigade&#x27;s position, supported by several companies of 34th MG Bn, formed the apex of the salient and came under attack at 05.30 on 11 April. The Germans made no attempt to attack the flanks of the salient, so this attack was probably only intended to pin 34th Division in its vulnerable position. A party penetrated into the houses at Pont-de-Nieppe, and when they began expanding outwards 102nd Bde fell back to the Nieppe Switch line, almost all of the rearguard, C Company, 22nd NF, and several MG teams being killed or captured. At 16.30 orders arrived for 34th Division to fall back up the Bailleul road towards Steenwerck. The brigadiers agreed to begin at 19.30, and by 01.00 on 12 April 102nd Bde and 88th Bde of 29th Division were holding a W-shaped front from Steenwerck station to Pont d&#x27;Achelles, with RE companies filling the gaps. 34th Division HQ now had six brigades under its command, and with good artillery support they mainly managed to maintain their positions throughout 12–13 April despite heavy onslaughts. 23rd NF held up the enemy on the De Seule–Neuve Eglise road, and 25th BF came up from reserve to help form a line facing north, but the whole battalion HQ staff of 22nd NF became casualties when it was hit by a single enemy shell.Late on 13 April 34th Division ordered them to continue in these positions, but the brigadiers on the spot disagreed, arguing that the pressure of four full German divisions was proving too much and a further stand would result in unnecessary casualties: 102nd and 88th Bdes were almost surrounded. They received permission to continue their preparations for withdrawal, and got away without interference. By now 102nd Bde was so reduced in numbers that it was taken out of the line and reorganised as a composite battalion under Lt-Col H.S. Neaves with a strength of 462 all ranks, 34th MG Bn with 10 guns, and 90 men from the Motor Machine Gun Company. 102nd Composite Bn remained in support during the bitter fighting of 14–15 April. Although Bailleul fell, and 34th Division&#x27;s weak brigades were once again in the front line on 16 April, in shallow trenches without any wire, the German attack out of the town was crushed by massed artillery and small-arms fire. The fighting then died down on 34th Division&#x27;s front, and on 21 April it was finally relieved by French troops.

==Reorganised 102nd Brigade==
Until mid-May 34th Division was engaged in digging new defence lines in the rear (though the men were twice called on to &#x27;stand to&#x27; and prepare to defend these positions during the Second Battle of Kemmel and Battle of the Scherpenberg when German breakthroughs of the French line looked possible). After the disasters of the German offensive, the BEF did not have sufficient reinforcements to return all its formations to full strength. The decision was made to reduce some divisions to Training Cadres (TC) to train US troops, with the hope that they could be rebuilt later. 34th Division was one of those selected, its battalions reduced to 10 officers and 45 ORs each, the remainder being posted to other units. On 21 May Brig-Gen E. Hilliam from 15th (Scottish) Division changed places with Brig-Gen Thomson and took command of 102nd Bde. The division also took temporary command of a large number of TCs from other divisions that were being reduced. Over the following weeks the division assisted in training the 28th, 78th and 80th US Divisions, each US brigade HQ being affiliated to a brigade of 34th Division, and each US battalion to a British battalion TC.

Meanwhile reinforcements were being urgently shipped to the Western Front from the Palestine campaign, and on 13 June 34th Division was informed that it would be reconstituted using these units. On 30 June–1 July three Territorial Force battalions from 53rd (Welsh) Division arrived at Proven to reform 102nd Bde:
* 1/4th Bn, Cheshire Regiment
* 1/7th Bn, Cheshire Regiment
* 1/1st Bn, Herefordshire Regiment
* 102nd TMB – reformed 10 July

Of the original battalions of the brigade converted to TCs, 22nd NF joined 16th Division, was reconstituted in England, and later returned to the Western Front for the last weeks of the war; the 23rd and 25th NF remained as TCs with 39th Division and later 197th Bde of 66th Division, preparing US and British troops for frontline service until the end of the war.

===Soissons===
As soon as this reorganisation was complete 34th Division was sent to reinforce the French sector of the front. When the Germans launched the last effort of their Spring Offensive on 15 July (the Second Battle of the Marne), the division was diverted and by the evening of 18 July was concentrated round Senlis. The infantry were then moved up by lorry and by 03.00 on 23 July had completed the relief of a French division in the front line. The 34th Division immediately joined in the French counter-attack (the Battle of the Soissonnais and the Ourcq) on 23 July. Two French corps attacked, and 34th Division&#x27;s role was to link the two. At 07.15 the division was ordered to attack at 07.40. 102nd Brigade on the right received the order and attacked on time, but due to communication problems, 101st Bde on the right was late setting off (08.00) and was stopped in its tracks, while the French brigade on the left did not advance at all. 102nd Brigade advanced alone through high standing corn behind its creeping barrage, with 1/7th Cheshires on the right and 1/1st Herefords left (each with 8 Vickers guns from 34th MG Bn), and made about before being stopped by machine gun fire from three directions. It was ordered to consolidate the line it had gained, and remained there until relieved on 28 July. The division immediately moved during the night of 28/29 July to the Bois de la Baillette to attack Beugneux Ridge. For this attack 1/4th Cheshires was in corps reserve, the rest of 102nd Bde in divisional reserve. However, the attack got held up, and the divisional reserve (102nd Bde with an MG company and 2.4th Somerset Light Infantry (SLI)) was called forward to renew the attack. This coincided with a heavy German counter-attack against the French to the left, and the whole Allied line fell back; all three brigades of 34th Division were in line to hold this position. The division renewed its attack on 1 August; 102nd Bde HQ commanded the divisional reserve consisting of 1/7th Cheshires, 2/4th SLI, 34th MG Bn (less two companies) and the three RE companies. The other battalions of 102nd Bde had special tasks on either flank of the division. 1/1st Herefords were intended to capture some high ground to the south of 101st Bde, but could make no progress. 1/4th Cheshires reinforced the north flank of 103rd Bde; this move was successful and the battalion was able to hand over to French troops by 11.00. The enemy slipped away that night, and French troops passed through 34th Division on 2 August to pursue them. After the battle, the division entrained to return to the British front.

===Hundred Days Offensive===
The division then returned to British command to participate in the final advance of the Hundred Days Offensive. From 7 to 16 August it was refitting and training. It then went into the line in the Ypres sector on 21 August, with 102nd Bde in reserve. The Allied offensive had begun further south on 8 August, and the enemy had begun to give ground south of Ypres. It was planned that 102nd Bde would be attached to 41st Division to attack and recapture Kemmel Hill, but patrols from 34th Division were able to seize the feature without a formal attack. 102nd Brigade took over from 101st and 103rd Bdes on 2/3 September and 1/7th Cheshires were able to advance the line during the day. Next morning the battalion advanced behind a creeping barrage and by the end of the day 1/7th Cheshires and 1/1st Herefords had reached &#x27;Peckham Farm&#x27; and &#x27;Ulster Road&#x27; on the slopes of Messines Ridge. The division was then relieved and rested for two weeks.

34th Division attacked on the first day of the Fifth Battle of Ypres on 28 September. The morning attack by 101st and 103rd Bdes consisted of pushing forward strong patrols protected by smoke barrages. The advance continued that night, and by 08.30 next day 1/7th Cheshires were able to pass through and reach the Ypres–Comines Canal. Successful turning movements by neighbouring divisions meant that 34th Division was now squeezed out of the line.

A few days later the division took over holding a section of the line until the Battle of Courtrai on 14 October. 102nd Brigade formed the right of 34th Division&#x27;s attack, with 1/4th Cheshires on the left, 1/7th Cheshires on the right, and 1/1st Herefords in the rear. The jumping-off line had to be carefully adjusted to conform to the barrage line, but all troops were in position by 04.25. The enemy was active with his artillery from 04.15, particularly gas shelling, and 1/4th Cheshires&#x27; battalion HQ was hit twice, with many casualties. The barrage came down at 05.32, then began creeping forwards when the attack began three minutes later. With morning fog, enemy gas, and a smoke barrage fired to mask the village of Geluwe, the visibility was no more than 5 m, and attacking infantry were led by compass, many of them holding the belt of the man at front. Casualties were caused by enemy outposts too far forward to be included in the barrage (the trench mortars had tried to deal with them), but thereafter progress to the first objective, the Black Line ahead, was straightforward, and prisoners were taken. After a pause at the Black Line, the attack was resumed at 06.18, with A and B Companies of 1/4th Cheshires making a rapid advance to Coucou and then probing ahead to the Menin Depot and the outskirts of Menin itself. The battalion took numerous prisoners, a field gun, and several machine guns. 1/7th Cheshires also reached the outskirts of Menin. 102nd Brigade consolidated this line (the Blue Line) behind a protective barrage while the remaining pillboxes and outposts were mopped up. Machine gun fire prevented patrols from entering Menin during the night while the enemy destroyed their stores there, but early on 15 October 1/4th Cheshires pushed through the town. Menin was quickly occupied by 102nd Bde, which established posts along the River Lys at the sites of &#x27;Mongrel&#x27; and &#x27;Marathon&#x27; bridges. 1/1st Herefords crossed over the ruins of Marathon Bridge and patrolled beyond the river on 15/16 June. The following night the brigade was relieved.

From now on, 34th Division operated as brigade groups, each infantry brigade accompanied by a field artillery brigade, an RE company and a company of 34th MG Bn. On 25 October 102nd took the lead for the Action at Ooteghem. Before the main attack, 1/7th Cheshires made a subsidiary attack at 03.00 to secure the crossings of the Bossuit–Courtrai Canal. It was supported by a barrage by all three field brigades of 34th Divisional Artillery and 34th MG Bn. The three companies sent forwards could not cross the canal because of machine gun fire, but A and C cleared Bossuit; B Company at Lock 4 was counter-attacked, losing heavily, but was able to cross at 15.00 when the main attack came abreast of it. The division&#x27;s main attack was made at 09.05 by 1/4th Cheshires supported by 1/1st Herefords. The barrage was provided by 34th and 41st Divisional Artillery, with smoke barrages to cover the bridging operations and heavy batteries shelling the road and selected targets. Opposition was slight and the canal tunnel was cleared by 09.30 and the village of Moen by 15.00. 1/4th Cheshires then went forward, with 1/1st Herefords protecting its open flank, and as darkness fell it reached its objective at Autryve, close to the River Schelde, liberating Belgian civilians. In this final successful action the brigade&#x27;s losses were only 87 (including 25 captured at Lock 4) and it took an equal number of prisoners. It was relieved on 27 October and did not take part in the Action at Tiegem on 31 October.

On 3 November 34th Division marched back to the Courtrai area where it was refitting and training in corps reserve when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November 1918.

==Post-Armistice==
34th Division was selected to form part of the occupation forces in Germany (the British Army of the Rhine, but first it moved to the Lessines area on 17 November to continue training. &#x27;Pivotal&#x27; men needed at home such as miners began to be demobilised. It spent 19 December to 17 January 1919 around Namur and then entrained for the Rhine, completing its takeover of the right sector of the Cologne bridgehead on 29 January. In March 34th Division was reconstituted as Eastern Division and 102nd Bde had the following organisation:
* 7th Bn, Cheshire Regiment
* 25th (S) Bn, Northumberland Fusiliers (2nd Tyneside Irish) – reformed from cadre; left April 1919
* 51st (S) Bn, Bedfordshire Regiment
* 52nd (S) Bn, Bedfordshire Regiment
* 53rd (S) Bn, Bedfordshire Regiment – joined April 1919 
Eastern Division and its brigades were disbanded in July 1919.
102nd Brigade was not reformed during World War II, although a new Tyneside Scottish was formed in 1939 as a battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, later affiliated to the Black Watch.

==Commanders==
The following officers commanded 102nd Bde during its existence:
* Brig-Gen R.B. Fell, appointed to original 102nd Bde 29 November 1914
* Brig-Gen T.P.B. Ternan, appointed to 123rd Bde 28 December 1914
* Brig-Gen N.H.T. Thomson, from 22 April 1917
* Brig-Gen E. Hilliam, from 21 May 1918 to Armistice

==Memorials==
A memorial was dedicated to the fallen of the Tyneside Scottish Brigade at La Boisselle. It was unveiled by Marshal Ferdinand Foch. There are memorials to 34th Division at La Boisselle and at Mont Noir (Zwarteberg) where it fought during the Battle of the Lys.

<text>Tyneside Scottish is an honour title which has been held by a variety of British Army units since 1914. The Regiments which have held the title are the Northumberland Fusiliers, Durham Light Infantry, Black Watch and Royal Artillery. The Tyneside Scottish title is currently maintained by 204 (Tyneside Scottish) Battery Royal Artillery.

== History ==
===First World War===
The origins of the Tyneside Scottish are in the Kitchener&#x27;s Army and the call to arms in the First World War. The Recruitment to the British Army during the First World War saw the raising of the Pals battalion. The Tyneside Scottish Committee was formed and raised four service Battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers. These were the 20th (Service) Battalion (1st Tyneside Scottish), 21st (Service) Battalion (2nd Tyneside Scottish), 22nd (Service) Battalion (3rd Tyneside Scottish) and 23rd (Service) Battalion (4th Tyneside Scottish). They formed the 102nd (Tyneside Scottish) Brigade, part of the 34th Division. The 29th (Reserve) Battalion and the 33rd (Reserve) Battalion were formed from the depot companies of the Tyneside Scottish battalions.

The Brigade&#x27;s first major action was the Battle of the Somme where it sustained a large number of casualties. The Brigade was subsequently brought up to strength and served at Armentiers, Battle of Arras, and the final battles of 1918. The Brigade was disbanded in 1918.

===Second World War===
In March 1939 the TA expanded and the 12th (Tyneside Scottish) Battalion, the Durham Light Infantry was authorised to be raised as the Tyneside Scottish. In February 1940 the battalion secured affiliation with a Scottish unit and became the 1st Battalion Tyneside Scottish, Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment). The battalion deployed to France as part of as part of the British Expeditionary Force and were part of the Dunkirk evacuation. Following a period of Home Defence, 1st Tyneside Scottish joined the 49th (West Riding) Division and were sent to Iceland. Returning to England in 1942 another period of Home Defence preceded the Normandy landings in 1944. The battalion were engaged in Operation Martlet gaining the Battle Honour &quot;Defence of Rauray&quot;. Following the Battle and subsequent actions in the Caen area, the battalion was reduced to cadre strength and subsequently placed in suspended animation.

===Post-war===
In January 1947 on the re-constitution of the Territorial Army, the honour title passed to the Royal Artillery. Initially the title was held by 670th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (Tyneside Scottish), before passing to a Battery, 439th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA (based in Tynemouth) in March 1955. 439th Light Air Defence Regiment was one of four regiments that amalgamated to form 101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery in 1967. In 1974, the Tyneside Scottish title was adopted by 204 (Tyneside Scottish) Battery Royal Artillery, part of 101st (Northumbrian) Regiment Royal Artillery.

== Tyneside Scottish Memorials ==
The memorial to the Tyneside Scottish Brigade is situated at La Boiselle, Somme, where the Brigade sustained heavy casualties on first day of the Somme. The memorial, in the form of a seat also commemorates the losses of the Tyneside Irish. The memorial was unveiled in 1920 by Marshal Foch.

<text>PaRappa Rappa is a fictional character created by Japanese musician Masaya Matsuura and American artist Rodney Greenblat. PaRappa first appears as the title character of the 1996 rhythm video game &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;, developed by NanaOn-Sha for Sony Interactive Entertainment&#x27;s PlayStation console.

Within the series, PaRappa is depicted as a paper-thin two-dimensional anthropomorphic dog with wholesome personality traits and is enthusiastic about rap music. Matsuura came up with the character&#x27;s musical style and cut-out visual concept, whereas Greenblat is responsible for the character&#x27;s final appearance and art style, which is similar to his prior children&#x27;s books and CD-ROM projects.

After 1996&#x27;s &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; met with significant commercial success and critical acclaim, PaRappa was for a time considered to be a mascot for the fledging PlayStation brand in its native Japan. PaRappa&#x27;s popularity spawned a media franchise that included the 1999 spin-off title &quot;Um Jammer Lammy,&quot; the 2001 sequel &quot;PaRappa the Rapper 2&quot;, and a number of media adaptations outside of video games. The character is generally well received by critics in retrospective assessments and is often cited as one of the most memorable video game characters associated with the PlayStation brand.

==Development==
PaRappa is presented as a square-headed dog with oversized eyes and black floppy ears sticking out from under an orange beanie. He wears a blue sleeveless shirt, dark blue baggy pants, and red sneakers. PaRappa&#x27;s co-creators are Masaya Matsuura, a musician and video game designer who founded the Japanese video game company NanaOn-Sha, and Rodney Greenblat, a graphic artist and illustrator who worked in children&#x27;s books prior to his involvement in the video game industry. The name PaRappa originated as a word play meaning &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;paper thin&quot; in Japanese, which references the character&#x27;s physical nature. PaRappa is voiced by hip hop artist Dred Foxx in all video game appearances, including the 2012 crossover fighting game &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot;. In the Japan-exclusive anime, Miyu Irino was PaRappa&#x27;s voice actor.

In an interview with &quot;Game Developer&quot;, Greenblat described Matsuura as PaRappa&#x27;s &quot;father&quot;, and himself as the character&#x27;s &quot;mother&quot;. During the early-to-mid 1990s, Greenblat was given numerous creative work opportunities by Sony Interactive Entertainment after he gained some recognition for his flair in creating cute characters that appeal to Japanese consumers. On one occasion, a Sony employee who was connected to the company&#x27;s licensing group invited Greenblat to meet Matsuura&#x27;s team, who were developing an experimental video game for the then-upcoming PlayStation console. At the time, Matsuura was aware of Greenblat&#x27;s work from his past children&#x27;s books and CD-ROM projects, and was already using placeholder characters from Greenblat&#x27;s 1993 CD-ROM game &quot;Dazzeloids&quot; for the project. Greenblat noted that the team already knew they wanted to make a rap music game, and they were looking for someone to handle its artistic side. Matsuura invited Greenblat to work on the project, a call and response game where different musical samples could be plugged in and played to a rhythm like a DJ box, and its characters would be animated to the rhythm.

Greenblat was commissioned by Sony to use some of his existing characters and to create a new protagonist. He described the process of character design to be collaborative by nature: he worked with both Matsuura and Gabin Ito, the project&#x27;s writer, and would create sketches freely based on their suggestions or ideas for a specific character&#x27;s personality. According to Greenblat, it takes a short time for him to produce character sketches by himself, but a lot more time for an entire team to decide by consensus. He recalled that character designs were sometimes accepted relatively quickly, while others may involve many attempts and revisions before it is finalized. For example, he only needed a fortnight to finalize PaRappa&#x27;s design, whereas the lead character of the 1999 spin-off title &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot; took approximately half a year by comparison. In terms of characterization, the team wanted to pursue the concept of a player character who would consult with several mentors or instructors who would teach him how to do a rap; the teacher would say one thing, and the player character would repeat it. Greenblat was asked by Matsuura to design several variations of characters that can rap for the game&#x27;s lead character, with Matsuura initially proposing an anthropomorphic shrimp as the lead character. Greenblat recalled that the team wanted a character who was &quot;trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, romantic and a little insecure&quot;. He believed that a dog embody all of these requested traits, and decided to make several sketches of canine-themed rapper characters, and worked with the team to pick out the best design among the character&#x27;s iterations.
Greenblat noted that prior to the release of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot;, Sony did not yet have a strong mascot that would serve as the &quot;face&quot; of the company and for the PlayStation console. He believed that PaRappa&#x27;s music, energy and cool factor made him &quot;the perfect face&quot; and that the character had the potential to be Sony&#x27;s long term answer to Nintendo&#x27;s Mario. With regards to PaRappa&#x27;s short-lived prominence in the video game industry, Greenblat attributed the character&#x27;s gradual loss of popularity to a series of decisions made by company executives which did not capitalize on the character&#x27;s potential. He was frustrated with the creative direction of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; anime television series in particular: he was asked to work as the show&#x27;s character designer, but was not allowed to write or be part of the show&#x27;s production. Greenblat believed that the show undermined the character&#x27;s appeal with the video game series&#x27; core audience, which were predominantly teenagers, as Sony wanted to pursue a marketing strategy that prioritized merchandising opportunities for young children. Greenblat noted that the show never caught on with its target audience, and that when it was cancelled by January 2002, all the involved companies decided to move on from the character and associated intellectual property altogether.

Matsuura told &quot;Engadget&quot; during a pre-Tokyo Game Show meeting in 2011 that the &quot;possibility of remaking or rebuilding or making sequels&quot; starring PaRappa has always been a topic of discussion. He believed that a handheld platform like the upcoming PlayStation Vita represented an incentive to revisit a video game featuring PaRappa with regards to both content and business issues. Matsuura explained that to only do handheld platforms could provide a better experience with regards to risk of latency compared to home consoles, but also a new business model could be attempted with regards to developing a new rhythm game starring PaRappa. Greenblat expressed a hope that Sony would realize PaRappa&#x27;s &quot;golden true potential&quot; in the rhythm game genre, and that he would given further opportunities to design some new games. In 2013, Foxx led a social media campaign to persuade Sony into commissioning a new game in the rhythm action series.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
The plot of 1996&#x27;s &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; follows PaRappa&#x27;s attempts to impress his love interest, an anthropomorphic sunflower named Sunny Funny. Each of the game&#x27;s stages opens with a cutscene establishing a humorous and upbeat scenario that PaRappa needs to resolve, such as learning karate from Chop Chop Master Onion in order to defend Sunny from local bullies, or learning how to drive so he could take Sunny on a trip to the beach. During each sequence, the players must tap a complex sequence of buttons to rhythmically synchronizes with the on-screen directions, while watching and listening to PaRappa&#x27;s raps about his experiences and the repetition of his catchphrase, &quot;I know...I gotta believe!&quot;

A bonus mode was included in the 1999 spin-off title &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot;, which the entire game (excluding Stage 1) could be replayed with PaRappa as the protagonist, complete with his own versions of the game&#x27;s stages.

PaRappa is the lead character of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper 2&quot;, which was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2001 in Japan and 2002 in North America and Europe. The sequel&#x27;s plot revolve around noodles as a plot device, and features the fathers of both PaRappa and Sunny in an expanded role.

PaRappa appears as a playable character in &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot;, released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in November 2012. His quick and agile play style revolves around using his karate taught to him by Chop Chop Master Onion as well as moves inspired by his love of music and skateboarding.

PaRappa makes a cameo appearance in the PlayStation 5 launch title, 2020&#x27;s &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot;, a celebration of the PlayStation brand.

===In other media===
In 2000, Greenblat released a standalone collection of comics called &quot;RodneyFun Comic Collection 1&quot;, which features PaRappa and several supporting characters dealing with relatable albeit eccentrically portrayed life problems. One of the storylines involve PaRappa trying to get a job to afford a new game.

PaRappa is the lead character of an eponymous 30-episode anime television series, produced by J.C. Staff and Production I.G. Directed by Hiroaki Sakurai, it aired in Japan between 14 April 2001 and 14 January 2002. The show was intended as a tie-in with the release of 2001&#x27;s &quot;PaRappa the Rapper 2&quot; and to increase merchandise sales, and 
marked the first instance that PaRappa was voiced in Japanese. The TV series marked the first appearance of PaRappa&#x27;s sister Pinto and her pet Uee.

PaRappa appears as a supporting character in an anime series by Doga Kobo, titled , which began airing in October 2016 as part of the &quot;#Hi Paul&quot; variety show, following a pilot episode which aired on 18 August 2016. It consists of a series of short segments featuring supporting character PJ Berri as its lead, which aired as part of Fuji TV’s Hi Poul programming block. It was announced to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the original &quot;PaRappa The Rapper&quot; as well as the anime’s 15th anniversary.

==Cultural impact==
===Promotion and merchandise===
An arrangement album styled after PaRappa and PJ Berri titled &quot;PJ &amp; Parappa – I Scream!&quot; was released to promote &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot;, which remixes many of the game&#x27;s songs from stages and cutscenes to include full-length rap routines performed by Dred Foxx as PaRappa. Some of its tracks were performed by the game’s composers and performers for the launch party of &quot;Um Jammer Lammy&quot; at New York&#x27;s The Roxy nightclub.

Sony published an interview with Rodney Greenblat on its website to promote the release of the PlayStation Portable (PSP) port of the original &quot;PaRappa The Rapper&quot;. It featured select questions provided by eu.playstation.com forum members, who were each promised a PaRappa plushie based on Greenblat&#x27;s design as a reward. Sony also announced several PaRappa promotions throughout the summer of 2007 to promote the release of the first game&#x27;s PSP port, including a limited edition t-shirt featuring PaRappa by Paul Frank Industries.

In a video uploaded to the Official PlayStation Europe YouTube channel which coincided with the launch of &quot;PaRappa the Rapper Remastered&quot; for PlayStation 4 in April 2017, several interviewees discuss PaRappa&#x27;s cultural significance.

In 2021, Japanese skateboard brand WIND AND SEA launched a &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; &quot;capsule&quot;, a collection of clothing items like t-shirts, long sleeves, bucket hats, beanies, cushions, slippers, and keychains which feature the iconography of PaRappa as well as other series characters.

===Reception===
PaRappa has been featured in a number of &quot;top&quot; character lists by critics. In 2008 &quot;MTV&quot; named PaRappa the greatest video game canine character. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; staff ranked PaRappa number 87 in a 2012 list of the best heroes or protagonists in games. IGN ranked PaRappa 8th place in their 2019 list of the &quot;Top 10 Dogs in Video Games&quot;.

Critics noted that PaRappa was created at the very moment in which Japanese hip-hop transitioned from a small subculture to a mainstream phenomenon. Noting the character&#x27;s enthusiasm in spite of his goofy nature, J. C. Herz described PaRappa in an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1998 as the &quot;Will Smith of video game characters&quot;. He observed that the character &quot;manages to be hip by not being cool, a contrast to the sneering action heroes who have become parodies of themselves&quot;. In the 2017 publication &quot;100 Greatest Video Game Characters&quot;, Ted Dickinson and Robert Mejia said PaRappa&#x27;s design offers insight into the transnational uptake and circulation of both African American and Japanese cultures. Within the context of Japanese culture in the mid-1990s, PaRappa&#x27;s exaggerated facial features and youthful appearance situate him as a product of its &quot;kawaii&quot; culture, the devotion to an aesthetic which &quot;idolizes the presocial&quot; as a form of escapism from the structures of society that affects the likelihood of one&#x27;s success. PaRappa&#x27;s &quot;kawaii&quot; presentation is also grounded in his unbridled optimism, and in his childlike interspecies love for Sunny Funny which is characterized as adorable and depoliticized. Dickinson and Mejia observed that PaRappa and his music is disconnected from the &quot;historically oppositional politics&quot; of African American music and is firmly on the side of the &quot;party rap&quot; scenes favored by Japanese record labels in the mid-1990s, which appropriates the hi-hop genre&#x27;s commercial iconography. Nevertheless, they concluded that the transnational circulation of hip-hop has created a space of productive difference for Japanese youth, allowing them to think through the challenges unique to their various circumstances, and that in this instance PaRappa&#x27;s character and music is a &quot;good faith form of appropriation&quot; which still offers significant cultural meaning to Japanese consumers of that time period.

PaRappa&#x27;s appearance in &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot; was met with a mixed response. Greenblat was not impressed to see the character portrayed in a weapon-filled battle game, although he was pleased that PaRappa appeared to be making a comeback with further video game appearances and he did consider &quot;Battle Royale&quot; to be a fun game. Ishaan Sahdev from &quot;Siliconera&quot; assessed PaRappa&#x27;s play style as &quot;brutal&quot; and accessible in a similar fashion as Kratos from &quot;God of War&quot;, but is offset by his very limited range. Greg Miller from IGN had a good impression of playing with PaRappa, praising his &quot;rad 2D-like&quot; art style where he folds like a piece of paper to move as well as his arsenal of general uses, but felt he is held back by his &quot;Level 3 Super&quot; move. On the other hand, Jeff Marchiafava from &quot;Game Informer&quot; considered PaRappa to be among the game&#x27;s worst characters and mocked him as being inept and out of place. Apollo Chungus from &quot;Hardcoregaming101&quot; praised the reprisal of Dred Foxx as PaRappa and the character&#x27;s overall presentation, but felt that the shading of his colors to fit in with the rest of the game ends up with a &quot;gauche&quot; look. He also criticized both his moveset and his campaign to be underwhelming.

===In popular culture===
Like Crash Bandicoot, whose debut game was released on the same day, PaRappa went on to become an iconic mascot character for the PlayStation brand due to the international commercial success of the first &quot;PaRappa the Rapper&quot; game. PaRappa has been referenced in popular culture, and as the subject of fan labor activities such as cosplay. A cast member of the webseries Mega64 appears as PaRappa in a 2008 episode. PaRappa appeared in three sketches in the Adult Swim television show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. In one of the segments of the show, PaRappa is picked over his competitor in a freestyle battle by 50 Cent, who appears as himself, and is signed to his G-Unit label.

<doc id="1067057" wikidata="Q1147796" url="?curid=1067057" title="ReplayGain">
<text>ReplayGain is a proposed technical standard published by David Robinson in 2001 to measure and normalize the perceived loudness of audio in computer audio formats such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. It allows media players to normalize loudness for individual tracks or albums. This avoids the common problem of having to manually adjust volume levels between tracks when playing audio files from albums that have been mastered at different loudness levels.

Although this de facto standard is now formally known as ReplayGain, it was originally known as Replay Gain and is sometimes abbreviated RG.

ReplayGain is supported in a large number of media software and portable devices.

==Operation==
ReplayGain works by first performing a psychoacoustic analysis of an entire audio track or album to measure peak level and perceived loudness. Equal-loudness contours are used to compensate for frequency effects and statistical analysis is used to accommodate for effects related to time. The difference between the measured perceived loudness and the desired target loudness is calculated; this is considered the ideal replay gain value. Typically, the replay gain and peak level values are then stored as metadata in the audio file. ReplayGain-capable audio players use the replay gain metadata to automatically attenuate or amplify the signal on a per-track or per-album basis such that tracks or albums play at a similar loudness level. The peak level metadata can be used to prevent gain adjustments from inducing clipping in the playback device.

===Metadata===
The original ReplayGain proposal specified an 8-byte field in the header of any file. Most implementations now use tags for ReplayGain information. FLAC and Ogg Vorbis use the codice_1 Vorbis comment fields. MP3 files usually use ID3v2. Other formats such as AAC and WMA use their native tag formats with a specially formatted tag entry listing the track&#x27;s replay gain and peak loudness.

ReplayGain utilities usually add metadata to the audio files without altering the original audio data. Alternatively, a tool can amplify or attenuate the data itself and save the result to another, gain-adjusted audio file; this is not perfectly reversible in most cases. Some lossy audio formats, such as MP3, are structured in a way that they encode the volume of each compressed frame in a stream, and tools such as MP3Gain take advantage of this for directly applying the gain adjustment to MP3 files, adding undo information so that the process is reversible.

===Target loudness===
The target loudness is specified as the loudness of a stereo pink noise signal played back at 89 dB sound pressure level or −14 dB relative to full scale. This is based on SMPTE recommendation RP 200:2002, which specifies a similar method for calibrating playback levels in movie theaters using a reference level 6 dB lower (83 dB SPL, −20 dBFS).

=== Track-gain and album-gain ===
ReplayGain analysis can be performed on individual tracks so that all tracks will be of equal volume on playback. Analysis can also be performed on a per-album basis. In album-gain analysis an additional peak-value and gain-value, which will be shared by the whole album, is calculated. Using the album-gain values during playback will preserve the volume differences among tracks on an album.

On playback, listeners may decide if they want all tracks to sound equally loud or if they want all albums to sound equally loud with different tracks having different loudness. In album-gain mode, when album-gain data is missing, players should use track-gain data instead.

== Alternatives ==
* Peak amplitude is not a reliable indicator of loudness, so consequently peak normalization does not offer reliable normalization of perceived loudness. RMS normalization is more accurate but does not take into account psychoacoustic aspects of loudness perception.
* With dynamic range compression, volume may be altered on the fly on playback producing a variable-gain normalization, as opposed to the constant gain as rendered by ReplayGain. While dynamic range compression is beneficial in keeping volume constant, it changes the artistic intent of the recording.
* &quot;Sound Check&quot; is a proprietary Apple Inc. technology similar in function to ReplayGain. It is available in iTunes and on the iPod.
* Standard measurement algorithms for broadcast loudness monitoring applications have recently been developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-R BS.1770) and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU R128). This new method has been used to measure loudness in newer ReplayGain utilities such as foobar2000 (since 1.1.6) and loudgain.

<doc id="1067058" wikidata="Q41172" url="?curid=1067058" title="Ulleungdo">
<text>Ulleungdo (; ), also spelled Ulreungdo, is a South Korean island east of the Korean Peninsula in the Sea of Japan. It was formerly known as Dagelet Island or Argonaut Island in Europe. Volcanic in origin, the rocky steep-sided island is the top of a large stratovolcano which rises from the seafloor, reaching a maximum elevation of at Seonginbong Peak. The island is in length and in width; it has an area of . It has a population of 10,426 inhabitants.

The island makes up the main part of Ulleung County, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, and is a popular tourist destination. The main city of Ulleung-do is the port of Dodong (), which serves as the main ferry port between Ulleung-do and the South Korean mainland. After tourism, the main economic activity is fishing, including its well-known harvest of squid, which can be seen drying in the sun in many places.

== History ==

Archaeological evidence indicates that the island was first inhabited in the 1st millennium BC. The first confirmed historical reference to Ulleung-do is in the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; for the year 512. In that year, the Silla general Kim Isabu conquered the island, which had previously been the autonomous nation of Usan-guk. Some accounts relate that he used a number of wooden lions to intimidate the population, threatening to turn them loose unless they surrendered.

Usan-guk did not remain under the Silla rule, however, and the island did not become a permanent political part of Korea until 930, when it was annexed by Goryeo. Ulleungdo was attacked a number of times during the late Goryeo and early Joseon dynasties. It was devastated by Jurchen pirate raids in the 11th century, and by Wokou pirate raids in the 14th century. A clash with Japan over fishing rights in the 1690s was precipitated by the Korean fisherman An Yong-bok. In response to these difficulties, Joseon adopted an &quot;empty-island&quot; policy which however proved impossible to enforce. The empty-island policy was officially rescinded in 1881, after which the government sought to encourage additional settlement of Ulleungdo.

American whaleships cruised for right whales off the island between 1848 and 1892. Some went ashore nearby Jukdo to club pinnipeds.

== Geography and climate==
Ulleungdo is a volcanic island that rose from the seabed during the Cenozoic period, and consists of trachyte, andesite, and basalt. Hot spot volcanic activity by the General Isabu seamount, dissolved Simheungtaek seamount and Liancourt Rocks and Ulleung Island with An Yong-bok seamount was created as well. Liancourt Rocks is 4.6 million years ago estimated 2.5 million years ago, and the creation of Ulleungdo to us, 2.5 million years ago in 5,000 years ago.

The island consists primarily of trachyandesite rock. A major explosive eruption around 8000 BCE decapitated its top to form a caldera.

There is Seonginbong Peak in the center of the island. The Nari Basin is part of a caldera in the northern part of the island, and is the island&#x27;s only flat surface.

Ulleung-do has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), though it resembles the west coast of Japan much more than Korea, since in winter rainfall is heavy if less so than in such wet cities as Kanazawa or Akita. It is generally cloudy in the winter if again not so markedly as in the previously-mentioned Japanese cities. 
*Highest Temperature: on August 8, 2013
*Lowest Temperature: on February 26, 1981
*Highest Daily Precipitation: on September 3, 1981
*Wettest Year: in 2003

== Flora and fauna ==
The island and surrounding water were registered as a marine protected area to secure rich biodiversity in 2014.

The rowan tree species sorbus ulleungensis is endemic to the island.

As above mentioned, North Pacific right whales and pinnipeds were targeted by whalers and sealers in the adjacent waters. Fin whales were also commonly observed historically, and other cetaceans, such as minke whales and dolphins, may appear around the island.

Japanese sea lions, now extinct, once bred on the island.

A 2013 study estimated that 1,177 species of insects inhabit the island.

== Tourism ==
Favorite activities for tourists are hiking, fishing, and eating hoe (a Korean raw fish dish). Sightseeing boats make regular three-hour circuits about Ulleung-do, departing from the harbor at Dodong and passing by all the points of interest along the coast, including many interesting rock formations and the small neighboring island of Jukdo. Other scenic sites are Seonginbong, the highest peak on the island (); Bongnae waterfall; the &quot;natural icehouse&quot;; and a coastal cliff from which the Liancourt Rocks can be discerned in the distance.

An airport on the island was planned since 2013 and is under construction since 2020. The design of the new airport was revamped in 2023 for larger aircraft and is expected to open in 2025.

<doc id="1067062" wikidata="Q741128" url="?curid=1067062" title="Norton AntiVirus">
<text>Norton AntiVirus is an anti-virus or anti-malware software product founded by Peter Norton, developed and distributed by Symantec (now Gen Digital) since 1990 as part of its Norton family of computer security products. It uses signatures and heuristics to identify viruses. Other features included in it are e-mail spam filtering and phishing protection.

Symantec distributes the product as a download, a box copy, and as OEM software. Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security, a related product, held a 25% US retail market share for security suites as of 2017. Competitors, in terms of market share in this study, include antivirus products from McAfee, Trend Micro, and Kaspersky Lab.

Norton AntiVirus runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. Windows 7 support was in development for versions 2006 through 2008. Version 2009 has Windows 7 supported update already. Versions 2010, 2011, and 2012 all natively support Windows 7, without needing an update. Version 12 is the only version fully compatible with Mac OS X Lion.
With the 2015 series of products, Symantec made changes in its portfolio and briefly discontinued Norton AntiVirus. This action was later reversed with the introduction of Norton AntiVirus Basic.

== Origins ==
In May 1989, Symantec launched Symantec Antivirus for the Macintosh (SAM). SAM 2.0, released March 1990, incorporated technology allowing users to easily update SAM to intercept and eliminate new viruses, including many that didn&#x27;t exist at the time of the program&#x27;s release.

In August 1990 Symantec acquired Peter Norton Computing from Peter Norton. Norton and his company developed various DOS utilities including the Norton Utilities, which did not include antivirus features. Symantec continued the development of acquired technologies. The technologies are marketed under the name of &quot;Norton&quot;, with the tagline &quot;from Symantec&quot;. Norton&#x27;s crossed-arm pose, a registered U.S. trademark, was traditionally featured on Norton product packaging. However, his pose was later moved to the spine of the packaging, and eventually dropped altogether.

With the 1998 version 5.0 update, SAM was renamed Norton AntiVirus (NAV) for Macintosh.

== Windows/DOS editions ==

By early 1991, U.S. computers were invaded by hundreds of foreign virus strains and corporate PC infection was becoming a serious problem. Symantec&#x27;s Norton Group launched Norton AntiVirus 1.0 (NAV) for PC and compatible computers. Ads for the product, with suggested retail $129, featured Norton in his crossed-arm pose, wearing a pink shirt and surgical mask covering his nose and mouth.

Due to bug in the software, the original Norton Antivirus 1.0 does not repair infected files or boot sectors properly. This was fixed when version 1.5 was released in June 1991, along with the addition of the option of installing multiple scan levels of the Norton Antivirus Intercept (later renamed to Norton Antivirus Auto-Protect starting off with Norton Antivirus 3.0 released in September 1993.

Norton Antivirus 2.0 was released in December 1991, and introduced the feature of creating a rescue disk, which would include the partition table, CMOS settings memory information, and boot sector of a hard disk of an MS-DOS computer system. This is very handy in case a virus that its definitions do not detect, overwrite this information or move the boot sector to a different location of the hard disk.

Norton Antivirus 3.0, released in September 1993, introduced a unique feature. Unlike other antivirus software products for MS-DOS and early Windows, which will only notify you to turn off your computer, but continue anyway, Auto-Protect or the main program will scan for viruses in memory before loading themselves. If they find a virus loaded into memory, they will halt the entire computer so that you can&#x27;t even perform a warm boot (Ctrl+Alt+Delete), So that you can turn off your computer from the power and turn it back on again with a clean, uninfected system disk. Most often, this can either be the rescue disk created, or the original MS-DOS system installation disk, followed by the Norton Antivirus program installation disks. This feature is the safest way to deal with any kind of virus in memory. Norton Antivirus 3.0 is also the first version for Windows 3.1.

Product activation was introduced in Norton AntiVirus 2004, addressing the estimated 3.6 million counterfeit Norton products sold. An alphanumeric code is generated to identify a computer&#x27;s configuration, which ties in with the product key. Users are allowed to activate their product five times with the same product key. Spyware and adware detection and removal was introduced to the 2005 version, with the tagline &quot;Antispyware Edition&quot;. The tagline was dropped in later releases. However, Norton AntiVirus 2009 Classic does not include spyware or adware detection. The Classic edition is marketed alongside Norton AntiVirus 2009, which does include spyware and adware detection.

Existing users of the 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 versions can upgrade to the latest 2010 version without buying a new subscription. Upgrading will preserve the number of days left on a user&#x27;s subscription.

=== Version 2006 (13.0) ===
The redesigned main graphical user interface aggregates information in a central user interface. CNET reports the Norton Protection Center, while useful, attempts to advertise additional products. To further facilitate detection of zero-day malware, Bloodhound disassembles a variety of programming languages, and scans code for malicious instructions using predefined algorithms. Internet Explorer homepage hijacking protection was introduced in this release as well; however notably missing is search engine hijacking protection. CNET highlighted Norton AntiVirus 2006&#x27;s noticeable impact on system performance.

Operating system requirements call for Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 or Windows XP. 150 MB of free space and a 300 MHz processor is required under either operating system. 128 MB of RAM is required under Windows 2000, while 256 MB is required in Windows XP.

===Version 2007 (14.0)===
Norton AntiVirus 2007 was released on September 12, 2006. Symantec revised Norton AntiVirus with the goal of reducing high system resource utilization. Windows Vista compatibility was introduced in this release as well. Despite having about 80% of the code rewritten, CNET reports mixed results in performance testing.

Windows 2000 compatibility was dropped from this release. Compatibility with 32-bit versions of Windows Vista was added to this release with a patch from Symantec. Hardware requirements under Vista call for 150 MB free space, an 800  MHz processor and 512 MB RAM. Requirements under Windows XP similarly call for 150 MB free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM.

===Version 2008 (15.0)===
Norton AntiVirus 2008 was released on August 28, 2007. Emphasizing malware prevention, new features include SONAR, which looks for suspicious application behavior. This release adds real-time exploit protection, preventing attackers from leveraging common browser and application vulnerabilities.

When installed in 32-bit versions of Windows XP Service Pack 2, 300 MB of free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required. When installed in 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, 300 MB of free space, an 800 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is needed.

===Version 2009 (16.0)===

Norton AntiVirus 2009 was released on September 8, 2008. Addressing performance issues, over 300 changes were made, with a &quot;zero-impact&quot; goal. Benchmarking conducted by Passmark Software PTY LTD highlights its 47-second install time, 32 second scan time, and 5 MB memory utilization. Symantec funded the benchmark test and provided some scripts used to benchmark each participating antivirus software.

The security status and settings are now displayed in a single main interface. A CPU usage monitor displays the total CPU utilization and Norton&#x27;s CPU usage in the main interface. Other features include Norton Insight, a whitelisting technology which cuts scanning times by mapping known safe files using information from an online database. To address malware response times, updates are delivered every 5 to 15 minutes. However, such updates are not tested by Symantec, and may cause false positives, or incorrectly identify files as malicious. The exploit scanner found in the 2007 and 2008 versions was dropped from this release.

When installed in 32-bit versions of Windows XP Service Pack 2, 150 MB of free space, a 300 MHz processor, and 256 MB of RAM is required. When installed in 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows Vista, 150 MB of free space, an 800 MHz processor, and 512 MB of RAM is required.

Two variations on Norton AntiVirus 2009 are also marketed by Symantec. The Gaming edition provides finer control over when Norton downloads updates and allows components of the suite to be disabled either manually or automatically when the computer enters full-screen mode. The Classic edition cannot find or remove adware and spyware.

===Version 2010 (17.0)===

Version 17.0 was released on September 9, 2009. Several features have been updated in this release, including SONAR, now dubbed SONAR 2. It now uses more information to determine if an application is truly malicious. Norton Insight can present users with information about the origins, activities, and performance of applications along with reputation data. A new feature codenamed &quot;Autospy&quot; helps users understand what Norton did when malware was found. Previous releases removed threats on sight and quietly warned users, potentially confusing when users are deceived in downloading rogue security software. Much of this information is placed on the back of the main window; a toggle button switches between the sides.
Symantec has also added Windows 7 support. Aside from that, Symantec has also added the Norton Download Insight to prevent drive by drive downloads.

===Version 2011 (18.0)===

===Version 2012 (19.0)===
===Version 2013 (20.0)===
===Version 2014 (21.0)===
===Lack of 2015 version===
Symantec briefly discontinued the standalone Norton AntiVirus product in 2015 instead replacing it with Norton Security.

===Version 2016 (22.0)===

== Criticism ==

=== FBI cooperation ===
The FBI confirmed the active development of Magic Lantern, a keylogger intended to obtain passwords to encrypted e-mail and other documents during criminal investigations. Magic Lantern was first reported in the media by Bob Sullivan of MSNBC on 20 November 2001 and by Ted Bridis of the Associated Press. The FBI intends to deploy Magic Lantern in the form of an e-mail attachment. When the attachment is opened, it installs a trojan horse on the suspect&#x27;s computer, which is activated when the suspect uses PGP encryption, often used to increase the security of sent email messages. When activated, the trojan will log the PGP password, which allows the FBI to decrypt user communications. Symantec and other major antivirus vendors have whitelisted the Magic Lantern trojan, rendering their antivirus products, including Norton AntiVirus, incapable of detecting it. Concerns around this whitelisting include uncertainties about Magic Lantern&#x27;s full surveillance potential and whether hackers could subvert it and redeploy it for purposes outside of law enforcement.

=== Update disables legitimate software ===
On January 28, 2010 Symantec Anti-virus update marked Spotify as a Trojan Horse disabling the software across millions of PCs.

=== Product support ===
Retail customers report slow and indifferent service on bugs. Examples include a faulty error message stating current subscriptions had expired. Users received an error stating &quot;Your virus protection cannot be updated.&quot; This error occurred after an update to the software and refused to allow daily updates. Though the bug was reported in 2004, it was not corrected for the 2005 or 2006 versions.

Another incident occurred in May 2007, when Norton AntiVirus flagged components of the Pegasus email client as malicious, rendering the program corrupted. Symantec customer service addressed the problem by running through a checklist of troubleshooting steps which were not always successful.

=== Faulty update ===
On July 25, 2006, Symantec released a faulty update for Norton AntiVirus 2006 users. Users reported an onscreen message stating &quot;Norton AntiVirus 2006 does not support the repair feature. Please uninstall and reinstall.&quot;. Symantec claimed the faulty update was downloaded to customers between 1:00 PM and 7:00 PM on July 25, 2006. Symantec developed a workaround tool and has listed troubleshooting steps, available here. The company released a statement, stating they expected to deliver a repair patch to affected users by Monday, July 31, 2006.&quot;

=== Uninstallation ===

Norton AntiVirus has been criticized for refusing to uninstall completely, leaving unnecessary files behind. Another issue is versions prior to 2009 installed LiveUpdate, which updates Norton-branded software, separately. The user must uninstall both Norton AntiVirus and the LiveUpdate component manually. The LiveUpdate component is purposely left behind to update other Norton-branded products, if present. In response, Symantec developed the Norton Removal Tool (SymNRT) to remove leftover registry keys and values along with files and folders. However, neither route of uninstallation will remove subscription data, preserved to prevent users from installing multiple trial copies.
SymNRT can only remove these Norton programs:
*Norton AntiSpam 2004 and 2005
*Norton Antivirus 2003 through 2012
*Norton Ghost 2003,9.0,10.0,12.0,1 A.O and 15.0
*Norton GoBack 3.1 through 4.2
*Norton Internet Security 2003 through 2012
*Norton Password Manager
*Norton Personal Firewall 2003 through 2006
*Norton SystemWorks 2003 through 2009
*Norton Confidential Online 2007
*Norton Add-on Pack 1.0 – 4.0
*Norton Save and Restore 1.0 through 2.0
*Norton 360/Security Suite/Business Suite 1.0 – 5.0
*Norton Safety Minder 1.0
*Norton Safe Web 3.2
Once SymNRT has started the removal process, it cannot be stopped. It is recommended to close all running programs prior to running SymNRT. ACT! and WinFax users are recommended to back up their databases before running SymNRT.

=== Incompatibilities with ZoneAlarm ===
Norton AntiVirus 2007 will not install alongside ZoneAlarm. This incompatibility has caused annoyance for Norton customers who purchased Norton AntiVirus 2007 with no prior warning or notice of the incompatibility. Symantec recommends removing ZoneAlarm, then reinstalling it with its Internet Worm Protection feature disabled, which controls what applications can access the Internet and which protocols they can use to do so.

=== PIFTS.exe ===
On March 9, 2009, some users of Norton AntiVirus 2006 and 2007 experienced a firewall warning stating a Norton-associated file, &quot;PIFTS.exe&quot;, was trying to connect to the Internet. Although this file was revealed to be a harmless diagnostic patch, the program gained attention in the media when Symantec removed posts from their forum concerning PIFTS. With no information available about the purpose of the program there was speculation that the program was malware or a backdoor.

The SANS Internet Storm Center claimed to have spoken to a Symantec employee who has confirmed that &quot;the program is theirs, part of the update process and not intended to do harm.&quot; Graham Cluley, a consultant from antivirus vendor Sophos found PIFTS connected to a Symantec server, forwarding product and computer information.

On March 10, Symantec made an official response to the PIFTS program, claiming posts in the support forum were deleted due to forum spam rules; however the deletion of PIFTS-related posts began before the spam attacks. Symantec stated PIFTS itself was a diagnostic patch. Cole stated the purpose of the update was to help determine how many customers would need to be migrated to Windows 7-compatible versions of Norton AntiVirus. PIFTS apparently was released without a digital signature to verify its identity, causing firewalls to prompt for permission when it attempted to connect to the Internet.

=== Consumer complaints ===
Symantec has been criticized by some consumers for perceived ethical violations, including allegations that support technicians would tell customers that their systems were infected and needed a technician to resolve it remotely for an extra fee, then refuse to refund when the customers alleged their systems had not actually been infected.

== Macintosh edition ==
Norton AntiVirus 11 for Mac introduced support for Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard platform, with the capability to detect both Macintosh and Windows malware. Other features include a vulnerability scanner, which blocks attackers from leveraging software exploits. Norton AntiVirus 11 also includes the ability to scan within compressed or archived files, such as Time Capsule volumes. Operating requirements call for Mac OS X Tiger. A PowerPC or an Intel Core processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 100 MB of free hard disk space are also required. Norton AntiVirus Dual Protection for Mac is intended for Macintosh users with Windows running on their systems, using Boot Camp or virtualization software such as VMware Fusion. It provides a license for both Norton AntiVirus 11 with Norton AntiVirus 2009.

== Comparison with other software ==
From the 2009 to 2012 editions, Symantec made huge changes to their products&#x27; speed and performance. Norton products now have only 2 running processes, using about 24 MB of RAM. As soon as a virus is recognized, information in regards to the virus (a virus signature) is stored in a pandemic definitions file, which contains the vital know-how to become aware of and get rid of the virus. According to tests sponsored by Symantec, PassMark Security Benchmark 2012 Norton AntiVirus and Norton Internet Security are the lightest suites available. Av-comparatives.org also tested these products and gave similar results.
PCMag recognises 2011 and 2012 lines as the fastest and strongest in protection.
PCWorld&#x27;s tests of security software put Norton Internet Security 2009 in the 1st place.
In 2011, in a test of PCWorld, Norton Internet Security was the winner. Dennis Technology Labs (in tests sponsored by Symantec) confirms the performance and effectiveness of Norton 2011 and 2012 lines.

== Norton AntiVirus vs. GCSB Amendment Bill ==
On 14 August 2013 the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key addressed what he identified as &quot;misinformation&quot; surrounding the GCSB Amendment Bill, claiming that the actions of the Government Communications Security Bureau were analogous to Norton AntiVirus.

<text>Ovillers-la-Boisselle is a commune in the Somme department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

==Geography==
The commune of Ovillers-la-Boisselle is situated northeast of Amiens and extends to the north and south of the D 929 Albert–Bapaume road.

The constituent village of Ovillers-la-Boisselle (commonly shortened to &quot;Ovillers&quot;) lies on the north of the D 929 road, north-east of Aveluy and south-west of Pozières.

The constituent village of La Boisselle, which had in 1914, lies across the D 929, to the south-west of Ovillers at the junction of the D 104 to Contalmaison.

==Population==
==History==
The village of La Boisselle is a settlement dating back to pre-Roman times, and the D 929 Albert–Bapaume road follows the course of a Roman road. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871), the area suffered serious damage after the Battle of Bapaume.

In World War I, the area was the site of intense and sustained fighting between German and Allied forces. Between 1914 and 1916, the Western Front ran through the commune, and its villages were completely destroyed. In 1916, the commune was the site of particularly heavy fighting during the Battle of the Somme (see Ovillers-la-Boisselle in World War I). After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the former inhabitants returned and gradually rebuilt most of the infrastructure as it had been before the war.

In 2011, British researchers around Peter Barton started the &quot;La Boisselle Project&quot;, a long-term archaeological, historical, technological and genealogical study with special focus on L&#x27;îlot de La Boisselle, a historic site on the south-western tip of La Boisselle which was known during World War I as &quot;L&#x27;îlot&quot; to the French, &quot;Granathof&quot; to the Germans and &quot;Glory Hole&quot; to the British. The site still holds mine craters as well as traces of trenches, shelters and tunnels related to underground warfare, but is private property and not open to the public.

<doc id="1067067" wikidata="Q6907524" url="?curid=1067067" title="Moon Mullican">
<text>Aubrey Wilson Mullican (March 29, 1909 – January 1, 1967), known professionally as Moon Mullican and nicknamed &quot;King of the Hillbilly Piano Players&quot;, was an American country and western singer, songwriter, and pianist. He was associated with the hillbilly boogie style which influenced rockabilly. Jerry Lee Lewis cited him as a major influence on his own singing and piano playing.

Mullican once stated, &quot;We gotta play music that&#x27;ll make them goddamn beer bottles bounce on the table&quot;.

==Early life==
Mullican was born to Oscar Luther Mullican (1876–1961) and his first wife, Virginia Jordan Mullican (1880–1915), near Corrigan, Polk County, Texas, United States. They were a farming family of Scottish, Irish and Eastern European ancestry. His Scots-Irish immigrant ancestor, James Mullikin, was born in Scotland, arriving in Maryland, United States in the 1630s from Northern Ireland. His paternal grandfather was Pvt. Wilson G. Mullican, who served in the 6th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, Confederate States Army, at the Battle of Shiloh. Mullican&#x27;s parents, stepmother, and grandparents are all buried in Stryker Cemetery, Polk County, Texas.

==Beginnings in music==
As a child Mullican began playing the organ, which his religious father had purchased in order to better sing hymns at church. However, Moon made friends with Joe Jones, a black sharecropper on the family farm, who introduced him to the country blues. Moon&#x27;s parents did not always approve, and he was torn between playing religious and secular music. After making his mark as a local piano player, Mullican left home at age 16, going to Houston, where he performed and sang in local clubs.

By the 1930s, Mullican had acquired his nickname &quot;Moon&quot;. Although published sources suggest it is short for &quot;moonshine&quot; or possibly from his all-night performances; his family says it was because he loved to play &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot;, a variation of the dominoes game &quot;42&quot;. It is also highly likely the widely popular syndicated comic strip &quot;Moon Mullins&quot;, which debuted in 1923, played a role in the similar nickname and alliteration sticking to Mullican.

==Early career==
His earliest influences were popular blues artists of the day such as Bessie Smith, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Leroy Carr, together with country musicians including Jimmie Rodgers, and Bob Wills. In 1936, he covered Cab Calloway&#x27;s &quot;Georgia Pine&quot; and also sang his own compositions &quot;Ain&#x27;t You Kinda Sorry&quot; and &quot;Swing Baby Swing&quot; for Leon Selph&#x27;s Western swing band, The Blue Ridge Playboys. He played and recorded with Cliff Bruner&#x27;s Texas Wanderers, the Sunshine Boys, and Jimmie Davis. By the end of the 1930s, he had become a popular vocalist with a warm, deep, vocal delivery. Mullican frequently met up with another pianist, Black Boy Shine, when performing around Houston. Combining nicknames, for a short time in the 1930s, they performed as a duo called &quot;Moonshine&quot;.

In the early 1940s, he returned to the Texas Wanderers as lead singer and pianist, sang on the hits &quot;Truck Driver&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep On Loving You&quot;. However, after leaving the band in 1942, he became a session musician playing on the songs of Floyd Tillman, Ernest Tubb, and Red Foley.

==The Showboys==
In 1945, he put together his own band, The Showboys, who quickly became one of the most popular outfits in the Texas-Louisiana area with a mix of country music, Western swing, Cajun music, and Mullican&#x27;s wild piano playing and singing. Although their style was highly eclectic and included country ballads, some of their music clearly foreshadowed what would later be called rock and roll. In September 1946, Mullican cut 16 recordings as band leader, for King Records in Cincinnati. His first release, &quot;The Lonesome Hearted Blues&quot; b/w &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin to Love You Like I Do&quot; sold quite well, but did not chart. His second release, &quot;New Jole Blon&quot; in December 1946 (later recorded by Doug Kershaw), reached number 2 on the Country and Western chart, sold one million copies and was the beginning of a long string of hits. He became a member of the Grand Ole Opry in 1951.

Mullican was one of the highest-selling artists on King Records. Though not a major chart success, he was popular in the southeastern United States with records such as &quot;The Leaves Mustn&#x27;t Fall&quot;, &quot;Hey Shah&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Baby to Cry&quot;, &quot;Nine Tenths of the Tennessee River&quot;, and &quot;I Was Sorta Wonderin&#x27;&quot;.

In the mid-1950s, many artists, such as Lefty Frizzell and George Jones experimented with rock and roll as its popularity began to gain ground on traditional country-and-western in the mid-1950s. Seeking some of that success, Mullican recorded four rock sides with Boyd Bennett and His Rockets, including &quot;Seven Nights to Rock&quot;. However, both singles failed to chart. Before he signed to Coral in 1958, he had three other hits with King, including &quot;Hey Shah&quot;.

==Later career==
In 1958, Mullican was signed by country music producer Owen Bradley to Decca Records&#x27; subsidiary label Coral Records, and recorded more rock songs including &quot;Moon&#x27;s Rock&quot; and &quot;Sweet Rockin&#x27; Music&quot;. Devastated by the failure of his rock sides, Owen Bradley convinced Mullican to record his original songs in the burgeoning new more lush style of country music, the Nashville sound. However, Bradley was frustrated with Mullican; he reportedly said himself, &quot;There was nothing I could do with him.&quot; Mullican, whose style was largely in traditional honky tonk, found it difficult to make such a large adjustment to his style and was dropped from Coral in 1959.

In the early 1960s, Mullican was a largely forgotten figure nationally, but based himself in Texas and carried on performing, recording then for the Starday and Spar labels. The decade saw him record country songs such as &quot;I&#x27;ll Pour the Wine&quot; and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Have a Guarantee&quot;, together with less notable novelties including &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Beatle, But I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;. One of his last records was &quot;Love That Might Have Been&quot;. 

==Death==
In spite of having a heart condition Mullican continued to perform regularly. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1966 he suffered a heart attack in Beaumont, Texas, and died early in the morning on January 1, 1967, aged 57. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery, Beaumont, Texas, the epitaph on his tombstone reading &quot;I&#x27;ll Sail My Ship Alone&quot;, the name of one of his many hits.

His wife Eunice (d. 1973) survived him; the couple was childless. 

==Influence==
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, Mullican influenced many other country artists. He had defined a style of country balladeering not hinted at in his 1930s work. This style of music influenced Jim Reeves (a band member for a while), Hank Williams (who named Mullican as a favorite artist), Hank Snow, Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and especially Jerry Lee Lewis, who covered many of Mullican&#x27;s songs. It was in the realm of hillbilly boogie, however, that Mullican had his greatest influence. Many of his songs, such as &quot;Pipeliners Blues&quot;, &quot;Hey! Mister Cotton-Picker&quot; and &quot;Cherokee Boogie&quot; (his biggest hit, in 1951) foreshadowed a style adopted with widespread popularity by Haley and later rock and rollers. Mullican also influenced many others, including the Western swing band Asleep at the Wheel, which recorded his song &quot;Cherokee Boogie&quot; on their 1973 album &quot;Comin&#x27; Right At Ya&quot;, with several recording tribute CDs to mark Mullican&#x27;s 100th birthday in 2009

Mullican is also believed to have co-written &quot;Jambalaya,&quot; a song made famous by Hank Williams that could not be credited to Mullican because of his contract with King Records. Mullican&#x27;s recording of the song was released in July 1952, the same month as Williams&#x27; version, but differs significantly in having a different order of verses and extra rhyming couplets.

==Legacy==
In 1976, Mullican was posthumously inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. There have been many posthumous compilations of his music, on various labels including Ace and Bear Family.

<doc id="1067075" wikidata="Q4906267" url="?curid=1067075" title="Big Sandy &amp; His Fly-Rite Boys">
<text>Big Sandy &amp; His Fly-Rite Boys is an American rockabilly and Western swing band from California composed of Robert Williams, alias Big Sandy, Ashley Kingman, Frankie Hernandez and Russell Scott. The band is known for its eclectic style, which encompasses rockabilly, Western swing, folk, bluegrass, Cajun, mariachi, rock and roll, folk rock, swing and country.

Robert Williams grew up listening to jump blues records from his parents&#x27; collection, and subsequently performed with neo-rockabilly bands in southern California in the 1980s before forming the Fly-Rite Boys band as a trio in 1988. After recording two albums as Big Sandy &amp; the Fly-Rite Trio, the band expanded its line-up and released its official debut studio album, &quot;Jumping from 6 to 6&quot;, in 1994. &quot;Swingin&#x27; West&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, was released the following year, and featured more prominent Western swing influences than the band&#x27;s debut. After releasing a more eclectic sounding album, &quot;Feelin&#x27; Kinda Lucky&quot;, in 1997, the band went on hiatus, and released the instrumental album &quot;Big Sandy Presents the Fly-Rite Boys&quot; in 1998, followed by the Big Sandy solo album &quot;Dedicated to You&quot;, a cover album consisting of R&amp;B and doo-wop songs, before the band reunited in 1999 to record the EP &quot;Radio Favorites&quot;.

Former members include Joe Perez, Jeff West, Bobby Trimble, TK Smith, Carl Leyland, Lee Jeffriess, and Wally Hersom. The band has been inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

In 2024, Robert Williams (aka Big Sandy) both covered the song Kiss the Girl and provided the voice of Romeo McGrowl (originally named Liver Lips McGrowl in the original Country Bear show) in the re-vamped Country Bear Musical Jamboree at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Magic Kingdom.

<doc id="1067082" wikidata="Q2383867" url="?curid=1067082" title="Cell death">
<text>Cell death is the event of a biological cell ceasing to carry out its functions. This may be the result of the natural process of old cells dying and being replaced by new ones, as in programmed cell death, or may result from factors such as diseases, localized injury, or the death of the organism of which the cells are part. Apoptosis or Type I cell-death, and autophagy or Type II cell-death are both forms of programmed cell death, while necrosis is a non-physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury.

The term &quot;cell necrobiology&quot; has been used to describe the life processes associated with morphological, biochemical, and molecular changes which predispose, precede, and accompany cell death, as well as the consequences and tissue response to cell death. The word is derived from the Greek νεκρό meaning &quot;death&quot;, βìο meaning &quot;life&quot;, and λόγος meaning &quot;the study of&quot;. The term was initially coined to broadly define investigations of the changes that accompany cell death, detected and measured by multiparameter flow- and laser scanning- cytometry. It has been used to describe the real-time changes during cell death, detected by flow cytometry.

== Types ==
=== Programmed cell death ===
Programmed cell death (PCD) is cell death mediated by an intracellular program. PCD is carried out in a regulated process, which usually confers advantage during an organism&#x27;s life-cycle. For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits separate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and metazoa (multicellular animals) tissue development.

==== Apoptosis ====

Apoptosis is the processor of programmed cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is now thought that – in a developmental context – cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of &quot;apoptosis&quot;, others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of &quot;apoptosis&quot; such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.

Certain key proteins primarily employed in the repair of DNA damage can also induce apoptosis when DNA damage exceeds the cell’s repair capability. These dual role proteins protect against proliferation of unstable damaged cells that might lead to cancer.

==== Autophagy ====
Autophagy is &quot;cytoplasmic&quot;, characterized by the formation of large vacuoles that eat away organelles in a specific sequence prior to the destruction of the nucleus. Macroautophagy, often referred to as autophagy, is a catabolic process that results in the autophagosomic-lysosomal degradation of bulk cytoplasmic contents, abnormal protein aggregates, and excess or damaged organelles. Autophagy is generally activated by conditions of nutrient deprivation but has also been associated with physiological as well as pathological processes such as development, differentiation, neurodegenerative diseases, stress, infection and cancer.

==== Other variations of PCD ====
Other pathways of programmed cell death have been discovered. Called &quot;non-apoptotic programmed cell-death&quot; (or &quot;caspase-independent programmed cell-death&quot;), these alternative routes to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the main type of PCD.

Some such forms of programmed cell death are anoikis, almost identical to apoptosis except in its induction; cornification, a form of cell death exclusive to the eyes; excitotoxicity; ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death and Wallerian degeneration.

Plant cells undergo particular processes of PCD similar to autophagic cell death. However, some common features of PCD are highly conserved in both plants and metazoa.

Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a programmed cell death caused by the interaction of Fas receptor (Fas, CD95)and Fas ligand (FasL, CD95 ligand). It occurs as a result of repeated stimulation of specific T-cell receptors (TCR) and it helps to maintain the periphery immune tolerance. Therefore, an alteration of the process may lead to autoimmune diseases. In the other words AICD is the negative regulator of activated T-lymphocytes.

Ischemic cell death, or oncosis, is a form of accidental, or passive cell death that is often considered a lethal injury. The process is characterized by mitochondrial swelling, cytoplasm vacuolization, and swelling of the nucleus and cytoplasm.

Mitotic catastrophe is an oncosuppressive mechanism that can lead to cell death that is due to premature or inappropriate entry of cells into mitosis. It is the most common mode of cell death in cancer cells exposed to ionizing radiation and many other anti-cancer treatments.

Immunogenic cell death or immunogenic apoptosis is a form of cell death caused by some cytostatic agents such as anthracyclines, oxaliplatin and bortezomib, or radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT).

Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that occurs most frequently upon infection with intracellular pathogens and is likely to form part of the antimicrobial response in myeloid cells.

PANoptosis is a unique inflammatory cell death pathway that integrates components from other cell death pathways. The totality of biological effects in PANoptosis cannot be individually accounted for by pyroptosis, apoptosis, or necroptosis alone. PANoptosis is regulated by multifaceted macromolecular complexes termed PANoptosomes.

Phagoptosis is cell death resulting from a live cell being phagocytosed (i.e. eaten) by another cell (usually a phagocyte), resulting in death and digestion of the engulfed cell. Phagoptosis can occur to cells that are pathogenic, cancerous, aged, damaged or excess to requirements.

=== Necrotic cell death ===
Necrosis is cell death where a cell has been badly damaged through external forces such as trauma or infection and occurs in several different forms. It is the sum of what happens to cells after their deaths. In necrosis, a cell undergoes swelling, followed by uncontrolled rupture of the cell membrane with cell contents being expelled. These cell contents often then go on to cause inflammation in nearby cells. A form of programmed necrosis, called necroptosis, has been recognized as an alternative form of programmed cell death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations. Necroptotic pathways are associated with death receptors such as the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. Identification of cell death was previously classified based on morphology, but in recent years switched to molecular and genetic conditions.

<doc id="1067107" wikidata="Q1154788" url="?curid=1067107" title="DOSEMU">
<text>DOSEMU, stylized as dosemu, is a compatibility layer software package that enables DOS operating systems (e.g., MS-DOS, DR-DOS, FreeDOS) and application software to run atop Linux on x86-based PCs (IBM PC compatible computers).

== Features ==
It uses a combination of hardware-assisted virtualization features and high-level emulation. It can thus achieve nearly native speed for 8086-compatible DOS operating systems and applications on x86 compatible processors, and for DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) applications on x86 compatible processors as well as on x86-64 processors. DOSEMU includes an 8086 processor emulator for use with real-mode applications in x86-64 long mode.

DOSEMU is only available for x86 and x86-64 Linux systems (Linux 3.15 x86-64 systems cannot enter DPMI by default. This is fixed in 3.16).

DOSEMU is an option for people who need or want to continue to use legacy DOS software; in some cases virtualisation is good enough to drive external hardware such as device programmers connected to the parallel port. According to its manual, &quot;dosemu&quot; is a user-level program which uses certain special features of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor to run DOS in a DOS box. The DOS box, relying on a combination of hardware and software, has these abilities:
* Virtualize all input-output and processor control instructions
* Supports the word size and addressing modes of the iAPX86 processor family&#x27;s &quot;real mode&quot;, while still running within the full protected mode environment
* Trap all DOS and BIOS system calls and emulate such calls as needed for proper operation and good performance
* Simulate a hardware environment over which DOS programs are accustomed to having control.
* Provide DOS services through native Linux services; for example, dosemu can provide a virtual hard disk drive which is actually a Linux directory hierarchy.
* API-level support for Packet driver, IPX, Berkeley sockets (dosnet).

<doc id="1067111" wikidata="Q39510" url="?curid=1067111" title="Ashtarak">
<text>Ashtarak ( ) is a town in the Ashtarak Municipality of the Aragatsotn Province of Armenia, located on the left bank of Kasagh River along the gorge, 20 kms northwest of the capital Yerevan. It is the administrative centre of the province and an important crossroad of routes for the Yerevan–Gyumri–Vanadzor triangle.

The town plays a great role in the national economy as well as the cultural life of Armenia through several industrial enterprises and cultural institutions. It has developed as a satellite town of Yerevan. The nearby village of Mughni is part of the Ashtarak municipality.

As of the 2011 census, the population of the town was 18,834. However, as per the 2016 official estimate, the population of Ashtarak is 18,000. As of the 2022 census, the population of the town was 15,686.

The prelacy of the Diocese of Aragatsotn of the Armenian Apostolic Church is headquartered in Ashtarak.

==Etymology==
The name of Ashtarak is the Armenian word for &quot;tower&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;. However, according to linguist Grigor Ghapantsyan, the name of Ashtarak is derived from Ishtar (Ashtar), the Assyrian and Babylonian goddess of fertility. Contrarily, the latest historical research proved that the name of &quot;Ishtar&quot; was never used in the Armenian mythology during the ancient times. Instead, the goddess of fertility was known as &quot;Shardi&quot; or &quot;Sardi&quot; in the ancient kingdom of Urartu, and later became known as Astghik among the Armenian monks.

Other linguists suggest that the name of Ashtarak is related either with the legendary figure in the Armenian history &quot;Shidar&quot;; the son of king Artavasdes I of Armenia, or with Sarduri II; the king of Urartu.

==History==
===Early history and Middle Ages===

The Bronze Age necropolises of Nerkin and Verin Naver are located just outside of modern Ashtarak. Archaeologist Hakob Y. Simonyan believes that they were constructed by an Indo-European culture, potentially early Armenians.

According to Movses Khorenatsi, Armanak, the son of the patriarch and founder of the Armenian nation Hayk, along with his clan, settled in the area of modern-day Aragatsotn.

Historically, the area of modern-day Ashtarak was part of the Aragatsotn canton of Ayrarat province of the ancient Kingdom of Armenia. The town is one of the oldest settlements in Armenia with many historical and cultural monuments that demonstrate the unique aspects of Armenian architecture.

In the history of the Armenian highland, Ashtarak was mentioned as a rural settlement for the first time during the 9th century. However, the importance of Ashtarak has declined during the following centuries under the rule of the foreign powers. Between the 11th and 15th centuries, the entire region of Aragatsotn along with the rest of the historic territories of Armenia suffered from the Seljuk, Mongol, Ag Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu invasions, respectively.

===Modern history===
At the beginning of the 16th century, Ahtarak became part of the &quot;Erivan Beglarbegi&quot; within the Safavid Persia. During the 17th century, the town was entirely rebuilt. During the first half of the 18th century, Ashtarak became part of the Erivan Khanate under the rule of the Afsharid dynasty and later under the Qajar dynasty of Persia. Ashtarak was the site of the Battle of Oshakan in August 1827, which resulted in a Persian victory, during the Russo-Persian War of 1826-1828. It remained under the Persian rule until 1827-1828, when Eastern Armenia was ceded to the Russian Empire as a result of the same Russo-Persian War of 1826–28 and the signing of the Treaty of Turkmenchay.

After the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, Ashtarak was included within the First Republic of Armenia declared on 28 May 1918. However, after 2 years of brief independence, Armenia became part of the Soviet Union in December 1920. From 1930 until 1995, Ashtarak was the centre of the &quot;Ashtarak raion&quot;. During that period, Ashtarak was granted the status of a town in 1963.

After the independence of Armenia in 1991, Ashtarak became the capital of the newly-formed Aragatsotn Province as a result of the territorial administration reform of 1995.

==Geography==
Ashtarak is located on the left bank of Kasagh River, 13 km to the northwest of the capital Yerevan, at an approximate height of 1110 meters above sea level.

The town occupies the central point between the Ararat plain from the south and the mountains of Aragats from the north. The area is rich with water resources. The fountains of &quot;Saghmosavan&quot;, &quot;Nazrevan&quot; and &quot;Shroshor&quot; are the main sources of drinking water for the town.

The town is divided into 4 districts: &quot;Old Ashtarak&quot; on the right bank of Kasagh river, &quot;Dzakhap&quot; (literally meaning &quot;left bank&quot;) on the left side of Kasagh, &quot;Gitavan&quot; and &quot;Bagavan&quot;. The village of Mughni -included within the municipality of Ashtarak- is located to the north of the town. The valley of Ashtarak commonly known as &quot;Ashtaraki dzor&quot; is a major destination for visitors from Yerevan and other nearby settlements.

===Climate===
Ashtarak has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dsa&quot;). The city has a hot and dry weather in summers, especially in August and September, the driest months. Spring is the wettest time of the year. Hail is a rare event which can happen in warmer months.

The 17th-century bridge of Ashtarak on Kasagh River is among the interesting sites of the town. It is located in the gorge just below the church of Saint Sarkis. It was built in 1664 by the efforts of &quot;Mahdesi Khoja Grigor&quot;; a wealthy merchant from Kanaker. The bridge features 3 arches that are unequal in size.

===Historical monuments===
====Churches of Spitakavor, Karmravor and Tsiranavor====

According to a legend, 3 sisters lived in Ashtarak, all of whom fell in love with the same man, prince &quot;Sarkis&quot;. The elder 2 sisters decided to commit suicide in favour of the youngest one. One wearing an apricot-orange dress and the other wearing a red dress, they threw themselves into the Ashtarak gorge. When the youngest sister found out, she put on a white dress and also threw herself into the gorge. &quot;Sarkis&quot; then became a hermit and three small churches appeared at the edge of the gorge, named after the sisters&#x27; dress colours.
The best preserved one among the three churches is the Karmravor Church (meaning &quot;reddish&quot; for its dome colour), dating back to the 7th century, dedicated to the Holy Mother of God (Surp Astvatsatsin). It has a small cruciform central-plan, with a reddish/apricot colored dome, and an octagonal drum. Other churches include, Tsiranavor (meaning &quot;apricot-colored&quot;) dating back to the 5th century, and Spitakavor (meaning &quot;whitish&quot;) dating back to the 13th century, both are located along the edge of the gorge.

====Saint Marianeh Church====
The largest church of the town is the Saint Marianeh Church located at the center of Ashtarak. It was built in 1271 and has a rectangular plan from outside and a cruciform type plan from inside with an octagonal drum above. A belfry was added in 1838.

====Saint Sarkis Church====
The 19th-century church of Surp Sarkis built on an old foundation, is situated on an attractive point at a promontory overlooking the gorge and offers a fine view to the above-mentioned three churches. The external walls of the structure were almost completely restored recently while the interior walls remain the same. Some pieces of the outer walls remain sitting next to the church with carvings on them.

<doc id="1067117" wikidata="Q1781846" url="?curid=1067117" title="This Ugly yet Beautiful World">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series created by Shouji Saeki and Hiroyuki Yamaga. It was animated by Gainax and Shaft.

The series aired on BS-i from April 2, 2004 to June 18, 2004, totaling 12 episodes. A manga adaptation, illustrated by Ashita Morimi, was serialized in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Young Animal&quot;.

==Plot==
Takeru and Ryou are high school students who work doing deliveries for the former&#x27;s uncle. One night, the two go to investigate a mysterious light in the woods only to find a young girl emerging from the light. Takeru and Ryou are attacked by an alien, which is defeated when Takeru transforms into a powerful and strange-looking beast himself. The girl, whom the boys name &quot;Hikari&quot; (light), is taken in by Takeru when she confesses to having no memory of who she is.

They are later joined by Jennifer Portman, an American scientist with an interest in the boys and Hikari; Ioneos, a shape-shifting robot loyal to Hikari; Kuon, a little floating alien; and Akari, Hikari&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot;, who also appeared just as Hikari did. The series follows the daily lives of its characters as they learn about the human condition, Hikari and Akari&#x27;s alien origins, and face the incoming monsters and catastrophes.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
:
:Takeru Takemoto is the series&#x27; main character. He comes off as a lazy and unmotivated teenager, but is really just unsure of his place in the world. He found and named Hikari in the woods in the first episode. After finding Hikari, Takeru gains inexplicable new powers which allow him to transform into a powerful, yet primal being with incredible lethality, but has also been shown to be able to transform into something between his human and monster forms. This power is later explained to be a result of Extended Definition. Takeru eventually develops a love interest in Hikari, ultimately convincing Hikari to spare the world for their love. It is shown that he has some feelings for Mari, but only as a relative. He is obsessed with motorcycles and wanted to take Hikari on a journey throughout the country on one.
:
:A mysterious girl who &#x27;fell from the sky&#x27;, Hikari fell in love with Takeru at first sight after being found in the first episode. She is very cheerful and thinks that almost everything is beautiful. While she can not remember anything before the day Takeru found her, it is later discovered her purpose is to destroy Earth. She is the goddess of darkness, death, and destruction. Hikari has split personalities, and her appearance changes depending on which one is dominant; her &quot;good&quot; personality is characterized by orange hair and green eyes, and her &quot;evil&quot; personality is characterized by pink hair and red eyes. By the series&#x27; end, she decides to destroy the earth, but Takeru stops her with his love for her. In the end of the anime, Hikari lives with Akari in the stars, though promises to return. Her name means &quot;Light.&quot;
:
:Ryou Ninomiya is Takeru&#x27;s best friend and is favored by many of the girls at school because of his gentle nature. He is consistently called &quot;Ryou-sama&quot; by Sakurako and Amika. He is the one who found Akari and throughout the series develops feelings for her. He too develops special powers, his being the ability to grant his wishes, shown by blue spirals on his hands.
:
:Akari is a girl that appears just as mysteriously as Hikari. Ryou finds her in the forest and makes her part of his family. She considers Hikari her older sister, and she grows very attached to Ryou and Kimi. Akari later reveals that she and Hikari are actually one being and that they were split into two during their landing. The part of Hikari&#x27;s personality that does not want the earth destroyed is manifested in Akari. In the end of the anime, she and Hikari wander the stars with only each other. Her name means &quot;Bright.&quot;

===Supporting characters===
:
:Mari Nishino is Takeru&#x27;s cousin, While she nags Takeru for various reasons, Mari harbors jealousy of Takeru and Hikari&#x27;s relationship. Although she denies her feelings for him early in the series, Mari falls in love with Takeru. Throughout the series she is aggravated by the closeness of Hikari and Takeru, and distrusts Hikari, although is kind to her through the beginning of the series. Her jealousy of their relationship grows as her love for Takeru grows largely unrequited. Near the climax of the series, Mari admits her love to Takeru, attempting to make him not follow Hikari, but Takeru only smiles, thanks her, and goes to persuade Hikari to spare the world.
:
:Jennifer Portman is an American super-scientist who came to Japan to study the &quot;Extended Definition&quot;, a species&#x27; ability to prevent its own extinction, which usually manifests itself in said species transforming into a monstrous form that maximizes its combat potential, and gives it the instinct to attack or kill Hikari. She moves in with Takeru, Hikari, and Mari. She&#x27;s rarely to be seen without some kind of alcohol and is somewhat of an exhibitionist. Although out of work she appears ditzy and idiotic, she is extremely intelligent at her work. Her personality is seen as a blend between that of Misato Katsuragi and Ritsuko Akagi from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; (another Gainax series).
; and 
:Shinichi 
:Daijiro 
:Shinichi Asakura and Daijirou Matsumura are schoolmates of Takeru who seem to always be dreaming up some kind of perverted fantasy, especially once they met Hikari.
; and 
:Sakurako 
:Amika 
:Sakurako and Amika enjoy egging on the love triangle between Takeru, Mari and Hikari.
; and 
:Itcho 
:Sumie 
:Itchō and Sumie Nishino are Mari&#x27;s parents. They took in Takeru when his mother abandoned him at a young age. Currently, they run two business ventures: a delivery business and a boarding service.
:
:Kimi is Ryou&#x27;s loud-mouthed younger sister who takes care of the housework when her brother is out. She was the only person living with Ryou until Akari came. She seems to be very protective of Ryou and, while she allowed Akari into their home, attempted to put a barrier between them and frequently got mad whenever they came into close contact.
:
:Kuon is the little creature that takes care of Akari. He looks like a specter with two luminous eyes but no defined body shape, except by his clothing. He is capable of levitation and apparently has some sharp tentacles, as he is seen carrying a watermelon with them which he later uses to remove the rind from the watermelon. Towards the end of the series, Kuon and Ioneos enter hibernation mode and become a crystal. Kuon becomes a chip of the crystal which is probably why Kuon was small and Ioneos was big.
:
:Ioneos is like Kuon&#x27;s &quot;older brother,&quot; as he and Kuon are created from the same type of magical crystal. However, Ioneos&#x27;s appearance and size are much larger and sleeker than Kuon&#x27;s because he is an entire crystal, save a small chipped fragment which Kuon is made from. He was sealed inside of one of the school&#x27;s stone pillars until Hikari accidentally released him during a routine fire drill. The entire school was subsequently demolished after the blast following Ioneos&#x27;s release. Jennifer nicknamed him &quot;Oniita,&quot; (or &quot;Neo&quot; in the English dub) saying that his original name was too long. In the end, Ioneos enters hibernation mode along with Kuon and become crystals, Kuon being the little chip and Ioneos being the big crystal. Jennifer puts them on a necklace and wears the crystals.
:
:Mayu is the class representative. She is short and full of self-doubt. In one episode, Mayu admits to Hikari that she sometimes hates school because everyone teases her, which makes Hikari turn into her &quot;evil&quot; self and destroy the school (brought on by Mayu&#x27;s hate for school) although Mayu does not seem to remember it.

<doc id="1067120" wikidata="Q7015278" url="?curid=1067120" title="New Zealand Conservative Party">
<text>The New Zealand Conservative Party (originally known as Right of Centre) was a short-lived political party in New Zealand. It was founded by a dissident National Party MP, Ross Meurant.

==Foundation==
Meurant had led the New Zealand Police&#x27;s high-profile &quot;Red Squad&quot; during the controversial 1981 Springbok Tour. He became a National Party MP in 1987 and won re-election as such in 1990 and in 1993. Meurant often clashed with the leadership of the National Party over Māori policy, and was regarded as one of the leading dissidents within the National caucus at the time. Eventually, in September 1994, Meurant decided to break away from National and to establish his own party, adopting the name &quot;Right of Centre&quot; (or &quot;ROC&quot;). The acronym represented Meurant&#x27;s right-wing economic philosophy of privatisation of government assets.

The new party was originally conceived by former National MPs Rob Munro (formerly a lieutenant-colonel in the New Zealand Army), lawyer Graham Reeves, and Meurant. Munro and Reeves had lost their National seats in 1993. Meurant remained in Parliament but was an implacable critic of Prime Minister Jim Bolger. To some extent the new party represented an opportunity for the former MPs to re-enter parliament. However, as the 1996 general election loomed, Munro retreated to obscurity and Reeves returned to the National Party fold to contest the unwinnable Tukituki electorate seat for National.

==Relationship with National Party==
Meurant held the view that the new MMP formula for delivering parliamentary seats precluded any single party from achieving an outright majority (except in the most exceptional circumstances). Misguidedly, he anticipated that Prime Minister Bolger and his trusted aide, Finance Minister Bill Birch, would recognise the mathematical inevitability of the MMP formula and embrace Meurant and the former National party conspirators, in a post-election coalition.

But Meurant had mis-read the animosity Bolger had for him that, in the final analysis, condemned Meurant&#x27;s party to oblivion. Though history did vindicate Meurant&#x27;s belief that the MMP formula would not deliver an outright winning party at the polls. In fact, in 1996, the Bolger government finally accepted the inevitability of Meurant&#x27;s claim and reached a pact with ACT, the second political party to be formed under MMP. ACT had been formed by former Labour Finance Minister Roger Douglas (now Sir Roger Douglas). National withdrew its candidate from the Wellington Central electorate to ensure ACT&#x27;s candidate, Richard Prebble, would succeed in the election. This provided ACT with an electorate MP to offset its failure (as happened with all minor parties in the first general election under MMP (including the Christian Coalition) to reach the 5% threshold of votes to qualify as a political party with &quot;List MPs&quot; in parliament. This manoeuvre enabled Bolger to cobble together a coalition with ACT personalities whom he preferred to Meurant.

Prior to the 1996 general election, however, and prior to Meurant resigning from National, Meurant came to an arrangement with Bolger whereby Right-of-Centre would not oppose the National Party government in votes of confidence and supply; in exchange, Meurant would keep his governmental post as Parliamentary Undersecretary for Agriculture.

Until the emergence of other dissident National and Labour MPs (who formed the political party United with a base of seven MPs), Meurant actually held the balance of power and this allowed the National government to maintain its majority in the House.

Meurant built a political party largely on the provincial farming network of Federated Farmers (former president Lumsden was a candidate) and Meat Board representatives (Tim Britton and John McCarthy were both candidates).

On 8 June 1995, Meurant was joined by Trevor Rogers, another dissident National MP. Rogers was well known for his campaigns against pornography. He was a particular opponent of the internet, which he saw as facilitating the distribution of pornography and, in 1994, he had proposed a bill to completely outlaw the viewing of pornography on the internet. After a long period of argument with his fellow National MPs, Rogers decided that his future did not lie with the National Party and he transferred his allegiance to Right of Centre. This gave the party two MPs.

In September 1995, Right of Centre clashed with the National Party when Ross Meurant was sacked as Parliamentary Undersecretary for Agriculture. This came as a result of Meurant&#x27;s accepting a directorship of Prok Bank, a Russian-owned bank registered in Vanuatu. Prime Minister Bolger believed that this directorship was inappropriate for someone holding an executive post in government, and requested that Meurant resign the directorship. Meurant refused, and was sacked as Parliamentary Undersecretary. Despite the tension this generated, Right of Centre continued to support the National government.

==General Election, 1996==
Meanwhile, Right of Centre was not achieving the success in the polls that Meurant and Rogers had hoped. Meurant had strategised his party to capture a portion of the provincial conservative vote in New Zealand, but after more than a year, the party was still barely registering. It was decided in October 1995 to rebrand the party as the New Zealand Conservative Party. The group retained its socially conservative policies but also attempted to win support from the rural sector. This new campaign was based on the claim that National, once strongly associated with the agricultural sector, had abandoned farmers for &quot;big business&quot; and the cities. This new attempt to build a voter base did not meet with any noticeable success.

As the election loomed, internal disputes in Right of Centre occurred. In February 1996, Meurant rejected pressure from the executive of the party to abandon right-wing economic policies in favour of the more traditional and socialist provincial New Zealand policies. Meurant refused, claiming he alone had garnered substantial monetary donations from wealthy individuals, and on the promise of right wing economic policy forming the basis of the new party.

When the executive of the Party overruled Meurant and refused to return political donations garnered by Meurant on the promise of right wing economic policies, Meurant left the party and became an independent, following the path of most former independent MPs: to political oblivion. During the election campaign, despite having an incumbent MP in Rogers, the party was left out of the television debates and as a result got little daily newspaper coverage which contributed to their poor polling result.

After the general election of 1996, the party had an even lower profile before the remnants of the party amalgamated with the United Party in April 1998.

<text>Zoot Suit Riot: The Swingin&#x27; Hits of the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies is a compilation album by the American band the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, released on March 18, 1997, by Space Age Bachelor Pad Records. The album is a collection of swing and jazz-influenced songs from the band&#x27;s first three studio albums, along with four bonus tracks recorded especially for this compilation.

After an independent release in early 1997, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; was reissued by Universal Records subsidiary Mojo Records the following summer. By early 1998, regular radio airplay of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; helped propel the album to #1 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Heatseekers chart and eventually the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, contributing to the swing revival of the late 1990s. By January 2000, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; had achieved double-platinum status of over two million copies sold in the United States, while also attaining gold record sales in Canada and New Zealand.

==Background==
By 1996, having spent seven years performing within the Northwest punk and ska underground, the Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies had independently released three studio albums while steadily gaining recognition in the American ska scene at a time when the genre was beginning to generate mainstream commercial interest on the heels of bands such as No Doubt and Sublime. At this time, largely following the success of the 1996 film &quot;Swingers&quot;, which prominently showcased the Los Angeles swing revival movement, public attention also started turning towards swing music, which had been slowly emerging within the west coast alternative underground pioneered by bands such as Royal Crown Revue and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.

Though the Daddies has been a better-known presence in the ska scene, the band eventually began drawing a sizable audience for their swing songs as they continued to tour alongside ska bands. Facing an unexpected demand for their swing music - which until then had only been a partial component of their repertoire behind punk, funk and ska - the Daddies realized they lacked an album which fully represented their swing and jazz influences, and more so lacked the finances to record a new one. Singer-songwriter Steve Perry explained how the concept of a compilation came to be in an interview for &quot;The Daily of the University of Washington&quot;:

==Release==
Recording for the album&#x27;s bonus tracks took place in late 1996, and according to accounts by Perry, was hurried and carried out on a tight budget as the band &quot;didn&#x27;t have much bread to record&quot;. In several instances, only single takes were used: at the end of the album&#x27;s titular song, Perry is heard saying &quot;I think I&#x27;m about ready to sing it now&quot;, which he was signifying to the engineer after doing his first run-through of the song. The engineer instead told him it was a decent take and suggested keeping his comment in the final mix as an inside joke, to which Perry ultimately agreed (&quot;Unbeknownst to us, it became a big hit record&quot;).

&quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; was released through the Daddies&#x27; self-operated record label Space Age Bachelor Pad Records on March 18, 1997. In its initial pressing, the album became an unexpectedly popular item, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through both the band&#x27;s tours and their Northwest distributors. Despite steady regional sales, obtaining wider distribution and marketing outside of the Northwest proved difficult through the band&#x27;s entirely DIY label. Following a national tour together, ska band Reel Big Fish helped arrange a meeting between the Daddies and their label Mojo Records in an attempt to score the band a distribution deal, negotiations of which instead led to the Daddies being signed to a record contract. &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; was re-issued and given national distribution by Mojo on July 1, 1997, less than four months after its original release.

By October 1997, the rising mainstream popularity of swing music had resulted in consistently steady sales of &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, motivating Mojo to release the album&#x27;s title track as a single and distribute it among modern rock radio stations. The Daddies, who were in preparation over recording a new studio album, ardently protested Mojo&#x27;s decision under the belief that a swing song would never receive airplay on mainstream radio and the band would likely have to recoup the costs of its marketing. Nevertheless, Mojo persisted, and to the band&#x27;s surprise, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; soon found regular rotation on both college radio and major stations such as Los Angeles&#x27; influential KROQ-FM.

===Mainstream breakthrough===

Following several months of steady radio airplay coupled with the Daddies&#x27; extensive touring schedule, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; eventually climbed to the #1 spot on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Top Heatseekers chart, going on to become the first album of the swing revival to crack the top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and peaking at #17, spending an ultimate total of 53 weeks on the charts. In June 1998, the album achieved gold status after surpassing sales of 500,000 copies, reaching platinum status of over one million records sold two months later on August 25. On January 28, 2000, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; was awarded double platinum status after selling over two million copies.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, became a moderate radio hit, reaching #41 on the Hot 100 and appearing on numerous compilation albums, notably the very first US installment of &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!&quot;, while the surrealistic music video, directed by Gregory Dark and edited by Bob Murawski, earned a nomination for a &quot;Best New Artist in a Video&quot; award at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. Two additional singles were issued from &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, &quot;Brown Derby Jump&quot;, for which a music video was filmed, and a remixed version of &quot;Here Comes the Snake&quot; from the Daddies&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Kids on the Street&quot;, though both singles failed to chart. According to Perry in a 2016 Tweet, &quot;Drunk Daddy&quot; was intended to be the second single released from &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;, but at the time Seagram had controlling interest in MCA and Universal Music Group, and the band&#x27;s proposal of issuing a single about a violent alcoholic father was dismissed.

Once &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; began rising up the charts in early 1998, Mojo insisted that the Daddies immediately began touring behind it, forcing the band to abandon their follow-up studio album which they had already started recording. With a successful headlining tour of the United States supported by The Pietasters and Ozomatli, a North American tour opening for Los Fabulosos Cadillacs and international touring as part of the 1998 Vans Warped Tour, the Daddies ultimately toured behind &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; for over a year, playing nearly 300 shows in 1998 alone. During this time, the band also made high-profile appearances on major television shows including &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot;, each time performing their hit single &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot;.

By the end of the decade, both &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; and the Daddies&#x27; mainstream popularity declined with that of the swing revival. The album last appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on the week of February 27, 1999, charting at #193 before slipping off entirely.

==Reception==

Despite the album&#x27;s commercial success, &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; met with largely mixed reactions from mainstream critics. Of the positive reviews, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, comparing albums by the most popular groups of the swing revival, chose the Daddies as having &quot;the most effective music for the dance fad of the moment&quot;, citing the band&#x27;s &quot;suggestive lyrics and occasionally interesting musical textures&quot; as their most distinguishing quality. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the Daddies as &quot;one of the few neo-swing bands that can win over a skeptic with their rhythm section&quot;, noting Perry&#x27;s lyricism as having &quot;an inventiveness missing from most of the other swing bands&#x27; lyrics&quot;.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of &quot;AllMusic&quot;, however, gave the album a rating of 2.5 out of 5 stars, noting that while the Daddies pulled off &quot;reasonably infectious&quot; tunes, the modernist lyrics had lent &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; a &quot;condescending Gen-X attitude, as well as a lack of understanding about what made swing fun&quot;, writing the album off as a &quot;smirking hipster joke, only without any humor and very little music&quot;. The jazz critic Scott Yanow, in his 2000 book &quot;Swing!&quot;, labeled the Daddies as the perfect &quot;whipping boy for the Retro Swing movement&quot;, noting, &quot;The Daddies sound as if they are a punk rock band who has chosen to masquerade as swing...the rhythm section has difficulty swinging, the vocals are often profane...the music, although excitable in spots, usually comes dangerously close to camp.&quot;

Perry&#x27;s reflection on the album has been decidedly ambivalent, which he has described in interviews as being a &quot;blessing as well as a curse&quot;, noting that while &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; had exposed the Daddies&#x27; music to a wider audience and provided them with the financial stability to continue as a band, the success of the album continues to paint a one-dimensional image of the Daddies as an &quot;orthodox swing band&quot; over the prominently eclectic ska, punk and rock influences which largely feature in their music.

==20th anniversary edition==
In mid-2014, Perry revealed that he had re-obtained the rights to &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; from Jive Records and planned to release a remixed version of the album. In interviews, Perry lamented the fact that the production of the album had been rushed and that only first takes had been used, noting that the band could have done &quot;2 or 3 more&quot; takes of the songs &quot;if we had known the future back in 1996&quot;. He stated elsewhere, &quot;I guess my thought is, after 25 years [of the band], I would like to make the record sound a little better.&quot;

&quot;Zoot Suit Riot: The 20th Anniversary Edition&quot; was released exclusively by the band on CD and vinyl on January 13, 2017, with five bonus live tracks recorded during the &quot;Zoot Suit Riot&quot; tour in 1998.

<text>Weeds is an American dark comedy-drama television series created by Jenji Kohan, which aired on Showtime from August 8, 2005, to September 16, 2012. The series tells of Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a widowed mother of two boys (Hunter Parrish and Alexander Gould) who begins selling marijuana to support her family. Other main characters include Nancy&#x27;s lax brother-in-law (Justin Kirk); foolish accountant Doug Wilson (Kevin Nealon); narcissistic neighbor Celia Hodes (Elizabeth Perkins) living with her husband (Andy Milder) and their daughter (Allie Grant); as well as Nancy&#x27;s wholesalers Heylia James (Tonye Patano) and Conrad Shepard (Romany Malco). Over the course of the series, the Botwin family becomes increasingly entangled in illegal activity.

Kohan serves as showrunner and is executive producer, under her Tilted Productions label. The first three seasons are set primarily in the fictional town of Agrestic, located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California. During seasons four and five, the Botwins reside in the also fictional San Diego suburb of Ren Mar. In season six, the family relocates to Seattle, Washington and Dearborn, Michigan. In season seven, the family resides in New York City, living in Manhattan for the duration of the season, but relocates to Connecticut in the season seven finale and throughout season eight.

When the show debuted on the Showtime cable network, it earned the channel&#x27;s highest ratings. In 2012, TV Guide Network bought the airing rights and provided an edited version of the show free of charge. The show has received numerous awards, including two Emmy Awards, two Satellite Awards, one Golden Globe Award, a Writers Guild Award, and a Young Artist Award.

== Production ==

Produced by Tilted Productions, in association with Lionsgate Television, the show is inspired by crime series, such as &quot;The Shield&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, in the sense of an antihero serving as the protagonist while retaining an individual moral code, which usually goes against the norms of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;wgaF/YouTube/Script/Jenji&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; The title, according to Kohan, refers &quot;to a lot of things&quot;, including marijuana and ; however, it mainly alludes to &quot;hardy plants struggling to survive&quot;. The basic premise, as illustrated by the lyrics of the opening song from seasons one to three, and eight, satirizes off-color characters struggling with faux suburban reality, in which everything is &quot;all style, no substance&quot;. According to Kohan, she first pitched the series to HBO, which dismissed it. Robert Greenblatt invested in the show before it was commissioned by Showtime.

Showrunner and head writer Jenji Kohan, whose credits include &quot;Tracey Takes On...&quot;, &quot;Mad About You,&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, is the executive producer of the series, alongside Roberto Benabib, of &quot;Little City&quot; fame. Kohan also explains how she and Benabib &quot;tag team[ed]&quot; in running the writers room. Senior writer Matthew Salsberg and director Craig Zisk also joined as executive producers in later seasons. Following Zisk&#x27;s departure from the series after five seasons, Mark Burley, director Scott Ellis, and Lisa Vinnecour were added on as executive producers. During seasons seven and eight, senior writers Victoria Morrow and Stephen Falk became co-executive producers.

Exterior scenes for the first two seasons were shot almost exclusively in Stevenson Ranch, a suburban area of Santa Clarita Valley, California. The large fountain and Agrestic sign in the opening credits of the first three seasons was shot at the corner of Stevenson Ranch Parkway and Holmes Place. The name &quot;Stevenson Ranch&quot; was digitally replaced with &quot;Agrestic&quot; (and with &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;Regrestic&quot; in later episodes). The overhead satellite view in the beginning of the credits in the first three seasons is of Calabasas Hills, a gated community in Calabasas, California. The shot of the It&#x27;s A Grind coffee shop in the introduction (seasons one to three) is of an It&#x27;s A Grind in Castaic, California. The show was originally filmed at Red Studios, previously known as Ren-Mar studios. The show moved to Universal Studios in Los Angeles for season seven, where it is noted on the studio tour. A version of this Wikipedia page served as the introduction for the season five episode titled &quot;Where the Sidewalk Ends&quot;.

== Synopsis ==

=== Series opening ===
Nancy Botwin is a single mother who lives in Agrestic—a fictional suburb of Los Angeles—with her two children, 15-year-old Silas and 10-year-old Shane, when the series begins. The pilot opens a few months after the untimely death of Nancy&#x27;s husband Judah, who had a heart attack while jogging with their younger son. Nancy begins selling marijuana to maintain the upper middle-class lifestyle originally provided by her late husband&#x27;s salary. References to conspicuous consumption are evident from the show&#x27;s beginning episodes. The opening credits are set to Malvina Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Little Boxes&quot; song, which speaks of suburbanites from the same mold, all living the consumerist American dream. Visual and auditory references to designer labels, luxury homes, SUVs, plastic surgery, and expensive sugary drinks point to the consumption habits of the Agrestic characters. Nancy&#x27;s desire to maintain her comfortable suburban lifestyle is the impetus for her decision to enter the illegal drug business and is another example of extreme consumerism in suburbia. The series follows Nancy&#x27;s life as she gets drawn into the criminal system, develops a client base, starts a front to hide her selling, creates her own strain of weed called MILF, and relocates her family to stay out of jail and protect her children. Featured in the ensemble cast are her lazy, wisecracking brother-in-law Andy Botwin; foolish acquaintance Doug Wilson; and narcissistic neighbor and PTA mother Celia Hodes.

== Cast and characters ==


The principal character is Nancy Price Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), a housewife from Southern California who becomes a marijuana dealer after her husband Judah (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) dies. Although her drug-dealing career achieves mixed success, she eventually rises to the highest levels of an international drug-smuggling cartel. Nancy remarries three times during the series. First, she has an under-the-radar wedding with Peter Scottson (Martin Donovan), a DEA agent, who is later killed. In season five, she marries Esteban Reyes (Demián Bichir), the fictional mayor of Tijuana and leader of a cartel, who is murdered by the seventh season. While in prison, Nancy also establishes a long-term relationship with Zoya (Olga Sosnovska), a woman convicted of murdering her own boyfriend. In the series finale, which leaps forward seven years, viewers come to know that Nancy marries Rabbi David Bloom (David Julian Hirsh), who later dies in a car accident.

Throughout most of the show, Nancy shares her house with her brother-in-law Andy Botwin (Justin Kirk). When Andy arrives in Agrestic, he is little more than a fun-loving slacker (albeit a handsome and charming one), and Nancy views him as a burden. Nonetheless, he emerges as the primary father figure in the household; her children adore him and there is the suggestion that Nancy and her sons view Andy as their last link to Judah. Andy falls in love with Nancy during the fourth season but eventually realizes his feelings are unreciprocated. Nancy tries to balance their relationship to keep him &quot;in the family.&quot; When he is not helping Nancy run her household, Andy engages in various educational and business ventures, from studying to be a rabbi in Hebrew school, to marijuana dealer, to entrepreneurial bicycle salesman. He also has a passion for cooking, becoming a professional chef by the sixth season.

Nancy begins the series with two sons, who after Judah&#x27;s death are raised haphazardly. In the fifth season, she has a son, Stevie Ray Botwin (portrayed by uncredited babies and later by Ethan and Gavin Kent), with Esteban Reyes. Her first son, Silas (Hunter Parrish), who has been sexually active since the show&#x27;s debut, later follows in his mother&#x27;s footsteps: he becomes a marijuana dealer, grower, and dispensary operator.

Nancy&#x27;s younger son, Shane (Alexander Gould), is highly intelligent yet poorly socialized and vulgar; he is deeply affected by his father&#x27;s death and yearns for more attention from his mother. In the first three seasons, Shane was also frequently bullied in school. After his peers harassed him in the bathroom for his sexual inexperience, his uncle pursues his request in taking him for a handjob at the local massage parlor. He is portrayed as having psychological issues. For instance, just before leaving Agrestic, Shane has conversations with his dead father. Upon moving to Ren Mar, he loses his virginity and becomes a temporary alcoholic. Shane also engages in violence: When he overhears his mother&#x27;s conversation with Estaban&#x27;s scornful boss and political consultant Pilar, who threatens his and Silas&#x27; life, Shane murders Pilar by abruptly striking her over the head with a croquet mallet before her body collapses into the pool. By the seventh season, he joins the police academy before receiving his criminal justice degree — working for the New York City Police Department in season eight.

Celia Hodes (Elizabeth Perkins) is Nancy&#x27;s &quot;frenemy&quot;. Obsessed with her personal image, she manipulates those around her who do not fit neatly into that image. She is unhappily married to Dean (Andy Milder) whom she regards as a &quot;loser asshole&quot;; they later divorce. Other characters also dislike her. Celia&#x27;s older daughter, Quinn (Haley Hudson), kidnaps her as revenge for shipping her to a reform school in Mexico. She is also demanding over her younger daughter Isabelle&#x27;s (Allie Grant) &quot;weight problem,&quot; and disapproves of her being a lesbian. At the end of the first season, Celia is diagnosed with breast cancer and cured with chemotherapy. When interrogated by the police over Nancy&#x27;s grow house in Celia&#x27;s home burning down the city, Dean, Doug, and other characters falsely allege that Celia coordinated it, which leads to her arrest. Following her release from prison, she becomes addicted to cocaine, so Isabelle arranges a rehab home intervention. Celia later becomes envious of Nancy; therefore, she dresses like her. After the fifth season, the actress left to pursue other projects.

Doug Wilson (Kevin Nealon) begins the series as an accountant and city councilman for the town of Agrestic. Doug is friends with many characters in the series including Andy, Dean, and Sanjay Patel (Maulik Pancholy); all four aid Nancy&#x27;s career as a marijuana dealer. Doug makes mistakes and loses his position; his wife Dana leaves him. He becomes a drifter who follows the Botwins during seasons four through eight. He and the Botwins move to New York City, where he becomes the chief accountant for a Ponzi scheme posing as a hedge fund.

The show has a changing cast of supporting characters. Heylia James (Tonye Patano) and her family — Conrad and Vaneeta, portrayed by Romany Malco and Indigo, respectively — play key roles during the first three seasons. They are wholesalers who supply marijuana to Nancy. Conrad later develops his own strain of marijuana, called MILF weed, which Nancy sells.

Season three features Sullivan Groff (Matthew Modine), an unethical, womanizing real estate developer with big plans for Agrestic. When Nancy moves to Ren Mar, the characters in Esteban&#x27;s drug cartel—primarily Cesar (Enrique Castillo), Ignacio (Hemky Madera), and Guillermo (Guillermo Díaz), the latter first appearing in the third season—take a leading role. Other key characters include Nancy&#x27;s housekeeper Lupita (Renée Victor); rival drug dealers; countless law enforcement officials; the romantic interests of Andy, Silas, and Shane; and the residents of Agrestic and Ren Mar.

In the sixth season, Nancy is on the run, and the new characters only have minor roles and appear for only a few episodes. An exception to this is Warren Schiff (Richard Dreyfuss), who she first met when teaching her math in high school; he becomes infatuated with Nancy. When the Botwins and Doug settle in New York City, new supporting characters are introduced. The family later settles in Nancy&#x27;s estranged sister Jill&#x27;s (Jennifer Jason Leigh) house in Connecticut, becoming a regular guest character by the eighth season.

Other recurring characters include Albert Brooks as Nancy&#x27;s father-in-law Lenny, Carrie Fisher as Celia&#x27;s lawyer, Dave Thomas as a doctor, Martin Short as a lawyer for Nancy&#x27;s custody battle, Alanis Morissette as a doctor at an abortion clinic, Zooey Deschanel as Andy&#x27;s estranged girlfriend, Lee Majors as a border guard, Mary-Kate Olsen as a student who worships Jesus and sells pot, as well as Aidan Quinn, among others.

== Episodes ==

As of September 16, 2012, 102 original episodes have been broadcast. The first season began August 8, 2005, and consisted of 10 episodes. The second season premiered on August 14, 2006, airing 12 episodes. The third season debuted on August 13, 2007, airing 15 episodes. The fourth season began June 16, 2008, the fifth season on June 8, 2009, and the sixth in August 2010, each with 13 episodes. The seventh season began airing on June 27, 2011, and, as of November 10, 2011, Weeds was renewed for an eighth and final season of 13 episodes that premiered Sunday, July 1, 2012.

In 2006, before Season two’s airing, the first few episodes were leaked online. Before the third season began, the first two episodes appeared online on July 22, 2007 (nearly a month before the August 13 premiere date). The third episode appeared online on July 24, 2007, with the fourth appearing just three days later. The fourth episode was, however, an incomplete version—among other things, some dubbed lines were not complete (notably part of a voice mail message by U-Turn is spoken by a distinctly different actor), and a card simply reading &quot;End Credits&quot; was inserted instead of the actual credits. On August 1, 2010, the first episodes of season 6 leaked online. Due to the high quality of the leaked episodes, downloaders of the torrents speculated that they were leaked intentionally to garner interest in the show and to create internet buzz. Episode leaks of other Showtime programs such as &quot;Californication&quot; and &quot;Dexter&quot; were seen as giving weight to this theory.

Jenji Kohan has stated that she does not mind episodes being distributed on the internet in this way, saying, &quot;Revenue aside, I don&#x27;t expect to get rich on &quot;Weeds&quot;. I&#x27;m excited it&#x27;s out there. Showtime is great, but it does have a limited audience.&quot; The show is rated TV-MA for drug content, profanity, nudity, brief violence, and other adult content.

=== Opening music ===

&quot;Little Boxes&quot; is the opening song for the first three seasons. The first season uses the version recorded by its composer Malvina Reynolds. In seasons two and three, the song is performed by various artists. In season four, the Malvina Reynolds version opens the first episode. Thereafter, the original titles and music are replaced by a short clip, different for each episode, that relates to the plot or some scene in the episode. The song is also subtly referenced in the eighth episode of the fourth season when a sleepy Nancy tells Shane that he&#x27;s going to &quot;...become a doctor or a lawyer or a business executive.&quot; In the opening credits of the eighth episode of season seven, a woman is heard humming the tune to &quot;Little Boxes&quot; as she arranges knickknacks on a shelf. In Season eight, the show returns to &quot;Little Boxes&quot; for the opening sequence.

The Region 1 Season One DVD is only available in 4:3 pan and scan format. The Region 2 and 4 releases are all in anamorphic widescreen. Season one was released on Blu-ray on May 29, 2007, and Season two was released on July 24, 2007. Both seasons include all episodes in 1080p widescreen with Dolby Digital EX sound and either DTS-HD (season one) or LPCM (season two), as well as extras exclusive to the Blu-ray release. Season three was released on Blu-ray on June 3, 2008. Seasons one to three on Blu-ray are multi-region discs; however, season four has been region-locked to region A only.

In late 2009, &quot;Weeds&quot; seasons four and five have been aired in at least one region B country, namely The Netherlands. Subsequently, a region 2 DVD of Season 4 has indeed been released. However, the region 2 DVD release was not accompanied by a region B Blu-ray. Showtime has not commented on whether they ever anticipate releasing a region B Blu-ray version, or if any further non-US transmission rights are agreed. The same region locking has been applied to Blu-ray for season five. In November 2011, Seasons 2–5 were released on Region B Blu-ray in Australia with Season 6 Region B Blu-ray released December 16, 2011. Blu-ray season seven is now available.

An extra feature on the Season Two DVD (a marijuana-based cooking show parody) was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification since it was regarded as &quot;likely [...] to promote and encourage the use of illegal drugs&quot;.

=== Books ===
On August 7, 2007, Simon Spotlight, a division of Simon and Schuster, published &quot;In the Weeds: The Official Guide to the Showtime Series&quot; by Kera Bolonik, which features interviews with the series creator/showrunner, its other writer-producers, and the entire cast. It also features detailed character and plot descriptions, recipes, trivia and behind-the-scenes information.

== Reception ==
In its first year, &quot;Weeds&quot; was Showtime&#x27;s highest rated series. The season 4 premiere attracted 1.3 million viewers to Showtime, the channel&#x27;s then-highest-ever viewership; the season as a whole averaged 962,000 viewers.

== Sequel ==
In November 2019, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that a sequel series was in development at Starz, titled &quot;Weeds 4.20&quot;. The series was to feature Mary-Louise Parker and Elizabeth Perkins reprising their roles with the story set 10 years after the conclusion of the original series. Victoria Morrow, who was a producer on the writing team for &quot;Weeds&quot;, was set to return as writer and executive producer on the spin-off series, while Kohan was not confirmed to be involved.

In May 2023, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported again that Parker was attached to star in and executive produce a &quot;Weeds&quot; project, now moved back to Showtime. Responding to the rumors, Parker told &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;every time I ask, it seems to be closer [...] but because of the strike, we don’t know&quot;. Justin Kirk expressed doubt on the sequel&#x27;s future in a separate interview in &quot;Variety&quot;, saying &quot;do you really want to see us all old and coming back?&quot;

<text>Texas Lutheran University (TLU) is a private Evangelical Lutheran university in Seguin, Texas.

==History==
The university traces its roots back to 1891 with the foundation of an academy, named Evangelical Lutheran College, by the first German Evangelical Lutheran Synod in Texas, in Brenham. Its first president was the Reverend Gottlieb Langner. That school accumulated crushing financial problems, but in 1912, it was rescued by an offer of 15 acres and $20,000 from local businessmen to relocate the academy to Seguin. Initially, the Lutheran College of Seguin, Texas, as it was newly named, had only one building on a bare former cotton field, with 46 students.

The academy reached junior college status in 1928 with accreditation from the Texas Department of Education. The Swedish Lutheran Trinity College of Round Rock was having trouble maintaining a minimum of 40 freshmen and 20 sophomores, so in 1929, it pooled its resources with the larger Seguin institution, bringing two professors and support from Swedish Lutherans. The combined school was renamed Texas Lutheran College in 1930. It became a four-year institution in 1948. Then, Texas Lutheran absorbed Clifton College of Clifton, a Norwegian Lutheran school in 1954, again gaining faculty and support from a larger base.

When the college received recognition in 1953 as a fully accredited senior college by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, faculty and students rang the &quot;Victory Bell&quot; in celebration for hours. After 40 years of growth, the institution was once again renamed, taking its present title of Texas Lutheran University in 1996. Over the 100 years since moving to Seguin, TLU&#x27;s span has increased to over 40 buildings and sports fields on 184 acres with about 1,400 students each semester.

==Academics==

Texas Lutheran University is ranked number five by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022 Best West Regional Universities and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. Specific programs are also accredited by ACBSP, CAATE, and TEAC.

==Campus==

The campus lies just off Interstate 10 on State Highway 46, between US Highway 90 and Alt US 90. The address is 1000 West Court St., which is also Alt. U.S. 90, and Seguin&#x27;s main east-west street.

The campus occupies more than 40 buildings and athletic fields covering 184 acres, as well as a biology field station at neighboring Lake McQueeney. Located in the heart of the campus is the Chapel of the Abiding Presence. There are several residence halls, as well as on-campus apartments and family housing for students who are married or have children. Student and alumni art can be found throughout campus, and sections of the sidewalk are designed for bricks dedicated to Texas Lutheran University affiliates. Oaks and other trees shade the campus, and rows of flowering crape myrtles provide color.

=== Chapel of the Abiding Presence ===
The Chapel of the Abiding Presence (locally known as the Weinert Chapel after the principal donors) is located in the heart of the campus. The Gothic Revival building of Austin limestone was designed by ecclesiastical architect Henry Steinbomer of San Antonio in 1954. The Chapel is listed in the Historic Campus Architecture Project of the Council of Independent Colleges. After a fire in 1969, architect Edward Sovik from St. Olaf College in Minnesota supervised the rebuilding with a nontraditional interior.

Today, the sanctuary can seat 40 and hosts a tracker-action Schlicker organ. The chapel is used by campus organizations to hold various activities and services, as well as weddings of students and alumni.

Chapel services that last 20 minutes are open to the public. They are held Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 10a.m.m during the academic year.

===Other notable buildings===

Also facing the quadrangle on the southwest corner was the Emma Frey Hall, a former women&#x27;s dormitory in Spanish Colonial Revival style by noted architect Marvin Eichenroht in 1929. The building was the oldest on the campus and had been remodeled to serve as offices for computer science and mathematics faculty offices, as well as the honors programs. Emma Frey Hall was demolished in 2017.

On the east side is Langner Hall, named for the first president of TLU, and built to plans by Atlee B. Ayers in 1947. Today, it houses classrooms and faculty offices for the social science and humanities departments, as well as the Mexican American Studies Center the Fiedler Memorial Museum, and an outdoor geological garden.

=== Residence halls ===

The North units are equipped with a full kitchen, and the South units include a kitchenette. 
Glazener apartments have two bedrooms with a full kitchen and house up to two students.
Bogisch family housing is reserved for students who are married or have children and have two bedrooms with a full kitchen.

Inside is the bookstore, Lucky&#x27;s Kennel snack bar, lounges, meeting rooms, a post office for on-campus mail, student publications offices and labs, and an academic computer lab. The ASC has offices for counseling, career development, and student activities.

It is a member of the Online Computer Library Center system and also provides an online public access catalog, which gives students access to databases in each academic discipline.

===Hein Dining Hall ===

Hein Dining Hall, with cafeteria-style service and food stations, is the main dining hall. The Centennial Commons seats 350 and is the general dining area for students. Other smaller dining rooms are the Timmerman Room, Suehs Room, and Katie Conference Center, which are often used by campus and community groups for meetings.

=== Jackson Auditorium ===

Jackson Auditorium seats 1,050 and many of the special events at TLU, like the Krost Symposium or concerts, happen here. It is also used by the Mid-Texas Symphony and other community and church organizations.

=== Classrooms and other buildings ===
Other campus buildings include O. G. Beck College Center, Moody Science Building, Tschoepe Hall, Health Center, Krost Center, Lutheran Ministry Center, Moline Center for Student Leadership, and the newest, Centennial Hall—named in celebration of 100 years in Seguin—with ground floor classrooms and housing above.

Schuech Fine Arts Center is a multipurpose facility with a 200-seat theater, recital hall, band hall, music studios, art labs, and a gallery.

The Jesse H. Jones Physical Education Complex, named for the former United States Secretary of Commerce Jesse H. Jones, has a 2,200-seat gym for intercollegiate basketball and volleyball games, offices for faculty and coaches, locker rooms, racquetball courts, and an eight-lane collegiate-size swimming pool, as well as the Grossman Fitness Center, the Kieffer Kinesiology Laboratory, and Rinn Field House.

The campus has intramural sports fields, the Gustafson Soccer Field, the Katt-Isbel Baseball Field, the Morck Softball Field, a putting green/driving range for the golf team, tennis courts, sandlot volleyball courts, a police department, and a maintenance complex.

A major expansion of intercollegiate sports was part of its 2013 Homecoming, when TLU officials broke ground for a football and track and field stadium, as well as a new and lighted softball field, lights for the baseball field (to allow night games), and a concession stand with toilets. The Bulldog teams began playing in the new facilities in 2014. The major expansion continued with the installation of lights for the Gustafson Soccer Field in 2015.

==Student life==

The Greek life opportunities for students include sororities and fraternities. The sororities include Beta Alpha Sigma, Xi Tau, Kappa Pi Gamma, and Sigma Delta Lambda. Fraternities include Sigma Phi Theta and Omega Tau.

Student organizations are offered in many areas on campus. Some are based on department, such as Athletic Training Club and Geography Club; Honorary Greek Organizations, such as Alpha Chi National Honors Society and Psi Chi Psychology Honors Society; Professional Organizations such as Alpha Kappa Psi National Business Fraternity and Student Education Association for Student Teachers; Band Service Fraternity and Sorority Kappa Kappa Psi, and Tau Beta Sigma; Campus Ministry and Religious Organizations such as Catholic Student Organization and Fellowship of Christian Athletes; Campus Organizations such as the Cheerleaders and the Student Government Association; Service and Social Organizations such as the Black Student Union and Mexican American Student Association; Theater Organizations such as Alpha Psi Omega, the theater honor society; Musical Organizations such as the variety of TLU choirs and TLU bands; Student Publications such as the Lone Star Lutheran Magazine and the Sidewalk; and others.

==Athletics==

=== Sports ===
Almost one-third of full-time TLU students take part in one of the intercollegiate sports.

The Athletics Department includes baseball, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, volleyball, women&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s track &amp; field, and recently football. All sports teams compete at the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) under the team name, the Bulldogs.

Starting July 1, 2013, Texas Lutheran University switched to a new conference, competing in the Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference, in all sports except football; as the SCAC does not have enough member schools with football teams. Meanwhile, the football team has been a member of the American Southwest Conference since the 2017 fall season (2017–18 school year), which it competed from the 1998 to 1999 fall seasons (1998–99 to 1999–2000 school years) as an affiliate; before becoming a full member of the ASC from 2000–01 to 2012–13. Texas Lutheran University claims two back-to-back national championships in football for the 1974 and 1975 seasons in the NAIA Division II Football National Championship. Both seasons were coached under legendary head coach Jim Wacker, who later went on to be a head coach at North Dakota State University (1976–1978), Southwest Texas State University, which is now Texas State University (1979–1982), Texas Christian University (1983–1991), and the University of Minnesota (1992–1996).

The schools in the SCAC are similar to TLU. Student-athletes receive no athletic scholarships. The others are Austin College in Sherman, Centenary College in Shreveport, Colorado College in Colorado Springs, University of Dallas in Irving, Schreiner University in Kerrville, Southwestern University in Georgetown, and Trinity University in San Antonio.

=== Conference championships ===

==Media==

===&quot;Lone Star Lutheran&quot;===

The &quot;Lone Star Lutheran&quot; (LSL) has been a student-run newspaper on the TLU campus for many years. In 2011, the LSL changed to a magazine format before returning to its original publication format of a tabloid newspaper in 2013. The staff includes the editor-in-chief, managing editor, four copy editors, a website manager, and a variety of student writers from all departments. Additionally, TLU offers a student module that allows students to work on the LSL for class credit.

===Bulldog TV===

Bulldog TV is the cable channel that is all about TLU.

==Christmas Vespers==
In preparation for the Christmas holidays, the TLU choirs collaborate with the TLU band to host the annual Christmas Vespers services. This celebration of music and word honors the integral role music has played and is playing in Texas Lutheran curriculum and cultural history. The service is usually held four days in Seguin and one or two days in Austin to allow the campus and Seguin communities, as well as TLU families and the Austin community, the opportunity to attend the service.

==Krost Symposium==
Every year, Texas Lutheran hosts a symposium focusing on a particular new topic. This multi-day Krost Symposium event brings in guest speakers with a range of viewpoints and experiences on the chosen topic. The first Krost Symposium was held in 1981 and the program has continued annually without interruption ever since. Events are free and open to the public.

<text>Edgar Melvin Sampson (October 31, 1907 – January 16, 1973), nicknamed &quot;The Lamb&quot;, was an American jazz composer, arranger, saxophonist, and violinist. Born in New York City, he began playing violin aged six and picked up the saxophone in high school. He worked as an arranger and composer for many jazz bands in the 1930s and 1940s. He composed two well-known jazz standards: &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be That Way&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in New York City, Sampson began his professional career in 1924 with a violin piano duo with Joe Colman. Through the rest of the 1920s and early 1930s, Sampson played with many bands, including those of Charlie &quot;Fess&quot; Johnson, Duke Ellington, Rex Stewart and Fletcher Henderson. 

In 1934, Sampson joined the Chick Webb band. It during his period with Webb that Sampson created his most enduring work as a composer, writing &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Be That Way&quot;. He left the Webb band in 1936 with a reputation as a composer and arranger that led to freelance work with Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Red Norvo, Teddy Hill, Teddy Wilson and Chick Webb.

Edgar Sampson became a student of the Schillinger System in the early 1940s. He continued to play sax through the late 1940s and started his own band (1949–51). In the late 1940s through the 1950s, he worked with Latin performers such as Marcelino Guerra, Tito Rodríguez and Tito Puente as an arranger. Sampson recorded one album under his own name, &quot;Swing Softly Sweet Sampson&quot;, in 1956. Due to illness, he stopped working in the late 1960s.

His daughter, Grace Sampson, 
studied music and co-wrote the standard &quot;Mambo Inn&quot; with Mario Bauzá and Bobby Woodlen.

<doc id="1067160" wikidata="Q35179" url="?curid=1067160" title="Chʼol language">
<text>The Ch&#x27;ol (Chol) language is a member of the western branch of the Mayan language family used by the Ch&#x27;ol people in the states of Chiapas, Tabasco, and Campeche in Mexico. This language, together with Chontal, Ch&#x27;orti&#x27;, and Ch&#x27;olti&#x27;, constitute the Cholan language group.

The Cholan branch of the Mayan languages is considered to be particularly conservative and Ch&#x27;ol along with its two closest relatives the Ch&#x27;orti&#x27; language of Guatemala and Honduras, and the Chontal Maya language of Tabasco are believed to be the modern languages that best reflect their relationship with the Classic Maya language.

Ch&#x27;ol-language programming is carried by the CDI&#x27;s radio station XEXPUJ-AM, broadcasting from Xpujil, Campeche.

== Dialects ==
There are two main dialects of Chʼol:
*Chʼol of Tila spoken by 43,870 people of whom 10,000 are monolinguals in the villages of Tila, Vicente Guerrero, Chivalito and Limar in Chiapas.
* Chʼol of Tumbalá spoken by 90,000 people of whom 30,000 are monolinguals in the villages of Tumbalá, Sabanilla, Misijá, Limar, Chivalita and Vicente Guerrero.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===
There are 21 consonantal segments in Chʼol. Below is the consonant inventory of Chʼol.
Corresponding orthography is presented in the angle brackets next to the IPA symbols.

For the segments in the palatal column, [, ] are palatalized alveolar consonants, and [, ] are palato-alveolar affricates. Another property of the consonant inventory is that only the labial has a voiced segment [b], which corresponds to the voiced bilabial implosive [ɓ] in Proto-Mayan.

Alveolar sounds [, ] are only heard as allophones of /, /.

=== Vowels ===
Chʼol has a six vowel system, as shown below in the vowel inventory.
The vowel &quot;ä&quot; is a distinctive segment in Chʼol, as in other Chʼolan languages. According to Kaufman and Norman (1984), long vowels in the Proto-Mayan language merged with their short counterparts in Chʼolan languages, except for &quot;*aa (long)&quot; and &quot;*a (short)&quot;. These segments went under a sound change, in which &quot;*aa&quot; became &quot;a&quot; and &quot;*a&quot; became &quot;ä&quot;.

=== Syllable Structure ===
Chʼol can have CV, CVC, CVCC, CCVC, CCVCC as possible syllable structures. The most common ones are CV and CVC.

Like many other Mayan languages, Chʼol does not allow onsetless syllables, which means words that appear to start with vowel in fact have a glottal stop as the onset.

Although complex onsets and complex codas exist, the former only occur across morpheme boundaries, and the latter are limited to &quot;j&quot;C.

=== Stress ===
The main stress of a word typically falls on the ultima in Chʼol. This is true for most of the native words and loanwords. In the following examples, the stress is indicated by an acute accent on the nucleus.

Compound words also have the main stress on the ultima. A secondary stress, indicated by a grave accent, can be heard in the first part of a compound word. This weak stress usually goes on the ultima of the first part.

== Orthography ==

=== Alphabet ===
Chʼol writers have agreed upon the following alphabet, based on the Latin alphabet, proposed and developed by Diaz Peñate in 1992.
=== Relationship with Mayan glyphs ===
The absence of glyphic material in Guatemala points that the calendar was a creation of the lowland Maya. Ch&#x27;ol has been considered one of the closer languages to several Mayan glyphs inscriptions. Lounsbury suggested that the ancient Palenqueños spoke a Proto-cholean language. A certain Palenque ruler has the glyph of a Quetzal head for his name and because the word for Quetzal in Chol is &quot;kuk&quot;, it is conjectured that his name was Lord &quot;Kuk&quot;. The affix Landa&#x27;s &quot;I&quot; that occurs only with posterior date indicators retains resemblance with the idea of past time of Ch&#x27;ol, such in &quot;hobix&quot; &#x27;five days hence,&#x27; &quot;hobixi&quot; &#x27;five days ago.&#x27; As vocabularies of Ch&#x27;ol, Chontal, Chorti, and Tzotzil are far from complete, it is not possible to establish some cognates between these languages and Mayan glyphs.

An alternative hypothesis developed by Houston, Robertson, and Stuart proposed that Classic Maya inscriptions between A.D. 250 and 850 convey to Eastern Ch&#x27;olan languages, more related to Chorti language than Ch&#x27;ol language. However, there is no consensus around the topic.

== Morphology ==
=== Affixation ===

Affixation is the main way of word formation in Chʼol. There are prefixes, infixes and suffixes. Suffixes are considerably more abundant than the other two.

==== Prefixes ====

There are two derivational prefixes – the noun class markers &quot;aj-&quot; and &quot;x-.&quot; The former can go with proper names, nominalize verbs, and be prefixed to some terms that refer to animals. The latter can also go with proper names and with the name of some animals, but additionally it can be prefixed to the name of some trees and plants.

In addition, Set A inflections are prefixed to nouns (10a) and verbs (10b).

==== Infixes ====

Infixation is used for passivization and as a mean of deriving numeral classifiers. First, some transitive roots reduce valence by infixing &quot;-j-&quot; into the root. This process is accompanied by a reduction of the number of core arguments from two to one, and the remaining argument referring to the patient is the subject of the verb.

For the other use of infixation, the derivations come mostly from positionals and verbs.

==== Suffixes ====

There are many suffixes in Chʼol since suffixation is the main way of derivation and inflection. For instance, the suffix &quot;-añ&quot; on nouns can derive intransitive verbs. The suffix &quot;-is&quot; causativizes some intransitive verbs. The suffix &quot;-b&quot; derives ditransitive verbs, and &quot;-ty&quot; derives some intransitive verbs by passivization of the corresponding transitive verb.

== Syntax ==

=== Case marking ===
Like almost all other Mayan languages, Ch&#x27;ol has two sets of person markers: ergative and absolutive. The Mayan tradition is to label the former as Set A and the latter as Set B. Chʼol is a split ergative language: its morphosyntactic alignment varies according to aspect. With perfective aspect, ergative-absolutive alignment is used, whereas with imperfective aspect, we rather observe nominative-accusative.

Set A markers are generally considered as suffixes; however, Martínez Cruz (2007) and Arcos López (2009) categorized them as proclitics. These markers usually denote the agents of transitive verbs.

Note that all markers have phonologically conditioned allomorphs: 1st singular marker changes from &quot;k&quot; to &quot;j&quot; when it precedes another &quot;k,&quot; and 2nd singular and 3rd singular markers have glides inserted when they precede consonants.

Set B markers are suffixes. These markers usually denote the patients of transitive verbs or the core arguments of intransitive verbs.
There are three plural markers for plural case marking in Ch&#x27;ol – two clitics and one suffix. The two clitics can be attached either before the singular person markers or after the verbal roots.
The exclusive 1st plural marker has a shorter form &quot;loñ&quot; and a longer form &quot;lojoñ.&quot; Both are used interchangeably, except when it is attached before a singular marker, in which case only the shorter form is allowed. The plural suffix -ob is often realized as &quot;-o&quot;&#x27; in speech.

=== Verbal predicates ===

The basic word order is VOS. However, word order varies and VOS is not always grammatical: factors including animacy, definiteness, topicalization and focus contribute to determining which word order is appropriate. A Ch&#x27;ol simple transitive phrase is comprised minimally of a single transitive verb in the form of [ASP Set A + Verb + Set B]. In the case of non-agentive intransitive verbs, the cross-reference of the single argument is accomplished with either Set A or Set B depending on the aspect of the verb. Verbal predicates can have the following aspects: perfective, imperfective, progressive, inceptive, terminative, and potential.

==== Transitive verbs ====
Within Chʼol transitive verbs, there exist two primary categories: simple forms and derived forms. The former modifies the primary arguments within the verb by cross-referencing the transitive subject in Set A and the object in Set B. In the perfective aspect, this category incorporates a status suffix, which is a vowel in harmony with the root vowel. Conversely, the imperfective aspect does not take such status suffix.

To form derived transitive verbs, the suffix &quot;-V&quot; or &quot;-Vñ&quot; is appended, based on the aspect. Unlike the simple forms, the suffix does not need to be in harmony with the root vowel. The direct arguments in this category are identified via Set A and Set B inflections.
=== Non-verbal predicates ===
This construction does not take aspect markers, in contrast to verbal predicates. It can be headed by nouns, adjectives, positionals, etc. The core argument only takes Set B markers.

<doc id="1067163" wikidata="Q875301" url="?curid=1067163" title="Itsukushima">
<text>is an island in the western part of the Inland Sea of Japan, located in the northwest of Hiroshima Bay. It is popularly known as , which in Japanese means &quot;Shrine Island&quot;. The island is one of Hayashi Gahō&#x27;s Three Views of Japan specified in 1643. Itsukushima is part of the city of Hatsukaichi in Hiroshima Prefecture. The island was part of the former town of Miyajima before the 2005 merger with Hatsukaichi.

Itsukushima is famous for the Itsukushima Shrine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The shrine was considered a sacred site for a long time, it is possible that locals built a simple shrine on the site before the complex was built in 593 AD. In 1168 AD, Taira no kiyomori, a warrior-courtier, greatly contributed to giving the shrine its current form. In the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, a famed Japanese warlord and shogun, built a large building, the Senjō-kaku, on a hill above the shrine.

Itsukushima has a number of temples, including Toyokuni Shrine with a five-storied pagoda, and Daiganji Temple - one of the three most famous Benzaiten temples of Japan. The island is also famous for its upper hill side cherry blossoms and maple leaf autumn foliage.

The island of Itsukushima, including the waters around it (part of Seto Inland Sea), lies within Setonaikai National Park. This sea is affected by strong tides. At low tide, the bottom of the sea is exposed past the island&#x27;s torii. At high tide, the sea covers all the previously exposed seabed mud and fills areas underneath the shrine boardwalk.

==Location and geography==
Itsukushima is mountainous and sparsely settled. It has an elementary school and a middle school. There are no traffic signals. It is rural and mountainous, only , and has a population of about 2000. There are no cities, only small towns with simple houses and privately owned shops. The islanders work hard to preserve the forests and respect nature.

Frequent ferry services, operated by JR West (JR Miyajima ferry) and by Miyajima Matsudai Tourist Ship, carry traffic between the island and the mainland at Miyajimaguchi. The trip takes about ten minutes. There is an hourly express passenger ferry to Hiroshima harbour.

Miyajima&#x27;s maple trees are renowned throughout Japan and blanket the island in crimson in the autumn. Momiji manjū, pastries filled with azuki jam or custard, are popular souvenirs and carry maple-leaf emblems. Many other varieties such as chocolate and cheese are available. Because the island is seen as sacred, trees may not be cut for lumber. Sika deer roam freely. Deer are thought of as sacred in the native Shinto religion because they are considered messengers of the gods. They walk the streets of the city, not afraid of the tourists.
The shamoji, a style of wooden paddle used to serve cooked rice without impairing the taste, is said to have been invented by a monk who lived on the island. The shamoji is a popular souvenir, and there are some outsized examples around the shopping district.

The peak of Mount Misen, at 535 m, is the highest point on the island. Miyajima Ropeway carries visitors to within a 30-minute hike to the top. There are several sites related to the historic Buddhist priest and founder of Shingon Buddhism, (774–835), including Daishō-in, near the top.

The island contains the on its north coast.

People often take the short ferry ride from mainland Japan to pray at Miyajima&#x27;s shrines and to marvel at the beauty of its forests. Shrines on the island include Senjokaku (Toyokuni Shrine), Five-storied Pagoda, Two-storied Pagoda, Kiyomori Shrine, and Omoto Shrine.

==Shrines and temples==

In Japan, the term &quot;shrine&quot; implies a Shinto religious structure and &quot;temple&quot; implies a Buddhist one.

===Itsukushima Shrine===

Miyajima is famous for the which is a Shinto shrine. It is known for its &quot;floating&quot; torii gate. The historic shrine complex is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as one of the National Treasures by the Japanese government.

===Daiganji Temple===
Next to the Itsukushima Shrine is Daiganji Temple, dedicated to Goddess Benzaiten as well as three Buddhas important to Shingon Buddhism. Benzaiten Goddess in Japan has been traced to Goddess Saraswati of Hinduism in India. She is the Goddess of eloquence, music, arts, wealth and knowledge. The three Buddha in the temple are Gautama Buddha, Wisdom Buddha and Mercy Buddha.

Daiganji Temple is one of the three most famous Benzaiten Temples in Japan, along with Enoshima Benzaiten (Kanagawa) and Chikubujima Benzaiten (Shiga). The Benzaiten is opened to the public only once every year on June 17. On this day, Miyajima holds a big festival, and people of the region visit the temple to offer their prayers.

The precise date for the first construction of Daiganji Benzaiten temple is unclear. It was reconstructed around 1200 AD in the Kamakura period. The construction date of Itsukushima-jinja and Daiganji temple is estimated to be 6th century or later, and the existence of Itsukushima-jinja is confirmed by early 9th century by ancient Japanese texts. The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; confirms the sacredness of these Miyajama structures during the Heian Period (794-1184).

===Daishō-in Temple===

Daishō-in is a historic Japanese temple on Mount Misen, the holy mountain on the island. It is the 14th temple in the Chūgoku 33 Kannon Pilgrimage and famous for the maple trees and their autumn colors. It is also called &quot;Suishō-ji&quot;. As the headquarters of the Omuro branch of Shingon Buddhism, it is the most important temple of Miyajima. The temple was the administrator of the Itsukushima shrine before Meiji Restoration forbade (Shinbutsu bunri) syncretism (Shinbutsu-shūgō) between Shinto and Buddhism in 1868.

===Senjokaku (Toyokuni Shrine)===
Senjokaku (lit. &quot;pavilion of 1000 mats&quot;) is the largest structure at Miyajima Island as the name implies. Toyotomi Hideyoshi started construction of Senjokaku as a Buddhist library in which the chanting of Senbu-kyo sutras could be held for fallen soldiers. Hideyoshi died in 1598 and the building was never fully completed. Originally, Amitabha Buddha and two Buddhist saints, Ānanda and Mahākāśyapa, were enshrined in the structure until the Meiji reformation. Then, the structure was converted into a Shinto shrine dedicated to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Numerous votive picture tablets that had been hanging in the Itsukushima Shrine buildings until the Meiji era, have been hung on the walls inside the hall.

===Five-storied Pagoda (Gojunoto)===
The nearby Five-storied Pagoda constructed in 1407 (thus predating Senjokaku) enshrined Yakushi Nyorai Zazo, the Buddha of Medicine said to have been made by Kobo Daishi himself, accompanied by Fugen Bosatsu (Mercy Buddha) and Monju Bosatsu (Wisdom Buddha). The three images were moved to the Daiganji Temple during the Meiji reformation.

<doc id="1067164" wikidata="Q1274273" url="?curid=1067164" title="Chʼol people">
<text>The Chʼol are an Indigenous people of Mexico, mainly in the northern Chiapas highlands in the state of Chiapas. As one of the Maya peoples, their indigenous language is from the Mayan language family, known also as Chʼol. According to the 2000 Census, there were 140,806 speakers of Chʼol in Chiapas, including 40,000 who were monolingual.

==Geographical history==
The Maya regions can be divided into three eco-logical areas: Southern Lowland, Northern Lowlands, and highlands/pacific slope region. The northern area was important because of its salt production, limestone, and cacao production. The limestone was essential to the construction of the Mayan cities and sculptures. The highlands consist of volcanic areas that are surrounded by mountain ranges from the Chiapas to Southern Guatemala. The mountain peaks vary from . Additionally, the landscape is characterized by valleys with fertile land and large lakes. These characteristics made the region appealing to explorers who later exploited the locations abundant natural resources.

== History of the Chʼol in Mexico ==
In 1554, the Spanish military first invaded Lacandon jungle, where the Lakandon Chʼol and other indigenous groups lived. At the end of the 1550s, the Spanish invasion forced the Chʼol and other Mayan groups into settlements called Reducciones. Eventually, when the reducciones were split, the Chʼol were sent to the North, to Palenque, Tilá, and Tumbalá. The people sent to these regions were the ancestors of today&#x27;s Chʼol. The Chʼol were forced to work on encomiendas until the Spanish crown gave them a document called the &quot;cédulas reales&quot; which granted them the land they had worked on for generations.

In the 19th century, President Benito Juarez established a system of agrarian ejidos with the intent of changing the traditional system of production in Mexico. To establish the system, Juarez took away land from indigenous tribes such as the Chʼol. However, the ejidos did not provide enough natural resources to support the Chʼol people. As a result, the Chʼol began to move into the Lacandon Jungle. Today there is conflict between the Chʼol and the Lacandon-Yucatec speakers as the Chʼol continue to move into the land the Lacandones now claim as their own.

==Language==
The language that is called Chʼol in English is referred to as &quot;Lak tyʼañ&quot; means &quot;our speech&quot;. The word Chʼol refers to both the language and the people.

The Chʼol language consists of three branches: Sabanilla, Tilá and Tumbalá. Although some linguists consider them as three different languages, they are commonly known as dialects of the same Chʼol language. Speakers of Tilá and Tumbalá can usually understand each other. In total, there are an estimated 120,000 speakers of the Chʼol language. The Tilá speakers inhabit Chiapas, Tila, and while the Tumbala inhabit north central Chiapas, Tumbala, Sabanilla, Misjia, Limar, Chivalita. Both dialects are spoken in Vicente Guerrero, Limar, and Chivalito.

Although most Chʼol people are monolingual, those that speak Spanish have a variation called &quot;Castia&quot;. This form of Spanish is characterized by:

*Continued use of archaisms that are no longer used in other varieties in Spanish like: 
*Use of Vos instead of tu in second person singular
*Phonetic transformation in the second singular: &quot;i&quot; is dropped and &quot;e&quot; is stressed. For example: Vos quereis = Vos queres
*Frequent use of &quot;lo&quot; even when there is a masculine or feminine article: &quot;lo hizo las tortillas&quot; o &quot;lo miro el rio&quot;

==Food and culture==
The Chʼol practice Christianity. However, many Mayan traditions are incorporated into the Chʼols&#x27; Christian religious practices (more so than in other regions of Mexico). For example &quot;cave worship has been legitimized throughout the region and local curers alternate between churches and caves to gain their powers and carry out their functions. Earth owner, the Mayan cave god, and Christ have been reconciled, and cave ceremonies have continued to be performed since the conversion of the population to Christianity.&quot;

The staple food of the Chʼol people are corn, livestock (chicken, turkey), beans, squash, bananas, greens and other fruits.
A source of income for some Chʼol includes selling livestock, (like pigs, cows and chicken) as well as fruits; this income is used to purchase soap, medicine and other essential materials.

== Education and bilingualism ==
The growing interaction between Spanish speakers and Chʼol speakers has created a desire for higher education and more job opportunities. The interaction has also heightened the need to learn Spanish and has caused the stigmatization of native languages including Chʼol. However, the majority of Spanish speakers in the Chʼol community are males, younger women, and children. Children learn to speak Spanish in primary school; they are taught in Chʼol till fourth grade when instruction begins to be given in Spanish. In some rural villages, there are secondary schools, but for higher education most have to travel to a different town. However, the cost of doing so generally prohibits this. In México, education is mandatory through secondary school, but many Chʼol students (especially girls) stop attending around the sixth grade due to early marriage and financial issues.

<doc id="1067172" wikidata="Q33672" url="?curid=1067172" title="Kalanga language">
<text>Kalanga, or TjiKalanga (in Zimbabwe), is a Bantu language spoken by the Kalanga people in Botswana and Zimbabwe. It has an extensive phoneme inventory, which includes palatalised, velarised, aspirated and breathy-voiced consonants, as well as whistled sibilants.

Kalanga is recognised as an official language by the Zimbabwean Constitution of 2013 and is taught in schools in areas where its speakers predominate. The iKalanga language is closely related to the Nambya, TshiVenda, and KheLobedu languages of Zimbabwe and South Africa.

==Classification and varieties==
Linguists place Kalanga (S.16 in Guthrie&#x27;s classification) and Nambya (in the Hwange region of Zimbabwe) as the western branch of the Shona group (or Shonic, or Shona-Nyai) group of languages, collectively coded as S.10.

Kalanga has a dialectal variation between its Botswana and Zimbabwean varieties and they use slightly different orthographies. Historically, Wentzel mentioned Kalanga proper in the east and Lilima (Tjililima, Humbe) on the west, as well as varieties that are now rare or extinct: Nyai (Rozvi), Lemba (Remba), Lembethu (Rembethu), Twamamba (Xwamamba), Pfumbi, Jaunda (Jawunda, Jahunda), and †Romwe, †Peri, †Talahundra (Talaunda).

==Phonology==

=== Consonants ===
* Phonemes occur only as marginal phonemes.
* Sounds are sounds that are borrowed from Tswana.

=== Vowels ===
Kalanga has a typical five-vowel system:

<doc id="1067185" wikidata="Q499283" url="?curid=1067185" title="Azure tit">
<text>The azure tit (Cyanistes cyanus) is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout Russia, Central Asia, northwest China, Manchuria, and Pakistan.

It is found in temperate and subarctic deciduous or mixed woodlands, scrub, and marshes. It is a resident species, and most birds do not migrate. It nests in tree holes, laying approximately 10 eggs. The bird is a close sitter, displaying defensive behaviors such as hissing and biting when disturbed. Its diet primarily consists of insects, seeds, small invertebrates, bug larvae, and eggs.

This bird is unmistakable. Its head, tail corners, wing bars, and underparts are white, while the upperparts are blue. It has a distinctive dark line running through its eye.

This bird is the eastern counterpart of the common Eurasian blue tit. It will hybridise with that species, but the offspring usually show a blue crown, rather than the white of azure tit. The calls are similar to blue tit, calling &#x27; or a scolding&#x27;. The song is a &quot;&quot;, which has been described as intermediate between blue tit and crested tit.

There are some records of the species in other parts of Europe, including in Finland, Sweden, Poland and Austria.

==Taxonomy==
For many years the azure tit was known as &quot;Parus cyanus&quot;. In 2005, analysis of the mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequences of the Paridae indicated that &quot;Cyanistes&quot; was an early offshoot from the lineage of other tits, and more accurately regarded as a genus rather than a subgenus of &quot;Parus&quot;.

The azure tit not infrequently hybridizes with the blue tit in western Russia; the resulting birds are called Pleske&#x27;s tit (&quot;Cyanistes&quot; × &quot;pleskei&quot;) and were once considered a distinct species.

The population in central Asia, yellow-breasted tit (&quot;C. c. flavipectus&quot; or &quot;Parus flavipectus&quot;), is sometimes included as a subspecies of the azure tit.

<text>Franz Reuleaux (; ; 30 September 1829 – 20 August 1905) was a German mechanical engineer and a lecturer at &quot;Technische Hochschule Berlin&quot; (today Technische Universität Berlin), later appointed as the president of the academy. He was often called the father of kinematics. He was a leader in his profession, contributing to many important domains of science and knowledge.

Today, he may be best remembered for the Reuleaux triangle, a curve of constant width that he helped develop as a useful mechanical form.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Reuleaux was born in Eschweiler in Germany (at the time part of Prussia). His father and grandfather were both mechanical engineers. His technical training was at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic School. He then studied at universities in Berlin and Bonn.

===Middle years===
After a time spent in the family business he became a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute in Zürich. Eventually, in 1879 he became Rector at the Königs Technischen Hochschule Berlin – Charlottenburg. This was a major technical institute, with about 300 professors. He became widely known as an engineer-scientist — a professor and industrial consultant, education reformer and leader of the technical elite of Germany.

Reuleaux was the appointed chairman of the German panel of judges for the Sixth World Industrial Fair opened in Philadelphia on 10 May 1876. He admitted that German-made goods were far inferior to those of other countries and that German industry&#x27;s guiding principle was “billig und schlecht” (English: cheap and shoddy). This shook business and evoked wide comment in the press.

Reuleaux was a consultant to the development of the Otto-Langen internal combustion engine, winner of the 1867 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris, France, based on efficiency.

Reuleaux served on several international juries and commissions and considerably involved in formation of a patent system, as he was active in German politics.

In 1877, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1882.

===Kinematics===
Reuleaux believed that machines could be abstracted into chains of elementary links called kinematic pairs. Constraints on the machine are described by constraints on each kinematic pair, and the sequence of movements of pairs produces a kinematic chain.

He developed a compact symbolic notation to describe the topology of a very wide variety of mechanisms, and showed how it could be used to classify them and even lead to the invention of new useful mechanisms. At the expense of the German government, he directed the design and manufacture of over 300 beautiful models of simple mechanisms, such as the four-bar linkage and the crank. These were sold to universities for pedagogical purposes. Today, the most complete set are at Cornell University College of Engineering.

Using his notation and methods for systematically varying the elements (e.g. inversions, changing relative sizes of the links, etc.) he showed how the four-bar linkage could be mutated into 54 mechanisms, which fall within 12 classes.

<text>Douz ( &quot;&quot;) is a town in the Kebili Governorate in the south of Tunisia, known as the &quot;gateway to the Sahara.&quot; By road it is located southwest of Blidet, southeast of Tozeur, and south of the Tunisian capital of Tunis.

==History==
It has been called the &quot;ultimate palm oasis&quot;, because it has over 500,000 palm trees in the area, and it is a major producer of &quot;diglat noor&quot; dates. In previous times it was an important stop on the trans-Saharan caravan routes. Today, it is a destination for tourists who are interested in seeing the desert, and a starting point for desert treks by camel, motorcycle, or four-wheel-drive vehicle.
==Culture==
Every year Douz hosts the International Festival of the Sahara, a four-day celebration of traditional desert culture. The festival, usually held in November or December, features traditional music and dancing, poetry readings, camel wrestling, and racing of horses and salugis. Douz is home to the Museum of the Sahara, which showcases displays on traditional nomadic desert culture of the Mrazig people who now mostly live a settled life in the town.

==Demography==
The majority of inhabitants of Douz are from Arab descent (Banu Sulaym) 
Douz is the home of Mrazig people.

<text>The Porte du Peyrou is a triumphal arch in Montpellier, in southern France. It is situated at the eastern end of the Jardin de Peyrou, a park near the center of the city.

The arch was designed by François Dorbay, after the model of the Porte Saint-Denis in Paris. Its construction was completed in 1693. Its rusticated surface is crowned by a Doric entablature, suitable to a martial monument. Its later panels in bas-relief and inscriptions glorifying King Louis XIV of France were added in 1715.

These reliefs show four major events from the reign of Louis XIV, rendered as allegories:
* the capture of Namur during the War of the Grand Alliance, in which the figure representing the Dutch Republic kneels before Louis XIV.
* Louis in the figure of Hercules being crowned by Victory.
* the digging of the Canal du Midi that links the Bay of Biscay with the Mediterranean Sea.
* the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes.

<text>Dublin Chamber of Commerce also known as the Dublin Chamber, is the oldest chamber of commerce in Ireland.

==Origins==

The Dublin Chamber of Commerce was founded in 1783. It had been preceded by other collective bodies including the Guild of Merchants, which dated from the mediaeval period, and the Ouzel Galley Society, established at the beginning of the 18th century. Dublin Chamber&#x27;s formation followed a weakening of the merchant guild system which left an opening for bodies which advocated free trade. Much of the focus of the organisation in its early years was on abolishing impositions and opposing restrictions on export trade. Travers Hartley served as the first president of the Chamber from 1783 to 1788.

The creation of Dublin Chamber led to the formation of other chambers of commerce around Ireland, including Waterford (1787), Limerick (1805), Cork (1819), and Londonderry (1885). By 1819, there were 19 chambers of commerce operating in Britain and Ireland, and a federation, the Association of Chambers of Commerce, was created in 1860 to include the Irish chambers. Following independence, the chambers in Ireland became members of the Association of Irish Chambers of Commerce, a body now known as Chambers Ireland.

In 1996, Mary Finan was appointed president of the Chamber, the first woman to hold the position.

==Notable past presidents==
Notable former presidents have included:
*Arthur Guinness II (1827–1855)
*Malcolm Inglis (1900–1902)
*Andrew Jameson (1921)
*Henry Morgan Dockrell (1933)
*Eddie Kelliher (1978)
*Mary Finan (1996)

<doc id="1067204" wikidata="Q416096" url="?curid=1067204" title="Griseofulvin">
<text>Griseofulvin is an antifungal medication used to treat a number of types of dermatophytoses (ringworm). This includes fungal infections of the nails and scalp, as well as the skin when antifungal creams have not worked. It is taken by mouth.
Common side effects include allergic reactions, nausea, diarrhea, headache, trouble sleeping, and feeling tired. It is not recommended in people with liver failure or porphyria. Use during or in the months before pregnancy may result in harm to the baby. Griseofulvin works by interfering with fungal mitosis.
Griseofulvin was discovered in 1939 from the soil fungus &quot;Penicillium griseofulvum&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1071/ch13639&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
Griseofulvin is used orally only for dermatophytosis. It is ineffective topically. It is reserved for cases in which topical treatment with creams is ineffective.

Terbinafine given for 2 to 4 weeks is at least as effective as griseofulvin given for 6 to 8 weeks for treatment of Trichophyton scalp infections. However, griseofulvin is more effective than terbinafine for treatment of Microsporum scalp infections.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
The drug binds to tubulin, interfering with microtubule function, thus inhibiting mitosis. It binds to keratin in keratin precursor cells and makes them resistant to fungal infections. The drug reaches its site of action only when hair or skin is replaced by the keratin-griseofulvin complex. Griseofulvin then enters the dermatophyte through energy-dependent transport processes and binds to fungal microtubules. This alters the processing for mitosis and also underlying information for deposition of fungal cell walls.

==Biosynthesis==
It is produced industrially by fermenting the fungus &quot;Penicillium griseofulvum&quot;.

The first step in the biosynthesis of griseofulvin by &quot;P. griseofulvin&quot; is the synthesis of the 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain by a type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) via iterative addition of 6 malonyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA starter unit. The 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain undergoes cyclization/aromatization, using cyclase/aromatase, respectively, through a Claisen and aldol condensation to form the benzophenone intermediate. The benzophenone intermediate is then methylated via &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl methionine (SAM) twice to yield griseophenone C. The griseophenone C is then halogenated at the activated site ortho to the phenol group on the left aromatic ring to form griseophenone B. The halogenated species then undergoes a single phenolic oxidation in both rings forming the two oxygen diradical species. The right oxygen radical shifts alpha to the carbonyl via resonance allowing for a stereospecific radical coupling by the oxygen radical on the left ring forming a tetrahydrofuranone species. The newly formed grisan skeleton with a spiro center is then &quot;O&quot;-methylated by SAM to generate dehydrogriseofulvin. Ultimately, a stereoselective reduction of the olefin on dehydrogriseofulvin by NADPH affords griseofulvin.

==Toxicology==
===Mice===
Griseofulvin is found to alter the bile metabolism of mice by Yokoo et al. 1979. The same team went on to find a similar effect on mice by a chemically unrelated substance, 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine, in Yokoo et al. 1982 and Tsunoo et al. 1987.

<text>Colorectal surgery is a field in medicine dealing with disorders of the rectum, anus, and colon. The field is also known as proctology, but this term is now used infrequently within medicine and is most often employed to identify practices relating to the anus and rectum in particular. The word &quot;proctology&quot; is derived from the Greek words , meaning &quot;anus&quot; or &quot;hindparts&quot;, and , meaning &quot;science&quot; or &quot;study&quot;.

Physicians specializing in this field of medicine are called colorectal surgeons or proctologists. In the United States, to become colorectal surgeons, surgical doctors have to complete a general surgery residency as well as a colorectal surgery fellowship, upon which they are eligible to be certified in their field of expertise by the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery or the American Osteopathic Board of Proctology. In other countries, certification to practice proctology is given to surgeons at the end of a 2–3 year subspecialty residency by the country&#x27;s board of surgery.

==Scope of the specialty==

Colorectal surgical disorders include:

* varicosities or swelling, and inflammation of veins in the rectum and anus (hemorrhoids)
* unnatural cracks or tears in the anus (anal fissures)
* abnormal connections or passageways between the rectum or other anorectal area to the skin surface (fistulas)
* severe constipation conditions
* fecal incontinence
* protrusion of the walls of the rectum through the anus (rectal prolapse)
* birth defects such as the imperforate anus
* treatment of severe colic disorders, such as Crohn&#x27;s disease
* cancer of the colon and rectum (colorectal cancer)
* repositioning of the rectal area if fallen out
* anal cancer
* any injuries to the anus
* removal of objects inserted into anus
* performing colonoscopies
* performing hemorrhoidectomies

==Surgical treatment and diagnostic procedures==

Surgical forms of treatment for these conditions include: colectomy, ileo/colostomy, polypectomy, strictureplasty, hemorrhoidectomy (in severe cases of hemorrhoids), minimally invasive surgery, anoplasty, and more depending on the condition the patient has. Diagnostic procedures, such as a colonoscopy, are very important in colorectal surgery, as they can tell the physician what type of diagnosis should be given and what procedure should be done to correct the condition. Other diagnostic procedures used by colorectal surgeons include: proctoscopy, defecating proctography, sigmoidoscopy. In recent times, the laparoscopic method of surgery has seen a surge of popularity, due to its lower risks, decreased recovery time, and smaller, more precise incisions achieved by using laparoscopic instruments.

==Mechanical bowel preparation==
Mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) is a procedure lacking evidence in literature, wherein fecal matter is expelled from the bowel lumen prior to surgery, most commonly by using sodium phosphate.

<text>The Aero Boero AB-115 is an Argentine civil utility aircraft. It was developed from the AB-95-115, a refined AB-95 with a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics. Specific differences included wheel spats, a redesigned engine cowling molded of fiberglass, and aluminum ailerons and flaps.

The type was successfully exported to Brazil, and used extensively as trainers by aero clubs.

Production of the AB-115 ended in January 1973. The following month a modified version, the -115BS, was flown. It featured greater wingspan, swept empennage members, and greater fuel capacity.

==Design==
The AB-115 is a high-wing monoplane, with strut-braced rectangular wings (NACA 23012 profile). The wings are made of metal, the fuselage and empennage members are made of fabric-covered welded steel tubes. It is a development of Aero Boero&#x27;s earlier AB-95.

The trainer version, the most common variant, contains two seats in tandem configuration, with the pilot-flying/student pilot in the front seat, and the instructor/pilot-not-flying seating in the rear. Behind the rear seat there is a cargo hold, with capacity of up to 25 kg (55 lb). The front seat has a three-point seatbelt, while the rear one has a simple, abdominal belt. Both occupants enter and exit the aircraft through one single, large door in the right side of the cockpit.

The flight commands are duplicated, with the front seat&#x27;s center stick, throttle lever, rudder pedals and brake pedals mechanically connected to the rear seat&#x27;s. The rear stick and the throttle lever can be disassembled when carrying passenger(s).

The primary flight commands are actuated by cables and pulleys. The ailerons and flaps are made of aluminum alloy, while the rudder and elevators are made of steel tubes and fabric. The flaps have four positions (neutral, 15°, 30° and 45°), and are actuated manually, by a lever in the upper left part of the cockpit. The pitch trim tab is located in the trailing edge of the left elevator, and is actuated by a handle in the left side of the cockpit. The rudder and the left aileron also have ground-adjustable trim tabs.

A Lycoming O-235-C2A air-cooled engine, rated at 115 hp (85.8 kW), drives a Sensenich Propeller model 72 CK-050, metallic fixed-pitch twin-bladed propeller. The fuel system uses a FACET MA 3PA carburetor, equipped with carburetor heat. Electrical power is supplied by a Prestolite alternator. The ignition system is driven by dual Bendix Scintilla S5LN magnetos; the starter motor is also by Prestolite. The engine incorporates a wet crankcase, and the lubricant is cooled by an oil radiator in the front of the engine&#x27;s air intake, which is triggered by a bi-metallic thermostatic valve.

The maximum fuel capacity is 115 liters, with 110 liters usable. The engine can use gasoline of 80/87 to 100/130 octane. Each wing contains an aluminum fuel tank in the root. Fuel quantity is indicated by sight glasses in the wing roots. There are two separate fuel selectors, for each tank, which can be independently opened and closed.

The aircraft uses a conventional undercarriage. Each main gear is fixed to the fuselage at three points – two articulated joints, plus one shock absorber. The wheels are made of aluminum alloy and magnesium, and are equipped with independent hydraulic-actuated brakes. There is no parking brake; when parked, it must be secured by . The tailwheel is connected to the rudder by bungee springs, and it can also rotate freely when &quot;unlocked&quot;.

The instrument panel is, since the AB-115 is mostly used for basic flight training. The flight instruments are an airspeed indicator, altimeter, VSI a turn coordinator, and a magnetic compass. The engine instruments are a tachometer, oil pressure and oil temperature indicators, and an ammeter. The panel includes one Bendix/King VHF radio and one Bendix/King transponder. The cabin instruments are flood-lit; the light operates when the running lights are on. The right wing has two landing lights, which have a five-minute continuous operating limit.

<text>Crystal field excitation is the electronic transition of an electron between two orbitals of an atom that is situated in a crystal field environment. They are often observed in coordination complexes of transition metals. Some examples of crystal field excitations are &quot;dd&quot;-transitions on a copper atom that is surrounded by an octahedron of oxygen atoms, or &quot;ff&quot;-transitions on the uranium atom in uranium antimonide.

<text>The Aero Boero AB-180 is an Argentine civil utility aircraft, a substantially improved development of the AB-95. It featured a more powerful engine and incorporated the aerodynamic changes made on the AB-115 and improved on them. The first example flew in 1967 and was in production until 2000.

==Variants==
*AB-180RV – long-range version
*AB-180RVR – glider tug
*AB-180 Condor – high-altitude version of 1971 with optional turbocharger (4 built)
*AB-180Ag – agricultural aircraft with 270 L (66 US gal) belly tank for chemicals
**AB-180SP – 180Ag with an additional set of short wings to make a sesquiplane. In this variant, the agricultural application liquid is carried within the short wings, rather than in a belly tank. The added wings allow a fully loaded stall speed of 56 km/h (35 mph), compared to 89 km/h (55 mph) in the AB-180Ag.
*AB-180PSA – two-seat primary training aircraft

<doc id="1067222" wikidata="Q1494188" url="?curid=1067222" title="Spermatid">
<text>The spermatid is the haploid male gametid that results from division of secondary spermatocytes. As a result of meiosis, each spermatid contains only half of the genetic material present in the original primary spermatocyte. 

Spermatids are connected by cytoplasmic material and have superfluous cytoplasmic material around their nuclei.

When formed, &quot;early round spermatids&quot; must undergo further maturational events to develop into spermatozoa, a process termed spermiogenesis (also termed &quot;spermeteliosis&quot;). 

The spermatids begin to grow a living thread, develop a thickened mid-piece where the mitochondria become localised, and form an acrosome. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive.

In 2016 scientists at Nanjing Medical University claimed they had produced cells resembling mouse spermatids artificially from stem cells. They injected these spermatids into mouse eggs and produced pups.

During spermatid haploid genome remodeling, the majority of histones are replaced by protamines, and the DNA is compacted. During this compaction, transient single- and double-strand breaks are introduced into the sperm DNA. The conventional non-homologous end joining pathway for repairing double-strand breaks is not available for elongated spermatids. However, spermatids can carry out limited repair of exogenous and programmed double-strand breaks using an alternative error-prone non-homologous end joining repair pathway. If DNA strand breaks persist in mature sperm, the result can be increased sperm DNA fragmentation which is associated with impaired fertility and an increased incidence of miscarriage.
==DNA repair==

As postmeiotic germ cells develop to mature sperm they progressively lose the ability to repair DNA damage that may then accumulate and be transmitted to the zygote and ultimately the embryo. In particular, the repair of DNA double-strand breaks by the non-homologous end joining pathway, although present in round spermatids, appears to be lost as they develop into elongated spermatids.

<doc id="1067223" wikidata="Q17097900" url="?curid=1067223" title="Formally real field">
<text>In mathematics, in particular in field theory and real algebra, a formally real field is a field that can be equipped with a (not necessarily unique) ordering that makes it an ordered field.

==Alternative definitions==
The definition given above is not a first-order definition, as it requires quantifiers over sets. However, the following criteria can be coded as (infinitely many) first-order sentences in the language of fields and are equivalent to the above definition.

A formally real field &quot;F&quot; is a field that also satisfies one of the following equivalent properties:

* −1 is not a sum of squares in &quot;F&quot;. In other words, the Stufe of &quot;F&quot; is infinite. (In particular, such a field must have characteristic 0, since in a field of characteristic &quot;p&quot; the element −1 is a sum of 1s.) This can be expressed in first-order logic by formula_1, formula_2, etc., with one sentence for each number of variables.
* There exists an element of &quot;F&quot; that is not a sum of squares in &quot;F&quot;, and the characteristic of &quot;F&quot; is not 2.
* If any sum of squares of elements of &quot;F&quot; equals zero, then each of those elements must be zero.

It is easy to see that these three properties are equivalent. It is also easy to see that a field that admits an ordering must satisfy these three properties.

A proof that if &quot;F&quot; satisfies these three properties, then &quot;F&quot; admits an ordering uses the notion of prepositive cones and positive cones. Suppose −1 is not a sum of squares; then a Zorn&#x27;s Lemma argument shows that the prepositive cone of sums of squares can be extended to a positive cone . One uses this positive cone to define an ordering: if and only if belongs to &quot;P&quot;.

==Real closed fields==

A formally real field with no formally real proper algebraic extension is a real closed field. If &quot;K&quot; is formally real and Ω is an algebraically closed field containing &quot;K&quot;, then there is a real closed subfield of Ω containing &quot;K&quot;. A real closed field can be ordered in a unique way, and the non-negative elements are exactly the squares.

<text>The Aero Boero AB-210 is an Argentine civil utility aircraft, a development of the AB-180 with improved performance delivered by a fuel-injected engine. Unlike previous aircraft by this manufacturer, it also featured tricycle undercarriage, but retained the same general high-wing configuration. Only a single prototype was built, first flying on 22 April 1971.

The aircraft was later re-engined with a more powerful Lycoming O-540 and redesignated the AB-260 (not to be confused with the unrelated Aero Boero 260AG). A second example was also built to this standard, but no serial production ensued.

For her work on &quot;Larry Sanders&quot;, Jerald received a CableACE Award nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy Series in 1996. Two years later, she earned an NAACP Image Award nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. She continued playing Beverly until the show ended in 1998.

Throughout the 1990s, Jerald guest starred in several television series, including &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, &quot;Cosby&quot; and &quot;Family Law&quot;. She appeared as Lavinia in television film &quot;Class of &#x27;61&quot; and portrayed Lorraine in &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; (1993).

Following &quot;Larry Sanders&quot;, Jerald appeared in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; playing freighter captain Kasidy Yates, the love interest for the series&#x27;s main character Benjamin Sisko, a recurring role which she played from 1995 to the show&#x27;s end in 1999.

Jerald&#x27;s most-recognized role came in 2001 when she appeared in the Kiefer Sutherland-led Fox series, &quot;24&quot;, playing Sherry Palmer, the wife of Senator David Palmer. Jerald believed it was the first role to test her acting ability, claiming the majority of her previous characters were &quot;easy-going.&quot; She appeared in all but two of the first season episodes and multiple episodes of the second and third seasons. She received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2003 alongside her &quot;24&quot; co-stars.

In 2003, Jerald portrayed Condoleezza Rice in &quot;DC 9/11: Time of Crisis&quot;, a TV movie about the September 11 attacks in 2001. She reprised the role in the miniseries &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;, which aired September 10–11, 2006.

She made guest appearances on episodes of &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot;. Jerald gave voice to Amanda Waller in animated series &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters Chronicles&quot; in 2015.

Jerald joined the cast of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot; in its fourth season as the new captain of the 12th Precinct, Victoria &quot;Iron&quot; Gates, replacing Ruben Santiago-Hudson&#x27;s deceased character Roy Montgomery as captain of the precinct. In 2015, Jerald announced on Twitter that she had been let go from the series, and was herself &quot;saddened&quot; and &quot;surprised&quot; by the news. Regarding Jerald&#x27;s exit from the series, &quot;Castle&quot; showrunner Alexi Hawley stated it was &quot;very difficult&quot; writing her out of the series.

She was later cast in the role of Dr. Claire Finn in the Fox/Hulu science-fiction series &quot;The Orville&quot;. In 2019, Jerald provided the voice of Sarafina in &quot;The Lion King&quot;, a remake of the 1994 film.

<text>Go! was a Saturday morning entertainment show on the Radio One network of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that ran from 2002 to 2010, hosted by Brent Bambury. The show included interviews, music, live performances, and comedy bits.

The show first aired as a summer series in 2002, concurrently with Bambury&#x27;s stint as host of &quot;All in a Day&quot;, the network&#x27;s local afternoon program in Ottawa. Following a second summer run in 2003, the show was added to the network&#x27;s regular year-round schedule that fall.

The show was produced in Ottawa before moving to Toronto in 2005. After 2004, most episodes were broadcast in front of a live studio audience.

According to Bambury, &quot;we wanted to do a show that wasn&#x27;t about anything, so every week was a voyage of discovery to figure out what it was about. But what it was really about was that you didn&#x27;t have to think very hard. You didn&#x27;t have to feel smart about anything to listen to it. It was the opposite of a CBC show.&quot; The show&#x27;s format commonly took the form of a pop culture contest of some type. For example, three celebrities would compete against each other in a trivia match, or celebrity judges would evaluate amateur stand-up comedians or celebrity impersonators. Early in the show&#x27;s run, this included a consistent regular feature titled &quot;Groove Shinny&quot;, which set a Canadian musician against a &quot;perfect musical mind&quot; (Richard Crouse) and a &quot;perfect stranger&quot;, for a music trivia match. At other times, the show would simply broadcast offbeat comedy and entertainment segments, such as guests singing Bible passages or a comedic mock kidnapping of Governor General Adrienne Clarkson.

Regulars included Nana aba Duncan who appeared in an audience participation features titled &quot;Contest Nana&quot;, in which she presented an audio montage of soundclips which listeners can e-mail the show to identify. The feature was previously hosted by comedian Sabrina Jalees. Kliph Nesteroff hosted a segment titled &quot;That Time of the Month&quot;, showcasing unintentionally funny audio ephemera from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. A live musical guest also often appeared, performing three or four numbers during the course of the show.

The last episode of the show aired on June 26, 2010. In September, Bambury launched a new public affairs magazine show, &quot;Day 6&quot;, in the same time slot. &quot;Go&#x27;s&quot; weekly listener montage contest was retained on &quot;Day 6&quot; as &quot;Riffed from the Headlines&quot;.

<doc id="1067247" wikidata="Q543788" url="?curid=1067247" title="Violet Jacob">
<text>Violet Jacob (1 September 1863 – 9 September 1946) was a Scottish writer known especially for her historical novel &quot;Flemington&quot; and for her poetry, mainly in Scots. She was described by a fellow Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid as &quot;the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets&quot;.

==Early life==
Jacob was born Violet Augusta Mary Frederica Kennedy-Erskine, at the House of Dun, the daughter of William Henry Kennedy-Erskine (1 July 1828 – 15 September 1870) of Dun, Forfarshire, a captain in the 17th Lancers and Catherine Jones (died 13 February 1914), the only daughter of William Jones of Henllys, Carmarthenshire. Her father was the son of John Kennedy-Erskine (1802–1831) of Dun and Augusta FitzClarence (1803–1865), the illegitimate daughter of King William IV and Dorothy Jordan. She was a great-granddaughter of Archibald Kennedy, 1st Marquess of Ailsa.

The area of Montrose where her family seat of Dun was situated was the setting for much of her fiction. She married, at St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Princes Street, Edinburgh, on 27 October 1894, Arthur Otway Jacob (1867–1936), an Irish major in the British Army, and accompanied him to India where he was serving. Her book &quot;Diaries and letters from India 1895–1900&quot; is about their stay in the Central Indian town of Mhow. The couple had one son, Harry, born in 1895, who died as a soldier at the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Arthur died in 1936, and Violet returned to live at Kirriemuir, in Angus. She died of heart disease on 9 September 1946 and was buried beside her husband at the graveyard at Dun.

==Scots poetry==
Violet Jacob was described by Hugh MacDiarmid as &quot;by far the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets&quot;, a view he did not rescind over a fifty-year period. She was particularly known for her poems in the Angus dialect. Her poetry was associated with that of Scots revivalists like Marion Angus, Alexander Gray and Lewis Spence, who drew their inspiration from early Scots poets such as Robert Henryson and William Dunbar, rather than from Robert Burns.

Jacob is commemorated in Makars&#x27; Court, outside the Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. Selections for Makars&#x27; Court are made by the Writers&#x27; Museum, The Saltire Society and The Scottish Poetry Library. In 1936 she was awarded an honorary LLD degree by Edinburgh University.

&quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, a conversation between the author and the North Wind, is a melancholic poem on the theme of homesickness. It was set to music as &quot;Norlan&#x27; Wind&quot; and popularised by Angus singer and songmaker Jim Reid, who also set to music other poems by Jacob and those other Angus poets such as Marion Angus and Helen Cruikshank. Another version, sung by Cilla Fisher and Artie Trezise, appeared on their 1979 Topic Records album &quot;Cilla and Artie&quot;. Traditional folk band Malinky are among many other artists who have released versions of &quot;Norland Wind&quot;.

==Prose==
Apart from her collections of poetry and short stories, Violet Jacob published an Erskine family history (&quot;Lairds of Dun&quot;, 1931) and five novels, the best known of which is the tragic &quot;Flemington&quot; (1911; reissued in 1994), set in the aftermath of the Jacobite rising of 1745. &quot;Flemington&quot; was described by John Buchan as &quot;the best Scots romance since &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot;&quot;.

<text>Global Garden (stylized in all caps) is a manga by Saki Hiwatari, who is best known as the creator of &quot;Please Save My Earth&quot;.

The series was published in Hakusensha&#x27;s &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; which comes out bi-weekly in Japan. The series is completed at 8 volumes.

==Story==
The story begins in Princeton, New Jersey, 1954, with Albert Einstein. Einstein is living in regret of his discovery of mass-energy equivalence (&quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;²), believing it led to the construction of the atomic bomb.

He meets two children, Hikaru and Haruhi, who can see the past and future in their dreams. They tell him that ever since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Yggdrasil, the tree of life, is dying.

However they discover that in the future there is a girl with special powers who saves the tree. Einstein then gives them drugs which slow their aging so they can meet this girl. He dies later the same day; April 18, 1955. He then becomes the story&#x27;s disembodied narrator, following around the young boy Robin.

In Tokyo, 2005, Hikaru and Robin finally find the girl, Ruika. Ruika is pretending to be her young brother Masato, who died in an airplane crash, to keep her mother from grieving.

==Characters==
*Hikaru – A &#x27;young&#x27; man driven by his need to meet a Goddess in the Global Garden. Since childhood, he has experienced dreams of her in several forms. He was given a pill to slow his aging, and though he&#x27;s 60, he appears 18 or so. His mission is to save the Earth via a wish in the Global Garden. However, he finds the &#x27;Goddess&#x27; in her human form a more important reason to live. 
*Haruhi – Another &#x27;young&#x27; man driven by the same needs as Hikaru. However, Haruhi is twisted and selfish in his methods to secure the Goddess. He seems to care for no one except himself and his own wishes.
*Robin – A seemingly cheerful and friendly mute boy. He was adopted by Hikaru after his adoptive parents died in a car accident. Oddly mature at times, this child is actually the clone of two people—the famous Einstein, and Hikaru himself. Eventually he receives the other &#x27;half&#x27; of Hikaru&#x27;s soul, and some of Einstein&#x27;s memories. Then he realizes his true purpose—he is the key to the Global Garden. This came with nothing but anguish for the boy—it was at the cost of Hikaru&#x27;s life. Robin didn&#x27;t want to live without the people he loved and who were treasured family to him.
*Ruika – The &#x27;Goddess&#x27; in her present form, also called Verdandi. Ruika is a young girl trying desperately to live as her brother Masato, who died years before. Her mother would only see her as her brother. When she meets Hikaru and Robin, she begins to change and want to be herself, the girl Ruika who was buried for so long. She also learns to use the power within her.
*Albert Einstein

<doc id="1067260" wikidata="Q7133714" url="?curid=1067260" title="Parables for Wooden Ears">
<text>Parables for Wooden Ears is the debut studio album released by the Australian band Powderfinger. It was released on 18 July 1994 by Polydor Records, after recording at the Metropolis Studios in Melbourne during February 1994. The album peaked a number 51 on the ARIA charts, selling 10,000 copies.

The album was received poorly by critics who complained about its poor imitation of Americana, as well as its overuse of complex riffs. In a 2004 interview, Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning said, in reference to the album, &quot;God knows what we were on then.&quot;

Three singles were released from the album, all of which failed to chart.

== History ==
In a 1996 interview, Fanning described &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; as &quot;big and presumptuous&quot;, and stated that it had &quot;a pretty massive sort of sound&quot;. He said that the band somewhat regretted this, and did not intend to do so again on future releases.

On &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;, Powderfinger worked with the producer Tony Cohen, whom Fanning described as having a huge reputation, and thus being expensive to work with. However, because of the &quot;lack of an obvious single&quot;, the album sold poorly, despite the effort put into production. &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; contained references by Powderfinger to Aboriginal rights, with a song written by the drummer Jon Coghill discussing the idea that the band&#x27;s generation was the first to reach out to the concept of reconciliation.

In 1998, the guitarist Ian Haug described their third album &quot;Internationalist&quot; as a moderation between the band&#x27;s last two albums, calling &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; a &quot;complicated beast&quot;. In a 1999 interview, Fanning said that the band &quot;were sorting out our sound&quot; on the album, and that despite it not working well they still thought it was &quot;a good record&quot;. &quot;Juice&quot; commentator Simon Wooldridge noted in 2000 that &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; contained &quot;million&quot;s of riffs, and thus the band were not able to produce a simple sound on the album.

In a November 2004 interview with the Melbourne newspaper, &quot;The Age&quot;, Fanning recalled that the head of Polydor Records had described the album as &quot;awful&quot; and remarked that &quot;God knows what we were on then&quot;. He also said that in making &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;, Powderfinger &quot;went through this weird stage of trying to be something [they] weren&#x27;t.&quot; Fanning also told &quot;Australian Musician&quot; that the album, a &quot;spectacular failure&quot;, was a result of the band feeling &quot;forced&quot; to play like other bands that were popular in Brisbane at the time.

== Release and response ==
&quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; was released on 18 July 1994 on the Polydor Records label. Three singles were released from &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot;: &quot;Tail&quot;, released on 14 June 1994, &quot;Grave Concern&quot;, released on 22 August 1994, and &quot;Save Your Skin&quot;, released on 22 July 1995. Due to the minimal promotion and reputation of the band, the singles failed to reach the ARIA top 100, with &quot;Tail&quot; performing the best, peaking at 118.

Critics generally agreed with Powderfinger&#x27;s assessment of the album, with some describing it as &quot;a thundering rock album&quot; and noting the similarity to Americana. Fanning also noted that the album had a lot less &quot;balance&quot; than the album that followed it, &quot;Double Allergic&quot;. Other critics noted that &quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; had a &quot;dark, overly complex metal sound&quot; and complained of the album&#x27;s &quot;distorted guitars&quot;, but put this down to the album being a learning experience for the band.
&quot;Parables for Wooden Ears&quot; received a moderate response from reviewers. &quot;Juice&quot; reviewer John Encarnacao enjoyed the rock elements of the album, drawing comparisons to Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Alice In Chains. He thanked producer Tony Cohen for the &quot;big sound&quot; of the album, and said that the musicians on the album &quot;not only know about power and restraint, but also play tastefully&quot;. Encarnacao stated that Fanning &quot;lays the emotion on thick and usually more than gets away with it.&quot; The review was summarised by stating that the album may have been &quot;a bit like the retro-rock that the big corporations want you to buy&quot;, but that nonetheless it was a good album.

Jackson G. Marx was similarly conflicted in &quot;Australian Rolling Stone&quot;, writing, &quot;They create painstaking technical &#x27;works&#x27; of art. This is not necessarily a compliment. Sometimes it&#x27;s a certified jerk-off.&quot; Despite describing some songs as, &quot;tragically clever,&quot; and, &quot;grooveless monstrosities,&quot; he scored the album three stars from five, and wrote of the pleasure of repeated listens. &quot;&#x27;Tail&#x27;, for example, is tangled and inert and teeters precariously on the brink of disappearing up its own arsehole, but a determined listener will find its hooks more infecting with each spin.&quot;

&quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; contributor James Bishop gave the album a score of 2.5 (average), summarising his review with the statement &quot;Get &quot;Double Allergic&quot; instead.&quot; Bishop stated that the album contained too much imitation, and that the album is &quot;pretty much forgotten by even the most hardcoriest of music fans&quot; because of the poor imitation in it - described as &quot;a simple case of &quot;monkey see, monkey not do very well&quot;.&quot; Bishop praised some aspects of the album, stating that &quot;Hurried Bloom&quot; contained &quot;a raw song-writing ability&quot; and that &quot;Sink Low&quot; was &quot;a hidden gem&quot;. However, he said that the majority of songs contained Powderfinger trying too hard with their riffs, noting &quot;Bridle You&quot; and &quot;Father&#x27;s Pyramid&quot; as specific examples. Bishop also criticised the lyrics in most songs, stating that &quot;Walking Stick&quot; contained &quot;some horrendously &quot;bad&quot; lyrics&quot;. The highlight of the album for Bishop was &quot;Save Your Skin&quot;, which he called &quot;a gorgeous addition to their collection&quot;, despite calling the overall album &quot;a pretty dark and depressing experience&quot;.

<text>Filmfare is an Indian English-language fortnightly magazine published by Worldwide Media. Acknowledged as one of India&#x27;s most popular entertainment magazines, it publishes pieces involving news, interviews, photos, videos, reviews, events, and style. The magazine also annually gives the Filmfare Awards, the Filmfare Awards South, the Filmfare Awards East, the Filmfare Marathi Awards, the Filmfare Awards Punjabi, the Filmfare Awards Bangla, the Filmfare OTT Awards, the Filmfare Short Film Awards and the Filmfare Style &amp; Glamour Awards.

After the businessman Ramkrishna Dalmia (1893–1978) of Dalmia Group purchased Bennett, Coleman and Company Limited (BCCL) in 1946, J. C. Jain from Bharat Insurance Company was employed to help him in running the company in 1950. In this period, Jain conceived the idea of &quot;Filmfare&quot; at the actress Kamini Kaushal&#x27;s house. The magazine was launched by the industrialist Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain alongside his wife Rama in Bombay on 7 March 1952. Its circulation started to decline in the early 1990s and to handle these problems, &quot;Filmfare&quot; started special monthly editions for Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam cinema. In 2004, BCCL (who previously published the magazine) established a subsidiary, &quot;Worldwide Media&quot;, for publishing its future issues.

==History==
===Establishment (1946–1952)===
Ramkrishna Dalmia (1893–1978) was born in Chirawa into a Marwari family. He had a brother, Jaidayal Dalmia, with whom he established Dalmia Group in the 1930s. In 1946, on the threshold of the independence of India from the United Kingdom, Ramkrishna Dalmia purchased Bennett, Coleman and Company Limited (BCCL) for . According to Sangita P. Menon Malhan&#x27;s &quot;The TOI Story&quot; (2013), the purchase was by him solely because he wanted to establish newspapers that could help him to &quot;serve India effectively&quot;. While Dalmia was searching for a person to help him to run it, J. C. Jain, a former employee of Bharat Insurance Company, saw the opportunity and took it in March 1950; he became the company&#x27;s general manager until 1963.

During his term-of-office, Jain started the publication of &quot;Filmfare&quot; as a fortnightly magazine on 7 March 1952 to &quot;build awareness about filmmaking and films&quot;. It was launched by Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain and his wife Rama in Bombay, distributed by &quot;The Times of India&quot; newspaper, and promoted with the taglines, &quot;Another name for &#x27;Credibility and &quot;The first serious effort in film journalism in India&quot;. It contains short biography of rising actors at the time, film reviews, and a number of columns, including &quot;The Fortnight in Films&quot; and &quot;Filmfacts&quot;. Published two months after the 1st International Film Festival of India, Neepa Majumdar (in her 2012 book &quot;Global Neorealism: The Transnational History of a Film Style&quot;) wrote that the magazine &quot;saw the festival as an opportunity for Indian film [actors] to be exposed to quality films&quot; and established themselves as leading actors. In the first issue, a manifesto was declared:

It is from this dual standpoint of its industry and its patrons, whom comprise the vast audience of movie fans, that &quot;Filmfare&quot; is primarily designed. This magazine represents the first serious effort in film journalism in India. It is a movie magazine—with a difference. The difference lies in our realisation that the film as a composite art medium calls for serious study and constructive criticism and appreciation from the industry as also from the public.

===The Filmfare Awards (1953–2001)===
In the following year, &quot;Filmfare&quot; instituted the Filmfare Awards (previously Clare Awards, named after Clare Mendonça). Modelled after the Academy Awards, the winners were voted by a total of 20,000 of the magazine&#x27;s readers. The first iteration&#x27;s ceremony took place at Metro Cinema in Bombay on 21 March 1954, and only five categories without nominations were presented: Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Music Director. The award has been considered one of the oldest and most prominent film awards in India; &quot;Business Line&quot; called it &quot;one such coveted award&quot;.

In 1957, &quot;Filmfare&quot; published the &quot;Self-portraits&quot; series, where several well-known actors at the time, including Ashok Kumar, Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar, Meena Kumari, Nargis, Nutan and Raj Kapoor, were invited and accepted to talk about themselves and their experiences. The magazine faced controversy after the actress Sharmila Tagore did a shot with her photographer Dhiren Chawda with only wearing a two-piece floral bikini for its 19 August 1966 issue. The first time for an Indian celebrity to pose with only a bikini for a magazine cover, she revealed that it was her personal choice but later admitted she had &quot;no idea&quot; why she wanted to. In association with United Producers (a group formed by G. P. Sippy, Shakti Samanta and B. R. Chopra), &quot;Filmfare&quot; organised the United Producers-Filmfare Talent Contest (also known as the All India Talent Contest) in 1965.

In the 1970s, Rauf Ahmed worked as the editor of the magazine, replacing B. K. Karanjia who had filled the position for 18 years. Talking to &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; in 2015, Ahmed spoke of how the magazine nearly collapsed at the time as no gossip columns were written by its journalist. Following his quit, Bikram Singh (the actor K. N. Singh&#x27;s brother) was hired for the position until the early of the next decade. Pritish Nandy replaced him in 1984; the first issue he edited was published in July that year, titled &quot;Unquestionably No. 1&quot;, which features the actress Sridevi on the cover. The circulation of &quot;Filmfare&quot; dropped in the early 1990s, prompting the publisher to attach free consumer products (such as soaps or shampoo sachets) to the magazine. Additionally, special monthly editions with a few pages dedicated to Malayalam, Tamil and Telugu cinema were begun and, as reported by &quot;The Quint&quot; in 2019, become commercial successes. Khalid Mohamed was appointed as the editor in 1993.

=== Ownership change (2002–present) ===

In 2002, following Mohamed&#x27;s nine-year tenure, Shashi Baliga replaced him as &quot;Filmfare&quot; editor; in an article published in &quot;Business Line&quot;, she described the occupation as &quot;an opportunity that came unsought&quot;. BCCL announced their joint venture with the BBC Worldwide, a company named Worldwide Media, on 1 December 2004; the new company later published the future issues of the magazine. In 2006, Jitesh Pillai was appointed as the new editor. &quot;Filmfare&quot; launched the Filmfare Awards East in 2014, the Filmfare Style &amp; Glamour Awards and Filmfare Marathi Awards in 2015, the Filmfare Short Film Awards in 2016, the Filmfare Awards Punjabi in 2017, and the Filmfare OTT Awards in 2020. , the magazine was published by Joji Varghese under The Times Group&#x27;s subsidiary Worldwide Media and Pillai served as the editor.

== Reception ==
&quot;Filmfare&quot; covers news, interviews, photos, videos, reviews, events, and style. It is considered one of the most popular and reputable magazines in India; &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot; referred to the magazine as &quot;decorous&quot;, and British magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot; praised it for &quot;[providing] a good example of how the mainstream media marginalizes certain films as &#x27;sleaze. According to a 2004 article by &quot;The Economic Times&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s monthly print circulation was 147,000. In 2008, the cinema and cultural analysis professor Rachel Dwyer estimated that it was 200,000. In a survey conducted by the Indian Readership Survey, the circulation of the magazine was 276,000 in 2013 and 342,000 in 2014.

<doc id="1067272" wikidata="Q587847" url="?curid=1067272" title="Bandits (2001 film)">
<text>Bandits is a 2001 American crime comedy-drama film directed by Barry Levinson and written by Harley Peyton. It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, and Cate Blanchett. The film was released in theaters on October 12, 2001. It received mixed reviews, and Thornton and Blanchett&#x27;s performances received critical praise. Thornton and Blanchett were nominated for Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor and Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical, and Blanchett was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Screen Actors Guild Awards.

==Plot==
Two friends and convicts, Joe and Terry, break out of Oregon State Penitentiary in a concrete mixing truck and start a bank robbing spree, hoping to fund a dream they share. They become known as the &quot;Sleepover Bandits&quot; because of their &quot;modus operandi&quot;: they kidnap the manager of a target bank the night before a planned robbery, then spend the night with the manager&#x27;s family; early the next morning, they accompany the manager to the bank to get their money. Using dim-witted would-be stunt man Harvey Pollard as their getaway driver and lookout, the three successfully pull off a series of robberies that gets them recognition on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted list, and ultimately the reward for information leading to their capture is increased to $1 million.

When Kate, a housewife with a failing marriage, decides to run away, she ends up in the hands of the criminals. Initially attracted to Joe, she also ends up in bed with Terry and a confused love triangle begins.

The three of them go on the lam and manage to pull off a few more robberies, but after a while the two begin to fight over Kate, and she decides to leave them. The two criminals then decide to pull off one last job.

The story is told in flashbacks, framed by the story of the pair&#x27;s last robbery of the Alamo Bank, as told by &quot;Criminals at Large&quot;, a fictional reality television show, with which they taped an interview stating that Kate was only a hostage, not a participant. The show tells the story of their last job, which is known to be a failure when Kate tips off the police and the two are caught in the act. The two then begin to argue when Joe tells the police &quot;You won&#x27;t take us alive!&quot; and the argument gets to the point where the two of them shoot each other dead.

At the end of the film the real story behind the last job is revealed: Harvey used some of his special effects to make it seem as though Terry and Joe were shooting each other. Dressed as paramedics, Harvey and his girlfriend Claire then run in and place the stolen money, Terry, and Joe in body bags while Kate (who was in on the plan) distracts the police by pretending to pass out in shock upon seeing the &quot;bodies&quot;. In the ambulance, Harvey used electronics to blow out his tires which sent the ambulance into a junkyard. Under his jumpsuit, Harvey was wearing a fire suit. He lit himself on fire and rigged a bomb to go off. Harvey, Claire, Terry, and Joe flee the scene, leading officials to believe that the bodies were burned beyond recognition. Kate receives the $1 million reward for having turned them in.

Reunited, Joe, Terry, Harvey, and Kate make it to Mexico to live out their dream. The last scene shows Harvey and Claire getting married in Mexico and Kate kissing Joe and Terry passionately.

==Reception==
 Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Time Out&quot; wrote, &quot;Despite a plot as old as the hills and a title that pitches for outlaw nostalgia, this is a reasonable hybrid, a character-led comic ramble along the highways and byways of genre - buddy pic, heist film, romance and road movie. Add light media satire and, with Levinson&#x27;s emphasis on performance and dialogue, you have a higher-end studio project, albeit overlong and uneven, with a residue of indie spirit.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the movie 2 stars out of possible 4, praising the main performances but criticizing the uneven tone, writing: &quot;It&#x27;s rare for a movie to have three such likable characters and be so unlikeable itself.&quot;

In 2007 in New York, five men were prosecuted and convicted for crimes imitative of this film&#x27;s plot.

===Box office===
In its opening weekend, the film opened at #2, behind &quot;Training Day&quot;, earning $13 million. It beat out other newcomer &quot;Corky Romano&quot; by just over four million dollars. The film grossed $67.6 million worldwide, against a budget of $75 million.

==Home media==
&quot;Bandits&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on April 2, 2002. On March 22, 2016, the film was released on Blu-ray.

<text>Darlingtonia californica —also called the California pitcher plant, the Oregon pitcher plant, cobra lily or cobra plant—is a species of carnivorous plant in the new world pitcher plant family, Sarraceniaceae. It is the sole species within its monotypic genus, &quot;Darlingtonia&quot;. The cobra lily is native to Northern California and Oregon, in the western United States, where the climate—while typically thought of as cool and humid—may be quite arid for many months of the year, more so than many carnivorous or pitcher plant genera could feasibly survive (such as &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, &quot;Nepenthes&quot; or &quot;Sarracenia&quot;). However, the cobra lily has evolved into life along the West Coast and in the lower Pacific Northwest through its carnivorous adaptions, where it may be found near bogs, vernal pools, on forested rocky slopes (near snowmelt, especially), creeks, or near seeps with cold running water, usually on serpentine soils. It has even been observed growing in drainage ditches or on the sides of roads. Despite being fairly commonly cultivated, &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; is designated as uncommon due to its rarity in the field.

The name &quot;cobra lily&quot; stems from the resemblance of its tubular leaves to a rearing cobra, complete with a forked leaf – ranging from yellow to purplish-green – that resemble fangs or a serpent&#x27;s tongue.

The plant was discovered during the Wilkes Expedition of 1841 by botanist William D. Brackenridge at Mount Shasta, Northern California. In 1853, it was described by John Torrey, naming the genus &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; after Philadelphian botanist William Darlington (1782–1863).

Cultivation in the UK has gained the plant the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Biology==
The cobra plant is not just restricted to nutrient-poor acidic bogs and seepage slopes, but many colonies actually thrive in ultramafic soils, which are in fact basic soils, within its range. In common with most carnivorous plants, the cobra lily is adapted to supplementing its nitrogen requirements through carnivory, which helps to compensate for the lack of available nitrogen in such habitats.

===Root system===
Because many carnivorous species live in hostile environments, their root systems are commonly as highly modified as their leaves. &quot;Darlingtonia californica&quot; is no exception. The cobra lily has a very large and rambling root system when compared to those of other carnivorous plants in the family Sarraceniaceae. The cobra lily is able to survive fire by regenerating from its roots, but despite this important role the roots are very delicate organs. While the temperatures in much of the species&#x27;s range can exceed 25 °C (77 °F), their roots die back after exposure to temperatures not much higher than 10 °C (50 °F) . Temperature plays a large part in the functioning of all plants, but it is very rare for individual organs to have such different temperature tolerances. The physiological mechanisms and evolutionary benefits of this discrepancy are not fully understood, however, in habitat the plants are normally found growing out of cold seeps, and this behavior would cause the plant to only expend energy growing roots in the direction of cold subsurface water sources. The reason for this extraordinary sensitivity of the roots to high temperatures is currently believed to be caused by a very low and limited optimal temperature of the ion pumps in root cells. 

Modern cultivation efforts in breeding and selecting plants that can withstand higher temperatures without the roots dying back have met with significant success. As a result, there are several cultivars available as commercial house or garden plants which are more tolerant of higher temperatures. Many wild populations grow in serpentine (ultramafic) soils which are toxic to most green plants. Populations found growing on serpentine can withstand soil temperatures above 80 °F based on field studies of various cobra lily populations in Oregon, most of which are found growing on slopes composed of serpentine with cold subsurface water flow. The plants can suffer from root rot in cultivation if grown in stagnant, standing water and tend to thrive in areas where cold subsurface water slowly flows underground around their roots. It is not currently understood why the plants can withstand higher soil temperatures when found growing on serpentine soils.

===Pitcher mechanisms===
The cobra lily is unique among the three genera of American pitcher plants. It does not trap rainwater in its pitcher. Instead, it regulates the level of water inside physiologically by releasing or absorbing water into the trap that has been pumped up from the roots. It was once believed that this species of pitcher plant did not produce any digestive enzymes and relied on symbiotic bacteria and protozoa to break down the captured insects into easily absorbed nutrients. However, recent studies have indicated that &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; secretes at least one proteolytic enzyme that digests captured prey. The cells that absorb nutrients from the inside of the pitcher are the same as those on the roots that absorb soil nutrients. The efficiency of the plant&#x27;s trapping ability is attested to by its leaves and pitchers, which are, more often than not, full of insects and their remains.

The slippery walls and hairs of the pitcher tube prevent trapped prey from escaping. In addition to the lubricating secretions and downward-pointing hairs common to all North American pitcher plants to force their prey into the trap, this species uses its curled operculum (hood) to hide the tiny exit hole from trapped insects and offers multiple translucent false exits. Upon trying many times to escape via the false exits, the insect will tire and fall down into the trap. Other species that use a low-hanging hood to hide the exit hole include the parrot pitcher plant, &quot;Sarracenia psittacina&quot; and the hooded pitcher plant, &quot;Sarracenia minor&quot;. &quot;S. psittacina&quot; also forms a curled operculum, while &quot;S. minor&quot; uses a leaf that is folded over the entrance. A misconception about &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; is that its forked tongue is an adaption to trap insects. However, a study done by &quot;American Journal of Botany&quot; determined that removal of the tongue does not affect prey biomass.

===Pollination===
A remaining mystery surrounding the cobra lily is its means of pollination. Its flower is unusually shaped and complex, typically a sign of a close pollinator-plant specialization. The flower is yellowish purple in color and grows on a stalk which is slightly taller than the pitcher leaves. It has five sepals, green in color, which are longer than the red-veined petals. It is generally expected that the pollinator is either a fly or bee attracted to the flower&#x27;s unpleasant smell or some nocturnal insect.

A new study suggests that it may be after observing a miner bee species (&quot;Andrena nigrihirta&quot;). Pollinating by hand yielded poor results, therefore, melittophilous seems likely considering the complexity of the fruit. According to the study, &quot;Observations of A. nigrihirta on flowers revealed that the shape and orientation of &quot;D. californica&quot;&#x27;s ovary and petals promote stigma contact both when pollinators enter and exit a flower, contrary to previous thought. Our findings provide evidence that &quot;D. californica&quot; is melittophilous&quot;. Furthermore, &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; was pollen-limited in all five plants observed. However, in the case of male absence, &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; was still able to reproduce suggesting that self pollination may play a role as well. It seems likely that both occur and only bolsters the reputation of hardiness in the wild.

==Infraspecific taxa==
Two infraspecific taxa are recognized:

*&quot;D. californica&quot; f. &quot;californica&quot; 
*&quot;D. californica&quot; f. &quot;viridiflora&quot; 

==Cultivation==

&quot;Darlingtonia californica&quot; can be a difficult carnivorous plant to keep in cultivation, as they require specific environmental conditions. They prefer cool to warm day-time temperatures and cold or cool night-time temperatures. Cobra lilies typically grow in bogs or streambanks that are fed by cold mountain water, and grow best when the roots are kept cooler than the rest of the plant. It is best to mimic these conditions in cultivation, and water the plants with cold, purified water. On hot days, it helps to place ice cubes of purified water on the soil surface. They prefer sunny conditions if in a humid, warm location, and prefer part-shade if humidity is low or fluctuates often. Plants can adapt to low humidity conditions, but optimum growth occurs under reasonable humidity.
Growing cobra lilies from seed is extremely slow and cobra seedlings are difficult to maintain, so these plants are best propagated from the long stolons they grow in late winter and spring. When a minute cobra plant is visible at the end of the stolon (usually in mid to late spring), the whole stolon may be cut into sections a few inches long, each with a few roots attached. Lay these upon cool, moist, shredded long-fibered sphagnum moss and place in a humid location with bright light. In many weeks, cobra plants will protrude from each section of stolon.
Like many other carnivorous plants of temperate regions, cobra lilies require a cold winter dormancy in order to live long-term. Plants die down to their rhizomes in frigid winters and will maintain their leaves in cool winters during their dormancy period. This period lasts from 3 to 5 months during the year, and all growth stops. As spring approaches, mature plants may send up a single, nodding flower, and a few weeks later the plant will send up a few large pitchers. The plant will continue to produce pitchers throughout the summer, however much smaller than the early spring pitchers.

Many carnivorous plant enthusiasts have succeeded in cultivating these plants, and have developed or discovered three color morphs: all green, all red, and red-green bicolor.

Wild-type plants are all green in moderate light and bicolor in intense sunlight.

<text>Alan Ross Meurant (born 26 August 1947) is a New Zealand public figure, now Honorary Consul for Morocco, who has at various times gained public attention as a police officer, businessman, politician, and political lobbyist.

==Early life and family==
Meurant was born on 26 August 1947 at Te Kōpuru, the son of Rae-Ola Dalice Meurant (née Olsen) and Edward Alan Meurant. He was educated at Dargaville High School. In 1973, he married Patricia Ann Lewis, and the couple had two children before separating.

== Police ==
Meurant served in the New Zealand Police between 1966 and 1987. In 1975 he was promoted to Sergeant at Takapuna on the North Shore, married Patricia and purchased a home. He had his first pangs to be a Member of Parliament, and as he decided he needed more education to enter political life he enrolled for a BA degree intending to major in political studies. After 2½ years he went back to Auckland Central as Senior Sergeant. He spent eight years at the University of Auckland, finishing a BA in 1982, and starting a law degree, though he then left to pursue business interests in his last years in the police.

He was a detective in the CIB between 1970 and 1975, having worked on the famous case of the murders of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe, helping in the search for cartridge cases, and a member of the Armed Offenders Squad. During the controversial 1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand, he was second-in-command of one of the riot units, Red Squad. He subsequently wrote a book about the experience of Red Squad: &quot;The Red Squad Story&quot;. The book was a bestseller in both New Zealand and South Africa.

When Meurant was transferred to night shift work in 1982 after (he says) offending some senior officers he had criticised in his book &quot;The Red Squad Story&quot;, he studied at night to complete his BA degree and start a law degree. He also started dabbling in business opportunities by running a private security firm from the watchhouse, with his wife as principal partner, and employing up to 70 people. After being commissioned in 1985, he served in various roles including Inspector in charge of the Auckland police criminal intelligence unit. In 1989 he published an autobiography: &quot;The Beat to the Beehive&quot;.

In 1980, Meurant received the New Zealand Police Long Service and Good Conduct Medal.

==Member of Parliament==


Meurant stood as the National Party candidate for Hobson in the 1987 election. He was successful and went on to serve 3 parliamentary terms. In 1996, his electorate was abolished when the introduction of the MMP proportional voting replaced the FPTP system. Faced with being a list MP, Meurant chose instead to form a new political party and had the distinction of being the first person to register a political party under the new regime.

In 1990, Meurant was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal.

===Conservative Party===
After quitting the National Party, Meurant established a new party known as Right of Centre (later rebranded as the New Zealand Conservative Party). This party was based on his right-wing economic philosophy: selling government assets and reducing government involvement in business. On 7 September 1994, Meurant entered into a formal agreement with Prime Minister Jim Bolger. At that time, Meurant was a member of the executive: the Undersecretary of Agriculture and Forestry. After forming his own party, Meurant retained his executive office and continued to be a member of the Cabinet Committees for Commerce, Industry and Environment and Treaty Issues. Support of government on confidence and supply was central to Meurant&#x27;s continuation as a member of The Executive.

In August 1995, Meurant refused to comply with a directive from the Prime Minister to relinquish a position that he had as a director of a Russian-owned bank (PROK) domiciled in Vanuatu and was subsequently dismissed from the Executive. Meurant nevertheless continued as a coalition partner of the government as his support at the time was critical to its survival.

Meurant completed a Master of Public Policy at Victoria University of Wellington during his third term in parliament. Contrary to the public perception of him being conservative, while an MP, he voted for gay rights and abortion on demand and also voted against the death penalty. He was also very liberal in regard to drug policy. In his autobiography he wrote: &quot;Perhaps we may liken drug prohibition to the era of liquor prohibition in America ... which created an underworld whose legacy lingers today. If drug use was legal in this country would there be any significant increase in drug use? I think not. Perhaps 50 percent of all crime in New Zealand is drug related. Think of the police resources we would save if we didn’t have to contend with all this drug-related crime. If it was legal to obtain and use drugs in this country, perhaps we could spend the money saved in policing expenditure, running educative programmes and medical clinics to assist those who lack the strength to resist temptation. If drugs such as cannabis and heroin were available through government dispensing stores, perhaps the black market trade which stimulates all this drug-relate trade would recede.&quot;

==After leaving parliament==
After leaving Parliament, Meurant was elected onto the Rodney District Council in 1998. However, his time with the Rodney District Council was short-lived: the entire council was dissolved by the Minister of Local Government after an acrimonious relationship between the general manager and Meurant culminated in a split within the council.

Between 1999 and 2004 Meurant was engaged by parliamentary services as a part-time adviser on agriculture, forestry, fishing and racing taxation policy to Winston Peters, leader of New Zealand First. During this period Meurant was a shareholding director of Digital Global Maps Limited, in which the principal shareholder was Vela Fishing. He also co-owned a thoroughbred horse agistment facility.

In 2002, Meurant was convicted of impersonating police, common assault and inconsiderate driving following an altercation with a truck driver on the Desert Road.

His business relationship with Philip Vela (Vela Fishing) as a director of Digital Global Maps Ltd and as a consultant to Peter Simunovich (Simunovich Fishing) ensured a high public profile. By the early 21st century, he was catapulted into national headlines during the &quot;Scampi scandal&quot; (2003–2009), which included allegations ranging from misreporting of fish catch totals by fishing companies as a mechanism to qualify for bigger allocations of privatised fish assets to allegations of large sums of money being directed from fishing magnates to Winston Peters by Meurant. In 2003 the Primary Industries Select Committee conducted an enquiry into allegations of impropriety involving the principals of Simunovich Fisheries Ltd, Winston Peters and Meurant. After an extensive investigation the allegations were rejected as unfounded and untrue. Contemporaneously, defamation proceedings against TVNZ and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; were commenced by Simunovich Fisheries. In December 2009 the defendants capitulated and apologised, and reportedly settled for $15 million damages payment. During the 2008 general election Meurant was linked to large donations allegedly transferred from Vela Fishing and other magnates to New Zealand First – the political Party led by Winston Peters, a former National Party colleague of Meurant.

In November 2012, Meurant was elected to the inaugural board of Focus NZ, as Vice-President, a New Zealand list-only political party aimed at the rural sector and primary industry producers and exporters.

2013 Published two novels based on real life: The Syrian Connection – which exposes American interference in transfer of money for non-sanctioned exports and how a Kiwi and Russian KGB agent subverted the blockade. Sex, Power &amp; Politics draws on the author&#x27;s exposure to a culture in New Zealand parliament.

In July 2016, Meurant was appointed Honorary Consul for the Kingdom of Morocco at the Honorary Consulate office in Auckland, New Zealand.

In February 2018, he was elected to the Electorate Executive Committee of Hon Judith Collins, NZ National Party Member of Parliament. He travelled to the Southern Provinces of Morocco Western Sahara with Collins&#x27; husband to look at business opportunities. He was a member of the Executive for 12 months, deciding not to stand for re-selection in 2019. Meurant also decided not to renew his National Party membership at the same time.

Meurant stood for the Gisborne mayoralty in the 2019 New Zealand local elections. Of the three candidates, he came last.

In March 2020, Meurant launched his third novel: &quot;Out of the Inferno&quot;. It&#x27;s about how the adult lives of three childhood friends collide: one becomes a ruthless detective inspector; another a corrupt politician and the third, a gang member.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, Meurant joined several businessmen and former politicians including former National and ACT leader Don Brash in establishing a company called Covax-NZR Limited to import Russia&#x27;s untested Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V) vaccine into the country. By late August 2020, they had submitted paperwork through the Russian Embassy to establish supply and distribution arrangements to import the vaccine.

== Concerns about police culture ==
In 2011, Meurant was interviewed in the documentary &quot;Operation 8&quot;, which was strongly critical of the anti-terror raids in Ruatoki in 2007. In it, he described the negative aspects of police culture and the actions that stemmed from it.

In Sept 2011, Meurant penned a damning critique of the NZ police in &quot;North &amp; South&quot; magazine. The article describes police culture in disparaging terms likening it to a forest in which new recruits get lost. Meurant discusses a number of well known cases such as the Crewe murders and says it was more than just a couple of detectives on the case who were corrupt. He says that planting of a cartridge in the Crewe&#x27;s garden was condoned by police management at the time. He makes the case that some officers are willing to break the law in a misguided belief that the end justifies the means and the means &quot;is best decided by you and others in your sub culture of police, for what better epitomises the values of a decent society than those cherished by the men and women in blue?&quot; He also wrote &quot;Too many loose ends to ignore Crewe case&quot; in which he states: &quot;It is my view that the police then, as they do now, suffer greatly from the misconception that preservation of the police is more important than preservation of the rule of law.&quot;

Another critique of police sub culture was published in &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot;, titled &quot;Deep in the Forest&quot; in which he wrote: Meurant also penned &quot;Officers in charge of weapons culpable&quot; in which he discussed the police shooting of Stephen John Bellingham in Christchurch after Bellingham was attacking cars with a hammer. &quot;Based on what I knew of the incident I do not believe police were justified in shooting to kill.&quot;

Meurant also wrote a column &quot;Urewera trial shows the cops have been getting it wrong&quot;. in which he criticised the police for the raids of October 2007 in which 17 people were arrested – allegedly as terrorists. Most of the charges were dropped four years later. Meurant believes the police abrogated the basic legal rights of defendants to &quot;no detention without charge&quot; and &quot;to be taken before a court as soon as possible&quot;.

<text>George Thorndike Angell (June 5, 1823March 16, 1909) was an American lawyer, philanthropist, and activist. He advocated for animal welfare, founding and serving as president of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. He also championed public health reform and opposed food adulteration.

==Biography==

George Thorndike Angell was born in Southbridge, Massachusetts, graduated from Dartmouth College in 1846, studied law at the Harvard Law School, and in 1851 was admitted to the bar in Boston, where he practiced for many years.

While attending horse races in 1866 he witnessed two horses being run to death. Motivated by this incident and inspired by the work of Henry Bergh in New York, his advocacy for the humane treatment of animals became a lifelong passion.

In 1868 Angell founded and became president of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, in the same year establishing and becoming editor of &quot;Our Dumb Animals&quot;, a journal for the promotion of organized effort in securing the humane treatment of animals. For many years he was active in the organization of humane societies in England and America.

In 1882, Angell and the Rev. Thomas Timmins initiated the movement to establish Bands of Mercy (for the promotion of humane treatment of animals), of which in 1908 there were more than 72,000 chapters in active existence. In 1889 he founded and became president of the American Humane Education Society.

Angell also became well known as an advocate of laws for the safeguarding of the public health and against food adulteration.

==Death==

After suffering from failing health for a long time, Angell died at his apartments at the Hotel Westminster in Boston on March 16, 1909, at the age of 85. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, between Cambridge and Watertown.

<text>Hisarya ( , also known as &quot;Hisar&quot;, &quot;Hissar&quot; or &quot;Hissarya&quot;, formerly: Toplitsa) is a small town and a major spa resort in Plovdiv Province, central Bulgaria. The town is located at the southern foothills of the Sredna Gora mountain range facing the Upper Thracian Plain.

Hisar means &#x27;fort, castle&#x27; in Arabic. The word was adopted in Persian and Ottoman Turkish.

==History==
The town was founded thousands of years ago probably on account of its hot springs. Some prehistoric remains have been found in what is now the town centre. Later, it became a Thracian city and, when Thrace fell to the Romans and became a Roman province, Hisarya became a Roman town — one of the three most important towns in the province. At times it was called Augusta, Diocletianopolis (after emperor Diocletian), and a couple of other names. It was a famous resort even in those times, which is proved by the fact that emperor Septimius Severus visited the city.

Many Roman ruins are visible everywhere — public buildings, a small amphitheatre, the barracks of the Roman garrison, the foundations of a couple of the oldest churches in Bulgaria, as well as the best-preserved Roman city walls in Bulgaria. The southern gate is known as &quot;The Camels&quot;, because it had broken in the middle and looked like two camels facing each other, before it was partially restored in the early 20th century.

In medieval times it was known as Sebastopolis and, later on, as Alexiopolis or Neokastron.

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the prosperous city declined. When it was included within the borders of Bulgaria, it was just a minor fortified town. During the Turkish rule, it further declined and, at some point, the once-prosperous city was just a couple of small houses in the midst of many Roman ruins, which peasants from the nearby villages used for a stone quarry, destroying most of them in the process.

After the liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Hisarya was included in the province of Eastern Rumelia; in 1885 it became a part of Bulgaria.

It prospered once again when the mineral springs were rediscovered and the place became a popular recreation spot.

After Bulgaria joined EU in 2007 various financing programs were used to recover the ancient ruins and renovate the park and street infrastructure, which recreates the town intensively and constantly and turns it again into a real gem of the Bulgarian spa, nature and historic heritage. The century-old trees in the parks, which are the habitat of numerous bird species, the renovated new modern large spa hotel centres with sport, spa and recreation areas and the brand new cosy luxurious smaller hotels and affordable guesthouses turn Hisarya again into a preferred resort for relaxation, health recovery, illness treatment and loved place for business seminars and events for foreign and Bulgarian visitors.

==Honour==
Hisarya Cove in Smith Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Hisarya.

<doc id="1067297" wikidata="Q2763244" url="?curid=1067297" title="Nirupa Roy">
<text>Nirupa Roy (born Kokila Kishorechandra Bulsara; 4 January 1931 – 13 October 2004) was an Indian actress who had appeared in Hindi films. Noted for her portrayals of tragedy and sorrow, Roy was known for her acting ability, and was uncharitably called the &quot;Queen of Misery&quot; in Hindi film circles. Roy was active from 1946 to 1999, and was best known for playing motherly roles. Roy appeared in over 250 films, and won three Filmfare Awards throughout her career, as well as being nominated for one. In 2004, Roy received the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award.

==Early life==
Roy was born as Kokila Kishorechandra Bulsara in Kalwada, Valsad, Gujarat. She married Kamal Roy at the age of 15, and moved to Mumbai. She used her married name Nirupa Roy when she entered the film industry.

== Career ==

In 1946, Roy and her husband responded to an advertisement in a Gujarati paper looking for actors. She was selected and started her acting career with the Gujarati film &quot;Ranakdevi&quot; (1946). The same year she acted in her first Hindi film &quot;Amar Raj&quot;. One of her popular films was &quot;Do Bigha Zamin&quot; (1953). She largely played mythological characters in the films of the 1940s and 50s. In Har Har Mahadev she played the role of Parvati Devi opposite Trilok Kapoor who played the role of Shiva and the film was the top grosser of the year. Her image of a goddess was very strong and people would visit her home and seek her blessings. Among her co-stars were Trilok Kapoor (with whom she played in eighteen movies), Bharat Bhushan, Balraj Sahni, and Ashok Kumar.

In the 1970s, her role as mother to the characters played by Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor made her name synonymous to the impoverished suffering mother. Her role in &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975) and its dialogues with reference to a mother and son are used as clichés.

== Personal life ==
In her marriage with Kamal Roy, she had two children, named Yogesh and Kiran Roy. In the years following her death, they engaged into a dispute over Roy&#x27;s property and belongings, which has received much attention throughout news and media.

== Death ==
On 13 October 2004, Roy suffered a cardiac arrest in Mumbai, and died at the age of 73.

Several tributes and articles have been made in Roy&#x27;s memory. Her dialogues from the film &quot;Deewaar&quot; became iconic, and her acting in the film along with her other notable films are considered to be a landmark in Hindi cinema.
