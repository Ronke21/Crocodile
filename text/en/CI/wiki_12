<text>The &#x27; (NZZ&quot;&quot;&#x27;; &quot;New Journal of Zürich&quot;) is a Swiss, German-language daily newspaper, published by NZZ Mediengruppe in Zürich. The paper was founded in 1780. It has a reputation as a high-quality newspaper, as the Swiss-German newspaper of record, and for detailed reports on international affairs.

==History and profile==

One of the oldest newspapers still published, it originally appeared as &quot;Zürcher Zeitung&quot;, edited by the Swiss painter and poet Salomon Gessner, on 12 January 1780. It was renamed in 1821.

According to Peter K. Buse and Jürgen C. Doerr, many prestige German language newspapers followed its example because it set &quot;standards through an objective, in-depth treatment of subject matter, eloquent commentary, an extensive section on entertainment, and one on advertising.&quot;

Aside from the switch from its blackletter typeface in 1946, the newspaper has changed little since the 1930s. Only in 2005 did it add color pictures, much later than most mainstream papers. The emphasis is on international news, business, finance, and high culture. Features and lifestyle stories are kept to a minimum.

Historically, the newspaper has been politically positioned close to the liberal Free Democratic Party of Switzerland since its early period. The paper&#x27;s official statutes and guidelines declare it to have a &quot;liberal democratic foundation&quot;. Accordingly, it has traditionally adopted a free-market liberal and centre-right orientation. However, in 2014, Markus Somm (formerly an editor at the Basler Zeitung), a more pronounced right-wing journalist, was slated to became editor-in-chief, leading to fears of a rightward shift by staff and resulting in internal protest. The internal upheaval eventually lead to Somm not taking on his role. However, the appointment of Eric Gujer as editor-in-chief in 2015 and René Scheu as head of the feature section in 2016, as well as almost half of all contributing editors leaving the newspaper between 2015 and December 2017, marked a noticeable shift to the right, according to critics. 

==Circulation==
The circulation of was 18,100 copies in 1910. It rose to 47,500 copies in 1930 and 66,600 copies in 1950.

In 1997, the had a circulation of 162,330 copies. Its circulation was 169,000 copies in 2000. The circulation of the paper was 166,000 copies in 2003. The 2006 circulation of the paper was 146,729 copies. Its circulation was 139,732 copies in 2009. In 2010, the paper had a circulation of 136,894 copies.

===Weekend edition===
In 2002, the newspaper launched a weekend edition, &quot;NZZ am Sonntag&quot; (&quot;NZZ on Sunday&quot;). The weekend edition has its own editorial staff and contains more soft news and lifestyle issues than its weekday counterpart, as do most Swiss weekend newspapers. Its circulation was 121,204 copies in 2006.

&quot;NZZ am Sonntag&quot; was awarded the European Newspaper of the Year in the category of weekly newspaper by the European Newspapers Congress in 2012.

===Archives===
In 2005, the complete run of the newspaper&#x27;s first 225 years was scanned from microfilm. A total of two million images comprising seventy terabytes, and its Blackletter type was scanned using optical character recognition at a total cost of €600,000 (or €0.30 per image). The result is a searchable digital archive, accessible online by subscribers and publicly on site in Zurich.

The digitization was carried out by an institute of the German research organization Fraunhofer Society the Institute for Media Communication (since 2006, the ), headquartered in Sankt Augustin, North Rhine-Westphalia.

<doc id="1046971" wikidata="Q231595" url="?curid=1046971" title="Sylvia Sidney">
<text>Sylvia Sidney (born Sophia Kosow; August 8, 1910 – July 1, 1999) was an American stage, screen, and film actress whose career spanned 70 years. She rose to prominence in dozens of leading roles in the 1930s. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams&quot; in 1973. She later gained attention for her role as Juno, a case worker in the afterlife, in Tim Burton&#x27;s 1988 film &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, for which she won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.

== Early life==
Sidney was born Sophia Kosow in the Bronx, New York, the daughter of Rebecca (née Saperstein), a Romanian Jew, and Victor Kosow, a Russian-Jewish immigrant who worked as a clothing salesman. Her parents divorced by 1915, and she was adopted by her stepfather Sigmund Sidney, a dentist. Her mother became a dressmaker and renamed herself Beatrice Sidney. Now using the surname Sidney, Sylvia became an actress at the age of 15 as a way of overcoming shyness. As a student of the Theater Guild&#x27;s School for Acting, she was praised by theater critics for her performances. In 1926, she made her first film appearance as an extra in D.W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;The Sorrows of Satan&quot;.

==Career==

During the Depression, Sidney appeared in a string of films, often playing working-class heroines, or the girlfriend or sister of a gangster. She appeared with Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Fredric March, George Raft and Cary Grant. Among her films from this period were: &quot;An American Tragedy&quot;, &quot;City Streets&quot;, and &quot;Street Scene&quot; (all 1931), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Sabotage&quot; and Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Fury&quot; (both 1936), &quot;You Only Live Once&quot; and &quot;Dead End&quot; (both 1937), and &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot;, an early three-strip Technicolor film. During this period, she developed a reputation for being difficult to work with.
At the time of making &quot;Sabotage&quot; with Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney was one of the highest-paid actresses in the industry, earning $10,000 per week—earning a total of $80,000 for &quot;Sabotage&quot;.

Sidney&#x27;s career diminished somewhat during the 1940s. In 1949, exhibitors voted her &quot;box-office poison&quot;. In 1952, she played the role of Fantine in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and although the film itself did not meet the studio&#x27;s expectations, Sidney received critical praise for her performance.
Sidney appeared three times on &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;. On May 16, 1957, she appeared as Lulu Morgan, mother of singer Helen Morgan in &quot;The Helen Morgan Story&quot;. Four months later, Sidney rejoined her former co-star Bergen on the premiere of the short-lived &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;. She also worked in television during the 1960s on such programs as &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, and &quot;My Three Sons&quot;.

In 1973, Sidney received an Academy Award nomination for her supporting role in &quot;Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams&quot;. As an elderly woman, Sidney continued to play supporting screen roles, and was identifiable by her husky voice, the result of cigarette smoking. She was the formidable Miss Coral in the film version of &quot;I Never Promised You a Rose Garden&quot; and later was cast as Aidan Quinn&#x27;s grandmother in the television production of &quot;An Early Frost&quot; where she spoke the memorable line &quot;AIDS is a disease, not a disgrace!&quot; and for which she won a Golden Globe Award. She played Aunt Marion in &quot;&quot; and had key roles in &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (directed by longtime Sidney fan Tim Burton), for which she won a Saturn Award, and &quot;Used People&quot;. Her final role was in &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot;, another film by Burton, in which she played an elderly woman whose beloved records by Slim Whitman help stop an alien invasion from Mars.

On television, she appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; as the imperious owner of the radio station, and she appeared in a memorable episode of &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; as Melissa&#x27;s tough grandmother, who wanted to leave her granddaughter the family dress business, though Melissa wanted a career as a photographer. Sidney also appeared at the beginning of each episode as the crotchety travel clerk on the short-lived late-1990s revival of &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;. She also was featured on &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;; &quot;The Love Boat&quot;; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; Diagnosis Murder; and &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;

Her Broadway career spanned five decades, from her debut performance as a graduate of the Theatre Guild School in June 1926 at age 15, in the three-act fantasy &quot;Prunella&quot; to the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Vieux Carré&quot; in 1977. Other stage credits included &quot;The Fourposter&quot;, &quot;Enter Laughing&quot;, and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. In 1982, Sidney was awarded the George Eastman Award by George Eastman House for distinguished contribution to the art of film.

== Personal life ==
Sidney was married three times, first to publisher Bennett Cerf on October 1, 1935; they divorced on April 9, 1936. She married actor and acting teacher Luther Adler in 1938, by whom she had her only child, a son Jacob (&quot;Jody&quot;; 1939–1987), who died of ALS 12 years before his mother. Adler and Sidney divorced in 1946. On March 5, 1947, she married radio producer Carlton Alsop; roughly four years later, attorney Melvin Belli assisted Sidney in her divorce suit, brought on grounds of extreme cruelty. Waiving any alimony request and seeking only restoration of her maiden name, Sidney was granted the decree and the divorce was finalized on July 24, 1951. 

A Democrat, Sidney supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign during the 1952 presidential election.

She published two books on the art of needlepoint, and raised and showed pug dogs.

== Death ==
Sidney died on July 1, 1999 from oesophageal cancer at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan at age 88.

<text>Speedwell Cavern is one of the four show caves in Castleton, Derbyshire, England.

The cave system consists of a horizontal lead miners&#x27; adit (a level passageway driven horizontally into the hillside) below ground leading to the cavern itself, a limestone cave. The narrow adit is permanently flooded, so after descending a long staircase, access to the cave is made by boat. At the end of the adit, the cavern opens up with fluorspar veins, stalactites and stalagmites, and the so-called &quot;Bottomless Pit&quot;. This chamber has an underground lake with a high waterfall and an extremely deep vertical shaft, now choked to within of the surface by rock spoil dumped by miners, after driving the continuation of the canal to the natural streamway beyond, which provided the bulk of the water for the canal. The original depth of the shaft has been estimated, from the amount of spoil placed in the shaft over the years, at around .

The mine was developed in the 1770s but the limited lead ore deposits meant that it was not profitable and it was closed down by 1790.

At the foot of Winnats Pass, it is a tourist attraction with an underground boat trip to the cavern. Originally the guide propelled the boat by pushing against the walls with his hands, later the boat was legged through, and now it is powered by an electric motor.

A connection was discovered in 2006 between the Speedwell Cavern system and Titan, the largest natural shaft in the UK, which is high.

<text>The Evening Express is a daily local newspaper serving the city of Aberdeen, Scotland.

==History==

It was first published in November 1879. It was a tabloid during the 1930s to the 1950s until it resumed as a broadsheet in November 1958, six days a week. By September 1989, The Saturday edition returned to a tabloid with the broadsheet formula during the weekdays. It became a tabloid six days a week in February 1995.

There was also a Saturday night paper called the Green Final which ended in June 2002 after many years in which it was printed on green paper instead of the usual white. It showed progress on how Aberdeen FC did in their matches as well as a full check on the day&#x27;s football results. For many years, the Green Final was a broadsheet until it became a tabloid from 1988 till the end. The name occasionally reappears when the paper features junior football reports.

To celebrate its 40,000th edition, the &quot;Evening Express&quot; held a competition for one of its readers to win 40,000 one penny pieces – totaling £400.

In November 2021, the &quot;Evening Expres&quot;s website was merged with the existing Press and Journal website.

==Publication and circulation==

The paper along with the &quot;Press and Journal&quot; is published by Aberdeen Journals Ltd. It has a circulation of 10,117.

==Columnists==
Moreen Simpson, Scott Begbie the entertainments editor, former Grampian TV presenter Frank Gilfeather. In the Weekend section, every Saturday, TV critic Ewan Cameron gives his rundown on the week&#x27;s programmes.

&quot;Evening Express&quot; Sports Editor Charlie Allan, Former Aberdeen F.C. footballers Stewart McKimmie and Joe Harper have columns in the sport pages. Another former Don Willie Miller has recently joined them. Sports reporter Sean Wallace also has a weekly column.

==Coverage of Trump International Golf Links controversy==
The paper was a staunch supporter of the building of a highly controversial golf resort by Donald Trump at the Menie Estate in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire. The development was against the wishes of many local residents, and on an area designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. In 2007, the &quot;Evening Express&quot; ran pictures of seven councillors who voted against the application under the headline &quot;You Traitors&quot;. 2009, the newspaper announced it would not report anything said by the protest group &quot;Tripping Up Trump&quot;, saying it was not &quot;bona fide&quot;. In contrast, opponents complained, the DC Thomson papers in Aberdeen, the &quot;Evening Express&quot; and the &quot;Press and Journal&quot; gave a large amount of positive press to Donald Trump and the real estate development. In 2013, &quot;Press and Journal&quot; editor Damian Bates, who was formerly editor at the &quot;Evening Express&quot;, married the executive vice president and press spokeswoman for the Trump International project.

==Fallout with Aberdeen Football Club players==
As of 29 February 2008 the players of Aberdeen Football Club stated that they would no longer give interviews to the &quot;Evening Express&quot;. The players cited perceived negative reporting on the part of the paper as their reason for the move. Sports Editor Charlie Allan proposed a meeting with Scott Severin, but this was declined by the captain. Allan instead met with club media officer Dave Macdermid, who gave a short interview to the &quot;Evening Express&quot;.

Aberdeen FC manager Jimmy Calderwood did not observe the silence of his players, saying that he felt the players had made a mistake in ceasing to communicate with the &quot;Evening Express&quot;. He did however state, as did Macdermid, that the players had taken particular offence to the paper&#x27;s speculation that a number of them would be leaving the club in the summer. Calderwood said that the &quot;Evening Express&quot; had been &quot;naughty&quot; to do so.

In early March the ban on giving interviews to the &quot;Evening Express&quot; was lifted, and the players resumed normal communications with the paper.

<doc id="1046985" wikidata="Q736140" url="?curid=1046985" title="Battle of Öland">
<text>The Battle of Öland was a naval battle between an allied Danish-Dutch fleet and the Swedish navy in the Baltic Sea, off the east coast of Öland on 1 June 1676. The battle was a part of the Scanian War (1675–79) fought for supremacy over the southern Baltic. Sweden was in urgent need of reinforcements for its north German possessions; Denmark sought to ferry an army to Scania in southern Sweden to open a front on Swedish soil.

Just as the battle began, the Swedish flagship &quot;Kronan&quot; sank, taking with it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force under the leadership of the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz&#x27;s sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship &quot;Svärdet&quot; battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.

The battle resulted in Danish naval supremacy, which was upheld throughout the war. The Danish King Christian V was able to ship troops over to the Swedish side of the Sound, and on 29 June a force of 14,500 men landed at Råå, just south of Helsingborg in southernmost Sweden. Scania became the main battleground of the war, culminating with the bloody battles of Lund, Halmstad and Landskrona. Danish and Dutch naval forces were left free to raze Öland and the Swedish east coast all the way up to Stockholm. The Swedish failure at Öland also prompted King Charles XI to order a commission to investigate the fiasco, but in the end no one was found responsible.

==Background==
In the 1660s, Sweden reached its height as a European great power. It had recently defeated Denmark, one of its main competitors for hegemony in the Baltic, in the Torstenson War (1643–45) and the Dano-Swedish War (1657–58). At the Treaties of Brömsebro (1645) and Roskilde (1658), Denmark was forced to cede the islands of Gotland and Ösel, all of its eastern territories on the Scandinavian Peninsula, and parts of Norway. In a third war, from 1658 to 1660, King Charles X of Sweden attempted to finish off Denmark for good. The move was in part due to bold royal ambition, but also a result of Sweden&#x27;s being a highly militarized society geared for almost constant warfare, a fiscal-military state. Disbanding the Swedish forces meant settling outstanding pay, so there was an underlying incentive to keep hostilities alive and let soldiers live off enemy lands and plunder. In the end, the renewed attack failed with interventions by the leading naval powers of England and the Dutch Republic. Charles&#x27; plans to subdue Denmark were thwarted and Trøndelag and Bornholm were returned to Denmark in the Treaty of Copenhagen in 1660 while Sweden was allowed to keep the rest of its recent conquests.

Charles X died in February 1660 and was succeeded by a regency council—led by the queen mother Hedvig Eleonora—that ruled in the name of Charles XI who was only four at the time of his father&#x27;s death. Sweden had come close to almost complete control over trade in the Baltic, but the war revealed the need to work against the formation of anti-Swedish alliances that included Denmark, especially with France, the most powerful state in Europe at the time. There were some successes in foreign policy with the anti-French 1668 Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic.

While the Swedish policy was to avoid war and to consolidate its gains, Danish policy after 1660 was to seek an opportunity to regain its losses. Under the Oldenburg King Frederick III, the foreign policy was aimed at isolating Sweden while setting itself up in a favorable position in future wars. Denmark attempted to position itself in the alliances among the 17th century Europe great powers. Bourbon France and the Habsburg-dominated Holy Roman Empire competed for continental domination while the Dutch Republic and England fought several wars over naval hegemony. At the same time, Denmark sought to rid itself of the generous toll treaties it was forced to grant Dutch merchants after the Republic&#x27;s assistance in the wars against Sweden. Attempts were made to ally with both England and France, but without success. In the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–66) Denmark had to side with the Dutch at the Battle of Vågen, souring its relations with England. In 1670 France allied with England against the Republic. Sweden&#x27;s relations with France had improved greatly and in 1672 it joined the Anglo-French coalition, pushing Denmark into the Dutch camp.

In 1672, French King Louis XIV launched an attack on the Dutch Republic, igniting the Franco-Dutch War. The attack was opposed by the Holy Roman Empire led by Leopold I. In 1674, Sweden was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic&#x27;s northern German allies. France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies only on the condition that it moved in force on Brandenburg. A Swedish army of around 22,000 men under Carl Gustaf Wrangel advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Sweden had enjoyed since the Thirty Years&#x27; War and emboldened its enemies. By September 1675, Denmark, the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Empire and Spain were all joined in war against Sweden and its ally France.

===Scanian War===
With the declaration of war against Sweden on 2 September 1675, Denmark saw a chance to regain its recently lost eastern provinces. The southern Baltic became an important strategic theatre for both Denmark and Sweden. Denmark needed the sea lanes to invade Scania, and Sweden needed to reinforce Swedish Pomerania on the Baltic coast; both stood to gain by taking control of the Baltic trade routes. As war broke out between Denmark and Sweden a strong naval presence also became essential for Sweden to secure its interests at home and overseas.

In October 1675 the Swedish fleet under Gustaf Otto Stenbock put to sea, but sailed no further than Stora Karlsö off Gotland before it had to turn back to Stockholm after less than two weeks, beset by cold and stormy weather, disease, and the loss of vital equipment. Stenbock, held personally responsible for the failure by King Charles XI, was forced to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket. During the winter of 1675–76 the Swedish fleet was placed under the command of Lorentz Creutz, who attempted to put to sea in January to February 1676, but was iced in by exceptionally cold weather.

==State of the fleets==
The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the development of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, decisive action in naval engagements had been achieved through boarding and melee, but after the middle of the 17th century tactical doctrine focused more on disabling or sinking an opponent through superior firepower from a distance. This entailed major changes in military doctrines, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored very large ships that could hold the line in the face of heavy fire, later known as ships of the line. The new tactics also depended on the ability of strong, centralized governments to maintain large, permanent fleets led by a professional officer corps. The increased power of the state at the expense of individual landowners led to the expansion of armies and navies, and in the late 1660s Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program.

In 1675, the Swedish fleet was numerically superior to its Danish counterpart (18 ships of the line against 16 and 21 frigates against 11), but it was older and of poorer quality than the Danish fleet, which had replaced a larger proportion of its vessels. The Swedes had problems with routine maintenance, and both rigging and sails were generally in poor condition. Swedish crews lacked the professionalism of Danish and Norwegian sailors, who commonly had valuable experience from service in the Dutch merchant navy, and the Swedish navy also lacked a core of professional officers. The Danish had seasoned veterans like Cort Adeler and Niels Juel. The Danish fleet was also reinforced with Dutch units under the command Philip van Almonde and Cornelis Tromp, the latter an experienced officer who had served under Michiel de Ruyter, famous for his skilled command during the Anglo-Dutch Wars.

==Prelude==

A Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel put to sea in March 1676, and on 29 April his forces landed on Gotland, which surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May with 23 warships of over 50 guns, 21 of less than 50 and 16 minor supporting vessels manned by about 12,000 men, but encountered adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then left Visby, the main port on Gotland, to join up with a smaller Danish-Dutch force at Bornholm, between the southern tip of Sweden and the northern coast of Germany. Together they intended to cruise between Scania and the island of Rügen to stop Swedish troops from landing on the island and reinforcing Swedish Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets fought the indecisive battle at Bornholm. The Swedish force was superior in numbers but was unable to inflict any serious losses, and two of the fleet&#x27;s fireships were captured, one by the allies and the other by a Brandenburg squadron headed for Copenhagen.
Several Swedish accounts say that Creutz argued with his officers after Bornholm. Major Taube of the &quot;Mars&quot; testified that after the battle, the officers had been &quot;scolded like boys&quot; and that Creutz, &quot;without regard for guilt or innocence, accused them almost all alike&quot;. The army captain Rosenberg told a later inquiry that Creutz &quot;almost had a paroxysm in the night&quot; over the conduct of Johan Bär (one of his flag officers) at Bornholm, and that he swore &quot;never to go to serve at sea with such rascals&quot;. Maritime archaeologist Lars Einarsson has concluded that the relationship between Creutz and his subordinates had hit rock bottom before the battle.

After the unsuccessful action the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg, where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to refuse combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. After the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May, the allied fleet soon came in contact with it and began pursuing the Swedes. By this time the allies had been reinforced by a small squadron and now totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large or medium ships of the line. The reinforcements also brought with them a new commander, Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the ablest naval tacticians of his time. Tromp, who also was a Lieutenant-Admiral in the Dutch navy, was made Admiral-General of the Danish navy on 8 May 1676. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the southern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The rough winds were hard on the Swedish ships. Many lost masts and spars. The Swedes, forming a barely cohesive battle line, tried to sail ahead of Tromp&#x27;s ships, hoping to get between them and the shore, thus putting themselves on the allied fleet&#x27;s windward side and gaining the tactical advantage of holding the weather gage. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail closer to the wind and faster than the rest of the force, and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, snatching the weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed on each other, and were soon within firing range.

==Battle==
Around noon, as a result of poor coordination and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship &quot;Kronan&quot; came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. &quot;Kronan&quot; quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.

The sudden loss of the flagship and the fleet admiral threw the already scattered Swedish line into confusion and sapped morale. Four ships from Creutz&#x27;s and Uggla&#x27;s squadrons immediately fled when they saw that the flagship was lost. Claes Uggla was next in command after Creutz and became the acting commander of the Swedish fleet. When the line came about, Uggla and his ship &quot;Svärdet&quot; came on a collision course with the still floating wreckage of &quot;Kronan&quot;, and were forced to jibe (turn the stern into the wind direction) to avoid it. &quot;Svärdet&quot;″s second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat, leading to major disorder. Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces, but instead was separated from his squadron.

Tromp on &quot;Christianus Quintus&quot;, Vice Admiral Jens Rodsten on &quot;Tre Løver&quot; and Niels Juel on &quot;Churprindsen&quot; took advantage of the chaos. They quickly surrounded &quot;Svärdet&quot; and three supporting ships (&quot;Hieronymus&quot;, &quot;Neptunus&quot; and &quot;Järnvågen&quot;, an armed merchantman) and began to hammer them into submission. Several other Swedish vessels attempted to assist Uggla, but they were in a lee position and could not provide effective support. After about an hour-and-a-half to two hours of hard fighting &quot;Svärdet&quot;″s mainmast went overboard and Uggla had to surrender to Tromp. Despite this, &quot;Svärdet&quot; was ignited by accident or misunderstanding by the Dutch fireship &quot;″t Hoen&quot;. The second largest Swedish ship after &quot;Kronan&quot; sank in the blaze and took with it 600 out of a crew of 650, including Admiral Uggla himself. Only &quot;Hieronymus&quot; escaped the assault by the allied admirals, though badly damaged, and the others were captured by Juel on &quot;Churprindsen&quot; together with one of his lieutenants on &quot;Anna Sophia&quot;.

By six o&#x27;clock in the evening the Swedes had lost two flagships along with two fleet admirals, including the supreme commander of the navy. The entire force now began a disorderly retreat: the smaller ships &quot;Enhorn&quot;, &quot;Ekorren&quot;, &quot;Gripen&quot; and &quot;Sjöhästen&quot; were outsailed and captured and the rest of the ships sought shelter in friendly harbors. Most set course for Dalarö, north of Stockholm; others tried for Kalmar Strait, between Öland and the Swedish mainland. The allied fleet tried to capitalize further on its victory by giving chase, but the dash up the coast had scattered its forces and there was disagreement among the Danish commanders on how far they should pursue the Swedish ships.

==Aftermath==

The Swedish fleet had suffered a major blow by losing its two largest ships, its commander-in-chief and one of its most experienced admirals. Even after the battle, the misfortunes continued. &quot;Äpplet&quot; came off its moorings at Dalarö, went aground and sank. Around fifty survivors were picked up by pursuing Danish ships and taken as prisoners to Copenhagen. The battle gave Denmark undisputed naval supremacy and the Swedish fleet did not dare to venture out for the rest of the year. The army that had been amassed in Denmark could now be shipped to Scania to take the war to Swedish soil and on 29 June 1676, 14,500 troops were landed at Råå south of Helsingborg. The Battle of Öland was the first major Swedish defeat at sea to Denmark and was followed by further Swedish defeats at Møn and Køge Bay in 1677. The latter was a resounding success for Admiral Niels Juel and has become the most celebrated victory in Danish naval history.

The Battle of Öland was the first of several major Swedish defeats at sea that ended in complete Danish dominance over the southern Baltic for the duration of the Scanian War. That the main naval base in Stockholm was locked in ice during the winter of 1675–76 showed the necessity of an ice-free harbor that was closer to Danish home waters. In 1679, King Charles personally chose the site for a new base at what would later become Karlskrona. The lessons from the war also led to improvements in Swedish naval organization under the guidance of Hans Wachtmeister (1641–1714) which included better funding and maintenance, increased readiness for mobilization in the southern Baltic and permanent recruitment of skilled personnel through the allotment system.

===Swedish commission===
Within a week, the news of the failure at Bornholm and the major defeat at Öland reached King Charles, who immediately ordered that a commission be set up to investigate what had happened. Charles wanted to see if Bär and other officers were guilty of cowardice or incompetence. On 13 June, the King wrote &quot;some of our sea officers have shown such cowardly and careless behavior&quot; that they have &quot;placed the safety, welfare and defense of the kingdom at great peril&quot;, and that &quot;such a serious crime should be severely punished&quot;.

The commission began its work on 7 June 1676. At the hearings, strong criticism surfaced and was directed against individual officers as well as Swedish conduct in general. Anders Homman, one of the officers on &quot;Svärdet&quot;, was among those who chastised his colleagues the hardest. In his testimony he said that Admiral Uggla had exclaimed &quot;look how those dog cunts run&quot; when he was surrounded, fighting the allied flagships. Homman himself described the actions of his colleagues as those of &quot;chickens running about the yard, each in his own direction&quot;, and added that he &quot;had been in seven battles, but had never seen our people fight so poorly&quot;.

The commission did not find anyone guilty of negligence or misconduct, but Lieutenant Admiral Bär, commander of &quot;Nyckeln&quot;, and Lieutenant Admiral Christer Boije, who had run aground on &quot;Äpplet&quot;, were never again given a command in the navy. Lieutenant Admiral Hans Clerck, commander of &quot;Solen&quot;, went through the process unscathed, and was promoted to full Admiral by the King before the commission even presented its verdict. Creutz has quite consistently been blamed for the loss of his ship by historians, and has been described as an incompetent sea officer and sailor who more or less single-handedly brought about the sinking through lack of naval experience. Military historians Lars Ericson Wolke and Olof Sjöblom have attempted to nuance the picture by pointing out that Creutz&#x27;s task was akin to that of an administrator rather than a military commander. The practical issues of ship maneuvering should have been the responsibility of his subordinates, who had experience in naval matters.

===Disputes among the allied officers===
Despite the victories, several allied officers were displeased with the conduct of their forces. Naval historian Jørgen Barfod explains that the battle was fought &quot;in a disorganized manner from beginning to end&quot; since Tromp had given the order for each commander to attack the enemy ship closest to him. Most of the Danish fleet was unable to keep pace with the faster Dutch ships, so the race for an advantageous position along the coast had contributed to the scattering of the allied fleet. Juel later complained in a letter to the Danish Admiral of the Realm that the Dutch had not assisted him in pursuing the fleeing Swedes. He claimed that if he had received proper support, they could have &quot;brought [the Swedes] such a fever on their throats that it would take years for all the doctors in Stockholm to cure it&quot;. When Tromp sent a report of the battle to the Danish King he reproached his subordinates, but not by name, and asked that no punishment be dealt out.

The captain of &quot;″t Hoen&quot;, the fireship that had set &quot;Svärdet&quot; ablaze after she had surrendered, was arrested and incarcerated directly after the battle, and was subjected to such harsh treatment that he died within a few days. Tromp later reported that his ship &quot;Delft&quot;, which had seen some of the roughest fighting, had lost around 100 men and that most of its officers were wounded.

<text>Richard Lowenstein (born 1 March 1959) is an Australian filmmaker. He has written, produced and directed feature films such as &quot;Strikebound&quot; (1984), &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; (1986) and &quot;He Died with a Felafel in His Hand&quot; (2001); music videos for bands such as INXS and U2; concert performance films, &quot;Australian Made: The Movie&quot; (1987) and &quot;U2: LoveTown&quot; (1989); TV adverts, and the documentaries &quot;We&#x27;re Livin&#x27; on Dog Food&quot; (2009), &quot;Autoluminescent&quot; (2011), &quot;Ecco Homo&quot; (2015) and &quot;&quot; (2019).

==Biography==
Richard Lowenstein was born on 1 March 1959 in Melbourne. His mother was the author, oral historian, and activist, Wendy Lowenstein (née Katherin Wendy Robertson, 1927–2006). His father is Werner Lowenstein, also an activist, who had fled Nazi Germany to United Kingdom and was relocated to Australia in 1940 as one of the &quot;Dunera&quot; boys. The couple married in July 1947; and had three children, Peter, Martie and Richard. Lowenstein attended Brinsley Road Community School from 1973 to 1974; and graduated from Swinburne Institute of Technology, Film and Television Department in 1979.

His short film, &quot;Evictions&quot; (1979), which won the Erwin Rado Prize – for Best Short Film – at the Melbourne International Film Festival the following year, described Melbourne during the Great Depression. It was based on his mother&#x27;s book, &quot;Weevils in the Flour&quot; (1978). The film detailed police evicting unemployed unionists. In 1980 Lowenstein directed a music video, &quot;Leap for Lunch&quot;, for the debut single by art punk band, The Ears – he shared a house with their lead singer, Sam Sejavka. In 1982 he directed one for &quot;Talking to a Stranger&quot;, a single by rock band, Hunters &amp; Collectors. He followed with &quot;Lumps of Lead&quot; for the same group and &quot;Fraction Too Much Friction&quot; for Tim Finn as his first solo single in 1983. At the &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards for 1983, he won Best Promotional Video for &quot;Fraction Too Much Friction&quot;.

In 1984 he directed his first feature film, &quot;Strikebound&quot;, a dramatisation of a 1930s coal miners strike, which he wrote based on his mother&#x27;s book, &quot;Dead Men Don&#x27;t Dig Coal&quot; (unpublished), and his own research into unionism in the industry. In June that year he directed his first music videos for INXS with &quot;Burn for You&quot;, and followed by &quot;All the Voices&quot; and &quot;Dancing on the Jetty&quot; (both in October). At the &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards for 1984 he won Best Promotional Video for &quot;Burn for You&quot;. He established a long term relationship with INXS and produced, edited or directed more of their music videos over subsequent years, including &quot;The Swing &amp; Other Stories: Collection of Contemporary Classics from INXS&quot; (1985), a VHS-format video compilation with additional interviews and documentary. At the &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards for 1985 he shared the award for Best Video for &quot;What You Need&quot; by INXS with Lyn-Marie Milbourn.

In 1985 he directed &quot;White City: The Music Movie&quot;, a 60-minute video, for former The Who guitarist, Pete Townshend. Geoffrey Giuliano in his book, &quot;Behind Blues Eyes: The Life of Pete Townshend&quot; (2002), described &quot;[T]he highlight of the video is the poolside staging of the electric &#x27;Face the Face&#x27;, in which director Richard Lowenstein effectively captures the excitement of a big-band performance and Townshend&#x27;s joyous jitterbugging ... in a gold lamé, forties-style tuxedo Lowenstein reveals more story line in these five minutes than the entire video&quot;. It was released with Townshend&#x27;s concept album, &quot;White City: A Novel&quot;, and included him discussing the music.

In 1986 he wrote and directed a feature film, &quot;Dogs in Space&quot;, which highlighted late-1970s Melbourne&#x27;s little band scene with the lead character Sam (portrayed by INXS&#x27; lead singer, Michael Hutchence) based on Lowenstein&#x27;s experiences with The Ear&#x27;s Sejavka. At the time, Sejavka was a member of new wave band, Beargarden, and objected to Lowenstein and Hutchence&#x27;s &quot;noxious caricature&quot; of his earlier personality. In 2009 SBS TV&#x27;s Peter Galvin described the movie as a &quot;cult classic&quot; and &quot;for its fans there&#x27;s never really been anything quite like [it], before or since&quot;. Lowenstein recalled the &quot;punk scene was an embarrassment to the Australian music industry back then. In a similar way, &quot;Dogs in Space&quot; was a total embarrassment to the Australian film industry because it preferred and knew how to handle innocuous candy-coated fare, like &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;&quot;.

For Irish group, U2, he has provided music videos – &quot;Desire&quot; and &quot;Angel of Harlem&quot; (both 1988) and a concert performance film, &quot;U2: LoveTown&quot; (1989). In 1991 he applied for funding from Film Finance Corporation Australia to adapt Robin Klein&#x27;s novel, &quot;Came Back to Show You I Could Fly&quot;, into the children&#x27;s film, &quot;Say a Little Prayer&quot;, which he directed in 1993. In 1999 he contributed a chapter, &quot;Telexes in Space: A Tale of Two Films&quot;, to the collection, &quot;Second Take: Australian Film-makers Talk&quot;, edited by Geoff Burton and Raffaele Caputo, which provides an explanation of his film-making style. Lowenstein co-produced the satirical music series &quot;John Safran&#x27;s Music Jamboree&quot; (2002) as well as &quot;John Safran vs God&quot; (2004) for SBS independent.

He is a partner in the Melbourne-based production company, Ghost Pictures. He is also a partner in the feature film production company, Fandango Australia Pty Ltd, along with Italian producer – Domenico Procacci, producer – Sue Murray, lawyer – Bryce Menzies and director – Rolf de Heer. He filmed the 2006 U2 concert at Melbourne&#x27;s Telstra Dome. In October 2009 Lowenstein was guest programmer on Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s TV music video show, &quot;rage&quot;.

<doc id="1046994" wikidata="Q7846597" url="?curid=1046994" title="Trout Fishing in America">
<text>Trout Fishing in America (1967) is a novella written by Richard Brautigan. It consists of short pieces linked by recurring characters.

Technically it is Brautigan&#x27;s first novel, as he completed it in 1961. But his book &quot;A Confederate General from Big Sur&quot; was published first.

==Overview==
&quot;Trout Fishing In America&quot; is an abstract book without a clear central storyline. Instead, the book contains a series of anecdotes broken into chapters, with the same characters often reappearing from story to story. The settings of most of the chapters occur in three locales: Brautigan&#x27;s childhood in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S.; his day-to-day adult life in San Francisco; and a camping trip in Idaho with his wife and infant daughter during the summer of 1961. Most of the chapters were written during this trip. An excerpt appeared as the lead piece in the &quot;Evergreen Review,&quot; Volume 7, No. 31 (Oct.–Nov. 1963).

The phrase &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; is used in various ways: it is the title of the book, a character, a hotel, the act of fishing itself, a modifier (one character is named &quot;Trout Fishing in America Shorty&quot;) and other things. Brautigan uses the theme of trout fishing as a point of departure for thinly veiled and often comical critiques of mainstream American society and culture. Several symbolic objects, such as a mayonnaise jar, a Ben Franklin statue in San Francisco&#x27;s Washington Square and trout, reappear throughout the book.

The cover of the book is a photograph of Brautigan and a friend identified as Michaela Le Grand, whom he referred to as his &quot;Muse.&quot; The photo was taken by Erik Weber, in San Francisco&#x27;s Washington Square Park in front of the Benjamin Franklin statue. The first chapter of the book is an extended and fanciful description of this photo.

The book is dedicated &quot;For Jack Spicer and Ron Lowinshohn.&quot; Spicer reportedly helped Brautigan revise and edit the book as it was written, as well as arrange for public readings to help promote it.

Arion Press published a deluxe edition of &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot; in 2003, with a preface by Ron Loewinsohn, and a color lithograph in half the edition by Wayne Thiebaud.

==Cultural influence==

Apollo 17 astronaut Jack Schmitt named a crater explored on the Moon in the Taurus-Littrow valley as &quot;Shorty&quot;, after the character in the book.

In March 1994, a teenager named Peter Eastman Jr. from Carpinteria, California legally changed his name to &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot;. At around the same time, National Public Radio reported on a young couple who had named their baby &quot;Trout Fishing in America&quot;. 

The song, &quot;Tee Pees 1-12&quot;, from the album &quot;Fear Fun&quot; by Father John Misty, references the novella with the following lyrics: &quot;Trout Fishing in America made me go and buy a pole. But by the time I got around to reading the book, I was a celebrated deep sea pro.&quot;

<text>Steve Cole (born August 17, 1970) is an American smooth jazz saxophonist. He is also a professor/adviser of music business at the University of St. Thomas.

==Early career and education==

Cole was born in Chicago, Illinois and began to play music at a young age. At first, he trained classically, following in his father&#x27;s footsteps with the clarinet before switching to the saxophone in high school. While at Northwestern University, he studied classical saxophone before changing his field to economics, eventually earning an MBA from The University of Chicago. After leaving school, Cole returned his focus to music; in particular, jazz.

In 2000 his first solo album &quot;Stay Awhile&quot; won him the &quot;Prism Award for Best New Artist&quot; at the &quot;Oasis Smooth Jazz Awards&quot;. He was also a winner of Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s annual young artists competition, allowing him the honour of performing with the orchestra.

In 2001 he hit the charts with the Grover Washington Jr. &amp; Bill Withers classic &quot;Just The Two of Us&quot; from the star-studded tribute album &quot;To Grover, with Love&quot;, produced by renowned keyboardist/arranger/producer Jason Miles. The album eventually made # 4 on the Top Contemporary Jazz Albums. The track covered fantastically by Regina Belle, Steve Cole and George Duke is still on the playlist of many jazz radio stations and has become a jazz classic.

<doc id="1046999" wikidata="Q176563" url="?curid=1046999" title="Latin regional pronunciation">
<text>Latin pronunciation, both in the classical and post-classical age, has varied across different regions and different eras. As the respective languages have undergone sound changes, the changes have often applied to the pronunciation of Latin as well.

Latin still in use today is more often pronounced according to context, rather than geography. For a century, ecclesiastical Latin, that is Latin with an Italianate pronunciation, has been the official pronunciation of the Catholic Church due to the centrality of Italy and Italian, and this is the default of many singers and choirs. In the interest of historically informed performance, some singers of Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music adopt the pronunciation of the composer&#x27;s period and region. While in Western university classics departments the reconstructed classical pronunciation has been general since around 1945, in the Anglo-American legal professions the older style of academic Latin still survives.

The following table shows the main differences between different regions with the International Phonetic Alphabet. This is far from a complete listing and lacks the local variations exhibited through centuries, but is intended to give an outline of main characteristics of different regions.
In many countries, these regional varieties are still in general use in schools and churches. The Italian model is increasingly advocated in ecclesiastical contexts and now widely followed in such contexts by speakers of English, sometimes with slight variations. The &quot;Liber Usualis&quot; prescribes a silent &quot;h&quot;, except in the two words &quot;mihi&quot; and &quot;nihil&quot;, which are pronounced and (this is not universally followed). Some Anglophone singers choose to pronounce &quot;h&quot; as for extra clarity.

<text>Florence Davenport Rice (February 14, 1907 – February 23, 1974) was an American film actress.

==Early years==
Florence Davenport Rice was born in Cleveland, Ohio, the only child of the noted sportswriter Grantland Rice and Fannie Katherine Hollis. She attended Dwight School for Girls at Englewood, New Jersey, and Smith College.

== Career ==
Rice became an actress during the late 1920s and, after several Broadway roles, eventually made her way to Hollywood, where she acted in almost 50 films between 1934 and 1943.

Rice was cast as the reliable girlfriend in several films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM gradually provided her with more substantial roles, occasionally in prestige productions. Rice never became a major figure in movies, but she performed in a number of screen pairings with Robert Young.

Her most widely seen performances were in &quot;Double Wedding&quot; (1937), in which she was billed third in the cast credits behind William Powell and Myrna Loy, &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938) with Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, and The Marx Brothers film &quot;At The Circus&quot; (1939).

During the 1940s, the quality of her roles steadily decreased, and in 1947, she retired.

== Personal life ==
Rice&#x27;s first marriage, to David Page, was annulled. She married broker Sydney A. Smith in New York City on June 12, 1930; they were divorced on May 18, 1931. On March 30, 1939, she married fellow actor Robert Wilcox. They separated less than 2 months later and divorced on July 30, 1940. From August 29, 1946 until her death, Rice was married to Fred Thomas Butler. In 1958, they moved to Hawaii.

==Death==
On February 23, 1974, at age 67, Rice died from lung cancer at Straub Clinic in Honolulu. She was survived by her husband. At her request, there was no funeral, and her remains were cremated, with her ashes scattered over the waters near Waikiki Beach.

<doc id="1047006" wikidata="Q5688719" url="?curid=1047006" title="He Died with a Felafel in His Hand">
<text>He Died with a Felafel in His Hand is a purportedly non-fiction autobiographical novel by Australian author John Birmingham about his experiences as a share housing tenant, first published in 1994 by The Yellow Press (). The story consists of a collection of colourful anecdotes about living in share houses in Brisbane and other cities in Australia with variously dubious housemates. The title refers to a deceased heroin addict found in one such house. The book was subsequently adapted into the longest running stage play in Australian history and, in 2001, was made into a film by Richard Lowenstein, starring Noah Taylor, Emily Hamilton and Sophie Lee. A sequel, &quot;The Tasmanian Babes Fiasco&quot;, was published in 1998.

In 2004, to celebrate the book&#x27;s tenth anniversary, Birmingham approached comic artist Ryan Vella to produce a graphic novel of the book. The pair met in April of that year at Artspace Mackay, for the opening of the Headspace exhibition. The comic was published in September 2004 by Duffy &amp; Snellgrove (). Paul Dawson calls this a grunge lit book.

==Synopsis==
While the book is not written in a linear fashion, the order of houses (and housemates) John lives in is as follows:

1st Place – The Boulevade
* Tom lives in the garage
* Mel lives upstairs. Her boyfriend Warren moves in some time later. When they move out, replaced by
* Andy the med student (nicknamed &quot;Dr Death&quot;)
Tom moves out and is replaced by:
* Derek the bank clerk

2nd Place
* Tom and John got a new place
* Derek the bank clerk (lived in a tent). Replaced by
* Martin the paranoid wargames enthusiast. He lasts three weeks and is replaced by
* Taylor the taxi driver

3rd Place – King Street
* PJ
* Milo
* PJ moves out, replaced by
* The 7 foot nurse, replaced by
* Ray, replaced by
* Malcolm and his Charlie Brown-themed bowls, replaced by
* Victor the Rastafarian, replaced by
* McGann the American, in his mid 40s, with a fondness for prostitutes, replaced by
* Taylor the taxi driver.
Taylor is having personal problems. He ambushes his fellow housemates with a toy gun after hiding for an hour. He tells them if it had been a real gun they would all be dead. John sees that as a good reason to move out.

4th Place – Duke Street (Brisbane)
* &quot;Thunderbird Ron&quot;
* Macgyver the mushroom farmer
* Neal the albino moontanner
* Howie (Neal&#x27;s friend)
* Satomi Tiger (via Tim the invisible flatmate)
* &quot;Brainthrust&quot; Leonard
* Jabba the Hutt
* Mick the English backpacker
* Colin and Stepan
John moves out for reasons not made clear.

5th Place – Melbourne
* Stacey the Who Weekly fan
John moves out when her loud sex sessions become too much to bear.

6th Place – Fitzroy
* Brain the electrician
* Greg the gay school teacher

Birmingham&#x27;s narrative is interspersed with humorous testimonials from other veterans of the Australian share house lifestyle, and descriptions of common share house paraphernalia, such as the bucket bong, the ubiquitous &quot;brown couch&quot;, and milk crates serving as makeshift furniture.

==Reception==
&quot;In Review&quot; called it part of &quot;Brisbane’s Holy Trinity of Gen X Lit... a knockabout comedy, but with serious bits that people always forget are in there, and was required reading for anyone who lived in a share house or who just wanted to read a funny book.&quot;

<text>Durlach is a district in Karlsruhe, Germany, with a population of roughly 30,000.

The district is further divided into &quot;Alt-Durlach&quot;, &quot;Dornwald-Untermühl&quot;, &quot;Hanggebiet&quot;, &quot;Bergwald&quot;, &quot;Aue&quot;, &quot;Lohn-Lissen&quot; and &quot;Killisfeld&quot;.

==History==

Durlach was bestowed by emperor Frederick II on the margrave Hermann V of Zähringen as an allodial possession.

It was chosen by the margrave Charles II in 1565 as residence of the rulers of Baden-Durlach, and retained this distinction though it was almost totally destroyed by the French in 1689.

Margrave Charles III William decided that he needed more space which led to the foundation of Karlsruhe in 1715, which three years later became the new capital until the state was merged into the grand-duchy of Baden.

In 1846, it was the seat of a congress of the Liberal Party of the Baden Parliament. In 1849 during the Baden Revolution, it was the scene of an encounter between the Prussians and the insurgents.

In 1938, Durlach was incorporated into Karlsruhe, which had was now bigger and connected by a canal and an avenue of poplars with it, on the left bank of the Pfinz, at the foot of the Turmberg.

During the Second World War, 329 people were killed in Durlach.

Georg Friedrich von Reichenbach and Ernst Ludwig Posselt (1763–1804, historian) were natives of the town.

==Life and heritage==

Important attractions are the Karlsburg Castle in the center, erected in 1565 and later used as barracks, now with some museums an ancient town hall, a church with an excellent organ, and in the market-place a statue of the margrave Charles II.

The Turmberg (&#x27;tower hill&#x27;) is a vineyard-covered hill of the northernmost part of the Black Forest. A castle ruin with watch-tower are located on top of the Turmberg. The watch-tower in particular offers fine views of Karlsruhe towards the west and the Rhine River valley. On very clear days even farther west the Vosges in France can be seen. The Rhine River is the border between Germany and Alsace area of France. The South and East offer nice views of the Black Forest, and since the Turmberg is the northernmost tip of the Black Forest you have hills more than actual mountains. A staircase leads all the way up from the bottom of the hill to the top, however you can also ride up using the Turmbergbahn, a historic funicular railway. In recent years the railway was changed from water gravity to electric.

== Economy ==
Durlach hosted several factories, producing sewing-machines (Pfaff), brushes, chemicals, tobacco, beer, vinegar, chicory and pipe organs. Now most manufacture has disappeared, except for a producer of homeopathy and dietary supplements. IT companies have taken their place, the biggest Fiducia IT AG, which provides banking services for most German credit unions.

<text>Edward Calhoun King (September 14, 1949 – August 22, 2018) was an American musician. He was a guitarist for the psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock and guitarist and bassist for the Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd from 1972 to 1975, and again from 1987 to 1996.

==Strawberry Alarm Clock==

King was born in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, California. He was one of the founding members of the LA-based Strawberry Alarm Clock, a mid-1960s pop psychedelic rock band. The band&#x27;s largest success was with the 1967 single &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. While with the band he played both electric guitar and bass guitar. The band&#x27;s popularity waned considerably in the early 1970s. Faced with the loss of their recording contract with Uni Records and with internal conflicts over musical direction, Strawberry Alarm Clock disbanded in early 1972. King opted to relocate in the South, inspired by an up-and-coming band called Lynyrd Skynyrd (who opened for Strawberry Alarm Clock on their tour of the South).

== Lynyrd Skynyrd ==
King met the members of what was to become the Jacksonville, Florida-based Southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd when an earlier incarnation of the band known as The One Percent opened for Strawberry Alarm Clock in early 1968. King was so enamoured with the band that he told vocalist and leader Ronnie Van Zant that if they ever needed his services, he would be happy to join. It was not until 1972 when bassist Leon Wilkeson left the band that Van Zant took King up on his offer and asked him to join Skynyrd as the band&#x27;s new bassist. Wilkeson soon regretted leaving and rejoined the band, and King switched to lead guitar, creating with Allen Collins and Gary Rossington the triple-guitar attack that became the band&#x27;s signature sound. The band referred to this unique new setup with King as the &quot;Three Guitar Army&quot;.

King&#x27;s guitar playing and songwriting skills were an essential element of Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s first three albums: &quot;(Pronounced &#x27;Lĕh-&#x27;nérd &#x27;Skin-&#x27;nérd)&quot;, &quot;Second Helping&quot; and &quot;Nuthin&#x27; Fancy&quot;. King co-wrote one of the band&#x27;s most recognizable hits &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, and his voice counted the &quot;one, two, three&quot;, before he launched into his famous riff to start the song. Other songs that King wrote or co-wrote for Lynyrd Skynyrd include &quot;Poison Whiskey&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot;, &quot;Whiskey Rock-a-Roller&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; for MCA&quot;. Guitarist Rossington noted years later that King was the most business-minded member of Lynyrd Skynyrd, relating a story of how King would stock up on food items during stops on tour and then re-sell the items to his bandmates at a 500% markup when they later got hungry on the bus.

Band biographer Mark Ribowsky wrote that King was an outsider in Lynyrd Skynyrd to some extent, as he was from Southern California and the only non-Southerner in the lineup, but that it was King who brought a level of professionalism to the fledgling band. King detailed his initial exit from the band in the documentary &quot;If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot;, saying &quot;Ronnie [Van Zant] and my guitar roadie who changed my strings were thrown in jail in Ann Arbor. They didn&#x27;t arrive...until 10 minutes before we went on. I had to play on old strings and I broke two strings during &quot;Free Bird&quot;. After, Ronnie was riding me, and a lightbulb went off and I said, &quot;That&#x27;s it.&quot; I went back to my room, packed up my stuff and left.&quot; King referred to himself as a peaceful &quot;Southern California hippie&quot; and the band&#x27;s predilection for drunken brawling never sat well with him; the incident which led to his departure was merely the final straw.

King&#x27;s departure in 1975 happened during a particularly difficult tour that the band dubbed the &quot;Torture Tour&quot;, a tour that also claimed drummer and founding member Bob Burns weeks earlier due to a mental breakdown. The band continued with only two guitarists for a few months before discovering Steve Gaines in 1976. Gaines was killed in a plane crash along with his sister Cassie Gaines and Van Zant on October 20, 1977. Coincidentally, Steve Gaines was born on the same day as King, September 14, 1949.

King was one of the guitarists in the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987, and played a major role. He had to leave the band again in 1996 because of congestive heart failure. In 2005, Ed asked Mark Basile, a long time friend and guitarist from New York, to put together the remaining non-touring Skynyrd members, Artimus Pyle, Leslie Hawkins, JoJo Billingsley and Bob Burns for several shows from 2005-2006. That band, called The Saturday Night Special Band, played several shows that can be found on YouTube. 

King, along with all pre-crash members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. His guitar playing influenced many subsequent musicians, including Metallica bassist Cliff Burton.

== Personal life ==
In 2011, King underwent a successful heart transplant. In 2017, he appeared as a customer in the Discovery Channel docudrama &quot;Moonshiners&quot;, buying $30,000 worth of premium gin.

According to a Nashville news station WTVF, King had been battling cancer in the months prior to his death. King died in his Nashville, Tennessee, home on August 22, 2018, at 68 years of age. His death was announced through his personal Facebook page. Following King&#x27;s death, former Lynyrd Skynyrd bandmate Rossington released a statement saying, &quot;Ed was our brother, and a great songwriter and guitar player. I know he will be reunited with the rest of the boys in Rock and Roll Heaven. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.&quot;

<text>Nawab Nauroz (Nowroz) Khan (1868?–1965), also known by Balochs as Dada (baluchi for grandfather) Nowroz, was the head of the Zarakzai (Zehri), a subject to the Khan of Kalat in Balochistan, British India (the area was not in British India until 1875). After his unsuccessful insurgency against the government of that time he was imprisoned in Kohlu jail where he died in 1965.

==Early years==
Little is known about Nowroz Khan&#x27;s early years. He was born some time in the 1860s or 1870s (sources disagree on the date) at a time when Kalat was a princely state within the framework of the British Raj. By 1887 the British had reached a settlement with Kalat agreeing on limited autonomy in exchange for British authority in military affairs and external relationships, but the country remained instable, with periodic fighting against the authorities or between tribal groups.

Nauroz Khan became Nawab and leader of the Zehri tribe in the Jhalawan area of Kalat at a time before the introduction of electricity or motor vehicles, head of a largely nomadic people in a harsh mountain / desert environment, but with a rich tradition of Baluchi, Persian and Muslim culture.

==Background to insurgency==

In 1955 the various states of Balochistan were dissolved and merged into the province of West Pakistan under the &quot;One Unit&quot; policy. In 1948, Ahmad Yar Khan, the Khan of Kalat (the largest former Baloch princely state), agreed to join Pakistan. The signing of the Instrument of Accession by Ahmad Yar Khan, led his brother, Prince Abdul Karim, to revolt against his brother&#x27;s decision in July 1948. He along with few of his followers moved to Afghanistan to seek Afghan government support to form an independent Balochistan state. Afghan government wanted to rather annex Balochistan as it was in desperate need of a sea port. Prince Karim failed to get any support from the Afghan government and the local Balochs, who were not interested in rebelling against the government of Pakistan. He, eventually surrendered to Pakistan after a year.

==Insurgency and imprisonment==

Nowroz Khan&#x27;s band of fighters, was involved in several sharp skirmishes with forces led by Lt. Col. Tikka Khan. Nowroz agreed to surrender on May 15, 1959 in exchange for amnesty. However, when Nowroz Khan came down from the hills, he and about 150 of his followers, including his sons and nephews, were arrested for insurgency against the state. 

In July 15, 1960 seven of the leaders were executed by hanging in Hyderabad Jail. Nowroz was spared execution on account of his age, but died in Kohlu Jail in 1964. The Khan of Kalat was subsequently forgiven and freed.

<text>Donald John Hall (April 2, 1930 – December 24, 2017) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who spent the majority of his career with the Johnstown Jets of the Eastern Hockey League.

In 1946, at the age of 16, Hall signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 1951 he signed with the Johnstown Jets, a farm team of the Montreal Canadiens. Upon signing, Hall agreed to sign a &quot;C-form&quot;, which allowed the Canadiens to own Hall&#x27;s rights as a professional hockey player. During Hall&#x27;s rookie season, he played against future hockey Hall of Fame forward Maurice Richard in an exhibition game on November 20, 1951, in front of 1,638 fans at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena. Although Hall did not score that night, Richard scored six goals against Ivan Walmsley, who was considered to be the Jets&#x27; standout goaltender at the time.

Hall played 754 games in eleven years with the Jets. In that time he scored 424 career goals, the second-highest total in team history, and had 641 assists and 1,056 points. At the time of his retirement, he was the all-time leading scorer in organized hockey. He made the All-Star team nine times.

After retiring in 1962, Hall coached an EHL All-Star team which toured the Soviet Union. In Hall&#x27;s words, their team got &quot;creamed&quot; and didn&#x27;t win a game until they reached Czechoslovakia. &quot;They sent their best teams,&quot; Hall said, &quot;and they didn&#x27;t lay down for anybody.&quot;

Hall&#x27;s jersey number 9 was retired by the Johnstown Chiefs during the 1990–91 season, in honour of his distinguished career with the Jets. A banner commemorating his retirement hangs in the Cambria Country War Memorial Arena.

Hall resided in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, with his wife, Jean. They had three children.

<text>Vasai (Konkani and Marathi pronunciation: ; British English: Bassein; formerly and alternatively Marathi; &quot;Bajipur&quot;) is a historical place and city located in Palghar district; which was partitioned out of the Thane district in 2014. It also forms a part of Vasai-Virar twin cities in the Konkan division, Maharashtra, India, and comes under the Police Jurisdiction of Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar Police Commissionerate.

The Portuguese in Goa and Damaon built Fort Bassein to defend their colony and participate in the lucrative spice trade and the silk route that converged in the area. Much of Portuguese Bombay and Bassein was seized by Marathas under Peshva rule, at the Battle of Bassein in 1739.

The British East India Company at Bombay then took the area from the Maratha Empire in 1780; following the First Anglo-Maratha War.




==Etymology==
The present name &quot;Vasai&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;Waas&quot;, meaning &#x27;dwelling&#x27; or &#x27;residence&#x27;. The name was changed to &quot;Basai&quot;, which was named under Bahadur Shah of Gujarat after the Gujarat Sultanate took over the region. This is also the first Latinized record of the name, which was spelled as &quot;Baxay&quot; by Barbosa (1514). The name was short-lived as it was changed under Portuguese rule, approximately two decades later, to &quot;Baçaim&quot; (also the first official Latin name) following the signing of the Treaty of Vasai in 1534. This name was again changed after over 200 years to &quot;Bajipur&quot; after the Maratha Empire took over the region. This name was also short-lived as after the capture of &quot;Bajipur (the Maratha name for Vasai)&quot; by the British, the name was changed yet again to &quot;Bassein&quot;. During this same time, Bombay took over Bassein as the dominant economic power in the region. The town was renamed to &quot;Vasai&quot;, the Marathi name for the region, following the devolution of the British Raj in India.

===Demonym===
English: Bassein; Portuguese: Baçaim), Vasai is called &quot;Vasaikar&quot; in Marathi, in which the suffix &quot;kar&quot; means &#x27;resident of&#x27;. The term had been in use since the official renaming of Bassein to Vasai. The Vasaikar diaspora outside of Maharashtra state, as well as outside of India, refer to themselves as from Mumbai due to its international recognition and Vasai being located within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, near the edge of suburban Mumbai.

==History==

===Pre-Portuguese era===
The history of Vasai dates back to the ancient Puranic ages. Vasai was a trading ground for many Greek, Arab, Persian and Roman traders and merchants who would enter through the west coast of India. The Greek merchant Cosma Indicopleustes is known to have visited the areas around Vasai in the 6th century and the Chinese traveler Xuanzang later in June or July 640. According to historian José Gerson da Cunha, during this time, Bassein and its surrounding areas appeared to have been ruled by the Chalukya dynasty of Karnataka. 
Until the 11th century, several Arabian geographers had mentioned references to towns nearby Vasai, like Thana and Sopara, but no references had been made to Vasai. Vasai was later ruled by the Silhara dynasty of Konkan and eventually passed to the Seuna dynasty. It was head of district under the Seuna (1184–1318). Later conquered by the Gujarat Sultanate, where it was named &quot;Basai&quot;, few years later Barbosa (1514) described it under the name Baxay (pronounced Basai) as a town with a good seaport belonging to the King of Gujarat.

In 1295, the Italian explorer Marco Polo passed through Vasai.

===Portuguese era===
The Portuguese first reached the west coast of India when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at Calicut in 1498. According to historian Manuel de Faria e Sousa, the coast of Basai was first visited by the Portuguese in 1509, when Francisco de Almeida on his way to Diu captured a Muslim ship in the harbour of Bombay, with 24 citizens of the Gujarat Sultanate aboard.

To the Portuguese, Basai was an important trading centre located on the Arabian Sea. They saw it as a vital service station that would give them access to global sea routes and goods such as salt, fish, timber and mineral resources. They wanted to build a shipyard to manufacture ships and use the fertile land to grow rice, sugarcane, cotton, betel nuts and other crops to trade globally.

The presence of the Portuguese significantly shaped the region into what it is today.

==== Treaty of Vasai (Bassein) (1534) ====
In 1530 the Portuguese, under António da Silveira, took advantage of its strong navy and pillaged and burnt the village of Vasai (Basai). The army of Gujarat Sultanate was not strong enough for the Portuguese forces and, despite resistance, the Sultan of Gujarat was eventually defeated. In 1531 António set fire to Basai yet again as punishment for the Sultan for not ceding Diu, a vital island that would protect trade in the region. In 1533, Diogo (Heitor) da Silveira set fire to the western coast leading from Bandora through Thana and Basai to Surat.

Portuguese General Nuno da Cunha discovered that the son of Meliqueaz, the governor of Diu, Malik Tokan was fortifying Basai with 14,000 men. Seeing this fortification as a threat, Nano da Cunha assembled a fleet of 150 ships with 4000 men and sailed to north of Basai. Upon seeing the naval superiority of the Portuguese, Malik Tokan attempted to initiate a peace agreement with Nano da Cunha. Upon rejection, Malik Tokan was forced to fight against the Portuguese. Despite bringing fewer soldiers, the Portuguese managed to kill most of the enemy while losing only a few of their own.

The Treaty of Bassein was signed by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and the Kingdom of Portugal on 23 December 1534 while on board the galleon São Mateus. Based on the terms of the agreement, the Portuguese Empire gained control of the village of Basai as well as its territories, islands and seas including Bombay. The village was renamed to Baçaim and became the northern capital of Portuguese territories in India.

Garcia de Sá was later appointed as the first Captain (governor) of Baçaim by his brother-in-law Nuno da Cunha in 1536, who ruled until 1548 when the governorship was passed onto Jorge Cabral. The first cornerstone for the Bassein Fort was laid by António Galvão.

Under Portuguese rule, the Fort Bassein was the Northern Court, or &#x27;Corte da Norte&#x27;, functioning as the headquarters of the Court of the North. Baçaim became the capital of the Northern Province, the most productive village of Portuguese India and became a resort for Portuguese &#x27;fidalgos&#x27; (noblemen and wealthy merchants). A great Portuguese person would be called &#x27;Fidalgo ou Cavalheiro de Baçaim&#x27; (&quot;Nobleman of Baçaim&quot;). By 1674, the Portuguese constructed 2 colleges, 4 convent schools and 15 churches in total in Baçaim&#x27;s territories. For approximately 205 years, the presence of the Portuguese made the surrounding area a vibrant and opulent village.

The local ethnic community were called &#x27;Norteiro&#x27; (Northern men), named after the Court of the North functioning out of the fort.

In 1674, about 600 Arab pirates from Muscat entered Baçaim via the west and pillaged the churches in Baçaim. The unexpected attack weakened the Portuguese control outside the fort walls and Maratha warriors stationed in the west isolated them further.

===Maratha era===
In the 18th century, Vasai Fort was attacked by the Maratha Empire under Peshwa Baji Rao&#x27;s brother Chimaji Appa and the Portuguese surrendered on 16 May 1739 after the Battle of Vasai (Baçaim). The Marathas allowed the women and the children of the enemy to leave peacefully. The Portuguese lost a total of 4 main ports, 8 cities, 2 fortified hills, 340 villages and 20 fortresses.

This defeat of the Portuguese, combined with Portuguese royal Catherine of Braganza&#x27;s wedding dowry of the Seven Islands of Bombay to Charles II of England, led to Bombay overtaking Bajipur (the Maratha name for Vasai) as the dominant economic power in the region.

===British era===
With the British ruling the island of Bombay just south of the Vasai Creek, the region&#x27;s prominence as a trade centre in India became increasingly overshadowed by Bombay.

After the death of Madhavrao I in 1772, his brother Narayan Rao became Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. Narayan Rao was the fifth Peshwa of the Maratha Empire from November 1772 until his murder by his palace guards in August 1773. Narayan Rao&#x27;s widow, Gangabai, gave birth to a posthumous son, who was legal heir to the throne. The newborn infant was named Sawai Madhavrao. Twelve Maratha chiefs, led by Nana Fadnavis, directed an effort to name the infant as the new Peshwa and rule under him as regents.

Raghunathrao, unwilling to give up his position of power, sought help from the British at Bombay and signed the Treaty of Surat on 6 March 1775. According to the treaty, Raghunathrao ceded the territories of Salsette and Vasai to the British, along with part of the revenues from the Surat and Bharuch districts. In return, the British promised to provide Raghunathrao with 2,500 soldiers. The treaty was later annulled by the British Supreme Council of Bengal and replaced by the Treaty of Purandar on 1 March 1776. Raghunathrao was pensioned and his cause abandoned, but the revenues of the Salsette and Bharuch districts were retained by the British. The British Bombay Presidency rejected this new treaty and gave refuge to Raghunathrao. In 1777, Nana Fadnavis violated his treaty with the British Supreme Council of Bengal by granting the French a port on west coast. The British retaliated by sending a force towards Pune.

Following a treaty between France and the Maratha Empire in 1776, the British Bombay Presidency decided to invade and reinstate Raghunathrao. They sent a force under Colonel Egerton, but were defeated. The British were forced to sign the Treaty of Wadgaon on 16 January 1779, a victory for the Marathas. Reinforcements from northern India, commanded by Colonel Thomas Goddard, arrived too late to save the Bombay force. The British Governor-General in the British Bengal Presidency, Warren Hastings, rejected the treaty on the grounds that the Bombay officials had no legal power to sign it. He ordered Goddard to secure British interests in the area. Goddard captured Bassein on 11 December 1780. The city was renamed from &quot;Bajipur&quot; to &quot;Bassein&quot; under British rule.

In 1801, Yashwantrao Holkar rebelled against the rival factions of the Maratha Empire. He defeated the combined forces of the Daulat Rao Scindia and Peshwa Baji Rao II in the Battle of Poona and captured Poona (Pune). Peshwa Baji Rao II eventually took refuge in Bassein, where the British had a stronghold. The Bassein Fort played a strategic role in the First Anglo-Maratha War.

==== Treaty of Bassein (1802) ====
The Treaty of Bassein (1802) was signed on 31 December 1802 between the British East India Company and Baji Rao II, the Maratha Peshwa of Pune (Poona), in India after the Battle of Poona. The treaty was a decisive step in the dissolution of the Maratha Empire and the expansion of British rule over the Indian subcontinent.

==Industrialization==
The eastern part of Vasai is highly industrialized, with small- and medium-scale units producing a wide variety of goods.

Besides that, auto rickshaws are the main source of transport in the region. Indian Railways introduced a local train service in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region in 1867. The upgraded local train runs between Virar and Churchgate and has a frequency of a train every 4 minutes.

==Tourism==
The Vasai Fort, originally built in 1184, is a major tourist attraction in the region.

<text>A is a referee employed by the Japan Sumo Association, responsible for a variety of activities which concern the organisation of the sport in general and the refereeing of matches, as well as the preservation of professional sumo culture, deeply rooted in Shinto traditions. Subject to the same strict hierarchy and traditional appearance as the other professions gravitating around professional sumo, the are one of the most visible professions at tournaments (), being the third person in the (wrestling ring) and sometimes defined as &quot;an essential part of the sumo spectacle.&quot;

Inherited from a tradition of refereeing dating back to the Heian period, did not take on their current role until the Tenshō era in the late 16th century. Since the end of the 18th century, have been entrusted with religious functions, which they perform during the consecration of combat areas, before tournaments or in the stables to which they belong. The &#x27;s responsibilities also include drafting the , the document defining the promotion or demotion of wrestlers, and supervise match selections made by the (elders) on each tournament day.

==History==
The role of referee in sumo began long before the was entrusted with it. During the Heian period, the role of match referee was not yet defined, and besides the wrestlers, there were a number of officials responsible for supervising matches. These roles were given to imperial guards bearing the title of , a rank bearing the same kanji as the spelling of . These officials, dressed as archers and carrying bows and quivers, were accompanied by substitutes, the , who were dressed in the same way and were responsible for keeping the scorebook. An official, Shiga-no-Seirin (sometimes spelled Shigano Seirin or called Shiga Seirin), was appointed by Emperor Shōmu and founded one of the first hereditary lines of referees, and is also credited with establishing the original forty-eight sumo techniques. During the same period, the term &quot;&quot; also appeared, but the role of the staff bearing this title, all sixth-tier courtiers, was confined to administrative organization and various tasks linked to the court ceremony alongside the sumo tournaments. At the start of the Kamakura shogunate, still did not referee matches, this role falling to , or &#x27;sumo magistrates&#x27;. During the Muromachi period, the term began to be applied to samurai-ranked referees, involved in the temporary judging of matches between wrestlers.

In 1570 (Genki era), however, Oda Nobunaga appointed two warriors from his retinue to the role of and gave them the task of organizing the shogunate&#x27;s sumo tournaments. During the Tokugawa shogunate, sumo became popular but the , in an effort to moralize society, banned traditional tournaments organized as part of festivals. As the sport began to be sponsored by the local lords, and in order to eliminate conflicts that would lead to the shogunate&#x27;s ban on sumo, referee families taught sumo etiquette, rules and techniques to professional wrestlers () in various domains. With the incorporation of Shinto elements into sumo traditions during the Tokugawa shogunate, the role of took on even greater importance, emerging as surrogate priests. As a result, requiring licenses to exercise the role of referee became extremely valuable, and by the early 18th century two families stood out in the legal control of : the House of Yoshida Tsukasa and the , both originating from the long tradition of local lords appointing their own officials to train wrestlers sponsored by their domain.

Before the national standardization of sumo organizations, the sporting landscape was divided between several associations scattered around the country, the largest developing in Edo, Kyoto and Osaka. At the end of the 18th century, around 1780, the Edo-based sumo association began a long period of domination of the national sumo scene. Yoshida Tsukasa, the clan controlling the observance of etiquette in Edo, took advantage of this gain in popularity to consolidate its authority over the other hereditary lines of referees, leading to the sole recognition of the referee traditions inherited from this family, which continues to the present. During the mid-Edo period, the role of asserted itself and began to take on its current form, with the use of the (war fan) and the wearing of the ceremonial kimono.

==Career and ranking==
===Ring names===
Like wrestlers and most other professions involved in professional sumo, do not work under their real name, but under a pseudonym similar to the , or ring name, used by wrestlers. In modern times, all will take either the family name or as their professional name, depending on the tradition recruits are joining. Within these two families, the names of the two highest-ranking members never change and the two top are always called , the junior , and , his senior.

With the rise in importance and popularity of sumo during the Edo period, many hereditary lines of referees became codified, and some sought the patronage of the House of Yoshida Tsukasa. Around 1770, several lineages existed simultaneously and officiated throughout Japan under the influence of the Yoshida, such as the Iwai Sauma in Kyoto, Shakushi Ichigaku in Osaka, Hattori Shikiemon in Higo and Suminoe Shikikuro in Nagasaki. Between 1726 and 1729, the referees named Kimura Shōnosuke and sought patronage from the Yoshida and began working as referees in the Edo-based association. According to a genealogy tree produced by the 6th Shōnosuke during the Meiwa era, the name Kimura Shōnosuke was originally adopted during the Kan&#x27;ei era by Nakadachi Uzaemon, a vassal of the Sanada clan, who was the third-generation head of a hereditary line of referees. The Shikimori, however, descend from a different lineage, founded by a former wrestler who became an elder under the name Isenoumi Godaiyū. He later changed his name to Shikimori Godaiyū and launched his own line of referees. Between 1765 and 1774, one of his descendants, named Shikimori Inosuke, established himself as a prominent figure and was appointed as one of the highest referee, second only to Kimura Shōnosuke; thus de facto taking the lead in his line.

Today, the lineage of referees is mostly extinct, with the exception of the Kimura and Shikimori families which are the names of the two most powerful lines of referees to have made their mark since the middle of the 18th century. Today&#x27;s must choose to belong to one of these two lines.

 surnames may be influenced by stable traditions. The two families are not equal; their heads, for example, do not have quite the same rank, a Kimura still being considered a senior compared to a Shikimori. The Kimura family is also much larger, with almost twice as many members as the Shikimori. At one time, there was still a blood tie between the members of these families, but nowadays the relationship between families is primarily hierarchical, with switching between families as they are promoted through the ranks, particularly when they reach the top of the hierarchy. Thus, the referee named Shikimori Inosuke, head of the Shikimori, will take the name Kimura Shōnosuke, and will therefore change family, if the latter retires. Other examples of promotion in the other family included notably that of the who changed from the Kimura family to the Shikimori family when he gave up his name of to become the eleventh upon his promotion to the ranks of in 2012. The had been with the Kimura family from his debut in September 1979 until his promotion in January 2025.

As rise through the ranks and begin officiating higher divisions, they can change their first name to that of a past , thus taking on a more prestigious name, often part of a long tradition. For example, the name Shikimori Kandayū has been passed down for more than two hundred years. Other traditions may, on the contrary, encourage the referee to keep his name or to be given a unique one linked to his stable.

Each lineage of referee has its own traditions, one of the most visible being the handling of the when the latter is pointed in one direction to determine a winner: Kimura referees keep the back of their fist upward, while Shikimori referees have their palm facing upward.

===System of promotion===
The maximum number of allowed in the Sumo Association is 45. , there are 43 within the Sumo Association. Like the , the are employed directly by the Japan Sumo Association but are affiliated with the stables like wrestlers. New recruits do not have to meet height or weight requirements and it is even implied that a small is preferable, for aesthetic reasons, as it creates a greater contrast with the taller and bigger wrestlers. Many are former wrestlers who could not rise in the professional world and decided to change their path. Prior to 1972, the began their training at the age of six or seven, before becoming referees in real-life situations between the ages of thirteen and fourteen, while at the same time receiving a normal education. Recruits now begin their career around the age of fifteen or sixteen, after graduating from junior high school. then work up a career ladder based on the professional sumo divisions until their retirement at 65. The current ranking system consists of the following eight ranks, listed in descending order:
* 
* 
* 
* 

Promotions are decided once a year at the (rankings) organization meeting held after the September tournament and are only applicable starting the following January. Promotions were mainly based on seniority, but from 1972 onwards, greater consideration was given to the personal qualities of referees, such as their ability to judge, the tone and power of their voice and also their work ethic. Other qualities are also taken into account, such as calligraphic skills, speed and agility in the ring and leadership shown when facing a difficult decision. On the other hand, too many invalidated refereeing decisions can hinder promotion. This penalty, however, is the highest consequence a can suffer, as cannot be demoted. The maximum number of -ranked ( and above) is between 20 and 22. Until 1960, there was no mandatory retirement age and top-ranked usually served until death, illness or senility. The promotion chain was hence blocked to the point where a persistent rumour had it that junior rejoiced at the death of their elders as much as they lamented it. Today&#x27;s promotions are slow but almost certain and some may be as popular as some wrestlers.

Junior evolve under the tutelage of their seniors. Unlike wrestlers, have no training school for their initial training, and learn everything from the master under whom they are placed. It usually takes a 15 years to be promoted to the ranks. It takes another 15 years to be promoted to officiating matches. The (top two ) usually have anywhere from 40 to 50 years of experience. There are exceptions, notably the who was promoted to Shikimori Inosuke at the age of 48 in 1973, making him the youngest in the history of the sport. As referees are promoted, the number of matches they can officiate is reduced. Young can referee up to ten matches in a day, while their seniors can referee two at most. At the top of the hierarchy, the referee just one match.

Compared to other professions outside professional sumo, or compared to wrestlers&#x27; salaries, pay is low but still higher than that of . Top-ranked earn between 400,000 and 500,000 yen ($3320, or €2487 as of November 2023). The basic salary for a -ranked is between 42,000 yen ($281, or €258) to 100,000 yen ($669, or €615). Like wrestlers, however, receive bonuses after each tournament.

Prior to July 1993, the were the only profession of sumo unrelated to wrestler (retired or active) to be featured in the , the traditional rankings of sumo. Since then, the upper-ranked also have their names automatically included on the . The names of the are listed in the center vertical column above the names of the judges and below the and the tournament dates and site.

, like wrestlers, are deprived of certain freedoms unless they reach a certain rank, and are required, for example, to live in their own stable. However, unlike wrestlers, who have the option of living elsewhere once they reach the rank of , can move once they reach the rank of . who have achieved status are assigned (personal attendants) just as top wrestlers are. These may be junior referees or lower-ranked wrestlers, the latter being considered unlucky because there is a superstition in the sumo world that a wrestler serving a will not go on to have a successful career. The may have a maximum of two assistants, when the referees ranked below him have only one. ranked near the top of the hierarchy can use an , a bamboo and luggage box dating back to the Edo period, to transport their personal belongings. also have their names displayed on (tall banner) at the entrance to the arenas where tournaments are held. In the past, retired who had managed to secure an elder-share (a pseudonym under which a person may become an executive of the Japan Sumo Association) could remain in the Japan Sumo Association as elders, but the practice is no longer permitted.

====Current ====
As of the January 2025 tournament there are two :
* 39th Kimura Shōnosuke (Kokonoe stable), real name: Yūji Horasawa, since September 2024. He was promoted to the lower of the two ranks as the 42nd Shikimori Inosuke before he was elevated in January 2025 to Kimura Shōnosuke.
* 43rd Shikimori Inosuke (Kasugano stable), real name: Yoshimitsu Morita, since January 2025.

====Current ====
As of the January 2025 tournament there are three :

* Kimura Kōnosuke (Kokonoe stable), real name: Toshiaki Kojima, since January 2019.
* Kimura Hisanosuke (Ōshima stable), real name: Toshikazu Hata, since January 2024.
* 12th Shikimori Kandayū (Asahiyama stable), real name: Hiroshi Kikuchi, since January 2025.

===Traditional Dress===

In the ring, wear elaborate ceremonial costumes, either called the or the , making them a &quot;flamboyant part of the sumo scene.&quot; The kimono worn by the is usually a gift from patrons. It imitates either the one worn by samurai-ranked officials during hunting parties organized during the Muromachi period, or court dress worn during the Heian period.

The costume has undergone a series of changes to arrive at its current form. During the Edo period, wore a linen , a sleeveless kimono with exaggerated shoulders, called . In May 1910, the Tokyo-sumo association made the decision to change the costume of professional referees to the one currently in use. However, the tradition of wearing the costumes used during the Edo period is still preserved in traditional regional tournaments, particularly on the Oki Islands. With the Dampatsurei Edict of 1871, referees could no longer keep their , and one of the reasons for adopting the new costume would have been to make it easier to conceal the referee&#x27;s hair to hide his lack of topknot with a hat. This hat, worn in addition to the richly decorated kimonos, is called an . It is a lacquered black hat inspired by the hats worn by courtiers in feudal Japan and fashioned after the hats worn by Shinto priests. To add color to this headdress, some replace the &#x27;s dark cords with colored ones. Each costume worn by ranked in or above is as expensive as a worn by wrestlers of equivalent rank during their ring entering ceremonies. Each chooses the color and pattern of his kimono, but only may use purple, the symbol of their rank. In winter, tend to wear darker colors than those worn during the summer months. Although kimono are often embroidered with very traditional motifs such as , in October 2021, the Japan Sumo Association formed a partnership with The Pokémon Company to celebrate the 25th anniversary of &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot; and since the , can be seen wearing Poké Ball-themed kimono.

The outfits used all incorporate a number of rosettes, called , and tassels, called . These ornaments change color to indicate the gyoji&#x27;s rank. Unlike , whose uniform is identical regardless of rank, each &#x27;s costume reflects the rank he holds and has specific features depending on the rank reached. On promotion, the will change into more elaborate outfits and small changes in dress continue as the referee moves up the hierarchy. Since 1960, who have attained the rank of wear several pairs of per tournament. These socks, originally designed only for walking on mats and not on the hard and sandy surface of a , wear out very quickly after a day of matches. who are promoted to the rank of may wear an on the rear-right side of their belt. Both the top two carry a (a dagger) visible in the left side of the belt of the outfit. This is supposed to represent the seriousness of the decisions they must make in determining the outcome of a bout, and a symbolic preparedness to commit if they make a mistake. Another rumor has it that the referee carries this dagger to defend his verdict against any wrestler or spectator who comes to threaten him or question his decision. This was notably the case during an Osaka-based sumo association match during the Edo period, when a local by the name of had to defend himself against an aggressive elder who was unhappy that his wrestler had been declared the loser.

As their careers progress, incorporate elements such as the following into their outfits:
To accompany their costumes, each carries a , a wooden war fan similar to the Japanese command staff used by generals at the head of their troops. There are no rules about the materials to be used or the shape a should take. The first owned by a young is given to him either by a senior or the stablemaster of the stable to which he belongs. Each has his own and those handled by top-ranked , lacquered with gold or silver ornamentation. Some are handed down from generation to generation, sometimes to be used only by the who holds a particular ring name. This is notably the case for Kimura Shōnosuke&#x27;s , which has been passed down to successors for over 160 years. Shikimori Kandayū&#x27;s is also a legacy handed down since Kandayū II in 1866.

==Responsibilities==
===Refereeing a match===
The &#x27;s principal and most obvious task is to referee bouts between two sumo wrestlers. The is regarded as an unquestionable authority figure in the ring, and is never booed or hissed at. The &#x27;s verdicts can, however, be overturned by the judges seated around the ring (the ). During the Meiji era, Japan underwent a series of changes which also had an impact on the traditional way in which sumo tournaments were held and on the organisation of the sumo association. During the same period, Takasago Uragorō launched a protest movement forcing the association to adopt measures aimed at improving their image, in particular by ending the possession of the final judgement of a match, which was changed from to .

Each referees matches taking place in the division that corresponds to the referee&#x27;s rank. Only the are allowed to referee a match involving a . In all the matches they referee, are expected to give a decision on the spot, whatever the conditions at the end of a match. Too many overturned decisions lead to stagnation in the promotion order or a salary cut. The only exception is that (rematch) are not counted as refereeing errors. If a referee in the highest ranks has too many of his decisions overturned, he is expected to submit his resignation to the JSA Board of Directors. However, these resignations are regularly rejected. At level, referees suffer a penalty if they make more than nine mistakes in a year while -ranked are permitted up to ten. As for the other ranks in the hierarchy (below ), there are no financial penalties, but promotions are nevertheless affected.

In the ring, the follows a very specific protocol before the fight begins. The referee always supervises the proceedings from the north corner of the ring, facing south. After the has called them into the ring, the will also call out each wrestler&#x27;s name. On odd-numbered days, the call is made from the east to west, and on even-numbered days the call is made in the other way round. It is the &#x27;s responsibility to watch over the wrestlers as they go through the initial prebout staring contests (the ), during which he first stands facing the , the white starting lines in the centre of the ring, then sideways with the raised and in profile. When the preparation time is up, the referee receives a signal from the judge in charge of keeping time via the . The then places his flat against him, a gesture that signifies to the wrestlers that the fight must begin. The then coordinates the initial charge (or ) between the wrestlers. Immediately after the wrestlers initiate a that the deems acceptable, he will begin to referee the match. Although it is the wrestlers who ultimately determine the exact point at which the is initiated, if the two wrestlers&#x27; breathing is not synchronized or if one wrestler charges before they both put their hands down, the will notify them that they should wait before going ahead until both are ready or that the charge was a false start. If a false start has been ruled, the wrestlers must return to their starting positions and try another . 

The shouts that use in the ring are called , and are codified with no ad-libbing tolerated.

If the match time exceeds four minutes with little movement, the time-keeper will usually indicate to the to call for a , or water break. The then notifies the wrestlers to get out of the ring. He then records the exact positions of both wrestlers&#x27; hands and feet, and puts them back in this position once the break has concluded. The starts the fighting again by simultaneously hitting the backs of the wrestlers&#x27; . Although there are no strict rules on what to do when a match is paused, it was noted during the November 2023 tournament that a procedure inspired by then- referee Kimura Hisanosuke, consisting of using salt to mark the positions of the wrestlers&#x27; feet, was reused because it was considered elegant and effective. Additionally, the may call for a short break if he needs to fix a wrestler&#x27;s . The puts the cord in his mouth and swings it over his shoulder to dangle from his back. He then reties the loincloth. In the extremely rare event that a falls and exposes a wrestler&#x27;s nudity, the is expected to use his as a fig leaf to cover an exposed wrestler. Sometimes, during a particularly hectic match, the referee falls out of the ring or is accidentally knocked down by the wrestlers. If, following a fall, the is no longer able to give a verdict or hand out prize envelopes, it is up to the waiting at the foot of the ring to take his place.

When the considers that a wrestler has lost, he ends the match by pointing his to the side of the winning wrestler. The &#x27;s decision as to the winner of the bout is not immediately final and can be called into question by one of the five (judges) who sit around the ring. If they dispute the result, they hold a () in the center of the ring, and correspond through an earpiece to a further two judges in the video review room. They can confirm the decision of the (, &#x27;way of the &#x27;), overturn it (, &#x27;wrong indication&#x27;), or order a rematch (). The is not expected to take part in the discussion during a unless asked to do so. When a final verdict is reached, the again points his at the victorious wrestler and announces his , or ring name, in a clear voice. If the match had received corporate sponsorship and banners had been displayed before the start of the fight, the brings over the envelopes containing the money on his .

===Religious role===
In addition to refereeing matches, have a number of other duties, among them are their religious responsibilities in the sport. When a new ring is built, it is the &#x27;s responsibility to perform a (), or ring-consecration ceremony, a ritual to bless the space in which the wrestlers fight and train. The day before a , the Japan Sumo Association holds a religious ceremony in the presence of all the association&#x27;s higher-ups and all the -ranked wrestlers who take their seats around the ring. The same day, a more discreet ceremony is held in the stables&#x27; training rings by junior-ranked referees belonging to the same clan, in the presence of the stablemaster and the wrestlers. A simplified version of the ceremony also takes place during regional tours (called ). This practice, inherited from the Heian period, was restored by the Yoshida in the 1790s.

The is performed by one of the and two other senior-ranked referees, serving as attendants called . The act as Shinto priests and perform the ceremony taking the shape of a Shinto rite. The three , dressed in the same way as a , wear formal white robes (called ), larger hat, socks and straw sandals. The distinguishes himself by wearing a color variation under his white kimono and a instead of an . All of the carry a wooden instrument (called a ) as a symbol of authority. On the , (a Shinto ritual wand) are also placed in wooden stands at the center.

One of the &#x27;s two assistants first steps into the ring and behaves as if in a shrine, following Shinto etiquette. He then recites a prayer and walks around the four corners of the ring waving a sakaki tree branch serving as an at the attendants, in an act called . The then enters the ring and recites a prayer. This prayer to the three deities of sumo (Ame-no-Tajikarao, Takemikazuchi and Nomi no Sukune) and to the aspects of the seasons, is made for good weather throughout the tournament. This practice is inherited from a time when tournaments were held outdoors. The deities are also asked to bless all the wrestlers who will participate in the matches and keep them safe. The assistants in turn step into the ring and distribute the from the center of the ring to its four corners. Sake is then poured by the assistants into the four outer corners of the ring, following the shape of the wrestlers&#x27; (first left, then right, then center). After the assistants have stepped down from the ring, the recites a prayer called .

Placed on a , symbolic offerings are brought to the ring. They consist of dried chestnuts, washed rice, kelp, dried cuttlefish, kombu and nuts which are then poured into a hole in the center of the ring along some sake. The then pours sake into the four inner corners of the ring. The remaining sake is then offered to the Japan Sumo Association executives seated around the ring.

After the end of a tournament, a bring the tournament to an end with a religious ceremony. This ceremony, called , or &#x27;god sending ceremony&#x27;, is held the last day of a tournament to return the gods who had descended to the ring to heaven. One junior-ranked holding a will stand in the center of the ring and will be tossed into the air by lower-ranked wrestlers.

===Presiding over ring-entering ceremonies===
The also officially lead the ring-entering ceremonies. More precisely, the &#x27;s responsibility is to head the columns of -ranked wrestlers, leading them from the , the two paths from east and west, to the ring. If the is absent, the wrestlers are normally expected to wait to be led into the ring. The &#x27;s rank is equivalent to that of the wrestlers he leads. Each who presides over ring-entering ceremonies takes charge of only three or four per tournament, rotating with their colleagues of equivalent rank.

The enters the ring first, circles it and then settles in the center. The wrestlers, in ascending rank, follow him, and a at the foot of the ring announces the prefecture of origin (or country, in the case of foreign wrestlers), the stable to which they belong and the of the wrestler stepping onto the . When the last wrestler, ranked at the top of the or, in the case of the division, the , steps into the ring, the wrestlers turn to perform ritual gestures facing the center of the ring. The in the center waves the rope () of his in a circle.

During the &#x27;s ring-entering ceremony, the is also responsible for leading the wrestlers into the ring before the (the wrestler preceding the ). Normally, the presides over this ceremony. In the absence of a , the referee presiding over the ceremony will be a -ranked . The stands behind the , waving the rope of his as the makes his signature entrance (shiranui or unryū).

===Writing the ===

The are also responsible for writing up the , the traditional ranking sheet for professional sumo, and their task begins long before a definitive ranking is decided. The act as clerks at the ranking meetings, which take place three days after the end of each tournament. During the preparatory meeting, the serve only as observers and are not invited to speak. Three are responsible for recording decisions on promotions and demotions, and their work is then used as the basis for the calligraphy known to the public.

The did not start writing the until 1944; prior to this date it was often written by the elders of the association or by the professionals responsible for printing it. Only two or three high-ranking are authorised to write the , which will later be reproduced and actually used. This team is usually composed of one senior (usually ranked in ) and one or two assistants. The senior writer is usually also one of the attending the ranking meeting. Since World War II, only eight have been responsible for editing the . The task of writing the is considered so important that the people responsible for writing it never accompany the JSA on tour, so as to devote themselves entirely to their task.

In line with the calligraphic skills of the , the ranking is handwritten in a style called or . This style of writing is similar to that developed in the mid-18th century to write advertisements for kabuki plays. The official name of the style, , is derived from the name of a printer called Mikawa Jiemon who, in 1757, was in charge of printing the . He later became an elder of the association under the name Negishi, thus giving the name to the style he used when writing. The characters are written thickly and without gaps, which is meant to represent the hope that the tournament venue will be filled to capacity. Another interpretation of the size of the characters is that they imitate the imposing physique of the wrestlers.

Before each main tournament, it takes between seven and ten days to handwrite the . Each kanji is written with a brush without the help of word processors. are also expected to write the with their right hand. The original is called a . It is a large sheet of paper measuring metres by . The assistant draws the frame of the future banzuke on a blank sheet of paper, an operation that alone takes two days as everything is done by hand. In the lower left-hand section of the , the senior write vertically the sentence , a prayer for the wrestlers&#x27; safety in the ring. The writing then begins from bottom to top and from left to right, so as to start with the lowest ranks and end with the rank of . There is a tradition that for the smallest ranks, written in an extremely fine way, the use an old brush whose bristles have all fallen off and given by a who taught him. In total, around 830 names are handwritten. After being written up and proofread, the is sent to the printing works for photoengraving and printing on a format four times smaller than the original.

While the is written by senior , the is written by young referees. After the has been unveiled, between two and three ranked in gather to write on the high and wide wooden board traditionally hung at the entrance to tournament venues.

===Other tasks===
In line with their refereeing duties, the are also divided into departments within the Sumo Association, as are the elders. The distribution of in these departments depends on the and on a committee of three senior referees (currently ranked as and ) who are elected every two years by their peers.

For the , there are three departments with very specific tasks. The first department is the , named after the rooms in the Kokugikan. This department is responsible for recording the results of matches held the previous day on the scroll, to prepare for the work of the judging department, which will decide on future wrestler matchups for upcoming matches. The second department to which the belong is that of the referees who stand close to the ring during matches and announce over the microphone which (winning technique) have been used by the wrestlers. Since all referees are also expected to referee in the ring, a team of ten rotate with each other at the microphone for one day. In addition, the announcers are all from the Kantō region, so as to maintain a standard of intelligibility by avoiding accents. If the referee making the announcement did not see the technique used, he may contact the video referee to confirm it. The third department is entirely dedicated to the publication of wrestlers&#x27; results.

Once the matches have been decided, it is up to the to write up the sheets (called ) that will be presented after the ring entry ceremonies on tournament days.

The also make the plaques displayed on the electronic scoreboards in the arenas, on a thin rectangular sheet of plastic. Plaques are changed when a wrestler changes his or is promoted. In addition, are also responsible for the material organization of tours (called ). This takes place a year and a half in advance, and includes preparation of itineraries and accommodation.

Finally, as all are also associated with one of the sumo training stables throughout their career, they also have individual duties related to the stables such as performing clerical work.

==Controversies==
In January 2018, the 40th Shikimori Inosuke (whose real name is Itsuo Nōchi) was suspended for three tournaments for sexually harassing a junior referee. The Japan Sumo Association accepted his resignation in May 2018 when the suspension concluded.

Shortly after the announcement of promotions for the January 2024 grand sumo tournament, the 6th Kimura Tamajirō (from Tatsunami stable) submitted his retirement papers to the Sumo Association, ending a 47-year career. The day before, he did not appear on the list of referees promoted, even though he was the second most senior referee at the time and only two years away from retirement. Sasaki Ichirō, a sumo journalist at &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot;, shared an informal comment on his Twitter account expressing Tamajirō VI&#x27;s displeasure at not being promoted to the rank of .

In January 2025, -ranked Kimura Kankurō was suspended for the 2025 March tournament and was given a pay cut after he was found to have physically assaulted one of his apprentices during the 2024 November tournament. He had previously been excluded from the January tournament from day eight, when the internal investigation was launched.

<doc id="1047029" wikidata="Q1187228" url="?curid=1047029" title="Mrs. Ples">
<text>Mrs. Ples is the popular nickname for the most complete skull of an &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; ever found in South Africa. Many &quot;Australopithecus&quot; fossils have been found near Sterkfontein, about northwest of Johannesburg, in a region of Gauteng (part of the old Transvaal) now designated as the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site. Mrs. Ples was discovered by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson on April 18, 1947. Because of Broom&#x27;s use of dynamite and pickaxe while excavating, Mrs. Ples&#x27;s skull was blown into pieces and some fragments are missing. Nonetheless, Mrs./Mr. Ples is one of the most &quot;perfect&quot; pre-human skulls ever found. The skull is currently held at the Ditsong National Museum of Natural History in Pretoria.
The nickname &quot;Mrs. Ples&quot; was coined by Broom&#x27;s young co-workers. It derives from the scientific name &quot;Plesianthropus transvaalensis&quot; (near-man from the Transvaal), that Broom initially gave the skull, later subsumed (synonymized) into the species &quot;Australopithecus africanus.&quot; In scientific publications, the specimen is referred to by its catalogue number, STS 5.

The genus &quot;Australopithecus&quot;, of which there are several species, is considered the likely precursor of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;. Though its cranium is comparable to a chimpanzee&#x27;s, &quot;Australopithecus&quot; walked upright, as humans do. This was a surprise to anthropologists at the time, because it had been assumed that the big brain of &quot;Homo&quot; had preceded, or at least evolved in tandem with, our upright gait. Mrs. Ples, whose cranial capacity is only about , was one of the first fossils to reveal that upright walking had evolved well before any significant growth in brain size.

The sex of the specimen is not completely certain and so &quot;Mrs. Ples&quot; may in fact be &quot;Mr. Ples&quot;. Moreover, X-ray analysis of the specimen&#x27;s teeth (&quot;see below&quot;) has suggested it was an adolescent. Hence a designation of &quot;Miss Ples&quot; or &quot;Master Ples&quot; is also possible.

The paleoanthropologist Prof. Frederick E. Grine has studied the dental morphology of Mrs./Mr. Ples with a view to finally establishing Mrs./Ms. Ples&#x27;s sex. Using the Computed Tomography (CT) scans of STS 5 from the experiments of Weber et al., (2012) they compared them to CT scans of more recently discovered &quot;A. africanus&quot; skulls from Sterkfontein. These scans allowed Grine to reconstruct the roots of the teeth, in order to see how the molar and canine teeth developed. This study concluded that Mrs./Mr. Ples was indeed a middle-aged female. However, the question is not entirely settled, since other studies have come to the opposite conclusion.

Some experts have suggested that a partial skeleton, known only by its catalogue number of STS 14, which was discovered in the same year, in the same geological deposit and in proximity to Mrs. Ples, may belong to this skull. If correct, this would make Mrs. Ples the South African counterpart to the famous Lucy fossil. This skull, along with others discovered at Taung, Sterkfontein, and Makapansgat offered compelling evidence in favour of Charles Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis that humanity&#x27;s origin lay in Africa.

The fossil was originally dated by a combination of palaeomagnetism and uranium-lead techniques to 2.1-2.6 million years ago. A 2022 study dating surrounding rocks with a new methodology, stated their age as 3.4-3.7 million years old. But a more recent study, using the size of the teeth of &quot;Theropithecus oswaldi&quot;, concluded that there is no evidence that any of the South African cave sites are older than about 2.8 million years.

In 2004, Mrs. Ples was voted 95th in the SABC 3&#x27;s and e.tv&#x27;s &quot;Great South Africans&quot; Top 100 list.

<text>Pallacanestro Olimpia Milano, commonly known as Olimpia Milano or as EA7 Emporio Armani Milan after its title sponsor, is an LBA Italian professional basketball team, based in Milan, Italy. Its colors are white and red, and the team is sometimes referred as &quot;Scarpette Rosse&quot; (Little Red Shoes) because team officials imported red Converse All-Star shoes for players from the United States. The tag line stuck, and the nickname is still used by many fans today.

As per custom in the Italian league, sponsorship has kept the team name changing frequently. From 1930 until 1955, it was called Borletti Milano. From 1956 to 1973, it was renamed Simmenthal. Other famous sponsorship names were Billy, Simac, Tracer, and Philips, in the 1980s. For past club sponsorship names, see the list below.

Olimpia is the most successful basketball club in Italy and one of the most successful in Europe, having won 30 Italian League Championships, 8 Italian National Cups, 5 Italian Super Cups, 3 EuroLeague, 1 FIBA Intercontinental Cup, 3 FIBA Saporta Cups, 2 FIBA Korać Cups and many junior titles.

In 2016, the club was included in the Italian Basketball Hall of Fame.

==History==
===The birth and the Borletti era (1930–1955)===

The birth of Pallacanestro Olimpia Milano is traditionally dated 1936, year of the first Italian League Championship title won by the team. Actually it was founded 6 years earlier (in 1930) as &quot;Dopolavoro Borletti&quot; by Fratelli Borletti managers. Borletti team won 4 consecutive Italian League Championships from 1936 to 1939.

In 1947, Milan businessman Adolfo Bogoncelli merged Pallacanestro Como and Borletti to form a new society, commonly known as &quot;Borolimpia&quot;. &quot;Borletti&quot; brand was the main sponsor of the team, becoming the first sponsor in the history of Italian sport.

In 1955, after 9 Italian League Championships, Borletti brand leaves Olimpia Milano jersey.

=== The Simmenthal era (1956–1973) ===

The team regularly won the Italian League Championship in the 1950s and the 1960s, with players including Gabriele Vianello, Sandro Riminucci, Gianfranco Pieri, and Bill Bradley. In 1966, Olimpia won its first FIBA European Champions Cup.

In the 1970s, three teams were fighting across Europe for supremacy: Olimpia Milano, Ignis Varese, and Real Madrid. Pallacanestro Varese and Olimpia Milano were arch-rivals, as the two cities are 25 miles (40 km) apart. While Milano was a frequent Italian League champion, they were unable to win again the prestigious FIBA European Champions Cup. Late in the 1970s, the quality of the club declined, but Olimpia Milano still managed to win a FIBA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup.

In 1973, Simmenthal brand leaves Olimpia jersey after 17 years and 10 Italian League Championships.

===1974–2007===
In the 1970s through the 1980s, the team acquired several notable players, including the Boselli twins (Franco and Dino), Mike Sylvester, Chas Menatti, Dino Meneghin, Mike D&#x27;Antoni, John Gianelli, Roberto Premier. Bob McAdoo, Joe Barry Carroll, Russ Schoene, Antoine Carr, and Mike Brown. American head coach Dan Peterson led the team back to prominence.

In the 1980s, the team was sold to the Gabetti family. After this, they qualified for nine Serie A championships finals, winning five, with the 1987 team winning the Serie A title, the 1986–87 FIBA European Champions Cup (won also in 1988: both finals were won against Maccabi Tel Aviv), the Italian Cup and the 1987 FIBA Club World Cup. This gave the club the coveted &quot;Triple Crown&quot; and the even rarer &quot;Quadruple Crown&quot;.

Led by point guard Sasha Djordjević, the team won another FIBA Korać Cup in 1993. Bepi Stefanel purchased the team franchise in 1994, and signed-up notable European players like Dejan Bodiroga, Gregor Fučka, Sandro De Pol, and Nando Gentile. In 1996, the team won the Italian Cup and its 25th Italian National Championship, celebrating the 60th anniversary of the club.

Team management was inconsistent, as ownership groups from 1998 to 2004. Players of the team included Warren Kidd, Hugo Sconochini, Claudio Coldebella and Petar Naumoski. In 2005, owner Corbelli, which bought the club in 2002, from Sergio Tacchini, was flanked by Adriano Galliani (managing director of Italian Football club A.C. Milan), Massimo Moratti (President of rival club Internazionale), NBA star Kobe Bryant, and stylist Giorgio Armani, as sponsor with the Armani Jeans brand. After difficult years, led by coach Lino Lardo, Olimpia reached the national championship Finals, finally being beaten by Climamio Bologna.

On January 25, 2006, in the midst of a disappointing season in the EuroLeague and domestically, Djordjevic was named as the team&#x27;s new coach. He left as coach after the 2006–07 season, but not before securing Olimpia a berth in the 2007–08 Euroleague.

===2008–present===
In 2008, Giorgio Armani bought the team from Giorgio Corbelli, standing as the only owner, entirely changing the management structure, naming Livio Proli as president, and Lucio Zanca as general manager. Piero Bucchi was chosen to coach the new team, leading Olimpia twice to second place in LEGA Basket, being defeated by Montepaschi Siena in both cases.

In January 2011, after 23 years away from coaching, Dan Peterson came back from retirement at the request of team owner Giorgio Armani to replace Piero Bucchi, who was fired in mid-season. Peterson was hired on an interim basis and agreed to coach only the remainder of the season, in which he guided the team to the semi-finals. On June 9, Olimpia Milano announced Sergio Scariolo as new head coach for the 2011–12 season. The first player signed for the 2011–12 season was Omar Cook, an American-born play maker, who had played the previous season with Power Electronics Valencia. Owing to the NBA lockout, Danilo Gallinari went back to his alma mater, playing 15 games (8 in the Italian League, 7 in EuroLeague): he left the team in December.
Sergio Scariolo was replaced by Luca Banchi at the beginning of the 2013–14 season, and the team brought from Montepaschi Siena: David Moss, Kristjan Kangur, and Daniel Hackett.

The team reached the quarterfinals of EuroLeague, 16 years after its last appearance, but the team lost against the eventual league champions, Maccabi Tel Aviv. The team finished in the 1st position the LEGA Basket regular season, and in the 7th game of the playoff&#x27;s finals, Olimpia won its 26th Italian League championship title, its first after 18 years. Alessandro Gentile, the captain of Olimpia, was named MVP of the finals.

On June 29, 2017, Simone Pianigiani was hired as the new head coach and on June 15, 2018, Milano went to win his 28th title by beating Dolomiti Energia Trento in game 6 of the 2018 LBA Finals.

On June 11, 2019, legend Ettore Messina signed a deal as the new head coach of the club and president of all basketball operations for the following three seasons.

On May 4, 2021, the club reached the Euroleague Final Four after 29 years (1992 Final Four).

==Arenas==

===Secondary Arenas===

Olimpia Milano used the OND Borletti outdoor court of Via Costanza for almost 20 years. In the mid-1940s, they moved to the Palazzo dello Sport della Fiera, which had a seating capacity of 18,000 people, and was then the largest indoor sports arena in Europe, and second only to the Madison Square Garden in New York City. In 1960, the Palazzo dello Sport della Fiera was abandoned, and Olimpia moved into the original structure of the PalaLido, which then had a smaller seating capacity of 3,500, but because of lack of security measures at the time, often was filled with up to 10,000 people.

At the end of the 1970s, Olimpia moved into the newly built Palasport di San Siro, a multi-purpose facility built next to the Meazza Stadium, that was able to hold about 15,000 spectators. In 1985, the roof of the Palasport di San Siro collapsed and Olimpia returned to PalaLido for a season, waiting for the construction of a provisional arena. In 1986, they moved into the recently built 10,045 seat PalaTrussardi, where they played through the early 1990s.

The club then moved into its current home arena, the Mediolanum Forum, which has a seating capacity of 12,700. The club has also played some home games at the 6,700 seat PalaDesio. Recently, the club considered moving back to the newly rebuilt and modernized PalaLido (named Allianz Cloud), after it was remodeled, and had its seating capacity expanded. However, the club ultimately decided to continue using the Mediolanum Forum as its home arena, due to its much larger seating capacity, as compared to the new Allianz Cloud. However, the new arena is used when Mediolanum Forum is unavailable.

<text>Kiautschou Governor&#x27;s Hall () is the former German colonial government building at Qingdao, China.

==History==
The building was designed by the German architect Friedrich Mahlke (1871 – 1944) and was constructed during the years from 1904 to 1906. It was officially handed over to the administration on April 2, 1906. It has a gross space of 7,500 square meters.

The building originally served as the Kiautschou naval and civil government office and was known as &quot;Gouverneurspalast&quot;, or the Governor&#x27;s Palace. After the Siege of Tsingtao in 1914, the building became the Japanese occupation headquarters until 1922, when China regained sovereignty over its province. Before and during World War II, Jioazhou Governor&#x27;s Hall was again used by the Japanese as the seat of their occupation regime from 1938 to 1945. The building was subsequently used by the Kuomintang government and, after June 1949, by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It served as Qingdao&#x27;s townhall until 1992.

===Sopara===
Sopara (by some identified with the Ophir mentioned in the Hebrew texts) was an ancient port town and the capital of the ancient Aparanta. The ancient port of Sopara was the most important port in western India after the celebrated port of Cambay. The site of this ancient town is located near the present-day Nala Sopara. In ancient times, it was the largest township on India&#x27;s west coast, trading with Mesopotamia, Egypt, Cochin, Arabia and Eastern Africa.

The Mahabharata and the Puranas state that the was reclaimed from the sea for the dwelling place of Parashurama and it became a tirtha for this reason. The finding of the relics in a stupa and the rock edicts (the fragments of the 8th and 9th major rock edicts) of Ashoka in 1882 prove the importance of this port town from the 3rd century BCE to the 9th century CE. The Pali text Mahavamsa (VI, 46,47) states that the first king of the Sinhalese kingdom (now Sri Lanka), Vijaya sailed from Supparaka (Sopara) to Sri Lanka. Ptolemy mentioned this town as Soupara, and it was a major commercial centre during his time According to the Jaina writers, Shripala, a mythical king married Tilakasundari, daughter of king Mahasena of Soparaka. Jinaprabhasuri (14th century) in his &quot;Vividhatirthakalpa&quot; mentioned Soparaka as one of 84 Jaina tirthas (sacred places). He also mentioned an image of Rishabhadeva located in this city till his time.

The earliest reference occurs in Mahabharata as Shuparak. The Buddhist Suppara Jataka, believed to be of the 6th century BC, talks of Sopara as a prosperous port trading with ports of S.W.Asia, Gujarat, Malabar and Sri Lanka, its experts (navigation pilots- bodhisattvas), and the seas that they voyaged across. From about the third or fourth century BC precise historic data can be pieced together.

== Excavations at Sopara ==
In April 1882, Bhagvanlal Indraji, a noted archaeologist, numismatist and epigraphist excavated at the &quot;Burud Rajache Kot&quot; mound in Merdes village, near Sopara. The ruins of a Buddhist Stupa were found. From the center of the stupa (inside a brick-built chamber) a large stone coffer was excavated which contained eight bronze images of Maitreya Buddha which belong to the c. 8th-9th century CE. This coffer also enclosed relic caskets of copper, silver, stone, crystal and gold, along with numerous gold flowers and fragments of a begging bowl. A silver coin of Gautamiputra Satakarni (Satavahana) was also found from the mound. The Bombay Provincial Government presented the Sopara relics to the Asiatic Society of Bombay. The coins and the artifacts found during the excavations at the site of this ancient town can still be viewed in the Asiatic Society of Mumbai museum. In an old Muslim graveyard near Ramkund, the fragments of 8th and 9th major rock edicts of Asoka were found. These rock edicts can be viewed in the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Mumbai. The site was re-excavated by M.M.Qureshi of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1939–1940, when several stone lintels and two small stupas were found on the south side of the main stupa in addition to a few sherds of plain glazed ware of the Muslim period. Anwar Munshi (1972) found a number of Satavahana lead coins at Sopara. In 1956, a fragment of 11th major rock edict was found from a coastal village, Bhuigaon. During an excavation in 1993, a ring well, fragments of Roman Amphorae Red Polished Ware and Glass (all belong to the early centuries of the Common Era) were found.

The ancient habitation site lies 2 km away from the stupa which overlooks the dry creek on the south and on the east opens to Thane creek. A large quantity of Islamic Glazed Ware, Black and Red Ware were found at the site. It seems that during the Early Historical period, Sopara was located on the mainland facing Agashi island on the north and Bassein to the south. The backwaters between the mainland and the island were suitable for the movement and anchorage of ships. Gass and Nirmal villages were once part of the creek. A number of tanks and architectural remains are noticed in the areas adjoining these villages. All the ancient relics were found in the area between the stupa and the creek. Up to the 19th century, this creek was navigable and ships of 20 tonnes used to ply here. The significance of the architectural pieces becomes more important when the surface findings arc taken into account. The area around Bhatela Pond is a landing place or bunder, where even remains of a Portuguese jetty and customs house are seen. Exploration (1994) in the adjoining area has yielded Red Polished Ware and Glazed Ware. The evidence is further corroborated by a joint excavation in 1993 carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the British Academy, Hyderabad where antiquities of the Early Historical period (Satavahana and Kashatrapa period) – lead and copper coins, semi-precious stone beads, small fragments of Northern Black Polished Ware, amphorae pieces and Islamic Blue Glazed ware were discovered. An earthen wall and a fourteen coarse stone wall with varying sizes of stone blocks were also encountered during this excavation.

It is clearly evident from the archaeological and literary sources that Sopara was the main entrepot dating from the pre-Asokan period up to the 3rd century A.D. and again from 9th to 13th century A.D. There is no evidence of cultural remains from 4th to 9th century and it seems that during this period Sopara had lost its importance. The main cause for the decline of the ancient port of Sopara was due to the effect of siltation caused by a rise in sea level. Further near-shore and off-shore marine archaeological exploration and excavation would be helpful to ascertain the extent of the ancient port city.

== Sopara Edicts of Ashoka ==

The following are translations of the fragments of the edicts found at Sopara by Bhagavan Lal Indraji in 1882. In these edicts, Ashoka refers to himself as &quot;Devanampiya&quot;(Beloved of The Gods) and &quot;Piyadassi&quot; (The handsome one).

===8th Major Rock Edict===
&quot;In the past, kings went on pleasure tours, which consisted of hunts and other similar amusements. The Beloved of the Gods, the king Piyadassi, when he had been consecrated for 10 years, went to the tree of Enlightenment. From that time arose the practice of tours connected with Dhamma, during which meetings are held with ascetics and brahmans, gifts are bestowed, meetings are arranged with aged folk, gold is distributed, meetings with people of the countryside are held, instruction in Dhamma is given, and questions on Dhamma are answered. The Beloved of the Gods, the king Piyadassi, derives more pleasure from this, than from any other enjoyments.&quot;

===9th Major Rock Edict===
&quot;Thus speaks the Beloved of the Gods, the king Piyadassi: People practice various ceremonies in illness, at the marriage of sons and daughters, at the birth of children, when going on a journey on these and on other similar occasions people perform many ceremonies. Women especially perform a variety of ceremonies, which are trivial and useless. If such ceremonies must be performed they have but small results. But the one ceremony which has great value is that of Dhamma. This ceremony includes regard for slaves and servants, respect for teachers, restrained behaviour towards living beings, and donations to sramanas and brahmans – these and similar practices are called the ceremony of Dhamma. So father, son, brother, master, friend, acquaintance and neighbour should think,&#x27;This is virtuous, this is the ceremony I should practice, until my object is achieved.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The French Imperial Eagle (, ) was a figure carried into battle as a standard by the &quot;Grande Armée&quot; of Napoleon I during the Napoleonic Wars.

Although they were presented with regimental colours, Napoleon&#x27;s regiments tended to carry at their head the Imperial Eagle.

==History==

On 5 December 1804, three days after his coronation, Napoleon I distributed &quot;aigles&quot; based on the eagle standards of the Roman legions. The standards represented the regiments raised by the various departments of France, and were intended to institute feelings of pride and loyalty among the troops who would be the backbone of Napoleon&#x27;s new Imperial regime. Napoleon gave an emotional speech in which he insisted that troops should defend the standards with their lives. This event was depicted in &quot;The Distribution of the Eagle Standards&quot;, an 1810 painting by Jacques-Louis David.

The original design was sculpted by Antoine-Denis Chaudet and then copies were cast in the workshop of Pierre-Philippe Thomire, with the first eagles presented on 5 December 1804. It was a bronze sculpture of an eagle on a plinth, with one claw resting on &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s spindle&quot;. weighing , mounted on top of the blue regimental flagpole. They were made from six separately cast pieces designed along Roman lines and, when assembled, measured in height and in width. On the base would be the regiment&#x27;s number or, in the case of the Imperial Guard, &quot;Garde Impériale&quot;. The eagle bore the same significance to French Imperial regiments as the colours did to British regiments - to lose the eagle would bring shame to the regiment, who had pledged to defend it to the death. Upon Napoleon&#x27;s fall, the restored monarchy of King Louis XVIII ordered all eagles to be destroyed; only a very small number were preserved. When the former emperor returned to power in 1815 (known as the Hundred Days), he immediately had more eagles produced, although the quality did not match the originals. The workmanship was of a lesser quality and the main distinguishing changes had the new models with closed beaks and they were set in a more crouched posture.

===Captured eagles===

The first capture of an eagle was most likely during the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 when the Russian cavalry of the guard under Grand Duke Konstantin overran the French 4th &quot;Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot;, taking their flag. Although Napoleon won the battle, the Russians were able to retreat in good order and the eagle was not recovered, much to the emperor&#x27;s regret.

In 1807, at Heilsberg, the was overthrown by Prussian cavalry and Russian infantry. An eagle was lost and several officers, including a colonel, were killed. The eagle was captured by NCO Anton Antonov of the . Prussian historians dispute this, claiming that the Prittwitz Hussars captured the eagle.

In 1807, near Eylau, the lost its flag and eagle to the Russian . In 1812, at Krasnoi, the 18th &quot;Régiment d&#x27;Infanterie de Ligne&quot; again lost its eagle and was &quot;virtually destroyed&quot; by the Russian .

In 1808, at the Battle of Bailén, an entire French corps led by General Pierre Dupont surrendered after being defeated by a Spanish army led by generals Francisco Javier Castaños and Theodor von Reding; this was the first surrender of an Imperial field army. As part of the capitulation terms, the French gave up their flags and banners, including three eagles. These eagles were kept in the Cathedral of Seville until they were recovered by the French in 1810 and sent back to Paris.


The first French eagles to be captured by the British were taken during the Invasion of Martinique including the Eagle of the 82nd French Regiment of the Line. Subsequently the 87th Regiment of Foot took an Imperial Eagle at the Battle of Barrosa on 5 March 1811. At Barrosa, Ensign Edward Keogh and Sergeant Patrick Masterson captured the French Imperial Eagle of the . Keogh only managed to get a hand on the shaft when he was shot, bayoneted, and killed. Masterson took over and, after killing several men, wrenched the Eagle from the dying hands of its bearer, Lieutenant Gazan. (His great grandson was decorated with the Victoria Cross 90 years later.)

The eagle was taken back to the United Kingdom and put on display in the Royal Hospital Chelsea. It was around 10 inches tall, set on a plinth marked with the numeral &quot;8&quot;. It was made of silver, but gilded, which led many to think it was solid gold. In fact, the only golden part of the eagle was a laurel wreath which hung around its neck. This wreath was an honour conferred upon the 8th Regiment by Napoleon himself, and was not common to all eagles at the time. The gold leaves were presented to a number of regiments that were present at the Battle of Austerlitz by the city of Paris. The eagle&#x27;s right claw was raised. Beneath it should have been a thunderbolt but, on the 87th&#x27;s trophy, it was missing. It is believed to have been dislodged during its capture.

Several years later, the eagle was stolen from the Royal Hospital. It was broken from its staff and smuggled away to an unknown fate. Many rumours abounded, the strongest being that it had been repatriated by a Frenchman. More likely it was melted down and sold. The original staff is still held in the Royal Irish Fusiliers Museum, located in the Sovereign&#x27;s House on The Mall in Armagh, Northern Ireland.

The British took two eagles at the Battle of Salamanca in July 1812. Ensign John Pratt of the Light Company of the 30th Regiment of Foot (later 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment) captured the eagle of the (displayed today in the Lancashire Infantry Museum at Fulwood Barracks in Preston, Lancashire), while Lieutenant William Pearce of the 2nd Battalion of the 44th Regiment of Foot took the eagle of the (displayed today in the Chelmsford Museum in Essex).

Following the surrender of the French at the capture of Madrid on 14 August 1812, two eagles were found belonging to the 13th &quot;Régiment de Dragons&quot; and the .

Two of the newer French regimental eagles were captured during the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. The French I Corps under the command of the &quot;Comte d&#x27;Erlon&quot; was charged by the British heavy cavalry, commanded by the Earl of Uxbridge; the 1st The Royal Dragoons captured the eagle of the ; (now held at the National Army Museum, Chelsea) and Sergeant Charles Ewart of the Royal Scots Greys captured the eagle of the (now held at the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Museum in Edinburgh Castle).

Before the Duke of Wellington died in 1852, he had asked that all his battle trophies be carried at his funeral. As the eagle captured by the 87th Regiment of Foot was not available, it was decided to make a replica. The mould was made by Garrard&#x27;s and was designed from a sketch of the original drawn by an officer of the 87th at the time of Barrosa.

The capture of an eagle was celebrated through the addition of the eagle as a symbol or accoutrement to a regiment&#x27;s colour or uniform. The Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons) (descended from the 1st Royal Dragoons) and the Royal Anglian Regiment (descended from the 44th Foot) both wear the eagle as an arm badge, while the cap badge of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers and Greys) (descended from the Royal Scots Greys) is an eagle. The Royal Irish Regiment wear the eagle of the 8th on the back pouch of the officers&#x27; black cross belt.

A French Imperial Eagle, which had belonged to the , was among the items stolen in 1990 from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. The 1st &quot;Régiment de Grenadiers&quot; had formed two squares at the Battle of Waterloo, one of which was formed around Napoleon himself. In May 2015, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum offered a reward of $100,000 for the safe return of the Eagle which remains missing.

<text>The William Brown Library and Museum is a Grade II* listed building situated on the historic William Brown Street in Liverpool, England. The building currently houses part of the World Museum Liverpool and Liverpool Central Library.

The William Brown Library and Museum building was conceived as a replacement for the Derby Museum (containing the Earl of Derby&#x27;s natural history collection) which then shared two rooms on the city&#x27;s &quot;Duke Street&quot; with a library. The land for the building on what was then called &quot;Shaw&#x27;s Brow&quot; as well as much of the funding was provided by local MP and merchant Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet of Astrop, in whose honour the street was renamed.

Following on from the then-recently completed St. George&#x27;s Hall across the street, the new building was designed by Thomas Allom in a classical style including Corinthian columns and was modified by the Liverpool Corporation architect John Weightman. The new building opened its doors in 1860 with 400,000 people attending the opening ceremony.

With Liverpool being one of the country&#x27;s key ports, much of the city was badly damaged by German bombing during the Second World War and William Brown Library and Museum were no exception. Hit by firebombs during the blitz in 1941, the building was ravaged by fire and much of the building had to be rebuilt. Key parts of the museum&#x27;s collection had been previously moved to less vulnerable locations and damage to those avoided.

Plans have now been brought forward to redevelop the library, replacing the post–World War II additions with state-of-the-art facilities.

<doc id="1047044" wikidata="Q930495" url="?curid=1047044" title="Mercedes-Benz Sprinter">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is a light commercial vehicle (van) built by Mercedes-Benz Group AG of Stuttgart, Germany as a large van, chassis cab, minibus, and pickup truck. In the past, the Sprinter had been sold under the Mercedes-Benz, Dodge, and Freightliner nameplates. In the U.S., it was built from complete knock down (CKD) kits by Freightliner. Re-badged and re-engined Sprinters were also sold by Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles as the Volkswagen LT and the Volkswagen Crafter. They are now primarily marketed by Mercedes-Benz.

In the Mercedes-Benz van lineup, the Sprinter is the largest model offered, followed by the mid-size Vito (aka Viano, V-Class, and EQV) and small Citan.


==First generation (1995–2006, T1N)==

===Europe===
The first generation Sprinter was launched in Europe in 1995 to replace the famous but outdated T1 Transporter van dating from 1977. Compared to the T1, the Sprinter had reduced the aerodynamic drag and moved the engine further forward to increase cabin space. It was the first Mercedes-Benz product to carry a name rather than an alphanumeric designation. It was released with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with an antilock braking system and was driven by the most powerful diesel engine in its class, with a power output of . The Sprinter was voted International Van of the Year for 1995.

The styling was updated in 2000 and 2002, accompanied by technical changes that included standard electronic stability control (2002).

===North America===
The first generation (VA chassis) North American Sprinter was launched for the 2002 model year in the U.S. and was originally branded as a Freightliner. In 2003, it received Dodge branding, as DaimlerChrysler chose to replace the aging Dodge Ram van with the Sprinter rather than redesign it. After 2003, they were sold concurrently under the Freightliner and Dodge nameplates, and were identical except for minor styling details and badging. DaimlerChrysler chose not to badge the Sprinter as a Mercedes-Benz, because it felt the utilitarian Sprinter would interfere with the luxury image that the Mercedes-Benz brand had in North America, and instead used the Freightliner and Dodge nameplates, as both of those brands had more experience selling trucks and commercial vehicles.

Cargo versions of the Sprinter were manufactured in Düsseldorf, Germany, partially disassembled, and then shipped to a Freightliner factory in Gaffney, South Carolina, where they were reassembled. The cargo versions, classified as light trucks, are subject to the 25% chicken tax if imported as a complete unit, which is avoided by the disassembly and importation as a semi knock-down kit, with subsequent reassembly in the U.S. Passenger vans were not subject to the same tax classifications and were imported as an assembled unit through Mercedes-Benz in Jacksonville, Florida.

2002–2003 Sprinters sold in North America were only available with the 2.7L OM612 inline-5 diesel engine, and were only available in 49 states as it was not compliant with CARB emissions standards; 2004–2006 models used the OM647 engine, which replaced the OM612&#x27;s air-cooled EGR valve with a water-cooled unit, among other changes, which made the 2004–2006 Sprinters CARB-compliant. The only transmission offered in North America was the 5-speed 5G-Tronic transmission.

The product was launched and supported by DaimlerChrysler Vans LLC, a small division based in Huntersville, North Carolina. Key individuals from DaimlerChrysler Commercial Vehicle Division and Freightliner Trucks were selected to spearhead the effort and made up the bulk of the division. DaimlerChrysler Vans LLC retained sole responsibility for the North American Sprinter market until the sales, service and parts support responsibilities were absorbed by Chrysler Commercial Vehicle Division in 2004. Nearly all of the original staff were retained, though the base of operations shifted from North Carolina to Auburn Hills, Michigan.

===Japan===
The Sprinter van was sold as the Mercedes-Benz Transporter T1N due to Toyota using the name Toyota Sprinter, a version of the Corolla.

===Iran===
The model &quot;314&quot; of the first generation is still assembled by Iran Khodro Diesel. It is used as an ambulance.

===Vietnam===
The first generation Sprinter was assembled by Mercedes Benz Vietnam in Ho Chi Minh City from CKD kits to avoid high local import duties.

===Sprinter Classic===
Since 2013, the 2000–2006 Sprinter model has been revived in Russian markets only as the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Classic. The Phase II 2002–2006 grille was chosen for use on the Sprinter Classic and the 2000–2006 dashboard design. The Sprinter Classic used the steering wheel from the 2006–2014 Sprinter models. The Sprinter Classic is built by the Gorky Automobile Plant at Nizhny Novgorod for service in Russian/Eastern European markets only.

;Notes
===Fuel economy===
With 2.7L I5 OM 612/OM 647 156 hp CDI engine:
===Diesel Hybrid Concepts===
In 2004, A Plug-in hybrid prototype version and a non-plug-in hybrid prototype version of the van were made, The plug-in van had an electric motor with an output of 70 kW (93.87 hp) and an NiMH battery with a capacity of 14kWh. Which supported an all-electric operating range of up to 30 kilometers (18 miles). The battery recharged from the plug-in to the main power supply in approximately 6 hours. the non-plug-in van had a smaller electric motor with an output of 30 kW (40.23 hp) and smaller batteries with a capacity of only 3 kWh. These allowed purely electric operation with a range of 3 to 4 km (1.8 to 2.4 miles).

==Second generation (2006–2018, NCV3)==
===Initial release===

The second-generation Sprinter was introduced in Europe in 2006. It was voted Van of the Year for 2007 and again in 2008 by Professional Van and Light Truck Magazine.

Also known as the NCV3 or New Concept Van 3, the second generation Sprinter appeared in Europe and in other countries as the 2006 model year. North America received its own NCV3 for the 2007 model year.

By 2010 a BlueTEC version of the NCV3 Sprinter with the OM642 was released. The BlueTEC systems allowed the elimination of much of the EGR in that vehicle&#x27;s engine, which as a result gave compared to the non-BlueTec engine&#x27;s .

The U.S. cargo version of the 906 NCV3 came in two wheelbase options (144&quot;, 170&quot;), two roof heights (standard 60.6&quot;, high 72.4&quot;), three lengths (Short 233.3&quot;, Standard 274.2, Extended 289.8&quot;), and two weight classes (2500, 3500). 3500 models had the option of dual rear wheels or extra-wide &quot;super single&quot; wheels in some, but not all, markets. Neither the 128&quot; wheelbase nor the rear super single tires were available in the U.S. market. The U.S. cargo version was reassembled from kits in an assembly plant located in Ladson, South Carolina, while the passenger models were imported directly from Germany.

The second-generation 906 was produced in Argentina only for export markets—except Mercosur markets (Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay)—from 2007 until 2010, but in 2011, announced new production of the second generation in the Centro Industrial J. Manuel Fangio, in Buenos Aires with the brand-new OM 651 engine (also locally made) and exported to the rest of South America (including Mercosur markets). Since 2012, it has been manufactured for the Mercosur and 40 other countries. 70% of its production is exported.

===Production===
The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter was built in Daimler&#x27;s Mercedes-Benz Düsseldorf and Ludwigsfelde production plants.

For the second-generation Sprinter marketed in the United States, to avoid &quot;chicken tax&quot; import duties, the cargo version was disassembled partially, shipped to the United States, and reassembled at a plant in Ladson, South Carolina (near North Charleston), in a process known as semi knock-down assembly (SKD), starting in June 2006; the passenger version continued to be imported as a complete unit. The Ladson factory previously was used as an American LaFrance factory for firefighting trucks. The previous SKD reassembly facility in Gaffney resumed operations under Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation. The Ladson plant was known as DaimlerChrysler Manufacturing International until the parent corporation was dissolved; importation and SKD reassembly of the Sprinter cargo van continued at Ladson under the auspices of Mercedes-Benz Vans, LLC.

Between July 2013 and the end of May 2014, Mercedes-Benz Vans sold around 134,000 units of the new model of Mercedes-Benz Sprinter in Europe and North America.

The production version of the Sprinter-based Volkswagen Crafter by Mercedes-Benz Vans was set to end in 2016.

A class action lawsuit was filed in California state court against Mercedes-Benz alleging the defendant had sold Mercedes-Benz Sprinter 2500 and 3500 models with water that leaked from the roof air conditioning unit into the passenger area. The leaking air conditioning unit was also discovered on Dodge Sprinters made by Mercedes-Benz from 2003 through 2009. The lawsuit affected California residents with the rooftop AC units and Sprinters equipped with the rear AC.

====Algeria====
From 2014, Algeria started manufacturing the latest model of Sprinter 319/519 4×2 and 4×4 for civilian and military use.

===Marketing===
Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans were used in the Boost by Mercedes-Benz custom transportation program.

===Updates===

====Sprinter (2013–2019)====

The second generation Sprinter was updated in 2013 with changes including the addition of new assistance systems (crosswind stabilization, collision avoidance system (optional), blind spot monitor (optional), adaptive highbeam, lane departure warning system), Euro VI emissions compliance, redesigned radiator grille, more angular headlights, new upholstery and seat coverings, thicker steering wheel, optional fresh air nozzles boast chrome applications, new-generation radio system.

====2014 facelift====
For the 2014 model year, the Sprinter received an updated grille with Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s signature three-slat design. In an effort to make the Sprinter&#x27;s fuel economy more competitive, North American models received the 2.1L OM651 two-stage turbo diesel engine formerly only available overseas, along with an optional 3.0L engine. The 2.1L engine (and in Europe, also the 3.0L) was mated to a new 7-speed automatic transmission. A 1.8L supercharged I-4 gasoline engine was mated to 6- and 7- speed automatic transmissions. The 2014 Sprinter added several new driver assistance technologies including standard Crosswind Assist, optional Blind Spot Assist and Collision Prevention Assist, as well as Lane Keeping Assist and Highbeam Assist. The 2014 Sprinter began offering LED running lights. Air suspension was an available option on the 3500-series model. The 2014 Sprinter also gained navigation, iPod integration, and an air suspension for heavier-duty models.

== Third generation (2019–present, VS30) ==
The third-generation Sprinter debuted on 6 February 2018, at the Mercedes-Benz logistics center in Duisburg and was available to purchase from June 2018. It is the first generation to include a front-wheel-drive van in the line-up. A new range of standard and optional technology and comfort features were made available.

To prepare for the third-generation van, in 2015, Mercedes-Benz Vans decided to switch North American Sprinter production to complete knock-down kit (CKD) assembly, kicking off an expansion of the Ladson factory in 2016, and the first Ladson-built Sprinter rolled off the assembly line in September 2018. The Freightliner version was discontinued after the 2021 model year as part of the Daimler Truck divestment in the Freightliner brand in October 2021.

The third generation Sprinter was updated for the 2023 model year in the U.S., offering a new, all-time all-wheel-drive option with retirement of the selectable &quot;4×4&quot; option; additionally, a 2.0L 4-cylinder OM654 engine replaced the previous diesel engines with standard and high-output tunings offered. Power steering was updated to electromechanical from hydraulic.

In Spring 2024 the European market front wheel drive variant (designation 910) that had been available from the third generation launch was discontinued. Front wheel drive Sprinters can be visually distinguished by their unique wheelbase which is different to all others (see how the rear wheels are pushed closer to the rear bumper).

===eSprinter===

The first eSprinter was announced in February 2018. It is a large battery-electric van based on the third-generation Sprinter with a unique front-wheel drive chassis; production of the eSprinter commenced at Düsseldorf in December 2019 for European markets. It is equipped with one of two batteries, with a usable/gross battery capacity of 35/41 (3 modules) or 47/55 kW-hr (4 modules), and is driven by an electric traction motor with an output of and . Initially, it was available exclusively as a high-roof panel van with a cargo capacity of .

Winter endurance testing under arctic conditions reduced range to . The production vehicles have an estimated range of for the 41 or 55 kW-hr batteries, giving an energy consumption of , respectively, under Directive 692/2008/EC test requirements. The gross vehicle weight rating is ; given the maximum payload is for the 55 or 41 kW-hr battery, respectively, the kerb weight is , and a single battery module is estimated to weigh .

====eSprinter 2.0====
One year after eSprinter production started, Mercedes-Benz announced its successor in December 2020. The second-generation eSprinter 2.0 will be released in late 2023. It is based on the Mercedes-Benz &quot;Electric Versatility Platform&quot; (EVP), a bespoke chassis designed for large vans; EVP shifts the traction motor to the rear axle and enables Mercedes-Benz to offer variants, including pickup truck, chassis cab, and cutaway versions. Three different battery capacities will be available, as Mercedes is aiming to double the range of the Europe-only first generation eSprinter. Production is scheduled to start in the second half of 2023 at the three Sprinter factories: Ladson; Düsseldorf; and Ludwigsfelde.

In October 2022, a preproduction extra-long, high-roof eSprinter 2.0 was driven for on a single charge, taking a roundtrip journey from the Mercedes-Benz Museum to the Munich Airport and back. The computed energy consumption was and the eSprinter indicated there were of range remaining when the trip was completed, giving an estimated usable battery capacity of 108.5 kW-hr.

;Notes
==Uses==

The Sprinter is designed primarily for business, not private users, although recreational vehicle (RV) conversions are available. In the United States, the first generation Sprinters (2001–2006) were offered solely with the Mercedes-Benz 2.7 litre straight 5 cylinder turbocharged Diesel.

Companies are replacing van conversions with wide bus bodies—Sprinters with side-facing benches and tall right-side doors—as campus shuttles. Limited numbers of complete &quot;wagons&quot; (passenger vans) are being produced in Germany and shipped complete to the United States mostly for personal and church van uses. Typical Sprinter wagons accommodate 8 to 10 passengers and have glass in all possible factory positions. Vans shipped to the United States on-spec (speculation to sell by dealer/distributor) are mostly sent in Arctic White color, but many colors are available. The Dodge dealer network for Sprinters is limited to certified locations (known as &quot;Business Link&quot; certified dealers, usually only awarded to &quot;Five Star&quot; certified dealers), and dealer knowledge is still limited in both sales and service. Special orders typically take one to three months for delivery, and may take even longer due to the assembly and disassembly in Germany, and exporting parts to South Carolina for re-assembly. The exception is passenger van models which are assembled in Germany and exported as complete vehicles. This is because of the United States Chicken Tax. As an unintended consequence, several importers of light trucks have circumvented the tariff via loopholes, known as tariff engineering. Ford (ostensibly a company that the tax was designed to protect), imported its first-generation Transit Connect light trucks as &quot;passenger vehicles&quot; to the U.S. from Turkey, and immediately stripped and shredded portions of their interiors (e.g., installed rear seats, seatbelts) in a warehouse outside Baltimore. To import vans built in Germany, Mercedes-Benz &quot;disassembled them and shipped the pieces to South Carolina, where American workers put them back together in a small kit assembly building.&quot; The resulting vehicles emerge as locally manufactured, free from the tariff.
In North America, most Sprinters are sold as cargo vans to expediters in the United States. Such expediters are similar to truck drivers, except they take smaller loads and will wait after unloading until dispatchers find another customer nearby to transport goods. The advent of the Sprinter van with its cargo space of has allowed van expediters to take three skids or pallets, where previously they were limited to a capacity of two pallets. A Sprinter is capable of hauling approximately of cargo. The vehicle has been adopted by the police in Hong Kong, United Kingdom and in Poland, and also as an ambulance by countries in Western Europe, Scandinavia, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. The 515 CDI has become the standard ambulance for use by the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom, and the Health Service Executive (HSE) &amp; Dublin Fire Brigade Ambulance Service in the Republic of Ireland.

Another market in which Sprinters are gaining ground is as van conversions and recreational vehicles. Conversions include RVs, limousines, family and luxury vans, office vans, wheelchair accessible vans and golf vans. Sprinter RV conversions can also be called Sprinter campervans. Sprinter conversions have been produced by several RV and coach manufacturers. Chilled box versions of the Sprinter currently make up the majority of the supermarket Home Delivery fleet across the UK, but demand for these vans has begun to decline. ASDA recently announced that its new fleet would be primarily custom IVECO vans, following in the footsteps of Tesco. Ocado &amp; retail partner Morrisons are primarily taking delivery of Ford Transits for their newer fleet. Mercedes are currently working with Waitrose Home Delivery, who currently use chilled LWB HR Sprinters, on a prototype of a new generation home-delivery van, which is currently being used in select stores, aiming to cut emissions, costs and increase time efficiency.

Sprinters have been used globally as television production vehicles, most commonly as ENG (Electronic News Gathering) and SNG (Satellite News Gathering) vehicles. These are a popular choice for local affiliates for their maneuverability in metropolitan areas and the lack of DOT regulations (in the under 10,000 lbs versions).

Despite not being marketed as a family vehicle, a custom-modified Dodge-branded Sprinter was used by the ten-member Gosselin family, the subjects of the TLC reality series &quot;Jon &amp; Kate Plus 8&quot;.

In Colombia, the Sprinter is the most popular van for intercity transport. The purchase of a luxuriously appointed Sprinter by the son of former President Julio Cesar Turbay, Julio Cesar Turbay, Jr. prompted a scandal.

A Mercedes Sprinter was the vehicle used by Mike and Frank on the History Channel reality series &quot;American Pickers&quot; until Season 6, when it was replaced by a Ford Transit.

The van is also used as a mobile command center by the Garda Síochána which is the national police force of the Republic of Ireland.

A chassis of the Sprinter is also expected to be used for the upcoming Astrovan II which will be made by Airstream to transport Boeing commercial crew astronauts to Cape Canaveral Space Launch Complex 41 where they would board the CST-100 Starliner on their way to the International Space Station.

==Passenger minibuses==
Although primarily marketed as a goods van, the Sprinter has 5 variants designed to carry passengers. These are made by removing parts of the walls and replacing them with glass window panels.

===Sprinter Mobility===

This is the smallest of the Sprinter minibuses. There are 4 sub-variants: the 23, 33, 35, and 45. It has 8-18 seats and is 6.9-7.4 metres long. It has 4 doors: 1 on either side of the driver and front passenger seats (which, like in a van, are segregated from the main passenger compartment), a sliding door in the middle, which goes into the rear passenger seating area, and a set of double doors at the back going into the disabled area with an elevator that can be extended out of the doors when they are open.

It is designed for paratransit.

===Sprinter Transfer===

This minibus is a longer variant of the Sprinter Mobility where the front passenger seat has been removed and the front passenger seat door now acts as the door for all passengers. In addition, the back wall has seats along it, but can be opened as a door and the seats removed to make modifications to the interior of the vehicle. It comes in 5 sub-variants: 23, 34, 35, 45, and 55. It has 13-22 seats and is 5.9-7.7 metres long.

It is designed for bus services to hamlets.

===Sprinter Travel===
This bus has a high-floor, and in addition to the driver&#x27;s door, has just 1 automatic passenger door with steps. It is 7.4-7.7 metres long and has 17-19 seats.

It is marketed as a mini-coach.

===Sprinter Inkanyezi===
The Sprinter Inkanyezi is marketed in South Africa from 2020s onward as minibus taxi fleet in the country. The car is powered by a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine and can carry 23 passengers.

===Sprinter City===
The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter City minibus variant has been in production since 1995 and is marketed through EvoBus. The Freightliner variant has been in production since 2007.

<doc id="1047046" wikidata="Q2487341" url="?curid=1047046" title="Virar">
<text>Virar (Pronunciation: ) is a coastal city in Palghar district, Maharashtra. The northern third of the city of Vasai-Virar, it is administered by Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation. It lies to the south of Palghar district, and to the north of the city of Mumbai. It is an important part of Palghar District because Palghar is the outermost part of northern side of Mumbai Metropolitan Region and comes under police jurisdiction of Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar Police Commissionerate.

Virar railway station is one of the prominent railway stations on the Western Line of Mumbai Suburban Railway being the station on the line with high frequency of local-train transit for both ends, Palghar (Dahanu) as well as Churchgate (South Mumbai).

As per provisional reports of Census of India, population of Virar in 2011 was 1,222,390; of which male and female were 648,172 and 574,218 respectively.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 India census, Virar had a population of 1,221,233. Virar has an average literacy rate of 91.95%, higher than the national average of 59.5%.

Over a period of time Virar has become a suburb with approximately 50% population being Marathi speaking and the rest a mix of other communities, mainly the Gujaratis and the Catholics. 70% of the population is below 30 years. The slow and gradual adoption of the cosmopolitan nature of the city is the result of migration from the Mumbai mainland to this part due to ever increasing cost of the real estate property.

Among minority languages, Gujarati is spoken by 28.30% of the population and Hindi by 15.31%. The local Communities like Samvedi Brahmin, Kupari, Vadwals, Bhandhari, Panmali, Aagri have their local dialects of Konkani which are widely spoken in these communities.

==Infrastructure==
The growth of Virar is yet to be seen in full as the quadrupling of the railway line between Borivali and Virar has just taken place in 2007. The railways are still pleading the lack of sufficient number of rakes to take full advantage of the quadrupling.

The global city developed by rustomjee and evershine builders is a big township spread over an area of more than 200 acers leading to significant development and new settlements.

The city has seen a lot of development in the past 5 years. The Municipal Council was upgraded to Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation in May 2009. There are various housing and road transport development projects initiated by the corporation with the help of MMRDA, Mumbai. The skywalk in the west section of the city was one of the first amongst the many skywalks that were built near all the railway stations of Mumbai. It was the seventh skywalk in the city and it cost INR 91.5 million. Virar-West skywalk is 589 meters long with four meters wide walkway. The skywalk was found to be the busiest amongst the others built by the MMRDA by recording a footfall of 58,038 commuters during peak hours. It was followed by Santa Cruz skywalk with a figure of 37,546.

Virar-Alibaug Corridor Project is a project undertaken by the MMRDA. The Rs 10,000-crore project is expected to provide seamless connectivity by the metro as well as by road from Alibaug to Virar. The corridor will bypass the western and eastern suburbs and also the routes which will witness growth in the future. The proposed alignment will connect four crucial national highways, NH8 (Mumbai-Ahmedabad), NH3 (Mumbai-Agra-Delhi), NH4 (Mumbai-Chennai) and NH17 (Goa-Mangalore-Kerala). The MMRDA has claimed that the 140-km corridor will reduce the long commute to barely an hour. Phase-I of the corridor will be of 90 km from Virar to Panvel. Phase-II will be of 50 km from Panvel to Alibaug.

==Governance==
Virar falls under the jurisdiction of the newly created Vasai-Virar Municipal Corporation (VVMC). It primarily comes in the Nalla Sopara constituency for the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections and in the Palghar constituency for the Lok Sabha elections. For all the three seats, the ruling party, Bahujan Vikas Aaghadi (BVA) has showed its dominance over the past few decades. The BVA has won 55 seats out of the 89 in the VVMC; thus Virar elected its first Mayor in the form of Shri. Rajeev Patil who was also the ex-President of the preceding Virar Municipal Council. For the Legislative Assembly seat, Kshitij Thakur, a BVA candidate and the son of ex-MLA of the region, Hitendra Thakur, won the seat in 2009, defeating Shirish Chavan of the Shiv Sena by more than 40,000 votes at just 26 years of age. Earlier in the 15th Lok Sabha elections, people voted for Baliram Sukur Jadhav, also a BVA candidate, from the Palghar constituency, who went on to become the member of parliament representing the region, defeating a Bharatiya Janata Party rival, advocate Chintaman Vanga, by 12,358 votes.

<text>The American Nuclear Society (ANS) is an international, not-for-profit organization of scientists, engineers, and industry professionals that promote the field of nuclear engineering and related disciplines.

ANS is composed of three communities: professional divisions, local sections/plant branches, and student sections. Individual members consist of fellows, professional members, and student members. Various organization members are also included in the Society including corporations, governmental agencies, educational institutions, and associations.

As of spring 2024, ANS is composed of more than 10,000 members from more than 40 countries. ANS is also a member of the International Nuclear Societies Council (INSC).

Professional Divisions within the American Nuclear Society focus on specific technical domains, encompassing 18 areas and the Young Members Group. They provide members with specialized engagement opportunities in nuclear science and technology. ANS members can join any number of these divisions. Their activities are coordinated by the Professional Divisions Committee. Topics covered by the divisions range from Accelerator Applications to Fusion Energy and more.

The main objectives of ANS are to provide professional development opportunities for members, engage and inform the public and students about the benefits of nuclear technology, encourage innovation in the nuclear field, and advocate effectively for nuclear technology at both domestic and international levels.

== History ==
The American Nuclear Society was founded in 1954 as a not-for-profit association to promote the growing nuclear field. Shortly thereafter in 1955, ANS held its first annual meeting and elected Walter Zinn as its first president. Originally headquartered in space provided by the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies (ORINS), the Society&#x27;s headquarters were moved to various locations over the years until 1977, when the Society settled into its own building in La Grange Park, Illinois. Since 2024, the Society has been headquartered in Westmont, Illinois.

The American Nuclear Society published &quot;Fusion technology: a journal of the American Nuclear Society and the European Nuclear Society&quot; from 1984 to 2001.

<doc id="1047051" wikidata="Q705722" url="?curid=1047051" title="Oswald Chambers">
<text>Oswald Chambers (24 July 187415 November 1917) was an early-twentieth-century Scottish Baptist evangelist and teacher who was aligned with the Holiness Movement. He is best known for the daily devotional &quot;My Utmost for His Highest&quot;.

==Youth and education==
Born to devout parents in Aberdeen, Scotland, Chambers moved with his family in 1876 to Stoke-on-Trent when his father, Clarence Chambers, became Home Missions evangelist for the North Staffordshire Baptist Association, then to Perth, Scotland when his father returned to the pastorate, and finally to London in 1889, when Clarence was appointed Traveling Secretary of the Baptist Total Abstinence Association. At 16, Oswald Chambers was baptized and became a member of Rye Lane Baptist Chapel. Even as a teenager, Chambers was noted for his deep spirituality, and he participated in the evangelization of poor occupants of local lodging houses. Chambers also demonstrated gifts in both music and art.

From 1893 to 1895, Chambers studied at the National Art Training School, now the Royal College of Art and was offered a scholarship for further study, which he declined. For the next two years he continued his study of art at the University of Edinburgh while being greatly influenced by the preaching of Alexander Whyte, pastor of Free St. George&#x27;s Church. While at Edinburgh, he felt called to ministry, and he left for Dunoon College, a small theological training school near Glasgow, founded by the Rev. Duncan MacGregor. Chambers was soon teaching classes at the school and took over much of the administration when MacGregor was injured in 1898.

==Holiness minister==
While teaching at Dunoon, Chambers was influenced by Richard Reader Harris, KC, a prominent barrister and founder of the Pentecostal League of Prayer. In 1905, Reader introduced Chambers as &quot;a new speaker of exceptional power.&quot; Through the League, Chambers also met Juji Nakada, a Holiness evangelist from Japan, who stimulated Chambers&#x27; growing interest in world evangelism. In 1906, Nakada and Chambers sailed for Japan via the United States. In 1907, Chambers spent a semester teaching at God&#x27;s Bible School, a Holiness institution in Cincinnati, then spent a few months in Japan working with Charles Cowman, a co-founder of the Oriental Missionary Society.

Arriving back in Britain by the end of the year, Chambers found the Holiness movement divided by the advocates and opponents of founding a new denomination and by supporters and detractors of the tongues movement. Chambers did not oppose glossolalia but criticized those who made it a test of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.

Sailing back to the United States in 1908, Chambers became better acquainted with Gertrude Hobbs, the daughter of friends, whom he had known casually. They married in May 1910; and on 24 May 1913, Gertrude (whom Chambers affectionately called &quot;Biddy&quot;) gave birth to their only child, Kathleen. Even before they married, Chambers considered a partnership in ministry in which Biddy—who could take shorthand at 250 words per minute—would transcribe and type his sermons and lessons into written form.

==Bible Training College==
In 1911 Chambers founded and was principal of the Bible Training College in Clapham Common, Greater London, in an &quot;embarrassingly elegant&quot; property that had been purchased by the Pentecostal League of Prayer. Chambers accommodated not only students of every age, education, and class but also anyone in need, believing he ought to &quot;give to everyone who asks.&quot; &quot;No one was ever turned away from the door and whatever the person asked for, whether money, a winter overcoat, or a meal, was given.&quot; Between 1911 and 1915, 106 resident students attended the Bible Training College, and by July 1915, forty were serving as missionaries. 

==YMCA chaplain==
In 1915, a year after the outbreak of World War I, Chambers suspended the operation of the school and was accepted as a YMCA chaplain. He was assigned to Zeitoun, Cairo, Egypt, where he ministered to Australian and New Zealand troops, who later participated in the Battle of Gallipoli. Chambers raised the spiritual tone of a center intended by both the military and the YMCA to be simply an institution of social service providing wholesome alternatives to the brothels of Cairo. When he told a group of fellow YMCA workers that he had decided to abandon concerts and movies for Bible classes, they predicted the exodus of soldiers from his facilities. &quot;What the skeptics had not considered was Chamber&#x27;s unusual personal appeal, his gift in speaking, and his genuine concern for the men.&quot; Soon his wooden-framed &quot;hut&quot; was packed with hundreds of soldiers listening attentively to messages such as &quot;What Is the Good of Prayer?&quot; Confronted by a soldier who said, &quot;I can&#x27;t stand religious people,&quot; Chambers replied, &quot;Neither can I.&quot; Chambers irritated his YMCA superiors by giving away refreshments that the organization believed should be sold so as not to raise expectations elsewhere. Chambers installed a contribution box but refused to ask soldiers to pay for tea and cakes.

==Death and influence==
Chambers was stricken with appendicitis on 17 October 1917, but resisted going to a hospital on the grounds that the beds would be needed by men wounded in the long-expected Third Battle of Gaza. On 29 October, a surgeon performed an emergency appendectomy; however, Chambers died 15 November 1917 from a pulmonary hemorrhage. He was buried in Cairo with full military honors.

Before he died, Chambers had proofread the manuscript of his first book, &quot;Baffled to Fight Better&quot;, a title he had taken from a favorite line by Robert Browning. For the remainder of her life—and at first under very straitened circumstances—Chambers&#x27; widow transcribed and published books and articles edited from the notes she had taken in shorthand during the Bible College years and at Zeitoun. Most successful of the thirty books was &quot;My Utmost for His Highest (1924)&quot;, a daily devotional composed of 365 selections of Chamber&#x27;s talks, each of about 500 words. The work has never been out of print and has been translated into 39 languages.

==Awards and recognition==

Chambers House, one of the four academic student houses of the YMCA of Hong Kong Christian College, was founded by YMCA of Hong Kong, and was explicitly named to commemorate Chambers; other houses are named for J. Hudson Taylor, Robert Morrison, and YMCA founder George Williams.

<text>Howard Browne (April 15, 1908 – October 28, 1999) was an American science fiction editor and mystery writer. He also wrote for several television series and films. Some of his work appeared over the pseudonyms John Evans, Alexander Blade, Lawrence Chandler, Ivar Jorgensen, and Lee Francis.

==Biography==
Beginning in 1942, Browne worked as managing editor for Ziff Davis publications on &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, both under Raymond A. Palmer&#x27;s editorship. When Palmer left the magazines in 1949, Browne took over in January 1950. Browne ended the publication of Richard Shaver&#x27;s Shaver Mystery and oversaw the change in &quot;Amazing&quot; from a pulp magazine to a digest. He left the magazines in 1956 to move to Hollywood.

In Hollywood, Browne wrote for television shows including &quot;Maverick&quot; (&quot;The Seventh Hand&quot; with James Garner and Diane Brewster among nine other episodes), &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, and &quot;The Virginian&quot;. His last credit was for the film &quot;Capone&quot; (1975), starring Ben Gazzara.

Browne&#x27;s novel &quot;Thin Air&quot; was twice adapted for television. In 1975 it was used as the basis for a first-season episode of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; titled &quot;Sleight of Hand.&quot; In 1982 it was the basis for a second-season episode of &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; of the same name as the novel.

<doc id="1047056" wikidata="Q875215" url="?curid=1047056" title="HDV">
<text>HDV is a format for recording of high-definition video on DV videocassette tape. The format was originally developed by JVC and supported by Sony, Canon, and Sharp. The four companies formed the HDV Consortium in September 2003.

Conceived as an affordable high definition format for digital camcorders, HDV quickly caught on with many amateur and professional videographers due to its low cost, portability, and image quality acceptable for many professional productions.

HDV and HDV logo are trademarks of JVC and Sony.

==Video and audio coding==
HDV video and audio are encoded in digital form, using lossy inter frame compression. Video is encoded with the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 compression scheme, using 8-bit chroma and luma samples with 4:2:0 chroma subsampling. Stereo audio is encoded with the MPEG-1 Layer 2 compression scheme. The compressed audio and video are multiplexed into an MPEG-2 transport stream, which is typically recorded onto magnetic tape, but can also be stored in a computer file.

The data rate for both the audio and video is constant and is roughly the same as DV data rate. The relatively low video data rate can cause &quot;bit rate starvation&quot; in scenes that have much fine detail, rapid movement or other complex activity like flashing lights, and may result in visible artifacts, such as blockiness and blurring. In contrast to the video, HDV audio bitrate is relatively generous. At the coded bitrate of 384 kbit/s, MPEG-1 Layer 2 audio is regarded as &quot;perceptually lossless&quot;.

==Recording formats==
Two major versions of HDV are &quot;HDV 720p&quot; and &quot;HDV 1080i&quot;. The former is used by JVC and is informally known as &quot;HDV1&quot;. The latter is preferred by Sony and Canon and is sometimes referred to as &quot;HDV2&quot;. The &quot;HDV 1080i&quot; defines optional progressive recording modes, and in recent publications is sometimes called &quot;HDV 1080&quot; or &quot;1080-line HDV&quot; as progressive 1080-line recording becomes commonplace.

=== HDV 720p ===
HDV 720p format allows recording high definition video (HDV-HD) as well as progressive-scan standard definition video (HDV-SD).

HDV-HD closely matches broadcast 720p progressive scan video standard in terms of scanning type, frame size, aspect ratio and data rate. Earlier HDV 720p camcorders could shoot only at 24, 25 and 30 frames per second. Later models offer both film-like (24p, 25p, 30p) and reality-like (50p, 60p) frame rates.

HDV-SD is a mode for recording progressive-scan standard definition video. Such a video is sometimes called &quot;enhanced definition video&quot; (EDTV), but is considered high definition video in Australia. Depending on region, HDV-SD video is recorded either as 576p50 or as 480p60. Like DVCPRO Progressive, HDV-SD was meant as an intermediate format during the transition time from standard definition to high definition video. Later models of HDV 720p camcorders do not record in this mode.

JVC was the only manufacturer of HDV 720p camcorders. JVC was the first to release an HDV camcorder, the handheld GR-HD1. Later JVC shifted its HDV development to shoulder-mounted cameras.

A common misconception is that JVC developed a proprietary extension to HDV called ProHD, featuring film-like 24-frame/s progressive recording mode and LPCM audio, for professional use. JVC has clarified that ProHD is not a video recording format, but &quot;an approach for delivering affordable HD products&quot; and a common name for &quot;bandwidth efficient professional HD models&quot;.

=== HDV 1080i ===

Sony adapted HDV, originally conceived as progressive-scan format by JVC, to interlaced video. Interlaced video has been a useful compromise for decades due to its ability to display motion smoothly while reducing recording and transmission bandwidth. Interlaced video is still being used in acquisition and broadcast, but interlaced display devices are being phased out. Modern flat-panel television sets that utilize plasma and LCD technology are inherently progressive. All modern computer monitors use progressive scanning as well. 

Before interlaced video is displayed on a progressive-scan device it must be converted to progressive using the process known as deinterlacing. Progressive-scan television sets employ built-in deinterlacing circuits to cope with interlaced broadcast signal, but computer video players rarely have this capability (especially modern ones, since progressive video is much more common these days). As such, interlaced video may exhibit ghosting or combing artifacts when watched on a computer.

Some HDV 1080i camcorders are capable of recording progressive video within an interlaced stream, provided that the frame rate does not exceed half of the field rate. The first HDV 1080i camcorder to implement such &quot;Progressive Scanning&quot; was the Sony HVR-V1. To preserve compatibility with interlaced equipment the HVR-V1 records and outputs video in interlaced form. 25-frame/s and 30-frame/s progressive video is recorded on tape using progressive segmented frame (PsF) technique, while 24-frame/s recording employs 2-3 pulldown. The camcorder offers two variations of 24-frame/s recording: &quot;24&quot; and &quot;24A&quot;. In &quot;24&quot; mode the camera ensures that there are no cadence breaks for a whole tape, this mode works better for watching video directly from the camera and for adding &quot;film look&quot; to interlaced video. In the &quot;24A&quot; mode the camera starts every clip on an A frame with timecode set to an even second margin and records the 2-3 pull-down identification data in the HDV stream, so that compatible NLE software knows when to remove the 2-3 pull-down cadences. Several editing tools, including Sony&#x27;s own Vegas, are capable of processing 24A video as proper 24 frame/s progressive video.

Prior to the HVR-V1, Sony was offering &quot;Cineframe&quot;, essentially an interlaced-to-progressive converter, to simulate film-like motion. The conversion process involved blending and discarding fields, so vertical resolution of the resulting video suffered. Motion, produced in the 24-frame/s variant of Cineframe was too uneven for professional use. The same or better film look effect can be achieved by converting regular interlaced video into progressive format using computer software.

In 2007 Canon commoditized progressive scanning, releasing the HV20 camcorder. The version for 50 Hz market featured PF25 mode with PsF-like recording, while the version for 60 Hz market had PF24 mode, which utilized 2-3 pulldown scheme. Progressive scan video recorded with the HV20 does not include flags necessary for performing automated film-mode deinterlacing, which is why most editing tools treat such video as interlaced. The HV30, released in 2008, implemented additional PsF-like PF30 mode for 60 Hz markets. Output is performed via component, HDMI and FireWire in interlaced form.

Progressive scan video must be properly deinterlaced to achieve full vertical resolution and to avoid interlace artifacts. 25P and 30P video must be deinterlaced with &quot;weave&quot; or &quot;no deinterlacing&quot; algorithm, which means joining two fields of each frame together into one progressive frame. This operation can be done in most editing tools simply by changing project properties from interlaced to progressive. 24P video must go through &quot;film-mode deinterlacing&quot; also known as inverse telecine, which throws out judder frames and restores original 24-frame/s progressive video. Many editing tools cannot perform film-mode deinterlacing, requiring usage of a separate converter.

=== HDV 1080p ===

The original 1080-line HDV specification defined interlaced recording only, which is suitable for television broadcast. As users have become increasingly interested in digital cinematography and in web videos, progressive recording became a necessity. In response to this need, capability for native progressive recording has been added to the 1080i HDV specification. Progressive recording modes are optional for 1080i HDV devices, which means that not every HDV 1080i camcorder or deck is capable of recording or playing back native progressive video. Because HDV 1080i specification now includes both interlaced and progressive recording modes, in recent publications it is often called &quot;HDV 1080&quot; or &quot;1080-line HDV&quot;, but the official name still bears the &quot;i&quot; suffix.

HDV camcorders capable of native 1080-line progressive video record it at rates of 23.98 frame/s (commonly referred to as &quot;24p&quot;) and 29.97 frame/s (&quot;30p&quot;) for 60 Hz markets, and at 25 frame/s (&quot;25p&quot;) for 50 Hz markets. Video is output as true progressive video via an i.LINK/FireWire port. Output through other ports is performed in interlaced mode to preserve compatibility with existing interlaced equipment.

The first 1080-line HDV camcorder to offer recording in native progressive format was the Canon XL H1, introduced in 2006. It was followed by the XH-G1 and XH-A1. When shooting in progressive mode, also known as &quot;Frame mode&quot;, these camcorders generate progressive video from interlaced CCD sensors. Because of row-pair summation, vertical resolution of progressive video is 10–25% lower than resolution of interlaced video.

In 2008 Sony released its own models capable of native progressive recording: the HVR-S270, the HVR-Z7 and the HVR-Z5. Sony stressed out that the models handle the signal entirely in progressive mode all the way from capture to encoding to recording on tape to output. Sony has designed &quot;Native Progressive Recording&quot; logo for the devices that are capable of native progressive recording and playback.

In 2009 Canon released the HV40 HDV camcorder. Its 60 Hz variant, carrying prominent &quot;24p native progressive&quot; mark, became the first consumer HDV model to offer 24-frame/s native progressive recording. Like the aforementioned Sony models, the HV40 uses true progressive-scan sensor.

Despite differences in branding, native progressive modes offered by Canon and Sony are fully compatible, with both companies adhering to HDV specifications for recording native 1080p video. Other HDV devices capable of reading and recording in native progressive 1080-line format include the Sony HVR-M15AU, HVR-25AU, HVR-M15AE, HVR-25AE and HVR-M35 HDV videocassette recorders, and the 60 Hz Canon HV20/HV30 camcorders when used in tape recorder mode.

==Compatibility==

Generally, HDV devices are capable of playing and recording in DV format, though this is not required by HDV specification. Many HDV devices manufactured by Sony are capable of playing and recording in DVCAM format. 1080-line devices generally are not compatible with 720-line devices, though some standalone tape decks accept both HDV flavors. Devices that can play and record native 1080p video can play and record native 1080i video, however the opposite is not always the case.

HDV camcorders are usually offered with either 50 Hz or 60 Hz scanning rate depending on a region. Some models, like Canon XH-A1/G1 and third-generation Sony models such as HVR-S270, HVR-Z5 and HVR-Z7, can be made switchable for &quot;world&quot; capability. Some JVC ProHD products like the GY-HD200UB and GY-HD250U are world-capable out of the box.

HDV is closely related to XDCAM and to TOD families of recording formats, which use the same video encoding — MPEG-2. In particular, HDV 720p is equivalent to 19 Mbit/s XDCAM EX recording mode used in tapeless JVC ProHD camcorders, while HDV 1080i is equivalent to 25 Mbit/s XDCAM HD recording mode and to &quot;1440CBR&quot; TOD recording mode.

== Recording media ==

The HDV Consortium allows using the HDV trademarks only for products that incorporate a tape drive that can record and play video cassette compliant to the HDV format. Therefore, HDV remains a tape-based format. Various solutions for tapeless recording of HDV video that are available on the market are not covered by HDV specification.

=== Magnetic tape ===

Most HDV camcorders use &quot;small&quot; DV cassettes also known as MiniDV cassettes. The Sony HVR-S270 shoulder-mount camcorder is capable of recording both onto &quot;small&quot; and &quot;large&quot; cassettes. Because HDV has the same data rate as DV, recording time is the same as DV Standard Play. Unlike DV, HDV does not offer Long Play speed.

A standard MiniDV cassette provides one hour of recording. By using cassettes with longer and thinner tape it is possible to record up to 80 minutes onto one MiniDV cassette, though usage of such tape is not recommended. A large DV cassette loaded with longer tape can deliver up to 4.5 hours of recording time.

Tape manufacturers also offer MiniDV cassettes specifically for HDV recording. Such cassettes have the same Metal Evaporate (ME) formulation as normal DV cassettes, but are claimed to have reduced drop-out rate compared to standard DV cassettes. Usage of such cassettes is not required by HDV specification.

=== File-based media ===

Since HDV had been introduced, &quot;tapeless&quot; — or &quot;file-based&quot; — video recording formats such as DVCPRO P2, XDCAM and AVCHD have gained broad acceptance. The trend towards tapeless workflow accelerated with increased capacity and reduced cost of non-linear media like hard disk drives (HDD), optical discs and solid-state memory.

Recognizing the need for faster workflow, JVC, Sony and other manufacturers offer on-camera recording units, which convert an HDV camcorder into a hybrid system capable of recording both onto tape and onto file-based media. These recorders connect to a camcorder via FireWire and do not recompress HDV video, offering exactly the same image quality as if video were recorded on tape.

JVC offers two FireStore recorders made by Focus Enhancements: the HDD-based DR-HD100 and MR-HD100 on-camera recorders; it also offers the SxS-based KA-MR100G recorder. Canon offers Focus Enhancements FS-CF and FS-CF Pro models, which record onto CompactFlash memory cards. Sony offers the HDD-based HVR-DR60 and the CompactFlash-based HVR-MRC1K recorders.

Recording time depends on capacity of media used. In particular, a 32 GB CompactFlash card is good for 144 minutes of HDV video. The HVR-DR60 can fit over two hours of high definition video, while the FireStore models with 100 GB disk drive can store almost four hours of footage. File-based recorders are invaluable for continuous recording that extends one hour.

== Use in broadcast television ==

HDV is accepted for broadcast TV use with varying restrictions.

Discovery Channel chose HDV handhelds for shooting &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; despite their reduced light sensitivity and a large depth of focus, because smaller cameras were better for crew safety and they destroy several dozen cameras per series. HDV camcorders were also used for shooting &quot;MythBusters&quot;. 

In 2006 KRON San Francisco purchased 52 Sony HVR-Z1U HDV camcorders. According to chief engineer Craig Porter, the cameras proved reliable. The station formed a group of &quot;video journalists&quot; or &quot;one-man bands&quot;, who would use a Z1 camcorder, Toughbook laptop and Edius editing software to report, shoot and edit their own stories. After the station was moved to smaller cameras, it became possible for the journalists to travel in compact cars, which were 10 to 15 times cheaper than traditional large ENG vans.

In February 2009 ITV News bought 68 Sony HVR-Z5E handheld camcorders for its multi-skilling journalists. The camcorders, which come with non-removable 20x lens and outfitted with CompactFlash recorders became popular among journalists who are not trained camera operators.

In the TV series &quot;JAG&quot; made for CBS, handheld HDV camcorders were used for scenes where larger HD cameras would have been impractical. 

The BBC does not consider HDV to meet HD broadcast standards, therefore acceptability of HDV footage for HD programming is limited to 25% of the program&#x27;s total duration.

The Discovery HD Theater accepted content sourced from 1080-line HDV camcorders, but limited it to 15% of a whole program. Producers wishing to use HDV were required to submit an approved postproduction path outlining their handling of the footage in the editing process. The Discovery Channel HD simulcast had fewer or no guidelines and accepted a mix of XDCAM HD, HDV and AVCHD for the length of a program. For example, Discovery Channel aired &quot;911: The Bronx&quot;, a six-episode reality series set in a hospital and shot with HDV cameras. Several episodes of &quot;Survivorman&quot; were shot with the Sony HVR-Z1U and HDR-HC3 camcorders. 

The Discovery Channel International used rating system that defines Gold, Silver and Bronze acquisition and delivery levels. Depending on particular camera make and model and on post-production process, HDV footage could be rated as Silver HD, Bronze HD, or widescreen SD. In particular, some users considered Canon HDV camcorders to deliver the best-looking image with the least amount of compression artifacts among the models having 25 Mbit/s MPEG-2 HD codec.

The PBS accepts HDV for widescreen programming acquisition and to a limited extent for use in HD programs. PBS may allow usage of &quot;less than full broadcast quality equipment&quot; if compression artifacts are &quot;not obvious when viewed on an HDTV monitor&quot;. For example, the Art Wolfe&#x27;s TV series &quot;Travels to the Edge&quot; was produced for PBS in HDV format using Canon XL-H1 camcorders.

The Travel Channel HD eagerly accepts HDV footage. For example, Sony HDV camcorders were used for production of highly acclaimed Anthony Bourdain&#x27;s &quot;No Reservations&quot; program, among other cameras. &quot;Bizarre Foods with Andrew Zimmern&quot; and its follow-up &quot;Bizarre World&quot; are shot with Sony HDV cameras as well. &quot;Madventures&quot; was shot with the Sony EX1 XDCAM EX camera paired with the Sony HVR-A1U HDV camcorder.

Current TV used Sony HDV camcorders to shoot episodes for Vanguard TV series.

&quot;Guiding Light&quot;, the longest-running soap opera in production in television and radio history, broke away from traditional three-sided sets and pedestal-style cameras in 2008, choosing the handheld Canon XH-G1 in standard definition mode for shooting on practical locations until the show was canceled in 2009.

==Editing==
Because HDV video is recorded in digital form, original content can be copied onto another tape or &quot;captured&quot; to a computer for editing without quality degradation. Depending on capturing software and computer&#x27;s file system, either a whole tape is captured into one contiguous file, or the video is split in smaller 4 GB or 2 GB segments, or a separate file is created for each take. The way files are named depends on capturing software. Some systems convert HDV video into proprietary &quot;intermediate&quot; format on the fly while capturing, so original format is not preserved.

HDV footage can be natively edited by most non-linear editors, with real-time playback being possible on modern mainstream personal computers. Slower computers may exhibit reduced performance compared to other formats such as DV because of high resolution and interframe compression of HDV video.

Editing performance can be improved by converting HDV to intermediate format prior to editing. These include various Cineform products, Edius HQ, Avid DNxHD, Apple Intermediate Codec and Apple ProRes 422, among others. Usage of an intermediate codec adds one more &quot;generation&quot; to the video, potentially degrading its quality. On another hand, an intermediate codec can reduce blockiness and fix other issues in the original video, like interlaced chroma in progressive recordings. 

Depending on the non-linear editing system (NLE), it is possible to minimize generation losses by editing native HDV video using straight cuts only, with no effects, and rendering back to HDV. Up to 15 frames per each cut may be re-encoded because of the long-GOP nature of HDV video.

==Distributing==

HDV video can be recorded or &quot;printed&quot; back to tape. Such tapes are often accepted by local television stations, though many organizations prefer the submissions to be delivered in higher-end format like Digital Betacam, HDCAM or D5 HD. It is also possible to record M2TS file to any media that offers enough capacity, like a DVD, external HDD drive or a memory card.

For consumer use, HDV-sourced video can be delivered on a Blu-ray Disc without re-encoding, can be converted to AVCHD and delivered on an AVCHD disc, or can be downconverted to DVD-Video.

== Products ==
=== Canon ===

Canon entered the HDV market in September 2005, with the Canon XL H1, a professional-oriented modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, HD-SDI output, and three 1440 × 1080 ⅓&quot; CCDs. This was the first HDV camcorder to allow 1080-line native progressive recording.
In July 2006, Canon announced the handheld XH A1/XH G1 models, which use the same sensor as the XL-H1. Both models share the same body and most of the features, with the XH G1 geared towards professional multi-camera production and including connections for HD-SDI/SD-SDI Out, genlock, and time code. 

Later in the same year, Canon introduced the consumer-oriented Canon HV10, a compact unit with a single 2.76 megapixel CMOS sensor. The camera recorded interlaced video only.

In April 2007 Canon released the HV20 which used the same sensor and internal processor as the HV10, had a larger lens and more conventional layout. This was the first consumer HDV camcorder that featured progressive shooting modes in addition to native interlaced recording. Progressive-scan video was recorded within interlaced container to remain compatible with consumer level editing suites. The version for 50 Hz market offered PF25 mode, which utilized Progressive segmented Frame technique, while the 60 Hz variant featured PF24 mode, which utilized 2-3 pulldown scheme. 

The HV30, released in 2008, was a minor update of the HV20. The body color has been changed from silver to black, the LCD screen has been improved, and the 60 Hz variant implemented PsF-like PF30 mode.

In 2009 Canon released the HV40. Its 50 Hz variant was practically identical to the HV30, while the 60 Hz variant became the first consumer HDV camcorder capable of native progressive 24 frames/s recording.

=== JVC ===
In 2003 JVC released the first HDV camcorder — the handheld GR-HD1. The camcorder offered standard DV recording mode, HDV 720p30 and HDV 480p60. The HDV modes used the older Rec. 601 standard for color space, rather than the newer Rec. 709 standard intended for high-definition video. The imager of the GR-HD1 used a single 1/3&quot; CCD sensor instead of a 3CCD setup, another unusual choice discouraging professional use. The GR-HD1 was not popular in either the consumer or semi-professional market, and JVC later shifted its HDV development to professional shoulder-mounted cameras.

The shoulder mount GY-HD100 camcorder was released in 2005 and featured 3CCD imaging system with native 720p resolution, interchangeable lens and 24 frame/s recording. Because of the latter feature this camcorder became popular for shooting &quot;digital movies&quot;. The updated version, GY-HD110, provides several updates and fixed split-screen effect found on some GY-HD100 cameras.

The GY-HD200, released later, offered 50p/60p recording, 720p-to-1080i converter and Anton Bauer professional battery with mount.

In 2006 JVC released the GY-HD250, which simplified multi-camera recording by providing genlock and time code input/output. HD/SD-SDI output allowed to record uncompressed video.

In 2008 the &quot;B&quot; modification of the GY-HD200 was released, allowing live recording of either 720p or 1080i signal onto an external tapeless recorder. Recording to tape was still performed in 720p mode only.

=== Sharp===
Sharp is the only member of the HDV Consortium that has not produced an HDV camcorder or a videocassette recorder. The closest Sharp has ever got in supporting HDV standard is the AQUOS DV-ACV52 digital video player. The player supports HDV video, though it does not have a tape transport. Instead, it allows playback and dubbing of DV/HDV video from a camcorder connected to the player via a FireWire connector.

=== Sony ===

Sony specializes in 1080i HDV equipment and makes products for both 60 Hz and 50 Hz markets. Traditionally, Sony uses suffixes &quot;E&quot; and &quot;P&quot; to identify 50 Hz models, and suffix &quot;U&quot; or no suffix at all to identify 60 Hz models. Models listed below are specified without suffixes.

In September 2004 Sony released the first HDV 1080i camcorder, the HDR-FX1. Its professional version, the HVR-Z1, came with XLR audio inputs and 44 additional features. Most notably, the HVR-Z1 was switchable between 50 Hz and 60 Hz scanning to cater for the different scanning rates used in different markets.

In the middle of 2005 Sony released its first consumer HDV model, the HDR-HC1, which had a single CMOS sensor, electronic stabilization system and was capable of recording in DV and HDV 1080i modes. Its professional version, the HVR-A1, added a second accessory shoe in place of the flash, XLR audio inputs, additional recording options, larger eyecup and larger lens hood. 

In 2006 Sony replaced the HDR-HC1 with the smaller and cheaper HDR-HC3, which featured an incrementally improved CMOS chip, but omitted some features of its predecessor. The HDR-HC3 was replaced by the HDR-HC5 which used the same CMOS chip as the HDR-HC3, and added an option of recording in xvYCC color space. The replacement model, the HDR-HC7 came with a higher pixel count CMOS sensor and with a microphone input. Like the HDR-HC5, the HDR-HC7 could also record xvYCC. In 2008 the HDR-HC7 was replaced with the HDR-HC9.

In 2006, Sony added two new models to its upscale HDV lineup: the &quot;advanced amateur&quot; HDR-FX7 and its professional cousin, the HVR-V1. The progressive-scan CMOS sensors of these models resolve full 1080 lines of vertical resolution. The HDR-FX7 records interlaced video only, while the HVR-V1 offers the choice of shooting interlaced or progressive video. Progressive video is converted to interlaced using pulldown for recording onto tape.

In August 2007, Sony introduced the shoulder-mounted version of the HDR-HC7, the HVR-HD1000.

In November 2007, Sony announced the HVR-Z7 handheld camcorder and the HVR-S270 shoulder-mounted camera. Both use the same three 1/3&quot; ClearVid CMOS sensors and attain light sensitivity similar to that of the venerable DSR-PD170 while offering HDV recording in native interlaced, progressive scan and native progressive modes. The Z7 has 2 XLR audio inputs and HDMI output while the S270 has 4 XLR inputs and features HD-SDI output. Presently the HVR-S270 is the only HDV camcorder capable of recording onto full-size DV cassettes.

In 2008 the HDR-FX1 and the HVR-Z1 were replaced with the HDR-FX1000 and the HVR-Z5, respectively. The major changes include utilizing CMOS sensors instead of CCD, and progressive mode shooting. The FX1000 records progressive scan video using pulldown, while HVR-Z5 offers native progressive recording.

In November 2008 Sony restarted production of the HDR-FX7 camcorder, which had been discontinued a year earlier. Offered for almost half the original price, the HDR-FX7 bridged the gap between the HDR-HC9 and the FX1000.

In summer 2009 Sony discontinued the HDR-HC9 on the North American market, but restarted its sales in spring 2010, this time advertising it not as an HDV camcorder, but as a MiniDV HD camcorder. MiniDV HD has never been officially presented as an alternative name for HDV. The other competing HD recording standard that uses DV cassettes is DVCPRO HD. In spring 2011 the HDR-HC9 is no longer available for purchase from the Sony&#x27;s North American online store.

==Future of HDV==

JVC released its latest HDV camcorder — the GY-HD250 — in 2006. In September 2011 this model was discontinued on the U.S. market. The &quot;B&quot; modification of the older GY-HD200 was released in 2008 and discontinued in November 2009. The latest HDV camcorder made by Canon — the HV40 — was released in 2009, but it traces back to the HV20 developed in 2007, and was phased out of production during 2011, though stocks have lasted through 2012. The latest Sony consumer HDV model is the HDR-HC9, originally released in 2008 and discontinued on the North American market in 2011. 2008 was also the year when Sony presented the latest &quot;advanced amateur&quot; and professional HDV camcorders, namely the HDR-FX1000 and the HVR-Z5.

All the three major manufacturers of HDV equipment — JVC, Canon and Sony — have heavily invested in development of MPEG-2 video compression scheme and continue to rely on it in their professional tapeless camcorder lineups: XDCAM HD (Sony), XDCAM EX (Sony and JVC), XDCAM HD422 (Sony), XF Codec (Canon). At the same time Sony and Canon have joined Panasonic in marketing of AVCHD recording format, which is claimed to deliver visual quality similar to HDV at half the datarate. Consumer high definition camcorders released by these companies since 2009 employ AVCHD format.

In 2010 industry analysts did not expect new HDV products, but believed that manufacturers would continue to support HDV for their existing users, while at the same time transitioning to file-based workflow.

When accessed in 2017, the Broadcast &amp; Production Cameras section on Sony&#x27;s website does not mention HDV technology. The HDV page does not list any equipment or whitepapers.

<doc id="1047057" wikidata="Q1547639" url="?curid=1047057" title="Patellar reflex">
<text>The patellar reflex, also called the knee reflex or knee-jerk, is a stretch reflex which tests the L2, L3, and L4 segments of the spinal cord. Many animals, most significantly humans, have been seen to have the patellar reflex, including dogs, cats, horses, and other mammalian species.

==Mechanism==

Striking of the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer just below the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at the level of L3 or L4 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres. From there, an alpha motor neuron conducts an efferent impulse back to the quadriceps femoris muscle, triggering contraction. This contraction, coordinated with the relaxation of the antagonistic flexor hamstring muscle causes the leg to kick. There is a latency of around 18 ms between stretch of the patellar tendon and the beginning of contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle. This is a reflex of proprioception which helps maintain posture and balance, allowing to keep one&#x27;s balance with little effort or conscious thought.

The patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic reflex arc. There is no interneuron in the pathway leading to contraction of the quadriceps muscle. Instead, the sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord. However, there &quot;is&quot; an inhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle (reciprocal innervation).

This test of a basic automatic reflex may be influenced by the patient consciously inhibiting or exaggerating the response; the doctor may use the Jendrassik maneuver in order to ensure a more valid reflex test.

==Clinical significance==
After the tap of a hammer, the leg is normally extended once and comes to rest. The absence or decrease of this reflex is problematic, and known as Westphal&#x27;s sign. This reflex may be diminished or absent in lower motor neuron lesions and during sleep. On the other hand, multiple oscillation of the leg (pendular reflex) following the tap may be a sign of cerebellar diseases. Exaggerated (brisk) deep tendon reflexes such as this can be found in upper motor neuron lesions, hyperthyroidism, anxiety or nervousness. The test itself assesses the nervous tissue between and including the L2 and L4 segments of the spinal cord.

The patellar reflex is often tested in infants to test the nervous system.

==History==
Wilhelm Heinrich Erb (1840–1921) and Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890) simultaneously reported the patellar tendon or knee reflex in 1875. The term &quot;knee-jerk&quot; was recorded by Sir Michael Foster in his &quot;Textbook of physiology&quot; in 1877: &quot;Striking the tendon below the patella gives rise to a sudden extension of the leg, known as the knee-jerk.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
The term began to be used figuratively from the early 20th century onwards. O. O. McIntyre, in his &quot;New York Day-By-Day&quot; column in &quot;The Coshocton Tribune&quot;, October 1921, wrote: &quot;Itinerant preacher stemming Broadway on a soap box. And gets only an occasional knee-jerk.&quot;

<doc id="1047067" wikidata="Q3454731" url="?curid=1047067" title="Withdrawal reflex">
<text>The withdrawal reflex (nociceptive flexion reflex or flexor withdrawal reflex) is a spinal reflex intended to protect the body from damaging stimuli. The reflex rapidly coordinates the contractions of all the flexor muscles and the relaxations of the extensors in that limb causing sudden withdrawal from the potentially damaging stimulus. Spinal reflexes are often monosynaptic and are mediated by a simple reflex arc. A withdrawal reflex is mediated by a polysynaptic reflex resulting in the stimulation of many motor neurons in order to give a quick response.

==Example==
When a person touches a hot object and withdraws their hand from it without actively thinking about it, the heat stimulates temperature and pain receptors in the skin, triggering a sensory impulse that travels to the central nervous system. The sensory neuron then synapses with interneurons that connect to motor neurons. Some of these send motor impulses to the flexors that lead to the muscles in the arm to contract, while some motor neurons send inhibitory impulses to the extensors so flexion is not inhibited. This is referred to as reciprocal innervation.

The withdrawal reflex in the leg can be examined and measured, using an electromyogram to monitor the muscle activity in the upper leg (biceps femoris) while applying increasing electrical stimulation to the lower leg (sural nerve) on the same side of the body. The stimulus intensity at which the reflex is evoked is often the intensity at which the subject reports the onset of pain, and the strength of the withdrawal reflex is correlated with the strength of the pain experienced.

==Crossed extension reflex following withdrawal reflex==

Once a danger receptor (called &quot;nociceptor&quot;) has been stimulated, the signal travels via the sensory nerve to the dorsal (posterior) horn of the spinal cord. The nerve synapses with ipsilateral motor neurons that exit the ventral (anterior) horn of the spinal cord and work to pull the soon-to-be injured body part away from danger within 0.5 seconds. At the same time, the sensory neuron synapses with the ipsilateral motor neuron, as well as the motor neuron in the contralateral anterior horn. This motor neuron stabilizes the uninjured side of the body (for instance; preparing the other leg to support the entire body weight when the other foot has stepped on a tack). At the same time as these two synapses, the sensory neuron also sends signals along the spinal cord to get motor neurons to contract muscles that shift the center of gravity of the body to maintain balance. This contralateral stimulation of motor neurons to stabilize the body is called the crossed extension reflex, and is a result of the withdrawal reflex (usually in the lower extremities).

<doc id="1047069" wikidata="Q2015556" url="?curid=1047069" title="Louise Élisabeth de Croÿ">
<text>Louise-Élisabeth de Croÿ (&quot;Louise Élisabeth Félicité Françoise Armande Anne Marie Jeanne Joséphine&quot;; 11 June 1749 – 15 May 1832) was a French noblewoman and courtier, as the Marquise of Tourzel. She was the Governess of the Children of France from 1789 until 1792. Decades after the French Revolution, Louise-Élisabeth published her memoirs, which presented a unique perspective on the royal family during the French Revolution. She later acquired the title of duchess.

==Life==
Louise Élisabeth was born in Paris, into the illustrious House of Croÿ during the reign of King Louis XV. Louise’s father was the duke of Havré, Louis Ferdinand Joseph, and her mother was the princess of Montmorency-Luxembourg, Marie Louise.

Louise Élisabeth was married in 1766, at the age of seventeen, to the Marquis de Tourzel. They enjoyed a happy marriage for twenty years, in which Louise Élisabeth bore six children; her husband was, however, killed in a hunting accident in 1786. She was a staunch supporter of the House of Bourbon, and had this motto engraved on a ring she refused to part with: &quot;Lord, save the King, the Dauphin, and his sister!&quot;.

===French Revolution===
After the Storming of the Bastille in 1789, many members of Queen Marie Antoinette’s intimate circle were forced to flee abroad. The duchesse de Polignac, the queen&#x27;s favourite and the governess to the royal children, was forced to emigrate to Switzerland. Marie Antoinette appointed Louise Élisabeth to the newly vacant post, with particular attention to be paid to the dauphin, Louis-Charles. The marquise was advised to curb the dauphin&#x27;s fear of loud noises, particularly the barking of the many dogs at Versailles.

After an angry mob of women incited by revolutionaries stormed the Palace of Versailles on 5 October 1789, the marquise accompanied the royal family to live in the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Tourzel&#x27;s loyalty was strong, and she refused to abandon the royal children as political strife in the nation dramatically increased. She even accompanied the king and his family on the flight to Varennes, for a royalist stronghold in Montmédy. This attempt failed, and the entire party was brought back to Paris.

After the abolition of the monarchy in 1792, Louise Élisabeth was separated from the royal family and imprisoned in the La Force Prison, and soon the Prison Port-Libre. Also imprisoned at the same time was her daughter, Pauline de Tourzel, and Marie Antoinette&#x27;s personal friend, Princesse de Lamballe. Shortly after their imprisonment, they found themselves targeted in the September Massacres, when thousands of incarcerated people in Paris were massacred by mobs who were trying to get rid of the prisons of jailed aristocrats they suspected of treason. Louise Élisabeth and her daughter were smuggled out of the prison by a mysterious man, but Princesse de Lamballe was not so fortunate. She was murdered, and her severed head was then paraded around the city. Louise Élisabeth and her daughter were advised by their rescuer, a &quot;Monsieur Hardi&quot;, to leave Paris because Pauline had escaped the prison illegally and was in danger of arrest, and they left for the countryside, where they lived incognito in Vincennes and at the property of her son in Abondant outside of Dreux.

In January 1793, King Louis XVI was executed. In October, the former queen of France, Marie Antoinette, was also sent to the guillotine. Louise Élisabeth was devastated by their deaths, and she was equally shocked to hear of the death of Louis-Charles in 1795. Several times over the coming decades, Louise Élisabeth was accosted by various men pretending to be &quot;Louis XVII of France&quot;.

===Later years===

As soon as Marie-Thérése-Charlotte was allowed visits again by the government, she was among the first who requested to see her in her prison cell in the Temple. It was Louise Élisabeth who informed Marie-Therese that she was to marry her cousin Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoulême, on the request of the latter’s father. She attended the wedding of Marie-Therese and Louis Antoine in Mitau in the June of 1799, and remained in Mitau for some time. Because of her well-known sympathy for the Bourbon family, she was put under secret surveillance of Napoleon I’s secret police.

During the Bourbon Restoration, Louise Élisabeth was made a duchess by King Charles X. She later published her memoirs, which are an invaluable historical account of the final days of the royal household. Her daughter, Pauline, became a lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s only surviving child, Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte.

==In fiction==
Louise-Élisabeth de Tourzel has been featured in several novels about the French royal family, including the Marie Antoinette romances by Alexandre Dumas.

The novels include:

* &quot;Trianon&quot;, by Elena Maria Vidal
* &quot;Madame Royale&quot;, by Elena Maria Vidal
* &quot;Flaunting, Extravagant Queen&quot;, by Jean Plaidy

The character of Louise-Élisabeth appeared in the 1956 French film &quot;Marie-Antoinette reine de France&quot;.

<text>The crossed extensor reflex or crossed extensor response or crossed extension reflex is a reflex in which the contralateral limb compensates for loss of support when the ipsilateral limb withdraws from painful stimulus in a withdrawal reflex.
During a withdrawal reflex, the flexors in the withdrawing limb contract and the extensors relax, while in the other limb, the opposite occurs as part of the crossed extensor reflex. To provide a more clear explanation, this opposite occurrence means one limb with perform flexion at the hip and knee with the extensors relaxed, while the other limb will perform extension at the hip and knee while flexors are relaxed.
Besides shifting the body weight to the other side, the reflex pathway is also associated with leg coordination when walking by flexing muscle on one side, while extending muscle on the other side.
This crossed extensor response is properly part of the withdrawal reflex.

An example of this is when a person steps on a nail: The leg that is stepping on the nail pulls away, while the other leg takes the weight of the whole body.

The crossed extensor reflex is contralateral, meaning the reflex occurs on the opposite side of the body from the stimulus.

To produce this reflex, branches of the afferent nerve fibers cross from the stimulated side of the body to the contralateral side of the spinal cord. There, they synapse with interneurons, which, in turn, excite or inhibit alpha motor neurons to the muscles of the contralateral limb.

In the ipsilateral leg (the one which steps on the nail), the flexors contract and the extensors relax to lift the leg from the ground. On the contralateral side (the one that bears all the weight), the flexors relax and the extensors contract to stiffen the leg since it must suddenly support the entire weight of the body. At the same time, signals travel up the spinal cord and cause contraction of the contralateral muscles of the hip and abdomen to shift the body’s center of gravity over the extended leg. To a large extent, the coordination of all these muscles and maintenance of equilibrium is mediated by the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.

<doc id="1047078" wikidata="Q589518" url="?curid=1047078" title="Microalgae">
<text>Microalgae or microphytes are microscopic algae invisible to the naked eye. They are phytoplankton typically found in freshwater and marine systems, living in both the water column and sediment. They are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups. Depending on the species, their sizes can range from a few micrometers (μm) to a few hundred micrometers. Unlike higher plants, microalgae do not have roots, stems, or leaves. They are specially adapted to an environment dominated by viscous forces.

Microalgae, capable of performing photosynthesis, are important for life on earth; they produce approximately half of the atmospheric oxygen and use the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide to grow photoautotrophically. &quot;Marine photosynthesis is dominated by microalgae, which together with cyanobacteria, are collectively called phytoplankton.&quot; Microalgae, together with bacteria, form the base of the food web and provide energy for all the trophic levels above them. Microalgae biomass is often measured with chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; concentrations and can provide a useful index of potential production.

The biodiversity of microalgae is enormous and they represent an almost untapped resource. It has been estimated that about 200,000-800,000 species in many different genera exist of which about 50,000 species are described. Over 15,000 novel compounds originating from algal biomass have been chemically determined. Examples include carotenoids, fatty acids, enzymes, polymers, peptides, toxins and sterols. Besides providing these valuable metabolites, microalgae are regarded as a potential feedstock for biofuels and has also emerged as a promising microorganism in bioremediation.

An exception to the microalgae family is the colorless &quot;Prototheca&quot; which are devoid of any chlorophyll. These achlorophic algae switch to parasitism and thus cause the disease protothecosis in human and animals.


==Characteristics and uses==

The chemical composition of microalgae is not an intrinsic constant factor but varies over a wide range of factors, both depending on species and on cultivation conditions. Some microalgae have the capacity to acclimate to changes in environmental conditions by altering their chemical composition in response to environmental variability. A particularly dramatic example is their ability to replace phospholipids with non-phosphorus membrane lipids in phosphorus-depleted environments. It is possible to accumulate the desired products in microalgae to a large extent by changing environmental factors, like temperature, illumination, pH, CO2 supply, salt and nutrients.

Microphytes also produce chemical signals which contribute to prey selection, defense, and avoidance. These chemical signals affect large scale tropic structures such as algal blooms but propagate by simple diffusion and laminar advective flow. Microalgae such as microphytes constitute the basic foodstuff for numerous aquaculture species, especially filtering bivalves.

=== Photo- and chemosynthetic algae ===
Photosynthetic and chemosynthetic microbes can also form symbiotic relationships with host organisms. They provide them with vitamins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, necessary for the growth of the bivalves which are unable to synthesize it themselves. In addition, because the cells grow in aqueous suspension, they have more efficient access to water, CO2, and other nutrients.

Microalgae play a major role in nutrient cycling and fixing inorganic carbon into organic molecules and expressing oxygen in marine biosphere.

While fish oil has become famous for its omega-3 fatty acid content, fish do not actually produce omega-3s, instead accumulating their omega-3 reserves by consuming microalgae. These omega-3 fatty acids can be obtained in the human diet directly from the microalgae that produce them.

Microalgae can accumulate considerable amounts of proteins depending on species and cultivation conditions. Due to their ability to grow on non-arable land microalgae may provide an alternative protein source for human consumption or animal feed. Microalgae proteins are also investigated as thickening agents or emulsion and foam stabilizers in the food industry to replace animal based proteins.

Some microalgae accumulate chromophores like chlorophyll, carotenoids, phycobiliproteins or polyphenols that may be extracted and used as coloring agents.

==Cultivation of microalgae==

A range of microalgae species are produced in hatcheries and are used in a variety of ways for commercial purposes, including for human nutrition, as biofuel, in the aquaculture of other organisms, in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, and as biofertiliser. However, the low cell density is a major bottleneck in commercial viability of many microalgae derived products, especially low cost commodities.

Studies have investigated the main factors in the success of a microalgae hatchery system to be:
*Geometry and scale of cultivation systems (referred as photobioreactors); 
*Light intensity; 
*Concentration of carbon dioxide () in the gas phase
*Nutrient levels (mainly N, P, K)
*Mixing of culture

<doc id="1047080" wikidata="Q272116" url="?curid=1047080" title="Laura Harris">
<text>Laura Elizabeth Harris (born November 20, 1976) is a Canadian actress who has appeared in a wide variety of movies and television shows. She is probably best known for her roles as Marybeth Louise Hutchinson in &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998), Maggie in &quot;Severance&quot; (2006), Daisy Adair in &quot;Dead Like Me,&quot; and Marie Warner in Season 2 of &quot;24&quot;. She took a hiatus from acting in 2015 after almost 28 years, but began reappearing in roles from 2021. She is sometimes credited as Elizabeth Harris and Laura E. Harris.

==Early life==
Harris is the daughter of schoolteachers. She began acting in radio dramas and animation series when she was five years old. As a child Harris was educated at Crofton House School and attended college through UC correspondence. After working nearly 14 years in television, she broke into feature film acting as a teenager.

==Career==
Harris is known for her roles as Grim Reaper Daisy Adair in the cable series &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;
 and as Marie Warner in the spy drama &quot;24&quot;. Her film career dates back to 1990 when she appeared in an adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; as Loni. She appeared as Marybeth Louise Hutchinson in &quot;The Faculty&quot; in 1998.

In 2006, Laura Harris starred as Maggie in a British-German horror film called &quot;Severance&quot;, directed by Christopher Smith, and written by Smith and James Moran.

In the summer of 2009, she co-starred in the internationally co-produced science fiction series &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; as Zoe Barnes.

She has also done voice-overs in animated TV shows including &quot;The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil&quot;, &quot;Astonishing X-Men&quot;, &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot; and &quot;My Little Pony Tales&quot;.

While never officially quit acting, she switched her focus in 2010 to education and began attending college at UC Berkeley. While there, she began to show an interest in activism. In 2013, she began working for a tech company that also worked to improve local communities, politically and otherwise.

In 2021, after a 6 year hiatus from acting, Laura took on the role of Willow Ward on the Netflix show &quot;Scaredy Cats&quot;, appearing in 3 episodes. Also in 2021 Laura had a part in the Lifetime Channel movie &quot;Gone Mom&quot;.

<doc id="1047096" wikidata="Q930510" url="?curid=1047096" title="Renault Vel Satis">
<text>The Renault Vel Satis is a five-passenger, five-door executive hatchback, manufactured and marketed by Renault from 2001-2009 over a single generation, sharing its platform with the Laguna II and Espace IV and manufactured on the same assembly line in Sandouville, France and noted for its unorthodox styling approach to the luxury segment. The Vel Satis, alongside the Vauxhall Signum, aimed to capture a new market segment.

Launched at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show to replace the already discontinued Safrane, the Vel Satis followed a 1998 Paris Motor Show concept.

As Renault&#x27;s flagship model, it was the company&#x27;s first car offered with adaptive cruise control, Renault reportedly spent €550 million developing the Vel Satis, predicting 50,000 sales across Europe in its first year. In total, over an eight year production, approximately 62,000 were manufactured.

The name Vel Satis is a portmanteau of &quot;Velocity&quot; and &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.

==Overview==

The Vel Satis is noted for its height (13 cm higher than a Safrane), benefiting interior space, and remains in use by high-ranking French officials. It was the second ever car to receive a five star Euro NCAP safety crash test rating, after the Laguna II.

Engine availability included: 
* 2.0 T 16 valve 4-cylinder
* 3.5 24 valve V6-cylinder
* 2.0 dCi 16 valve 4-cylinder
* 2.2 dCi 16 valve 4-cylinder
* 3.0 dCi 24 valve V6-cylinder

The Vel Satis received a minor facelift for the 2005 model year, featuring a revised front grille, rear apron, twin-flow exhaust system, and chrome-plated door handles. The interior featured revised fittings, fabrics and materials and revised radio and navigation systems. The 2.0-liter petrol engine received an increase in output to 125 kW.

In March 2005, Renault UK decided not to develop a RHD version of the facelifted Vel Satis, as sales of the model had been poor in the United Kingdom since launch. Although 3,500 sales were predicted, only a third of these were achieved. This came two years after Renault discontinued the Avantime coupé/MPV.

On August 27, 2009, Renault ended production of the Vel Satis — losing an estimated €18,710 per vehicle produced.

==Reception==
Patrick Le Quément, Renault&#x27;s design chief, said the Vel Satis was intended to have physical presence, to redefine the prestige car on French terms, and to target less conformist customers. 

In September 2002, &quot;Car&quot; described the Vel Satis as &quot;ugly and very French.&quot; 

Reviews of the car were critical of its ride and handling but noted the car was quiet under most conditions. &quot;The gearbox is prone to considerable hunting in its quest to deliver power, at which point engine noise intrudes more than anticipated, and the change itself is by no means the smoothest in the class.&quot; The ride quality was described as feeling &quot;over tough at pottering speeds, but displays a tendency to disintegrate into chop and judder when confronted with anything other than the smoothest of surfaces.&quot;

<doc id="1047099" wikidata="Q15266134" url="?curid=1047099" title="Philharmonic Dining Rooms">
<text>The Philharmonic Dining Rooms is a public house at the corner of Hope Street and Hardman Street in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, and stands diagonally opposite the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. It is commonly known as &quot;The Phil&quot;. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

==History==
The public house was built in about 1898–1900 for the brewer Robert Cain. It was designed by Walter W. Thomas (not to be confused with Walter Aubrey Thomas the designer of the Royal Liver Building) and craftsmen from the School of Architecture and Applied Arts at University College (now the University of Liverpool), supervised by G. Hall Neale and Arthur Stratton.

Paul McCartney performed at the Philharmonic when he was a young musician, and during an impromptu concert in 2018.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The building is constructed in ashlar stone with a slate roof in an &quot;exuberant free style&quot; of architecture. It has a combination of two and three storeys, with attics and cellar. There are ten bays along Hope Street and three along Hardman Street. Its external features include a variety of windows, most with mullions, and some with elaborate architraves, a two-storey oriel window at the junction of the streets, stepped gables, turrets with ogee domes, a balustraded parapet above the second storey, a serpentine balcony (also balustraded) above the main entrance in Hope Street, and a low relief sculpture of musicians and musical instruments. The main entrance contains metal gates in Art Nouveau style, their design being attributed to H. Bloomfield Bare.

===Interior===
There are 5 floors in total, with the main bar interior decorated in musical themes that relate to the nearby concert hall. These decorations are executed on repoussé copper panels designed by Henry Bloomfield Bare and by Thomas Huson, plasterwork by C. J. Allen, mosaics, and items in mahogany and glass. Two of the smaller rooms are entitled &quot;Brahms&quot; and &quot;Liszt&quot;. Of particular interest to visitors is the high quality of the gentlemen&#x27;s urinals, with pink-marble basins and pink imitation-marble urinal surrounds.

==Appraisal==

Pollard and Pevsner, in the &quot;Buildings of England&quot; series, state that it is the most richly decorated of Liverpool&#x27;s Victorian public houses, and that &quot;it is of exceptional quality in national terms&quot;. The Grade I listing means that it is &quot;of exceptional interest&quot;. Pye describes it as one of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;architectural gems&quot;.

<doc id="1047104" wikidata="Q1849138" url="?curid=1047104" title="Nonesuch Records">
<text>Nonesuch Records is an American record company and label owned by Warner Music Group, distributed by Warner Records (formerly Warner Bros. Records), and based in New York City. Founded by Jac Holzman in 1964 as a budget classical label, Nonesuch has developed into a label that records a wide range of music genres. Robert Hurwitz was president of the company from 1984 to 2017.

==History==
===Founding===
Nonesuch was founded in early 1964 by Jac Holzman to produce &quot;fine records at the same price as a trade paperback&quot;, which would be half the price of a normal LP. To achieve this, he licensed European recordings of classical music as it would be too expensive to record new material. Originally the label concentrated heavily on chamber and baroque music, often with (then) unique repertory, and typically sold at less-than-premium prices. Upon its formation, Nonesuch operated as a subsidiary label of Elektra Records, which Holzman had launched in 1950. In 1970, Holzman sold Elektra and Nonesuch to Kinney National Company, which became Warner Communications and later part of Time Warner&#x27;s Warner Music Group. In 2004, Warner Music Group became an independently owned, publicly traded company.

The 1968 catalogue already listed over 200 albums. During the first years, the focus was clearly set on early music, i.e. music that was composed before 1800. Some artists appeared frequently:

* Karl Ristenpart with his &quot;Chamber Orchestra of the Saar&quot; with different works by Johann Sebastian Bach and other baroque composers.
* Leslie Jones with The Little Orchestra of London recorded many symphonies by Joseph Haydn, as well as other works from the same period.
* The French violinist and conductor Roland Douatte, together with his Collegium Musicum de Paris, recorded several works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann, and Antonio Vivaldi.
* The Danish organist Jørgen Ernst Hansen recorded works by Dietrich Buxtehude and Johann Pachelbel, and started the series “Master Works for Organ” which included works by baroque masters, played at different organs in Europe. The series subsequently counted eleven volumes (not all played by Hansen though).

There was some later music as well. Günter Wand conducted Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Missa solemnis, Carl Schuricht conducted Anton Bruckners 7th Symphony, and Pierre Boulez with Orchestre National de la R.T.F played The Rite of Spring.

=== 1965–1979: Teresa Sterne ===
Teresa Sterne led Nonesuch Records from 1965 until 1979; she was responsible not only for all of the artists &amp; repertory decisions but also for overseeing the increasingly distinctive look of the record jackets. Sterne oversaw several firsts for the label, including early electronic releases. Nonesuch commissioned Morton Subotnick&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Silver Apples of the Moon&quot; (made on the Buchla 100), and in 1966 released a 2-LP set of Moog sounds with 16-page booklet called &quot;The Nonesuch Guide to Electronic Music&quot; by Beaver &amp; Krause (which spent 26 weeks in Billboard&#x27;s Top 100 chart).

Among the most notable achievements of Sterne&#x27;s time at the label were the release of George Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Voices of Children&quot;, inspired by the poems of Federico García Lorca, which sold more than 70,000 units; the recording of new works by Elliott Carter, including his first and second string quartets; and the commissioning and release of Charles Wuorinen&#x27;s &quot;Time&#x27;s Encomium&quot;, which became the first electronic work to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1970. Under Sterne, Nonesuch helped spark a ragtime revival in the United States with the release of a series of Scott Joplin piano rags performed by Joshua Rifkin. Sterne also launched the groundbreaking Explorer Series, building the foundation for the field of world music.

Sterne&#x27;s abrupt termination in December 1979 prompted some two dozen Nonesuch artists to write a letter to the editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot; speaking out against the decision; several noteworthy composers, Elliott Carter and Aaron Copland among them, sent a letter to the vice president of the parent company, Warner Communications, in protest.

Sterne was replaced by the founder&#x27;s younger brother, Keith Holzman, a production chief who, for the next five years, operated the label from Los Angeles.

===1984–2016: Robert Hurwitz===
Former Blue Thumb Records founder Bob Krasnow, who assumed the chairmanship of Elektra Records in 1983, brought in the 34-year-old Bob Hurwitz in 1984, at the time the head of the US division of the Warner Bros. Records-distributed jazz label ECM Records, to run Nonesuch Records.

Within the first two years under Hurwitz&#x27;s leadership, Nonesuch released albums by such &quot;new music&quot; pioneers as Steve Reich (&quot;The Desert Music&quot;, 1985), John Adams (&quot;Harmonielehre&quot;, 1986), Philip Glass (&quot;Mishima&quot;, 1985), John Zorn (&quot;The Big Gundown&quot;, 1985), and Kronos Quartet (&quot;Kronos Quartet&quot;, 1986). (Kronos Quartet&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Pieces of Africa&quot; topped both the Billboard classical and world music charts.) Hurwitz established a jazz roster at the label, which included Zorn, Wayne Horvitz, and the World Saxophone Quartet. He built upon the world music reputation of Nonesuch, represented up to that point by the Explorer Series, with his signing of Brazilian singer and composer Caetano Veloso, who, like Reich and Adams, has maintained an ongoing relationship with the label for decades. Among Nonesuch world-music successes during the 1980s was the release of &quot;Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares&quot;, a recording of the Bulgarian State Television female choir, and the American debut of the Gipsy Kings, which was certified platinum with over one million in sales. Nonesuch enjoyed even greater success on the world music front in the late 1990s with the release of &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot;, which became the biggest-selling disc in the label&#x27;s history and spawned many successful solo recordings from the stars of those original Ry Cooder-led sessions in Havana, Cuba.

In 1994, Hurwitz hired David Bither, the Senior Vice President and General Manager of Elektra Records, to head the international department at Nonesuch Records. But Bither quickly showed a far greater interest and talent in A&amp;R and, soon after coming to the label, made a number of important signings that expanded the company&#x27;s musical landscape while holding to the same ideals that had been long established from the company&#x27;s earliest days. Bither&#x27;s first signing, Emmylou Harris, signaled a new direction for the label. Harris, previously signed to Warner Bros. Records and Elektra Records, whose 2000 album &quot;Red Dirt Girl&quot; garnered a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Though she had long been a highly regarded interpreter of other writers’ songs, her Nonesuch debut was distinguished by being her first album to primarily feature self-penned compositions. In the decade that followed, k.d. lang, Randy Newman, Shawn Colvin, and Ry Cooder joined the label as did the rock band Wilco, which released four studio albums on the label, starting with its breakthrough disc &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,&quot; which was released on Nonesuch after it was rejected by Reprise Records. Laurie Anderson has put out three discs with the label, and Nonesuch reissued her seminal &quot;Big Science&quot; album, an avant-garde project that became an unlikely pop hit in 1982. David Byrne released a solo album, &quot;Grown Backwards&quot;, on the label, as well as a live concert album with Caetano Veloso, &quot;Live at Carnegie Hall,&quot; and the original recording of his collaboration with Fatboy Slim, &quot;Here Lies Love&quot;. That recounting of the life and loves of former Filipino leader Imelda Marcos, was turned into an Off-Broadway musical at The Public Theater in the spring of 2013.

Among more recent Nonesuch signings, the most commercially successful has been The Black Keys, the former Akron, Ohio-based duo who parlayed cult status as no-frills blues rockers into an arena-sized following and received multiple Grammy Awards for their 2010 album &quot;Brothers&quot; and their 2012 release &quot;El Camino&quot;.

Forward-thinking traditional groups Carolina Chocolate Drops and Punch Brothers also joined the label, as well as iconoclastic folk interpreter Sam Amidon. The Chocolate Drops, a group exploring the African-American roots of old-time music, won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album for its Nonesuch debut, &quot;Genuine Negro Jig&quot;. Mandolinist and composer Chris Thile of Punch Brothers was named a 2012 MacArthur Fellow, receiving one of 23 “genius” grant awards to extraordinary practitioners in a variety of creative fields. As a solo artist, he has also joined the classical ranks of the label, releasing the first of three discs of Bach&#x27;s Sonatas and Partitas, written for the violin but transposed by Thile for mandolin.

Nonesuch has been building a catalog of Broadway cast recordings, including several works by multiple Tony and Grammy Award-winning composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim. The label has released the cast recordings of several Broadway revivals of Sondheim&#x27;s musicals. Among them are the 1998 production of Gypsy (music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Sondheim); 2002&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot;; 2010&#x27;s &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;; and Irish director John Doyle&#x27;s reimaginings of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (2006) and &quot;Company&quot; (2007). The label also released the soundtrack to Tim Burton’s film adaptation of &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, starring Johnny Depp, in 2007. Nonesuch has also released recordings of less well-known Sondheim works like &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (his first) and &quot;The Frogs&quot;, as well as first recordings of his new musical &quot;Bounce&quot; and its later incarnation, &quot;Road Show&quot;.

From the next generation of composers, Adam Guettel has made three recordings for Nonesuch: the cast recording of his first musical, &quot;Floyd Collins&quot; (1996), the Original Cast Recording of his Tony Award-winning The Light in the Piazza; and his song cycle &quot;Myths and Hymns&quot; (earlier mounted off Broadway under the title &quot;Saturn Returns&quot;).

Among the champions of Adam Guettel&#x27;s work is five-time Tony Award-winning singer and actress Audra McDonald, who has showcased his compositions, among the works of a number of other contemporary composers, on her 1998 Nonesuch solo debut album, &quot;Way Back to Paradise&quot;, and later recordings &quot;How Glory Goes&quot; (2000), &quot;Build a Bridge&quot; (2006), and &quot;Go Back Home&quot; (2013). Her 2002 album &quot;Happy Songs&quot; featured music of the 1930s and ’40s by songwriters like Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, and the Gershwins.

As with its catalog of Broadway cast recordings, Nonesuch has assembled an equally selective roster of movie soundtracks, chief among them the scores of Philip Glass. His first Nonesuch recording, the soundtrack to Paul Schrader’s &quot;&quot; in 1984, began a decades-long relationship with the label that would include several stand-out soundtracks, like those of Godfrey Reggio’s wordless films &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; and &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;, the Errol Morris documentary &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, Martin Scorsese’s 1997 film &quot;Kundun&quot;, and &quot;The Hours&quot;, based on the book by Michael Cunningham. &quot;Mishima&quot; was also the first Nonesuch album from now longtime Nonesuch artists Kronos Quartet. Kronos went on to collaborate with British composer Clint Mansell on his scores for the Darren Aronofsky films &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; (2000), &quot;The Fountain&quot; (2006), and &quot;Noah&quot; (2014); the Requiem soundtrack included the piece &quot;Lux Aeterna,&quot; which subsequently became a popular track for use in movie trailers and commercials. Nonesuch has also recorded the film work of Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood, including writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson’s Oscar-nominated &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Master&quot; (2012). Among other Nonesuch movie soundtrack offerings are Jon Brion’s score for Anderson’s 2002 film &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, Stephin Merritt’s songs for &quot;Pieces of April&quot; (2003), Thomas Newman’s score for the HBO mini-series &quot;Angels in America&quot; (2007), and Carter Burwell’s score for the Coen brothers’ &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010). The relationship with the Coens has continued with the 2013 release of the soundtrack to &quot;Inside Llewyn Davis&quot;, produced by T Bone Burnett and the Coen brothers.

In the late 1990s, after Elektra underwent restructuring at the executive level, Nonesuch was shifted under the umbrella of Warner Music International. In the early 2000s, Nonesuch briefly operated under Atlantic Records, and has operated under Warner Bros. Records since in 2004.

In September 2015, it was announced that Bob Hurwitz would step down as president of Nonesuch Records. After serving as co-president of the label with David Bither in 2016, Hurwitz became the chairman emeritus on January 1, 2017, when Bither became sole president.

===2017–present: David Bither===
David Bither, who had served as senior vice president of Nonesuch for 20 years, became co-president of the label with Hurwitz in 2016 and sole president in 2017. Kris Chen, formerly of XL Recordings, was hired as senior vice president in September 2016. In March 2017, it was announced that the band Fleet Foxes would make its Nonesuch debut with the release of &quot;Crack-Up,&quot; its first album in six years, that June.

==Nonesuch Explorer Series==
In the late 1960s, the Explorer Series made the label a pioneer in the field of world music before the term had even been coined. The series, which Nonesuch released from 1967 to 1984, consisted of field recordings made primarily in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe.

For American non-travelers, it was the first exposure to musical idioms such as music produced by a gamelan. In 1977, a few of the recordings were chosen for the Voyager Golden Record, and sent into outer space aboard the Voyager spacecraft. In 2008, one of the first Explorer Series albums, &quot;Music from the Morning of the World&quot; (1967), comprising early field recordings that the British musicologist David Lewiston had made in Bali in 1966, was added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.

Many of the original analog recordings of the Nonesuch Explorer Series albums were remastered during the 2000s and re-released, with new packaging, in CD format.

<text>HSAB is an acronym for &quot;hard and soft (Lewis) acids and bases&quot;. HSAB is widely used in chemistry for explaining the stability of compounds, reaction mechanisms and pathways. It assigns the terms &#x27;hard&#x27; or &#x27;soft&#x27;, and &#x27;acid&#x27; or &#x27;base&#x27; to chemical species. &#x27;Hard&#x27; applies to species which are small, have high charge states (the charge criterion applies mainly to acids, to a lesser extent to bases), and are weakly polarizable. &#x27;Soft&#x27; applies to species which are big, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable.

The theory is used in contexts where a qualitative, rather than quantitative, description would help in understanding the predominant factors which drive chemical properties and reactions. This is especially so in transition metal chemistry, where numerous experiments have been done to determine the relative ordering of ligands and transition metal ions in terms of their hardness and softness.

HSAB theory is also useful in predicting the products of metathesis reactions. In 2005 it was shown that even the sensitivity and performance of explosive materials can be explained on basis of HSAB theory.

Ralph Pearson introduced the HSAB principle in the early 1960s as an attempt to unify inorganic and organic reaction chemistry.

== Theory ==

Essentially, the theory states that &quot;soft&quot; acids prefer to form bonds with &quot;soft&quot; bases, whereas &quot;hard&quot; acids prefer to form bonds with &quot;hard&quot; bases, all other factors being equal. It can also be said that hard acids bind strongly to hard bases and soft acids bind strongly to soft bases. The HSAB classification in the original work was largely based on equilibrium constants of Lewis acid/base reactions with a reference base for comparison.

Borderline cases are also identified: borderline acids are trimethylborane, sulfur dioxide and ferrous Fe2+, cobalt Co2+ caesium Cs+ and lead Pb2+ cations. Borderline bases are: aniline, pyridine, nitrogen N2 and the azide, chloride, bromide, nitrate and sulfate anions.

Generally speaking, acids and bases interact and the most stable interactions are hard–hard (ionogenic character) and soft–soft (covalent character).

An attempt to quantify the &#x27;softness&#x27; of a base consists in determining the equilibrium constant for the following equilibrium:

:BH + CH3Hg+ H+ + CH3HgB

where CH3Hg+ (methylmercury ion) is a very soft acid and H+ (proton) is a hard acid, which compete for B (the base to be classified).

Some examples illustrating the effectiveness of the theory:
* Bulk metals are soft acids and are poisoned by soft bases such as phosphines and sulfides.
* Hard solvents such as hydrogen fluoride, water and the protic solvents tend to dissolve strong solute bases such as fluoride and oxide anions. On the other hand, dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide and acetone are soft solvents with a preference for solvating large anions and soft bases.
* In coordination chemistry soft–soft and hard–hard interactions exist between ligands and metal centers.

== Chemical hardness ==
In 1983 Pearson together with Robert Parr extended the qualitative HSAB theory with a quantitative definition of the chemical hardness (η) as being proportional to the second derivative of the total energy of a chemical system with respect to changes in the number of electrons at a fixed nuclear environment:

:formula_1

The factor of one-half is arbitrary and often dropped as Pearson has noted.

An operational definition for the chemical hardness is obtained by applying a three-point finite difference approximation to the second derivative:

:formula_2

where &quot;I&quot; is the ionization potential and &quot;A&quot; the electron affinity. This expression implies that the chemical hardness is proportional to the band gap of a chemical system, when a gap exists.

The first derivative of the energy with respect to the number of electrons is equal to the chemical potential, &quot;μ&quot;, of the system,

:formula_3,

from which an operational definition for the chemical potential is obtained from a finite difference approximation to the first order derivative as

:formula_4

which is equal to the negative of the electronegativity (&quot;χ&quot;) definition on the Mulliken scale: &quot;μ&quot; = −&quot;χ&quot;.

The hardness and Mulliken electronegativity are related as

:formula_5,

and in this sense hardness is a measure for resistance to deformation or change. Likewise a value of zero denotes maximum softness, where softness is defined as the reciprocal of hardness.

In a compilation of hardness values only that of the hydride anion deviates. Another discrepancy noted in the original 1983 article are the apparent higher hardness of Tl3+ compared to Tl+.

== Modifications ==
If the interaction between acid and base in solution results in an equilibrium mixture the strength of the interaction can be quantified in terms of an equilibrium constant. An alternative quantitative measure is the heat (enthalpy) of formation of the Lewis acid-base adduct in a non-coordinating solvent. The ECW model is quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of Lewis acid base interactions, -ΔH . The model assigned E and C parameters to many Lewis acids and bases. Each acid is characterized by an EA and a CA. Each base is likewise characterized by its own EB and CB. The E and C parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. The equation is

:-ΔH = EAEB + CACB + W

The W term represents a constant energy contribution for acid–base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base. The equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. The graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of Lewis base strengths or Lewis acid strengths. The ECW model accommodates the failure of single parameter descriptions of acid-base interactions.

A related method adopting the E and C formalism of Drago and co-workers quantitatively predicts the formation constants for complexes of many metal ions plus the proton with a wide range of unidentate Lewis acids in aqueous solution, and also offered insights into factors governing HSAB behavior in solution.

Another quantitative system has been proposed, in which Lewis acid strength toward Lewis base fluoride is based on gas-phase affinity for fluoride. Additional one-parameter base strength scales have been presented. However, it has been shown that to define the order of Lewis base strength (or Lewis acid strength) at least two properties must be considered. For Pearson&#x27;s qualitative HSAB theory the two properties are hardness and strength while for Drago&#x27;s quantitative ECW model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent .

== Kornblum&#x27;s rule ==
An application of HSAB theory is the so-called Kornblum&#x27;s rule (after Nathan Kornblum) which states that in reactions with ambident nucleophiles (nucleophiles that can attack from two or more places), the more electronegative atom reacts when the reaction mechanism is SN1 and the less electronegative one in a SN2 reaction. This rule (established in 1954) predates HSAB theory but in HSAB terms its explanation is that in a SN1 reaction the carbocation (a hard acid) reacts with a hard base (high electronegativity) and that in a SN2 reaction tetravalent carbon (a soft acid) reacts with soft bases.

According to findings, electrophilic alkylations at free CN− occur preferentially at carbon, regardless of whether the SN1 or SN2 mechanism is involved and whether hard or soft electrophiles are employed. Preferred N attack, as postulated for hard electrophiles by the HSAB principle, could not be observed with any alkylating agent. Isocyano compounds are only formed with highly reactive electrophiles that react without an activation barrier because the diffusion limit is approached. It is claimed that the knowledge of absolute rate constants and not of the hardness of the reaction partners is needed to predict the outcome of alkylations of the cyanide ion.

=== Criticism ===
Reanalysis of a large number of various most typical ambident organic system reveals that thermodynamic/kinetic control describes reactivity of organic compounds perfectly, whereas the HSAB principle fails and should be abandoned in the rationalization of ambident reactivity of organic compounds.

<text>Count Karlstein, or the Ride of the Demon Huntsman is the first children&#x27;s novel written by British author Philip Pullman. It was published in 1982. The story was originally written by Pullman to be performed as a school play at Bishop Kirk Middle School, Oxford, where Pullman was an English teacher.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in the fictional Swiss village of Karlstein in 1816. The evil Count Karlstein made a deal with Zamiel, the Demon Huntsman, in order to obtain his current wealth. The condition of the deal was that in ten years&#x27; time the huntsman will be presented with a human sacrifice on All Souls&#x27; Eve. The count has decided to offer his two young nieces, Lucy and Charlotte.

His plan does not go as smoothly as he would have preferred. Hildi Kelmar, a castle maidservant, overhears his plan to sacrifice Lucy and Charlotte and tries to save them.

The narrative shifts between the perspectives of a panoply of characters, including Hildi, Lucy, Charlotte, the girls&#x27; former teacher Miss Augusta Davenport, the inept coachman Max Grindoff, and a police report. Other characters that come to the aid of the girls, willingly or not, are Meister Haifisch, the Count&#x27;s lawyer; Doctor Cadaverezzi, a fraudulent magician employing Max as an assistant, who takes Lucy in as a part of his act; Eliza, Miss Davenport&#x27;s helper and Max&#x27;s lover; Hildi&#x27;s mother, a tavern owner; and Hildi&#x27;s brother, Peter, a huntsman hiding from the law.

After hiding the girls, avoiding the Count and his cronies (Arturo Snivelwurst, his cowardly manservant, and Frau Muller, the castle&#x27;s head servant), and helping several other people, Hildi has no choice but to send her fugitive brother, armed with a single silver bullet, to rescue the girls from the distant hunting cabin. He uses the bullet before encountering Zamiel, but the Demon Huntsman spares the hunter and those he protects, taking the life of Karlstein instead. The following day, Peter wins a shooting contest and the title of Chief Ranger of the Forest, securing his freedom. Meister Haifisch arrives and announces that the true Count Karlstein is in fact the orphaned Max, who weds Eliza and raises Lucy and Charlotte. Finally, Miss Augusta and Doctor Cadaverezzi (who is known as Signor Rolipolio), old lovers, reunite.

==Reception==
Kirkus Reviews wrote &quot;whirlwind plotting, manipulated into a pulsing tale of darkened hearts, treachery, and at long last, redemption.&quot; while Publishers Weekly, in a star review, described it as &quot;Dashing, sparkling and wildly over-the-top fun.&quot;

==Trivia==
The novel borrows story elements from the opera &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; by Carl Maria von Weber.

Filmmaker Henry Selick has optioned the book with a view to making it into a film.

<doc id="1047129" wikidata="Q453899" url="?curid=1047129" title="Gaius Lutatius Catulus (consul 242 BC)">
<text>Gaius Lutatius Catulus ( 242–241 BC) was a Roman statesman and naval commander in the First Punic War. He was born a member of the plebeian gens Lutatius. His cognomen &quot;Catulus&quot; means &quot;puppy&quot;. There are no historical records of his life prior to consulship, but his career probably followed the standard cursus honorum, beginning with service in the cavalry and continuing with the positions of military tribune and quaestor.

He was elected as a consul in 242 BC, a &quot;novus homo&quot;. His colleague as consul was Aulus Postumius Albinus. In addition to the consulship Postumius held the position of Flamen Martialis, and for this reason the pontifex maximus Lucius Caecilius Metellus forbade him from leaving the city. Lutatius was therefore the only candidate for commanding the war in Sicily. The senate appointed the praetor Quintus Valerius Falto as his second-in-command. This was somewhat of a novelty, since a second praetorship was created only a few years earlier, thereby allowing one of the praetors to leave Rome. Typically the two consuls shared the command of the army.

Upon assuming command Lutatius and Valerius embarked for Sicily. Lutatius had the command of both legions and a new fleet. This fleet was funded by donations from wealthy citizens as the prolonged war had left the public treasury virtually empty. The degree to which Lutatius was involved with the construction of the fleet is unknown. No decisive action in the war was taken in 242 BC. His brother, Quintus Lutatius Cerco, was elected consul in the following year (and censor in 236 BC), but Lutatius and Valerius were granted proconsulship and propraetorship, respectively, allowing them to continue leading the military efforts against Carthage.

In 241 BC, Carthage sent a large fleet commanded by an admiral called Hanno to Sicily with dual purpose of regaining naval supremacy and resupplying Hamilcar and their besieged garrisons in Sicily. A wound prevented Lutatius from commanding the fleet in the ensuing Battle of the Aegates personally, and so the command passed to Valerius. The battle ended in decisive Roman victory. Carthage, unable to fund a replacement fleet, was forced to negotiate a peace treaty favorable to the Romans with Lutatius. Lutatius&#x27; original treaty was rejected by the Senate, a commission of 10 senators negotiated an even stricter treaty which still bore Lutatius&#x27; name. Both Lutatius and Valerius were awarded a triumph by the senate. To celebrate his victory, Lutatius built a temple to Juturna in Campus Martius, in the area currently known as Largo di Torre Argentina. There is no historical record of his subsequent life or career.

Gaius Lutatius Catulus is also the main character of Finnish writer Jukka M. Heikkilä&#x27;s book &quot;Merikonsuli&quot; (&quot;The Marine Consul&quot;).

<text>Star Tours was a motion simulator attraction at several Disney theme parks, based on the successful &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series created by George Lucas. Set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, the attraction sent guests on an excursion trip to Endor, whilst being caught in an altercation between the New Republic and an Imperial Remnant. The attraction featured Captain &quot;Rex&quot; RX-24 along with series regulars R2-D2 and C-3PO.

At its debut at Disneyland in 1987, it was the first attraction based originally on a non-Disney licensed intellectual property. The first incarnation of the ride appeared in Tomorrowland at Disneyland in 1987, replacing the previous attraction, Adventure Thru Inner Space. The attraction had subsequent openings at Tokyo Disneyland, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios, and Disneyland Paris.

The attraction at Disneyland and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios closed in 2010 to allow conversion for its successor attraction, Star Tours – The Adventures Continue. The latter location was completed on May 20, 2011. Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Paris closed their versions for conversion in 2012 and 2016, marking the original ride&#x27;s final run of 29 years.

==History==

The ride that became &quot;Star Tours&quot; first saw light as a proposal for an attraction based on the 1979 Disney live-action film &quot;The Black Hole&quot;. It would have been an interactive ride-simulator attraction where guests would have had the ability to choose the route. However, after preliminary planning, the &quot;Black Hole&quot; attraction was shelved due to its enormous cost as well as the unpopularity of the film itself.

Instead of completely dismissing the idea of a simulator, the company decided to make use of a partnership between Disney and George Lucas, the creator of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, that began in 1986 with the opening of &quot;Captain EO&quot; (a 3-D musical film starring Michael Jackson) at the California park. Disney then approached Lucas with the idea for &quot;Star Tours&quot;. With Lucas&#x27;s approval, Disney Imagineers purchased four military-grade flight simulators at a cost of $500,000 each and designed the ride structure.

Meanwhile, Lucas and his team of special effects technicians at Industrial Light &amp; Magic produced the first-person perspective film that would be projected inside the simulators. When both simulator and film were completed, a programmer then sat inside and used a joystick to synchronize the movement of the simulator with the apparent movement on screen. On January 9, 1987, at a final cost of $32 million, the ride opened to throngs of patrons, many of whom dressed up as &quot;Star Wars&quot; characters for the occasion. In celebration, Disneyland remained open for a 60-hour marathon from January 9 at 10 a.m. to January 11 at 10 p.m.

===Closing===
On August 14, 2010, Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios hosted the &quot;Last Tour To Endor&quot; event exclusively for Celebration V attendees at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios from 8pm to 1am. Entertainment features and events at &quot;Last Tour To Endor&quot; included George Lucas, character appearances, Jedi Training Academy, Death Star Disco, Bespin Stage Dance Party, &quot;Raiders Of The Lost Jedi Temple of Doom: A Fan Film of Epic Proportions&quot; live show, Hyperspace Hoopla, &quot;Symphony in the Stars&quot; fireworks, and the &quot;Star Tours&quot; shutdown ceremony. The Star Tours shutdown ceremony was a live show with characters C-3PO, R2-D2, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, and a few Stormtroopers, culminating in the official power-down of the original Disney World &quot;Star Tours&quot; attraction. However, instead of R2-D2 simply shutting it down, Boba Fett destroyed the ride&#x27;s power supply using a thermal detonator (achieved using pyrotechnics). The ride was still open after the shutdown ceremony until September 7, 2010, when the attraction held its &quot;Final Flight to Endor&quot; exclusive to D23 members.

==Attraction==
Advertised as &quot;The Ultimate &quot;Star Wars&quot; Adventure!&quot;, Star Tours puts the guest in the role of a space tourist en route to the Forest Moon of Endor, the site of the climactic battle of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, via the Star Tours travel agency. Much was made of this throughout the ride queue, which was designed to look like a spaceship boarding terminal: posters advertised voyages to different planets, and a giant screen informed riders of the benefits of going to Endor. This area was stocked with Audio-Animatronic characters that seemed to speak to the ride patrons (including C-3PO and R2-D2), as well as a life-size mock-up of a StarSpeeder 3000, the fictional spacecraft which riders were about to board. According to the book &quot;Disneyland Detective&quot; by Kendra Trahan, the figures of C-3PO and R2-D2 in the Disneyland attraction were actual props from the original trilogy, modified to operate via Audio-Animatronics.

Guests then enter a maintenance area where an apparently underproductive G2 droid performs repairs on another droid while being distracted by the observing guests, and another droid inadvertently points out all the supposed flaws of the StarSpeeder 3000 and its RX pilots. A ride attendant escorts guests to one of several loading stations where they wait for their turn to ride.

A television screen above the queue displays a countdown to take-off time and shows images of the StarSpeeder 3000 spacecraft being serviced. As launch time approaches, a safety video is shown featuring &quot;Star Wars&quot; aliens, Disney Imagineers, and their families. It instructs guests how to fasten their seat belts and where to place belongings. Once the doors to the starspeeder open, guests walk across bridges into one of the several starspeeder cabins. As the doors close, the bumbling pilot droid of the ship, RX-24 or Rex (voiced by Paul Reubens), appears on the side screen and chats to the guests about the trip as R2-D2 is loaded onto the spacecraft.

Rex lowers the cockpit shield, and the hangar crew activate the flight platform. All goes well until a slight mistake on Captain Rex&#x27;s part sends the starspeeder crashing into the maintenance bay doors and plummeting into the maintenance yard. They barely crash into the control room and nearly collide with a giant mechanical arm. Once in space, Rex asks R2-D2 to make the jump to lightspeed. However, the ship accidentally passes the Endor moon and instead gets caught inside a comet cluster. The ship gets hit by several comets before getting trapped in one of the larger comets. The StarSpeeder weaves its way through the comet and escapes by crashing through one of the walls. Upon escaping the comet, however, the ship encounters a Star Destroyer of the Imperial remnant.

The StarSpeeder gets caught in its tractor beam, but manages to get loose when a New Republic X-wing fighter provides assistance by destroying the tractor beam generator. Soon the StarSpeeder accompanies the Republic fleet on an assault on the Death Star III (later revealed by Leland Chee in 2013 to be a habitation sphere disguised as a Death Star in a plot by an Imperial warlord to distract the New Republic). Rex uses the StarSpeeder&#x27;s lasers to eliminate several TIE fighters while a Republic pilot destroys the Death Star in the same manner as Luke Skywalker by firing two proton torpedoes into the exhaust port. The X-wings jump to lightspeed as the Death Star explodes, and a final lightspeed jump sends the StarSpeeder back to the spaceport, nearly colliding with a fuel truck in the hangar and sending a Star Tours employee ducking under his desk. As the cockpit shield raises and cuts off Rex as he apologizes for the near-fatal flight, C-3PO instructs the passengers on the exit procedure and thanks them, oblivious to the perils they had faced. The exit doors opposite the entrance then open and the passengers proceed across another set of bridges into the exit hall towards the Star Trader gift shop.

===Cast===

*Ben Burtt – R2-D2
*Paul Reubens – Captain RX-24, a.k.a. Rex (voice)
*Brian Cummings – Vid-Screen Announcer (planetary destinations) (voice)
*Stephanie Taylor – Safety Instructor
*Steve Gawley – cameo as Red Leader (onboard video)

* Luq Hamet – voice of Captain RX-24 (Rex)

Muren, Gawley, and Keeler were all Industrial Light &amp; Magic computer animation staff. One year earlier, Reubens had voiced the shipboard computer in the Disney film &quot;Flight of the Navigator&quot; (credited as Paul Mall), in which his character was named Max. Reubens credited this role with his being cast for the ride.

===Ride system===
Star Tours utilized hydraulic motion base cabins featuring six degrees of freedom, including the ability to move 35 degrees in the X-Y-Z plane. The simulator was patented as Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator (ATLAS), originally designed by Rediffusion Simulation in Sussex, England, now owned by Thales Training &amp; Simulation (ex-Thomson-CSF). The Rediffusion &#x27;Leisure&#x27; simulator was originally developed for a much simpler show in Canada called &quot;Tour of the Universe&quot;, where it featured a single entrance/exit door in the rear of the cabin and a video projector. The film was front-projected onto the screen from a 70 mm film projector located beneath the cockpit barrier. The Disneyland original had four simulators, while the Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios versions each had six motion bases.

== Successor ==

The successor attraction, Star Tours – The Adventures Continue, opened in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios on May 20, 2011, and at Disneyland on June 3, 2011, replacing the parks&#x27; original Star Tours attractions. It features an updated ride system, consisting of a new high-definition video, a Dolby 3D high-definition screen, improved motion simulators, and several new special effects and Audio-animatronics.
The attraction is set at an earlier point in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; timeline (between &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot;) and is piloted by C-3PO. Rex appears as a newly-delivered droid in the queue of The Adventures Continue, and as the house DJ of Oga&#x27;s Cantina in &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge, with the latter considered official &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon and set roughly 3 decades after the events of the original Star Tours.

An episode of &quot;The Mandalorian,&quot; a Star Wars series featured on the Disney+ streaming platform, featured a group of RX-series Droids.

<text>Azam Tariq ( 10 July 1962 – 6 October 2003) was a Pakistani politician and Islamic scholar who was the leader of Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP). He was assassinated in 2003.

==Early life and education==
Azam Tariq was born on 10 July 1962 into a Punjabi Rajput farmer family to Mohammad Fateh in Chichawatni, their family roots lying in the Kalyan village of the Patiala district, now in Indian Punjab, from where they moved due to the 1947 partition.

He studied at a local madrassa and then enrolled in the Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia in Banuri Town, Karachi.

Like most madrassa students and graduates at that time, he participated in the Soviet-Afghan jihad, and when he returned, while he was the imam of the Masjid-e-Siddiq-e-Akbar in North Karachi he formed the basis of the future SSP.

==Arrest==
In August 2001, Tariq was arrested and jailed on charges of terrorism.

==Career==
Tariq was elected three times to the National Assembly of Pakistan in Jhang Sadr, even though his constituency was a predominantly Shi&#x27;a region. He contested again in the 2002 elections while in custody and was again elected. He was released in November 2002.

==Death==
Tariq was shot and killed in an attack on 6 October 2003 alongside Islamabad as he left the M-2 Motorway to enter the city. his funeral was led by Abdul Rashid Ghazi inside Lal Masjid.

The assassination was part of a growing wave of violent incidents in Pakistan between the sectarian Deobandi Wahhabi and the Shiah Muslims. Violence peaked in July 2003 with the Quetta mosque attack and the massacre of more than 50 people.

On 11 May 2017, 13 years after Tariq&#x27;s assasination, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested a suspect in his murder.

<text>Ansgarius is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. When viewed from the Earth, the crater has a highly oval shape due to foreshortening, but the rim is actually nearly circular. To the northwest of Ansgarius is the crater La Pérouse, and south is Behaim.

The rim of Ansgarius is not significantly worn, and has a interior surface. The southwest rim appears somewhat flattened rather than round, and intrudes into an older formation of which little remains except the western rim. There is an outward notch in the north-northeastern wall. The interior floor of Ansgarius is relatively flat, with only tiny craterlets to mark the surface. Ansgarius was named after Saint Ansgar, a 9th-century Benedictine missionary monk who brought Catholicism to northern Germany and Scandinavia, known as the &quot;Apostle of the North&quot;.

The crater&#x27;s name was approved by the IAU in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Ansgarius.

<text>Novus homo or homo novus (; : novi homines or homines novi) was the term in ancient Rome for a man who was the first in his family to serve in the Roman Senate or, more specifically, to be elected as consul. When a man entered public life on an unprecedented scale for a high communal office, then the term used was novus civis ( novi cives) or &quot;new citizen&quot;.

==History==

In the Early Republic, tradition held that both Senate membership and the consulship were restricted to patricians. When plebeians gained the right to this office during the Conflict of the Orders, all newly elected plebeians were naturally &quot;novi homines&quot;. With time, &quot;novi homines&quot; became progressively rarer as some plebeian families became as entrenched in the Senate as their patrician colleagues. By the time of the First Punic War, it was already a sensation that &quot;novi homines&quot; were elected consuls in two consecutive years (Gaius Fundanius Fundulus in 243 BC and Gaius Lutatius Catulus in 242 BC). In 63 BC, Cicero became the first &quot;novus homo&quot; to be consul in more than thirty years.

By the Late Republic, the distinction between the orders became less important. The consuls came from a new elite, the &quot;nobiles&quot; (noblemen), an artificial aristocracy of all who could demonstrate direct descent in the male line from a consul.

==&quot;Topos&quot; of the &quot;new man&quot;==
The literary theme of &quot;homo novus&quot;, or &quot;how the lowly born but inherently worthy man may properly rise to eminence in the world&quot; was the &quot;topos&quot; of Seneca&#x27;s influential Epistle XLIV. At the endpoint of Late Antiquity, it was likewise a subject in Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot; (iii, vi). In the Middle Ages Dante&#x27;s &quot;Convivio&quot; (book IV) and Petrarch&#x27;s &quot;De remediis utriusque fortunae&quot; (I.16; II.5) take up the subject, and Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Wife of Bath&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

In its Christian renderings, the theme suggested a tension in the &quot;scala naturae&quot; or great chain of being, one that was produced through the agency of Man&#x27;s free will.

The theme came naturally to Renaissance humanists who were often &quot;homines novi&quot; rising by their own wits in a network of noble courts that depended on the highly literate new men to run increasingly complicated chancelries and create the cultural propaganda that was a contemporary vehicle for noble fame, and that consequently offered a kind of intellectual &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. In the fifteenth century Buonaccorso da Montemagno&#x27;s &quot;Dialogus de vera nobilitate&quot; treated of the &quot;true nobility&quot; inherent in the worthy individual; Poggio Bracciolini also wrote at length &quot;De nobilitate&quot;, stressing the Renaissance view of human responsibility and effectiveness that are at the heart of Humanism: &quot;sicut virtutis ita et nobilitatis sibi quisque existit auctor et opifex&quot;.

Briefer summaries of the theme were to be found in Francesco Patrizi, (VI.1), and in Rodrigo Sánchez de Arévalo&#x27;s encyclopedic &quot;Speculum vitae humanae&quot;. In the sixteenth century these and new texts came to be widely printed and distributed. Sánchez de Arévalo&#x27;s &quot;Speculum&quot; was first printed at Rome, 1468, and there are more than twenty fifteenth-century printings; German, French and Spanish translations were printed. The characters of Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot; (1528) discuss the requirement that a &quot;cortegiano&quot; be noble (I.XIV-XVI). This was translated into French, Spanish, English, Latin and other languages. Jerónimo Osório da Fonseca&#x27;s &quot;De nobilitate&quot; (Lisbon 1542, and seven reprintings in the sixteenth century), stressing &quot;propria strennuitas&quot; (&quot;one&#x27;s own determined striving&quot;) received an English translation in 1576.

The Roman figure most often cited as an &quot;exemplum&quot; is Gaius Marius, whose speech of self-justification was familiar to readers from the set-piece in Sallust&#x27;s &quot;Bellum Jugurthinum&quot;, 85; the most familiar format in the Renaissance treatises is a dialogue that contrasts the two sources of nobility, with the evidence weighted in favor of the &quot;new man&quot;.

<text>Rubinomics, a portmanteau of Rubin and economics, was originally used to collectively describe the economic policies of President of the United States Bill Clinton. It is named after Robert E. Rubin, former United States Secretary of the Treasury.

Rubinomics emphasizes the effect that balancing the government budget has on long-term interest rates. Taxes should match government spending in the long run, and deficit-financed tax cuts are a counter-productive way to increase growth. This can be seen as a form of the fiscal theory of the price level – fiscal policy affecting long term inflation (as expressed by long-term interest rates).

Rubinomics has never rejected Keynesian approaches to economics, which call for the government to run a deficit in times of recession. But it worries about the long-term effect that deficits, especially structural deficits, have on inflation. 

During the early 1990s, long-term interest rates remained stubbornly high even as the Federal Reserve cut the Federal Funds rate. Rubin and most other economists (including Alan Greenspan) attributed this high yield curve to an &quot;inflation premium&quot; that bond-traders were demanding. Reducing interest rates, Rubin argued, would lead to increased private sector investment and consumption and, therefore, stronger growth. Clinton, who had campaigned on the promise to put people first and invest in human capital, accepted Rubin&#x27;s reasoning and put deficit reduction at the forefront of his economic plan, to the chagrin of more left-wing advisers such as Robert Reich and Joseph Stiglitz. In particular, Stiglitz was not opposed to Clinton&#x27;s plan to reduce the deficit, but suggested that Clinton put more money into research and development, technology, infrastructure, and education, quoting &quot;given the high returns for these investments, GDP in 2000 would have been even higher, and the economy&#x27;s growth potential would have been stronger.&quot;

<text>Frank Probasco Bohn (July 14, 1866 – June 1, 1944) was a politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served three terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1927 to 1933.

==Early life and education==
Bohn was born in Charlottesville, Indiana, where he attended public high school. He attended Danville Normal College in Danville, Indiana, and graduated from the Medical College of Indiana, Indianapolis in 1890.

==Political career==
Bohn ran unsuccessfully as a Democrat for the Michigan House of Representatives from the Delta District in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 1896. He worked as a banker and was village president of Newberry, Michigan, 1904–1919, and a member of the Newberry School Board, 1908-1914. He was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican primary election for Lieutenant Governor of Michigan in 1916. He was a member of the Michigan Senate from the 30th District, 1923-1926.

Bohn defeated incumbent Republican Frank D. Scott in the primary election in 1926.

<doc id="1047149" wikidata="Q768465" url="?curid=1047149" title="C. I. Scofield">
<text>Cyrus Ingerson Scofield (August 19, 1843 – July 24, 1921) was an American theologian, minister, and writer whose best-selling annotated Bible popularized futurism and dispensationalism among fundamentalist Christians.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Cyrus Scofield was born in Clinton Township, Lenawee County, Michigan, the seventh and last child of Elias and Abigail Goodrich Scofield. Elias Scofield&#x27;s ancestors were of English and Puritan descent, but the family was nominally Episcopalian. Abigail Scofield died three months after Cyrus&#x27; birth, and his father twice remarried during Cyrus&#x27;s childhood. Details of his early education are unknown, but there is no reason to doubt his later testimony that he was an enthusiastic reader and that he had studied Shakespeare and Homer.

===Civil War service===
By 1861, Scofield was living with relatives in Lebanon, Tennessee. At the beginning of the American Civil War, the 17-year-old Scofield enlisted as a private in the 7th Tennessee Infantry, C.S.A., and his regiment fought at Cheat Mountain, Seven Pines, and Antietam. In 1862, after spending a month in Chimborazo Hospital in Richmond, Virginia, Scofield successfully petitioned for a discharge. Scofield then returned to Lebanon and was conscripted again into Confederate service. Ordered to McMinnville, Tennessee, Scofield deserted and escaped behind Union lines in Bowling Green, Kentucky. After taking the Union oath of allegiance, Scofield was allowed safe passage to St. Louis, Missouri, where he settled.

===Lawyer and politician===
In 1866, he married Leontine LeBeau Cerrè, a member of a prominent French Catholic family in St. Louis. Scofield apprenticed in the law office of his brother-in-law and then worked in the St. Louis assessor&#x27;s office before moving to Atchison, Kansas, in late 1869. In 1871, Scofield was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives, first from Atchison for one year and then from Nemaha County, for a second. In 1873 he worked for the election of John J. Ingalls as senator from Kansas, and when Ingalls won, the new senator had Scofield appointed U. S. District Attorney for Kansas—at 29, the youngest in the country. Nevertheless, that same year Scofield was forced to resign &quot;under a cloud of scandal&quot; because of questionable financial transactions, which may have included accepting bribes from railroads, stealing political contributions intended for Ingalls, and securing bank promissory notes by forging signatures. It is possible Scofield was jailed on forgery charges, although there is no extant evidence in the public records.

Perhaps in part because of his self-confessed heavy drinking, Scofield abandoned his wife and two daughters during this period. Leontine Cerrè Scofield divorced him on grounds of desertion in 1883, and the same year Scofield married Hettie Hall von Wartz, with whom he eventually had a son.

===Conversion and ministerial career===
====Pastorates====
According to Scofield, he was converted to evangelical Christianity through the testimony of a lawyer acquaintance. Certainly by the late fall of 1879, Scofield was assisting in the St. Louis evangelistic campaign conducted by Dwight L. Moody, and he served as the secretary of the St. Louis YMCA. Significantly, Scofield came under the mentorship of James H. Brookes, pastor of Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, St. Louis, a prominent dispensationalist premillennialist.

In October 1883, Scofield was ordained as a Congregationalist minister—while his divorce was proceeding but not yet final—and he accepted the pastorate of a small mission church founded by that denomination, which became the First Congregational Church of Dallas, Texas (now Scofield Memorial Church). The church grew from fourteen to over five hundred members before he resigned its pastorate in 1895. In 1895, Scofield was called as pastor of Moody&#x27;s church, the Trinitarian Congregational Church of East Northfield, Massachusetts. Scofield also attempted with limited success to take charge of Moody&#x27;s Northfield Bible Training School.

====Interest in missions====
In 1888, Scofield attended the Niagara Bible Conference where he met pioneer missionary to China, Hudson Taylor. Taylor&#x27;s approach to Christian missions influenced Scofield to found the Central American Mission in 1890 (now Camino Global). Scofield also served as superintendent of the American Home Missionary Society of Texas and Louisiana. In 1890, he founded Lake Charles College (1890–1899) in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

====Fundamentalist leader====
As the author of the pamphlet &quot;Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth&quot; (1888), Scofield soon became a leader in dispensational premillennialism, a forerunner of twentieth-century Christian fundamentalism. Although, in theory, Scofield returned to his Dallas pastorate in 1903, his projected reference Bible consumed much of his energy, and he was also mostly either unwell or in Europe. When the &quot;Scofield Reference Bible&quot; was published in 1909, it quickly became the most influential statement of dispensational premillennialism, and Scofield&#x27;s popularity as Bible conference speaker increased as his health continued to decline. Royalties from the work were substantial, and Scofield bought real estate in Dallas, Ashuelot, New Hampshire, and Douglaston, Long Island. He also joined the prestigious Lotos Club.

Scofield left the liberalizing Congregational Church to become a Southern Presbyterian and moved to the New York City area where he supervised a correspondence and lay institute, the New York Night School of the Bible. In 1914, he founded the Philadelphia School of the Bible in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (now Cairn University).

====Personal life====
During the early 1890s, Scofield began styling himself Rev. C. I. Scofield, D.D.; but there are no extant records of any academic institution having granted him the honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. Scofield&#x27;s second wife proved a faithful companion and editing assistant, but his relationships with his children, including librarian Abigail Scofield Kellogg, were distant at best. Scofield died at his home on Long Island in 1921.

==Religious significance==
Scofield&#x27;s correspondence Bible study course was the basis for his &quot;Reference Bible&quot;, an annotated, and widely circulated, study Bible first published in 1909 by Oxford University Press. Scofield&#x27;s notes teach futurism and dispensationalism, a theology advanced in the early nineteenth century by the Anglo-Irish clergyman John Nelson Darby, who like Scofield had been trained as a lawyer. Dispensationalism emphasizes the distinctions between the New Testament Church and ancient Israel of the Old Testament. Scofield believed that between creation and the final judgment there are seven distinct eras of God&#x27;s dealing with humanity and that these eras are a framework around which the message of the Bible can be explained. It was largely through the influence of Scofield&#x27;s notes that dispensational premillennialism became influential among fundamentalist Christians in the United States, and these notes became a significant source for popular religious writers such as Hal Lindsey.

Scofield had a significant influence on the Christian Zionist movement. In the &quot;Scofield Bible&quot;, he wrote that antisemitism was a sin. Citing Genesis 12:3 - &quot;I will bless them that bless thee&quot; - Scofield argued that &quot;The man or nation that lifts a voice or hand against Israel invites the wrath of God.&quot;

== Other theological views ==

=== Soteriology ===
Cyrus Scofield was a type of Calvinist. However, he rejected limited atonement and attempted to teach only a softer form of the perseverance of the saints. He rejected any notions of placing one&#x27;s assurance in their sanctification. Scofield&#x27;s understanding of eternal rewards has influenced those of modern Free Grace theologians.

=== Anthropology ===
Scofield held to trichotomy, interpreting man as a trifold being, with a body, soul and spirit, viewing the threeness of humanity to be derived from the image of the triune God.

<text>Blood Law, in some traditional Native American communities, is the severe, usually capital punishment of certain serious crimes. The responsibility for delivering this justice has traditionally fallen to the family or clan of the victim, usually a male relative. 

==Description==
Currently in the United States, only state and federal governments or military courts can impose the death penalty. Justice under Blood Law would be considered revenge killing or summary murder, and also could be an additional aggravating circumstance requiring the death penalty for the crime.

Historically, a &quot;cursory survey of the ethnohistorical literature indicates that death was the standard punishment [for witchcraft] among Native American societies,&quot; including the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Creek, Delaware, Hopi, Miami, Natchez, Navajo and Seneca. 

In 1824 the western Cherokee passed new laws &quot;forbidding the wanton killing of suspected witches&quot;. However, traditional views concerning personal or family-enforced retribution for serious crimes appear to have continued in both the Cherokee and Creek communities throughout the 19th Century, and in some communities through into the present day.

<doc id="1047158" wikidata="Q27439" url="?curid=1047158" title="Dilong paradoxus">
<text>Dilong (帝龍, which means &#x27;emperor dragon&#x27;) is a genus of small basal tyrannosauroid dinosaurs. The only species in the genus is Dilong paradoxus, known from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of East Asia (in what is now China). The discovery of &quot;Dilong&quot; was significant as it provided the first evidence of feathers in tyrannosaurs, something which had previously been suspected for the group.

==Discovery==

The &quot;Dilong&quot; holotype specimen was found in the Lujiatun Unit of the Yixian Formation near Lujiatun, Beipiao, in western Liaoning Province, China. This formation contains rocks dating to between 125.8–126 million years old. However, specimens have been found in other areas of the Yixian Formation which may vary in age.

&quot;Dilong&quot; was described by Xu Xing and colleagues in 2004. The name is derived from the Chinese 帝 &quot;dì&quot; meaning &#x27;emperor&#x27; and 龙 / 龍 &quot;lóng&quot; meaning &#x27;dragon&#x27;. &quot;Di&quot;, &quot;emperor&quot;, refers to the relationship of this animal to &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, the &quot;king&quot; tyrannosaurid. &quot;Long&quot; is used to name Chinese dinosaurs in much the same way that the ancient Greek &quot;-saur&quot; is in the West. The specific name, &quot;paradoxus&quot;, is a Latinisation of the Ancient Greek παράδοξον meaning &#x27;against received wisdom&#x27;.

==Description==
The type specimen is IVPP 14243 (Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing), a nearly complete, semi-articulated, skull and skeleton. Referred material includes IVPP 1242, a nearly complete skull and presacral vertebrae, TNP01109 (Tianjin Museum of Natural History), a partial skull, and IVPP V11579, another skull which may belong to &quot;D. paradoxus&quot;, or to a related species. The type specimen of &quot;Dilong&quot; was about in length, but it is thought to be a juvenile and may have been over long when fully grown. Gregory S. Paul estimated that a long individual would have weighed .

===Feathers===
&quot;Dilong paradoxus&quot; had a covering of simple feathers or protofeathers. The feathers were seen in fossilized skin impressions from near the jaw and tail. They are not identical to modern bird feathers, lacking a central shaft and most likely used for warmth, since they could not have enabled flight. Adult tyrannosaurs, found in Alberta and Mongolia have skin impressions which appear to show the pebbly scales typical of other dinosaurs. Xu et al. (2004) speculated that the tyrannosauroids may have had different skin coverings on different parts of their bodies—perhaps mixing scales and feathers. They also speculated that feathers may correlate negatively with body size—that juveniles may have been feathered, then shed the feathers and expressed only scales as the animal became larger and no longer needed insulation to stay warm.

==Classification==

When &quot;Dilong&quot; was first described, it was considered one of the earliest and most primitive members of Tyrannosauroidea, the group that includes the later, larger tyrannosaurids such as &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. At least one later study, by Turner and colleagues in 2007, reanalyzed the relationships of coelurosaurian dinosaurs, including &quot;Dilong&quot;, and found that it was not a tyrannosauroid. Rather, they placed &quot;Dilong&quot; two steps above the tyrannosauroids in their phylogeny; more advanced than &quot;Coelurus&quot;, but more primitive than the Compsognathidae. However, other studies continued to find &quot;Dilong&quot; as a tyrannosauroid, and some (such as Carr &amp; Williamson 2010) found &quot;Dilong&quot; to fall within Tyrannosauroidea, not among the more advanced coelurosaurs.

Below is a cladogram containing most tyrannosauroids by Loewen &quot;et al.&quot; in 2013.

In a 2014 study, &quot;Dilong&quot; was found to be a proceratosaurid. However, in an analysis by Brusatte &quot;et al.&quot; in 2016, both parsimony and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses placed &quot;Dilong&quot; outside of Proceratosauridae, as a slightly more advanced tyrannosauroid. In 2024, the describers of &quot;Alpkarakush&quot; recovered &quot;Dilong&quot; and proceratosaurids (&quot;Proceratosaurus&quot; and &quot;Guanlong&quot;) outside Tyrannosauroidea based on their phylogenetic analysis.

==Paleobiology==

Braincase scans indicate that &quot;Dilong&quot; had an S-shaped brain protected by thin meninges, unlike &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; which has a more linear brain protected by thicker meninges; this is probably a size-related trait, as it is in crocodilians. The large flocculus of &quot;Dilong&quot; suggests it was agile and had good balance, while small olfactory tracts suggest that its sense of smell was not as refined as that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and other more advanced tyrannosauroids.

<doc id="1047161" wikidata="Q1180267" url="?curid=1047161" title="Chapters and verses of the Bible">
<text>Chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts of Jewish or Christian bibles; such divisions form part of the paratext of the Bible. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible have presented all but the shortest of the scriptural books with divisions into chapters, generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century, editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses – each consisting of a few short lines or of one or more sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of Ephesians 2:8–9, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of Genesis 1:2.

The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians. For instance, Jewish tradition regards the ascriptions to many Psalms as independent verses or as parts of the subsequent verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered, resulting in 116 more verses in Jewish versions than in the Christian texts. Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have 1 Chronicles 5:27–41 where Christian translations have 1 Chronicles 6:1–15.

==History==
===Chapters===

Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers. In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs (parashot) that were identified by two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Peh (פ‎) indicated an &quot;open&quot; paragraph that began on a new line, while Samekh (ס‎) indicated a &quot;closed&quot; paragraph that began on the same line after a small space. These two letters begin the Hebrew words open () and closed (), and are, themselves, open in shape (פ) and closed (ס). The earliest known copies of the Book of Isaiah from the Dead Sea Scrolls used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the Masoretic divisions.

The Hebrew Bible was also divided into some larger sections. In Israel, the Torah (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia, it was divided into 53 or 54 sections (Parashat ha-Shavua) so it could be read through in one year. The New Testament was divided into topical sections known as kephalaia by the fourth century. Eusebius of Caesarea divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or &quot;canons&quot;. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions. (See fuller discussions below.)

Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th-century Tours manuscript Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.

Cardinal archbishop Stephen Langton and Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.

While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them. Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul&quot; (1707), Alexander Campbell&#x27;s &quot;The Sacred Writings&quot; (1826), Daniel Berkeley Updike&#x27;s fourteen-volume &quot;The Holy Bible Containing the Old and New Testaments and the Apocrypha,&quot; Richard Moulton&#x27;s &quot;The Modern Reader&#x27;s Bible&quot; (1907), Ernest Sutherland Bates&#x27;s &quot;The Bible Designed to Be Read as Living Literature&quot; (1936), &quot;The Books of the Bible&quot; (2007) from the International Bible Society (Biblica), Adam Lewis Greene&#x27;s five-volume &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; (2014), and the six-volume ESV Reader&#x27;s Bible (2016) from Crossway Books.

===Verses===

Since at least 916 the Tanakh has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in Masoretic vocalization and cantillation markings. One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the &quot;sof passuq&quot;, symbol for a period or sentence break, resembling the colon (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the Hebrew Bible into English, versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew sentence breaks, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus&#x27;s work for the first Hebrew Bible concordance around 1440.

The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was the Italian Dominican biblical scholar Santes Pagnino (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted. His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today. The Parisian printer Robert Estienne created another numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament, which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne&#x27;s system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.

The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by William Whittingham (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the Geneva Bible published shortly afterwards by Sir Rowland Hill in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.

==Jewish tradition==

The Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:

===&quot;Passukim&quot;===
Most important are the verses, or &quot;passukim&quot; (MH spelling; now pronounced &quot;pesukim&quot; by all speakers). According to Talmudic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin. In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse, or &quot;sof passuk&quot;, is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a &quot;silluq&quot; (which means &quot;stop&quot;). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two vertical dots following the word with a &quot;silluq&quot;.

===&quot;Parashot&quot;===
The Masoretic Text also contains sections, or portions, called &quot;parashot&quot; or &quot;parashiyot&quot;. The end of a &quot;parashah&quot; is usually indicated by a space within a line (a &quot;closed&quot; section) or a new line beginning (an &quot;open&quot; section). The division of the text reflected in the &quot;parashot&quot; is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the &quot;parashot&quot; are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.

In early manuscripts (most importantly in Tiberian Masoretic manuscripts, such as the Aleppo codex), an &quot;open&quot; section may also be represented by a blank line, and a &quot;closed&quot; section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed Hebrew Bibles. In this system, the one rule differentiating &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; sections is that &quot;open&quot; sections must &quot;always&quot; start at the beginning of a new line, while &quot;closed&quot; sections &quot;never&quot; start at the beginning of a new line.

===&quot;Sedarim&quot;===
Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic Text is the division into &quot;sedarim&quot;. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the &quot;quantity&quot; of text. For the Torah, this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.

==Christian versions==
Christians also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called &quot;kephalaia&quot; (singular &quot;kephalaion&quot;, literally meaning &quot;heading&quot;).

Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro is often given credit for first dividing the Latin Vulgate into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal Stephen Langton who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. Robert Estienne (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1553 (Hebrew Bible).

Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. Biblica published such a version of the NIV in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, Crossway published the ESV Reader&#x27;s Bible and &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; published a modified ASV.

<doc id="1047167" wikidata="Q3205376" url="?curid=1047167" title="The Provoked Wife">
<text>The Provoked Wife (1697) is the second original comedy written by John Vanbrugh. It made its first appearance in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in May, 1697. The premise of the plot, of a wife trapped in an abusive marriage might consider either leaving it or taking a lover, outraged some sections of Restoration society. A later unfinished play by Vanbrugh was completed by Colley Cibber and staged under the title &quot;The Provoked Husband&quot; in 1728.

==Plot==
The hitherto virtuous Lady Brute is provoked to infidelity by her sour husband Sir John Brute. Married in haste – she for money, he for sex – the Brutes are shackled by wedlock but looking for diversions. He goes off for a drunken night on the town and ends up before a magistrate, disguised in his wife&#x27;s frock. Meanwhile, Lady Brute and her niece Belinda dress as Shepherd Market doxies for a secret tryst with their suitors Heartfree and Constant and are spied on by the envious Lady Fanciful, who wants Heartfree for herself. Belinda, despite interference from Lady Fanciful, wins her man and marries for love. But it ends sadly for the boozy Brute who attempts to rape his wife, discovers two gallants lurking in his wardrobe and finally ends up accepting certain situations rather than becoming a human pincushion (i.e., fighting a duel to satisfy his honor).

== Analysis ==
Writer and Professor of English Frank McCormick raises doubt on the often-repeated claim that Vanbrugh wrote part of his comedy &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; in the Bastille being based on allusions in a couple of much later memoirs. It is different in tone from his first play, the largely farcical 1696 comedy &quot;The Relapse&quot;, and adapted to the greater acting skills of the new company of actors chosen for its premiere, who walked out not long before in a dispute with management.

The actors&#x27; cooperative boasted the established star performers of the age, and Vanbrugh tailored &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; to their specialties. While &quot;The Relapse&quot; had been robustly phrased to be suitable for amateurs and minor acting talents, he could count on versatile professionals like Thomas Betterton, Elizabeth Barry, and the rising young star Anne Bracegirdle to do justice to characters of depth and nuance.

&quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; is a comedy, but Elizabeth Barry who played the abused wife was especially famous as a tragic actress, and for her power of &quot;moving the passions&quot;, i.e., moving an audience to pity and tears. Barry and the younger Bracegirdle had often worked together as a tragicomic heroine pair to bring audiences the typically tragicomic rollercoaster experience of Restoration plays. Vanbrugh takes advantage of this schema and these actresses to deepen audience sympathy for the unhappily married Lady Brute, even as she fires off her witty ripostes. In the intimate conversational dialogue between Lady Brute and her niece Belinda (Bracegirdle), and especially in the star part of Sir John Brute the brutish husband (Betterton), which was hailed as one of the peaks of Thomas Betterton&#x27;s remarkable career, &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; is something as unusual as a Restoration problem play.

==Adaptations==
One of the first radio adaptations was broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 15 June 1948. The production was adapted by Ronald Simpson, and the cast included Norman Shelley as Sir John Brute, Lydia Sherwood as Lady Brute, Ellen Pollock as Lady Fanciful.

In 1963 Prospect Productions (Oxford Playhouse) presented at Century Theatre, Binsey. They presented in Oxford as well. Toby Robertson, producer, June Brown, Trevor Martin (Sir John Brute), John Bonney, Tim Seely as gallants and An Bell as Bellinda, Eileen Atkins as Lady Brute. Josephine Woodford as the maid, Robert Arnold her suitor and Edward Hardwicke as the J.P. Alan Barrett provided sets and it featured the &quot;clever pastiche&quot; of Madeleine Dring. It was repeated at Georgian Theatre, Richmond, Yorkshire. This show was brought to London to the Vaudeville.

Trevor Peacock played Sir John Brute, Prunella Scales Lady Brute and Zoe Wanamaker Belinda in a production at the Watford Palace Theatre 21 February – 10 March 1973.

In 1991, the play was presented in the short-lived open-air theatre at the Weald and Downland Museum near Chichester. It starred Sam Kelly as Sir John Brute and Philippa Urquhart as Lady Fanciful.

On 12 December 2004, BBC Radio 3 broadcast an adaptation by Jim Poyser directed by Pauline Harris. The cast included Julian Rhind-Tutt as Heartfree, Tom Mannion as Constant, Dave Hill as Sir John Brute, Saskia Reeves as Lady Brute, Sarah Smart as Belinda, Josie Lawrence as Lady Fanciful, Tonia Chauvet as Claudette, David Crellin as Colonel Bully and Alexander Delamere as Lord Rake. The production was re-broadcast on 19 July 2015.

In March, 2010 the Generation Theatre of San Francisco, CA presented &quot;Provoquée&quot;, a play by Roland David Valayre (who also directed the production) based on &quot;The Provoked Wife&quot; and performed entirely in French, at the Off Market Theater, San Francisco. the cast included Cécile Lejeune, Françoise Lejeune, Benoît Levet, Michel Gasquy, Pierre-Yves Gouret, Marion Lovinger, Vincent Madiot, Thierry Rosset and Mireille Sagne. Generation Theatre later produced the actual Vanbrugh play 17 April – 4 May 2014.

In June 2014 Michael Cordner directed the play at the Department of Theatre, Film and Television, University of York.

The play was performed as part of the summer 2019 season at the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed by Phillip Breen.

<text>Burns Singer (29 August 1928 – 8 September 1964) was born James Hyman Singer in New York City. He was a Scottish poet and translator.

==Early life and education==
Though he was born in New York, from the age of four, Singer was brought up in Scotland and educated in Glasgow. At the age of 15 he already had well-developed and original literary interests.

Singer&#x27;s father was a Manchester-born second-generation Jewish immigrant from Poland, his mother was of Irish, Scottish and Norwegian background. Singer would go on to adopt her maiden name, Burns. Singer showed considerable interest in Polish poetry. His collaborative translations of Polish poets included Ignacy Krasicki, Juliusz Słowacki, Cyprian Norwid and Jerzy Peterkiewicz. Some of these appeared in the anthology &quot;Five Centuries of Polish Poetry, 1450–1950&quot; (1962), with Peterkiewicz, and a later edition.

==Career and marriage==
While in Scotland Singer studied English composition for two terms at the University of Glasgow and then zoology. In 1945, at age 17, between two periods at Glasgow university, Singer went to Cornwall where he came into contact with W. S. Graham, a major poetic influence. Singer then had a period of several years when he travelled and worked in Europe. After the 1951 suicide of his mother he returned to Scotland where he worked for four years the marine biology lab in Aberdeen, supporting his father. He had by then spent a year in Marburg and done some service in the United States Army. In 1955, he married Marie Battle, an African-American psychologist; they moved to London, where he sought freelance work writing. He enjoyed a period of success in literary journalism and as a poet. &quot;Still and All&quot; (1957) was the only collection of his poetry published during his lifetime and was the Poetry Book Society Recommendation for that year&quot;.&quot; In 1960 he published with Jerzy Peterkiewicz &quot;Five Centuries of Polish Poetry&quot;, a selection of translations. It is considered that his style was a &quot;middle way&quot; or compromise, between the New Apocalyptics and The Movement, or the Scottish Renaissance and the Sassenach.

==Death==
He spent some time with Marie in Cambridge, before ultimately returning to marine biology. His early death, in Plymouth, was from a heart attack. His ashes were scattered at sea. There is a memorial to Singer in the churchyard of St Mary the Less (Little St Mary&#x27;s) in Cambridge.

<doc id="1047173" wikidata="Q2081431" url="?curid=1047173" title="Integrator">
<text>An integrator in measurement and control applications is an element whose output signal is the time integral of its input signal. It accumulates the input quantity over a defined time to produce a representative output.

Integration is an important part of many engineering and scientific applications. Mechanical integrators are the oldest type and are still used for metering water flow or electrical power. Electronic analogue integrators, which have generally displaced mechanical integrators, are the basis of analog computers and charge amplifiers. Integration can also be performed by algorithms in digital computers.

== Mechanical integrators ==

One simple kind of mechanical integrator is the disk-and-wheel integrator. This functions by placing a wheel on and perpendicular to a spinning disk, held there by means of a freely spinning shaft parallel to the disk. Because the speed at which a part of the disk turns is proportional to its distance from the center, the rate at which the wheel turns is proportional to its distance from the center of the disk. Therefore, the number of turns made by the integrating wheel is equal to the definite integral of the integrating wheel&#x27;s distance from the center, which is in turn controlled by the motion of the shaft relative to the disk.

==In signal processing circuits==
A &quot;current integrator&quot; is an electronic device performing a time integration of an electric current, thus measuring a total electric charge. In combination with time it can be used to determine the average current during an experiment. Feeding current into a capacitor (initialized with zero volts) and monitoring the capacitor&#x27;s voltage has been used in nuclear physics experiments before 1953 to measure the number of ions received. Such a simple circuit works because the capacitor&#x27;s current–voltage relation when written in integral form mathematically states that a capacitor&#x27;s final voltage equals its initial voltage plus the time integral of its current divided by its capacitance:

formula_1

More sophisticated current integrator circuits build on this relation, such as the charge amplifier. A current integrator is also used to measure the electric charge on a Faraday cup in a residual gas analyzer to measure partial pressures of gasses in a vacuum. Another application of current integration is in ion beam deposition, where the measured charge directly corresponds to the number of ions deposited on a substrate, assuming the charge state of the ions is known. The two current-carrying electrical leads must to be connected to the ion source and the substrate, closing the electric circuit which in part is given by the ion beam.

A &quot;voltage integrator&quot; is an electronic device performing a time integration of an electric voltage, thus measuring the total volt-second product. A first-order low-pass filter such as a resistor–capacitor circuit acts like a voltage integrator at high frequencies well above the filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency.

=== Op amp integrator ===

:&quot;See also Integrator at op amp applications and op amp integrator&quot;

An ideal op amp integrator (e.g. Figure 1) is a voltage integrator that works over all frequencies (limited by the op amp&#x27;s gain–bandwidth product) and provides gain.

==== Drawbacks of ideal op amp integrator ====
* For DC input (&quot;f&quot; = 0), the capacitive reactance &quot;X&quot; is infinite. Because of this, the op amp gets effectively in an open loop configuration, which has infinite open-loop gain (for an ideal op amp, or simply very large for real op amps). Hence, any small input offset voltages are also amplified and appears at output as a large error. This is referred as false triggering and must be avoided.
Thus, an ideal integrator needs to be modified with additional components to reduce the effect of an error voltage in practice. This modified integrator is referred as practical integrator.

==== Practical op amp integrator ====
Main description at: 

The gain of an integrator at low frequency can be limited to avoid the saturation problem, by shunting the feedback capacitor with a feedback resistor. This practical integrator acts as a low-pass filter with constant gain in its low frequency pass band. It only performs integration in high frequencies, not in low frequencies, so bandwidth for integrating is limited.

== Applications ==
*Integrating circuits are most commonly used in analog-to-digital converters, ramp generators, and also in wave shaping applications.
* Op-amp integrating amplifiers are used to perform calculus operations in analog computers.
* A totalizer in the industrial instrumentation trade integrates a signal representing water flow, producing a signal representing the total quantity of water that has passed by the flow meter.

==In software==

* Integrators may also be software components.
* In some computational physics computer simulations, such as numerical weather prediction, molecular dynamics, flight simulators, reservoir simulation, noise barrier design, architectural acoustics, and electronic circuit simulation, an integrator is a numerical method for integrating trajectories from forces (and thereby accelerations) that are only calculated at discrete time steps.

==Mechanical integrators==
Mechanical integrators were key elements in the mechanical differential analyser, used to solve practical physical problems. Mechanical integration mechanisms were also used in control systems such as regulating flows or temperature in industrial processes. Mechanisms such as the ball-and-disk integrator were used both for computation in differential analysers and as components of instruments such as naval gun directors, flow totalizers and others. A planimeter is a mechanical device used for calculating the definite integral of a curve given in graphical form, or more generally finding the area of a closed curve. An integraph is used to plot the indefinite integral of a function given in graphical form.

<doc id="1047175" wikidata="Q2679211" url="?curid=1047175" title="8 Eyes">
<text>is a 2D action platform game developed by Thinking Rabbit for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. The game features eight levels, and can be played by one or two players. It also features a large, diverse soundtrack, composed by Kenzou Kumei, consisting of three pieces for each of the eight levels, that are set in different parts of the world.

Piko Interactive acquired the rights of &quot;8 Eyes&quot; and released it for Windows via Steam on August 14, 2019. &quot;8 Eyes&quot; is also included in Evercade &quot;Piko Interactive Collection 1&quot; that was released on June 18, 2020.

==Story==

===English version===
&quot;8 Eyes&quot; is set in a post-apocalyptic future. Mankind is recovering from hundreds of years of chaos and nuclear war, and civilization is being rebuilt by the Great King, who harnesses the power of eight jewels. The jewels, known as the 8 Eyes, were formed at the centers of eight nuclear explosions that came close to destroying Earth. The 8 Eyes have mysterious power which, in the wrong hands, could bring about the end of the world. The Great King&#x27;s eight power-hungry dukes steal the jewels for themselves and banish the King to the nuclear wastelands, threatening to once again plunge the Earth into war.

The player controls Orin the Falconer and his fighting falcon Cutrus. His mission is to infiltrate the Dukes&#x27; eight castles and retrieve the 8 Eyes. With the help of Cutrus, Orin must fight the Dukes&#x27; soldiers, nuclear mutants, and the duke of each castle to retrieve the jewels. After the jewels have been recovered, Orin must return them to the Altar of Peace so that the Great King may return and finish rebuilding the Earth.

===Japanese version===
The Japanese version of the game is set in the Balkans in the late 19th century. The Ottoman Empire, which had barely survived due to the power balance among the great European powers, was beginning to feel the shadow of its survival. The seeds of various conflicts, which had been so densely packed that it was called the &quot;Powder Keg of the Balkans,&quot; were now igniting all at once. Terrorism and assassinations of important people by the Free Armenian Army were already commonplace. With the dignity of the government in turmoil and pessimistic rumors and speculation abound, an incident occurred that made restoring public order the most urgent task for the British Empire, which had Ottoman Turkey as its protectorate. 

A research team was sent by the British Museum to investigate some newly discovered ruins. However, the entire team was brutally slaughtered, with their heads missing and their stomachs cut open. All of the artifacts they uncovered and their excavation journals were stolen.

The perpetrator of the murders was a group led by Ruth Grandier, a female bandit known for her demonic worship who claimed that she and her group were fallen children of Lucifer. The College of Arms learned that Ruth&#x27;s group stole artifacts which concealed demonic secrets and could be used in a dark ritual to resurrect demons.

To stop Ruth, the College of Arms Seventh Division (which would eventually become the MI5) decided to send Baronet Sir Julian James Bond, the greatest swordsman in all of England. Sir Bond infiltrated the Balkans along with his pet eagle, Cutlass.

==Gameplay==
The game consists of eight levels, each set in the castle of one of the dukes. At the completion of each level, Orin receives a new sword. The player can choose to play each of the first seven castles in any order, though the boss at the end of each is vulnerable to only one sword. It is therefore easier to play levels in a particular order. There are hints about the correct order hidden throughout the game. Only after each has been completed can the House of Ruth be played.

After the House of Ruth has been cleared and the 8 Eyes recovered, the player must return the jewels to the Altar of Peace. At this point the jewels must be placed in a particular order, or the game is lost. Hints about the order of the jewels are also hidden throughout the game.

&quot;8 Eyes&quot; features a cooperative mode in which one player controls Orin and the other player controls Cutrus. In the single-player mode, the player has limited control of both characters simultaneously, making the game significantly more difficult. The gameplay and graphical style are noticeably similar to &quot;Castlevania&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;8 Eyes&quot; received mediocre reviews upon its release. &quot;Power Play&quot; gave the game a 60/100. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; scored &quot;8 Eyes&quot; 23/40.

<doc id="1047177" wikidata="Q3271063" url="?curid=1047177" title="Sola Air Station">
<text>Sola Air Station () is a base for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. It is located in Sola municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. Rescue Helicopter Service is stationed at Sola along with Helicopter Squadron 330.

Also located at Sola is Stavanger Airport, Sola and an aviation museum. Near Sola, at Jåttå in Stavanger is NATO&#x27;s Joint Warfare Center.

==Operations==
The air station is the headquarters of the Rescue Helicopter Service with 330 Squadron who operates AgustaWestland AW101 &quot;SAR Queen&quot; search and rescue helicopters. The 12 helicopters are also detached to Rygge Air Station, Ørland Main Air Station, Bodø Main Air Station and Banak Air Station, with one helicopter on stand-by at any given time.

Other represented units from the Norwegian Armed Forces include the Home Guard, Norwegian Defence Logistics Organization, and Norwegian Cyber Defence Force.

==History==

===Opening===
Sola Air Station was founded at May 29, 1937 by King Haakon VII, an air show with 42 aircraft marking the occasion. In 1939, it was decided to station military aircraft on the airfield (because of the tense situation unfolding in Europe at the time). August 5, 1939, the first Caproni Ca.310 bomber landed here.

===Operation Weserübung===
On April 9, 1940, in reaction to the German invasion of Norway, the bomber squadron was ordered to the east, but before they could take off, six German aircraft attacked. The bombers were damaged, only a few getting airborne to later be abandoned elsewhere and the airport was seized. Here, the first opposed landing by paratroopers took place as 132 German fallschirmjägers from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, 7th Flieger Division were dropped on the airfield. Around 3 fallschirmjägers became casualties as the air station&#x27;s sole completed machine gun bunker fired on the attackers until being knocked out by a hand grenade, seriously wounding the gunner.

During the German occupation, the Luftwaffe used the facility&#x27;s seaplane base for operations in support of Kriegsmarine ships based on the Norwegian coast. Embarked Air Squadron 1/196 made three partial deployments to the facility in 1940 and 1941 before the entire squadron was based there through April and May 1944, after which part of the squadron would remain until into July 1944.

&quot;8. Staffel&quot; III./&quot;Kampfgeschwader 76&quot; equipped with Arado Ar 234s operated from the base during the final weeks of the war before surrendering to British forces.

===Liberation and post-war===
The next paratrooper landing at Sola took place May 9, 1945. This time, it was British and Norwegian troops that recaptured the airfield. 

330 Squadron was the first Norwegian squadron to land after the war. The squadron had been founded in Britain during the war and Sola was the first airfield to host Norwegian war-planes after the war. Squadron 330 was later disbanded, but the airfield remained as the biggest military airfield in the country up to the 1960s.

In early 1946, 333 Squadron came here, but it was moved to Tromsø during the Korean War. In 1953 it came back, but left for Andøya in 1963. 331 Squadron came in 1952. It was later disbanded and reformed until it moved to Bodø in 1955. 718 Squadron was formed here in 1952 and during the 1970s operated the Northrop F-5 fighter. The squadron remained until it was disbanded in 1982.

Sola Air Station has been considered to be closed, but will continue as a base for maritime helicopter operations.

===NATO Use===
The United States Air Force 426th Air Base Squadron provides support to 220 U.S. service members and their families working in support of NATO&#x27;s Joint Warfare Center. The squadron also supports “Operating Location-A” in Oslo, Norway, shipping for $50 million war readiness material and $900 million U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy equipment.

<text>The Magic of Scheherazade is an action-adventure/role-playing video game (RPG) developed and released by Culture Brain for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The game was released in 1987 in Japan and 1990 in North America. The plot is based on Middle Eastern folktales found in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. It involves an amnesic hero traveling through time in an attempt to rescue the princess Scheherazade from the evil wizard Sabaron, who has summoned a horde of demons to bring chaos to the once peaceful land of Arabia. &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; is divided into chapters and incorporates elements of both action-adventure and RPG gameplay styles. In each chapter, the player character can freely explore an overworld in a top-down perspective. The player engages hostile enemies with various weapons and spells through both real-time solo action on the overhead map and random, turn-based battles fought alongside befriended allies.

Once the commercial viability of the NES was proven in North America by the late 1980s, Japanese developer Culture Brain opened a company branch in the United States and chose to publish an English-language version of &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; after making several changes to the graphics and musical score. It has received mostly average review scores but generally positive commentary from critics for its visuals, gameplay, and difficulty balance. The game has been noted for its fusion of the adventure and RPG genres, though journalists have referred to its gameplay mechanics as lower-quality versions of what was seen in both &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; combines gameplay elements from action-adventure games and RPGs. In the game, the player must travel through a series of worlds and defeat the evil wizard Sabaron, rescue Scheherazade, and bring peace back to Arabia. The game consists of five chapters; the first four chapters involve the player&#x27;s journey through four worlds in which they must find the palace and defeat the demon that resides there. The fifth chapter involves the final battle with Sabaron. Players may start a new game or resume the game with a password. If a new game is started, the player must choose between three classes – Fighter, Magician, or Saint. Each class differs in weapon usage and certain abilities. For instance, a Fighter can use strong swords but is limited with the rod, a Magician is adept at using powerful rods but is restricted to a weak dagger instead of swords, and a Saint can exclusively utilize items like boots that prevent damage on hazardous floors. Weapons, spells, items, and actions like speaking or jumping can be mapped to the gamepad&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; buttons on a select subscreen. A status bar displays the player character&#x27;s selected actions, character class, attributes, coins, and some expendable supplies.

The majority of play takes place on an overhead map where the player can freely move between separate screens; the overworld comprises numerous landscapes and locales including forests, deserts, towns, underwater areas, dimly-lit dungeons, and palace labyrinths. The player will also find &quot;Time Gates&quot; that allow for time travel between the past, present, and future; they transport the player to the same location but in a different time and environment. In the towns, the player can interact with NPCs to gather information and initiate quests, gather new party members, purchase supplies as shops, replenish party members&#x27; hit points (HP) and magic points (MP) at hotels, gamble money at casinos, and change character class or save their progress via passwords at mosques.

In the overworld, enemies will often randomly appear and are fought in real time. The player can use a sword for close-range attacks, a rod for shooting long-range projectiles, and magic spells. Slaying enemies earns the player experience points that go towards increasing overall experience levels. Reaching higher levels improves the player&#x27;s maximum attributes (HP and MP) and can sometimes enhance weapon strength or yield new magic spells. When transitioning between screens on the overhead map, the player will sometimes encounter random, turn-based battles with groups of enemies. The start of each battle gives the player the option to fight, escape, or attempt to bribe enemies into leaving. Fighting alone or with up to two allies, the player takes turns trading blows with enemy units by picking commands such as striking with equipped weapons or casting magic. Formations (learned for a fee at &quot;Magic Universities&quot; in certain towns) can also be created, which can grant the party added defense or enable them to cast powerful group magic spells; certain formations work particularly well against certain &quot;squads&quot; or &quot;regiments&quot;. Finally, mercenary troopers, which can be hired in towns, can be used to aid the party in attacks.

==Plot==
The fantasy setting of &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; borrows from Middle Eastern folk tales in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. Many years prior to the opening of the game, the land of Arabia was taken over by the malevolent demon Goragora and his army of minions. A magician named Isfa, harnessing the power of the blue star Airosche, vanquished the demons and sealed them underground. Peace briefly returned until the evil wizard Sabaron freed Goragora and the demons from their captivity and imprisoned the Arabian princess Scheherazade and her family.

The player character takes on the role of Isfa&#x27;s unnamed descendant, who unsuccessfully attempts to save his lover Scheherazade from Sabaron. As a result, the player&#x27;s memories are erased, his magical powers are sealed, and he is thrust into a different time period. He is quickly greeted by the catlike spirit Coronya, who possesses the ability to open a passage to travel through time. With this, the amnesic hero traverses through five worlds in order to regain his memories, learn new magic, recruit several allies, and defeat the demon overlords. Once Scheherazade&#x27;s three sisters and father are rescued, the protagonist confronts Sabaron, who realizes releasing Goragora was a mistake. The hero then goes to the Dark World and destroys Goragora, returning tranquility to Arabia once again. After being thanked by Scheherazade and her family, the hero promises to return to his beloved someday as he and his party depart on a magic carpet toward their next adventure.

==Development and release==
&quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System (Famicom in Japan) by Culture Brain. A person working under the pseudonym &quot;Akademiya Yumenosuke&quot; was the game&#x27;s producer, according to a &quot;Weekly Famitsu&quot; interview. Composers Akinori Sawa and Shunichi Mikame worked as its composers. Sawa worked primarily on Culture Brain&#x27;s &quot;Hiryū no Ken&quot; series. Mikame had previously composed the scores for both &quot;Kung Fu Heroes&quot; and &quot;Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll&quot;. His musical equipment consisted of two polyphonic synthesizers, a frequency modulation synthesizer, and a hardware sequencer. Compositions were recorded to audio cassette and then simplified to the Famicom&#x27;s programmable sound generator, once approved by the producer. Only three of the six songs Mikame composed were used in game, and he left the company before its Japanese release.

&quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; was released in Japan on September 3, 1987. Tokuma Shoten published an official strategy guide for &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; in Japan in November. A short manga based on the game titled &quot;Magical Book&quot; was published in Japan and features all the game&#x27;s party members. Culture Brain&#x27;s North American division chose to release the game as it fit the company&#x27;s business model for international releases. Culture Brain USA announced the game in mid-1988 with a tentative release set for January 1989. It was delayed but was showcased that month at the Winter Consumer Electronics Show (CES) with other Culture Brain USA games for the NES, including &quot;Kung Fu Heroes&quot; and &quot;Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll&quot;; it was showcased once again at 1990&#x27;s Winter CES, this time alongside &quot;Baseball Simulator 1.000&quot;. The game was released in North America on January 15, 1990. Culture Brain made numerous changes for the English-language localization, including the alternation of character and monster sprites, changes of the facial features in the characters to look more nondescript, simplification of the overworld map, the usage of character text during gameplay, and the inclusion of new music. The game&#x27;s official soundtrack was released in Japan by Cassetron on October 25, 2023 and includes music from the overseas version.

==Reception==

&quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; received mixed reviews at release. Opinions of the game&#x27;s graphics and musical score have been mostly positive. Both William R. Trotter of &quot;Game Players&quot; and Rusel DeMaria of &quot;VideoGames &amp; Computer Entertainment&quot; commended the game&#x27;s visuals but DeMaria simply characterized the music and sound as &quot;fine&quot;. Trotter was specifically impressed with the magic spell effects, characters sprites, and environments. &quot;Game Players&quot; awarded the game &quot;Best Graphics&quot; for console titles first previewed in the US in 1989. Contrarily, reviewers from a 1990 &quot;EGM&quot; panel discounted the game&#x27;s presentation as either average or not up to the standards of the game&#x27;s contemporaries.

The gameplay and challenge were also high points for many reviewers. Trotter applauded the amount of content and compared the time-consuming yet intuitive learning curve for the game&#x27;s mechanics to the &quot;Ultima&quot; series. He said: &quot;Everything is clearly organized, so what at first seems unwieldy soon becomes natural and logical&quot;. DeMaria found the game easy yet satisfying, summarizing that it might offer fun for new and intermediate players while experience players could still find &quot;enough plot twists and interesting challenges to make the game fun to play&quot;. &quot;GamePro&quot; likewise recommended the game to beginner, intermediate, and advanced players alike. &quot;EGM&quot; found the game as an overall mediocre diversion to other RPGs of its time, but similarly acknowledged the gameplay as being &quot;nicely handled&quot; and &quot;easy to catch on to&quot;. One of the magazine&#x27;s writers, Ed Semrad, appreciated its challenge level and referred to it as the next &quot;decent quest game&quot; following &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;.

Critics have addressed the game&#x27;s similarities to other action-adventure titles and turn-based RPGs, as well as its blending of the two genres. Several compared the game&#x27;s top-down adventure aesthetic and interface to &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;. DeMaria recognized the two games&#x27; resemblance, but noted &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; as being much more linear. &quot;Hardcore Gaming 101&quot;″s Michael Ayala contrasted the time travel aspect with &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; and its turn-based battles with those of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. He admitted that both features felt unpolished in &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; but proclaimed the soundtrack as &quot;excellent&quot; aside from one &quot;incredibly grating&quot; theme heard in rare instances in battle. &quot;Destructoid&quot; contributor Colette Bennett praised the music and found the Middle East-inspired setting unique amid medieval-themed RPGs of its release period. Andrew Vestal of &quot;GameSpot&quot; comically described the game as a result of two development groups feuding over whether to create an action RPG or a turn-based RPG. He credited the game as being one of the first RPGs to introduce team attacks, in which two party members could join forces to perform extra-powerful magic. Video game journalist and &quot;Retronauts&quot; writer Jeremy Parish vaguely described the game in 2017 as &quot;innovative and memorable&quot;, even declaring it to be Culture Brain&#x27;s &quot;crown jewel&quot; when mentioning its conspicuous absence from Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service.

==Legacy==
A sequel to &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot; was first listed by Nintendo for a future 1990 release for the NES in that year&#x27;s official buyers guide for World of Nintendo retail boutiques. The sequel was further noted by &quot;GamePro&quot; in the magazine&#x27;s September 1990 issue for its coverage of the Summer CES. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also mentioned it in its November/December 1990 issue. At the Winter CES in January 1992, &quot;GamePro&quot; reported that an SNES game titled &quot;Golden Empire&quot; was officially announced by Culture Brain as a follow-up to &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot;. One year later, &quot;GamePro&quot; published a similar tidbit from an article about the 1993 Winter CES, where the game was then titled &quot;Golden Empire: The Legend of Scheherazade&quot;. Gaming retail chain Chips &amp; Bits continuously advertised &quot;Golden Empire&quot; under its SNES role-playing section in US magazine catalogs throughout the early to mid-1990s. As late as 1996, the Japanese publication &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot; listed the game as &quot;Scheherazade Densetsu - The Prelude&quot; with an unknown release date for the Super Famicom.

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;Super Ninja Boy&quot; includes a town called Celestern, named after one of the worlds in &quot;The Magic of Scheherazade&quot;, and contains its musical theme from that game and cameos from characters like Princess Scheherazade and Coronya.

<text>Sidneyia is an extinct marine arthropod known from fossils found from the Early to the Mid Cambrian of China and the Mid Cambrian Burgess Shale of British Columbia, Canada.

== Description ==
&quot;Sidneyia inexpectans&quot; reached lengths of at least . The largest known specimen of &quot;S. minor&quot; is around long and wide, while the largest specimen of &quot;S. malongensis&quot; is long and wide. The head shield is short, with notches present on the sides to accommodate stalked eyes, with the underside having a hypostome. The head has a pair of segmented antennae, as well as three pairs of post-antenal appendages. This was followed by a thorax, which had eight to ten segments/tergites, each associated with a pair of biramous (two branched) appendages, this was followed with one to three abdomen segments/tergites, with the body terminating with a telson, which comprised a pair of tail flukes. The appendages bear heavily sclerotised spined basal segments (basipods) called gnathobases, used to process food. In &quot;S. minor&quot;, the biramous appendages have 8 podomeres/segments on the endopod (the inner leg like branch), with the last segment being a terminal claw. The exopod (the outer branch) of these limbs is flattened and bears lamellae. In &quot;S. inexpectans&quot;, the endopods of the biramous limbs have seven podomeres, with the first four of these each bearing a number of thin inward projecting spines, while the outer three podomeres bore more stout claw-like spines, with the fourth to ninth pairs of post antennal limbs bearing exopods with blade-like lamellae, which are thought to have been used as gills. &quot;S. inexpectans&quot; had three pairs of digestive glands within the head shield and front of the thorax, adjacent to the central gut tube.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Sidneyia&quot; is thought to have been seafloor dwelling (epibenthic) generalist durophagous predator and/or scavenger that used its gnathobases (which closely resemble those of horseshoe crabs) to crush and shred prey items, including hard-shelled organisms like juvenile trilobites (which are abundantly preserved as stomach contents in &quot;S. inexpectans&quot;) and brachiopods (representing around 6% of the stomach contents of &quot;S. inexpectans&quot;), but possibly also softer animals like worms or soft bodied arthropods like bradoriids.

== Taxonomy ==

&quot;Sidneyia&quot; was discovered in 1910 during the first day of Charles Walcott&#x27;s exploration of the Burgess Shale. He named it after his elder son, Sidney, who had helped to locate the site and collect the specimen. The species name, &quot;Sidneyia inexpectans&quot;, is derived from the meaning of &quot;Sidney&#x27;s surprise&quot;.

144 specimens of &quot;Sidneyia&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 0.27% of the community.

&quot;Sidneyia sinica&quot; was named in 2002 from a specimen found in the Chengjiang Biota of South China. However, it has since been rejected from the genus, and other indeterminate specimens assigned to the genus from the Spence Shale and Sirius Passet lack key diagnostic characters. Specimens that can confidently assigned to the genus include &quot;Sidneyia&quot; cf. &quot;inexpectans&quot;, known from the Wuliuan Mantou Formation of North China, &quot;Sidneyia minor&quot; from the Early Cambrian (Cambrian Stage 3) Xiaoshiba Biota of Yunnan, China, and a valid species of &quot;Sidneyia&quot; from Chengjiang, &quot;Sidneyia malongensis&quot;.

In 1923, &quot;Sidneyia&quot;, was placed, along with &quot;Emeraldella&quot;, as part of the group &quot;Xenopoda&quot;. Today, both &quot;Sidneyia&quot; and &quot;Emeraldella&quot; are placed as part of the clade Vicissicaudata within Artiopoda, which includes trilobites and other arthropods with similar bodyforms. However, &quot;Sidneyia&quot; and &quot;Emeraldella&quot; are usually not recovered as each others closest relatives within Vicissicaudata, rendering &quot;Xenopoda&quot; invalid.

<text>NTRAK (all upper case letters) is one of several model railroad module standards. It is the most popular standard for use in United States N scale. NTRAK allows modelers to participate in a large layout but only invest a small amount of space at their own home. They can interchange (connect and operate) their module with any club or group that follows NTRAK standards.

==History==
The first prototype NTRAK modules were designed and built by Ben Davis, then they were first displayed in 1973 at the Model Railroad Industry Association show in Costa Mesa, California. Following their success at this show, the modules made their debut at the 1974 National Model Railroad Association&#x27;s national convention in San Diego, California. Ben was a founding member of the Belmont Shores Model Railroad Club; the club, which has helped launch the model manufacturing careers of many of its members, is now considered by many as the organization where NTRAK started.

==Module standards==
NTRAK modules are marked by their standard three running tracks (two are &quot;mainline&quot; tracks and the third is the &quot;branchline&quot; track) that are required on all modules. These three tracks are set on centers near the viewing side of the modules. The tracks are labeled from the viewing aisle by color, starting with Red for the outermost (closest to the viewing aisle) track, Yellow for the center track and Blue for the innermost track. The three tracks are electrically isolated from each other and from any other (optional) tracks on the module.

Basic modules are built with a surface area of . The official standard allows up to an extra of surface area on either the aisle side, operator&#x27;s side, or both (which can lead to a module that is wide). Module lengths are typically extended in increments, typically, up to long, but can be almost any length, limited only by the modeler&#x27;s abilities to build and transport the modules. Modules built to non-standard lengths must also be built with consideration of the standard lengths; where appropriate, the modeler must also build a short bridge module so that their specific module set uses up a section of layout that is evenly divisible by -long modules.

Modules were originally connected electrically with 18 gauge wire utilizing two-conductor Cinch Jones 302 series connectors. The Anderson Powerpole PP30 connector and 12 gauge wire was adopted as a recommend practice in 2005. and as a standard for newly constructed modules in 2011. The use of the older Cinch-Jones connector has been deprecated, but is still permitted on legacy modules.

In addition, new standards have been written to comply with the new National Fire Code. These include the prohibition of module-mounted power strips. These new standards are available for review at the NTRAK website, 

==Alternatives==
In recent years other, often complementary, module standards have cropped up to address perceived deficiencies with NTrak&#x27;s standard.

=== oNeTrak ===
One example of these perceived deficiencies is the requirement for NTrak modules to have three mainline tracks. On the prototype, except in a few areas where traffic density dictates the need for three (or more) mainline tracks, most mainlines throughout North America are single or double track.

oNeTrak is designed around the concept of a single track mainline and as such allows for a greater range of railroad scenes to be modeled compared to Ntrak. oNeTrak also allows for more prototypical operations as trains on a single track main often have to meet and/or pass each other during operation of the layout.

=== T-TRAK ===

T-TRAK is a standard that started in Japan and was published in the NTRAK Newsletter in 2001 and is now the most popular N-Scale module standard in North America.

=== BeNdTrack ===

Bend Track is designed around a double track mainline which traverses each module twice, once on each side, with flexible module shape and no &quot;pit&quot; area.

<doc id="1047196" wikidata="Q2962094" url="?curid=1047196" title="Fantasy Zone">
<text>is a 1986 arcade video game by Sega, and the first game in the &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; series. It was later ported to a wide variety of consoles, including the Master System. The player controls a sentient spaceship named Opa-Opa who fights an enemy invasion in the titular group of planets. The game contains a number of features atypical of the traditional scrolling shooter. The main character, Opa-Opa, is sometimes referred to as Sega&#x27;s first mascot character.

The game design and main character have many similarities to the earlier &quot;TwinBee&quot;, and both are credited with establishing the cute &#x27;em up subgenre. It also popularized the concept of a boss rush, a stage where the player faces multiple previous bosses again in succession. Numerous sequels were made over the years.

==Gameplay==
In the game, the player&#x27;s ship is placed in a level with a number of bases to destroy. When all the bases are gone, the stage boss appears, who must be defeated in order to move on to the next stage. There are eight stages, and in all of them, except the final one, the scrolling camera is not fixed; the player can move either left or right, although the stage loops. The final level consists of a rematch against all of the previous bosses in succession before facing the final boss.

Opa-Opa uses two different attacks: the standard weapon (initially bullets) and bombs. He can also move down to land on the ground by sprouting feet and walking around until he flies again.

It is possible to upgrade Opa-Opa&#x27;s weapons, get bombs and flying engine to increase speed, and get extra lives. To do these, the player must get money by defeating enemies, bases or bosses, and access a shop by touching a marked balloon. Prices rise with each purchase. When the player chooses to exit or the time runs up, another screen appears to equip these upgrades; only one engine, weapon and bomb can be equipped at a time.

Some of the purchasable weapons have a time limit that starts as soon as the shop is left. Some of the bombs can be used at any moment, but are limited in quantity.Engine upgrades are permanent. The powerups can also be reassigned by reentering the shop or touch a balloon with the word &quot;Select&quot; written on it. If the player loses a life, all of the upgrades are lost.

==Versions==
&quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; was ported to the Master System, MSX, Nintendo Entertainment System, X68000, and PC Engineall with similar gameplay. For example, the Master System version lacks some features such as the radar that indicates the location of the bases or a gauge that indicates energy level, and two of the bosses were replaced by alternate bosses.

Two different versions were released for the Famicom and NES. The Japanese version was released in 1987, developed and published by Sunsoft. The American version was released in 1989, developed by Pixel and published unlicensed by Tengen. In 1997, &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; was released in the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; series in Japan for the Sega Saturn.

&quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; was re-released as an enhanced remake for the PlayStation 2, again in the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; series. Although similar in appearance to the arcade version (even incorporating the original arcade sounds), this version uses polygons instead of sprites and adds some stages, including bonus levels with the viewpoint behind Opa-Opa as he tries to collect coins from any boss that was defeated at the moment; this game mode is very similar to &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, or the unreleased &quot;Space Fantasy Zone&quot;. This version was released in North America and Europe as part of the &quot;Sega Classics Collection&quot;.

Due to hardware limitations, this version was divided in three different parts. The Master System version was re-released in Japan for the Virtual Console on March 11, 2008, for Europe and Australia on April 11, and in North America on April 14.

On September 18, the final &quot;Sega Ages&quot; disc was devoted to the series, &quot;Fantasy Zone Complete Collection&quot;. Instead of a 3D remake, it compiles all of the games in the series, including spin-offs, all of Sega&#x27;s own versions, and a remake of &quot;Fantasy Zone II&quot; for System 16 hardware.

The original arcade version is unlockable in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot;. A 3D port of the game was released on March 19, 2014 for the Nintendo 3DS titled &quot;3D Fantasy Zone: Opa-Opa Bros.&quot; New features of the 3DS port involve stereoscopic 3D visuals, adjustable difficulty settings, the ability to save the game, the ability to switch to the Japanese versions and US versions of the game, a Stage Select feature, and a new mode which involves the player playing as Upa-Upa, Opa-Opa&#x27;s brother. The two replacement bosses from the Master System release can be unveiled, each replacing the standard boss.

The arcade version is a minigame in several entries in the &quot;Yakuza&quot; series, beginning with &quot;Yakuza 0&quot;. It is identical to the original arcade release, except the addition of a rapid fire button.

A Sega Genesis port of the game was developed for the Sega Genesis Mini 2, the successor to the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole, which was released on October 27, 2022. The port added a Super Easy mode.

==Reception==
&quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; was very successful in Japanese arcades, helping to give rise to the popular System 16 arcade board. In April 1986, it was the second top-grossing table arcade cabinet of the month in Japan. It was the top-grossing arcade game in Japan from July–August 1986.

The Sega Master System version was reviewed in 1988 in &quot;Dragon&quot;, given 4 out of 5 stars. In 1988, it got four categories of 9/10 each from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, calling it &quot;a beaut of a game [where] I-want-to-eat-this-cartridge scrolling backdrop and aliens float in from all sides spitting death at you&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; rated the PC Engine version 88% and the Master System version 87%, considering the PC Engine version to be better than the Master System version but not as commercially successful. &quot;Console XS&quot; reviewed the Master System version in 1992, giving it a 91% score.

It was reviewed by &quot;Génération 4&quot;, &quot;Sega Power&quot;, &quot;Happy Computer&quot;, and &quot;Tilt&quot; in 1987 and 1990.

<doc id="1047197" wikidata="Q5075676" url="?curid=1047197" title="Charles Boot">
<text>Charles Boot JP (1 October 1874 – 14 June 1945) was an English businessman and film producer who was the driving force behind the growth of Henry Boot &amp; Sons in the inter-war period. As well as creating one of the largest contracting and housebuilding firms of its time, he was a staunch advocate of the need for better housing and the virtues of private rather than local authority housing. He was also the creator of Pinewood Studios.
==Personal life==
Charles Boot was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, and the second of 13 children and eldest son of Henry Boot (1851–1931) and his wife, Hannah White. Henry and Hannah&#x27;s first home was in Napier Street, Sheffield next to the Plymouth Brethren meeting rooms. Henry became a member of the Brethren, eventually forming his own meeting place; Charles would have had a religious upbringing but there is no evidence that he shared his father&#x27;s enthusiasm.

Boot was 12 when his father began to work on his own account as a jobbing builder, and Boot joined him after leaving school staying with the firm until his death in 1945. The censuses mark his progress: a joiner’s apprentice in 1891; a foreman joiner in 1901; and a building contractor in 1911. It was in that decade that Boot appeared to take complete control of the business and in the 1919 flotation he was the managing director.

Boot married Bertha Matthews (1870–1926) in 1897, they had two children, Henry and Gertrude and lived at Sugworth Hall on the western outskirts of Sheffield. Bertha died in late 1926 and in early 1927 Charles remarried in London – to Kate Hebb, and in 1929 bought Thornbridge Hall in Derbyshire. Charles Boot died in 1945 in a Sheffield nursing home, following an operation. He had been a Justice of the Peace, Member of the Council of the House Builders&#x27; Association, President of the Federation of Master Builders (1944), and a Grand Commander in the Order of the Redeemer, Greece&#x27;s highest honour.
== Business career==
Boot&#x27;s business career is detailed under Henry Boot PLC. Under its then name of Henry Boot &amp; Sons, the firm built more houses than any other company in the inter-war period, was an international contractor, and developed Pinewood Studios. Outside the firm, he became a forceful spokesman for the housebuilding industry, supporting measures to reduce the cost of local authority housing and he was a keen advocate of building for private sale rather than for local authorities.

Boot made representations to the House of Commons on the costs of building houses. In July 1926 (a time when almost all housebuilding was for local authorities) he gave an extensive address to the Health and Housing Committee – already speaking for a firm that had &quot;built more houses than any other firm or individual in the world&quot;. He was a strong proponent of labour being paid by results and criticised local authorities whose contracts prohibited this. He was also critical of local authorities that overspecified and interfered with work. He contrasted Birmingham, where he could build good houses for £397 and make a profit while virtually the same house in another authority would cost £465 and he would make a loss.

Boot&#x27;s concern for the building industry&#x27;s ability to supply low cost housing for rent was addressed more than once in the closing stages of his life. He pointed to the 8,000 low-rent houses built by the Boot subsidiary, First National Housing Trust, in the six years following the Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1933 and he argued for the superior economics of the private trust as compared with bureaucratic local authorities. One of his most interesting contributions was his scheme for abolishing slum areas, written in 1935. Boot proposed two new satellite towns comprising around 50,000 houses and re-housing around 250,000 people; one was to be near Waltham Abbey and the other near Dagenham. The transport proposed for the new towns was the &quot;Railplane&quot; the technical description sounding like the ill-fated Bennie Railplane. Sadly, neither the new towns nor the Railplane came to pass.

=== Pinewood Film Studios ===
In 1934, Charles Boot embarked upon the design and construction of what would become Pinewood Film Studios located among the pine trees of the 100 acres (0.4 km²) estate of Heatherden Hall at Iver Heath in Buckinghamshire, England. Charles Boot based his designs upon what were at the time the latest ideas being employed by other film studios in the production of movies at Hollywood. Charles Boot managed to complete the work in twelve months. In the years that followed the Henry Boot company also undertook further work on both the Pinewood Film Studios and the Denham Film Studios, both of which had by then become a part of the J. Arthur Rank Organisation.

== Boot&#x27;s Folly ==
Charles Boot built Boot&#x27;s Folly in 1927, an imposing folly clearly visible between Strines and Bradfield in South Yorkshire, England, apparently to create work for people during the depression. For more information, see the Follies and Monuments website and a satellite visual.

<text>Henry Boot (1851–1931) was an English businessman who was the founder of Henry Boot plc.

==Personal life==
Henry Boot was the eldest surviving son of Charles and Ann Boot. He was born on 9 December 1851 in Heeley, a small village two miles (3.2 km) outside Sheffield, England. Henry&#x27;s father had described himself as a stonemason in the 1851 census but as a farmer when the children were baptized. In the 1871 census, 19-year-old Henry is living with his parents and is shown as a joiner&#x27;s apprentice. The next year, he married Hannah White (1855–1941) and moved to Napier Street, Sheffield, sandwiched between the Anglican Church and the Plymouth Brethren meeting hall. Having first worshiped at the Church, he moved to the Brethren and later formed his own Brethren meeting. Henry and Hannah had 13 children over 20 years, ten of whom survived to adulthood.

==Career==
Henry worked as an employee in the building industry for around 20 years before establishing his own joinery shop in 1886. The censuses record his increased status: in 1891, a joiner; in 1901, a builder and joiner; and in 1911, a joiner, builder, and contractor. His accommodation kept pace as well, with successive moves to larger houses: by 1911, he was living in an eleven-room house in Sheffield. His firm, Henry Boot plc, became an increasingly important contractor, but the driving force was Henry&#x27;s eldest son, Charles Boot. By the start of World War I, Henry had retired from the company. He died on 2 November 1931 at his home on Victoria Road in Broomhall, aged 80. His grave is in Crookes Cemetery in Sheffield.

<doc id="1047205" wikidata="Q1338509" url="?curid=1047205" title="Saudade">
<text>Saudade (; plural saudades) is a word in Portuguese and Galician denoting an emotional state of melancholic or profoundly nostalgic longing for a beloved yet absent someone or something. It derives from the Latin word for solitude. It is often associated with a repressed understanding that one might never encounter the object of longing ever again. It is a recollection of feelings, experiences, places, or events, often elusive, that cause a sense of separation from the exciting, pleasant, or joyous sensations they once caused. Duarte Nunes Leão defines &quot;saudade&quot; as, &quot;Memory of something with a desire for it&quot;.
In Brazil, the day of &quot;saudade&quot; is officially celebrated on 30 January. It is not a widely acknowledged day in Portugal.

==History==

&quot;Saudade&quot; ultimately derives from the Latin &quot;solitās, solitātem&quot;, meaning &quot;solitude&quot;. The word &quot;saudade&quot; was used in the Cancioneiro da Ajuda (13th century), in the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and by poets of the time of King Denis of Portugal (reigned 1279–1325).
Some specialists argue that the word may have originated during the Great Portuguese Discoveries, expressing and giving meaning to the sadness felt about those who departed on journeys to unknown seas and often disappeared in shipwrecks, died in battle, or simply never returned. Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, Portuguese discoveries started in 1415 and the word has been found in earlier texts. The Reconquista may also offer a plausible genesis.

The state of mind has subsequently become a &quot;Portuguese way of life&quot;: a constant feeling of absence, the sadness of something that&#x27;s missing, wistful longing for completeness or wholeness and the yearning for the return of what is now gone, a desire for presence as opposed to absence—as it is said in Portuguese, a strong desire to &quot;matar as saudades&quot; (lit. &quot;to kill the saudades&quot;).

In the latter half of the 20th century, &quot;saudade&quot; became associated with the longing for one&#x27;s homeland, as hundreds of thousands of Portuguese-speaking people left in search of better futures in South America, North America, and Western Europe. Besides the implications derived from a wave of emigration trend from the motherland, historically speaking &quot;saudade&quot; is the term associated with the decline of Portugal&#x27;s role in world politics and trade. During the so-called &quot;Golden Age&quot;, synonymous with the era of discovery, Portugal rose to the status of a world power, and its monarchy became the richest in Europe and one of the richest global empires in history. But with the competition from other European nations, the country went both colonially and economically into a prolonged period of decay. This period of decline and resignation from the world&#x27;s cultural coincides with the cultural rising of &quot;saudade&quot; in Portuguese society.

==Definition==
The &quot;Dicionário Houaiss da Língua Portuguesa&quot; defines &quot;saudade&quot; (or &quot;saudades&quot;) as &quot;A somewhat melancholic feeling of incompleteness. It is related to thinking back on situations of privation due to the absence of someone or something, to move away from a place or thing, or to the absence of a set of particular and desirable experiences and pleasures once lived.&quot;

The Dictionary from the Royal Galician Academy, on the other hand, defines &quot;saudade&quot; as an &quot;intimate feeling and mood caused by the longing for something absent that is being missed. This can take different aspects, from concrete realities (a loved one, a friend, the motherland, the homeland...) to the mysterious and transcendent. It is quite prevalent and characteristic of the Galician-Portuguese world, but it can also be found in other cultures.&quot;

===Related words===
Saudade is a word in Portuguese and Galician that claims no direct translation in English. However, a close translation in English would be &quot;desiderium.&quot; Desiderium is defined as an ardent desire or longing, especially a feeling of loss or grief for something lost. Desiderium comes from the word desiderare, meaning to long for. Connections between desiderium and nostalgia have also been drawn; the former can be seen as expressing the latter for things that can’t be experienced any more, or things that someone may have never experienced themselves.

In Portuguese, &quot;&quot;Tenho saudades tuas&quot; or &quot;Estou com saudades de ti/você&quot;&quot; translates as &quot;I have (feel) &quot;saudade&quot; of you&quot; meaning &quot;I miss you&quot;, but carries a much stronger tone. In fact, one can have &quot;saudade&quot; of someone whom one is with, but have some feeling of loss towards the past or the future. For example, one can have &quot;saudade&quot; towards part of the relationship or emotions once experienced for/with someone, though the person in question is still part of one&#x27;s life, as in &quot;Tenho saudade do que fomos&quot; (I feel &quot;saudade&quot; of the way we were). Another example can illustrate this use of the word saudade: &quot;Que saudade!&quot; indicating a general feeling of longing, whereby the object of longing can be a general and undefined entity/occasion/person/group/period etc. This feeling of longing can be accompanied or better described by an abstract will to be where the object of longing is.

Despite being hard to translate in full, &quot;saudade&quot; has equivalent words in other cultures, and is often related to music styles expressing this feeling such as the &quot;blues&quot; for African-Americans, &quot;&quot; in Spain, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; in German, &quot;&quot; in Romania, &quot;Tizita&quot; in Ethiopia, &quot;Hiraeth&quot; in Welsh, or &quot;Assouf&quot; for the Tuareg people, appocundria in Neapolitan, or mall in Albanian. In Slovak, the word is &quot;clivota&quot; or &quot;cnenie&quot;, and in Czech, the word is &quot;stesk&quot;. In Turkish, the word &quot;Hasret&quot; meaning longing, yearning or nostalgia has similar connotations, as does the Polish “tęsknota”.

The similar melancholic music style is known in Bosnia-Herzegovina as &quot;sevdalinkah&quot; (from Turkish &quot;sevda&quot;&#x27;: infatuation, ultimately from Arabic سَوْدَاء sawdā&#x27;: &#x27;black [bile]&#x27;, translation of the Greek μέλαινα χολή, &quot;mélaina cholē&quot;, from which the term melancholy is derived).

==Elements==
&quot;Saudade&quot; is similar but not equal to nostalgia, a word that also exists in Portuguese.

In the book &quot;In Portugal&quot; of 1912, A. F. G. Bell writes: 

A stronger form of &quot;saudade&quot; may be felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as old ways and sayings; a lost lover who is sadly missed; a faraway place where one was raised; loved ones who have died; feelings and stimuli one used to have; and the faded, yet golden memories of youth. Although it relates to feelings of melancholy and fond memories of things/people/days gone by, it can be a rush of sadness coupled with a paradoxical joy derived from acceptance of fate and the hope of recovering or substituting what is lost by something that will either fill in the void or provide consolation.

To F. D. Santos, &quot;Saudade&quot; as a noun has become a longing for longing itself: 

==In the arts==
===Music===
As with all emotions, &quot;saudade&quot; has been an inspiration for many songs and compositions. &quot;Sodade&quot; (&quot;saudade&quot; in Cape Verdean Creole) is the title of the Cape Verde singer Cesária Évora&#x27;s most famous song. Étienne Daho, a French singer, also produced a song of the same name. &quot;The Good Son&quot;, a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave&#x27;s mental state at the time, which he has described as &quot;saudade&quot;. He told journalist Chris Bohn: &quot;When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that I thought were lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was &quot;saudade&quot;. It&#x27;s not nostalgia but something sadder.&quot;
The usage of &quot;saudade&quot; as a theme in Portuguese music goes back to the 16th century, the golden age of Portugal. &quot;Saudade&quot;, as well as love suffering, is a common theme in many villancicos and cantigas composed by Portuguese authors; for example: &quot;Lágrimas de Saudade&quot; (&quot;tears of saudade&quot;), which is an anonymous work from the &quot;Cancioneiro de Paris&quot;. Fado is a Portuguese music style, generally sung by a single person (the &quot;fadista&quot;) along with a Portuguese guitar. The most popular themes of fado are &quot;saudade&quot;, nostalgia, jealousy, and short stories of the typical city quarters. Fado and &quot;saudade&quot; are intertwined key ideas in Portuguese culture. The word fado comes from Latin &quot;fatum&quot; meaning &quot;fate&quot; or &quot;destiny&quot;. Fado is a musical cultural expression and recognition of this unassailable determinism which compels the resigned yearning of &quot;saudade&quot;, a bitter-sweet, existential yearning and hopefulness towards something over which one has no control.

Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, whose father is a Galician, speaks of &quot;saudade&quot; in his song &quot;Un Canto a Galicia&quot; (which roughly translates as &quot;a song/chant for Galicia&quot;). In the song, he passionately uses the phrase to describe a deep and sad longing for his motherland, Galicia. He also performs a song called &quot;Morriñas&quot;, which describes the Galicians as having a deeply strong &quot;saudade&quot;.

The Paraguayan guitarist Agustin Barrios wrote several pieces invoking the feeling of &quot;saudade&quot;, including &quot;Choro de Saudade&quot; and &quot;Preludio Saudade&quot;. The term is prominent in Brazilian popular music, including the first bossa nova song, &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; (&quot;No more &quot;saudade&quot;&quot;, usually translated as &quot;No More Blues&quot;), written by Tom Jobim.
Jazz pianist Bill Evans recorded the tune &quot;Saudade de Brasil&quot; numerous times. In 1919, on returning from two years in Brazil, the French composer Darius Milhaud composed a suite, &quot;Saudades do Brasil&quot;, which exemplified the concept of &quot;saudade&quot;. &quot;Saudade (Part II)&quot; is also the title of a flute solo by the band Shpongle. The fado singer Amália Rodrigues typified themes of &quot;saudade&quot; in some of her songs. J-Rock band Porno Graffitti has a song entitled &quot;サウダージ&quot;, &quot;Saudaaji&quot; transliterated (&quot;Saudade&quot;). The city pop guitarist Masayoshi Takanaka has an album titled Saudade. The alternative rock band Love And Rockets has a song named &quot;Saudade&quot; on their album &quot;Seventh Dream of Teenage Heaven&quot;. June 2012 brought Bearcat&#x27;s release of their self-titled indie album that included a song called &quot;Saudade&quot;.

The Dutch jazz/Rock guitarist Jan Akkerman recorded a composition called &quot;Saudade&quot;, the centerpiece of his 1996 album &quot;Focus in Time&quot;. The Belgian electronic music band Arsenal recorded a song called &quot;Saudade&quot; on their album &quot;Outsides&quot; (2005). The jazz fusion group Trio Beyond, consisting of John Scofield, Jack DeJohnette, and Larry Goldings released in 2006 an album dedicated to drummer Tony Williams (1945–1997), called &quot;Saudades&quot;. Dance music artist Peter Corvaia released a progressive house track entitled &quot;Saudade&quot; on HeadRush Music, a sub-label of Toes in the Sand Recordings. New York City post-rock band Mice Parade released an album entitled &quot;Obrigado Saudade&quot; in 2004. Chris Rea also recorded a song entitled &quot;Saudade Part 1 &amp; 2 (Tribute To Ayrton Senna)&quot; as a tribute to Ayrton Senna, the Brazilian three-times Formula One world champion killed on the track in May 1994. There is an ambient/noise/shoegazing band from Portland, Oregon, named Saudade. The rock band Extreme has a Portuguese guitarist Nuno Bettencourt; the influence of his heritage can be seen in the band&#x27;s album &quot;Saudades de Rock&quot;. During recording, the mission statement was to bring back musicality to the medium. &quot;Nancy Spain&quot;, a song by Barney Rush, made famous by an adaptation by Christy Moore, is another example of the use of &quot;saudade&quot; in contemporary Irish music, the chorus of which is:

&quot;No matter where I wander I&#x27;m still haunted by your name
The portrait of your beauty stays the same
Standing by the ocean wondering where you&#x27;ve gone
If you&#x27;ll return again
Where is the ring I gave to Nancy Spain?&quot; 
American singer/songwriter Grayson Hugh wrote a song called &quot;Saudade&quot; that he performed with jazz guitarist Norman Johnson on Johnson&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Get It While You Can&quot;.

Kingston-Upon-Hull IDM Electronica, Downtempo and Deep Groove legend, Steve Cobby, of Fila Brazillia, Solid Doctor, Heights of Abraham, the Twilight Singers debut notoriety and other musical incarnations and collaborations, released a 12 track album &quot;Saudade&quot; in March 2014 on DÉCLASSÉ Recordings.

Washington DC electronica duo Thievery Corporation released the studio album &quot;Saudade&quot; in 2014 via their Eighteenth Street Lounge Music label.

Brazilian singer Ana Frango Electrico released a song called &quot;Saudade&quot; as the opening track on their 2019 album &quot;Little Electric Chicken Heart&quot;. 

Composer Cody Matthew Johnson alongside former Sick Puppies frontman and singer-songwriter Shim were hired by Capcom to compose the end credits song “Saudade” for Resident Evil 2 Remake, later in the year the music was short-played at The Game Awards during the presentation of &quot;The Game Award for Game Of The Year&quot; by &quot;The Game Awards Orchestra&quot;.

A. R. Rahman&#x27;s soundtrack for the 2020 Hindi film Dil Bechara features an instrumental track called &quot;The Horizon of Saudade&quot;.

Icelandic music producer Ólafur Arnalds released the single &quot;Saudade (When We Are Born)&quot; in 2021.

In 2022, Portuguese singer Maro released a song called &quot;Saudade, saudade&quot; and represented Portugal with it in the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in Turin, Italy. The song placed 9th in the grand final.

===Literature===

The Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa&#x27;s posthumous collection of writings &quot;The Book of Disquiet&quot; is written almost entirely in a tone of saudade, and deals with themes of nostalgia and alienation. Australian author Suneeta Peres Da Costa&#x27;s novella &quot;Saudade&quot; follows Maria, a young girl from a Goan immigrant family, growing up in a political hierarchy of racism and colonialism

===Film and television===
In an episode of the Colombian telenovela &quot;Yo soy Betty, la fea&quot;, Brazilian actress Taís Araújo (guest-starring as herself) discussed the concept of saudade with the heartbroken titular character.

==Variations==

&quot;Saudade&quot; is also associated with Galicia, where it is used similarly to the word &quot;morriña&quot; (longingness). Yet, morriña often implies a deeper stage of &quot;saudade&quot;, a &quot;&quot;saudade&quot; so strong it can even kill,&quot; as the Galician saying goes. Morriña was a term often used by emigrant Galicians when talking about the Galician motherland they left behind. Although &quot;saudade&quot; is also a Galician word, the meaning of &quot;longing for something that might return&quot; is generally associated with &quot;morriña&quot;. A literary example showing the understanding of the difference and the use of both words is the song &quot;Un canto a Galicia&quot; by Julio Iglesias. The word used by Galicians speaking Spanish has spread and become common in all Spain and even accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy.

In Portugal, &quot;morrinha&quot; is a word to describe sprinkles, while &quot;morrinhar&quot; means &quot;to sprinkle.&quot; (The most common Portuguese equivalents are &quot;chuvisco&quot; and &quot;chuviscar&quot;, respectively.) &quot;Morrinha&quot; is also used in northern Portugal for referring to sick animals, for example of sheep dropsy, and occasionally to sick or sad people, often with irony. It is also used in some Brazilian regional dialects for the smell of wet or sick animals.

In Goa, India, which was a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese influences still remain. A suburb of Margão, Goa&#x27;s largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu &quot;shmashana&quot; (cremation ground) and the Muslim &quot;qabrastan&quot; (cemetery). Most people living in the city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, as they often think fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. 

In Cape Verdean Creole there is the word &quot;sodadi&quot; (also spelled &quot;sodade&quot;), originated in the Portuguese &quot;saudade&quot; and with the same meaning.

<text>Peter Paul Cetera Jr. ( ; born September 13, 1944) is a retired American musician best known for being a frontman, vocalist, and bassist for the American rock band Chicago from 1967 until his departure in 1985. His career as a recording artist encompasses 17 studio albums with Chicago and eight solo studio albums.

As a solo artist, Cetera has scored six Top 40 singles, including two that reached number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 chart in 1986, &quot;Glory of Love&quot; and &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;. &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, the theme song from the film &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; (1986), was co-written by Cetera, David Foster, and Diane Nini and was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for best original song from a motion picture. In 1987, Cetera received an ASCAP award for &quot;Glory of Love&quot; in the category &quot;Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures&quot;. His performance on &quot;Glory of Love&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for best pop male vocal. That same year Cetera and Amy Grant, who performed as a duet on &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;, were nominated for a Grammy Award for best vocal performance by a pop duo or group. Besides Foster and Grant, Cetera has collaborated throughout his career with other recording artists from various genres of music. His songs have been featured in soundtracks for movies and television.

With &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, a song written and sung by Cetera on the group&#x27;s tenth album, Chicago received its first Grammy Award. It was also the group&#x27;s first number one single. In 2014, Chicago&#x27;s first album, &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; (Columbia, 1969), featuring Cetera on bass and vocals, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Cetera was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Chicago in April 2016, and he, Robert Lamm, and James Pankow were among the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees for their songwriting efforts as members of the group. Cetera, along with other members of Chicago, received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020.

==Early life==
===Family===
Cetera was born to Peter Paul Cetera Sr. and Margareta (Bechtold) Cetera in the Morgan Park neighborhood, located on the far South Side of Chicago, Illinois. He was the second of six children and is of Polish and Hungarian descent. His father worked as a machinist. Cetera&#x27;s siblings include two brothers, Tim Cetera (who recorded an album with Ricky Nelson in the early 1970s) and Kenny Cetera. Both are listed as contributing musicians on some of the recordings Cetera made with Chicago and on some of his solo recordings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solitude/SolitaireCD&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal education===
Cetera attended Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary for one year of high school because, he says, &quot;my mother wanted me to be a priest.&quot; He transferred to Mendel Catholic Prep High School, graduated from there in 1962, and is listed among the &quot;Notable Alumni&quot;.

===Musical beginnings===
Cetera says that his mother &quot;was always singing around the house&quot; and taught the children to sing in harmony while they were doing their household chores. His brother Kenny also remembers the family harmonizing together while growing up. Based on the positive responses he got, Cetera realized around the age of 11 or 12 that he had a talent for singing. Cetera&#x27;s interest in music deepened when, at 11 years of age, his parents bought him an accordion instead of the guitar he wanted. He says he was &quot;kind of a polka prodigy&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sands 7/29/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and aged 12 won a local talent competition for his accordion-playing. However, his family missed his radio debut when the show was broadcast the following week, because they did not own an FM receiver.

During high school, he started seriously thinking of pursuing a career as a singer. When he was 15, some older students from his high school took him to a club to see a band called the Rebel Rockers, which led to his purchasing an acoustic guitar at Montgomery Ward. He eventually took up the electric bass, and with some high school friends—a drummer, guitarist, and saxophone player—Cetera began playing the local dance circuit, dividing lead vocals with the guitarist.

Cetera&#x27;s early musical influences include Bo Diddley, Ritchie Valens, Little Richard, Jimmy Reed, and the Ventures. After he embarked on his music career, the Beatles became a prominent influence in his early twenties.

==Professional music career==
===History===

==== The Exceptions ====
Cetera played in several groups in the Chicago area, including a popular local rock band named the Exceptions, which toured the Midwest in the mid-1960s. Cetera said, &quot;By the time I was 18 I was making more money than my dad.&quot;

Among Cetera&#x27;s first recording experiences were several singles and a five-song seven-inch EP titled &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Mass&quot; with the Exceptions. One of those recorded songs, &quot;Come On Home&quot;, also gave Cetera his first songwriting credit. (Kal David and Marty Grebb also are credited on the song.) Adding to his early recording experience, Cetera played electric bass on Chicago folk singer and songwriter Dick Campbell&#x27;s album &quot;Dick Campbell Plays Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, released in 1966 on Mercury Records. When the Exceptions decided to move toward a more psychedelic sound, Cetera left; the band changed its name to Aorta, and became one of the first psychedelic groups on a major label.

====Tenure in Chicago====
In December 1967, Cetera arrived early for a show to watch a band called the Big Thing. Impressed by their use of a horn section combined with rock and roll, Cetera left the Exceptions to join the Big Thing within two weeks. The Big Thing, which soon changed its name to the Chicago Transit Authority (and eventually shortened it to Chicago), released its self-titled debut album &quot;Chicago Transit Authority&quot; on Columbia Records in 1969. Cetera shared lead vocals on three of the eleven songs on the album: &quot;Questions 67 &amp; 68&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, and &quot;Someday&quot;, his tenor voice complementing the baritone voices of the two other lead singers in the group, keyboardist Robert Lamm and guitarist Terry Kath.

The follow-up album, &quot;Chicago&quot;, vaulted the band to popular status throughout the world. The song &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; was the first major hit single with Cetera singing lead vocals. &quot;Chicago&quot; is also notable for featuring Cetera&#x27;s first songwriting effort with the group, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here?&quot;

As the 1970s progressed, Cetera became a more prolific songwriter for the group, contributing the songs &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Happy Man&quot; to the 1974 album &quot;Chicago VII&quot;. &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; featured vocals by members of the Beach Boys, and reached number eleven on the charts. &quot;Happy Man&quot; was, according to Chicago producer James Guercio, &quot;a Number 1 record that was never released as a single.&quot; Cetera&#x27;s biggest singing and songwriting accomplishment with Chicago came in 1976 with the ballad &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, from &quot;Chicago X&quot;. It was the group&#x27;s first number one single in the United States, also reaching number one on charts worldwide and certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song won a Grammy Award for Chicago, the group&#x27;s only such award to date, for the 1976 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus, at the 19th Annual Grammy Awards, held on February 19, 1977. According to William James Ruhlmann, biographer of the group, &quot;the success of &#x27;If You Leave Me Now&#x27; overshadowed the album from which it came, and also consolidated what by now seemed a definitely stated preference on the part of radio, if not Chicago&#x27;s audience in general, for lush ballads sung by Peter Cetera over any other style the band might care to put forward.&quot; Another success in the same vein followed: Cetera&#x27;s 1977 composition &quot;Baby, What a Big Surprise&quot;, from &quot;Chicago XI&quot;. The song featured him on lead vocals and made it to number four on the record charts.

During this time Cetera also worked with other recording artists. He, along with a group of other well-known musicians, appeared on the 1976 self-titled debut album by singer-songwriter Angelo. In 1977 Cetera provided background vocals on &quot;Beached&quot;, an album by Ricci Martin (son of Dean Martin), produced by Ricci Martin&#x27;s brother-in-law, Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys. Cetera&#x27;s bandmates James Pankow, Walter Parazaider, and Lee Loughnane also performed on the album. He is credited as one of the background vocalists on Billy Joel&#x27;s single &quot;My Life&quot;, released in 1978, from the album &quot;52nd Street&quot;. The following year he collaborated with Karen Carpenter on her self-titled solo album, providing backing vocals for a song that he had written, &quot;Making Love in the Afternoon&quot;. That album was not released until 1996 by A&amp;M Records.

By the end of the 1970s, with the rise of disco music, Chicago&#x27;s popularity declined, culminating in the release of the band&#x27;s poorest-selling album to that point, &quot;Chicago XIV&quot;, which peaked at number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in 1980. Columbia Records subsequently bought out the remainder of Chicago&#x27;s contract.

In 1981, Cetera released his first solo album, &quot;Peter Cetera&quot;, on Warner Bros. Records, after personally buying the rights from his previous contract with Columbia Records, who would not release the project. The album peaked at number 143 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was considered a commercial failure. Cetera blamed Warner Bros., claiming that the company refused to promote him as a solo artist out of fear that he would leave Chicago, who had only recently signed with the label. Former bandmate Danny Seraphine agrees with Cetera on this point, and says that the album &quot;... sank like a stone due to lack of record company support. Warner Brothers didn&#x27;t want it to interfere with their plans for Chicago.&quot;

In 1982, David Foster was brought in as producer and the resulting group effort was &quot;Chicago 16&quot;. The album, which peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, represented a major comeback for Chicago, and leading the way was the hit single co-written by Cetera and Foster and featuring Cetera on lead vocals, &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;. It went to number one on the charts, was certified Gold by the RIAA in September of that year, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. It was also featured in the movie &quot;Summer Lovers&quot;, starring Daryl Hannah. The second single, &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, also co-written with Foster and sung by Cetera, reached number 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The third single, &quot;What You&#x27;re Missing&quot;, was yet again sung by Cetera. Cetera, a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), won ASCAP Pop Music Awards in the category, Most Performed Songs, for both &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; and &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, and was honored by ASCAP as a multiple songwriter winner.
In 1983, he took a break from his duties as Chicago frontman to add backing vocals on Paul Anka&#x27;s final U.S. Top 40 hit, &quot;Hold Me &#x27;Til the Mornin&#x27; Comes&quot;, which debuted in the summer of that year.

When &quot;Chicago 17&quot; was released in 1984, it became the veteran band&#x27;s most successful album in their history, eventually selling over six million copies in the United States alone. All four singles released from the album were sung by Cetera, including three which he co-wrote, and all of them charted in the top 20: &quot;Stay the Night&quot; (number 16), &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; (number 3), &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; (number 3), and &quot;Along Comes a Woman&quot; (number 14). &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;, written by Steve Kipner and John Lewis Parker, brought three Grammy nominations for Cetera: two nominations as a member of Chicago for Record of the Year and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal; and outside the group, as a co-nominee with David Foster for Best Vocal Arrangement for Two or More Voices, Cetera&#x27;s first, and to date only, nomination for vocal arrangement. Cetera won ASCAP honors for most-performed songs for &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;.
With the advent of the music video and the growing popularity of MTV, Cetera became the &#x27;face&#x27; and public leader of the longtime-faceless band that was Chicago.

====Departure from Chicago====
With his newfound popularity, Cetera was interested in recording another solo album. In addition, he had stated his lack of interest for the extensive touring schedule of the band, especially to promote &quot;Chicago 17&quot;. When the 17 Tour concluded in May 1985, Chicago&#x27;s management, along with several members of the band, expressed a desire to book another tour for that summer and start working on the group&#x27;s next album. The two sides could not resolve their differences and Cetera left the band in July 1985; he was replaced by Jason Scheff as both bassist and lead singer. Retrospectively Cetera said he wanted an arrangement similar to the one that Phil Collins and Genesis had at the time, with Collins being a member and touring with Genesis, while also doing some solo work at the same time, and his former bandmate Danny Seraphine agreed that&#x27;s what the group should have done. In a 1987 interview, Cetera said about his split from the group, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t amicable, but it wasn&#x27;t the worst. It&#x27;s nothing that me having a hit and them having a hit won&#x27;t make better.&quot;

====Solo career====

===== mid-1980s =====
After leaving Chicago, Cetera had immediate success as a solo artist. His first single, &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, was used as the theme song for the film &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot;. Co-written by Cetera, David Foster, and Diane Nini, Cetera has said it was written originally for the film, &quot;Rocky IV&quot;. It was a number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts in the US in 1986, and achieved similar success throughout the world. It went on to win an ASCAP Award for Cetera for Most Performed Songs from Motion Pictures and a BMI Film &amp; TV Award for David Foster for Most Performed Song from a Film. It was also nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award in the category of Best Original Song, as well as a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Male Artist. He performed a shortened version of the song live at the 59th Academy Awards ceremony. In two interviews Cetera gave in 1987, he discussed people&#x27;s confusion about &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, and said they thought initially that it was a new song by Chicago. By February of that year, however, he had achieved enough recognition as a solo performer to win the American Video Award for &quot;best new artist&quot;.

&quot;Glory of Love&quot; was included on Cetera&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Solitude/Solitaire&quot;, released in 1986. The album was also successful, with more than one million copies sold, and has been certified Gold and Platinum by the RIAA. It produced another number one hit single on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts, &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;, a duet with Amy Grant. &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. &quot;Solitude/Solitaire&quot;, which made it to number twenty-three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, outsold &quot;Chicago 18&quot;, the first Chicago album without him, which peaked at number thirty-five. Cetera was listed at number nine on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Pop Singles Artists—Male of 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;BB 12/27/86&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he teamed up with producer Patrick Leonard and released his third solo album, &quot;One More Story&quot;. Cetera and Leonard share writing credits on eight of the ten songs on the album, including the title song and the song &quot;One Good Woman&quot;, which became a number four hit single. Leonard also played piano and synthesizers on the album. The album features many well-known music artists, such as Richard Sterban of the Oak Ridge Boys on backup vocals; Bonnie Raitt on guitar and backup vocals on the song &quot;Save Me&quot;; David Gilmour of Pink Floyd on guitar on the songs &quot;Body Language&quot; and &quot;You Never Listen to Me&quot;; and Madonna, who was working with Leonard on her new album at the time, in cameo as &#x27;Lulu Smith&#x27; on vocals on the song &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. &quot;Save Me&quot;, co-written by Cetera and David Foster, was the original opening theme music for the TV show &quot;Baywatch&quot;. &quot;You Never Listen to Me&quot; plays during the opening scene of the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Redemption in Blood: Part 2&quot;, though it is not credited.

In 1989, Cetera recorded another duet, this time with Cher, called &quot;After All&quot;, which was included on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Chances Are&quot;, as well as on Cher&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Stone&quot; album. The song was a hit, reaching number six on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and receiving a Gold certification by the RIAA. In a 2014 article in &quot;Billboard&quot;, writer Keith Caulfield listed &quot;After All&quot; as Cher&#x27;s ninth-biggest &quot;Billboard&quot; hit.

===== 1990s =====
In 1990, a song by Cetera titled &quot;No Explanation&quot; was featured in the soundtrack for the popular film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;.

In 1991 Cetera co-wrote (with David Foster and Linda Thompson) and sang on &quot;Voices That Care&quot;, a song and supporting documentary music video intended to help boost the morale of American troops involved in Operation Desert Storm, as well as to support the International Red Cross organization. The single reached number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100&lt;ref name=&quot;BBHot100 5/4/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBAC 4/27/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Cetera&#x27;s final album on Warner Bros. Records, &quot;World Falling Down&quot;, was released. It featured the Adult Contemporary number one hit &quot;Restless Heart&quot;, as well as two other successful singles: &quot;Even a Fool Can See&quot;, and another duet, this time with Chaka Khan, &quot;Feels Like Heaven&quot;. The songs made it to number three and number five on the Adult Contemporary chart respectively. &quot;Restless Heart&quot; again won ASCAP honors for Cetera in the category Most-Performed Songs. According to writer Melinda Newman, &quot;World Falling Down&quot; &quot;lyrically describes the crumbling of his marriage.&quot;

In 1995, Cetera released his first album for River North Records, &quot;One Clear Voice&quot;, which featured the single &quot;(I Wanna Take) Forever Tonight&quot;, a duet with actress Crystal Bernard, which peaked at number twenty-three on the Adult Contemporary chart, and number eighty-six on the Hot 100 chart. Following the release of the album, Cetera launched his first solo tour—accompanied by his River North labelmate, country singer Ronna Reeves—lasting into 1996. The tour had been delayed while Cetera recuperated from a motorcycle accident.

1997 brought &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration: A Collection&quot;, a collection of all his duets from over the years, along with three re-recorded songs he had written while a member of Chicago—&quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, and &quot;Baby, What a Big Surprise&quot;—plus two brand-new recordings, &quot;Do You Love Me That Much&quot; and &quot;She Doesn&#x27;t Need Me Anymore&quot;. In a 1997 interview, Cetera said he had to remake the three Chicago songs because Chicago band members refused to release the master recordings for River North Records to use for this album. Although Cetera was at first reluctant to revisit his Chicago material, he soon had a change of heart and said, &quot;I viewed them as what I would do with the songs if they were new today.&quot; Additionally, this was the first of Cetera&#x27;s solo albums to feature &quot;After All&quot;, his 1989 duet with Cher from the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Chances Are&quot;.

Also in the 1990s, Cetera recorded covers of two of his songs from his Chicago days with the R&amp;B vocal group Az Yet. In 1996, Cetera performed a back-up vocal on Az Yet&#x27;s single of &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; from &quot;Chicago 16&quot;, titled &quot;Az Yet – Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry (Featuring Peter Cetera).&quot; The song was nominated, once again, for a Grammy Award, this time in the category of Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. In 1997, Az Yet performed vocals with Cetera on his single of &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, from &quot;Chicago 17&quot;, titled &quot;&#x27;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&#x27; – Peter Cetera featuring Az Yet&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bronson 10/5/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and they appeared together in a music video featuring the song.

===== 2000s =====

2001 saw the release of &quot;Another Perfect World&quot;.

In 2002, Cetera performed a medley of four of his songs at the Concert for World Children&#x27;s Day, backed by David Foster and an orchestra at Arie Crown Theater in Chicago. The concert aired on PBS and was released in DVD format. This led to his subsequent appearance, in October 2003, with the Chicago Pops Orchestra on the PBS music program &quot;Soundstage&quot;, which was broadcast throughout the U.S. Amy Grant appeared on the program as a special guest. The program was released on DVD.

From 2003 until summer 2007, Cetera performed a limited number of concerts each year with a 40-piece orchestra, playing re-arrangements of songs from throughout his career, including several from his tenure as a member of Chicago.

In 2004, Cetera released a collection of holiday classics, &quot;You Just Gotta Love Christmas&quot;. The track &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; features Alison Krauss on vocals with Cetera. The album also features background and duet vocals by his elder daughter, Claire. His younger daughter, Senna, contributed to the CD&#x27;s artwork. He appeared in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade that year, which was televised nationally, shortly after the release of the album.

In December 2007, Cetera embarked on the &quot;You Just Gotta Love Christmas&quot; tour of the United States. It marked a return to a traditional rock band show, his first since 1996, featuring songs from his 2004 Christmas album and from throughout his career.

He sang live with the Cleveland Pops Orchestra for &quot;Smucker&#x27;s Presents Hot Ice, Cool Sounds&quot;, an event featuring world-class ice skaters performing to the music of Peter Cetera. The show was taped on October 18, 2008, in Youngstown, Ohio, and televised nationally by NBC on December 25, 2008.

===== 2010s =====
Cetera appeared as himself in the 2010 Adult Swim program &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;, Season 5, Episode 9, &quot;Greene Machine&quot;, which also featured the actor Ted Danson. In it, Cetera sings &quot;Little Danson Man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Record 9/6/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cetera formed a new band called the Bad Daddies – a seven-piece electric rock band which performed original material and covers of popular songs, as well as material from Chicago and Cetera&#x27;s solo career. Cetera played bass on some songs during the shows.

In 2017, Cetera was a co-headliner for Night of the Proms in Germany and Luxembourg, his first time performing in Germany in 35 years.

In autumn 2018 Cetera returned to Europe. In October and November, he performed in London, Dublin, Randers (Denmark), Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin. Cetera was scheduled to perform in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, on November 9, but according to a September 4, 2018 post on the WeRock.bg website, the show was cancelled.

====Prospect of a reunion with Chicago====
During interviews, Cetera has often been asked about the prospect of a reunion with Chicago. While Cetera has compared his departure from the band to the divorce of a married couple, and thus far has declined to perform with the band despite attractive financial offers, he has also said &quot;never say never.&quot;

In December 2015, it was announced that the seven original members of Chicago – Cetera, Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, Walter Parazaider, James Pankow, Danny Seraphine, and Terry Kath – were to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the induction ceremony was set for April 8, 2016, at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Initially Cetera and current band members entertained the possibility of performing together for the induction ceremony. Ultimately, Cetera decided against it. He announced his decision via two posts to his web site, dated February 8 and February 25, 2016, and in those posts expressed his frustration with trying to work out the performance details with band members and show producers. Cetera did not attend the ceremony even for the purpose of accepting his award. Since then there have been indications that a reunion between him and Chicago is unlikely ever to happen. Cetera declined to be interviewed for the 2017 documentary &quot;Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago&quot;. He did, however, appear in the documentary &quot;The Terry Kath Experience&quot;, along with the other surviving members of the original Chicago line-up and producer James William Guercio.

==== Retirement ====
In a podcast interview with Mark Pattison from November 2019, Cetera said he was &quot;done.&quot; He explained that he had long wanted to quit performing before he lost his voice, and also cited the amount of travel involved in touring. He continued that he now had to &quot;learn how to be an out-of-work singer.&quot; His last live performance was November 23, 2018, for the opening of the Argyros Performing Arts Center in Ketchum, Idaho.

===Musicianship===
==== Vocal range, singing style and approach to singing ====
Cetera&#x27;s tenor voice has been labeled &quot;distinctive&quot; and &quot;unmistakable&quot; by music reviewers. In 2018 on the AXS TV show &quot;Top 10 Revealed&quot;, he was rated number nine of the show&#x27;s top ten &quot;high note hitters&quot;.

Cetera&#x27;s trademark singing style developed as a result of his having to sing for a period of time with a wired-shut jaw after getting into a brawl at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 1969.

In 2009 an interviewer noted that Cetera had been around for four decades, called him &quot;one of the most enduring singers around&quot;, and asked him how he takes care of his voice. Cetera responded: &quot;&#x27;I don&#x27;t smoke and I don&#x27;t drink. I try to exercise as much as I can. I do warm-up vocal exercises regularly.&#x27;&quot;

For Cetera, recording the vocals with members of the Beach Boys for &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; from &quot;Chicago VII&quot; was satisfying on a personal level, according to William James Ruhlmann. He writes that Cetera said, &quot;There&#x27;s two people that I always wanted to be, and that was a Beatle or a Beach Boy. …I got to do the background harmonies – myself and Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson and Al Jardine. For a night, I was a Beach Boy.&quot; Cetera had the opportunity, of sorts, to be both a Beatle and a Beach Boy. During a radio interview in 2015, he recalled as one of the highlights of his life a joint concert of Chicago and the Beach Boys when the two groups, who were performing on stage together, were joined by former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr for a rendition of the Beatles song &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot;.

====Recognition, popularity and influence as singer====
Cetera&#x27;s former Chicago bandmates had high regard for his voice and singing ability. In his autobiographical book, &quot;Street Player: My Chicago Story&quot;, Danny Seraphine, the original drummer for the band Chicago, recollects that when the group was being formed in the city of Chicago in the 1960s it needed someone who could sing in the high range. Seraphine says Cetera was, at that time, &quot;the best singer in the city&quot;. In a 1992 interview, seven years after Cetera had left the group, original band member and woodwinds player Walter Parazaider called Cetera &quot;one of the finest singers in the world&quot; and rated Cetera among his choice of top five singers. In a 2009 interview, former Chicago member Bill Champlin said of Cetera, &quot;I think he&#x27;s one of the major voices of our time,&quot; and that he believed Cetera was one of &quot;maybe the two best tenors on the Earth.&quot; In a 2016 documentary about the history of the group, original band member and keyboard player Robert Lamm says, &quot;There were and are a lot of tenor voices in rock and none of them sound like Cetera.&quot; In a 2022 interview, Lamm again lauded Cetera as having been an &quot;amazing vocalist&quot; when he was with Chicago.

The music recording industry has recognized Cetera for his singing with Grammy nominations. Five songs on which Cetera sang lead or shared lead vocals were nominated in pop vocal performance categories – &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;, &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, and &quot;The Next Time I Fall&quot;, with &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; winning its category.

Although Cetera has not gotten a song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts since the 1990s, songs he performed as a member of Chicago and as a solo act continue to pop up in the soundtracks of movies, television programs and commercials and live stage plays. Cetera&#x27;s composition from the 1976 album &quot;Chicago X&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot;, has appeared in the movies &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;A Lot like Love&quot; (2005), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) and &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home 2&quot; (2017); the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot;; and a television commercial that aired during the 2000 Super Bowl. Robert Lamm&#x27;s song from the 1970 album &quot;Chicago II&quot;, &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, which was sung by Cetera, was used in the 2017 film &quot;I, Tonya&quot;, and on the animated TV series &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. Cetera&#x27;s number one 1986 song as a solo performer, &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, was performed as the finale in the stage show &quot;Riot&quot;, in 2018 in Sydney, and was used in a 2019 episode of the NBC television series &quot;Good Girls&quot;. Chicago&#x27;s 1984 version of the Cetera/Foster song &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, which is sung by Cetera, was used for the soundtracks of the movies &quot;A Hologram for the King&quot; and &quot;Deadpool&quot; (both 2016); a 2017 Super Bowl commercial; and the television series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. Cetera&#x27;s music and name have been featured on several episodes of the American television situation comedy series &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; (2013–2023), set in the 1980s. In 2010, not only was Cetera&#x27;s music heard during a television commercial for Heineken Premium Light beer but Cetera himself was the subject of discussion. A young man at an assisted-living home holds up a copy of the &quot;World Falling Down&quot; LP cover and asks one of the residents why he likes Cetera. The older resident replies that he does not like Cetera but the ladies do &quot;and if you love the ladies, by default, you love Cetera.&quot; Cetera&#x27;s song &quot;Restless Heart&quot; from the &quot;World Falling Down&quot; album is heard playing in the background. In 2022 &quot;Restless Heart&quot;, a love song, was used in the Hulu film, &quot;Fresh,&quot; as a counterpoint to the horror being depicted in the scene. Two songs sung by Cetera, &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, and his duet with Cher, &quot;After All&quot;, made it on to Pandora&#x27;s list of &quot;Most-Thumbed Movie Songs Playlist&quot; in 2020.

Cetera has been given the honor of singing at professional sporting events, including at least one time singing the national anthem at a World Series game, the fourth in the series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Oakland Athletics in 1988 in Oakland; and at least three times for home team Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field, where he was guest conductor for &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch in 2003, 2007 and 2009 – a duty of some importance according to Jim Oboikowitch, Cubs manager for game and event production, as quoted by Adam McCalvy: &quot;Whenever you come to Wrigley Field, you have two questions ...Who is the starting pitcher? And who is singing the seventh-inning stretch?&quot;

Radio personality Doc Reno wrote in 2024, &quot;Peter Cetera may actually be the king of love songs.&quot; The Chicago song, &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;, in Reno&#x27;s opinion, &quot;best exemplifies Cetera&#x27;s pure vocal star power... better than any of his other power ballads.&quot;

====Bass equipment and playing style====
Cetera, a mainly self-taught musician who started playing bass guitar during his teenage years, has said he&#x27;s not the most &quot;knowledgeable&quot; bass player, that he doesn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; read music, and that his knowledge of chords &quot;[doesn&#x27;t] go much past &#x27;Is it major or minor? He cites James Jamerson, Paul McCartney and Andy Fraser among his bass influences and says that he was aware of John Entwistle and Jack Bruce. Writing for &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine, Stevie Glasgow says, &quot;Peter Cetera&#x27;s bass (and vocals) were key to Chicago&#x27;s sound. His tasty 4-string style was forged through a deep knowledge of early rock &amp; roll and R&amp;B, bolstered by a keen melodic sense, astute rhythmic prowess, and a dexterous technique capable of issuing graded nuance and fervent &quot;oomph&quot; in equal measure.&quot; Jeff Coffey gained a new respect for Cetera&#x27;s bass lines when he took over as Chicago&#x27;s bass player (2016–2018).

Cetera&#x27;s first bass guitar was a Danelectro Shorthorn. He switched to a Höfner 500/1 to use with the Exceptions. When the Höfner sound was deemed not &quot;bassy or ballsy&quot; enough for Chicago, he replaced it with a 1963 Fender Precision Bass. The Fender became his favorite and it was his usual choice of instrument throughout his 17-year tenure with the band.

Other basses that Cetera has played include the Fender Jazz Bass (in both fretted and fretless versions), Gibson EB-3, Gibson Ripper, Rickenbacker 4001, Steinberger, Ibanez, Music Man StingRay and Spector models. His amplification has varied between Ampeg, Orange, Kustom, Acoustic Control Corporation, Phase Linear and Sound City.

He currently endorses Wilkins basses, as well as Fender Precision Basses and Taurus bass amplification. He is a longtime user of LaBella flatwound bass strings. He briefly switched to the LaBella roundwound strings for a time, but was not satisfied with them and returned to flatwounds. He also uses Fender medium picks.

====Recognition and influence as bass player====
Cetera received high praise for his bass playing during his years with Chicago. In his review of a 1969 Chicago concert at the University of Hartford, Ken Cruickshank wrote, &quot;Their bass player, Peter Cetera, is perhaps the fastest and finest I&#x27;ve heard.&quot; Reviewing a 1972 live Chicago show at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles, Henry Mendoza, writing for the &quot;San Bernardino Sun-Telegram&quot;, labeled Cetera&#x27;s bass work &quot;superb&quot; and said Cetera &quot;emerged as one of rock&#x27;s finest bassists.&quot; After a 1973 performance at Middle Tennessee State University, writer Mike West reported his view of Cetera as more singer than bass player had changed, &quot;His bass work was great, driving to peaks of soul sound.&quot; Writer Brown Burnett called Cetera&#x27;s bass playing &quot;excellent&quot; in his review of Cetera&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Peter Cetera&quot; (1981). In a 2018 review writer Bob Helme said Cetera&#x27;s bass playing on the song &quot;Hot Streets&quot; is &quot;astounding&quot; and called Cetera &quot;an amazing bassist&quot;. In a 2019 article about the recording of the song, &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot;, Matt Hurwitz calls Cetera, &quot;a remarkable bass player.&quot;

Cetera was featured in the cover story of the December 2007 issue of &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine. Shortly thereafter, he saw former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee playing bass guitar on television. Cetera sent his compliments, along with an autographed copy of the issue, to Huckabee, who was at that time a presidential hopeful in the 2008 Republican primaries. Huckabee said, &quot;I was totally awestruck to get a letter from Peter Cetera. ...having one of the greatest bass players in my generation give me a compliment is like winning New Hampshire.&quot;

Jimmy Haslip, bass guitar player with the Yellowjackets, cites Peter Cetera as one of the bass guitar players who influenced him.

Bass player Will Lee says Peter Cetera influenced his playing, likening Cetera&#x27;s playing to &quot;a loose McCartney, but with all that Chi-town funk, and just as much taste and melodicism.&quot;

====Songwriting====
Cetera has gained recognition for his songwriting. He is a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), and as a songwriter he has won ASCAP honors in the category &quot;Most Performed Songs&quot; for &quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry&quot;, &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot;, &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, and &quot;Restless Heart&quot;. According to the website &quot;SecondHandSongs&quot;, &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; was covered by nearly one hundred different recording artists from around the world between 1976 and 2018, not including the duet version Cetera recorded with Italian vocalist Filippa Giordano for her 2018 album, &quot;Friends and Legends Duets&quot;. On February 22, 2017, it was announced that Cetera, Robert Lamm and James Pankow were among the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame inductees for their work as members of the music group Chicago. (Cetera did not attend the induction event, held Thursday, June 15, 2017, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.) In a 1986 interview, David Foster said of Cetera, &quot;He&#x27;s the best writing partner I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

About the process of writing songs, Cetera has said, &quot;I&#x27;m like the very bad student who only studies the day before a test! I only tend to write songs when I have a purpose – I need to know that I&#x27;m going to do a new album, and then I would start writing. There are not a lot of Peter Cetera songs lying around, because I don&#x27;t really write a lot of things when I&#x27;m not expected to do an album!&quot;

According to William James Ruhlmann, in 1969 the Moon landing, Walter Cronkite and convalescence after having his jaw broken provided Cetera with the right mix of inspiration and available time for him to write his first song with Chicago, &quot;Where Do We Go from Here?&quot;, which was included on Chicago&#x27;s second album. Until that time he did not perceive himself as a songwriter, telling Ruhlmann, &quot;I came from a band that did Top 40 [the Exceptions], …and as far as I was concerned, especially when the Beatles came along, number one, all melodies had already been taken, and, number two, certain people were songwriters and certain people were singers, and I didn&#x27;t consider myself to be a songwriter.&quot;

Cetera also tells Ruhlmann that songs can come to people in &quot;flashes&quot;, but without a recording device at hand they&#x27;re apt to &quot;disappear just exactly the way they come, into thin air.&quot; He says about the song &quot;Happy Man&quot;, from &quot;Chicago VII&quot;: &quot;[It] was a song I wrote about midnight driving down the San Diego Freeway on my motorcycle, ...It was the one and only song that I ever remembered, words and music, and I went home and sang it into a tape a day later, and that&#x27;s how that song came out.&quot;

===Producing credits===
Cetera co-produced seven of his eight solo albums: &quot;Peter Cetera&quot;, &quot;One More Story&quot;, &quot;World Falling Down&quot;, &quot;One Clear Voice&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration: A Collection&quot;, &quot;Another Perfect World&quot;, and &quot;You Just Gotta Love Christmas&quot;.

Cetera produced the album &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; by Swedish singer and ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog. It was released in November 1987, and reached number one on Swedish charts. Cetera also appears as a singer and composer on the album. The album featured a duet between Cetera and Fältskog, &quot;I Wasn&#x27;t the One (Who Said Goodbye)&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bronson 10/21/95&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Bruce Gaitsch co-wrote the title track, &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;. Gaitsch is also the album&#x27;s co-producer, and Cetera&#x27;s brother, Kenny Cetera, appears on background vocals.

Three years after country singer Ronna Reeves sang a duet with Cetera on his 1995 album, &quot;One Clear Voice&quot;, Cetera produced Reeves&#x27; 1998 album, &quot;Day 14&quot;. Reeves and Cetera were labelmates on River North Records, and she had accompanied him during his first solo tour in 1995–96.

==Acting credits==
Cetera has appeared in two movies: &quot;Electra Glide in Blue&quot;, filmed in 1973, in which he played the character of Bob Zemko; and Sidney Sheldon&#x27;s &quot;Memories of Midnight&quot;, a 1991 television movie made for the USA Network, in which he played the role of Larry Douglas.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Cetera suffered serious injuries when he was assaulted while attending a baseball game at Dodger Stadium with several bandmates. According to Cetera, four Marines took exception to a &quot;long-haired rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller&quot; rooting for the Chicago Cubs. He suffered a broken jaw in the attack, spent two days in intensive care and had his jaw wired shut for several months.

Cetera&#x27;s first marriage was to Janice Sheely.

Cetera married Diane Nini in 1982 and their daughter was born in 1983. Their marriage seems to have been over by the time his album, &quot;World Falling Down&quot;, was released in July 1992, according to writer Melinda Newman. Cetera and bandmate Robert Lamm were brothers-in-law during the time they were married to sisters Diane and Julie Nini.

In 1997, Cetera had a second daughter with then-girlfriend Blythe Weber. He met Weber while she was working at River North Records/Platinum Records.

Cetera, a longtime resident of Ketchum, Idaho, has lived in Idaho since the mid-1980s and is a sports enthusiast.

<doc id="1047218" wikidata="Q1115150" url="?curid=1047218" title="Commando (video game)">
<text>Commando, released as in Japan, is a 1985 vertically scrolling run and gun video game developed and published by Capcom for arcades. The game was designed by Tokuro Fujiwara. It was distributed in North America by Data East, and in Europe by several companies including Capcom, Deith Leisure and Sega, S.A. SONIC. Versions were released for various home computers and video game consoles. It is unrelated to the 1985 film of the same name, which was released six months after the game.

&quot;Commando&quot; was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing arcade video games of 1985 and one of the bestselling home video games of 1986. Though not the first miitary-themed run and gun video game, it spawned numerous clones following its release while popularizing the genre. Its influence can be seen in many shooter games during the late 1980s to early 1990s.

The game later appeared on &quot;Capcom Classics Collection&quot;, &quot;Activision Anthology&quot;, and on the Wii Virtual Console Arcade, as well as &quot;Capcom Arcade Cabinet&quot; for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. A sequel, &quot;Mercs&quot;, was released in 1989.

== Gameplay ==

The player takes control of a soldier named Super Joe, who starts by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter, and has to fight his way out singlehandedly, fending off a massive assault of enemy soldiers.

Super Joe is armed with an assault rifle (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades. While Joe can fire his gun in any of the eight directions that he faces, his grenades can only be thrown vertically towards the top of the screen, irrespective of the direction Joe is facing. Unlike his assault rifle bullets, grenades can be thrown to clear obstacles, and explosions from well-placed grenades can kill several enemies at once.

At the end of each level, the screen stops, and the player must fight several soldiers streaming from a gate or fortress. They are ordered out by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away, although shooting him in the back awards the player bonus points. Along the way, one can attempt to free prisoners of war as they are transported across the screen by the enemy.

Some home console ports of the game contain hidden underground shelters that can only be accessed with grenades. Inside these shelters are prisoners for the player to rescue. Some of these ports also include items. Among the items included in the NES version are a more powerful machine gun upgrade, an unlimited grenade upgrade, and &quot;glasses&quot; to let the player view all the hidden bunkers. The player will lose these upgrades after losing a life.

Extra lives are given at 10,000 points, and per 50,000 scored up to 960,000; thereafter, no more lives. Play continues until the last Super Joe is dead, or survives 140 levels, which ends the game.

The arcade version contains eight unique levels. The NES version contains only four unique level designs, but repeats those levels with minor changes and increasing difficulty to create a total of sixteen levels.

==Development==
The game was developed by Capcom, where it was designed by Tokuro Fujiwara. He was concurrently leading the development of both &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot; at the same time. Both games sold well for Capcom upon release.

== Ports ==
A home version of &quot;Commando&quot; developed by Capcom was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Activision released a port of the game for the Atari 2600 and INTV released a port for the Intellivision. An Atari 7800 version by Sculptured Software was published in 1989.

Elite released versions for many home computers. They released the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, and Amstrad CPC versions in November 1985. The BBC Micro and Acorn Electron versions were developed under contract by Catalyst Coders, while Elite developed the Amiga, Atari ST, Acorn Electron, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 versions.

The Commodore 64 port&#x27;s theme, a more complex and extended version of the arcade music, was created in less than 12 hours by Rob Hubbard, &quot;[I] started working on it late at night, and worked on it through the night. I took one listen to the original arcade version and started working on the C64 version. [...] By the time everyone arrived at 8:00 in the morning, I had loaded the main tune on every C64 in the building! I got my cheque and was on a train home by 10:00&quot;.

The arcade version was re-released on the Virtual Console as &quot;Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando&quot; in Japan on October 5, 2010, in North America on December 6, 2010, and in the PAL region on December 17, 2010.

===Unreleased versions===
A version for Atari 8-bit computers was created by Sculptured Software in 1989, intended to be released by Atari Corporation for the XEGS. However, although the game appeared in Atari catalogs of the time, it never reached the market in spite of being completed. In the 2000s the game&#x27;s prototype cartridge was found.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Senjō no Ōkami&quot; on their June 1, 1985 issue as being the most-popular arcade game for the previous two weeks. In the United States, it had topped the American &quot;RePlay&quot; chart for upright arcade cabinets by November 1985. In the United Kingdom, it became one of the top-grossing arcade games in London West End test locations, leading to orders for thousands of units in the UK alone, where it became a major hit. &quot;Commando&quot; similarly became a major hit across Europe. It had become the world&#x27;s top arcade game at the time. &quot;Commando&quot; sold more than 15,000 arcade PCB units by June 1985.

&quot;Commando&quot; ended the year as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1985 in the United Kingdom, while also outperforming &quot;Track &amp; Field&quot;, the UK&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1984. In the United States, it was one of the top three highest-grossing arcade video games of 1985, along with fellow Data East releases &quot;Karate Champ&quot; and &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;.

Mike Roberts of &quot;Computer Gamer&quot; called it &quot;a very exciting game&quot; and said &quot;the quality of animation and graphics is superb.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the fast-paced gameplay, smooth movement, rousing music jingle, and cartoon-style graphics, while criticizing the lack of color in the graphics. &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine said it &quot;is fierce and strategic, the graphics realistic and the fire power explosive&quot; which makes it &quot;an exciting and challenging play experience.&quot;

===Ports===
The home computer ports of &quot;Commando&quot; topped the UK software sales charts in December 1985, becoming the seventh best-selling game of 1985 in the UK. It topped the charts again in January 1986, and went on to become one of the top three best-selling games of 1986 in the UK. In the United States, the home computer versions received two Gold Awards from the Software Publishers Association in 1987 for more than 200,000 units sold in the region.

The NES version released in 1986 sold copies worldwide.

&quot;New Straits Times&quot; reviewed the BBC Micro, Amstroid CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions in January 1986, calling it a &quot;must-have&quot; war simulation &quot;to end all war simulation games&quot; with &quot;fast and furious&quot; action &quot;bordering on the impossible.&quot; &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said in 1988 that &quot;few cartridges can equal [&quot;Commando&quot;]&#x27;s non-stop action&quot; on the NES. &quot;TouchArcade&quot; reviewed the iOS version in 2017 and gave it a score of 2.5 out of 5 stars.

&quot;NintendoLife&quot; wrote, &quot;Commando might be one of the few examples of the stripped-down ports actually being stronger than the original game. These later ports added powerups, better music and depth to the gameplay that are all sadly lacking in the arcade original.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Computer Gamer&quot; magazine&#x27;s Game of the Year Awards gave the original arcade version of &quot;Commando&quot; the award for best coin-op game of the year, beating &quot;Paperboy&quot; and &quot;Marble Madness&quot;. After being ported to home computers, &quot;Commando&quot; was voted best arcade-style game of the year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards, and won the award for best shoot &#x27;em up game of the year according to readers of &quot;Crash&quot; magazine. In 1996, GamesMaster rated the game 57th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Commando&quot; was a highly influential game, popularizing the run-and-gun shooter genre along with military shooter themes. It led to run-and-gun games becoming the dominant style of shoot &#x27;em up during the late 1980s to early 1990s, when &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; called &quot;Commando&quot; &quot;the great grand-daddy of the modern shoot &#x27;em up&quot; genre. It has also been credited as the &quot;product that shot&quot; Capcom to &quot;8-bit silicon stardom&quot; in 1985, &quot;closely followed by&quot; &quot;Ghosts &#x27;n Goblins&quot;.

&quot;Commando&quot; spawned numerous clones following its release. Home computer clones and imitators released later the same year include &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot; and &quot;Rambo&quot;. The most successful &quot;Commando&quot; imitator was SNK&#x27;s arcade hit &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; (1986), which spawned two sequels. The run-and-gun shooter format of &quot;Commando&quot; was also adapted into a side-scrolling format by Konami&#x27;s &quot;Green Beret&quot; (&quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot;) later the same year.

===Sequels and successors===
&quot;Commando&quot; was followed by a sequel titled &quot;Mercs&quot; in 1989, which was known as &quot;Senjō no Ōkami II&quot; in Japan. However, it was not as successful as &quot;Commando&quot; or &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;. Tokuro Fujiwara was disappointed that he did not develop a &quot;Commando&quot; sequel sooner, as the arcade market already had numerous &quot;Commando&quot; imitators by the time &quot;Mercs&quot; released. A second sequel, &quot;Wolf of the Battlefield: Commando 3&quot; was released as a downloadable title for the Xbox Live Arcade and the PlayStation Network in 2008.

Outside Japan, the arcade version of &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; was marketed as a sequel to &quot;Commando&quot; and the main character, a nameless soldier in the game, is identified as &quot;Super Joe&quot; in an American brochure for the game. Super Joe would appear as an actual supporting character in the later versions of &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy, as well as in &quot;Bionic Commando: Elite Forces&quot;. In the 2009 version of &quot;Bionic Commando&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the character of Super Joe is identified as Joseph Gibson, one of the three player characters in &quot;Mercs&quot;.

The game &quot;Duet&quot; by Elite Systems Ltd was also called first &quot;Commando &#x27;86&quot; then &quot;Commando &#x27;87&quot;.

<doc id="1047220" wikidata="Q2540636" url="?curid=1047220" title="Thioredoxin reductase">
<text>Thioredoxin reductases (TR, TrxR) () are enzymes that reduce thioredoxin (Trx). Two classes of thioredoxin reductase have been identified: one class in bacteria and some eukaryotes and one in animals. Bacterial TrxR also catalyzes the reduction of glutaredoxin like proteins known as NrdH. Both classes are flavoproteins which function as homodimers. Each monomer contains a FAD prosthetic group, a NADPH binding domain, and an active site containing a redox-active disulfide bond.

== Cellular role ==
Thioredoxin reductases are enzymes that catalyze the reduction of thioredoxin and hence they are a central component in the thioredoxin system. Together with thioredoxin (Trx) and NADPH this system&#x27;s most general description is as a system for reducing disulfide bonds in cells. Electrons are taken from NADPH via TrxR and are transferred to the active site of Trx, which goes on to reduce protein disulfides or other substrates. The Trx system exists in all living cells and has an evolutionary history tied to DNA as a genetic material, defense against oxidative damage due to oxygen metabolism, and redox signaling using molecules like hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide.

== Diversity ==
Two classes of thioredoxin reductase have evolved independently:
* A high molecular weight (MW = ~55,000) type containing a selenocysteine residue in its active site has been identified in higher eukaryotes including humans. This TxR is related to glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, mercuric reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase.
* A low molecular weight (MW = ~ 35,000) type has been identified in archaea, bacteria and other eukarya.
These two classes of TrxR have only ~20% sequence identity in the section of primary sequence where they can be reliably aligned. The net reaction of both classes of TrxR is identical but the mechanism of action of each is distinct.

Humans express three thioredoxin reductase isozymes: thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1, cytosolic), thioredoxin reductase 2 (TrxR2, mitochondrial), thioredoxin reductase 3 (TrxR3, testis specific). Each isozyme is encoded by a separate gene:
== Structure ==

=== &quot;E. coli&quot; ===
In &quot;E. coli&quot; ThxR there are two binding domains, one for FAD and another for NADPH. The connection between these two domains is a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet. Each domain individually is very similar to the analogous domains in glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase, but the relative orientation of these domains in ThxR is rotated by 66 degrees. This becomes significant in the mechanism of action described below.
ThxR homo-dimerizes with the interface between the two monomers formed by three alpha-helices and two loops. Each monomer can separately bind a molecule of thioredoxin.

=== Mammalian ===
Mammalian TrxR structure is similar to &quot;E. coli&quot;. It contains a FAD and NADPH binding domain, and an interface between two monomer subunits. Mammalian ThxR has an insertion in the FAD binding domain between two alpha helices, which forms a small pair of beta strands. The active disulfide in the enzyme is located on one of these helices and thus the active disulfide bond is located in the FAD domain and not the NADPH domain as in &quot;E. coli&quot; and other prokaryotes.

== Mechanism ==

=== &quot;E. coli&quot; ===
In &quot;E. coli&quot; ThxR the spatial orientation of the FAD and NADPH domains are such that the redox-active rings of FAD and NADPH are not in close proximity to each other. When the FAD domain of &quot;E. coli&quot; is rotated 66 degrees with the NADPH domain remaining fixed, the two prosthetic groups move into close contact allowing electrons to pass from NADPH to FAD and then to the active site disulfide bond. The conserved active site residues in E. coli are -Cys-Ala-Thr-Cys-.

=== Mammalian ===
Mammalian TrxRs have a much higher sequence homology with glutathione reductase than &quot;E. coli&quot;. The active-site Cys residues in the FAD domain and bound NADPH domain are in close proximity removing the necessity for a 66 degree rotation for electron transfer found in &quot;E. coli&quot;. An additional feature of the mammalian mechanism is the presence of a selenocysteine residue at the C-terminal end of the protein which is required for catalytic activity. The conserved residues in mammalian active site are -Cys-Val-Asn-Val-Gly-Cys-.

== Detection methods ==
Thioredoxin reductase can be quantified by various methods such as the DTNB assay using Ellman&#x27;s reagent. The disulfide-based TRFS series of fluorescent probes have shown selective detection of TrxR. Mafireyi synthesized the first diselenide probe that was applied in the detection of TrxR. Other detection methods include immunological techniques and the selenocystine-thioredoxin reductase assay (SC-TR assay).

== Clinical significance ==

=== Cancer treatment ===
Since the activity of this enzyme is essential for cell growth and survival, it is a good target for anti-tumor therapy. Furthermore, the enzyme is upregulated in several types of cancer, including malignant mesothelioma. For example, motexafin gadolinium (MGd) is a new chemotherapeutic agent that selectively targets tumor cells, leading to cell death and apoptosis via inhibition of thioredoxin reductase and ribonucleotide reductase.

=== Cardiomyopathy ===
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common diagnosis in cases of congestive heart failure. Thioredoxin reductases are essential proteins for regulating cellular redox balance and mitigating the damage caused by reactive oxygen species generated via oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. Inactivation of mitochondrial TrxR2 in mice results in thinning of the ventricular heart walls and neonatal death. Furthermore two mutations in the TrxR2 gene are found in patients diagnosed with DCM and not in a control population. It is hypothesized that the pathological impact of these mutations is an impaired ability to control oxidative damage in cardiac myocytes.

=== Antibiotic ===
There has recently been some research to show that low molecular weight thioredoxin reductase could be a target for novel antibiotics (such as auranofin or Ebselen.) This is especially true for &quot;Mycobacterium Haemophilum&quot;, and could be used for antibiotic resistant bacteria.

<doc id="1047226" wikidata="Q3042661" url="?curid=1047226" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake">
<text>Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake (also called Lake Roosevelt) is the reservoir created in 1941 by the impoundment of the Columbia River by the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state. It is named for Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was president during the construction of the dam. Covering , it stretches about from the Canada–US border to Grand Coulee Dam, with over of shoreline; by surface area it is the largest lake and reservoir in Washington. It is the home of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area.

The reservoir lies in parts of five counties in northeastern Washington; roughly in descending order of lake acreage they are Ferry, Stevens, Lincoln, Okanogan, and Grant counties.

==Etymology==

Originally, the Bureau of Reclamation referred to the impoundment formed behind Grand Coulee Dam as the Columbia Reservoir. It was unofficially referred to as &quot;Columbia Lake&quot; and &quot;Empire Lake&quot; by local newspapers, including the &quot;Colville Examiner&quot; in Stevens County; the latter name was chosen in a 1941 contest organized by the &quot;Spokane Daily Chronicle&quot; and forwarded to the Department of the Interior as a suggestion. &quot;Empire Lake&quot; was suggested by 113 entries and was among the most popular of the suggestions, which also included &quot;Grand Coulee&quot; (later used for a separate reservoir), &quot;Sunset&quot;, &quot;Spokane&quot;, and &quot;Roosevelt&quot;; entries with the name &quot;Columbia&quot; were not considered due to its previous rejection by federal officials as an official name.

On April 17, 1945, five days after the death of President Roosevelt, Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes renamed the reservoir Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake. Secretary Ickes stated this token honor recognized how President Roosevelt championed the dam and advocated the legislation to create it. The accompanying Coulee Dam National Recreation Area was renamed for Roosevelt in 1996 to match the lake.

==Administration==
The lake and lands are managed under the Lake Roosevelt Cooperative Management Agreement dated April 5, 1990, succeeding an original 1946 agreement. Per the agreement, the management and regulations of Lake Roosevelt Management Area set out in the agreement are not intended to nor shall they interfere with or be inconsistent with the purposes for which the Columbia Basin Project was established, is operated and maintained; those purposes being primarily flood control, improved navigation, streamflow regulation, providing for storage and for the delivery of stored waters thereof for the reclamation of public and private lands and Indian reservations, for the generation of electrical power and for other beneficial uses, nor it is in intended to modify or alter any obligations or authority of the parties.

The National Park Service manages Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The NPS maintains visitor centers, boat-in campsites, shoreline camping, and conducts marine patrols for compliance with United States Coast Guard marine safety rules.

The Bureau of Reclamation has two management zones. One is directly behind the dam. It follows the log boom line from the west bank of the river to about mid-channel. Then at the Grant and Okanogan county line (in the middle of the lake) the boundary goes uplake for a short distance until it cuts across to the east shoreline. The other zone is located on the east side of the lake at China Bar, . Reclamation operates a log collection facility. Reclamation captures logs and other large debris before it enters Lake Roosevelt.

Bureau of Indian Affairs indirectly manages parts of the lake that are along the Colville Indian Reservation and Spokane Reservation.

Although some Washington Department of Natural Resources lands abut against Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area, the state&#x27;s Discover Pass does not cover use of NPS boat launches or tribal lands and waters.

==Pollution litigation==
The lake is downstream from the Canadian province of British Columbia&#x27;s Trail Smelter, and has been the subject of litigation over environmental concerns.

Cominco&#x27;s smelter deposited slag from its plant into the Columbia River, which then flowed into Lake Roosevelt. Environmental concerns were raised when these deposits were found to include mercury, lead and zinc. This discovery led the nearby indigenous group, the Colville Confederated Tribes, to take action against Cominco and hold them responsible for degrading the water quality of the lake. The pollution raised health concerns for tribe members, who used the beaches and campsites along the river and ate fish from the river &quot;for subsistence, cultural and spiritual reasons&quot;. The lawsuit, launched in 2004, was unique in that it demanded Cominco comply with a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) order to provide funding for pollution studies of the Trail operation. In a media statement released in 2003, Cominco agreed to invest $13-million for studies of the health and ecology of Lake Roosevelt, as well as fund the cleanup required to rid the lake of metal contamination associated with the company&#x27;s smelting practices; although the company&#x27;s agreement to fund the studies was well-intentioned, the Colville Confederated Tribes countered that Cominco&#x27;s offer was inadequate because it &quot;did not meet the quality of studies and cleanup guarantees that would be required under EPA rules&quot;.

The lawsuit between Cominco and the Colville Confederated Tribes sparked more tensions between Canada and the U.S. over transborder environmental laws. As a Canadian company, Cominco felt that their operation was being unfairly targeted because the lawsuit was ordering them to follow an American governing body&#x27;s orders to clean up Lake Roosevelt. Cominco also objected to the implication in the lawsuit that it was the only company responsible for the pollution of Lake Roosevelt.

In 1994, Cominco stopped depositing smelting byproducts into the Columbia River and in 2004 reportedly spent about $1 billion modernizing the Trail plant and reducing its emissions.

<text>Utah State Parks is the common name for the Utah Division of State Parks; a division of the Utah Department of Natural Resources. This is the state agency that manages the state park system of the state of Utah in the United States.

Utah&#x27;s state park system began with four heritage parks in 1957: Sugar House Park (which was later removed from the system), Utah Territorial Statehouse in Fillmore, This Is the Place Monument in Salt Lake City, and Camp Floyd outside of Fairfield.
Today, there are 46 Utah State Parks and several undeveloped areas totaling over of land and more than one million surface acres of water. Utah&#x27;s state parks are scattered throughout Utah; from Bear Lake State Park at the Utah/Idaho border to Edge of the Cedars State Park Museum deep in the Four Corners region, and everywhere in between.

The Division of State Parks also administers the Utah off highway vehicle, boating, and trails programs. In this capacity, they work to provide access to waterways and trails, and promote education, safety, and resource protection.

The division&#x27;s mission statement is &quot;To enhance the quality of life by preserving and providing natural, cultural, and recreational resources for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.&quot;

<text>In baking, a crust is the outer, hard skin of bread or the shell of a pie. Generally, it is made up of at least shortening or another fat, water, flour, and salt. It may also include milk, sugar, or other ingredients that contribute to the taste or texture. An egg or milk wash can be used to decorate the outside, as well as coarse sugar. A crust contributes to a pastry. 

The ratio of ingredients and mixing method determines the texture of the crust. If the flour is not well mixed with the shortening, then water can bind to the available flour causing the gluten protein matrix to become over developed. This would result in a tough crust, as opposed to a flaky crust, which is more desirable. 

Depending on the type of pastry, the crust can be baked before it is filled, or in baked (baked together with the filling). In pies, two different types of crust exist: one-crust pie and two-crust pie. A two-crust pie can have either a complete upper crust, a lattice top, or any of a variety of other decorative tops.

==Types==

In baking there are many types of crusts and doughs for these crusts depending on what you are trying to achieve. In pastries there are five different types of dough you can use as the crust; flaky, shortcrust, puff, choux and filo. 
;Flaky: Flaky crust is a delicate crust but very easy to make. Flaky crust can be used for sweet and savory treats. An example of a flaky crust is it can be used as the crust for a quiche. 
;Shortcrust: Shortcrust is a thicker crust. It is good for thicker treats like cookies. 
;Puff: Puff pastry crust is similar to flaky crust but is slightly lighter and may possibly be layered. Puff pastry is good for bakers and is what makes things like a chocolate croissant. 
;Choux: Choux is kind of like a shell when finished. It is also known for being paired with cream. Choux is good for things like eclairs or cannolis.
;Filo: Filo is very delicate and similar to puff. Filo is used in a lot of savory greek foods like spanokopita. 

Pies also use different types of crust depending on the flavor and idea a person is going for. There are eight main types of pie crust; Flaky, Tender, Hot Water, Sweet crust, Crostata, Creamcheese, Cornmeal, graham cracker or other cookie type, and Rough puff. Any of these crusts could work for any pie but the tastes are slightly different. When making a pie, a crust should be chosen which one will taste the best and hold in the filling.

<doc id="1047234" wikidata="Q527778" url="?curid=1047234" title="Amstrad NC100">
<text>The Amstrad NC100 Notepad is an A4-size, portable Z80-based notebook computer, released by Amstrad in July 1992. It featured 64 KB of RAM, the Protext word processor, various organiser-like facilities (diary, address book and time manager), a simple calculator, and a version of the BBC BASIC interpreter.

The computer&#x27;s design, evocative of the TRS-80 Model 100, features a screen with 80 character columns by eight rows, and not backlit, but this let the NC100 run for up to 20 hours on four standard AA cell batteries. There was an RS-232 serial port, a parallel port for connecting a printer, and a PC card socket, by means of which the computer&#x27;s memory could be expanded up to 1 MB.

==Design==
The NC100 was designed to be a portable computer which was simple to use. That was the brief given by Sir Alan Sugar (then chairman of Amstrad) to his design staff. The NC100 project was internally referred to as &quot;Alan&#x27;s Baby&quot; and Sugar himself tested the machine for usability during the design phase. The specifications for the computer were not considered important - as long as it could serve its purpose.

The user-friendly features of the NC100 come from the software which is included in the firmware. Protext and the other applications were designed with a computer novice in mind - although experienced users can find and use a large array of more complicated features.

Sugar wrote the first chapter of the NC100&#x27;s user manual in order to show that even he could use it.

The design also included terminal emulation and XMODEM file transfer software which enabled the NC100 to communicate through dial-up analogue modems. UK tech journalist Sue Schofield used one to upload a review of the NC100 directly into the online filing computer of the Independent newspaper in 1993. The review was written on the machine, and transferred from it over a battery-powered 300 baud modem.

==Upgrades==
An upgraded variant, the NC200 Notebook, appeared in late 1993. This came in a clamshell-type form factor with a flip-up screen featuring a backlit 80 x 16 character text screen and double the vertical pixel resolution as the NC100. The NC200 had a 720 KB 3.5&quot; floppy disk drive able to read/write MS-DOS-formatted disks, 128 KB RAM, and some extra software - notably three Tetris-like games and a capable spreadsheet with rudimentary database capability. However, these changes required much greater power use, requiring 5 C cell batteries. The disk drive could only be used at near full-charge, which meant that it could only be used a few hours after putting in new batteries. The laptop could function for considerably longer without using the disk drive. The backlight can be manually toggled off to save power by pressing the Control and Caps Lock keys at the same time.

An intermediate version, the NC150 Notepad, was also produced, but was available only in Italy and France; its case had the same design as the NC100, but it included the games later seen on the NC200.

== Variants ==
Both the NC100 and NC200 were licensed to a company called NTS Computer Systems in British Columbia and marketed as the Dreamwriter 100 and Dreamwriter 200, respectively. These were the same computers apart from having only Protext and Personal information manager apps installed (no BBC Basic, no games, and no spreadsheet). The Dreamwriter 200 had a 1.44 MB floppy disk drive, an upgrade from the NC200&#x27;s 720 KB drive. Its user guide cautions against using the low-density floppy disks.

The cases were off-white in color with blue and green stripes separating the screen from the keyboard. There were blue and green colored keys also. The Dreamwriters were retailed by Radio Shack in the U.S. for a short time in the mid-1990s.

<text>Risto Antero Jarva (15 July 1934 – 16 December 1977) was a Finnish filmmaker.

Jarva usually approached his long films and short documentary films from some social problem and from one or more possible ways to solve it. Such problems included the widespread use of cars, the position of women, city planning, pollution, the role of gossip magazines&#x27; journalists, and the Finnish society&#x27;s remaining ideological divides.

His 1967 film &quot;The Diary of a Worker&quot; was entered into the 5th Moscow International Film Festival.

He was a seven time Jussi Awards winner.

Jarva worked as an artistic professor of the film from 1970 to 1975 and as the Helsinki Applied Arts and Industry College&#x27;s senior teacher from 1975 to 1977. His last film was &quot;Jäniksen vuosi&quot; (&quot;The Year of the Hare&quot;). He died in a car accident on his way back from a private showing of the film, and the subsequent party.

<text>Geraldine Endsor Jewsbury (22 August 1812 – 23 September 1880) was an English novelist, book reviewer and literary figure in London, best known for popular novels such as &quot;Zoe: the History of Two Lives&quot; and reviews for the literary periodical the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. Jewsbury never married, but enjoyed intimate friendships, notably with Jane Carlyle, wife of the essayist Thomas Carlyle. Jewsbury&#x27;s romantic feelings for her and the complexity of their relations appear in Jewsbury&#x27;s writings. She tried unsuccessfully to encourage her close friend Walter Mantell to start a new life as an author after his disagreement with the New Zealand government over Maori land rights. 

==Family and education==
Jewsbury was born at Measham, Derbyshire (since 1897 Leicestershire), the daughter of Thomas Jewsbury (died 1840), a cotton manufacturer and merchant, and his wife Maria, née Smith, (died 1819). Her paternal grandfather, Thomas Jewsbury Sr (died 1799), had been a surveyor of roads, an engineer of canals and a philosophy student. In his will, he left the family four cottages, a warehouse, some land in Measham, and a large cash bequest.

Thomas Jr and Maria had six children: Maria Jane (1800), Thomas (1802), Henry (1803), Geraldine (1812), Arthur (1815) and Frank (1819). Maria Jane had literary interests and wrote for the &quot;Manchester Gazette&quot;. After their mother&#x27;s early death, she helped to bring up the family until she married, but she herself died young of cholera. Geraldine then took care of her father until he died, and also of Frank until he married.

Her father&#x27;s cotton business suffered from the War of 1812, and he became an insurance agent based in Manchester. Geraldine was educated at a boarding school kept by the Misses Darbys at Alder Mills near Tamworth, Staffordshire, and continued her studies in French, Italian and drawing in London in 1830–1831. Soon after returning to her family home, she began to suffer from depression, question her fate and express religious doubts. This change was reflected in her first novel, &quot;Zoe: the History of Two Lives&quot;.

==Relationship with Jane Carlyle==
About 1840, Jewsbury wrote to the eminent Scottish author Thomas Carlyle for advice about a literary career. Invited to his home in Chelsea, London, she immediately began a warm friendship and correspondence with his wife Jane that would become the deepest relationship of her life.

Jewsbury destroyed the letters she received from Jane, as Jane had agreed to destroy Jewsbury&#x27;s, which her sudden death prevented her from doing. Early on, Jewsbury developed passionate feelings for Jane, as surviving letters reveal. On the other hand, early accounts of Jane reveal ambivalence towards Jewsbury. When Carlyle proposed that Jewsbury visit them at 5 Cheyne Row in 1843, Jane hesitated, finally admitting to Carlyle: &quot;&#x27;Why I am afraid that having her beside me from morning till night would be dreadfully &quot;wearing&#x27;!&quot;&quot; She complained of how Jewsbury was &quot;always in a state of emotion! dropping hot tears on my hands, and watching me and fussing me&quot;.

Jane and Jewsbury weathered many disagreements, especially over the role of women, as Jane was a famously dutiful wife, who never considered a career of her own. However, the friendship lasted over 25 years; Jane attempted (unsuccessfully) to find suitors for Jewsbury, and Jewsbury nursed Jane through periods of illness.

Their relationship was studied by literary scholars, including Virginia Woolf in her article on Jewsbury’s letters to Jane. It also contributed to Jewsbury&#x27;s appearance in print that Jane helped to edit her first two books.

==Novels==
Jewsbury was primarily a novelist of ideas and moral dilemmas, who sharply questioned the standard, idealised roles of wife and mother and promoted the spiritual value of work in a woman&#x27;s life. She often made her female characters wiser and more capable than the male ones.

Her first novel, &quot;Zoe: the History of Two Lives&quot; (1845), tells of a girl who falls in love with a Catholic priest, causing him to lapse from his faith. The story carries a strong theme of doubt, not only about religious belief, but about marriage as a woman&#x27;s prime destiny. It was initially rejected by the publisher, but later accepted after an intervention by Thomas Carlyle. It was an immediate success, and praised by the &quot;Manchester Examiner&quot; as &quot;striking&quot; and &quot;clever&quot;, although other reviews were mixed. As a novel of scepticism, it can be classed with the work of Charlotte Mary Yonge and Mrs Humphry Ward, while the linking of sexual feelings with spiritual anguish brought comparisons with George Sand.

Jewsbury&#x27;s next novel, &quot;The Half Sisters&quot; (1848), also questions the role of wife and mother, which are seen as unsatisfying and limiting. The life of the conventional woman, Alice, compares unfavourably with that of her half-sister Bianca, who works as an actress to support an insane mother. The character of Alice carries touches of Jane Carlyle, while Bianca is based clearly on another of Jewsbury&#x27;s close friends, Charlotte Cushman. This was the author&#x27;s own favourite among her novels.

Her third novel, &quot;Marian Withers&quot; (1851), explores the same theme of women&#x27;s fulfilment, this time in an industrial setting, drawing on first-hand experience of the Manchester business world. It introduced the themes of education, creative invention, status in the workplace, and public philanthropy. The novel tells a number of different stories, connected by analogy, and some critics disliked such a fragmentary structure.

Three further novels (&quot;Constance Herbert&quot;, 1855; &quot;The Sorrows of Gentility&quot;, 1856; and &quot;Right or Wrong&quot;, 1859) attracted less interest. Jewsbury also wrote two novels for children: &quot;The History of an Adopted Child&quot; (1852) and &quot;Angelo, or, The Pine Forest in the Alps&quot; (1855).

==Short stories==
Dickens commissioned 17 stories from Jewsbury between 1850 and 1859, for his periodical &quot;Household Words&quot;. He once wrote to her, &quot;Dear Miss Jewsbury, – I make no apology for addressing you thus, for I am a reader of yours, and I hope that I have that knowledge of you which may justify a frank approach... If I could induce you to write any papers or short stories for [&quot;Household Words&quot;] I should, I sincerely assure you, set great store by your help, and be much gratified in having it.&quot;

==Reviewing==
Jewsbury is believed to have reviewed over 2000 books between 1846 and 1880, including novels, children&#x27;s books, memoirs, biographies, histories, cookbooks and household management books, mainly for the weekly &quot;Athenaeum&quot;. As most reviews were anonymous at that time, the exact total is unknown. Anonymity also set up an atmosphere of suspicion between authors and critics. Many of Jewsbury’s reviews were wrongly attributed to the novelist and non-fiction writer John Cordy Jeaffreson. When Rhoda Broughton discovered that an unfavourable review of her novel had been written by Jewsbury, she included an unflattering caricature of her in one of her later books, &quot;The Beginner&quot;, although this appeared after Jewsbury&#x27;s death.

Jewsbury was very much a moral critic. Her chief criterion was the ability of the characters to distinguish right from wrong, and this weighed with her more than the plot. For example, she disapproved of stories about an older man pining for a younger woman. She also disliked love scenes and domestic novels in general. Popular authors she reviewed included Anthony Trollope, George Eliot, George Meredith and Wilkie Collins.

Jewsbury also worked as a publisher&#x27;s reader for Hurst and Blackett and for Bentley, recommending, for example, that the latter publish Ellen Wood&#x27;s best-selling &quot;East Lynne&quot; (1861), although turning down such later successful authors as M. E. Braddon and Ouida. She often used her place with Bentley to boost the careers of other female writers, including friends like Margaret Oliphant and Frances Power Cobbe.

==Friends and romances==
Jewsbury was highly sociable, with many friends and literary partnerships, and able to find common ground with people of any class. Her growing prominence and unconventional personality, smoking and wearing men&#x27;s clothes like George Sand, soon brought her a high profile in literary society. Her friends included the Huxley, Kingsley, Rossetti, and Browning families, W. E. Forster (with whom she visited revolutionary Paris in 1848), John Bright, John Ruskin and G. H. Lewes.

She never married, but had close personal relationships with men and women, some carnal, some platonic, the most significant being with Jane Carlyle. Another was with the actress Charlotte Cushman, a powerful, notably mannish figure, whom she admired for her wide experience of life, which contrasted with Jane&#x27;s dutiful domesticity (Jane Carlyle became jealous and upset about the relationship). Cushman was the model for Bianca in &quot;The Half Sisters&quot;.

Sydney Owenson, also known as Lady Morgan, had helped Jewsbury when she first arrived in London, and Jewsbury provided much unconditional friendship, eventually helping her to write her memoirs in old age.

Of her male companions, the most significant was a government official in New Zealand, Walter Mantell, eight years her junior, who felt uneasy about his task of pressuring the Maoris to sell their land cheaply to the British, and returned to live in England. She made great efforts to promote him in the literary world, and even proposed marriage, but it seems that he began to sicken of her attentions and they drifted apart.

==Death==
Jewsbury moved to Sevenoaks, Kent, after the death of Jane Carlyle in 1866. She herself contracted cancer in 1879, died in a private London hospital in 1880, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery. She was writing until the end of her life, her last report for Bentley being dated 9 September 1880. She left all her papers to the businessman and feminist John Stores Smith, with whom she had had a strong relationship.

<text>Sal Soghoian is a user automation expert, software developer, author and musician. He joined Apple Inc. in January 1997 to serve as the Product Manager of Automation Technologies. These technologies include AppleScript, Services, the Terminal, Apple Configurator and Automator, among others. He left Apple in 2016 when his position was eliminated.

Soghoian has advanced Apple&#x27;s incorporation of automation into its products by writing the scripting dictionaries for iWork, iPhoto, Aperture, and Photos, and the Mastered for iTunes automation tools. He designed and wrote the automation tools in the Apple Configurator application, which uses macOS automation to manage iOS device deployment. Apple Configurator consists of a central AppleScriptObj-C library and a set of Automator actions. Apple Configurator automation tools enable iOS devices to be prepared, managed and refreshed automatically upon their connection to a hosting macOS computer.

Soghoian&#x27;s current projects include a collection of hundreds of voice-triggered dictation commands for controlling aspects of macOS, including the Keynote, Pages, Numbers, Photos, and the Finder applications. He created, hosts and manages a group of user automation resources at codice_1.

In late 2002, Soghoian joined an ad hoc team of engineers developing an application for creating and running automation workflows. After a year and a half of difficult but steady development, Soghoian showed the application to Steve Jobs. It was just one week before Apple&#x27;s 2004 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Jobs was impressed with the new tool and asked Soghoian to appear at the WWDC keynote to demonstrate Automator for the first time to attendees. This innovative integrated workflow feature was introduced as part of Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger. Soghoian holds related U.S. patent #7428535.

During Soghoian&#x27;s tenure, Apple&#x27;s native automation scripting language, AppleScript, was revived and upgraded to be PowerPC native in Mac OS 8.5. It was also successfully transitioned to Apple&#x27;s UNIX-based operating system, Mac OS X, becoming integrated with the native IDE, which included Project Builder and Interface Builder (the precursors to Xcode).

In the evolving releases of OS X from Lion to Mavericks, AppleScript added library support and direct access to the Cocoa frameworks through AppleScriptObj-C, a powerful fusion of AppleScript and the Objective-C programming language. OS X Yosemite introduced JavaScript for Automation (JXA), a peer to AppleScript providing access to Apple Events and Cocoa through an enhanced version of JavaScript Core.

Soghoian was an advocate for AppleScript years before being employed by Apple. As a consultant, he created automation solutions for the publishing industry in the 1990s. Soghoian also authored a popular script collection called Sal&#x27;s AppleScript Snippets, the ShadowCaster Quark XTension, two books, including AppleScript 1-2-3, and numerous magazine articles about automation. He was a special guest at one Leopard Tech Talk. He was a featured presenter for Quark, Thunder Lizard Productions, Apple, Seybold, and the Macworld conferences.

== Personal life ==
Sal Soghoian was born into an Armenian-American military family, and spent his childhood growing up on Marine and Naval bases, including Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, from which he was evacuated during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In his college years, he attended the University of Virginia in 1969 for a short time, but later moved to Boston where he earned a degree in music from the Berklee College of Music. In the late 1980s he returned to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he worked at the digital printshop &quot;Pixels.&quot; Although he is known for his work at Apple, he is also an avid jazz musician. During his time in Charlottesville, he played guitar in a band called &quot;Blue Indigo&quot;. The band is notable because it was composed of Carter Beauford (drummer), LeRoi Moore (Saxophone), George Melvin (Hammond B3 organ), and Soghoian (guitar). Beauford and Moore would go on to later musical fame as founding members of the Dave Matthews Band. Jeff Decker and Phil Riddle joined, following their departure.

He is the uncle of noted privacy researcher &amp; activist, Christopher Soghoian.

<doc id="1047267" wikidata="Q20672214" url="?curid=1047267" title="Ottoia">
<text>Ottoia is a stem-group archaeopriapulid worm known from Cambrian fossils. Although priapulid-like worms from various Cambrian deposits are often referred to &quot;Ottoia&quot; on spurious grounds, the only clear &quot;Ottoia&quot; macrofossils come from the Burgess Shale of British Columbia, which was deposited . Microfossils extend the record of &quot;Ottoia&quot; throughout the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, from the mid- to late- Cambrian. A few fossil finds are also known from China.

== Morphology ==

&quot;Ottoia&quot; specimens are on average 8 centimeters in length. Both length and width show variation with contraction; shorter specimens often being wider than longer ones. The characteristic proboscis of priapulids is present at the anterior, attached to the trunk of the animal, proceeded by the &quot;bursa&quot; at the posterior. The organism&#x27;s body is bilaterally symmetrical, however, its anterior displays external radial symmetry. Like some other modern invertebrates, a cuticle restricts the size of and protects the animal.

The trunk hosts the internal organs of the organism, divided into seventy to a hundred annulations of varying spacing, depending on curvature and contraction. The posterior displays a series of hooks, which likely acted as anchors during burrowing. Muscles support the animal and retract the bursa and proboscis. A gut leading from the anus in the bursa to the mouth in the proboscis runs through the trunk&#x27;s spacious body cavity, and a concentration of gut muscles serve the function of a gizzard. A nerve chord runs down the organism&#x27;s length. In addition to the other organs, it is possible &quot;Ottoia&quot; contained urogenital organs in its trunk. There is no evidence of a respiratory organ, though the bursa may have served this purpose.

The everted proboscis of &quot;Ottoia&quot; bears an armature of teeth and hooks. The detailed morphology of these elements distinguishes the two described species, &quot;O. tricuspida&quot; and &quot;O. prolifica&quot;. At the base of the pharynx, separated from the teeth by an unarmed region, sits a ring of spines. Behind this, at the front of the trunk, lies a series of hooks and spines, arranged in a quincunx pattern like the five dots on a domino or dice.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Ottoia&quot; was a burrower that hunted prey with its eversible proboscis. It also appears to have scavenged on dead organisms such as the arthropod &quot;Sidneyia&quot;.

The spines on the proboscis of &quot;Ottoia&quot; have been interpreted as teeth used to capture prey. Its mode of life is uncertain, but it is thought to have been an active burrower, moving through the sediment after prey, and is believed to have lived within a U-shaped burrow that it constructed in the substrate. From that place of relative safety, it could extend its proboscis in search of prey. Gut contents show that this worm was a predator, often feasting on the hyolithid &quot;Haplophrentis&quot; (a shelled animal similar to mollusks), generally swallowed them head-first. They also show evidence of cannibalism, which is common in priapulids today.

== Preservation ==

Because of its bottom-living habit and the location of the Burgess Shale site at the foot of a high limestone reef, one may presume the relative immobility of &quot;Ottoia&quot; placed it in danger of being carried away and/or buried by any underwater mud avalanche from the cliff top. This may explain why it remains one of the more abundant specimens of the Burgess Shale fauna.

== Distribution ==

At least 1000 Burgess Shale specimens are known in the UNSM collections alone, in addition to the ROM collections and hundreds of specimens elsewhere. 677 specimens of &quot;Ottoia&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 1.29% of the community.

&quot;Ottoia&quot; has also been reported from Middle Cambrian deposits in Utah and Spain, Nevada, and various other localities. Nevertheless, these reports are insecure, and the only verifiable &quot;Ottoia&quot; macrofossils herald from the Burgess Shale itself.

Microfossils corresponding to &quot;Ottoia&quot; teeth, however, have a much broader distribution, and are found throughout the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Indeed, putative candidates (initially described under the ICBN as &quot;Goniomorpha&quot;) may extend the range of &quot;Ottoia&quot;, or at least similar priapulans, into the Ordovician. One poorly preserved specimen that probably belongs to &quot;Ottoia&quot;, was discovered in the Lower Ordovician Madaoyu Formation in Hunan, China.

<doc id="1047274" wikidata="Q457995" url="?curid=1047274" title="La Citoyenne">
<text>La Citoyenne (, &quot;The Citizeness&quot;) was a French feminist newspaper published in Paris from 1881 through 1891 by Hubertine Auclert. It was first published on February 13, 1881, and appeared bi-monthly. The newspaper was a forceful and unrelenting advocate for women&#x27;s enfranchisement, demanding changes to the Napoleonic Code that relegated women to a vastly inferior status. The newspaper demanded that women be given the right to run for public office, claiming that the unfair laws would never have been passed had the views of female legislators been heard. Notable feminists such as Marie Bashkirtseff wrote articles for the paper.

During the newspaper&#x27;s existence, the League for the Rights of Women was founded by Léon Richer in 1882, and in 1888 &quot;Le Conseil International des Femmes&quot; (CIF) was organized, creating the first international feminist organisation. In 1891, Hubertine Auclert ran out of money and her newspaper closed. That same year, activist Maria Martin (1839–1910) launched &quot;Le Journal des femmes&quot; and on December 9, 1897, high-profile actress and journalist Marguerite Durand (1864-1936) continued the cause and opened another feminist newspaper called &quot;La Fronde&quot;.

The gun was designed in preparation for the Battle of France but was not ready for action when that battle began, and the Wehrmacht offensive through Belgium rapidly outflanked and isolated the Maginot Line, which was then besieged with more conventional heavy guns until French capitulation. Gustav was later deployed in the Soviet Union during the Battle of Sevastopol, part of Operation Barbarossa, where, among other things, it destroyed a munitions depot located roughly below sea level. The gun was moved to Leningrad, and may have been intended to be used in the Warsaw Uprising like other German heavy siege pieces, but the uprising was crushed before it could be prepared to fire. Gustav was destroyed by the Germans near the end of the war in 1945 to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army.

&quot;Schwerer Gustav&quot; was the largest-calibre rifled weapon ever used in combat, and in terms of weight, the heaviest mobile artillery piece ever built. It fired the heaviest shells of any artillery piece. It was surpassed in calibre only by the British Mallet&#x27;s Mortar and the American Little David bomb-testing mortar—both at —but was the only one of the three to go into action.

==Development==
In 1934, the German Army High Command (Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH)) commissioned Krupp of Essen to design a gun to destroy the forts of the French Maginot Line that were nearing completion. The gun&#x27;s shells had to punch through seven metres of reinforced concrete or one full metre of steel armour plate, from beyond the range of French artillery. Krupp engineer Erich Müller calculated that the task would require a weapon with a calibre of around , firing a projectile weighing from a barrel long. The weapon would have a weight of over . The size and weight meant that to be at all movable it would need to be supported on twin sets of railway tracks. The railway tracks were specifically engineered to accommodate the immense weight and size of &quot;Schwerer Gustav&quot;. Constructed with reinforced steel, these tracks provided a stable foundation for the weapon&#x27;s movement. Specialized locomotives and cranes were employed to transport and position the gun with precision. 

In common with smaller railway guns, the only barrel movement on the mount itself would be elevation, traverse being managed by moving the weapon along a curved section of railway line. Krupp prepared plans for calibres of 70 cm, 80 cm, 85 cm, and 1 m.

Nothing further happened until March 1936 when, during a visit to Essen, Adolf Hitler inquired as to the giant guns&#x27; feasibility. No definite commitment was given by Hitler, but design work began on an 80 cm model. The resulting plans were completed in early 1937 and approved. Fabrication of the first gun started in mid-1937. Technical complications in the forging of such massive pieces of steel made it apparent that the original completion date of early 1940 could not be met.

Krupp built a test model in late 1939 and sent it to the Hillersleben proving ground for testing. Penetration was tested on this occasion. Firing at high elevation, the shell was able to penetrate the specified seven metres of concrete and the one metre armour plate. When the tests were completed in mid-1940 the complex carriage was further developed. Alfried Krupp, after whose father the gun was named, personally hosted Hitler at the Rügenwalde (now Darłowo, Poland) Proving Ground during the formal acceptance trials of the Gustav Gun in early 1941.

Two guns were ordered. The first round was test-fired from the commissioned gun barrel on 10 September 1941 from a makeshift gun carriage at Hillersleben. In November 1941, the barrel was taken to Rügenwalde, where eight further firing tests were carried out using the 7,100 kilogram armour-piercing (AP) shell out to a range of .

In combat, the gun was mounted on a specially designed chassis, supported by eight bogies on two parallel railway tracks. Each of the bogies had five axles, giving a total of 40 axles (80 wheels). Krupp named the gun &quot;Schwerer Gustav&quot; (Heavy Gustav) after the senior director of the firm, Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach.

The gun could fire a heavy concrete-piercing shell and a lighter high-explosive shell. An extremely-long-range rocket projectile was also planned with a range of , that would require the barrel being extended to .

In keeping with the tradition of the Krupp company, no payment was asked for the first gun. They charged seven million Reichsmark (approximately 24 million USD in 2015) for the second gun, &quot;Dora&quot;, named after the senior engineer&#x27;s wife.

==History==
===Schwerer Gustav===
In February 1942, Heavy Artillery Unit (E) 672 reorganised and went on the march, and &quot;Schwerer Gustav&quot; began its long ride to Crimea. The train carrying the gun was of 25 cars, a total length of 1.5 kilometres (0.9 mi). The gun reached the Perekop Isthmus in early March 1942, where it was held until early April. The Germans built a special railway spur line to the Simferopol-Sevastopol railway north of the target. At the end of the spur, they built four semi-circular tracks especially for the Gustav to traverse. Outer tracks were required for the cranes that assembled Gustav.

The siege of Sevastopol was the gun&#x27;s first combat test. 4,000 men and five weeks were needed to get the gun into firing position; 500 men were needed to fire it. Installation began in early May, and by 5 June the gun was ready to fire. The following targets were engaged:
* 5 June
** Coastal guns at a range of 25,000 m. Eight shells fired.
** Fort &quot;Stalin&quot;. Six shells fired.
* 6 June
** Fort &quot;Molotov&quot;. Seven shells fired.
** &quot;White Cliff&quot; also known as &quot;Ammunition Mountain&quot;: an undersea ammunition magazine in Severnaya (&quot;Northern&quot;) Bay. The magazine was sited 30 metres under the sea with at least 10 metres of concrete protection. After nine shells were fired, the magazine was ruined and one of the boats in the bay sunk.
* 7 June
** Firing in support of an infantry attack on Südwestspitze, an outlying fortification. Seven shells fired.
* 11 June
** Fort &quot;Siberia&quot; knocked out of action. Five shells fired.
* 17 June
** Maxim Gorky Fortresses bombarded. Five shells fired.

By the end of the siege on 4 July the city of Sevastopol lay in ruins, and 30,000 tons of artillery ammunition had been fired. Gustav had fired 47 rounds and worn out its original barrel, which had already fired around 250 rounds during testing and development. The gun was fitted with the spare barrel and the original was sent back to Krupp&#x27;s factory in Essen for relining.

The gun was then dismantled and moved to the northern part of the Eastern Front, where an attack was planned on Leningrad. The gun was placed 30 km (18.6 mi) from the city near the railway station of Taytsy. The gun was fully operational when the attack was cancelled. The gun then spent the winter of 1942/43 near Leningrad.

===Dora===
&quot;Dora&quot; was the second gun produced. It was deployed briefly during the Battle of Stalingrad, where the gun arrived at its emplacement west of the city towards the end of August 1942. It was ready to fire on 13 September. It was withdrawn when Soviet forces threatened to encircle the German forces. When the Germans began their long retreat, they took &quot;Dora&quot; with them.

===Langer Gustav===
The Langer Gustav was a long cannon with 52 centimetre (20.5 in) calibre and a 43-metre barrel. It was intended to fire super-long-range rocket projectiles weighing 680 kilograms to a range of 190 kilometres (118 mi). This gave it the range to hit London from Calais, France. It was never completed after being damaged during construction by one of the many RAF bombing raids on Essen.

===Landkreuzer P. 1500 Monster Project===

The Monster was to be a 1,500 tonne mobile, self-propelled platform for an 80-cm K (E) gun, along with two 15 cm sFH 18 heavy howitzers, and multiple MG 151 autocannons normally used on combat aircraft. It was deemed impractical, and in 1943 was cancelled by Albert Speer. It never left the drawing board and no progress was made. It would have surpassed the Panzer VIII Maus (the heaviest tank ever built) and the Landkreuzer P. 1000 Ratte (never built) in weight and size.

==Postwar whereabouts==
On 14 April 1945, one day before the arrival of US troops, Schwerer Gustav was destroyed to prevent its capture. On 22 April 1945, its ruins were discovered in a forest north of Auerbach and about southwest of Chemnitz. In summer 1945 Schwerer Gustav was studied by Soviet specialists and in autumn of the same year was transferred to Merseburg, where the Soviets were gathering German material. 

In March 1945, &quot;Dora&quot; was transferred to Grafenwöhr and was destroyed on 19 April 1945. The debris was discovered by American troops sometime after the discovery of &quot;Schwerer Gustav&#x27;s&quot; ruins. The debris was scrapped in the 1950s.

Part of the third (52 centimetre) gun was found after the war in the Krupp production facilities in Essen.

The world&#x27;s largest &quot;Dora ensemble&quot; is located in the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden.

<doc id="1047287" wikidata="Q1089816" url="?curid=1047287" title="Church of South India">
<text>The Church of South India (CSI) is a united Protestant Church in India. It is the result of union of a number of Protestant denominations in South India that occurred after the independence of India. The Church of South India ordains women and transgender clergy, supports LGBTQ inclusion, advocates decriminalisation of same-sex relationships, and is open to blessing same-sex couples. With a membership of nearly four million, it is the second-largest Christian church based on the number of members in India.

The Church of South India is the successor of a number of Protestant denominations in India, including the four southern dioceses of the Church of India, Burma and Ceylon (Anglican), the South India United Church (Congregationalist, Presbyterian and Continental Reformed), and the southern district of the Methodist Church.

The Church of South India is a member of the Anglican Communion, World Methodist Council and World Communion of Reformed Churches. It is one of four united Protestant churches in the Anglican Communion, World Methodist Council and World Communion of Reformed Churches, with the others being the Church of North India, the Church of Pakistan, and the Church of Bangladesh.

Being a United Protestant denomination, the inspiration for the Church of South India came from ecumenism and the words of Jesus as recorded in the Gospel of John (17.21); as such &quot;That they all may be one&quot; is the motto of the Church of South India.

==History==

===Origins===
Four different church traditions were brought together in the CSI: Anglican, Congregational, Presbyterian, and Methodist. All these churches had been established in India through the missionary work of churches in Europe, America, and Australia, which had started their work in India at different periods from the beginning of the 18th century.

The Church of South India Scheme was the first practical attempt of its kind toward a union, on the basis of the following points enunciated in the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral:
* The Holy Scripture of the Old and the New Testaments as containing all things necessary to salvation and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith.
* The Apostles&#x27; Creed as the Baptismal Symbol and the Nicene Creed as sufficient statement of the Christian faith.
* The two sacraments, ordained by Christ Himself — Baptism and the Supper of the Lord — ministered with the unfailing use of Christ&#x27;s words of Institution and elements ordained by Him.
* The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying need of the nations and people called of God into the union of His Church.

The first three points could be accepted without any controversial question. But the fourth became contentious, as the Anglican Church maintained episcopal polity within the historical episcopate and believed that all its bishops and priests could trace an unbroken line of succession from St. Peter; whereas the rest of the churches in the negotiations conformed to other ecclesiastical polities and did not subscribe to the Anglican views on apostolic succession. After extensive dialogues, an agreement was reached that all who were already ordained in any of the uniting churches would be received as ministers in the united Church; provided all new ordinations after the union, would be conferred by episcopally ordained bishops of the united Church, with the imposition of hands. The intention was to introduce an episcopate in historic succession (from Anglicanism) into the new united Church and to ensure its maintenance in the future, by keeping all subsequent ordinations episcopal.

The Church of South India as it exists today came into being with the perseverance and committed efforts of Rev. Vedam Santiago, who for a long period of time took leadership of the SIUC, the South Indian United Churches, which later, with the joint efforts of Rev. V Santiago and Bishop Azariah became the Church of South India.

=== Formation ===
The Church of South India union ceremony happened at St George&#x27;s Cathedral in Madras on 27 September 1947, a month after India achieved its independence from the United Kingdom. It was formed from the union of the SIUC, (South India United Church itself a union of churches from the Congregational, Presbyterian and Reformed traditions); the southern provinces of the (Anglican) Church of India, Pakistan, Burma and Ceylon; and the Methodist Church of South India. The inaugural service was presided by Bishop Rt. Rev. C. K. Jacob, of the Anglican diocese of Travancore and Cochin. As part of it, nine new bishops, drawn from all the traditions, were consecrated to serve with five Anglican bishops already in the office. Each new bishop was ordained with the imposition of hands by the presiding bishop, along with two more Anglican bishops (Rt. Rev. A. M. Hollis and Rt. Rev. G. T. Selwynthe) and six presbyters from the uniting Churches, also laying hands. This reconciliation of the Anglican views with those of the other uniting denominations, on the doctrine of apostolic succession, realized in the formation of the Church of South India, is often cited as a landmark in the ecumenical movement.

==Logo==
The logo of the Church of South India consists of a Cross superimposed on a stylized Lotus flower in a white backdrop; around which the motto and name of the Church, is embossed. It was designed by J. Vasanthan of the American College, Madurai.

The imposing central position of the Cross denotes the foundation of the Church and its faith, while its four arms of the same length promulgates equality. The Lotus flower, called Pankaj meaning &quot;mud-born&quot; in Sanskrit, has been of great spiritual and symbolic significance in India, since ancient times. Its placement in the Logo, proclaims the indigenous nature of the Church of South India and its dependence on the grace of God, just as a Lotus that blooms at sunrise and closes at sunset, depends on the Sun. The stylized rendering, makes the Lotus petals simultaneously depict the fiery split tongues of the Holy Spirit. The motto of the CSI embossed on the logo, which is an excerpt of Jesus&#x27;s prayer in John 17:21, is used as an inclusive affirmation of the need for the unity of all people.

==Beliefs and practices==
The Church of South India is a Trinitarian Church that draws from the traditions and heritage of its constituent denominations. The Church accepts the Chalcedonian Christological Definition, as well as the Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Nicene Creed. Both creeds are included in the Church liturgy as the profession of faith. The Church practices infant baptism for children born in Christian homes and adult or believer&#x27;s baptism for others. Baptized children are members of the church and share in the privileges and obligations of membership so far as they are capable of doing so.

The Church of South India practices the rite of Confirmation, by which the &quot;confirmands&quot; (those being confirmed) upon profession of their Christian faith, obtain confirmation of their baptisms and thereafter, get to partake fully in the privileges and obligations associated with Church membership. Secondarily, this is also a coming of age ceremony. Confirmation is almost always administered by a Bishop with the imposition of hands and occasionally by a Presbyter who is authorized to confirm.

=== Women&#x27;s Ordination ===
In 2013, the CSI consecrated its first female bishop, Eggoni Pushpalalitha. The Church of South India, since 1984, has allowed women&#x27;s ordination. Additionally, &quot;it has taken up issues of gender, dalits and landlessness.&quot;

=== LGBTQ issues ===
Some dioceses of the church have confirmed that transgender persons may be ordained as clergy. On transgender issues, the Diocese of Madras has a ministry specifically for transgender people. In 2012, the denomination invited a transgender pastor to preach.

In 2016, a seminary affiliated with the CSI offered a seminar on LGBT issues. &quot;The Tamil Nadu Theological Seminary in Madurai held a two-hour seminar on gender and sexuality...&quot; 

The National Council of Churches in India, of which the CSI is a member, supported the legalization of consensual same-sex relationships in India. 

In 2015, St. Mark&#x27;s Cathedral, Bangalore hosted an event, co-led by the Rev. Vincent Rajkumar, aimed at denouncing homophobia. CSI clergy, working with the National Council of Churches in India also co-led a consultation speaking out against homophobia. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) listed the Church of South India as being among the Anglican provinces open to blessing same-sex couples.

However, in 2008, some CSI churches supported the faction of the Anglican Church—Global Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans (GAFCON)— which opposed allowing gay priests inside church. “The Bible does not recognise gay marriages or gay priests,” said Reverend Benny Thomas of CSI, Mumbai. Indian bishops sided with traditionalists on the issue of homosexuality. The church does not ordain clergy who are active in same-sex relationships.

In 2023 the Communion of Churches in India, of which the CSI is a part, filed an application before the Supreme Court opposing petitions for same-sex marriage, writing that marriage is a divine institution uniting two persons of the opposite sex, and also writing to the President of India on the subject.

=== Capital punishment ===
The Church of South India opposes the death penalty.

==Liturgy==
The CSI Synod Liturgical Congress has developed several new orders for worship for different occasions. The order for the Communion service, known as the CSI Liturgy, has been internationally acclaimed as an important model for new liturgies. The committee has also produced three different cycles of lectionaries for daily Bible readings and &quot;propers&quot;, and collects for Communion services. In addition, the committee has also brought out a supplement to the Book of Common Worship. Cherishing the reformation principle of worship in the native language, the CSI liturgy and church services are completely in the vernacular, in all the different South Indian states and Northern Sri Lanka, which comprise its ecclesiastical province.

==Observances and festivals==
The important observances and festivals include Lent (including its first day, Ash Wednesday), Passion Week, Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, Easter, Ascension Thursday, Pentecost, Lammas and Christmas.

==Constitution==
The Constitution of the CSI is the key document that governs the administration and management of the church. It comprises 14 chapters detailing rules for the functioning of the Church at every level, from local congregations to the pastorate, dioceses and the Synod. The most important part of the CSI Constitution is &quot;The Governing Principles of the Church&quot; which sets out 21 governing principles on which the other chapters of the Constitution and the rules contained therein rest. While amending any part of the Constitution can be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Synod, amending the Governing Principles requires a three-fourths majority.

==Ecumenism==
As a united Protestant Church, the Church of South Indian is a member of the World Methodist Council, as well as the World Communion of Reformed Churches; as a constituent member of the Anglican Communion its bishops participate in the Lambeth Conferences. It also has representation in the Anglican Consultative Council. Consequently, the CSI is in full communion with the Old Catholic Churches of the Union of Utrecht and the Philippine Independent Catholic Church. It is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, Christian Conference of Asia and the National Council of Churches in India. Through the Communion of Churches in India, it is also in partnership and full communion with the Church of North India and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church.

The Church of South India maintains close partnerships with the Church of Scotland, Episcopal Church of the United States, Methodist Church of Great Britain, Presbyterian Church in Korea, Presbyterian Church in the Republic of Korea, Presbyterian Church of India, Presbyterian Church (USA), Reformed Church in America, United Church of Christ and the Uniting Church in Australia.

==Administration==
The church accepts the Lambeth Quadrilateral as its basis and recognises the historical episcopate in its constitutional form. Like Anglican and most other episcopal Churches, the ministry of the Church of South India is structured with three holy orders of Bishops, Priests and Deacons.

==Synod==

The church is governed by a synod based in Chennai and headed by a presiding bishop bearing the title of Moderator, who is elected every three years. Due to the Madras High Court&#x27;s ruling, which invalidated the recent elections and identified procedural discrepancies at the Synod meeting held in Hubli in January 2023. The Moderator and the Deputy Moderator position along with the position of General Secretary and Hon. Treasurer is currently vacant and awaiting election. The officers were elected for a three-year term at the Synod meeting. The church is presently under the administration of court-appointed administrators, Justice R. Balasubramanian and Justice V. Bharathidasan, pending new elections for these key leadership roles.

The church runs 2,300 schools, 150 colleges and 104 hospitals in South India. In the 1960s the church became conscious of its social responsibility and started organising rural development projects. There are 50 such projects all over India, 50 training centres for young people and 600 residential hostels for a total of 50,000 children.

==Dioceses==
The church is further divided into twenty-four dioceses, each under the supervision of a bishop, including one diocese encompassing Jaffna, Sri Lanka. The dioceses are governed by diocesan councils composed of all clergy in the diocese as well as lay people elected from the local congregations. Each church will have representation in diocesan council based on their membership. The diocese is headed by the Bishop, who is a presbyter elected through the Diocesan Council. He is considered as the head of the diocese and all the institutions belonging to the diocese. Other than the Bishop, the following are the important administrative posts of each diocese:
*Clergy Secretary: Manages all the activities of the pastoral &amp; evangelical workers in the diocese
*Lay Secretary: Manages all the lay workers&#x27; activities in the diocese
*Educational Secretary: Manages all educational institutions and the workers of those institutions
*Diocesan Treasurer: Manages all the income and expenditures of the diocese.
The Diocesan Council also consists of Diocesan Executive Committee, Diocesan Standing Committee, and Pastorate Committee.

<text>PC Zone, founded in 1993, was the first magazine dedicated to games for IBM-compatible personal computers to be published in the United Kingdom. Earlier PC magazines such as &quot;PC Leisure&quot;, &quot;PC Format&quot; and &quot;PC Plus&quot; had covered games but only as part of a wider remit. The precursor to &quot;PC Zone&quot; was the award-winning multiformat title &quot;Zero&quot;.

The magazine was published by Dennis Publishing Ltd. until 2004, when it was acquired by Future plc along with &quot;Computer And Video Games&quot; for £2.5m.

In July 2010, it was announced by Future plc that &quot;PC Zone&quot; was to close. The last issue of &quot;PC Zone&quot; went on sale 2 September 2010.

==First issue==
&quot;PC Zone&quot; was first published by Dennis Publishing in April 1993 and cost £3.95. Billed as the first UK magazine dedicated exclusively to PC games, it was sold with two accompanying floppy disks carrying game demonstrations. The first editor was Paul Lakin.

The magazine was split into four sections: Reviews, Blueprints, Features, and Regulars. Among the first titles to be reviewed were &quot;Dune II&quot;, &quot;Lemmings 2,&quot; and &quot;Stunt Island&quot;. The Blueprints section involved previews of new games and Features consisted of an article written about a specific area of gaming interest, such as gaming audio.

Regulars included a news bulletin, competitions and a Buyer&#x27;s Guide which featured recommended games.

==Evolution==
In its original incarnation, &quot;PC Zone&quot; recognised that its audience consisted largely of males in their late twenties and older, and adopted a tone suited to that audience. This was in contrast to contemporary multiformat and console magazines aimed at children and teenagers. During this period, the PC was not yet widely recognised as a games platform in the UK, an attitude PC Zone arguably helped to change by championing a succession of notable games such as &quot;Star Control II&quot;, &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot;, &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;.

By 1995, under the initial editorship of John Davison and then later Jeremy Wells (promoted from deputy editor with Davison moving on as publisher for the title), the magazine adopted a tone which heavily referenced lad culture, which had been made fashionable by magazines such as &quot;FHM, Loaded&quot; and Dennis Publishing stablemate &quot;Maxim&quot;. This period was marked by several moderately controversial episodes, including the accidental inclusion of a pornographic &quot;Doom&quot; modification on a cover-mounted CD-ROM, an article about the infamously bug-ridden Frontier 2: First Encounters illustrated with a large photograph of a piece of excrement wrapped with a bow, a joystick group test which featured a model dressed as a nun (testing each joystick for “phallusicity”), and a one-page comic by regular contributor Charlie Brooker, graphically depicting animal cruelty (originally intended as a comment on the violence against animals frequently portrayed in the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; games) which resulted in the offending issue being withdrawn from W H Smith newsagents.

Towards the end of the decade, during the editorship of long time contributor Chris Anderson, the magazine underwent another redesign and a stricter scoring methodology was introduced. For a twelve-month period, it was rare for a game to score above 90%, although this was later relaxed, resulting in controversial 94% and higher scores for &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, &quot;Unreal II&quot; and others. It was around this time that the magazine retired the long-running Mr Cursor column, a series of humorous, quasi-autobiographical anecdotes written by a thinly-disguised Duncan MacDonald, originally intended to be a counterpoint to the jargon-heavy nature of much of the rest of the editorial.

Anderson was succeeded by Dave Woods. Most of the regular recurring features used in the current version of the magazine were introduced during this period, and Woods&#x27; final contribution was the redesign which marked the handover of the title to Future plc and the editorship to Jamie Sefton.

==DVD Zone==
Each issue of PC Zone came with a DVD-ROM containing game demos, videos, mods, drivers, freeware software and patches among other things. The DVD Zone sleeve would occasionally have unique codes which gave readers access to game betas, trials, and in-game content, among other things.

==Later format==
A new format of &quot;PC Zone&quot; was introduced in October 2005 for issue #159. By issue #220, the magazine cost £5.99 and included several regular features including Supertest, where reviewers discussed which game is best in its genre (later audio only); Steve Hill&#x27;s NeverQuest, which followed the often unsuccessful attempts of Hill&#x27;s venture into MMORPGs; Developer&#x27;s Commentary, in which developers looked back on their recently released titles; Retro Zone, with a focus on a different retro platform emulated on PC each month; How To..., a guide with 8 tips for a recently released game and a Buyer&#x27;s Guide, in which top games were listed, divided into 9 genres. The Buyer&#x27;s Guide was developed from an indexed list of every game reviewed in the publication, along with closing comments. When the longevity of the magazine made this completely impractical it was pared down to just the best from each genre, becoming shorter with each redesign.

As of issue #220, the leaders in each genre are:

* Shooters: &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; &quot;(inc. Episodes)&quot; : 97% / 91% / 82%
* Strategy: &quot;&quot; : 94%
* Action/Adventure: &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; : 91%
* MMOs: &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; : 95%
* Sport: &quot;Football Manager 2010&quot; : 88%
* Simulation: &quot;X3: Reunion&quot; : 92%
* RPGs: &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot; : 95%
* Driving/Racing: &quot;GTR 2&quot; : 92%
* Oddball: &quot;Spore&quot; : 95%

The oldest game in the Buyer&#x27;s Guide was &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, reviewed issue #93 and given 94%.

==Review system==
&quot;PC Zone&quot; prided itself on its reviews scoring system, which was based on the idea that 50% was an average grade. As a result, many publishers accused the magazine of being too harsh. Games that scored 75-89% were given a &quot;Recommended Award&quot;; games that scored 90% or more were given a &quot;Classic Award&quot;. Very few games, perhaps only ten a year, received the latter distinction. Games scoring under 20% were given the &quot;PC Zone Dump&quot; award (Previously the &quot;PC Zone Pants&quot;).

As a combined result of its honest scoring system and its age, &quot;PC Zone&quot; managed to acquire many UK and world print exclusives in terms of news, previews and reviews. &quot;PC Zone&quot; contained world exclusive previews for &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, &quot;Doom 3&quot;, and &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, the first of which achieved a near-record score of 97%, a ranking it shared with three other games: &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;Alone in the Dark 2&quot;, and the relatively unknown flight simulator &quot;EF2000&quot;.

The lowest scoring game ever was &quot;Big Brother: The Game&quot; in 2000. It garnered a score of 1%, summarized with &quot;Truly woeful, and the fact that Infogrames hasn&#x27;t stuck the game in a box and is only collecting a tenner shows how embarrassed [they are] by this unmitigated piece of trash.&quot; The lowest scoring non-game release was &quot;Page 3 Calendar &amp; Screensaver&quot; in 1996, which managed to score in the negatives at -10%.

==Staff==
The last editor was Steve Hogarty, who left in July 2010, and was not replaced. He took over from Ali Wood, who left in December 2009. Previous editor Will Porter replaced Jamie Sefton in March 2008, who in turn was the replacement for Dave Woods after the magazine&#x27;s redesign at the end of 2005. Steve Spence edited the hardware section until it was taken over by Philip Wand (who also wrote Dear Wandy, a monthly section featuring technical questions from readers which started out as Dear Wazza under Warren Christmas) at the end of 2004. There were discussion forums on the official &quot;PC Zone&quot; website, as well as on Philip Wand&#x27;s own &quot;Dear Wandy&quot; site. There, members could request technical assistance and discuss gaming in general.

Pavel Barter contributed a regular investigative feature titled &quot;Special Report&quot;, which focused on various aspects of the games industry at large, as well as notable gaming figures and the specifics of the development process.

Dan Marshall contributed a regular column titled &quot;How to Make a Game&quot; which detailed the development of his first game, Gibbage. Gibbage then received the “Indiezone Game of the Month” award with 71% when it was reviewed. Marshall left, but wrote freelance reviews for the magazine.

Other regular freelance writers included Jon &#x27;Log&#x27; Blyth, Ed Zitron, Steve Hill, Martin Korda, Rhianna Pratchett, Richie Shoemaker, Daniel Emery, Paul Presley and David McCandless.

TV presenter and newspaper contributor Charlie Brooker was also a regular during the 1990s, reviewing games, and contributing humorous pieces such as “Sick Notes” and the “Cybertwats”.
