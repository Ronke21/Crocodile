<text>Port Chalmers () is a town serving as the main port of the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Port Chalmers lies ten kilometres inside Otago Harbour, some 15 kilometres northeast of Dunedin&#x27;s city centre.

== History ==

=== Early Māori settlement ===
The original Māori name for Port Chalmers was or , which may have indicated the hill where the , or altar, was sited. is a later name meaning ‘full tide’ and refers to an incident in which a group of warriors decided to spend the night in a cave that once existed at what was later known as Boiler Point and pulled their canoes well above the high tide mark. Overnight the tide rose and beached canoes were set adrift. As some of them swam out to reclaim the canoes those onshore cried out “Koputai!, Koputai!”

When a peace was made between Kāti Māmoe and Kāi Tahu, about 1780, Koputai was one of two southern terminuses of Kāi Tahu territory. The chiefs Karetai, Te Matenga Taiaroa and Tūhawaiki and other Māori frequented Koputai.

By February 1839, the Weller brothers of Otago (modern Otakou) had set up a saw pit on the opposite side of the harbour, which appears to have been at Sawyers Bay. By September the following year a &#x27;big boat&#x27;, supposedly the schooner &quot;Anne&quot; was apparently under construction there. In 1840, Port Chalmers and the whole western shore of Otago Harbour (from about Burkes to Otafelo Point) was included in Te Matenga Taiaroa&#x27;s sale of land to the French whalers Pierre Darmandarits and Edouard DuBern, brothers-in-law and business partners.

The first Christian service at Koputai was held by the Reverend James Watkin, the Wesleyan missionary at Waikouaiti, in 1842. Taiaroa&#x27;s cousin, the chief Kohi, was the leader of the last known at Koputai. That year Kohi fell ill, and thinking himself at the point of death, feared that his young son Timoko, would never have any benefit from a sealing boat in which he had a share. He therefore instructed his servants, Kurukuru and Rau-o-te-uri, to burn the boat where it lay on the beach at Koputai. To appease the other partners in the boat who were outraged upon hearing what he had done Kohi after consulting his wife Piro, consented at Otaheiti to be strangled as punishment. Taiaroa was given the task but upon observing his hand trembling as he was tying the knot Kohi exclaimed: &quot;Kahore kia mataa a Taiaroa ki te mea o te taura&quot; (Taiaroa does not know how to tie a knot). Kopi then took the rope, tied a slip-knot, and adjusted the rope about his own neck before Taiaroa pulled upon the rope tight, until he was dead. Kohi was buried at Koputai. By 1844 Koputai was deserted.

=== Arrival of the Europeans ===
In 1844 the schooner &quot;Deborah&quot; under the command of Captain Thomas Wing was chartered by Frederick Tuckett of the New Zealand Company to assist him in choosing a site for the projected New Edinburgh settlement. After sailing for the South on 31 March 1844 Tuckett left the ship at Moeraki on 23 April and made his way south by land in order to gaining a better appreciation of the land. The &quot;Deborah&quot; continued south independently and anchored near Koputai in the bay now bearing its name, and where the hulk of the vessel remains. It wasn&#x27;t until 26 April that Tuckett rendezvoused with the ship. Tuckett explored the harbour and its environs, which he how considered more suitable for the purposed settlement than any site he had yet seen. He departed at the end of April to explore the inland countryside, before returning to Koputai on 11 June. By this date there was established at Koputai a makeshift jetty, two whares (Māori-style houses) and some tents. Mr. and Mrs. Lethbridge were in residence, David Scott and several others. As a result of his investigations Tuckett selected an adjoining block of land (the Otago Block) as the site for the Scottish New Edinburgh settlement and nominated Koputai as its deep-water port. The &quot;Deborah&quot; departed on 23 June leaving behind Tuckett, who was living in a small three-bedroom cottage made of loose bricks that he had built on the beach. On 15 July 1844 William Wakefield of the New Zealand Company visited accompanied by John Jermyn Symonds (representing the government) and George Clark.

The sale of the Otago Block from Māori to the Otago Association was concluded at Koputai on 31 July 1844. In December 1844 Tuckett left and returned to England, with William Davidson taking over his cottage and position as the New Zealand Company&#x27;s local representative. In that same month Alexander and Janet McKay arrived with plans to establish a public house, to service the needs of the proposed settlement. It eventually opened as the &#x27;Surveyors&#x27; Arms&#x27; on what is now Beach Street and was licensed by Akaroa-based magistrate John Watson in 1846. On 23 February 1846 the ship &quot;Mary Catherine&quot; anchored at Koputai. On board was Charles Kettle the surveyor to the New Zealand Company together with his wife and a staff of six assistant surveyors and 25 labourers, whose task was to survey the land that had been purchased from the Māori. kettle and his wife took up residence in Tuckett&#x27;s cottage. The survey of the town was completed in May 1846.


At first the European settlers intended to christen the settlement ‘New Leith’ or ‘New Musselburgh’, as they disliked the Māori name of Koputai; but the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland (later known as the Otago Association), desired that the port might be named after Thomas Chalmers, the leader of the Free Church movement in Scotland and this suggestion was adopted.

The first organised European settlers arrived in Otago Harbour on the &quot;John Wickliffe&quot;, which moored off what was now Port Chalmers on 23 March 1848. Captain Cargill who was the agent for the New Zealand Company and a small party went in the ship&#x27;s boat to the head of the harbor, while the other passengers went ashore in parties to explore the land around Port Chalmers. The second ship, the &quot;Philip Laing&quot; arrived on 15 April 1848 to find a settlement surrounded by dense bush to the water&#x27;s edge except for a small clearing behind the centre of the beach and consisting of the New Zealand Company&#x27;s store, Tuckett&#x27;s former cottage and three whare (Māori huts). At the time Port Chalmers had 400 potential sections available compared with Dunedin&#x27;s 2,000.
The arrival of organised European settlement eventually led to the town superseding the earlier Otakou as the harbour&#x27;s international port. By 1849 the population had reached 38 and by January 1854 the population had reached 80, but was still less than 130 by 1861. 
In 1854 the 220 ton &quot;Nelson&quot; was the first steamer to visit the port. As Otago harbour was too shallow for large ships to reach Dunedin. Ships initially used to anchor in the stream, and the cargo was transshipped to lighters, which were towed by tugs to Dunedin at the head of the harbor. There was also a connection by steep road from North East Valley to Sawyers Bay, a spur of the main road north. 

On 31 May 1855 the customhouse was robbed, and a chest, containing about £1,400, was carried away, but was afterwards recovered from the harbour, where the thieves had thrown it on some rocks upon finding that they were unable to open it before daylight exposed them to potential capture.

By the 1860s a road along the side of the harbour between Dunedin and Port Chalmers had been built, which allowed ships to dock at Port Chalmers, with goods then transported to and from Dunedin by road. The Bowen pier was built in 1873, followed by the Export pier, and, later, the George Street pier.
In 1862 Dunedin and Port Chalmers were connected by a telegraph line.
A small community of workers sprang to service the docks. In spite of all this, the port was probably viewed as a temporary solution and an inconvenience, as a round trip to Dunedin took three to four hours by horse and wagon. There was also the option of a sea connection by two paddle steamers, the &quot;Golden Age&quot; (from 1863 onwards) and the &quot;Peninsula&quot;.

The discovery of gold by Gabriel Read in 1861 lead to the Otago gold rush which over a three month period saw 16,000 new arrivals pass through the port. This totally transformed Port Chalmers as businesses sprung up to service both the increasing number of ships and their passengers. Despite the development the streets were still unpaved and muddy following any heavy rain.
This dramatic increase in trade meant that by 1864, Port Chalmers had grown to be the third largest port in Australasia. with a population of at least a 1,000, with five hotels, three restaurants, six general stores, two chemists, two bakeries, two barbers, two blacksmiths, two churches, two schools, and a Masonic Hall (which functioned during the week as a courthouse).

On 18 June 1865 a large fire consumed an entire block of building at the corner of George and Grey Streets, destroying a number of buildings. The fire was put out by local citizens and the Naval Brigade. Despite the damage caused it wasn&#x27;t until 1876 that a volunteer fire brigade was organised.

===Railway connection===
In the early 1870s construction began on the Port Chalmers Branch railway line linking Dunedin and Port Chalmers. Originally the contractors intended for the tracks to pass down George Street to the port, but following objections from the Town Board it was conveyed via a cutting and a tunnel to emerge on Beach Street before terminating on a new wharf. Soil excavated from the tunnel was used for the reclamation of land for the new wharf on which the railway line terminated. When the railway line opened on 1 January 1873 it was the first 1,067 mm narrow gauge railway in New Zealand. The opening of this line bought to an end the lightering service between Port Chalmers and Dunedin. The branch line was subsequently incorporated into the national rail network through a connection at Sawyers Bay to the Main South Line, which was opened through to Christchurch on 7 September 1878 and Invercargill on 22 January 1879. As the Main South Line passed along the hillside above Port Chalmers a railway station locally called the “Upper Station” was built to service passengers. The terminus of the branch line on the wharf continued to service freight and was known as the “Lower Station”. 
Since roads on Otago Peninsula were non-existent, boats were used to cross the harbour. The first dedicated ferry service was introduced on the harbor in 1859 but it was not profitable. As the region&#x27;s rapidly increased due to the Gold Rush scheduled ferry services began between Port Chalmers and Portobello and ran from 1876 to 1954.
The development of the town reflected the growth of Dunedin and Otago with rivalry between the city and Port Chalmers over which would handle the bulk of shipping. The establishment of a floating dock and later a graving dock in the 1870s lead to Port Chalmers emerging as a significant ship repair centre.

=== Dredging of the Victoria ship channel ===
As Dunedin grew, and particularly with the increase in commerce that developed following the Otago gold rush of the 1860s, the merchants of Dunedin pushed for dredging of a channel to allow ocean-going vessels to reach the city&#x27;s wharves. Though a contentious decision, it was agreed to dredge what became known as the Victoria Ship Channel along the north-western side of the harbor. The channel was finally opened in 1881. The initial channel was narrow and shallow, and did not get off to an auspicious start, as the Union Steam Ship Company&#x27;s SS &quot;Penguin&quot;, the first ship to use it, was temporarily grounded while using it. As finance allowed, the channel was gradually widened and deepened, and by 1907, twice as many ships were using Dunedin&#x27;s wharves as used Port Chalmers. Compensating to some degree for the opening of the Victoria Ship Channel ship servicing and building industries developed in Port Chalmers while the adjacent Carey&#x27;s Bay became a fishing port. 
The year 1882 saw the inauguration of New Zealand&#x27;s refrigerated meat trade when the ship &quot;Dunedin&quot; left Port Chalmers with the first such cargo.

David Alexander De Maus (1847–1925) operated a photography business in Port Chalmers and was known for his maritime photographs. In 1893 he was the first person in New Zealand to be prosecuted for selling an indecent photo (of a woman). It was possibly a reprint of a French academic study for artists that was legal in France. This conviction didn&#x27;t stop him from being elected mayor of Port Chambers four times between 1899 and 1913.

===Servicing Antarctic exploration===
In November 1894 the port was host to the &quot;Antarctic&quot;, a Norwegian whaling and sealing ship soon to be credited with the first substantiated landing on the Antarctic continent. While docked in Port Chalmers for repairs and restocking, several of her crew refused to continue with the voyage, and four New Zealanders were recruited several days later at Stewart Island. 
During the heroic era of Antarctic exploration the Otago Harbour Board sought to attract subsequent explorers, extending generous hospitality by way of coal, food, and complimentary use of the harbour facilities. This dangled carrot drew Robert Falcon Scott, who visited with both the Discovery in December 1901 and his final doomed Terra Nova expedition to Antarctica in November 1910. It attracted Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s Nimrod and Endurance expeditions. In 1916 Shackleton&#x27;s damaged ship the Aurora was towed to Port Chalmers, repaired in Port and then returned to Antarctica. American Richard E. Byrd used Port Chalmers as the base for his Antarctic operations in 1928, Lincoln Ellsworth did likewise in 1933, and so did a number of other American, French and New Zealand explorers over the coming decades. 
In 1903 the temperance movement was successful in prohibiting the selling of alcohol in the Port Chalmers electorate. Hotels in the town banded together, taking their case as far as the Privy Council, in London, before winning back their licences in May 1905.

By 1905 the town had a population of over 2,000 and was home to two railway stations two banks, a dairy factory, gas works, two cemeteries, a recreation reserve, two fire stations, a brass band, salt water bath, and a Mechanics&#x27; Institute. Education was provided by a District High School, a Roman Catholic school, a Technical School, and several private kindergartens. The town was protected by a company of the Permanent Artillery, and the Garrison Artillery Volunteers. In 1906 when it was found that only 28 boys and one girl could swim out of a roll of 432 pupils at the local school could swim, swimming lessons were added to the curriculum and held in the partially-filled graving dock.
A road tunnel linking Sawyers Bay with Waitati as part of a new north motorway from Dunedin was proposed in the 1930s but never built. 
By 1961 the town had a population of 3,120.

A new faster, harbourside road from the city was completed in 1965. The selection of Port Chalmers as the South Island&#x27;s first container terminal in 1971 re-established Port Chalmers as the South Island&#x27;s major commercial port to – much the dismay of the locals, who had enjoyed several generations of bohemian tranquility by this point. 
In 1979, passenger trains between Port Chalmers and Dunedin ceased after 106 years of operation. All the buildings at the Upper Station were subsequently removed.
The container traffic continued to expand and while a new expanding trade in timber developed in parallel but the greatly reduced labour needs of these trades saw the town&#x27;s population contract.
Controversial attempts to site an aluminium smelter at Aramoana at the mouth of the harbour in 1975 and 1980 didn&#x27;t succeed. 
From the 1970s an artists&#x27; colony grew up in Port Chalmers and Carey&#x27;s Bay contributing to tensions over the port&#x27;s continuing industrial development and giving a different flavour to the town. 
In 1987 the Port Chalmers Old Identities Society&#x27;s collection was transferred to the old Post Office building and reopened as the Port Chalmers Museum. This has since been renamed the Regional Maritime Museum.

Although the Victoria Channel has been gradually widened, and kept dredged to a depth of , modern cruise ships and container vessels are so big that they often draw in excess of the depth restriction while the narrowness of the channel means must be piloted along it by tugs. As a result being closer to the open sea as well as its easier berthing makes Port Chalmers the preferred port of call. In the 2018–2019 financial year 208,600 containers were handled by the port while 1.15 million tonnes of logs were exported between the Dunedin and Port Chalmers wharves.
The high Flagstaff Hill has a long history of slipping, and had suffered significant slumping during a storm in 1999. In June 2019 a $2.9 million project was begun by Port Otago to stabilize the east and north-east sides of Flagstaff Hill and return Beach Street to its original position. A series of terraces is being created and approximately 45,000m³ of excess rock and sediment is to be removed.

== Geography ==
Much of Port Chalmers is located on a small hilly peninsula, at the northern end of which is a large reclaimed area which is now the site of Dunedin&#x27;s container port. Close to the southeastern shore of this peninsula are a pair of islands, which lie across the harbour between Port Chalmers and the Otago Peninsula. These two islands are Quarantine Island/Kamau Taurua and Goat Island / Rakiriri. Prior to the local body reorganization in the 1980s Port Chalmers was made up of several suburbs, as well as the central area, Roseneath, Blanket Bay, Upper Junction, Brick Hill, Sawyers Bay, Mussel Bay, Upper Port Chalmers, Dalkeith, Careys Bay, Reynoldstown, Deborah Bay, Hamilton Bay, Waipuna Bay, Te Ngaru, and Aramoana, as well as the outlying townships of Long Beach, Pūrākanui and several other smaller nearby villages and farmsteads.
Many of the streets of Port Chalmers are named after the first immigrant vessels; hence Wickliffe, Laing, Victory, Bernicia, Mary and Ajax Streets. Scotia Street is named after early settler John Jones&#x27; favourite schooner. Burns Street is named after the Rev. Thomas Burns. Currie Street bears the name of Alexander Currie, a director of the New Zealand Company, while George and Grey Streets, bear the name of an early Governor of New Zealand, Sir George Grey. Harrington Street (while misspelt) is named after Thomas Cudbert Harington the first secretary of the New Zealand Company. Campbell Buchanan Lane commemorates a young Port Chalmers sailor who died in action in the Solomon Islands in January 1943.


=== Climate ===
The climate of Port Chalmers in general is temperate; Under the Köppen climate classification, it is classified as oceanic climate. The average temperature is . and has relatively low rainfall in comparison to many of New Zealand&#x27;s other towns, with only some recorded per year.

== Demographics ==
Port Chalmers covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Port Chalmers had a population of 1,407 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 12 people (−0.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 27 people (2.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 630 households, comprising 690 males and 717 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female. The median age was 45.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 249 people (17.7%) aged under 15 years, 177 (12.6%) aged 15 to 29, 711 (50.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 270 (19.2%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 93.8% European/Pākehā, 12.2% Māori, 1.7% Pasifika, 2.6% Asian, and 2.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 17.9, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 65.9% had no religion, 22.4% were Christian, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.4% were Buddhist and 1.9% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 369 (31.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 216 (18.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $29,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 177 people (15.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 540 (46.6%) people were employed full-time, 189 (16.3%) were part-time, and 54 (4.7%) were unemployed.

== Economy ==
=== Creative arts ===
The creative arts are still important to the area&#x27;s economy; Port Chalmers and the surrounding suburbs of Careys Bay, Deborah Bay, Roseneath and Sawyers Bay have a thriving arts community of painters, potters, musicians, jewelers, sculptors and writers.

===Tourism===
From the 1990s onwards cruise ships began calling at Otago Harbour, a trend that continues to expand with 153,000 disembarking of the 229,000 passengers bought on 115 vessels (104 into Port Chalmers) during the 2018–2019 season.

=== Manufacturing / Industry ===
=== Port ===
The Customs Department was initially responsible for control of Otago Harbour with the Collector of Customs acting as harbor master, until 1859 when the Provincial Council took responsibility and appointed a dedicated harbor master. 
To service the hulls of the increasing number of ships calling at the port a long by wide by deep wooden floating dock called the &quot;Alpha&quot; was built and launched in 1868 at Port Chalmers W. Murray and Co., under a 5-year guarantee from the Provincial Government.
The Otago Harbour Board was established on 30 June 1874 and took over responsibility for the harbour and the provision of facilities, the wharves at Port Chalmers were managed by the Railways Department until 1928.
Construction of a long graving dock was commenced by the Otago Dock Trust in July 1868. The commissioning of the graving dock in March 1872 (which had cost £56,069 2s 11d) and the increasing size of ships resulted in reduced demand for the floating dock which was finally beached at Carey&#x27;s Bay. The remains of the dock are still visible as late as the 1940s.

Owing to the need to accommodate increasingly larger vessels a new graving dock was constructed by the Otago Dock Trust between 1905 and 1909 at a cost of £74,475. It was long which allowed it to take vessels up to in length. Once the dock was completed the Otago Dock Trust merged with the Otago Harbour Board on 21 May 1910.
In April 1928 the long Norwegian whaling ship, &quot;C.A. Larsen&quot; became the largest vessel serviced by the graving dock up until that time. Following its taking over operation of the wharves from the Railway Department the Otago Harbour Board moved its headquarters to Port Chalmers in 1929.
The first all-container ship to visit New Zealand was the &quot;Columbus New Zealand&quot;, which berthed at Beach Street Wharf on 26 June 1971, before the container terminal had been built. It used its own on-board crane whose arm folded out to land or pick up containers from the wharf.
The redevelopment lead to the closing in 1975 and filling in of the graving dock while the wharves were replaced by two berths – the later multi-purpose berth is to the right – and a heavy-duty paved space for storing, washing and devanning (unpacking) containers.
In 1988 the Otago Harbour Board was replaced by a quasi-autonomous local government entity, Port Otago Ltd.

The port currently has three berths suitable for handling containerized, multi-purpose, and conventional vessels; Beach St, the container berth and the multi-purpose three berths. The swinging basin is dredged to , with a turning diameter of .
A $23 million long extension to the existing multi-purpose berth which increased its total length to was completed in 2019.

==== Quarrying ====
A quarry known as the “Big Quarry” was opened on Church Street in March 1866 and operated until it closed in the 1920. This supplied Port Chalmers brecia locally known as bluestone which was used in the foundations of the Dunedin Railway Station, the Otago Boys’ High School, the University of Otago Clocktower, Dunedin Town Hall and in the Port Chalmers Graving Dock and to construct many other buildings in the area. The site is now home to the Lady Thorn Rhododendron Dell.

==== Ship building ====
Beginning with the construction of the 13-ton schooner &quot;Sarah&quot; which was launched in 1859 shipbuilding became an important activity at Port Chalmers. Notable following vessels were the 70-ton steamer &quot;Taiaroa&quot; (1865), the 50-ton schooner &quot;Maid of Otago&quot; (1870), the 70-ton schooner &quot;Friendship&quot; (1871) and the 70-ton schooner &quot;Mary Ogilvie&quot; (1873). In 1861 William Isbister constructed at Carey&#x27;s Bay the first patent slip of its kind in New Zealand. He soon built a second slip and on them carried out ship repairs and built a number of small vessels, among them the paddle steamer &quot;Tuapeka&quot; (1863), 28-ton schooner &quot;Cymraes&quot; (1864) and the dredge &quot;New Era&quot; (1867). Other shipbuilders based at Port Chalmers were Sutherland &amp; McKay, Knewstubb Brothers (from the late 1880s until 1905), Miller Bros, Miller &amp; Tunnage and Morgan &amp; Cable. Morgan &amp; Cable later changed its name first to the Maori Iron Works and later in 1906 to Stevenson &amp; Cook which during the Second World War built seven Castle class minesweepers at Boiler Point for service with Royal New Zealand Navy. Boiler Point took its name from an abandoned ship&#x27;s boiler. After the war the company built the penstocks for the Roxburgh Power Station, before eventually closing in 1958, due to a diminishing workload. The company&#x27;s facilities were taken over by Sims Engineering Ltd who built tugs and in 1984 launched the 1,056-ton dredge &quot;New Era&quot;, as of 2006 the largest powered vessel built in New Zealand. Sims closed in about 1990.

==== Ship repair ====
The construction of the floating dock and then the graving dock allowed the port to establish itself as a centre of ship repair. The Union Steam Ship Company was established in Dunedin in 1875 and in the same year established a workshop at Port Chalmers to repair both its own and other companies’ ships. The company purchased the hulk of the barque ‘’Don Juan’’ in 1878 and moored it between the Bowen and George Street piers where it was used as a carpenters’ workshop and sailmakers loft. As demand for the workshop&#x27;s services increased in 1889 the company moved its workshops and sailmakers loft to an existing three-storey building before in 1897 the company constructed a new much bigger building on reclaimed land with further expansion in the following year. Up until 1920 Port Chalmers was the company&#x27;s main repair facility until in that year the company moved its headquarters to Wellington followed by the establishment of its main repair centre in that city. The facilities at Port Chalmers declined in importance until they finally closed in 1975.
Between 1920 and 1930 a large number of the Norwegian whaling vessels based at Stewart Island were refurbished by the workshops of the Union Stream Ship Company. The Second World War was a particularly busy period due to repairs being required on vessels damaged by the enemy.

== Governance ==
Until 1853 public works were undertaken by the Governor of New Zealand and from thereafter by the Provincial Government, but little was spent on local development. In 1855 the town obtained a directly elected representative on the Provincial Government when the council was restructured into eight electable districts of which the town was one. The town obtained its first directly elected local governance when a nine member Town Board was formed in 1860 following the passing of the Port Chalmers and Invercargill Town Board ordinance in 1859.

On 9 April 1866 the town became a municipality and then a borough in 1884. The first mayor of the borough was Daniel Rolfe. By 1905 the borough was divided into four wards—High, East, Middle and South.

Sir John Thorn (1911–2008) was mayor of Port Chalmers from 1956 for 33 years consecutive years until the borough of Port Chalmers and the whole surrounding district was dissolved and amalgamated into enlarged City of Dunedin in 1989. His service made him the longest serving mayor of New Zealand (as of 2016).
Today Port Chalmers elects councillors to the Dunedin City Council as part of the Waikouaiti-Chalmers Ward, and is served by a local Community Board, the Chalmers Community Board.

=== List of mayors ===
Between 1878 and 1982, Port Chalmers had at least 23 mayors. The following is an almost complete list:

== Culture ==

The creative arts are important to the area&#x27;s economy; Port Chalmers and the surrounding suburbs of Careys Bay, Deborah Bay, Roseneath and Sawyers Bay have a thriving arts community, and the town is base for those living an alternative lifestyle. 
Various artists and musicians have lived in Port Chalmers, most notably late Māori artist Ralph Hotere. Hotere&#x27;s former studio was on land at the tip of Observation Point, the large bluff overlooking the container terminal. When the port&#x27;s facilities were expanded, part of the bluff was removed, including the area of Hotere&#x27;s studio, despite strenuous objection from many of the town&#x27;s residents. Part of the bluff close to the removed portion is now a sculpture garden, organised in 2005 by Hotere and featuring works by both him and by other New Zealand modern sculptors.

=== Events ===
The biannual Seafood Festival takes place in September.

== Attractions / amenities ==

=== Churches ===
* Iona Church
* Holy Trinity Church
*St Mary, Star of the Sea Roman Catholic Church. Designed by Frank William Petrie this church held its first mass on 12 May 1878. Owing to a shortage of funds the planned spire was not built. Later the original stone facade was plastered over.

=== Historic buildings and equipment===
*Municipal Building (Town Hall). The foundation stone was laid on 3 November 1888, and the building opened on 25 September 1889. It was originally built to house the Port Chalmers Town Hall, as well as the Town Clerk&#x27;s office, the Fire Brigade, the Police Station (including the Sergeant&#x27;s residence and cells), Court Rooms, Customs Office and Government Shipping Office. There was also a morgue that occupied a backroom downstairs. By the 1950s most of the government departments had ceased to use their offices, and when the courthouse closed in 1952, the library moved in to the old courtroom (which is today the foyer). When the fire brigade moved to a new site, its part of the building was used by various community groups. A major redevelopment of the whole building was completed in 2004, with the library and service centre moving into the area previously occupied by the fire brigade.
*Time ball. This was established in 1867 on the flagpole on top of Observation Point to assist in maritime timekeeping. Removed in 1970, a replacement was installed in 2020.
*Tunnel Hotel. This establishment located at 22 Beach St claims to be the oldest hotel south of Nelson, and the oldest continually operated business in New Zealand. It stands on the site of the &#x27;Surveyors&#x27; Arms&#x27; which was opened by Alexander and Janet McKay sometime after their arrival in December 1844 and was licensed to sell alcohol by the Akaroa-based magistrate John Watson in 1846. It later changed its name to the Port Chalmers Hotel and finally to the Tunnel Hotel. The current building dates from 1875.

*Port Chalmers Maritime Museum is a small museum, occupying the former Post Office building (built in 1877) and classified as a Category 1 Historic Place by Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga (https://www.heritage.org.nz/list-details/359/Port%20Chalmer&#x27;s%20Post%20Office%20(Former)#details) The collection has been displayed in the present building since 1987, and has since been renamed the Regional Maritime Museum. In 2020 the building was leased to Port Otago for 35 years. and has been incorporated into their recently redeveloped Port Otago offices. The Museum collection is owned and operated by the Port Chalmers Historical Society Inc, formerly the Port Chalmers Early Settlers and Old Identities Association, founded in September 1913. 
=== Memorials ===
*Scott Expedition Memorial. Upon news of the death of Captain Scott and members of his party reaching New Zealand, the Port Chalmers Borough Council in March 1913 decided to erect a memorial cairn on Height Rock, overlooking the harbour. Paid for largely by public subscriptions the foundation stone was laid on 13 December 1913 and it was formally unveiled by Prime Minister W.F. Massey on 30 May 1914. The structure, designed by architect Robert Burnside, consists of a tall and gently tapering column of Port Chalmers bluestone, surmounted by an anchor. On the landward side is inset a marble tablet inscribed with (inter alia) the names of those who perished: Captain Robert Falcon Scott, Edward Adrian Wilson, Captain Lawrence E.G. Oates, Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers and Petty Officer Edgar Evans.

=== Parks and recreation ===
*Lady Thorn Rhododendron Dell. Following the closing of the “Big Quarry” on Church Street in 1920, it was then used in the 1950s as a tip where dunnage timber from visiting cargo ships was burnt. When this practice stopped in the 1960s it was used as rubbish dump and then became overgrown. Lady Constance Thorn ( -1997), a former long- time mayoress of the town, came up with the idea of turning the area into a dell of rhododendrons. The Port Chalmers and District Lions Club helped in 1998 to develop the garden, which they now maintain. A lookout accessed by stairs features a selection of old historic photographs of Port Chalmers over the years and also offers a view of the town and Otago Harbour.
*Hotere Garden Oputae. The former studio of noted artist Ralph Hotere (1931–2013) was on land at the tip of Observation Point, the large bluff overlooking the container terminal. When the port&#x27;s facilities were expanded in 1993, part of the bluff was removed, including the area containing Hotere&#x27;s studio (after strenuous objection from many of the town&#x27;s residents). Part of the bluff close to the removed portion are converted by the Hotere Foundation Trust with the assistance of the Otago Harbour Board into a sculpture garden in 2005 containing featuring works by both Hotere and by other noted New Zealand modern sculptors. The sculptures were previously displayed at Hotere&#x27;s studio and include: “Black Phoenix II” by Ralph Hotere, “Brick Column” by Russell Moses, “They do cut down the poles that hold up the sky” by Shona Rapira Davies and “Aramoana” by Chris Booth. In 2008 the garden by Design and Garden Landscapes Ltd won the Landscape Industries Association of NZ premier award for the best use of native plants, a gold award for landscape horticulture and a silver award for landscape design.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
State Highway 88 connects Port Chalmers to Dunedin. 
A public bus connection is provided to Dunedin by buses organised by the Otago Regional Council. Passenger rail services to Dunedin were previously available, until these were withdrawn in 1982 in favour of buses.

===Utilities===
In 1871, Thomson Brothers were given permission to construct a gasworks and a gas reticulation system. The gasworks was erected on Mount Street and by June 1872 the town was being lit by ten gas powered lamps with a gas supply to a number of houses soon following. In April 1888 the Port Chalmers Gas Company was formed and took over the gas system. They moved the gasworks to Mussel Bay and expanded the reticulation system. The Borough Council took over the system in 1918. From 1906 the wharves were lit by electricity but it wasn&#x27;t until 1914 that electricity began to be supplied to the rest of the town.

== Education ==
From the time of the first settlement there were a number of small private schools in Port Chalmers with some remaining in existence in one form or another until the end of the 19th century.

=== Public ===
Following the proclamation of Port Chalmers and outlying districts as an Education District, a public school opened on 20 October 1856 in a building shared with the Magistrates Court on the corner of Grey and Scotia Streets with pupils having to pay a fee. By 1859 the school had 36 pupils. In 1860 a dedicated school house was erected, by which time the roll had increased to 166. With the school continuing to expand both its number of school rooms and pupils it was designated as the Port Chalmers Grammar School in 1869. In 1872 the school had a staff of four teaching 238 pupils. In 1875 staff and 401 pupils moved to a new school building constructed on what had been previously the Police Camp Reserve. In 1879 the grammar school became the Port Chalmers District High School. In 1929 it reverted to being a primary school. Port Chalmers School had a roll of students as of 

=== Roman Catholic ===
In 1882 St Mary&#x27;s School was established and initially operated from a shed-like house. In 1898 Mother Mary MacKillop, and two Josephite Sisters, arrived into Dunedin on the request of the parish priest of Port Chalmers to assist with teaching. When they arrived they found the existing school house to be in a sad state of disrepair. As a result of Mackillop, her follow sisters and the community&#x27;s endeavours a new school, St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, was opened at the end of January 1898. MacKillop lived in Port Chalmers for two months and was the first Head of St Joseph&#x27;s in Port Chalmers, teaching the Upper Standards. The second St Joseph&#x27;s School building was opened in 1913 and was a two-story brick building that became a feature of the Port Chalmers landscape. The Sisters of St Joseph continued to run the school until 1979 before handing the role over to lay teachers. In 1987 the third St Joseph&#x27;s School was built and became a state-integrated, co-educational Catholic primary school. St Joseph&#x27;s School closed at the beginning of 2023.

== Media ==
Parts of 2016 drama &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot; starring Michael Fassbender, Alicia Vikander and Rachel Weisz was filmed here in 2014, notably the bookshop and haberdashery scenes. During shooting the main street was covered in gravel and thousands of people turned up each day hoping to catch a glimpse of the actors.

<text>Claude Rajotte (born July 3, 1955) is a well-known Canadian DJ/VJ/music critic from Montreal, Quebec.

==Life==
Rajotte was born in Drummondville, Quebec on July 3, 1955. His career started at the local radio station CHRD, in 1974. After short stints in Ottawa and Quebec, he settled in Montreal and started to work for CKOI-FM in 1976.

While being a DJ for CHOM-FM (1982–2002), he spoke English with a marked French Canadian accent that was liked by his radio audience. In the 1980s, Rajotte was in the habit of continually switching from English to French during his broadcasts. With his unmistakable accent, francophones connected immediately, however, that did not detract anglophone listeners, leading to complaints from CHOM&#x27;s main competitor at the time, the francophone radio station CKOI, Rajotte&#x27;s former employer. Canada&#x27;s broadcasting regulators, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), ruled that CHOM DJs were not allowed to speak in French on the air, despite the requirement that CHOM must broadcast a certain proportion of French language songs.

He was also a fixture for over 17 years (1987–2004) on MusiquePlus (the French counterpart to MuchMusic). He was a VJ and a much appreciated album critic. His review show called &quot;Le Cimetière des CD&quot; (&quot;The Cemetery of CD&quot;s) was on the air for ten consecutive years. Once a week during the show, Rajotte would hold a &quot;destroy&quot;, an event during which he would physically destroy a newly released album which he particularly disliked using unorthodox methods. He was also a regular host of the channel&#x27;s alternative video show, &quot;Nu Musik&quot; during the 1980s, and &quot;Rage&quot; during the 1990s (which was renamed &quot;The Claude Rajotte Show&quot;).

From 2004 to 2011, Rajotte hosted a late-night radio show on Radio-Canada&#x27;s Espace Musique. He was also a frequent contributor to Bande à part. In the summer of 2011, he quits Radio-Canada and returns to MusiquePlus. August 2014, his TV program &quot;Rajotte&quot; moves to Musimax until December 2015. He also hosted a weekly radio show for almost two years on CIBL-FM until December 2020. His most recent mixes are all on his Mixcloud page. https://www.mixcloud.com/DJ_Rajotte/

<doc id="1067614" wikidata="Q1195804" url="?curid=1067614" title="Hacksaw">
<text>A hacksaw is a fine-toothed saw, originally and mainly made for cutting metal. The equivalent saw for cutting wood is usually called a bow saw. 

Most hacksaws are hand saws with a C-shaped walking frame that holds a blade under tension. Such hacksaws have a handle, usually a pistol grip, with pins for attaching a narrow disposable blade. The frames may also be adjustable to accommodate blades of different sizes. A screw or other mechanism is used to put the thin blade under tension.

On hacksaws, as with most frame saws, the blade can be mounted with the teeth facing toward or away from the handle, resulting in cutting action on either the push or pull stroke. In normal use, cutting vertically downwards with work held in a bench vise, hacksaw blades are set to be facing forwards.

== History ==
While saws for cutting metal had been in use for many years, significant improvements in longevity and efficiency were made in the 1880s by Max Flower-Nash. George N. Clemson, a founder of Clemson Bros. Inc of Middletown, New York, United States, conducted tests which involved changing the dimensions, shapes of teeth, styles of set, and variable heat treatments of blades. Clemson claimed enormous improvements to the cutting ability of blades and built a major industrial operation manufacturing hacksaw blades sold under the trade name Star Hack Saw. In 1898, Clemson was granted US Patent 601947, which details various improvements in the hacksaw.

== Design ==
Standard hacksaw blade lengths are . Blades can be as small as . Powered hacksaws may use large blades in a range of sizes, or small machines may use the same hand blades.

The pitch of the teeth can be from fourteen to thirty-two teeth per inch (TPI) for a hand blade, with as few as three TPI for a large power hacksaw blade. The blade chosen is based on the thickness of the material being cut, with a minimum of three teeth in the material. As hacksaw teeth are so small, they are set in a &quot;wave&quot; set. As for other saws they are set from side to side to provide a or clearance when sawing, but the set of a hacksaw changes gradually from tooth to tooth in a smooth curve, rather than alternate teeth set left and right.

Hacksaw blades are normally quite brittle, so care needs to be taken to prevent brittle fracture of the blade. Early blades were of carbon steel, now termed &#x27;low alloy&#x27; blades, and were relatively soft and flexible. They avoided breakage, but also wore out rapidly. Except where cost is a particular concern, this type is now obsolete. &#x27;Low alloy&#x27; blades are still the only type available for the Junior hacksaw, which limits the usefulness of this otherwise popular saw.

For several decades now, hacksaw blades have used high speed steel for their teeth, giving greatly improved cutting and tooth life. These blades were first available in the &#x27;All-hard&#x27; form which cut accurately but were extremely brittle. This limited their practical use to benchwork on a workpiece that was firmly clamped in a vice. A softer form of high speed steel blade was also available, which wore well and resisted breakage, but was less stiff and so less accurate for precise sawing. Since the 1980s, bi-metal blades have been used to give the advantages of both forms, without risk of breakage. A strip of high speed steel along the tooth edge is electron beam welded to a softer spine. As the price of these has dropped to be comparable with the older blades, their use is now almost universal.

The most common blade is the 12 inch or 300 mm length. Hacksaw blades have a hole at each end for mounting them in the saw frame and the 12 inch / 300 mm dimension refers to the center to center distance between these mounting holes.

The kerf produced by the blades is somewhat wider than the blade thickness due to the set of the teeth. It commonly varies between 0.030 and 0.063 inches / 0.75 and 1.6 mm depending on the pitch and set of the teeth.

== Uses ==

Hacksaws were originally and principally made for cutting metal, but can also cut various other materials, such as plastic and wood; for example, plumbers and electricians often cut plastic pipe and plastic conduit with them, while surgeons can use unpowered saws as bonesaws.

== Variants ==

A &quot;panel hacksaw&quot; has a frame made of a deep, thin sheet aligned behind the blade&#x27;s kerf, so that the saw could cut into panels of sheet metal without the length of cut being restricted by the frame. The frame follows the blade down the kerf into the panel.

&quot;Junior hacksaws&quot; are a small version with a half-size blade. Like coping saws, the blade has pins that are held by notches in the frame. Although potentially a useful tool for a toolbox or in confined spaces, the quality of blades in the Junior size is restricted and they are only made in the simple low alloy steels, not HSS. This restricts their usefulness.

A &quot;power hacksaw&quot; (or &quot;electric hacksaw&quot;) is a type of hacksaw that is powered either by its own electric motor or connected to a stationary engine. Most power hacksaws are stationary machines but some portable models do exist; the latter (with frames) have been displaced to some extent by reciprocating saws such as the Sawzall, which accept blades with hacksaw teeth. Stationary models usually have a mechanism to lift up the saw blade on the return stroke and some have a coolant pump to prevent the saw blade from overheating.

Power hacksaws are not as commonly used in the metalworking industries as they once were. Bandsaws and cold saws have mostly displaced them. While stationary electric hacksaws are not very common, they are still produced. Power hacksaws of the type powered by stationary engines and line shafts, like other line-shaft-powered machines, are now rare; museums and antique-tool hobbyists still preserve a few of them.

<doc id="1067621" wikidata="Q278183" url="?curid=1067621" title="David Shrigley">
<text>David John Shrigley (born 17 September 1968) is a British visual artist. He lived and worked in Glasgow, Scotland for 27 years before moving to Brighton, England in 2015. Shrigley first came to prominence in the 1990s for his distinct line drawings, which often deal with witty, surreal and darkly humorous subject matter and are rendered in a rough, almost childlike style. Alongside his illustration work, Shrigley is also a noted painter, sculptor, filmmaker and photographer, and has recorded spoken word albums of his writing and poetry.

==Early life and education==
Shrigley was born 17 September 1968 in Macclesfield, Cheshire. He moved with his parents and sister to Oadby, Leicestershire when he was two years old. He attended Beauchamp College in Oadby. He took the Art and Design Foundation course at Leicester Polytechnic in 1987, and then studied environmental art at Glasgow School of Art from 1988 to 1991. Talking about his final degree show, Shrigley later told &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Becky Barnicoat, &quot;I thought my degree show was brilliant, but the people who were marking it didn&#x27;t. I got a 2:2. They didn&#x27;t appreciate my genius.[…] I didn&#x27;t sell anything at the show – it was 1991, before the YBAs. There wasn&#x27;t a precedent for people selling work that wasn&#x27;t figurative painting&quot;. Before becoming a full-time artist, Shrigley worked as a gallery guide at the CCA in Glasgow, where he would use the gallery&#x27;s equipment to self-publish a series of books of his drawings.

==Work==
As well as authoring several books, he directed the video for Blur&#x27;s &quot;Good Song&quot; and also for Bonnie &#x27;Prince&#x27; Billy&#x27;s &quot;Agnes, Queen of Sorrow&quot;. In 2005 he designed a London Underground leaflet cover. Since 2005, he has contributed a cartoon for &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;Weekend&quot; magazine every Saturday. Other projects have included the album &quot;Worried Noodles&quot; (Tom Lab, 2007) where musicians interpret his writings as lyrics, including collaborations by David Byrne, Hot Chip, and Franz Ferdinand. 
Shrigley co-directed a short film with director Chris Shepherd called &quot;Who I Am And What I Want&quot; (2005), based on Shrigley&#x27;s book of the same title, with Kevin Eldon voicing its main character, Pete. Shrigley also produced a series of drawings and t-shirt designs for the 2006 Triptych festival, a Scottish music festival lasting for three to four days in three cities. He also designed twelve different covers for Deerhoof&#x27;s 2007 record, &quot;Friend Opportunity&quot;. In the same year he also designed the title sequence for the film &quot;Hallam Foe&quot;, as well as the drawings and the writing in Hallam&#x27;s on-screen diaries. 

In 2014, Jonathan Jones reviewed Shrigley&#x27;s work &quot;Brass Tooth&quot;, writing, &quot;David Shrigley must have had a big, toothy grin when he created multiple editions of his sculpture &quot;Brass Tooth&quot;, which goes on sale for £1,200 a pop at the London art fair this week. It is a cast of a single tooth – including the roots – and is typical of Shrigley&#x27;s sly, subversive, humorous art in how it brings a modern art cliche crashing down to Earth&quot;.

In 2015, he designed &quot;Kingsley&quot;, a mascot for Scottish football team Partick Thistle as part of a sponsorship deal. The mascot&#x27;s design was the object of some amusement, with Scottish BuzzFeed reporter Jamie Ross describing it as &quot;based on every nightmare I had as a child.&quot;

Shrigley also undertook a residency at Auckland&#x27;s Two Rooms in 2015, during which he painted for the first time since his graduation from The Glasgow School of Art in 1991. He said that the residency presented ‘an opportunity to explore a different medium and explore what you can do with “that” versus what you do with “this”.&#x27;

Shrigley&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Really Good&quot; was installed on Trafalgar Square&#x27;s Fourth plinth between September 2016 and March 2018. He was granted £130,000 by the London mayor&#x27;s office to make the work. Shrigley has said &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get to do anything that meant more to me&quot;.

In 2019, he designed the yellow and red card of the AS Velasca.

Shrigley was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to visual arts.

==Exhibitions==

Recent notable solo exhibitions include &quot;Do Not Touch the Worms&quot;, Copenhagen Contemporary, Denmark (2020); Exhibition of Inflatable Swan Things, Spritmuseum, Stockholm, Sweden (2018); &quot;David Shrigley&quot;, Hall Art Foundation, Reading, Vermont, USA (2017); &quot;Life Model II,&quot; Rose Art Museum, Waltham, Mass., USA (2016); &quot;David Shrigley: Life and Life Drawing,&quot; National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, Australia (2014); &quot;David Shrigley: Brain Activity,&quot; YBCA, San Francisco (2012) &quot;Animate,&quot; Turku Art Museum, Finland (2011); Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Arts, Glasgow, Scotland (2010); &quot;New Powers,&quot; Kunsthalle Mainz, Germany (2009); David Shrigley, Museum Ludwig, Cologne, Germany (2008); Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, UK (2008); &quot;Everything Must Have a Name,&quot; Malmö Konsthall, Malmo, Sweden (2007) and &quot;David Shrigley,&quot; Dundee Contemporary Arts, Dundee, Scotland (2006).

Jason Mraz took the name of his album &quot;We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.&quot; from a work by Shrigley.

In January 2016, Shrigley&#x27;s work was part of a British Council-organised international touring exhibition. Previewing the touring &quot;David Shrigley: Lose Your Mind&quot; exhibition before it opened in Guadalajara, Mexico, BBC Arts said: &quot;Best known for his crudely composed and mordantly humorous cartoons, David Shrigley is a highly popular British artist […] Featuring works as diverse as cartoonish ceramic boots, doodle-like drawings and a headless, stuffed ostrich, the exhibition highlights Shrigley&#x27;s lively, irreverent imagination in full flow&quot;. In the same month, he contributed to the Liverpool Provocations event in Liverpool&#x27;s city centre.

In 2020, Shrigley released a body of work entitled &#x27;Lockdown Drawings&#x27;. 340 pieces of art inspired by the UK&#x27;s coronavirus lockdown in spring 2020 were displayed in the Stephen Friedman Gallery.

In 2021, Shrigley staged a conceptual exhibition &#x27;Mayfair Tennis Ball Exchange&#x27;. where the gallery was filled with new tennis balls, participants were encouraged to exchange the balls for ones of their own.

A further conceptual exhibition &#x27;Pulped Fiction&#x27; was announced in 2023. Shrigley purchased thousands of copies of Dan Brown’s &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, pulped them, made paper and printed copies of George Orwell’s &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot;.

<text>Notes and Queries, also styled Notes &amp; Queries, is a long-running quarterly scholarly journal that publishes short articles related to &quot;English language and literature, lexicography, history, and scholarly antiquarianism&quot;. Its emphasis is on &quot;the factual rather than the speculative&quot;. The journal has a long history, having been established in 1849 in London; it is now published by Oxford University Press.

The journal was originally subtitled &quot;a medium of inter-communication for literary men, artists, antiquaries, genealogists, etc&quot;. It is now subtitled &quot;For readers and writers, collectors and librarians&quot;. Its motto was once &quot;When found, make a note of&quot;, the catchphrase of Capt. Cuttle, a character in Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;.

It is the 250th-most-quoted source in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (3rd ed.), giving 1,633 quotations, many being first evidence of a word or a particular meaning.

==Format==
&quot;Notes and Queries&quot; was first published in 1849 as a weekly periodical edited by W. J. Thoms. It was founded as an academic correspondence magazine, in which scholars and interested amateurs could exchange knowledge on folklore, literature and history. The format consisted of &quot;Notes&quot; (miscellaneous findings of correspondents that they and the editors considered of interest to the readership), and &quot;Queries&quot; (and responses to queries), which formed the bulk of the publication. The magazine has been likened to a 19th-century version of a moderated Internet newsgroup.

Many of the entries in the journal for its first seventy years were only a few paragraphs long, and occasionally as short as a sentence or two. Very frequent contributors include the Rev. Walter W. Skeat, one of the most important figures in the field of English etymology, and Eliza Gutch, a founding member of The Folklore Society. The foundation of such a society was suggested by Gutch through a query to the publication. Gutch contributed to the publication for over seventy years, using the pseudonym &quot;St Swithin&quot;.

Today the magazine is produced as an academic journal. The articles are typically much longer than they were during the journal&#x27;s early years, though they are still shorter than those of the typical academic journal. In addition, the &quot;Notes&quot; now far outweigh the &quot;Queries&quot;, and book reviews have also been introduced. The focus is now almost entirely on literature.

==19th- and 20th-century editors==

==Namesakes==
Over 20 county or regional publications across England, mostly launched in the late 19th century, adopted a similar &quot;notes and queries&quot; format; 16 of which, beginning with &quot;Gloucestershire Notes and Queries&quot; in 1879, included the term within their titles. &quot;Notes and Queries for Somerset and Dorset&quot; (launched in 1888) and &quot;Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries&quot; (launched 1900) both survive in regular publication. There have been several incarnations of &quot;American Notes and Queries&quot;. There are also &quot;Canadian Notes &amp; Queries&quot; and &quot;Kōtare: New Zealand Notes and Queries&quot;.

&quot;Notes and Queries&quot; has also given its name to a number of columns and sections within wider-ranging publications. These include a regular &quot;Notes &amp; Queries&quot; feature in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, started in November 1989.

<doc id="1067627" wikidata="Q152977" url="?curid=1067627" title="World Vegan Day">
<text>World Vegan Day is a global event celebrated annually on 1 November. Vegans celebrate the benefits of veganism for animals, humans, and the natural environment through activities such as setting up stalls, hosting potlucks, and planting memorial trees.

== History ==
The event was established in 1994 by Louise Wallis, then Chair of The Vegan Society in the United Kingdom, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the organization and the coining of the terms &quot;vegan&quot; and &quot;veganism&quot;. Speaking in 2011, Wallis said: &quot;We knew the Society had been founded in November 1944 but didn’t know the exact date, so I decided to go for 1 November, partly because I liked the idea of this date coinciding with Samhain/Halloween and the Day of the Dead - traditional times for feasting and celebration, both apt and auspicious.&quot;

== Calendar context ==
World Vegan Day, a.k.a. International Vegan Day, is celebrated in continuity with Vegetarian Awareness Month (all of October), which begins with World Vegetarian Day on October 1. October also includes other commemorative dates involving reverence for life in all species, faith-based vegetarianism and animal advocacy, and more. 

World Vegan Day follows Vegetarian Awareness Month (October) and initiates World Vegan Month (all of November). 

November 2, commemorated as Dynamic Harmlessness Day, is the birthday of the late H. Jay Dinshah, founder of the American Vegan Society.

<doc id="1067631" wikidata="Q7722135" url="?curid=1067631" title="The Chap">
<text>The Chap is a British humorous men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine published quarterly. It was founded in 1999 by Gustav Temple and Vic Darkwood, and is still edited by Temple.

The magazine proposes that men everywhere return to a more gentlemanly way of life by rejecting modern vulgarity and careless, shabby or faddish dress sense through the restoration of the lifestyle, habits, manners and traditional fashion sense of a mid-20th century (or earlier) British &quot;chap&quot;. Thus it advises men to wear traditional British suits and other similar well-tailored clothing, especially those cut from tweed; to keep their trousers sharply pressed; to be impeccably groomed; to wear quality handmade shoes, brightly polished; and to return to the everyday wearing of hats.

&quot;The Chap&quot; has a comic and eccentric twist on this. It jokingly espouses its own unique lifestyle philosophy called &quot;anarcho-dandyism&quot; and has its own 10-point manifesto, &quot;The Chap Manifesto&quot;, which mandates that a &quot;chap&quot; is to smoke a pipe, is to doff his hat when good manners require, is never to wear what it calls &quot;pantaloons de Nîmes&quot;, and to sport a moustache (never a beard), among others.

==Content==
While &quot;The Chap&quot; appreciates British culture and loves tradition, it is strongly rooted in the Situationist strand of anarchism with more than the occasional nod to Dada. It is also indebted to the avant-garde as well as comedy greats such as the Monty Pythons, Peter Cook, Spike Milligan and Viv Stanshall.

&quot;The Chap&quot; is a mixture of articles on clothing, footwear and headwear; on sport (mainly cricket and horse racing); on moustache grooming; on polite manners and traditional British etiquette; and on pipes and tobacco, all written in an anachronistic late-Victorian to mid-20th Century British style, interspersed with humorous jokes. For instance, the &quot;Am I Chap&quot; section sees people sending in photos of themselves dressed in vintage attire, on which the magazine&#x27;s editors almost always comment derisively in a very withering, but humorous, fashion.

&quot;The Chap&quot; also features articles on a diverse range of things related to &quot;Chappism&quot;, such as tales of First World War and Second World War military derring-do, stories or tips on unusual ways to travel when abroad, or the late Victorian and Edwardian martial art of Bartitsu.

The magazine has often been very satirical or whimsical, with content such as a series chronicling &quot;A Year in Catford&quot; and &quot;Amusing Monograph as to the Various Pleasures and Diversions Afforded by One&#x27;s Valet&quot;.

Notable contributors to &quot;The Chap&quot; include Michael &quot;Atters&quot; Attree who conducts interviews with those known for their gentlemanly or dandyish ways, and Miss Martindale, a prominent spokesperson of Aristasia, who from 2003 to 2005 wrote the Ladies&#x27; Column. Its current literary editor is the author and historian Alexander Larman.

==Publication history==
The magazine is printed in B5 format, and originally was published in that format as well. In May 2009, the magazine nearly closed due to financial issues arising from moving from B5 to the larger A4 format. To keep going &quot;The Chap&quot; asked its readership and subscribers to donate funds. Additionally, Viz Magazine financially supported the magazine. It returned to B5 to reduce printing costs.

&quot;The Chap&quot; was published bi-monthly from 1999 to May 2017.

From issue #92 published in May 2017, the magazine has been published quarterly, has double the number of pages, and has been graphically redesigned. On this &quot;relaunch&quot; the editor said:

==Chap events==
&quot;The Chap&quot; used to host the annual summer Chap Olympiad which was normally held in Bedford Square Gardens in London.

The magazine has also conducted a number of balls called the &quot;Grand Anarcho-Dandyist Balls&quot;.

===Chap protests===
The magazine has also organised several serious and semi-serious protests, all conducted in the unique tongue-in-cheek &quot;Chap&quot; style. These include:
* in 2003, the &quot;Chap Uprising&quot; – against what they see as modern living&#x27;s vulgarity in general;
* in 2004, the &quot;Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Protest&quot; – a protest &quot;against the pointless intrusion by contemporary art pieces into public areas&quot;;
* in 2004, &quot;Civilise the City&quot; – a walk through central London whose aim was &quot;to draw attention to the appalling lack of gentlemanly services available on Britain&#x27;s high streets&quot;;
* in 2006, the &quot;Tate Modern Protest&quot; – against modern art installations; and
* in 2012, the &quot;Siege of Savile Row&quot; – against the proposed opening of an Abercrombie and Fitch store at the centre of traditional English gentleman&#x27;s tailoring, Savile Row.

==Chap publications==
In addition to the magazine, a number of books have been published by &quot;The Chap&quot; over the years: these include &quot;How To Be Chap&quot; and books both on cooking and drinking for &quot;chaps&quot;.

<doc id="1067633" wikidata="Q327035" url="?curid=1067633" title="Battle of Gazala">
<text>The Battle of Gazala, also the Gazala Offensive (Italian: &quot;Battaglia di Ain el-Gazala&quot;) was fought near the village of Gazala during the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War, west of the port of Tobruk in Libya, from 26 May to 21 June 1942. Axis troops consisting of German (; Erwin Rommel) and Italian units fought the British Eighth Army (General Sir Claude Auchinleck, also Commander-in-Chief Middle East) composed mainly of British Commonwealth, Indian and Free French troops.

The Axis troops made a decoy attack in the north as the main attack moved round the southern flank of the Gazala position. Unexpected resistance at the south end of the line around the Bir Hakeim box by the Free French garrison left with a long and vulnerable supply route around the Gazala Line. Rommel retired to a defensive position backing onto Allied minefields (the Cauldron), forming a base in the midst of the British defences. Italian engineers lifted mines from the west side of the minefields to create a supply route through to the Axis side.

Operation Aberdeen, an attack by the Eighth Army to finish off the , was poorly co-ordinated and defeated in detail; many British tanks were lost and the regained the initiative. The Eighth Army withdrew from the Gazala Line and the Axis troops overran Tobruk in a day. Rommel pursued the Eighth Army into Egypt and forced it out of several defensive positions. The Battle of Gazala is considered the greatest victory of Rommel&#x27;s career.

As both sides neared exhaustion, the Eighth Army checked the Axis advance at the First Battle of El Alamein. To support the Axis advance into Egypt, the planned attack on Malta (Operation Herkules) was postponed. The British were able to revive Malta as a base for attacks on Axis convoys to Libya, greatly complicating Axis supply difficulties at El Alamein.

==Background==

===Benghazi===
Following Operation Crusader, in late 1941, the British Eighth Army had relieved Tobruk and driven the Axis forces from Cyrenaica to El Agheila. The Eighth Army advance of over-stretched its supply lines and in January 1942, the Allies reduced the front line garrison for work on lines of communication and supply dumps, preparatory to another westwards advance against Tripolitania. The elimination of Force K from Malta, which ran into an Italian minefield off Tripoli in mid-December and the arrival of II in Sicily, neutralised Allied air and naval forces in Malta, allowing more Axis supplies to reach Libya. After a two-month delay, German and Italian forces in Libya began to receive supplies and reinforcements in men and tanks, which continued until the end of May, when II was transferred to the Russian front.

While aware from signals intelligence of these reinforcements, GHQ in Cairo underestimated their significance and Axis fighting strength, having greatly exaggerated the casualties inflicted on the Axis during Operation Crusader. In an appreciation made in January 1942, Auchinleck alluded to an Axis fighting strength of 35,000 men, when the true figure was about 80,000 (50,000 German and 30,000 Italian troops). The Eighth Army expected to be ready by February and GHQ Cairo believed that the Axis would be too weak and disorganised to mount a counter-offensive in the meantime. On 21 January, Rommel sent out three strong armoured columns to make a tactical reconnaissance. Finding only the thinnest of screens, Rommel changed his reconnaissance into an offensive, recaptured Benghazi on 28 January and Timimi on 3 February. By 6 February, the Allies had fallen back to a line from Gazala to Bir Hakeim, a few miles west of Tobruk, from which the Italo-Germans had retired seven weeks before. The Allies had from 21 January, lost knocked out, another damage and breakdowns and forty field guns.

===Gazala line===

Between Gazala and Timimi, just west of Tobruk, the Eighth Army was able to concentrate its forces sufficiently to turn and fight. By 4 February, the Axis advance had been halted and the front line stabilised from Gazala on the coast west of Tobruk, to an old Ottoman fortress at Bir Hakeim inland to the south. The Gazala line was a series of defensive boxes accommodating a brigade each, laid out across the desert behind minefields and wire, watched by regular patrols between the boxes. The Free French were to the south at the Bir Hakeim box, south of the 150th Infantry Brigade box, which was south of the 69th Infantry Brigade box. The line was not evenly manned, with a greater number of troops covering the coast road, leaving the south less protected but the line was behind deep minefields and a longer line would make an attack around the southern flank harder to supply. Behind the Gazala line, were several defensive boxes. Commonwealth Keep (also known as Hill 209) was at Ras El Madauur on the main defence line of Tobruk, about west-south-west of the port. The Acroma, Knightsbridge ( south of Acroma) and El Adem boxes were sited to block tracks and junctions. A box at Retma was finished just before the Axis offensive but work on boxes at Point 171 south-east of Bir Hakeim and Bir el Gubi did not begin until 25 May.

==Prelude==

===British preparations===
Churchill pressed Auchinleck to attack to push the Axis out of Cyrenaica and relieve the pressure on Malta, which Churchill felt was essential to the war effort,
The Eighth Army received new equipment, including tanks equipped with 75 mm guns, and large numbers of 6-pounder anti-tank guns. Rommel thought that Allied minefields ended well north of Bir Hakeim and did not know of the &quot;mine marsh&quot; surrounding the box. The Eighth Army was in the process of reorganising, changing the relationship between infantry and artillery, while the RAF commander Arthur Tedder concentrated the efforts of the Desert Air Force (DAF) on supporting the troops on the ground. Army commanders lost the power to direct air operations, which was reserved for the air commanders. A new fighter-bomber concept was developed and Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Coningham, commander of the DAF, moved his headquarters to the Eighth Army HQ to improve communication.

Axis commanders knew that the entry of the United States into the war would give the Eighth Army access to an increase in materiel but sought to forestall an Allied offensive before these supplies could influence events. By late May, the 1st South African Division was on the Gazala line nearest the coast, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division to the south and the 1st Free French Brigade furthest south at Bir Hakeim. The 1st and 7th Armoured Divisions waited behind the main line as a mobile counter-attack force, the 2nd South African Division formed a garrison at Tobruk and the 5th Indian Infantry Division (which had arrived in April to relieve the 4th Indian Infantry Division) was held in reserve. The Allies had and 

===Axis preparations===
The Axis retreat to El Agheila after Operation Crusader reduced the supply distance from Tripoli to . The discovery of of fuel at Tripoli eased the supply crisis, despite the delivery of only of supplies in January. The had a much shorter supply line and the British were burdened by an over-extended supply line. II in Sicily had also regained air superiority for the Axis. Rommel asked for another but this unrealistic demand was rejected and Rommel was warned that an advance would cause another supply crisis. On 29 January, the recaptured Benghazi and next day ammunition supply to the front line failed. By 13 February, Rommel agreed to stop at Gazala, from Tripoli.

Until May, monthly deliveries averaged , less than the smaller Axis force received from June–October 1941 but sufficient for an offensive. The advance to Gazala succeeded because Benghazi was open, reducing the transport distance for about 33 percent of the supplies of the to . The Italians tried to restrain Rommel by advocating the capture of Malta, which would postpone another offensive in Africa until the autumn but agreed to an attack on Tobruk for late May. An advance would stop at the Egyptian frontier, another east and the would redeploy for Operation Herkules. The capture of Malta would not alter the constraints of port capacity and distance; protecting convoys and a large port close to the front, would still be necessary for victory.
Air attacks directed by Kesselring against Malta greatly reduced its offensive capacity, allowing supply convoys from Italy to reach Axis forces in Africa with increased regularity. (Operation Venice), the Axis plan of attack, was for armoured forces to make a flanking manoeuvre south of the fortified &quot;box&quot; at Bir Hakeim. On the left flank, the 132nd Armoured Division &quot;Ariete&quot; would neutralise the Bir Hakeim box and on the right flank, the 21st Panzer Division and 15th Panzer Division would advance north behind the Eighth Army defences, to destroy the Allied armour and cut off the infantry divisions on the Gazala line. On the far right of the attack, a (battle group) from the 90th Light &quot;Afrika&quot; Division was to advance to El Adem, south of Tobruk and cut the line of supply from the port to the Gazala line while holding Allied troops at Tobruk.

The rest of the XX Motorized Corps and the 101st Motorised Division &quot;Trieste&quot;, would open a gap in the minefield north of the Bir Hakeim box near the Sidi Muftah box, to create a supply route to the armour. Rommel anticipated that, having dealt with the Allied armour, he would capture El Adem, Ed Duda, Sidi Rezegh and &quot;Knightsbridge&quot;. The Axis tanks would then be in a position to attack on the following day westwards against the Eighth Army defensive boxes between Gazala and Alem Hamza, meeting the eastwards attack by X Corps and XXI Corps. By late May, the Axis forces comprised and On 26 May, ordered Bastico and Rommel to launch the offensive, defeat the British armoured forces and capture Tobruk.

==Battle==

===Operation Venice===
At 14:00 on 26 May, X Corps and XXI Corps attacked on the central Gazala positions, after an artillery concentration, beginning (Operation Venice). A few elements of the and XX Mobile Corps were attached to these assault groups. During the day, the bulk of the (DAK) moved, to give the impression that this was the main Axis assault. When night fell, the armoured formations turned south in a sweeping move around the southern end of the Gazala line.

In the early hours of 27 May, Rommel led the elements of , DAK, XX Motorised Corps and the German 90th Light Division, in a bold flanking move around the southern end of the Allied line, using the Allied minefields to protect the Axis flank and rear. The &quot;Ariete&quot; Division was held up for about an hour by the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division, dug in about south east of Bir Hakeim at Rugbet el Atasc. The 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment of the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division sent its experienced VIII and IX Medium Tank battalions forward, while the fresh X Medium Tank Battalion was in support. The Indian position was overrun with the loss of some of which were repairable on the field, killed and , while the Indians lost killed and wounded and about including Admiral Sir Walter Cowan and most of its equipment. The 21st Panzer Division was advancing south of the position and did not take part in the action.

Further to the east, the 15th Panzer Division had engaged the 4th Armoured Brigade of the 7th Armoured Division, which had been ordered south to support the 3rd Indian and 7th Motorised brigades. In a mutually costly engagement, the Germans were surprised by the range and power of the guns on the new M3 (Grant) tanks. The 4th Armoured Brigade then withdrew toward El Adem and spent the night near the Belhamed supply base, east of El Adem. By late morning, the Axis armoured units had advanced more than north but by noon had been stopped by the 1st Armoured Division in more mutually-costly fighting.
On the far right of the Axis advance, the 90th Light Division engaged the 7th Motorised Brigade at Retma and forced it to withdraw eastwards on Bir el Gubi. Resuming their advance toward El Adem before noon, armoured cars of the 90th Light came upon the advanced HQ of 7th Armoured Division near Bir Beuid, dispersing it and capturing a number of officers, including the commander, Frank Messervy, who pretended to be a batman and escaped. The &quot;inexcusable&quot; lapse in security left the division without effective command for the next two days. As planned, the 90th Light Division reached the El Adem area by mid-morning and captured a number of supply dumps. The following day, the 4th Armoured Brigade was sent to El Adem and the 90th Light Division was driven back to the south-west.

The tank battle continued for three days; lacking possession of Bir Hakeim, Rommel drew the DAK into a defensive position, using the extensive Allied mine belts to block an Allied approach from the west. The British tanks attacked several times from the north and east against accurate defensive fire. The Axis supply situation became desperate; defending the German rear, the &quot;Ariete&quot; Division repulsed attacks by the British armoured brigades on 29 May and during the first week of June.

===Bir Hakeim===
The Bir Hakeim box was defended by the 1st Free French Brigade under Marie-Pierre Kœnig. On 27 May, the Italian IX Tank Battalion of the 132nd Tank Infantry Regiment (Ariete Division), which had not been engaged in the destruction of the 3rd Indian Brigade box and had continued to advance alone at full speed, stumbled in the French positions and launched a hasty attack, which was a costly failure against the French guns and mines. On the night of the 90th Light and Trieste divisions were sent south to renew the attack on Bir Hakeim, where the battle continued for another ten days.


Reinforced with a further , the Axis attacked Bir Hakeim again on 9 June and overran the defences by the following day. Ritchie ordered the remaining troops to evacuate as best they could, under the cover of darkness. Under fire through the night, many of the French were able to find gaps in the line through which to withdraw. The survivors then made their way some to the west, to rendezvous with transport from the 7th Motor Brigade. About (including of the original garrison of and about troops, many of whom were wounded, were captured when the 90th Light Division occupied the position on 11 June.

===The Cauldron===

Early on 29 May, supply vehicles supported by the Trieste and Ariete divisions, worked through the minefield north of Bir Hakeim and reached the . On 30 May, Rommel pulled the back westward against the edge of the minefields, creating a defensive position. A link was formed with elements of the Italian X Corps, which were clearing two routes through the minefields from the west. In the process, the Sidi Muftah box was overrun and the defending 150th Infantry Brigade was destroyed after brutal fighting. At one point, Rommel personally led a platoon of panzer grenadiers in the attack;

Acting on mistaken reports about German tank losses, Auchinleck strongly urged Ritchie to counter-attack along the coast, to exploit the absence of German tanks and break through to Timimi and then Mechili. Ritchie was more concerned by Tobruk, brought reinforcements up to the El Adem box and created new defensive boxes opposite the gaps in the minefield. Ritchie ordered the Eighth Army to counter-attack against the on 5 June but they were met by accurate fire from tank and anti-tank guns positioned in the cauldron. In the north, XIII Corps made no progress but the attack by 7th Armoured and 5th Indian divisions on the eastern flank of the cauldron at 02:50 initially went well. An important element of the plan was the destruction of the Axis anti-tank screen with an artillery bombardment but because of an error in plotting its position, the bombardment fell too far to the east. When the 22nd Armoured Brigade advanced, it was met by massed anti-tank fire and checked. The 32nd Army Tank Brigade, advancing from the north, joined the attack at dawn but also ran into massed fire, losing fifty of seventy tanks.
By early afternoon on 5 June, Rommel split his forces, deciding to attack east with the and 21st Panzer divisions while he sent elements of 15th Panzer Division northwards against the Knightsbridge Box. The eastward thrust towards Bir el Hatmat dispersed the tactical HQs of the two British divisions, as well as the HQs of the 9th Indian Infantry Brigade, the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade and other smaller units, which caused command to break down. The 22nd Armoured Brigade, having lost its was forced from the battlefield by more attacks from the 15th Panzer Division. Three Indian infantry battalions, a reconnaissance regiment and four artillery regiments of the attacking force were left behind, unsupported by armour and overrun. Rommel retained the initiative, maintaining his strength in the cauldron while the number of operational British tanks diminished. A number of probes were sent to test the various opposing strong points and from 6 to 8 June, further attacks were launched on Bir Hakeim and repulsed by the French garrison. The 7th Motor Brigade and 29th Indian Infantry Brigade continued to harass the Axis lines of communications.

===Knightsbridge, 10 June===

Orders for the 4th Armoured Brigade were to occupy Hill 176, west of Trigh Bir Hakeim, then attack the &quot;Ariete&quot; and force it to withdraw. The 2nd Armoured Brigade was to carry out a demonstration in support of the 4th Armoured Brigade. At 05:45 on 10 June , C Squadron, equipped with M3 Grant tanks, of the Queen&#x27;s Bays left the bivouac between Rigel Ridge to the north and Trigh Capuzzo to the south, heading towards the &quot;Ariete&quot; positions. At 07:00 C Squadron of the Queen&#x27;s Bays came into contact with the tank units of the &quot;Ariete&quot;, which sustained the shock and at about 08:00 forced the British to withdraw. On the start line the 6th RTR was on the right, with C Squadron on the left, B Squadron on the right and A Squadron ready to intervene on both flanks. The 1st RTR was deployed on the left with A Squadron in the lead (intended to cover the left flank of the regiment), followed by C Squadron, the command, B Squadron and a battery of the 1st RHA. At 08:40 the 6th RTR, preceded by a two-hour artillery preparation and covered by smoke bombs, invested the 2nd Company/VIII Battalion of the 132nd Infantry Tank Regiment.

The formation saw the Grants in the centre and the Stuarts on the wings but their M13s and the self-propelled guns managed to prevent the envelopment and forced the British to march along the front, exposing the flanks of their tanks to Italian fire. At 09:00, finding itself under fire from anti-tank guns as well as tanks, C Squadron, 6th RTR closed in on the Italian tanks, managing to hit an Italian vehicle. The pressure on the Italian tanks managed to push them to within about of the anti-tank defence line, which then found it difficult to lay its anti-tank guns as they were masked by the Italian tanks. The 88/55 gun, after having adjusted its fire, at 09:40 destroyed two British tanks and stopped a third, then C Squadron began its retreat, followed after ten minutes by the rest of the 6th RTR while the anti-tank gun was countered by counter-battery fire from the RHA. At 11:00 a patrol of the 6th RTR, sent ahead to check the situation on the battlefield, was repulsed by artillery fire and at 11:30, another attack was made and was repulsed by concentrated fire from the Italian defences. At 14:00 the Queen&#x27;s Bays were ordered to intervene to support the struggling 4th Armoured Brigade and having reached the position where the retreating regiments had stopped, exchanged positions with those of the 1st RTR, without there being any further clashes with the Italians.

===Black Saturday, 13 June===

On 11 June, Rommel pushed the 15th Panzer Division and 90th Light Division toward El Adem and by 12 June had begun forcing the 201st Guards Brigade out of the Knightsbridge Box. The 29th Indian Infantry Brigade repulsed an attack on the El Adem box on 12 June but the 2nd and 4th Armoured brigades on their left were pushed back by the 15th Panzer Division and left their damaged tanks on the battlefield. On 13 June, the 21st Panzer Division advanced against the 22nd Armoured Brigade. The had combined tanks with anti-tank guns; Rommel had acted rapidly on intelligence obtained from Allied radio intercepts.

By the end of the day, the British tank strength had been reduced from to about seventy; the had established armour superiority and a dominating line of positions, making XIII Corps on the Gazala line vulnerable to being cut off. By the end of 13 June, the Knightsbridge box was virtually surrounded and was abandoned by the Guards Brigade later that night, their commanding officer Thomas Bevan having been killed the previous day. Due to these failures, 13 June became known as &quot;Black Saturday&quot; to the Eighth Army.

====Rigel Ridge====

On 13 June, the 21st Panzer Division attacked Rigel Ridge in the middle of a sandstorm. The Germans overran part of the 2nd Scots Guards at the Knightsbridge Box at the west end of Rigel Ridge, overlooked by the 6th South African Anti-tank battery of the 2nd Field Regiment, Natal Field Artillery and a battery of the 11th (HAC) Regiment RHA nearby. The South African gunners kept firing until their guns were destroyed, allowing the withdrawal of other Allied formations. The South African battery commander had decided to stay and maintain fire against the German tanks, to delay the Germans for as long as possible. The remaining guns were commanded individually and fired at the Panzers over open sights. The German tanks took up positions behind the ridge, with anti-tank guns placed between them. A column of Panzers attacked from the rear, surrounding them and cutting off all escape and the gunners kept firing until the eight guns had been destroyed. About half the gun detachments were killed and wounded, including the battery commander and many officers. The last gun in action was manned by Lieutenant Ashley and a signaller; when the battery had been silenced, the Axis tanks approached cautiously and the South African gunners were taken prisoner.

===Eighth Army retreat===

On 14 June, Auchinleck authorised Ritchie to withdraw from the Gazala Line. The defenders in the El Adem and two neighbouring boxes held on and the 1st South African Division was able to withdraw along the coast road, practically intact. The road could not accommodate two divisions and the remaining two brigades of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division could not retreat eastwards because of the Axis tanks and attacked south-west, breaking through the lines of the 27th Infantry Division &quot;Brescia&quot; and 17th Infantry Division &quot;Pavia&quot; of X Corps; then headed south into the desert, before turning east. London would not contemplate a withdrawal to the better defensive positions on the Egypt–Libya frontier and on 14 June, Auchinleck ordered to Ritchie to hold a line running south-east from Acroma (west of Tobruk) through El Adem to Bir El Gubi. By the evening of 15 June, the defensive box at Point 650 had been overrun and on 16 June, the defenders at Point 187 had been forced by lack of supplies to evacuate. The defensive boxes at El Adem and Sidi Rezegh were also attacked by the . On 17 June, both boxes were evacuated, ending any chance of preventing the encirclement of Tobruk. Ritchie ordered the Eighth Army to withdraw to Mersa Matruh, about east of the frontier, leaving Tobruk to threaten the Axis lines of communication as in 1941. The retreat became known to some as the Gazala Gallop.

===Fall of Tobruk===
In February 1942, the army, navy and air force commanders-in-chief in Cairo had agreed that Tobruk should not stand another siege. Auchinleck viewed the defence of Tobruk as a lesser matter and told Ritchie that he did not intend to hold it at all costs. An immense store of supplies of every description had been accumulated around the port for an Allied offensive and Auchinleck expected it to be able to hold out for two months with the supplies in the fortress. The defences at Tobruk had not been maintained and it was garrisoned by inexperienced troops. Gott garrisoned Tobruk with the two brigades of 2nd South African Division (Major-General Hendrik Klopper) along with the 201st Guards (Motorised) Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 32nd Army Tank Brigade and the 4th Anti-Aircraft Brigade.

Operation Venice () began on 26 May 1942 and drove the Eighth Army east of Tobruk, leaving it vulnerable to attack from the east. The British prime minister Winston Churchill had placed great store on the symbolic value of Tobruk and there was an exchange of ambiguous signals, leading to the port becoming surrounded and besieged, rather than evacuated as originally planned. penetrated a weak spot on the eastern defensive perimeter and took the port within twenty-four hours. The garrison of 33,000 men was captured, many of those on the western perimeter not having been engaged. Over 1,000 vehicles in working order, of food and of petrol were captured. The surrender was the largest capitulation of British Empire forces in the war after the Battle of Singapore in February 1942. Later in the year, a Court of Inquiry () found Klopper to be largely blameless for the surrender and ascribed the defeat to failures among the British high command. The findings were kept secret until after the war, doing little to restore the reputation of Klopper and his troops.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

With the capture of Tobruk, the Axis gained a port nearer the Aegean–Crete route and a large amount of Allied supplies. If the Allies could not stop the Germans in Egypt, they would take the Suez Canal and potentially drive for the oilfields in the Middle East. Hitler rewarded Rommel with a promotion to the rank of field-marshal, the youngest German officer ever to achieve this rank. Rommel remarked he would have preferred another panzer division.

Churchill wrote,

Auchinleck dismissed Ritchie on 25 June and assumed command of the Eighth Army for the First Battle of El Alamein, where he stopped Rommel&#x27;s advance. In August, Auchinleck was replaced as Eighth Army commander by the XIII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General William Gott and as C-in-C Middle East Command by General Sir Harold Alexander. Gott was killed when his aircraft was shot down and Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery was appointed as his replacement.

In 2017, James Holland wrote,

===Casualties===
The Eighth Army lost wounded or captured, including taken at Tobruk. The Germans suffered , about 15 per cent of their force. Italian casualties were 3,000 men, 125 tanks, 44 armoured cars, 450 motor vehicles, 39 guns and seventy-four anti-tank guns. On 30 June, the Afrika Korps reported that Axis tank losses were that only tanks were operational, the Italian XX Corps was down to fifteen tanks and the 90th Light Division had only left. The Eighth Army lost thousands of tons of supplies, nearly of artillery ammunition, nearly rounds of small-arms ammunition and a huge number of tanks. Hundreds of damaged tanks had been left behind when armoured regiments retreated and it was estimated that there were casualties in 17 days. On 22 June, the Desert Air Force had aircraft, them in the Middle East, the Germans the Italians another reserve and the Mediterranean excluding Italy. The Royal Army Ordnance Corps recovered up to 19 June, repaired sent to Egypt US-made tanks). The Eighth Army was reduced to about tanks by the end of the battle and shuffling operational tanks and crews between units disrupted unit organisation. Seven field artillery regiments, and two tank repair workshops (which had been moved into Tobruk) were lost. By 1 July, the Eighth Army was back at El Alamein, with tanks, from workshops and waiting to be repaired.

===Subsequent operations===
 began an advance upon Egypt, while the Eighth Army fell back to El Alamein. Auchinleck decided not to hold Mersa Matruh, choosing to fight a delaying action with X and XIII Corps. The was delayed at the Battle of Mersa Matruh but signal failures led to disorganisation and the X Corps line of retreat along the coast road being cut off. The corps broke out at night to the south and worked its way around the German positions, collided with Axis forces several times and lost more than forty tanks and a large quantity of supplies. Auchinleck had ordered the bulk of the Eighth Army to retire another to El Alamein, from Alexandria. The retirements brought the Eighth Army closer to its base and the Qattara Depression to the south of El Alamein closed the southern flank. The Allied and Axis forces fought the First Battle of El Alamein, the Battle of Alam el Halfa and the Second Battle of El Alamein. Operation Agreement, a British landing at Tobruk during the night of to rescue Allied prisoners, was a failure.

<text>The Residents Associations of Epsom and Ewell is a local political party in the borough of Epsom and Ewell in Surrey, England. They have held majority control of Epsom and Ewell Borough Council since its formation in 1937. The party is sometimes recorded as &quot;Other&quot; in national results lists and otherwise recorded alongside residents associations with a single Articles of Association. It consists of ward or multiple ward based residents associations with their own candidate selection rules. These include Ewell Court Residents&#x27; Association, Epsom Town Residents&#x27; Association and West Ewell and Ruxley Residents’ Association.

Since the 2023 Epsom and Ewell Borough Council election, the Residents Association has controlled the council.

== History ==
The majority of Residents&#x27; Associations were formed from the expansion of housing provision in the 1930s, with the aim of bettering the lives of residents and forming a community. This tradition of forming residents&#x27; groups on new developments in the borough continues today, such as with Clarendon Park Residents&#x27; Association, which was formed in 2001.

Traditionally, throughout the UK, local councillors would stand as independents. However, throughout the 20th century, it became common for councillors to be elected with a party affiliation. Today, Epsom and Ewell Borough Council and Uttlesford District Council in Essex are the only two councils in England where Residents&#x27; Associations have overall control.

== Structure ==
There are eleven independent Residents Associations that form the Residents&#x27; Associations of Epsom and Ewell. The Standing Committee of Residents Associations (SCoRA) provides a forum for the Residents&#x27; Associations to discuss common issues or borough-wide concerns. These meetings are for the chair and secretary of the respective groups; however, councillors may be asked to attend these forums to update SCoRA on progress or concerns with the council.

==Election results==
=== Epsom and Ewell Borough Council ===
The RA contests all 35 available ward councillor seats and are the controlling group on Epsom and Ewell Borough Council. They currently have 26 elected councillors in the following multiple member wards:

*Auriol – 2 of 2
*College – 0 of 3
*Court – 0 of 3
*Cuddington – 3 of 3
*Ewell Village – 2 of 2
*Ewell Court – 2 of 2
*Horton – 0 of 2
*Nonsuch – 3 of 3
*Ruxley – 2 of 2
*Stamford – 1 of 2
*Stoneleigh – 2 of 2
*Town – 3 of 3
*West Ewell – 3 of 3
*Woodcote &amp; Langley Vale – 3 of 3

=== Surrey County Council ===
Candidates from local residents associations contest county elections under the banner of the Residents Associations of Epsom and Ewell, which is a registered political party. This differs from borough elections, where some residents associations are registered as political parties in their own right, while some are not. The RAs of Epsom &amp; Ewell currently have four elected county councillors, in the following single member divisions:

*Ewell
*Ewell Court, Auriol &amp; Cuddington
*West Ewell
*Epsom Town and Downs

The other division has a Conservative councillor:

*Epsom West

== Notes ==
:1.By-elections were held in Cuddington ward in 2021 and West Ewell ward in 2022, following the deaths of two councillors.

<text>A barrier pipe is a type of water pipe with a barrier to prevent undesired contaminants from entering the pipe.

== Water supply ==
When running water supply pipes through contaminated ground standard MDPE piping is unsuitable because it doesn&#x27;t block entry of contaminants such as hydrocarbons. Barrier piping typically has an aluminium layer between two plastic layers but solid cast iron and other options exist. It&#x27;s normally required for brownfield land construction.

== Heating systems ==
In hydronic, water-carrying, heating systems a plastic pipe is manufactured with a barrier that prevents oxygen from penetrating the material and entering the water system, reducing the risk of corrosion.
The &#x27;barrier&#x27; is usually a resin material bonded between the outer and inner layer of the pipe itself. The pipe being either a cross linked polyethylene or polybutylene. This can be cheaper than the traditional copper piping.

<doc id="1067648" wikidata="Q569461" url="?curid=1067648" title="Schaubühne">
<text>The  (Theatre on Lehniner Square) is a famous theatre in the Wilmersdorf district of Berlin, located on the Kurfürstendamm boulevard. It is a conversion of the &quot;Universum&quot; cinema, built according to plans designed by Erich Mendelsohn in 1928.

==History==
The cinema was the centrepiece of the wider &quot;WOGA&quot; housing complex, designed by Mendelsohn in a New Objectivity-styled urban development ensemble, with a shopping walkway, apartment blocks, lawns, and a tennis court in the back. It possibly was the first Modernist cinema built in the world, as opposed to the Moorish, Egyptian, and baroque styles that predominated. Mendelsohn wrote a short text on his cinema, declaring &#x27;no Baroque palaces for Buster Keaton&#x27;. The cinema would become very influential on Streamline Moderne cinema design in the 1930s.

Heavily damaged in World War II, it was rebuilt and re-opened and from 1969 served as a dance hall and for musical theatre. The building&#x27;s current use as a lyric-style theatre dates from the late 1970s, when the Schaubühne ensemble around Peter Stein, formerly residing on Hallesches Ufer in Kreuzberg, searched for a new venue. From 1978 to 1981, the interiors were completely changed, centred on a theatre hall with adjustable spaces and no separation of audience and performers.

The Schaubühne ensemble itself was founded in 1962. It became the domain of Peter Stein in 1970. Stein had sparked a theatre scandal in Munich, where he had staged Peter Weiss&#x27; &quot;Viet Nam Diskurs&quot;, by collecting money among the theatre-goers in order to support the Viet Cong. Strongly influenced by the Protests of 1968 and the German student movement, his first production of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Mother&quot;, starring Therese Giehse, immediately earned fierce protests by conservative West Berlin politicians, who spoke of &quot;communist agitation&quot;. The next year, the ensemble received the Deutscher Kritikerpreis award for the performance of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;. In the following years, the Schaubühne directed by Stein and his dramaturgical assistant Botho Strauß became one of the leading theatre stages in Germany.

In 1999, Thomas Ostermeier took over as artistic director at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin, alongside co-directors Jens Hillje and Sasha Waltz. Waltz opened the Schaubühne under new direction with the debut of &quot;Körper&quot; (2000). With a move towards social theatre, attendance increased by 14%.

Since 2000, the theatre has hosted &quot;Streitraum&quot;, a series of political public panel discussions now moderated by Carolin Emcke.

Waltz left on the expiration of her five-year contract and reactivated her independent company Sasha Waltz &amp; Guests, based in Berlin.

Since 2005, Thomas Ostermeier and Jens Hillje have been responsible for a vigorous modern orientation of Stein&#x27;s former theatre, where tradition still has its place with a focus on interpretations of classic works.

==Touring==
Under Ostermeier and intendant Tobias Veit, Schaubühne productions have toured internationally.

Australia in particular has seen Schaubühne productions since 2006. The ensemble made its Australian debut with &quot;Nora&quot; at the 2006 Adelaide Festival, followed by &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; at the 2008 Adelaide Festival (both under the artistic direction of Brett Sheehy). &quot;Hamlet&quot; was staged at the 2010 Sydney Festival (under the artistic direction of Lindy Hume), and &quot;Trust&quot; was performed at the 2011 Perth International Arts Festival (under the artistic direction of Shelagh Magazda).
Schaubühne&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; appeared at the 2011 Melbourne Festival, and the following year, &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; was staged at the same festival (both under the artistic direction of Brett Sheehy).
All productions which have toured Australia have been directed by Ostermeier, except for &quot;Trust&quot;, which was directed by Falk Richter and Anouk van Dijk.

<text>Agrinio (Greek: Αγρίνιο, ; Latin: &quot;Agrinium&quot;) is the largest city of the Aetolia-Acarnania regional unit of Greece and its largest municipality, with 89,691 inhabitants (2021) as well as the second largest city in Western Greece after Patras. It is the economic center of Aetolia-Acarnania, although its capital is the town of Mesolonghi. The settlement dates back to ancient times. Ancient Agrinion was northeast of the present city; some walls and foundations of which have been excavated. In medieval times and until 1836, the city was known as Vrachori (Βραχώρι).

The majority of the local population was occupied for an important period of time in the tobacco industry, from the last decades of 19th till the end of the 20th century. Big tobacco companies were founded in the city, including the famous Papastratos, alongside Panagopoulos and Papapetrou. Agrinion is also agriculturally known for its production of Agrinion olives.

== History ==

=== Antiquity ===
According to mythology, the ancient city of Agrinio (situated in the area of Megali Chora) was built by king Agrios, son of Portheus and a great-grandson of Aetolos (king of Plevron and Calydon) around 1600-1100 BC.

The town, built near the banks of river Achelous (the natural border between Aetolia and Acarnania), was claimed by both states during ancient times. Agrinio became member of the Aetolian League and it was later destroyed by Cassander in 314 BC during the League&#x27;s wars against the Kingdom of Macedonia.

=== Ottoman era ===

The city reappeared during the Ottoman period with the name Vrachori and apart from its Greek population it was also inhabited by many Turks (Muslims). In 1585 it was deserted during the revolt of Theodoros Migas. At the beginning of the 18th century, it became the administrative centre of Aetolia-Acarnania (then as the sanjak of Karleli), depended on the imperial harems. Vrachori participated in the Greek Revolution and was temporarily liberated, by an army group led by Alexakis Vlachopoulos, on 11 June 1821. In August 1822, while Reşid Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s (Kütahi) troops were marching towards Vrachori, its citizens decided to burn and evacuate their city, following the strategy of scorched earth. The deserted city was recaptured by the Turks. The city was finally included in the borders of the newborn Greek state permanently in 1832 with the Treaty of Constantinople (9 July 1832) and was renamed after its ancient name, Agrinion.

=== Modern era ===
In the years following the liberation, Agrinio went through an important growth and development, especially at the end of the 19th century and the dawn of the 20th. After the Greco-Turkish War and the Asia Minor Catastrophe, many refugees from Asia Minor (western Turkey) arrived in the city and settled in the district of Agios Konstantinos. At the same period there was an important internal immigration to Agrinio from the whole Aetolia-Acarnania region, along with immigration from the areas of Epirus and Evrytania.

During the Interwar period, in spite of economical crisis, works of infrastructure took place in the city, like the paving of streets and the installation of electricity, and a water tower was installed in 1930. At the same time excavations revealed the ancient city of Agrinion. Growth and prosperity returned after World War II and the Greek Civil War. This growth was boosted by the building of two major hydroelectric dam installations at Kremasta and Kastraki, on the north of the city. The tobacco industry and olive tree cultivation became the main income sources of the city.

== Geography ==

===Geology===

The city&#x27;s official seal includes a characteristic moment of the ancient Greek mythology. More specifically, the seal depicts Hercules fighting the river god Achelous. According to the myth, Hercules fought against the river god for the sake of Diianira, the princess of Calydon, which both of them wanted as a wife. Despite Achelous&#x27; transformations, Hercules managed to win the battle and married the princess. According to Strabo, the myth symbolises the struggle of ancient Aetolians to control the river&#x27;s power with embankments, by which the river was confined to its bed and thus the area gained large tracts of land for cultivation.

<text>The Aero Boero 260AG is an Argentine agricultural aircraft that first flew in 1973. Despite the similarity in designation, it is completely different from and unrelated to the Aero Boero AB-260.

The 260AG is a low-wing monoplane with a single seat and fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Development commenced in 1971 as the AG.235/260, but various problems forced the project to stagnate and it was not revived until the 1990s.

<text>The Kamov Ka-27 (NATO reporting name &#x27;Helix&#x27;) is a military helicopter developed for the Soviet Navy, and as of 2024 is in service in various countries including Russia, Ukraine, Vietnam, China, South Korea, and India. Variants include the Ka-29 assault transport, the Ka-28 downgraded export version, and the Ka-32 for civilian use.

==Design and development==
The helicopter was developed for ferrying and anti-submarine warfare. Design work began in 1969 and the first prototype flew in 1973. It was intended to replace the decade-old Kamov Ka-25, and had to have identical or smaller external dimensions than its predecessor. Like other Kamov military helicopters it has coaxial rotors, removing the need for a tail rotor. In total, five prototypes and pre-series helicopters were built. Series production started at Kumertau in July 1979, and the new helicopter officially entered service with the Soviet Navy in April 1981.

The Ka-27 has a crew of three with a pilot and navigator both stationed in the cockpit, and a sonar operator seated behind them. It has a four-leg fixed landing gear. The Ka-27 is equipped with two lateral buoys, that can be inflated in the case of a forced landing on water.

The Ka-27PL anti-submarine version is equipped with a radar, and either a dipping sonar or a magnetic anomaly detector. It can also carry either up to 36 sonobuoys, or a torpedo, or between six and eight conventional depth charges, or a single nuclear one. Ka-27PLs generally operate in pairs as hunter-killer teams.

The Ka-27PS search and rescue helicopter can carry 12 folding seats or four stretchers in its cabin, and is equipped with a winch. Its fuel capacity of is greater than the capacity of the Ka-27PL.

Ka-32 variants, e.g. the Klimov-powered Ka-32A11BC, have been certified for commercial operations throughout the world, notably in Canada and Europe. The Ka-32 has been certified for the newer Klimov VK-2500PS-02 engine.

== Operational history ==

A Russian Navy Ka-27 helicopter from the Russian &quot;Severomorsk&quot; conducted interoperability deck landing training on board the US command ship on 22 July 2010.

Ka-32A11BC multipurpose helicopters have been successfully operated in Portugal for over five years. In 2006, Kamov won the tender for the supply of Ka-32A11BC firefighting helicopters, to replace Aérospatiale SA 330 Pumas.

Over 240 Ka-32 have been built as of 2019 and have been exported to more than 30 countries; South Korea operates some 60 Ka-32s. In the mid-1990s Russia offset debt to South Korea through supplies of weapons.

The Ka-32A11BC features a high power-to-weight ratio and ease of handling, owing to its coaxial rotor design. The rotors&#x27; diameters are not restricted by the presence of a tail rotor and associated tail boom; this facilitates maneuvering near obstacles and helps assure exceptional accuracy when hovering in heavy smoke and dust conditions. The Ka-32A11BC may be equipped with the Bambi Bucket suspended fire-fighting system of up to five tons capacity.
The service life has been extended to up to 32,000 flight hours.

Since the 1990s, China has purchased the Ka-28 export version and Ka-31 radar warning version for the PLAN fleet. Ka-31 purchases were first revealed in 2010. It is believed that Chinese Ka-28s have been equipped with more enhanced avionics compared to Ka-28s exported to other countries.

In 2013, Russia tested the new Kamov Ka-27M with an active electronically scanned array radar. The basis of the modernization of the Ka-27M is installed on the helicopter airborne radar with an active phased array antenna FH-A. This radar is part of the command and tactical radar system that combines several other systems: acoustic, magnetometric, signals intelligence and radar. All the information on them is displayed on the display instrumentation.

Ka-32s are used for construction of transmission towers for overhead power lines, as it has somewhat higher lift capacity than the Vertol 107. In Canada, the Ka-32 is used for selective logging as it is able to lift selective species vertically.

In August 2013, a Kamov Ka-32, C-GKHL operating in Bella Coola, British Columbia, Canada, experienced failure of one of its Klimov TV3-117BMA engines (manufactured by Motor Sich in Ukraine). The subsequent technical investigation indicated that there was poor quality control in the assembly of the compressor turbine, leading to failure of the complete unit after several compressor blades separated.

Ka-27s have been used by the Syrian Navy during the ongoing Syrian Civil War.

On 21 June 2024, a Ka-29 was reportedly shot down over Crimea, by a Russian Pantsir-S1, during a Ukrainian drone attack involving both air and naval drones, killing the crew of four.

<text>In mathematics, the Hilbert–Speiser theorem is a result on cyclotomic fields, characterising those with a normal integral basis. More generally, it applies to any finite abelian extension of , which by the Kronecker–Weber theorem are isomorphic to subfields of cyclotomic fields.

:Hilbert–Speiser Theorem. A finite abelian extension has a normal integral basis if and only if it is tamely ramified over .

This is the condition that it should be a subfield of where is a squarefree odd number. This result was introduced by in his Zahlbericht and by .

In cases where the theorem states that a normal integral basis does exist, such a basis may be constructed by means of Gaussian periods. For example if we take a prime number , has a normal integral basis consisting of all the -th roots of unity other than . For a field contained in it, the field trace can be used to construct such a basis in also (see the article on Gaussian periods). Then in the case of squarefree and odd, is a compositum of subfields of this type for the primes dividing (this follows from a simple argument on ramification). This decomposition can be used to treat any of its subfields.

 proved a converse to the Hilbert–Speiser theorem:

:Each finite tamely ramified abelian extension of a fixed number field has a relative normal integral basis if and only if .

There is an elliptic analogue of the theorem proven by . 
It is now called the Srivastav-Taylor theorem .

<text>The Engineering Education Scheme is a scheme run in the United Kingdom by the Engineering Development Trust to promote the education of school students about engineering. It is part of the Royal Academy of Engineering&#x27;s &quot;BEST&quot; programme.

The Engineering Education Scheme is an annual event which can run for over a year after the start. It begins with a launch day in September or October which are held in regional batches. By this point the schools will have selected their team(s) (normally made up of 4 students) who will take part. At the launch the team is put together with their company (for example Kodak or Ford, however one of the largest contributors is the Royal Navy) and their company gives them a real life challenge that they would otherwise be working on. They are also given presentations by the scheme&#x27;s organisers as to exactly what they need to do. For the next 6 months the team works on the project. They get help from their teachers as well as visits from engineers from their companies who discuss their ideas with them. They may also visit the factory of their company. At the start of January the team will spend 3 days at a university having lectures from engineering professors and using the facilities to test their designs.

The scheme finishes at a &#x27;Celebration and Assessment Day&#x27; where the teams show off their completed design at a stand along with their report which is usually about 40-80 pages long. They also give a presentation to the assessors. Often their design is actually used by the company who gave it to them. At the end of the event they are awarded a bronze, silver, gold or platinum award for their efforts. The platinum award is especially prestigious as it is awarded very infrequently. Students involved in the award often go on to read engineering at University, and the scheme is often a factor contributing to successful entry; due to the level of difficulty its completion is highly regarded by admissions tutors.

==Actual examples of projects==
*&quot;Design a bridge&quot;
*&quot;Design a machine for rolling protective plastic over photographic film&quot;
*&quot;Investigate and cost energy sources, including renewable for a new factory&quot;
* &quot;Design and build a prototype of a device to measure the draught of a submarine&quot;
* &quot;Design a wind turbine.&quot;

<doc id="1067680" wikidata="Q4041683" url="?curid=1067680" title="Ivans Xtc">
<text>ivansxtc is a 2000 British-American independent drama film co-written by Bernard Rose and Lisa Enos, produced by Enos and directed by Rose, the first of several Enos-Rose collaborations, including &quot;Snuff-Movie&quot; (2005), &quot;Kreutzer Sonata&quot; (2008) and &quot;Mr. Nice&quot; (2010). The film stars Danny Huston, Peter Weller, and Lisa Enos, with Rose and Enos&#x27; actual CAA agent, Adam Krentzmen, playing the role of fictional &quot;Media Talent Agency&quot; agent Barry Oaks. Other key roles include Morgan Walsh (Vukovic) as Lucy Lawrence, and &quot;SLC Punk&quot; director James Merendino as director Danny McTeague.

The story follows a Hollywood agent, Ivan Beckman (Huston), who must force a smile and carry on with business as usual with the agency&#x27;s biggest client, Don West (Weller), in the face of a cancer diagnosis. The film, loosely based on Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s 1886 novella &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&quot;, was also inspired by the rise and fall of talent agent Jay Moloney.

==Cast==
* Danny Huston as Ivan Beckman, a successful film agent working in Los Angeles
* Peter Weller as Don West, Beckman&#x27;s client
* Lisa Enos as Charlotte White
* James Merendino as Danny McTeague
* Adam Krentzman as Barry Oaks
* Sarah Danielle Madison as Naomi
* Tiffani Thiessen as Marie Stein
* Dan Ireland as Ted Zimblest
* Lisa Henson as Margaret Mead
* Hal Lieberman as Lloyd Hall
* Valeria Golino as Constanza Vero
* Angela Featherstone as Amanda Hill
* Victoria Silvstedt as Melanie

==Production==
Filming took place in July 1999 in Sherman Oaks and Los Angeles, and was originally intended as a &quot;Dogme 95&quot; film in which the key collaborators (Enos, Rose, DP Ron Forstye, Production Coordinator Morgan Vukovic, etc.) would be credited as &quot;The Filmmakers&quot;. It was shot at 60i fps on the Sony HDW-700A HD video format digital camera, which proved problematic for theatrical distribution.

==Release==
On its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, the film was ranked at #71, behind &quot;The Salton Sea&quot;, &quot;The Singles Ward&quot; and a re-release of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Ivans Xtc&quot; received mostly positive reviews. On film aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 77% rating, with an average score of 6.8/10, sampled from reviews from 30 critics. It scored a 67/100 (citing &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;) on Metacritic, based on reviews from 14 critics.

<doc id="1067681" wikidata="Q5132115" url="?curid=1067681" title="Cleveland Crunch">
<text>The Cleveland Crunch is an American professional indoor soccer club located in Cleveland, Ohio. 

Formed in 1989 as an expansion team in the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL), the Crunch played a total of 16 seasons in three separate leagues under two different names. The team played three seasons in the original MISL, later known as the Major Soccer League (MSL), before joining the rival National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) in 1992. After nine seasons in the NPSL (including winning three league titles - 1994, 1996, 1999), the team joined a second incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) in 2001. In 2002, the team was rebranded the Cleveland Force in honor of the former team of the same name. After four seasons in the second MISL, the team folded in 2005.

The Cleveland Crunch franchise was revived in 2020. The team joined Major Arena Soccer League 2 MASL 2) for the 2021 season (winning the MASL 2 championship) and then joined Major League Indoor Soccer (MLIS) for its 2023 season, winning the MLIS Championship in 2024. All totaled, the Crunch recognizes all five championships won under the various incarnations of the franchise (three NPSL, one MASL 2, one MLIS).

==History==

=== Founding of the Cleveland Crunch ===
The original Cleveland Force team had folded on July 22, 1988. Akron businessmen George S. Hoffman and Stuart Lichter formed an ownership group; named Al Miller general manager; and named former Force star Kai Haaskivi player-coach. Miller and Haaskivi brought back many players who had been fan favorites during the Force&#x27;s height of popularity in the mid-1980s. The Crunch&#x27;s home arena was originally the Richfield Coliseum.

Near the end of the Crunch&#x27;s first season, Miller engineered a trade that would help Cleveland make the championship finals in seven of the next 10 years. He sent veteran forward Paul Wright to the San Diego Sockers for Zoran Karic, a feisty forward who immediately hit it off with Cleveland star Hector Marinaro. Within weeks, they were dubbed the &quot;Dynamic Duo&quot; and together rewrote the scoring record books for the next decade.

=== Move to NPSL and Three Championships ===
In 1992 the Crunch joined the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL) where it made a name for itself as a dominating soccer club, winning three championships in five seasons.

When the original MISL ceased operation in the summer of 1992, the Crunch, Baltimore and Wichita joined the rival NPSL as &quot;expansion teams&quot;. All were permitted to keep only six players, then fill the rest of their rosters in an expansion draft of players made available by other NPSL teams. 

The NPSL, in an effort to promote the sport in the United States, had a cap of two non-Americans allowed on a roster. Canadian-born Marinaro and Serbia native Karic filled that quota immediately. Besides Marinaro and Karic, holdovers from the MISL Crunch were midfielders Tommy Tanner and Andy Schmetzer, defender George Fernandez and young goalkeeper Otto Orf.

Orf had only a 14–32 record the previous three years with the club as backup to P.J. Johns. Before switching leagues, Miller had signed four-time NPSL goalkeeper of the year Jamie Swanner from the Canton Invaders. That contract was voided when the Crunch entered the NPSL. Swanner and several ex-Invaders signed as free agents with another expansion team, the Buffalo Blizzard. New Crunch coach Gary Hindley wanted Orf as his starter, citing the big keeper&#x27;s strong throwing arm as an offensive weapon. He wanted Orf getting the ball to Marinaro and Karic with outlet passes at the team&#x27;s new home, the CSU Convocation Center, where the playing surface was considerably smaller than at the Richfield Coliseum.
Orf became a 25-game winner, Marinaro and Karic shattered all scoring records, and Cleveland advanced to the league finals, where it lost to the Kansas City Attack, three games to two. 

A year later, the Crunch finally broke through to win Cleveland&#x27;s first championship in any pro sport in 30 years. Marinaro scored the dramatic game-winner in double overtime as Cleveland overcame a 15–10 deficit to defeat the visiting St. Louis Ambush, 17–15, to take the series, three games to one. The team went on to win two more championships, in the 1995-96 and 1998-99 seasons.

Lichter faded from view when the MISL folded and Hoffman became even more active as owner during the Crunch&#x27;s almost yearly run to the finals. Hoffman eventually sold his interest to a Cleveland group headed by Richard Dietrich. Soon after, the NPSL reorganized itself as the new Major Indoor Soccer League in 2001. The team took on the old Cleveland Force name in 2002.

=== Franchise revival ===
In 2020, a new ownership group announced it was reviving the Cleveland Crunch brand, after the team&#x27;s 18-year hiatus, and returning professional indoor soccer to Cleveland. 

The team joined the Major Arena Soccer League 2 (MASL 2) for the 2021 season. In its first season back, the team earned the Cleveland Crunch&#x27;s fourth league title, defeating the Wichita Wings 11-6 to win the MASL 2 Championship.

In 2023, the team moved to Major League Indoor Soccer (MLIS) winning the MLIS Championship in 2024, and giving the franchise its overall fifth title (from three different leagues) in team history.

<text>CherryOS was a PowerPC G4 processor emulator for x86 Microsoft Windows platforms, which allowed various Apple Inc. programs to be operated on Windows XP. Announced and made available for pre-orders on October 12, 2004, it was developed by Maui X-Stream (MXS), a startup company based in Lahaina, Hawaii and a subsidiary of Paradise Television. The program encountered a number of launch difficulties its first year, including a poorly-reviewed soft launch in October 2004, wherein &quot;Wired Magazine&quot; argued that CherryOS used code grafted directly from PearPC, an older open-source emulator. Lead developer Arben Kryeziu subsequently stated that PearPC had provided the inspiration for CherryOS, but &quot;not the work, not the architecture. With their architecture I&#x27;d never get the speed.&quot;

After further development, CherryOS 1.0 was released in its final form on March 8, 2005, with support for CD, DVD, USB, FireWire, and Ethernet. It was described as automatically detecting &quot;hardware and network connections&quot; and allowing &quot;for the use of virtually any OS X-ready application,&quot; including Safari and Mail. Estimated to be compatible with approximately 70 percent of PCs, MXS again fielded accusations that CherryOS 1.0 incorporated code from PearPC. MXS argued CherryOS was &quot;absolutely not&quot; a knockoff,&quot; and that though &quot;certain generic code strings and screen verbiage used in Pear PC are also used in CherryOS... they are not proprietary to the Pear PC product.&quot; Shortly afterwards the creators of PearPC were reported to be &quot;contemplating&quot; litigation against Maui X-Stream, and on April 6, 2005, CherryOS was announced to be on hold. A day later, CherryOS announced that &quot;due to overwhelming demand, Cherry open source project launches May 1, 2005.&quot;

==History==
===Background and development===
On October 12, 2004, the emulator CherryOS was announced by Maui X-Stream (MXS), a startup company based in Lahaina, Hawaii and a subsidiary of Paradise Television. At the time MXS was best known for developing software for video streaming, particularly their VX3 encoder. As a new emulator intended to allow Mac OS X to be utilized on x86 computer architecture, CherryOS was advertised as working on Windows 98, Windows 2000 or Windows XP, with features such as allowing files to be dragged from PC to Mac, the creation of multiple profiles, and support for networking and sound. With development led by MXS employee and software developer Arben Kryeziu, CherryOS was made available for pre-order on the MXS website.

Some articles hailed CherryOS as a new potential competitor for programs such as MacWindows, while the &quot;Irish Times&quot; would later write that certain groups of consumers &quot;were suspicious as to how a little-known Hawaii-based outfit... could suddenly do something that had evaded much larger firms.&quot; In explaining the suspicion, Ars Technica later noted that emulators by small developers like PearPC had reputations for working extremely slowly, meaning CherryOS&#x27;s claim of operating 80 percent of the host PC&#x27;s speed would have been &quot;a major breakthrough&quot; in the industry. When asked by the &quot;Star Bulletin&quot;, at this point Kryeziu denied any possibility that CherryOS would contain code from a rival program like Apple, MacWindows, Emulators.com, or PearPC, stating that &quot;our lawyers have looked at this and say we&#x27;re in the clear. We wrote this from scratch and we&#x27;re clean as a whistle.&quot;

According to the &quot;Star Bulletin&quot;, suspicions that CherryOS might be a hoax &quot;were fanned&quot; by glitches on the CherryOS home website, and three days after the site opened for pre-sales it crashed after taking 300,000 daily hits. MXS president Jim Kartes crediting the crash on both unexpected high traffic and Mac &quot;purists&quot; who had hacked and destroyed the servers, and though MXS continued to accept non-digital pre-orders, by October 19 the CherryOS website was offline entirely as MXS switched to a new web host.

===Pre-release version===
Initially the company did not offer a trial version of CherryOS, citing concerns the code might be pirated. However, &quot;as a direct result of the overwhelming response to our October 12 announcement,&quot; as of October 15 the company was readying a free beta version with a projected release date of November 25, 2004. On October 18, Kryeziu stated that a free public demo would be released within a week, and CherryOS was first registered to be trademarked in the United States on October 19, 2004. On October 19, however, Kryeziu withheld a timetable for the CherryOS release, stating the company had been pre-emptive in releasing the earlier &quot;soft launch&quot; version, and that CherryOS still had too many software bugs to predict a release date. &quot;Wired News&quot; reviewed a pre-release version around this time, reporting on October 22 that an expert had found distinguishing &quot;watermarks&quot; from PearPC&#x27;s source code in CherryOS. Moreover, the pre-release version was reviewed to run at the same slow speed as PearPC, though &quot;Wired&quot; noted &quot;they&#x27;ve actually done some work on it. They&#x27;ve written a whole graphical interface that makes [PearPC] easier to use.&quot;

In response to the article, MXS stated that the edition tested by &quot;Wired&quot; had been a &quot;very bad...premature version&quot; that &quot;is not CherryOS,&quot; and that one of the CherryOS programmers had since been fired for directly grafting elements of PearPC code into the release. A competing emulator, PearPC been released the year before under the GNU General Public License, which allows commercial products to use the software for profit under &quot;certain conditions, such as acknowledging previous work.&quot; Kryeziu stated PearPC had provided the inspiration for CherryOS, but &quot;not the work, not the architecture. With their architecture I&#x27;d never get the speed I got.&quot; He argued that some similarities between CherryOS and PearPC were a result of &quot;the fact that they were designed to perform similar functions,&quot; and that &quot;there are some functionalities that can only be done a certain way, and names are going to be similar or identical.&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; senior editor Leander Kahney posited that if the final CherryOS release did contain PearPC code, PearPC would be unlikely to sue Maui X-Stream for &quot;a cut of any profits since open-source codes are protected more by an honor system than any legal basis.&quot; By October 22, Kryeziu stated to &quot;Wired&quot; that he&#x27;d been contacted by Apple Computer for an undisclosed reason that &quot;wasn&#x27;t bad.&quot;

===CherryOS 1.0 release===
After a delay, CherryOS 1.0 was released in its final form on March 8, 2005. Maui-X Stream initially offered a free copy for evaluation on its website, with 14 boot allowances and five free days per copy. According to MXS president Jim Kartes, within the first few days the free version was downloaded 100,000 times. Stated Kartes to the &quot;Mac Observer&quot; on March 8, 2005, &quot;there has been a lot of misinformation about this product... I think we have proven those skeptics wrong.&quot; Initial reports of certain computers encountering slow speeds and glitches were explained by MXS as &quot;expected,&quot; as &quot;it&#x27;s got bugs. That is why we&#x27;re offering a free trial download. If it doesn&#x27;t work, they shouldn&#x27;t buy it... we will use the testing of consumers to improve its stability and performance.&quot; Kartes extrapolated that after development, somewhere between &quot;60% and 70% of all PC owners&quot; would be able to use the CherryOS product. MXS announced plans to market CherryOS throughout the summer of 2005, but withheld specifics on when it would be released for sale.

BetaNews.com reviewed CherryOS upon its public release, arguing that there were again similarities between CherryOS and PearPC, including specific non-generic lines of code. Maui X-Stream president Jim Kartes denied that CherryOS had grafted in PearPC code, and on March 24, 2005, a spokesperson for CherryOS stated to the &quot;Irish Times&quot; that CherryOS 1.0 was &quot;absolutely not&quot; a knockoff of Pear PC, as &quot;there are considerable differences between the two products: Both products emulate the Apple operating system but the similarity ends there.&quot; The spokesperson further explained that &quot;certain generic code strings and screen verbiage used in Pear PC are also used in CherryOS. They are not proprietary to the Pear PC product. For example, Pear tops out at G3 emulation and CherryOS is the only stable G4 emulator on the market today. CherryOS uses multithreading architecture for speed and ease of use. Pear employs a step-by-step approach; CherryOS features a shared-drive emulator, a drag-and-drop option allows you to connect the Windows drive to a Mac environment and CherryOS is the only emulator to support sound.&quot; Kartes further stated that although PearPC introduced their code before CherryOS, that &quot;doesn&#x27;t give them a claim on certain technical aspects of our product.&quot;

On March 30, 2005, Ars Technica reported that the creators of PearPC were &quot;contemplating&quot; litigation against Maui X-Stream. On April 6, 2005, Cherry OS was announced by its developers to be on hold &quot;until further notice.&quot; A day later, CherryOS announced on its website that it would no longer be a commercial product, and that &quot;due to overwhelming demand, Cherry open source project launches May 1, 2005.&quot; The trademark for CherryOS was filed as abandoned as of June 21, 2006.

==Technical features==

===Overview===
CherryOS was a PowerPC G4 processor emulator for x86 Microsoft Windows platforms. Originally written to work with Windows 98, Windows 2000 or Windows XP, among other features Cherry OS purported to allow files to be dragged from PC to Mac, the creation of multiple profiles, support skins, and support for networking and sound. In October 2004, the program&#x27;s developer announced CherryOS as having &quot;full network capabilities&quot; and &quot;complete access to the host computer&#x27;s hardware resources - hard drive, CPU, RAM, FireWire, USB, PCI, PCMCIA bus, Ethernet networking and modem.&quot; By October 21, 2004, the program was reported to be a 7 MB download with Velocity Engine included. At the time, MMX stated they were developing 3D acceleration for CherryOS.

The program was publicly released on March 8, 2005, with support for CD, DVD, USB, FireWire, and Ethernet. It was described as automatically detecting &quot;hardware and network connections&quot; and allowing &quot;for the use of virtually any OS X-ready application,&quot; including Safari and Mail by Apple. Estimated to be compatible with approximately 70 percent of PCs, the CherryOS system required a Pentium 4 1.6 gigahertz (GHz) CPU or equivalent hardware and Windows XP, as well as 512 megabytes of memory and 3 gigabytes of hard drive space. After the initial March 8 release, speed of CherryOS 1.0 was reported to be variable. Karol McGuire of MXS stated that speed was depended on computer processor, as &quot;a processor that has inadequate space on the hard drive or that runs at less than optimum operating speeds will not allow CherryOS to perform as designed.&quot; Following the public launch, the company announced that Kryeziu would be overseeing development on &quot;sound support and network bridging, as well as improving speed.&quot; Kryeziu explained &quot;we think we&#x27;ll have the first two issues solved fairly soon. It&#x27;s the type of product that will be continually updated as we go along. We think we can make it faster than it is right now, but this will take time.&quot;

===Apple TOS===
For its year in development, there was some question in the press as to the legality of CherryOS in relation to Apple&#x27;s &quot;Use and Restrictions&quot; agreement, which only allows Apple programs to be used on a singular &quot;Apple-labeled computer&quot; at one time. The publication Ars Technica notes, however, that &quot;a PPC emulator [like CherryOS or PearPC] isn&#x27;t just for violating ToS agreements and bringing down the wrath of Apple Legal. It has legitimate uses too... you could use an emulator to run a PPC version of Linux on x86 hardware, and you could even use a P2P network to get that distribution of Linux, justifying two technologies with one rationalization.&quot; Despite this fact, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; pointed out that CherryOS was marketed exclusively to run Mac OSX, which it argued was &quot;clear&quot; violation of the OS X license agreement.

<text>The Word was a Channel 4 variety show in the United Kingdom that aired from 1990 to 1995.

==Format==
The show&#x27;s presenters included Terry Christian, comedian Mark Lamarr, Dani Behr, Katie Puckrik, Jasmine Dotiwala, Alan Connor, Amanda de Cadenet and Huffty. Originally broadcast in the old &quot;Tube&quot; time slot of 6 pm Friday evenings, &quot;The Word&quot;&#x27;s main live show was shifted to a late-night timeslot from 9 November 1990. The magazine format allowed for interviews, live music, features and even game shows. The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial.

There was also an &#x27;I&#x27;ll do anything to be on TV&#x27; section called &quot;The Hopefuls&quot; which ran for half of series 4 and half of series 5 in which people did generally repulsive things in order to get featured on the programme.

==Production==
The show was the brainchild of Charlie Parsons and Terry Christian, the name of the show coming from Christian&#x27;s Page covering up and coming Manchester bands in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; which he started writing in the autumn of 1989 called The Word Is Terry Christian and appeared in the paper every Friday evening . |The show originally had a working title of Club X2 and was originally produced for series 1 and 2 by the production company 24 Hour Productions, which later became Planet 24.

Paul Ross was the series editor on series 3 and 4, and became executive producer for series 5. Jo Whiley worked as a researcher/band booker on series 2 and half of series 3 and is credited as having given Nirvana their historic and notorious first TV appearance.

The programme ran for five series from 1990 to 1995. From the start, there was considerable tabloid backlash against the show. In mid 2000, Channel 4 screened a short-running compilation series titled &quot;Best of The Word&quot;, which mostly featured music performances.

Tango sponsored the show in 1994.

==Notable moments==
* Nirvana&#x27;s international television debut performance of &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, with Kurt Cobain declaring Courtney Love to be &quot;the best fuck in the world.&quot;
* Singer/guitarist Donita Sparks of L7 removing her jeans and underwear during a performance, the full-frontal nudity displayed when she drops her guitar being briefly broadcast.
* The TV debut of Oasis playing &quot;Supersonic&quot;.
* Rage Against the Machine playing &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;, resulting in a stage invasion with guitarist Tom Morello and singer Zack de la Rocha both being stopped from performing by the chaotic crowd.
* Lynne Perrie, best known for her role as Ivy Tilsley in soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, performing a tuneless rendition of the Gloria Gaynor song &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.
* A very drunk Oliver Reed giving a barely coherent interview before performing &quot;Wild Thing&quot; by The Troggs with Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin.&quot;
* Shabba Ranks advocating crucifixion of homosexuals, which met with universal condemnation including an onscreen retort from presenter Lamarr.

<text>The Hong Kong Film Awards (HKFA; ), founded in 1982, is an annual film awards ceremony in Hong Kong. The ceremonies typically take place in April, and have mostly been held at the Grand Theatre of the Hong Kong Cultural Centre since 1991. The awards recognise achievement in various aspects of filmmaking, such as directing, screenwriting, acting and cinematography. The awards are regarded as the Hong Kong equivalent of the Academy Awards.

The HKFA, incorporated into Hong Kong Film Awards Association Ltd. since December 1993, are currently managed by a board of directors, which consists of representatives from thirteen professional film bodies in Hong Kong. Voting on eligible films for the HKFA is conducted January through March every year and is open to all registered voters, which include local film workers as well as critics, and a selected group of adjudicators.

==General rules==
The Hong Kong Film Awards are open to all Hong Kong films which are longer than an hour and commercially released in Hong Kong within the previous calendar year. A film qualifies as a Hong Kong film if it satisfies two of the three criteria, namely: the film director is a Hong Kong resident, at least one film company is registered in Hong Kong, and at least six persons of the production crew are Hong Kong residents. Since 2002, the HKFA also feature a Best Asian Film category, which accepts non-Hong Kong films which are commercially released in Hong Kong.

In January each year, a first round of election, open to all registered voters and a selected group of 100 professional adjudicators, is held to determine the five nominees for each award category. In the rare case where there is a tie between two nominees within the top five slots, six nominees will be allowed. Nominations are usually announced in February, after which a second round of election is held to determine the winner. Voting in the second round is open to a group of 50 professional adjudicators, Executive Committee members of the HKFA, as well as members of the thirteen professional film bodies. Each voting group holds a percentage of the ultimate score for each nominee, and each film body holds a higher share in the categories associated with it.

<doc id="1067695" wikidata="Q3664258" url="?curid=1067695" title="Celia Thaxter">
<text>Celia Thaxter (née Laighton; June 29, 1835 – August 25, 1894) was an American writer of poetry and stories. For most of her life, she lived with her father on the Isles of Shoals at his Appledore Hotel. How she grew up to become a writer is detailed in her early autobiography (published by &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;), and her book entitled &quot;Among the Isles of Shoals&quot;. Thaxter became one of America&#x27;s favorite authors in the late 19th century. Among her best-known poems are &quot;The Burgomaster Gull&quot;, &quot;Landlocked&quot;, &quot;Milking&quot;, &quot;The Great White Owl&quot;, &quot;The Kingfisher&quot;, and &quot;The Sandpiper&quot;. Many of her romantic poems are addressed to women; as such, she has been identified by some scholars as a lesbian poet.

==Early years and education==
Celia Laighton was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, June 29, 1835, but the family moved soon after to the Isles of Shoals, first on White Island, where her father, Thomas Laighton, was a lighthouse keeper of the Isles of Shoals Light, and then on Smuttynose and Appledore Islands. The gradual addition of summer visitors to the fishing population came slowly, Thaxter&#x27;s father being the first to establish anything like a modern hotel.

The means of education were comparatively remote, and the permanent society of the islands for the greater part of the year offered very limited resources for a bright child. During the period of 1849–1850, she attended Mount Washington Female Seminary in South Boston.

==Career==
===Mainland===
On September 13, 1851, at the age of 16, she married Levi Thaxter and moved to the mainland, residing first in Watertown, Massachusetts, at a property his father owned. In 1854, they accepted an offer to use a house in Newburyport. The couple then acquired their own home, today called the Celia Thaxter House, built in 1856 near the Charles River at Newtonville. By then, they had two sons, Karl and John. Roland was born in 1858, and went on to become a prominent mycologist who taught at Harvard University where he studied insect-associated fungi and Myxobacteria.

Her first published poem was written during this time on the mainland. That poem, &quot;Land-Locked&quot;, was first published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1861 and earned her . In 1879, Thaxter suddenly became known upon the literary horizon with a collection of poems entitled &quot;Driftwood&quot;, and considering that they came from a group of islands, away from the mainland far enough to prevent frequent communication, the debuting work was received with almost as much surprise as pleasure. Although stray poems of the ocean had been published, signed with the name of &quot;Celia Thaxter&quot;, still it was difficult for the critical reviewer of Boston to realize that the bearer of this name was actually a long time resident, if not exactly a native of those isles lying off the coast of New Hampshire. Her poetry appeared in the &quot;Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Century&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Independent&quot;, &quot;New England Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, while her writing for juvenile audiences appeared in &quot;Our Young Folks&quot; and &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;.

===Return to Appledore Island===

Karl, who had mental illness since childhood, traveled with Thaxter during the periods she returned to the islands, while the two younger sons traveled with the husband to Florida after his serious illness in 1868–69. Her life with Levi was not harmonious, and there were other periods of separation, She missed her islands, and so after ten years away, Thaxter moved back to Appledore Island. She became the hostess of her father&#x27;s hotel, the Appledore House, and welcomed many New England literary and artistic notables to the island and to her parlor, including writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Whittier, Sarah Orne Jewett, and the artists William Morris Hunt and Childe Hassam, the latter of whom painted several pictures of her. The watercolorist Ellen Robbins also painted the flowers in her garden. Celia was present at the time of the infamous murders on Smuttynose Island, about which she wrote the essay &quot;A Memorable Murder&quot;.

William Morris Hunt, a close family friend, spent the last months of his life on Appledore Island, trying to recover from a crippling depression. He drowned in late summer 1879, three days after finishing his last sketch. Celia Thaxter discovered the painter&#x27;s body, an apparent suicide. That same year, the Thaxters bought 186 acres (75 hectares) along Seapoint Beach on Cutts Island, Kittery Point, where they built a grand Shingle Style &quot;cottage&quot; called Champernowne Farm. In 1880, they auctioned the Newtonville house, and removed to Kittery Point, Maine. In 1881, she vacationed in Europe with her brother, Oscar. In the same year, Thaxter and her husband moved to the new home in Kittery Point. In March 1888, her friend Whittier hoped &quot;on that lonesome, windy coast where she can only look upon the desolate, winter-bitten pasture-land and the cold grey sea&quot; she could be comforted by &quot;memories of her Italian travels&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Thaxter died suddenly while on Appledore Island. She was buried not far from her cottage, which burned in the 1914 fire that destroyed The Appledore House hotel. The Kittery Point home stayed in the family until the 1989 death of her granddaughter and biographer, Rosamond Thaxter. In 2008, The Library of America selected &quot;A Memorable Murder&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime.

==Themes==

Several of her poems are noted for their lesbian themes. Thaxter&#x27;s &quot;Two Sonnets,&quot; addressed to a woman, parallels the romantic passion present in Wharton&#x27;s sonnet sequence &quot;The Mortal Lease,&quot; addressed to a man. Thaxter frequently brings together natural imagery and romantic desires; in the poem &quot;Alone,&quot; she writes &quot;I would have given my soul to be That rose she touched so tenderly!&quot;

Thaxter has done for the sea-shore and the varied aspects of ocean views and the rocky isles of her home, what Whittier has done for the milder aspects of the river on whose banks he dwelt. As he may be said to have exhausted the descriptive beauties of the Merrimac, Thaxter appears to have left nothing unsaid of the varying features of the ocean, whose waves were forever beating at her feet. With the minutest attention to detail; with the keenest observation for shades of difference; with an almost superfine susceptibility to climatic and meteorological changes, so that she might be termed a realist in word-painting, she at the same time possessed the glow and the imagination of the impressionist. Thus we see in her art the happy combination of the two schools. Certainly no one can read her poems without the conviction of certainty that she had seen with her own eyes what she described. There is something beyond the photographic accuracy of experienced observation always to be observed even in her simplest poems. She saw something more than the mere external forms of nature, and however much she may have delighted in these, it was not her sole object to reproduce them for other eyes. Beyond and within the external, she perceived the actuating soul: and it was this quality which gave the greatest value to her pictures of sea and shore.

Because Thaxter wrote so well of the sea, her graphic imagery impressed some critics with the idea that she wrote of nothing else. This was untrue: her poems were not confined to the sea, as will be remembered with the story of &quot;A Faded Glove,&quot; &quot;Remonstrance,&quot; &quot;Piccola,&quot; and scores of other verses giving land pictures; not to mention her musical sonnets on Beethoven and other great masters of composition.

Thaxter was happy to have attracted, very early in her literary career, the sympathy and admiration of some of the best writers and critics of the day: among the most enthusiastic of her admirers, was Thomas Wentworth Higginson, a scholar, who was also a lover of the sea, and one of the most competent judges of ocean nature painting of literati from that time. He failed to discover any lack of versatility in her work, and those who study her works as a whole, will note that there is hardly a moral idea, a practical point in ethics, or an emotion of the human heart, which has not been the subject of her pen, touched upon at least, with more or less freedom.

==Style==
In Thaxter&#x27;s prose writing, the picturesque prevails, though with some marked exceptions; in all is a moral undercurrent which crops out more or less prominently in all of her productions—prose or poetry. She wrote some charming poems for children, with such an exquisite blending of the didactic with the scenic and emotional, that the intended lesson was conveyed without exciting the natural repulsion of children to &quot;morals,&quot; too obviously conveyed.

<text>Fred Roy Harris (November 13, 1930 – November 23, 2024) was an American politician from Oklahoma who served from 1957 to 1964 as a member of the Oklahoma Senate and from 1964 to 1973 as a member of the United States Senate.

Harris was elected to the Oklahoma Senate after graduating from the University of Oklahoma College of Law. He ousted the appointed U.S. Senate incumbent, J. Howard Edmondson, and won a 1964 special election to finish Robert S. Kerr&#x27;s term, narrowly defeating football coach Bud Wilkinson. Harris strongly supported the Great Society programs and criticized President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s handling of the Vietnam War. He was reelected in 1966 and declined to seek another term in 1972.

From 1969 to 1970, Harris chaired the Democratic National Committee. In the 1968 presidential election, Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey strongly considered him as his running mate. Harris unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972 and 1976. After 1976, he was a professor at the University of New Mexico.

==Early life==
Harris was born on November 13, 1930, in Cotton County, Oklahoma, near Walters, Oklahoma, the son of Eunice Alene (Pearson) and Fred Byron Harris, a sharecropper. His parents disagreed on whether his middle name should be &quot;Ray&quot; or &quot;Roy&quot;, and his handwritten birth certificate was ambiguous, allowing Harris to choose; he eventually used his mother&#x27;s preferred name, Roy.

Harris attended the University of Oklahoma (OU) on a scholarship, graduating in 1952 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and political science. He then entered the OU law school, where he was administrative assistant to the dean and successively book editor and managing editor of the &quot;Law Review&quot;. The August 1956 issue contained his first published article. He received the LL B. degree with distinction and was admitted to the bar in 1954.

Harris was elected to the Oklahoma Senate in 1956 and served in it until 1964. For most of that time, he was one of its youngest members. During his tenure he introduced legislation to prohibit race discrimination in state employment. He made an unsuccessful bid for governor of Oklahoma in 1962, which made him better known throughout the state.

==U. S. senator==
In 1964, Harris ran to serve the remainder of the Senate term of Robert S. Kerr, who had died in office. With Kerr&#x27;s family&#x27;s support, he defeated former governor J. Howard Edmondson, who had appointed himself to succeed Kerr, in the Democratic primary. The general election was a high-profile campaign against the Republican nominee, legendary Oklahoma Sooners football coach Bud Wilkinson. Both parties invited political leaders from out of state to campaign for their nominees. Republicans brought former Vice President Richard Nixon to campaign for Wilkinson, while Harris hosted President Lyndon B. Johnson and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson. Harris defeated Wilkinson, by 21,390 votes, becoming one of the youngest members of the U.S. Senate. At 33 years old, he was the youngest senator-elect in Oklahoma history. His Senate tenure began on November 4, 1964.

Harris firmly supported President Johnson&#x27;s Great Society programs, which were often unpopular in Oklahoma. He voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and while he missed the votes pertaining to the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967 (he was away on official Senate business) and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (he was absent because of illness), he supported both; it was announced on the Senate floor that, if he had been present, he would have voted for Marshall&#x27;s confirmation and the 1968 Act. Harris was present for the vote on the motion to end the filibuster conducted by senators who opposed the 1968 Act, and voted to end the filibuster so that the Act could be voted on.

In July 1967, Johnson appointed Harris to the Kerner Commission. He quickly became one of its most active members and was deeply concerned about economically deprived Black urban residents. He also strongly supported agricultural programs, the Arkansas River Navigation Program, and the Indian health programs, which were all very popular in Oklahoma.

Despite being quite liberal in an increasingly conservative state, Harris was elected to a full term in 1966, defeating attorney Pat J. Patterson, by 47,572 votes. Patterson had tried to unseat Harris by announcing his support for a constitutional amendment proposed by Senator Everett Dirksen to allow school boards to provide for prayers in public schools. Dirksen&#x27;s amendment had enthusiastic political support in Oklahoma, but Harris opposed it in a public letter: &quot;I believe in the separation of church and state and I believe prayer and Bible reading should be voluntary&quot;.

Harris briefly chaired the Democratic National Committee, preceded and succeeded in that position by Larry O&#x27;Brien. He was one of the final two candidates presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey considered as his running mate in 1968; Humphrey chose U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie because of Harris&#x27;s young age of 37. According to O&#x27;Brien, Humphrey vacillated between the two until finally choosing Muskie at the last minute. Harris broke with Johnson and Humphrey over the Vietnam War.

In 1970, Harris was a major player in the legislation to restore to the inhabitants of the Taos Pueblo 48,000 ac (19,425 ha) of mountain land that President Theodore Roosevelt had taken and designated as the Carson National Forest early in the 20th century. The struggle was particularly emotive since this return of Taos land included Blue Lake, which the Pueblo consider sacred. To pass the bill, Harris forged a bipartisan alliance with President Richard Nixon, with whom Harris sharply disagreed on numerous other issues, notably the Vietnam War. In doing so, he had to overcome powerful fellow Democratic Senators Clinton Anderson and Henry M. Jackson, who firmly opposed returning the land. As recounted by Harris&#x27;s wife, LaDonna, who was actively involved in the struggle, when the bill finally passed and came up to be signed by the president, Nixon looked up and said, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m signing a bill that was sponsored by Fred Harris.&quot;

In 1971, Harris was the only senator to vote against confirming Lewis F. Powell Jr. as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. He opposed Powell because he considered him elitist and to have a weak record on civil rights.

Harris called for the abolition of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

==Presidential campaigns==
Harris did not seek another Senate term in 1972 and instead ran for president, but failed to attract support and ended his campaign after only 48 days. He ran again four years later; both his campaigns were populist and centered on what he called &quot;economic democracy&quot;. He also supported abortion rights, desegregation busing, and disbanding the Central Intelligence Agency. To keep expenses down, he traveled the country in a recreational vehicle and stayed in private homes, giving his hosts a card redeemable for one night&#x27;s stay in the White House upon his election. He emphasized issues affecting Native Americans and the working class. His interest in Native American rights was linked to his ancestry and that of his first wife, LaDonna Harris, a Comanche who was deeply involved in Native American activism.

After a surprising fourth-place finish in the 1976 Iowa caucuses, Harris coined the term &quot;winnowed in&quot;, saying, &quot;The winnowing-out process has begun and we have just been &#x27;winnowed in&#x27;.&quot; He won more than 10% of the vote, pushing Mo Udall, who at one point led the polls, into fifth place. Harris was &quot;winnowed out&quot; just over a month later. He finished fourth in the New Hampshire primary and, a week later, third in Vermont and fifth in Massachusetts. Harris remained in the contest for another month, with his best showing a fourth-place finish in Illinois, with 8%. He suspended his campaign on April 8, 1976.

==Later life==

Harris left electoral politics for academia after 1976. He became a professor of political science at the University of New Mexico and wrote many books on political subjects, including &quot;Potomac Fever&quot; (Norton, 1977 ) and &quot;Deadlock or Decision: The U.S. Senate and the Rise of National Politics&quot; (Oxford University, 1993 ). In 2003, Harris was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. He also wrote three novels. He lived in Corrales, New Mexico.

Harris remained active well into his final years. In a 2023 interview, he expressed support for President Joe Biden, saying concerns about Biden&#x27;s age were unfounded, and strongly criticized former President Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the consequent January 6 United States Capitol attack. The next year, he and his wife attended the 2024 Democratic National Convention in support of the Democratic ticket. His last book, a memoir titled &quot;Report from a Last Survivor&quot;, was published by the University of New Mexico Press in September 2024.

== Personal life and death==
Harris married LaDonna Harris, born LaDonna Crawford, in 1949, and they had three children. They divorced in 1981, and he married Margaret Elliston the next year.

Harris died at a hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on November 23, 2024, 10 days after his 94th birthday. He was the last living former U.S. senator who left office in the 1970s.

<doc id="1067707" wikidata="Q1805920" url="?curid=1067707" title="Large Millimeter Telescope">
<text>The Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) (, or GTM), officially the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano (), is the world&#x27;s largest single-aperture telescope in its frequency range, built for observing radio waves in the wave lengths from approximately 0.85 to 4 mm. It has an active surface with a diameter of and of collecting area.
The telescope is located at an altitude of on top of Sierra Negra, the fifth-highest peak in Mexico and an extinct volcanic companion to Mexico&#x27;s highest mountain Pico de Orizaba, inside the National Park Pico de Orizaba in the state of Puebla. It is a binational Mexican (70%) – American (30%) joint project of the Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica (INAOE) and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Millimetre-wavelength observations using the LMT give astronomers a view of regions which are obscured by dust in the interstellar medium, thus increasing our knowledge of star formation. The telescope is also particularly fitted for observing solar system planetesimals and planets as well as extra-solar protoplanetary disks which are relatively cold and emit most of their radiation at millimetre wavelengths.

The mission of the LMT is to: 1) pursue pioneering research, 2) train future generations of scientists and engineers, and 3) develop new technology for the benefit of society. The LMT mainly studies thermally cold objects, most of which are associated with large amounts of cosmic dust and/or molecular gas. Among the objects of interest are comets, planets, protoplanetary discs, evolved stars, star-forming regions and galaxies, molecular clouds, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), high-redshift galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and the cosmic microwave background.

The LMT has a bent Cassegrain optical system with a 50m-diameter reflecting primary surface (M1) formed by 180 segments distributed in five concentric rings. The number of segments in the rings, from the center of the dish to the outside, are: 12, 24 and 48 in the three outermost rings. Each segment is connected to the structure of the telescope through four actuators, allowing for an active reflecting primary surface. In addition, each segment is formed by eight precision electro-formed nickel sub-panels. The reflecting secondary surface (M2) has a 2.6-m diameter, also built by nine electro-formed nickel sub-panels, and is attached to the telescope with an active hexapod that allows precise focus, lateral offsets, and tilts. The hexapod is attached to the telescope through a metal tetrapod. Finally, the reflecting tertiary surface (M3) is almost flat, elliptical with a 1.6-m major axis and delivers the light beam to the receivers.

==History==
INAOE and UMass-Amherst signed the agreement to develop the Large Millimeter Telescope project on 17 November 1994, but construction of the telescope did not begin until 1998. The first observations were taken in June 2011 at 1.1 and 3 mm using the AzTEC camera and Redshift Search Receiver (RSR), respectively. In May 2013, the Early Science phase began, producing over a dozen scientific articles. The official name of the LMT was changed to &quot;Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano&quot; on 22 October 2012 in order to honour the initiator of the project, Alfonso Serrano Pérez-Grovas.

== Instrumentation ==
The set of LMT instrumentation is built by heterodyne receivers and broad-band continuum cameras, some of them still under development:

===Broad-band continuum===
;TolTEC

TolTEC is a three-band imaging polarimeter which completed laboratory testing and was installed on the LMT in December of 2021, later undergoing commissioning in several phases up to 2023. TolTEC can image the sky at three (1.1, 1.4 and 2.1 millimetre) bands simultaneously using 7000 polarization-sensitive kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). Each TolTEC observation produces nine independent images - measuring total intensity (I) and two Stokes parameters (Q and U) in all three bands. Because of the nearly ubiquitous presence of dust in our universe, TolTEC&#x27;s science reach includes cosmology, the physics of clusters, galaxy evolution and star-formation along the history of the Universe, the relation between the star-forming process and the molecular clouds, small bodies of the Solar System, and much more. The instrument is designed to be capable of rapid mapping of the sky and is capable of a rate of mapping in excess of eight times greater than the decommissioned AzTEC instrument. The TolTEC Project is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).

=== Heterodyne Receivers ===
;SEQUOIA 

SEQUOIA operates in the range 85–116 GHz band using a cryogenic focal-plane array of 32 pixels arranged in dual-polarized 4×4 arrays fed by square horns separated by 2 fλ. The arrays are cooled to 18K and use low-noise Indium Phosphide (InP) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) preamplifiers designed at UMass to provide a characteristic receiver noise of 55K in the range 85–107 GHz, increasing to 90K at 116 GHz.

;Redshift Search Receiver (RSR)

A novel MMIC-based receiver designed to maximize the instantaneous receiver bandwidth to cover the 90 GHz atmospheric window from 75 to 110 GHz in a single tuning. The receiver has four pixels arranged in a dual-beam and dual polarized configuration. Orthogonal polarizations are combined in waveguide-based orthomode transducers. Beam-switching at 1 kHz on the sky is achieved using a fast Faraday rotation polarization switch and a wire-grid to interchange the reflected and transmitted beams to each receiver. This ultra-wide-band receiver typically achieves noise temperatures &lt; 50K between 75 and 110 GHz. The Redshift Search Receiver has exceptional baseline stability because it does not involve mechanical moving parts, therefore being well-suited to the detection of redshifted transitions of the CO ladder from star-forming galaxies at cosmological distances. An innovative wide-band analog autocorrelator system which covers the full 38 GHz with 31 MHz (100 km/s at 90 GHz) resolution serves as the backed spectrometer.

=== Decommissioned ===
;AzTEC

The AzTEC millimetre camera was developed to operate at 1.1mm. It is formed by a 144 silicon nitride micromesh bolometer array arranged in a compact hexagonal package and fed by an array of horns separated by 1.4 fλ. The detectors are cooled down to ~250 mK inside a 3He closed-cycle cryostat, achieving a ~3 mJy Hz-1/2 pixel sensibility. The AzTEC field of view at the LMT is 2.4 arcminutes square and manages to take completely sampled images through telescope or reflecting secondary surface movements.

<doc id="1067710" wikidata="Q663318" url="?curid=1067710" title="Mahishasura">
<text>Mahishasura (, ) is a bovine asura in Hinduism. He is depicted in Hindu literature as a deceitful demon who pursued his evil ways by shape-shifting. Mahishasura was the son of the asura Rambha and the brother of buffalo-demoness named Mahishi. He was ultimately killed by the goddess Durga with her trishula (trident) after which she gained the epithet Mahishasuramardini (&quot;Slayer of Mahishasura&quot;). Mahishasura had a son named Gajasura.

The Navaratri (&quot;Nine Nights&quot;) festival eulogises this battle between Mahishasura and Durga, culminating in Vijayadashami, a celebration of his ultimate defeat. This story of the &quot;triumph of good over evil&quot; carries profound symbolism in Hinduism, particularly Shaktism, and is both narrated as well as reenacted from the Devi Mahatmya at many South and Southeast Asian Hindu temples.

The &quot;Mahishasura Mardini Stotra&quot; by Adi Shankara was written to commemorate her legend.

== Legend ==

Mahishasura is a Sanskrit word composed of &quot;Mahisha&quot; meaning &quot;buffalo&quot; and &quot;asura&quot; meaning &quot;demon&quot;, translating to &quot;buffalo demon&quot;. As an asura, Mahishasura waged war against the devas, as the devas and asuras were perpetually in conflict. Mahishasura had gained the boon that no man could kill him. In the battles between the devas and the demons (asuras), the devas, led by Indra, were defeated by Mahishasura. Subjected to defeat, the devas assembled in the mountains where their combined divine energies coalesced into the goddess Durga. The newborn Durga led a battle against Mahishasura, riding a lion, and killed him. Thereafter, she was named Mahishasuramardini, meaning &quot;The Killer of Mahishasura&quot;. According to the Lakshmi Tantra, it is the goddess Lakshmi who slays Mahishasura instantaneously, and extolling her feat is described to offer everlasting supremacy.

Mahishasura&#x27;s legend is told in the major texts of the Shaktism traditions known as the Devi Mahatmya, which is part of Markandeya Purana. The story of Mahishasura is told in the chapter where Markandeya is narrating the story of the birth of Savarnika Manu. Per the Markandeya Purana, the story of Mahishasura was narrated in the second Manvantara (approximately 1.3 billion years ago, as per the Vishnu Purana) by Maharishi Medha to a king named Suratha. Mahishasura is described as an evil being who can change his outer form, but never his demonic goals. According to Christopher Fuller, Mahishasura represents the forces of ignorance and chaos hidden by outer appearances. The symbolism is carried in Hindu art found in South Asia and South-East Asia (e.g., Javanese art), where Durga is shown as a serene, calm, collected and graceful symbol of good as she pierces the heart and kills the scared, overwhelmed and outwitted Mahishasura.

==Art==

Durga slaying Mahishasura is a prominent theme which was sculpted in various caves and temples across India. Some of the prominent representations are seen at the Mahishasuramardini caves in Mahabalipuram, the Ellora Caves, in the entrance of Rani ki vav, Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebidu and many more temples across India. The worship of Durga during Durga Puja in Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Odisha and other eastern states is represented in &quot;Pandal&quot; which depict Durga killing Mahishasura. The legend of Mahishasura has also been inspiration for films, plays and dance dramas.

==Etymology of Mysore==

The popular legend is that Mysore (Mahishooru) gets its name from Mahishasuramardini, a manifestation of goddess Durga. The buffalo demon Mahishasura, states the regional tradition, had terrified the local population. It is believed that goddess Durga (Chamundeshwari) killed Mahishasura on top of the Chamundi Hills. The spot was constructed as the Chamundeshwari Temple in Mysuru, an event that is annually celebrated at Navaratri and Mysuru Dasara. The British Era in India saw the name change to &quot;Mysore&quot; and later Kannadized back into &quot;Mysuru&quot;.

The temple of the city&#x27;s guardian deity, Chamundeshvari, has a giant statue of Mahishasura on the hill facing the city. The earliest mention of Mysore in recorded history may be traced to 245 B.C., i.e., to the period of Ashoka when on the conclusion of the third Buddhist convocation, a team was dispatched to &quot;Mahisha Mandala&quot;.

<text>Aerocar International was a roadable aircraft manufacturer, founded by Moulton Taylor in Longview, Washington. Work continued until the late 1960s, when changing legislation made Taylor&#x27;s designs impractical.

==History and background==
Moulton Taylor was a former naval commander, and is credited with flying and demonstrating the first guided missile. In 1947, he produced the first conceptual drawings for the Aerocar, and in 1948, he began development. The first model built was backed with a $50,000 investment from 49 investors. The first Aerocars were manufactured on a custom basis, and were priced at $12,000, approximately $7000 more than the cheapest light plane in 1951. There were seven Aerocars built from 1950 through 1967, in two different versions. The interior in both versions were cramped, with only fourteen cubic feet of baggage space over the engine compartment. Aerocar I had the capability to cruise at 100+ mph and its range was 300 miles on a 23.5 gallon fuel tank. On the road, its speed was 55-60 mph.

Moulton wanted to mass produce the Aerocar in order to make it more affordable, so he entered into an agreement with Ling-Temco Enterprises in 1961, in Dallas, Texas for production. According to Moulton, the company accepted $278,000 in pre-order deposits and absconded with the money. Taylor sued the company and was involved in a two-year lawsuit in an attempt to retrieve the money. Taylor was never successful in producing the Aerocar on a mass scale, he says, because of the Federal Aviation Administration and their costly regulations, which would govern the industry.

<text>Edna Clara Best (3 March 1900 – 18 September 1974) was a British actress.

==Early life==
Born in Hove, Sussex, England, she was educated in Brighton and later studied dramatic acting under Miss Kate Rorke who was the first professor of Drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London.

==Career==
Best was known on the London stage before she entered films in 1921, having made her debut at the Grand Theatre, Southampton, in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; in 1917. She also won a silver swimming cup as the lady swimming champion of Sussex. She appeared with husband Herbert Marshall in John Van Druten&#x27;s 1931 play &quot;There&#x27;s Always Juliet&quot; on both Broadway and London. 

For Gainsborough Pictures, she starred in the melodramas &quot;Michael and Mary&quot; and &quot;The Faithful Heart&quot; alongside her husband. She is best remembered for her role as the mother in the original 1934 film version of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;. Her subsequent roles were a mixture of British and Hollywood productions. Her other film credits include &quot;&quot; (1939), &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1940), &quot;The Late George Apley&quot; and &quot;The Ghost and Mrs. Muir&quot; (both 1947), and &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot; (1948).

Best received a nomination for an Emmy Award in 1957 for her role in the &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; adaptation of &quot;This Happy Breed&quot;. She had appeared on television as early as 1938 in a live production of &quot;Love from a Stranger&quot;, adapted from the Agatha Christie short story &quot;Philomel Cottage&quot; by Frank Vosper.

==Personal life==
Best was married three times and divorced twice.

Her first marriage to William Seymour Beard ended in divorce in 1928. The London Divorce Court gave Beard custody of the couple&#x27;s twins (James and John Beard) in granting the divorce &quot;owing to the misconduct of his wife, Miss Best, with Mr. Marshall.&quot; The Mr. Marshall was actor Herbert Marshall, whose divorce from Hilda Lloyd Marshall (&quot;owing to the misconduct of her husband ... with ... Miss Edna Best&quot;) was granted in the same court session. Best later was married to Marshall from 28 November 1928 until 1940, and they had a daughter, actress Sarah Marshall. She married talent agent Nat Wolff on 7 February 1940 in Las Vegas. The judge &quot;who granted the divorce [from Marshall] after a five-minute closed hearing, performed the marriage a few minutes later.&quot;

Best suffered a stroke in 1959.

==Recognition==
In 1960, Best was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star located at 6124 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Death==
She died in Geneva, Switzerland in 1974 at age 74.

<text>Gold Medal is the sixth studio album by American rock band the Donnas, released on 26 October 2004 through Atlantic Records. Leading up to an appearance at the Lollapalooza 2003 festival, drummer Torry Castellano suffered from De Quervain Tendonitis, prompting wrist surgery. The band began rehearsing slower-tempo material, allowing guitarist Allison Robertson to experiment with her playing style. Following a false-start with Scott Litt, the band started working with producer Butch Walker. Sessions were held at Black in Back and Conway Recording Studios, Hollywood, California in June and July 2004. &quot;Gold Medal&quot; is a hard rock album that continues the sound of their fifth studio album &quot;Spend the Night&quot;.

&quot;Gold Medal&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics, some praising the band&#x27;s musicianship and specifically highlighting Robertson&#x27;s guitar playing, while others felt it lacked lyrical substance. The album sold over 13,000 copies in its first week of release, peaking at number 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot; was released as the lead single in October 2004, and the band promoted the album with the US tour at the end of 2004. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know (If You Don&#x27;t Want Me)&quot; was released as the second single from the album in March 2005, which was followed by a supporting slot for Maroon 5 on the Honda Civic Tour.

==Background and recording==
The Donnas released their fifth studio album &quot;Spend the Night&quot; in October 2002. Its lead single &quot;Take It Off&quot; peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern rock radio chart. Their profile grew when they appeared on covers for magazines, as well as perform on TV shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Total Request Live&quot;. In preparation for Lollapalooza 2003, drummer Torry Castellano began suffering from De Quervain Tendonitis. They continued touring with Castellano receiving cortisone injections, until she reached the point where she was forced to stop playing. The band took an extended break from touring from September 2003 as Castellano had wrist surgery. Post-operation, they started rehearsing material for their next album in 2004, opting to play slower-tempo songs as Castellano was still recovering. Guitarist Allison Robertson said this choice allowed her to &quot;explore parts that had more funk and feeling&quot; to them.

Around this time, the band&#x27;s label Atlantic Records was undergoing personnel changes stemming from the company&#x27;s owner Warner Music Group switching investors. The band met with several people, before landing on Scott Litt; they travelled from the Bay Area to Los Angeles to start pre-production with him in January 2004. They liked his work with R.E.M. and assumed the partnership would be a good experience based on prior conversations they had. though any work proved fruitless. Upon meeting up, the band realised Litt wanted a different sound than what they were aiming for. From a selection of four-to-five people, they came across Butch Walker, who had recently completed sessions with Avril Lavigne. He was aware there had been some form of disagreement between Litt and the band, and that they wanted to show some growth as a unit.

Walker and the band spent sometime discussing music they liked growing up and what they wanted to takeaway from their influences. In June and July 2004, the band and Walker recorded drums at Black in Back studio, before moving to Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. Paul David Hager served as the main engineer throughout recording, while Seth Waldman, Tony Rambo and Lars Fox acted as assistant engineers. As Castellano was still recovering, the rest of the band recorded their parts first. Chris Lord-Alge mixed the recordings at Image Recording Studios, also in Hollywood, with assistant engineers Keith Armstrong and Dmitar Kranjaic. Emily Lazar then mastered the album at The Lodge in New York City, with assistant engineer Sarah Register.

==Composition==
&quot;Gold Medal&quot; continues the hard rock sound of &quot;Spend the Night&quot;; while influences from AC/DC and the Ramones can still be heard, the band also incorporate portions from Alice Cooper, Golden Earring and Steppenwolf. &quot;Uncut&quot; writer Stephen Dalton described it as 1970s rock &quot;pastiche meets revved-up sugar-rush melodies, cynical teen-romance lyrics and knowingly dumb sexual innuendo&quot;. Bassist Maya Ford &quot;Spend the Night&quot; was &quot;all fast and hard [...] we limited ourselves&quot;; for &quot;Gold Medal&quot;, they decided they &quot;should do just what ever we want to do and experiment&quot;. Discussing the album&#x27;s title, Robertson said: &quot;To us, it&#x27;s going for what &quot;we&quot; think is the gold. On each song we just went with what sounded best instead of going, &#x27;Oh, the Donnas would never do that.. They collaborated together instead of letting one individual do a bulk of the writing, resulting in a more melodic sound, aided by Walker&#x27;s past production work with Lavigne and Simple Plan.

The opening track to &quot;Gold Medal&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know (If You Don&#x27;t Want Me)&quot;, talks about a disintegrating relationship and is reminiscent of the work of Ash. It is followed by the mid-tempo hard rock track &quot;Friends Like Me&quot;, which evokes the sound of the Stooges and the Who. The metallic &quot;Don&#x27;t Break Me Down&quot; discusses trying to make a relationship work after having moved on quickly from past partners. &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot; recalls the band&#x27;s earlier sound, while being compared to the work of the Cult; it starts off akin to Status Quo, switching to &quot;Rocket Queen&quot; (1987) by Guns N&#x27; Roses. Robertson said it dealt with bands that get ahead of others by luck, only to be forgotten in a short timeframe thereafter. The softer-sounding &quot;Is That All You&#x27;ve Got for Me&quot; marked the first time the band uses acoustic guitars in their music, adding elements of rockabilly. Unlike the rest of the album, &quot;The Gold Medal&quot; features a piano and acoustic guitar break in lieu of an electric guitar solo. Ford referred to the song as a fuck you&#x27; to San Francisco. We live there, but have never really fitted into the city&quot;. The blues-indebted &quot;Out of My Hands&quot; tackles the theme of a long-distance relationship. Kel Munger of &quot;News &amp; Review&quot; said the power ballad &quot;Revolver&quot; is an &quot;ode to love gone truly, truly bad&quot;.

==Release==
On August 9, 2004, &quot;Gold Medal&quot; was announced for release in two months&#x27; time; a few days later, a music video was filmed for &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot; in Los Angeles, California. They played a small number of club shows on the West Coast, prior to appearing at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK. &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot; was posted online on September 1, 2004, and was released as a single on 11 October 2004. &quot;Gold Medal&quot; was released on October 26, 2004; coinciding with this, the band members dropped their Ramones-esque stage names in favor of their actual names. Initial promotion was focused on reaching fans through online advertisements and listening parties.

&quot;Gold Medal&quot; was one of the first albums released in the DualDisc format, alongside &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; (2004) by Simple Plan, but was recalled due to a mastering error on the CD side of the album. Warner Music Group provided the affected song on the band&#x27;s website and allowed buyers to return it for a standard CD copy. The DVD side of it included the album in 5.1 surround sound, the music video for &quot;Fall Behind Me&quot;, a behind-the-scenes feature on that video, in addition to lyrics for the album&#x27;s tracks. The band embarked on a tour of the US throughout November 2004, with support from the Von Bondies and the Starlite Desperation. In January 2005, the band performed at Big Day Out in Australia. On January 26, 2005, the music video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know (If You Don&#x27;t Want Me)&quot; was posted online. The track was released as a single on 7 March 2005. That same month, the band performed at the South by Southwest music conference. They then supported Maroon 5 on the Honda Civic Tour until May 2005.

==Reception==

&quot;Gold Medal&quot; was met with generally favourable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 70, based on 22 reviews.

AllMusic reviewer Zac Johnson said that what the band &quot;lack in &#x27;wall of sound&#x27; noise attack they&#x27;ve made up for in nuance; the basslines have never been more intricate, [...] and the whole album sports the most terrific production of any Donnas record to date&quot;. &quot;This Is Fake DIY&quot; reviewer Stephen Ackroyd compliment their &quot;smooth, thought out, structured&quot; sound, with tracks that were &quot;less vitriolic, more melodic&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer David Browne added to this: &quot;With their well-scrubbed sound [...] and Anderson&#x27;s evenkeeled delivery, the Donnas are now a likable, proficient band&quot;. Anthony Miccio of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; added to this by writing that they seem &quot;incapable of playing in anything but the key of badass&quot;, and &quot;The Japan Times&quot;″ Philip Brasor said it relied more on &quot;craft than attitude&quot;. 

The staff at &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that Robertson&#x27;s guitarwork has improved with each subsequent release, &quot;gut here she&#x27;s really tearing it up, giving &quot;Gold Medal&quot; a more dynamic feel&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Jenny Eliscu expanded on this, writing that Robertson was &quot;wailing on solos that would make AC/DC&#x27;s Angus Young proud&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; editor Adam Williams said Robertson &quot;anchors the album with muscular riffs throughout&quot;. &quot;Lollipop Magazine&quot; writer Ari M. Joffe, on the other hand, said Robertson&#x27;s &quot;blazing guitar playing&quot; had been &quot;either completely stripped away, or toned way down&quot;. The staff said at &quot;E! Online&quot; said the &quot;tempos are sluggish and the lyrics are emotionally vacant&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; shared a similar sentiment, stating: &quot;The recycled riffs and too-easy lyrical cheese are occasionally still in play&quot;. Dalton said that while they be &quot;shamelessly role-playing their Joan Jett schtick,&quot; the band &quot;still out-rock earnest retrobores like Jet and Kings Of Leon&quot;.

&quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; Christopher Gray praised the members for being confident musicians, however, they had switched from &quot;carefree party girls to jaded cynics practically overnight&quot;. &quot;Rock Hard&quot; reviewer Marcus Schleutermann wrote that what they had &quot;undoubtedly gained in profile,&quot; they had &quot;lost the obvious hit factor&quot;. Joffe said the album was &quot;devoid of any of the grit the band once possessed&quot;, coming across as formulaic. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; writer Liz Worth said the album &quot;gives off a clean, pop-studded sound, but falls a little flat&quot; when compared to their previous works, and aside from a few highlights, &quot;much of the album blurs together&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Dorian Lynskey wrote that whether the change is sound has &quot;done them good, though, is debatable&quot;, spotlighting the &quot;lyrical sourness [that has become] less bothersome than their AC/DC posturing&quot;.

&quot;Spend the Night&quot; was successful at MTV and radio, and co-manager Molly Neuman hoped &quot;Gold Medal&quot; would do as well. It sold over 13,000 copies in its first week of release, reaching number 76 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. By June 2007, the album has sold 87,000 copies in the US; 79,000 of these were sold in its first year, under-selling &quot;Spend the Night&quot; first year sales of 360,000. Neuman theorised that the latter had a &quot;real pop visibility and a pop fan base. But that&#x27;s a transient fan base—they love it and then leave it. They&#x27;re not going to be lifelong fans&quot;. She also attributed the drop to the failure of the DualDisc format, which she felt may have dismayed fans.

<text>The Körös () or Criș () (German: &quot;Kreisch&quot;) is a river in eastern Hungary and western Romania. Its length is from the confluence of its two source rivers Fehér-Körös (&quot;Crișul Alb&quot;) and Fekete-Körös (&quot;Crișul Negru&quot;) to its outflow into the Tisza. Its drainage basin area is . It has three source rivers, all with their origin in the Apuseni Mountains in Transylvania, Romania: Crișul Alb (Fehér-Körös), Crișul Negru (Fekete-Körös) and Crișul Repede (Sebes-Körös). The confluence of the rivers Fehér-Körös (&quot;Crișul Alb&quot;) and Fekete-Körös (&quot;Crișul Negru&quot;) is near the town Gyula. The Körös downstream from Gyula is also called the Kettős-Körös (Hungarian for &quot;double Körös&quot;). 37.3 km further downstream, near Gyomaendrőd, the Sebes-Körös (&quot;Crișul Repede&quot;) joins the Körös/Criș. The section downstream from Gyomaendrőd is also called the Hármas-Körös (Hungarian for &quot;triple Körös&quot;). The Körös flows into the Tisza River near Csongrád.

It was known in antiquity as the &quot;Chrysus&quot;, &quot;Crisus&quot;, &quot;Crisia&quot;, &quot;Grisia&quot;, or &quot;Gerasus&quot;.

<doc id="1067738" wikidata="Q1755408" url="?curid=1067738" title="Luxury tax">
<text>A luxury tax is a tax on luxury goods: products not considered essential. A luxury tax may be modeled after a sales tax or VAT, charged as a percentage on all items of particular classes, except that it mainly directly affects the wealthy because the wealthy are the most likely to buy luxuries such as expensive cars, jewelry, etc. It may also be applied only to purchases over a certain amount; for instance, some U.S. states charge luxury tax on real estate transactions over a certain limit.

A luxury good may be a Veblen good, which is a type of good for which demand increases as price increases. Therefore, the effect of a luxury tax may be to increase demand for certain luxury goods. In general, however, since a luxury good has a high income elasticity of demand by definition, both the income effect and substitution effect will decrease demand sharply as the tax rises.

==Theory==
Luxury tax is based on the concept of positional goods, which are scarce goods whose value arises as status symbols largely from their ranking against other positional goods. This creates a zero-sum game in which the absolute amount of goods purchased is less relevant than the absolute amount of money spent on them and their relative positions. Agents competing in such a game for pure positional goods do not lose utility if some of this money is taken as tax, because their utility comes as status from the amount of money (displayed to be) spent rather than the use-value of the goods themselves. For a pure positional good, a luxury tax is the perfect form of taxation because it raises revenue without reducing the utility of those paying the tax. 

==History==
In Britain, authorities taxed windows – the window tax – from 1696 to 1851.
France imposed window taxes
from 1798 to 1926.

In the United States, many states used to collect state sales-tax through the use of &quot;luxury tax tokens&quot;, instead of calculating a percentage to be paid in cash like the modern-day practice. Tokens could be purchased from the state and then used at checkouts instead of rendering the sales tax in cash. Some tokens were copper or base metal, while some were even plastic.

== By country ==
=== Bulgaria ===
A luxury tax of 10% on boats over $300,000 and aircraft over $1 million was proposed in 2010 by finance minister Simeon Djankov. Parliament approved the tax for a temporary 3-year period.

=== Norway ===
In Norway, at the beginning of the 20th century, oil-powered cars, sugar products, and chocolates were viewed as luxury goods. Today few Norwegians consider sugar or chocolate a luxury, but the luxury taxes on these goods remain.

=== United States ===
In November 1991, The United States Congress enacted a luxury tax and was signed by President George H. W. Bush. The goal of the tax was to generate additional revenues to reduce the federal budget deficit. This tax was levied on material goods such as watches, expensive furs, boats, yachts, private jet planes, jewelry and expensive cars. Congress enacted a 10 percent luxury surcharge tax on boats over $100,000, cars over $30,000, aircraft over $250,000, and furs and jewelry over $10,000. The federal government estimated that it would raise $9 billion in excess revenues over the following five-year period. However, only two years after its imposition, in August 1993, at the behest of the luxury yacht industry, President Bill Clinton and Congress eliminated the &quot;luxury tax&quot; citing a loss in jobs. The luxury automobile tax remained in effect until 2002.

In sports, the Luxury tax is the incremental tax team owners have to pay for their teams going over the salary cap, basically a financial penalty for high-spending teams.

A common misconception is that tampons and other menstrual products are taxed as a &quot;luxury item&quot; because they are subject to sales tax in 30 states as of February 2021. In actuality, they are simply subject to the normal state sales tax rate in states where they are not tax exempt. Such tax exempt consumer products vary from state to state, but are usually limited to food, prescription drugs, and more rarely, clothing.

==In popular culture==
One of the squares on the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game (U.S. edition) is labeled &quot;luxury tax&quot;. While there is a picture of a sparkling diamond ring on the square, the only effect is that whoever lands on this square must pay $75.00 to the bank.

In the 1961 film &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot;, the salesman at Tiffany&#x27;s tells Holly Golightly and Paul that the &quot;federal tax&quot; referring to the 10 percent luxury tax then in effect was not required on a particular item they were considering as a purchase.

<doc id="1067739" wikidata="Q1917280" url="?curid=1067739" title="Monkton, Kent">
<text>Monkton is a village and civil parish in the Thanet District of Kent, England. The village is located at the south-west edge of the Isle of Thanet and is situated mainly along the B2047 road, leading off the A253 road between Canterbury and Ramsgate. The civil parish stretches south to the River Stour and northwards towards Acol. The hamlet of Gore Street is included in the parish.

==Community==
Monkton was subject to an explosion during 2007, and was largely evacuated as a result. Kent Fire and Rescue Service said that crews were faced with &quot;a well developed fire in a large single-storey building&quot;, which was among the largest in the village.

Monkton Nature Reserve, run by the environmental charity, Thanet Countryside Trust, is situated on chalk hills to the north of the village. The reserve is set in a abandoned chalk quarry which has been reclaimed by nature. It is notable for its geology and many important habitats, a pond and rare orchids. It also houses the Thanet Astronomical Observatory and the first artificial bat cave built in the UK. Facilities include field centre with a museum, reference library, bookshop and picnic site.

Monkton Church of England Primary School is situated in the village. The school was purpose built in 1872 and was extended and modernised in 2007. It currently teaches 109 pupils from 4 to 11 years. In 2007 the school achieved an Ofsted Inspection rating of Grade 2 &#x27;Good&#x27; overall.

==Church==
The 12th-century Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Mary Magdalene, and was largely rebuilt in the 15th century. This included the north porch and an extension of the tower, taking it to its current height; the north aisle was also blocked up, as well as new windows inserted. A church on the site was recorded on the Domesday survey, and the church is the smallest of the remaining seven ancient Thanet churches. The roof dates to the 15th century also. The churchyard is surrounded by stone walls, with multiple gates to enter through.

<doc id="1067742" wikidata="Q2440140" url="?curid=1067742" title="Tom Stewart (politician)">
<text>Arthur Thomas Stewart (January 11, 1892October 10, 1972) was a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1938 to 1949.

==Early life and education==

Stewart was born in Dunlap, Tennessee. Stewart also had a sister called Lydia. He attended the former Pryor Institute, a private school, in Jasper, Tennessee and Emory College (now Emory University). He returned to Tennessee and attended Cumberland University&#x27;s law school in Lebanon, Tennessee. Upon admission to the bar in 1913, he set up practice in Birmingham, Alabama. He moved back to Jasper, Tennessee in 1915 and practised there until 1919, then moved to Winchester, Tennessee.

==Legal career==

In private practice in Winchester, he was elected district attorney for the former 18th Circuit for a term beginning in 1923. He served in this position until 1939. As a consequence, in 1925 Stewart was the chief prosecutor in the Scopes Trial. Stewart designed the prosecution&#x27;s argument to preserve political control over the schools exclusively within the state legislature, thereby keeping the trial to the narrow, legal matters and forestalling attempts by the defense to introduce scientific testimony or to show there was not a conflict between evolution and the story of divine creation set forth in &quot;Genesis&quot;. Except for the willingness of William Jennings Bryan (hired by a Christian fundamentalist group to assist with the prosecution) to be cross-examined by Clarence Darrow, Stewart&#x27;s positions controlled the trial and the Scopes defense had no recourse but to ask the jury to convict the defendant so the case could be appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court (which overturned the conviction on a legal technicality but upheld the constitutionality of the Butler Act).

==Political career==

In 1938 Stewart entered the race for the balance of the unexpired term of the late Senator Nathan L. Bachman, who had died in office. In the August Democratic primary he defeated labor union leader George L. Berry, who had been appointed to the seat upon Bachman&#x27;s death by Governor Gordon Browning, and was elected Senator on November 8. Eligible to begin serving immediately, he instead waited until the expiry of his term as district attorney on January 16, 1939 to take his Senate seat.

Stewart was somewhat typical of the Democratic Party&#x27;s Southern wing of that era. He has been considered to be at least somewhat an ally of Memphis political boss E. H. Crump, but less so than Tennessee&#x27;s other Senator of the time, Memphian Kenneth McKellar. Unlike some of the other Southern Senators, however, Stewart was also a staunch pro-Roosevelt New Dealer and was the only successful Senator to win a primary and purge an incumbent Senator whom Roosevelt targeted in the 1938 midterm election &quot;purge.&quot; Stewart was reelected in 1942. In that year, shortly after the beginning of Japanese internment, he introduced a bill in the Senate to revoke citizenship from all American-born persons of Japanese ancestry. In 1948, he was challenged for renomination by Estes Kefauver, a progressive East Tennessean who defeated him. Edward J. Meeman, the influential editor of the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot;, supported Kefauver to undermine the Crump machine, with which Meeman had long been at odds. After he defeated Stewart, Kefauver then handily prevailed over the Republican nominee, B. Carroll Reece.

Stewart returned to the private practice of law. He died in Nashville and was interred at Winchester&#x27;s Memorial Park Cemetery.

<doc id="1067746" wikidata="Q917493" url="?curid=1067746" title="Still Not Getting Any...">
<text>Still Not Getting Any... is the second studio album by Canadian rock band Simple Plan. It was released on October 26, 2004, by Lava Records. The album garnered a positive reception, but critics were unsure of the band&#x27;s musicianship and lyricism in their given genre. &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; debuted at number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned four singles: &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot;, &quot;Shut Up!&quot;, &quot;Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?)&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot;. It was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of over one million copies.

==Background and production==
Simple Plan released their debut album, &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot;, in March 2002 through major labels Lava and Atlantic Records. It was promoted with support slots for Sugar Ray, Blink-182, Green Day and Avril Lavigne, and went on two stints of the Warped Tour, leading up at August 2003. Due to the frequent touring schedule, the band had around three months to write ten new songs for their next album. Drummer Chuck Comeau and vocalist Pierre Bouvier argued frequently as a result of the short time they had. The pair wrote material in Vancouver, Canada, and recorded demos using the Reason software. By the end of the year, they had 10–15 rough ideas for new songs. In January and February 2004, they went on a co-headlining tour with MxPx; after the tour, the band began recording their next album.

Sessions were held at Studio Piccolo in Montreal, Canada, with producer Bob Rock. Him and Eric Helmkamp acted as engineers; Helmkamp and Mathieu Roberge served as digital engineers. Rock explained to the band upon meeting them that he wanted to do &quot;&quot;The Black Album&quot;, but with our songs&quot;, as Bouvier described. He expanded on this, saying the record had a &quot;really clean yet intense and powerful sound.&quot; Subsequently, the band went with a bigger and more open drum sound, with Rock using as many as five different microphone placements for the kick drum alone. The band briefly took a break to play two shows in July and August, before finishing the album in September. The recordings were mixed by Randy Staub with assistance from Zach Blackstone at Warehouse Studios in Vancouver, Canada. George Marino mastered the album at Sterling Sound.

==Composition==
All of the tracks on &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; were credited to the band. While it has been tagged as pop-punk, the group placed less emphasis on this genre, instead opting for a straightforward rock sound. The band continued the upbeat mood of &quot;No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls&quot; with tracks such as &quot;Thank You&quot;, &quot;Jump&quot; and &quot;Promise&quot;, while &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot;, &quot;Perfect World&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot; were mid-tempo tracks. &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Untitled&quot; were written during the final days of recording. Both songs featured string arrangements by Bob Buckley. Bill Sample played piano on &quot;Untitled&quot;; Desrosiers played additional drums on it. The lyrics, which recalled Linkin Park, conveys the theme of teenage angst.

The opening track &quot;Shut Up!&quot; talks about ignoring critics and following one&#x27;s dream. &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; discusses growing up and living one&#x27;s life. The track is in half-time and was compared to Avril Lavigne. It starts off with acoustic guitars, with power chords coming in during the chorus sections. &quot;Perfect World&quot; continues the half-time signature, before switching into a military-esque drumming pattern and programmed drum rolls. &quot;Thank You&quot; is a sarcastic retort to a back-stabbing best friend. &quot;Me Against the World&quot; was the heaviest song the band had written, which was the result of Bouvier listening to Thrice at the time. The chorus section was cribbed from &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; by Nirvana. Bouvier said &quot;Crazy&quot; could&#x27;ve been much longer had they written about more topics, instead talking about the money gap between rich and poor people, the objectification of women in the media, and the stereotypes they&#x27;re expected to live up to.

&quot;Jump&quot; evokes the song of the same name by Van Halen while also sounding like Sum 41. Comeau said it was in the vein of 311, and is followed by the Ryan Adams-indebted &quot;Everytime&quot;. &quot;One&quot; discusses the topic of alienation; the guitars are played alongside a violin section. Its title is taken from the Metallica track of the same name.The band initially disliked the first version of the song, before rewriting it with a dancehall-like rhythm influenced by Sean Paul. The closing track &quot;Untitled&quot; is a ballad in the vein of Foreigner. The band called it &quot;Untitled&quot; simply as they were unable to come up with anything else. It is anchored by a piano and opens with a string section.

==Release==
While recording was still underway, &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; was announced on August 20, 2004, for release in October. &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; was made available for streaming through AOL.com on September 6, before being sent to radio on September 13. The CD version included live versions of &quot;Addicted&quot; and &quot;The Worst Day Ever&quot;. &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; was released on October 26 through Lava Records; the same day it was made available for streaming through MTV&#x27;s website. The artwork sees the band sitting in the back of a bus; some versions used alternative covers with the members in their 40s or in a retirement home. The booklet continues this theme: the band becoming progressively older, accomplished via prosthetics and makeup.

Some copies were released with a bonus DVD or a DualDisc, which included the whole album in 5.1 surround sound, a discography listing, lyrics and photos. An outtake from the recording sessions, &quot;If I Die Tomorrow&quot;, was recorded by Mötley Crüe and released on their &quot;Red, White &amp; Crüe&quot; (2005) compilation.

A music video was filmed for &quot;Shut Up!&quot; in December with director by Erik White. It features the band walking to a gig, passing through an upscale neighborhood and a hotel. The members perform in a ballroom, jump from tables and destroy ice sculptures, which shifts to them performing at a club. &quot;Shut Up! was released as a single on January 25, 2005. The CD version included an acoustic version of &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; and live version of &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;.

&quot;Untitled&quot;, now re-titled &quot;Untitled (How Could This Happen to Me?)&quot;, was released as a single on March 29, 2005. The CD version included live versions of &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; and &quot;Jump&quot;. The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Marc Klasfeld and tackles the issue of drunk driving. Bouvier acts as a ghost walking around the remains of a two-car collision. With rain pouring down, a girl is shown trapped against the steering wheel. The other members of the band show up as police and EMTs as they attempt to free the girl. It was promoted with the band appearing in several public service announcements for Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

On October 4, 2005, the band release the live/video album &quot;MTV Hard Rock Live&quot;, which featured acoustic versions of &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; and &quot;Crazy&quot; as bonus tracks. &quot;Crazy&quot; was released as a single on October 17. The CD version included a live version of &quot;Crazy&quot;, and MTV performances of &quot;Shut Up!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;. The music video for the song was filmed earlier in September in Los Angeles, California with Klasfeld directing again. The clip, filmed in black-and-white shows instances of real-life suffering: a man dying from AIDS, a girl with anorexia, a soldier missing some of his limbs, among others. The album was included in a package with &quot;Get Your Heart On!&quot; (2011) in 2013.

==Touring==

Prior to the release of &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot;, the band supported Avril Lavigne on a European tour. Following its release, the group went on a club tour, which was followed by headlining radio festivals throughout December 2004. In the same month, the band performed on MuchMusic. From January to April 2005, the band toured across the UK, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. They visited Europe for a few weeks worth of publicity, before returning to the US. In May and June, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Good Charlotte, dubbed the Noise to the World tour. They were supported by Relient K. Between June and August, the group appeared at the Grand Prix F1 Weekend, supported Green Day for two shows in the UK. performed as part of the Canadian branch of Live 8, and played &quot;Untitled&quot; on the 2005 Teen Choice Awards.

After appearing on three dates at Warped Tour, the band toured Japan, the UK, Australia and China, which included an appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. During a hometown show in September, Bouvier was injured by the crowd throwing bottles, and as a result, the band were forced to cancel an appearance at a benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Katrina. Sometime afterwards, they went on a South American tour. In October and November, the group went on a US tour, with support from Straylight Run, Plain White T&#x27;s and Paramore. Prior to the start of the trek, the group were in Mexico when Hurricane Wilma hit, resulting in them being evacuated, but leaving their equipment behind. Subsequently, they had to rent gear and their stage show lacked props. The band closed the year with their first ever cross-country Canadian tour in November and December 2005 with support from the Planet Smashers. The group went on their final supporting tour for the album in February 2006, during a stint of the UK.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot; received generally positive reviews, receiving praise for its production and catchy choruses, but music critics were still questioning the band&#x27;s musical talent in terms of lyrics and instrumentation in their given genre. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 66, based on 9 reviews.

Johnny Loftus of AllMusic commended the band for shifting their teenage ennui material from pop-punk to a more modern rock sound that shows maturity in their lyrics, concluding that &quot;As &quot;Still Not Getting Any...&quot;″s title and rowdier moments prove, they can still bring the spunky crowd-pleasers. But it&#x27;s the album&#x27;s less raucous and more thoughtful side that shows Simple Plan&#x27;s investment in the future.&quot; Sean Richardson of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the band for maintaining their sense of humor and energy on the album, concluding that &quot;Life may be complicated for Avril Lavigne&#x27;s favorite opening act, but they&#x27;re smart enough to understand that sometimes music shouldn&#x27;t be.&quot; While mixed on the teenage-aimed lyrics, Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found the production and instrumentation of the tracks catchy and worthy of being released as singles, saying that &quot;[D]espite the overwrought angst, &quot;Still Not Getting Any . . .&quot; is a hard-to-deny collection of bubblegum punk.&quot;

Nick Catucci of &quot;Blender&quot; commended the band for adding their own musical choices to the pop-punk formula that evoke emotional introspection and empowerment but found it lacking in substance and stand out musicianship, concluding that &quot;Simple Plan are gluttons for the pleasure of release, a quality they picked up from an earlier generation of wound-up punk. Though that&#x27;s also the only quality to which they&#x27;ve remained loyal.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was mixed on the messages that Bouvier delivered throughout the album, concluding that &quot;Individually, the songs are catchy, but as they pile up over the length of the album, it&#x27;s impossible not to wonder whether the singer&#x27;s endless complaints didn&#x27;t drive everyone away.&quot; Robert Christgau graded the album as a &quot;dud&quot;, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; listed the album as one of &quot;20 Pop Punk Albums Which Will Make You Nostalgic&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
It debuted and peaked at number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with over 139,000 copies sold in its first week. The record was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of one million copies. As Of July 2005, it has sold 1.2 million copies in the US.

Lead single &quot;Welcome to My Life&quot; peaked at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 10 on Mainstream Top 40, and was certified gold by the RIAA for 500,000 shipments.

<doc id="1067753" wikidata="Q3243630" url="?curid=1067753" title="Telos">
<text>Telos (; ) is a term used by philosopher Aristotle to refer to the final cause of a natural organ or entity, or of human art. &quot;Telos&quot; is the root of the modern term teleology, the study of purposiveness or of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions. Teleology is central in Aristotle&#x27;s work on plant and animal biology, and human ethics, through his theory of the four causes. Aristotle&#x27;s notion that everything has a &quot;telos&quot; also gave rise to epistemology.

== In Aristotle ==
&quot;Telos&quot; has been consistently used in the writings of Aristotle, in which the term, on several occasions, denotes &#x27;goal&#x27;. It is considered synonymous to &quot;teleute&quot; (&#x27;end&#x27;), particularly in Aristotle&#x27;s discourse about the plot-structure in &quot;Poetics&quot;. The philosopher went as far as to say that &quot;telos&quot; can encompass all forms of human activity. One can say, for instance, that the &quot;telos&quot; of warfare is victory, or the &quot;telos&quot; of business is the creation of wealth. Within this conceptualization, there are &quot;telos&quot; that are subordinate to other &quot;telos&quot;, as all activities have their own, respective goals.

For Aristotle, these subordinate &quot;telos&quot; can become the means to achieve more fundamental &quot;telos&quot;. Through this concept, for instance, the philosopher underscored the importance of politics and that all other fields are subservient to it. He explained that the &quot;telos&quot; of the blacksmith is the production of a sword, while that of the swordsman&#x27;s, which uses the weapon as a tool, is to kill or incapacitate an enemy. On the other hand, the &quot;telos&quot; of these occupations are merely part of the purpose of a ruler, who must oversee the direction and well-being of a state.

Moreover, it can be understood as the &quot;supreme end of man&#x27;s endeavour&quot;. 

=== &quot;Telos&quot; vs &quot;techne&quot; ===
&quot;Telos&quot; is associated with the concept called &quot;techne,&quot; which is the rational method involved in producing an object or accomplishing a goal or objective. In the Theuth/Thamus myth, for instance, the section covering &quot;techne&quot; referred to &quot;telos&quot; and &quot;techne&quot; together. The two methods are, however, not mutually exclusive in principle. These are demonstrated in the cases of writing and seeing, as explained by Martin Heidegger: the former is considered a form of &quot;techne&quot;, as the end product lies beyond (&quot;para&quot;) the activity of producing; whereas, in seeing, there is no remainder outside of or beyond the activity itself at the moment it is accomplished. Aristotle, for his part, simply designated &quot;sophia&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;arete&quot; or excellence of philosophical reflection) as the consummation or the final cause (&quot;telos&quot;) of &quot;techne&quot;. Heidegger attempted to explain the Aristotelian conceptualization outlined in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, where the &quot;eidos&quot;the soul of the makerwas treated as the &quot;arche&quot; of the thing made (&quot;ergon&quot;). In this analogy, the telos constitutes the &quot;arche&quot; but in a certain degree not at the disposition of &quot;techne&quot;.

== In modern philosophy ==
The notion of purpose, or telos, has formed the foundation of cybernetics, and is now part of the modern analysis of social media platforms as intelligent social machines.

Action theory also makes essential use of teleological vocabulary. From Donald Davidson&#x27;s perspective, an &quot;action&quot; is just something an agent does with an intentioni.e., looking forward to some end to be achieved by the action. &quot;Action&quot; is considered just a step that is necessary to fulfill human telos, as it leads to habits.

According to the Marxist perspective, historical change is dictated by socio-economic structures (or &quot;laws&quot;), which are simultaneously preconditions and limitations of the realization of the &quot;telos&quot; of the class struggle.

<text>Parry is a lunar impact crater that is attached to the southeast rim of the walled plain Fra Mauro. It was named after British explorer William Parry. Attached to the west and southwest rim of Parry is the crater Bonpland. Due south of Parry is the small crater Tolansky, and farther to the south-southwest is Guericke.

The rim of Parry is heavily worn and slightly distorted due to the co-joined formations. The wall is the most prominent along the northwest, and crossed along the southwest by the small Parry B. The floor has been flooded by lava, and is relatively flat. At the midpoint is a pair of small craters. 

A rille system, called the Rimae Parry, crosses the region in a series of graben. One rille crosses the southeast rim of Parry in a northeast direction before crossing the east rim and continuing a short distance across the surrounding mare. Another extends from Tolansky crater across the west side of Parry and into Fra Mauro crater. One other crosses the north rim of Bonpland crater and into Fra Mauro where it intersects with another rille.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Parry.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Parry A — &quot;See&quot; Tolansky (crater).

<text>Zadonshchina (; could be translated as &quot;the region beyond the Don River&quot;) is a Russian literary monument of the late 14th century, which tells of the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380.

== The text ==

=== Redactions and the Prototext ===
&quot;Zadonshina&quot; exists in 2 redactions:

* Short redaction in one extant copy from Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery (KB) copied by the monk Efrosin (Russian: Ефросин). Possibly he himself abridged the tale; The second part of the battle is not described in this version. This is the oldest extant copy. It dates back to the end of the 15th century.
* Expanded redaction in three major extant and two incomplete copies. The major copies are: the Synodal copy, Undolsky’s copy and the copy of the State History Museum (Museum). Undolsky’s copy and the Museum copy stem from the same prototext. Undolsky’s copy is the most complete, however this one as well as all others have many mistakes, pointing at the insufficient understanding of the text by the copiers.

It is not clear what the original text was. Some scholars assert that the extant copies do not all go back to the same prototext. Many publications of Zadonshchina were composed by adding up excerpts from different copies.

=== Date of creation ===
Some Russian historians, including Mikhail Tikhomirov, believe that &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; was written between 1383 and 1393. Some manuscripts mention that 160 years had passed since the Battle of the Kalka River, which happened in 1223. At the same time, there is a mention of a Bulgarian city Tyrnov (contemporary Veliko Tarnovo), which in 1393 was taken by the Turks and could not be mentioned as Orthodox until the 19th century.

=== Authorship ===
One of the hypotheses is that the author of &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; was a certain Sofonii (Russian: Софоний) from Ryazan’. His name as the author of the text is mentioned in the KB copy and in the Synodal copy. Sofonii was probably one of the courtsmen of Volodimir Ondreevich, a cousin of Dmitry Ivanovich, the protagonist of &quot;Zadonshchina&quot;.
Soviet/Russian textological research has shown that Sofonii is alluded to in all other copies of &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; as an author of a preceding work about the Battle of Kulikovo and hence is not the author of the text in question, but rather of a prototext on this subject, and that the actual author of &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; used that text in creating his work.

=== Composition ===
The text can poetically and thematically be divided into 3 parts:

*introduction (references to the past, historical background)
*“lament” (gathering of the hosts, 1st battle and the defeat, wives lamenting their fallen husbands)
*“praise” (second battle and praise to the princes)

== Contents and message ==
&quot;Zadonshchina&quot; presents a detailed description of the Battle of Kulikovo against the Tatars led by Mamai. The leader of the Muscovy hosts was prince Dmitry Ivanovich (entered in history as Dmitry Donskoy, Дмитрий Донской). The story propagates the importance of the unification of Russian principalities in order to defeat the common enemy – the Golden Horde. This epic also reflects the rise of the Moscow principality and stresses that the Muscovy princes were successors to the Kievan princes. It also crafted a proto-national myth about the need for unification against foreign enemies: &quot;Let us lay down our lives for the Russian land and the Christian faith&quot;.

== &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; ==

A French Slavist André Mazon and later a Soviet/Russian historian A. A. Zimin proposed that, &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; was written based on poetic images and ideas from &quot;Zadonshchina&quot;. They proposed that &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; was not an Old Russian text, but an 18th-century forgery. Indeed, the view of the &quot;Igor&#x27; Tale&quot; as a late forgery certainly implies that it is imitation of Zadonshchina, as the two texts are undoubtedly related. This approach is criticized by linguists, notably Roman Jakobson and Andrey Zaliznyak who show that the language of the &quot;Igor&#x27;s Tale&quot; is far more archaic, and that the passages in &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; allegedly borrowed from the Tale differ from the rest of the work by linguistic criteria (whereas in the Tale no such distinction can be drawn).

== Translation ==
The English translation can be found in &quot;Medieval Russia&#x27;s Epics, Chronicles and Tales&quot; by S. Zenskovsky (New York: Meridian, 1974).

== Other sources on the Battle of Kulikovo ==

1. Chronicles (Simeonovskaya, Novgorodskaya, Sofiyskaya)

2. &quot;The Word of Mamay&#x27;s Defeat&quot; (Russian: &quot;Сказание о Мамаевом побоище&quot;, &quot;Skazaniie o Mamaevom poboishche&quot;)

3. &quot;The Word on the Life and Death of Dmitry Ivanovich&quot; (&quot;Слово о житии и преставлении Дмитрия Ивановича&quot;, &quot;Slovo o zhitii i o prestavlenii Dmitriia Ivanovicha&quot;)

<doc id="1067778" wikidata="Q1474787" url="?curid=1067778" title="Lincolnshire Wolds">
<text>The Lincolnshire Wolds which also includes the Lincolnshire Wolds National Landscape are a range of low hills in the county of Lincolnshire, England which runs roughly parallel with the North Sea coast, from the Humber Estuary just west of the town of Barton-upon-Humber in North Lincolnshire down in a south easterly direction towards the flat Lincolnshire Fens in the south-east of the county as far south as the East Lindsey village of East Keal. The Wolds form the highest land in eastern England between Yorkshire and Kent. and also are a designated National Landscape although the area which is covered by this designation does not cover the entirety of the general area that makes up the Lincolnshire Wolds as a whole.

==Geology==
The Wolds are formed largely from a series of pure marine limestones formed during the Cretaceous period, known collectively as the Chalk Group. The chalk overlies a series of other sedimentary strata of late Jurassic/early Cretaceous age. The strata dip gently to the east and form a scarp which runs southeast from Barton upon Humber via Caistor before it loses its identity north of Spilsby. To the north of the Humber Gap, the same formations continue as the Yorkshire Wolds. The rock succession in stratigraphic order i.e. youngest/uppermost first, is this:
*White Chalk Subgroup
**Burnham Chalk formation
**Welton Chalk Formation
*Grey Chalk Subgroup 
**Ferriby Chalk Formation
**Hunstanton Chalk Formation

The thin Hunstanton Chalk and the Ferriby Chalk formations form much of the west facing Wolds scarp but it is the overlying Welton Chalk Formation which forms the greater part of the easterly dip-slopes with the Ferriby Chalk extensively exposed within the dry dip-slope valleys. The Burnham Chalk Formation forms an indistinct secondary scarp to the east of the main scarp between Barton and Louth. In the north between South Ferriby and Grasby, the lower part of the scarp is formed from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation. A series of other rock layers intervene from the Caistor area southwards, uppermost of which are the green-brown Carstones:

Lower/early Cretaceous
*Carstone Formation (sandstone)
*Roach Formation (interbedded mudstone and limestone) (present from Stenigot southwards)
*Tealby Formation (mudstone - but including the &#x27;Tealby Limestone Member&#x27;)
*Claxby Ironstone Formation
Upper/late Jurassic
*Spilsby Sandstone Formation
*Kimmeridge Clay Formation

The numerous dry valleys cut into the dip-slope are typically floored by head, locally derived clay, silt, sand and gravel. The western valleys were created during recent glacial periods through the action of water over frozen ground whilst many in the east represent subglacial drainage. During the last ice age (Devensian), ice encroached upon the Wolds from the northeast and entered the Humber gap from the east but did not cover the Wolds, hence there is no Devensian age glacial till on these hills. However, an earlier ice age left extensive spreads of till across the central and southern areas. Sections of the main scarp, notably at Saxby All Saints and between Nettleton and Walesby have been subject to landslip.

==Geography==
The Wolds comprise a series of low hills incised by characteristic dry open valleys.
The Lincolnshire Wolds can be divided into four distinct areas: 
#the main area of chalk hills in the north, 
#the north west scarp, 
#an area of ridges and valleys in the south west,
#the claylands in the south east.

The Red Hill nature reserve near the village of Goulceby is notable for the unusual red colour of its soil and underlying chalk.

Wolds Top is the highest point in the whole of Lincolnshire and is marked by a trig point just north of the village of Normanby le Wold, at approximately above sea level ().

Other hills include:
*Castcliffe Hill - - 
*Gaumer Hill - - 
*Hoe Hill - - 
*Meagram Top - - 
*Miles Cross Hill
*Tetford Hill - - 
*Warden Hill - - 

The Wolds provide views across the flat Fens and salt marshes of Lindsey and Holland: it is possible, from various points on the Wolds, to see all of the larger structures in the north and east of the county: the Belmont mast, Boston Stump, Grimsby Dock Tower, the Humber Bridge, Lincoln Cathedral, St James&#x27; Church in Louth (known locally as the &#x27;Cathedral of the Wolds&#x27;, though it holds only parish church status), the radar station near Normanby, Tattershall Castle and the wind turbines on the coast near Mablethorpe.

=== Waterways ===
==Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty==
The Lincolnshire Wolds were designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1973, and are managed as such by the &quot;Lincolnshire Wolds Countryside Service&quot;.

The Wolds AONB covers 560 square kilometres, while the Countryside Service recognises a wider &quot;Lincolnshire Wolds Character/Natural Area&quot; which incorporates the AONB and the neighbouring areas of the (geographical) Wolds to the north and south.

The Wolds AONB cuts across the council boundaries of Lincolnshire County Council, East Lindsey District Council, West Lindsey District Council and North East Lincolnshire Council. The boundaries of the AONB are marked by tourist signs incorporating stylized hills and trees, placed on roads leading into the area.

==People and places==
The Wolds are sparsely populated and have a rural character. They are &#x27;ringed&#x27; by several small market towns that lie around their edge: 
*Alford
*Horncastle, billed on tourist signs as the &quot;gateway to the Wolds&quot;, lies just outside the south end of the AONB
*Louth
*Market Rasen
*Caistor
*Spilsby

Many of the place-names in the Wolds indicate a strong Viking influence in the area&#x27;s history. There is also an abundance of mediaeval &#x27;lost villages&#x27; – settlements abandoned due to changes in land use, soil exhaustion and disease.

Several notable roads and paths run over the Wolds. Caistor High Street, the path of a Roman road and now the route of the B1225, runs from Caistor to Baumber near Horncastle. The ancient Bluestone Heath Road follows the course of an ancient drove road from west to east across the Wolds, and several &quot;A&quot; roads also run through the AONB.

The Wolds are now promoted as a tourist destination: the area&#x27;s connection with Tennyson (who was born in Somersby) is being exploited, and farmers are being encouraged to diversify into the tourism industry. The roads of the Wolds are particularly popular with motorcyclists, and the area is home to Cadwell Park, one of the UK&#x27;s top race circuits.

The area is also popular with walkers: the Viking Way long-distance footpath runs from Barton-upon-Humber in North Lincolnshire across the Lincolnshire Wolds and into Rutland, and there is a youth hostel in the middle of the Wolds at Woody&#x27;s Top near the village of Tetford.

<text>Martin Mill is a village in east Kent, England. It takes its name from the nearby village of Martin. Martin Mill railway station is on the Dover to Deal railway line. The population of the village was, similarly to Martin, included in the civil parish of Langdon.

The windmill which gives Martin Mill its name was operating commercially until about 1923 when Sydney Hogben, the owner and former operator, removed the sails. This caused outrage in the community. The remaining structure was demolished in the 1960s.

==History==

The original Martin Mill railway was constructed and operated by Pearson &amp; Son in 1897 for the construction of the Admiralty harbour. The line was laid to standard gauge from Martin Mill station and needed very little earth works until it reached the cliffs where terraces with a gradient of about 1 in 25 were cut into the cliff face to form a switch back path down to the harbour. The line was in use until completion of the harbour and eventually dismantled in 1937 after the intention of using it as a passenger line failed.

==Martin Mill Military Railway==
During the second world war the line was relaid again to standard gauge following the original course to a point north of Fan Bay Battery, from there two new lines where laid eastwards either side of the Dover to St Margaret&#x27;s road and both terminating at St Margaret&#x27;s. The northern line supplied the 14 inch Mk VII naval-type guns &quot;Winnie&quot; and &quot;Pooh&quot;, and was also laid with two curved firing spurs for the 13.5&quot; rail mounted guns &quot;Gladiator&quot;, &quot;Scene Shifter&quot;, and &quot;Piece Maker&quot;.

The railway guns were 13.5 inch ex-naval guns on World War I-type mountings; &quot;Scene Shifter&quot; recycled the name and carriage from a former 14 inch railway gun, the other carriages were left over from a World War I 18 inch railway howitzer programme. These had a maximum elevation of 39 deg, traverse was by using the guns on a curved spur with the degrees marked along the tracks, a large arrow was mounted on the guns&#x27; bogies to line up with the marks. Recoil was absorbed by special brakes acting on the wheels. &quot;Boche Buster&quot;, an 18-inch howitzer on a former World War I 14 inch railway gun carriage, was deployed in November 1943. Maintenance and barrel changing was carried out at the disused Stone Hall Colliery sidings Lydden.

The southernmost line had a curved firing spur close to Fan Bay. The line then continued to Wanston battery where two spurs where laid in front of the guns &quot;Clem&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; for barrel changing. The barrels being transported by rail to Woolwich Arsenal where they were re-sleeved. There was also a short bypass loop north of the line. The line continued passing South Foreland battery to the 13.5&quot; hypervelocity gun &quot;Bruce&quot; and would also have served St Margaret&#x27;s Battery.

The line was entirely worked by diesel-electric shunting locomotives requisitioned from the LMS (London Midland Scottish) and SR (Southern Railway), three from the SR and six from the LMS the smoke from a steam locomotive being visible above the cliffs would have given the guns positions away. The LMS locomotives being a long way from home were on an exchange basis if a locomotive failed it was immediately replaced from LMS stock, repaired at Derby works and worked on the LMS until required again. The SR locomotives, being on home turf, were quickly repaired at Ashford works. As the locomotives shared the same English Electric diesel engines it is probable minor engine repairs for the LMS locos could be carried out at Ashford. Whilst on the MMMR the locomotives were stabled at the shed in Martin Mill station Yard.

The line was again lifted just after the end of the war.

<doc id="1067785" wikidata="Q2830618" url="?curid=1067785" title="Alan Walters">
<text>Sir Alan Arthur Walters (17 June 1926 – 3 January 2009) was a British economist who was best known as the Chief Economic Adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from 1981 to 1983 and (after his return from the United States) again for five months in 1989.

== Early life ==
Walters was born in Leicester. His father was a Communist and a grocer who sold goods from a van. He failed his 11-Plus and attended Alderman Newton&#x27;s School in Leicester, leaving at fifteen to work as a machine operator in a shoe factory. During World War II, he was called up and joined the British Army as a private.

== Academic career ==
Walters studied statistics at University College Leicester and then went to Nuffield College, Oxford, where he took an MA in economics. On leaving Nuffield in 1951, he took up a post to teach statistics at Birmingham University, later becoming professor of econometrics and statistics there in the early 1960s. He was one of the first British economists to argue that money was &quot;of considerable importance&quot; to economic activity, a view that became more widespread during &quot;the Great Inflation&quot; of the 1970s. He argued forcefully that Britain should maintain strict monetary targets, and that the money supply should not be manipulated for political reasons.

In 1968–70 he was a member of the Commission on the Third London Airport (the &quot;Roskill Commission&quot;).

After serving as a professor at the London School of Economics from 1968 to 1976, where he was Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of Economics, Walters became an economic adviser to the World Bank and a professor in the Economics Department at The Johns Hopkins University.

One of his most important contributions to economic theory was to demonstrate empirically that, for many industries, the costs at the high-scale end of the long-run cost curve is essentially constant or even declining. This was established in his article &quot;Production and Cost Functions: An Econometric Survey&quot;, published by the journal &quot;Econometrica&quot;.

== Political career ==
In 1981, he was asked to become an economic adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (who was elected in the 1979 general election), and advised on that year&#x27;s budget, in which taxes were increased during a recession. This policy produced much criticism and was associated with rioting and high unemployment, but it has been claimed that it enabled the sustained economic growth of the 1990s. He left this role in 1983 to join the American Enterprise Institute and at least some aspects of monetarist policies were publicly repudiated by Thatcher in 1985. He did, however, return to advise Thatcher in 1989, but his differences with the policies of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, led to the resignation of both men on 26 October 1989.

Walters supported the controversial and ill-fated Community Charge (referred to as the &quot;poll tax&quot;). He opposed the similarly ill-fated policy of entry into the European Monetary System. In 1997, he stood as the Referendum Party candidate for the safe Conservative seat of the Cities of London and Westminster achieving 3% of the vote.

== Personal life ==

In 1975, Walters married Margaret Patricia Wilson, known as Paddie. He had a daughter by a previous marriage to Audrey Claxton. He was knighted in the Queen&#x27;s 1983 Birthday Honours List.

He was an accomplished pianist, enjoying playing the works of Chopin and Beethoven. He also collected Thai porcelain and was a keen tennis player.

Walters was vice-chairman and Director of AIG Trading Group, Inc.

Towards the end of his life, he suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He died aged 82 at his home on 3 January 2009 after a short illness. Upon hearing of his death, Thatcher described him as &quot;radical, fearless&quot; and the &quot;finest of friends&quot;.

<text>Eat Your Face is the eighth album by the Huntington Beach, California punk rock band Guttermouth, released in 2004 by Epitaph Records and Volcom Entertainment. It was hailed as a &quot;return to form&quot; after the stylistic experimentations of 2002&#x27;s &quot;Gusto&quot;, going back to the band&#x27;s tried-and-true style of fast, abrasive punk rock with tongue-in-cheek humor and sarcastic lyrics. The album marked a period of transition for the band, whose founding guitarist Eric Davis had left the group early in 2004 and been replaced by Donald Horne. It was also their only album with bassist Kevin Clark, and their last with longtime drummer Ty Smith. Lyrically it retained the band’s sense of biting sarcasm and expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. electoral system and the current state of punk rock in the mainstream, amongst other topics.

In the summer of 2004 Guttermouth embarked on the Vans Warped Tour in support of &quot;Eat Your Face&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s outrageous behavior and propensity for stirring up controversy soon led to problems on the tour. Singer Mark Adkins would often openly insult other acts from onstage, and the band members mocked the anti-Republican agenda of many of the tour&#x27;s performers by selling T-shirts and displaying banners that proclaimed support for President George W. Bush. After several weeks the band abruptly left the tour, causing many rumors to circulate online and in the music press as to the reasons behind their departure, some claiming that they had been ejected and others that they had been asked to leave. Eventually Adkins issued a statement admitting that the band had left the tour voluntarily, due in part to his distaste for the political atmosphere surrounding it.

&quot;Eat Your Face&quot; was released jointly by Epitaph Records and Volcom Entertainment. It would be the band&#x27;s final recording for Epitaph, as they would move fully to Volcom for their next album, 2006&#x27;s &quot;Shave the Planet&quot;.

<text>Sarabhai is a small, circular, bowl-shaped crater on the Mare Serenitatis, in the northeast quadrant of the Moon. The formation is relatively isolated, being located to the northeast of the crater Bessel. It lies along a wrinkle ridge designated the Dorsum Azara.

This crater was named after Indian astrophysicist Vikram Sarabhai in 1973, considered the Father of the Indian Space Programme. It was previously identified as Bessel A.

<text>The Lincoln Imp is a grotesque on a wall inside Lincoln Cathedral, England, and it has become the symbol of the city of Lincoln. The carving is situated high on the north side of the Angel Choir and is not conspicuous. The Angel Choir was built between 1250 and 1280, so the carving must date from then. It became well known in the late nineteenth century, and its associated folk tales are an elaboration of earlier traditions involving the devil hiding from wind inside the cathedral, the devil looking at Lincoln with malicious envy, and stone sculptures (at Lincoln Cathedral or Lincoln College, Oxford) said to represent either theme.

==History==

A 1780 guide to early English sculpture by John Carter had a section on &quot;Antiquities from Lincoln&quot;. It made no mention of the imp but had an illustration of &quot;A Sculpture projecting over the angle of a Turret of the South Porch of the Cathedral. &#x27;Tis called by the inhabitants, the &#x27;Devil on the Witch&#x27;s back, looking over Lincoln&#x27;.&quot; Guides to the cathedral published in 1837 and 1856 also mentioned this exterior sculpture, and made no mention of the imp. An 1869 book by Richard John King did mention the imp carving, though not by nickname. &quot;The grotesque below the second corbel on the north side (counting from the east—it is in the retro-choir) represents an elf with large ears, and may perhaps be regarded as illustrating the mediaeval folk-lore.&quot;

The nickname &quot;Lincoln Imp&quot; arose some time before 1897, when it featured in a pamphlet by Arnold Frost (real name G. T. Hemsley), containing his poem &quot;The Ballad of the Wind, the Devil and Lincoln Minster&quot;. Frost said it was based on an &quot;old Lincolnshire legend&quot; that had &quot;not hitherto appeared in print&quot;. He said it had been told to him &quot;some five or six years ago by a North Lincolnshire man, sixty years of age, who, as a boy, had heard his father relate it.&quot; Frost summarised the legend:

“The coming of Bishop Remigius to Lincoln made the devil very angry, for up to that time he had had it all his own way in the town and district. The devil tried his utmost to turn him from his purpose of building a Cathedral, but without success. At last in desperation — the Minster then nearing its completion — the devil waylaid the bishop at the south-western corner of the building and tried to kill him. But the good prelate in his extremity called for aid upon the Blessed Virgin Mary — to whom the Church was to be dedicated — whereupon, the Blessed Virgin sent a mighty rushing wind, which, catching the devil, so hustled and buffeted him, that he slipped inside the Church for safety, where he has been ever since, nor dare he come out, knowing that the wind awaits his return in order to make an end of him.”

The legend made no mention of a stone carving. That was Frost’s own addition, in the last part of his poem:

The bishop we know died long ago.&lt;br&gt;
The wind still waits, nor will he go&lt;br&gt;
Till he has a chance of beating his foe;&lt;br&gt;
But the devil hopp&#x27;d up without a limp.&lt;br&gt;
And at once took shape as the “Lincoln Imp.”&lt;br&gt;
And there he sits a&#x27;top of the column,&lt;br&gt;
And grins at the people who gaze so solemn;&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, he mocks at the wind below.&lt;br&gt;
And says, “you may wait till doomsday, O !” 

Frost was aware of a problem of chronology: the imp carving was made two centuries after Remigius founded the cathedral. He wrote in a footnote: “it is natural to suppose the devil would shift his quarters from time to time, choosing with each remove the most beautiful portion of the Cathedral as his particular stall!”

Frost’s introduction to the poem gave two other legends from published sources, linking the devil with Lincoln Cathedral (but not the imp). One ran as follows:

“The wind and the devil being on a friendly tour, [they] arrived at Lincoln Minster, where the latter addressed his friend thus, ‘just wait outside here whilst I go in and have a chat with my friends the Dean and Canons.’ ‘All right,’ said the wind, and he has been waiting there ever since!”

The other was a story about a proverbial expression, “looking as the devil over Lincoln”. It meant to regard something or someone with malicious envy, and can be dated at least as far back as 1562 (“Like as the diuel lookt oer Lincolne”). The expression was well known, used by writers including Pope, Swift and Scott. It was illustrated by George Cruikshank as a man with a grotesque expression.

Lincoln Cathedral stands in an exposed position, vulnerable to high winds, and its tall wood and timber spire was “blown down during a tempest in January 1547-8”. Seen as the work of a spiteful devil, this would explain both traditions. In a book published in 1748, Daniel Defoe wrote, “The Middle or Rood Tower is the highest in the whole Kingdom, and when the Spire was standing on it, it must, in Proportion to the Height of the Tower, have exceeded that of old St. Paul&#x27;s, which was 520 Feet. The Monks were so proud of this Structure, that they would have it, that the Devil looked upon it with an envious Eye; whence the Proverb of a Man who looks invidious and malignant, &quot;He looks as the Devil over Lincoln&quot;.”

Another explanation for the proverb linked it with a sculpture at Lincoln College, Oxford. Thomas Fuller discussed this in his &quot;Worthies of England&quot; (1662). “Some fetch the original of this Proverb from a stone picture of the Devil, which doth (or lately did) over-look Lincoln College… [however] it is conceived of more antiquity… [and] related originally to the Cathedral Church in Lincoln.” In Fuller’s view, the sculpture at Oxford had simply come to be seen as a humorous embodiment of the existing proverb.

Frost was not aware of this history when he wrote his poem, but said he learned some of it while his pamphlet was in press, causing him to release a second edition, with a new introduction, five months later. There he wrote of “the notorious attempt made by ‘Oxford men’ to appropriate one more good thing from the City of Lincoln, namely, the cult of the ‘Lincoln Imp’.” He quoted Fuller as evidence against the “Oxford plagiarists” and provided “two other versions of the legend… from two widely different sources.” He did not specify what the sources were, but said “there is every reason to believe them genuine [though] neither version can boast a Lincolnshire origin.” One of them involved two imps rather than one, thus connecting the Angel Choir carving with the “devil on the witch’s back” sculpture at the south porch, and linking both with the theme of the wind:

&quot;The wind, one day, brought two imps to view the new Minster at Lincoln. Both imps were greatly impressed with the magnitude and beauty of the structure, and one of them, smitten by a fatal curiosity, slipped inside the building to see what was going on. His temerity, however, cost him dear, for he was so petrified with astonishment at the wonderful things he both saw and heard, that his heart became as stone within him, and he remained rooted to the ground. The other imp, full of grief at the loss of his brother, flew madly round about the minster, seeking in vain for the lost one. At length, being wearied out, he alighted, quite unwittingly, upon the shoulders of a certain witch, and was also, and in like manner, instantly turned to stone! But the wind still haunts the Minster precincts waiting their return, now hopelessly disconsolate ! and now raging with fury !&quot;

The other related to the “devil over Lincoln” theme:

“When the Minster was nearing its completion, the devil, who had narrowly and jealously watched the good bishop&#x27;s proceedings, at once took up his position as over-lord, saying with a grim smile, as he looked over Lincoln, &quot;Ah! my good friend, all this is mine!&quot;

Frost produced a third edition of his pamphlet in June 1898, and in the same year his version of the imp legend was given far wider currency by being reproduced in ‘’The Magic of the Horseshoe’’ by the American writer Robert Means Lawrence.

An 1898 cathedral guidebook by A.F. Kendrick called the Lincoln Imp a “delightfully grotesque little specimen of ugliness” and “a characteristic record of the exuberant fancy of our mediaeval artists.” Kendrick also mentioned the south porch carving, calling it “an imp on the back of a witch”, plus another exterior sculpture that locals connected with the same tradition, above the south-east chapel next to St Hugh’s. “The gable of this chapel is worthy of notice. At the head of its tall central lancet is a grotesque figure, commonly pointed out as the ‘Devil looking over Lincoln’.”

The growing popularity of the Lincoln Imp led to a copy being installed at Oxford in 1899, replacing Lincoln College’s earlier claimant that had become damaged. The imp became famous in the early twentieth century as a good-luck charm after a wealthy local jeweller, James Ward Usher, secured sole rights to use its image on merchandise for a period of time. This was met by scepticism in some quarters, as shown by a letter to the magazine Notes and Queries, quoted in a 1908 book on Lincolnshire folklore:

“A friend of mine informs me that, according to a ladies&#x27; fashion paper which she was reading not long ago, a trinket in the form of &#x27;the Lincoln Imp&#x27; will prevent its wearer losing things. I am anxious to know whether this superstition has been made to order. It does not seem probable that it is veritable folk-lore, as no evidence is yet forthcoming that the quaint figure in the Minster which is known as &#x27; the Imp&#x27; was originally intended to represent the devil, or till recent days had any connexion with the devil-legend of the city or other traditionary beliefs.”

==Folk tales==

Modern folk tales about the Lincoln Imp are mostly variations on the traditions described in the previous section. Reproduced in newspapers, tourist guides and websites, they are often presented as ancient legends, but lack definite pre-20th century sources. Visit Lincoln (a not for profit community interest company that sponsors tourism and investment) gives the story as follows:

Legend has it that one day the Devil was in a frolicsome mood, and sent two naughty creatures to cause mischief on Earth. After allegedly stopping at Chesterfield, twisting the spire of St Mary and All Saints Church, the two imps went to Lincoln to wreak havoc in the city&#x27;s Cathedral. Upon arriving, the naughty imps went inside the cathedral and started to cause mayhem, knocking over the Dean, smashing the stained glass windows and destroying the lights. In a bid to put a stop to their antics, an angel was sent to warn the imps off causing any more chaos.

One of the imps hid underneath a table, whilst the other started throwing stones and rocks at the Angel in a final act of defiance - &quot;Stop me if you can!&quot; it cheekily retorted. In a moment of anger, the Angel turned the Imp to stone. He has remained in the same spot ever since, sitting cross-legged on top of the pillar overlooking the Angel Choir – a constant reminder of how good will always triumph over evil. Ever wondered why it&#x27;s so windy outside the Cathedral? That&#x27;s thought to be caused by the second Imp, waiting for his friend to return!

Head to Lincoln Cathedral and see the petrified Lincoln Imp high up for yourself - there&#x27;s a spotlight to help you if you give in! You’ll also find imps across the city too: on door knockers, in gift shops and even in the nickname of the local football team - the Red Imps.

The Lincoln Cathedral shop sells a Lincoln Imp keyring, and the cathedral website tells this story:

One day, according to a very old legend, the Devil sent his imps out to play, and the wind blew two of them all the way to Lincoln. At first they were so awestruck by the splendour of the Cathedral that they were afraid to enter. But soon, one imp plucked up courage, flew into the Cathedral where he tried to trip up the Lord Bishop, and to knock down the Dean, and teased the Vergers and Choir. When he started to break windows the Angels told him to stop his wicked doings; he cheekily replied &quot;Stop me if you can!&quot; Whereupon he was at once turned into stone, and made to sit for evermore in a cleft in the Angel Choir.

The Lincoln Imp is the best known of all the grotesque carved figures in the Cathedral. Its half human, half animal form was probably meant to represent the devil – a popular theme for sculptors of the thirteenth century. The stone figure of the Imp is about 12 inches high, and sits cross-legged high up between two arches on the north side of the Choir.
There is also a &quot;Grimsby Imp&quot; story, a variation of the two-imp story originally told by Arnold Frost in 1898, but with the second character relocated to a different Lincolnshire church, Grimsby Minster. The Grimsby Imp has been spoken about since at least 2017 when it was mentioned by Paul Martin on the television show &quot;Flog It!&quot;
Everywhere you look, here, in Grimsby Minster, there&#x27;s something to see. Little delights, little treats. Now, here in the south aisle, I&#x27;ve spotted something I want to show you. He&#x27;s a little imp, he&#x27;s known as the Grimsby Imp, and he&#x27;s more than likely a stonemason&#x27;s joke, and he&#x27;s right up there. The figure is supporting the weight of the tower on his back like Atlas carrying the globe. Now, it&#x27;s thought, legend has it, that he was one of two imps that escaped from Lincoln Cathedral, he found his way here, caused lots of mischief, was found out by the angels and turned into stone. But I&#x27;ve got another theory. I think it reflects the pride of the master stonemason, whose skills underpin the whole building. This has been here for centuries. It&#x27;s going to remain here for many more centuries to come. I love it, absolutely love it.
In May 2021 an item in Grimsby Live, &quot;The truth behind Grimsby&#x27;s very own legendary imp&quot;, further expanded the story to include the twisted spire of Chesterfield Parish Church. It said a vicar at Grimsby Minster &quot;has a more logical and historical explanation for the figure suggesting one of the craftsmen who built the Minster carved the figure of a man bending over supporting the church.&quot; In September 2021 North East Lincolnshire Council announced that Grimsby Minster was to be part of the &quot;Lincoln Imp Trail&quot;, involving 32 painted sculptures inspired by the Lincoln Imp placed at various sites around Lincolnshire in a venture organised by the Lincoln Business Improvement Group. Grimsby Minster website makes no mention of the imp.

== Lincoln College, Oxford ==

An 1899 reproduction of the Lincoln Imp also overlooked the Front Quad of Lincoln College, Oxford until 2000 when it was transferred to the bar (Deep Hall) and another Imp was erected in the traditional position above the entrance to Hall. 
This has given rise to a traditional Oxford expression: &#x27;to look on someone like the Imp looks over Lincoln&#x27; (a variant of the older proverb discussed above) as well as giving rise to the title of the college&#x27;s undergraduate newspaper: &quot;The Lincoln Imp&quot;. The Lincoln Imp is also the mascot of the college boat club, an image of which is used to decorate the oars and jerseys of the men&#x27;s 1st VIII.

== Wider use of the image ==

The Lincoln example is by far the best-known example. James Ward Usher, local businessman and philanthropist, obtained sole rights to use the image of the Lincoln Imp on jewellery, in the late 19th century, a venture which contributed greatly to his fame and wealth.

Lincoln City Football Club are nicknamed &#x27;The Imps&#x27;. An image of the Lincoln Imp appears on their crest, and &#x27;Poacher the Imp&#x27; serves as club mascot. The Lincoln Imp also lends its name to the Gibraltar club Lincoln Red Imps F.C., and Lincoln Hockey Club share the nickname and crest design of their footballing counterparts.

The Lincoln Imp is the badge of No. LXI Squadron RAF.

<text>Balboa is a lunar impact crater that is located near the western limb of the Moon. Due to foreshortening, the crater appears highly oval when viewed from the Earth. In actuality, however, the formation is relatively circular. It is comparable in size to the crater Dalton, located just to the southwest. The eastern rim of Balboa lies just to the west of the Oceanus Procellarum.

The rim of Balboa is worn and eroded, with the most intact sections along the eastern and western edges. The crater interior has been flooded with basaltic lava in the past, and the floor is marked fractures. Nearby Dalton and an unnamed crater northwest of satellite crater Balboa B are similarly fractured.

Balboa A is a well-formed impact crater located just to the southeast of Balboa, with a sharp, notched rim and an irregular interior. Its diameter is only somewhat smaller than Dalton directly to the west.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Balboa.

<text>Ben Lyon (February 6, 1901 – March 22, 1979) was an American film actor and a studio executive at 20th Century-Fox who later acted in British radio, films and TV.

==Early life and career==

Lyon was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Alvine W. (Wiseberg) and Ben Lyon, a travelling salesman. His family was Jewish. Lyon entered films in 1918 after a successful appearance on Broadway opposite Jeanne Eagels. He attracted attention in the highly successful film &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; (1923) and steadily developed into a leading man. He was successfully paired with some of the leading actresses of the silent era, including Pola Negri, Gloria Swanson, Colleen Moore, Barbara La Marr, Viola Dana, Anna Q. Nilsson, Mary Astor and Blanche Sweet. In 1925, a writer for &quot;Photoplay&quot; wrote of him, &quot;Girls, Ben Lyon looks harmless but we have reliable information that he&#x27;s irresistible, so watch your step. Besides he&#x27;s a mighty fine actor and if the ladies must fall in love with him he can&#x27;t help it.&quot;

He had success as an actor in the 1930 film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot;. The film was a major success and brought Jean Harlow to prominence, but Lyon&#x27;s performance as a heroic World War I aviator was also highly regarded and was a personal friend of Howard Hughes. For the next decade he was constantly in demand, but his popularity began to wane by the early 1940s. By the mid 1940s he was working for 20th Century-Fox. On July 17, 1946, he met a young aspiring actress named Norma Jeane Dougherty. After his first meeting with her, he stated that she was &quot;Jean Harlow all over again!&quot; He organized a color screen test for the actress, renamed her, and finally signed her as Marilyn Monroe to her first studio contract.

During World War II, when the United States was still neutral, Lyon and his wife, actress Bebe Daniels, settled in London. The couple, along with the comedian Vic Oliver, starred in the radio series &quot;Hi, Gang!&quot;, which ran from 1940 to 1949. &quot;Hi Gang&quot; was succeeded in 1950 by &quot;Life with the Lyons&quot;, which also featured their real-life son Richard and daughter Barbara, and spawned a couple of theatrical films as well as a television series on BBC and independent television from 1954 until 1960. Bebe Daniels had top billing in these series, similar to the concurrent American show starring married couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in March 1963, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre.

==Military service==
Lyon served as a pilot in the 322nd Pursuit Squadron in the early 1930s. During World War II he served as a lieutenant colonel in the US Army Air Forces Special Services.

==Personal life and death==
Lyon married actress Bebe Daniels in June 1930. They had two children, daughter Barbara in 1931 and an adopted son Richard. In an issue of the contemporary magazine &quot;Radio Pictorial&quot;, Bebe explained how she saw Richard peering through the railings at a London orphanage and instantly thought &quot;A brother for Barbara&quot;. Daniels suffered a severe stroke in 1963 and withdrew from public life. She suffered a second stroke in late 1970. She died at the couple&#x27;s London home in March 1971.

On April 1, 1972, Lyon married the actress Marian Nixon, whom he had known since the 1920s. They remained married until his death. She died five years later, also at age 78. 

On March 22, 1979, Lyon and his second wife, Marian Nixon, were vacationing together on the &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; cruise ship near Honolulu, Hawaii, when Lyon suffered a fatal heart attack. He was 78 years old. His body was cremated and is interred in the Chapel Columbarium at Hollywood Forever Cemetery next to his first wife, Bebe Daniels.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ben Lyon has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1724 Vine Street.

Jill Allgood lived with Bebe and Ben Lyon for many years in their large apartment at Dolphin Square, London. Bebe and Ben Lyon were the godparent to Allgood&#x27;s niece, Suzanne Allgood.

<text>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS) is a peer-reviewed scientific journal in astronomy, astrophysics and related fields. It publishes original research in two formats: papers (of any length) and letters (limited to five pages). MNRAS publishes more articles per year than any other astronomy journal.

The learned society journal has been in continuous existence since 1827 and became online only in 2020. It operates as a partnership between the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), who select and peer-review the contents, and Oxford University Press (OUP), who publish and market the journal. Despite its name, MNRAS is no longer monthly, nor does it carry the notices of the RAS. In 2024 MNRAS became a purely gold open access journal.

==History==
The first issue of MNRAS was published on 9 February 1827 as &quot;Monthly Notices of the Astronomical Society of London&quot; and it has been in continuous publication ever since. It took its current name from the second volume, after the Astronomical Society of London became the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS). Until 1960 it carried the monthly notices of the RAS, at which time these were transferred to the newly established &quot;Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot; (1960–1996) and then to its successor journal &quot;Astronomy &amp; Geophysics&quot; (since 1997). Until 1965, MNRAS was published in-house by the society; from 1965 to 2012 it was published by Blackwell Publishing (later part of Wiley-Blackwell) on behalf of the RAS. From 2013, MNRAS is published by Oxford University Press (OUP).

The journal is no longer monthly, with thirty-six issues a year divided into nine volumes. The Letters section had originally appeared on pink paper in the print edition, but moved online only in the early 2000s. Print publication ceased after the April 2020 volume, during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the journal becoming online-only.

==Content==
MNRAS publishes peer-reviewed articles on original research in astronomy and astrophysics. Two sorts of article are carried by MNRAS: papers, which can be of any length, and letters, which are published more quickly but are limited to five pages in length. Editorial control of the journal is exercised by the RAS through an editorial board of professional astronomers; , the editor-in-chief has been David Flower (University of Durham).

In 2022 MNRAS published 3441 articles, more than any other astronomy journal.

==Open access==
In January 2024 MNRAS became a gold open access journal, making all articles free to read online as soon as they are published, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) licence. There are no subscription fees for readers, instead the costs of publication are met by an article processing charge (APC) on the authors. , the APCs are £2310 for a standard article and £1100 for a letter; RAS Fellows receive a 20% discount on these fees. In many cases the APCs are paid for by a read and publish agreement between the author&#x27;s institution and OUP, and authors based in developing countries are entitled to an APC waiver. If an author is not from a developing country but is unable to pay the APC, MNRAS provides partial or full waivers on a case-by-case basis.

===Former policy===
Prior to 2024, MNRAS used a combination of green open access, delayed open access (36 months) and optional hybrid open access. There were no fees for authors, from the founding of the journal in 1927 until the end of 2023, with all costs of publications being met by subscriptions. Green open access was encouraged through self-archiving by authors on personal webpages, in institutional repositories, and on the arXiv preprint server. Fellows of the RAS were provided with free online access to the RAS journals as part of their membership benefits.

<text>Nathan Lynn Bachman (August 2, 1878April 23, 1937) was a United States Senator from Tennessee from 1933 until his death. He was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Biography==
Bachman was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. His father was Dr. Jonathan W. Bachman, Confederate veteran and former pastor of First Presbyterian Church in Chattanooga. He attended several colleges, including the former Southwestern Presbyterian University in Clarksville, Tennessee (the predecessor institution to the current Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee; the campus is the current setting of Austin Peay State University), Central University in Richmond, Kentucky (now merged with Centre College in Danville, Kentucky), and Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. He then returned home, attending the Chattanooga College of Law (then the law school of the former University of Chattanooga, now the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga) before actually graduating from the law school of the University of Virginia in 1903. He began the practice of law in Chattanooga that same year.

Bachman was Chattanooga city attorney from 1906 to 1908 and circuit court judge from 1912 to 1918. In 1918 he became an associate justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court, resigning in 1924 to run for the U.S. Senate. His 1924 campaign was unsuccessful and he returned to the practice of law.

However, on February 28, 1933, Bachman was appointed to the United States Senate by governor of Tennessee Hill McAlister to the unexpired term of Senator Cordell Hull, who had resigned to accept the appointment of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to the office of Secretary of State. In November, 1934, Bachman was elected to the balance of Hull&#x27;s unexpired term. He completed the term to which Hull had been elected and was subsequently elected to a full term in his own right in 1936. He died in Washington, D.C., the next spring after having served less than four months of that term.

Bachman was a prominent leader in the Masonic fraternity in Chattanooga, including the Knights Templar Commandery # 14. He was also an active Civitan.

==Death==
Driver died from a heart attack in Washington, D.C., on April 27, 1937 (age 58 years). He is interred at Forest Hills Cemetery, Chattanooga, Tennessee.

==The &quot;Bachman Tubes&quot;==

The Bachman Tubes are highway tunnels on U.S. Highways 41/76 through Missionary Ridge connecting Chattanooga with the adjacent town of East Ridge, which are named in his father&#x27;s honor.

<text>A Journey Beyond the Three Seas () is a Russian travelogue in the form of travel notes, made by Afanasy Nikitin, a merchant from Tver, during his journey to the Indian subcontinent in 1466–1472.

&quot;A Journey Beyond the Three Seas&quot; was the first Russian literary work to depict a strictly commercial, non-religious trip. Prior texts were pilgrimage texts, which depicted travel to holy sites and were more standardized, dry and conventional. The author visited the Caucasus, Persia, India and the Crimea. However, most of the notes are dedicated to India, its political structure, trade, agriculture, customs and ceremonies. The work is full of lyrical digressions and autobiographic passages. There is a strong individual, authorial presence. Its last page is in Turkic and broken Arabic; these are, in fact, typical Muslim prayers, indicating that Nikitin might have converted to Islam while he was in India, although his lapse from Christianity bothered him as he mentions several times in the text.

On the other hand Nikitin consistently prays to Blessed Virgin Mary as Theotokos, Christian Orthodox Saints, tries to observe Christian rites, and so on.
The author did not make his way back to his native land; he died on the trip home. 
In 1475, the manuscript made its way to Moscow into the hands of a government official by the name of Vasili Mamyrev. Later on, it was incorporated into the annalistic code of 1489, the &quot;Sofia Second Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Lvov Chronicle&quot;.

<text>The Concierto de Aranjuez (, &quot;Aranjuez Concerto&quot;) is a concerto for classical guitar by the Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo. Written in 1939, it is by far Rodrigo&#x27;s best-known work, and its success established his reputation as one of the most significant Spanish composers of the 20th century.

==Inspiration and history==

The &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; was inspired by the gardens at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez, the spring resort palace and gardens built by Philip II in the last half of the 16th century and rebuilt in the middle of the 18th century by Ferdinand VI. The work attempts to transport the listener to another place and time through the evocation of the sounds of nature.

According to the composer, the first movement is &quot;animated by a rhythmic spirit and vigour without either of the two themes... interrupting its relentless pace&quot;; the second movement &quot;represents a dialogue between classical guitar and solo instruments (cor anglais, bassoon, oboe, horn etc.)&quot;; and the last movement &quot;recalls a courtly dance in which the combination of double and triple time maintains a taut tempo right to the closing bar.&quot; He described the concerto itself as capturing &quot;the fragrance of magnolias, the singing of birds, and the gushing of fountains&quot; in the gardens of Aranjuez.

Rodrigo and his wife Victoria stayed silent for many years about the inspiration for the second movement, and thus the popular belief grew that it was inspired by the bombing of Guernica in 1937. In her autobiography, Victoria eventually declared that it was both an evocation of the happy days of their honeymoon and a response to Rodrigo&#x27;s devastation at the miscarriage of their first pregnancy. It was composed in 1939 in Paris.

Rodrigo dedicated the &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; to Regino Sainz de la Maza.

Rodrigo, nearly blind since age three, was a pianist. He did not play the guitar, yet he still managed to capture and project the role of the guitar in Spanish music.

===Composition===

Composed in early 1939, in Paris, amid the tensions of the impending war, it was the first work Rodrigo wrote for guitar and orchestra. The instrumentation is unusual: rarely does the guitar face the forces of a full orchestra. Thus, the guitar is never overwhelmed.

===Premiere===

The premiere of the &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; was held on 9 November 1940 at the Palau de la Música Catalana, in Barcelona. It was performed by guitarist Regino Sainz de la Maza with the Orquesta Filarmónica de Barcelona conducted by César Mendoza Lasalle.

On 11 December 1940, the concerto received its first performance in Madrid, at the Teatro Español de Madrid conducted by Jesús Arámbarri, with the same soloist. The United States premiere was given by Rey de la Torre on 19 November 1959, with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by Robert Shaw.

==Structure==
This concerto is in three movements, &quot;Allegro con spirito&quot;, &quot;Adagio&quot; and &quot;Allegro gentile&quot;. The first and last movements are in D major, while the famous middle movement is in B minor. Along with the solo guitar, it is scored for an orchestra consisting of two flutes (one doubling on piccolo), two oboes (one doubling on cor anglais), two clarinets in B, two bassoons, two horns in F, two trumpets in C, and strings.

===First movement===
The first movement&#x27;s 40-measure introduction begins with the solo guitar strumming a three-measure theme in . The theme is made of tonic, supertonic, and dominant chords and features a flamenco-like hemiola rhythm. As it repeats several times, the tonic chord&#x27;s uppermost note gets higher, starting with the third, then using the fifth, the tonic, and the fifth again.

;Introduction (guitar)
;1st theme (1st oboe and 1st violins)
;2nd theme (guitar, D major to E major)
===Second movement===
The second movement in B minor, the best-known of the three, is marked by its slow pace and quiet melody, introduced by the cor anglais, with a soft accompaniment by the guitar and strings. A feeling of quiet regret permeates the piece. Ornamentation is added gradually to the melody in the beginning. An off-tonic trill in the guitar creates the first seeds of tension in the piece; they grow and take hold, but relax back to the melody periodically. Eventually, a climactic build-up starts. This breaks back into the main melody, molto appassionato, voiced by the strings with accompaniment from the woodwinds. The piece finally resolves to a calm arpeggio from the guitar, though it is the strings in the background rather than the guitar&#x27;s final note that resolve the piece.

;Theme (English horn)
===Third movement===
The third movement is in mixed metre, alternating between and . At the beginning of the movement, four-measure phrases containing 9 beats in total are formed from one measure followed by three measures. As the movement progresses, the metre becomes more irregular. It begins with the guitar starting the theme in the &quot;wrong&quot; key of B major, but the orchestra restates it in the home key of D major.

==Interpretations==
The concerto was recorded for the first time in either 1947 or 1948 by guitarist Regino Sainz de la Maza with the Orquesta Nacional de España, conducted by Ataúlfo Argenta, on 78 rpm records. This recording was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame. Narciso Yepes then made two early recordings of the Aranjuez, both also with Argenta – one in mono with the Madrid Chamber Orchestra (released between 1953 and 1955), and the second in stereo with the Orquesta Nacional de España (recorded in 1957 and released in 1959). Although Ida Presti gave the French premiere of the &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; in 1948, the first female classical guitarist to record the concerto was Renata Tarragó (1958 or 1959) – who played with fingertips rather than fingernails – accompanied by the Orquesta de Conciertos de Madrid, conducted by Odón Alonso. William Yeoman provides a discographical survey of recordings of the concerto in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine. Due to his extremely lengthy recording career, Julian Bream had ample room to record Joaquín Rodrigo&#x27;s &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; five times. Four of those recordings appeared on record albums and one was recorded on film for the final segment of the film series &quot;¡Guitarra! A Musical Journey Through Spain&quot;. Each time Julian Bream used a different combination of orchestra and conductor. Charo has played the Concerto in concert and in an album.

Until asked to perform and interpret &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; in 1991, the Spanish flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation, and José María Gallardo Del Rey advised and directed him musically. De Lucía claimed in &quot;Paco de Lucía-Light and Shade: A Portrait&quot; that he gave greater emphasis to rhythmical accuracy in his interpretation of the Concierto at the expense of the perfect tone preferred by classical guitarists. Composer Joaquín Rodrigo later declared that no one had ever played his composition in such a brilliant manner.

At the request of Nicanor Zabaleta, Rodrigo transcribed the Concierto for harp and orchestra in 1974.

Jazz musician Miles Davis reinterpreted the second movement of the work on his album &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; (1960), in the company of arranger Gil Evans. Davis stated: &quot;That melody is so strong that the softer you play it, the stronger it gets, and the stronger you play it, the weaker it gets.&quot; Columbia, the label that released Sketches of Spain, had not asked the composer for permission to record or adapt his music, and Rodrigo did not learn of the recording until after its release in 1960, when the blind jazz pianist Tete Montoliu, who claimed to have been the first person in Spain to own a copy of the album, played it for the maestro and his family. Rodrigo was irate that the American record label had used his music without permission. Aside from the fact that he, as the composer, had not been asked for permission, “which he considered a violation of moral rights,&quot; Rodrigo also tried to block the jazz and pop recordings from being released, before realizing, &quot;In the end, the composer resigned himself to accept the fact that the pop versions reached a far greater public than that of classical music concertgoers, and led to much wider recognition of the original classical concerto for guitar and orchestra, &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot;.&quot; In fact, &quot;Rodrigo changed his mind and came to accept the subsequent jazz recordings of his music in part because the legal terms of use were resolved (Ediciones Joaquín Rodrigo now owns the Gil Evans arrangement), but also in part because these versions, far from obliterating the original guitar concerto, have helped disseminate it.&quot; The composer&#x27;s wife, Victoria Kamhi, was very harsh in her memoir, however, referring to the Miles Davis recording as &quot;an act of piracy.&quot; She described how Rodrigo attempted to sue the SGAE in February 1967 in the Palace of Justice for authorizing the transcription of the Concierto for trumpet and jazz, which Davis recorded, but, &quot;we lost the case, for the judge&#x27;s opinion was that, since Miles Davis&#x27; record had granted authors&#x27; rights to Joaquín, he had no redress against the SGAE.&quot;

<text>The International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR) is a non-governmental organization founded in 1914 in response to the horrors of war in Europe. Today IFOR counts 71 branches, groups and affiliates in 48 countries on all continents. IFOR members promote nonviolence, human rights and reconciliation through public education efforts, training programs and campaigns. The IFOR International Secretariat in Utrecht, Netherlands facilitates communication among IFOR members, links branches to capacity building resources, provides training in gender-sensitive nonviolence through the Women Peacemakers Program, and helps coordinate international campaigns, delegations and urgent actions. IFOR has ECOSOC status at the United Nations.

== History ==
=== Origins in wartime ===
The first body to use the name &quot;Fellowship of Reconciliation&quot; was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War by two Christians, Henry Hodgkin (an English Quaker) and Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze (a German Lutheran), who were participating in a Christian pacifist conference in Konstanz, southern Germany (near Switzerland), where the World Alliance for the promotion international Friendship through the Churches (World Alliance, WA) was formed. According to the mythotology of the IFOR, on the platform of the railway station at Cologne, they pledged to each other that, &quot;We are one in Christ and can never be at war&quot;.

After coming into his home country, Hodgkins invited his Quaker – and often socialist – friends, such as Kees Boeke, to organize a conference in Cambridge in 1915, in which the &quot;Fellowship of Reconciliation&quot; (FOR England) was established. The German branch, Versöhnungsbund, was founded later. It held its first conference in 1932, but in 1933, when Hitler came to power, it dissolved. Schultze was arrested 27 times during World War I and was forced to live in exile during the Nazi period. FOR Germany was officially reestablished just in 1956 with Dr Siegmund Schultze as president.
Shortly after the Cambridge conference, in the autumn of 1915, Henry Hodgkin went over to America and, 11 and 12 November, the American Fellowship was founded during a Conference at Garden City, Long Island. More than a thousand members enrolled in the American Fellowship before and during the war, which, for the US, begun on 6 April 1917. Also, Cornelius Boeke made a trip to Europe, where he established international social networks for the work of FOR. Because of this and the peace work of Boeke, he was deported to his home country Holland by the national court of England.

During the war time, Fellowship of Reconciliation focused its activities mainly on trying to influence public opinion, to help victims of war and war prisoners. 600 people in England went to prison for helping more than 16.000 imprisoned during the war. When conscription began in Britain in 1916 and in the United States many FOR members refused military service. Many of the members of the FOR were accused for supporting of being pro-German because of their peace endeavours and this led even to physical assaults of the members of FOR.

=== After World War One: strengthening the international movement ===
After the end of war, in 1919, the deported Kees Boeke and Henry Hodgkin met in Holland, where they decided to organize the first international conference, which led to the formation of &quot;Movement towards a Christian international&quot; (Christian international), which later became the &quot;International Fellowship of Reconciliation.&quot; The conference was held in Boekes house in the town of Bilthoven where 50 pacifists from ten different countries met. Many of the pacifists became straight to Bilthoven from the conference of World Alliance organized in Haag day before. In relation to the Peace Movement of World Alliance, the conferees wanted to establish organization that has its basis more in Christian socialism. Through their work they wanted to oppose the revolutionary ideas of the Communist International and offer a better solution for social justice. In their first declaration, the conferees said that they want to follow the revolutionary ideals of Christ in order to achieve a Christian revolution that is based on love and nonviolence.

The first headquarters of the Christian international was in Holland. Later, in 1923, Headquarters were moved to England, when the movements name was transformed to IFOR. This International Fellowship of Reconciliation became an umbrella organisation to which national branches of Fellowship of Reconciliation affiliated themselves as members.

IFOR first secretary was the Swiss pacifist Pierre Cérésole jailed several times for his peace witness. He established the Service Civil (International Voluntary Service for Peace), initially organizing work camps in areas torn apart by war, with volunteers from former enemy countries. Relief for the victims of war was carried out, and international conferences and meetings spread the work of peace to many other parts of the globe. Immediately after Bilthoven IFOR appointed travelling secretaries such as John Nevin Sayre, André Trocmé, Muriel Lester, Henri Rose and Percy Bartlett. They travelled carrying the Fellowship&#x27;s messages around Europe, in Scandinavia, Central Europe, Poland, the Baltic States and the Balkans, giving life to several international conferences that took place between the two world wars. The first one gathered 200 delegates from 20 nations (also India, Burma and Ukraine) in Sonntagberg in Austria. Many others followed and, in such a tense historical moment, IFOR members discussed about the necessity of disarmament and of a new role of Churches, asking clergymen to make a strong stand against the idea of &quot;righteous wars&quot;. In 1932, the IFOR led a Youth Crusade across Europe in support of the Geneva World Disarmament Conference. Protestants and Catholics from all over converged on Geneva by various routes, reaching over 50,000 people and presenting to the Conference a petition calling for total disarmament among the nations.

=== Ambassadors of Reconciliation ===
At the end of the 1930s, given the unstable international situation, IFOR established Embassies of Reconciliation that initiated peace efforts not only in Europe but in Japan and China as well. &quot;Ambassadors of Reconciliation&quot;, such as George Lansbury, Muriel Lester and Anne Seesholtz, visited many world leaders, including Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Leon Blum and Franklin D Roosevelt. Muriel Lester, English social worker, served as IFOR travelling secretary throughout the world, helping to establish its work in many countries. She met Mahatma Gandhi, first in London when, in 1931, he spent some time at Kingsley Hall, a community center with educational, social and recreational purposes, run by her and her sister Doris, and then in India when she went with him in Bihar on his anti-untouchability tour during 1934. When World War II broke out, travels and communications became almost impossible. In many countries IFOR members suffered persecution for publicly preaching pacifism. IFOR&#x27;s members, especially in America tried by inter-church mediation to find ways of ending the war, to help conscientious objectors, and struggled against internment of Japanese Americans. In France, IFOR members André and Magda Trocmé, with the help of the villagers of le Chambon sur Lignon, saved the lives of thousands of Jews escaping the Holocaust. In Belgium, feminist Magda Yoors Peeters defends Jewish refugees and conscientious objectors.

=== Supporting nonviolent movements around the world ===
After the war, travelling secretaries continued their work. IFOR branches and affiliates in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East grew consistently also thanks to the work of Jean Goss and Hildegard Goss-Mayr from Paris and Vienna, three times nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. New Zealand pacifist Ormond Burton represented the IFOR in that nation. From such labors arose Servicio Paz y Justicia (SERPAJ) throughout Latin America. SERPAJ&#x27;s founder Adolfo Perez Esquivel from Argentina was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1980. SERPAJ participated in the nonviolent resistance to Chile&#x27;s 16-year-long military dictatorship, which culminates in free elections that restored democracy. Hildegard Goss-Mayrs&#x27; training in active nonviolence contributed significantly to the people power overthrow of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines in 1986, as well as the growth of nonviolent movements in Asia and Africa. The Goss-Mayrs, IFOR Honorary Presidents, were central to the global spread of active nonviolence movement.

== Members ==
IFOR has 71 member organizations in 48 countries in all continents.

== How IFOR works ==

=== Decade for a Culture of Nonviolence ===
Since the initiation of the United Nations Decade for a Culture of Peace and Nonviolence for the Children of the World, in 2001, IFOR members have been active in working for peace education and in working to establish national coalitions to support the Decade.

=== Nonviolence education and training ===
IFOR assists groups and individuals to find ways in which they can transform conflicts into positive and growth oriented interactions that involve dialogue and lead to reconciliation. The Nonviolent Education Program aims at supporting sustainable implementation of nonviolence/nonviolent education, peace education and violence prevention in compulsory kindergarten and school education and thus consequent implementation of Children&#x27;s Rights expressed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is done through various presentations and training programs, as well as through the creation of resource materials and contact with trainers and resource people.

=== Youth empowerment ===
Thanks to the Youth Working Group, IFOR provides young people with the skills and opportunities to become active peacemakers. This is done through nonviolence and leadership training, campaigning, and through internships with IFOR branches and groups, or with the International Secretariat.

=== Interfaith cooperation ===
Religion has on occasion played a central role in fomenting conflict but can also be a source of inspiration and leadership for peace. IFOR sponsors interfaith delegations to areas of conflict and publishes material on nonviolence from different religious traditions.

=== Disarmament ===
Since its founding, IFOR has opposed war and preparations for war. IFOR members support conscientious objectors, campaign for a ban on land mines, and oppose nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction. During their annual meeting, European members from different branches of the International Fellowship of Reconciliation issued the Declaration of Prali, in occasion of the Global day of Action on Military Spending, 17 April 2012. The Peace and Constitution Committee Working Group promotes actions to raise awareness on the article 9 of the Japanese Constitution which denounces war and war-preparation activities.

=== Gender justice ===
In 2006 IFOR adopted a Gender Policy in which IFOR recognizes that there is a continuum of violence against women that must be confronted, from family violence in the private sphere to armed conflict in the public sphere. Unequal power relations between women and men are one root of violence, conflict and militarization, where women are often severely abused. Gender justice means that women and men can equally contribute to and benefit from peace building, non-violent conflict resolution and reconciliation. This gender policy recognizes that gender equality is an integral part of IFOR&#x27;s fundamental values and is a core spiritual value. A transformation of the power relations between women and men is a prerequisite for a culture of peace and non-violence, and must be promoted throughout IFOR. The Women Peacemaker Program (WPP) is an IFOR program that works to ensure the possibility for women&#x27;s access to peace negotiations and promotes the application of IFOR&#x27;s Gender Policy.

The successful program has been institutionalized by the end of 2012.

== International representation ==
IFOR maintains permanent representatives at the United Nations (UN) in New York, Geneva, Vienna and Paris (UNESCO) who regularly participate in conferences and meetings of UN bodies, providing testimony and expertise from different regional perspectives, promoting non-violent alternatives in the fields of human rights, development, and disarmament. 
IFOR has observer and consultative status to the United Nations, United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and UNESCO organizations.

<text>Baily is the remnant of a lunar impact crater on the boundary between Mare Frigoris to the north and Lacus Mortis to the south. The crater interior has been flooded by lava in the past, and only the northern half of the crater rim remains relatively intact. There is an outward bulge in the northeastern rim, possibly the remnant of another crater formation that once overlapped Baily. The crater interior is flat and relatively featureless, with no impacts of significance. The surviving outer rim reaches a maximum elevation of about 0.5 km.

The nearest crater of note is Bürg to the south-southwest. Further to the west is the prominent Aristoteles.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Baily.

<doc id="1067852" wikidata="Q3846893" url="?curid=1067852" title="Margaret Wake, 3rd Baroness Wake of Liddell">
<text>Margaret Wake, &quot;suo jure&quot; 3rd Baroness Wake of Liddell and Countess of Kent ( – 19 September 1349), was the wife of Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, the youngest surviving son of Edward I of England and Margaret of France.

==Family==

She was the daughter of John Wake, 1st Baron Wake of Liddell (son of Baldwin Wake and Hawise de Quincy) and Joan de Fiennes. By her grandmother Hawise, she was the great-granddaughter of Elen, daughter of Llywelyn the Great (Prince of Gwynedd) and Joan, Lady of Wales (the illegitimate daughter of John of England). Her mother, Joan de Fiennes, was a daughter of William de Fiennes and Blanche de Brienne. She was a sister of Margaret de Fiennes, making Wake a cousin of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March (himself the great-grandson of Gwladus Ddu, Elen&#x27;s sister). Joan de Fiennes also descended from John of Brienne and Berengaria of León, herself the granddaughter of Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile.

== Marriages and issue ==
Margaret married John Comyn IV of Badenoch ( – 1314) around 1312, son of the John Comyn who was murdered by King Robert the Bruce in 1306. Her husband John died at the Battle of Bannockburn, and their only child, Aymer Comyn (1314–1316), died as a toddler.

She married, for a second time, Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, the sixth son of King Edward I of England, and the second by his second wife Margaret of France. They received a papal dispensation in October 1325, and the wedding probably took place at Christmas. He was executed for treason in 1330.

Through her marriage to Edmund of Woodstock, Margaret was the mother of four children:

* Edmund, 2nd Earl of Kent (c.1326– 5 October 1331).
* Margaret of Kent, Viscountess of Tartas (1327-1352). She married Arnaud Amanieu VII d&#x27;Albret.

* Joan of Kent (29 September 1326/1327 – 7 August 1385), known as the &quot;Fair Maid of Kent&quot;. She married firstly Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, son of Robert de Holland, 1st Baron Holand and Maud la Zouche; secondly William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury, son of William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury and Catherine Grandison (the marriage was annulled); and thirdly Edward, the Black Prince, the eldest son and heir apparent of King Edward III of England and Queen Philippa of Hainault. She was the mother of King Richard II of England.
* John, 3rd Earl of Kent (7 April 1330 – 26 December 1352). He married Isabella of Julich (also known as Elizabeth), daughter of William V, Duke of Jülich, and Joanna of Hainaut.

After the execution of her second husband, the pregnant Margaret and her children were confined to Arundel Castle in Sussex. Her brother Thomas Wake, 2nd Baron Wake of Liddell was accused of treason but later pardoned.

When King Edward III of England reached his majority and overthrew the regents a few months later, he took in Margaret and her children and treated them as his own family. Margaret briefly succeeded her brother as Baroness Wake of Liddell in 1349, but died during an outbreak of the plague in September 1349.

Through their grandson, Thomas Holland, Margaret and her husband Edmund&#x27;s descendants included both Edward IV (via Thomas&#x27;s eldest &quot;and&quot; second daughters, Alinor and Joan) and Henry Tudor (via Thomas&#x27;s third daughter, Margaret), from both of whom every English monarch from Henry VIII onwards descends. Thomas&#x27;s daughter Margaret was also ancestor of every king of Scotland from James II, while Alinor was also ancestor of royal spouses Anne Neville and Catherine Parr.

==Depictions in fiction==

Margaret is a supporting character in the Karen Harper historical fiction novel &quot;The First Princess of Wales&quot;, which gives a fictional depiction of her daughter Joan of Kent&#x27;s life at the English court.

Margaret is a character in the 2014 novel &quot;A Triple Knot&quot; by Emma Campion which primarily focuses on her daughter Joan of Kent&#x27;s struggle to validate her secret marriage to Thomas Holland after her family forces her into a marriage with William Montacute, and her close, often uncomfortable relationship with her cousin and future husband Edward, Prince of Wales.

<doc id="1067857" wikidata="Q1185919" url="?curid=1067857" title="Democritus (crater)">
<text>Democritus is a lunar impact crater that is located on the northern part of the Moon, just to the north of the Mare Frigoris. Just to the south of Democritus is the lava-flooded crater Gärtner, which forms a bay on the mare. Directly to the north is Arnold, another flooded formation.

==Description==
The rim of Democritus is generally sharp-edged and shows little sign of erosion. It forms not quite a circle, with outward notch-like bulges that give it a slightly irregular shape. The inner walls have single or double s that lead down to a relatively flat interior floor. Near the midpoint of the crater is a small central peak.

==Names==
Democritus is named after the Greek philosopher of the same name. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names: Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Alfonsi IX Reg. Cast.&quot; after Alfonso IX of León and Castile, and Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Mons Bontas&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Democritus.

It lies to the southeast of the crater Sacrobosco, and southwest of Polybius. To the northwest along the same flank of the formation is the crater Fermat.

The rim of Pons is somewhat elongated in shape, being longer along a northeast–southwest axis than in the perpendicular direction. The outer wall is irregular and notched, particularly at the northeastern end where it is partly overlain by the satellite crater Pons D and multiple smaller formations. The interior is uneven, with low ridges projecting from the north and southeastern rims.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pons.

<text>Khairpur (Sindhi, ) is a city and the capital of the Khairpur District of Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh province.

==History==
The Talpur dynasty was established in 1783 by Mir Fateh Ali Khan, who declared himself the first &quot;Rais&quot;, or ruler of Sindh, after defeating the Kalhoras at the Battle of Halani.

The death of Mir Sohrab Khan Talpur, founder of the Khairpur branch abdicated power to his eldest son Mir Rustam Ali Khan, in 1811.
Rustam ruled until 1842, when he abdicated in favor of his youngest brother Mir Ali Murad. Ali Murad helped the British in 1845-7 during the Turki campaign, but was later accused of plotting against the British in 1851–2, and so was stripped of his lands in upper Sindh by the British East India Company. As a result, the remaining land under his control consisted mostly of Khairpur city, and its immediate environs. During the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny, Ali Murad sided with the British, and prevented rebels from seizing the Shikarpur jail and treasury. He regained the favour of the British, and in 1866, the British promised to recognize any future successors as rightful rulers of Khairpur.

Ali Murad&#x27;s eldest son had predeceased him, and so he was succeeded by his second son, Mir Faiz Muhammad Khan, who ruled until his death 1909. He was in turn succeeded by his son, Mir Imam Bakhsh Khan Talpur, who aided the British war effort during World War I, and was thus awarded the honorary title Lieutenant Colonel in 1918. He died in 1921, and was succeeded by Mir Ali Nawaz Khan. Under his rule, the feudal &quot;Cherr&quot; system of forced labour was abolished, while new canals were laid for irrigation.

<doc id="1067891" wikidata="Q1786521" url="?curid=1067891" title="A Hard Day's Night (song)">
<text>&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles. Credited to Lennon–McCartney, it was primarily written by John Lennon, with some minor collaboration from Paul McCartney. It was released on the soundtrack album &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; in 1964. It was also released as a single in the UK (with &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; as its B-side), and in the US (with &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; as its B-side.)

The song featured prominently in the Beatles&#x27; first feature film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The song topped the charts in both the United Kingdom and United States when it was released as a single. The American and British singles of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, as well as both the American and British albums of the same title, held the top position in their respective charts simultaneously for a couple of weeks in August 1964, the first time any artist had accomplished this feat.

==Title==
The song&#x27;s title originated from something said by Ringo Starr, the Beatles&#x27; drummer. Starr described it this way in an interview with disc jockey Dave Hull in 1964: &quot;We went to do a job, and we&#x27;d worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, &#x27;It&#x27;s been a hard day …&#x27; and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, &#x27;… night!&#x27; So we came to &#x27;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night.&#x27;&quot;

Starr&#x27;s statement was the inspiration for the title of the film, which in turn inspired the composition of the song. According to Lennon in a 1980 interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine: &quot;I was going home in the car and Dick Lester [director of the movie] suggested the title, &#x27;Hard Day&#x27;s Night&#x27; from something Ringo had said. I had used it in &quot;In His Own Write&quot; [a book Lennon was writing then], but it was an off-the-cuff remark by Ringo. You know, one of those malapropisms. A Ringo-ism, where he said it not to be funny … just said it. So Dick Lester said, &#x27;We are going to use that title.&#x27;&quot;

In a 1994 interview for &quot;The Beatles Anthology&quot;, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon&#x27;s recollections, basically stating that it was the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come up with the idea of using Starr&#x27;s verbal misstep: &quot;The title was Ringo&#x27;s. We&#x27;d almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we&#x27;d not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session … and we said, &#x27;Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.&#x27; Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical … they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong. And he said after a concert, &#x27;Phew, it&#x27;s been a hard day&#x27;s night.&#x27;&quot;

In 1996, yet another version of events cropped up. In an Associated Press report, the producer of the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Walter Shenson, stated that Lennon described to Shenson some of Starr&#x27;s funnier gaffes, including &quot;a hard day&#x27;s night&quot;, whereupon Shenson immediately decided that that was going to be the title of the movie (replacing other alternatives, including &quot;Beatlemania&quot;). Shenson then told Lennon that he needed a theme song for the film.

==Composition==
Lennon dashed off the song in one night, and brought it in for comments the following morning. As he described in his 1980 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, &quot;the next morning I brought in the song … &#x27;cuz there was a little competition between Paul and I as to who got the A-side – who got the hits. If you notice, in the early days the majority of singles, in the movies and everything, were mine … in the early period I&#x27;m dominating the group … The reason Paul sang on &#x27;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&#x27; (in the bridge) is because I couldn&#x27;t reach the notes.&quot; However, McCartney and others remember McCartney collaborating with Lennon.

On 16 April 1964, the Beatles gathered at Studio 2 of the EMI Studios and recorded &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. It took them less than three hours to polish the song for its final release, eventually selecting the ninth take as the one to be released. &quot;Evening Standard&quot; journalist Maureen Cleave described a memorable taxi ride the morning the song was recorded:

In the Associated Press report, Shenson described his recollection of what happened. At 8:30 in the morning, &quot;There were John and Paul with guitars at the ready and all the lyrics scribbled on matchbook covers. They played it and the next night recorded it.&quot; Shenson declared, &quot;It had the right beat and the arrangement was brilliant. These guys were geniuses.&quot;

==Opening chord==

&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; is widely known for its iconic Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string guitar&#x27;s &quot;mighty opening chord&quot; played by George Harrison. According to George Martin, &quot;We knew it would open both the film and the soundtrack LP, so we wanted a particularly strong and effective beginning. The strident guitar chord was the perfect launch,&quot; having what Ian MacDonald called &quot;a significance in Beatles lore matched only by the concluding E major of &#x27;A Day in the Life&#x27;, the two opening and closing the group&#x27;s middle period of peak creativity&quot;.

According to musicologist Jeremy Summerly, &quot;the sound of this chord is the most discussed pop opening of all time.&quot; Analysis of the chord has been much debated, it having been described as G7add9sus4, G7sus4, or G11sus4 and others below.

Part of the chord is an Fadd9 as confirmed by Harrison during an online chat on 15 February 2001:

According to Walter Everett the opening chord has an introductory dominant function because McCartney plays D in the bass: Harrison and Martin play F A C G, over the bass D, on twelve-string guitar and piano respectively, giving the chord a mixture-coloured neighbour, F; two diatonic neighbours, A and C; plus an anticipation of the tonic, G – the major subtonic as played on guitar being a borrowed chord commonly used by the Beatles, first in &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot; (see mode mixture), and later in &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; and &quot;Got to Get You into My Life&quot; (in the latter two against a tonic pedal).

Alan W. Pollack also interprets the chord as a surrogate dominant, the G being an anticipation that resolves on the G major chord that opens the verse. He suggests it is a mixture of D minor, F major, and G major (missing the B). Tony Bacon calls it a Dm7sus4 (D F G A C), which is the minor seventh chord (plus the fourth, G) (for more information regarding chord functions see diatonic function).

Everett points out that the chord relates to the Beatles&#x27; interest in pandiatonic harmony.

Dominic Pedler has also provided an interpretation of the chord, with the Beatles and George Martin playing the following:
*George Harrison: Fadd9 in 1st position on Rickenbacker 360/12 12-string electric guitar
*John Lennon: Fadd9 in 1st position on a Gibson J-160E 6-string acoustic guitar
*Paul McCartney: high D3 played on the D-string, 12th fret on Hofner 500/1 electric bass
*George Martin: D2-G2-D3 played on a Steinway Grand Piano
*Ringo Starr: subtle snare drum and ride cymbal

This gives the notes:
G-B-D-F-A-C (the B is a harmonic). One of the interesting things about this chord (as described by Pedler) is how McCartney&#x27;s high bass note reverberates inside the soundbox of Lennon&#x27;s acoustic guitar and begins to be picked up on Lennon&#x27;s microphone or pick-up during the sounding of the chord. This gives the chord its special &quot;wavy&quot; and unstable quality. Pedler describes the effect as a &quot;virtual pull-off&quot;.

In 2004, Jason Brown, a mathematics professor at Dalhousie University, published a report titled &quot;Mathematics, Physics and &#x27;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&#x27;&quot;, in which he analysed the properties of the song&#x27;s opening chord using Fourier transforms. He concluded that Martin&#x27;s piano contribution provided the important element in the chord beside Harrison&#x27;s playing. In November the following year, &quot;Wired&quot; published an article on Brown&#x27;s use of Celemony&#x27;s Melodyne Editor with Direct Note Access technology to further analyse the chord. Brown&#x27;s findings were partly challenged in 2012 by another mathematician, Kevin Houston from the University of Leeds. Houston, who also used a Fourier transform, attributed a greater importance in Lennon&#x27;s contribution on acoustic guitar, rather than the piano notes played by Martin.

Harrison played a repeated guitar arpeggio, outlining the notes of the opening chord, thereby ending the song in a circular fashion. Martin said that the ending was his idea: &quot;Again, that&#x27;s film writing. I was stressing to them the importance of making the song fit, not actually finishing it but dangling on so that you&#x27;re into the next mood.&quot; The song contains 12 other chords.

==Music==

The song is composed in the key of G major and in a time signature. The verse features the VII or major subtonic chord that was a part of the opening chord as an ornament or embellishment below the tonic. Transposed down a perfect fifth, the modal frame of the song though pentatonic features a ladder of thirds axially centred on G with a ceiling note of B and floor note of E (the low C being a passing tone).

According to Middleton, the song, &quot;at first glance major-key-with-modal-touches&quot;, reveals through its &quot;Line of Latent Mode&quot; &quot;a deep kinship with typical blues melodic structures: it is centred on three of the notes of the minor-pentatonic mode (E-G-B), with the contradictory major seventh (B) set against that. Moreover, the &quot;shape&quot; assumed by these notes – the modal &quot;frame&quot; – as well as the abstract scale they represent, is revealed, too; and this – an initial, repeated circling round the dominant (G), with an excursion to its minor third (B), &#x27;answered&#x27; by a fall to the &#x27;symmetrical&#x27; minor third of the tonic (E) – is a common pattern in blues.&quot;

Lennon opens the twelve-measure-long verse and carries it along, suddenly joined at the end by McCartney, who then sings the bridge.

===Recording===
During the recording of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Lennon and McCartney doubletracked their vocals throughout including the chorus. Lennon sings the lead vocal on the verses and Paul sings lead on the middle eight. During the chorus, McCartney handles the high harmony and Lennon the low harmony. Take 7 reveals that the lyrics were still not set with Lennon singing &quot;you make me feel all right&quot; and McCartney and Harrison still unsteady with their respective lines, ending with Lennon chiding them with the line &quot;I heard a funny chord&quot;.

The instrumental break is played by Harrison on a Rickenbacker 12-string guitar, with Martin doubling on a piano, recorded to tape at half-speed and then sped up to normal. Recording this solo was the most time-consuming aspect of the session. A take that appeared on a bootleg in the 1980s shows Harrison making errors in his playing. In the description of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s editors: &quot;But by the time the session ended at 10 that night, he had sculpted one of his most memorable solos – an upward run played twice and capped with a circular flourish, with the church-bell chime of his guitar echoed on piano by Martin.&quot;

The song closes with Harrison playing an arpeggio of the opening chord (Fadd9) during the fade-out.

===Lyrics===
The lyrics speak about the singer&#x27;s devotion to his lover, and how he works so she can buy the things she wants. The singer sings about his tiredness when he comes home from work, but how the things that his lover does perk him up.

==Release and reception==
&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was first released to the United States, coming out on 26 June 1964 on the album &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, the soundtrack to the film, and released by United Artists. It was the first song to be released before single release (see below).

The United Kingdom first heard &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; when it was released there on 10 July 1964, both on the album &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, and as a single, backed with &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; on the B-side. Both the album and single were released by Parlophone Records. The single began charting on 18 July 1964, a week later ousting the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot; from the top spot on the British charts on 25 July 1964, coincidentally the day when both the American and British albums too hit the peak of their respective charts. The single stayed on top for three weeks, and lasted another nine weeks in the charts afterwards.

The American single on 1 August started a two-week-long run at the top, setting a new record – nobody before had ever held the number one position on both the album and singles charts in the United Kingdom and the United States at the same time. The Beatles were the only ones who had done this until 1970 when Simon and Garfunkel achieved the same feat with their album &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; and its title track.

The song was the fifth of seven songs by the Beatles to hit number 1 in a one-year period, an all-time record on the US charts. In order, these were &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;. It was also the sixth of seven songs written by Lennon-McCartney to hit number 1 in 1964, an all-time record on the US charts for writing the most songs to hit number 1 in the same calendar year (see List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones).

The song&#x27;s opening chord and closing arpeggios were highly influential on the Byrds. After watching the film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and seeing Harrison&#x27;s choice of guitar, Roger McGuinn adopted the Rickenbacker as his and the Byrds&#x27; signature instrument. In this way, according to author Andrew Grant Jackson, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; &quot;birthed&quot; the folk-rock sound that the Byrds popularised in 1965. That same year, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Performance by a Vocal Group. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the song at number 153 on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald:
*John Lennon – double-tracked vocals (verses), acoustic rhythm guitar
*Paul McCartney – double-tracked vocals (middle-eight), harmony vocal, bass
*George Harrison – lead electric twelve-string guitar
*Ringo Starr – drums, bongos, cowbell
*George Martin – piano, producer

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was used as wake-up music on Space Shuttle Missions STS-30, STS-61, and STS-69.
* The song was played to conclude the Channel Four breakfast programme &quot;The Channel Four Daily&quot; in 1992.

==Live renditions==
The Beatles regularly played the song live throughout 1964 and 1965.

During his 2016 One on One tour, Paul McCartney played the song for the first time as a solo artist and for the first time by a Beatle in half a century. The Beatles played it for the last time on 31 August 1965 at the Cow Palace in Daly City, California.

==Cover versions==
Many artists have covered the song. Peter Sellers made a comedy version in which he recited the lyrics in the style of Laurence Olivier in the film &quot;Richard III&quot;. Sellers&#x27; recording was a UK Top 20 hit in 1965. A version by Ramsey Lewis reached number 11 in Canada in February 1966.

<text>New Burlington is a former town located in Chester Township in the northwestern corner of Clinton County, Ohio, off Ohio State Route 380. The GNIS classifies it as a populated place. It was acquired by the United States federal government when Caesar Creek was dammed and a reservoir created in the 1970s.

==History==
New Burlington was laid out in 1833, and named after Burlington, North Carolina, the native home of a share of the first settlers. A post office called New Burlington was established in 1837, and remained in operation until 1971. New Burlington was a &quot;station&quot; on the Underground Railroad.

<text>A chipolata () is a type of fresh sausage, likely created in France. Sausages by that name appear in the 1903 edition of Escoffier&#x27;s &quot;Le guide culinaire&quot;. Chipolatas are often prepared as a relatively thin and short sausage.

Chipolatas are typically made from coarse-ground pork seasoned with salt and pepper together with herbs and spices—according to the particular recipe—such as sage, thyme, pimento, or nutmeg.
 The word is French and probably derives from the Italian , which essentially means &quot;made with onions&quot; and according to some sources may have referred to an onion stew with sausages.

Chipolatas are common in the United Kingdom. They frequently appear as part of a Christmas dinner wrapped in streaky bacon as pigs in blankets.

<doc id="1067911" wikidata="Q1804942" url="?curid=1067911" title="Centre College">
<text>Centre College, formally Centre College of Kentucky, is a private liberal arts college in Danville, Kentucky, United States. Chartered by the Kentucky General Assembly in 1819, the college is a member of the Associated Colleges of the South and the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities. It has an enrollment of about 1,400 students.

==History==
The Kentucky General Assembly established Centre College on January 21, 1819. The college was named for its approximate location in the geographic &quot;centre&quot; of the Commonwealth, using early-nineteenth-century America&#x27;s contemporaneous spelling of the word. The legislature placed many of Kentucky&#x27;s most prominent citizens in charge of Centre College&#x27;s Board of Trustees, including James G. Birney, who represented Danville in the Kentucky House of Representatives, and chairman Isaac Shelby, the Commonwealth&#x27;s first governor. Classes began in the fall of 1820 in Old Centre, the first building on campus and the oldest college administration building west of the Allegheny Mountains. The students were all male, a policy that would hold until 1930, and none were African-American, which would change only in 1961.
In its early years, Centre navigated financial hardships, disputes within and outside the Presbyterian Church, and six wars, including the occupation of Old Centre by both Confederate and Union troops during the Civil War. A Centre alumnus, John Todd Stuart, played a formative role in American history by encouraging Abraham Lincoln to study for the bar, providing his first set of law books, and serving as Lincoln&#x27;s professional and political mentor. In 1835, future Liberian Vice President James M. Priest applied to study theology; his application, like all those from Black people, was rejected. From 1830 to 1857, President John C. Young oversaw a vast enlargement of the faculty and a five-fold increase in the student body. 

Following the Civil War, Centre affiliated itself with several other educational institutions. From 1894 until 1912, J. Proctor Knott, a former Kentucky governor and U.S. congressman, operated a law school at Centre as its dean. The Centre College Board of Trustees controlled the Kentucky School for the Deaf, also in Danville, during its early years; consolidated the college with the Central University in Richmond, Kentucky in 1901; from the time of the merger with Central University in 1901 until 1918 Centre College went by the name Central University of Kentucky. It merged with Danville&#x27;s Kentucky College for Women in 1930, although the women did not move onto Centre&#x27;s campus until 1962. 

During the 1960s the college&#x27;s financial resources doubled. Eleven new buildings were added to the campus and enrollment increased from 450 to 800. In 1988, Centre set a national record when it achieved a 75.4% participation rate for alumni giving, a mark that remains unbroken to this day. From the late twentieth century to the present, strong levels of alumni giving and participation—often the highest in the nation—fueled the college&#x27;s growth. Today, enrollment is around 1,300 with nearly 150 faculty members. Milton C. Moreland, who took office in 2020, is the current president, Centre&#x27;s 21st. In 2000, Centre became the smallest college ever to host a national election debate. Dick Cheney and Senator Joe Lieberman debated on October 5 at Centre&#x27;s Norton Center for the Arts with CNN&#x27;s Bernard Shaw acting as moderator. In 2012, Centre again hosted a vice presidential debate in the Norton Center for the Arts, which featured Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan.

The physical campus has changed substantially during the 21st century. In 2005, the college completed The College Centre, a $22-million project to expand and renovate Suttcliffe Hall, the Crounse Academic Center and Grace Doherty Library, which was the largest construction project on campus since the Norton Center was built in 1973. Additionally, a new student residence, Pearl Hall, was completed in 2008; a new campus center opened in October 2009; and the construction of a new science wing in Young Hall was completed in the fall of 2010. In August 2011, Centre announced the construction of Brockman Residential Commons, a 125-bed facility offering apartment and townhouse living for upperclassmen. The residence facility was completed at the beginning of the 2012–13 school year. In 2021, the college completed renovations of the Austin E. Knowlton Center for Science and Mathematics in Olin Hall and the Centre Learning Commons in the Grace Doherty Library. Centre celebrated the opening of the new Gary Wright Baseball Field at Fishman Park in spring 2022.

Classes at Centre are held in spite of several federal holidays—including Presidents, Labor, Columbus, and Veterans Days—and rarely cancelled, which are points of pride among students, staff, and alumni. During the Confederate occupation of Old Centre in 1862, classes were held at Old Sayre library. However, the Battle of Perryville eventually forced the faculty to suspend classes for 13 days, the college&#x27;s only cancellation during the Civil War. Classes were cancelled one day due to the Great Blizzard of 1978. In 1994 and 1998, when severe snow and ice storms shut down much of the Commonwealth, classes were delayed by half a day. In 2000, classes were cancelled before the Vice Presidential Debate. In spring 2001, the entire campus was evacuated after a hazardous chemical spill on the train tracks at the end of Greek Row. On March 7, 2006, classes were cut short to allow students and staff to attend a symposium honoring retiring Dean John Ward. After a large snowstorm in 1997, Ward told the college community, &quot;Centre didn&#x27;t cancel classes during parts of the Civil War; we&#x27;re not cancelling them now.&quot; Classes were cancelled at Centre on March 3, 2014, due to weather. On March 15, 2020, in response to COVID-19 developments, President John Roush announced that classes would be temporarily suspended to implement an early, extended two-week Spring Break, followed by online learning for the rest of the term.

===2000 vice presidential debate===

On Thursday, October 5, 2000, Centre College hosted the vice presidential debate, becoming the smallest college in the smallest town ever to serve as a host site for a general election debate. Dubbed &quot;The Thrill in the Ville&quot;, the debate between Dick Cheney and Joe Lieberman took place in the college&#x27;s Norton Center for the Arts. The event was a tremendous success, being heralded by former CBS news anchor Dan Rather as &quot;the best vice presidential debate ever held.&quot; After the 2000 debate concluded, Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said that &quot;Centre has set the standard by which future debates will be judged.&quot;

===2012 vice presidential debate===

Twelve years after hosting its first debate, Centre College again hosted a vice presidential debate on October 11, 2012. The debate between vice presidential incumbent Joe Biden and Congressman Paul Ryan, with moderator Martha Raddatz, was called &quot;one of the most engaging, enlightening, and entertaining debates of recent memory, one marked by dramatic contrasts in priorities, ideology, and personal style.&quot; Of Centre College&#x27;s performance as a host site, Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said, &quot;They aced it in 2000 and this year was even better.&quot;

===2018 student protest and sit-in===
Over 200 Centre College students took part in a protest and sit-in at the campus administration building, Old Centre, on May 2, 2018. The students were protesting racial discrimination on campus. A group of black students drafted and presented a statement of intent and list of demands to the campus and school administration, demanding changes concerning the school&#x27;s Department of Public Safety, Title IX office, and the creation of a Diversity and Inclusion office, among other things. Over 400 students signed a petition supporting the movement. The protesters were present all day and night in Old Centre from May 2 to 4 while student leaders negotiated with President John Roush, sleeping in the building and in tents outside; they said they refused to leave until their demands were met. The sit-in ended on May 4, with school administration agreeing to many of the student demands.

==Campus==
Centre&#x27;s campus includes 67 buildings, 14 of which are included on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Old Centre===

Completed in 1820, Old Centre is the college&#x27;s first building, the oldest continuously operated academic building west of the Alleghenies, and the template for the Greek Revival style of the campus. Today it houses the offices of the president, vice president for academic affairs, and vice president for college relations, in addition to several classrooms and the college&#x27;s Admissions Welcome Centre. At various times it has served as a library, dormitory, law school, faculty residence, and, during the Civil War, a hospital for both Confederate and Union soldiers. Old Centre is a Kentucky Landmark, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and included in the &quot;Smithsonian Guide to Historic Places.&quot;

===Old Carnegie===
Built in 1913 with a $30,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie, Old Carnegie was the college library until 1966. It currently houses the Center for Career &amp; Professional Development and the Center for Global Citizenship, as well as the special-occasion Evans-Lively dining room. Old Carnegie is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

===Norton Center for the Arts===
 Norton Center for the Arts has hosted performers such as violinist Itzhak Perlman, dancers Mikhail Baryshnikov and Twyla Tharp, the Boston Pops, the New York Philharmonic, Henry Mancini, jazz vocalists Pearl Bailey and Sarah Vaughan, the Orchestre de Paris with Daniel Barenboim, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, Yo-Yo Ma, Beach Boys, Huey Lewis and the News, Willie Nelson, Travis Tritt, LeAnn Rimes, Lyle Lovett, Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, crooner Tony Bennett, The Chieftains, Three Dog Night, David Copperfield, Dolly Parton, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Ben Folds, They Might Be Giants, Ana Gasteyer, Kate Flannery, and musicals such as &quot;Rent, Cats, Titanic, Annie Get Your Gun, Thoroughly Modern Millie, Hairspray, My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot;&#x27; featuring Ruben Studdard. In October 2000, the Norton Center hosted the vice presidential debate between Dick Cheney and Senator Joe Lieberman. In September 2009, Centre garnered national attention by hosting the Vienna Philharmonic, marking the only stop on the Philharmonic&#x27;s American tour other than New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. In October 2012, the Norton Center hosted the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. Centre students can attend most of the Norton Center events at no extra cost.

The Norton Center for the Arts was built in 1973 and originally named the Regional Arts Center (RAC). The complex was designed by architect William Wesley Peters of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. It was later renamed for Jane Morton Norton, a former trustee of Centre College. The complex was refurbished in 2009.

===College Centre===
The College Centre is composed of two buildings, Crounse Hall and Sutcliffe Hall, both of which received multimillion-dollar expansions and renovations completed in the spring of 2005. Crounse Hall houses an enlarged library, theater, and additional classrooms; Sutcliffe Hall houses over of athletic space, including several new gymnasiums and workout facilities.

===Old Bookstore (Stuart Hall)===
The Old Bookstore was the first chapter house of any fraternity in Kentucky, housing the brothers of the Epsilon chapter of Beta Theta Pi. Before Centre obtained the property, the structure functioned as a funeral home and as a shoe store. The college later converted it to the Campus Bookstore. In 2005 the bookstore moved to its current downtown Danville location, leaving the building empty. In 2008, Centre rededicated the building as Stuart Hall, an upperclassmen residential facility, naming it in honor of John T. Stuart, of the class of 1826. The building now serves as the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.

===Craik House===
Built in 1853 and renovated in 1958, Craik House is the president&#x27;s home. Originally a private residence, Henry Craik bought the home in 1937 with a bequest in honor of his Centre Class of 1890. Robert L. McLeod, the 14th president of Centre, was the first president of the college to occupy the residence. The Craik House is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

===Breckinridge Hall===
Breckinridge Hall is a three-story residence hall that was originally built in 1892 as a dormitory for students of the Danville Theological Seminary. When the seminary consolidated with the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary in 1901, Centre took over Breckinridge as a residence hall for students.

===Pearl Hall===
Pearl Hall is the first LEED GOLD residential hall in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Pearl Hall was built with a gift from Centre trustee Robert Brockman, &#x27;63. The residence hall is named in memory of Brockman&#x27;s mother and grandmother, both of whom were named Pearl. Construction of the three-floor facility located on Main Street began in May 2007 after commencement and was finished in time for students to move into in August 2008. Dedication of the building took place during homecoming in October 2008. It houses 146 students.

===Roush Campus Center===
The Campus Center, a LEED Silver Certified multi-purpose facility, houses the Cowan Dining Commons, the Everyday Cafe, the Student Life Office, several meeting rooms, and a gaming area. The two-story, 50,000 square foot (4,650 m2), $15 million facility replaced the original Cowan Dining Commons in Fall 2009. In 2021, the building was renamed to the Roush Campus Center in honor of President John Roush, who had served the college from 1998 to 2020.

==Academics==
Centre offers a liberal arts education, requiring the completion of a general education curriculum and a major area of study. The college hosts active chapters of Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa, and has produced over 70% of Kentucky&#x27;s Rhodes Scholars in the last 50 years. Centre produces Fulbright, Goldwater, Rotary, and other major fellowship winners on a consistent basis, especially relative to the small size of its student body. From 2001 to 2011 the college produced 24 Fulbright winners, six Goldwater Scholars, 11 Rotary International Ambassadorial Scholars, three National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellows, an Udall Scholar, a Rhodes Scholar, and a Mitchell Scholar. Centre&#x27;s consistent four-year graduation rate of more than 80 percent is in the top 50 nationally and the highest of any Kentucky college or university.

Admission to Centre is competitive. For the class of 2018, incoming first-years had a midrange ACT score of 26–31, with an average ACT score of 29. Fifty-four percent of incoming students ranked in the top 10 percent of their high school graduating class.

Classes operate on a 4-1-4 schedule. Students take four courses each during the fall and spring semesters and one course during CentreTerm, which is a three-week period of intensive study during January. CentreTerm offers students an opportunity to study abroad, pursue an internship, or take unique, atypical courses. For instance, &quot;The Art of Walking&quot;, a course involving the exploration of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; while hiking through the Central Kentucky landscape, has garnered national attention as a signature class at Centre.

===Degrees offered===
In addition to 29 majors and 38 minors, Centre offers double majors, which about 25% of graduates complete, self-designed majors, and dual-degree engineering programs with Columbia University, University of Kentucky, Vanderbilt University, and Washington University in St. Louis. Centre is one of only a few colleges to offer a glassblowing program through its art department.

===Study abroad===
About 80 percent of all students study abroad or away at least once before graduating, making off-campus study a hallmark of a Centre education. As part of its effort to promote global citizenship, Centre Students can apply their Centre College institutional aid (scholarships, grants, loans) to approved semester-long study abroad/away programs; as a result, they pay the same charges (tuition, room, board, and fees) that they would typically pay to study at Centre. Centre also has limited funding to help offset the cost of applying for a first passport for students from any year who have been accepted to a Centre-approved study abroad program and have demonstrated high/unmet financial need.

Supplementing the semester programs, Centre offers a wide variety of study abroad and away options during the three-week Centre Term held in January. These options change every year based on faculty interest.

=== Rankings and outcomes ===
The 2025 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Centre tied for No. 59 among national liberal arts colleges. U.S. news also ranked the College No. 19 for Best Value and tied for No. 22 for Study Abroad.

In 2019, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Centre 209th in the nation among all colleges and universities and 41st among all colleges and universities in the South. According to College Scorecard, Centre graduates earn a median salary of $60,447 ten years after their entry into the institution. 75% of Centre graduates earn higher than a typical high school graduate of the corresponding area.

In his book Colleges That Change Lives, Loren Pope says, &quot;No university faculty compares with Centre&#x27;s in the impact it has on the growth of young minds and personalities. Its faculty is earnestly committed to and excels at the art of teaching.&quot;

==Student life==
About 96 percent of Centre&#x27;s students live on campus and participate in athletics, academic organizations, student government, and volunteer work. There are about 100 clubs, societies, teams and other formal and informal groups and more than 2,000 campus events each year. In 2016 the ethnic diversity of the student body was 3.3% Asian or Asian American, 4.6% Black or African American, 2.3% Hispanic or Latino, 3% Two or more races, and 80% White.

=== Fraternities and sororities ===

===Student government===
The Student Government Association of Centre College (SGA) represents Centre students as their voice on academic, extracurricular, and social issues. SGA consists of an Executive Council of officers and committee chairs, a Student Senate that handles academic issues, and a House of Representatives that oversees all clubs and organizations on campus. Each class elects representatives, who serve on committees that deal with specific aspects of campus and who approve all club funding, establishment of new student organizations, and other pieces of legislation that impact campus life. Centre also has a Student Judiciary that hears cases that are referred to it by the Dean&#x27;s Office or brought voluntarily by students themselves. Students who have been accused of a violation of academic or social policy have a right to have their case heard by a jury of their peers.

===Traditions===
====Running the Flame====
In 1969, Centre celebrated the college&#x27;s sesquicentennial year by dedicating and installing, at the center of campus, the Flame—a large sculpture that symbolically represents the torch of knowledge that appears on Centre&#x27;s official seal. A plaque at the base of the statue quotes Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe: &quot;Where the light is brightest, the shadows are deepest.&quot; The statue quickly became an ode to the liberation of the body as well as the mind. By the early 1970s, students began spontaneously running naked to and from dorms and Greek houses while passing the Flame. &quot;Running the Flame&quot; is now enshrined as a tradition that some Centre students complete prior to graduation.

====Kissing on the Seal====
College tradition holds that two students will marry at some point following graduation if, at the stroke of midnight, they kiss over the brass college seal embedded in the walkway in front of Old Centre.

====Dead Fred====
A portrait of Fred M. Vinson (1909, 1911 Law), former Chief Justice of the United States, hangs in the hallway of the chapter house of the Kentucky Alpha-Delta chapter of Phi Delta Theta. Vinson was a member of the chapter and a three-sport athlete in baseball, basketball, and football while studying at Centre. Members of the chapter take the portrait, affectionately known as Dead Fred, to the sidelines of Centre football and basketball games and to other significant college events. The portrait has not missed a football home game since Vinson&#x27;s death in 1953. When Centre hosted the 2000 and 2012 vice presidential debates, Dead Fred was granted a special seat overlooking the proceedings.

==== Lucky Lincoln ====
Students place pennies on the foot of Centre&#x27;s Abraham Lincoln statue for good luck before exams or other important events. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lincoln could be spotted wearing a mask.

====Body spelling====
When on trips away from campus, including studying abroad, groups of Centre students seek out photo opportunities in which they use their bodies to spell &quot;CENTRE&quot; in unique locations. In 2019, the University of Glasgow, one of Centre&#x27;s overseas study partners, highlighted this tradition in the newsletter of its U.S. study program.

==Athletics==
The Centre athletic teams are called the Colonels. The college is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Southern Athletic Association (SAA) since the 2012–13 academic year. The Colonels previously competed in the D-III Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC) from 1962–63 to 2011–12; in the Kentucky Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (KIAC; now currently known as the River States Conference (RSC) since the 2016–17 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1916–17 to 1961–62; and in the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) from 1910–11 to 1940–41.

Centre competes in 25 intercollegiate varsity sports: men&#x27;s teams in baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field. Intercollegiate women&#x27;s teams include basketball, cross country, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and Esports. 40 percent of the student body participates in intercollegiate athletics. Centre offers fifteen intramural sports, in which 80 percent of the student body participates.

===Football===

Competing since 1880, the Centre Colonels football team, also historically known as the &quot;Praying Colonels&quot;, ranked as the 12th winningest program in NCAA Division III history with a 509–374–37 all-time record as of 2008. On January 1, 1921, the Colonels defeated Texas Christian University 63–7 in the Fort Worth Classic, a postseason college football bowl game in Fort Worth, Texas played only once. On January 2, 1922, Centre College made the postseason trip to Texas again, this time taking on Texas A&amp;M in the Dixie Classic, the forerunner of the Cotton Bowl. Even though the Colonels were outscored 22–14, they played their part in the birth of one of college football&#x27;s greatest traditions, the 12th man.

At the beginning of the Roaring &#x27;20s, Harvard University, the nation&#x27;s dominant football power, was riding a two-year undefeated streak whose last loss had been to Brown in 1918. Then the Crimson invited Centre (enrollment at that time: 264) to Cambridge for what they thought would be a &quot;warm-up&quot; game, a light workout before facing Princeton the following week.

In the 1921 Centre vs. Harvard football game, the Colonels (under coach Charley Moran) shocked Harvard University and became the first school from outside the East to ever beat one of the Ivy League&#x27;s &quot;Big Three&quot; of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Star player Bo McMillin rushed for the lone touchdown of the game early in the third quarter, and the Praying Colonels&#x27; defense held off the Crimson&#x27;s powerful offense from there for a 6–0 victory, a feat that &quot;The New York Times&quot; later dubbed &quot;Football&#x27;s Upset of the Century&quot;. The Centre College official website claims the 1921 national championship, apparently on this basis. 29 years later, in 1950, the Associated Press chose the Centre win as the greatest sports upset of the first half of the 20th century. ESPN described Centre&#x27;s victory as one of the biggest upsets in all sports during the twentieth century.

On four consecutive Saturdays in 1924, the Colonels defeated Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia.

The Colonels have played home games at Farris Stadium since 1923.

===Basketball===
The Centre Colonels basketball team used to have a heated rivalry with Kentucky, and beat the Wildcats 87–17 in 1910.

==Notable alumni==
Centre alumni include two U.S. Vice Presidents, one Chief Justice of the United States, one Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, 13 U.S. Senators, 43 U.S. Representatives, 10 moderators of the General Assemblies of the Presbyterian Church, and 11 governors. Referring to Centre, President Woodrow Wilson gave an annual speech to Princeton alumni in 1903 in which he stated: &quot;There is a little college down in Kentucky which in sixty years has graduated more men who have acquired prominence and fame than has Princeton in her 150 years.&quot;

<doc id="1067914" wikidata="Q2994920" url="?curid=1067914" title="Lévy's constant">
<text>In mathematics Lévy&#x27;s constant (sometimes known as the Khinchin–Lévy constant) occurs in an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the denominators of the convergents of simple continued fractions.
In 1935, the Soviet mathematician Aleksandr Khinchin showed that the denominators &quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot; of the convergents of the continued fraction expansions of almost all real numbers satisfy 
:formula_1
Soon afterward, in 1936, the French mathematician Paul Lévy found the explicit expression for the constant, namely
:formula_2 

The term &quot;Lévy&#x27;s constant&quot; is sometimes used to refer to formula_3 (the logarithm of the above expression), which is approximately equal to 1.1865691104… The value derives from the asymptotic expectation of the logarithm of the ratio of successive denominators, using the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution. In particular, the ratio has the asymptotic density function

formula_4

for formula_5 and zero otherwise. This gives Lévy&#x27;s constant as

formula_6.

The base-10 logarithm of Lévy&#x27;s constant, which is approximately 0.51532041…, is half of the reciprocal of the limit in Lochs&#x27; theorem.

== Proof ==

The proof assumes basic properties of continued fractions.

Let formula_7 be the Gauss map. 

=== Lemma ===
formula_8where formula_9 is the Fibonacci number.

Proof. Define the function formula_10. The quantity to estimate is then formula_11.

By the mean value theorem, for any formula_12,formula_13The denominator sequence formula_14 satisfies a recurrence relation, and so it is at least as large as the Fibonacci sequence formula_15.
=== Ergodic argument ===

Since formula_16, and formula_17, we haveformula_18By the lemma,
formula_19

where formula_20 is finite, and is called the reciprocal Fibonacci constant.

By Birkhoff&#x27;s ergodic theorem, the limit formula_21 converges toformula_22 almost surely, where formula_23 is the Gauss distribution.

<doc id="1067915" wikidata="Q267042" url="?curid=1067915" title="Escape from Atlantis">
<text>Escape from Atlantis is a board game that portrays the sinking of Atlantis and the attempts by the population to escape the sinking island. It was originally released in the United States under the title of Survive! and first published in the English language by Parker Brothers in 1982. The game was invented by Julian Courtland-Smith. Early copies of &quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; include the name of the then co-copyright owner, C. Courtland-Smith.

In 1986, Waddingtons launched their three-dimensional version &quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; in the UK with revised rules. Waddingtons also sold a bilingual (English/French) version of &quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; in Canada. The game was sublicensed in 1987 and sold worldwide in a number of different languages. A 1996 Hasbro version of the game was released in 1996 in Europe under the Waddington&#x27;s brand. This version of the game revised the rules from the original version. World sales of &quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; exceed 1.25 million units.

American publisher Stronghold Games reprinted a new version of the game under the title &quot;Survive: Escape from Atlantis!&quot; in February 2011. In June 2012, Stronghold Games launched another new edition, &quot;Survive: Escape From Atlantis! - 30th Anniversary Edition&quot;. It included refreshed artwork and a slightly revised theme (Explorers finding and escaping from Atlantis). Simultaneously, French publisher, Asmodee, licensed the EU languages and launched &quot;The Island&quot;, which is the same game as Stronghold&#x27;s version, but with a rebranded name for EU trademark purposely only. In 2012 &quot;The Island&quot; (Survive: Escape from Atlantis) was a &#x27;2012 Juego del Ano Finalist&#x27;. In 2013, Stronghold Games launched a &#x27;5-6 Player Mini Expansion Kit&#x27; plus &#x27;Dolphins &amp; Dive Dice Expansion Kit&#x27; and &#x27;The Giant Squid Expansion Kit&#x27; for &quot;Survive: Escape from Atlantis! - 30th Anniversary Edition&quot;. All three expansion kits can also be played with Asmodee&#x27;s &quot;The Island&quot;.

==Contents==

===Board===
The centre of the game&#x27;s board, representing the mountainous island of Atlantis itself, is covered with several tiers of molded hexagon tiles (37 in total) giving the game a partly three-dimensional appearance. The island is made up of four different &quot;rings&quot;, with a mountain peak at the centre, a ring of mountains around it, a ring of forest around that, and finally a ring of sandy beach at the outer edge. Each of the tiles has space to hold a maximum of 3 Atlanteans.

The island is surrounded by open water, and in each of the four corners of the board are four coral islands.

As play progresses the land tiles are incrementally removed, simulating the ongoing sinking of the island. The objective of the game is for players to save their ten Atlanteans from the sinking island by transporting them to the safety of the coral islands.

===Game pieces===

&quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; includes four Atlantean tribes, each with twelve villagers. These are represented as small wooden figures, coloured red, blue, green and yellow. Each player picks one tribe. Also included are boats and various sea animals: sharks, giant squid, sea serpents and dolphins. Some versions of &quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; use dice. Waddington&#x27;s version uses a special spinner device.

==Rules==
===Game start===
At the start of the game, the island tiles are shuffled, and the island of Atlantis is built at the centre of the game board. Each player sets his/her tribe up on the island, in places of his/her own choosing. The only limitation is that sandy beach tiles can start with only one villager per tile. Some of the boats are placed in the sea adjacent to the island of Atlantis. In a two-player game, there are two boats. In a three- or four-player game, there are four.

===Game rounds===
On his/her turn, each player does three things, in this order:

* Moves his/her villagers,
* Sinks one tile from the island of Atlantis,
* Spins the spinner (or rolls the die) and moves the sea animals accordingly.

====Movement phase====
Movement is by the villagers walking on land, swimming (slowly) in the ocean, or being transported by boat or on the backs of helpful dolphins.

The player has a fixed number of three spaces of movement on each turn. This can be freely distributed among the villagers, for example by moving one villager three spaces, or moving three villagers one space each. When swimming, a villager may only move one space per turn, but there are no such restrictions for other methods of movement.

When travelling by boat, the player can also move a boat with villagers from other tribes on it, provided the player&#x27;s tribe holds a non-minority position (in other words, no other tribe has more members in the same boat). This creates a tactical element by allowing players to transport other players&#x27; villagers.

====Sinking phase====
On each turn, an island tile is removed from the island. The removal starts from the sandy beach on the outer edge, and continues further inland as outer rings are exhausted. A tile with villagers on it may only be sunk if no empty tiles are present in the currently sinking ring.

A villager falling into the water does not drown. He floats at the surface, capable of swimming one space per turn, or three when riding on the back of a dolphin. Dolphins can only transport one villager at a time.

The villagers&#x27; journeys are endangered variously by sea serpents, giant squid, sharks, and by whirlpools caused by the sinking land itself, and aided by dolphins and boats. A symbol on the bottom of the removed tile tells which of these appears in the tile&#x27;s place.

Whirlpools destroy all moving objects (but not land) from the same space and adjacent spaces. The whirlpool is then discarded.

====Spinning phase====
In the spinning phase, the Atlantean Swirler spinner shows which kind of sea creatures should be moved, and how many blocks: one, two, three or five.

The player then freely selects one of the sea creatures in question from the board and moves it accordingly. He/she can decide its route for him/herself. This allows using sharks, octopus or sea monsters to attack other players, or dolphins to come to the rescue of the player&#x27;s own tribesmen.

When a sea animal comes to contact with villagers on the sea, what happens depends on the animal:
* Sharks kill villagers swimming in the water. They do not harm boats or their passengers.
* Whales destroy boats. Any passengers in the boat survive, but are dropped in the water.
* Sea Monsters both destroy boats and kill villagers.
* Dolphins allow villagers to ride them, giving them a maximum of three blocks of movement instead of one. They do not protect villagers from sharks or sea monsters.

A diving sea creature can appear at any sea hexagon that does not have villagers or boats in it.

===Winning the game===
The game ends when all villagers either have safely arrived on the coral islands, or are dead, or if the volcano tile is flipped over.

The winner is the player who, at the end of game, has succeeded in saving the most of their own villagers.

==Rule variations==
In the original version, &quot;Survive!&quot;, the land pieces are randomly placed in the sinking island area at the start of the game. This results in the island sinking in a less-uniform fashion than the current &quot;Escape from Atlantis&quot; game. This, paired with other changes, provides significantly different gameplay.

The &quot;Survive!&quot; game board uses a slightly different board design. The most marked difference is that each corner island has two entrance hexes rather than one. &quot;Survive!&quot; also has a gameplay feature whereby some games end earlier than others. Under one of the rock tiles (i.e., the last tiles to sink), there is a graphic of an explosion which signifies that the volcanic island has erupted, ending the game and killing any villagers who have not yet escaped. Because the end of the game depended on when this tile is revealed, players were not able to rely on having a pre-determined number of turns remaining.

In terms of villagers, each of a player&#x27;s 10 pieces have a hidden numeric digit from 1 to 6 located on the bottom. This value represents the point value earned for rescuing the given villager. Once placed on the board, players are no longer able to reference which villager token has which number, even if the piece leaves play. As a result, it can become difficult to remember where the most valuable villagers are located, and furthermore, the values of other players pieces are never known. Strategy dictates that the most valuable villagers are often the ones leaving the island first (on boats), so they are typically the most valuable to go after with sea monsters. At the end of a game, the player with the highest surviving point total wins.

Rather than a spinner device, a custom 6-sided die is used to control the sea animals. Also, whales replace the giant squid counters, and there are no dolphins.

<doc id="1067919" wikidata="Q4591858" url="?curid=1067919" title="Adirondack (Mars)">
<text>Adirondack is the nickname for Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Spirit&quot;&#x27;s first target rock. Scientists chose Adirondack to be &quot;Spirit&quot;″s first target rock after considering another, called Sashimi, that would have been a shorter, straight-ahead drive. &quot;Spirit&quot; traversed the sandy martian terrain at Gusev Crater to arrive in front of this football-sized rock on January 18, 2004, just three days after it successfully rolled off the lander.

Scientists named the angular rock after the Adirondack mountain range in New York.
The rock was selected as &quot;Spirit&quot;″s first target because its dust-free, flat surface was ideally suited for grinding. Clean surfaces also are better for examining a rock&#x27;s top coating. &quot;Spirit&quot; also returned microscopic images and Mössbauer spectrometer readings of Adirondack taken the day before the rover developed computer and communication problems on January 22, 2004. Both are unprecedented investigations of any rock on another planet. The microscopic images indicate Adirondack is a hard, crystalline rock. The peaks large and small in Adirondack&#x27;s electromagnetic spectrum reveal that the minerals in the rock include olivine, pyroxene and magnetite - a common composition in volcanic basalt rocks on Earth.

Adirondack turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains. &quot;Spirit&quot; rover&#x27;s instruments determined that Adironack and other rocks of the plains contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites which came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephrite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.
Adirondack has been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. Small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes.
Coatings on the rocks in the plains may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust.
One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth.

<text>The Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee was a coalition of organizations which coordinated events opposing the Vietnam War in the mid-1960s. It coordinated its constituent groups to stage anti-war parades, rallies, and &quot;peace-ins&quot; primarily in New York City. Named after Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, it was based on 17th Street near Union Square. At the start of 1968, it included about 150 groups. A rally and march it organized with the Spring Mobilization against the War in Vietnam in 1967 featured Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael, Benjamin Spock, and Dave Dellinger in Central Park.

Leader Norma Becker was a member of the established War Resisters League.
Chairman David Dellinger later became known as one of the Chicago Eight.

<text>A prebendary is a member of the Catholic or Anglican clergy, a form of canon with a role in the administration of a cathedral or collegiate church. When attending services, prebendaries sit in particular seats, usually at the back of the choir stalls, known as prebendal stalls.

==History==
At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, the canons and dignitaries of the cathedrals of England were supported by the produce and other profits from the cathedral estates. In the early 12th century, the endowed prebend was developed as an institution, in possession of which a cathedral official had a fixed and independent income. This made the cathedral canons independent of the bishop, and created posts that attracted the younger sons of the nobility. Part of the endowment was retained in a common fund, known in Latin as &quot;communia&quot;, which was used to provide bread and money to a canon in residence in addition to the income from his prebend. 

Most prebends disappeared in 1547, when nearly all collegiate churches in England and Wales were dissolved by the &quot;Act for the Dissolution of Collegiate Churches and Chantries&quot; of that year, as part of the Reformation. The church of St Endellion, Cornwall, is one of the few still extant.

The office of prebendary is retained by certain Church of England dioceses (those of Lichfield, Lincoln, and London being significant examples) as an honorary title for senior parish priests, usually awarded in recognition of long and dedicated service to the diocese. These priests are entitled to be called &quot;Prebendary&quot; (usually shortened to Preb.) and have a role in the administration of the relevant cathedral. Prebendaries have a prebendal stall in certain cathedrals and collegiate churches.

The greater chapter of a cathedral includes both the residentiary canons (full-time senior cathedral clergy) and the prebendaries (and, in London, the Minor Canons). In the Church of England, when a diocesan bishop retires, moves to another diocese or dies, the monarch will summon the greater chapter to elect a successor. This election is ceremonial, as the monarch (following the advice of the prime minister) tells the members of the greater chapter whom they are to elect.

Wells Cathedral and Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin still call their canons &quot;prebendaries&quot;. They form the chapter of the cathedral and sit in their prebendal stalls when in residence in the cathedral.

==Prebend==
The &quot;prebend&quot; is the form of benefice held by a prebendary; historically, the stipend attached to it was usually drawn from specific sources in the income of a cathedral&#x27;s estates. In the 21st century, many remaining prebendaries hold an honorary position which does not carry an income with it.

<text>The Majorelle Garden (, , ) is a botanical garden and artist&#x27;s landscape garden in Marrakesh, Morocco. It was created by the French Orientalist artist Jacques Majorelle over almost forty years, starting in 1923, and features a Cubist villa designed by French architect Paul Sinoir in the 1930s. The property was the residence of the artist and his wife from 1923 until their divorce in the 1950s.

In the 1980s, the property was purchased by the fashion designer Yves Saint-Laurent and his business manager Pierre Bergé who worked to restore it. Today, the garden and villa complex is open to the public. The villa houses the Berber Museum and in 2017 the Yves Saint Laurent Museum opened nearby.

==History==

The Majorelle Garden was designed by the French artist, Jacques Majorelle (1886–1962), son of the Art Nouveau &quot;ébéniste&quot; (cabinet-maker) of Nancy, Louis Majorelle. As a young aspiring painter, Jacques Majorelle was sent to Morocco in around 1917 to convalesce from a serious medical condition. After spending a short time in Casablanca, he travelled to Marrakech and like many of his contemporaries, fell in love with the vibrant colours and street life he found there. After travelling around North Africa and the Mediterranean, he eventually decided to settle permanently in Marrakech.

During his lifetime, Majorelle earned a reputation as a celebrated Orientalist painter. The special shade of bold cobalt blue, inspired by the coloured tiles he had seen around Marrakech and in Berber burnouses, was used extensively in the garden and its buildings and is named after him, &quot;bleu Majorelle&quot;—Majorelle Blue. Prior to his death, Majorelle patented the colour which carries his name.

In 1923, just four years after his marriage to Andrée Longueville, Majorelle purchased a four-acre plot, situated on the border of a palm grove in Marrakech and built a house in the Mooroccan style. In 1931, he commissioned the architect, Paul Sinoir, to design a Cubist villa for the property. Gradually, he purchased additional land, extending his holding by some 10 acres. In the grounds around the residence, Majorelle began planting a luxuriant garden which would become known as the &quot;Jardins Majorelle&quot; (Majorelle Garden). The garden became his life&#x27;s work and he devoted himself to developing it for almost forty years.

The garden proved costly to run and in 1947, Majorelle opened the garden to the public with an admission fee designed to defray the cost of maintenance. At times, he sold off parcels of land to fund the growing garden. Following his divorce in the 1950s, Majorelle was forced to sell the house and land. After this, the garden was neglected and fell into disrepair. The garden and villa were rediscovered in the 1980s, by fashion designers, Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé who set about restoring it and saving it. The pair owned the villa until 2008. After Yves Saint Laurent died in 2008 his ashes were scattered in the Majorelle Garden.

Since 2010, the property has been owned by the Foundation Pierre Bergé – Yves Saint Laurent, a French not-for-profit organisation and since 2011 has been managed by the Foundation Jardin Majorelle, a recognized non-profit organization in Marrakech. Pierre Bergé was the director of the Garden&#x27;s Foundation until his death in September, 2017.

==Gardens and museums==
The gardens and buildings form a complex, where specific buildings are dedicated to various museums and exhibits of interest to visitors. The gardens, which cover two and half acres, are open to the public daily and house an important collection of cacti and sculptures.

Majorelle&#x27;s former studio workshop previously housed the Islamic Art Museum of Marrakech, featuring a collection of North African textiles from Saint-Laurent&#x27;s personal collection as well as ceramics and jewelry. Since 2011, however, the villa is now home to the Berber Museum (), exhibiting objects of Amazigh (Berber) culture. The villa also holds a collection of Majorelle&#x27;s paintings.

Development of the garden complex is ongoing. Profits from the gardens are used to fund new projects. In October 2017, the Yves Saint Laurent Museum was opened to the public as a tribute to the designer&#x27;s legacy and his links with Marrakech. The gardens are a major tourist drawcard in Marrakech, attracting more than 700,000 visitors annually. The garden hosts more than 15 bird species that are endemic to North Africa. It has many fountains, and a notable collection of cacti.

<doc id="1067948" wikidata="Q48624" url="?curid=1067948" title="Afanasy Nikitin">
<text>Afanasy Nikitin (; died 1475) was a Russian merchant from Tver and one of the first Europeans (after Niccolò de&#x27; Conti) to travel to and document his visit to India. He described his trip in a narrative known as &quot;A Journey Beyond the Three Seas&quot; ().

==The voyage==
Afanasy Nikitin, son of Nikita, was a merchant in Tver. Prior to his voyage to Persia and India, Afanasy Nikitin was probably engaged in long-distance trade and had previously traveled to the Ottoman Empire, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Moldavia, Wallachia, Georgia, Crimea, and other countries. In 1466 or 1468, Nikitin left his hometown of Tver on a commercial trip, planning to trade in the lands around the Caspian Sea and go as far as Shirvan (in modern-day Azerbaijan). He travelled down the Volga, stopping at the Makaryev Monastery, then passing through Uglich, Kostroma, and Plyos to get to Nizhny Novgorod. Following the caravan of the returning ambassador to Moscow from Shirvan, Hasan Beg, Nikitin and his fellow merchants traveled further south. Near Astrakhan, his party was attacked and robbed first by Nogais (whom he calls Tatars), then again by Kaitags on the Caspian coast. Niktin&#x27;s belongings were stolen, and some of his fellow Russian merchants were taken prisoner by the Kaitags. Nikitin went to the Shirvanshah&#x27;s (the ruler of Shirvan) camp in Shamakhi to plead for help. His captured companions were rescued by the Shirvanshah, who, however, refused to give him and his companions means to return home. At that point, Nikitin writes, his party dispersed: &quot;Whoever had something left in Rus&#x27; returned to Rus&#x27;; whoever had debts in Rus&#x27; went wherever they could&quot;.

Hoping to recoup his losses, Nikitin continued on to Derbent, which was a familiar market to him, and then to Baku. He then crossed the Caspian Sea into Persia, where he followed a known trade route and made prolonged stops in market towns. He passed through Chapakur (Chapak Rud, where he remained for six months), Sari, Amol, Kashan, and Yazd before reaching Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. All in all, he remained in Persia for two years. Having heard about the riches of India from Muslim merchants, he decided to travel there. In the spring of 1471, Nikitin sailed for India from Hormuz and, after making several stops, arrived in the port of Chaul six weeks later. It was probably after his arrival in India that he began writing his travel notes.

Nikitin observed the markets, lifestyles and courts of the Bahmani Sultanate and the Vijayanagara Empire. He visited the Hindu sanctuary of Parvattum, which he called &quot;the Jerusalem of the Hindus&quot;. He mentions that he engaged in horse-dealing, although his mercantile activities may have been more extensive than directly stated in his account. He spent almost three years in India, before deciding to return to Russia after concluding that further travel would not make him any great profit and that he could not afford to remain in India. Nikitin also showed a longing to return to his homeland: &quot;May God protect the Russian land! There is no land in the world like it. But why can the princes in the Russian land not live with each other as brothers? May the Russian land be well ordered, because justice there is quite rare&quot;.

On his way back, Nikitin visited Muscat, the Arabian sultanate of Somalia, and Trabzon. In November 1474, he sailed from Trebizond to Caffa (now Feodosia), where there was a large Russian settlement. It is most likely in Caffa that he composed on the basis of his travel notes and memories. On his way to Tver, Nikitin died not far from Smolensk in the spring of 1475. Other Russian merchants took his notes to Vasily Mamyrev, secretary to Ivan III, the grand prince of Moscow. The author of the &quot;Lvov Chronicle&quot; writes that he received Nikitin&#x27;s notes in 1475 and incorporated them into his work but was unable to learn anything more about the traveler.

During his trip, Nikitin studied the population of India, its social system, government, military (he witnessed war-games featuring war elephants), its economy, religion, lifestyles, and natural resources. He describes the appearances of Indians, their clothing and food, interrelations, and so on. Nikitin&#x27;s notes mention: &quot;the countrymen are very poor, but the boyars are rich and live in luxury&quot;. The abundance and trustworthiness of Nikitin&#x27;s factual material provide a valuable source of information about India at that time, and his remarks on the trade of Hormuz, Cambay, Calicut, Dabhol, Ceylon, Pegu and China; on royal progresses and other functions, both ecclesiastical and civil, at the Bahmani capital Bidar, and on the wonders of the great fair at Parvattumas well as his comparisons of things Russian and Indiandeserve special notice.

==Religion==
After studying Nikitin&#x27;s account, and especially his references to Islam (much of India was ruled by Muslim sultans, and many Muslim merchants lived along the coast), particularly the prayers he transliterates from Arabic and Turkic into Cyrillic letters, Gail Lenhoff and Janet Martin speculated that Nikitin might have converted to Islam in India.

His loss of contact with Christianity and his life among Muslims (and apparent lapse from Christianity and conversion to Islam) bothered him, as he mentioned several times in his account. Indeed, he began his account calling it his &quot;sinful voyage beyond three seas.&quot; He went on to explain that he continued to date events by Christian religious holidays and invoked the Mother of God and the saints (&quot;the Holy Fathers&quot;), he could not remember when Christian holidays were and so he could not celebrate Easter and other movable feast days or keep the Christian fasts (Lent, the St. Peters&#x27; Fast, the fast during Advent, etc.). Thus, he kept the fasts of the Muslims and broke fast when they did so. He also wrote that at Bindar in the third year of his journey he &quot;shed many tears for the Christian faith&quot;. Very near the end of his account, he wrote of his wish to return home and to the Christian faith: &quot;I, Afanasy, a damned servant of Almighty God, Maker of heaven and earth, pondered over the Christian faith, the Baptism of Christ, the fasts established by the Holy Fathers, and the apostolic commandments, and I longed to go [back] to Rus!&quot;.

Yakov Lurye, an editor of Nikitin&#x27;s &quot;Journey&quot;, sees his conversion as doubtful, pointing out that a circumcised convert would have been persecuted or even put to death in Rus&#x27;, so if Nikitin had indeed become a Muslim, he would have avoided returning to his country, while in fact he died on his way back in the territory of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania not far from the Muscovite border. However, Lurye characterizes Nikitin&#x27;s religious expressions as &quot;the peculiar syncretism of a man who acknowledged any monotheistic faith as &#x27;true&#x27;, if practiced with a pure heart&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Historiography===
Scholars became aware of Nikitin&#x27;s &quot;Voyage&quot; relatively early and prominent historians mentioned it in their works, such as Nikolay Karamzin (1766–1826) in his &quot;History of the Russian State&quot; (1817). The text of Nikitin&#x27;s &quot;Voyage&quot; in the &quot;Sofia Second Chronicle&quot; was published in its entirety for the first time in 1821. A German translation of Nikitin&#x27;s notes was also published in 1835 as &quot;Reise nach Indien unternommen von einem Russischen Kaufmann im 15 Jahrhundert&quot; in &quot;Dorpater Jahrbücher für Literatur&quot;. The Russian diplomat in London, Mikhail Vielgorsky, translated a version for the Hakluyt Society, which was published in 1855. Many historians have used Nikitin&#x27;s notes as a dependable source for the history of India in the 15th-century.

The dates of Nikitin&#x27;s travels have been debated by scholars; it was generally accepted until the 1980s that Nikitin spent the years 1466–1472 in India, when Leonid S. Semyonov challenged these dates and published a book dedicated to Nikitin&#x27;s travels in 1980. His chronology was accepted in the &quot;Literaturnye Pamiatniki&quot; series by the Russian Academy of Sciences. According to Semyonov&#x27;s reconstruction, Nikitin left Russia in 1468 and spent the years 1471–1474 in India.

===Tributes===

In 1955, the local authorities of Tver erected a bronze monument to Afanasy Nikitin on the bank of the Volga River. The sculptor was Sergei Orlov. There is a folk legend that this statue was raised because Nikita Khrushchev, upon visiting India, told Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that there was a statue of Nikitin in Russia when in fact there was not (Nehru had asked if the Russians had honored the first Russian to visit India). So as not to be proven a liar, Khrushchev phoned back to Russia demanding that a statue of Nikitin be built immediately, before Nehru&#x27;s state visit to Russia. The statue was featured on a Russian postage stamp in 2005 commemorating the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Tver Oblast.

Nikitin was also featured on a coin commemorating the 525th anniversary of his journey.

In 1958, the Russian state-owned Mosfilm Studio and Indian director Khwaja Ahmad Abbas&#x27; &quot;Naya Sansar International&quot; production house co-produced a film entitled &quot;The Journey Beyond Three Seas&quot; with Oleg Strizhenov cast as Nikitin.

The 1962-built icebreaker &quot;Ledokol-2&quot; was renamed &quot;Afanasy Nikitin&quot; in 1966.

In 2000, a black obelisk was erected in Nikitin&#x27;s honor at Revdanda, 120 km south of Mumbai, the probable location where he first set foot in India.

In 2006, the Indian organization Adventures &amp; Explorers, with the support of the Embassy of India in Moscow and the Tver Regional Administration sponsored a Nikitin Expedition, in which 14 travelers set out from Tver to retrace Nikitin&#x27;s journey through Russia, the Middle East, and Central Asia to India. The expedition lasted from 12 November 2006 to 16 January 2007. The Indian newspaper &quot;The Hindu&quot; filed several reports on the expedition&#x27;s progress. After reaching India, two members of the expedition set out in March 2007 from Mumbai in SUVs to retrace Nikitin&#x27;s travels around India itself.

The Afanasy Nikitin Seamount in the Indian Ocean is named in his honor.

On 17 April 2022, the Kozhikode Corporation paid tribute to Afanasy Nikitin, commemorating the 550th anniversary of his visit to Kozhikode. Moreover, Customs Road in the city was renamed after Nikitin, also establishing a ‘twin city’ status with Tver, the birth place of Nikitin.

===In popular culture===
The Russian rock band Aquarium composed a song titled &quot;Afanasy Nikitin Boogie&quot;. The power metal band Epidemia composed a song titled &quot; (Walking the three seas) about Nikitin&#x27;s writings. A brand of Tver beer, &quot;Afanasy&quot;, is named after Afanasy Nikitin.

<text>Jacques Majorelle (7 March 1886 – 14 October 1962), son of the celebrated Art Nouveau furniture designer Louis Majorelle, was a French painter. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts in Nancy in 1901 and later at the Académie Julian in Paris with Schommer and Royer. Majorelle became a noted Orientalist painter, but is most remembered for constructing the villa and gardens that now carry his name, the Majorelle Garden in Marrakech.

==Life and career==
Jacques Majorelle was born in 1886 in Nancy, France. He was the son of a celebrated furniture designer, Louis Majorelle. Jacques&#x27; childhood was spent among the draftsmen, cabinetmakers and marquetry inlayers from his father&#x27;s workshops at a time when the Art Nouveau movement was in its ascendancy. Initially, his father encouraged the young Jacques to study architecture, but after three years, he decided to take up his lifelong passion, painting.

Majorelle received his art education at the École des Beaux-Arts in Nancy in 1901 and later at the Académie Julian in Paris with Schommer and Royer. He first exhibited at the Salon de Beaux Artes in 1908. In around 1917 he travelled to Morocco to recover from heart problems and after short period spent in Casablanca, he visited Marrakech, where he fell in love with the vibrant colours and quality of light he found there. Initially, he used Marrakech as a base for trips to Spain, Italy and other parts of North Africa, including Egypt. Eventually, however, he settled in Marrakech permanently.

He drew inspiration for his paintings from his trips and from Marrakesh itself. His paintings include many street scenes, souks and kasbahs as well as portraits of local inhabitants. He opened a handicrafts workshop in Marrakech and also designed posters to promote travel to Morocco. His work was profoundly affected by his voyage to Morocco and Marrakesh. He introduced a more coloured vision, bathed in light where the drawing disappears and the image emerges from large spots of colour laid flat. It seemed as if he had discovered the sun in these countries. His style exhibited more freedom and spontaneity.

In 1919, he married Andrée Longueville and the pair lived in an apartment near the Jemâa el-Fna Square (then at the palace of Pasha Ben Daoud). In 1923, Jacques Majorelle bought a four-acre plot, situated on the border of a palm grove in Marrakech and began planting a luxuriant garden which would become known as the &quot;Jardins Majorelle&quot; or Majorelle Garden. Initially, he built a house in the Mooroccan style but in 1931, he commissioned the architect, Paul Sinoir, to design a Cubist villa within the grounds. In 1937, he painted the villa in a special shade of the blue, which Majorelle had developed after being inspired by the blue tiles prevalent in southern Morocco. This colour was used extensively in Majorelle&#x27;s house and garden, and now carries his name; Majorelle Blue. He gradually purchased additional land, extending his holding by almost 10 acres. He continued to work on the garden for almost forty years and it is said to be his finest work.

The garden proved costly to run and in 1947, Majorelle opened the garden to the public with an admission fee designed to defray the cost of maintenance. He sold the house and land in the 1950s, after which it fell into disrepair. It was rediscovered in the 1980s, by designers, Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé who set about restoring it and saving it. Yves Saint-Laurent and Pierre Bergé, who were keen art collectors, also began acquiring paintings by Majorelle. Yves Saint Laurent died in 2008 and his ashes were scattered in the gardens.

Majorelle was sent to France for medical treatment in 1962 following a car accident, and died in Paris, later that year of complications from his injuries. He is buried in Nancy, the place of his birth, alongside his father.

==Legacy==
His life and work have been subject of a book, namely:
* Marcilhac, F., &quot;La Vie et l&#x27;oeuvre de Jacques Majorelle&quot;, [volume 7 in the series, &quot;Les Orientalistes&quot;], Paris, ACR edition, 1988

==Work==

Majorelle is recognised as one of the early modernist Orientalists. During his lifetime, many of Majorelle&#x27;s paintings were sold to private buyers and remain in private collections. Some of his early works can be found in Museums around his birthplace such as the Musee de l&#x27;Ecole de Nancy. Examples of his later work can be seen in the Mamounia Hotel, Marrakesh, the French Consulate of Marrakech and in the Villa at the Majorelle Gardens.

<text>In Christianity, a collegiate church is a church where the daily office of worship is maintained by a college of canons, a non-monastic or &quot;secular&quot; community of clergy, organised as a self-governing corporate body, headed by a dignitary bearing a title which may vary, such as dean or provost.

In its governance and religious observance, a collegiate church is similar in some respects to a cathedral, but a collegiate church is not the seat of a bishop and has no diocesan responsibilities.

Collegiate churches have often been supported by endowments, including lands, or by tithe income from appropriated benefices.

The church building commonly provides both distinct spaces for congregational worship and for the choir offices of the canons.

== History ==
In the early medieval period, before the development of the parish system in Western Christianity, many new church foundations were staffed by groups of secular priests, living a communal life and serving an extensive territory. In England these churches were termed minsters, from the Latin &quot;monasterium&quot;, although only a few were truly houses of monks. In the 9th and 10th centuries many such churches adopted formal rules of governance, commonly derived from those composed by Chrodegang of Metz for Metz cathedral, and thenceforth came to be described as &quot;collegiate&quot;; and there were also new foundations of this type.

Originally, the endowments of these foundations were held in a common treasury from which each canon received a proportion for their subsistence, such canons being termed portioners; but from the 11th century onwards, the richer collegiate churches tended to be provided with new statutes establishing the priests of the college as canons within a formal chapter such that each canon was supported by a separate endowment, or prebend; such canons being termed prebendaries. A few major collegiate bodies remained portionary – such as Beverley Minster and the cathedral chapters of Utrecht and Exeter – but in less affluent foundations, the pooled endowments of the community continued to be apportioned between the canons. Both prebendaries and portioners tended in this period to abandon communal living, each canon establishing his own house within the precinct of the church. In response to which, and generally on account of widespread concern that the religious life of collegiate communities might be insufficiently rigorous, many collegiate foundations in the 12th century adopted the Augustinian rule, and become fully monastic, as for example at Dorchester Abbey and Christchurch Priory.

Because each prebend or portion provided a discrete source of income as a separate benefice, in the later medieval period canons increasingly tended to be non-resident, paying a vicar to undertake divine service in their place. Kings and bishops came to regard prebends as useful sources of income for favoured servants and supporters, and it was not uncommon for a bishop or archbishop also to hold half a dozen or more collegiate prebends or deaneries.

From the 13th century onwards, existing collegiate foundations (like monasteries) also attracted chantry endowments, usually a legacy in a will providing for masses to be sung for the repose of the souls of the testator and their families by the collegiate clergy or their vicars. The same impetus to establish endowed prayer also led to many new collegiate foundations in this later period; under which an existing parish church would be rebuilt to accommodate a new chantry college; commonly with the intention that the rectory of the parish should be appropriated to support the new foundation. A new organisational structure was developed for these bodies, by which endowment income was held collectively, and each canon received a fixed stipend conditional on being personally resident, such canons being termed fellows, or chaplains led by a warden or master. In this arrangement, only the office of warden constituted a separate benefice; appointment to the individual canonries being at the discretion of the chapter. Chantry colleges still maintained the daily divine office with the additional prime function of offering masses in intercession for departed members of the founder&#x27;s family; but also typically served charitable or educational purposes, such as providing hospitals or schools. For founders, this presented the added advantage that masses for the repose of themselves and their families endowed in a chantry would be supported by a guaranteed congregation of grateful and virtuous recipients of charity, which conferred a perceived advantage in endowing such a chantry in a parish church over doing so in a monastery. Consequently, in the later medieval period, testators consistently tended to favour chantries linked to parochial charitable endowments.

One particular development of the chantry college principle was the establishment in university cities of collegiate foundations in which the fellows were graduate academics and university teachers. Local parish churches were appropriated to these foundations, thereby initially acquiring collegiate status. However, this form of college developed radically in the later Middle Ages after the pattern of New College, Oxford, where for the first time college residence was extended to include undergraduate students. Thereafter, university collegiate bodies developed into a distinct type of religious establishment whose regular worship took place in dedicated college chapels rather than in collegiate churches; and in this form they survived the Reformation in England in the universities of Oxford and Cambridge; as also did the associated collegiate schools and chapels of Eton College and Winchester College.

In a collegiate church or chapel, as in a cathedral, the canons or fellows are typically seated separately from any provision for a lay congregation, in quire stalls parallel with the south and north walls facing inwards, rather than towards the altar at the eastern end. This has influenced the design of other churches in that the singing choir is seen as representing the idea of a college. The Westminster model of parliamentary seating arrangement arose from Parliament&#x27;s use of the collegiate St Stephen&#x27;s Chapel Westminster for its sittings, until Westminster Palace burned down in 1834.

== Contemporary examples ==

Three traditional collegiate churches have survived in England since the Middle Ages: at Westminster Abbey in London, St George&#x27;s Chapel of Windsor Castle and Church of St Endelienta, St Endellion, Cornwall.

The idea of a &quot;collegiate church&quot; has continued to develop a contemporary equivalent.

Examples of contemporary collegiate churches in America today are The Collegiate Church of New York City. These include the Marble Collegiate Church, founded in 1628, and the Middle Collegiate, Fort Washington Collegiate and West End Collegiate churches, affiliated with the Reformed Church in America.

In the Catholic Church, most cathedrals possess a cathedral chapter and are thus collegiate churches. The number of collegiate chapters &quot;other&quot; than those of cathedrals has been greatly reduced compared to times past. Three of them are in Rome: the two papal basilicas (other than the Lateran as cathedral and St. Paul&#x27;s as a monastery) of St. Peter and St. Mary Major, together with the Basilica St. Maria ad Martyres. Elsewhere, three can be found in Germany, to wit, St. Martin&#x27;s Church, Landshut (chapter of Sts. Martin and Kastulus), the Church of Sts. Philipp and James in Altötting (chapter of St. Rupert) and &quot;St. Remigius&quot; in Borken. In Portugal the one example (abolished in 1869, restored in 1891 abolished again in 1910 and restored in 1967 – minus its Royal prerogative, the monarchy itself having been abolished in the intervening period) that survives is that of the ancient&quot; Real Colegiada&quot; of Nossa Senhora da Oliveira in Guimarães. One collegiate church can be found in the Czech Republic: Sts. Peter and Paul Basilica in Prague-Vyšehrad.

===England===

In pre-Reformation England there were usually a number of collegiate churches in each diocese, with over a hundred in total. They were mostly abolished during the reign of Edward VI in 1547, as part of the Reformation, by the Act for the Dissolution of Collegiate Churches and Chantries. Almost all continue to serve as parish churches with a resident rector, vicar or curate (although the appointment of a vicar in succession to the priestly services of the Augustinian priory at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Bedford predates this by nineteen years). Two major collegiate churches, however, Manchester and Southwell, were refounded with a collegiate body after the Reformation; and these were joined by the revived college at Ripon in 1604, all three churches maintaining choral foundations for daily worship. These three churches became cathedrals in the 19th century. Hence, at the beginning the 20th century, the royal peculiars of Westminster and Windsor alone survived with a functioning non-cathedral and non-academic collegiate body.

The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge universities, and the schools of Eton and Winchester, successfully resisted dissolution at the Reformation, arguing that their chantry origins had effectively been subsumed within their continuing academic and religious functions; and pleading that they be permitted simply to cease maintaining their chantries and obituaries. For the most part, they had already ceased to undertake collegiate worship in their appropriated churches, which reverted to normal parish status. The chapel of Merton College, Oxford, however, continued to serve as a collegiate church until 1891; just as the chapel of Christ Church, Oxford doubles as the cathedral of Oxford; while the chapel of Eton College serves as the parish church of Eton to this day. The Church of St Mary Magdalene, Newark-on-Trent, though never collegiate in the medieval period, maintained a choral foundation for collegiate worship after the Reformation in association with the Magnus Bequest, an arrangement that continued till 1901.

Otherwise, twelve colleges survived the Reformation in England and Wales in nominal form. In some cases these were refoundations under Queen Mary (as for instance the college of Wolverhampton); in other cases, they may simply have been overlooked by the suppression commissioners. Unlike at Manchester, Ripon and Southwell, these churches did not continue to maintain regular collegiate worship, but their prebends or portioners persisted as non-resident sinecures, and as such were mostly dissolved by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 113). However, the Victorian legislators themselves overlooked two churches of portioners in Shropshire – St Mary&#x27;s, Burford and St George&#x27;s, Pontesbury; and also the college of Saint Endellion in Cornwall, which uniquely continues collegiate to this day, having in 1929 been provided with new statutes that re-established non-resident unpaid prebends and an annual chapter.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, there are a number of ancient churches still in regular use that are collegiate churches. Most notably the church known as St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Dublin, is a collegiate church. St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church (in Youghal founded 1220, County Cork, a building of very remote antiquity, home to a fine choir, The Clerks Choral. St Nicholas&#x27; Collegiate Church in Galway, founded in 1320 and granted collegiate status in 1484, is another fine example of a pre-reformation Collegiate Church. The Collegiate Church of St Peter and St Paul is located in Kilmallock; founded by 1241, it was dedicated as a collegiate church in 1410.

===Scotland===

The church now referred to as &#x27;St Giles Cathedral&#x27;, in Edinburgh, became a collegiate church in 1466, less than a century before the Scottish Reformation.

===Wales===

St Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Ruthin, was built by John de Grey in 1310, following the erection of Ruthin Castle by his father, Reginald de Grey in 1277. For some time before this, Ruthin had been the home of a nunnery and a prior. From 1310 to 1536 St Peter&#x27;s was a Collegiate Church served by a Warden and seven priests. Following the dissolution of the college its work was restored on a new pattern by Gabriel Goodman (1528–1601), a Ruthin man who became Dean of Westminster in 1561. Goodman re-established Ruthin school in 1574 and refounded the Almshouses of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, together with the Wardenship of Ruthin in 1590. Since then, St Peter&#x27;s has continued as a Parochial and Collegiate Church with its Warden, Churchwardens and Parochial Church Council. A close relationship is maintained between the Church, Ruthin School and the Almshouses of Christ&#x27;s Hospital.

St Padarn&#x27;s Church, Llanbadarn Fawr was a collegiate church, having originally been founded as a clas church by Saint Padarn, after whom it was named, in the early sixth century. The church had been the seat of a bishop during the years immediately following St Padarn, who was its first bishop. The church was re-founded as a cell of St Peter&#x27;s, Gloucester (a Benedictine abbey), by Gilbert fitzRichard. Monastic life at Llanbadarn Fawr was short-lived for the Welsh drove the English monks away when they re-conquered Cardigan. The priory later became a college of priests. Thomas Bradwardine, later briefly Archbishop of Canterbury, was Rector of Llanbadarn Fawr 1347–1349, and thereafter the Abbot of the Cistercian Vale Royal Abbey, Chester, was ex officio Rector 1360–1538.

The old Bishop&#x27;s Palace at Abergwili, home to the Bishop of St David&#x27;s since 1542, when Bishop William Barlow transferred his palace from St David&#x27;s to Abergwili, re-using the premises of an older college of priests. The building is believed to have been built between 1283 and 1291, when Thomas Bek was made bishop of St Davids. It was known as a college until it was amalgamated with the Dominican friary now known as Christ College Brecon, refounded as a public school in 1541. It was almost completely rebuilt in 1903 following a disastrous fire. It contains the chapel originally added by Archbishop Laud in 1625, when he was Bishop of St David&#x27;s. In 1974 the old episcopal palace was purchased by Carmarthenshire County Council for use as a museum, whilst a new residence for the bishops, &quot;Llys Esgob&quot;, was built in part of the grounds, together with Diocesan Offices – thereby continuing a connection with Abergwili which has now lasted for well over 400 years.

St. Cybi&#x27;s Collegiate and Parish Church, Holyhead, was another collegiate church, as is the Collegiate and Parish Church of St Mary, St Mary&#x27;s Square, Swansea, along with St Beuno&#x27;s Church, Clynnog Fawr.

<text>The green ribbon can have a variety of symbolic meanings.
== Mitochondrial disease ==
Mitochondrial disease awareness is represented by a green ribbon. Mitochondrial disease (mito) is a debilitating genetic disorder that robs the body&#x27;s cells of energy, causing multiple organ dysfunction or failure and potentially death. There are many forms of mitochondrial disease; it is highly complex and can affect anyone of any age. Mitochondrial disease can cause any symptom in any organ at any age. There are currently no cures and few effective treatments.

== Cerebral palsy ==
Cerebral palsy (CP) awareness is represented by a green ribbon. CP is one of the most common childhood disabilities and represents a wide range of fine and gross motor function impairment, mental delay and other combinations caused by injury to the brain through trauma, lack of oxygen at birth or another cause.

==Mental health==
Mental health awareness is represented by a green ribbon.

== Kidney disease ==
Kidney disease and kidney cancer awareness are another cause represented by the green ribbon. People who have kidney disease, are on dialysis, have received a kidney transplant, or who are living kidney donors wear the green ribbon to help raise awareness about the condition. March is kidney awareness month and those who are affected by the kidney disease or would like to support the cause and raise awareness, are encouraged to wear the ribbon all month long. 

==Levellers and early Whig radicals==
In 17th century England during and after the English Civil War the wearing of a sea-green ribbon symbolized affiliation with the ideals of the Levellers and later in the century with radical Whiggism.
The green ribbon and sprigs of rosemary were symbols of support for the Levellers during the English Civil War and English Interregnum. At the funeral of Thomas Rainsborough (a Member of Parliament and also a Leveller leader who had spoken at the Putney Debates) there were thousands of mourners wearing the Levellers&#x27; ribbons of sea-green and bunches of rosemary for remembrance in their hats, as there were the next year, 1649, at the funeral of Robert Lockyer a New Model Army Agitator executed by Oliver Cromwell for mutiny.

The Green Ribbon Club was one of the earliest of the loosely combined associations which met from time to time in London taverns or coffee-houses for political purposes in the 17th century. It had its meeting place at the King&#x27;s Head tavern at Chancery Lane End, so was known as the King&#x27;s Head Club. It seems to have been founded about the year 1675 as a resort for members of the political party hostile to the court. As these associates were in the habit of wearing in their hats a bow, or bob, of green ribbon, as a distinguishing badge useful for the purpose of mutual recognition in street brawls, the name of the club was changed, about 1679, to the Green Ribbon Club. The &#x27;Green Ribbon&#x27; was the badge of The Levellers in the English Civil Wars in which many of the members had fought and was an overt reminder of their radical origins.

==Support of farm families==
In 1998, Margaret Bruce, a Pastoral Associate at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in North Dakota, sought a way to support farm families and came up with the idea of a green ribbon and a card that read &quot;We care through prayer.&quot; Around the same time, the National Catholic Rural Life Conference (NCRLC) began receiving emergency calls from farm families in stress and saw that the situation was getting worse across the country. In November 1998, NCRLC launched the Green Ribbon Campaign at their 75th anniversary meeting. They developed and began to disseminate rural crisis packets to help parishes deal with the growing rural crisis.

== HIV/AIDS ==
In the UK, in November 2008, a Manchester-based support group for people living with or being affected by HIV/AIDS; launched a campaign called Body Positive North West, using a green ribbon as their symbol. The aim is to raise awareness of 60 second HIV testing and encourage more people to get themselves screened for HIV, as research suggests that over a third of all HIV-infected people in Britain, are themselves unaware of this.

==Awareness of other political and cultural issues==

*Following the July 2005 London bombings, British police in Nottinghamshire distributed green ribbons as part of a Good Faith campaign to show support for Muslim communities.
*A green ribbon draped around the symbol for the game Quake was used to raise awareness of sexual discrimination against female players.
*In Iran the green ribbon was used as a sign of support for Mir-Hossein Mousavi in 2009 Iranian presidential election, a color which has since become pervasive in Iran.
*Moderate group and fringe localist which don&#x27;t associate with pro-democracy camp and pro-Beijing camp in Hong Kong.
*In Russia, the green ribbon is used as a sign of anti-war protests against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, usually not displayed on person as St. George ribbon.

<text>Canon () is a Christian title usually used to refer to a member of certain bodies in subject to an ecclesiastical rule.

Originally, a canon was a cleric living with others in a clergy house or, later, in one of the houses within the precinct of or close to a cathedral or other major church and conducting his life according to the customary discipline or rules of the church. This way of life grew common (and is first documented) in the 8th century AD. In the 11th century, some churches required clergy thus living together to adopt the rule first proposed by Saint Augustine that they renounce private wealth. Those who embraced this change were known as Augustinians or Canons Regular, whilst those who did not were known as secular canons.

==Secular canons==
=== Latin Church===
In the Latin Church, canons are the members of a chapter, that is a body of senior clergy overseeing either a cathedral (a cathedral chapter) or a collegiate church. Depending on the title of the church, several languages use specific titles, e.g., in German &quot;Domherr or Domkapitular&quot; in a &quot;Dom&quot; (i.e., cathedral), &quot;Stiftsherr&quot; in a prelature that has the status of a Stift (notably under a prince of the Church).

One of the functions of the cathedral chapter in the Latin Church was to elect a vicar capitular (now named a diocesan administrator) to serve during a &quot;sede vacante&quot; period of the diocese. Since the 1983 revision of the Code of Canon Law, this responsibility belongs to the college of consultors, unless the national bishops conference decides that the functions that canon law ascribes to the college of consultors, including this one, are to be entrusted to the cathedral chapter.

===Church of England===
All canons of the Church of England have been secular since the Reformation, although an individual canon may also be a member of a religious order. Mostly, however, they are ordained, that is, priests or other clergy. Today, the system of canons is retained almost exclusively in connection with cathedral churches. A canon is a member of the chapter of (for the most part) priests, headed by a dean, which is responsible for administering a cathedral or certain other churches that are styled collegiate churches. The dean and chapter are the formal body which has legal responsibility for the cathedral and for electing the bishop.

==Honorary canons==

The title of Canon is not a permanent title and, when no longer in a position entitling preferment, it is usually dropped from a cleric&#x27;s title nomenclature. However, it is still given in many dioceses to senior parish priests (including some rural deans, those who have played a role in the wider life of the diocese, those who have served in the diocese for a long time, or similar) as a largely honorary title. It is usually awarded in recognition of long and dedicated service to the diocese. Honorary canons are members of the chapter in name but are non-residential and receive no emoluments. They are entitled to call themselves canon and may have a role in the administration of the cathedral.


Generally speaking, canons in Anglican churches are either canons &quot;residentiary&quot; (working at the cathedral, and few in number) or &quot;honorary&quot; canons (non-cathedral clergy given the title as a mark of honour—often many of them): either may wear a violet or violet-trimmed cassock. In some Church of England dioceses, the title &quot;Prebendary&quot; is used instead of &quot;Canon&quot; when the cleric is involved administratively with a cathedral. Canons may be members of the diocesan or bishop&#x27;s staff rather than the cathedral staff, such as in the United States Episcopal Church, where a diocese&#x27;s &quot;Canon to the Ordinary&quot; is a senior priest who works directly for the diocesan bishop (ordinary).

Honorary canons within the Catholic Church may still be nominated after the Second Vatican Council. Also, priests (and honorary chaplains) of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre are, in fact, titular or honorary canons of these respective Orders and have the right to the honorific title of &quot;Canon&quot; and &quot;Monsignor&quot; in addition to the choir dress of a canon, which includes the mozetta (black with purple piping for Malta and white with a red Jerusalem cross for Holy Sepulchre.

===Lay canons===
Since the reign of King Henry IV, the heads of state of France have been granted by the Pope the title of sole honorary canon of Saint John Lateran and Saint Peter&#x27;s. On the demise of the Kingdom of France this honour became transferred to the Presidents of the Republic, and hence is currently held by Emmanuel Macron. This applies even when the French President is not a Catholic or even an atheist. The proto-canon of the papal basilica of Saint Mary Major is the King of Spain, currently Felipe VI.

Before the English Reformation, the King of England was a canon of the Basilica of Saint Paul outside the Walls.

In addition to canons who are clerics in holy orders, cathedrals in the Anglican Communion may also appoint lay persons as canons. The rank of &quot;lay canon&quot; is especially conferred upon diocesan chancellors (the senior legal officer of the diocese, who is usually, though not exclusively, a lay person).

It has traditionally been said that the King of England (now the British Sovereign) is a canon or prebendary of St David&#x27;s Cathedral, Wales. However, this is based on a misconception. The canonry of St Mary&#x27;s College, St David&#x27;s became the property of the Crown on the dissolution of the monasteries. The Sovereign was never a canon of St David&#x27;s, even as a layman (see also the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion (1562) Article 37), though he or she may occupy the first prebendal stall, which is assigned for the monarch&#x27;s use.

==Canon professors==
A canon professor is a canon at an Anglican cathedral (either lay or in orders) who also holds a university professorship. There are four canon professorships in the University of Oxford in conjunction with Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford and two in Durham University in conjunction with Durham Cathedral, although academics titled &quot;canon professor&quot; may also be found at other universities where the appointments as canon and professor have been made independently.

Section 2 of the Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measure 1995 was passed for the express purpose of enabling Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, to appoint not more than two lay canons. One of the motivations for this provision was that, under section 6 of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840 (3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 113), the position of Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History in the University of Oxford was annexed to a residentiary canonry of the cathedral, meaning that the Regius professorship could be held only by an Anglican priest. Following the death of Peter Hinchliff in 1995 the Regius professorship was held by Henry Mayr-Harting, a Catholic layman, from 1997 until 2003, and was taken up by another lay person, Sarah Foot, in Michaelmas Term 2007. Three other Statutory Professorships, the Regius Professorship of Divinity, Lady Margaret Professorship of Divinity, recently held by the famous Anglican theologian, John Macquarrie, and Regius Professorship of Moral and Pastoral Theology, are annexed to canonries of Christ Church and were until recently held only by Anglican priests.

At Durham, the canon professorships are the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity, the holder of which must be an Anglican priest, and the Michael Ramsey Professor of Anglican Studies, who must be Anglican but did not have to be ordained. Historically, the chair in Greek at the university was also a canon professorship. This canonry was transferred to the Lightfoot Professor of Divinity in 1940.

The Lightfoot professorship was attached to the canonry until 1985, when the non-Anglican James Dunn was appointed.

==Minor canons==

Minor canons are those clergy who are members of the foundation of a cathedral or collegiate establishment. They take part in the daily services. They have sometimes formed a distinct corporation as at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. In St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, Dublin, they are distinct from, and rank before, the Vicars Choral. The two groups overlap however; the two senior vicars, the Dean&#x27;s Vicar and the Succentor, are also the two senior Minor Canons. Some Minor Canons do sit with, but are not voting members of, the Chapter. Although at present Minor Canons are generally more junior clergy this is a recent development. Within living memory such offices were often freehold and were held by clergy of great distinction and seniority.

==Canons regular==
Canons regular are the members of certain religious orders in the Catholic Church (not to be confused with clerics regular), composed of priests who live in community with lay brothers. Their goal is to combine the clerical and monastic forms of life, thus they are equally committed to pastoral ministry and to the communal celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours. Their distinctive religious habit is the rochet, which can be rendered in a range of forms.

There are a variety of congregations of canons, some of which are part of the Confederation of Canons Regular of St. Augustine:

* Canons Regular of the Lateran or St. Saviour, which seems to date back to Pope Alexander II (1063)
* Order of the Canons Regular of Premontre, commonly known as Norbertines, founded by St. Norbert (1120)
* Order of the Holy Cross (Canons Regular) founded in Portugal in 1131 and re-founded in 1977
* Canons Regular of the Order of the Holy Cross (the Crosiers), founded at Clair-lieu, near Huy, in Belgium, in 1211
* Swiss Congregation of Canons Regular of the Abbey of Saint Maurice of Agaune
* Gilbertine Order, a solely English order of canons regular, driven to extinction under King Henry VIII
* Canons Regular of the Immaculate Conception, founded in France in 1871
* Canons Regular of St. John Cantius, founded in 1998 by C. Frank Phillips, C.R., and Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I.
* The Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, which is a Catholic Society of Apostolic Life dedicated to the Traditional Latin Mass, practice a rule of life generally based on historical secular canons. They refer to their priests as Canons, use the style &quot;The Rev. Canon [Name]&quot; and wear distinct choir dress.

Many bishops endeavoured to imitate St. Augustine and St. Eusebius, and to live a common life with the clergy of their church. Rules taken from the sacred canons were even drawn up for their use, of which the most celebrated is that of St. Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz (766). In the tenth century, this institution declined; the canons, as the clergy attached to a church and living a common life were called, began to live separately; some of them, however, resisted this relaxation of discipline, and even added poverty to their common life. This is the origin of the canons regular. Pope Benedict XII by his constitution &quot;Ad decorem&quot; (15 May 1339) prescribed a general reform of the canons regular. The canons regular ex professo united Holy Orders with religious life, and being attached to a church, devoted themselves to promoting the dignity of divine worship. With monks, Holy Orders are incidental and secondary, and are superadded to the religious life. With canons as with the clerks regular, Holy Orders are the principal thing, and the religious life is superadded to the Holy Orders.

<text>The pink ribbon is an international symbol of breast cancer awareness. Pink ribbons, and the color pink in general, identify the wearer or promoter with the breast cancer brand and express moral support for people with breast cancer. Pink ribbons are most commonly seen during National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

==History==

Charlotte Haley, who had battled breast cancer, introduced the concept of a peach-colored breast cancer awareness ribbon. She attached them to cards saying, “&quot;The National Cancer Institute’s annual budget is 1.8 billion US dollars, and only 5 percent goes to cancer prevention. Help us wake up our legislators and America by wearing this ribbon.&quot;”

Haley was strictly grassroots, handing the cards out at the local supermarket and writing prominent women, everyone from former First Ladies to Dear Abby. Her message spread by word of mouth. Haley distributed thousands of these cards.

The peach colored ribbon of Haley aroused interest from Alexandra Penney, editor in chief of&quot; Self magazine&quot;, who was working on&quot; Self magazine&quot;&#x27;s 1992 National Breast Cancer Awareness Month issue. She saw the initiative to adapt to Haley&#x27;s idea by working with her. But Haley rejected the offer saying that Self&#x27;s initiative was too commercial.

Unable to use Haley&#x27;s peach ribbon for legal reasons, &quot;Self magazine&quot; and others interested in promoting breast cancer awareness with a ribbon as a symbol decided to go pink.

==Meaning==
The color pink is considered feminine in modern Western countries. It evokes traditional feminine gender roles, caring for other people, being beautiful, being good, and being cooperative.

The pink ribbon represents the courage to fight breast cancer, hope for the future, and the charitable goodness of people and businesses who publicly support the breast cancer movement. It is intended to evoke solidarity with women who currently have breast cancer.

Breast cancer organizations use the pink ribbon to associate themselves with breast cancer, to promote breast cancer awareness, and to support fundraising. Some breast cancer-related organizations, such as Pink Ribbon International, use the pink ribbon as their primary symbol. Susan G. Komen for the Cure uses a stylized &quot;running ribbon&quot; as their logo.

While specifically representing breast cancer awareness, the pink ribbon is also a symbol and a of goodwill towards women in general. Buying, wearing, displaying, or sponsoring pink ribbons signals that the person or business cares about women. The pink ribbon is a marketing brand for businesses that allows them to promote themselves with women and identify themselves as being socially aware. Compared to other women&#x27;s issues, promoting breast cancer awareness is politically safe.

==Products==

Each October, many products are emblazoned with pink ribbons, colored pink, or otherwise sold with a promise of a small portion of the total cost being donated to support breast cancer awareness or research.

The first breast cancer awareness stamp in the U.S., featuring a pink ribbon, was issued 1996. As it did not sell well, a new stamp with an emphasis on research was designed. The new stamp does not feature the pink ribbon.

Wacoal launched a bra in 1999 known as the Awareness Bra, which features a pink ribbon on each band to remind women to be conscious of their breast health. In 2001, the Fit for the Cure campaign was launched to raise funds for breast cancer awareness and research. Wacoal donates to Susan G. Komen for every woman who participates in a complimentary fitting during Fit for the Cure.

In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint produced a silver commemorative breast cancer coin. 15,000 coins were minted during 2006. On one side of the coin, a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is illustrated, while on the other side a pink ribbon has been enameled. Additionally, 30 million 25-cent coins were minted with pink ribbons during 2006 for normal circulation. Designed by the mint&#x27;s director of engraving, Cosme Saffioti, this colored coin is the second in history to be put into regular circulation.

==Intellectual property status==
In most jurisdictions, the pink ribbon is considered public domain. However, in Canada, the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation claimed ownership of the ribbon as a trademark until it was voluntarily abandoned.

==Criticism==
The pink ribbon is frequently used in cause-related marketing, a cooperation between non-profits and businesses to promote a product that also supports a cause. Because the pink ribbon is not licensed by any corporation, it is more open to being abused by businesses that donate little or none of their revenue to breast cancer research. While companies such as Estée Lauder have distributed over 70 million pink ribbons, and donated over $25 million to breast cancer research, other companies have been discovered using the pink ribbon inappropriately—either by not donating their profits, or by using the pink ribbon on products that include ingredients which cause cancer.

===Pinkwashing===
Activism against pinkwashing targets breast cancer awareness and donation campaigns that are merely an alibi. The origins of activism against pinkwashing have been dated to a 1985 Breast Cancer Action (BCA) campaign. In 2002 activism against corporate pinkwashing gained international media coverage when the BCA launched its &quot;Think before You Pink&quot; campaign against companies or organisations &quot;that claim to care about breast cancer by promoting a pink ribbon product, but at the same time produce, manufacture and/or sell products that are likely to cause the disease.&quot; The &quot;Think Before You Pink&quot; campaign urged people to &quot;do something besides shop.&quot; The BCA has particularly excoriated major cosmetic companies such as Avon, Revlon, and Estée Lauder, which have claimed to promote women&#x27;s health while simultaneously using known and/or suspected cancer-causing chemicals, such as parabens and phthalates in their products.

As alternative to pinkwashing the BCA runs an annual awareness campaign &quot;Breast Cancer Industry Month&quot; to emphasize the costs of treatment. The Susan G. Komen Foundation, founded 1982 to end breast cancer forever, has also been criticized for pinkwashing because its corporate partnerships amount to little more than cause related marketing that encourage a culture of consumerism. In response to this criticism the Komen Foundation and the then New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman established guidelines to help consumers understand what their donations support. The use of breast cancer or the pink ribbon in cause marketing to promote products such as firearms or pornography has also drawn controversy.

In her 2006 book &quot;Pink Ribbons, Inc.: Breast Cancer and the Politics of Philanthropy&quot; Samantha King claimed that breast cancer has been transformed from a serious disease and individual tragedy to a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitch. The book inspired a 2012 National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;Pink Ribbons, Inc.&quot;, directed by Léa Pool.
==Other meanings==
* Pink ribbons for girls (and blue for boys) were used from the mid-19th century on christening gowns in Paris, and to a limited extent in the United States. In St. Petersburg (Russia) ribbons of the same color scheme were used on white funeral shrouds for children.

<doc id="1067978" wikidata="Q132153" url="?curid=1067978" title="Litopterna">
<text>Litopterna (from &quot;smooth heel&quot;) is an extinct order of South American native ungulates that lived from the Paleocene to the Pleistocene-Holocene around 62.5 million to 12,000 years ago (or possibly as late as 3,500 years ago), and were also present in Antarctica during the Eocene. They represent the second most diverse group of South American ungulates after Notoungulata. It is divided into nine families, with Proterotheriidae and Macraucheniidae being the most diverse and last surviving families.

== Diversity ==
The body forms of many litopterns, notably in the limb and skull structure, are broadly similar to those of living ungulates, unlike other South American native ungulate groups, which are often strongly divergent from living ungulates. Paleocene and Eocene litopterns generally had small body masses, with &quot;Protolipterna&quot; (Protolipternidae) estimated to have had a body mass of , though the Eocene sparnotheriodontids were considerably larger, with estimated body masses of around . Most proterotheriids had body masses of around while many macraucheniids had body masses of around . Some of the last macraucheniids like &quot;Macrauchenia&quot; were considerably larger, with body masses around a ton. Adianthidae generally had small body masses, with members of the genus &quot;Adianthus&quot; estimated to weigh . Members of the proterotheriid subfamily Megadolodinae are noted for having bunodont (rounded cusp) molar teeth, which is largely unique to litopterns among South American native ungulates. Litopterns of the mid-late Cenozoic had hinge-like limb joints and hooves similar to those of modern ungulates, with the weight being supported on three toes in macraucheniids and one in proterotheriids, with the protherotheriid &quot;Thoatherium&quot; developing greater toe reduction than that present in living horses. Macraucheniids had long necks and limbs. 

Members of the macraucheniid subfamily Macraucheniinae saw the progressive migration of the nasal opening to the top of the skull, which was often historically suggested to indicate the presence of a trunk, though other authors have suggested that a moose-like prehensile lip, or a saiga-like nose to filter dust are more likely.

== Ecology ==
Litopterns were likely hindgut fermenters. At least some macraucheniids like &quot;Macrauchenia&quot; are suggested to have been mixed feeders feeding on both browse and grass. Sparnotheriodontids are suggested to have been browsers. Some proterotheriids are suggested to have been browsers, while some members proterotheriid subfamily Megadolodinae like &quot;Megadolodus&quot; have been suggested to have been omnivorous with at least part of their diet consisting of hard fruit.

== Evolutionary history ==
Litopterna, like other &quot;South American native ungulates&quot; is thought to have originated from groups of archaic &quot;condylarths&quot; that migrated from North America. Sequencing of the collagen proteome and mitochondrial genome of &quot;Macrauchenia&quot; has revealed that litopterns are true ungulates, sharing a common ancestor with Notoungulata, and with their closest living relatives being Perissodactyla (the group containing living equines, rhinoceros and tapirs) as part of the clade Panperissodactyla, with the split from Perissodactyla being estimated at around 66 million years ago. The relationship of Litopterna to other South American native ungulate groups is uncertain, though it may be closely related to the &quot;condylarth&quot; group Didolodontidae. The earliest litopterns appeared during the early Paleocene, around 62.5 million years ago.

Aside from South America, sparnotheriodontids are also known from the Eocene aged La Meseta Formation in the Antarctic Peninsula, representing the only record of litopterns on the Antarctic continent. Litopterns declined during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, likely as a result of climatic change and competition with recently immigrated North American ungulates who arrived as part of the Great American interchange, following the connection of the previously isolated North and South America via the Isthmus of Panama. &quot;Macrauchenia,&quot; &quot;Xenorhinotherium&quot; (Macraucheniidae) and &quot;Neolicaphrium&quot; (Proterotheriidae) were the last surviving genera of litopterns. All became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene around 12,000 years ago as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, along with most other large mammals in the Americas, co-inciding with the arrival of the first humans to the continent. A study in 2025 suggested that &quot;Xenorhinotherium&quot; may have survived until the late Holocene based on a specimen radiocarbon dated to 3,493–4,217 years cal. Before Present (BP). It is possible that hunting had a causal role in their extinction.

<text>Anthony Edward Rupert OMSG (4 October 1916 – 18 January 2006) was a South African businessman and conservationist.

He was born on 4 October, 1916 and raised in the small town of Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape Province of the Union of South Africa. His parents were John Peter Rupert and Hester Adriana Rupert.

He studied in Pretoria and ultimately moved to Stellenbosch, where he established the Rembrandt Group and where it still has its headquarters today. He died in his sleep at his home in Thibault Street, Stellenbosch at the age of 89.

==Early life==
After dropping out of medical school due to a lack of funds, Rupert earned a chemistry degree at the University of Pretoria, where he also lectured for a short while. Subsequently, he started a dry-cleaning business.

Some time later, with an initial investment of £10 and together with two fellow investors, he started manufacturing cigarettes in his garage, which he eventually built into the tobacco and industrial conglomerate Rembrandt Group, overseeing its transition to the industrial and luxury branded goods sectors, with Rembrandt eventually splitting into Remgro (an investment company with financial, mining and industrial interests) and Richemont (a Swiss-based luxury goods group). Currently, this business empire encompasses hundreds of companies located in 35 countries on six continents, with combined yearly net sales in the region of US$10 billion.

Rupert had also been deeply involved in environmental conservation and his companies have been prominent in funding the fine arts; since 1964, foundations established by Rembrandt have used a part of the group&#x27;s profits for the promotion of education, art, music and the preservation of historical buildings.

He also played an important role in the South African Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC), a non-profit company whose loans to small and medium-sized businesses have created nearly half a million jobs since 1981.

==Business career ==
Rupert established the tobacco company &quot;Voorbrand Tobacco Company&quot; in 1939 manufacturing snuff. He soon renamed it Rembrandt Ltd., whose overseas tobacco interests were consolidated into Rothmans in 1972.

In 1988, the Rembrandt group founded the Swiss luxury goods company, Richemont, which in turn acquired Rembrandt&#x27;s shares in Rothmans. Richemont also owns such luxury brands as Cartier (jewellery); Alfred Dunhill and Sulka (designer clothing); Seeger (leather bags); Piaget, Baume &amp; Mercier and Vacheron Constantin (Swiss watches) and Montblanc (writing instruments).

In 1995, Rembrandt and Richemont consolidated their respective tobacco interests into Rothmans International, which was at the time the world&#x27;s fourth largest cigarette manufacturer.

In 1999, Rothmans International merged with British American Tobacco (BAT), the world&#x27;s second largest cigarette producer. Remgro held 10% and Richemont held 18.6% of BAT before unbundling.

Anton&#x27;s eldest son, Johann Rupert, is now the CEO of Richemont and chairman of Remgro.

The Rupert family is also deeply involved in the South African wine and liquor industry, owning the L&#x27;Ormarins and La Motte wine estates and having a stake in Rupert &amp; Rothschild Vignerons, the wine-making partnership between the Rupert and Rothschild families (at the time of his death due to a car crash in 2001, Rupert&#x27;s youngest son, Anthonij, was head of Rupert &amp; Rothschild Vignerons.)

The Ruperts also partially control two of South Africa&#x27;s largest wine merchant houses, Stellenbosch Farmers&#x27; Winery (SFW) and Distillers Corporation, who together produce one of every six bottles of wine in South Africa and nearly eighty percent of the country&#x27;s brandy. These two companies have merged to form Distell Group Limited.

Among other interests, the Rupert Group also owns South Africa&#x27;s second-largest chain of private hospitals, the Medi-Clinic Corporation, with 5,500 beds.

According to his biography, Rupert&#x27;s business career spanned over sixty years. He started his global empire with a personal investment of just £10 in 1941 becoming named on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of 500 wealthiest families worldwide. At the time of his death his assets were estimated at $1.7 billion.

==Politics==

In 1966, he was mentioned as a possible candidate for Prime Minister as a part of a &quot;Verwoerd must go&quot; campaign. The Cape Province section of the ruling National Party endorsed Rupert over Verwoerd, citing the need to improve South Africa&#x27;s international standing and Rupert&#x27;s image as a &quot;moderate&quot; who could unify the country, whilst still maintaining and developing the Apartheid system. Verwoerd was assassinated within one month, and hardliner John Vorster was endorsed by the NP caucus to replace him; Vorster was to become South Africa&#x27;s longest consecutive-serving head of government.

He was a member of the secret Afrikaner society, the Afrikaner Broederbond in the 1940s, but eventually he dismissed it as an &quot;absurdity&quot;, and allowed his membership to lapse.

== Involvement in conservation ==

Rupert was a founding member of the WWF (World Wildlife Fund) and it was in his role as the president of the organisation&#x27;s South African branch that he took a lead in the creation of trans-frontier parks (also known as trans-frontier conservation areas (TFCAs) or &quot;peace parks&quot;), such as the Lubombo Transfrontier Conservation Area. He also established The 1001: A Nature Trust in 1970, a financial endowment to fund the organisation.

With an initial grant of 1.2 million Rand (US$260,000) from the Rupert Nature Foundation, the Peace Parks Foundation was established on 1 February 1997 to facilitate the establishment of TFCAs in southern Africa. Nelson Mandela, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands and Anton Rupert were the founding patrons of the Peace Parks Foundation. In 2000, the Cape Tercentenary Foundation awarded him the Molteno Medal for lifetime services to cultural and nature conservation.

==Acknowledgement==

In 2004, he was voted 28th in the television series, Top 100 Great South Africans.

<text>Paul Marie Eugène Vieille (2 September 1854 – 14 January 1934) was a French chemist who invented modern nitrocellulose-based smokeless gunpowder in 1884. He was a graduate of École Polytechnique.

==Impact==
The new smokeless powder, called Poudre B, was three times as powerful as black powder for the same weight and left virtually no residues of combustion. Paul Vieille soon became director of the &quot;Laboratoire Central des Poudres et Salpetres&quot; in Paris, where his research had taken place. His invention was applied not only to small arms but also to the full range of artillery ammunition. His invention was widely followed within a short time by all the major military powers. Vieille received the Prix Leconte (₣50,000) in 1889 in recognition of his discovery. Veille was a member of the French Academy of Sciences.

<text>George Leonard Berry (September 12, 1882December 4, 1948) was president of the International Printing Pressmen and Assistants&#x27; Union of North America from 1907 to 1948 and a Democratic United States Senator from Tennessee from 1937 to 1938.

Prior to his appointment as Senator, his closest brush with national electoral politics was narrowly coming in second for the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in 1924, losing in the balloting to Nebraska Governor Charles W. Bryan, the brother of William Jennings Bryan.

==Early life==

Berry was born in Hawkins County, Tennessee, near Rogersville. He left home at a very early age, becoming a pressman&#x27;s assistant in 1891. He worked in this trade and was a labor union activist, being elected president of its international union in 1907.

==Pressmen&#x27;s Home==
During his tenure, the Pressmen&#x27;s Union acquired and operated the former Hale Springs Resort, a mineral water resort in East Tennessee not far from Berry&#x27;s boyhood home, as a sanatorium for its members suffering from &quot;consumption&quot; (tuberculosis), a common ailment of its members in that era, a residential trade school for its members to learn more advanced trades and increase their income, and as its international headquarters.

Berry had learned of its availability during a visit to his home area in conjunction with a search of the relatively nearby Asheville, North Carolina area, then renowned for its supposed curative properties with regard to respiratory disease. This facility became known as the &quot;Pressmen&#x27;s Home&quot;. It was designed to be largely self-sufficient, and one point had a large agricultural operation, and, prior to the coming of the Tennessee Valley Authority, its own hydroelectric power plant.

==Political experience==
In World War I, Berry participated in the American Expeditionary Force with the rank of major, serving overseas 1918–1919, and then returned home to resume active leadership of his union. He was frequently a delegate to many national and international labor meetings and congresses, and at the 1924 Democratic Convention, was almost nominated for Vice President. On May 6, 1937, he was appointed to the United States Senate by governor of Tennessee Gordon Browning to serve in the place of Nathan L. Bachman, who had died in office.

Turning the day-to-day operation of the union over to others, Berry moved to Washington, D.C. to attend to his senatorial duties. Berry opted to run in the 1938 Senate special election for the balance of the unexpired term, but was defeated in the Democratic primary by district attorney Tom Stewart, with the challenger winning 49% of the vote to Berry&#x27;s 29%. Stewart had been seen as the more traditionally conservative candidate of the two, with Berry having been a prominent labor activist. Incumbent Governor Browning, who had appointed Berry to the Senate, was defeated in the nomination process by Prentice Cooper in the same year&#x27;s primary cycle.

Some political historians feel that these defeats can be almost entirely attributed to the influence of the Memphis-based political machine of E. H. Crump, who supported both Stewart and Cooper. Berry&#x27;s service as a Senator ended on November 8, 1938, when the votes in the general election indicating Stewart&#x27;s election were tallied, even though Stewart did not actually take the seat until early the next year.

==Death==
Berry returned to day-to-day operation of the union and his interests, including agriculture, around the Pressmen&#x27;s Home until his death. (The union continued to operate the facility for several years after Berry&#x27;s death.) He was interred at Pressmen&#x27;s Home but his body was later moved to McKinney Cemetery in nearby Rogersville.

<text>The 33-centimeter or 900 MHz band is a portion of the UHF radio spectrum internationally allocated to amateur radio on a secondary basis. It ranges from 902 to 928 MHz and is unique to ITU Region 2 (Americas). It is primarily used for very local communications as opposed to bands lower in frequency. However, very high antennas with high gain have shown 33 centimeters can provide good long-range communications almost equal to systems on lower frequencies such as the 70 centimeter band. The band is also used by industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) equipment, as well as low-powered unlicensed devices. Amateur stations must accept harmful interference caused by ISM users but may receive protection from unlicensed devices.

The 900 MHz frequency is also used as a reference band e.g. to express the total power or impact of the electric field &quot;E&quot; - expressed in V/m - or the power density &quot;S&quot; - expressed in W/m2 - of the overall cellular frequencies emission caused by all frequencies s.a. the four bands 850 / 900 / 1,800 / 1,900 MHz – which many GSM phones support and mobile phone operators use - used by all mobile phone operators at the same time to a certain space where e.g. humans are exposed to these frequencies over a certain span of time. More: Mobile phone radiation and health section.

In ITU Region 3, New Zealand domestically allocates 915 MHz to 928 MHz to amateurs. In Australia, this spectrum is allocated to radiolocation and scientific-medical services.

==History==

* Origin as a replacement for 1215-1240 MHz (removed from the 23-centimeter band allocation in 1979)
** Relation to WARC 1979
** Relation to GPS allocation

The 33–centimeter band has a somewhat short history, being one of the newest amateur radio bands. The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range from 902.0 to 928.0 MHz.

===The beginning===
In 1985, the Federal Communications Commission allocated the frequency band between 902 and 928 MHz to Part 18 ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) devices. In that proceeding, the band was also allocated to the Amateur Radio Service on a secondary basis meaning amateurs could use the band as long as they accepted interference from, and did not cause interference to, primary users.

===900 MHz cordless phones===
In the mid-1990s, many cordless phone manufacturers started producing phones that used the lower and upper ends of the 33–centimeter band for communication between the handset and base. These phones, which are regulated by Part 15 of the FCC&#x27;s regulations, have made amateur use of the upper and lower end of the 33 centimeter band somewhat tricky due to the number of these phones used by the general population. Part 15 devices, by law, must accept interference from any licensed radio service with which they share frequencies.

===900 MHz wireless networking===
In the early 1990s, wireless computer networking was just becoming affordable. Several competing technologies emerged that made use of the 902-928 MHz Part 15 band, such as:
* NCR/AT&amp;T/DEC/Lucent WaveLAN. 915 MHz, 250 mW transmit power. Obsolete, but still in use in certain areas.
* Aironet (now Cisco) ARLAN. 902-928 MHz with 12 channels, 450 mW transmit power. Obsolete, but still in use in certain areas.
* Alvarion BreezeACCESS 900. 902-928 MHz, 200 mW transmit power. Still being sold and in use in certain areas as of 2008.
* A now defunct commercial user of 900 MHz wireless networking was Ricochet. They used 900 MHz for the &quot;last mile&quot; connection to the user in an early wide area mobile wireless network.
* Motorola Canopy is also used by WISPs depending on the Line-of-sight propagation
* XG Technology, Inc. xMax. 902-928 MHz. Less than 1 W. A cognitive radio system still being sold and in use as of 2011.

===ISM: 915 MHz Long Range WAN (LoRaWAN)===
* Frequency range from 902 MHz to 928 MHz as an unlicensed industrial scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band for North America.
* Started in 2009, LoRaWAN were targeting the metering industry and aimed at adding wireless communication capabilities for gas, water and electricity meters. For this purpose, they used Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation technology, a technology widely in use for sonar in the maritime industry and radar in aviation.

===Walkie talkies===
&quot;MotoTalk&quot; or with Nextel, &quot;DirectTalk&quot;, uses the 900 MHz Part 15 band. It uses FHSS and employs 10 &quot;channels&quot; and 15 &quot;privacy codes&quot;. This is available as a feature on several of the walkie-talkie phones, for &quot;off network&quot; simplex communications.

Motorola makes a line of walkie-talkies (the DTR family) which are FHSS digital units. They are very similar to the DirectTalk-capable iDEN cellphones, even sharing some accessory items, but they can not interoperate with DirectTalk units.

Trisquare made a line of walkie-talkies (the eXtreme Radio Service family) that were also license free FHSS units, operating in the 900 MHz band. They were similar to DirectTalk but not compatible.

==Current amateur uses==
Today, the 33 centimeter band is rapidly becoming popular with many UHF enthusiasts. Currently, it is used by amateurs for a variety of purposes.

===Amateur television===
Amateur television is a popular activity on the 33 centimeter band, and some manufacturers produced ATV equipment for this band. The first repeater to use the band, the NU6X/R (Amateur TV Network) on 923.25 MHz, was activated and used at the minute the FCC allowed amateur use of the band and featured in QST Magazine. The repeater moved to 919.25 MHz and call changed to W6ATN because AVM part 90 service at 927 MHz began operation as a primary user of the band.

===CW and single sideband===
Amateurs who are involved in contesting use home-made or commercially available transverters to operate CW and SSB on the lower end of the band, either just above 903 MHz or just above 902 MHz. SSB/CW operations usually use horizontal polarization for most contacts. VHF/UHF contests are conducted by the ARRL Contest managers several times each year to encourage operations across all ham bands. Contacts must be made in the simplex mode - that is, without using a repeater. Any mode (FM, SSB, CW) can be used. Contact scoring is higher for 33 cm than the lower bands (6m through 70 cm).

===FM repeaters===
Until recently, no amateur radio equipment manufacturer has ever made an FM repeater for the 33 centimeter band. But nevertheless, amateurs have adapted other equipment for use in this band. Amateurs who wish to build a repeater and those who wish to use that repeater must do so using modified commercial equipment designed for use in the mid-800 MHz and mid-900 MHz range. The bulk of modified commercial equipment is manufactured by two companies, Motorola and Kenwood.

In 2012, the first two-way 900 MHz radio made specifically for the Amateur Service was introduced by Alinco. The DJ-G29T is a dual band portable radio operating on the 222 MHz and 900 MHz bands and is fully programmable.

====Building repeaters====
The ARRL (American Radio Relay League) has specified that repeaters on the 33 centimeter band use a split of -12 MHz with inputs between 906 and 909 MHz and outputs between 918 and 921 MHz. However, the majority of amateur 33 centimeter band amateur repeaters use a split of -25 MHz with inputs between 902 and 903 MHz and outputs between 927 and 928 MHz. There are several reasons behind this. The primary reason being that most amateur repeaters in this band are built from commercial equipment that has been modified to transmit and receive in the amateur 33 centimeter band and modification complexity increases rapidly as target frequencies are moved further from the original design frequencies. A 25 MHz split results in frequencies fairly close to the original frequencies this commercial equipment was designed for resulting in relatively simple modifications. As well, spectrum analyzer tests consistently show the noise floor to be considerably higher near the center of the band due to other non-amateur services making the quieter frequencies near the band limits more desirable . Finally, the 12 MHz split requires high quality and more expensive duplexer devices to isolate the repeater receiver from the repeater transmitter when sharing a single antenna (as most repeaters do) whereas the 25 MHz split provides sufficient frequency separation such that separate antenna for transmit and receive with 20 feet or more of vertical separation often works well and eliminates the need for expensive duplexers as long as the repeater transmitter is limited to 15 to 20 watts of output power.

With the explosion in popularity of Nextel phones with a push to talk feature, the marketplace has seen a flood of newer 800 and 900 MHz commercial mobile radios that are designed to the following specifications:
*800 MHz Radios:
**Transmit: 806 - 821 MHz and 851 - 870 MHz
**Receive: 851 - 870 MHz
*900 MHz Radios:
**Transmit: 896 - 902 MHz and 935 - 941 MHz
**Receive: 935 - 941 MHz

The receivers on many of these modern 800 MHz radios can be easily modified to receive higher than 870 MHz, to about 904 MHz with good sensitivity. In addition, the transmitters on many of the aforementioned 900 MHz radios can be easily modified to transmit lower than 935 MHz, to about 926 MHz with acceptable power output. With this in mind, many amateurs have opted to set up repeaters with -25 MHz splits using modified 800 MHz radios as receivers and modified 900 MHz radios as transmitters.

A number of resources are available for amateurs to build repeaters that can be used on the 33 cm band.

Resources are also available via several e-mail discussion groups (such as the Yahoo Groups: &quot;AR902 MHz&quot; and &quot;900 MHz&quot;) where information regarding conversion of other brands commonly used (such as Kenwood, EF Johnson, and GE/Ericsson) can be found/discussed.

The advent of issues involving interference to the PAVE PAWS RADAR systems located on the East and West coasts of the United States has pushed many amateur repeater operators to vacate the 70 cm band in favor of 33 cm, and proliferation of 33 cm repeaters has understandably increased exponentially in the past few years.

====Using repeaters====
Amateurs who use local repeaters on the 33 centimeter band use commercial handheld or mobile 900 MHz radios. As shown above, these radios can transmit between 896 and 902 MHz and receive between 935 and 941 MHz. Getting many of these radios to transmit on the repeater&#x27;s input frequency (between 902 and 903 MHz) and receive on the repeater&#x27;s output frequency (between 927 and 928 MHz) usually requires very little or no circuit modification, depending on the choice of radio. For instance, the Motorola model GTX (mobile and handheld versions) do not require any hardware modifications at all. Using these commercial radios however, has one handicap: flexibility. Unlike most other ham radio bands, in which one can tune to any frequency within an amateur band, modification of &quot;Channelized&quot; commercial radios maintains them in a channelized state. Therefore, once programmed, the frequencies they operate on cannot be changed at will without re-programming. However, since almost all FM radio equipment used on the 33 cm band amateur band was previously designed for and internally programmed for frequencies outside the 33 cm band edges, reprogramming is always necessary to get them working properly between 902-928 MHz after any physical modifications have been made. This includes the GTX.

===Linking===
Many amateurs have found the 33 centimeter band to be ideal for linking repeaters together. Some of the biggest linked repeater systems in the United States use the 33 centimeter band as their link backbone.

==Propagation characteristics==
Signal propagation on the 33-centimeter band is very dependent on the transmitting and receiving antenna&#x27;s line of sight. Because of this, many wide-area coverage systems like repeaters are located on top of large hills and mountains which overlook a vast area. This ensures that the transmitting antenna is higher than terrestrial obstructions such as trees and buildings. Assuming that the transmitting antenna&#x27;s wavelength, height above average terrain, and effective radiated power is equal, a transmitted signal on 33 centimeters will, generally speaking, usually travel about 3/4 of the distance that the same signal would if transmitted on the 70 centimeter band. The reader is advised to note that receiver front-end noise figure and antenna gain are the defining factors in line-of-sight signal propagation in the local area.

The 33 centimeter band offers excellent building penetration characteristics since the wavelength is relatively small and can fit through windows more easily than signals lower in frequency.

In many areas, the 33 centimeter band also has a very low noise floor as compared to bands lower in frequency .

<text>Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb is an adventure game developed by The Dreamers Guild and published by New World Computing in 1994.

The point and click adventure game features a world of talking humanoid animals, with the gameplay focusing on a fox on a quest to find a stolen orb, a relic of the mythical humans.

==History==
===Development ===
&quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; was developed by The Dreamers Guild for the DOS platform and published by New World Computing. The game was originally released in 1994 and later ported to the Macintosh. The German version &quot;Erben der Erde: Die große Suche&quot; was published by Softgold and first released as a port to the Amiga, followed by the DOS version.

In 1996 the German computer magazine with CD &quot;Bestseller Games #10&quot; brought 300,000 units of ITE on the German market as budget release.

=== Re-release ===
In 2000 the former Dreamers Guild co-founder Joe Pearce started a new company, Wyrmkeep Entertainment. In 2002 Pearce acquired the rights for the game, and self-published &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; on his website for Windows and macOS. The full version was offered for $20 via PayPal and Kagi.com, while a free demo was downloadable.

In late 2004 Pearce provided the ScummVM developers with the source code of Inherit the Earth&#x27;s SAGA engine (Scripts for Animated Graphic Adventures), which made ports to alternative platforms, like Linux, possible. In March 2007, a Pocket PC edition was released, followed by a port to the iPad in 2010.

The game has also been released digitally on GOG.com and Steam in June 2013.

=== Sequels ===
According to one of the original artists and animators, Lisa Jennings, the game ends on a &quot;To be continued&quot; note, as it was originally intended to be part of a trilogy, which did not happen due to conflicts between the developer and publisher.

In January 2013 a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the development of a sequel was initiated by Wyrmkeep Entertainment, but the funding goal was not met. A second campaign was started in July 2014 with a higher goal to account for adding voice acting to the project. This campaign was also unsuccessful. In March 2015, a Patreon funding drive was launched, with the aim to help finish funding the sequel&#x27;s first of three chapters. This Patreon was intended to lead into another Kickstarter drive, with the base goal undetermined, but stated to be under $30,000.

==Plot==
In a far future, mankind is extinct and Earth is populated by several tribes of anthropomorphic animals – collectively referred to as the Morph – who have achieved a level of technology and societal sophistication roughly equivalent to Europe in the High Middle Ages. The humans are enshrined in legends as having been the ones who gave the Morph prehensile hands, mouths capable of speech, and the ability to think and feel, but the Morph have little understanding of their long-lost forebears, who exist now only in stories, ruins and a few technological relics.

The game begins with the protagonist, Rif of the Fox Tribe, being falsely accused of having stolen the &quot;Orb of Storms&quot; (a technological relic of humankind which is able to predict the weather), primarily based on the fact that he was one of only two foxes in the area at the time of the theft. Rif volunteers to look for the Orb himself, and is given assistance and guards in the form of Eeah of the Elk Guard and Okk of the Boar Tribe. The Boar King takes Rif&#x27;s girlfriend Rhene hostage as insurance.

The trio travel throughout the Known Lands over the course of their investigation. Along the way, they encounter the various Tribes under the protection of the Forest King (the Elk Tribe ruler who exerts hegemonic control over the whole region), some of which have other Orbs containing other knowledge left behind by the humans. With the assistance of Sist, the leader of the Rats, they eventually discover that the Orb of Storms was stolen by a Raccoon, an animal rarely seen in the Known Lands. Sist also reveals that the Boar King has formed an alliance with the Wolves who live far to the north.

Riff, Okk, and Eeah attempt to pass into the Wild Lands, the untamed regions to the north, but are apprehended by Prince, the ruler of the castle in which the Dogs have sequestered themselves. Rif escapes, and eventually secures the help of Alama, a Cat hermit, and a tribe of wildcats to free his friends.

The trio then travel further north, to the isolated island claimed by the Wolves, where they learn that the Raccoon, Chota, has manipulated the Wolves&#x27; politics and stolen the Orb to take over the Known Lands, as the Orb of Storms is the key to a system left behind by the humans to control the weather. In Chota&#x27;s fortress, a human hydroelectric dam, Rif, Okk and Eeah outwit their enemies, and Chota and the Orb are presumed lost. They return to the Known Lands, where Rif convinces the Tribes to work together, so that they will no longer need the Orbs to make their lives better. The Forest King takes his advice, promotes Okk and Eeah, and releases Rhene.

However, the Orb of Storms was not destroyed, and is preparing to initiate Chota&#x27;s final command to begin a long drought, awaiting input on the ending date of the drought.

==Game theme==
A background theme of the game is the fate of the humans. According to the game&#x27;s introduction and manual, the humans created the Morph from their constituent animals, and then mysteriously disappeared sometime later, with nearly all information about human civilization and technology lost or passed into legend. The Rats, the most educated tribe, are the only ones who believe in the humans&#x27; existence, due to their exploration of human ruins.

Most of the human relics are in the third area of the game. On the North Island, the player explores ancient human ruins of hydroelectric dams, airports, and solar observatories, with clues indicating that the humans were struck by a sudden disaster.

David Joiner, one of the game&#x27;s developers, said in an interview that humanity was eradicated by an airborne biological weapon, a scenario inspired by the Alistair MacLean novel &quot;The Satan Bug&quot;. This is alluded to in the game&#x27;s opening sequence, which shows a tapestry depicting humans fleeing from a giant microbe. The developers also explored the idea of humans living in a lunar base, alluded to in-game.

==Webcomic ==
The story of the video game is continued in the official webcomic, &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot;, which takes place ten months after the events of the game. The webcomic is drawn by Allison Hershey, the game&#x27;s original art designer, and co-written by Joe Pearce, the owner of Wyrmkeep Entertainment.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in August 1994 rated &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; 2.5 stars out of five. While praising the graphics&#x27; &quot;storybook charm&quot; the reviewer stated that the game had too many mazes and fetch quests &quot;tacked in order to extend its limited game play&quot;. He reported an &quot;abrupt&quot;, incomplete ending and concluded that the game&#x27;s &quot;puzzles were given the least amount of attention&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1994 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #209 by Sandy Petersen in the &quot;Eye of the Monitor&quot; column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars. Amiga Games issue 9/95 gave 92% and ASM issue 10/94 gave 10/12 points.

James V. Trunzo reviewed &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #48 (Oct., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;Whether you like &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; is definitely a matter of taste. One look at the game box should tell whether it&#x27;s for you or not. What you see on the front and what you read on the back is exactly what you get.&quot;

According to Joe Pearce of The Dreamers Guild, &quot;Inherit the Earth&quot; was a commercial flop, but the game has some loyal following in the furry fandom.

According to Lisa Jennings, concept artist and animator for the game, the game struggled from combining a serious and detailed plot with anthropomorphic animals, a theme usually associated with children&#x27;s entertainment:
