<text>In statistics, nonlinear regression is a form of regression analysis in which observational data are modeled by a function which is a nonlinear combination of the model parameters and depends on one or more independent variables. The data are fitted by a method of successive approximations (iterations).

==General ==
In nonlinear regression, a statistical model of the form,

:formula_1

relates a vector of independent variables, formula_2, and its associated observed dependent variables, formula_3. The function formula_4 is nonlinear in the components of the vector of parameters formula_5, but otherwise arbitrary. For example, the Michaelis–Menten model for enzyme kinetics has two parameters and one independent variable, related by formula_4 by:

:formula_7

This function, which is a rectangular hyperbola, is &quot;nonlinear&quot; because it cannot be expressed as a linear combination of the two &quot;formula_5&quot;s.

Systematic error may be present in the independent variables but its treatment is outside the scope of regression analysis. If the independent variables are not error-free, this is an errors-in-variables model, also outside this scope.

Other examples of nonlinear functions include exponential functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, power functions, Gaussian function, and Lorentz distributions. Some functions, such as the exponential or logarithmic functions, can be transformed so that they are linear. When so transformed, standard linear regression can be performed but must be applied with caution. See , below, for more details.

In general, there is no closed-form expression for the best-fitting parameters, as there is in linear regression. Usually numerical optimization algorithms are applied to determine the best-fitting parameters. Again in contrast to linear regression, there may be many local minima of the function to be optimized and even the global minimum may produce a biased estimate. In practice, estimated values of the parameters are used, in conjunction with the optimization algorithm, to attempt to find the global minimum of a sum of squares.

For details concerning nonlinear data modeling see least squares and non-linear least squares.

==Regression statistics==
The assumption underlying this procedure is that the model can be approximated by a linear function, namely a first-order Taylor series:

:formula_9

where formula_10 are Jacobian matrix elements. It follows from this that the least squares estimators are given by

:formula_11
compare generalized least squares with covariance matrix proportional to the unit matrix. The nonlinear regression statistics are computed and used as in linear regression statistics, but using J in place of X in the formulas. 

When the function formula_12 itself is not known analytically, but needs to be linearly approximated from formula_13, or more, known values (where formula_14 is the number of estimators), the best estimator is obtained directly from the Linear Template Fit as formula_15 (see also linear least squares). 

The linear approximation introduces bias into the statistics. Therefore, more caution than usual is required in interpreting statistics derived from a nonlinear model.

==Ordinary and weighted least squares==

The best-fit curve is often assumed to be that which minimizes the sum of squared residuals. This is the ordinary least squares (OLS) approach. However, in cases where the dependent variable does not have constant variance, or there are some outliers, a sum of weighted squared residuals may be minimized; see weighted least squares. Each weight should ideally be equal to the reciprocal of the variance of the observation, or the reciprocal of the dependent variable to some power in the outlier case 
, but weights may be recomputed on each iteration, in an iteratively weighted least squares algorithm.

==Linearization==
===Transformation===
Some nonlinear regression problems can be moved to a linear domain by a suitable transformation of the model formulation.

For example, consider the nonlinear regression problem

:formula_16

with parameters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; and with multiplicative error term &quot;U&quot;. If we take the logarithm of both sides, this becomes

:formula_17

where &quot;u&quot; = ln(&quot;U&quot;), suggesting estimation of the unknown parameters by a linear regression of ln(&quot;y&quot;) on &quot;x&quot;, a computation that does not require iterative optimization. However, use of a nonlinear transformation requires caution. The influences of the data values will change, as will the error structure of the model and the interpretation of any inferential results. These may not be desired effects. On the other hand, depending on what the largest source of error is, a nonlinear transformation may distribute the errors in a Gaussian fashion, so the choice to perform a nonlinear transformation must be informed by modeling considerations.

For Michaelis–Menten kinetics, the linear Lineweaver–Burk plot

:formula_18

of 1/&quot;v&quot; against 1/[&quot;S&quot;] has been much used. However, since it is very sensitive to data error and is strongly biased toward fitting the data in a particular range of the independent variable, [&quot;S&quot;], its use is strongly discouraged.

For error distributions that belong to the exponential family, a link function may be used to transform the parameters under the Generalized linear model framework.

===Segmentation===

The &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;explanatory variable&quot; (say X) can be split up into classes or segments and linear regression can be performed per segment. Segmented regression with confidence analysis may yield the result that the &quot;dependent&quot; or &quot;response&quot; variable (say Y) behaves differently in the various segments.

The figure shows that the soil salinity (X) initially exerts no influence on the crop yield (Y) of mustard, until a &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot; value (&quot;breakpoint&quot;), after which the yield is affected negatively.

<text>Ernesto Cortés Jr. is the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) co-chair and executive director of the West / Southwest IAF regional network.

The IAF provides leadership training and civics education to poor and moderate-income people across the US and UK. Cortés has been instrumental in the building of over 30 grassroots organizations known for developing and training community leaders.

==Career==

After attending an IAF training in Chicago and organizing in Wisconsin and Indiana in the early 1970s, Cortés returned to his hometown of San Antonio in 1974 to found Communities Organized for Public Service (COPS), the nationally recognized church-based grassroots organization of San Antonio&#x27;s west and south side communities. This work has since expanded to include broad-based organizing projects across ten Southwestern states including Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Iowa, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. These organizations&#x27; diverse faith institutions are joined by schools, labor and professional associations, and non-profits. These organizations leveraged billions of dollars for poorer communities including $700 million in infrastructure improvements in the colonias (areas of Texas which lacked basic drainage systems) during the late 1980s and early 1990s, $2.8 billion in increased public funding to equalize school funding in Texas in the mid-1980s, and $10 million in state funding for workforce development projects equipping underemployed adults with job training options. Millions more have been invested (and saved) in community-level infrastructure, healthcare reform and housing.

Cortés envisioned and launched the Alliance Schools strategy - a lauded initiative to engage communities of adults in public education. Identifying and training parent and community leaders to change the culture of their schools, the Alliance Schools have built a broad base of support for public education, both locally and statewide. Alliance Schools have been successful in raising test scores by building a culture of collaboration, as recently documented by the Annenberg Institute for School Reform.

Assisted by Cortés, the West / Southwest IAF established ten independently operating Labor Market Intermediaries by building the capacity of constituents to create the requisite political will. The graduation rates of these projects consistently outpace those of the community colleges with which they partner, helping over 12,000 low wage employees become higher-paid knowledge workers equipped with the needed skills in high demand fields. These projects have additionally been shown to provide a positive Return On Investment for public entities that invest in them. He also assisted in several living wage campaigns in Texas which raised the wages of over 10,000 workers in the Rio Grande Valley, in addition to those in Austin and San Antonio. A study of Cortes&#x27;s work with IAF in Texas, &quot;Cold Anger,&quot; was written by Mary Beth Rogers. Dozens of other books further describe his work in and beyond Texas.

Cortés coordinates regional and national leadership schools that train grassroots leaders to develop community organizations based on access to political power through relationship building, and social justice initiatives. He has helped community members win water and sewage facility and other infrastructure improvements, election campaigns, and increased access to affordable housing.

==Honors==

In 1984, he was awarded a MacArthur fellowship, also known as a &quot;genius grant.&quot; In 1996, he was the recipient of an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Houston. Besides, he received the prestigious 4th Annual Heinz Award in Public Policy in 1999 and completed fellowships at the JFK School of Government at Harvard and the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. He has been awarded honorary degrees from Southern Methodist University, University of St. Edwards in Austin and Rutgers University in New Jersey. In 2009 he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Princeton University. In 2015, as the Princeton University Stewart Fellow in Religion, he co-taught a course on Religion and Power in Grassroots Democracy.

<text>Storage tubes are a class of cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) that are designed to hold an image for a long period of time, typically as long as power is supplied to the tube.

A specialized type of storage tube, the Williams tube, was used as a main memory system on a number of early computers, from the late 1940s into the early 1950s. They were replaced with other technologies, notably core memory, starting in the 1950s.

In a new form, the bistable tube, storage tubes made a comeback in the 1960s and 1970s for use in computer graphics, most notably the Tektronix 4010 series. Today they are obsolete, their functions provided by low-cost memory devices and liquid crystal displays.

==Operation==

===Background===
A conventional CRT consists of an electron gun at the back of the tube that is aimed at a thin layer of phosphor at the front of the tube. Depending on the role, the beam of electrons emitted by the gun is steered around the display using magnetic (television) or electrostatic (oscilloscope) means. When the electrons strike the phosphor, the phosphor &quot;lights up&quot; at that location for a time, and then fades away. The length of time the spot remains is a function of the phosphor chemistry.

At very low energies, electrons from the gun will strike the phosphor and nothing will happen. As the energy is increased, it will reach a critical point, formula_1, that will activate the phosphor and cause it to give off light. As the voltage increases beyond the brightness of the spot will increase. This allows the CRT to display images with varying intensity, like a television image.

Above another effect also starts, secondary emission. When any insulating material is struck by electrons over a certain critical energy, electrons within the material are forced out of it through collisions, increasing the number of free electrons. This effect is used in electron multipliers as found in night vision systems and similar devices. In the case of a CRT this effect is generally undesirable; the new electrons generally fall back to the display and cause the surrounding phosphor to light up, which appears as a lowering of the focus of the image.

The rate of secondary emission is also a function of the electron beam energy, but follows a different rate curve. As the electron energy is increased, the rate increases until it reaches a critical threshold, when the number of secondary emissions is greater than the number supplied by the gun. In this case the localized image rapidly fades as energy leaving the display through secondary electrons is greater than the rate it is being supplied by the gun.

In any CRT, images are displayed by striking the screen with electron energies between these two values, and . Below no image is formed, and above any image rapidly fades.

Another side effect, initially a curiosity, is that electrons will stick to the phosphor in lit up areas. As the light emission fades, these electrons are likewise released back into the tube. The charge is generally far too small to have a visual effect, and was generally ignored in the case of displays.

===Storage===
These two effects were both utilized in the construction of a storage tube. Storage was accomplished by striking the screen with electrons with energies just above , and erased by striking them with electrons above . There were any number of varieties of mechanical layouts used to improve focus or cause the image to be refreshed either internally to the tube or through off board storage.

The easiest example to understand are the early computer memory systems as typified by the Williams tube. These consisted of World War II surplus radar display CRTs connected to a computer. The X and Y deflection plates were connected to amplifiers that converted memory locations into X and Y positions on the screen.

To write a value to memory, the address was amplified and sent to the Y deflection plates, such that the beam would be fixed to a horizontal line on the screen. A time base generator then set the X deflection plate to increasing voltages, causing the beam to be scanned across the selected line. In this respect, it is similar to a conventional television scanning a single line. The gun was set to a default energy close to , and the bits from the computer fed to the gun to modulate the voltage up and down such that 0&#x27;s would be below and 1&#x27;s above it. By the time the beam reached the other side of the line, a pattern of a short dash was drawn for each 1, while each 0 was represented by a short dot with a trailing uncharged area. This way of encoding ensured a reference signal was always present. The bits were uniformly spaced and separated by uncharged safety margins.

To read the values back out, the deflections plates were set to the same values, but the gun energy set to a value above . As the beam scanned the line, the phosphor was pushed well beyond the secondary emission threshold. If the beam was located over a blank area, a certain number of electrons would be released, but if it was over a lit area, the number would be increased by the number of electrons previously stuck to that area. In the Williams tube, these values were read by measuring the capacitance of a metal plate just in front of the display side of the tube. Electrons leaving the front of the CRT hit the plate and changed its charge. As the reading process also erased any stored values, the signal had to be regenerated through associated circuitry. A CRT with two electron guns, one for reading and one for writing, made this process trivial.

===Imaging systems===
The earliest computer graphics systems, like those of the TX-2 and DEC PDP-1, required the entire attention of the computer to maintain. A list of points stored in main memory was periodically read out to the display to refresh it before the image faded. This generally occurred frequently enough that there was little time to do anything else, and interactive systems like &quot;Spacewar!&quot; were tour-de-force programming efforts.

For practical use, graphical displays were developed that contained their own memory and an associated very simple computer which offloaded the refreshing task from the mainframe. This was not inexpensive; the IBM 2250 graphics terminal used with the IBM S/360 cost $280,000 in 1970.

A storage tube could replace most or all of the localized hardware by storing the vectors directly within the display, instead of an associated local computer. Commands that previously caused the terminal to erase its memory and thus clear the display could be emulated by scanning the entire screen at an energy above . In most systems, this caused the entire screen to quickly &quot;flash&quot; before clearing to a blank state. The two main advantages were:

*Very low bandwidth needs compared to vector graphics displays, thus allowing much longer cable distances between computer and terminal
*No need for display-local RAM (as in modern terminals), which was prohibitively expensive at the time.

Generally speaking, storage tubes could be divided into two categories. In the more common category, they were only capable of storing &quot;binary&quot; images; any given point on the screen was either illuminated or dark. The Tektronix Direct-View Bistable Storage Tube was perhaps the best example in this category. Other storage tubes were able to store greyscale/halftoned images; the tradeoff was usually a much-reduced storage time.

Some pioneering storage tube displays were MIT Project MAC&#x27;s ARDS (Advanced Remote Display Station), the Computek 400 Series Display terminals (a commercial derivative), which both used a Tektronix type 611 storage display unit, and Tektronix&#x27;s 4014 terminal, the latter becoming a de facto computer terminal standard some time after its introduction (later being emulated by other systems due to this status).

The first generalized computer assisted instruction system, PLATO I, c. 1960 on ILLIAC I, used a storage tube as its computer graphics display. PLATO II and PLATO III also used storage tubes as displays.

<doc id="1045027" wikidata="Q654005" url="?curid=1045027" title="Malolactic fermentation">
<text>Malolactic conversion (also known as malolactic fermentation or MLF) is a process in winemaking in which tart-tasting malic acid, naturally present in grape must, is converted to softer-tasting lactic acid. Malolactic fermentation is most often performed as a secondary fermentation shortly after the end of the primary fermentation, but can sometimes run concurrently with it. The process is standard for most red wine production and common for some white grape varieties such as Chardonnay, where it can impart a &quot;buttery&quot; flavor from diacetyl, a byproduct of the reaction.

The fermentation reaction is undertaken by the family of lactic acid bacteria (LAB); &quot;Oenococcus oeni&quot;, and various species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot;. Chemically, malolactic fermentation is a decarboxylation, which means carbon dioxide is liberated in the process.

The primary function of all these bacteria is to convert L-malic acid, one of the two major grape acids found in wine, to another type of acid, L+ lactic acid. This can occur naturally. However, in commercial winemaking, malolactic conversion typically is initiated by an inoculation of desirable bacteria, usually &quot;O. oeni&quot;. This prevents undesirable bacterial strains from producing &quot;off&quot; flavors. Conversely, commercial winemakers actively prevent malolactic conversion when it is not desired, such as with fruity and floral white grape varieties such as Riesling and Gewürztraminer, to maintain a more tart or acidic profile in the finished wine.

Malolactic fermentation tends to create a rounder, fuller mouthfeel. Malic acid is typically associated with the taste of green apples, while lactic acid is richer and more buttery tasting. Grapes produced in cool regions tend to be high in acidity, much of which comes from the contribution of malic acid. Malolactic fermentation generally enhances the body and flavor persistence of wine, producing wines of greater palate softness. Many winemakers also feel that better integration of fruit and oak character can be achieved if malolactic fermentation occurs during the time the wine is in barrel.

A wine undergoing malolactic conversion will be cloudy because of the presence of bacteria, and may have the smell of buttered popcorn, the result of the production of diacetyl. The onset of malolactic fermentation in the bottle is usually considered a wine fault, as the wine will appear to the consumer to still be fermenting (as a result of CO2 being produced). However, for early Vinho Verde production, this slight effervesce was considered a distinguishing trait, though Portuguese wine producers had to market the wine in opaque bottles because of the increase in turbidity and sediment that the &quot;in-bottle MLF&quot; produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice and instead complete malolactic fermentation prior to bottling with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation.

==History==
Malolactic fermentation is possibly as old as the history of wine, but scientific understanding of the positive benefits of MLF and control of the process is a relatively recent development. For many centuries, winemakers noticed an &quot;activity&quot; that would happen in their wines stored in barrel during the warm spring months following harvest. Like primary alcoholic fermentation, this phenomenon would release carbon dioxide gas and seem to have a profound change on the wine that was not always welcomed. It was described as a &quot;second fermentation&quot; in 1837 by the German enologist Freiherr von Babo and the cause for increased turbidity in the wine. Von Babo encouraged winemakers to quickly respond at the first sight of this activity by racking the wine into a new barrel, adding sulfur dioxide, and then following up with another set of racking and sulfuring to stabilize the wine.

In 1866, Louis Pasteur, one of the pioneers of modern microbiology, isolated the first bacteria from wine and determined that all bacteria in wine were a cause for wine spoilage. While Pasteur did notice an acid reduction in wine with the lactic bacteria, he did not link that process to a consumption of malic acid by the bacteria, but rather assumed it was just tartrate precipitation. In 1891, the Swiss enologist Hermann Müller theorized that bacteria may be the cause of this reduction. With the aid of peers, Müller explained his theory of &quot;biological deacidication&quot; in 1913 to be caused by wine bacterium &quot;Bacterium gracile&quot;.

In the 1930s, the French enologist Jean Ribéreau-Gayon published papers stating the benefits of this bacterial transformation in wine. During the 1950s, advances in enzymatic analysis allowed enologists to better understand the chemical processes behind malolactic fermentation. Émile Peynaud furthered enology understanding of the process and soon cultured stock of beneficial lactic acid bacteria was available for winemakers to use.

==Role in winemaking==
The primary role of malolactic fermentation is to deacidify wine. It can also affect the sensory aspects of a wine, making the mouthfeel seem smoother and adding potential complexity in the flavor and aroma of the wine. For these other reasons, most red wines throughout the world (as well as many sparkling wines and nearly 20% of the world&#x27;s white wines) today go through malolactic fermentation.

Malolactic fermentation deacidifies the wine by converting the &quot;harsher&quot; diprotic malic acid to the softer monoprotic lactic acid. The different structures of malic and lactic acids leads to a reduction of titratable acidity (TA) in the wine by 1 to 3 g/L and an increase in pH by 0.3 units. Malic acid is present in the grape throughout the growing season, reaching its peak at &quot;veraison&quot; and gradually decreasing throughout the ripening process. Grapes harvested from cooler climates usually have the highest malic content and have the most dramatic changes in TA and pH levels after malolactic fermentation.
Malolactic fermentation can aid in making a wine &quot;microbiologically stable&quot; in that the lactic acid bacteria consume many of the leftover nutrients that other spoilage microbes could use to develop wine faults. However, it can also make the wine slightly &quot;unstable&quot; due to the rise in pH, especially if the wine already was at the high end of wine pH. It is not unusual for wines to be &quot;deacidified&quot; by malolactic fermentation only to have the winemaker later add acidity (usually in the form of tartaric acid) to lower the pH to more stable levels.

===Conversion of malic into lactic===
Lactic acid bacteria convert malic acid into lactic acid as an indirect means of creating energy for the bacteria by chemiosmosis which uses the difference in pH gradient between inside the cell and outside in the wine to produce ATP. One model on how this is accomplished notes that the form of L-malate most present at the low pH of wine is its negatively charged monoanionic form. When the bacteria move this anion from the wine into higher pH level of its cellular plasma membrane, it causes a net-negative charge that creates electrical potential. The decarboxylation of malate into L-lactic acid releases not only carbon dioxide but also consumes a proton, which generates the pH gradient which can produce ATP.

Lactic acid bacteria convert L-malic acid found naturally in wine grapes. Most commercial malic acid additives are a mixture of the enantiomers D+ and L-malic acid.

===Sensory influences===

Many different studies have been conducted on the sensory changes that occur in wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation. The most common descriptor is that acidity in the wine feels &quot;softer&quot; due to the change of the &quot;harsher&quot; malic acid to the softer lactic acid. The perception of sourness comes from the titratable acidity in the wine, so the reduction in TA that follows MLF leads to a reduction in perceived sour or &quot;tartness&quot; in the wine.

The change in mouthfeel is related to the increase in pH, but may also be due to the production of polyols, particularly the sugar alcohols erythritol and glycerol. Another factor that may enhance the mouthfeel of wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation is the presence of ethyl lactate which can be as high as 110 mg/L after MLF.

The potential influence on the aroma of the wine is more complex and difficult to predict with different strains of &quot;Oenococcus oeni&quot; (the bacterium most commonly used in MLF) having the potential to create different aroma compounds. In Chardonnay, wines that have gone through MLF are often described as having &quot;hazelnut&quot; and &quot;dried fruit&quot; notes, as well as the aroma of freshly baked bread. In red wines, some strains metabolize the amino acid methionine into a derivative of propionic acid that tends to produce roasted aroma and chocolate notes. Red wines that go through malolactic fermentation in the barrel can have enhanced spice or smoke aromas.

However, some studies have also shown that malolactic fermentation may diminish primary fruit aromas such as Pinot noir, often losing raspberry and strawberry notes after MLF. Additionally, red wines may endure a loss of color after MLF due to pH changes that causes a shift in the equilibrium of the anthocyanins which contribute to the stability of color in wine.

==Lactic acid bacteria==

All lactic acid bacteria (LAB) involved in winemaking, whether as a positive contributor or as a source for potential faults, have the ability to produce lactic acid through the metabolism of a sugar source, as well as the metabolism of L-malic acid. Species differ in how they metabolise the available sugars in wine (both glucose and fructose, as well as the unfermentable pentoses that wine yeasts do not consume). Some bacteria species use the sugars through a homofermentative pathway, meaning only one main end product (usually lactate) is produced, while others use heterofermentative pathways that can create multiple end products such as carbon dioxide, ethanol, and acetate. While only the L-isomer of lactate is produced by LAB in the conversion of malic acid, both hetero- and homofermenters can produce D-, L- and DL-isomers of lactic from glucose which may contribute to slightly different sensory properties in the wine.

While &quot;O. oeni&quot; is often the LAB most desired by winemakers to complete malolactic fermentation, the process is most often carried out by a variety of LAB species that dominate the must at different points during fermentations. Several factors influence which species will be dominant, including fermentation temperature, nutritional resources, the presence of sulfur dioxide, interaction with yeast and other bacteria, pH, and alcohol levels (&quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species, for example, tend to prefer higher pH and can tolerate higher alcohol levels than &quot;O. oeni&quot;), as well as initial inoculation (such as &quot;wild&quot; ferments versus an inoculation of cultured &quot;O. oeni&quot;).

===&quot;Oenococcus&quot;===

The genus &quot;Oenococcus&quot; has one main member involved in winemaking, &quot;O. oeni&quot;, once known as &quot;Leuconostoc oeni&quot;. Despite having the name &quot;Oenococcus&quot;, under the microscope, the bacterium has a bacillus (shape) rod shape. The bacteria is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe that can utilize some oxygen for aerobic respiration but usually produces cellular energy through fermentation. &quot;O. oeni&quot; is a heterofermenter that creates multiple end products from the use of glucose with D-lactic acid and carbon dioxide being produced in roughly equal amounts to either ethanol or acetate. In reductive conditions (such as near the end of alcoholic fermentation), the third end product is usually ethanol while in slightly oxidative (such as early in alcohol fermentation or in an untopped barrel), the bacteria are more likely to produce acetate.

Some &quot;O. oeni&quot; strains can use fructose to create mannitol (which can lead to wine fault known as mannitol taint), while many other strains can break down the amino acid arginine (which can be present in the wine that is resting on the lees after fermentation from the autolysis of dead yeast cells) into ammonia.

In addition to the hexose glucose and fructose sugars, most strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot; can use the residual pentose sugars left behind from yeast fermentation including L-arabinose and ribose. Only around 45% of &quot;O. oeni&quot; strains can ferment sucrose (the form of sugar usually added for chaptalization that gets converted by yeast into glucose and fructose).

Winemakers tend to prefer &quot;O. oeni&quot; for several reasons. First, the species is compatible with the main wine yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, though in cases where both MLF and alcoholic fermentation are started together, the yeast most often outcompetes the bacterium for nutritional resources which may cause a delay in the onset of malolactic fermentation. Second, most strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot; are tolerant to the low pH levels of wine and can usually deal with the standard alcohol levels that most wines reach by the end of fermentation. Additionally, while sulfur dioxide levels above 0.8 molecular SO2 (pH dependent but roughly 35-50 ppm) will inhibit the bacteria, &quot;O. oeni&quot; is relatively resistant compared to other LAB. Finally, &quot;O. oeni&quot; tends to produce the least amount of biogenic amines (and most lactic acid) among the lactic acid bacteria encountered in winemaking.

===&quot;Lactobacillus&quot;===

Within the genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; are both heterofermentative and homofermentative species. All lactobacilli involved in winemaking are Gram-positive and microaerophilic, with most species lacking the enzyme catalase needed to protect themselves from oxidative stress.

Species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; that have been isolated from wine and grape must samples across the globe include &quot;L. brevis, L. buchneri, L. casei, L. curvatus&quot;, &quot;L. delbrueckii&quot; subsp. &quot;lactis&quot;, &quot;L. diolivorans, L. fermentum, L. fructivorans, L. hilgardii, L. jensenii, L. kunkeei, L. leichmannii, L. nagelii, L. paracasei, L. plantarum&quot;, and &quot;L. yamanashiensis&quot;.

Most &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; species are undesirable in winemaking with the potential of producing high levels of volatile acidity, off odors, wine haze, gassiness, and sediment that can be deposited in the bottle, especially if the wine had not been filtered. These bacteria also have the potential to create excessive amounts of lactic acid which can further influence the flavor and sensory perception of the wine. Some species, such as the so-called &quot;ferocious &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;&quot;, have been implicated in causing sluggish or stuck fermentations, while other species, such as &quot;L. fructivorans&quot;, have been known to create a cottony mycelium-like growth on the surface of wines, nicknamed &quot;Fresno mold&quot; after the wine region where it was discovered.

===&quot;Pediococcus&quot;===

So far, four species from the genus &quot;Pediococcus&quot; have been isolated in wines and grape must, &quot;P. inopinatus, P. pentosaceus, P. parvulus&quot;, and &quot;P. damnosus&quot;, with the last two being the species most commonly found in wine. All &quot;Pediococcus&quot; species are Gram-positive with some species being micro-aerophilic while others utilizing mostly aerobic respiration. Under the microscope, &quot;Pediococcus&quot; often appear in pairs of pairs or tetrads which can make them identifiable. Pediococci are homofermenters, metabolizing glucose into a racemic mixture of both L- and D-lactate by glycolysis. However, in the absence of glucose, some species, such as &quot;P. pentosaceus&quot;, begin using glycerol, degrading it into pyruvate which later can be converted to diacetyl, acetate, 2,3-butanediol and other compounds that can impart unfavorable characteristics to the wine.

Most &quot;Pediococcus&quot; species are undesirable in winemaking due to the high levels of diacetyl that can be produced, as well as increased production of biogenic amines that has been implicated as one potential cause for red wine headaches. Many species of &quot;Pediococcus&quot; also have the potential to introduce off odors or other wine faults to the wine such as the bitter-tasting &quot;acrolein taint&quot; that comes from degradation of glycerol into acrolein which then reacts with phenolic compounds in the wine to produce a bitter-tasting compound.

One species, &quot;P. parvulus&quot;, has been found in wines that have not gone through MLF (meaning malic acid is still present in the wine), but has still had its bouquet altered in a way that enologist have described as &quot;not spoiled&quot; or flaw. Other studies have isolated &quot;P. parvulus&quot; from wines that have gone through malolactic fermentation without the development of off odors or wine faults.

===Nutritional requirements===

Lactic acid bacteria are fastidious organisms that cannot synthesize on their own all of their complex nutritional requirements. For LAB to grow and complete malolactic fermentation, the constitution of the wine medium must provide for their nutritional needs. Like wine yeast, LAB require a carbon source for energy metabolism (usually sugar and malic acid), nitrogen source (such as amino acids and purines) for protein synthesis, and various vitamins (such as niacin, riboflavin, and thiamine) and minerals to assist in the synthesis of enzymes and other cellular components.

The source for these nutrients is often found in the grape must itself, though MLF inoculations that run concurrent with alcoholic fermentation risk the yeast outcompeting the bacteria for these nutrients. Towards the end of fermentation, while most of the original grape must resources have been consumed, the lysis of dead yeast cells (the &quot;lees&quot;) can be a source for some nutrients, particularly amino acids. Plus, even &quot;dry&quot; wines that have been fermented to dryness still have unfermentable pentose sugars (such as arabinose, ribose and xylose) left behind that can be used by both positive and spoilage bacteria. As with wine yeast, manufacturers of cultured LAB inoculum usually offer specially prepared nutritional additives that be used as a supplement. However, unlike wine yeast, lactic acid bacteria can not use the supplement diammonium phosphate as a nitrogen source.

Before the introduction of complex nutritional supplements and advances in freeze-dried cultures of LAB, winemakers would cultivate their inoculum of lactic acid bacteria from culture slants provided by laboratories. In the 1960s, these winemakers found it easier to create starter cultures in media that contained apple or tomato juice. This &quot;tomato juice factor&quot; was discovered to be a derivative of pantothenic acid, an important growth factor for the bacteria.

As with yeast, oxygen can be considered a nutrient for LAB, but only in very small amount and only for microaerophilic species such as &quot;O. oeni&quot;. However, no evidence exists currently to suggest that malolactic fermentation runs more smoothly in aerobic conditions than in complete anaerobic conditions, and in fact, excessive amounts of oxygen can retard growth of LAB by favoring conditions of competing microbes (such as &quot;Acetobacter&quot;).

===Native LAB species in the vineyard and the winery===

&quot;Oenococcus oeni&quot;, the LAB species most often desired by winemakers to carry out malolactic fermentation, can be found in the vineyard, but often at very low levels. While moldy, damaged fruit has the potential to carry a diverse flora of microbes, the LAB most often found on clean, healthy grapes after harvest are species from the &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot; genera. After crushing, microbiologists usually find populations under 103 colony forming units/mL containing a mix of &quot; P. damnosus, L. casei, L. hilgardii,&quot; and &quot; L. plantarum&quot;, as well as &quot;O. oeni&quot;. For musts that do not receive an early dose of sulfur dioxide to &quot;knock back&quot; these wild populations of LAB, this flora of bacteria compete with each other (and the wine yeasts) for nutrients early in fermentation.

In the winery, multiple contact points can be home to native population of LAB including oak barrels, pumps, hoses, and bottling lines. For wines where malolactic fermentation is undesirable (such as fruity white wines), the lack of proper sanitation of wine equipment can lead to the development of unwanted MLF and result in wine faults. In cases of oak barrels where full and complete sanitation is almost impossible, wineries often mark barrels that have contained wines going through MLF and keep them isolated from &quot;clean&quot; or brand new barrels that they can use for wines that are not destined to go through MLF.

===&quot;Schizosaccharomyces&quot; yeast===
Several species in the genus &quot;Schizosaccharomyces&quot; use L-malic acid, and enologists have been exploring the potential of using this wine yeast for deacidifying wines instead of the traditional route of malolactic fermentation with bacteria. However, early results with &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot; have shown a tendency of the yeast to produce off odors and unpleasant sensory characteristics in the wine. In recent years, enologists have been experimenting with a mutant strain of &quot;Schizosaccharomyces malidevorans&quot; that has so far been shown to produce less potential wine flaws and off odors.

==Influence of inoculation timing==

Winemakers differ in when they choose to inoculate their must with LAB, with some winemakers pitching the bacteria at the same time as the yeast, allowing both alcoholic and malolactic fermentations to run concurrently, while some wait till the end of fermentation when the wine is racked off its lees and into barrel, and others doing it somewhere between. For practitioners of minimalist or &quot;natural winemaking&quot; who choose not to inoculate with cultured LAB, malolactic fermentation can happen at any time depending on several factors such as the microbiological flora of the winery and the competing influences of these other microbes. All options have potential benefits and disadvantages.

The benefits of inoculating for MLF during alcoholic fermentation include:
*More potential nutrients from the grape must (though the bacteria will be competing with the yeast for these)
*Lower sulfur dioxide and ethanol levels which can otherwise inhibit the LAB
*Higher fermentation temperatures which are more conducive to LAB growth and an earlier completion of MLF: The optimal temperatures for malolactic fermentation are between , while the process is significantly inhibited at temperatures below . Wine stored in the barrels in the cellar during the winter following fermentation will often have a very prolonged malolactic fermentation due to the cool cellar temperatures.
*Early completion of malolactic fermentation means the winemaker can make a postfermentation SO2 earlier to protect the wine from oxidation and spoilage microbes (such as &quot;Acetobacter&quot;). Since sulfur dioxide can inhibit MLF, delaying LAB inoculation till after alcoholic fermentation may mean a delay in sulfur addition till early spring when cellar temperatures warm up enough to encourage the completion of MLF.
*Less diacetyl production
The disadvantages for early inoculation include:
*Wine yeast and LAB competing for resources (including glucose) and potential antagonism between the microbes
*Heterofermenters such as &quot;O. oeni&quot; metabolizing the glucose still present in the must and potentially creating undesirable byproducts such as acetic acid

Many of the advantages for postalcoholic fermentation answer the disadvantages of early inoculation (namely less antagonism and potential for undesirable byproducts). Also, the advantage is seen of the lees being a nutrient source through the autolysis of the dead yeast cells, though that nutrient source may not always be enough to ensure MLF runs successfully to completion. Conversely, many of the disadvantages of late inoculation are the absence of the advantages that come from early inoculation (higher temperatures, potentially quicker completion, etc.).

==Preventing MLF==

For some wine styles, such as light, fruity wines or for low-acid wines from warm climates, malolactic fermentation is not desired. Winemakers can take several steps to prevent MLF from taking place, including:

*Limited maceration, early pressing, and early racking to limit contact time of the LAB with potential nutrient sources
*Maintain sulfur dioxide levels to at least 25 ppm of &quot;free&quot; (unbound) SO2, depending on the pH of the wine, this may mean an addition of 50–100 mg/L of SO2
*Maintain pH levels below 3.3 
*Keep the wine cool at temperatures between 10 and 14 °C (50. 0 to 57.2 °F)
*Filter the wine at bottling with at least a 0.45-micron membrane filter to prevent any bacteria from making it into the bottle

In addition, winemakers can use chemical and biological inhibitors such as lysozyme, nisin, dimethyl dicarbonate (Velcorin), and fumaric acid, though some (like Verlcorin) are restricted in winemaking countries outside the United States. Fining agents, such as bentonite, and putting the wine through cold stabilization will also remove potential nutrients for LAB, thus inhibiting malolactic fermentation. Some experimentation with the use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) has been conducted to limit malolactic fermentations, but disappointing results in the cheesemaking industry have led to skepticism about the practical use of bacteriophages in winemaking.

==Measuring malic content==

Winemakers can track the progression of malolactic fermentation by paper chromatography or with a spectrophotometer. The paper chromatography method involves using capillary tubes to add small samples of the wine to chromatograph paper. The paper is then rolled and placed in a jar filled with a butanol solution containing bromocresol green indicator dye for several hours. After the paper is pulled out and dried, the distance of yellow-colored &quot;splotches&quot; from the base line denotes the presence of various acids, with tartaric being closest to the baseline followed by citric, malic, and finally lactic acids near the top of the paper.

A significant limitation to paper chromatography is that it will not show exactly how much malic is still remaining in the wine, with the size of the &quot;splotch&quot; on the paper having no correlation to a quantitative figure. The sensitivity of the paper is also limited to a detection threshold of 100–200 mg/L while most measurements of &quot;MLF stability&quot; target a malic level of less than 0.03 g/L (30 mg/L).

The enzymatic method allows for a quantitative measurement of both malic and lactic acids, but requires the expense of reagent kits and a spectrophotometer that can measure absorbance values at 334, 340, or 365 nm.

==Other products produced==
The main products of malolactic fermentation are lactic acid, diacetyl, acetic acid, acetoin, and various esters. The amount and exact nature of these products depends on the species/strain of LAB conducting the malolactic fermentation and the condition influencing that wine (pH, available nutrients, oxygen levels, etc.).

Some strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot; can synthesize higher alcohols which can contribute to fruity notes in the aroma of the wine. Additionally, some strains of the bacterium have beta-glucosidase enzymes that can break down monoglucosides which are aroma compounds attached to a sugar molecule. When the sugar component is cleaved, the rest of the compound becomes volatilized, meaning it can potentially be detected in the aroma bouquet of the wine.

In the early 21st century, some strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot; were shown to use acetaldehyde by breaking it down into ethanol or acetic acid. While this may help for wines with excessive levels of acetaldehyde, for red wines, it can also destabilize the color of the wine by interfering with acetaldehyde&#x27;s reaction with anthocyanins to create polymeric pigments that help create a wine&#x27;s color.

===Diacetyl===
Diacetyl (or 2,3-butanedione) is the compound associated with the &quot;buttery&quot; aromas of Chardonnays, but it can affect any wine that has gone through malolactic fermentation. At an odor detection threshold of 0.2 mg/L in white wines and 2.8 mg/L in red wines, it can be perceived as slightly buttery or &quot;nutty&quot; while at concentrations greater than 5 to 7 mg/L (5-7 ppm) can overwhelm other aroma notes in the wine.

Diacetyl can be produced by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, it is in a very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot; producing less diacetyl than &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcis&quot; species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and butylene glycol.

Diacetyl production is favored in fermentations that run warm with temperatures between . It also tends to be produced at higher levels in wines with lower pH levels (under 3.5), though at levels below 3.2, most strains of LAB desirable for MLF tend to be inhibited. &quot;Wild&quot; (as in uninoculated) malolactic ferments have the potential to produce more diacetyl than inoculated ferments due to the lower initial populations during the lag phase with inoculated ferments usually having an initial inoculum of 106 CFU/mL. Late MLF inoculations, after alcoholic fermentation, also tend to produce higher levels of diacetyl. Chardonnay producers desiring to make the high-diacetyl &quot;buttery style&quot; will often do late or &quot;wild&quot; inoculation in the barrel after primary fermentation, allowing the wine to spend several weeks or even months &quot;sur lie&quot; in reductive conditions that promote diacetyl production. Some sources point out that diacetyl is actually decreased by sur lie, due to surviving yeast metabolizing diacetyl, and therefore malolactic fermentation is best performed apart from lees.

With wines that have excessive levels of diacetyl, some winemakers use sulfur dioxide to bind with the compound and reduce the perception of diacetyl by 30 to 60%. This binding is a reversible process and after only a few weeks aging in the bottle or tank, the high levels of diacetyl return. However, sulfur dioxide added earlier in the malolactic fermentation process limits diacetyl production by inhibiting the bacteria and limiting their activity in its entirety, including the conversion of malic to lactic acid.

==Wine faults==

The most common fault associated with malolactic fermentation is its occurrence when it is not desired. This could be for a wine that is meant to be acidic and fruity (such as Riesling) or it could be a wine that was previously thought to have gone through MLF and bottled only to have malolactic fermentation commence in the bottle. The outcome of this &quot;in-bottle&quot; fermentation is often gassy, hazy wine that can be unpalatable to consumers. Improvement in sanitation and control of lactic acid bacteria in the winery can limit the occurrence of these faults.

For early Vinho Verde producers, the slight effervesce that came from in-bottle malolactic fermentation was considered a distinguishing trait that consumers enjoyed in the wine. However, wineries had to market the wine in opaque bottles to mask the turbidity and sediment that the &quot;in-bottle MLF&quot; produced. Today, most Vinho Verde producers no longer follow this practice and instead complete malolactic fermentation prior to bottle with the slight sparkle being added by artificial carbonation.

While not necessarily a fault, malolactic fermentation does have the potential of making a wine &quot;protein unstable&quot; due to the resulting change in pH which affects the solubility of proteins in wine. For this reason, protein fining and heat stability tests on wine usually take place after malolactic fermentation has run to completion.

===Volatile acidity===
While volatile acidity (VA) is usually measured in terms of acetic acid content, its sensory perception is a combination of acetic (vinegary aromas) and ethyl acetate (nail polish remover and model airplane glue aromas). High levels of VA can inhibit wine yeast and may lead to a sluggish or stuck fermentation. Several microbes can be a source for VA, including &quot;Acetobacter&quot;, &quot;Brettanomyces&quot;, and film yeast such as &quot;Candida&quot;, as well as LAB. However, while LAB usually only produce acetic acid, these other microbes often produce ethyl acetate, as well as acetic acid.

Most wine-producing countries have laws regulating the amount volatile acidity permitted for wine available for sale and consumption. In the United States, the legal limit is 0.9 g/L for foreign wine exported to the United States, 1.2 g/L for white table wine, 1.4 g/L for red wine, 1.5 g/L for white dessert wine, and 1.7 g/L for red dessert wine. European Union wine regulations limit VA to 1.08 g/L for white table wines and 1.20 g/L for red table wines.

Heterofermenting species of &quot;Oenococcus&quot; and &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; have the potential to produce high levels of acetic acid through the metabolism of glucose, though with most strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot;, the amount is usually only 0.1 to 0.2 g/L. Several species of &quot;Pediococcus&quot; can also produce acetic acid through other pathways. Wines starting out with a high pH levels (above 3.5) stand the greatest risk of excessive acetic acid production due to the more favorable conditions for &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot; species. &quot;L. Kunkeei&quot;, one of the so-called &quot;ferocious &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;&quot; species, has been known to produce 3 to 5 g/L of acetic acid in wines—levels which can easily lead to stuck fermentations.

===&quot;Ferocious&quot; &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;===
In the late 20th century, among American winemakers, seemingly healthy fermentation were reported becoming rapidly inundated with high levels of acetic acid that overcame wine yeasts and led to stuck fermentations. While a novel species of &quot;Acetobacter&quot; or wine spoilage yeast was initially thought to be the culprit, it was eventually discovered to be several species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, &quot;L. kunkeei&quot;, &quot;L. nagelii&quot;, and &quot;L. hilgardii&quot;, collectively nicknamed &quot;ferocious&quot; &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; for their aggressive acetic acid production, how quickly they multiply, and their high tolerance to sulfur dioxides and other microbiological controls.

Ferments of high-pH wines (greater than 3.5) that spent time cold soaking prior to yeast inoculations and received little to no sulfur dioxide during crushing seem to be at the most risk for &quot;ferocious&quot; &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;. While infection seems to be vineyard-specific, currently, none of any of the implicated lactobacilli has been reported as being found on the surface of freshly harvested wine grapes.

===Acrolein and mannitol taint===

The degradation of glycerol by some strains of LAB can yield the compound acrolein. Glycerol is a sweet-tasting polyol present in all wines, but at higher levels in wines that have been infected with &quot;Botrytis cinerea&quot;. An &quot;active-aldehyde&quot;, acrolein can interact with some phenolic compounds in wine to create highly bitter-tasting wines, described as &quot;amertume&quot; by Pasteur. While at least one strain of &quot;O. oeni&quot; has been shown to produce acrolein, it is more commonly found in wines that have been infected by strains of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot; species such as &quot;L. brevis, L. buchneri&quot;, and &quot;P. parvulus&quot;. Acrolein taint has also shown to be more common in wines that have been fermented at high temperatures and/or made from grapes that have been harvested at high Brix levels.

Heterofermenting species from the genus &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, as well as some wild strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot;, have the potential to metabolize fructose (one of the main sugars in wine) into the sugar alcohols mannitol and (less commonly) erythritol. These are sweet-tasting compounds can add sweetness to a wine where it is not desired (such as Cabernet Sauvignon). Mannitol taint, described as &quot;mannite&quot; by Pasteur, in wines is often accompanied by other wine faults, including the presence of excessive levels of acetic acid, diacetyl, lactic acid, and 2-butanol, which can contribute to a &quot;vinegary-estery&quot; aroma. The wine may also have a slimy sheen on the surface.

===Fresno mold and ropiness===
In the mid-20th century, a cottony mycelium-like growth began appearing in the bottles of some sweet fortified wines produced in California&#x27;s Central Valley. Being fortified, these wines often had alcohol levels in excess of 20% which is usually a level that discourages growth of most spoilage organisms associated with winemaking. Nicknamed &quot;Fresno mold&quot; due to where it was first discovered, the culprit of this growth was determined to be &quot;L. fructivorans&quot;, a species which can be controlled by sanitation and maintaining adequate sulfur dioxide levels.

Some &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot; species (particularly &quot;P. damnosus&quot; and &quot;P. pentosaceus&quot;) have the potential to synthesize polysaccharides that add an oily viscosity to the wine. In the case of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;, some of these saccharides may be glucans that can be synthesized from glucose present in the wine as low as 50–100 mg/L (0.005 to 0.01% residual sugar) and afflict seemingly &quot;dry&quot; wines. While &quot;ropiness&quot; can occur in the barrel or tank, it is often observed in the wines several months after they are bottled. Wines with pH levels above 3.5 and low sulfur dioxide levels are at most risk for developing this fault.

Called &quot;graisse&quot; (or &quot;grease&quot;) by the French and &quot;les vins filant&quot; by Pasteur, this fault has been observed in apple wines and cider. It can also be potentially be caused by other spoilage microbes such as &quot;Streptococcus mucilaginous&quot;, &quot;Candida krusei&quot;, and &quot;Acetobacter rancens&quot;.

===Mousiness and geranium taint===
Wines infected with &quot;L. brevis, L. hilgardii&quot;, and &quot;L. fermentum&quot; have been known to occasionally develop an aroma reminiscent of rodent droppings. The aroma becomes more pronounced when the wine is rubbed between the fingers and, if consumed, can leave a long, unpleasant finish. The aroma can be very potent, detectable at a sensory threshold as low as 1.6 parts per billion (μg/l). The exact compound behind this is derivatives of the amino acid lysine created through an oxidation reaction with ethanol. While undesirable LAB species have been most commonly associated with this fault, wine infected by &quot;Brettanomyces&quot; yeast in the presence of ammonium phosphate and lysine have also been known to exhibit this fault.

Sorbate is often used as a yeast-inhibitor by home winemakers to stop alcoholic fermentation in the production of sweet wines. Most species of lactic acid bacteria can synthesize sorbate to produce 2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene which has the aroma of crushed geranium leaves.

===Tourne===
Compared to malic and citric acids, tartaric acid is usually considered microbiologically stable. However, some species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; (particularly &quot;L. brevis&quot; and &quot;L. plantarum&quot;) have the potential to degrade tartaric acid in wine, reducing a wine&#x27;s total acidity by 3-50%. French winemakers had long observed this phenomenon and called it &quot;tourne&quot; (meaning &quot;turn to brown&quot;) in reference to the color change that can occur in the wine at the same time likely due to other processes at work in addition to the tartaric loss. While &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; is the most common culprit of &quot;tourne&quot;, some species of the spoilage film yeast &quot;Candida&quot; can also metabolize tartaric acid.

===Health-related faults===
While the presence of ethyl carbamate is not a sensory wine fault, the compound is a suspected carcinogen which is subjected to regulation in many countries. The compound is produced from the degradation of the amino acid arginine which is present in both grape must and released in the wine through the autolysis of dead yeast cells. While the use of urea as a source of yeast assimilable nitrogen (no longer legal in most countries) was the most common cause of ethyl carbamate in wine, both &quot;O. oeni&quot; and &quot;L. buchneri&quot; have been known to produce carbamyl phosphate and citrulline which can be precursors to ethyl carbamate formation. &quot;L. hilgardii&quot;, one of the &quot;ferocious &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;&quot; species, has also been suspected of contributing to ethyl carbamate production. In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has established a voluntary target limit of ethyl carbamate in wine to less than 15 μg/L for table wines and less than 60 μg/L for dessert wines.

Biogenic amines have been implicated as a potential cause of red wine headaches. In wine, histamine, cadaverine, phenylethylamine, putrescine, and tyramine have all been detected. These amines are created by the degradation of amino acids found in grape must and left over from the breakdown of dead yeast cells after fermentation. Most LAB have the potential to create biogenic amines, even some strains of &quot;O. oeni&quot;, but high levels of biogenic amines are most often associated with species from the &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; and &quot;Pediococcus&quot; genera. In the European Union, the concentration of biogenic amines in wine is beginning to be monitored, while the United States currently does not have any regulations.

<doc id="1045028" wikidata="Q5528620" url="?curid=1045028" title="Gay Nineties">
<text>The Gay Nineties is an American nostalgic term and a periodization of the history of the United States referring to the decade of the 1890s. It is known in the United Kingdom as the Naughty Nineties, and refers there to the decade of supposedly decadent art of Aubrey Beardsley, the witty plays and trial of Oscar Wilde, society scandals and the beginning of the suffragette movement.

Despite the term, part of the decade was marked by an economic crisis, which greatly worsened when the Panic of 1893 set off a widespread economic depression in the United States that lasted until 1897.

==Etymology==
The term Gay Nineties began to be used in the 1920s in the United States, and it is believed to have been created by the artist Richard V. Culter, who first released a series of drawings in &quot;Life&quot; magazine titled &quot;the Gay Nineties&quot; and later published a book of drawings with the same name.

==History==
Novels by authors like Edith Wharton and Booth Tarkington documented the high life of the &quot;old money&quot; families. By the 1920s, the decade was nostalgically seen as a period of pre-income tax wealth for a newly emergent &quot;society set&quot;. The railroads, the agricultural depression of the Southern United States, and the dominance of the United States in South American markets and the Caribbean meant that industrialists of the Northern United States seemed to have been doing very well.

It was also the name of a nostalgic radio program in the 1930s, hosted by a prominent composer of popular songs of the 1890s, Joe Howard, as well as an 1890s-themed New York cafe, &quot;Bill&#x27;s Gay Nineties&quot;, during that same period. From the 1920s to the 1960s, filmmakers had a nostalgic interest in the 1890s as seen in the films &quot;The Naughty Nineties&quot;, &quot;She Done Him Wrong&quot;, &quot;Belle of the Nineties&quot;, &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot;, &quot;My Gal Sal&quot;, &quot;The Nifty Nineties&quot; (a Mickey Mouse cartoon)&quot;,&quot; &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot;, &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, and &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;.

Roger Edens&#x27; song &quot;The Gay Nineties&quot; opens a production number spoofing period melodramas in &quot;Strike Up the Band&quot;, a 1940 MGM film starring Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney.

<text>The Forgotten is a 2004 American science fiction psychological thriller written by Gerald Di Pego, and directed by Joseph Ruben. Starring Julianne Moore, Dominic West, Gary Sinise, Alfre Woodard, Linus Roache, and Anthony Edwards.

The film&#x27;s plot revolves around a woman who lost her nine-year-old son in a plane crash 14 months earlier, only to have her husband and psychiatrist explain she is suffering from unreliable fantasies after a miscarriage. She sets out in search for solid evidence of her son&#x27;s existence.

&quot;The Forgotten&quot; was produced by Revolution Studios for Columbia Pictures and was released in the United States and Canada on September 24, 2004. Critical reviews were mixed to negative, but the film was a financial success.

==Plot==

Telly Paretta grieves the loss of her son Sam, who died 14 months prior in a plane crash. She holds regular vigils in his undisturbed bedroom, visits his grave, and meets with a therapist to deal with her grief, though her husband, Jim, wants to move on.

Returning from work one afternoon, Telly finds that her photo album of Sam no longer contains his photos. Furious, she confronts Jim for trying to forget, but her husband shocks her with a counter accusation: That she is, in actuality, delusional and that they have never had a son.

Hurt, Telly begins reaching out to acquaintances to confirm Sam&#x27;s existence; however, her friend Eliot doesn&#x27;t appear to believe in Sam&#x27;s existence despite her closeness to him. Looking for concrete evidence, Dr. Munce, her therapist, meets with her and Jim. She is told that she was pregnant, but that she miscarried and &quot;Sam&quot; is her delusional fantasy about how her life would have been different if he had lived. He recommends that she be sent to a hospital, but she runs away.

Fleeing and still adamant that Sam is real, she locates her neighbor Ash, whose daughter Lauren was Sam&#x27;s friend and died in the same crash. She finds Lauren&#x27;s drawings underneath wallpaper in Ash&#x27;s apartment, and tries to convince him they were made by his daughter. However, he claims he never had a daughter and calls the police. Shaken by Telly&#x27;s certainty, Ash looks again at the drawings and remembers his daughter.

Chasing after Telly, he rescues her from the police and they go into hiding, pursued by NSA agents. On the run, they speculate about who would have the power, resources, and motive to want to make them forget about their children.

Telly and Ash capture and threaten a pursuing agent, who reluctantly reveals that he and other agents are merely helping &quot;them&quot; in order to protect humankind. Without warning, the roof of the house blows off and the agent, along with the roof, is sucked into the sky—presumably taken by &quot;them&quot;—and Telly and Ash flee.

Eventually, Telly visits Dr. Munce again and he reveals that the disappearances are the work of &quot;them&quot;, and that the government monitors their trials, all too aware that they have no power to stop &quot;them&quot; from doing whatever they want.

Munce takes Telly to an airport and the dilapidated hangar of Quest Airlines, where he introduces her to an agent of &quot;them&quot;. He tells the agent that it is over and to stop the experiment, because it will only cause more harm. But the agent replies that it is not over. He reveals to Telly that she has been a part of an experiment to test whether the bonds between mother and child can be diminished. In her case, her memories could not be fully erased.

Telly refuses to deny her son&#x27;s existence. The agent mentions that if he fails to erase her memory then he will look like a failure. The agent then subdues her and convinces her to think of the first memory she had of Sam. Telly thinks of the day he was born in the hospital, which allows the agent to successfully erase Sam&#x27;s memory from existence.

As the agent is walking away thinking he has succeeded, Telly&#x27;s motherly bond kicks in deeper to the time she was pregnant with Sam, triggering her memory that she indeed had life in her at one time. All of her memories of Sam return. Before the agent can comprehend what&#x27;s happening, part of the hangar roof is suddenly blown off, and he is yanked into the sky himself for his failure to erase her memory. This ends the experiment.

Telly finds herself living a normal life, with memories of everything that has happened. She reunites with Sam at a park. Also at the park is Ash, watching over his daughter. Like Sam, she has no memory of what has happened. Telly reintroduces herself, and the two sit and watch the kids play in the playground.

<text>Marc Reisner (September 14, 1948 – July 21, 2000) was an American environmentalist and writer best known for his book &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;, a history of water management in the American West.

==Early life==
He was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of a lawyer and a scriptwriter, and graduated from Earlham College in 1970.

==Career==
For a time he was on the staffs of Environmental Action and the Population Institute in Washington, D.C. Starting in 1972, he worked for seven years as a staff writer and director of communications for the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York.

==Writings and television work==
In 1979 he received an Alicia Patterson Journalism Fellowship, which enabled him to conduct research and write &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot;, which was first published in 1986. According to The Guardian, &quot;Cadillac Desert&quot; illuminated the importance of water conservation in the American West with &quot;the remarkable ability to explain entertainingly the complex, and often numbing, deals and disputes in the &#x27;water wars&#x27; that have plagued the west.&quot; The book was a finalist for both the National Book Critics&#x27; Circle Award and the Bay Area Book Reviewers&#x27; Award (BABRA) that same year. In 1999, a Modern Library panel of authors and critics ranked it 61st on a list of the 100 most notable English-language works of nonfiction of the 20th century. It was later made into a documentary film series that premiered nationwide on PBS nationwide in 1997 and won a Columbia University/Peabody Award.

He went on to write additional books and helped develop a 1997 PBS documentary on water management that emphasized human endeavor in the building of dams. He was featured as an interviewee in Stephen Ives&#x27;s 1996 PBS documentary series &quot;The West&quot;, which was produced by Ken Burns.

In 1997 he published a discussion paper for the American Farmland Trust on water policy and farmland protection.

==Dam removal==
Shortly before he died, he had won a Pew Charitable Trusts Fellowship to support efforts to restore Pacific salmon habitat through dam removal.

==Sustainability==
Reisner was also involved in efforts to promote sustainable agronomy and green entrepreneurship. In 1990, in partnership with the Nature Conservancy, he co-founded the Ricelands Habitat Partnership, an innovative program designed to enhance waterfowl habitat on California farmlands and reduce pollution by flooding rice fields in winter instead of burning the rice straw, as was then the common practice. He also joined in efforts to help California rice farmers develop eco-friendly products from compressed rice straw, and a separate project to promote water conservation through water transfers and groundwater banking.

==Teaching==
For a time, Reisner was a distinguished visiting professor at the University of California at Davis, lecturing on the relationship between urbanization and environmental concerns.

== Criticism ==
In his later years, Reisner was criticized by environmentalists for his connection to two private companies that went against the values he presented in his books: one stored water underground for profit, and the other promoted the use of rice fibers in Western rice paddies. Reisner later stated that he had changed his mind about the latter due to its ability to provide habitat for birds.

==Death==
Reisner died of colon cancer on July 21, 2000, at his home in San Anselmo, California, survived by his wife, biochemist Lawrie Mott, and their two daughters Ruthie and Margot. His final book, &quot;A Dangerous Place&quot;, was completed before his death but did not appear in print until 2003.

==Books==
* &quot;Cadillac Desert: The American West and Its Disappearing Water&quot; (1986, revised 1993). 
* &quot;Overtapped Oasis: Reform or Revolution for Western Water&quot; (with Sarah Bates) (1990). 
* &quot;Game Wars: The Undercover Pursuit of Wildlife Poachers&quot; (1992). 
* &quot;A Dangerous Place: California&#x27;s Unsettling Fate&quot; (2003).

<doc id="1045068" wikidata="Q7262743" url="?curid=1045068" title="Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park">
<text>Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park is a United States National Historical Park located on the west coast of the island of Hawaiʻi in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The historical park preserves the site where, up until the early 19th century, Hawaiians who broke a kapu (one of the ancient laws) could avoid certain death by fleeing to this place of refuge or &quot;puʻuhonua&quot;. The offender would be absolved by a priest and freed to leave. Defeated warriors and non-combatants could also find refuge here during times of battle. The grounds just outside the Great Wall that encloses the puʻuhonua were home to several generations of powerful chiefs.

Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau is one of the only four places in Hawaii where the flag of Hawaii can officially fly alone without the American flag; the other three places are ʻIolani Palace, the Mauna ʻAla and Thomas Square.

== Park name and features ==
The 420 acre (1.7 km2) site was originally established in 1955 as City of Refuge National Historical Park and was renamed on November 10, 1978. In 2000 the name was changed by the &quot;Hawaiian National Park Language Correction Act of 2000&quot; observing the Hawaiian spelling. It includes the puʻuhonua and a complex of archeological sites including: temple platforms, royal fishponds, sledding tracks, and some coastal village sites. The Hale o Keawe temple and several thatched structures have been reconstructed.

== Hale o Keawe heiau ==

Hale o Keawe was an ancient Hawaiian heiau originally built in approximately 1650 AD as the burial site for the ruling monarch (aliʻi nui) of the Island of Hawaii named Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. It was built by his son, a Kona chief named Kanuha. The complex may have been established as early as 1475 under the aliʻi nui ʻEhu-kai-malino. The nobility &quot;(ali&#x27;i)&quot; of Kona continued to be buried until the abolition of the kapu system. The last person buried here was a son of Kamehameha I in 1818.

Radiocarbon dating has not been done extensively in the area. Testing of the nearby &#x27;Āle&#x27;ale&#x27;a heiau site gave deceptive results. Oral traditions compiled by Dorothy Barrère are still considered the best for chronological order of the surrounding complex.

The heiau contained 23 remains including that of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku. It was situated near a great ancient wall near the royal residence to the east side of the wall. Further south were further aliʻi homes were built. Excavations of the area indicate a large crafting community to support the royal residence. The heiau would lay untouched after the banning of the Hawaiian religion while all other such temples were destroyed until Kaahumanu had the building dismantled and all the remains moved to the royal mausoleum in Honolulu.

It was believed that additional protection to the place of refuge was received from the mana in the bones of the chiefs. It survived several years after other temples were destroyed.
It was looted by Lord George Byron (cousin of the distinguished English poet) in 1825.
In 1829, High Chiefess Kapiʻolani removed the remaining bones and hid them in the &quot;Pali Kapu O Keōua&quot; cliffs above nearby Kealakekua Bay. She then ordered this last temple to be destroyed. The bones were later moved to the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii in 1858.

The heiau in the park was reconstructed in the 1960s.

<text>Geoffrey Scott (11 June 1884 – 14 August 1929) was an English scholar and poet, known as a historian of architecture. His biography of Isabelle de Charrière entitled &quot;The Portrait of Zelide&quot; won the 1925 James Tait Black Memorial Prize.

==Background==
Born in Hampstead, Scott was the fourth son of Russell Scott III and his wife Jessie Thurburn. He was educated at Highgate School, then Rugby School and New College, Oxford, where he won the Newdigate Prize in 1906. While still an undergraduate he was befriended by Mary Berenson, leading to his admission to the Florence &#x27;circle&#x27; of Bernard Berenson. From 1907 to 1909 he was employed by Berenson; he worked on the design of the garden of &quot;I Tatti&quot;, the Berenson villa, with Cecil Ross Pinsent. This led to work on other gardens. It also brought him the friendship of John Maynard Keynes, who met him there.

In 1914 the publication of &quot;The Architecture of Humanism&quot; made his reputation. In 1916, he married Lady Sybil Cutting (1879–1943), whose first husband, William Bayard Cutting Jr., died in 1910. Lady Sybil was the youngest daughter of Irish peer and barrister, Hamilton Cuffe, 5th Earl of Desart, who served as the last Lord Lieutenant of Kilkenny, and his wife, Lady Margaret Joan Lascelles, a daughter of Henry Lascelles, 4th Earl of Harewood. She had arrived in Florence when her first husband, terminally ill with tuberculosis, had written he wanted their young daughter, Iris, to grow up in Italy, &quot;free from all this national feeling which makes people so unhappy. Bring her up somewhere where she does not belong.&quot; Lady Sybil and her daughter settled in Florence, Italy; buying the Villa Medici in Fiesole, one of the city&#x27;s most spectacular villas. There she formed a close friendship with Bernard Berenson at the nearby &quot;I Tatti&quot;, and seasonal resident Lady Cecilia Pearse.

The Scotts divorced in 1926, and she remarried (to Percy Lubbock) the same year. With little in the way of career, it has been suggested that an unlikely love affair with Vita Sackville-West from 1923 to 1925 spurred Scott into his later literary production.

At the time of his death, of pneumonia in New York City, Geoffrey Scott had been retained as an editor of the papers of James Boswell.

He was one of Edith Wharton&#x27;s close friends.

<doc id="1045086" wikidata="Q17031402" url="?curid=1045086" title="The Woolwich">
<text>The Woolwich Equitable Building Society (later Woolwich Building Society or The Woolwich) was founded in Woolwich in 1847 and remained a local institution until after WWI when it began a modest regional expansion. This accelerated after WWII and the period from 1960 was notable for its acquisitions. Following deregulation, the Society diversified and became one of the largest national building societies.

In 1997 it demutualised and became Woolwich PLC. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange. It was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but was acquired by Barclays in 2000.

== History ==

===Early history===

The origins of the Woolwich lay in an earlier terminating society, based in the local Castle Inn and chaired by the publican. In 1847 a breakaway group met to form the Woolwich Equitable Benefit Building and Investment Society (later reduced to the Woolwich Equitable Building Society). That the active founders of the new society included the pastor of the Salem Chapel and a Sunday School teacher may indicate the reason for the breakaway. The first meeting was held in the parlour of a “modest house” of Benjamin Wates, a local draper. The Wates family was to play a significant role in the early history of the Woolwich. Samuel Wates, Benjamin’s younger brother, was appointed Secretary in 1848 but following his death in 1851, Benjamin took over until 1862 followed briefly by his son and then by the youngest brother Joseph, who was Secretary and General Manager until 1880. Joseph Wates then became a director, rearing as Chairman in 1901.

A feature of the early years was the Society lending out more than it had money, with funds coming from directors signing promissory notes to the bank. Indeed, support from its bank (the London &amp; County) was to feature on future occasions. Nevertheless, after ten years the Woolwich claimed to be “one of the leading Metropolitan societies” and dominant in its own neighbourhood. This may have been an optimistic claim as the Wolwich was run on a very small scale: the Secretary was obliged to live on the premises until 1876, and in 1863 there were only 500 members. A shock to the town and the Society was the closure of the Woolwich Dockyard in 1869. However, it made the Society look outside its immediate area. In 1872 there was reference to “suitable persons to be appointed as agents in eligible localities” and then to “outlying districts” having proved successful; however, “outlying” still appeared to be relatively local.

Further shocks were to come before the century was out. In 1886, the Woolwich&#x27;s solicitor, also the son of the chairman, disappeared, prompting a run on deposits. The London and County sent funds to support the Society. This was followed by the failure of Jabez Balfour&#x27;s Liberator Building Society in 1892 which caused a crisis of confidence in the whole building society movement and the withdrawal of deposits. Again, the London and County Bank sent funds to bolster reserves. Despite the earlier references to appointing agents in outlying areas, the Society remained small. In 1887, forty years after its formation, the Society’s assets were only £555,000 and it was run by one Secretary and seven clerks. Even by the 60th anniversary in 1907, the assets were little more than £1m.

===Regional expansion begins===

Slowly, the Woolwich was beginning to think of expansion. In 1911, it opened accounts with other banks in anticipation of widening the source of deposits. Although interrupted by World War I in 1917 it decided to appoint special agents in provinces. The first of these was in nearby Chatham, Kent but it was not until the early 1920s that the Woolwich began a programme of branch expansion, slowly at first but then accelerating. A city office was opened in 1923, followed by Croydon in 1924, Ilford in 1925 and Romford in 1927. In 1928, three were opened including Southampton and six in 1929, with branches now in bigger cities, e.g. Bristol, Manchester and Belfast. A further 17 branches were opened in the 1930s, Dundee, Cardiff, and Liverpool indicating the geographical spread. Assets grew from £1.7m in 1919 to around £36m at the onset of the Second World War.

Branch expansion resumed immediately after the War and a regional organization was established in 1946. Three small societies had also been absorbed during the War: the Gosport and Alverstoke; Guildford and District Equitable, and Andover Mutual. However, the corporate history finishes in 1947, at the end of the Woolwich’s centenary, and detail is limited thereafter. Organic growth took assets up to £100m by the mid-1950s.

===The modern era: expansion and diversification===

From 1960, the Woolwich combined opening new branches with a series of acquisitions. Between the acquisition of the Modern Permanent in 1960 and the Town and Country in 1992, some nine societies were absorbed by the Woolwich. Notable among them were the fraudulent Grays and the Gateway, successor to the Temperance Building Society. The Gateway acquisition in 1988 took assets up to £13 billion. By then, financial deregulation encouraged the Woolwich to diversify away from its traditional mortgage business. In 1989, the Woolwich launched its first subsidiary operation, a financial planning service. It also formed Woolwich Property Services and took over part of the estate agency operations of the Prudential Plc in 1991; by the late 1990s, it had a national chain of nearly 170 branch locations. Other ventures included offshore banking, Woolwich Guernsey; Woolwich Life; Woolwich Unit Trust Managers Limited; and Italian and French banking businesses.

===Demutualisation and takeover===

The Woolwich Equitable Building Society demutualised in 1997, giving up its mutual status to become a bank: Woolwich PLC was formed, giving shares to investing and borrowing members of the society, and listing on the London Stock Exchange.

In August 2000, Barclays took over Woolwich PLC in a £5.4bn acquisition. Woolwich PLC thus joined the Barclays Bank Group of companies. The Woolwich brand-name was retained after the acquisition, and the Woolwich head office remained in Bexleyheath, south-east London, 4.5 mi from the original office in Woolwich.

On 28 June 2006, Barclays announced that The Woolwich was to become the Barclays UK mortgage brand, supported by Barclays branches, and that Woolwich branches would be either closed or re-branded as Barclays.

Associated changes to call centres affected up to 1,200 jobs, mostly at The Woolwich contact centre in Clacton-on-Sea, which closed at the end of 2007.

Although the Woolwich name lived on as the brand used for Barclays mortgages, this was discontinued in 2015.

== Headquarters ==
The Woolwich Equitable Building Society started in Powis Street, Woolwich, where it occupied various premises. From 1896 until 1935, it was headquartered at a purpose-built corner office at 111-113 Powis Street, after which it moved to larger premises at Eakes Place, now Equitable House at General Gordon Square. In 1989, it moved to new headquarters in nearby Bexleyheath, alongside the society&#x27;s main administration and computer centre which had been based at the corner of Watling Street and Erith Road for many years. Following the takeover by Barclays, the Bexleyheath head office closed in 2005. In 2014, the Woolwich&#x27;s former head office became the Civic Offices of Bexley London Borough Council.

Equitable House continued as a branch office until 2007. In 2010–11, it was converted into a commercial building by Sundridge Investments, with a pub, a cafe and shops on the ground floor, and the upper floors rented out to Maritime Greenwich College, later South London College.

<text>Ernest William Hornung (7 June 1866 – 22 March 1921) was an English author and poet known for writing the A. J. Raffles series of stories about a gentleman thief in late 19th-century London. Hornung was educated at Uppingham School; as a result of poor health he left the school in December 1883 to travel to Sydney, where he stayed for two years. He drew on his Australian experiences as a background when he began writing, initially short stories and later novels.

In 1898 he wrote &quot;In the Chains of Crime&quot;, which introduced Raffles and his sidekick, Bunny Manders; the characters were based partly on his friends Oscar Wilde and Wilde&#x27;s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, and also on the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, created by his brother-in-law, Arthur Conan Doyle. The series of Raffles short stories were collected for sale in book form in 1899, and two further books of Raffles short stories followed, as well as a poorly received novel. Aside from his Raffles stories, Hornung was a prodigious writer of fiction, publishing numerous books from 1890, with &quot;A Bride from the Bush&quot; to his 1914 novel &quot;The Crime Doctor&quot;.

The First World War brought an end to Hornung&#x27;s fictional output. His son, Oscar, was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres in July 1915. Hornung joined the YMCA, initially in England, then in France, where he helped run a canteen and library. He published two collections of poetry during the war, and then, afterwards, one further volume of verse and an account of his time spent in France, &quot;Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front&quot;. Hornung&#x27;s fragile constitution was further weakened by the stress of his war work. To aid his recuperation, he and his wife visited the south of France in 1921. He fell ill from influenza on the journey, and died on 22 March 1921, aged 54.

Although much of Hornung&#x27;s work has fallen into obscurity, his Raffles stories continued to be popular, and have formed numerous film and television adaptations. Hornung&#x27;s stories dealt with a wider range of themes than crime: he examined scientific and medical developments, guilt, class and the unequal role played by women in society. Two threads that run through a sizeable proportion of his books are Australia and cricket; the latter was also a lifelong passion.

==Biography==

===Early life: 1866–86===

Hornung was born Ernest William Hornung on 7 June 1866 at Cleveland Villas, Middlesbrough; he was nicknamed Willie from an early age. He was the third son, and youngest of eight children, of John Peter Hornung (1821–86) and his wife Harriet Armstrong (1824–96). John was christened Johan Petrus Hornung in the Transylvania region of Hungary and, after working in Hamburg for a shipping firm, had moved to Britain in the 1840s as a coal and iron merchant. John married Harriet in March 1848, by which time he had anglicised his name. At the age of 13 Hornung joined St Ninian&#x27;s Preparatory School in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, before enrolling at Uppingham School in 1880. Hornung was well liked at school, and developed a lifelong love of cricket despite limited skills at the game, which were further worsened by bad eyesight, asthma and, according to his biographer Peter Rowland, a permanent state of generally poor health.

When Hornung was 17 his health worsened; he left Uppingham and travelled to Australia, where it was hoped by his family that the climate would be beneficial. On his arrival he was employed as a tutor to the Parsons family in Mossgiel in the Riverina, south-western New South Wales. In addition to teaching, he spent time working in remote sheep stations in the outback and contributing material to the weekly magazine &quot;The Bulletin&quot;; he also began writing what was to become his first novel. Although he spent only two years in Australia, the experience was &quot;the making of him and ... the making of his career as a writer&quot;, according to Rowland. Another biographer, Mark Valentine, wrote that Hornung &quot;seems to have regarded this period as one of the most satisfying of his life&quot;.

===Return to England: 1886–98===

Hornung returned to England in February 1886, before the death of his father in November. From a position of relative prosperity, John&#x27;s coal and iron business had encountered difficulties and he was in financially straitened circumstances by the time of his death. Hornung found work in London as a journalist and story writer, often publishing his work under a pseudonym, although in 1887 he published his first story under his own name, &quot;Stroke of Five&quot;, which appeared in &quot;Belgravia&quot; magazine. His work as a journalist was during the period of Jack the Ripper and the series of five murders, which were undertaken against a background of rising urban crime in London; it was around this time that Hornung developed an interest in criminal behaviour.

Hornung had worked on the novel manuscript he brought back from Australia and, between July and November 1890, the story, &quot;A Bride from the Bush&quot;, was published in five parts in &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;. It was also released that year as a book—his first. The story—described by Rowland as an &quot;assured, graceful comedy of manners&quot;—used Hornung&#x27;s knowledge of Australia as a backdrop, and the device of an Australian bride to examine British social behaviour; the novel was well received by critics. In 1891 Hornung became a member of two cricket clubs: the Idlers, whose members included Arthur Conan Doyle, Robert Barr and Jerome K. Jerome, and the Strand club.

Hornung knew Doyle&#x27;s sister, Constance (&quot;Connie&quot;) Aimée Monica Doyle (1868–1924), whom he had met when he visited Portugal. Connie was described by Doyle&#x27;s biographer, Andrew Lycett, as being attractive, &quot;with pre-Raphaelite looks ... the most sought-after of the Doyle daughters&quot;. By December 1892, when Hornung, Doyle and Jerome visited the Black Museum at Scotland Yard, Hornung and Connie were engaged, and in 1893 Hornung dedicated his second novel, &quot;Tiny Luttrell&quot;, &quot;to C.A.M.D.&quot; They were married on 27 September 1893, although Doyle was not at the wedding and relations between the two writers were sometimes strained. The Hornungs had a son, Arthur Oscar, in 1895; while his first name was from Doyle, who was also Arthur&#x27;s godfather, the boy&#x27;s middle name was probably after Doyle and Hornung&#x27;s mutual friend Oscar Wilde and it was by his second name that he was known. In 1894 Doyle and Hornung began work on a play for Henry Irving, on the subject of boxing during the Regency; Doyle was initially eager and paid Hornung £50 as a down payment before he withdrew after the first act had been written: the work was never completed.

Like Hornung&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Tiny Luttrell&quot; had Australia as a backdrop and also used the plot device of an Australian woman in a culturally alien environment. The Australian theme was present in his next four novels: &quot;The Boss of Taroomba&quot; (1894), &quot;The Unbidden Guest&quot; (1894), &quot;Irralie&#x27;s Bushranger&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Rogue&#x27;s March&quot; (1896). In the last of these Hornung wrote of the Australian convict transport system, and showed evidence of a &quot;growing fascination with the motivation behind criminal behaviour and a deliberate sympathy for the criminal hero as a victim of events&quot;, while &quot;Irralie&#x27;s Bushranger&quot; introduced the character Stingaree, an Oxford-educated, Australian gentleman thief, in a novel that &quot;casts doubt on conventional responses&quot; to a positive criminal character, according to Hornung&#x27;s biographer, Stephen Knight.

===Introducing Raffles: 1898–1914===
In 1898 Hornung&#x27;s mother died, aged 72 and he dedicated his next book, a series of short stories titled &quot;Some Persons Unknown&quot;, to her memory. Later that year Hornung and his wife visited Italy for six months, staying in Posillipo; his account of the location appeared in an article of the May 1899 edition of &quot;The Cornhill Magazine&quot;. The Hornungs returned to London in early 1899, to a house in Pitt Street, West Kensington, where they lived for the next six years.

The fictional character Stingaree proved to be a prototype of a character Hornung used in a series of six short stories published in 1898 in &quot;Cassell&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, A. J. Raffles. The character was modelled on George Cecil Ives, a Cambridge-educated criminologist and talented cricketer who, like Raffles, was a resident of the Albany, a gentlemen&#x27;s only residence in Mayfair. The first tale of the series &quot;In the Chains of Crime&quot; was published in June that year, titled &quot;The Ides of March&quot;. The stories were collected into one volume—with two additional tales—under the name &quot;The Amateur Cracksman&quot;, which was published the following year. Hornung used a narrative form similar to Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes stories, with Raffles and his partner-in-crime (and former school fag) Bunny Manders being the criminal counterparts to Holmes and Dr. Watson—although Rowland writes that Raffles and Manders &quot;were also fictionalized versions of Wilde and Bosie&quot; (Wilde&#x27;s lover, Lord Alfred Douglas).—and he dedicated the stories to his brother-in-law: &quot;To A.C.D. This form of flattery&quot;. Doyle had warned against writing the stories, and reflected in his memoirs that &quot;there are few finer examples of short-story writing in our language than these, though I confess I think they are rather dangerous in their suggestion. I told him so before he put pen to paper, and the result has, I fear, borne me out. You must not make the criminal the hero&quot;. The book was a popular and financial success, although some critics also echoed Doyle&#x27;s fears. The reviewer in &quot;The Spectator&quot; wrote that &quot;stern moralists&quot; would consider the book&#x27;s premise &quot;as a new, ingenious, artistic, but most reprehensible application of the crude principles involved in the old-fashioned hero-worship of Jack Sheppard and Dick Turpin&quot;. The book ends with Manders imprisoned and Raffles apparently dead, something that left &quot;The Spectator&quot; reviewer &quot;expressing [their] satisfaction that this audaciously entertaining volume is not issued in a cheap form. It is emphatically a feat of virtuosity rather than a tribute to virtue.&quot;
After publishing two novels, &quot;Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; in 1899 and &quot;Peccavi&quot; in 1900, Hornung published a second collection of Raffles stories, &quot;The Black Mask&quot;, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told to apply for the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had &quot;aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; and his face was another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep&quot;. In the final story of the collection, &quot;The Knees of the Gods&quot;, Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; &quot;The Spectator&quot; declared &quot;this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral&quot;, while the reviewer for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; thought that Hornung&#x27;s &quot;invention has obviously flagged ... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote &quot;Peccavi&quot; should stoop to this&quot;.

In 1903 Hornung collaborated with Eugène Presbrey to write a four-act play, &quot;Raffles, The Amateur Cracksman&quot;, which was based on two previously published short stories, &quot;Gentlemen and Players&quot; and &quot;The Return Match&quot;. The play was first performed at the Princess Theatre, New York, on 27 October 1903 with Kyrle Bellew as Raffles, and ran for 168 performances.

In 1905, after publishing four other books in the interim, Hornung brought back the character Stingaree, previously seen in &quot;Irralie&#x27;s Bushranger&quot;. Later that year he responded to public demand and produced a third series of short Raffles stories in &quot;A Thief in the Night&quot;, in which Manders relates some of his and Raffles&#x27;s earlier adventures. The reviewer for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; thought that &quot;the sentimental side of the story has never before been shown so dramatically and romantically&quot;, and described the book as &quot;thrilling and exciting&quot;. Hornung&#x27;s next book was published in 1909 and was the final Raffles story, the full-length novel &quot;Mr. Justice Raffles&quot;; the book was poorly received, with the reviewer for &quot;The Observer&quot; asking if &quot;Hornung is perhaps a little tired of Raffles&quot;, and stating that &quot;it has not the magic or the &#x27;go&#x27; of the first &quot;Raffles&quot;, and there is no good in pretending that it has&quot;. During the course of the year he collaborated with Charles Sansom to write a play &quot;A Visit From Raffles&quot;, which was performed in November that year at the Brixton Empress Theatre, London.

Hornung turned away from Raffles thereafter, and in February 1911 published &quot;The Camera Fiend&quot;, a thriller whose narrator is an asthmatic cricket enthusiast with an ironmaster father, much as Hornung was himself. The story concerned the attempts of a scientist to photograph the soul as it left the body. Hornung followed this up with &quot;Fathers of Men&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Thousandth Woman&quot; (1913) before &quot;Witching Hill&quot; (1913), a collection of eight short stories in which he introduced the characters Uvo Delavoye and the narrator Gillon, whom Rowland considers to be &quot;reincarnations of Raffles and Bunny&quot;. Hornung&#x27;s next work, &quot;The Crime Doctor&quot; (1914) marked the end of his fictional output.

===First World War and aftermath===

Oscar Hornung left Eton College in 1914, intending to enter King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, later that year. When Britain entered the war against Germany, he volunteered, and was commissioned into the Essex Regiment. He was killed at the Second Battle of Ypres on 6 July 1915, aged 20. Although heartbroken by the loss, Hornung was adamant that some good would come of it and he edited a privately issued collection of Oscar&#x27;s letters home under the title &quot;Trusty and Well Beloved&quot;, released in 1916. Around this time he joined an anti-aircraft unit. In either 1916 or 1917 he joined the YMCA and did volunteer work in England for soldiers on leave; in March 1917 he visited France, writing a poem about his experience afterwards—something he had been doing more frequently since Oscar&#x27;s death—and a collection of his war poetry, &quot;Ballad of Ensign Joy&quot;, was published later that year.

In July 1917 Hornung&#x27;s poem, &quot;Wooden Crosses&quot;, was published in &quot;The Times&quot;, and in September, &quot;Bond and Free&quot; appeared. Towards the end of the year, he was accepted as a volunteer in a YMCA canteen and library &quot;a short distance behind the Front Line&quot;. During his service in Arras, in February 1918 he borrowed a staff car from a friend and visited his son&#x27;s grave near Ypres, before returning to the library in Arras. Hornung was concerned about support for pacifism among troops, and wrote to his wife about it. When she spoke to Doyle about the matter, rather than discussing it with Hornung he informed the military authorities. Hornung was angered by Doyle&#x27;s action, and &quot;told him there was no need for him to &#x27;butt in&#x27; except for his own &#x27;satisfaction&#x27;.&quot; Relations between the two men were strained as a result. Hornung continued to work at the library until the German spring offensive in March overran the British positions and he was forced to retreat, firstly to Amiens and then, in April, back to England. He stayed in England until November 1918, when he again took up his YMCA duties, establishing a rest hut and library in Cologne. In 1919 Hornung&#x27;s account of his time spent in France, &quot;Notes of a Camp-Follower on the Western Front&quot;, was published. Doyle later wrote of the book that &quot;there are parts of it which are brilliant in their vivid portrayal&quot;, while Hornung&#x27;s biographer, Alison Cox, described the book as &quot;one of the best records of the war as experienced on the front lines&quot;. That year Hornung also published his third and final volume of poetry, &quot;The Young Guard&quot;.

===Death and legacy===
Hornung finished his work with the YMCA and returned to England probably in early 1919, according to Rowland. He worked on a new novel but was hampered by poor health. His wife&#x27;s health was of even greater concern, so in February 1921 they took a holiday in the south of France to recuperate. He fell ill on the train with a chill that turned into influenza and pneumonia from which he died on 22 March 1921, aged 54. He was buried in Saint-Jean-de-Luz, in the south of France, in a grave adjacent to that of George Gissing. Doyle, returning from a spiritualist lecture tour of Australia, received the news in Paris and travelled south in time for the funeral.

When Hornung had still been courting Doyle&#x27;s sister, Doyle wrote that &quot;I like young Willie Hornung very much ... he is one of the sweetest-natured and most delicate-minded men I ever knew&quot;. Honouring him after his death, Doyle wrote that he &quot;was a Dr. [Samuel] Johnson without the learning but with a finer wit. No one could say a neater thing, and his writings, good as they are, never adequately represented the powers of the man, nor the quickness of his brain&quot;. His obituarist in &quot;The Times&quot; described him as &quot;a man of large and generous nature, a delightful companion and conversationalist&quot;.
Much of Hornung&#x27;s work fell out of favour as time passed; Rowland observed that &quot;all of Hornung&#x27;s other works have been forgotten, with the possible exception of &quot;Stingaree&quot;, but the cricketing Cracksman continues to enthral&quot;. The idea of a criminal as a positive character was one of Hornung&#x27;s legacies, and &quot;Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism&quot; states that &quot;critics have also interpreted Raffles as a prototype of the antihero in modern crime fiction&quot;. The academic Frank Wadleigh Chandler, describing Raffles&#x27;s death, writes that &quot;all his creator&#x27;s attempts to portray him as a hero, rather than an anti-hero, deservedly fail.&quot; Valentine highlights one aspect of the stories was the mix of &quot;devilry and daring&quot; demonstrated by Raffles; in this respect he was a literary &quot;forerunner of The Saint, James Bond and other insouciant types&quot;. The writer Colin Watson agrees, and called Hornung &quot;a precursor of [Ian] Fleming&quot;.

The character continued in book form: the writer Philip Atkey, under the pseudonym Barry Perowne, obtained permission from the Hornung estate to continue the Raffles stories, and seven more novels followed between 1933 and 1940, with Raffles transformed from a gentleman thief to a tough adventurer. Perowne continued the series in 1950, and 14 of his stories were published in the 1974 volume &quot;Raffles Revisited&quot;. Hornung&#x27;s original stories have undergone a number of reprints, and when all the short stories were published in a single volume, Graham Greene considered it &quot;a splendid idea&quot;. In 1975 Greene had written a play based on the Raffles stories, &quot;The Return of A. J. Raffles&quot;, which premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company, with Denholm Elliott as Raffles.

There were several Raffles films made during Hornung&#x27;s lifetime, Further films followed in the years after his death, including &quot;Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman&quot; (1925), with House Peters Sr.; &quot;Raffles&quot; (1930), featuring Ronald Colman; &quot;The Return of Raffles&quot; (1933), with George Barraud; and &quot;Raffles&quot; (1939), starring David Niven; the last of these was a Samuel Goldwyn Productions remake of their own 1930 film, which the academic Victor E. Neuburg called the &quot;most memorable portrayal&quot; of the character.

The BBC has dramatised some of Hornung&#x27;s Raffles stories for radio, first in the 1940s and again from 1985 to 1993 in the radio series &quot;Raffles&quot;. Nigel Havers narrated some of the stories on BBC radio in 1995. In 1977 Anthony Valentine played the thief, and Christopher Strauli his partner, in a Yorkshire Television series. A 2001 television film, &quot;Gentleman Thief&quot;, adapted the stories for a contemporary audience, with Havers playing the lead.

==Writing==
===Style and technique===

Hornung&#x27;s prose is widely admired for its lucid, simple style. Oliver Edwards, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, considered that &quot;not the least attractive part of the Raffles books is the simple, plain, unaffected language in which each one of them is written&quot;. The obituarist in the same newspaper agrees, and thinks Hornung had &quot;a power of good and clear description and a talent for mystery and surprise&quot;. Colin Watson also considers the point, and observes that in Hornung&#x27;s writing, &quot;superfluous description has been avoided and account of action is to the point&quot;, while Doyle admired his &quot;sudden use of the right adjective and the right phrase&quot;, something the writer and journalist Jeremy Lewis sees as a &quot;flamboyant, Kiplingesque taste for the vivid&quot;.

Critics have observed that Hornung&#x27;s stories and novels are well-structured. George Orwell wrote that Hornung was &quot;a very conscientious and on his level a very able writer. Anyone who cares for sheer efficiency must admire his work&quot;. Watson states that Hornung&#x27;s &quot;writing has pace. The stories, however ridiculous, carry the readers along briskly&quot;. According to Cox, &quot;Hornung&#x27;s work showed steady maturation&quot; during his career, a point that Doyle also agreed with, although Edwards disagrees, and thinks &quot;The Crime Doctor&quot; to be one of Hornung&#x27;s weaker books.

Hornung&#x27;s approach to characters differed from other contemporary authors. Cox notes that Hornung &quot;frequently chose to write from the perspective of the criminal&quot;, and while many of Hornung&#x27;s novels contained criminal activity as a major element of the plot, the critic for &quot;Contemporary Authors&quot; states that the works do not &quot;belong to the crime-fiction genre&quot;. Hornung&#x27;s works included elements from more general fiction, &quot;such as false identities, disguises, and disowned heiresses&quot;.

The academic Nick Rance identifies three categories of Raffles stories: &quot;the rise of the New Woman&quot;, in which Raffles either escapes from romantic entanglements, or uses the infatuations of a woman in order to achieve his aims; &quot;the rise of the plutocracy&quot;, in which Raffles steals from the nouveau riche as much as the upper classes; and those stories that seek &quot;to reaffirm or re-establish a sense of middle-class identity&quot;. The last category is based on Raffles not being a member of &quot;Society&quot;, only being accepted because of his cricketing ability and associated fame. From this point, Raffles&#x27;s stealing from the rich is a &quot;rearguard action on behalf of the puritan values&quot; which was perceived as making up middle-class values, although Rance also states that those values are obscured because of the changing boundaries between the classes. Gariepy makes the same point, and considers that &quot;Raffles&#x27;s daring exploits and fantastic adventures symbolized the growing rebellion against Victorian sensibility at the turn of the century&quot;.
Hornung kept abreast of scientific and medical developments, and was keen to incorporate them into his stories which, the critic for &quot;Contemporary Authors&quot; states, shows Hornung had &quot;a streak of modernity and decided interest in new ideas&quot;. &quot;The Camera Fiend&quot; uses the modern technology of the camera as an instrument central to the plot, while the protagonist of &quot;The Crime Doctor&quot; uses psychology to identify criminals.

Throughout the Raffles stories patriotism runs as an intermittent theme—to such an extent that the writer William Vivian Butler describes him as a &quot;super-patriot&quot;. In the course of the short story &quot;A Jubilee Present&quot; Raffles, celebrating Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee, steals a gold cup from the British Museum and sends it to the queen, telling Manders that &quot;we have been ruled over for sixty years by infinitely the finest monarch in the world&quot;. In &quot;The Knees of the Gods&quot;, Raffles volunteers for service in the Second Boer War, changing his name and hair colour—he jokes to Manders that he is prepared to &quot;dye for his country&quot;—and he later confesses his true identity to his superiors in order to unmask a spy.

Some of Hornung&#x27;s novels, including &quot;The Shadow of the Rope&quot;, &quot;No Hero&quot; and &quot;The Thousandth Woman&quot;, are notable for &quot;portraying women in a rather modern, favorable light&quot;, according to the critic for &quot;Contemporary Authors&quot;, showing concern for their unequal position in society. Cox identifies a theme of guilt running through a number of works. Among these is &quot;Peccavi&quot;, in which a clergyman lives his life trying to atone for an earlier crime; &quot;Shadow of the Rope&quot;, in which a woman is accused of her husband&#x27;s murder; and &quot;The Thousandth Woman&quot;, in which a woman stands by her lover after he is accused of murder.

Although Hornung&#x27;s Australian experience was brief, it influenced most of his literary work from &quot;A Bride from the Bush&quot; published in 1899, to &quot;Old Offenders and a Few Old Scores&quot;, which was published after his death. According to Chandler, &quot;nearly two-thirds of [Hornung&#x27;s] books refer in varying degrees to Australian incidents and experiences&quot;, with &quot;even Raffles&quot; starting his criminal career in Australia. Some of Horning&#x27;s works—such as &quot;A Bride from the Bush&quot;—were praised for their accuracy of detail in depicting the Australian environment, although the detail could overwhelm the storyline, as in &quot;The Rogue&#x27;s March&quot;.

Cricket was one of Hornung&#x27;s lifelong passions, and he was delighted to become a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1907. From 1899 to 1907, he was the secretary of the Authors Cricket Club, organising the team&#x27;s matches − a position which gave him a substantial degree of networking power in the literary world. The sport also permeated his stories, with Raffles playing for the Gentlemen of England. Rance observes that Raffles compares law-breaking and cricket: &quot;crime is reckoned as another and better sport&quot;.

Raffles does on occasion disparage his game, commenting to Manders in &quot;Gentlemen and Players&quot;, &quot;where&#x27;s the satisfaction of taking a man&#x27;s wicket when you want his spoons?&quot; Valentine also considers the point, and sees Raffles&#x27;s cricket as a front for his criminal activities, citing Raffles&#x27;s praise for cricket for &quot;the glorious protection it affords a person of my proclivities&quot;.

Watson examines Raffles&#x27;s actions within the broader context of sportsmanship, with Raffles acting within his own moral code &quot;of what is &#x27;done&#x27; and &#x27;not done&#x27;.&quot; Orwell, in his essay &quot;Raffles and Miss Blandish&quot;, observes that when Raffles feels remorse, it &quot;is almost purely social; he has disgraced &#x27;the old school&#x27;, he has lost his right to enter &#x27;decent society&#x27;, he has forfeited his amateur status and become a cad&quot;.

<doc id="1045096" wikidata="Q14868" url="?curid=1045096" title="Buxtehude">
<text>Buxtehude (), officially the [[Hanseatic]] City of Buxtehude (, ()), is a town on the Este River in Northern Germany, belonging to the district of Stade in Lower Saxony. It is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region and attached to the city&#x27;s S-Bahn rapid transit network. Buxtehude is a medium-sized town and the second largest municipality in the Stade district (). It lies on the southern border of the Altes Land in close proximity to the city-state of Hamburg. To the west lie the towns of Horneburg and Stade and to the south there are a number of incorporated villages featuring mostly upscale housing; e.g., Ottensen and Apensen.

==History==
Early signs of settlements are the Daensen folding chair from a Bronze Age tumulus near Daensen and the Ovelgönne bread roll from the Pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe, which was found in a loam mine in Ovelgönne.

A settlement by the Este river is first recorded in 959. The manor of &quot;Buochstadon&quot; was given to the Abbey of Magdeburg. Soon a wharf, &quot;Hude&quot;, is established.
In 1135 the settlement is mentioned as &quot;Buchstadihude&quot; in a reference to the success of trade from the quay.
In 1180 the Duchy of Saxony, to which &quot;Buchstadihude&quot; belonged, was conquered and dissolved. Buxtehude became part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, newly upgraded to imperial immediacy it became one of the many successor states of the Duchy of Saxony. Nevertheless, ecclesiastically Buxtehude remained part of the Diocese of Verden until Catholicism was overthrown in the Reformation with that diocese remaining vacant since 1644.
In 1197 two royal settlers founded a Benedictine monastery near the village. Owing to the fertile soil and a partial participation in the saline of Lüneburg wealth and population increased.
In 1280 the prince-archbishop Giselbert of Bremen ordered the settlement to be protected by defensive walls and fortifications including 5 &quot;zwingers&quot;, 7 peels and 3 town gates.
In 1328 the town hall is mentioned for the first time and the settlement is granted full town privileges, based on the law of Hamburg. By now &quot;Buxtehude&quot; was self-governing and rapidly growing into a centre of trade.
In 1485 the immensely wealthy &quot;Master Halepaghen&quot;, cousin and tutor of the burgomaster of Hamburg, died and donated his assets to the town for scholarships and charitable purposes.
In 1542 the town council of Buxtehude adopted Lutheranism within its domain.

In the 1600s Hanseatic trade declined with the most important area of trade being in cattle. Apart from Stade, Buxtehude was the only crossing point on the Elbe river.
In 1645 Buxtehude surrendered to the Swedish army and lost its independence. Trade and population decrease dramatically.
In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen was converted to the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedes and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown.
In 1769 the monastery was demolished due to secularization.

In 1823 the Duchy was abolished and its territory became part of the Stade Region.
In 1837 the link road through the town reanimates business and trade.
1845 is dominated by industrial boom with a paper factory being installed on the former cloister ground.

In 1945 the population grew to 14,000. Much living space in Hamburg was in ruins and people fled to the suburbs and surrounding towns and villages such as Buxtehude.
In 1958 Buxtehude became part of the plan for the reconstruction of Hamburg after the war and thus was heavily funded by the government.
Lower Saxony incorporates 9 neighbouring villages into the town in 1972 changing the structure of Buxtehude and creating a cluster of more than 30,000 inhabitants.
In 1983 the old part of town was pedestrianized.
In 1985 town twinning with Blagnac (France) is undertaken.
In 1990 Ribnitz-Damgarten in the former German Democratic Republic became the second twin town.

==Economy==
Since 1881 Buxtehude has had its own railroad station on the R50 line between Hamburg and Cuxhaven. In late 2007 this line was added to the rapid transit system of the Hamburg S-Bahn by the HVV.

Since 1928 there has also been a second railroad line crossing Buxtehude, the &quot;EVB&quot; () between Hamburg&#x27;s outermost district and Bremerhaven on the coast of the North Sea.
The Este river connects the town to the important Elbe river north. Earlier in history this connection was used to ship goods into the small harbour, which still exists but has become less accessible due to town developments and aggradation.

A major highway, 

In April 2019 the unemployment rate in Buxtehude was 3.8%.

===Companies===
Several major companies have production sites or headquarters in Buxtehude:
* Airbus Operations GmbH - Cabin Electronics, the commercial aircraft manufacturer
* Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch company in the personal care and food sector.
* KID-Systeme GmbH, a Buxtehude-based supplier for aeroplane cabin electronics
* INTERPANE, a German manufacturer of insulation glass
* Harros Krämerladen, a large German supermarket corporation
* Pioneer Hi-Bred, a subdivision of the US-based chemical producer DuPont, developer and exporter of seeds
* Nord Kalksandsteinwerke, a German producer of lime sand bricks and other building material
* Niederelbe Schifffahrtsgesselleschaft (NSB), German container shipping companies
* implantcast GmbH, German manufacturer of orthopaedic implants, such as artificial hips and knees

==Culture==
Buxtehude is sometimes called the &quot;Fairytale Capital of the World,&quot; an epithet that it shares with Kassel. The tale of &quot;The Hare and the Hedgehog&quot; by the Brothers Grimm is set in this town. Furthermore, the name is used in numerous German tales. And thus some people claim that the town of Buxtehude does not actually exist. The German saying &quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;to chase somebody off to Buxtehude&quot;) means to exile someone to a far-away place.

===Museums===
The Museum of Regional History and Art is located here.

===Local dialects===
German and Low Saxon, which is rarely spoken now but can be still heard spoken by older people. Also one of the local high schools Halepaghen-Schule holds a Low German reading contest each school year.

===Tourism===

<doc id="1045113" wikidata="Q594992" url="?curid=1045113" title="Francis L. Dade">
<text>Francis Langhorne Dade (February 22, 1792 – December 28, 1835) was a United States Army officer who served in the War of 1812 and the Seminole Wars. Dade was killed in a battle with Seminole Indians that came to be known as the &quot;Dade Massacre&quot;.

==Life and career==
Francis Dade was born in King George County, Virginia in 1792. Dade&#x27;s family was part of the elite slave-owner class of the South. His ancestor, also named Francis Dade, migrated from England to the Virginia Colony in 1650, and was elected to the House of Burgesses. Dade initially studied to be a lawyer under the tutelage of his cousin Lawrence Dade, but he later chose to pursue a military career instead. In March 1813 (during the War of 1812) he joined the U.S. Army 12th Infantry Regiment as a Lieutenant. During the war he was tasked with recruiting duty in Louisa County. After the war ended he was transferred to the 4th Infantry Regiment in May 1815.

In 1818, Dade was part of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s army that invaded Florida. During this invasion, Dade participated in the occupation of Spanish Pensacola and the raising of the U.S. flag over the city. He was also promoted to Captain in 1818. Dade was later appointed as the duty officer under Andrew Jackson in Pensacola. In 1821, after Florida was annexed, Dade was involved in the arrest of Spanish official José Callava, who had refused to hand over documents to the United States. Dade apprehended Callava and personally brought him to Andrew Jackson. Dade later led two expeditions, in 1825 and 1826, from Fort Brooke to Fort King, which paved the way for a military road between the two forts. In November 1826, Dade and his soldiers built Fort Duval, a military fort on the mouth of the Suwannee River. In January 1827, Dade and his soldiers displaced a number of Seminole Indians from their villages, using the pretext of the murder of a White settler family by the Aucilla River. In December 1827, Dade married Amanda Middleton in Pensacola, which was one of the first Protestant marriages in the city.

Dade was later put in command of the United States Army base on Key West. He was promoted to Brevet Major in February 1828 after ten years of service as a Captain. At Key West he commanded a garrison of 47 soldiers, half of whom were European immigrants. Dade was stationed in Key West until late 1835, when tensions rose with the Seminoles over the Indian Removal Act, which would soon culminate in the Second Seminole War. Because of these tensions, General Duncan Clinch ordered Dade to leave 1 NCO and 3 Privates in Key West before taking the rest of his men to Fort Brooke to prepare for the impending conflict with the Seminole Indians.

Major Dade&#x27;s final mission was to lead a U.S. Army column of 110 soldiers and 1 six-pounder cannon from Fort Brooke up north to Fort King. The soldiers under Dade&#x27;s command were part of the 4th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Artillery Regiment, and 3rd Artillery Regiment. Led by Chief Micanopy and Chief Chipco, the Seminoles destroyed bridges over the Hillsborough River and Withlacoochee River in order to delay the progress of the column, and the Seminole warriors then ambushed the column on December 28, 1835, killing Dade and nearly all of his soldiers, leaving only two survivors. On that same day, a group of Seminoles warriors assassinated U.S. official Wiley Thompson at Fort King. Both of these attacks marked the beginning of the Second Seminole War. These events were followed in 1836 by widespread Seminole attacks on white settlers in Florida, and then by a U.S. military offensive led by General Winfield Scott. Dade and his men were not formally buried until a unit led by Edmund P. Gaines arrived at the site of the massacre in February 1836, Dade&#x27;s remains only being identifiable by his vest and infantry buttons.

== Legacy ==

When hostilities ceased, the Army proposed to transfer the remains of all who died in the territory, including those who fell with Dade, to a single burial ground. Reinternment took place at the St. Augustine Post Cemetery, which would become St. Augustine National Cemetery. In addition to Dade&#x27;s command, more than 1,400 soldiers were interred in three mass graves. These men are memorialized by the Dade Monument, which is composed of three distinct pyramids, constructed of native coquina stone, and an obelisk. The dedication of the memorial at a ceremony on August 14, 1842, marked the end of the Florida Indian Wars.

The Dade Monument was erected in 1845 at the West Point Cemetery to honor Major Dade and the men under his command who were killed in battle.

Miami-Dade County, Florida (until 13 November 1997 named Dade County); Dade County, Georgia; Dade County, Missouri; Dadeville, Alabama; and Dade City, Florida are all named after Major Dade. The now decommissioned fort on Egmont Key was also named for him. The battle is re-enacted at the Dade Battlefield Historic State Park each year. In 2002, the Dade County Courthouse was renamed the Major Francis Langhorne Dade County Courthouse by the Board of County Commissioners of Miami-Dade County. In the resolution changing the courthouse&#x27;s name, the Board noted that it found &quot;that Major Francis Langhorne Dade is a person who made a significant contribution to Miami-Dade County&quot;.

<text>Whole Wheat Radio was a not-for-profit, listener-driven online community radio station from Talkeetna, Alaska. It was centered around independent music, and aired 24 hours a day.

The station pioneered several social and technical webcast feats, including the use of wiki software to collaboratively catalogue music, interactive house concerts where listeners could comment and tip the artists, electronic DJs (dubbed &quot;EJs&quot;), listener phonegrams, and its recorded shows were among the first available podcasts.

After eight years of uninterrupted broadcast, the station closed on October 20, 2010.

==History==
Whole Wheat Radio began as &quot;Radio Free Talkeetna&quot; in August 2002. Software developer James (Jim) Kloss started the live interactive webcast immediately after DSL internet arrived in the small village of Talkeetna, Alaska. Jim was known online for his development of the nochange BBS and XChange file transfer program. Jim Kloss died in 2023, survived by his wife Esther Golton. A Celebration of Life was held in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio in July 2023.

The site changed its name to Whole Wheat Radio by December 2002.

The site was first broadcast from an existing 12x12 foot cabin built by Esther. In July 2004, a more permanent structure dubbed The Wheat Hole was built to accommodate an in-house audience of 50. In 2008, the venue was moved to a &quot;renovated log saloon&quot; dubbed The Wheat Palace to accommodate more patrons, and to host other activities.

==Music and programming==

Whole Wheat Radio played independent music, initially due to commercial licensing costs. The site evolved into a vehicle for promoting independent artists, helped by Jim&#x27;s partner and musician Esther Golton. Artists gave permission and sent CDs for their music to be played on the station.

Genres weren&#x27;t restricted, but favoured acoustic and folk music.

The site hosted numerous house concerts which were broadcast live, including Marian Call, Rod Picott, Jeffrey Foucault, Amanda Shires, and Danny Schmidt. Proceeds from the concerts were given to the performers, often exceeding income artists grossed from traditional media events.

The stream also included aspects of talk radio, from 15 minute rants to full morning shows. After airing, these were taped and made available as podcasts.

==Technology and community==
Whole Wheat Radio streamed 56 kbit/s mp3PRO audio using SHOUTcast, which could be accessed from any compatible streaming audio player compatible with the format. Clients without mp3PRO support fell back to an equivalent-quality 128 kbit/s MP3 stream.

A custom install of MediaWiki ran the user-editable music database, the same software that operates Wikipedia, Wiktionary and other Wikimedia Foundation projects. Listeners (affectionately dubbed Wheatheads) were encouraged to add tags, lyrics, art, ratings and other information to song, album and artist pages. The currently-playing song was displayed on the home and chat pages, with links to these resources for more information.

The site accepted regular submissions for logos, which were rotated regularly.

Wheatheads could call in phonegrams that were played automatically on the stream, or leave a comment in the chat system for an EJ to read on air. Text based games (and later, rewards for collaborating on articles) would let Wheatheads accrue &quot;wheatberries&quot;, an early form of web gamification.

Separate podcast feeds were available for each of the shows shortly after they had aired live, such as the &quot;Rant-N-Ravin&#x27; Muffin News&quot;. and house concerts.

==Reception==
In 2005, Whole Wheat Radio was discussed in an episode of &quot;The Dawn and Drew Show&quot;, and in an interview with Derek and Swoopy from &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Skepticality&quot; podcast.

Journalist Doc Searls commented in 2004 that &quot;it&#x27;s an outstanding station. If you miss KPIG&#x27;s live Webcast, Whole Wheat Radio will ease your surcease. You might think of WWR as folksy or charming (it&#x27;s both). I think of them as heroic. What they do is the very, very best of what radio is all about.&quot;

In an article for &quot;PC World&quot;, Derek Sivers of CDBaby commented that &quot;online radio is the best way to find new music and [I recommend] indie-flavored Whole Wheat Radio&quot;.

==Conclusion==
In 2010, Jim pushed for a greater emphasis on the site mission of helping independent artists over the chat aspects of the site. This generated animosity, culminating in an unsanctioned, separate Facebook group. Jim closed the site soon after, claiming he no longer loved the job.

The Wheat Palace continued to hold private parties, meetings, classes and art showings through 2011.

<doc id="1045117" wikidata="Q614389" url="?curid=1045117" title="Geoffrey Beene">
<text>Geoffrey Beene (born Samuel Albert Bozeman Jr.; August 30, 1924 – September 28, 2004) was an American fashion designer. Beene was one of New York&#x27;s most famous fashion designers, recognized for his artistic and technical skills and for creating simple, comfortable and dressy women&#x27;s wear.

In 2018, the Geoffrey Beene brand was acquired by PVH who previously produced the brand under license.

On June 23, 2021, it was announced that the Geoffrey Beene brand would be sold to Authentic Brands Group alongside Van Heusen, Izod, and Arrow. The sale closed on August 2, 2021, with United Legwear &amp; Apparel Company named as its licensee alongside the Van Heusen and Arrow brands. However, in April 2023 it was announced that Versa Group would be the new licensee for the Geoffrey Beene brand.

==Early life and education==
Beene was born on August 30, 1924, as Samuel Albert Bozeman Jr. in the small rural town of Haynesville, Louisiana, located just south of the Arkansas state line. He was born into a family of doctors and was encouraged to follow in their footsteps. He studied medicine at Tulane University in New Orleans but dropped out in 1946, after three years of study. Beene moved to Los Angeles, where he studied fashion design at the University of Southern California and worked in the display department of the I. Magnin retail store until 1947.

Later that year, he moved to New York City to attend the Traphagen School of Fashion. He then moved to Paris, where he attended the Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne (ECSCP) and the couture house of Molyneux. In 1949, he returned to New York, where he became Assistant Designer at the Seventh Avenue house of Harmay. In 1958, he left Harmay to design with Teal Traina, before founding his eponymous design house.

==Career==
Beene founded his firm, Geoffrey Beene, Inc., in New York City in 1963, in partnership with Teal Traina&#x27;s Leo Orlandi in a Seventh Avenue showroom.

A year later, he was awarded the Coty American Fashion Critics&#x27; Award, one of the most prestigious awards in fashion. His first collection was featured on the cover of Vogue Magazine.

In his 1970 collection, Beene applied the use of inexpensive fabrics such as sweatshirt and denim fabric for evening dresses. Introduced in 1971, the Beene Bag line of women’s wear used the same silhouettes as his couture line. By the mid-1970s, Beene had a number of licensing agreements for products such as eyeglasses and bed sheets, and also his most famously known cologne called Grey Flannel, launched in 1975. It contains notes of orange, lemon, rose, geranium, sandalwood and cedar wood, and is considered a classic men&#x27;s fragrance winning a FIFI Award in 1976. In 1976, Beene became the first American designer to show a collection in Milan, Italy. This success led to his sixth Coty Award in 1977, for giving impetus to American fashion abroad. In 1982, Beene received his eighth Coty Award; the most awarded to any one designer.

In 1986, Beene was named The Council of Fashion Designers of America&#x27;s Designer of the Year. Two years later, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awarded Beene the Special Award for Fashion as Art. In 1989, he opened the first Geoffrey Beene retail boutique on Fifth Avenue.

Beene&#x27;s clients included Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon, Nancy Reagan, Faye Dunaway and Glenn Close. Beene was known as both an innovator and a teacher. Several of his former apprentices, Kay Unger, Alber Elbaz and Maria Pinto are now successful fashion designers.

==Death==
On September 28, 2004, Beene died from pneumonia, as a complication of squamous-cell carcinoma, at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

==Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award==
In honor of Beene&#x27;s fashion legacy, the Council of Fashion Designers of America created the annual Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement award in 1984.

; Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award Recipients
==Charitable activities==

All net profits from Geoffrey Beene products are donated to philanthropic causes, such as cancer research, Alzheimer&#x27;s research, domestic violence prevention and response, Save the Children, and educational programs, including scholarships for students majoring in fashion and related disciplines.

In 2007, The Geoffrey Beene Foundation formed a strategic alliance with the FSF YMA Fashion Scholarship Fund to further the mutual goal of expanding support for students seeking careers in the Fashion Industry. The foundation has donated to the FSF in excess of $5 million committed through 2016.

<text>A landrace is a domesticated, locally adapted, often traditional variety of a species of animal or plant that has developed over time, through adaptation to its natural and cultural environment of agriculture and pastoralism, and due to isolation from other populations of the species. Landraces are distinct from cultivars and from standard breeds.

A significant proportion of farmers around the world grow landrace crops, and most plant landraces are associated with traditional agricultural systems. Landraces of many crops have probably been grown for millennia. Increasing reliance upon modern plant cultivars that are bred to be uniform has led to a reduction in biodiversity, because most of the genetic diversity of domesticated plant species lies in landraces and other traditionally used varieties. Some farmers using scientifically improved varieties also continue to raise landraces for agronomic reasons that include better adaptation to the local environment, lower fertilizer requirements, lower cost, and better disease resistance. Cultural and market preferences for landraces include culinary uses and product attributes such as texture, color, or ease of use.

Plant landraces have been the subject of more academic research, and the majority of academic literature about landraces is focused on botany in agriculture, not animal husbandry. Animal landraces are distinct from ancestral wild species of modern animal stock, and are also distinct from separate species or subspecies derived from the same ancestor as modern domestic stock. Not all landraces derive from wild or ancient animal stock; in some cases, notably dogs and horses, domestic animals have escaped in sufficient numbers in an area to breed feral populations that form new landraces through evolutionary pressure.

== Characteristics ==
There are differences between authoritative sources on the specific criteria which describe landraces, although there is broad consensus about the existence and utility of the classification. Individual criteria may be weighted differently depending on a given source&#x27;s focus (e.g., governmental regulation, biological sciences, agribusiness, anthropology and culture, environmental conservation, pet -keeping and -breeding, etc.). Additionally, not all cultivars agreed to be landraces exhibit every characteristic of a landrace. General features that characterize a landrace may include:

* It is morphologically distinctive and identifiable (i.e., has particular and recognizable characteristics or properties), yet remains &quot;dynamic&quot;.
* It is genetically adapted to, and has a reputation for being able to withstand, the conditions of the local environment, including climate, disease and pests, even cultural practices.
* It is not the product of formal (governmental, organizational, or private) breeding programs, and may lack systematic selection, development and improvement by breeders.
* It is maintained and fostered less deliberately than a standardized breed, with its genetic isolation principally a matter of geography acting upon whatever animals that happened to be brought by humans to a given area.
* It has a historical origin in a specific geographic area, will usually have its own local name(s), and will often be classified according to intended purpose.
* Where yield (e.g. of a grain or fruit crop) can be measured, a landrace will show high stability of yield, even under adverse conditions, but a moderate yield , even under carefully managed conditions.
* At the level of genetic testing, its heredity will show a degree of integrity, but still some genetic heterogeneity (i.e. genetic diversity).

== Terminology ==
&quot;Landrace&quot; literally means &#x27;country-breed&#x27; (German: &quot;Landrasse&quot;) and close cognates of it are found in various Germanic languages. The first known reference to the role of landraces as genetic resources was made in 1890 at an agriculture and forestry congress in Vienna, Austria. The term was first defined by Kurt von Rümker in 1908, and more clearly described in 1909 by U. J. Mansholt, who wrote that landraces have more stable characteristics and better resistance to adverse conditions, but have lower production capacity than cultivars, and are apt to change genetically when moved to another environment. H. Kiessling added in 1912 that a landrace is a mixture of phenotypic forms despite relative outward uniformity, and a great adaptability to its natural and human environment.

The word &quot;landrace&quot; entered non-academic English in the early 1930s, by way of the Danish Landrace pig, a particular breed of lop-eared swine. Many other languages do not use separate terms, like &quot;landrace&quot; and &quot;breed&quot;, but instead rely on extended description to convey such distinctions. Spanish is one such language.

Geneticist D. Phillip Sponenberg described animal breeds within these classes: the landrace, the standardized breed, modern &quot;type&quot; breeds, industrial strains, and feral populations. He describes landraces as an early stage of breed development, created by a combination of founder effect, isolation, and environmental pressures. Human selection for production goals is also typical of landraces.

As discussed in more detail in breed, that term itself has several definitions from various scientific and animal husbandry perspectives. Some of those senses of &quot;breed&quot; relate to the concept of landraces. A Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) guideline defines &quot;landrace&quot; and &quot;landrace breed&quot; as &quot;a breed that has largely developed through adaptation to the natural environment and traditional production system in which it has been raised.&quot; This is in contrast to its definition of a &quot;standardized breed&quot;: &quot;a breed of livestock that was developed according to a strict programme of genetic isolation and formal artificial selection to achieve a particular phenotype.&quot;

In various domestic species (including pigs, goats, sheep and geese) some standardized breeds include &quot;Landrace&quot; in their names, but do not meet widely used definitions of landraces. For example, the British Landrace pig is a standardized breed, derived from earlier breeds with &quot;Landrace&quot; names.

Farmers&#x27; variety, usually applied to local cultivars, or seen as intermediate between a landrace and a cultivar, may also include landraces when referring to plant varieties not subjected to formal breeding programs.

=== Autochthonous and allochthonous landraces ===
A landrace native to, or produced for a long time within the agricultural system in which it is found is referred to as an &quot; landrace&quot;, while a more recently introduced one is termed an &quot; landrace&quot;.

Within academic agronomy, the term &quot;autochthonous landrace&quot; is sometimes used with a more technical, productivity-related definition, synthesized by A. C. Zeven from previous definitions beginning with Mansholt&#x27;s: &quot;an autochthonous landrace is a variety with a high capacity to tolerate biotic and abiotic stress, resulting in a high yield stability and an intermediate yield level under a low input agricultural system.&quot;

The terms &quot;autochthonous&quot; and &quot;allochthonous&quot; are most often applied to plants, with animals more often being referred to as &quot;indigenous&quot; or &quot;native&quot;. Examples of references in sources to long-term local landraces of livestock include constructions such as &quot;indigenous landraces of sheep&quot;, and &quot;Leicester Longwool sheep were bred to the native landraces of the region&quot;. Some usage of &quot;autochthonous&quot; does occur in reference to livestock, e.g. &quot;autochthonous races of cattle such as the Asturian mountain cattle – Ratina and Casina – and Tudanca cattle.&quot;

== Biodiversity and conservation ==
A significant proportion of farmers around the world grow landrace crops. However, as industrialized agriculture spreads, cultivars, which are selectively bred for high yield, rapid growth, disease and drought resistance, and other commercial production values, are supplanting landraces, putting more and more of them at risk of extinction.

In 1927 at the International Agricultural Congress, organized by the predecessor of the FAO, an extensive discussion was held on the need to conserve landraces. A recommendation that members organize nation-by-nation landrace conservation did not succeed in leading to widespread conservation efforts.

Landraces are often free from many intellectual property and other regulatory encumbrances. However, in some jurisdictions, a focus on their production may result in missing out on some benefits afforded to producers of genetically selected and homogenous organisms, including breeders&#x27; rights legislation, easier availability of loans and other business services, even the right to share seed or stock with others, depending on how favorable the laws in the area are to high-yield agribusiness interests.

As Regine Andersen of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute (Norway) and the Farmers&#x27; Rights Project puts it, &quot;Agricultural biodiversity is being eroded. This trend is putting at risk the ability of future generations to feed themselves. In order to reverse the trend, new policies must be implemented worldwide. The irony of the matter is that the poorest farmers are the stewards of genetic diversity.&quot; Protecting farmer interests and protecting biodiversity is at the heart of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (the &quot;Plant Treaty&quot; for short), under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), though its concerns are not exclusively limited to landraces.

Landraces played a basic role in the development of the standardized breeds but are today threatened by the market success of the standardized breeds. In developing countries, landraces still play an important role, especially in traditional production systems. Specimens within an animal landrace tend to be genetically similar, though more diverse than members of a standardized or formal breed.

=== In situ and ex situ landrace conservation ===
Two approaches have been used to conserve plant landraces:
* &quot;in situ&quot; where the landrace is grown and conserved by farmers on farms.
* &quot;ex situ&quot; where the landrace is conserved in an artificial environment such as a gene-bank, using controls such as laminated packets kept frozen at .

As the amount of agricultural land dedicated to growing landrace crops declines, such as in the example of wheat landraces in the Fertile Crescent, landraces can become extinct in cultivation. Therefore &quot;ex situ&quot; landrace conservation practices are considered a way to avoid losing the genetic diversity completely. Research published in 2020 suggested that existing ways of cataloging diversity within &quot;ex situ&quot; genebanks fall short of cataloging the appropriate information for landrace crops.

An &quot;in situ&quot; conservation effort to save the Berrettina di Lungavilla squash landrace made use of participatory plant breeding practices in order to incorporate the local community into the work.

=== Preserving cereal landraces ===
Preservation efforts for cereal strains are ongoing including &quot;in situ&quot; and in online-searchable germplasm collections (seed banks), coordinated by Biodiversity International and the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB, UK). However, more may need to be done, because plant genetic variety, the source of crop health and seed quality, depends on a diversity of landraces and other traditionally used varieties. Efforts () were mostly focused on Iberia, the Balkans, and European Russia, and dominated by species from mountainous areas. Despite their incompleteness, these efforts have been described as &quot;crucial in preventing the extinction of many of these local ecotypes&quot;.

An agricultural study published in 2008 showed that landrace cereal crops began to decline in Europe in the 19th century such that cereal landraces &quot;have largely fallen out of use&quot; in Europe. Landrace cultivation in central and northwest Europe was almost eradicated by the early 20th century, due to economic pressure to grow improved, modern cultivars. While many in the region are already extinct, some have survived by being passed from generation to generation, and have also been revived by enthusiasts outside Europe to preserve European agriculture and food culture elsewhere. These survivals are usually for specific uses, such as thatch, and traditional European cuisine and craft beer brewing.

== Plants ==

=== Plant landrace development ===
The label &quot;landrace&quot; includes regional cultigens that are genetically heterogeneous, but with enough characteristics in common to permit their recognition as a group. These characteristics are used by farmers to manage diversity and purity within landraces.

In some cultures, the development of new landraces is typically limited to members of specific social groups, such as women or shaman. Maintaining existing landraces, like developing new landraces, requires that farmers be able to identify crop-specific characteristics and that those characteristics are passed on to following generations.

Over time, the process of identifying the distinguishing characteristic or features of a new landrace is reinforced by cultivation processes; for example, descendants of a plant that is notably drought tolerant may become iteratively more so through selective breeding as farmers regard it as better for dry areas and prioritize planting it in those locations. This is one way in which farming systems can develop a portfolio of landraces over time that have specific ecological niches and uses.

Conversely, modern cultivars can also be developed into a landrace over time when farmers save seed and practice selective breeding.

Although landraces are often discussed once they have become endemic to a particular geographical region, landraces have always been moved over long and short distances. Some landraces can adapt to various environments, while others only thrive within specific conditions. Self-fertilizing and vegetatively populated species adapt by changing the frequencies of phenotypes. Outbreeding crops absorb new genotypes through intentional and unintentional hybridization, or through mutation.

A clear example of vegetal landrace would consist in the diverse adaptations of wheat to differential artificial selection constraints.

=== Cultivars developed from landraces ===
Members of a landrace variety, selected for uniformity with regards to a unique feature over a period of time, can be developed into a farmers&#x27; variety or cultivar. Traits from landraces are valuable for incorporation into elite lines. Crop disease resistance genes from landraces can provide eternally-needed resistances to more widely-used, modern varieties.

=== Animal landrace development ===
Some standardized animal breeds originate from attempts to make landraces more consistent through selective breeding, and a landrace may become a more formal breed with the creation of a breed registry or publication of a breed standard. In such a case, one may think of the landrace as a &quot;stage&quot; in breed development. However, in other cases, formalizing a landrace may result in the genetic resource of a landrace being lost through crossbreeding.

While many landrace animals are associated with farming, other domestic animals have been put to use as modes of transportation, as companion animals, for sporting purposes, and for other non-farming uses, so their geographic distribution may differ. For example, horse landraces are less common because human use of them for transport has meant that they have moved with people more commonly and constantly than most other domestic animals, reducing the incidence of populations locally genetically isolated for extensive periods of time.

=== Examples of animal landraces ===

==== Cats ====
Many standardized breeds have rather recently (within a century or less) been derived from landraces. Examples, often called &quot;natural breeds&quot;, include Arabian Mau, Egyptian Mau, Korat, Kurilian Bobtail, Maine Coon, Manx, Norwegian Forest Cat, Siberian, and Siamese.

In some cases, such as the Turkish Angora and Turkish Van breeds and their possible derivation from the Van cat landrace, the relationships are not entirely clear.

==== Cattle ====
==== Dogs ====
Dog landraces and the selectively bred dog breeds that follow breed standards vary widely depending on their origins and purpose.
Landraces are distinguished from dog breeds which have breed standards, breed clubs and registries.

Landrace dogs have more variety in their appearance than do standardized dog breeds. An example of a dog landrace with a related standardized breed with a similar name is the collie. The Scotch Collie is a landrace, while the Rough Collie and the Border Collie are standardized breeds. They can be very different in appearance, though the Rough Collie in particular was developed from the Scotch Collie by inbreeding to fix certain highly desired traits. In contrast to the landrace, in the various standardized Collie breeds, purebred individuals closely match a breed-standard appearance but might have lost other useful characteristics and have developed undesirable traits linked to inbreeding.

The ancient landrace dogs of the Fertile Crescent that led to the Saluki breed excels in running down game across open tracts of hot desert, but conformation-bred individuals of the breed are not necessarily able to chase and catch desert hares.

==== Goats ====
Some standardized breeds that are derived from landraces include the Dutch Landrace, Swedish Landrace and Finnish Landrace goats. The Danish Landrace is a modern mix of three different breeds, one of which was a &quot;Landrace&quot;-named breed.

==== Sheep ====
==== Horses ====
The wild progenitor of the domestic horse is extinct. It is rare for landraces among domestic horses to remain isolated, due to human use of horses for transportation, thus causing horses to move from one local population to another.

The heavy &#x27;draft&#x27; type of domestic horse, developed in Europe, has differentiated into many separate landraces or breeds. Examples of horse landraces also include insular populations in Greece and Indonesia, and, on a broader scale, New World populations derived from the founder stock of Colonial Spanish horse.

The Yakutian and Mongolian Horses of Asia have &quot;unimproved&quot; characteristics.

==== Pigs ====
The standardized swine breeds named &quot;Landrace&quot; are often not actually landraces or derived from landraces. The Danish Landrace pig breed, pedigreed in 1896 from an actual local landrace, is the principal ancestor of the American Landrace (1930s). In this way, the Swedish Landrace is derived from the Danish and from other Scandinavian breeds, as is the British Landrace breed.

==== Chicken ====
==== Ducks ====
==== Geese ====
Many standardized goose breeds named &quot;Landrace&quot;, e.g. the Twente Landrace goose, are not actually true landraces, but may be derived from them.
==== Rabbits ====

<doc id="1045133" wikidata="Q17091642" url="?curid=1045133" title="Wrangell Volcanic Field">
<text>The Wrangell Volcanic Field is a volcanic field stretching from eastern Alaska in the United States to the southwestern Yukon Territory in Canada. The field includes the four highest volcanoes in the United States, Mount Bona, Mount Blackburn, Mount Sanford, and Mount Churchill, all of which exceed 15,000 ft (4,600 m) in elevation. It formed as a result of subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American Plate at the easternmost end of the Aleutian Trench[3].

The bulk of the Wrangell Volcanic Field lies within the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska, but the field also extends eastwards into the neighboring Saint Elias Mountains and the Yukon Territory.

The east–west length of the field is over 200 mile (320 km), while the width reaches up to 80 miles (130 km) in the central Wrangell Mountains. The field includes numerous shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes, caldera complexes, cinder cones, and extensive lava flows, which have erupted throughout the past 26 million years. All of the higher peaks are less than 5 million years old, since the rate of glacial erosion is very high in this region of extreme snowfall and cold temperatures. Higher elevations of the field above 5,000 ft (1,500 m) are almost entirely covered in glaciers and icefields, especially on the windward southern side of the ranges.

The field is named for Mount Wrangell, a massive shield volcano which has been active historically. The stratovolcano of Mount Churchill has had the largest recent eruptions, with two large-magnitude explosive eruptions in the last 2,000 years that blanketed most of the Yukon with volcanic ash (the White River Ash).

The volcanoes of the western Wrangell Mountains are less than 5 million years old with the youngest lava flows are probably as young as 50,000 years ago. The Canadian portion of the field is dominated by scattered remnants of upper Cenozoic subaerial lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Over large areas extrusive rocks lie in flat undisturbed piles on a Cenozoic surface of moderate relief. Locally, however, strata of the same age have been affected by a late pulse of tectonism, during which they were faulted, contorted into tight symmetrical folds, or overridden by pre-Cenozoic baserocks along southwesterly dipping thrust faults. Considerable recent uplift, accompanied by rapid erosion, has reduced once vast areas of upper Cenozoic volcanic rocks to small isolated remnants. Although no centers younger than late Miocene are known in Canada, the eruption of rhyolite pumice, White River Ash, from Mount Churchill near the head of Klutlan Glacier blanketed large areas of northwestern Canada with tephra some 2,000 years ago.

Most of volcanoes of the Western Wrangell Mountains are not like the other volcanoes located around the Pacific Rim. Rather than erupting explosive lavas forming stratovolcanoes, they have been built by the buildup of hundreds of comparatively fluid lava flows to form shield volcanoes. Only the young Mount Wrangell still shows its shield-like form; the other, commonly older volcanoes have had much of their original form removed by glacial and other erosional processes, such as Rabbit Mountain and Felsite Peak, which are now eroded to form an outcrop.

Major volcanoes of the Wrangell Volcanic Field include:
*Mount Bona, , Saint Elias Mountains

<doc id="1045136" wikidata="Q4902562" url="?curid=1045136" title="Biarticular muscle">
<text>Biarticular muscles are muscles that cross two joints rather than just one, such as the hamstrings which cross both the hip and the knee. The function of these muscles is complex and often depends upon both their anatomy and the activity of other muscles at the joints in question. Their role in movement is poorly understood.

==Anatomy==
Biarticular muscles cross two joints in series, usually in a limb. The details of the origin (proximal attachment) and insertion (distal attachment) can play a large role in determining muscle function. For instance, the human gastrocnemius technically spans both the knee and ankle joints. However, the origin point of the muscle is so close to the axis of rotation of the knee joint that the muscle&#x27;s effective lever arm would be very small, especially compared to its large lever arm at the ankle. As a result, even though it spans two joints, the strong bias in lever arms allows it to function primarily as an ankle plantar flexor. Other muscles, such as the hamstrings, do not display such biases, so their function is not immediately evident from anatomy alone. Another important concept of biarticular muscles (consider the rectus femoris muscle for this example) is the change in muscle length when motion at the proximal and distal ends of the muscle is happening. For example, in the propulsive phase of a jump, the thigh is extended at the coxal joint, and the shank (lower leg) is extended at the tibiofemoral joint. These joint positions cause the rectus femoris muscle to remain unchanged in net length, because the proximal (Eccentric action) and distal (concentric action) attachments are contradicting one another.

==Function==
Biarticular muscles can fulfill a range of functions during movement. By contracting isometrically (without changing length), they put the joint into a four-bar linkage, allowing the contraction of muscles at one joint to move the other by a fixed amount. Unlike four-bar linkages in which all elements are bone and angle relationships are fixed by the relative bone lengths, the biarticular muscle can hold the joint at many different lengths, creating a range of four-bar properties as needed.

Biarticular muscles can also transfer mechanical power between distal and proximal joints, though the direction and magnitude of this transfer varies with anatomy, muscle activity level, and joint angles. This is a crucial consideration when analyzing an organism&#x27;s movement using inverse dynamics.

<doc id="1045142" wikidata="Q637703" url="?curid=1045142" title="Debris">
<text>Debris (, ) is rubble, wreckage, ruins, litter and discarded garbage/refuse/trash, scattered remains of something destroyed, or, as in geology, large rock fragments left by a melting glacier, etc. Depending on context, &quot;debris&quot; can refer to a number of different things. The first apparent use of the French word in English is in a 1701 description of the army of Prince Rupert upon its retreat from a battle with the army of Oliver Cromwell, in England.

==Disaster==
In disaster scenarios, tornadoes leave behind large pieces of houses and mass destruction overall. This debris also flies around the tornado itself when it is in progress. The tornado&#x27;s winds capture debris it kicks up in its wind orbit, and spins it inside its vortex. The tornado&#x27;s wind radius is larger than the funnel itself. Tsunamis and hurricanes also bring large amounts of debris, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Earthquakes rock cities to rubble debris.

==Geological==

In geology, debris usually applies to the remains of geological activity including landslides, volcanic explosions, avalanches, mudflows or Glacial lake outburst floods (Jökulhlaups) and moraine, lahars, and lava eruptions. Geological debris sometimes moves in a stream called a debris flow. When it accumulates at the base of hillsides, it can be called &quot;talus&quot; or &quot;scree&quot;.

In mining, debris called &quot;attle&quot; usually consists of rock fragments which contain little or no ore.

==Marine==
&quot;Marine debris&quot; applies to floating garbage such as bottles, cans, styrofoam, cruise ship waste, offshore oil and gas exploration and production facilities pollution, and fishing paraphernalia from professional and recreational boaters. Marine debris is also called litter or flotsam and jetsam. Objects that can constitute marine debris include used automobile tires, detergent bottles, medical wastes, discarded fishing line and nets, soda cans, and bilge waste solids.

In addition to being unsightly, it can pose a serious threat to marine life, boats, swimmers, divers, and others. For example, each year millions of seabirds, sea turtles, fish, and marine mammals become entangled in marine debris, or ingest plastics which they have mistaken for food. As many as 30,000 northern fur seals per year get caught in abandoned fishing nets and either drown or suffocate. Whales mistake plastic bags for squid, and birds may mistake plastic pellets for fish eggs. At other times, animals accidentally eat the plastic while feeding on natural food.

The largest concentration of marine debris is the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

Marine debris most commonly originates from land-based sources. Various international agencies are currently working to reduce marine debris levels around the world.

==Meteorological==
In meteorology, debris usually applies to the remains of human habitation and natural flora after storm related destruction. This debris is also commonly referred to as storm debris. Storm debris commonly consists of roofing material, downed tree limbs, downed , downed power lines and poles, and wind-blown garbage. Storm debris can become a serious problem immediately after a storm, in that it often blocks access to individuals and communities that may require emergency services. This material frequently exists in such large quantities that disposing of it becomes a serious issue for a community. In addition, storm debris is often hazardous by its very nature, since, for example, downed power lines annually account for storm-related deaths.
==Space==
&quot;Space debris&quot; usually refers to the remains of spacecraft that have either fallen to Earth or are still orbiting Earth. Space debris may also consist of natural components such as chunks of rock and ice. The problem of space debris has grown as various space programs have left legacies of launches, explosions, repairs, and discards in both low Earth orbit and more remote orbits. These orbiting fragments have reached a great enough proportion to constitute a hazard to future space launches of both satellite and crewed vehicles. Various government agencies and international organizations are beginning to track space debris and also research possible solutions to the problem. While many of these items, ranging in size from nuts and bolts to entire satellites and spacecraft, may fall to Earth, other items located in more remote orbits may stay aloft for centuries. The velocity of some of these pieces of space junk have been clocked in excess of 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 km/h). A piece of space debris falling to Earth leaves a fiery trail, just like a meteor.

A debris disk is a circumstellar disk of dust and debris in orbit around a star.

==Surgical==
In medicine, debris usually refers to biological matter that has accumulated or lodged in surgical instruments and is referred to as surgical debris. The presence of surgical debris can result in cross-infections or nosocomial infections if not removed and the affected surgical instruments or equipment properly disinfected.

==War==

In the aftermath of a war, large areas of the region of conflict are often strewn with &quot;war debris&quot; in the form of abandoned or destroyed hardware and vehicles, mines, unexploded ordnance, bullet casings and other fragments of metal.

Much war debris has the potential to be lethal and continues to kill and maim civilian populations for years after the end of a conflict. The risks from war debris may be sufficiently high to prevent or delay the return of refugees. In addition war debris may contain hazardous chemicals or radioactive components that can contaminate the land or poison civilians who come into contact with it. Many Mine clearance agencies are also involved in the clearance of war debris.

Land mines in particular are very dangerous as they can remain active for decades after a conflict, which is why they have been banned by international war regulations.

In November 2006 the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War
came into effect with 92 countries subscribing to the treaty that requires the parties involved in a conflict to assist with the removal of unexploded ordnance following the end of hostilities.

Some of the countries most affected by war debris are Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Iraq and Laos.

Similarly &quot;military debris&quot; may be found in and around firing range and military training areas.

Debris can also be used as cover for military purposes, depending on the situation.

==Culinary==
In South Louisiana&#x27;s Creole and Cajun cultures, debris (pronounced &quot;DAY-bree&quot;) refers to chopped organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, tripe, spleen, brain, lungs and pancreas.

<text>Mattias Klum (born 10 February 1968 in Uppsala) is a Swedish freelance photographer and film producer in natural history and cultural subjects. He is the son of Swedish academic educator Arne Klum (1925-2016) and Ingegärd Klum, née Stefanson. Klum has worked full-time as a freelance photographer since 1986, and as a cinematographer and director on numerous film and television projects since 1994. Klum describes and portrays animals, plants, and natural and cultural settings in the form of articles, books, films, lectures and exhibitions.

Klum has had several wildlife documentaries shown internationally and has also had his work featured in Wildlife Conservation, Audubon, &quot;Geo&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and the &quot;New York Times&quot; among others.

In 1997, National Geographic Magazine published Mattias Klum&#x27;s photographs for the first time, which made him the first Swede to have his work on the cover, then he was one of National Geographic&#x27;s youngest contributors. Since 1997, he has produced a number of articles and twelve cover stories for the magazine, including &quot;Malaysia&#x27;s Secret Realm&quot; (August 1997), &quot;Asia&#x27;s Last Lions&quot; (June 2001), &quot;Meerkats Stand Tall&quot; (September 2002), &quot;What Darwin Didn&#x27;t Know&quot; (February 2009) and &quot;The Bite That Heals&quot; (February 2013). Klum&#x27;s photographs have been exhibited in one-man shows at reputable museums and art galleries in the US, Sweden, Malaysia, India, Japan, Great Britain, Estonia, Denmark, Botswana, Spain, China and Singapore among other countries. Klum has published twelve books, five of them available in English: Exploring the Rainforest, Borneo Rainforest, Horse People, Being There and The Human Quest.

In 2007, Klum contributed to the starting of a publishing company, Tierra Grande Publishing, the fundraising Terra Magna Foundation and Expeditionsverige.se (Expedition Sweden), a five-year-long environment and inspiration project about Sweden and the Baltic Sea Media Project together with producer Folke Rydén. He has also coached and collaborated with Sweden&#x27;s Prince Carl Philip.

The book, The Human Quest: Prospering Within Planetary Boundaries, is co-authored by scientist and global sustainability expert Johan Rockström with a foreword by former President Bill Clinton.

<text>Simha Arom (born 16 August 1930) is a French-Israeli ethnomusicologist who is recognized as a world expert on the music of central Africa, especially that of the Central African Republic. His books include &quot;African Polyphony and Polyrhythm: Musical Structure and Methodology&quot; (1991) . He also made some historical field recordings of the Aka Pygmy music.

In the 1960s, Arom was sent by the Government of Israel to establish a brass band in the Central African Republic. He became fascinated by the traditional music of this country, especially the vocal polyphonies of the Aka Pygmies. He entered the CNRS in 1968 and in 1984 he received its Silver Medal. He did field work every year from 1971 to 1991, accompanied by ethnolinguists and students, to record this music to study it and preserve it. 
Arom was awarded a First Prize for French Horn at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique of Paris before becoming an ethnomusicologist. Using interactive experiments, he has worked on uncovering implicit musical systems and the way in which cultures build cognitive categories as attested in their music. His work is based on the postulate that, in order for it to be valid, data collected in the field must be corroborated by cognitive data specific to the holders of the culture studied.
His research topics include the temporal organization of music, musical scales, polyphonic techniques, music in the social system and the elaboration of conceptual tools for the categorization, analysis and modeling of traditional music. From a mostly descriptive discipline, he has tried to build a science in the full sense of the word, with all of its attributes: experimentation, verification, validation, modeling, conceptualization and reconstitution by means of synthesis.
He has been a visiting professor at many universities – particularly Montreal, UCLA, Vancouver, M.I.T., Cambridge (U.K.), Tel-Aviv, Bar-Ilan, Haifa, Basel, Zurich, Siena, and Venice, and his work has inspired contemporary composers such as Luciano Berio (Coro), György Ligeti, Steve Reich, Fabien Lévy and Fabian Panisello.
Arom is Research Director Emeritus at the CNRS, a founding member of the Société française d&#x27;ethnomusicologie, the Société française d&#x27;analyse musicale, the European Society for the Cognitive Sciences of Music (ESCOM) and the European Seminar in Ethnomusicology; he is also a member of the Société française de musicologie and the Board of directors of The Universe of Music project (UNESCO).
His sound archives were deposited in 2011 at the sound library of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Arom was the subject of the 2014 documentary SIMHA by Jerome Blumberg.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-25 (NATO designation Flashlight-A/Mandrake) is a swept wing, turbojet-powered interceptor and reconnaissance aircraft built by Yakovlev and used by the Soviet Union.

==Design and development==
The Yak-25 originated from a need for long-range Interceptor aircraft to protect the USSR&#x27;s northern and eastern territory. The specification for a two-seat, twin-engine jet fighter and a related reconnaissance aircraft was issued by Joseph Stalin on 6 August 1951.

=== Yak-120 ===
Yakovlev began developing a two-seat, twin-engine patrol interceptor, designated the Yak-120 by the design bureau, in 1951. It received official authorization by a directive of the Council of Ministers on 10 August of that year. In a break from previous Yakovlev designs, the Yak-120&#x27;s thin, mid-set wings were swept back at a 45 degree angle with large two-section flaps. To provide more directional stability, a ventral fin was attached below the swept cruciform tail. The aircraft was powered by two Mikulin AM-5 turbojets, mounted in nacelles that were attached directly to the undersurface of the wing.

The design maximized fuel capacity to provide greater endurance, resulting in the usage of a bicycle undercarriage with a single-wheel nose unit and a two-wheel main unit, augmented by outrigger struts mounted under the wingtips. The Yak-120 was configured to carry a conformal drop tank on the centerline of the fuselage to provide additional endurance.

The aircraft included an RP-6 Sokol radar in its nose, with the radar antenna dish enclosed by a bullet-shaped glass fiber radome. The Sokol could detect four engine bombers at 25 km and fighters at 16 km distance. It carried two crewmen, a pilot and a radar intercept operator, seated in tandem below a shared aft-sliding canopy. The radar intercept operator handled target searching and assisted the pilot in guiding the aircraft towards the target in unfavorable weather, and was able to fly the aircraft when required due to the aircraft&#x27;s dual controls, decreasing pilot fatigue on lengthy missions. The aircraft&#x27;s fixed windshield included a -thick bulletproof glass panel, while the rest of the aircraft was protected by all-round armor plates.

The aircraft was armed with two 37 mm NL-37L cannon, mounted low on the sides of the center fuselage. A supply of 50 rounds per gun was typically carried, although the ammunition boxes could contain twice as much. Under the wings was provision for two ARS-212 unguided rockets. The aircraft&#x27;s avionics allowed it to navigate and intercept its targets in all weather conditions at altitudes up to its service ceiling. As well as the radar, the aircraft was equipped with an SRO-1 IFF transponder, an RSIU-3 Klyon VHF radio, and an AP-28 autopilot. To set up an automatic landing approach in bad weather, the Yak included a Materik (Russian for continent) Instrument landing system. The Pozitron-1 system completed the aircraft&#x27;s avionics systems, and was likely a command link system.

The aircraft&#x27;s wings, tail unit, and air intakes were equipped with hot air de-icing, while the foreign object damage protection screens and intake center-bodies of the engines were de-iced electrically, enabling the Yak to remain at colder high altitudes for longer times and to operate in regions with a cold climate. Despite its complex and heavy avionics, the aircraft had a lightweight airframe for a twin-engined fighter, due to a design that reduced structural weight to the minimum. Two prototypes and a static test mockup were built by Yakovlev. The first prototype flew on 19 June 1952, piloted by Yakovlev test pilot Valentin Volkov. Manufacturer testing continued until November.

The Yak-120 exceeded the Air Force specific operational requirements in all aspects except for speed and range. Its 3-hour and 45 minute endurance without a drop tank (4 hours and 15 minutes with tank) and 2,800 km range on internal fuel at 12,000 m altitude allowed it to fly long-range patrols. Being smaller and lighter, it surpassed the performance of the competing Lavochkin La-200B. However, the aircraft could not be submitted for state acceptance trials due to delays in the development of the RP-6 radar. As a result, the RP-1 Izumrood radar was fitted as a temporary substitute in early December. The Yak-120 was tested at the Scientific Research Institute of the Air Force (NII VVS) with the RP-1 between May and June 1953. With mostly positive results, the aircraft was authorized for production with the service designation Yak-25. The test results from the NII VVS were approved as specifications for the Yak-25 by a Council of Ministers directive on 8 September.

=== Production and Yak-25M ===
The Yak-25s were built at Factory No. 292 in Saratov, with the first aircraft completed in September 1954. Due to slight modifications, the radar of these aircraft was known as the RP-1D. However, very few aircraft were built to the original standards, due to the fact that the RP-6 had been fully developed by the end of 1953. In April 1954, a Yak-120 prototype with the RP-6 passed its state acceptance trials, and on 13 May the Council of Ministers approved the production of the modified version with the designation Yak-25M. In addition to the radar, this version also incorporated several changes – the AM-5A Srs 1 turbojets were replaced with RD-5A (AM-5A) Srs 2 engines with the same rating, the wheelbase was increased by moving the nose gear unit 33 cm forward to improve directional stability during takeoff and landing, and the cannons were fitted with muzzle brakes. 406 Yak-25Ms were built at the Saratov factory, with deliveries beginning in January 1955. RAF RPF ELINT flights from October 1956 indicated that the Yak-25M had entered service, but that height-finding by ground-based radars was poor and so interception was ineffective above 35,000 feet.

=== Further Yak-120 development ===
In September 1953, after the first stage of the Yak-120&#x27;s state acceptance trials concluded, the second Yak-120 prototype was re-engined with the new Mikulin AM-9A turbojet, an improved version of the AM-5. Rocket pods for ARS-57 Skvorets folding-fin aircraft rockets were added, intended for use against enemy bomber formations. A modified RP-6 known as the Sokol-M was also to be added, and what was designated the Yak-120M was to begin its state acceptance trials in September 1954. Due to delays occasioned by the late delivery of the engines and lack of radar, the aircraft was not completed until the end of 1954, and was instead equipped with a standard RP-6. In November, the first stage of the state acceptance trials (with the standard RP-6 and no FFARs) was postponed until January 1955, but by March of that year the aircraft was planned to be ready for the second stage, with the Sokol-M and FFARs. The same directive that changed the schedule also specified that the TRS-190 rocket be used as alternate armament. To allow for the increased weight of the rockets, lighter Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannons replaced the N-37Ls.

The first stage of the state acceptance trials of the Yak-120M were completed on schedule in January 1955; the second stage began in March and concluded in late April. However, the aircraft&#x27;s performance was slightly short of the operational requirements, and the failure to complete the Sokol-M, coupled with a need for supersonic interceptors, forced abandonment of the Yak-120M. The prototype was used as a testbed for RD-9F engines under the designation Yak-120MF.

In 1955 and 1956 several Yak-25Ms were refitted as testbeds for air-to-air missile armament.

=== Yak-125, Yak-25R, and Yak-25MR ===

A two-seat tactical reconnaissance aircraft prototype, the Yak-125, was developed in tandem with the Yak-120. In order to make room for two AKAFU automatic tilting camera mounts installed next to each other, the radar was removed and the nose extended slightly. The mounts carried AFA-33/100M, AFA-33/75M, or AFA-33/50M vertical photographic cameras. A flexible oblique camera mount with an AFA-33/75M or AFA-22/50M camera was positioned forward in order to cover the port and starboard areas. The ports were protected by hinged doors during take-off and landing; ports and cameras were controlled by the reconnaissance systems operator in the rear cockpit. The twin cannon of the Yak-120 were replaced by a single NR-23 with 80 rounds, positioned on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Yak-125&#x27;s internal fuel capacity was increased to .

The prototype was finished in August 1952, making its first flight on 26 August, with Volkov at its controls. It completed manufacturer flight tests in October 1953, and conducted state acceptance trials between December 1953 and February 1954. The Yak-125 outperformed the production Ilyushin Il-28R and Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15bisR, but the state commission recommended modifications and directed the construction of a small pre-production batch for service trials due to pilot and reconnaissance systems operator visibility limitations caused by the longer nose in the case of the former and the small ventral window for the latter.

As a result of the state commission&#x27;s comments, the Yak-125&#x27;s forward fuselage was redesigned. The reconnaissance systems operator was moved to a compartment in the nose, in which oblique and vertical cameras were installed in front of the seat. Cameras were also located in the center fuselage, although the remainder of the aircraft was unchanged from the Yak-125. The modified aircraft was designated the Yak-25R. By a Council of Ministers directive of 10 March 1955, which was followed on the next day by an order of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, Yakovlev and Factory No. 292 in Saratov were tasked with building ten pre-production aircraft. The aircraft did not enter production, however, due to its obsolescence, Yakovlev&#x27;s later supersonic reconnaissance aircraft, which was ready for testing, and the introduction of the Il-28R as the main reconnaissance aircraft of the Soviet Air Forces.

Yakovlev was tasked by a Council of Ministers Directive of 18 September 1954 and a Ministry of Aircraft Production order issued three days later with developing a fast maritime reconnaissance version of the Yak-25, designated the Yak-25MR. The aircraft was to fill a requirement for a maritime reconnaissance aircraft from Soviet Naval Aviation, and was required to match or exceed Yak-25 performance, commencing State acceptance trials in February 1955.

=== Yak-125B ===
Yakovlev was tasked with developing a high-speed nuclear bomber using the basic Yak-125 design, the Yak-125B, by a special joint directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers. The Yak-125B was intended to break through enemy air defenses and conduct a nuclear strike against strategic targets in the enemy rear. It had a crew of two; the navigator, who doubled as the bombardier, was seated in a compartment in the extreme nose. The nuclear bomb was housed in a bomb bay near the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity, which resulted in the nose unit of the undercarriage receiving twin wheels of similar size to the main unit, which was moved just aft of the bomb bay. This arrangement was later used on Yakovlev tactical bombers, including the Yak-28. Yak-125B was the first Yakovlev aircraft to include a 360-degree ground mapping and bomb-aiming radar, the RMM-2 Rubidiy, located in a radome directly below the cockpit. The aircraft entered flight testing in 1955, and the production version was planned to be designated the Yak-25B. However, it never entered production due to obsolescence and Yakovlev&#x27;s testing of a superior supersonic nuclear bomber, the Yak-26.

=== Yak-25RV ===
A reconnaissance derivative of the Yak-25, the Yak-25RV (&quot;Razvedchick Vysotnyj&quot;, &quot;high-altitude reconnaissance&quot;), was developed in 1959 (NATO codename &#x27;Mandrake&#x27;). It had a completely new, long-span straight wing of 23.4 meters (more than twice that of the Yak-25M interceptor) with a total area of 55 square meters. Camera and sensor packs were added in the fuselage. Some versions may have retained one cannon.
Despite its low wing loading, the &#x27;Mandrake&#x27;s&#x27; altitude performance was marginal at best, with considerable engine problems at high altitudes, excessive vibration, and primitive equipment that imposed high workloads for the crews. The Soviet Air Force nevertheless kept the Yak-25RV in service until 1974. A few were used in the late 1970s for monitoring of radioactive contamination, with specialized sensors; these were designated Yak-25RRV. Efforts in 1971 to develop the &#x27;Mandrake&#x27; as a high-altitude interceptor (Yak-25PA) proved unsuccessful.

In 1961 a series of lightened &#x27;Mandrakes&#x27; were produced as high-altitude target drones. The Yak-25RV-I was used as a manned target for unarmed (no live fire) interception practice, the Yak-25RV-II as a remote-piloted drone.

===Yak-26===
The derivative Yak-26 was developed as a bomber, but only nine were built.

==Operational history==
The Yak-25 was first displayed at Tushino Airfield in July 1955, and received the NATO reporting name Flashlight, which was subsequently changed to Flashlight-A when the Yak-26 and Yak-27 were reported. They started to equip air defence units from 1955. They were considered easy to fly and popular among the crews. Engine breakdowns were quite common, mostly due to the low engine position when on the ground, which demanded clean airfields, but thanks to twin-engine arrangement, few such failures were fatal.

Due to its twin engines and radar intercept operator, pilots gained more confidence on long missions in the remote northern and eastern areas of the Soviet Union.

In 1955, 108 pilots and 95 ground crewmen finished conversion training on the Yak-25M at the Savasleyka PVO Training and Methodical Center. As it was intended for low-altitude flying, the Yak-25&#x27;s service ceiling was too low to intercept the American RB-47 Stratojet, which often flew reconnaissance missions over Soviet territory.

Their withdrawal started in 1963. The last Yak-25 interceptors were retired by 1967; the &#x27;Mandrake&#x27; reconnaissance version soldiered on in various roles through the late 1970s. Like many other PVO interceptors of the Cold War era, the Yak-25M was not exported to the Warsaw Pact or other nations.

<text>The Chilcotin Group, also called the Chilcotin Plateau Basalts, is a large area of basaltic lava that forms a volcanic plateau running parallel with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in south-central British Columbia, Canada.

Predominantly, during Miocene and Pliocene times, a medium-sized volcanic field of overlapping vents occurred in British Columbia&#x27;s Interior Plateau. The distribution is assumed to engulf up to 50,000 km2 of the Pacific Northwest, forming a medium-sized large igneous province, of volume 3300 km3. Volcanism occurred as late as Oligocene time, but continues sporadically up to present. Eruptions were most vigorous 6-10 million years ago and 2-3 million years ago, when most of the basalt was released. Less extensive eruptions continued 0.01 to 1.6 million years ago.

These lava flows have been dominantly exposed by erosion resulting from the great floods that flowed in this region throughout the past ice ages, which laid bare many layers of the basalt flows along the Fraser Canyon from Soda Creek south to Canoe Creek elsewhere along the Chilcotin, Chilko, Chilanko and Taseko Rivers, and also to the east of the Fraser River at Chasm Provincial Park and along the Upper Deadman River. Prior to Late Pleistocene glacial erosion these centers formed a series of coalesced, low-profile shield volcanoes of unknown volume and distribution.

The Chilcotin Group were thought to potentially be linked to the partly coeval Columbia River Basalt Group. However, its morphology and geochemistry have been proven much similar to other volcanic plateaus such as the Snake River Plain in Idaho and parts of Iceland (Bevier, 1983).

==Formation of the Chilcotin Plateau Basalts==

The distribution and volume of the Chilcotin Group is unknown due to extensive Pleistocene glacial cover. This presumably glacial &quot;drift&quot; is very thick, and in most regions completely obscures the volcanism. Individual vents for basalt volcanism include small cinder cones, volcanic plugs, and gabbroic feeders, which locally crosscut lava flows. Recent studies indicate that the volume of the Chilcotin Group is much less than previously thought, and that the &quot;Plateau&quot; is likely Eocene in age. This means that the Chilcotin is likely composed of many local volcanic vents, that were of small volumes that fed into the paleo-landscape, and subsequently are found in the major river systems that we see at present.

Prior to 16 million years ago, the western Cascade Volcanic Arc stratovolcanoes erupted with periodic regularity for over 27 million years, even as they do today. The ultimate cause of this volcanism is still up for debate, however, the most widely accepted idea is that a back-arc basin behind the Cascadia subduction zone initiated the widespread and voluminous basaltic volcanism. Some centers erupted along pre-existing brittle fault systems while volcanism along its northern portion is most widely believed to have been related to a centre of upwelling magma called the Anahim hotspot (similar to that associated with present-day Hawaii), creating the Rainbow, Ilgachuz and Itcha Range shield volcanoes which also in turn form part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. The exact nature of the relationship between the Anahim hotspot and the Chilcotin Group is unknown, however.

<text>Edward Christian Prescott (December 26, 1940 – November 6, 2022) was an American economist. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2004, sharing the award with Finn E. Kydland, &quot;for their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles&quot;. This research was primarily conducted while both Kydland and Prescott were affiliated with the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (now Tepper School of Business) at Carnegie Mellon University. According to the IDEAS/RePEc rankings, he was the 19th most widely cited economist in the world in 2013. In August 2014, Prescott was appointed an Adjunct Distinguished Economic Professor at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Australia. Prescott died of cancer on November 6, 2022, at the age of 81.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Prescott was born in Glens Falls, New York, to Mathilde Helwig Prescott and William Clyde Prescott. In 1962, he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics from Swarthmore College, where he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He then received a master&#x27;s degree from Case Western Reserve University in operations research in 1963, and a PhD in economics at Carnegie Mellon University in 1967.

=== Career ===
From 1966 to 1971, Prescott taught at the University of Pennsylvania. He then returned to Carnegie Mellon until 1980, when he moved to the University of Minnesota, where he taught until 2003. In 1978, he was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago, where he was named a Ford Foundation Research Professor. In the following year, he visited Northwestern University and stayed there until 1982. From 2003 on he taught at Arizona State University.

Prescott was an economic advisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis since 1981. In 2004, he held the Maxwell and Mary Pellish Chair in Economics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2006, he held the Shinsei Bank Visiting Professorship at New York University. In August 2014, Prescott was appointed an Adjunct Distinguished Professor at Research School of Economics (RSE) of the Australian National University.

The Research Papers in Economics project ranked him as the 19th most influential economist in the world as of August 2012 based on his academic contributions. More recently working as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and as a professor at Arizona State University&#x27;s W. P. Carey School of Business, he was a major figure in macroeconomics, especially the theories of business cycles and general equilibrium. In his &quot;Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans,&quot; published in 1977 with Finn E. Kydland, he analyzed whether central banks should have strict numerical targets or be allowed to use their discretion in setting monetary policy. He is also well known for his work on the Hodrick–Prescott filter, used to smooth fluctuations in a time series.

=== Nobel Prize ===
Prescott and Finn Kydland received the Nobel prize for economics based on two papers they authored. In the first paper, written in 1977 &quot;Rules Rather than Discretion: The inconsistency of optimal planning&quot; Prescott and Kydland argue that purpose and goals of economic planning and policy is to trigger a desired response from the economy. However, Prescott and Kydland realized that these sectors are made up of individuals, individuals who make assumptions and predictions about the future. As Prescott and Kydland stated &quot;Even if there is a fixed and agreed upon social objective function and policy makers know the timing and magnitude of the effects of their actions... correct evaluation of the end-of-point position does not result in the social objective being maximized.&quot; Prescott and Kyland were pointing out that agents in the economy already factor into their decision making the assumed response by policy makers to a given economic climate.

Additionally Prescott and Kydland felt that the policy makers due to their relationship with government suffered from a credibility issue. The reason for this dynamic is that the political process is designed to fix problems and benefit its citizens today. Prescott and Kydland demonstrated this with a simple yet convincing example. In this example they take an area that has been shown likely to flood (a flood plain) and the government has stated that the &quot;socially optimal outcome&quot; is to not have houses be built in that area and therefore the government states that it will not provide flood protection (dams, levees, and flood insurance) rational agents will not live in that area. However, rational agents are forward planning creatures and know that if they and others build
houses in the flood plain the government which makes decisions based on current situations will then provide flood protection in the future. While Prescott never used these words he was describing a moral hazard.

The second paper, written in 1982, &quot;Time to Build and Aggregate Fluctuations,&quot; Prescott and Kydland argued that shifts in supply typically caused by changes and improvements in technology accounted for &quot;Not only long term increases in living standards but also to many of the short term fluctuations in business cycles.&quot; To study this hypothesis Prescott established a model to study the change in output, investment, consumption, labor productivity, and employment, between the end of the Second World War and 1980. Using this model the two economists were able to correlate 70% of the fluctuation in output to changes and growth in technology. Their main contribution, however, was the way of modeling macroeconomic variables with microfoundations.

=== Political activity ===
In January 2009 Prescott, along with more than 250 other economists and professors, signed an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama opposing the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The letter was sponsored by libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, and was printed as a paid advertisement in several newspapers including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Arizona Republic&quot;.

His late writings focused on the negative effect of taxes on the economy in Europe.

<doc id="1045187" wikidata="Q742887" url="?curid=1045187" title="Cinematronics">
<text>Cinematronics Incorporated was an arcade game developer that primarily released vector graphics games in the late 1970s and early 1980s. While other companies released games based on raster displays, early in their history, Cinematronics and Atari, Inc. released vector-display games, which offered a distinctive look and a greater graphic capability (at the time), at the cost of being only black and white (initially). Cinematronics also published &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Lair&quot; in 1983, the first major LaserDisc video game.

== History ==
Cinematronics Inc. was founded on April 1, 1975, by two players of the San Diego Chargers football team, Dennis Partee and Gary Garrison, as well as Jimmie Dale “Jim” Pierce (1937–2011) in San Diego, California. Garrison initially served as president until Pierce assumed that role. The company first entered the market creating clones of &quot;Pong&quot;, selling them in the local area. Their first game offered nationally was &quot;Flipper Ball&quot; (1976) followed by &quot;Embargo&quot; (1977). The company struggled to stay afloat and in 1977 Garrison sold his share to mortgage broker Ralph Clarke.

=== Vector Games ===
At the end of 1977, Cinematronics released the game &quot;Space Wars&quot;, developed by independent game developer Larry Rosenthal. The game was a TTL-based recreation of the mainframe game &quot;Spacewar!&quot; which ran using a custom vector monitor display. Cinematronics, approaching bankruptcy, agreed to manufacture the game in exchange for a five percent royalty on each cabinet to Rosenthal.

&quot;Space Wars&quot; was first shown at the Amusement and Music Operators of America show in October 1977, but Cinematronics was not ready to produce it. They brought in manufacturing expert Ken Beuck who had worked at Atari Inc. and salesman Bill Cravens to help sell the game. To finance the operation and keep the company from dissolving, San Diego coin-op operator Thomas B. Stroud bought out Partee&#x27;s share in the company.

When the first units were shipped at the end of 1977, &quot;Space Wars&quot; was the first commercially available video game using vector graphics, which enabled a higher resolution display than raster graphics of the time. The game became the best-selling coin-operated video game of 1978 and sold around 7,000 units. The success helped save Cinematronics, but Rosenthal along with Bill Cravens were discontented with the company. In April 1978, Rosenthal left the company to found a new operation called Sunrise Research in Northern California. At the behest of his lawyer, he took with him all the documentation necessary to create vector games on his hardware system. Cinematronics retained a licensing agreement to create games using Larry Rosenthal&#x27;s patents for his vector hardware, but was deprived on the knowledge to do so. Rosenthal&#x27;s company was eventually renamed Vectorbeam, a marketing name that had been used for the technology at Cinematronics.

Luckily, Cinematronics managed to continue creating games due to two bits of happenstance. Firstly, an engineer named Bob Long had copied the operational codes for Rosenthal&#x27;s system. Second, Rosenthal had evaluated a new employee named Tim Skelly prior to his departure. Skelly arrived at Cinematronics after Rosenthal had left and developed their first new game after the departure, with the help of technical engineers Dennis Halverson and Rob Patton.

Throughout 1978, Cinematronics experienced a realignment of management. Ralph Clarke departed the company and Tom Stroud&#x27;s son Tom A Stroud took on the responsibility of salesman. Pierce briefly stepped down as president before reassuming the role. The company did not release any product that year, but debuted Tim Skelly&#x27;s first game for them, &quot;Starhawk&quot; (1979), at the Amusement Trade Expo (ATE) in January 1979. Released in March, the game was successful, outcompeting the offering by Vectorbeam, &quot;Speed Freak&quot; (1979).

Jim Pierce and Tom Stroud kept in communication with Rosenthal to convince them to sell his patents to them. After little more than a year of independence, Vectorbeam was sold to Cinematronics along with the rights to his two patents on vector game technology on June 1, 1979. Vectorbeam became a subsidiary, with Tom A Stroud as the President and Tim Skelly as head of product development. Rosenthal continued developing games including &quot;Tail Gunner&quot; (1979) and the unreleased &quot;Oops!&quot; (1979) before departing the company. He later sued Cinematronics for payment of his contractual buyout of his patents.

Vectorbeam served as an alternative factory and label for Cinematronics products through the rest of 1979. &quot;Barrier&quot; (1979) and &quot;Warrior&quot; (1979) were released under the Vectorbeam name. In November 1979, Cinematronics sold the Vectorbeam factory and assets to Exidy Inc. who relabeled them as Exidy II. Through this, Exidy gained the rights to develop vector games after their release of &quot;Tailgunner&quot; as &quot;Tailgunner II&quot;. A few Vectorbeam staff took positions at Cinematronics in San Diego.

In 1980, Cinematronics began exploiting their rights to the vector game patents more readily. They sued Atari Inc. for their creation of games like &quot;Lunar Lander&quot; and &quot;Asteroids&quot; with their own vector system. The case was eventually settled out of court. They began licensing their games to be produced in the cocktail table format by Rock-Ola, who used their license to develop vector games &quot;Demon!&quot; (1982) and &quot;QB-3&quot; (1982). They later gained a landmark judgement in video game copyright when they halted the sale of illegal copies of &quot;Star Castle&quot; (1980).

&quot;Star Castle&quot; was co-developed by Skelly and new programmer Scott Boden. It became Cinematronics’ most successful game, selling over 10,000 units and remaining in production over most of 1981. A dispute between Skelly and Cinematronics management led to his departure from the company. He was then hired by Sega/Gremlin, who was also developing vector games, inciting Cinematronics to sue Gremlin and Skelly personally over alleged theft of trade secrets.

The company moved into a newly built 78,000 sq ft facility on 1841 Friendship Drive in El Cajon in June 1981. After releasing the last game developed by Skelly for them, &quot;Armor Attack&quot; (1981), Cinematronics struggled to find new product to fill their factory. Scott Boden developed &quot;Solar Quest&quot; (1981) to fill a slot after &quot;Star Castle&quot;’s production had ceased but failed to find the same success. They attempted to formalize product development, bringing in official managers to set deadlines as well as leading to them developing a tank gunner simulator under a military contract. Their development of a color vector hardware resulted in the release of the unsuccessful &quot;Boxing Bugs&quot; (1982).

=== Bankruptcy and LaserDisc Games ===
Former Vice President of Finance of the company, Fred Fukumoto, assumed the Presidency of Cinematronics from Jim Pierce in January 1982. Fukumoto&#x27;s plan for assuring product flow into the company was to license video games from Japanese companies, similar to how Midway had found success with the likes of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;. They imported the games &quot;Naughty Boy&quot; (1982) and &quot;Jack the Giantkiller&quot; (1982) which were both unsuccessful. They canceled many projects including their military contract. In August 1982, they were foreclosed on by Security Pacific Bank and entered Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Fukumoto left the company and Pierce resumed duties as president.

Still operating in bankruptcy, they maintained a small internal development team – developing the game &quot;Cosmic Chasm&quot; (1983) – and started a partnership with the company Advanced Microcomputer Systems. After releasing the game &quot;Zzyzzyxx&quot; (1982), AMS convinced Cinematronics to manufacture their proposed Laserdisc game, &quot;Dragon’s Lair&quot; (1983), in partnership with Don Bluth Productions. The heads of all three companies formed the entity Starcom to control the rights for the game and any subsequent Laserdisc game releases. Cinematronics organized the production of the game and rode a wave of massive interest to success. &quot;Dragon’s Lair&quot; kept the company out of bankruptcy and gave them a national profile as leaders in video game technology.

By the time of the follow-up to Dragon&#x27;s Lair, &quot;Space Ace&quot; (1984), the partnership between the companies had fallen apart. The collapse of Laserdisc games and the diverging interests of AMS and Don Bluth Productions led them away from developing more games together. Cinematronics location tested &quot;Dragon’s Lair II: Time Warp&quot;, but did not release it at the time. It would eventually be the final arcade release of The Leland Corporation in 1991.

=== Raster Games and Cinemat System ===
Still in bankruptcy, Cinematronics reformed its internal development structure. They abandoned the development of the vector game technology and started creating their own raster games again for the first time since &quot;Embargo&quot;. Many of the developers came from Sega/Gremlin, another San Diego company who had recently shed their internal development apparatus. Starting with &quot;Freeze&quot; (1984), they rebuilt their game-making capacity.

In 1985, Cinematronics introduced the Cinemat system hardware. Part of a trend which included the Nintendo VS System, Capcom&#x27;s CPS, and later Neo Geo, the Cinemat was a standardized cabinet which allowed operators to change out their current games for a fraction of the price of a full upright cabinet. The software, marquee, and control panel could be changed out of a standard housing. Their first release &quot;Cerberus&quot; (1985) was followed by more, including &quot;World Series: The Season&quot; (1985). &quot;World Series&quot; was a huge technological leap and a significant hit for the company after the Golden Age of Arcade Video Games.

None of their follow-up products from &quot;World Series&quot; were nearly as successful and the company remained in Chapter 11 bankruptcy – reportedly the longest in the history of California. Jim Pierce felt that he needed to sell the company to keep it operation, so he sold the company on March 30, 1987, to Tradewest, an arcade game licensor and manufacturer operated by Leland Cook, Byron Cook, and John Rowe. Cinematronics was taken through bankruptcy, with Tradewest acquiring all of the assets and reforming them as The Leland Corporation. The legal entity of Cinematronics was dissolved on October 21, 1987.

=== Legacy ===
In bringing vector graphics to the coin-op industry with &quot;Space Wars&quot;, Cinematronics helped to inaugurate an entirely different type of arcade game. Large video game manufacturers like Atari, Midway, and Sega/Gremlin all created vector games after viewing the success of Cinematronics. Developments in 3D-based vector hardware, as in Atari&#x27;s &quot;Battlezone&quot;, also provided the technological basis for some of the earliest games with three-dimensional graphics in the arcade.

Cinematronics’ other major innovation, the Laserdisc game in &quot;Dragon’s Lair&quot;, has been seen as a landmark moment in the evolution of multimedia. Though the game was criticized for its lack of interactivity, it was the first commercially successful game incorporating traditional audio-visual elements with video game mechanics. Subsequent versions of &quot;Dragon’s Lair&quot; and &quot;Space Ace&quot; were ported and converted to various home systems in the 1980s and 1990s, though they did not contain the Cinematronics branding.

Games like &quot;Warrior&quot; and &quot;Rip Off&quot; have been praised as innovative takes on arcade gameplay, showing early stages of fighting games and co-operative gameplay, respectively. &quot;Star Castle&quot;, &quot;Armor Attack&quot;, and &quot;World Series: The Season&quot; have been considered among the best arcade games of all time.

Many of Cinematronics’ games received ports to the Vectrex home console under license. One of the original Vectrex titles, &quot;Cosmic Chasm&quot; (1982), was converted into an arcade game by Cinematronics.

The rights to Cinematronics’ titles were retained by Midway Games after their purchase of Tradewest in 1994. Tim Skelly was asked to sign a legally binding agreement to give the rights to his games developed at Cinematronics to Midway.

<text>In optics, a perfect mirror is a mirror that reflects light (and electromagnetic radiation in general) perfectly, and does not transmit or absorb it.

==General==
Domestic mirrors are not perfect mirrors as they absorb a significant portion of the light which falls on them.

Dielectric mirrors are glass or other substrates on which one or more layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. A very complex dielectric mirror can reflect up to 99.999% of the light incident upon it, for a narrow range of wavelengths and angles. A simpler mirror may reflect 99.9% of the light, but may cover a broader range of wavelengths.

Almost any dielectric material can act as a perfect mirror through total internal reflection. This effect only occurs at shallow angles, however, and only for light inside the material. The effect happens when light goes from a medium with a higher index of refraction to one with a lower value (like air).

A new type of dielectric &quot;perfect mirror&quot; was developed in 1998 by researchers at MIT. These unusual mirrors are very efficient reflectors over a broad range of angles and wavelengths, and are insensitive to polarization. A version of the perfect mirror that was developed at MIT for military use is used by OmniGuide in laser surgery.

<doc id="1045201" wikidata="Q211457" url="?curid=1045201" title="Pinus halepensis">
<text>Pinus halepensis, commonly known as the Aleppo pine, also known as the Jerusalem pine, is a pine native to the Mediterranean region. It was officially named by the botanist Philip Miller in his 1768 book &quot;The Gardener&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;; he probably never went to Aleppo but mentions seeing large specimens at Goodwood in the garden of the Duke of Richmond, which were transplanted (perhaps sent by Alexander Russell from Syria) in 1739.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; is a small to medium-sized tree, tall, with a trunk diameter up to , exceptionally up to . The bark is orange-red, thick, and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, and thin and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are very slender, long, distinctly yellowish green, and produced in pairs (rarely a few in threes). The cones are narrow conic, long and broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy red-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next few years, a process quickened if they are exposed to heat such as in forest fires. The cones open wide to allow the seeds to disperse. The seeds are long, with a wing, and are wind-dispersed.

=== Related species ===
The Aleppo pine is closely related to the Turkish pine, Canary Island pine, and maritime pine, which all share many of its characteristics. Some authors include the Turkish pine as a subspecies of the Aleppo pine, as &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; subsp. &quot;brutia&quot; (Ten.) Holmboe, but it is usually regarded as a distinct species. It is a relatively nonvariable species, in that its morphological characteristics stay constant over the entire range.

==Distribution and habitat==
The native range of &quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; extends from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Spain north to southern France, Malta, Italy, Croatia, Montenegro, and Albania, and east to Greece. It has been introduced into many parts of the world, including Portugal. There is an outlying population (from which it was first described) in Syria, Lebanon, southern Turkey, Jordan, Israel and Palestine.

The species is generally found at low altitudes, mostly from sea level to , but can grow above in southern and eastern Spain, well over on Crete, and up to in the south, in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.
The tree is able to quickly colonize open and disturbed areas. It is classed as an invasive species in South Africa. It can grow on all substrates and almost in all bioclimates in the Mediterranean.

&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; is a diagnostic species of the vegetation class &quot;Pinetea halepensis&quot;.

==Uses==
The resin of the Aleppo pine is used to flavor the Greek wine retsina.

From the pine nuts of the Aleppo pine is made a pudding called &quot;asidet zgougou&quot; in the Tunisian dialect; it is served in bowls, covered with cream, and topped with almonds and small candies.

The Maltese dessert &quot;prinjolata&quot; is also prepared using these pine nuts, both in its filling as well as a topping.

Aleppo pine are used for bonsai.

===Forestry===
In its native area, &quot;P. halepensis&quot; is widely planted for its fine timber, making it one of the most important forestry trees in Algeria and Morocco.

In Israel, natural patches of Aleppo pine forests can be found in the Carmel and Galilee regions. The Aleppo pine, along with &quot;Pinus brutia&quot;, has been planted extensively by the Jewish National Fund. It proved very successful in Yatir Forest in the northern Negev (on the edge of the desert), where foresters had not expected it to survive. Many Aleppo pine forests exist today in Israel and are used for recreational purposes. Although it is a local species, some argue that the historical replacement of natural oak maquis shrubland and garrigue with tall stands of pine has created &quot;ecological deserts&quot; and has significantly changed the species assemblage of these regions. The species produces timber which is valued for its hardness, density and unproblematic seasoning. Seasoned timber is inclined to tear out with planing, but this can be avoided by using sharp blades or adjusting the sharpening angle of tools.

The Aleppo pine is considered an invasive species though useful in South Africa; in South Australia, a control program is in place on Eyre Peninsula.

===Landscape===
&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot; is a popular ornamental tree, extensively planted in gardens, parks, and private and agency landscapes in hot dry areas such as Southern California and the Karoo in South Africa, where the Aleppo pine&#x27;s considerable heat and drought tolerance, fast growth, and aesthetic qualities are highly valued.

==In culture==
Paul Cézanne had an Aleppo pine in his garden at Aix-en-Provence; this tree was the inspiration and model for his painting &quot;The Big Trees&quot;. As of 2005, the tree is still growing in Cézanne&#x27;s garden.

The Aleppo pine is associated with ANZAC Day and the ANZACs in Australia due to its use by soldiers in the Battle of Lone Pine during the Gallipoli campaign. It is often planted at war memorials.

<text>Carl Dahlhaus (10 June 1928 – 13 March 1989) was a German musicologist who was among the leading postwar musicologists of the mid to late 20th-century. A prolific scholar, he had broad interests though his research focused on 19th- and 20th-century classical music, both areas in which he made significant advancements. However, he remains best known in the English-speaking world for his writings on Wagner. Dahlhaus wrote on many other composers, including Josquin, Gesualdo, Bach and Schoenberg.

He spent the bulk of his career as head of Technische Universität Berlin&#x27;s musicology department, which he raised to an international standard. Dahlhaus pioneered the development of numerous musicological fields, particularly the aesthetics of music, which he raised to a central status. Active as a historian, analyst, editor and organizer, he was massively influential and his work has since incited considerable discussion and debate.

==Life and career==
Dahlhaus was born in Hanover on 10 June 1928. The Second World War interrupted his early education; he served on the front and as an anti-aircraft auxiliary. He completed school exams through a special program designed for those engaged in combat. After a brief stint studying law, Dahlhaus first engaged in musicology from 1947 to 1952, studying with Wilibald Gurlitt at the University of Freiburg and Rudolf Gerber at the University of Göttingen. His 1953 dissertation at the latter concerned the masses of Josquin des Prez. Instead of seeking an academic career, he engaged in the theatre and journalism worlds. Having begun as a student, he worked as dramaturg for the Deutsches Theater in Göttingen from 1950 to 1958; Bertolt Brecht had encouraged him to take the post. From 1960 to 1962 he worked as musical editor for the &quot;Stuttgarter Zeitung&quot; newspaper, acting as a relentless promoter of the Darmstadt school.

His first academic position came in 1962, when he served as a research assistant at the University of Kiel until 1966. That year he completed his a work for his Habilitation, &quot;Untersuchungen über die Entstehung der harmonischen Tonalität&quot; (&quot;Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality&quot;), published in 1968. The work was a seminal study on the origins of tonality, reaching back to the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Originally in German, Robert Gjerdingen has published a translated version in 1990 through the Princeton University Press. After working at Saarland University for less than a year, he was hired in 1967 to succeed Hans Heinz Stuckenschmidt as the head of the TU Berlin&#x27;s musicology department. He would remain there until his death, gradually expanding and developing the university&#x27;s previously minuscule musicology program to one of international renown. Though many universities offered him positions throughout his tenure, he rejected them all; the only exception was the two semesters he spent as a visiting professor at Princeton University.
Dahlhaus was honored with the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (Grand Cross with Star), a Blue Max, and accepted into the German Academy. In 1987, he was awarded the Frankfurter Musikpreis.

After being ill for some time—a sickness he mostly kept private from his colleagues—he died in Berlin on 13 March 1989, from kidney failure. He had been working on a succinct history of Western music in English at the time, which was left unfinished.

==Musicological scholarship==
Dahlhaus wrote 25 books, more than 400 articles, and contributed to 150 other works on a wide range of subjects. The majority of these were on the history of Western music and particularly that of the 19th century, i.e. Romantic music. Composers whose music he wrote on include Josquin, Gesualdo, Bach and Schoenberg. 19th- and 20th-century classical music were also regular topics. All of his major works were written in German; the history of Western music he left incomplete would have been his first English publication.

He was very interested in the work of Richard Wagner and remains best known English-speaking world for his writings on Wagner. Other topics he regularly engaged in include music theory, the aesthetics of music, and the prehistory of &quot;new music&quot;.

==Legacy==
Towards the end of his life, Dahlhaus was the most eminent and influential musicologist of his generation, with his works continuing to incite considerable discourse, discussion and controversy. He expressed himself not only as a musicologist, but as a historian, analyst, editor and organizer. His achievements include encouraging new interest in 19th-century music, particularly through his 1989 &quot;Nineteenth-Century Music&quot; publication.

His diverse interests allowed legitimized various musicological subfields, and broadened the discipline considerably. J. Bradford Robinson gives &quot;systematic musicology, institutional history [and] salon music&quot; as examples of newly accepted topics due to his influence. He was a principal proponent in raising aesthetics as a topic in the forefront of musicology. In addition, he helped establish a coherent narrative for 20th-century classical music.

<text>Harry Wu (; February 8, 1937 – April 26, 2016) was a Chinese-American human rights activist. Wu spent 19 years in Chinese labor camps, and he became a resident and citizen of the United States. In 1992, he founded the Laogai Research Foundation.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Wu was born into an affluent family in Shanghai; his father was a banking official and his mother had descended from a family of well-to-do landlords.

Wu studied at the Geology Institute in Beijing, where he earned a degree. In 1956, the Communist Party began a campaign encouraging citizens, particularly students and intellectuals, to express their true views of the Party and the state of society (known as the Hundred Flowers Campaign). Although cautious, Wu eventually voiced some sentiments, by disagreeing with the Soviet Union&#x27;s military intervention in Hungary, and the practice of labeling people into different categories.

By the Fall of 1956, China&#x27;s leader, Mao Zedong abruptly reversed course and proclaimed that the true enemies of the Party had been exposed and 19-year-old Wu was subsequently singled out at his university. Wu later wrote of this experience: &quot;This was the first time I had ever been singled out as a political troublemaker. Most of my classmates were more pragmatic than I, and they just repeated what the Communists wanted to hear.&quot; For the next few years, Wu was continuously criticized in Party meetings and closely monitored until his arrest in 1960 at the age of 23 when he was charged with being a &quot;counterrevolutionary rightist&quot;, and was sent to the &quot;laogai&quot; (China&#x27;s system of forced-labor prison camps).

===Labor camp years===
Harry Wu was imprisoned for 19 years in 12 different camps mining coal, building roads, clearing land, and planting and harvesting crops. According to his own accounts, he was beaten, tortured and nearly starved to death, and witnessed the deaths of many other prisoners from brutality, starvation, and suicide.

In the camps Wu met a rough, illiterate peasant with the nickname, &quot;Big Mouth Xing&quot;. Wu wrote, &quot;I could see how Big Mouth Xing had gotten his name. The corners of his mouth seemed to stretch all the way to his ears.&quot; Xing had experienced a lot of starvation in life, first in his rural village, and later in the camps, and had become obsessed with getting enough food.

Lean and muscular, with missing teeth and ears that &quot;looked black with dirt&quot;, Xing taught Wu how to fight for survival in the camps. He showed Wu how to dig for underground rat burrows in order to find clean caches of grain and beans which could then later be boiled for food to avoid starvation. He also taught Wu how to be aggressive to discourage bullies. Wu came from an urban, educated background and was naive. Xing often repeated to Wu, &quot;Nobody here will take care of you. You have to take care of yourself.&quot; Wu later wrote:

Wu was released from his life sentence in 1979 at the age of 42, as a result of political changes following the death of Mao Zedong. He obtained a teaching position at the Geoscience University in Beijing, but found that the label of having been a political prisoner continued to follow him. Wu also found that those who had played a part in labeling him &quot;an enemy of the people&quot;, leading to his imprisonment twenty years earlier, tended to react to his survival and return the same way: &quot;All that has happened is in the past ... the Party has suffered too.&quot;

Wu left China for the United States in 1985, after having received a chance invitation from the University of California at Berkeley to be a visiting scholar. (A faculty member at Berkeley had read an article that Wu had written in an academic journal on geology).

===Early years in the U.S.===
Wu arrived in the U.S. with only 40 dollars, a few clothes and an ink tiger print that he had inherited from his father. Since he did not have funding from the university for his first year he had to improvise. At first he was sleeping in the park, and on the Bay Area Rapid Transit when it rained. He got a night shift job making donuts at a donut shop for a few months; then a job at a liquor store, and was finally able to rent a cheap apartment. Wu continued with various odd jobs during this period and in 1988 began working for an electronic chip manufacturer, where he became an assistant manager, and was able to buy a used car. Looking back on this period of his life, Wu felt that there was opportunity and if he just worked hard he could make it.

During his first years in America, Wu did not want to think about or discuss politics. He felt that he had already lost the years of his youth and he wanted to establish a personal life and enjoy his freedom. But slowly he was drawn back into the discussion about prison camps in China and his own experiences. In 1986, Wu was asked to talk about his experiences in the camps in front of a class of college students at the University of California, Santa Cruz. As Wu spoke he started to cry as he felt he was being the voice for the many seemingly forgotten prisoners who had died.

===Focus on the &quot;laogai&quot; regime===
In 1988 Wu met with the curator of the East Asian Studies department at the Hoover Institution at Stanford to explain his interest in studying China&#x27;s network of forced-labor prison camps. Wu did not have academic experience in social studies, only that of a geologist, but his stories about his time in the camps intrigued the curator, who invited Wu to pursue research as a visiting scholar. From that time on, Wu started compiling a catalog of the labor prison camp system within mainland China. Known in China as the &quot;laogai&quot;, which translates as &quot;reform through labor&quot;, Wu eventually published &quot;Laogai: The Chinese Gulag&quot; in 1992. In the early 1990s, Wu made several trips into China in order to gather the evidence needed to prove the existence of the labor camps to the outside world — part of this involved visiting various camps and secretly recording images in photo and video.
In 1990, Senators Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) invited Wu to testify before the Senate on &quot;laogai&quot;. In 1991, Wu did a story with Ed Bradley for &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, in which they posed as businessmen interested in purchasing factory goods in mainland China that had been manufactured by the slave labor of Chinese prisoners.

In 1992, Wu established the Laogai Research Foundation, a non-profit research and public education organization, considered a leading source for information on China&#x27;s labor camps; and he was instrumental in proving that the organs of executed criminals were being used for organ transplants. Among Wu&#x27;s supporters was the AFL–CIO, America&#x27;s largest federation of labour unions. In addition, the center&#x27;s stated purpose is to also &quot;document and publicize other systemic human rights violations in China, including ... the coercive enforcement of China&#x27;s &#x27;one-child&#x27; population control policy, and Internet censorship and surveillance.&quot;

In 1995, by then a U.S. citizen, he was arrested as he tried to enter China with illegal documentation. He was held by the Chinese government for 66 days before he was convicted for &quot;stealing state secrets&quot;. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was instead immediately deported from China. He attributes his release to an international campaign launched on his behalf.

In 2007, Wu criticized the selection of a Chinese sculptor, Lei Yixin, as the lead sculptor for the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial because Lei had also carved statues celebrating Mao Zedong.

In November 2008, Wu opened the Laogai Museum in Washington, D.C., calling it the first United States museum to directly address human rights in China.

==Recognition==
Wu received the Freedom Award from the Hungarian Freedom Fighters&#x27; Federation in 1991. In 1994 he received the first Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders. He was awarded the Courage of Conscience Award by the Peace Abbey in Sherborn, Massachusetts, on September 14, 1995 for his extraordinary sacrifices and commitment to exposing human rights violations in his motherland China. He received an honorary doctorate from the Institute of World Politics in Washington, DC in 2012.

In 1996, he was awarded the Geuzenpenning, the Medal of Freedom from the Dutch World War II Resistance Foundation. He also received honorary degrees from Saint Louis University and the American University of Paris. That same year, the Columbia Human Rights Law Review awarded Wu its second Award for Leadership in Human Rights. In 1997, Wu was presented with the Walter Judd Freedom Award by The Fund for American Studies for being an outspoken voice against tyranny and oppression.

Wu served as the Executive Director of the Laogai Research Foundation and the China Information Center. He was also a member of the International Council of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation. He was a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

== Lawsuits ==
In 2007, Wu helped the relatives of Chinese dissidents Wang Xiaoning and Shi Tao sue Yahoo!, which had disclosed their IP addresses to the Chinese government, leading to their arrest and imprisonment. Yahoo settled the lawsuit by establishing a $17 million fund to compensate and help Chinese dissidents, and chose Wu as its administrator. In January 2011, Wang and his wife Yu Ling sued Wu, who allegedly demanded $1 million in kickbacks from Yu for his Laogai Research Foundation. Wu stated that Yu had willingly donated the money. The case was settled in April 2012 when Wu repaid the $1 million to Yu. Wu&#x27;s alleged mishandling of the millions from Yahoo alienated him from many in the human rights community. Seven Chinese dissidents signed an open letter stating that Wu had spent $14–15 million of the Yahoo fund from 2008 to 2015, but only $700,000 was used to help Chinese dissidents.

In March 2015, a Virginia woman named Wang Jing publicly accused Wu of sexually assaulting her and three underage girls, the daughters of Chinese dissidents who were under her guardianship, in late 2013. Wu denied the accusation. Wang filed a lawsuit against Wu with the Fairfax County Circuit Court, and the case was scheduled to go on trial in January 2017.

==Death==
Wu died in Honduras on April 26, 2016, at the age of 79 while he was vacationing there with friends. He was survived by his former wife, Ching Lee, and a son, Harrison.

<text>The Ukrainian Insurgent Army (, abbreviated UPA) was a Ukrainian nationalist partisan formation founded by the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) on 14 October 1942. During World War II, it was engaged in Nazi collaborationism. However, the UPA later launched guerrilla warfare against Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and both the Polish Underground State and Polish Communists. It conducted the massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, which are recognized by Poland as a genocide, and was involved in some acts of anti-Jewish violence.

The goal of the OUN was to drive out occupying powers in a national revolution and set up an independent government headed by a dictator; OUN accepted violence as a political tool against enemies of their cause. In order to achieve this goal, a number of partisan units were formed, merged into a single structure in the form of the UPA, which was created on 14 October 1942. From February 1943, the organization fought against the Germans in Volhynia and Polesia. At the same time, its forces fought an evenly matched war against the Polish resistance, during which the UPA carried out massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia, resulting in between 50,000 and 100,000 deaths. Soviet NKVD units fought against the UPA, which led armed resistance against Soviets until 1949. On the territory of Communist Poland, the UPA tried to prevent the forced deportation of Ukrainians from western Galicia to the Soviet Union until 1947.

The UPA was a decentralized movement widespread throughout Ukraine, divided into three operational regions; each region followed a somewhat different agenda, given the circumstances of a constantly moving front line and a double threat from Soviet and Nazi opponents. Not all UPA soldiers were members of the OUN or shared OUN&#x27;s ideology.

The UPA was formally disbanded in early September 1949, but some of its units continued operations until late 1956. Officially, the UPA&#x27;s last military engagement occurred in October 1956, when remnants of the group fought on the Hungarian border region in support of that country&#x27;s revolution. In March 2019, surviving UPA members were officially granted the status of veterans by the government of Ukraine.

== Organization ==

The UPA&#x27;s command structure overlapped with that of the OUN-B (the more radical faction of the OUN after it split in 1940); local OUN and UPA leaders were frequently the same person. The OUN&#x27;s military referents were the superiors of UPA unit commanders. The UPA was established in Volhynia and initially limited its activities to this region. Its first commander was the OUN military referent for Volhynia and Polesia, Vasyl Ivakhiv. In July, the UPA Supreme Command was organized with Dmytro Klyachkivsky at its head.

Organizationally, the UPA was divided into regions. the Western Operational Group operated in western Ukraine; the Southern Operational Group in the central-southern regions of Podolia and parts of Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Odesa oblasts; the Northern Operational Group in the northern regions of Volhynia, Rivne Oblast, and parts of Kyiv and Zhytomyr oblasts; in eastern Ukraine, the UPA fled north, as the Soviet Union had executed a number of the UPA&#x27;s participants. The members of the Eastern Operational Group joined other UPA units in Dnipropetrovsk and Chernihiv oblasts.

In November 1943, the UPA adopted a new structure, creating a Main Military Headquarters and the General Staff. Roman Shukhevych headed the HQ, while Dmytro Hrytsai became chief of staff. The General Staff consisted of operations, intelligence, logistics, personnel, training, political education, and military inspectors departments. In addition to the three regions named above, there was also an attempt to create a Eastern Operational Group, including Kyiv and Zhytomyr oblasts, but the project never came to fruition. Similarly, the UPA-South region ceased to exist in the summer of 1944, but continued to appear in documents. Three military schools for low-level command staff were also established.

The UPA&#x27;s largest unit type, the &quot;kurin&quot;, consisting of 500–700 soldiers, was equivalent to a battalion, and its smallest unit, the &quot;rii&quot; (literally bee swarm), with eight to ten soldiers, equivalent to a squad. Occasionally, and particularly in Volyn, during some operations three or more kurins would unite and form a &quot;zahin&quot; or brigade. Organizational methods were borrowed and adapted from the German, Polish and Soviet military, while UPA units based their training on a modified Red Army field unit manual.

In terms of UPA soldiers&#x27; social background, 60 percent were peasants of low to moderate means, 20 to 25 percent were from the working class (primarily from the rural lumber and food industries), and 15 percent were members of the intelligentsia (students, urban professionals). The latter group provided a large portion of the UPA&#x27;s military trainers and officer corps. The number of UPA fighters varied: a German Abwehr report from November 1943 estimated that the UPA had 20,000 soldiers; other estimates at that time placed the number at 40,000. By the summer of 1944, estimates of UPA membership varied from 25,000 to 30,000 fighters, up to 100,000, or even 200,000 soldiers.

=== Structure ===
The Ukrainian Insurgent Army was structured into three units:

The fourth region, UPA-East, was planned, but never created.

=== Greeting ===

The greeting &quot;Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!&quot; () was used among members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA).

=== Anthem ===
The anthem of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army was called the &quot;March of Ukrainian Nationalists&quot;, also known as &quot;We were born in a great hour&quot; (). The song, written by Oles Babiy, was officially adopted by the leadership of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in 1932. The organization was a successor of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, whose anthem was &quot;Chervona Kalyna&quot;. Leaders of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen, Yevhen Konovalets and Andriy Melnyk, were founding members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. For this reason, &quot;Chervona Kalyna&quot; was also used by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.

=== Flag ===
The flag of the UPA was a red-and-black banner, which continues to be a symbol of the Ukrainian nationalist movement. The colors of the flag symbolize &quot;red Ukrainian blood spilled on the black Ukrainian earth. Use of the flag is also a &quot;sign of the stubborn endurance of the Ukrainian national idea even under the grimmest conditions.&quot;

=== Awards ===
* Cross of Merit
* Cross of Combat Merit

== Military ranks ==
The UPA made use of a dual rank system that included functional command position designations and traditional military ranks. The functional system was developed due to an acute shortage of qualified and politically reliable officers during the early stages of organization.

UPA rank structure consisted of at least seven commissioned officer ranks, four non-commissioned officer ranks, and two soldier ranks. The hierarchical order of known ranks and their approximate U.S. Army equivalent is as follows:
The rank scheme provided for three more higher general officer ranks: Heneral-Poruchnyk (Major General), Heneral-Polkovnyk (Lieutenant General), and Heneral-Pikhoty (General with Four Stars).

== Armaments ==
Initially, the UPA used weapons collected from the battlefields of 1939 and 1941. Later, they bought weapons from peasants and individual soldiers or captured them in combat. Some light weapons were also brought by deserting Ukrainian auxiliary policemen. For the most part, the UPA used light infantry weapons of Soviet and, to a lesser extent, German origin (for which ammunition was less readily obtainable). In 1944, German units armed the UPA directly with captured Soviet arms. Many kurins were equipped with light 51 mm and 82 mm mortars. During large-scale operations in 1943–1944, insurgent forces also used artillery (45 mm and 76.2 mm). In 1943 a light Hungarian tank was used in Volhynia.

In 1944, the Soviets captured a Polikarpov Po-2 aircraft and one armored car and one personnel carrier from the UPA; however, it was not stated that they were in operable condition, while no OUN/UPA documents noted the usage of such equipment. By the end of World War II in Europe, the NKVD had captured 45 artillery pieces (45 and 76.2 mm calibres) and 423 mortars from the UPA. In attacks against Polish civilians, axes and pikes were used. However, the light infantry weapon was the basic weapon used by the UPA.

== Formation ==
=== 1941 ===
In a memorandum from 14 August 1941, the OUN-B petitioned the Germans to create a Ukrainian Army &quot;which [would] unite with the German Army... until [our] final victory&quot;, in exchange for German recognition of an allied, independent Ukrainian state. At the beginning of October 1941, during the first OUN Conference, the OUN formulated its future strategy. This called for transferring part of its organizational structure underground, in order to avoid conflict with the Germans. It also refrained from open anti-German propaganda activities. A captured German document of 25 November 1941 (Nuremberg Trial O14-USSR) ordered:&quot;It has been ascertained that the Bandera Movement [OUN-B] is preparing a revolt in the &quot;Reichskommissariat&quot; which has as its ultimate aim the establishment of an independent Ukraine. All functionaries of the Bandera Movement must be arrested at once and, after thorough interrogation, are to be liquidated...&quot;

=== 1942 ===
At the Second Conference of the OUN-B, held in April 1942, the policies for the &quot;creation, build-up and development of Ukrainian political and future military forces&quot; and &quot;action against partisan activity supported by Moscow&quot; were adopted. Although German policies were criticized, the Soviet partisans were identified as the primary enemy of the OUN (B) and its future armed wing. The Military Conference of the OUN (B) met in December 1942 near Lviv. The conference resulted in the adoption of a policy of building up the OUN-B&#x27;s military forces. The conference emphasized that &quot;the entire combat capable population must support, under the OUN banner, the struggle against the Bolshevik enemy&quot;. On 30 May 1947, the Main Ukrainian Liberation Council (Головна Визвольна Рада) adopted the date of 14 October 1942—the feast of the Intercession of the Theotokos, and Ukrainian Cossacks&#x27; Day—as the official anniversary of the UPA.

== Germany ==
The relationship between Ukrainian Insurgent Army and Nazi Germany was complex and varied on account of the intertwined interests of the two actors, as well as the decentralized nature of the UPA.

Despite the stated opinions of Dmytro Klyachkivsky and Roman Shukhevych that the Germans were a secondary threat compared to their main enemies (the Communist forces of the Soviet Union and Poland), the Third Conference of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, held near Lviv from 17 to 21 February 1943, decided to begin open warfare against the Germans (OUN fighters had already attacked a German garrison earlier that year on 7 February). Accordingly, on 20 March 1943, the OUN-B leadership issued secret instructions ordering their members who had joined the collaborationist Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in 1941–1942 to desert with their weapons and join with UPA units in Volhynia. This process often involved armed conflict with German forces trying to prevent this. The number of trained and armed personnel who joined the ranks of the UPA was estimated to be between 4 and 5 thousand.
Anti-German actions were limited to situations where the Germans attacked the Ukrainian population or UPA units. According to German general Ernst August Köstring, UPA fighters &quot;fought almost exclusively against German administrative agencies, the German police and the SS in their quest to establish an independent Ukraine controlled by neither Moscow nor Germany.&quot; During the German occupation, the UPA conducted hundreds of raids on police stations and military convoys. In the region of Zhytomyr insurgents were estimated by the German General-Kommissar Leyser to be in control of 80% of the forests and 60% of the farmland. According to the OUN/UPA, on 12 May 1943, Germans attacked the town of Kolki using several SS-Divisions (SS units operated alongside the Wehrmacht who were responsible for intelligence, central security, policing action, and mass extermination), where both sides suffered heavy losses. Soviet partisans reported the reinforcement of German auxiliary forces at Kolki from the end of April until the middle of May 1943.

In June 1943, German SS and police forces under the command of Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the head of Himmler-directed &quot;Bandenbekämpfung&quot; (&quot;bandit warfare&quot;), attempted to destroy UPA-North in Volhynia during Operation BB (Bandenbekämpfung). According to Ukrainian claims, the initial stage of the operation produced no results whatsoever. This development was the subject of several discussions by Himmler&#x27;s staff that resulted in General von dem Bach-Zelewski being sent to Ukraine. He failed to eliminate the UPA, which grew steadily, and the Germans, apart from terrorizing the civilian population, were virtually limited to defensive actions.

From July through September 1943, in an estimated 74 clashes between German forces and the UPA, the Germans lost more than 3,000 men killed or wounded, while the UPA lost 1,237 killed or wounded. According to post-war estimates, the UPA had the following number of clashes with the Germans in mid-to-late 1943 in Volhynia: 35 in July, 24 in August, 15 in September and 47 during October–November. In the fall of 1943, clashes between the UPA and the Germans declined, so that Erich Koch in his November 1943 report and New Year 1944 speech could claim that &quot;nationalistic bands in forests do not pose any major threat&quot; for the Germans.

In the autumn of 1943, some detachments of the UPA attempted to find rapprochement with the Germans, despite a 25 November OUN/UPA order to the contrary. In early 1944, UPA forces in several Western regions cooperated with the German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;, SiPo and SD. Nevertheless, the winter and spring of 1944 did not see a complete cessation of armed conflict between UPA and German forces, as the UPA continued to defend Ukrainian villages against the repressive actions of the German administration. For example, on 20 January, 200 German soldiers on their way to the Ukrainian village of Pyrohivka were forced to retreat after a several-hour long firefight with 80 UPA soldiers after having lost 30 killed and wounded. In March–July 1944, a senior leader of OUN-B in Galicia conducted negotiations with SD and SS officials, resulting in a German decision to supply the UPA with arms and ammunition. In May of that year, the OUN issued instructions to &quot;switch the struggle, which had been conducted against the Germans, completely into a struggle against the Soviets.&quot;

In a top-secret memorandum, General-Major Brigadeführer Brenner wrote in mid-1944 to SS-Obergruppenführer General Hans-Adolf Prützmann, the highest ranking German SS officer in Ukraine, that &quot;The UPA has halted all attacks on units of the German army. The UPA systematically sends agents, mainly young women, into the enemy-occupied territory, and the results of the intelligence are communicated to Department 1c of the [German] Army Group&quot; on the southern front. By the autumn of 1944, the German press was full of praise for the UPA for their anti-Bolshevik successes, referring to the UPA fighters as &quot;Ukrainian fighters for freedom&quot; After the front had passed, by the end of 1944 the Germans supplied the OUN/UPA by air with arms and equipment. In the Ivano-Frankivsk region, there even existed a small landing strip for German transport planes. Some German personnel trained in terrorist and intelligence activities behind Soviet lines, as well as some OUN-B leaders, were also transported through this channel.

Adopting a strategy analogous to that of the Chetnik leader General Draža Mihailović, the UPA limited its actions against the Germans in order to better prepare itself for and engage in the struggle against the Communists. Because of this, although the UPA managed to limit German activities to a certain extent, it failed to prevent the Germans from deporting approximately 500,000 people from Western Ukraine and from economically exploiting Western Ukraine. Due to its focus on the Soviets as the principal threat, the UPA&#x27;s anti-German struggle did not contribute significantly to the recapture of Ukrainian territories by Soviet forces.

== Poland ==
=== Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia ===


In 1943, the UPA adopted a policy of massacring and expelling the Polish population east of the Bug River. In March 1943, the OUN-B (specifically Mykola Lebed) imposed a collective death sentence on all Poles living in the former east of the Second Polish Republic, and a few months later, local units of the UPA were instructed to complete the operation soon. Among those who were behind the decision, Polish investigators singled out Dmytro Klyachkivsky, Vasyl Ivakhov, Ivan Lytvynchuk and Petro Oliynyk.

The ethnic cleansing operation against the Poles began on a large scale in Volhynia in late February (or early Spring) of that year and lasted until the end of 1944. Taras Bulba-Borovets, the founder of the UPA, criticized the attacks as soon as they began: 

11 July 1943, the Volhynian Bloody Sunday, was one of the deadliest days of the massacres, with UPA units marching from village to village, killing Polish civilians. On that day, UPA units surrounded and attacked 99 Polish villages and settlements in three counties – Kovel, Horokhiv, and Volodymyr. On the following day, 50 additional villages were attacked. In January 1944, the UPA campaign of ethnic cleansing spread to the neighboring province of Galicia. Unlike in Volhynia, where Polish villages were destroyed and their inhabitants murdered without warning, Poles in eastern Galicia were in some instances given the choice of fleeing or being killed. Ukrainian peasants sometimes joined the UPA in the violence, and large bands of armed marauders, unaffiliated with the UPA, brutalized civilians. In other cases however, Ukrainian civilians took significant steps to protect their Polish neighbors, either by hiding them during the UPA raids or vouching that the Poles were actually Ukrainians.

The methods used by the UPA to carry out the massacres were particularly brutal and were committed indiscriminately without any restraint. Historian Norman Davies describes the killings: &quot;Villages were torched. Roman Catholic priests were axed or crucified. Churches were burned with all their parishioners. Isolated farms were attacked by gangs carrying pitchforks and kitchen knives. Throats were cut. Pregnant women were bayoneted. Children were cut in two. Men were ambushed in the field and led away.&quot; In total, the estimated numbers of Polish and Jewish civilians killed in Volhynia and Galicia is between 50,000 and 100,000. Victims of the UPA included Ukrainians who did not adhere to its form of nationalism and so were considered traitors. After the initiation of the massacres, Polish self-defense units responded in kind. Estimates of Ukrainians killed in acts of reprisal range from 2,000 to 30,000. On 22 July 2016, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland passed a resolution declaring the massacres committed by the UPA a genocide.

=== Post-war ===

After Galicia had been taken over by the Red Army, many units of the UPA abandoned the anti-Polish course of action and some even began cooperating with local Polish anti-Communist resistance against the Soviets and the NKVD. Many Ukrainians, who had not participated in the anti-Polish massacres, joined the UPA after the war on both the Soviet and Polish sides of the border. Local agreements between the UPA and the Polish post-Home Army units began to appear as early as April/May 1945 and in some places lasted until 1947, such as in the Lublin Voivodeship. One of the most notable joint actions of the UPA and the post-Home Army Freedom and Independence Association (WiN) took place in May 1946, when the two partisan formations coordinated their attack and took over of the city of Hrubieszów.

The cooperation between the UPA and the post-Home Army underground came about partly as a response to increasing Communist terror and the forced population exchange between Poland and Ukraine. According to official statistics, between 1944 and 1956 around 488,000 Ukrainians and 789,000 Poles were transferred. On the territories of present-day Poland, 8,000–12,000 Ukrainians were killed and 6,000–8,000 Poles, between 1943 and 1947. However, unlike in Volhynia, most of the casualties occurred after 1944 and involved UPA soldiers and Ukrainian civilians on one side, and members of the Polish Communist Security Office (UB) and Border Protection Troops (WOP). Out of the 2,200 Poles who died in the fighting between 1945 and 1948, only a few hundred were civilians, with the remainder being functionaries or soldiers of the Communist regime in Poland.

== Soviet Union ==
=== German occupation ===

The total number of local Soviet partisans acting in Western Ukraine was never high, due to the region enduring only two years of German rule (in some places even less). In 1943, the Soviet partisan leader Sydir Kovpak was sent to the Carpathian Mountains, with help from Nikita Khrushchev. He described his mission to western Ukraine in his book &quot;Vid Putivlia do Karpat&quot; (From Putyvl to the Carpathian Mountains). Well armed by supplies delivered to secret airfields, he formed a group consisting of several thousand men which moved deep into the Carpathians. Attacks by the German Luftwaffe and military forced Kovpak to break up his force into smaller units in 1944; these groups were attacked by UPA units on their way back. Soviet NKVD agent Nikolai Kuznetsov was captured and executed by UPA members after unwittingly entering their camp while wearing a Wehrmacht officer uniform.

=== Fighting ===
As the Red Army approached Galicia, the UPA avoided clashes with the regular units of the Soviet military. Instead, the UPA focused its energy on NKVD units and Soviet officials of all levels, from NKVD and military officers to the school teachers and postal workers attempting to establish Soviet administration.

In March 1944, UPA insurgents mortally wounded front commander Army General Nikolai Vatutin, who captured Kiev when he led Soviet forces in the Second battle of Kiev. Several weeks later an NKVD battalion was annihilated by the UPA near Rivne. This resulted in a full-scale operation in the spring of 1944, initially involving 30,000 Soviet troops against the UPA in Volhynia. Estimates of casualties vary depending on the source. In a letter to the State Defense Committee of the USSR, Lavrentiy Beria stated that in spring 1944 clashes between Soviet forces and the UPA resulted in 2,018 killed and 1,570 captured UPA fighters and only 11 Soviets killed and 46 wounded. A captured UPA member, quoted in Soviet archives, stated that he received reports about UPA losses of 200 fighters against 2,000 Soviet losses. The first significant sabotage operations against communications of the Soviet Army before their offensive against the Germans was conducted by the UPA in April–May 1944. Such actions were promptly stopped by the Soviet Army and NKVD troops, after which the OUN/UPA submitted an order to temporarily cease anti-Soviet activities and prepare for the further struggle against the Soviets.

Despite heavy casualties on both sides during the initial clashes, the struggle was inconclusive. New large-scale actions of the UPA, especially in Ternopil Oblast, were launched in July–August 1944, when the Red Army advanced West. By the autumn of 1944, UPA forces enjoyed virtual freedom of movement over an area of 160,000 square kilometers in size and home to over 10 million people, and had established a shadow government.
In November 1944, Khrushchev launched the first of several large-scale Soviet assaults on the UPA throughout Western Ukraine, involving—according to OUN/UPA estimates—at least 20 NKVD combat divisions supported by artillery and armoured units. Soviet forces blockaded villages and roads, and set forests on fire. Soviet archival data states that on 9 October 1944, one NKVD Division, eight NKVD brigades, and an NKVD cavalry regiment with a total of 26,304 NKVD soldiers were stationed in Western Ukraine. In addition, two regiments with 1,500 and 1,200 persons, one battalion (517 persons) and three armoured trains with 100 additional soldiers each, as well as one border guard regiment and one unit were starting to relocate there in order to reinforce them.

During late 1944 and the first half of 1945, according to Soviet data, the UPA suffered approximately 89,000 killed, approximately 91,000 captured, and approximately 39,000 surrendered while the Soviet forces lost approximately 12,000 killed, approximately 6,000 wounded and 2,600 MIA. In addition, during this time, according to Soviet data UPA actions resulted in the killing of 3,919 civilians and the disappearance of 427 others. Despite the heavy losses, as late as summer 1945, many battalion-size UPA units still continued to control and administer large areas of territory in Western Ukraine. In February 1945 the UPA issued an order to liquidate &quot;kurins&quot; (battalions) and &quot;sotnyas&quot; (companies) and to operate predominantly in &quot;chotys&quot; (platoons).

=== Spring 1945–late 1946 ===

After Germany surrendered in May 1945, the Soviet authorities turned their attention to the guerrilla wars taking place in Ukraine and the Baltics. Combat units were reorganized and special forces were sent in. One of the major complications that arose was the local support the UPA had from the population. Areas of UPA activity were depopulated. The estimates on numbers deported vary; officially Soviet archives state that between 1944 and 1952 a total of 182,543 people were deported while other sources indicate the number may have been as high as to 500,000.

Mass arrests of suspected UPA informants or family members were conducted; between February 1944 and May 1946 over 250,000 people were arrested in Western Ukraine. Those arrested typically experienced beatings or other violence. Those suspected of being UPA members underwent torture; reports exist of some prisoners being burned alive. The many arrested women believed to be affiliating with the UPA were subjected to torture, deprivation, and rape at the hands of Soviet security in order to &quot;break&quot; them and get them to reveal UPA members&#x27; identities and locations or to turn them into Soviet double-agents. Mutilated corpses of captured rebels were put on public display. Ultimately, between 1944 and 1952 alone as many as 600,000 people may have been arrested in Western Ukraine, with about one-third executed and the rest imprisoned or exiled.
The UPA responded to the Soviet methods by unleashing their own terror against Soviet activists, suspected collaborators and their families. This work was particularly attributed to the Sluzhba Bezpeky (SB), the anti-espionage wing of the UPA. In a typical incident in the Lviv region, in front of horrified villagers, UPA troops gouged out the eyes of two entire families suspected of reporting on insurgent movements to Soviet authorities, before hacking their bodies to pieces. Due to public outrage concerning these violent punitive acts, the UPA stopped the practice of killing the families of collaborators by mid-1945. Other victims of the UPA included Soviet activists sent to Galicia from other parts of the Soviet Union; heads of village Soviets, those sheltering or feeding Red Army personnel, and even people turning food into collective farms. The effect of such terrorist acts was such that people refused to take posts as village heads, and until the late 1940s villages chose single men with no dependents as their leaders.

The UPA also proved to be especially adept at assassinating key Soviet administrative officials. According to NKVD data, between February 1944 and December 1946 11,725 Soviet officers, agents and collaborators were assassinated and 2,401 were &quot;missing&quot;, presumed kidnapped, in Western Ukraine. In one county in Lviv region alone, from August 1944 until January 1945 Ukrainian rebels killed 10 members of the Soviet active and a secretary of the county Communist party, and also kidnapped four other officials. The UPA travelled at will throughout the area. In this county, there were no courts, no prosecutor&#x27;s office, and the local NKVD only had three staff members.

According to Otto Skorzeny, from May to September 1945 the UPA fought more than 80 battles and lost 5,000 men (killed and wounded); the Soviet losses were 7,400 killed and more than 9,000 wounded. During the night of October 31, 1945 the UPA captured Stanislavov, the former capital of Volhynia. From Ukrainian Christmas Day, January 7, until October 1946 the UPA was forced to fight more than 1,000 battles: Soviet losses were more than 15,000 killed.

According to a 1946 report by Khrushchev&#x27;s deputy for West Ukrainian affairs A. A. Stoiantsev, out of 42,175 operations and ambushes against the UPA by destruction battalions in Western Ukraine, only 10 percent had positive results – in the vast majority there was either no contact or the individual unit was disarmed and pro-Soviet leaders murdered or kidnapped. Morale amongst the NKVD in Western Ukraine was particularly low. Even within the dangerous context of Soviet state service in the late-Stalin era, West Ukraine was considered to be a &quot;hardship post&quot;, and personnel files reveal higher rates of transfer requests, alcoholism, nervous breakdowns, and refusal to serve among NKVD field agents there at that time.

The first success of the Soviet authorities came in early 1946 in the Carpathians, which were blockaded from 11 January until 10 April. The UPA operating there ceased to exist as a combat unit. The continuous heavy casualties elsewhere forced the UPA to split into small units consisting of 100 soldiers. Many of the troops demobilized and returned home, when the Soviet Union offered three amnesties during 1947–1948. By 1946, the UPA was reduced to a core group of 5,000–10,000 fighters, and large-scale UPA activity shifted to the Soviet-Polish border. Here, in 1947, they killed the Polish Communist deputy defence minister General Karol Świerczewski. In spring 1946, the OUN/UPA established contacts with the Intelligence services of France, Great Britain and US.

=== End of UPA resistance ===
The turning point in the struggle against the UPA came in 1947 when the Soviets established an intelligence gathering network within the UPA and shifted the focus of their actions from mass terror to infiltration and espionage. After 1947 the UPA&#x27;s activity began to subside. On May 30, 1947, Shukhevych issued instructions for joining the OUN and UPA in underground warfare. In 1947–1948 UPA resistance was weakened enough to allow the Soviets to begin implementation of large-scale collectivization throughout Western Ukraine.

In 1948, the Soviet central authorities purged local officials who had mistreated peasants and engaged in &quot;vicious methods&quot;. At the same time, Soviet agents planted within the UPA had taken their toll on morale and on the UPA&#x27;s effectiveness. According to the writing of one slain Ukrainian rebel, &quot;the Bolsheviks tried to take us from within...you can never know exactly in whose hands you will find yourself. From such a network of spies, the work of whole teams is often penetrated...&quot;. In November 1948, the work of Soviet agents led to two important victories against the UPA: the defeat and deaths of the heads of the most active UPA network in Western Ukraine, and the removal of &quot;Myron&quot;, the head of the UPA&#x27;s counter-intelligence SB unit.

The Soviet authorities tried to win over the local population by making significant economic investments in Western Ukraine, and by setting up rapid reaction groups in many regions to combat the UPA. According to one retired MVD major, &quot;By 1948 ideologically we had the support of most of the population.&quot; The UPA&#x27;s leader, Roman Shukhevych, was killed during an ambush near Lviv on 5 March 1950. Although sporadic UPA activity continued until the mid-1950s, after Shukhevich&#x27;s death the UPA rapidly lost its fighting capability. An assessment of UPA manpower by Soviet authorities on 17 April 1952 claimed that UPA/OUN had only 84 fighting units consisting of 252 persons. The UPA&#x27;s last commander, Vasyl Kuk, was captured on 24 May 1954. Despite the existence of some insurgent groups, according to a report by the MGB of the Ukrainian SSR, the &quot;liquidation of armed units and OUN underground was accomplished by the beginning of 1956&quot;.

NKVD units dressed as UPA fighters are known to have committed atrocities against the civilian population in order to discredit the UPA. Among these NKVD units were those composed of former UPA fighters working for the NKVD. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) recently published information that about 150 such special groups consisting of 1,800 people operated until 1954. Prominent people killed by UPA insurgents during the anti-Soviet struggle included Metropolitan Oleksiy (Hromadsky) of the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church, killed while traveling in a German convoy, and pro-Soviet writer Yaroslav Halan.

In 1951, CIA covert operations chief Frank Wisner estimated that some 35,000 Soviet police troops and Communist party cadres had been eliminated by guerrillas affiliated with the Ukrainian Insurgent Army in the period after the end of World War II. Official Soviet figures for the losses inflicted by all types of Ukrainian nationalists during the period 1944–1953 referred to 30,676 persons; amongst them were 687 NKGB-MGB personnel, 1,864 NKVD-MVD personnel, 3,199 Soviet Army, Border Guards, and NKVD-MVD troops, 241 Communist party leaders, 205 Komsomol leaders and 2,590 members of self-defense units. According to Soviet data, the remaining losses were among civilians, including 15,355 peasants and kolkhozniks. Soviet archives state that between February 1944 and January 1946 the Soviet forces conducted 39,778 operations against the UPA, during which they killed a total of 103,313, captured a total of 8,370 OUN members and captured a total of 15,959 active insurgents. Many UPA members were imprisoned in the Gulag. They actively participated in Gulag uprisings of Norilsk, Vorkuta, and Kengir.

=== Soviet infiltration ===
In 1944–1945 the NKVD carried out 26,693 operations against the Ukrainian underground. These resulted in the deaths of 22,474 Ukrainian soldiers and the capture of 62,142 prisoners. During this time the NKVD formed special groups known as &quot;spetshrupy&quot; made up of former Soviet partisans. The goal of these groups was to discredit and disorganize the OUN and UPA. In August 1944, Sydir Kovpak was placed under NKVD authority. Posing as Ukrainian insurgents, these special formations used violence against the civilian population of Western Ukraine. In June 1945 there were 156 such special groups with 1,783 members.

From December 1945 to 1946, 15,562 operations were carried out in which 4,200 were killed and more than 9,400 were arrested. From 1944 to 1953, the Soviets killed 153,000 and arrested 134,000 members of the UPA. 66,000 families (204,000 people) were forcibly deported to Siberia and half a million people were subject to repression. In the same period, Polish Communist authorities deported 450,000 people. Soviet infiltration of British intelligence also meant that MI6 assisted in training some of the guerrillas in parachuting and unmarked planes used to drop them into Ukraine from bases in Cyprus and Malta, were counter-acted by the fact that one MI6 agent with knowledge of the operation was Kim Philby. Working with Anthony Blunt, he alerted Soviet security forces about planned drops. Ukrainian guerrillas were intercepted and most were executed.

== Holocaust ==

The OUN pursued a policy of infiltrating the German police to obtain weapons and training for fighters. In that role, it helped the Germans to carry out the Holocaust. The Ukrainian Auxiliary Police, working for the Germans, played a crucial supporting role in the murder of 200,000 Jews in Volhynia in the second half of 1942. Most of the police deserted in the following spring and joined the UPA. Historian Shmuel Spector estimated in 1990 that the UPA and OUN together hunted down and killed several thousand Jews. With the first antisemitic ideology and acts traced back to the Russian Civil War, by 1940–1941 the publications of Ukrainian terrorist organizations became explicitly antisemitic. German documents of the period give the impression that Ukrainian ultranationalists were indifferent to the plight of the Jews and would either kill them or help them, whichever was more appropriate for their political goals.

According to Timothy D. Snyder, the Soviet partisans were known for their brutality by retaliating against entire villages suspected of working with the Germans, killing individuals deemed to be collaborators, and provoking the Germans to attack villages. The UPA would later attempt to match that brutality. John-Paul Himka notes that &quot;it is reasonable to assume that the [UPA]--like its Polish counterpart, the Home Army (AK)--liquidated Jewish partisan bands because they were pro-Communist&quot;.

By early 1943, the OUN had entered into open armed conflict with Nazi Germany. According to Ukrainian historian and former UPA soldier Lew Shankowsky, immediately upon assuming the position of commander of the UPA in August 1943, Roman Shukhevych issued an order banning participation in anti-Jewish activities. No written record of this order, however, has been found. In 1944, the OUN formally &quot;rejected racial and ethnic exclusivity&quot;. Nevertheless, Jews hiding from the Germans with Poles in Polish villages were often killed by the UPA along with their Polish saviors, although in at least one case, they were spared as the Poles were murdered. Some Jews who fled the ghettos for the forests were killed by members of the UPA.

According to Herbert Romerstein, Soviet propaganda complained about Zionist membership in the UPA, and during the persecution of Jews in the early 1950s, they described the alleged connection between Jewish and Ukrainian nationalists. One well-known claimed example of Jewish participation in the UPA was most likely a hoax, according to sources such as Friedman. According to the report, Stella Krenzbach, the daughter of a rabbi and a Zionist, joined the UPA as a nurse and intelligence agent. She is alleged to have written, &quot;I attribute the fact that I am alive today and devoting all the strength of my thirty-eight years to a free Israel only to God and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. I became a member of the heroic UPA on 7 November 1943. In our group I counted twelve Jews, eight of whom were doctors&quot;. Later, Friedman concluded that Krenzbach was a fictional character, as the only evidence for her existence was in an OUN paper. No one knew of such an employee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where she supposedly worked after the war. A Jew, Leiba Dubrovskii, pretended to be Ukrainian.

== Reconciliation ==

During the following years, the UPA was officially taboo in the Soviet Union, mentioned only as a terrorist organization. Since Ukraine&#x27;s independence in 1991, there have been heated debates about the possible award of official recognition to former UPA members as legitimate combatants, with the accompanying pensions and benefits due to war veterans. UPA veterans have also striven to hold parades and commemorations of their own, especially in Western Ukraine. This, in turn, led to opposition from Soviet Army veterans and some Ukrainian politicians, particularly from the south and east of the country. Attempts to reconcile former Polish Home Army and UPA soldiers have been made by both the Ukrainian and Polish sides. Individual former UPA members have expressed their readiness for a mutual apology. Some of the past soldiers of both organizations have met and asked for forgiveness for their past misdeeds. Restorations of graves and cemeteries in Poland where fallen UPA soldiers were buried have been agreed to by the Polish side.

== 2019 official veteran status ==
In late March 2019 former members of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (and other living former members of Ukrainian irregular nationalist armed groups that were active during World War II and the first decade after the war) were officially granted the status of veterans. This meant that for the first time they could receive veteran benefits, including free public transport, subsidized medical services, annual monetary aid, and public utility discounts (and will enjoy the same social benefits as former Ukrainian soldiers who served in the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army).

There had been several previous attempts to provide former Ukrainian nationalist fighters with official veteran status, especially during the 2005–2009 administration of President Viktor Yushchenko, but all failed. Prior to December 2018, legally only former UPA members who &quot;participated in hostilities against Nazi invaders in occupied Ukraine in 1941–1944, who did not commit crimes against humanity and were rehabilitated&quot; were recognized as war veterans.

== Monuments for combatants ==
Without waiting for official notice from Kyiv, many regional authorities have already decided to approach the UPA&#x27;s history on their own. In many western cities and villages monuments, memorials and plaques to the leaders and troops of the UPA have been erected. In eastern Ukraine&#x27;s city of Kharkiv, a memorial to the soldiers of the UPA was erected in 1992.

In response, some southern and eastern provinces, although the UPA had not operated in those regions, opened memorials of their own dedicated to the UPA&#x27;s victims. The first one, &quot;The Shot in the Back&quot;, was unveiled by the Communist Party of Ukraine in Simferopol, Crimea in September 2007. In 2008, one was erected in Svatove, Luhansk oblast, and another in Luhansk on 8 May 2010 by the city deputy, Arsen Klinchaev, and the Party of Regions. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Vice Prime Minister Viktor Tikhonov, the leader of the parliamentary faction of the Pro-Russian Party of Regions Oleksandr Yefremov, Russian State Duma deputy Konstantin Zatulin, Luhansk Regional Governor Valerii Holenko, and Luhansk Mayor Serhii Kravchenko.

== Commemoration in Ukraine ==
According to John Armstrong,
&quot;If one takes into account the duration, geographical extent, and intensity of activity, the UPA very probably is the most important example of forceful resistance to an established Communist regime prior to the decade of fierce Afghan resistance beginning in 1979... the Hungarian revolution of 1956 was, of course, far more important, involving to some degree a population of nine million... however it lasted only a few weeks. In contrast, the more-or-less effective anti-Communist activity of the Ukrainian resistance forces lasted from mid-1944 until 1950.&quot;

Since 2006, the SBU has been actively involved in declassifying documents relating to the operations of Soviet security services and the history of the liberation movement in Ukraine. The SBU Information Centre provides an opportunity for scholars to get acquainted with electronic copies of archive documents. The documents are arranged by topics (1932–1933 Holodomor, OUN/UPA Activities, Repression in Ukraine, Movement of Dissident). In 2007, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) set up a special working group to study archive documents of the activity of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) to make public original sources.

On 10 January 2008, Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko submitted a draft law &quot;on the official Status of Fighters for Ukraine&#x27;s Independence from the 1920s to the 1990s&quot;. Under the draft, persons who took part in political, guerrilla, underground and combat activities for the freedom and independence of Ukraine from 1920 to 1990 as part of or assisting the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), Karpatska Sich, OUN, UPA, and Ukrainian Main Liberation Army would be recognised as war veterans. Since September 2009, Ukrainian schoolchildren take a more extensive course of the history of the Holodomor and the fighters of the OUN and the UPA fighters. Yushchenko took part in the celebration of the 67th anniversary of the UPA and the 65th anniversary of Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council on 14 October 2009.

On 16 January 2012, the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine upheld the presidential decree of 28 January 2010 &quot;About recognition of OUN members and soldiers of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army as participants in the struggle for independence of Ukraine&quot; after it was challenged by the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party of Ukraine, Nataliya Vitrenko, recognising the UPA as war combatants. On 10 October 2014, the date of 14 October as Defenders of Ukraine Day was confirmed by Presidential decree, officially granting state sanction to the date of the anniversary of the raising of the Insurgent Army, which has been celebrated in the past by Ukrainian Cossacks as the Feast of the Intercession of the Virgin Mary. The date would be moved to 1 October in 2023 with the move of all Orthodox fixed solemnities to the Revised Julian Calendar, but minor commemorations on the 14th continue as usual it was the date in 1942 wherein the UIA was founded.

On 15 May 2015, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed a bill into law &quot;On the legal status and commemoration of the fighters for the independence of Ukraine in the 20th century&quot;, including Ukrainian Insurgent Army combatants. In June 2017, the Kyiv City Council renamed the city&#x27;s General Vatutin Avenue into Roman Shukhevych Avenue. According to Russia&#x27;s RIA Novosti in 2018, in Kyiv, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk and Zhytomyr, the UPA flag may be displayed on government buildings &quot;on certain holidays&quot;. In December 2018, Poroshenko confirmed the status of veterans and combatants for independence of Ukraine for UPA fighters.

On 5 March 2021, the Ternopil City Council named the largest stadium in the city of Ternopil after Roman Shukhevych as the Roman Shukhevych Ternopil city stadium. On 16 March 2021, the Lviv Oblast Council approved the renaming of their largest stadium after Roman Shukhevych.

== Popular culture ==
The Ukrainian black metal band Drudkh recorded a song entitled &quot;Ukrainian Insurgent Army&quot; on its 2006 release, (&quot;Blood in our wells&quot;), dedicated to Stepan Bandera. Ukrainian Neo-Nazi black metal band Nokturnal Mortum have a song titled &quot;Hailed Be the Heroes&quot; () on the Weltanschauung/&quot;Мировоззрение&quot; album which contains lyrics pertaining to World War II and Western Ukraine (Galicia), and its title, &quot;Slava Heroyam&quot;, is a traditional UPA salute.
Two Czech films by František Vláčil, &quot;Shadows of the Hot Summer&quot; (&quot;Stíny horkého léta&quot;, 1977) and &quot;The Little Shepherd Boy from the Valley&quot; (&quot;Pasáček z doliny&quot;, 1983) are set in 1947, and feature UPA guerrillas in significant supporting roles. The first film resembles Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), in that it is about a farmer whose family is taken hostage by five UPA guerrillas, and he has to resort to his own ingenuity, plus reserves of violence that he never knew he possessed, to defeat them. In the second, the shepherd boy (actually a cowherd) imagines that a group of UPA guerrillas is made up of fairytale characters of his grandfather&#x27;s stories, and that their leader is the Goblin King.

Also films such as &quot;Neskorenyi&quot; (&quot;The Undefeated&quot;), &quot;Zalizna Sotnia&quot; (&quot;The Company of Heroes&quot;) and &quot;Atentat&quot; (&quot;Assassination. An Autumn Murder in Munich&quot;) feature more description about the role of the UPA on their terrain. &quot;The Undefeated&quot; is about the life of Roman Shukhevych and the hunt for him by both German and Soviet forces, &quot;The Company of Heroes&quot; shows how UPA soldiers had everyday life as they fight against Armia Krajowa, &quot;Assassination&quot; is about the life of Stepan Bandera and how KGB agents murdered him.

The red-and-black battle flag of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army was a popular symbol among Euromaidan protesters, and the wartime insurgents have acted as a large inspiration for them. Serhy Yekelchyk of the University of Victoria says the use of UPA imagery and slogans was more of a potent symbol of protest against the current government and Russia rather than adulation for the insurgents themselves, explaining &quot;The reason for the sudden prominence of [UPA symbolism] in Kiev is that it is the strongest possible expression of protest against the pro-Russian orientation of the current government.&quot;

=== Songs ===
The most obvious characteristic of the insurgent songs genre is the theme of rising up against occupying powers, enslavement and tyranny. Insurgent songs express an open call to battle and to revenge against the enemies of Ukraine, as well as love for the country and devotion to her revolutionary leaders (Bandera, Chuprynka and others). UPA actions, heroic deeds of individual soldiers, the hard underground life, longing for one&#x27;s girl, family or boy are also important subject of this genre.

<text>In organic chemistry, ethoxylation is a chemical reaction in which ethylene oxide () adds to a substrate. It is the most widely practiced alkoxylation, which involves the addition of epoxides to substrates.

In the usual application, alcohols and phenols are converted into , where &quot;n&quot; ranges from 1 to 10. Such compounds are called alcohol ethoxylates. Alcohol ethoxylates are often converted to related species called ethoxysulfates. Alcohol ethoxylates and ethoxysulfates are surfactants, used widely in cosmetic and other commercial products. The process is of great industrial significance, with more than 2,000,000 metric tons of various ethoxylates produced worldwide in 1994.

==Production==
The process was developed at the Ludwigshafen laboratories of IG Farben by Conrad Schöller and during the 1930s.

===Alcohol ethoxylates===
Industrial ethoxylation is primarily performed upon alcohols. Lower alcohols react to give glycol ethers which are commonly used as solvents, while longer fatty alcohols are converted to fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAE&#x27;s), which are a common form of nonionic surfactant. The reaction typically proceeds by blowing ethylene oxide through the alcohol at 180 °C and under 1-2 bar of pressure, with potassium hydroxide (KOH) serving as a catalyst. The process is highly exothermic (Δ&quot;H&quot; = -92 kJ/mol of ethylene oxide reacted) and requires careful control to avoid a potentially disastrous thermal runaway.

The starting materials are usually primary alcohols as they tend to react 10–30× faster than secondary alcohols do.
Typically 5-10 units of ethylene oxide are added to each alcohol, however ethoxylated alcohols can be more prone to ethoxylation than the starting alcohol, making the reaction difficult to control and leading to the formation of a product with varying repeat unit length (the value of &quot;n&quot; in the equation above). Better control can be afforded by the use of more sophisticated catalysts, which can be used to generate narrow-range ethoxylates. Ethoxylated alcohols are considered to be a high production volume (HPV) chemical by the US EPA.

====Ethoxylation/propoxylation====
Ethoxylation is sometimes combined with propoxylation, the analogous reaction using propylene oxide as the monomer. Both reactions are normally performed in the same reactor and may be run simultaneously to give a random polymer, or in alternation to obtain block copolymers such as poloxamers. Propylene oxide is more hydrophobic than ethylene oxide and its inclusion at low levels can significantly affect the properties of the surfactant. In particular ethoxylated fatty alcohols which have been &#x27;capped&#x27; with ~1 propylene oxide unit are extensively marketed as defoamers.

====Ethoxysulfates====
Ethoxylated fatty alcohols are often converted to the corresponding organosulfates, which can be easily deprotonated to give anionic surfactants such as sodium laureth sulfate. Being salts, ethoxysulfates exhibit good water solubility (high HLB value). The conversion is achieved by treating ethoxylated alcohols with sulfur trioxide. Laboratory scale synthesis may be performed using chlorosulfuric acid:
:

The resulting sulfate esters are neutralized to give the salt:

Small volumes are neutralized with alkanolamines such as triethanolamine (TEA). 

In 2008, 381,000 metric tons of alcohol ethoxysulfates were consumed in North America. Lauryl Alcohol Ethoxylate Analysis with Gas Chromatography (GC) 

For the analysis of Lauryl Alcohol Ethoxylate using Gas Chromatography (GC), the selection of a suitable GC column depends on the specific ethoxylation level and the volatility of the compound. In general, Lauryl Alcohol Ethoxylates are non-volatile or semi-volatile, so derivatization might be necessary before GC analysis. 
Here are some column options for analysis after derivatization (acetylation):
1. Non-polar columns (like DB-1, HP-1, or RTX-1):

These are made of 100% dimethylpolysiloxane.
Suitable for analyzing relatively non-polar, derivatized alcohol ethoxylates.
Common dimensions: 30 m length, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness.

2. Mid-polarity columns (like DB-5, HP-5, or RTX-5):
These are 5% phenyl, 95% dimethylpolysiloxane.
They offer slightly better separation of ethoxylates with varying chain lengths.
Common dimensions: 30 m length, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 μm film thickness.

3. Polar columns (like DB-WAX or HP-FFAP):
These are polyethylene glycol (PEG) columns.
They are more suited for polar compounds, but Lauryl Alcohol Ethoxylates may still need derivatization.
The DB-5 or HP-5 column is often preferred for surfactants like ethoxylates due to its moderate polarity, providing good separation of ethoxylation products.

It&#x27;s essential to consider the specific range of ethoxylation (number of ethylene oxide units) to optimize the method further. Additionally, derivatization can help in improving volatility and peak shape.

===Other materials===
Although alcohols are by far the major substrate for ethoxylation, many nucleophiles are reactive toward ethylene oxide. Primary amines will react to give di-chain materials such as polyethoxylated tallow amine. The reaction of ammonia produces important bulk chemicals such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and triethanolamine.

==Applications of ethoxylated products==
Alcohol ethoxylates (AE) and alcohol ethoxysulfates (AES) are surfactants found in products such as laundry detergents, surface cleaners, cosmetics, agricultural products, textiles, and paint.

===Alcohol ethoxylates===
As alcohol ethoxylate based surfactants are non-ionic they typically require longer ethoxylate chains than their sulfonated analogues in order to be water-soluble. Examples synthesized on an industrial scale include octyl phenol ethoxylate, polysorbate 80 and poloxamers.
Ethoxylation is commonly practiced, albeit on a much smaller scale, in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to increase water solubility and, in the case of pharmaceuticals, circulatory half-life of non-polar organic compounds. In this application, ethoxylation is known as &quot;PEGylation&quot; (polyethylene oxide is synonymous with polyethylene glycol, abbreviated as PEG). Carbon chain length is 8-18 while the ethoxylated chain is usually 3 to 12 ethylene oxides long in home products. They feature both lipophilic tails, indicated by the alkyl group abbreviation, R, and relatively polar headgroups, represented by the formula .

===Alcohol ethoxysulfates===
AES found in consumer products generally are linear alcohols, which could be mixtures of entirely linear alkyl chains or of both linear and mono-branched alkyl chains. A high-volume example of these is sodium laureth sulfate a foaming agent in shampoos and liquid soaps, as well as industrial detergents.

==Environmental and safety==
===Alcohol ethoxylates (AEs)===

====Human health====
Alcohol ethoxylates are not observed to be mutagenic, carcinogenic, or skin sensitizers, nor cause reproductive or developmental effects. One byproduct of ethoxylation is 1,4-dioxane, a possible human carcinogen. Undiluted AEs can cause dermal or eye irritation. In aqueous solution, the level of irritation is dependent on the concentration. AEs are considered to have low to moderate toxicity for acute oral exposure, low acute dermal toxicity, and have mild irritation potential for skin and eyes at concentrations found in consumer products. Recent studies have found dried AE residues similar to what would be found on restaurant dishes (as effective concentrations from 1:10,000 to 1:40,000) killed epithelial intestinal cells at high concentrations. Lower concentrations made cells more permeable and prone to inflammatory response.

====Aquatic and environmental aspects====
AEs are usually released down the drain, where they may be adsorbed into solids and biodegrade through anaerobic processes, with ~28–58% degraded in the sewer. The remaining AEs are treated at waste water treatment plants and biodegraded via aerobic processes with less than 0.8% of AEs released in effluent. If released into surface waters, sediment or soil, AEs will degrade through aerobic and anaerobic processes or be taken up by plants and animals.

Toxicity to certain invertebrates has a range of EC50 values for linear AE from 0.1 mg/L to greater than 100 mg/L. For branched alcohol exthoxylates, toxicity ranges from 0.5 mg/L to 50 mg/L. The EC50 toxicity for algae from linear and branched AEs was 0.05 mg/L to 50 mg/L. Acute toxicity to fish ranges from LC50 values for linear AE of 0.4 mg/L to 100 mg/L, and branched is 0.25 mg/L to 40 mg/L. For invertebrates, algae and fish the essentially linear and branched AEs are considered to not have greater toxicity than Linear AE.

===Alcohol ethoxysulfates (AESs)===

====Biodegradation====
The degradation of AES proceeds by ω- or β-oxidation of the alkyl chain, enzymatic hydrolysis of the sulfate ester, and by cleavage of an ether bond in the AES producing alcohol or alcohol ethoxylate and an ethylene glycol sulfate. Studies of aerobic processes also found AES to be readily biodegradable. The half-life of both AE and AES in surface water is estimated to be less than 12 hours. The removal of AES due to degradation via anaerobic processes is estimated to be between 75 and 87%.

==== In water ====
Flow-through laboratory tests in a terminal pool of AES with mollusks found the NOEC of a snail, Goniobasis and the Asian clam, Corbicula to be greater than 730 ug/L. Corbicula growth was measured to be affected at a concentration of 75 ug/L. The mayfly, genus &quot;Tricorythodes&quot; has a normalized density NOEC value of 190 ug/L.

====Human safety====
AES has not been found to be genotoxic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic. A 2022 study revealed the expression of genes involved in cell survival, epithelial barrier, cytokine signaling, and metabolism were altered by rinse aid in concentrations used in professional dishwashers. The alcohol ethoxylates present in the rinse aid were identified as the culprit component causing the epithelial inflammation and barrier damage.

<text>Felice Leonardo Buscaglia (March 31, 1924 – June 12, 1998), also known as &quot;Dr. Love&quot;, was an American author, motivational speaker, and a professor in the Department of Special Education at the University of Southern California.

==Life and career==
Felice Leonardo Buscaglia was born in Los Angeles, California, on March 31, 1924, into a family of Italian immigrants. He spent his early childhood in Aosta, Italy, before going back to the United States for education. He was a graduate of Theodore Roosevelt High School. Buscaglia served in the U.S. Navy during World War II; he did not see combat, but he saw its aftermath in his duties in the dental section of the military hospital, helping to reconstruct shattered faces. 
Using G.I. Bill benefits, he entered the University of Southern California, where he earned three degrees (BA 1950, MA 1954, PhD 1963) before eventually joining the faculty. He was known for always getting on the elevator and putting his back to the door and introduce himself saying &quot;This might be the only chance I&#x27;ll ever get to meet you and I don&#x27;t want to miss this chance.&quot; He would rake the leaves in his yard and put them in a room in his house so he could sit and study them. He was fascinated that God would go to the trouble to make every leaf different. &quot;Imagine how proud he is of us if he goes to that much trouble for a simple leaf on a tree.&quot;

He was the first to state and promote the concept of humanity&#x27;s need for hugs: 5 to survive, 8 to maintain, and 12 to thrive.

Upon retirement, Buscaglia was named Professor at Large, one of only two such designations on campus at that time.

==Student&#x27;s suicide==
While teaching at USC, Buscaglia was moved by a student&#x27;s suicide to contemplate human disconnectedness and the meaning of life, and began a noncredit class he called Love 1A. This became the basis for his first book, titled simply &quot;Love&quot;. His dynamic speaking style was discovered by the Public Broadcasting Service  (PBS), and his televised lectures earned great popularity in the 1980s. At one point his talks, always shown during fundraising periods, were the top earners of all PBS programs. This national exposure, coupled with the heartfelt storytelling style of his books, helped make all his titles national bestsellers; five were once on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestsellers list simultaneously.

==Death==
Buscaglia died of a heart attack on June 12, 1998, at his home in Glenbrook, Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, when he was 74.

==In popular culture==
In a May 12, 1984, &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip, the dog Snoopy is seen strolling towards Charlie Brown and Sally. Snoopy gives them both warm and sincere hugs. Afterwards, Charlie Brown explains their dog&#x27;s actions to his puzzled sister: &quot;You can always tell when he&#x27;s been listening to Leo Buscaglia tapes.&quot;

Buscaglia&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Love&quot; moniker, PBS lectures, and philosophy of hugs were referenced in Season 2, Episode 1 of &quot;The Americans&quot;.

In an April 22, 1991 &quot;The Far Side&quot; comic strip, a man dressed like a bullfighter awaits the charge of another man with outstretched arms. The caption reads: &quot;In some remote areas of the world, the popular sport is to watch a courageous young man avoid being hugged by a Leo Buscaglia impersonator.&quot;

In the August 1993 issue of &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 1) #203, the character of Carnage taunts Spider-Man by saying: &quot;Ah... even with his last breath—he&#x27;s doing his Leo Buscaglia impression!&quot;

<text>55 Broadway is a Grade I listed building on Broadway close to St James&#x27;s Park in London. Upon completion, it was the tallest office block in London. In 1931, the building earned architect Charles Holden the RIBA London Architecture Medal. In 2020, it was announced that it will be converted to a luxury hotel.

==History==
It was designed by Charles Holden and built between 1927 and as a new headquarters for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), the main forerunner of London Underground.

London Transport occupied the building from 1933 to 1984, followed by its successors London Regional Transport from 1984 to 2000, and Transport for London (TfL) from 2000 to 2020. TfL vacated the building in 2020.

The British Transport Commission (BTC) occupied the eighth and ninth floors from its formation at the end of 1947 until late 1953, when with the abolition of the Railway Executive (RE), the BTC moved into the RE&#x27;s offices at 222 Marylebone Road.

==Description==
Faced with Portland stone and covering a site with an irregular footprint, the upper office floors of the building are on a cruciform plan, stepping back towards the central clock tower at the top. The cruciform design afforded the optimum level of natural light to the offices. The ground floor now contains a shopping arcade and has many Art Deco details. Previously, the ground floor was also given over to London Transport offices, including a travel information centre, cash office and a library. The whole building straddles St James&#x27;s Park tube station, the east and west wings being immediately above the railway tunnel. When finished, it was the tallest steel-framed office building in London, until construction of another Holden building, the University of London&#x27;s Senate House (based on similar designs and materials).

On each elevation, the pediment above the sixth floor is decorated with a relief, collectively known as &#x27;the four winds&#x27;, although the four points of the compass are repeated twice for a total of eight reliefs. Each relief was carved by an avant-garde sculptor of the day.

Halfway along the north and east facades are a matched pair of sculptures, &quot;Day&quot; and &quot;Night&quot; by Jacob Epstein. The modernism and graphic nakedness of these sculptures created public outrage on their unveiling. Newspapers started a campaign to have the statues removed and one company director, Lord Colwyn, offered to pay the cost. Frank Pick, the managing director of the UERL at the time, took overall responsibility and offered his resignation over the scandal. In the end, Epstein agreed to remove from the penis of the smaller figure on &quot;Day&quot; and ultimately the furore died down.

The function suite on the 10th floor of the building was formerly set up as a dining room for the chairman and senior executives. At this level, there are also four roof gardens, one of which was dedicated to the wife of a former managing director in recognition of her enthusiasm in encouraging this early form of environmental work.

The building, first listed as Grade II in 1970, was upgraded to Grade I in 2011.

In 2013, it was announced that 55 Broadway would be converted into luxury apartments, once London Underground moved operations from the building in 2015 to their new headquarters in the Olympic Park in Stratford. In May 2014, it was announced that the architects, TateHindle, would lead the redevelopment and, in June 2015, planning permission and listed building consent was granted: however, this was not implemented and the planning permission expired in June 2018.

In September 2019, a long-term lease of the property was sold by TfL for £120 million to Integrity International Group, founded by Tony Matharu.

In May 2020, it was announced that Blue Orchid Hotels, a subsidiary of Integrity International, would convert the structure into a luxury hotel. TfL vacated the building in 2020.

==In popular culture==
In 2023, the building was used for the filming of the Channel 4 reality TV series &quot;Rise and Fall&quot;.

<doc id="1045258" wikidata="Q3188034" url="?curid=1045258" title="Judy Carne">
<text>Joyce Audrey Botterill (27 April 1939 – 3 September 2015), known professionally as Judy Carne, was an English actress best remembered for the phrase &quot;Sock it to me!&quot; on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

==Career==
Carne was born in Northampton, England. Her parents, Harold and Kathy, were greengrocers in Kingsthorpe.

She received training at the Pitt-Draffen Academy of Dance before being accepted into the prestigious Bush-Davis Theatrical School for Girls in East Grinstead, West Sussex.
An instructor at the school began calling her &quot;Judy,&quot; telling her that Joyce was not a good professional name. The second part of Judy&#x27;s stage name was taken from a character named Sarat Carn in the play &quot;Bonaventure&quot; by English playwright Charlotte Hastings.
She made her first British television appearances on the series &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1961) and episodes of &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; (also 1961), a BBC sitcom.

She moved to the US not long afterward. Her first regular role was in the sitcom &quot;Fair Exchange&quot; (1963) as an English teenager who goes to the US to live with an American couple whose daughter (played by Lynn Loring) has gone to live in England. That was followed by &quot;The Baileys of Balboa&quot; (1964). She later co-starred with Pete Duel in &quot;Love on a Rooftop&quot; (1966). She made several appearances on the adventure series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;

She had a small part in the ninth episode of the TV series &quot;Gidget&quot; (1965), guest-starred as Jill in first-season episode 2, &quot;Follow the Leader,&quot; and as Floy in second-season episode 3, &quot;Then Came The Mighty Hunter,&quot; of &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot; (1965), and appeared as herself in episodes of &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; and &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, both in 1966. She appeared in the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;A Question of Strength&quot; (1963) as Sister Mary Kathleen and two episodes of &quot;The Big Valley&quot; (1967) and guest-starred in episode 11 of the first season of &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot; (1971), an hour-long TV special, &quot;Super Plastic Elastic Goggles&quot; (1971) as a part of the short-lived NBC series, Children&#x27;s Theater, and the TV adaptation of &quot;QB VII&quot; (1974). She had roles in the films &quot;A Pair of Briefs&quot; (1962), &quot;The Americanization of Emily&quot; (1964), &quot;All the Right Noises&quot; (1971), and Rachel Amodeo&#x27;s street movie &quot;What About Me&quot; (1993) opposite Richard Hell and Johnny Thunders.

On &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; (1968–1970), Carne gained stardom. Her most popular routine ended with her saying &quot;Sock it to me!,&quot; at which point she was doused with water or assaulted in some other way. Carne was a regular in the first two seasons (1968–1969); then, having decided the show had become &quot;a big, bloody bore,&quot; made occasional guest appearances in the 1969–1970 season. A cast recording, on the CBS label, (#63490), was released in 1968. Her recording of &quot;Sock It To Me,&quot; with &quot;Right Said Fred&quot; on side 2, (Reprise RS 20680), was released in the UK on 9 May 1969.

Carne starred in a revival of the musical &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, which opened on Broadway on 14 April 1970 and ran for 111 performances.

In 1993, Carne attended the 25th anniversary of &quot;Laugh-In&quot; and appeared on a televised &quot;Laugh-In&quot; Christmas show.

==Personal life and death==
Carne was married to actor Burt Reynolds from 1963 to 1965 and to producer Robert Bergmann from 3 May 1970 to 1971. Both marriages were brief and childless, and ended in divorce. In 1978, after beating a heroin possession charge, she and her second husband were involved in a car accident. Her neck was broken in the accident, but she recovered. She was later arrested again for heroin possession. In 1986, she was arrested at London&#x27;s Heathrow Airport and convicted of drug possession. She served two months of a three-month prison sentence in HM Prison Cookham Wood.

Her autobiography, &quot;Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl&quot; (1985), detailed her bisexuality, marriage to and bitter divorce from Burt Reynolds – who unsuccessfully tried to prevent publication of the book – and her experiences with drugs.

Carne moved back to Northamptonshire, England, in the 1980s, living quietly in the village of Pitsford.

She died from pneumonia on 3 September 2015 at a hospital in Northampton.

===Political views===
Carne supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

<text>Escambia County Public Schools (ECPS), officially the Escambia County School District (ECSD), is the organization responsible for the administration of public schools in all of Escambia County, Florida, in the United States. The district currently administers 35 elementary schools, nine middle schools, and seven high schools, as well as a number of specialized centers.

The district is administered by an appointed superintendent and a five-member school board. As of the 2023-2024 school year, the superintendent of schools is Keith Leonard, who serves as the interim superintendent following the dismissal of Dr. Timothy Smith in May 2023.

The Escambia County electors voted in November 2018, to switch from an elected superintendent to an appointed superintendent. Prior to 2020, the superintendent was elected in presidential election years. The deputy superintendent of schools is Shenna Payne, a former principal of West Florida High School.

== Book banning ==
On May 17, 2023, the Escambia County School District was sued for allegedly engaging in discriminatory book bans in public school libraries. The lawsuit was filed by Escambia County parents, the PEN America nonprofit, and Penguin Random House. The plaintiffs allege that the School District is engaged in an &quot;ideologically driven campaign to push certain ideas out of schools.&quot; The suit refers to &quot;Island Trees School District v. Pico,&quot; which says that School Districts cannot decide what content to provide based on narrowly partisan or political grounds. The suit alleges that the School District&#x27;s logic could be used to ban books on Christianity, America&#x27;s Founding Fathers, and American war heroes. The case is currently pending before the Florida Northern District Court.

Supporters argue that the book bans help remove inappropriate content. However, researchers determined that less than 3% of the books banned across the United States in 2022 were mature (17+) rated. In addition, Vicki Baggett, a Northview High School language-arts teacher, asked for over 100 books to be challenged due to their &quot;political pushes.&quot;

Books that have been banned include Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;The Bluest Eye,&quot; Khaled Hosseini&#x27;s &quot;The Kite Runner&quot;, and Sapphire&#x27;s &quot;Push&quot;.

==Governance==
The members of the school board are:
* District 1 - Kevin Adams 
* District 2 - Paul H. Fetsko 
* District 3 - David Williams 
* District 4 - Carissa Bergosh
* District 5 - Tom Harrell

Members are elected in their respective districts for a four-year term. Representatives from districts 1, 2, and 3 are elected in non-presidential election years. Representatives for districts 4 and 5 are elected in presidential election years. Although elected by districts, each member is charged by statute with representing the entire school district.

Because the school board elections are non-partisan, these races are frequently decided in the primary election. If a candidate gets a majority of the vote in the primary, he or she wins, and the race is not on the general election ballot in November. If no candidate has a majority of the vote, the top two are in a run-off on the November ballot. In the 2024 election, an amendment to the Florida Constitution was enacted that changes school board elections to partisan.

The school board appointed Tim Smith as superintendent. Smith was sworn in on November 17, 2020, replacing Malcolm Thomas, whose term ended. In May 2023, the school board voted (3 to 2) to terminate Smith&#x27;s contract. The decision was highly controversial. Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources, Keith Leonard, was selected to serve as the interim superintendent for the 2023-2024 school year.

Prior to 2018 voters directly elected the superintendent; voters chose to make the superintendent chosen by the school board that year. In 2023 the school board rejected a proposal to make the superintendent an elected position again.

The Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) determines which schools in the state of Florida should be considered &quot;Failing.&quot; The Florida Standards Assessments (FSA) began phasing out the FCAT in the 2010–11 academic year in response to the inauguration of the Common Core State Standards Initiative under the administration of US President Barack Obama in 2010.

FCAT and FSA scores are calculated per subject on a 0 to 100 scale, and ratings in the 0 to 20 or 20 to 40 range are rated &quot;F&quot; or &quot;D&quot; respectively, indicating severe performance shortcomings and contributing to a 2 and 3-year process respectively of &quot;restarting&quot; the school.

In the 2017–18 school year, Escambia County placed as 52nd of 64 counties in the state by FSA performance, with eleven of thirty-five elementary schools receiving a D rating and three of ten middle schools receiving a D rating. No high school performed at a rating of D or below, though Escambia High School and Ferry Pass Middle School both recorded an &quot;I,&quot; or Incomplete rating for the 2017-18 school year.

<text>Pinus pinaster, the maritime pine or cluster pine, is a pine native to the south Atlantic Europe region and parts of the western Mediterranean. It is a hard, fast growing pine bearing small seeds with large wings.

==Description==

&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; is a medium-size tree, reaching tall with a trunk diameter of up to , exceptionally .

The bark is orange-red, thick, and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, somewhat thinner in the upper crown.

The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in pairs, very stout ( broad), up to long, and bluish-green to distinctly yellowish-green. The maritime pine features the longest and most robust needles of all European pine species.

The cones are conic, long and broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy red-brown when 24 months old. They open slowly over the next few years, or after being heated by a forest fire, to release the seeds, opening to broad.

The seeds are long, with a wing, and are wind-dispersed.

=== Similar species ===
Maritime pine is closely related to Turkish pine, Canary Island pine, and Aleppo pine, which all share many features with it. It is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Its range is in the western Mediterranean Basin and the southern Atlantic coast of Europe, extending from central Portugal and Northern Spain (especially in Galicia) to southern and Western France, east to western Italy, Croatia and south to northern Tunisia, Algeria and northern Morocco. It favours a Mediterranean climate, which is one that has cool, rainy winters and hot, dry summers.

It generally occurs at low to moderate altitudes, mostly from sea level to , but up to in the south of its range in Morocco. The high degree of fragmentation in the current natural distribution is caused by two factors: the discontinuity and altitude of the mountain ranges causing isolation of even close populations, and human activity.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; is a popular topic in ecology because of its problematic growth and spread in South Africa for the past 150 years after being imported into the region at the end of the 17th century (1685–1693). It was found spreading in the Cape Peninsula by 1772. Towards the end of the 18th century (1780), &quot;P. pinaster&quot; was widely planted, and at the beginning of the 19th century (1825–1830), &quot;P. pinaster&quot; was planted commercially as a timber resource and for the forestry industry. The pine tree species invades large areas and more specifically fynbos vegetation. Fynbos vegetation is a fire-prone shrubland vegetation that is found in the southern and southwest cape of South Africa. It is found in greater abundance close to watercourses. Dispersal, habitat loss, and fecundity are all factors that affect spread rate. The species favors acidic soils with medium to high-density vegetation, but it can also grow in basic soils and even in sandy and poor soils, where only few commercial species can grow.

&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; is a diagnostic species of the vegetation class &quot;Pinetea halepensis&quot;.

Larvae of the moth &quot;Dioryctria sylvestrella&quot; feed on this pine. Their boring activity causes large quantities of resin to flow from the wounds which weakens the tree and allows fungi and other pathogens to gain entry.

=== Invasiveness ===

==== Results of invasion ====
&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; is a successful invasive species in South Africa. One of the results of its invasion in South Africa is a decrease in the biodiversity of the native environment. The increase of extinction rates of the native species is correlated with the introduction of these species to South Africa. Invasive species occupy habitats of native species often forcing them to extinction or endangerment. For example, invasive species have the potential to decrease the diversity of native plants by 50–86% in the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. &quot;P. pinaster&quot; is found in shrubland in South Africa; when compared to other environments, shrublands have the largest decline of species richness when invaded by an invasive species (Z=–1.33, p&lt;0.001). Compared to graminoids; trees, annual herbs, and creepers have a larger effect on decline of species richness (Z=–3.78; p&lt;0.001). Lastly, compared to other countries, South Africa had the largest species richness decline when faced with invasive species. South Africa is not home to many insects and diseases that limit the population of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; back in its native habitat. Not only is there evidence that alien plant invasions decrease biodiversity, but there is also evidence that the location of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; increases its negative effect on the species richness.

In addition, depending on the regions &quot;P. pinaster&quot; invades, &quot;P. pinaster&quot; has the potential to dramatically alter the quantity of water in the environment. If &quot;P. pinaster&quot; invades an area covered with grasses and shrubs, the water level of the streams in this area would lower significantly because &quot;P. pinaster&quot; are evergreen trees that take up considerably more water than grasses and shrubs all year around. They deplete run-off in catchment areas and water flow in rivers. This depletes the resources available for other species in the environment. &quot;P. pinaster&quot; tends to grow rapidly in riparian zones, which are areas with abundant water where trees and plants grow twice as fast and invade. &quot;P. pinaster&quot; takes advantage of the water available and consequently reduces the amount of water in the area available for other species. The fynbos catchments on the Western Cape of South Africa are a habitat negatively affected by &quot;P. pinaster&quot;. Twenty-three years after planting the pines, there was a 55% decrease in streamflow in this area. Similarly, in KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg there was an 82% reduction in streamflow 20 years after introducing &quot;P. pinaster&quot; to the area. In the Mpumalanga Province, 6 streams completely dried up 12 years after grasslands were replaced with pines. To reinforce that, there is a negative effect from the invasive species &quot;P. pinaster&quot;, these areas of dense &quot;P. pinaster&quot; were thinned and the number of trees in the area decreased. As a result, the streamflow in the fynbos catchments of the Western Cape increased by 44%. The streamflow in the Mpumalanga Province increased by 120%. As a result of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; growth, there is often less understory vegetation for livestock grazing. Once again there was a positive effect when some of the pines were removed and agreeable range grasses were planted. The grazing conditions for the sheep of the area were greatly improved when the &quot;P. pinaster&quot; plantation was thinned to 300 trees per hectare. The invasion of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; leads to the decrease of understory vegetation and therefore a decrease in livestock.

It is sporadically naturalizing in Oakland and San Leandro in northern California.

==== Ecological interactions ====

&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; is particularly successful in regions with fynbos vegetation because it is adapted to high-intensity fires, thus allowing it to outcompete other species that are not as well adapted to high-intensity fires. In areas of fire-prone shrubland, the cones of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; will release seeds when in a relatively high-temperature environment for germination as a recovery mechanism. This adaptation increases the competitive ability of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; amongst other species in the fire-prone shrubland. In a 3-year observational study done in Northwestern Spain, &quot;P. pinaster&quot; showed a naturally high regeneration rate. Observations showed a mean of 25.25 seedlings per square metre within the first year and then slowly decreased the next two years due to intraspecific competition. So not only does &quot;P. pinaster&quot; compete with other species, they also compete within their own species as well. When the height of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; increased there was a negative correlation with the number of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; seedlings, results showed a decrease in &quot;P. pinaster&quot; seedlings (r=–0.41, p&lt;0.05).

Several other characteristics contribute to their success in the regions they have invaded, including their ability to grow rapidly and to produce small seeds with large wings. Their ability to grow quickly with short juvenile periods allows them to outcompete many native species while their small seeds aids in their dispersal. The small seeds with large wings are beneficial for wind dispersal, which is the key to reaching new areas in regions with fynbos vegetation. Vertebrate seed dispersers are not commonly found in mountain fynbos vegetation; therefore those species that require the aid of vertebrate dispersal would be at a disadvantage in such an environment. For this reason, the small seed, low seed wing loading, and high winds found in mountainous regions all combine to provide a favorable situation for the dispersal of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; seeds. Without this efficient dispersal strategy, &quot;P. pinaster&quot; would not have been able to reach and invade areas, such as South Africa, that are suitable for its growth. Its dispersal ability is one of the key factors that have allowed &quot;P. pinaster&quot; to become such a successful invasive species.

In addition to being an efficient disperser, &quot;P. pinaster&quot; is known to produce oleoresins, such as oily terpenes or fatty acids, which can inhibit other species within the community from growing. These resins are produced as a defense mechanism against insect predators, such as the large pine weevil. According to an experiment done in Spain, the resin canal density was twice as high in the &quot;P. pinaster&quot; seedlings attacked by the weevils compared to the unattacked seedlings. Since &quot;P. pinaster&quot; has the ability to regulate their production of defense mechanisms, it can protect itself from predatory in an energy-efficient manner. The resins make the &quot;P. pinaster&quot; less vulnerable to damage from insects, but they are only produced in high concentrations when &quot;P. pinaster&quot; is under attack. In other words, &quot;P. pinaster&quot; does not waste energy producing resins in safe conditions, so the conserved energy can be used for growth or reproduction. These characteristics enhance the ability of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; survive and flourish in the areas it invades. Both the traits of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; and the habitat in South Africa are conducive to the success of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; in this region of the world.

==== Options for biological control ====
Insects and mites that feed on the seeds and cones of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; can be effective biological control options. An insect or mite that acts as an ideal biological control should have a high reproductive rate and be host-specific, meaning that it preys specifically on &quot;P. pinaster&quot;. The life cycle of the predator should also match that of its specific host. Two key characteristics the predator should also exhibit are self-limitation and the ability to survive in the presence of a declining prey population. Seed feeding insects are an effective control because they have high reproductive rates and target the seeds without diminishing the positive effect of the plant on the environment. Controlling the spread of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; seeds in the region is the key to limiting the growth and spread of this species because &quot;P. pinaster&quot; has the ability to produce a large number of seeds that are capable of dispersing very efficiently. One possible option is Trisetacus, an eriophyid mite. The main advantage to using this mite to control the population of &quot;P. Pinaster&quot; is its specificity to &quot;P. pinaster&quot;; it can effectively control the population of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; by destroying the growing conelets in &quot;P. pinaster&quot; while limiting its impact to only this species. Another possible option is &quot;Pissodes validirostris&quot;, a cone-feeding weevil that lays eggs in developing cones. When the larvae hatch, they feed on the growing seed tissue, preventing &quot;P. pinaster&quot; seeds from forming and dispersing. Although the adults feed on the trees as well, they do not do any damage to the seeds and only feed on the shoots of the tree, so they do not appear to negatively impact the growth of the trees. Different forms of &quot;P. validirostris&quot; have diverged to become host-specific to different pine trees. The type of &quot;P. validirostris&quot; that originated from Portugal appears to have specialized to &quot;P. pinaster&quot;; therefore, this insect may be used in the future to control the spread of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; in South Africa. The uncertainties regarding the host-specificity of different types of &quot;P. validirostris&quot;, however, require more research to be completed before the introduction of the weevils into South Africa. An introduction of a species that is not host-specific to &quot;P. pinaster&quot; can lead to detrimental effects on both the environment and industries that are dependent on certain tree species. Two other biological control possibilities include the pyralid moth species &quot;Dioryctria mendasella&quot; and &quot;D. mitatella&quot;, but these species attack the vegetative tissue instead of just the seeds of &quot;P. pinaster&quot;, harming the plant itself. As of now, the eriophyid mite and cone-feeding weevil seem to hold the most potential to controlling the spread of &quot;P. pinaster&quot; in the regions it has invaded because they destroy the reproductive structures of the target invasive species.

==Uses==

&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; is widely planted for timber in its native area, being one of the most important trees in forestry in France, Spain and Portugal. Landes forest in southwest France is the largest man-made maritime pine forest in Europe. It has also been cultivated in Australia as plantation tree, to provide softwood timber. &quot;P. pinaster&quot; resin is a useful source of turpentine and rosin.

In addition to industrial uses, maritime pine is also a popular ornamental tree, often planted in parks and gardens in areas with warm temperate climates. It has become naturalised in parts of southern England, Uruguay, Argentina, South Africa and Australia.

It is also used as a source of flavonoids, catechins, proanthocyanidins, and phenolic acids. A dietary supplement derived from extracts from &quot;P. pinaster&quot; bark called Pycnogenol is marketed with claims it can treat many conditions; however, according to a 2012 Cochrane review, the evidence is insufficient to support its use for the treatment of any chronic disorder.

==Pests==
&quot;Pestalotiopsis pini&quot; (a species of ascomycete fungi), was found as an emerging pathogen on &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; (Stone pine) and also on &quot;Pinus pinaster&quot; in Portugal. Evidence of shoot blight and stem necrosis were found in 2020. The fungus was found on needles, shoots and trunks of the pines.

<text>Russell Lincoln Ackoff (February 12, 1919 – October 29, 2009) was an American organizational theorist, consultant, and Anheuser-Busch Professor Emeritus of Management Science at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. Ackoff was a pioneer in the field of operations research, systems thinking and management science.

==Biography==
Russell L. Ackoff was born on February 12, 1919, in Philadelphia to Jack and Fannie (Weitz) Ackoff. He received his bachelor degree in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania in 1941. After graduation, he taught at Penn for one year as an assistant instructor in philosophy. From 1942 to 1946, he served in the U.S. Army in the Philippines. He returned to study at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his doctorate in philosophy of science in 1947 as C. West Churchman’s first doctoral student. He also received a number of honorary doctorates, from 1967 and onward.

From 1947 to 1951 Ackoff was assistant professor in philosophy and mathematics at the Wayne State University. He was associate professor and professor of operations research at Case Institute of Technology from 1951 to 1964. In 1961 and 1962 he was also visiting professor of operational research at the University of Birmingham. From 1964 to 1986 he was professor of systems sciences and professor of management science at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

Nicholson and Myers (1998) report that, in the 1970s and 1980s, the Social Systems Sciences Program at the Wharton School was &quot;noted for combining theory and practice, escaping disciplinary bounds, and driving students toward independent thought and action. The learning environment was fostered by distinguished standing and visiting faculty such as Eric Trist, C. West Churchman, Hasan Ozbekhan, Thomas A. Cowan, and Fred Emery&quot;.

Beginning in 1979, Ackoff worked together with John Pourdehnad as consultants in a broad range of industries including aerospace, chemicals, computer equipment, data services and software, electronics, energy, food and beverages, healthcare, hospitality, industrial equipment, automotive, insurance, metals, mining, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications, utilities, and transportation.

From 1986 to 2009, Ackoff was professor emeritus of the Wharton School, and chairman of Interact, the Institute for Interactive Management. From 1989 to 1995 he was visiting professor of marketing at Washington University in St. Louis.

Ackoff was president of Operations Research Society of America (ORSA) from 1956 to 1957, and he was president of the International Society for the Systems Sciences (ISSS) in 1987.

In 1965 Ackoff was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.
He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.
He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science at the University of Lancaster, UK in 1967. He got a Silver Medal from the Operational Research Society in 1971. Other honors came from the Washington University in St. Louis in 1993, the University of New Haven in 1997, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica Del Peru, Lima in 1999 and the University of Lincolnshire &amp; Humberside, UK in 1999. That year from the UK Systems Society he got an Award for outstanding achievement in Systems Thinking and Practice.

Ackoff married Alexandra Makar on July 17, 1949. The couple had three children: Alan W., Karen B., and Karla S. After his wife&#x27;s death, Ackoff married Helen Wald on December 20, 1987.

Between 2003 and 2007, Ackoff delivered an annual series of public lectures, both half-day and full-day, for which the Ackoff family has granted permission for public viewing at this link.

Russell L. Ackoff died unexpectedly Thursday, October 29, 2009, after complications of hip replacement surgery.

==Work==
Throughout the years Ackoff&#x27;s work in research, consulting and education has involved more than 250 corporations and 50 governmental agencies in the U.S. and abroad.

===Operations research===
Russell Ackoff started his career in operations research at the end of the 1940s. His 1957 book &quot;Introduction to Operations Research&quot;, co-authored with C. West Churchman and Leonard Arnoff, was one of the first publications that helped define the field. The influence of this work, according to Kirby and Rosenhead (2005), &quot;on the early development of the discipline in the USA and in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s is hard to over-estimate&quot;.

In the 1970s Ackoff became one of the most important critics of the so-called &quot;technique-dominated Operations Research&quot;, and started proposing more participative approaches. His critiques, according to Kirby and Rosenhead (2005), &quot;had little resonance within the USA, but were picked up both in Britain, where they helped to stimulate the growth of Problem Structuring Methods, and in the systems community world-wide&quot;, such as soft systems methodology from Peter Checkland.

===Purposeful systems===
In 1972 Ackoff wrote a book with Frederick Edmund Emery about purposeful systems, which focused on the question how systems thinking relates to human behaviour. &quot;Individual systems are purposive&quot;, they said, &quot;knowledge and understanding of their aims can only be gained by taking into account the mechanisms of social, cultural, and psychological systems&quot;.

Any human-created systems can be characterized as &quot;purposeful system&quot; when its &quot;members are also purposeful individuals who intentionally and collectively formulate objectives and are parts of larger purposeful systems&quot;. Other characteristics are:
* &quot;A purposeful system or individual is ideal-seeking if... it chooses another objective that more closely approximates its ideal&quot;.
* &quot;An ideal-seeking system or individual is necessarily one that is purposeful, but not all purposeful entities seek ideals&quot;, and
* &quot;The capability of seeking ideals may well be a characteristic that distinguishes man from anything he can make, including computers&quot;.

According to Kirby and Rosenhead (2005), &quot;the fact that these systems were experiencing profound change could be attributed to the end of the &quot;Machine Age&quot; and the onset of the &quot;Systems Age&quot;. The Machine Age, bequeathed by the Industrial Revolution, was underpinned by two concepts – reductionism (everything can in the end be decomposed into indivisible parts) and mechanism (cause-effect relationships)&quot;. Hereby &quot;all phenomena were believed to be explained by using only one ultimately simple relationship, &quot;cause-effect&quot;, which in the Systems Age are replaced by &quot;expansionism&quot; and &quot;teleology&quot; with &quot;producer-product&quot; replacing &quot;cause-effect&quot;. &quot;Expansionism&quot; is a doctrine maintaining that all objects and events, and all experiences of them, are parts of larger wholes.&quot; According to Ackoff, &quot;the beginning of the end of the Machine Age and the beginning of the Systems Age could be dated to the 1940s, a decade when philosophers, mathematicians, and biologists, building on developments in the interwar period, defined a new intellectual framework&quot;.

===f-Laws===
In 2006, Ackoff worked with Herbert J. Addison and Sally Bibb. They developed the term f-Law to describe a series of over 100 distilled observations of bad leadership and the misplaced wisdom that often surrounds management in organizations. A collection of subversive epigrams published in two volumes by &quot;Triarchy Press&quot;, these f-Laws expose the common flaws in both the practice of leadership and in the established beliefs that surround it. According to Ackoff &quot;f-Laws are truths about organizations that we might wish to deny or ignore – simple and more reliable guides to managers&#x27; everyday behavior than the complex truths proposed by scientists, economists, sociologists, politicians and philosophers&quot;.

===White House Communications Agency===
In collaboration with Dr. J. Gerald Suarez, Ackoff&#x27;s ideas were introduced and implemented at the White House Communications Agency and The White House Military Office during the Clinton and Bush administrations, a historic effort to bring the White House into the age of systems thinking.

===Relationship to Peter Drucker===
Russell Ackoff was friends with Peter Drucker from the earliest days of their careers. Mr. Drucker acknowledged the early, critical contribution Ackoff made to his work – and the world of management in general – in the following letter, which was delivered to Ackoff by former General Motors V.P. Vince Barabba on the occasion of the 3rd International Conference on Systems Thinking in Management (ICSTM) held at the University of Pennsylvania, May 19–24, 2004:

I was then, as you may recall, one of the early ones who applied Operations Research and the new methods of Quantitative Analysis to specific BUSINESS PROBLEMS—rather than, as they had been originally developed for, to military or scientific problems. I had led teams applying the new methodology in two of the world’s largest companies—GE and AT&amp;T. We had successfully solved several major production and technical problems for these companies—and my clients were highly satisfied. But I was not—we had solved TECHNICAL problems but our work had no impact on the organizations and on their mindsets. On the contrary: we had all but convinced the managements of these two big companies that QUANTITATIVE MANIPULATION was a substitute for THINKING. And then your work and your example showed us—or at least, it showed me—that the QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS comes AFTER the THINKING—it validates the thinking; it shows up intellectual sloppiness and uncritical reliance on precedent, on untested assumptions and on the seemingly “obvious.” But it does not substitute for hard, rigorous, intellectually challenging THINKING. It demands it, though—but does not replace it. This is, of course, what YOU mean BY system. And your work in those far-away days thus saved me—as it saved countless others—from either descending into mindless “model building” – the disease that all but destroyed so many of the Business Schools in the last decades—or from sloppiness parading as ‘insight.’

<doc id="1045271" wikidata="Q207572" url="?curid=1045271" title="Avallon">
<text>Avallon () is a commune in the Burgundian department of Yonne, in France.

==Name==
Avallon, Latin &quot;Aballō&quot;, ablative &quot;Aballone&quot;, is ultimately derived from Gaulish &quot;*Aballū&quot;, oblique &quot;*Aballon-&quot; meaning &quot;Apple-tree (place)&quot; or &quot;(place of the) &quot;Apple Tree Goddess&quot; (from Proto-Celtic &quot;*abalnā&quot;, cf. Old Irish &quot;aball&quot;, Welsh &quot;afall&quot;, Old Breton &quot;aball(en)&quot;, &quot;apple tree&quot;).

==Geography==
Avallon is located 50 km south-southeast of Auxerre, served by a branch of the Paris–Lyon railway and by exit 22 of the A6 motorway. The old town, with many winding cobblestone streets flanked by traditional stone and woodwork buildings, is situated on a flat promontory, the base of which is washed on the south by the river Cousin, on the east and west by small streams.

==History==
Chance finds of coins and pottery fragments and a fine head of Minerva are reminders of the Roman settlement carrying the Celtic name Aballo, a &quot;mutatio&quot; or post where fresh horses could be obtained. Two pink marble columns in the church of St-Martin du Bourg have been reused from an unknown temple (&quot;Princeton Encyclopedia&quot;). The Roman citadel, on a rocky spur overlooking the Cousin valley, has been Christianized as &quot;Montmarte&quot; (&quot;Mount of the Martyrs&quot;).

In the Middle Ages Avallon (Aballo) was the seat of a viscounty dependent on the duchy of Burgundy; on the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, it passed under the royal authority. The castle, mentioned as early as the seventh century, has utterly disappeared.

===King Arthur and the French Avallon theory===

A theory exists which proposes that the Isle of Avalon mentioned in Arthurian legend is, in fact, Avallon in Burgundy.

Geoffrey Ashe first mentioned the French Avallon theory in his 1985 book, &quot;The Discovery of King Arthur&quot;. His theory is that &quot;King Arthur&quot; is based on the historical Romano-British supreme king Riothamus, who reigned between 454–470, and whose life and campaigns have parallels to the accounts of &quot;King Arthur&quot; in the first medieval accounts of King Arthur by Geoffrey of Monmouth (, ). According to Ashe, in the year 470, Riothamus disappeared (and presumably died) in the neighborhood of Avallon after being defeated in the battle of Déols by Euric king of the Visigoths, whom the Western Roman Emperor Anthemius had hired Riothamus to fight against. This, and other aspects of his reign, made Ashe propose him as a candidate for the historical King Arthur, with Avallon becoming the Arthurian Avalon. No ancient source mentioning Riothamus places him anywhere near Avallon and Geoffrey of Monmouth, who is the first to mention &quot;the isle of Avalon&quot; (Latin &quot;insula Auallonis&quot;) and based his description of the isle on Classical descriptions of the Fortunate Isles, is explicit that it was an island in the western seas. In Geoffrey&#x27;s day (and, indeed, dating back to geographers of antiquity), the Fortunate Isles were identified with the Canary Islands.

==Population==
==Sights==
Its chief building, the formerly collegiate church of Saint-Lazare, dates from the twelfth century, on an earlier foundation dedicated to Notre Dame. Vestiges of the earlier church were revealed beneath the high altar in an excavation of 1861. The acquisition of a relic of Saint Lazare prompted its rededication: &quot;Saint Ladre&quot; is attested in the fourteenth century. It was the seat of an archdeaconate answering to the bishop of Autun. The two western portals are densely adorned with sculpture in the Romanesque style; the tower on the left of the facade was rebuilt in the seventeenth century. The Tour de l&#x27;Horloge, pierced by a gateway through which passes the Grande Rue, is an eleventh-century structure containing a museum on its second floor. Remains of the ancient fortifications, including seven of the flanking towers, are still to be seen. Avallon has a statue of Vauban, the military engineer of Louis XIV.

==Economy==

As of the early 20th century, the manufacture of biscuits and gingerbread, and the leather and farm implements supported the economy in Avallon, and there was considerable traffic on wood, wine, and the live-stock and agricultural produce in the surrounding country.

==Miscellaneous==

As of the early 20th century, the public institutions included the subprefecture, a tribunal of first instance, and a départemental college.

<doc id="1045272" wikidata="Q1936643" url="?curid=1045272" title="Mines and Works Act">
<text>The Mines and Work Act was a piece of legislation in South Africa, originally passed in 1911, amended in 1912 and 1926 before undergoing further changes in 1956 and 1959. This act legally established South Africa&#x27;s employment &quot;colour bar.&quot; and was enacted to establish the duties and responsibilities of workers in Mines and Works in South Africa.

==Colour Bar Act Reference==
This act (with/without/or its amendments) is sometimes referred to as the COLOUR BAR or the COLOUR BAR ACT. The term colour bar, however, usually refers to a group of labor practices, informal trade union practices, government regulations, and legislation, all of which were developed over time to prevent blacks from competing for certain categories of jobs monopolized by whites.

==Original 1911 Act==
This act included various regulations which gave &quot;white workers a monopoly of skilled operations&quot;. However, The Act did not specify that Black South Africans should be discriminated against in any way. Indeed, it made no mention of race or colour. Nor did it specifically and clearly give the government Mining Engineer powers to introduce a legal colour bar. But under section 4(n) it gave the Governor-General powers to grant, cancel and suspend certificates of competency to mine managers, mine overseers, mine surveyors, mechanical engineers, engine-drivers and miners entitled to blast. It also gave them the power to decide which other occupations should be required to possess certificates of competency

==MINES &amp; WORKS REGULATIONS ACT of 1912==
Some or other commission had criticized mine managements for employing large numbers of unskilled whites &#x27;often entirely ignorant of mining, and whose principal and often only recommendation is their physical fitness and their suitability for rough work&#x27;. Yet when the commission reported in 1910, it submitted draft regulations that were heavy with colour bars. Some appeared in the interpretation of terms, as when the words &#x27;white person&#x27; were inserted in the definition of banksman, onsetter, ganger and mine manager. Some took the form of an injunction to employ only whites in specified occupations, such as blasting, running elevators, driving engines, supervising boilers and other machinery; or as shift boss and mine overseer. Furthermore, only whites would be allowed to obtain the certificates of competence required, for instance, by engine drivers and boiler attendants. With some modifications, these draft regulations served as model for the MINES &amp; WORKS REGULATIONS ACT of 1912.

==MINES &amp; WORKS AMENDMENT ACT of 1926==
In contrast to the 1912 REGULATIONS, this Act bracketed Coloured with whites in a position of privilege. For there was no question of segregating the coloured who spoke the Afrikaner&#x27;s language, shared his outlook and stood closer to one than to the black population. Furthermore, the key section of this act &quot;stated that the minister, before announcing regulations for issuing certificates of competency (including the key blasting certificate, for nearly a century of license of the white miner), should seek the advice of the owners and of the organizations whose members hold a majority of the certificates, that is, the white unions, including the Mine Worker&#x27;s Union. He was to do this through the formation of advisory committees.&quot; This act was further revised in 1956 to deal with the declaration of work in the national interest.

<text>German-American Day () is a holiday in the United States, observed annually on October 6 under . It celebrates German-American heritage and commemorates the founding of Germantown, Pennsylvania (now part of Philadelphia), in 1683.

==History==
Though the founding of Germantown on October 6, 1683, was to provide the date for German-American Day, most of the first thirteen Quaker and Mennonite families in Germantown were religious refugees of Dutch origin rather than Germans and until 1710 Germantown remained predominantly Dutch. The town was nevertheless named Germantown, due to the influence of the leader of the earliest settlers, Francis Daniel Pastorius, who was German and later aligned himself with a group of fifty-four German families who had accompanied Johan Printz to the Swedish settlement on the Delaware several years earlier and had resettled themselves. These families subsequently founded Germantown, Pennsylvania, which, due to greater numbers, would subsequently be dominated by Germans within a generation, thanks in part to the efforts of Caspar Wistar.

==Observances==
In 1983, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed October 6 as German-American Day to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the founding of Germantown, Pennsylvania, and to celebrate German culture in the United States. On August 6, 1987, Congress approved S.J. Resolution 108, designating October 6, 1987, as German-American Day. It became when President Reagan signed it on August 18. A proclamation (#) to this effect was issued on October 2, 1987, by President Reagan in a formal ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, at which time the President called on Americans to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Presidents since then have continued to make proclamations to observe German-American Day.

<text>&quot;Sue Records was also the name of a Louisiana-based record company which owned Jewel Records (Shreveport record label).&quot;
Sue Records (&quot;The Sound of Soul&quot;) was an American record label founded by Henry &#x27;Juggy&#x27; Murray and Bobby Robinson in 1957. Subsidiaries on the label were [[Symbol Records]], Crackerjack Records, Broadway Records and [[Eastern Records]]. Sue also financed and distributed A.F.O. Records owned by Harold Battiste in New Orleans.

==History==
In 1957, Juggy Murray partnered with Bobby Robinson to create Sue Records in New York City. The label&#x27;s first release was &quot;Vengeance (Will Be Mine)&quot; by the Matadors later that year. Sue&#x27;s first hit record came in 1958 with &quot;Itchy Twitchy Feeling&quot; by Bobby Hendricks which peaked at #25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Success continued into the sixties with a handful of singles by R&amp;B duo Ike &amp; Tina Turner between 1960 and 1962. &quot;Mockingbird&quot; by brother-and-sister duo Inez and Charlie Foxx was a hit on the subsidiary label Symbol in 1963. Sue also had hits on the charts with &quot;Stick Shift&quot; by the Duals, &quot;Hurt by Love&quot; by Inez Foxx and &quot;That&#x27;s How Heartaches Are Made&quot; by Justine &quot;Baby&quot; Washington. Sue also released early recordings by the soul singer Don Covay and albums by the soul-jazz organist Jimmy McGriff. Guitarist Jimi Hendrix signed his first recording contract with Sue in 1965, but no recordings were released.

Murray initially released his records in the UK through Decca&#x27;s London Records but switched to a licensing deal with Island Records in 1964. This deal resulted in a split in the ownership of the Sue name. Island used the label to distribute Sue in the UK. Problems began when Island also leased discs from other US labels that interested them and released them on UK Sue too - which was not in the agreement. Murray terminated the agreement and returned to Decca in 1966.

After failing to chart in the U.S., Murray sold the Sue masters to United Artists Records in 1968. A reissue of the &quot;Harlem Shuffle&quot; by Bob &amp; Earl made the Top 10 in Britain in 1969. Murray retained rights to the Sue name and constantly attempted to re-activate the label until his death in 2005. The Sue Records catalog eventually ended up with EMI, and then with Universal Music Group upon EMI&#x27;s being bought out in 2012.

EMI released a 4-CD box-set &quot;The Sue Records Story: The Sound of Soul&quot; in 1994, while Ace Records later released four volumes of &quot;The UK Sue Label Story.&quot;

==Discography==
Sue Records were best known for their R&amp;B and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll singles but released a number of LPs between 1958 and 1966 featuring popular and jazz artists.

<doc id="1045287" wikidata="Q983176" url="?curid=1045287" title="Tomohiro Nishikado">
<text>is a Japanese video game developer and engineer. He is the creator of the arcade shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, released to the public in 1978 by the Taito Corporation of Japan, often credited as the first shoot &#x27;em up and for beginning the golden age of arcade video games. Prior to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, he also designed other earlier Taito arcade games, including the shooting electro-mechanical games &quot;Sky Fighter&quot; (1971) and &quot;Sky Fighter II&quot;, the sports video game &quot;TV Basketball&quot; in 1974, the vertical scrolling racing video game &quot;Speed Race&quot; (also known as &quot;Wheels&quot;) in 1974, the multi-directional shooter &quot;Western Gun&quot; (also known as &quot;Gun Fight&quot;) in 1975, and the first-person combat flight simulator &quot;Interceptor&quot; (1975).

==Early life and career==
Tomohiro Nishikado was born in 1944. He began conducting his own science experiments at an early age and, in junior high school, started working with electronics by building radios and amplifiers. He graduated with an engineering degree from Tokyo Denki University in 1967. He had originally planned to work for Sony, but failed the final round of the company&#x27;s testing process, so he instead joined an audio engineering company called Takt in early 1967. But after completing his training there he was not put in the development department, so he quit a year later and looked for a new job, eventually accepting a job offer from a communications company. Before beginning work, he met an old colleague at a train station who told him about the work he was doing at Taito, which Nishikado found interesting. His friend told him that Taito were desperately searching for new engineers, so Nishikado decided to join Taito instead of the communications company.

He joined Pacific Industries Ltd in 1968, a subsidiary of Taito Trading Company. He began working on arcade electro-mechanical games, developing the hit target shooting games &quot;Sky Fighter&quot; (1971) and &quot;Sky Fighter II&quot;. His bosses at Taito believed transistor-transistor logic (TTL) technology would play a significant role in the arcade industry, so they tasked Nishikado with investigating TTL technology as he was the company&#x27;s only employee who knew how to work with integrated circuit (IC) technology, and one of the few engineers at any Japanese coin-op company with significant expertise in solid-state electronics.

He began working on video game development in 1972. He was interested in creating arcade video games, so he spent six months dissecting Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; arcade unit and learning how the game&#x27;s integrated circuits worked, and began modifying the game. He developed &quot;Elepong&quot; (similar to &quot;Pong&quot;), one of Japan&#x27;s earliest locally produced arcade video games, released in 1973. He produced more than ten video games up until 1977, before &quot;Space Invaders&quot; was released in 1978.

==Best known games==
===&quot;Sky Fighter&quot; and &quot;Sky Fighter II&quot;===
Nishikado developed &quot;Sky Fighter&quot;, a target shooting electro-mechanical game released by Taito for amusement arcades in 1971. The game used mirrors to project images of model planes in front of a moving sky-blue background from a film canister on a rotating drum. The game was a hit, but too large for most locations, so it was followed by a scaled-down version, &quot;Sky Fighter II&quot;, which sold 3,000 arcade cabinets.

===&quot;Soccer&quot; and &quot;Davis Cup&quot;===
His first original arcade video games were the &quot;Pong&quot;-style sports video games &quot;Soccer&quot; and &quot;Davis Cup&quot;, with &quot;Soccer&quot; developed first but both released in November 1973. &quot;Davis Cup&quot; was a team sport video game, a tennis doubles game with similar ball-and-paddle gameplay to &quot;Pong&quot; but played in doubles, allowing up to four players to compete, like Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong Doubles&quot; (1973) released the same year. &quot;Soccer&quot; was also a team sport video game, based on association football. &quot;Soccer&quot; was also a ball-and-paddle game like &quot;Pong&quot;, but with a green background to simulate a playfield, allowed each player to control both a forward and a goalkeeper, and let them adjust the size of the players who were represented as paddles on screen. It also had a goal on each side. Nishikado considers &quot;Soccer&quot; to be Japan&#x27;s first original domestically produced video game, in comparison to Japanese &quot;Pong&quot; clones released earlier, including Sega&#x27;s &quot;Pong Tron&quot; and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Elepong&quot;.

===&quot;TV Basketball&quot;===
 was an arcade basketball video game released by Taito in April 1974. It was designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, who wanted to move beyond simple rectangles to character graphics. Taito released the game in Europe as Basketball in 1974.

It was the earliest use of character sprites to represent human player characters in a video game. The gameplay was largely similar to earlier ball-and-paddle games, but with human-like characters rather than simple rectangles. Nishikado came up with the concept by taking &quot;a typical pong game&quot; and rearranging the shapes so that they looked like objects such as a basketball hoop. It was also the earliest basketball video game in arcades, and the second basketball-themed video game in general, after the &quot;Basketball&quot; overlay released for the Magnavox Odyssey console in 1973.

In February 1974, &quot;TV Basketball&quot; became the earliest non-American video game to be licensed for release in North America, with a deal initially made with Atari. However, the game instead ended up being licensed to Midway Manufacturing, who released the game in North America as &quot;TV Basketball&quot; in June 1974. It sold 1,400 arcade cabinets in the United States, a video game production record for Midway, up until the release of &quot;Wheels&quot;. &quot;TV Basketball&quot; was the first basketball video game released by Midway, which later followed with &quot;Arch Rivals&quot; (1989) and &quot;NBA Jam&quot; (1993).

===&quot;Speed Race&quot; (&quot;Wheels&quot;)===
Nishikado&#x27;s &quot;Speed Race&quot; was a driving racing video game, released in November 1974. He considers it to be his favourite among the games he had worked on prior to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. It was also one the first Japanese video games released in North America, where it was distributed by Midway. Running on Taito Discrete Logic hardware, the game used sprites with collision detection. The game&#x27;s most important innovation was its introduction of scrolling graphics, where the sprites moved along a vertical scrolling overhead track, with the course width becoming wider or narrower as the player&#x27;s car moves up the road, while the player races against other rival cars, more of which appear as the score increases. The faster the player&#x27;s car drives, the more the score increases. The game&#x27;s concept was adapted from two earlier electro-mechanical driving games: Kasco&#x27;s &quot;Mini Drive&quot; (1958) and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Super Road 7&quot; (1970).

In contrast to the volume-control dials used in his earlier &quot;Pong&quot;-inspired machines, &quot;Speed Race&quot; had a realistic racing wheel controller, with an accelerator, gear shift, speedometer and tachometer. It could be played in either single-player or alternating two-player, where each player attempts to beat the other&#x27;s score. The game also had selectable difficulty levels, giving players an option between &quot;Beginner&#x27;s race&quot; and &quot;Advanced player&#x27;s race&quot;. The game was re-branded as &quot;Wheels&quot; by Midway for released in the United States and was influential on later racing games. Midway also released a version called &quot;Racer&quot; in the United States. &quot;Wheels&quot; and &quot;Wheels II&quot; sold 10,000 cabinets in the United States to become the best-selling arcade game of 1975.

The game received nine sequels:

* &quot;Speed Race Deluxe&quot; (1975)
* &quot;Speed Race Twin&quot; (1976)
* &quot;Super Speed Race&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Super Speed Race V&quot; (1978)
* &quot;T. T. Speed Race CL&quot; (1978)
* &quot;Speed Race CL-5&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Super Speed Race GP V&quot; (1980)
* &quot;Super Speed Race Jr.&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Automobili Lamborghini: Super Speed Race 64&quot; (1998)

===&quot;Western Gun&quot; (&quot;Gun Fight&quot;)===
His next major title was &quot;Western Gun&quot; (known as &quot;Gun Fight&quot; in the United States), released in 1975. The game&#x27;s concept was adapted from a Sega arcade electro-mechanical game, called &quot;Gun Fight&quot; (1969), with the cowboy figurines adapted into character sprites and both players able to maneuver across a landscape while shooting each other. The game is historically significant for several reasons. It was an early on-foot, multi-directional shooter, that could be played in single-player or two-player. It also introduced video game violence, being the first video game to depict human-to-human combat, and the first to depict a gun on screen. The game introduced dual-stick controls, with one eight-way joystick for movement and the other for changing the shooting direction, and was one of the earliest video games to represent game characters and fragments of story through its visual presentation.

The player characters used in the game represented avatars for the players, and would yell &quot;Got me!&quot; when one of them is shot. Other features of the game included obstacles such as a cactus, and in later levels, pine trees and moving wagons, that can provide cover for the players and are destructible. The guns have limited ammunition, with each player limited to six bullets, and shots can ricochet off the top or bottom edges of the playfield, allowing for indirect hits to be used as a strategy.

&quot;Western Gun&quot; was his next game licensed to Midway for release in the United States, with the title changed to &quot;Gun Fight&quot; for its American release. Midway&#x27;s &quot;Gun Fight&quot; adaptation was itself notable for being the first video game to use a microprocessor. Nishikado&#x27;s &quot;Western Gun&quot; allowed the two players to move around anywhere on the screen, whereas Midway&#x27;s version &quot;Gun Fight&quot; restricts each player to their respective portions of the screen, with the characters made larger in size. Nishikado believed that his original version was more fun, but was impressed with the improved graphics and smoother animation of Midway&#x27;s version. This led him to design microprocessors into his subsequent games.

&quot;Gun Fight&quot; was a success in the arcades, selling 8,600 arcade cabinets in the United States, where it was the third highest-grossing arcade game of 1975 and the second highest-grossing arcade game of 1976. The game was ported to the Bally Astrocade console and several computer platforms. &quot;Gun Fight&#x27;s&quot; success helped pave the way for Japanese video games in the American market.

===&quot;Interceptor&quot;===
 is a first-person combat flight simulator designed by Tomohiro Nishikado. The game was first demonstrated in 1975, before releasing in Japan in March 1976, and in Europe the same year. It involved piloting a jet fighter, using an eight-way joystick to aim with a crosshair and shoot at enemy aircraft that move in formations of two, can scale in size depending on their distance to the player, and can move out of the player&#x27;s firing range. The game used a form of pseudo-3D object-scaling to create the illusion of 3D space, a technique that was later used in racing video games such as Atari&#x27;s &quot;Night Driver&quot; (1976) and Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pole Position&quot; (1982), and more extensively in Sega Super Scaler arcade games during the mid-to-late 1980s.

===&quot;Space Invaders&quot;===
In 1977, Nishikado began developing &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, which he created entirely on his own. In addition to designing and programming the game, he also did the artwork and sounds, and engineered the game&#x27;s arcade hardware, putting together a microcomputer from scratch. Following its release in 1978, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; went on to become his most successful video game. It is frequently cited as the &quot;first&quot; or &quot;original&quot; in the shoot &#x27;em up genre.

&quot;Space Invaders&quot; pitted the player against multiple enemies descending from the top of the screen at a constantly increasing speed. The game used alien creatures inspired by &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; because the developers were unable to render the movement of aircraft; in turn, the aliens replaced human enemies because of moral concerns (regarding the portrayal of killing humans) on the part of Taito. As with subsequent shoot &#x27;em ups of the time, the game was set in space as the available technology only permitted a black background. The game also introduced the idea of giving the player a number of &quot;lives&quot;. It sold over 360,000 arcade cabinets worldwide, and by 1981 had grossed more than $1 billion, equivalent to $2.5 billion in 2011.

As one of the earliest shooter games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon&#x27;s movement. It was also the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first game to save the player&#x27;s score. It was also the first game where players had to repel hordes of creatures, take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers, in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple chromatic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, though it was dynamic and changed pace during stages. It also moved the gaming industry away from &quot;Pong&quot;-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; set the template for the shoot &#x27;em up genre, with its influence extending to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Halo&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty&quot;.

Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers &quot;Space Invaders&quot; a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it, and it would inspire him to produce video games. Several publications ascribe the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game, attributing the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The game&#x27;s success is also credited for ending the video game crash of 1977 and beginning the golden age of video arcade games. The launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America was in part due to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; considers it, along with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades. The game also played an important role during the second generation of consoles, when it became the Atari 2600&#x27;s first killer app, establishing Atari as the market leader in the home video game market at the time. &quot;Space Invaders&quot; is today regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time.

==Later career==
Nishikado&#x27;s later credited games for Taito included the racing video game &quot;Chase HQ II: Special Criminal Investigation&quot; in 1989, the scrolling shooters &quot;Darius II&quot; (&quot;Sagaia&quot;) in 1989 and &quot;Darius Twin&quot; in 1991, the platform game &quot;Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III&quot; in 1991, the SNES role-playing video game &quot;Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom&quot; in 1993, the beat &#x27;em up &quot;Sonic Blast Man II&quot; in 1994, and the puzzle game &quot;Bust-A-Move 2&quot; (&quot;Puzzle Bobble 2&quot;) in 1995.

He left Taito in 1996 to found his own company, Dreams. Under Dreams when it was owned by Nishikado, his credited games include &quot;Bust-A-Move Millennium&quot;, published by Acclaim Entertainment in 2000.

Dreams is also credited for &quot;Chase HQ: Secret Police&quot; published by Metro3D for the Game Boy Color in 1999, the 3D eroge visual novel &quot;Dancing Cats&quot; published by Illusion for the PC in 2000, &quot;Super Bust-A-Move&quot; (&quot;Super Puzzle Bobble&quot;) published by Taito for the PlayStation 2 in 2000, &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot; (&quot;Bubble Bobble 2&quot;) and &quot;Shaun Palmer&#x27;s Pro Snowboarder&quot; for the Game Boy Color in 2001, and the 2008 Nintendo DS version of &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot;. He personally oversaw the development of &quot;Space Invaders Revolution&quot;, released by Taito in 2005, and was involved in the development of &quot;Space Invaders Infinity Gene&quot;, released by Taito&#x27;s current owner Square Enix in 2008. Dreams was involved in the development of the fighting game &quot;Battle Fantasia&quot;, released by Arc System Works in 2008.

As of 2013, he is no longer with Dreams, and presently works for Taito as a technical advisor.

*&quot;Prologue from the Trumps of Doom&quot;
::Merlin walks the Logrus, wearing his strangling cord Frakir.
*&quot;The Salesman&#x27;s Tale&quot;
::Luke flees the Pattern – having just spilled on it, not his own blood (which he apparently was in a position to do) but a harmless cup of tea, and bought himself a split second to trick even the Pattern that way – and takes refuge in the Crystal Cave. He and Vialle learn that the redistribution of the spikards will force a confrontation involving Amber and the Courts of Chaos.
*&quot;Blue Horse, Dancing Mountains&quot;
::Corwin flees the Courts of Chaos through a part of Shadow called the Dancing Mountains, having been given a new steed – a sentient shapechanger named Shask – as a gift by his son Merlin. He eavesdrops on a game of chess between Dworkin and Suhuy, and learns he has an appointment at the Hall of Mirrors in Amber Castle.
*&quot;The Shroudling and the Guisel&quot;
::Merlin&#x27;s childhood sweetheart Rhanda appears. She warns him of an unknown sorcerer who seeks the throne of the Courts of Chaos and has sent a beast called a &quot;guisel&quot; to kill him. He succeeds in destroying it with the help of the Vorpal Blade, and sends another one back to pursue the mystery sorcerer.
*&quot;Coming to a Cord&quot;
::Frakir escapes from Brand&#x27;s bedpost where Merlin left her, locates Flora, and eventually asks Luke&#x27;s help in returning to Merlin. A conversation with Flora is interrupted by a mystery sorcerer who enters and exits through mirrors, pursued by a weird beast called a guisel. Luke uses the power of Werewindle – revealed to be a transformed spikard, like Merlin&#x27;s ring (and also Corwin&#x27;s sword Grayswandir) – to destroy it.
*&quot;Hall of Mirrors&quot;
::Corwin discovers that traveling through the Dancing Mountains made him the subject of an unusual spell. He returns to Amber Castle and meets Luke – who apparently prefers to be called by his alter-ego name, rather than his true name &quot;Rinaldo&quot;, even by those who know him as &quot;Rinaldo&quot; – and they enter the Hall of Mirrors and are forced to duel. Fiona and Mandor are present: It is unclear whether they are in charge, or merely blameless observers as they claim to be. Both are seriously wounded (their weapons forcing them into confrontation against their wills) but both survive. It is revealed that Castle Amber itself appears to be sufficiently sentient to be attempting to influence affairs.</text><links>

<text>Sebastian Santa Maria (September 24, 1959-October 20, 1996) was a Chilean-Swiss musician. He was born in 1959 in Santiago, Chile, but settled in Lausanne, Switzerland at age 17.

He played the piano in several clubs in Lausanne until beginning a fertile career as a composer, composing a number of songs including some made for Catherine Lara, Bernard Lavilliers, for Viktor Lazlo&#x27;s album My Delicious Poisons and Isabelle Adjani.

Besides these composing activities, he also played numerous piano duet jazz concerts with François Lindemann, and a few years later, he founded with Lindemann a unique group of seven Steinways called Piano Seven.

He also participated in the reincarnation of British band The Zombies, playing on their 1991 album, &quot;New World&quot;. As a solo artist, he released a few singles and one full-length album (&quot;Latino&quot;, 1994). A second album, &quot;Corpus&quot;, was released posthumously in 1997.

Santa Maria died of adrenoleukodystrophy in 1996 in Lausanne.

<text>Thomas Albert Sebeok (, ; November 9, 1920December 21, 2001) was a Hungarian-born American polymath, semiotician, and linguist. As one of the founders of the biosemiotics field, he studied non-human and cross-species signaling and communication. He is also known for his work in the development of long-term nuclear waste warning messages, in which he worked with the Human Interference Task Force (established 1981) to create methods for keeping the inhabitants of Earth away from buried nuclear waste that will still be hazardous 10,000 or more years in the future.

== Early life and education ==
Thomas Sebeok was born on November 9, 1920, in Budapest, Hungary. He attended secondary school at the famous Fasori Gimnázium, which educated notables such as John von Neumann and Eugene Wigner. After a brief stint at Cambridge University (Magdalene College) in England, he moved to the United States at the age of 17 and became a naturalized citizen in 1944.
Sebeok earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1941 at the University of Chicago. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in anthropological linguistics, under the external guidance of Roman Jakobson, at Princeton University in 1943 and, in 1945, a doctorate at Princeton University; his dissertation was titled &quot;Finnish and Hungarian case systems: their form and function&quot;.

== Academic work ==
In 1943, Sebeok started work at Indiana University in Bloomington, assisting the Amerindianist Carl Voegelin in managing the country&#x27;s largest Army Specialized Training Program in foreign languages. He then created the university&#x27;s department of Uralic and Altaic Studies, covering the languages of Eastern Europe, Russia and Asia. He was also the chair of the university&#x27;s Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies.

As a professor at Indiana University, Sebeok studied both human and non-human systems of signaling and communication, as well as the philosophy of mind. He was among the founders of biosemiotics, and coined the term &quot;zoosemiotics&quot; in 1963 to describe the development of signals and signs by non-human animal species. He also continued his work as a linguist, publishing several articles and books analyzing aspects of the Mari language (referring to it by the name &quot;Cheremis&quot;). His transdisciplinary work and professional collaborations spanned the fields of anthropology, biology, folklore studies, linguistics, psychology, and semiotics.

Sebeok was the editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Semiotica&quot;, the leading periodical in the field, from its establishing in 1969 until 2001. He was also the editor of several book series and encyclopedias, including &quot;Approaches to Semiotics&quot; (over 100 volumes), &quot;Current Trends in Linguistics&quot;, and the &quot;Encyclopedic Dictionary of Semiotics&quot;.

In 1980, Sebeok along with Robert Rosenthal participated in a conference named &quot;The Clever Hans Phenomenon: Communication with Horses, Whales, Apes and People&quot; held by the New York Academy of Sciences which casts doubt upon the research efforts regarding ape communication, including but not limited to the works of Herbert S. Terrace, Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh. In particular, the conference suggests that the apes could have been cued or their communication had been misinterpretated.

Later in the early 1980s, Sebeok composed a report for the US Office of Nuclear Waste Management titled &quot;Communication Measures To Bridge Ten Millennia&quot;, discussing solutions to the problem of nuclear semiotics, a system of signs aimed at warning future civilizations from entering geographic areas contaminated by nuclear waste. The report proposed a &quot;folkloric relay system&quot; and the establishment of an &quot;atomic priesthood&quot; of physicists, anthropologists, and semioticians to create and preserve a common cultural narrative of the hazardous nature of nuclear waste sites.

In addition to his academic work, Sebeok organized hundreds of international conferences and institutes, held leadership roles in organizations such as the Linguistic Society of America, International Association for Semiotic Studies, Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, and the Semiotic Society of America, and supported the creation of linguistic and semiotics teaching programs and scholarly associations throughout the world.

Sebeok&#x27;s personal library on semiotics, comprising more than 4,000 volumes of books and 700 journals, is preserved at the Department of Semiotics at the University of Tartu in Estonia. His correspondence and research files are held by the Indiana University Archives.

== Personal life ==
Sebeok married Mary Eleanor Lawton (1912–2005) in 1947. They had one child, Veronica C. Wald, and later divorced. Sebeok married Donna Jean Umiker (born 1946, now D. Jean Umiker-Sebeok), a fellow semiotic scholar and his frequent collaborator and co-author, in 1973, and they had two children, Jessica A. Sebeok and Erica L. Sebeok. Sebeok retired from Indiana University in 1991, but he contributed to the field of semiotics until his death in 2001.

== Sebeok Fellow Award ==
The Sebeok Fellow Award &quot;recognizes outstanding contributions to the development of the doctrine of signs&quot; and is the highest honor given by the Semiotic Society of America. It is awarded every 2 to 4 years. Recipients have included David Savan (1992), John Deely (1993), Paul Bouissac (1996), Jesper Hoffmeyer (2000), Kalevi Kull (2003), Floyd Merrell (2005), Susan Petrilli (2008), Irmengard Rauch (2011), Paul Cobley (2014), Vincent Colapietro (2018), Nathan Houser (2019), Marcel Danesi (2020).

<text>My Name Is Legion () is an anthology of three stories by American writer Roger Zelazny, compiled in 1976. The stories feature a common protagonist who is never named.

==Plot summary==

The protagonist of these stories is involved in the creation of a global computer network designed to give ultimate economic control by keeping track of all human activity. Just before the system goes live, the hero expresses his concerns about the possible misuse of such power to his superior, who gives the hero the chance to destroy his personal data before it is to be entered into the system. In taking this step the hero becomes non-existent as far as the system is concerned. Using backdoors in the central network, the hero is able to create identities for himself as needed. With this freedom he sets himself up as a freelance investigator and problem solver.

== Stories ==

The following stories are included in the anthology:

* &quot;The Eve of RUMOKO&quot;: Project RUMOKO is a plan to use nuclear explosives to create artificial islands; the hero must identify and stop a saboteur on the project.
* &quot;&#x27;Kjwalll&#x27;kje&#x27;k&#x27;koothai&#x27;lll&#x27;kje&#x27;k&quot;: At a research station in the Bahamas a diver has died, apparently in an attack by a dolphin... But dolphins do not attack humans, and someone suspects foul play.
* &quot;Home Is the Hangman&quot;: A sentient space-exploration robot, lost years before, has apparently returned to Earth. One of its original designers has died under suspicious circumstances. Has the Hangman returned to kill its creators? The hero must find the Hangman and stop it, and time is running out. This story won the 1976 Hugo Award for Best Novella.

<text>Thomas David Mischke (born September 19, 1962) is an American writer, musician, podcaster, and former radio talk show host on WCCO NewsRadio 830 based in Minneapolis. He was formerly employed as a weekly columnist at &quot;City Pages&quot;, a Twin Cities alternative news, arts and entertainment publication. For 17 years he hosted &quot;The Mischke Broadcast&quot; on am1500 KSTP. His show featured quirky regular callers, stream of consciousness humor, and experts on any topic he found interesting. Since 1998, Mischke has been the winner of the &quot;Best AM Radio Personality&quot; award given by the local weekly alternative newspaper &quot;City Pages&quot; nine times.

Mischke hosted a daily webcast entitled &quot;In the Stream&quot; for &quot;City Pages&quot; from March 2009 until February 2010. He was most recently the host of &quot;The Nite Show&quot; weekdays from 10 PM to Midnight on WCCO Radio. He decided to retire from radio in the summer of 2013. His final show on WCCO was August 1.

In May 2014 Mischke launched &quot;The Mischke Roadshow.&quot; The monthly podcast features interviews, music and comedy bits.

In February of 2025 Mischke announced he will be retiring The Mischke Roadshow and starting a new podcast for Hubbard Broadcasting.

== Early life ==
Mischke was born into a large Catholic family of six boys and two girls. He grew up in St. Paul&#x27;s Macalester-Groveland neighborhood. After a stint at Cretin High School, he graduated from Highland Park Senior High.

== Broadcasting career ==
In 1986–1987, Mischke was known as &quot;The Phantom Caller&quot; on Don Vogel&#x27;s show, where he would randomly call in (without identifying himself) with tightly-written, sixty-second comedic bits. He so amused the radio personality that he was invited to become Don&#x27;s sidekick on his show, &quot;Afternoon Saloon&quot;, on KSTP in 1992, during Vogel&#x27;s second stint in the Twin Cities. After the stint as a sidekick, Mischke was given his own program on am1500 in January 1994. A feature of his Friday night show was an hour called &quot;Misfit Friday&quot;, where rules were relaxed and callers were free to contribute in creative ways, such as &quot;The Singing Bandit&quot;, who would call and sing short songs he had written, and then immediately hang up. One staple of Misfit Friday was a regular caller who Tommy dubbed &quot;Psycho Ray&quot; (a.k.a. Raymond Armstrong). Psycho Ray often hinted at stalking Tommy, giving only vague inferences as to his activities; conversations about his hobbies included knife sharpening, gun cleaning, and hanging out with his auto mechanic girlfriend &quot;Jodi&quot;. Eventually, Ray was banned from calling in to the show by KSTP management for &quot;firing a gun&quot; on the air (revealed later to be just firecrackers), which resulted in an immediate storm of calls ranging from urging caution to ignoring Ray for being &quot;all talk&quot;.

On December 15, 2004, Mischke released &quot;Whistle Stop&quot;, a collection of his music. He performed on fellow Twin Cities broadcaster Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; on the September 2, 2006 show.

On January 3, 2006, the Mischke Broadcast returned from the Christmas hiatus to a new timeslot and an altered format. The new hours, a late drive-time shift of 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, prompted the new format, the station banning many of the trademark Mischke bits including his prank 411 calls and the pockets of dead air that would occasionally fill large portions of his show. Mischke, in announcing the change, said, &quot;the Mischke Broadcast, as you know it, is finished,&quot; though he assured listeners the move was a positive one for both him and KSTP.

Mischke released his second CD, &quot;That Kind of Day&quot; on December 4, 2008.

Mischke was abruptly fired by KSTP on December 5, 2008 for making a phone call on the air without first getting the recipient&#x27;s permission, an FCC violation Mischke said he&#x27;d made before.

Mischke hosted a daily webcast for the weekly Twin Cities alternative newspaper &quot;City Pages&quot;. The show, entitled &quot;In the Stream&quot;, premiered on March 4, 2009. Mischke ended the webcast on February 4, 2010, but continued his weekly column for City Pages.

Mischke started a new radio show on May 10, 2010 10pm-Midnight, Mon-Thurs on WCCO 830 on the AM dial. On August 1, 2013, Mischke did his final radio show at WCCO.

Soon after, Mischke launched a new podcast entitled &quot;The Mischke Roadshow.&quot; In 2023 he told the Star Tribune:&quot;I created a road show, looking all over the United States for eccentrics and iconoclasts. Remember I said I was sort of a misfit? I wanted to find other misfits. People seeing life differently, living life differently. Having experiences wildly different than the average person.&quot;

In 2024, Mischke published his first book &quot;Winter&#x27;s Song: A Hymn To The North&quot; Also in March 2024, the documentary &quot;The Phantom Caller of the Twin Cities&quot; by host/producer Kyle Shiely was published by KFAI.

<doc id="1045341" wikidata="Q8563413" url="?curid=1045341" title="Fish paste">
<text>Fish paste is fish which has been chemically broken down by a fermentation process until it reaches the consistency of a soft creamy purée or paste. Alternatively it refers to cooked fish that has been physically broken down by pounding, grinding, pressing, mincing, , and/or sieving, until it reaches the consistency of paste. The term can be applied also to shellfish pastes, such as shrimp paste or crab paste.

Fish paste is used as a condiment or seasoning to add flavour to food, or in some cases to complement a dish. Generally, fish paste is reduced to a thick, rich concentrate, which has usually been cooked for a long time. It can be contrasted with fish sauce, which is like a fish paste except it is not cooked for so long, is a thick liquid rather than a concentrated paste, and may include seasonings and other flavorings.

== History ==
&quot;Preservation of marine products is of great importance to the coastal poor. Preserved fish products ensure adequate protein during low fishing periods. Subsistence fishers use their abundant catch of small fish to make fermented fish paste and smoked fish with the assistance of family members.&quot;

<doc id="1045343" wikidata="Q7522655" url="?curid=1045343" title="Sing Blue Silver">
<text>Sing Blue Silver is a documentary about Duran Duran&#x27;s 1983–1984 world tour directed by Michael Collins. A sixty-minute edited version of the documentary was aired on MTV (and later other music channels) under the title Blue Silver.

&quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot; was originally released on videotape (in VHS and Betamax formats) and on LaserDisc, near the end of 1984. It was re-issued on DVD in April 2004. A 1984 book of the same name featured still photography by official tour photographer Denis O&#x27;Regan.
The title comes from a verse from the song &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;, released in 1982. It was certified gold by the RIAA (&quot;Billboard&quot; magazine week ending February 23, 1985).

==Synopsis==
Filmed at the height of their fame, &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot; follows the band around Canada and the United States for three months from 30 January to 17 April 1984 as they toured in support of their &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; album around North America.

Primarily, &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot; is about the job of making music, so live musical performances feature quite heavily throughout the video.

The documentary features many other standout moments, including a Francesco Scavullo photo shoot in New York, meeting a couple of L.A. Raiders players backstage, and a Beatles-style press conference tinged with a bit of comedy. It also captures the band in more candid moments, from backstage antics to trying to stay entertained on the journey between cities.

The film also documented the band&#x27;s teen idol status, showing hordes of hysterical young—mainly female—fans attempting to cope with seeing their heroes in a live arena.

Live footage from this tour was later used for the &quot;Arena (An Absurd Notion)&quot; long-form video and the &quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot; concert video. The video for &quot;The Reflex&quot; was shot at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on 5 March 1984.

Michael Collins left the tour after the first few weeks.

<text>Total Science is the stage name of drum and bass producers Jason Greenhalgh and Paul Smith.

The pair first met in 1987, both living on Blackbird Leys estate in Oxford, England and brought together through a mutual love of hip hop. Distracted by the arrival of hardcore in the early nineties, the pair&#x27;s record collecting was quickly followed by DJing, and eventually production. Greenhalgh launched his career under the moniker Q Project with &quot;Freestyle Fanatic&quot; in 1991. In 1994, the pair started recording together under the name Funky Technicians, with &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot; the first in a series of records which pushed the label away from the darkside movement and toward labels like Lucky Spin, Basement, and Good Looking. After six years of recording singles for others, the pair established the CIA label in the closing months of 1997 with the help of Brillo from Timeless Recordings. The release of their &quot;Silent Reign EP&quot; for Goldie&#x27;s Metalheadz was another important release for the project, coming before a Bad Company remix of &quot;Champion Sound&quot; for their own label. Their debut album, &quot;Advance&quot;, was released in 2000, and featured downtempo experiments logged as a series of &quot;Breaks&quot; on the majority of their early EPs.

<text>Kenneth Donald Macintosh (born 15 January 1962) is a Scottish politician who served as the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament from 2016 to 2021. Elected as a member of Scottish Labour, he suspended his party membership on becoming Presiding Officer. Macintosh was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) from 1999 to 2021, representing the Eastwood constituency from 1999 to 2016, and then the West Scotland region from 2016 to 2021.

Born in Inverness, Macintosh was employed between 1987 and 1999 as a television producer for the BBC, working on its news broadcasts and election coverage. He was first elected in the 1999 Scottish Parliament election as a Scottish Labour and Co-operative Party candidate, and retained his seat of Eastwood in the 2003, 2007 and the 2011 elections, but lost it in the 2016 election. In that election, he was returned on the regional list.

==Early life==

=== Family background and education ===
Kenneth Donald Macintosh was born on 15 January 1962 in Inverness. Macintosh was educated at the Portree and Oban primary schools before attending the state comprehensive Royal High School, Edinburgh. Both his parents were headteachers. His father, Dr Farquhar Macintosh CBE, was a Gaelic speaker from the Isle of Skye, a leading intellectual in Scottish education, rector of Royal High School and chair of the Scottish Examination Board. His mother, Margaret Macintosh, came from Peebles and was head of Drummond Community High and assistant head of Wester Hailes Education Centre.

=== Early career ===
After graduating from the University of Edinburgh with a History MA (Hons) in 1984, Macintosh became a television producer in 1987 for the BBC News Network. He also worked on &quot;Breakfast with Frost&quot;, &quot;Breakfast News&quot;, and the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;. In addition, he also worked as a researcher on election programmes for both David Dimbleby and Jonathan Dimbleby.

==Political career==

=== Early parliamentary career ===

At the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, Macintosh won the Eastwood constituency with a majority of 2,125 votes.

In February 2002, Macintosh was appointed as a ministerial parliamentary aide to Minister for Education and Young People, Cathy Jamieson. He resigned from this role in September 2002 when he voted against the Labour–Liberal Democrat Coalition Scottish Executive over the closure of the A&amp;E department at the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary.

Macintosh became Deputy Convenor on the Standards Committee but had to resign from this position in 2005 after it was revealed he had failed to declare £330 of hospitality from McDonald&#x27;s within the required time.

In 2006 and 2007 Macintosh has proposed a Member&#x27;s Bill to the Scottish Parliament providing for the tougher regulation of sunbed parlours, which passed successfully. Since his election in 1999 has been a member of the cross-party group on cancer. From February 2007 to April 2007, he was a ministerial parliamentary aide to First Minister Jack McConnell.

Macintosh was re-elected as MSP for Eastwood at the 2007 election with a narrow majority of 913, where he fought off a strong challenge from the Conservative Party&#x27;s Jackson Carlaw. After the election, Macintosh was appointed Shadow Minister for Schools and Skills. He considered running for the 2008 Scottish Labour leadership election but pulled out and instead backed Andy Kerr&#x27;s candidacy.

At the 2011 parliamentary election he once again defeated Jackson Carlaw with an increased majority of 2,012. The swing was 8.7% from Conservative to Labour. Macintosh had feared losing the constituency following boundary changes (with the removal of Barrhead, Neilston and Uplawmoor) which gave a notional Conservative majority of almost 3,500. After the party&#x27;s loss to the SNP, Macintosh was made Shadow Culture and External Affairs Secretary. Only a week later, however, he took over the Shadow Education portfolio after MSP Malcolm Chisholm resigned over an internal party disagreement.

=== 2011 and 2015 Scottish Labour Party leadership elections ===
Macintosh announced his candidacy in 2011 Scottish Labour leadership election. During a September 2011 BBC Scotland TV interview, Labour leader Ed Miliband was unable to recall Macintosh&#x27;s name. After the interview, Miliband telephoned to apologise for his mistake and Macintosh tried to downplay the incident saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think anyone should read anything into it – half the time I can&#x27;t even remember the names of my own kids.&quot; Macintosh officially launched his campaign at Cumbernauld College on 28 October. He described the 2011 election result as a &quot;disaster&quot; and said the party had been too negative: &quot;We need to unite as a party and to start talking positively about our values, what Labour stands for and not just what we are against.&quot; He later also said he was a devolutionist, not a unionist. Despite lacking ministerial experience, he was widely seen as a frontrunner. Colleagues who endorsed his bid included his campaign manager Michael McMahon, Claire Baker, Mary Fee, Neil Bibby, Mark Griffin, Kezia Dugdale, Jenny Marra and East Renfrewshire MP Jim Murphy, with whom Macintosh shared his constituency office in Clarkston, East Renfrewshire. In the ensuing leadership election, Macintosh came second to MSP Johann Lamont.

Following Scottish Labour&#x27;s near wipeout at the 2015 general election, Macintosh decided to stand again for the Scottish Labour leadership, triggered by the resignation of Jim Murphy. Macintosh faced a straight two-way contest with previous deputy leader Kezia Dugdale, who won the leadership.

=== Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament ===
At the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Macintosh lost the Eastwood constituency, being pushed into third place behind the Conservatives&#x27; Jackson Carlaw and the Scottish National Party&#x27;s Stewart Maxwell. However, Macintosh was returned as an additional member on Scottish Labour&#x27;s West Scotland regional list.

On 12 May 2016, Macintosh was elected as Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament with 71 votes on the third round of voting by MSPs. He defeated Murdo Fraser, Johann Lamont, John Scott and Elaine Smith. He suspended his Scottish Labour Co-operative membership upon taking office, per the tradition of the presiding officer being strictly non-partisan.

In early November 2018, Macintosh created controversy when an MSP was sent out of the Holyrood chamber for wearing a rainbow tie in support of LGBTI rights and liberation. Alex Cole-Hamilton, Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP for Edinburgh Western, was told to change the garment by Macintosh during a debate on LGBTI-inclusive education in schools. Macintosh said it flouted rules against &quot;ostentatious campaign material&quot; in the chamber.

In September 2020, Macintosh announced that he would not stand for re-election at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. In a letter to his constituents, he said: &quot;After much reflection, I have decided not to seek re-election to the Scottish Parliament in May next year. It has been an honour to represent the people of East Renfrewshire and the West of Scotland for the last two decades and I would thank you for the trust you have placed in me.&quot;

==Personal life==
Macintosh and his wife Claire live in Busby, East Renfrewshire with their six children.

<text>Stateside Records, styled as $tateside Records, is a British record label, owned by Warner Music Group and operates through its Parlophone and Warner Records imprints. Upon creation, it initially released licensed American recordings and is now a reissue label.

==History==
It was formed in 1962 by EMI as a replacement for the Top Rank label (originally the Rank Organisation&#x27;s label), which had folded. EMI hired former Top Rank label head Fred Oxon to run it and compete with Decca&#x27;s London &quot;American Recordings&quot;, and Pye&#x27;s &quot;Pye International&quot; labels.

While Top Rank&#x27;s British acts (such as John Leyton) were assigned to EMI&#x27;s Columbia and His Master&#x27;s Voice labels, Stateside continued to issue records from its American suppliers, including Amy, Bell, 20th Century Fox, Scepter, Vee-Jay and A&amp;M, and acquired Tamla-Motown-Gordy from Oriole Records.

Its first hit was &quot;Palisades Park&quot; by Freddy Cannon, which was licensed from Swan Records. It was through EMI&#x27;s relationship with Vee-Jay and Swan that pre-1964 recordings by the Beatles were released by those labels in the U.S. when EMI&#x27;s American subsidiary Capitol turned them down.

Stateside&#x27;s black label design, with a large &#x27;45&#x27; for singles and a coloured logo for albums, was the model for the new-look Columbia, Parlophone and His Master&#x27;s Voice labels which were introduced the following year. In the late 1960s, when EMI set up long term licence contracts with US labels like Motown, Bell and Dot, it no longer needed Stateside, and the label was retired quietly in 1973, along with EMI&#x27;s Columbia, His Master&#x27;s Voice, Regal Zonophone and Parlophone labels, in favour of the new EMI and EMI America labels. Stateside has retrospectively attracted interest from northern soul fans, mainly for its role in releasing American Motown recordings in the UK market. Stateside issued 45 of them, including the number 1 &quot;Baby Love&quot; in 1964, prior to the establishment of the UK Tamla Motown label.

In the 1980s, the Stateside label was revived as a catalogue reissue label, specialising in American recordings from Capitol Records and other labels EMI acquired over the years. The trademark is now owned by Parlophone Records Limited, as a consequence of the EU-mandated divestiture of some EMI Records assets to Warner Music Group. That forced the deletion of titles to which Capitol Records, now owned by Universal Music Group, had the rights. In the summer of 2017, Warner Music relaunched the Stateside label for classic jazz, soul and R&amp;B releases.

<doc id="1045365" wikidata="Q3364290" url="?curid=1045365" title="Cordell Mosson">
<text>Cordell &quot;Boogie&quot; Mosson (born Cardell Mosson; October 16, 1952 – April 18, 2013) was an American bassist who was a member of Parliament-Funkadelic. He was given a Lifetime Achievement Award Grammy in 2019.

Mosson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, but grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey.

==Biography==
A good friend of Garry Shider, the two left Plainfield, New Jersey in their teens for Canada. They joined a band called United Soul, which came to the attention of George Clinton, who had known Shider as a youth in Plainfield. In 1971 Clinton produced several tracks by United Soul with input from members of Funkadelic. The songs &quot;I Miss My Baby&quot; and &quot;Baby I Owe You Something Good&quot; were released as a one-off single by Westbound Records in 1971 under the group name U.S. Music with Funkadelic. All the tracks recorded with Clinton in 1971 were released by Westbound in 2009 as the album &quot;U.S. Music With Funkadelic&quot;. After producing United Soul, Clinton then invited Mosson and Shider to join Parliament-Funkadelic. Two United Soul songs were rerecorded on later Funkadelic albums with Mosson as a member.

Mosson was a prominent contributor to albums by both Funkadelic and Parliament from 1972 until the dissolution of the two groups in the early 1980s, and was the featured on-stage bassist for Parliament-Funkadelic after Bootsy Collins went solo. While Collins is more widely remembered as the P-Funk bassist, Mosson&#x27;s contributions were arguably more numerous and are well regarded by fans. Mosson also appeared in the movie &quot;PCU&quot; as himself, in 1994.

His name as spelled on his birth certificate is Cardell Mosson, and &quot;Cordell&quot; is his son&#x27;s name, a common spelling in the notes for most of the Parliament-Funkadelic albums on which he appeared. Mosson is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. He was also honored by the Recording Academy with a Lifetime Achievement Award Grammy in 2019. His children and long time partner received the award on his behalf.

Mosson died of liver failure on April 18, 2013.

<doc id="1045380" wikidata="Q206350" url="?curid=1045380" title="Zambia national football team">
<text>The Zambia national football team represents Zambia in association football and is governed by the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ). During the 1980s, they were known as the KK 11, after founding president Dr. Kenneth Kaunda (&quot;KK&quot;) who ruled Zambia from 1964 to 1991. After the country adopted multiparty politics, the side was nicknamed &quot;Chipolopolo&quot; which means the &quot;Copper Bullets&quot;. The team won an Africa Cup of Nations title in 2012. This team has also become the most successful team in the COSAFA Cup, surpassing Zimbabwe after winning the 2023 edition.

==History==
===Zambian Air Force Flight 319===
Tragedy struck the Zambian team when the military plane (REG: AF-319) transporting the team to Senegal for a 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier crashed late in the evening, on April 27, 1993. Three stops were planned for re-fuelling, but at the first stop, in Brazzaville, engine problems were noted on the Buffalo DHC-5D of the Zambia Air Force. Despite this, the flight continued, and a few minutes after take-off from Libreville, Gabon, where the second stopover had taken place, one of the engines caught fire and stopped. The pilot, who had already made a flight from Mauritius the day before, accidentally shut down the other engine, which was still running. The loss of power, during the climb after take-off, caused the plane to fall and crash into the water 500m off the coast. All 30 passengers and crew, including 18 players, were killed in the accident.

===1994–2012===
On June 3, 1994, in Brussels, the Zambian football team succumbed to one of the worst losses in its history against Belgium, losing 9–0. At CAN 1996, they finished first in the group with two victories (5–1 against Burkina Faso, goals from Kenneth Malitoli, double from Kalusha Bwalya, goals from Dennis Lota and Johnson Bwalya); 4–0 against Sierra Leone (a hattrick from Kalusha Bwalya and goal from Mordon Malitoli) and a draw (0–0 against Algeria), beat Egypt (3–1) in the quarterfinals and loses in semis against Tunisia (2–4) but took third place over Ghana (1–0, goal from Johnson Bwalya). Kalusha Bwalya was the best in the competition with 5 goals. From 1998 to 2006, Zambia did not pass the first round, except in 2004 when they failed to qualify. On September 3, 2006, at home, Zambia achieved the biggest victory in its history against Djibouti, winning 10–0. During the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations, Zambia finished third in the group with a 3–0 victory against Sudan (goals by James Chamanga, Jacob Mulenga and Felix Katongo), a draw (1–1 against Egypt, goal from Chris Katongo) and loss (1–5 against Cameroon, goal from Chris Katongo). In 2010, Zambia finished first in her group and faced Nigeria in the quarter-finals where she lost on penalties. Jacob Mulenga and Emmanuel Mbola were included in the tournament&#x27;s Best XI.
In 2012, the best AFCON in Zambia history happened. During the tournament&#x27;s group stage, they defeated Senegal(2–1), drew with Libya (2-2), and defeated Equatorial Guinea (1–0), and qualified top of their group. During the knockout stage, Zambia defeated Sudan (3–0) in the Quarterfinals, beat Ghana in the semifinals (1–0) and went up against Ivory Coast in the final, where they won their first title, after defeating them in a dramatic Penalty shootout after a 0–0 draw after extra time.

<text>50 Number Ones is the sixth compilation album by American country music singer George Strait, released on October 5, 2004. It is a 2-CD compilation of his first 50 number-one country music singles, starting with 1982&#x27;s &quot;Fool Hearted Memory&quot; and presented in chronological order. A new track, &quot;I Hate Everything&quot;, was also included and became his 51st overall number one in 2004. The figure of &quot;50 Number Ones&quot; includes not just songs that reached the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart but also those that topped the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; and &quot;Gavin Report&quot; charts.

Some of the songs have been edited for red-book standard purposes to fit all the songs on the discs. It had a companion album called &quot;22 More Hits&quot; released in 2007 that featured Strait&#x27;s hits and fan-favorites that otherwise did not reach number-one any trade charts.

==Commercial performance==
The album was certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA on December 13, 2007 for 3.5 million copies shipped. It has sold 3,791,500 copies in the US as of April 2015, and 5,531,000 units including tracks and streams as of January 2020.

<text>Jean-François Lamour (born 2 February 1956 in Paris) is a French former fencer and current politician and cabinet minister. During his fencing career, Lamour achieved various athletic accomplishments, notably qualifying for the 1987 world championship. He earned two gold medals, two silver medals, and one bronze medal in sabre Olympic events between 1984 and 1988.

After retiring from fencing, Lamour entered politics and served as the sports and youth counselor to the Mayor of Paris from 1993 to 1995. In 2002, he assumed the position of minister of sport, and later in 2004, he took on additional responsibilities for youth.

Lamour is married to Dr. Isabelle Spennato, a former French fencer who currently holds the position of president of the French Fencing Federation.

==Athletic career==
Lamour began his fencing journey at the age of eight and attained his first notable win in 1971 at the French junior championship in Sabre fencing when he reached the age of 15.

Four years subsequent to that achievement, in 1975, Lamour advanced to the semifinals during the World Championship, which took place in Bucharest. Over the next few years, he broke the national record by winning the Champion of France title 13 times between 1977 and 1992.

During this time, he won a silver medal in the individual Sabre event at the 1983 Mediterranean Games. In the next year he achieved the gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. And later on in 1987, he became the World Champion in Lausanne. In 1988, Lamour received the prestigious Master of Saber prize. A few months later, he won a second gold medal in Seoul.

Under the guidance of his new coach, László Szepesi, who hails from Hungary, Lamour underwent further training as a part of the French national team. In 2002, Lamour took on the role of France&#x27;s Minister of Sports.

<text>St Luke&#x27;s Church, more commonly known by locals as the bombed-out church, is a former Anglican parish church in Liverpool, England. It stands on the corner of Berry Street and Leece Street, at the top of Bold Street.

The church was built between 1811 and 1832, and was designed by John Foster, Sr. and John Foster, Jr., father and son who were successive surveyors for the municipal Corporation of Liverpool. In addition to being a parish church, it was also intended to be used as a venue for ceremonial worship by the corporation and as a concert hall.

The church was badly damaged by bombs during the Liverpool Blitz in 1941 and has been a roofless shell ever since, giving rise to its nickname. It now stands as a memorial to those who died in the war, and has also been hired as a venue for exhibitions and events. The church and its surrounding walls, gates, and railings are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II* listed buildings.

==History==

The site for the church was given by Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby in 1791 on the condition that the land should never be used for any other purpose than that of a church. Plans for the design of the church were first drawn up in 1802 by John Foster, senior, the surveyor of the Corporation of Liverpool, but the foundation stone was not laid until 9 April 1811. Building work, supervised by Foster, progressed slowly, and during this time the plans were amended to make the building suitable both as a ceremonial place of worship for members of the corporation, and also for use as a concert hall. In 1822 it was decided to add a chancel to the church. Foster&#x27;s son, also named John, took over the role of Corporation surveyor and continued to supervise the building, making further changes to the design in 1827. The building was finally completed in 1832. The church was known as &quot;the doctor&#x27;s church&quot; because of its location close to Rodney Street, the home of many doctors. It continued to be used as a concert hall as well as a church until the Philharmonic Hall in Hope Street opened in 1849. Between 1864 and 1873, minor alterations were made to the church by W. &amp; G. Audsley.

On 6 May 1941, during Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;May Blitz&quot;, the church was hit by an incendiary device that caused a large fire, leaving only the burnt-out shell of the former church. It has since been nicknamed &quot;the bombed-out church&quot;. It has been decided to maintain the church as it is, a burnt-out shell, as a memorial to those who died as a result of the war. The church was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 28 June 1952. This is the middle of the three grades, which is defined by English Heritage as containing &quot;particularly important buildings of more than special interest&quot;.

=== Present day ===
From 2007 to 2014, Urban Strawberry Lunch organised the day-to-day maintenance of St Lukes and coordinated exhibitions and events inside the grounds. In addition to this, they arranged showings of films, and many dance, poetry, and drama performances.

In 2014, Ambrose Reynolds, former artistic director for Urban Strawberry Lunch, joined other members of the community to create a new organisation, &#x27;Bombed Out Church&#x27;; named after the building&#x27;s colloquial name. They have since continued the work started by USL, maintaining the church as a creative hub for the local community.

Since 1981, the bombed out church has been commemorated in the name of the local Church of England parish: , the St Luke-in-the-City team parish consists of St Bride&#x27;s Church, Liverpool; the Church of St Dunstan, Liverpool; St Michael-in-the-City; and OpenTable, an LGBTQIA+ fresh expression.

==Architecture==

===Lost features===
Originally there were two aisles, and the nave had a groined ceiling, which was &quot;richly ornamented&quot;. The whole roof and the arcades separating the aisles from the nave were lost as a result of the bomb damage. The roof of the tower has also been lost. Many of the windows contained stained glass, but now only fragments of glass remain. There was a ring of eight bells, cast in 1818 by William Dobson of Downham Market at a cost of £645 (). As a result of the fire in 1941, five of the bells fell from the tower and the other three were badly cracked. The clock, made by Roskell&#x27;s of Derby, also fell to the ground. The three-manual pipe organ was also destroyed in the fire. It had been made by Gray and Davison in 1865, and improvements had been made to it by Rushworth and Dreaper in 1902.

===Remaining structure===

St Luke&#x27;s is constructed in ashlar sandstone, and is in Perpendicular style. Its plan currently consists of a five-bay nave, a four-bay chancel with an apsidal end, and a west tower. There are porches in the angles between the tower and the nave, and between the nave and the chancel. The tower is in three stages, with polygonal buttresses at the corners. The bottom stage of the tower contains a west entrance. In the middle stage, on all sides, are three-light windows, a traceried frieze, and a clock face. In the top stage are four-light windows under ogival hood moulds. At the summit of the tower is a battlemented parapet, with flat-headed pinnacles at the corners. Within the tower is the surviving cast iron bell frame, made in 1828 by George Gilliband. This is considered to be the first metal bell frame to be made in the world. Along the sides of the nave are five three-light windows, separated by panelled buttresses that rise to crocketed pinnacles. The windows at the sides of the chancel also have three lights, and the east window has five lights. The chancel buttresses rise to octagonal finials with flat tops. Inside the church is a surviving brick chancel arch. Under the church is a crypt, which is not accessible to the general public. One of its windows has retained stained glass that depicts a liver bird.

==External features==

The area around the church has never been used for burials, and was laid out as a garden in 1885. Originally it was enclosed by a solid wall, with doorways under pointed arches. This was replaced between 1829 and 1832 by John Foster, junior, by the current enclosure. This consists of cast iron railings on sandstone plinth walls, and cast iron gates between sandstone piers. Steps lead down on all sides to the surrounding streets. The gate piers are panelled, and have crocketed heads. The whole structure was designated as a Grade II* listed building on 14 March 1975. In the churchyard is the Irish Famine Memorial, sculpted by Éamonn O&#x27;Docherty, which has been erected to commemorate those who died as a result of the Irish Famine in the middle of the 19th century. It was opened by the President of Ireland in 1998, and carries inscriptions in Gaelic and in English.
There is also a Christmas truce sculpture (2014), known as &quot;All Together Now&quot; by Andy Edwards in the garden, depicting a British and German soldier commencing a football game at Christmas 1914.

<doc id="1045416" wikidata="Q1151260" url="?curid=1045416" title="D-beat">
<text>D-beat (also known as Discore, kängpunk, Discrust, and crust-beat) is a style of hardcore punk, developed in the early 1980s by imitators of Discharge, after whom the genre is named, as well as a drum beat characteristic of this subgenre. D-beat is known for its &quot;grinding, distorted and brutally political&quot; sound. Discharge may have themselves inherited the beat from Motörhead and the Buzzcocks. D-beat is closely associated with crust punk, which is a heavier, more complex variation. The style was particularly popular in Sweden, and developed there by groups such as Crude SS, Anti Cimex, Mob 47, and Driller Killer. Other D-beat groups include Doom and the Varukers from the UK; Disclose from Japan; Crucifix and Final Conflict from the U.S.; Ratos de Porão from Brazil; and MG15 from Spain. While the style initially developed in the early 1980s, a number of new groups working within the subgenre emerged in the mid-1990s. These include the Swedish groups Wolfbrigade, Totalitär, Avskum, Skitsystem, and Disfear.

==History==

===Origins===
One of the earliest examples of D-beat can be found in the Buzzcocks&#x27; song &quot;You Tear Me Up,&quot; on their debut LP, &quot;Another Music In A Different Kitchen&quot;. It featured a fast, intense drumbeat which Discharge would later emulate in the distinctive drumbeat of D-beat. Discharge formed in 1977 in Stoke-on-Trent, England, initially playing a basic variety of street punk inspired by the Sex Pistols and The Clash. In 1979, the group changed its line-up and began to develop a new, more aggressive style. At this time Terry &quot;Tez&quot; Roberts of Discharge developed their characteristic drum beat, for which the D-beat subgenre is named. Roberts commented in 2004 that &quot;I just wanna be remembered for coming up with that f-ckin&#x27; D-beat in the first place! And inspiring all those f-ckin&#x27; great Discore bands around the world!&quot; Discharge&#x27;s inspiration for the style has led it to be referred to as &quot;Discore&quot;. Roberts&#x27; beat is similar to the basic percussive backbone of songs by Motörhead, and many subsequent groups borrow from this group a great deal as well as Discharge. After 1982, the group changed its style to a more conventional form of heavy metal. However, their classic sound inspired other groups to emulate them; The Varukers, also from England, were the first of these. As punk historian Ian Glasper put it, &quot;The Varukers were the original Discore band, the first and best of the hardcore punk acts to take the simple, yet devastatingly effective formula laid down by Discharge and play it as fast, hard, heavy as they could.&quot; and that &quot;In the turbulent wake of Discharge, a hundred Discore – or D-beat – punk bands sprang up around the world.&quot; While the style was first practiced in England, it became especially inspirational to a number of groups in Sweden.

D-beat was initially known as &quot;kängpunk&quot; (&quot;boot punk&quot;) in Sweden. The first Swedish D-beat song is &quot;Marquee,&quot; by Rude Kids, from Stockholm, recorded in 1979. They were followed by KSMB (En Slemmig Torsk), Missbrukarna, and more famously, Anti Cimex. Anti Cimex&#x27;s second 7-inch EP, &quot;Raped Ass&quot;, has been described as &quot;one of the rawest and most violent hardcore releases ever.&quot; Other such groups included Moderat Likvidation, Asocial, and most prominently Mob 47. Mob 47, also from Stockholm, was known as the fastest of the &quot;kängpunk&quot; groups. The group also blended Discharge&#x27;s style with American hardcore punk, diversifying the style. The heaviest of Swedish crust bands was Crude SS

===1980s===

In England, a second style of anarcho-punk similar to D-beat developed in the mid-1980s. This style borrowed from the Swedish &quot;kängpunk&quot; groups as well as British anarcho-punk, heavy metal, and post-punk. The term &quot;crust&quot; was coined by Hellbastard on their 1986 &quot;Ripper Crust&quot; demo. As punk historian Ian Glasper puts it: &quot;&quot;Rippercrust&quot; is widely regarded as the first time the word &#x27;crust&#x27; was used in the punk context, and hence the specific starting point of the whole crustcore genre, although some would attribute that accolade to the likes of Disorder, Chaos UK, and Amebix several years earlier.&quot; Malcolm &quot;Scruff&quot; Lewty, vocalist and guitarist of Hellbastard, commented, &quot;A lot of people say we started the crust-punk genre, but whatever. If they wanna say that, I don&#x27;t mind, but I&#x27;m certainly no Malcolm McLaren, saying I invented something I didn&#x27;t.&quot; Amebix and Antisect are often located as the originators of crust punk.

Amebix&#x27;s &quot;Arise&quot; LP and Antisect&#x27;s &quot;Out from the Void&quot; single, both released in 1985, offer a template for the subgenre. In the late 1980s, Doom, from Birmingham, practiced D-beat indebted to Discharge as well as to crust punk. Punk journalist Felix von Havoc contends that Doom, Excrement of War, Electro Hippies and Extreme Noise Terror were among the first bands to have the traditional UK &quot;crust&quot; sound. Additional subgenres of this style began to develop. Deviated Instinct, from Norwich, created &quot;stenchcore&quot;, bringing &quot;both the look and sound – dirty and metallic, respectively – to their natural conclusion&quot;. Initially an anarcho-punk group, they began to take increasing influence from metal. As vocalist Julian &quot;Leggo&quot; Kilsby comments: &quot;We were very much a part of the anarcho scene, to start with, very politically motivated... all the way through the band&#x27;s existence, really, although it got less obvious as time went by. But I never really liked the straightforward &#x27;War is bad...&#x27; lyrics that were so prevalent at the time, so as my writing skills improved I wanted to add more depth to our lyrics and make them more metaphorical; I&#x27;d always been into horror films, so that started to manifest itself in the imagery I was using...&quot;

Crust punk groups took some influence from the early black metal of Venom and Celtic Frost. Similarly, Bathory was initially inspired by crust punk as well as metal. Crust was affected by a second wave of influence in the 1990s, with some bands emphasizing these black metal elements. Iskra are probably the most obvious example of second wave black metal-influenced crust punk; Iskra coined their own phrase &quot;blackened crust&quot; to describe this new style. The Japanese group Gallhammer also blend crust with black metal. In addition, Norwegian band Darkthrone have incorporated crust punk traits in their more recent material. As Daniel Ekeroth wrote in 2008 :&quot;In a very ironic paradox, black metal and crust punk have recently started to embrace one another. Members of Darkthrone and Satyricon have lately claimed that they love punk, while among crusties, black metal is the latest fashion. In fact, the latest album by crust punk band Skitsystem sounds very black metal—while the latest black metal opus by Darkthrone sounds very punk! This would have been unimaginable in the early 90s.&quot;

American crust punk began in New York City, also in the mid-&#x27;80s, with the work of Nausea. The group emerged from the Lower East Side squat scene and New York hardcore, living with Roger Miret of Agnostic Front. The early work of Neurosis, from Oakland, CA, also borrowed from Amebix, and inaugurated crust punk on the West Coast. Disrupt (Boston), Antischism (South Carolina), and Destroy! (Minneapolis) were also significant U.S. crust groups.

Extreme Noise Terror is credited with developing this style into grindcore. However, Pete Hurley, the guitarist for the group, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: &quot;&#x27;grindcore&#x27; was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and it had nothing to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and – I suspect – always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with.&quot;

===1990s===
An important American crust punk band was Aus-Rotten from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Crust punk also flourished in Minneapolis, shepherded by the Profane Existence label. In this period, the ethos of crust punk became particularly codified, with vegetarianism, feminism, and sometimes straight edge being prescribed by many of the figures in the scene. The powerviolence scene associated with Slap-a-Ham Records was in close proximity to crust punk, particularly in the case of Man Is the Bastard and Dropdead. Crust was also prominent in the American South, where Prank Records and CrimethInc. acted as focal points of the scene. The most well-known representative of Southern crust was His Hero Is Gone.
Many Swedish groups of the 1990s began to play a combination of D-beat with crust punk. These bands, including Driller Killer, Totalitär, Skitsystem, Wolfbrigade, and Disfear, remain some of the most well-known D-beat bands, although their sound has cleaved closely to developments in death metal.

==Characteristics==
=== Vocals and lyrics ===
The vocal content of D-beat tends towards shouted slogans. The style is distinguished from its predecessors by its minimal lyrical content and greater proximity to heavy metal. D-beat bands typically have anti-war, anarchist messages and closely follow the bleak nuclear war imagery of 1980s anarcho-punk bands. Rock journalist Robbie Mackey described D-beat as characterized by &quot;hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight.&quot;

Vocals in crust punk are often shrieked or shouted, and may be shared between two or more vocalists. The lyrical content of crust punk tends to be bleak and nihilistic, yet politically engaged. Crust punk songs are often about nuclear war, militarism, animal rights, police, personal grievances, oppressive states and fascism. Amebix were also interested in various forms of mysticism and Gnosticism. Malcolm &quot;Scruff&quot; Lewty, guitarist and vocalist of Hellbastard, describes the distinction between metal and crust punk lyrics:

===Drum beat===

The name &quot;D-beat&quot; refers to a specific drumbeat, associated with The Varukers, Brian Roe (Brains), Discharge, Garry Malloney &amp; Tez Roberts, Discharge&#x27;s first drummer, though rock musicians such as Buzzcocks and Diamond Head had used the beat previously. The term was coined by Rich Militia, the singer of Sore Throat, in 1988, to describe the drum pattern played by Dave &quot;Bambi&quot; Ellesmere, Roberts&#x27;s replacement, on Discharge&#x27;s EP &quot;Why&quot;.

Three versions of D-beat drum tabs:

First () (like early Anti Cimex and Discharge):
 C:|x--x-x--x--x-x--:||
 S:|--o---o---o---o-:||
 K:|o--o-o--o--o-o--:||

<text>Riversleigh World Heritage Area is Australia&#x27;s most famous fossil location, recognised for the series of well preserved fossils deposited from the Late Oligocene to more recent geological periods. The fossiliferous limestone system is located near the Gregory River in the north-west of Queensland, an environment that was once a very wet rainforest that became more arid as the Gondwanan land masses separated and the Australian continent moved north. The approximately area has fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds, and reptiles of the Oligocene and Miocene ages, many of which were discovered and are only known from the Riversleigh area; the species that have occurred there are known as the Riversleigh fauna.

The fossils at Riversleigh are unusual because they are found in soft freshwater limestone which has not been compacted. This means the animal remains retain their three-dimensional structure, rather than being partially crushed like in most fossil sites. The area is located within the catchment of the Gregory River.
Many of the fossil sites were crevices and limestone caves created by the action of large amounts of water on the karst formation, creating pitfall traps and feeding spots for predators which periodically and perhaps suddenly became covered and preserved; these conditions are responsible for the large assemblages of fossilised bats whose guano helped to conserve the remains of themselves and others.
Fossils were first noted to exist in the area in 1901. An initial exploration survey was conducted in 1963. Since 1976, the area has been the subject of systemic exploration. The site was co-listed with the Naracoorte Caves National Park in South Australia as a World Heritage Site in 1994, and by itself, it is an extension of the Boodjamulla National Park.

== Description ==
Fossils at Riversleigh are found in limestone by lime-rich freshwater pools, and in caves, when the ecosystem was evolving from rich rainforest to semiarid grassland community. Some of the fossils at Riversleigh are 25 million years old. High concentrations of calcium carbonate have meant the fossils are extremely well preserved. The fossil collection reveals mammalian evolution across more than 20 million years. Fossils have been found in more than 200 individual locations. The fossil record here is significant because it provides evidence on evolution and the distribution of species across Gondwana.

The presence of Riversleigh fauna in the Oligo-Miocene has been classified by four &quot;faunal zones&quot;, and used to denote the presence of fossil taxa in these time periods. These may be summarised as
* Faunal Zone A (FZA): Late or Upper Oligocene, 28.4 to 23.03 million years ago
* Faunal Zone B (FZB): Early or Lower Miocene, 23.03 to 15.97 Ma
* Faunal Zone C (FZC): Middle Miocene, 15.97 to 11.608 Ma
* Faunal Zone D (FZD): Late or Upper Miocene, 11.608 to 5.332 Ma

Thirty-five fossil bat species have been identified at the site, which is the richest in the world. Cave deposits have been particularly rich in bat species.

The skull and nearly complete dentition of a 15-million-year-old monotreme, &quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot;, provide a window into the evolution of this characteristically Australian group. Fossil ancestors of the recently extinct thylacine, &quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;, have also been identified among Riversleigh&#x27;s fauna. In 1993, skulls of the koala-like &quot;Nimbadon&quot; were unearthed in a previously unknown cave in the region. Researchers estimate that this marsupial first appeared about 15 million years ago and died out about 12 million years ago, perhaps from climate change-induced losses in habitat. A well-preserved skull of the ancient &quot;Nimbacinus dicksoni&quot;, an extinct relative of the thylacine, has been used to determine the hunting behavior of the species.

Other fossils have provided evidence of how the koala has evolved in response to Australia&#x27;s change from predominant rainforest vegetation to drier eucalypt forests. The fossil bird fauna at Riversleigh includes an artamid &quot;Kurrartapu johnnguyeni&quot;, a fossil sittella, and representatives of various other families of modern birds. Some fossil insects and plants have also been discovered.

The fossil species identified at the sites are collectively known as the Riversleigh fauna.

== Research ==
Scientific studies are mostly conducted by a group of palaeontologists from the University of New South Wales. Mike Archer is a paleontologist who has been working at Riversleigh since 1983. He and his co-workers discovered that diluted acetic acid was the most effective method of extracting fossils. Karen Black, a palaeontologist from UNSW, discovered a new species of extinct koala, at Riversleigh, which was then named after Dick Smith.

<text>Anastasius Bibliothecarius (c. 810 – c. 878) was the librarian (&quot;bibliothecarius&quot;) and chief archivist of the Church of Rome and also briefly a claimant to the Papacy.

==Early life==
He was a nephew of Bishop Arsenius of Orte, who executed important commissions as Papal legate. Anastasius learned the Greek language from Eastern Roman monks and obtained an unusual education for his era, such that he appears to be the most learned ecclesiastic of Rome in the 9th century.

== Abbot of Santa Maria and secretary of Nicholas I ==
During the pontificate of Pope Nicholas I (858–867) Anastasius was abbot of Santa Maria in Trastevere on the farther side of the Tiber. He was employed by the pope in various matters. He was also active as an author, and translated Greek language works into Latin. Among them was the biography of St. John the Merciful, which he dedicated to Nicholas I. He has been shown by Ernst Perels to be the &#x27;ghost-writer&#x27; behind much papal official correspondence of these years.

The successor of Nicholas, Pope Adrian II (867–872), appointed Anastasius &quot;bibliothecarius&quot; (Head of archives) of the Roman Church, an important office at the Lateran Palace that gave him further influence at the papal court.

== Envoy to Constantinople ==
In 869 he was sent by Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor as envoy to Constantinople, with two men of high rank in the Frankish Empire, to negotiate a marriage between Leo VI the Wise, oldest son of the Eastern Roman emperor Basil I, and Louis&#x27;s only child, Ermengard.

When the envoys arrived at Constantinople, the Fourth Council of Constantinople was still in session, and Anastasius, who attended the last session (February, 870), zealously defended the papal cause and was of much service to the papal legates.

On their way home the papal legates were robbed, and the &quot;Acts&quot; of the council were carried off. However, they had given most of the declarations of obedience of the Greek bishops to Anastasius, who also had a copy of the &quot;Acts&quot;, and was thus able to bring these documents to the pope. At the pope&#x27;s order, he translated the &quot;Acts&quot; into Latin. The Greek originals are lost.

== Continued influence ==
The successor of Adrian II, Pope John VIII (872–882), also esteemed Anastasius, confirmed him in the office of librarian, entrusted important affairs to him, and encouraged him to further literary work.

Anastasius was in correspondence with the deposed Byzantine patriarch, Photius, and sought to mediate between the patriarch and the pope and also to assuage the controversy over the Holy Ghost by assuming that the Latins understood the &quot;processio&quot; (procession) of the Holy Ghost from the Son in the sense of &quot;missio&quot; (transmission).

Recent scholarship has surmised that Anastasius&#x27; role in disseminating the claims of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals and through muscular correspondence East and West that he was &quot;the architect and promoter of the papal claims.&quot;

== Presumed identification with antipope Anastasius ==
If a passage in the annals of Hincmar of Reims is genuine and Hincmar has not confused two men, then the &quot;bibliothecarius&quot; Anastasius is identical with the Roman presbyter Anastasius who in 874 became titular priest of St. Marcellus. This Anastasius had fled from Rome in 848, to reside in various cities. As a result of his flight he was excommunicated by a Roman synod in 850, and, as he did not return, was anathematized and deposed by another synod in 853.

After the death of Pope Leo IV in 855 this Anastasius was elected as Antipope by the imperial party, but the rightfully elected Pope Benedict III gained the supremacy, and acted kindly towards the usurper.

During the pontificate of Pope Adrian II, Anastasius became involved in serious difficulties when, in 868, his brother Eleutherius forcibly carried off the daughter of the Pope and soon afterwards killed her and her mother Stephania. Eleutherius was executed and Anastasius, who was regarded as the instigator of the murder, was punished by excommunication and deposition. He lived at the Imperial court and sought by the intervention of the Emperor to exculpate himself before the Pope. Joseph Hergenröther maintains that the &quot;bibliothecarius&quot; and the presbyter Anastasius (the antipope) were one and the same person, and weaves all the statements concerning the latter into the biography of Anastasius, while Joseph Langen considers them different persons. In August, 879, Zacharias of Anagni appears as Head of archives of the Roman Church, so Anastasius must have died shortly before this date.

== Translator and author ==
Anastasius translated from Greek into Latin the &quot;Acts&quot; of both the Second Council of Nicaea and the Fourth Council of Constantinople, as well as several hagiographies of saints, along with other writings. Knowledge of Greek was so unusual that only he could revise his translations. The attribution to Anastasius of the ancient Latin translation of the Acts of the Third Council of Constantinople has been proved to be wrong on manuscript evidence by Rudolph Riedinger.

He also compiled a historical work, &quot;Chronographia tripartita&quot;, from the Greek writings of Theophanes, Nicephorus, and George Syncellus, and made a collection of documents concerning the affairs of Pope Honorius I. Several important letters written by him have been preserved. The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which was formerly ascribed to him, was not written by him; he seems to have shared in the revision of the &quot;Life&quot; of Nicholas I.

<doc id="1045429" wikidata="Q275823" url="?curid=1045429" title="Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)">
<text>Michael Lauriston Thomas (born 24 August 1967) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder from 1986 to 2001.

During his time at Arsenal, he scored a last-minute goal in injury time during the final match of the 1988–89 season, which allowed the club to claim the First Division title over Liverpool. Two years later, Thomas joined Liverpool and scored the club&#x27;s opening goal in a 2–0 win in the 1992 FA Cup Final. He also had spells at Benfica and Wimbledon before retiring in 2001, after a career that saw him win medals in all of English football&#x27;s top three domestic football trophies. He was capped twice by England.

Michael now works as a pundit and media personality, writing a column for Just Arsenal, amongst other things.

==Club career==

===Arsenal===
Thomas was born in Lambeth, London. After growing up as a Tottenham Hotspur fan, he signed for rivals Arsenal as a schoolboy in 1982, turning professional on 31 December 1984 at the age of 17, just months after leaving school. He was loaned out to Portsmouth in early 1987, playing three times, before returning to Arsenal. His Gunners career started with a baptism of fire, as Thomas made his debut in the first leg of a League Cup semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur at Highbury on 8 February 1987.

Thomas soon became a regular in the Arsenal side, making his league debut in place of the suspended Viv Anderson on 14 February 1987 in a 1–1 draw with Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. But, for his next appearance, he was drafted into midfield role at Oxford United. The switch was a quick success, and Thomas extra versatility boosted his chances of a first team place. Just to prove his adaptability he stood in for injured Kenny Sansom and by the end of that campaign he had played 12 league games as Arsenal finished fourth and had a League Cup winners medal, coming on as a late substitute as Arsenal defeated Liverpool at Wembley.

In 1987–88 season, Thomas missed only five league games. He started off as right back following Andersons departure, then switched to midfield for the League Cup semi-final first leg win at Everton in February, and kept that role the rest of the season and finished with 9 goals in the league (2 of them were penalties). Steve Williams February suspension was the perfect opportunity for Thomas to be shifted into central midfield in order to add more energy and dynamism to this area. Arsenal reached the League Cup final again in April 1988, only to lose 3–2 to Luton Town, Thomas also won Arsenal Player of the Season.

The highlight of Thomas&#x27;s Arsenal career came in the 1988–89 title decider, on 26 May 1989. The First Division match between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield had been postponed due to the Hillsborough Disaster, and as a result was moved to the very end of the season, after the FA Cup final. Liverpool had won the FA Cup, and thus had a chance of completing an historic double. Arsenal had been top of the First Division table for most of the season, but Liverpool had overtaken them a few matches before the end of the campaign. Coming into the match, Arsenal were on 73 points with 71 goals for and 36 against (a goal difference of +35), while Liverpool were 3 points ahead on 76 points with 65 goals for and 26 against (a difference of +39). That meant that Arsenal needed to win by at least two goals to take the title (with points and goal difference equal, the team who had scored the most goals would be awarded the title). Liverpool had not lost by two goals at Anfield for nearly four years. After a goalless first half, Alan Smith scored soon after the restart, heading in a free kick from Nigel Winterburn. But as full-time approached it looked as if Arsenal were not going to score the second goal they needed. However, in injury time, in Arsenal&#x27;s last attack, Thomas surged forward from midfield, running onto a Smith flick-on, evaded a challenge by Steve Nicol, and chipped the advancing goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar to score Arsenal&#x27;s second and win the title, Arsenal&#x27;s first in eighteen years. The match was later featured in detail in a 1997 film based on the Nick Hornby book &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;. Thomas started in 33 league games in the title winning season, and scored 7 goals. He formed a brilliant midfield partnership with Kevin Richardson. The goal is often considered one of the greatest moments in Arsenal&#x27;s entire history.

In 1989-90, Thomas only missed six league games, but because of an ankle injury against Tottenham Hotspur 20 January 1990, his form suffered. He was in the England squad, and among the substitutes, when Brazil came to Wembley 28 March 1990, but the injury wrecked his chances of going to the World Cup Finals.

In 1990-91, Thomas played in 31 league games and was an important part of the League Championship winning side. Thomas dynamism in the centre of the park was the perfect combination to Paul Davis, strengthening Arsenal in the process. Thomas and Davis was one of the best central midfield partnerships Arsenal have ever had and each game they had played together, the bond became stronger. Such was their all-encompassing grasp on midfield. It was Thomas movement, stamina and ability to make runs on and off the ball that caused the damage. Seeing as he was constantly in motion, it meant that he was always pivotal in matches.

David Rocastle, who was back from his injuries, was switched into central midfield. However, after playing in only ten league games in 1991-92, Thomas lost his place to the more defensive David Hillier. During the championship run-in Thomas appeared in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, under the headline &quot;My Highbury Hell&quot;, criticising Arsenal manager George Graham. The Football Association took stern action and fined Thomas £3,000, and his relationship with Graham was beyond repair, reflected in a 1-0 loss in his final Arsenal match against West Ham United 2 November 1991 at Highbury.

As a result, he was sold to Liverpool, with their manager Graeme Souness paying the Gunners £1.5 million for Thomas&#x27;s services on 13 December 1991. In all, Thomas played 206 matches, scoring 30 goals for Arsenal, and was named the 37th greatest player in the history of Arsenal in an online poll on the Arsenal website in June 2008.

===Liverpool===
Thomas made his Liverpool debut five days after signing, on 18 December 1991. In a repeat of his Arsenal debut, his first match for Liverpool was against Tottenham Hotspur (though this time at White Hart Lane), coming on as a substitute for Jan Mølby in the 56th minute of a 2–1 victory.

Thomas scored his first goal for the Reds on 18 January 1992 in league victory over Oldham Athletic at Boundary Park. His first season at the club culminated with an FA Cup victory at Wembley against Sunderland. After a goalless first 45, Thomas scored the opening goal of the final after 47 minutes with a spectacular shot from a Steve McManaman cross. An assist for Ian Rush&#x27;s second goal sealed Thomas&#x27; contribution for his first silverware with Liverpool. However, after that, injuries began to blight Thomas&#x27;s time at Anfield. He became a squad player who was largely used as cover for the likes of Jamie Redknapp and John Barnes.

The 1994–95 season saw Thomas claim his only other winner&#x27;s medal during his time at Anfield, when the Reds won the League Cup final against Bolton Wanderers. Thomas was an unused substitute on the bench during that game, which saw McManaman scoring both the team&#x27;s goals as Liverpool won 2–1. Thomas then helped Liverpool reach the 1996 FA Cup final, where he saw five minutes of action after coming on as an 85th-minute substitute for Rob Jones. He couldn&#x27;t help the Reds prevent a 1–0 defeat at the hands of Manchester United. 1996–97 was a disappointing campaign for a Liverpool side who finished fourth in the Premier League after leading it during the winter, but Thomas re-emerged as a first team regular following the absence of Jamie Redknapp due to injury problems. However, when Redknapp was fully fit for the 1997–98 season, Thomas found himself on the sidelines again.

An £800,000 bid from Coventry City was accepted in early December 1997, but the transfer never happened. On 2 February 1998, Thomas was allowed to go out on loan to Middlesbrough, and made his debut two days later on 4 February in a 3–0 league win over Tranmere Rovers at the Riverside Stadium. He played 10 times for the Boro before he returned to Anfield. By this time manager Roy Evans was fielding Øyvind Leonhardsen and Danny Murphy ahead of Thomas, which led to him being surplus to requirements at Anfield. Thomas&#x27;s impression on the Anfield faithful during his time at the club was confirmed when he was voted in at No. 83 in &quot;100 Players Who Shook The Kop&quot;, a poll conducted by Liverpool FC&#x27;s official website in 2006 with over 110,000 fans voting.

===Benfica and Wimbledon===
Portuguese side Benfica, then managed by former Liverpool boss Graeme Souness, took Thomas to the Estádio da Luz on 1 August 1998, but his stay in Lisbon was an unsuccessful one as he found himself banished to the reserves after Souness was replaced by Jupp Heynckes. After two years with Benfica, he returned to England on 29 July 2000 to join Wimbledon, but after a single season in which he played nine times he retired from playing on 31 May 2001.

==International career==
Thomas was first called up to the England squad under manager Bobby Robson.

His debut came on 16 November 1988, at the age of 21, in the 1–1 friendly draw against Saudi Arabia in Riyadh, thus becoming the first player in Arsenal&#x27;s history to play at five different levels for his country. Thomas made his second and final England senior appearance just over a year later, on 13 December 1989 in a 2–1 friendly win over Yugoslavia.

==Personal life==
After retiring from football, Thomas set up his own security service. He also plays for the Liverpool legends team and currently resides in the city of Liverpool.

In 2019, Thomas featured as a guest substitute player in season one of the ITV show Harry&#x27;s Heroes, which featured former football manager Harry Redknapp attempting get a squad of former England international footballers back fit and healthy for a game against Germany legends.

<text>Birr is a municipality in the Swiss canton of Aargau and the capital of Brugg (district). The village lies halfway between Lenzburg and Brugg. Birr has grown with its neighbour Lupfig into a conurbation.

Birr is known as one of the places where the Swiss educator Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi established new standards in education. His gravesite in Birr is listed as a heritage site of national significance.
==History==

While a few artifacts from the Roman and Alamanni eras have been found in Birr, there was no known settlement. Birr is first mentioned in 1270 as &quot;Bire&quot;. Throughout the High Middle Ages the village belonged to the Habsburgs. The rights to rule the village went to Königsfelden Abbey at Windisch in 1397 and 1411. After the secularization of the monastery in 1528 those rights transferred to Bern.

The chapel, which was a subsidiary of Windisch, became a parish church during the Reformation. This parish includes Lupfig, Birrhard, Scherz, Schinznach-Bad and Brunegg. The current reformed church was built in 1662 by Abraham Dünz.

In 1771, Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi bought a piece of waste land called &quot;Neuhof&quot; (New Farm), where he attempted the cultivation of madder. Pestalozzi knew nothing of business, and the plan failed. Before this he had opened his farm-house as a school, but that plan also met with failure. His later attempts at founding schools and education theory were more successful. However, following an 1815 rebellion among the teachers of his school, his last ten years were marred by weariness and sorrow. In 1825 he retired to Neuhof, the place of his youth, and after writing the adventures of his life, and his last work, the &quot;Swans Song&quot;, he died at Brugg. Since 1914, &quot;Neuhof&quot; has served as a reform school.

After 1950 Birr changed from an agricultural to an industrial village. The arrival of BBC (a factory for the manufacture of rotating electrical machinery) in 1957-65 along with a 500 apartment housing development, resulted in a strong growth spurt. By 1990 the working population included commuters (73%), industrial workers (46%) and foreigners (44%). Only about 1% of the population worked in agriculture.

<doc id="1045437" wikidata="Q3379785" url="?curid=1045437" title="Gail Porter">
<text>Gail Porter (born 23 March 1971) is a Scottish television personality, former model and actress. She started her television career in children&#x27;s TV, before branching out into modelling and presenting mainstream TV. In 1999, she posed nude for &quot;FHM&quot;, an image which was projected on to the Houses of Parliament. Later in her career, Porter has been affected by alopecia, a condition which causes hair loss.

==Life and career==
Porter attended Portobello High School in Edinburgh. She studied for a BTec HND in media production at West Herts College. After making an unsuccessful bid to join the presentation team of the BBC children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, she had a minor role in one episode of the BBC medical drama series &quot;Cardiac Arrest&quot; before going on to present family-friendly and children&#x27;s programmes. They include &quot;Children&#x27;s BBC Scotland&quot;, &quot;T.I.G.S&quot;, &quot;Around Scotland&quot;, &quot;MegaMag&quot;, &quot;Up For It!&quot;, &quot;Sticky&quot;, &quot;Disney&#x27;s Great Cartoon Chase&quot;, &quot;How 2&quot;, &quot;Scratchy &amp; Co&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot;, &quot;Children in Need&quot;, &quot;Fully Booked&quot;, &quot;The Movie Chart Show&quot;, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;Live &amp; Kicking&quot;, and programmes such as &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; and &quot;Gail Porter&#x27;s Big 90s&quot; for VH1.

In the late 1990s she began to pose for magazines such as &quot;FHM&quot;. A nude photograph of Porter was projected on the Houses of Parliament in 1999 as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign, and accompanied it with a message to vote for her in the &quot;FHM&quot; Sexiest Women Poll. In her autobiography, Porter says she did not know about the stunt until it was reported the following day. In an interview with the BBC in 2020, she said that the incident left her so distraught that she was unable to get out of bed for a long time.

In 2001, Porter took part in the reality television show &quot;Celebrity Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot; and on &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;. In 2003, she was on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Games&quot;, although injury curtailed her participation.

In 2004 to 2006 she presented three series of &quot;Dead Famous&quot; and in 2009 presented episodes of &quot;The Gadget Show&quot;, temporarily replacing Suzi Perry. In 2008 to 2011, Porter was a regular panelist on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;.

In 2010, she was a guest team captain on &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; with Rufus Hound, Joe Swash and Sara Cox on Watch. In August 2010, she began the Two Way Street campaign for solicitors Russell Jones &amp; Walker, an initiative to develop the relationship between HGV drivers and cyclists, keeping them safer. In October 2010, Porter hosted a documentary on Current TV, &quot;Gail Porter on Prostitution&quot; which investigated sex work laws.

In 2014, Porter was a guest editor of &quot;Fashion Plus&quot; magazine. She appeared at London Fashion Week in September 2014 and wrote of her experiences for the magazine.

On 27 August 2015 she entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house. On 15 September, she was the fourth housemate to be evicted after spending 20 days in the house.

In 2017 she became the brand ambassador for the insolvency practitioner Creditfix, meeting with the public and speaking openly about her struggles with debt in several corporate videos.

In 2018, she joined 26 other celebrities at Metropolis Studios and performed an original Christmas song called Rock With Rudolph, a song written and produced by Grahame and Jack Corbyn. The song was recorded in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital and was released digitally through independent record label Saga Entertainment on 30 November 2018 under the artist name The Celebs. The music video debuted exclusively with The Sun on 29 November 2018 and had its first TV showing on Good Morning Britain on 30 November 2018. The song peaked at number two on the iTunes pop chart.

In 2020, Porter narrated the BBC Scotland series &quot;Inside The Zoo&quot;.

At the start of 2022, Porter was a presenter of &quot;Spooked Scotland&quot; (called &quot;Haunted Scotland&quot; for the American audience) alongside Chris Fleming.

==Alopecia==
In 2005 Porter developed alopecia totalis, losing her hair. She decided not to wear a hat or wig in order to raise awareness of the condition. She became ambassador for the Little Princess Trust, a charity which provides wigs to children with hair loss. On &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot; on 15 February 2006 she showed her hair, eyebrows and eyelashes were beginning to grow back. On 12 April 2006 she said &quot;It is possible that I&#x27;m going to get my hair back.&quot; By May 2010 hair had grown on three-quarters of her scalp. By the end of the year, her hair had started falling out again.

Porter&#x27;s condition was the subject of the BBC &quot;ONE Life&quot; series documentary &quot;Gail Porter Laid Bare&quot; on 31 May 2006. Her autobiography, &quot;Laid Bare: My Story of Love, Fame and Survival&quot;, was published in September 2007.

==Other activities==
Gail Porter takes part in a number of charitable causes. She is a vice-president of The Children&#x27;s Trust, a UK charity for children with brain injuries, and is an ambassador for Together Co, a loneliness charity in Brighton and Hove.

Porter tried stand-up comedy and appeared at the Comedy Store on 23 November 2009 in the &quot;Laughing Point&quot; event to help the youth homelessness charity, Centrepoint. Her autobiographical standup show &quot;Hung Drawn and Portered&quot; at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival mixed laughter and her personal hardships.

==Personal life==
Porter married Toploader guitarist Dan Hipgrave in August 2001 and gave birth to their daughter Honey on 3 September 2002. She said in February 2005 that they had separated eight months earlier. Before they met, Porter was in a relationship with Keith Flint, the vocalist from The Prodigy.

Porter has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

She is a black belt in karate.

On 8 September 2011, Porter told BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s presenter Phil Williams that she had been detained under the Mental Health Act of 2007 for 17 days of treatment against her will. She stated that the signature on the documents to have her involuntarily committed to psychiatric treatment was that of her then-boyfriend, after texting him to say she felt suicidal. She said she had been &quot;very frail, so who knows&quot;. She said she felt no benefit from the stay. She praised the staff but said the resources and the facilities were under-funded.
