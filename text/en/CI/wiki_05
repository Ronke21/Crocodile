<text>The Very Best of The Smiths is a compilation album by English rock band The Smiths. It was released in June 2001 by WEA in Europe, without consent or input from the band. It reached number 30 on the UK Albums Chart. The album was not released in the United States.

==Background==
After &quot;Singles&quot; (1995), the previous Smiths compilation album that WEA (now the Warner Music Group) had issued, went out of print in Europe, Australia and Taiwan, the record company decided to revamp the package slightly and release it under the name &quot;The Very Best of The Smiths&quot;. WEA scrambled the running order and added five tracks, and enticed the record buyers with the incentive of digital remastering.

The album was widely criticised by the British music press, who, after stopping to praise the actual music, went on to condemn what they saw as a money-grabbing exercise. They were quickly joined by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, who distanced themselves from the album, stating they had had no input whatsoever and that it should be ignored by fans. Both ridiculed the cover design and Marr additionally denounced the sound quality.

In the tradition of other Smiths compilations which largely overlapped except for a few songs, this album does contain two versions not available on any other of The Smiths&#x27; albums: the single mix of &quot;Ask&quot; and the 7-inch edit of &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot;. The &quot;Singles&quot; compilation used the album versions of these songs.

===Cover===
The sleeve for &quot;The Very Best of The Smiths&quot; features Charles Hawtrey of &quot;Carry On&quot; fame, one of Morrissey&#x27;s favourite actors (he wrote an obituary of him in the &quot;NME&quot;). The band members had no say in the cover, which has been described as &quot;an adman&#x27;s approximation of a Smiths cover&quot; by &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine.

<doc id="1044303" wikidata="Q7844921" url="?curid=1044303" title="Trocken">
<text>Trocken, German for &quot;dry&quot;, is a classification of German wine that indicates a wine that is dry rather than off-dry (&quot;halbtrocken&quot;), sweeter (&quot;lieblich&quot;) or sweet (&quot;süß&quot;). &quot;Trocken&quot; wines are not devoid of residual sugar, but have, at most, a few grams per liter, which can be perceptible but is not overtly sweet. &quot;Trocken&quot; is also a designation for Austrian wine, but more rarely used there than in Germany, since many quality categories of Austrian wines are dry by default.

Somewhat confusingly, for &quot;Sekt&quot; and other sparkling wines, &quot;trocken&quot; indicates a higher level of sugar than it does for non-sparkling wines. A &quot;Sekt trocken&quot; is best described as off-dry or semi-sweet, while a &quot;Sekt brut&quot; is completely dry. 

==Requirements==

The maximum amount of sugar allowed for a &quot;trocken&quot; designation depends on the level of acid in the wine. For wine low in acid, a maximum of sugar is allowed. If the acid level exceeds , the sugar may exceed the acid level by 2 grams per liter, up to a maximum sugar content of . Most high-quality German white wines have a high enough acidity to be allowed up to 9 grams per liter of sugar under the &quot;trocken&quot; level. When used, the requirements in Austria are exactly the same.

===Sparkling wines===
When used for sparkling wine, the term &quot;trocken&quot; means a sugar content of . This parallels the term &quot;sec&quot; (&quot;dry&quot;) in French, which indicates a sparkling wine of the same sugar level as &quot;trocken&quot;. Drier wines are designated &quot;extra trocken&quot; at , while completely dry sparkling wines are given the designation &quot;brut&quot; (0–15 g/L) or &quot;extra brut&quot; (0–6 g/L).

==Background==
Until the invention of sterile filtration, most German wines were dry. Fermentation continued until all the sugar was consumed, leaving only miscellaneous unfermentable sugars. Only the occasional sweet rarity, made from extremely ripe grapes, kept any residual sugar. For most of the twentieth century, the style was typically sweeter low-alcohol wines. Only since about 1990 has &quot;trocken&quot; wine become popular, partly because many prefer it with food. Most exported German wine is still of the sweeter styles. While it appears in the term &quot;trockenbeerenauslese&quot;, &quot;trocken&quot; in that case refers to the dried grapes, not the dryness of the resulting wine.

<doc id="1044314" wikidata="Q5576867" url="?curid=1044314" title="Gods of Arr-Kelaan">
<text>The Gods of Arr-Kelaan is a fantasy/humor webcomic drawn and written by illustrator Chuck Rowles and aided with visual effects and the coloring help of his brother Steve Rowles. It&#x27;s hosted on its own site, as well as some publications still found on a webcomic portal/community known as &quot;The Duck&quot; (formally &quot;Drunk Duck&quot;).

The comic, although still online and available in printed works, has been on unknown hiatus since Early 2010. The comic at its most popular updated twice a week, with the comic gathering approximately 4400 unique hits per day. It has been featured on Comixpedia, the Webcomics Examiner and Comic World News, and in print in the &quot;Weekender&quot;. Rowles has also done book signings.

The world of Arr-Kelaan was created in 1986 by Len Zaikoski, a friend of Chuck Rowles, for use in a role-playing game. Rowles initially contributed one deity, then a few more, then found himself with a full pantheon and stories to tell about them. He started drawing the comic to do so, initially intending it to be in pamphlet form but ending up taking it online. &quot;Gods&quot; has been published in several paperback print collections, and one of its five major story arcs is only available in print.

==Setting==
As the interstellar cruise ship &quot;Traveller&quot; on its maiden voyage (with Earthling passengers and a multiplanetary crew) comes under pirate attack, its captain panics and does the impossible, sending his vessel plunging into an alternate dimension. Upon waking on the world of Arr-Kelaan, the survivors discover they have gained the power of gods: they are indestructible, they can hear the thoughts of mortals, create anything with a mere thought and even bring back the dead. Arr-Kelaan itself is something out of a fantasy novel, with mages and dragons.

===Campaign===
Zaikoski&#x27;s Arr-Kelaan grew into a full-scale Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign setting, compatible with 2nd edition rules and available online. In contrast to many RPG-derived works, Rowles&#x27; Arr-Kelaan is scantly recognizable. The geography and the basic D&amp;D elements of a vaguely medieval society and polytheistic/henotheistic pantheons are the same, but whereas the game focuses on adventurers in a world stably ruled by Travellers-turned-gods for millennia, &quot;Gods&quot; portrays the effects of the Travellers on the world and each other when they first arrive and establish themselves.

==Structure==
&quot;Gods&quot; shows its offline origins in its full-page paperback layout. Stories are organized into lengthy arcs, which in turn are split into &quot;issues&quot; of roughly two dozen pages each. Pages are designed to form a whole more than to stand on their own; conversations often carry over for several, and there are few overt last-panel punchlines. &quot;Gods&quot; is normally black and white, although issue &quot;covers&quot; and &quot;Volume Zero&quot; are in color. Partway through &quot;Consequences&quot; &quot;Gods&quot; made a switch to full colour, there are plans to add color to all pages from &quot;Consequences&quot;.

The comic&#x27;s plot is highly character-driven, to the point of largely leaving the mages and dragons on the wayside: When asked how &quot;Gods&quot; fits into the fantasy genre, Rowles answered &quot;With a shoehorn, I think.&quot; The great number of characters forms an ensemble cast, though in practice Ronson has received the most exposure.

==Stories==
The timeline of &quot;Gods of Arr-Kelaan&quot; can be somewhat confusing, as the events were neither drawn nor shown in their chronological order.

Here are the stories in order of their own timeline, with the more supplemental ones indented:
::* &quot;As Luck Would Have It&quot; - Sharra and Loki find themselves in opposition over a mortal wager. Part of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;.
* &quot;Volume 0&quot; - details Ronson waking up on Arr-Kelaan, uncertain of how he got there and slowly discovering his new godly abilities. This story and the next do feature a party of adventurers, only to have Ronson&#x27;s presence irreparably break their paradigm.
* &quot;For the Death of Kings&quot; - Details one of Ronson&#x27;s first adventures, which takes place several months after &quot;Volume 0&quot; and features the first appearances of Claremont and Salsmen. The story is available only in print, in the first book of &quot;Going Home.&quot; (Written from 1991–1993)
:* The Price of Knowledge - Originally planned as a featurette for the comic book publication of &quot;Death of Kings&quot;, &quot;Price&quot; was instead gathered into one place as a chapter in the former&#x27;s book release. The two take place simultaneously.
:* &quot;A Tolerable Day&quot; - A wordless short story that gives an example of Ronson&#x27;s life. The story has been printed in the first Night Gig Sampler and reprinted in the book version of &quot;Myths &amp; Legends.&quot; (Started in 2002, finished in 2006)
* &quot;Going Home&quot; - Details Ronson&#x27;s travels to find the ship he crashed on Arr-Kelaan with, as he encounters various other Traveller gods and how they have adapted to their new powers. Features the most pivotal single event of the new pantheon. The print version is slightly expanded with a handful of pages through the story that are not present online. (Written from 2003–2005)
:* &quot;The Guy on the Rock&quot; - Ronson and his followers come upon a man in the desert. The story is four pages long and takes place between the first and second parts of &quot;Going Home&quot;. It is printed in the second book of &quot;Going Home.&quot;
* &quot;Consequences&quot; - The ongoing story, taking place months after &quot;Going Home&quot;. &quot;Consequences&quot; takes a broader look into the state of the planet and has several major storylines. (Started in 2006, finished in 2009)
:* &quot;Lucky Break&quot; - General Shrub was banished to a small island in the middle of nowhere. It would take a lot of luck to get him out of there. Features the Sharras. The story is an offshoot of the events in &quot;Going Home&quot;, it has been printed in &quot;Drunk Duck Volume 2.&quot; and The Gods of Arr-Kelaan: Short Stories Volume One
:* &quot;The Point of Some Return&quot; - A party of adventurous seeks a cleric to revive a fallen comrade. This story shows the long-term results of some events in Consequences.
:* &quot;Scared To Death&quot; - A follower of Shadowscared dies but his soul is nowhere to be found, Thanantria sends Shadowscared to track him down.
::* &quot;Fear of Bunnies&quot; - Bunny objects to Zeus&#x27; treatment of his followers while Shadowscared watches on. Part of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;.
::* &quot;The Love of Knowledge&quot; - Claremont travels to the top of the highest mountain in Arr-Kelaan for an experiment, to his surprise Wenya is waiting for him. Part of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;.
:* &quot;This Guy Walks Into A Bar&quot; - Features Brindle and Aanlonar from &quot;Going Home&quot;, many years later. The story is an offshoot of the events in &quot;Going Home&quot; and is printed in &quot;Drunk Duck Volume 3 and The Gods of Arr-Kelaan: Short Stories Volume One.&quot;
:* &quot;Dead Man Working&quot; - A follower of Bikk&#x27;s gets unusually creative to make a profit. The story is a collaboration between Chuck Rowles and Sean Howard of squidi.net, it has been printed in &quot;NightGig of the Living Dead #2 and The Gods of Arr-Kelaan: Short Stories Volume One.&quot;
::*&quot;Family Matters&quot; - To protect his daughter Claremont seeks the aid of several different gods. Part of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;.
:* &quot;Tankard of Trouble&quot; - Many years after two miraculous tankards of endless ale were given to a couple of soldiers, Ronson steps in to rectify a situation he had not been aware of. The story is an offshoot of the events in &quot;Going Home&quot; it was printed in &quot;Drunk Duck Volume 1.&quot; and The Gods of Arr-Kelaan: Short Stories Volume One&quot;
::*&quot;Dealing with Deities&quot; - Bikk decides to recruit Teldin into his service. Part of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;.
::*&quot;Not All Prophets are Profitable&quot; - Kerrimachus has a rather confusing encounter with Sephin. Part of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;.
* &quot;Myths &amp; Legends&quot; - Well over a century after all other stories, the Gods of Arr-Kelaan have settled in and become a worshipped pantheon. The story is told from the point of view of mortals, with numerous flashbacks and tales. Ronson is not the main character. &quot;Myths &amp; Legends&quot; was originally written in 1996, and rescripted (and somewhat revised) in 2006, making it the second oldest of all stories.

==Characters==

===&quot;Traveller&quot;s===

The &quot;Traveller&quot; gods are the survivors of the spaceship crash, who awakened years if not decades later all over the world to find themselves apparently appointed its rightful deities. Mentally they&#x27;re unchanged, and a central theme of the comic is their adaptation to their new positions. Most are human beings in shape; two are of demihuman races and three of monstrous humanoid races, all endemic to Earth&#x27;s universe. The name is a slight misnomer, as several are from the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;, the pirate vessel that attacked the &quot;Traveller&quot; and in fact supply much of the pantheon&#x27;s sinister side.

As deities, each is associated with a domain that reflects their personality or traits (the survivors, and thus the domains, were &quot;almost certainly&quot; not determined randomly. ) What they&#x27;re actually known as can vary: Salsmen of Deceit is much more likely to be worshipped as Salsmen of Power. They hear mortal prayers associated either with them or their domains. In &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;, a large group of people unhappy and afraid draws both Bunny (happiness) and Shadowscared (fear). One without a following hears everything in the vicinity.

Their godly powers amount to reality warping around themselves: spontaneous item generation, flight, teleporting themselves and others to where they&#x27;ve already been, slowing their perception of time, polymorphing, telepathy, the traditional fireballs and lightning bolts, etc. Gods generate divine power spontaneously, without any external source, and in a very real sense they are beings of this power: Their appearance is now entirely a personal choice (many loom huge when appropriate, Claremont&#x27;s gone subatomic), with a default to how they see themselves , and they are impervious to physical damage and pain, up to and including atmospheric reentry without a vehicle. They can sleep but need not to. The &quot;Traveller&quot; Gods are not entirely immortal when facing each other, non-&quot;Traveller&quot; gods or legendary magic items.

The &quot;Traveller&quot;s start as rough equals, but their powers are limited by their levels of skill in wielding them. . Making new life is thus far too complex, resurrection is only possible if the soul is available. The acquisition of magical artifacts has given some gods an advantage.

Priests and clerics draw upon their patrons&#x27; strength as magical power. The closer the followers&#x27; beliefs are to the ideals of their god, the more power they have. The gods could leave Arr-Kelaan and settle on another world, although their powers would be weaker. This is the same drop in power experienced by earth gods who came to Arr-Kelaan.

(An illustration of just about all of the gods can be found at http://www.rmcomics.com/Cast.htm .)

* Ronson B. Eichler – God of Apathy/Alcohol, a passenger on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. The main character of most of the stories and the author&#x27;s first creation. A balding man, almost perpetually unhappy, Ronson was once a successful businessman living a marvelous life on Earth – until the death of his wife, Emily, left him an alcoholic wreck and practically emotionally dead. Though he&#x27;s a recluse and prefers not being bothered by prayers, Ronson rarely ignores people who need his help. He began his success story with a brewery and brought beer to Arr-Kelaan, making him the God of Alcohol as well. Unable to become drunk, but still spends much of his time manifesting and consuming drinks. Ronson has no desire for glory, no grand plans for Arr-Kelaan. He initially refuses to be worshipped, not seeing why he should be or why he&#x27;d have any right for it. After he caves in his actual temples lie very few and far between, and his clerics are in taverns doing much the same as him. Whatever it is that Sephin hears seems to have appointed him the leader of the gods; his response is to drink beer and really wish it hadn&#x27;t. Inti in the comic and theologians in the original setting both surmise that such leadership may actually be beneficial by tempering others&#x27; desires to make demands of their followers and shape the planet in their image.
* Bikk – God of Trade/Commerce, the chief financier and navigator of the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;. A man obsessed with wealth, power and status, Bikk&#x27;s first move on Arr-Kelaan was to establish a church of himself. His ultimate goal is his boyhood dream of world domination. Though happy on Arr-Kelaan Bikk has expressed a desire to return and conquer Earth. Bikk is an expert at manipulation and negotiation, highly deceitful although he will stick to any written contract. Physically Bikk resembles a relatively normal man with a huge nose, and always dresses in the latest fashions. Bikk&#x27;s church is a cross between a religious institute and a commercial one, his opulent temples often doubling as merchants guilds or banks. The church exhibits all the negative traits of capitalism and will go to any lengths to make a profit; on the other hand, Zaikoski&#x27;s prototypical Arr-Kelaan describes it as a major investor in roads and other trading infrastructure .
* Beyurn – Goddess of War, the first mate on the &quot;Traveller&quot; with some kind of military background. Beyurn is an honourable, hot-headed, pointy-eared, slightly built juhlann, a member of a conveniently elf-like race native to Earth&#x27;s universe. As Goddess of War Beyurn takes more interest in planning and strategy than taking part in combat however she is still a formidable fighter and makes full use of her divine powers alongside traditional combat skills. Beyurn believes that as a Goddess it is her duty to change Arr-Kelaan for the better, she seeks to promote peace, stability and Civilization. These goals have led to a strong alliance with Mike. In person, Beyurn reacts to every sign of trouble as if the barbarians were at the gates. In her defense, they often are.
* Claremont Grimsby – God of Knowledge, a passenger on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. Claremont&#x27;s is a keen mind endlessly fascinated with the universe, slow to anger but just and resolute. Gray-haired, bespectacled and bearing a moustache, he suits his role like a glove. It took deification to make him religious. Claremont is a friend of Ronson, and Emily&#x27;s brother, and his clerics are the scientists of the world. Claremont&#x27;s information networks are rivaled only by Bikk&#x27;s. He weds a mortal named Wenya a good time after his arrival, and decades later has a daughter named Hazel, becoming (in his own words) &quot;the first god to take parenting seriously&quot;.
* Mike – God of Honor/Valor, chief of security on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. Mike&#x27;s a blonde-haired ox of a man without an unkind bone in his body. When he woke up with his strange new powers, he did the logical thing and became a superhero. For four years, he was the defender of the city of Kinidrius with a strong Superman motif both in his clothing (a blue suit, with a red cape) and his actions (catching evildoers, saving kittens from burning buildings, the works). Like Beyurn, Mike was shocked to learn the full extent of his godly abilities. He left Kinidrius, planning to teach humans to care for themselves rather than rely on him. He kept the outfit.
* Salsmen D&#x27;elgadath – God of Evil/Deceit, captain of the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;. Brother of Thanantria. Salsmen is a hulking man with a strong, roguish charm spoiled by his sinister air, and the primary antagonist. He&#x27;s cal and believes himself to be the one true god of the world. Salsmen&#x27;s combination of ruthlessness, strength and intelligence makes him likely the greatest threat to Arr-Kelaan: will can attack for fun when he can, make grand plans when it&#x27;s required and coerce or intimidate others to his side. Salsmen is a major character in &quot;For The Death of Kings&quot; and &quot;Consequences&quot;, and a bit player elsewhere. He was originally planned as the god of deceit before being promoted to the primary antagonist – his name is a play on &quot;salesman.&quot;
* Shadowscared (John Shadowscar) – God of Fear (being afraid), captain of the &quot;Traveller&quot;. He&#x27;s afraid of almost everything, from ordinary fears like heights to fear of Abraham Lincoln. He was first called &quot;Shadowscared&quot; by Sephin, but in unenthusiastic company; most likely Sephin was just channeling the actual coiner of the name. Shadowscared&#x27;s cloak makes him invisible and intangible even to other gods.
* Sharra – Goddess(es) of Fortune and Misfortune, a passenger on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. An attractive black woman who was split into her opposite aspects in combat with a non-&quot;Traveller&quot; deity. The two get along well enough, but calling on one can bring the attention of the other – or both. Their familiar is a talking dog, Pilfo, a boy who lost his humanity in the same battle (but appears to regain it as a young human man on his time off).
* Krushcor – God of Battles, crew member on the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;. An Ares to Beyurn&#x27;s Athena, the two get along like oil and water. He relishes fighting and to the point of taking on fellow &quot;Traveller&quot;s barehanded. For his domain Krushcor is surprisingly well groomed, polite and properly spoken, even possessing a form of charm through his childlike honesty. Mainly he seeks to enjoy himself, though finding a satisfying opponent is quite hard – and he doesn&#x27;t particularly care about whom he hurts. Krushcor first properly appears in &quot;Consequences&quot; after cameos and mentions. It is blasphemy against Krushor to resurrect the dead ; this rule evolved from a punishment enforced by Thanantria during Consequences.
* Dulcifer – Goddess of Love/Romance, passenger on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. A refined, composed, sleek raven-haired woman who wrote romance novels or other related books as a human. In Zaikoski&#x27;s prototypical, not necessarily applicable, descriptions of the world she and Ronson are close. She first meets him and his aura of indifference in &quot;Consequences&quot;; in &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;, set decades after, they appear next to each other in a crowd.
* Bunny – Goddess of Happiness, a passenger on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. Bunny is a friendly, open, blonde young woman with an inexhaustible supply of perkiness. She looks and acts much like a cheerleader.
* Thanantria – Goddess of Death, crew member on the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;. Originally called Nan. The sister of Salsmen is grim and blunt both in looks and in personality. She is defined largely by her tasks – seeing to the fallen – which by her account are not a choice. She gains and befriends the skeleton god-staff Thanatos by exchanging it with her brother for a soul-drinking sword. With it, she&#x27;s the ultimate authority over death on Arr-Kelaan.
* Kerrimachus – God of Disease, passenger on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. A small, pale, dapper man who believes that the creation of plagues is crucial to the development of the world in a Darwinian sense. As he is known to have repeatedly failed medical school, his real motive could be spite. Kerrimachus is European and may have something against Americans, or perhaps just Alden and Claremont. Sephin has foretold the death of Kerrimachus at the hands of Trista, assuming Sephin told/actually knows the truth. Even if it is true, it may not happen for a long, long time.
* Alden – Goddess of Medicine.
* V&#x27;lnn – Goddess of Pain. V&#x27;lnn is a reptilian humanoid who served on the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;; since deification she remained loyal to Salsmen. Little is known of V&#x27;lnn other than that she believes that pain offers pleasure, tries to avoid doing anything that lessens pain, and distrusts Bikk.
* Durrill – God of Craftsmen/Artisans, chief engineer on the &quot;Traveller&quot;. A member of a conveniently dwarflike race in Earth&#x27;s dimension, their short height being the result of high gravity on their homeworld Trellinda. Durrill is an extremely skilled engineer and prone to get highly excited over his latest project.
* Darkmarr – God of Assassins/Thieves.
* Sploon – God of Hate/Prejudice.
* Isurus – God of Nightmares, crew member on the &quot;Competent Offender&quot;. Isurus is a short tempered and violent deity with a sadistic streak that leads him to routinely inflict mortals with nightmares for enjoyment. Isurus possess powers over dreams that even experienced deities lack. Physically Isurus resembles a brown-skinned human with a horse&#x27;s head.
* Providence – God(s) of Music/Art. A divine band, whose members are able to play any instrument they choose.
* Luranna Greenglade – Goddess of Nature. Luranna is an environmentalist named by her hippie parents and the only god known to communicate with Arr-Kelaan itself and has become &quot;one with nature&quot; after being told everything Arr-Kelaan experienced since its birth as a molecular cloud. Luranna is the only &quot;Traveller&quot; god not visible on the cast page.

===Notable characters===
* Sephin - The Oracle of Leshan-Faar is a laid-back, perky and highly infuriating man in a Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses. His background and the extent of his considerable powers are unknown, but he claims to know absolutely everything (but not all at once) and that the planet talks to him. The former boast is backed up by the way Sephin&#x27;s unhampered by traditional chronology and makes references to future events, and he&#x27;s also shown massive magical and technological know-how. Sephin does not age. The Traveller gods owe their lives and positions to his foresight, and he can often be seen setting things up with varying degrees of subtlety to go the way he knows they will. If he ever knows why, he&#x27;s not talking. In &quot;Myths and Legends&quot; he&#x27;s a seemingly helpless agent of causality, in &quot;Consequences&quot; the deliberate proverbial butterfly.
* Wenya - A scientist of exceptional skill and a capable adventurer. She never joined the scientific institutions, Claremont&#x27;s priesthood, not being religious. Her life&#x27;s work was to prove the existence of an invisible third moon, which led her to enormous lengths to reach Claremont himself as he made the moon visible for a brief while. Their meeting led to co-research, marriage and an eventual child, Hazel. Like all god&#x27;s companions, Wenya is immortal.
* Hazel - The daughter of Claremont and Wenya, who unlike her parents has no aptitude or interest in science and studied combat with Beyurn, eventually becoming her follower. Hazel left the floating city of the gods to live as a mortal and took the life of a hero. By all accounts she was quite successful at this. Surprisingly for the daughter of a god, magic makes Hazel queasy. Hazel first appears as a main character of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;, having grown old, retired and now living as a hermit.
* Teldin - A valiant and retired hero. The second main character of &quot;Myths and Legends&quot;. Teldin was once tricked into working for Bikk until Hazel, on one of her quests, showed him the error of his ways. Thankfully Bikk did not kill him when he quit, but instead told him that the one he loved would die an early death. This turned out to be a half-truth. Bikk knew about Hazel&#x27;s potion that could make her immortal, and he guessed(correctly) that Hazel would never take it.
* Inti - The non-Traveller sun god, and the only old deity known to have left the world peacefully. The current story is centered around his final days on Arr-Kelaan. Inti is dressed in largely Mesoamerican garb, described by Chuck Rowles as &quot;Part Incan, part Aztec and part Dwarfish,&quot; and comes across as kind and unassuming when he&#x27;s not being 20 meters tall.
* Trista - Princess of Panvonia. According to Sephin, Trista is fated to kill Kerrimachus. Attempting to protect himself, Kerrimachus attempted to kill Trista first. To prevent this, Hazel gave her a potion created by Claremont with the aid of several other gods, originally meant for Hazel herself. This potion gave Trista immunity to disease, physical injury, pain and death (until she wishes it). It also means that her enemies have no knowledge of her unless she wishes it, making Sephin&#x27;s prophecy quite plausible.
* Satan: Satan has been at work in Gods of Arr-Kelaan since the beginning, he was the mysterious entity holding Emily hostage. Satan revealed himself in part 2 of Consequences, he appears as a human with small horns, smart yet casual modern attire and completely white eyes. In conversation Satan is a smooth talker with a cheerful, friendly attitude and casual acknowledgement of the wickedness of his designs, overall Satan&#x27;s attitude is highly evocative of Salsman&#x27;s. Satan enjoys damning souls whether or not they justly deserve Hell&#x27;s torments, he has a particular fondness for capturing other gods. It is later revealed that this is for the gods to serve as batteries for a machines that will allow gods to return to Earth.

===Secondary characters===
* Emily - Ronson&#x27;s late wife. The two were very much in love until she died of cancer on Earth five years before Ronson crashed on Arr-Kelaan Her ghost occasionally appear before Ronson, but only to disappear shortly after. He screamed her name at night. It was discovered that Satan had used her as bait to lure Ronson into a trap and bind the both of them in hell.
:It is claimed by Satan that, when Ronson became a god, his desire for her was enough to call her out of heaven to him. However, Satan&#x27;s claim has been called into question by Inti, who stated that neither Satan nor Ronson had the power to pull Emily from Heaven.
* Brindle - One of Ronson&#x27;s first &quot;followers&quot;. Ronson first encountered Brindle in the desert, where he was attempting to run away from the General Shrub&#x27;s army. Brindle accompanied Ronson through much of &quot;Going Home&quot;, and left towards the end when Ronson set up a tavern for him to run.
:The following years are good to him as he minds the bar and sires offspring. Brindle becomes a man devoted to his patron&#x27;s way of not getting devoted: Laid-back and easygoing as only someone who has not getting worked up as a teaching can be, yet he doesn&#x27;t care that much about the rules and gets involved whenever the well-being of those dear to him is jeopardized. This makes Ronson amiably noncommittal.
* Aanlonar - Ronson&#x27;s second &quot;follower&quot;, he was a friend of Brindle&#x27;s in General Shrub&#x27;s army, and eventually followed Ronson as well on his journey. Aanlonar is an elf of unusually large size, though he claims this is a &quot;glandular disorder&quot;. Other people suspect that he is not pure elf, but likely has some mixed blood from an ogre. Aanlonar eventually left Ronson (with Ronson&#x27;s blessing) for a life of defending justice by joining Mike.
* General Shrub - An unpleasant man, he created a large army on the orders of Beyurn.
* Grox - A brog (a sentient species on Arr-Kelaan). Formerly violent and angry, but eventually changed after meeting Mike. Grox runs Mike&#x27;s school of ethics and justice.

<text>is the southernmost part of Shibuya ward in Tokyo, Japan, and a major district of the ward. It was developed on the site of a former brewery and is home to Yebisu Garden Place. It has a high concentration of bars and restaurants.

==Geography and transportation==

Ebisu is a major district and neighborhood of the special ward of Shibuya. It is the southernmost part of Shibuya, north of Meguro ward.

Ebisu is accessed by the JR Yamanote Line and Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line via Ebisu Station.

==History==

Ebisu was founded around 1928 as a community developed around the Japan Beer Brewery Company (now Sapporo Breweries Limited) facilities which began brewing Yebisu Beer in 1890.

After the breweries were moved to Chiba in 1988, the area underwent a major urban development resulting in the construction of Yebisu Garden Place, which opened to the public in 1994. Following the construction of Yebisu Garden Place in 1994, the area around Ebisu Station developed rapidly.

The district and railway station of Ebisu takes its name from the Yebisu Beer brand, which in turn was named after Ebisu (one of the Japanese Seven lucky gods). The spelling &quot;Yebisu&quot; is intentionally archaic. With or without the &quot;y&quot; the pronunciation is the same as &quot;Ebisu&quot;.

==Sightseeing and attractions==

===Food and drink===
Ebisu has a high concentration of restaurants, cafés, &quot;izakaya&quot;, ramen shops, bars and old-fashioned &quot;tachinomi&quot; (&quot;stand and drink&quot;) bars.

===Yebisu Garden Place===

Yebisu Garden Place is a shopping and cultural center located in Ebisu. It has a sloped promenade leading to a large central plaza covered by a wide glass arch. The area regularly hosts events and markets on weekends.

It is accessible via the Ebisu Skywalk (a fast-moving covered walkway) from JR Ebisu Station East Exit, which takes approximately 5 minutes on foot.

The complex contains the following attractions:
* Sapporo Breweries headquarters
* Museum of Yebisu Beer
* Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography
* Château Restaurant Joël Robuchon, a replica of a Louis XVI French château, which houses three Michelin-starred restaurants (L&#x27;Atelier de Joël Robuchon - 2 stars, La Table de Joël Robuchon - 2 stars, and Le Chateau de Joël Robuchon - 3 stars)
* Yebisu Garden Place Tower, a skyscraper with &quot;sky dining&quot; restaurants on the top 38th and 39th floors with panoramic views over Tokyo
* Atre shopping arcade
* Glass Square, a self-enclosed shopping centre
* Mitsukoshi department store
Yebisu Garden Place offers one of the most popular winter illumination events in Tokyo, holding it annually for over 20 years. The entrance pavilion, sloped promenade, and central square are decorated with about 100,000 gold LED lights. In the central square, a Baccarat crystal chandelier which has 8,500 crystal pieces and 250 lights is hung during the event. At 5 meters tall and 3 meters wide, it is one of the largest chandeliers in the world. Its creation required the work of 13 &quot;Meilleur Ouvrier de France&quot; (MOF) craftsmen. 

==Businesses==

The publication &quot;The Diplomat&quot; has its headquarters in the Ebisu MF Building.

==Education==
 operates public elementary and junior high schools.

Ebisu 4-chome, 1-chome 11-12, 20-26, and 32-35 ban, 2-chome 9-10 ban, and 3-chome 1, 4-42, 44, and 46-49-ban are zoned to Kakezuka Elementary School (加計塚小学校). Ebisu 1-chome 29-31 ban, 2-chome 1-8 ban and 11-39 ban, and 3-chome 2-3, 43, and 45-ban are zoned to Rinsen Elementary School (臨川小学校). Ebisu 1-chome 1-10, 13-19, and 27-28 ban are zoned to Hiroo Elementary School (広尾小学校). All of Ebisu (1-4 chome) is zoned to Hiroo Junior High School (広尾中学校).

<doc id="1044338" wikidata="Q5418630" url="?curid=1044338" title="Evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes">
<text>The evolution of Hawaiian volcanoes occurs in several stages of growth and decline. The fifteen volcanoes that make up the eight principal islands of Hawaii are the youngest in a chain of more than 129 volcanoes that stretch across the North Pacific Ocean, called the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. Hawaii&#x27;s volcanoes rise an average of to reach sea level from their base. The largest, Mauna Loa, is high. As shield volcanoes, they are built by accumulated lava flows, growing a few meters or feet at a time to form a broad and gently sloping shape.

Hawaiian islands undergo a systematic pattern of submarine and subaerial growth that is followed by erosion. An island&#x27;s stage of development reflects its distance from the Hawaii hotspot.

==Background==

The Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain is remarkable for its length and its number of volcanoes. The chain is split into two subsections across a break, separating the older Emperor Seamount Chain from the younger Hawaiian Ridge; the V-shaped bend of the chain is easily noticeable on maps. The volcanoes are progressively younger to the southeast; the oldest dated volcano, located at the northern end, is 81 million years old. The break between the two subchains is 43 million years old; in comparison, the oldest of the principal islands, Kauaʻi, is little more than 5 million years old.

The &quot;assembly line&quot; that forms the volcanoes is driven by a hotspot, a plume of magma deep within the Earth producing lava at the surface. As the Pacific Plate moves in a west-northwest direction, each volcano moves with it away from its place of origin above the hotspot. The age and location of the volcanoes are a record of the direction, rate of movement, and orientation of the Pacific Plate. The pronounced 43-million-year-old break separating the Hawaiian Ridge from the Emperor Chain marks a dramatic change in direction of plate movement.

Initial, deeper-water volcanic eruptions are characterized by pillow lava, so named for their shape, while shallow-water eruptions tend to be composed mainly of volcanic ash. Once the volcano is high enough so as to eliminate interference from water, its lava flows become those of ropey pāhoehoe and blocky ʻAʻā lava.

Our current understanding of the process of evolution originates from the first half of the 20th century. The understanding of the process was advanced by frequent observation of volcanic eruptions, study of contrasting rock types, and reconnaissance mapping. More recently our understanding has been aided by geophysical studies, offshore submersible studies, the advent of radioactive dating, advances in petrology and geochemistry, advanced surveillance and monitoring, and detailed geological studies. The ratio of magnesium to silica in the lava is a sign of what stage the volcano is in, as over time the volcano&#x27;s lavas shift from alkalic to tholeiitic lava, and then back to alkalic.

Although volcanism and erosion are the chief factors in the growth and denudation of a volcano, other factors are also involved. Subsidence is known to occur. Changes in sea level, occurring mostly during the Pleistocene, have caused drastic changes; an example is the breakup of Maui Nui, initially a seven-volcano island, which was transformed into five islands as a result of subsidence. High rainfall due to the trade wind effect impacts on the severity of erosion on many of the major volcanoes. Coastline collapses, a notable part of the history of many of the Hawaiian volcanoes, are often devastating and destroy large parts of the volcanoes.

==Submarine preshield stage==
When a volcano is created near the Hawaiian hotspot, it begins its growth in the submarine preshield stage, characterized by infrequent, typically low volume eruptions. The volcano is steep-sided, and it usually has a defined caldera and has two or more rift zones radiating from the summit. The type of lava erupted in this stage of activity is alkali basalt. Due to stretching forces, the development of two or more rift zones is common. The lava accumulates in a shallow magma storage reservoir.

Because the eruptions occur with the volcano underwater, the form of lava typically erupted is pillow lava. Pillow lava is rounded balls of lava that was given very little time to cool due to immediate exposure to water. Water pressure prevents the lava from exploding upon contact with the cold ocean water, forcing it to simmer and solidify quickly. This stage is thought to last about 200,000 years, but lavas erupted during this stage make up only a tiny fraction of the final volume of the volcano. As time progresses, eruptions become stronger and more frequent.

The only example of a Hawaiian volcano in this stage is Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount (formerly Lōʻihi), which is thought to be transitioning from the submarine preshield stage into the submarine phase of the shield stage. All older volcanoes have had their preshield stage lavas buried by younger lavas, so everything that is known about this stage comes from research done on Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount.

==Shield stages==
The shield stage of the volcano is subdivided into three phases: the submarine, explosive, and subaerial. During this stage of growth, the volcano accumulates about 95 percent of its mass and it takes on the &quot;shield&quot; shape that shield volcanoes are named for. It is also the stage at which the volcano&#x27;s eruptive frequency reaches its peak.

===Submarine phase===
As eruptions become more and more frequent at the end of the preshield stage, the composition of the lava erupted from the Hawaiian volcano changes from alkalic basalt to tholeiitic basalt and the volcano enters the submarine phase of the shield stage. In this phase, the volcano continues to erupt pillow lava. Calderas form, fill, and reform at the volcano&#x27;s summit and the rift zones remain prominent. The volcano builds its way up to sea level. The submarine phase ends when the volcano is only shallowly submerged.

The only example of a volcano in this stage is Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount, which is now transitioning into this phase from the preshield stage.

===Explosive phase===

This volcanic phase, so named for the explosive reactions with lava that take place, begins when the volcano just breaches the surface. The pressure and instantaneous cooling of being underwater stops, replaced instead by contact with air. Lava and seawater make intermittent contact, resulting in a lot of steam. The change in environment also engenders a change in lava type, and the lava from this stage is mostly fragmented into volcanic ash. These explosive eruptions continue intermittently for several hundred thousand years. Calderas continually develop and fill, and rift zones remain prominent. The phase ends when the volcano has sufficient mass and height (about above sea level) that the interaction between sea water and erupting lava fades away.

===Subaerial phase===
Once a volcano has added enough mass and height to end frequent contact with water, the subaerial substage begins. During this stage of activity, the explosive eruptions become much less frequent and the nature of the eruptions become much more gentle. Lava flows are a combination of pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā. It is during this stage, that the low-profile &quot;shield&quot; shape of Hawaiian volcanoes is formed, named for the shape of a warrior&#x27;s shield. Eruption rates and frequencies peak, and about 95% of the volcano&#x27;s eventual volume forms during a period of roughly 500,000 years.

The lava erupted in this stage form flows of pāhoehoe or ʻaʻā. During this subaerial stage, the flanks of the growing volcanoes are unstable and as a result, large landslides may occur. At least 17 major landslides have occurred around the major Hawaiian islands. This stage is arguably the most well-studied, as all eruptions that occurred in the 20th century on the island of Hawaii were produced by volcanoes in this phase.

Mauna Loa and Kīlauea volcanoes are in this phase of activity.

==Postshield stage==

As the volcano reaches the end of the shield stage, the volcano goes through another series of changes as it enters the postshield stage. The type of lava erupted changes from tholeiitic basalt back to alkalic basalt and eruptions become slightly more explosive.

Eruptions in the postshield stage cap the volcano with a carapace of lava, containing low silica and high alkali contents, the reverse of the stage before it. Some Hawaiian volcanoes diverge from this, however. Lava is erupted as stocky, pasty aā flows along with a lot of cinder. Caldera development stops, and the rift zones become less active. The new lava flows increase the slope grade, as the aā never reaches the base of the volcano. These lavas commonly fill and overflow the caldera. Eruption rate gradually decreases over a period of about 250,000 years, eventually stopping altogether as the volcano becomes dormant.

Mauna Kea, Hualālai, and Haleakalā volcanoes are in this stage of activity.

==Erosional stage==
After the volcano becomes dormant, the forces of erosion gain control of the mountain. The volcano subsides into the oceanic crust due to its immense weight and loses elevation. Meanwhile, rain also erodes the volcano, creating deeply incised valleys. Coral reefs grow along the shoreline. The volcano becomes a skeleton of its former self.

Kohala, Māhukona, Lānaʻi, and Waiʻanae volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development.

==Rejuvenated stage==
After a long period of dormancy and erosion of the surface, the volcano may become active again, entering a final stage of activity called the rejuvenated stage. During this stage, the volcano erupts small volumes of lava very infrequently. These eruptions are often spread out over several millions of years. The composition of the lavas erupted in this stage is usually alkalic. The stage commonly occurs between 0.6 and 2 million years after it has entered the weathering cycle.

The Koʻolau Range and West Maui volcanoes are examples of volcanoes in this stage of development. Note, however, that because in this stage eruptions are very infrequent (occurring thousands or even tens of thousands of years apart), erosion is still the primary factor controlling the volcano&#x27;s development. After this stage the volcano becomes extinct and never erupts again.

==Coral atoll stage==

Eventually, erosion and subsidence break the volcano down to sea level. At this point, the volcano becomes an atoll, with a ring of coral and sand islands surrounding a lagoon. All the Hawaiian islands west of the Gardner Pinnacles in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are in this stage.

Atolls are the product of the growth of tropical marine organisms, so this island type is only found in warm tropical waters. Eventually, the Pacific Plate carries the volcanic atoll into waters too cold for these marine organisms to maintain a coral reef by growth. Volcanic islands located beyond the warm water temperature requirements of reef-building organisms become seamounts as they subside and are eroded away at the surface. An island that is located where the ocean water temperatures are just sufficiently warm for upward reef growth to keep pace with the rate of subsidence is said to be at the Darwin point. Islands in more northerly latitudes evolve towards seamounts or guyots; islands closer to the equator evolve towards atolls (see Kure Atoll).

==Guyot stage and destruction phase==
After the reef dies, the volcano subsides or erodes below sea level and becomes a coral-capped seamount. These flat-topped seamounts are called guyots. Most, if not all, of the volcanoes west of Kure Atoll, as well as most, if not all, of the volcanoes in the Emperor Seamount chain, are guyots or seamounts. Eventually the guyot will be taken to a subduction plate where it will be destroyed like Meiji Seamount in a few million years.

==Other patterns==
Not all Hawaiian volcanoes go through all of these stages of activity. An example is Koʻolau Range on Oʻahu, which was prehistorically devastated by a cataclysmic landslide, never underwent the postshield stage and went dormant for hundreds of thousands of years after the shield stage before coming back to life. Some volcanoes never made it above sea level; there is no evidence to suggest that West Molokai went through the rejuvenated stage, while its younger neighbors, East Molokai and West Maui, have evidently done so. It is currently unknown what stage of development the submerged volcano of Penguin Bank is in.

==Application to other groups==
In recent years research at other seamounts, for instance Jasper Seamount (off the west coast of Mexico), has confirmed that the Hawaiian model applies to other seamounts as well.

<doc id="1044354" wikidata="Q1747431" url="?curid=1044354" title="Scary Go Round">
<text>Scary Go Round is a webcomic by John Allison. Running from 2002 to 2009, it is set in the fictional North Yorkshire town of Tackleford and follows university students battling fantasy and science fiction threats to the town. The comic was a successor to Allison&#x27;s first comic, &quot;Bobbins&quot;, and was followed by &quot;Bad Machinery&quot;, all of which take place in the same general setting.

The comic received praise from multiple British newspapers, and it won the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Award for best comic in 2005. 

== History ==
&quot;Scary Go Round&quot; began in 2002. It followed on from Allison&#x27;s first webcomic, &quot;Bobbins&quot;, and features many of the same characters. According to Allison, &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; was originally intended to run at the same time as &quot;Bobbins&quot;, but Allison said that he ended &quot;Bobbins&quot; for several reasons: to leave Keenspot, to focus on &quot;Scary Go Round&quot;, and because &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; was a &quot;clean slate&quot; to write compared to &quot;Bobbins&quot; which he called &quot;a big mess&quot;. By contrast, &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; was intended from the start to be a work that could be printed in book form.

&quot;Scary Go Round&quot; first appeared on Modern Tales, but Allison said that joining the service was &quot;a straight out mistake&quot; and by 2003 had moved &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; off Modern Tales and onto its own website. In an interview in 2004, Allison said that &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; made up the majority of his income; and in a later interview he said it was &quot;his living&quot;.

&quot;Scary Go Round&quot; was created in vector graphics program Adobe Illustrator, as opposed to earlier comics by Allison which he drew by hand on paper.

&quot;Scary Go Round&quot; ended in 2009. Allison said that he felt is work was becoming uninspired: &quot;I had a lot of characters that I didn&#x27;t care about, and I was making whole runs of strips about characters that people didn&#x27;t really like... Seven and a half years is a long time and I had lost perspective and direction. I was also losing readers for the last year and it was evident that changes had to be made.&quot; &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; was succeeded in the same year by &quot;Bad Machinery&quot;, another webcomic in the same setting focusing on younger characters. &quot;Bad Machinery&quot; was initially published on the scarygoround.com site.

Allison has also used the term &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; to refer generally to his works that are connected to the same setting. As of 2021, the scarygoround.com site no longer hosts the &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; comics; instead the main page links to the various comics produced by Allison as well as to a site where PDFs of &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; can be purchased.

== Premise ==
The characters in &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; are a group of students at Tackleford University. The city of Tackleford, a fictional town in North Yorkshire, constantly finds itself under attack by superhero-comic-style threats such as samurai, werewolves, giant robots, dimensional doorways, Bible-thumping witches, shy zombies and polite biker gangs.

The comic initially followed the lives of the barmaids Tessa Davies and Rachel Dukakis-Monteforte, but soon changed focus to another set of characters entirely, including Amy Chilton and Shelley Winters.

=== Characters ===
; Adults

* Shelley Winters: Daft and whimsical, Shelley is the unofficial protagonist of &quot;Scary Go Round&quot;. She is ranked No. 4 in the country for being disaster-prone, even dying on more than one occasion, and has a deep love for jam. Over the course of the strip she has held many jobs, ranging from mayor&#x27;s assistant to newspaper reporter to a waitress. The final SGR strip shows her leaving for London and a job with the Ministry of History.
* Amy Chilton: Tattooed, pink-haired friend of Shelley and daughter of journalism professor Len Pickering. Amy began the strip as a spoiled art student but has since become the most level-headed and successful of the main adult characters. She continues in &quot;Bad Machinery&quot; as Amy Beckwith-Chilton, married to Ryan Beckwith.
* Ryan Beckwith: Aimless, good-natured friend of Amy and Shelley, given to buffoonish musings and Americanisms. He continues in &quot;Bad Machinery&quot;, married to Amy Chilton.
* Tim Jones: This suave genius inventor was for many years the anchor of the cast: older brother figure to Shelley and Ryan, crush object of Amy, mentor to The Boy, and mayor of the town. He was exiled to Wales in 2006 and didn&#x27;t appear again during the comic&#x27;s run.
* Riley Beckwith: Ryan&#x27;s sister and Tim&#x27;s wife, Riley&#x27;s low opinion of the main cast led her to concoct a successful scheme to remove herself and Tim from the other characters&#x27; orbit. She&#x27;s a dedicated believer in aliens.
* Tessa and Rachel: These two barmaids were the original protagonists of &quot;Scary Go Round&quot;, but as the current cast came to dominate the proceedings, they first became villains and then were dispensed with (in Rachel&#x27;s case, via immolation).
* Gibbous Moon: A recurring character, a marine biologist and short-term love interest for Ryan, first introduced interning on an evil island, repenting after leaving with Shelley. Written out when revealed to be running an underground smuggling ring, and sent to jail.

; Teenagers

* Eustace Boyce, aka &quot;The Boy&quot;: Nebbishy former assistant to one-time major character Tim Jones, The Boy and his girlfriend Dark Esther (see below) serve as protagonists of the story arcs that focus on the teenage cast. Lost his virginity to Esther de Groot in a caravan in Wales.
* Esther de Groot, aka &quot;Dark Esther&quot;: Adolescent goth. Lost her virginity to The Boy in a caravan in Wales, before they became a couple which would last until the end of the series. Esther would go on to be the principal character in Allison&#x27;s later series &quot;Giant Days&quot;, centred around her time at university.
* Erin Winters: Shelley&#x27;s intelligent, sensible, serious sister. Erin was put under a spell by villain Bob Crowley that led her to follow him into a bleak hell dimension from which the creator of &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; asserts she will not return. As of the new comic Bad Machinery it appears she has returned as a newspaper journalist, at least temporarily.

== Reception ==
Writing for The Sunday Times in 2006, Danny O&#x27;Brien called &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; one of the &quot;coolest strips online&quot;, describing it as &quot;postmodern British Horror&quot; which was &quot;subtle and stylishly drawn, with a bold cartoon edge&quot;. O&#x27;Brien said that the comic &quot;reek[s] of cool Britannia&quot; and that the dialogue &quot;ma[de] a pleasant change from the nonstop Americana of most comics&quot;.

Also in 2006, James Eagle wrote for the British newspaper Morning Star that &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; was &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;bonkers&quot;, and &quot;the best British strip that I&#x27;ve yet found&quot;.

Writing for Wizard magazine in 2006, Brian Warmoth said that &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; &quot;stitches a world of frightfully bizarre and at times even Lovecraftian happenings together with a brilliantly quirky cast indicative of his understatedly British sense of humor.&quot;

Michael Whitney reviewed &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; in 2004 for the blog &quot;The Webcomics Examiner&quot;. Whitney said that compared to vector art used in &quot;Bobbins,&quot; &quot;The paper dolls loosened up. The figures were squashed and stretched to make them feel more natural.&quot; Whitney said that &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; &quot;decoupled&quot; the &quot;Bobbins&quot; characters from gag humor, relationship obsession and reality: &quot;They meander into stories full of zombies, witches and inter-dimensional doorways.&quot; Whitney added that despite the horror elements of the setting, &quot;the characters take their circumstances too well to let us feel that they&#x27;re facing a genuine threat in a horror story sense... The tone is too silly for genuinely dire consequences, which may be why Allison fielded some angry response when he killed off a popular character, Shelley, early in the strip.&quot; (Shelley would return to life in a later storyline.)

=== Awards ===
&quot;Scary Go Round&quot; won the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Award for Outstanding Comic in 2005. It also won Outstanding Original Digital Art in 2003 and jointly won Outstanding Art in 2004 (tied with &quot;Mac Hall&quot;), and was nominated for a further 18 awards over the WCCA&#x27;s history.

<doc id="1044367" wikidata="Q2429871" url="?curid=1044367" title="Shah-Ali">
<text>Shah-Ali (Volga Türki and Persian: شاه علی, or Shahghali; ; ; also known as Shig-Aley; ; 1505–1567) was a khan of the Qasim Khanate and the Khanate of Kazan. He ruled the Qasim Khanate for much of his life and three times tried to rule the Khanate of Kazan, which was independent until its conquest by Muscovy in 1552. He also ruled the town of Kasimov as a vassal of the Russians. He was the son of the Qasim Khan Sheikh Auliyar (reigned 1512–16) and grandson of Bakhtiar Sultan, a brother of Ahmed Khan bin Küchük (the Golden Horde ruler who lost control of Russia). One of his wives was the unfortunate Söyembikä of Kazan. He died childless in 1567 and was succeeded by Sain Bulat. He is described as physically repulsive and too fat to be a soldier, but a man of sound judgement. Shah-Ali was a direct descendant of Jochi Khan, the eldest son of Genghis Khan.

== Biography ==

Shahghali came to the throne in 1516 at age 11 upon his father’s death. There is little information about this period. When he moved to Kazan his brother Jan Ali became khan of Kasimov.

1519–21: First Kazan. The house of Ulugh Mohammad having died out, there was talk of bringing in someone from the Crimean Khanate, but Russia managed to impose their vassal Shahghali. He was disliked as a Russian vassal and his violence toward his opponents only made things worse. An embassy went to Crimea and brought back Sahib I Giray (reigned 1521–25), the brother of Crimean khan Mehmed I Giray. He entered Kazan with no difficulty and Shahghali was arrested. Shahghali was soon released, but given few provisions and had difficulty making his way to Russian territory.

1521–47: Russian exile: When Shahghali reached Russia he was kept in honorable exile and his brother Jan Ali retained Kasimov. Sigismund von Herberstein met him in 1526. In 1533 he was accused of intrigue with Kazan and exiled to Belozersk and released in 1535. 

1537–46: Second Kasimov: There is little documentation for this period. 

1546: Second Kazan: in 1546 Russia defeated Kazan, khan Safa Girai fled, and the peace party accepted Shahghali as khan. He arrived with 3000 Kasimov troops and several Russian princes. Within a few weeks his troops were massacred and it was clear that he was a prisoner in his own palace, although there was no attempt to dethrone him. After some weeks of this he held a banquet, got everyone drunk and slipped out of the palace before anyone knew he was gone. The man who helped him escape was executed.

1546–51 Third Kasimov: Shahghali returned to Kasimov and in 1547-51 was involved in several attacks on Kazan.

1551–52 Third Kazan: Now greatly weakened, Kazan accepted Shahghali as khan. The previous Khan&#x27;s widow (Soyembika) and her son were turned over to the Russians and thousands of Russian captives were released. The people would not accept their near-conquest and he could not manage the conflict between his position as both a Russian vassal and ruler of an independent khanate. He killed some three thousand of his opponents, but this made things worse. Russia sent an ambassador suggesting that Russian troops enter the town to restore order, but he refused to surrender his city to unbelievers. A second embassy demanded his deposition. Instead he fled the town for a third time and returned to Kasimov. 

1552–67 Fourth Kasimov. Shahghali took part in the final Russian conquest of Kazan in 1552. He was visited by Anthony Jenkinson in 1558. 

In 1559 he participated in the Livonian War as commander of the Russian avant-garde, and besieged Narva and Pärnu. 

In 1562 he defended Polock and in 1564-1565 defended Velikie Luki on the Russian border. He died childless in 1567.

<text>Kasimov (; ;, Ханкирмән Latinized : Kasıym, Hankirmən, historically Gorodets Meshchyorsky, Novy Nizovoy) is a town in Ryazan Oblast, Russia, located on the left bank of the Oka River. Population: 17,000 (1910).

==History==
The first population of this area was a Finnic tribe called the Meshchyora, later assimilated by Russians and Tatars. The town was founded in 1152 by the Vladimir-Suzdal ruler Yuri Dolgorukiy as Grodets, then Gorodets Meschyorsky (). It was included in the Mishar Yurt division of the Golden Horde, but then was sold to Muscovy.

In 1376, the town was destroyed by the Mongols, but was soon rebuilt as &quot;Novy Nizovoy&quot; (). After the Battle of Suzdal in 1445 (in which Grand Duke Vasily II was taken prisoner), the Meschyora lands were given to Oluğ Möxämmäd, Khan of Kazan Khanate as a ransom for the sovereign&#x27;s life.

In 1452, Great Duke Vasily II of the Grand Duchy of Moscow gave this town to Kazan prince Qasim Khan, who served as &quot;tribute inspector&quot; of the Great Horde, but then came to Russian service. By other accounts, Qasim and his brother Yosif fled from Kazan after losing their bid for the throne against their brother Mäxmüd. After 1471, the town was known as &quot;Qasím city&quot;. It remained the capital of Qasim Khanate until 1681 when the khanate was absorbed into Russia.

A group of Tatars settled there in 15th century and are now known as Qasim Tatars. They speak the Mishar dialect, mixed with the Middle Tatar dialect of the Tatar language. In the 19th century, it became known for its waiters, who staffed many of the St Petersburg hotels.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kasimov serves as the administrative center of Kasimovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Kasimov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Kasimov is incorporated as Kasimov Urban Okrug.

==Layout and landmarks==


In the 17th century, the town was separated into three parts:
*Old Town (Russian: Старый Посад; Tatar: &quot;İske Bistä&quot;) and Tatar Town (Russian: Татарская слобода; Tatar: &quot;Tatar Bistäse&quot;) regulated by khan of Qasim Khanate and Tatar noblemen;
*&quot;Yamskoy Town&quot; (Russian: Ямская слобода) of Russian commoners, regulated by Moscow;
*&quot;Marfin Town&quot; (Russian: Марфина слобода, Tatar: &quot;Marfin Bistäse&quot;) – part of the city, regulated by Kasimov voyevodas.

Historical buildings:
*Khan&#x27;s Mosque (with a limestone minaret from either 1467 or the 1550s)
*Mausoleum of Shahghali (Şahğäli) Khan (1555)
*Mausoleum of Afghan Moxammad (Äfğan Möxämmäd) Khan (1658)
*Russian Orthodox churches:
**Church of the Epiphany () 17th century;
**St. Nicholas Church () 17th century;
**Trinity Church () 17th century;
**Cathedral of the Ascension () 19th century.

<doc id="1044391" wikidata="Q5000707" url="?curid=1044391" title="Burt Hooton">
<text>Burt Carlton Hooton (born February 7, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Happy&quot;, is an American former right-handed starting pitcher and former coach in Major League Baseball. He won 151 games over a 15-year career, mostly with the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers.

Hooton&#x27;s career began auspiciously with a no-hitter in his fourth major league game for the Cubs, and perhaps gained his widest recognition for his several playoff performances with the Dodgers. His only All-Star appearance was in 1981, when he also was named the NLCS Most Valuable Player on the way to helping the Dodgers to a World Series championship with four postseason wins in five appearances.

He was pitching coach of the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the Class-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres from 2013 to 2019.

==Playing career==

===High school===
Hooton attended Richard King High School in Corpus Christi, Texas, leading the Mustangs to a 4A State Championship in the school&#x27;s second year of operation in 1967. Hooton graduated from King in 1968.

===College===
Hooton attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he had a College Hall of Fame career, was a three-time All-American from 1969–71 and set several school and conference records. He also made the Southwest All-Conference team three times and was the team MVP in 1971. He posted a 35–3 record including two no-hitters within weeks of each other in 1971, one of which was a perfect game for 8 innings of a scheduled 7 inning game.

He played in the NCAA Tournament all three years, making it to the College World Series in 1969 and 1970. In 1969, the Longhorns came in 4th and Hooton made the All-Tournament team, and in 1970, the Longhorns came in 3rd. The Longhorns won conference championships all three years he was on the team.

Pitching for the Boulder Collegians in the summer of 1969, Burt started and won the 64th Midnight Sun Game, which was hosted by the Alaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks.

He was inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1981. In 1998 he was admitted to the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame and in 2008 to the College Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2009, his number (#20) was retired by the Longhorns.

===Chicago Cubs===
After college, Hooton was selected by the Cubs with the second pick of the 1971 amateur draft. He made his major league debut with the team on June 17 of that year, but appeared in only three games before the end of the season, striking out 15 batters in one of them. He was the third player to go straight to the Major Leagues after being drafted without spending a day in the minors. He began 1972 in outstanding fashion, pitching a 4–0 no-hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies at Wrigley Field on April 16, the second day of the strike-delayed season. But he was unable to win consistently as the team&#x27;s fortunes declined in the early 1970s, and he was traded to Los Angeles in May 1975 after compiling a 34–44 record with a steadily increasing earned run average.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
The Dodgers were headed in the opposite direction from the Cubs, and Hooton was 18–7 with a 2.82 ERA over the remainder of the year, winning his last 12 decisions for a team record. After a disappointing 1976 season, he used his strong knuckle curve to become a valuable member of the pennant-winning teams of the next two years, leading the staff with 153 strikeouts in 1977 and with 19 wins and a 2.71 ERA in 1978. He finished second to Gaylord Perry in the 1978 Cy Young Award voting. Also in 1978, he finished 15th in Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award voting.

Hooton started Game 3 of the 1977 NLCS against the Phillies, but was pulled after issuing three consecutive bases-loaded walks in the second inning; the Dodgers came back to win, 6–5. In the World Series against the New York Yankees, he pitched a 6–1 victory in Game 2, allowing only five singles and retiring 14 of the last 15 hitters to tie the Series at one game each. But in Game 6, he left in the fourth inning with the Dodgers behind, 4–3, after giving up a 2-run home run to Reggie Jackson—Jackson&#x27;s first of three in the game, all on the first pitch. The Yankees won 8–4, taking the Series in six games. The 1978 playoffs were rematches; in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Phillies, Hooton left after allowing three runs in the fifth inning, although the Dodgers still led, 7–4, and went on to win the game. In the Series rematch with the Yankees he won Game 2, leaving in the seventh inning with a 4–2 lead as Los Angeles held on for a 4–3 win to take a 2–0 Series edge. But Game 5 was another crushing defeat as Hooton was yanked after allowing four runs in the third inning for a 4–2 Yankee lead, with New York romping to a 12–2 blowout and their third straight win. The Yankees won again two days later for their second consecutive title.

After solid but unspectacular years in 1979 and 1980, Hooton enjoyed an 11–6 campaign in the strike-shortened 1981 season, posting a career-best 2.28 ERA and being named to his only All-Star team. He began the playoffs with a win against the Houston Astros in Game 3 of the Division Series, allowing only three hits, including an Art Howe solo homer, through seven innings. After the Dodgers won the series in five games, they went on to face the Montreal Expos in the NLCS; Hooton won Game 1, allowing only six hits before leaving in the eighth inning with a 2–0 lead. Returning in Game 4 with the Dodgers behind two games to one, he allowed only five hits and one unearned run before leaving in the eighth inning with a 3–1 lead; the Dodgers went on to a 7–1 win, and won Game 5 to advance to the World Series, again meeting the Yankees. Hooton was named the NLCS MVP for his two wins and perfect 0.00 ERA. He started Game 2 of the World Series, but took a tough loss after leaving the game in the seventh inning, behind 1–0 on an unearned run; the Yankees went on to win 3–0 behind the pitching of his former Dodger teammate Tommy John. But he came back with another strong outing in Game 6, leaving with an 8–1 lead in the sixth inning as the Dodgers won 9–2, taking their first World Series title since 1965. Because of his unassuming nature, broadcaster Vin Scully said that to celebrate, Hooton would probably go out and &quot;paint the town beige.&quot; Hooton remained with the Dodgers for three more years, but with a combined record of just 16–21; he spent most of 1984 in the bullpen.

===Texas Rangers===
Hooton played his last season in 1985 for the Texas Rangers after signing with them as a free agent, going 5–8.

==Coaching==
Hooton returned to the University of Texas to earn his degree in journalism and then began a career as a pitching coach. He first worked in the Dodgers organization in 1988 with the Class A Salem (Oregon) Dodgers. He moved up to the pitching coach of the Double-A San Antonio Missions from 1990 to 1994 and then in 1995–96 with the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes. He returned to the University of Texas again, as the pitching coach from 1997 to 1999. In 2000 started the season as the pitching coach at Double-A Round Rock, a Houston Astros affiliate, before being named pitching coach of the major league club midway through the season where he stayed until mid-season 2004 when manager Jimy Williams was fired. Nonetheless, one of the pitchers he coached, fellow Longhorn Roger Clemens, won the Cy Young Award that season. In 2005, he returned to Round Rock as pitching coach until 2010, when the team moved to Oklahoma City, where he worked in the same position through the end of the 2012 season. In 2013, he was hired as the pitching coach for the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the Class-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.

<text>The United Arab Emirates national football team () represents United Arab Emirates in international football and serves under the auspices of the country&#x27;s Football Association.

It has made one World Cup appearance in 1990 in Italy and lost all three of its games. United Arab Emirates took fourth place in the 1992 AFC Asian Cup and runner-up in 1996 as host. It won the Arabian Gulf Cup in 2007 and 2013. It finished third in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup and hosted the 2019 edition in which it was eliminated in the semi-finals.

==History==
The first match of the team was played on 17 March 1972 against Qatar at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and won with the only goal scored by Ahmed Chowbi. Then, the team faced three other Arabian countries, losing 4–0 and 7–0 to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait respectively and beating Bahrain 3 to nothing. After participating in four Gulf Cup tournaments since 1972, United Arab Emirates (UAE) hosted the 1982 edition. It again finished third as did in the two previous tournaments.

In 1980, United Arab Emirates first-time qualified for the AFC Asian Cup which was held in Kuwait and were drawn with eventual winners, Kuwait, runner-up South Korea, Malaysia and Qatar in Group B. It drew 1–1 with Kuwait and lost the three other matches and finished in fifth place in the group and ninth (out of ten teams) overall. It also qualified for the next two tournaments, 1984 in Singapore and 1988 in Qatar and was again eliminated in the group stages in both. Its first victory of the tournament occurred against India on 7 December 1984, under manager Heshmat Mohajerani.

In 1984, Mohajerani resigned and was replaced with Carlos Alberto Parreira. Parreira led the team at the 1988 Asian Cup and left his position after the tournament. He was succeeded by Mário Zagallo. Zagallo led the team to the qualification for the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy. However, Zagallo resigned before the tournament and Parreira returned. The team finished fourth at the 1990 World Cup&#x27;s final tournament with no points, scoring two goals and conceding 11 goals. The journey was put into a 2016 documentary titled &quot;Lights of Rome&quot;. After the tournament, Parreira was sacked.

At the 1992 and 1996 AFC Asian Cups, United Arab Emirates finished fourth and second respectively for the first times. United Arab Emirates appeared in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup after being awarded a spot because Saudi Arabia was hosting the games.

United Arab Emirates missed the qualification for the 2000 AFC Asian Cup in Lebanon and finished in last place at the 2002 Arabian Gulf Cup in Saudi Arabia. It was eliminated in the next three Asian Cup tournaments at the group stage. In 2004 and 2007 editions, UAE was all eliminated by the hand to debutants Jordan and Vietnam. In 2011, it finished the tournament goalless. At this time, United Arab Emirates appointed world class coaches like Carlos Queiroz, Roy Hodgson and Dick Advocaat. In 2006, UAE appointed Bruno Metsu as the new manager. He led the Emirates to carry the 2007 Arabian Gulf Cup title.

After hiring foreign coaches, in 2012, United Arab Emirates appointed the Olympic team coach Mahdi Ali as the manager of the senior team. Ali began creating a squad inviting players that he had worked with at the youth level. He led the Emirates to their second Arabian Gulf Cup title in 2013. At the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, United Arab Emirates defeated Qatar 4–1 and Bahrain 2–1 and lost to Iran by a goal. As group runner-up, it faced the defending champions Japan in the quarter-final and earned a victory on penalties to advance to the last four. In the semi-finals, it lost 2–0 to the host Australia. In the third-place play-off, it beat Iraq 3–2. United Arab Emirates qualified through the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification where it finished fourth in Group B thus failing to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Ahmed Khalil was a top scorer in the qualification. Around this time Mahdi Ali resigned from his position.

United Arab Emirates then hosted the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, this marked the second time they hosted an AFC Asian Cup. The team had Italian Alberto Zaccheroni as their coach. In the AFC Asian Cup tournament, UAE proceeded to the quarter-finals where it scored its first-ever goal against Australia to gain its first-ever win against this opponent. The semi-finals was between the host and Qatar. Some audiences threw footwear in the pitch after Qatar scored its second goal. UAE lost 0–4 marking its first defeat to Qatar since 2001.

United Arab Emirates joined the second round of 2022 World Cup qualifiers and was placed with all-out Southeast Asian opponents. The team had already appointed the Dutch guider Bert van Marwijk. Bert was sacked after his start undergoing two away losses to Thailand and Vietnam in the qualifiers along his group stage exit in the 24th Arabian Gulf Cup. After this, the Emirates decided to naturalize Argentine Sebastián Tagliabúe, Brazilian Caio Canedo Corrêa and Fábio Virginio de Lima, the three South American players, having never done so since the foundation of the national team. The team then experienced a period of coaching instabilities, with three different coaches, before van Marwijk resumed his duty due to crisis in option. With the COVID-19 pandemic however, the AFC decided the remaining games of the second round would be played in one country, and with the UAE chosen to host Group G, they were able to utilize the home-field advantage as the host nation, ultimately u-turned the earlier misery into four consecutive wins to break through into the third round, where they faced its neighbours and the powerhouses Iran and South Korea. In the third round, the UAE failed to produce a promising performance after winning just one out of six first games, a 1–0 away win over Lebanon, drew three and lost two, adding with the UAE&#x27;s below average performance in the 2021 FIFA Arab Cup despite reaching the quarter-finals, that was enough to sack the Dutch manager van Marwijk yet again. After inconsistency in performance, the UAE appointed Argentine manager Rodolfo Arruabarrena as coach, and the team&#x27;s result improved, winning two out of four games, notably an impressive 1–0 home win over already-qualified South Korea, to reach the fourth round, increased hope for the country to qualify for the first-ever World Cup since 1990, where they would face the old foe Australia, whom the UAE defeated in the latest meeting. However, the UAE was unable to utilise their geographical advantage in the playoff in neighbouring Qatar, losing 1–2 to Australia by a thunderous strike at 84&#x27; by Ajdin Hrustic to deny the UAE&#x27;s its potential second appearance; they later stunned South America&#x27;s rising power Peru to qualify for the edition.

==Rivalries==
UAE&#x27;s common rivals are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, and Iran.

===Qatar===
The rivalry with Qatar is a competitive one in the Arabian Gulf Cup meeting in multiple occasions, due to Qatar diplomatic crisis, increasing tensions had been witnessed, with the captain of UAE under-19 youth team refused to shake hands with Qatar&#x27;s youth captain in 2018 AFC U-19 Championship held in Indonesia; in this tournament, the UAE beat Qatar 2–1 but still crashed out from the group stage while Qatar would recover to qualify for the 2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup. As of 2020, Qatar and UAE have played 31 official matches, most of which was held competitively in the Arabian Gulf Cup, it started off with the United Arab Emirates beating Qatar 1–0. They only played 2 friendly games and the last friendly was held in 2011 which ended with an Emirati victory. In the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, hosted by the UAE, Qatar overran the UAE for the first time since 2001 with the result 4–0, with heavy tensions and violence occurred between two and Emirati supporters cheering anti-Qatari chants.

===Saudi Arabia===
Another major rival the UAE takes on Arabian Gulf Cup many times, the two teams have met in the AFC Asian Cup twice, first in the semi-finals of the 1992 edition which ended in a Saudi victory and second in the final of the 1996 edition in which UAE hosted, the game ended in a goalless draw which meant the game had to be decided in penalties, the game ended with Saudi Arabia taking home their 3rd title with the penalty scoreline being 4–2, this remains the only time the Emirates qualified for the final meanwhile this would also be the last time the Saudis would win an Asian Cup as they would lose the next two finals they qualified for in 2000 and 2007. When the countries meet in qualifier matches, the matchup has been nicknamed &quot;clash of titans&quot; as both countries have been some of the more successful teams in the Arabian Peninsula.

==Team image==

This was the indirect result of vandalism of the Wikipedia article on the team, and the AFC was forced to apologise.

<doc id="1044412" wikidata="Q6649926" url="?curid=1044412" title="Little Englander">
<text>The Little Englanders were a British political movement who opposed empire-building and advocated complete independence for Britain&#x27;s existing colonies. The ideas of Little Englandism first began to gain popularity in the late 18th century after the loss of the American colonies, but later came to be strongly associated as a reference to members of the Liberal Party who opposed further expansion of the British Empire. The term &quot;Little Englander&quot; itself was first recorded in 1833, and was usually derogatory.

Since the 2010s, especially after the 2016 Brexit referendum, the term has become a popular derogatory epithet for an English chauvinist who mistrusts the European Union, international cooperation, and foreigners in general. &quot;Gammon&quot; has been used similarly in British political culture since 2012.

==History==
The original Little England movement originated among manufacturers in Manchester and found support among journalists such as Goldwin Smith. The movement objected to the protectionist stance of British Canada, which was exemplified by the tariff increase of 1859. The English manufacturers resented paying taxes to defend a colony that imported few British goods, but exported so many to England. Moreover, it was believed that the United States could become a much more important partner, as it was already Britain&#x27;s best customer outside Europe. There was also a social element to the movement. The Manchester School opposed the Empire for providing sinecures for the idle sons of the aristocracy at the expense of productive industrialists at home. The Little England stance was adopted by a wing of the Liberal Party typified by William Gladstone (1809–1898), who opposed many of Britain&#x27;s military ventures in the late 19th century. It is particularly associated with opposition to the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Arthur Ponsonby wrote of the Liberal leader Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s opposition to the Boer War: &quot;The impression one got of him from the Press in those days was … that he was an unpatriotic Little Englander&quot;.

==In literature==
The term &quot;little England&quot; predates its political usage; the expression &quot;this little England&quot; was used in the Gunpowder Day sermon of the English Puritan preacher Thomas Hooker (5 November 1626). It is also used in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (1601), when the Old Lady tells Anne Boleyn: &quot;In faith, for little England / You&#x27;d venture an ing: / I myself would for Carnarvonshire.&quot;

==Contemporary usage==
The Cambridge online dictionary defines &quot;Little Englander&quot; as &quot;an English person who thinks England is better than all other countries, and that England should only work together with other countries when there is an advantage for England in doing so&quot;. The term has been used as a derogatory term for English nationalists and British people who are xenophobic or overly nationalistic. It has also been applied to opponents of globalism, multilateralism, and internationalism. Since the 2010s, especially post-Brexit, the term has gained popularity as a derogatory way to describe supporters of English nationalism and xenophobia. For this reason, it is similar to the insult &quot;gammon&quot;, which has been used in British political culture since 2012.

<doc id="1044419" wikidata="Q168675" url="?curid=1044419" title="Francois Pienaar">
<text>Jacobus Francois Pienaar (born 2 January 1967) is a retired South African rugby union player. He played flanker for South Africa (the Springboks) from 1993 until 1996, winning 29 international caps, all of them as captain. He is best known for leading South Africa to victory in the 1995 Rugby World Cup. After being dropped from the Springbok team in 1996, Pienaar went on to a career with English club Saracens.

== Early life and education==
Pienaar was born in Vereeniging, South Africa, into a working class Afrikaner family, and is the eldest of four boys. After completing high school at Hoërskool Patriot Witbank, he won an athletic scholarship to the Rand Afrikaans University, where he studied law.

== Playing career ==
He made his provincial debut for Transvaal Province in 1989 before being selected for the South Africa squad in 1993. He was appointed Springbok captain from his first test and remained captain until his last, and remains one of the most successful South African captains of all time.

In 1993 Transvaal won the Super 10, Currie Cup and Lion Cup under Pienaar. In 1994, Transvaal retained the Currie Cup under his captaincy and he was voted international player of the year by Rugby World magazine.

===1995 World Cup===

Pienaar is most famous for being captain of the first South African team to win the World Cup. Prior to the World Cup in 1995, the Springboks were only seeded ninth and were not expected to dethrone the incumbent champions Australia, who had not lost a game in the preceding 12 months.

During the tournament, South Africa defeated Australia, Romania, Canada, Western Samoa, and France. They then met New Zealand in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final at Ellis Park Stadium. Pienaar led the Springboks to a three-point victory with a drop goal from Joel Stransky.

During the remarkable post-match presentation ceremony Nelson Mandela, wearing a Springbok jersey bearing Pienaar&#x27;s number, presented him with the Webb Ellis Cup. During his acceptance speech, Pienaar made it clear that the team had won the trophy not just for the 60,000 fans at Ellis Park, but also for all 43,000,000 South Africans.

Pienaar is portrayed by Matt Damon in the film &quot;Invictus&quot;, released in December 2009, which focuses on the story of the 1995 World Cup.

===Later career===
Within a month of the World Cup&#x27;s conclusion Pienaar had a stand-off with SARFU after he led South African players in threatening to join their Australia and New Zealand counterparts to play professionally for the World Rugby Corporation (WRC). Pienaar had convinced numerous Springbok players to sign with the WRC, but Louis Luyt eventually dissuaded them from breaking with the SARFU. During this standoff, Pienaar offered the black Springbok player Chester Williams less than other contemporary South African players. In purely marketing terms, Williams was second only to Jonah Lomu.

Subsequently, Springbok players were given contracts and the International Rugby Board (IRB) voted in favour of professionalisation. Pienaar was instrumental in negotiating the deal between SANZAR and Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation that turned rugby into a fully-fledged professional game. Some of the older generation rugby administrators branded him a traitor for selling out South African rugby to professionalism.

In 1996, Pienaar was controversially dropped from the Springbok side, after 29 caps, by coach Andre Markgraaff, who accused him of feigning an injury during a match.

Pienaar subsequently left for Britain, where he became player-coach for Watford-based club Saracens. Under his leadership, they defeated the London Wasps to win the Pilkington Cup and also finished second in the Zurich Premiership. During the next two seasons, they secured third and fourth spots in the Zurich Premiership, thereby qualifying for the European Cup on consecutive campaigns.

Pienaar captained the Barbarians in his only appearance for the club against Leicester at Twickenham in 1999.

=== Test history ===
 World Cup Final
==Retirement==
In 2000, Pienaar retired as a player and became Saracens’ CEO. As a consequence of the club&#x27;s lack of success during the two following years, Pienaar stepped down as coach and CEO in 2002. Pienaar is one of 5 directors of Saracens as of 11/23.

In 2002 he returned to Cape Town, South Africa, where he lives with his wife Nerine Winter and two sons. Both had Nelson Mandela as a godfather.

Pienaar wrote his autobiography &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; with Edward Griffiths in 1999. In November 2000, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Hertfordshire.

Pienaar was also involved in South Africa&#x27;s failed bid to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup in 2005.

He was a pundit for ITV Sport during the Rugby World Cups of 2007, 2011 and 2015.

==Depictions in media==
Pienaar and Mandela are the subject of a 2008 book by John Carlin, &quot;Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation&quot;, that spotlights the role of the 1995 Cup win in post-apartheid South Africa. Carlin sold the film rights to Morgan Freeman. The 2009 film &quot;Invictus&quot;, based on the book, was directed by Clint Eastwood, and starred Morgan Freeman as Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon as Pienaar.

==Awards and honours==
*In 1995 he was voted Rugby Personality of the Year by Britain&#x27;s Rugby Union Writers&#x27; Club, as well as Newsmaker of the Year in South Africa.
*In 2004 he was voted 50th in the Top 100 Great South Africans.
*In 2005 he was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame.
* On 24 October 2011, he was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame.

<text>Ver-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Ver on Sea&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department and Normandy region of north-western France. It is situated at the eastern end of Gold Beach between Arromanches and Courseulles. The town lies 20 km north-west of Caen and 14 km north-east of Bayeux.
As well as its beach, the village has a bakery, pony club, sailing club, shrimp fishery, small supermarket, tennis court, and youth hostel. It is also home to the America Gold Beach Museum. Ver-sur-Mer lighthouse, still active today, was built in 1908 on the heights above the beach. During World War II, Canadian troops swiftly seized the lighthouse; however, it was badly damaged and had to be restored after the end of the war.

Ver-sur-Mer&#x27;s church, which was constructed between the 10th and 12th centuries, is dedicated to Saint Martin.

<text>.za is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for South Africa. The .za namespace is managed and regulated by the .za Domain Name Authority (ZADNA). Most domains are registered under the second-level domain .co.za.

ZA is an abbreviation of the Dutch name for the country of South Africa: &quot;Zuid-Afrika&quot;.

== Origin of the name ==
None of the official names for South Africa can be abbreviated to ZA, which is an abbreviation of the Dutch &quot;Zuid-Afrika&quot;. Dutch was considered an official language in the Union of South Africa until 1961; it subsequently lost its synonymous status with Afrikaans in 1983. &quot;Suid-Afrika&quot; is the standard spelling in Afrikaans, but the .sa domain is used by Saudi Arabia. &quot;Zuid-Afrika&quot; has a history of usage: the international vehicle code for South Africa has been &quot;ZA&quot; since 1936. &quot;ZAR&quot; serves as the ISO 4217 currency code for the South African rand. South African aircraft registration prefixes also start with &quot;Z&quot;.

<text>Margaret Ann Juntwait (March 18, 1957 – June 3, 2015) was an American radio broadcaster, best known as the announcer of the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. After thirteen years on the air at WNYC-Radio, she debuted as the Met&#x27;s announcer on December 11, 2004. She was also the Met&#x27;s first announcer on Sirius XM Satellite Radio from 2006, and remained in both jobs until her death in 2015.

==Early years==
Raised in Ridgewood and Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Juntwait attended Northern Highlands Regional High School, where she first developed an interest in choral music. Later, she studied to be an opera singer – she was a lyric soprano – and earned a degree in voice from the Manhattan School of Music in 1980. After marrying, she withdrew from an operatic career in favor of raising her three children. 

==Broadcasting career==
Juntwait began her career as a classical music radio announcer in 1991 at WNYC-FM radio in New York City. 

In 2000, while continuing at WNYC, she began her Metropolitan Opera career as the back-up announcer for radio host Peter Allen, who retired from the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts in May 2004. With the 2004–2005 broadcast season, Juntwait took to the air on her own, introducing a performance of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I Vespri Sicilani&quot;. She became only the third regular announcer for the broadcasts, following Milton Cross and Allen.

On September 20, 2006, the Met announced that Juntwait would become a full-time Met employee, having been appointed as announcer of all programs on Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s new Metropolitan Opera Radio channel. On Sirius, Juntwait hosted three or four live broadcasts a week during the opera season, and recorded introductions for hundreds of archive performances aired on the channel.

Juntwait also performed in radio theater plays produced by NPR veteran Joe Bevilacqua, including &quot;The Whithering of Willoughby and the Professor&quot;. In episode 16, Juntwait essays three roles in a parody of the British show &quot;The Prisoner&quot; from the 1960s. In episode 17, Juntwait portrays Willoughby&#x27;s mother, a mermaid and god. The plays aired on &quot;The Comedy-O-Rama Hour&quot;, heard on XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s Sonic Theater Channel.

Juntwait died of ovarian cancer at a hospice facility in Saddle River, New Jersey on June 3, 2015, aged 58. According to a memorial published on the Metropolitan Opera website, Juntwait had been diagnosed with cancer over ten years prior to her death, but continued working with the Metropolitan Opera, missing only one Saturday matinee broadcast before January 2015. Her final live broadcast was on SiriusXM Radio on December 31, 2014. She recorded material for future broadcasts just a few weeks before she died.

<doc id="1044456" wikidata="Q1081474" url="?curid=1044456" title="John Bull (locomotive)">
<text>John Bull is a historic British-built railroad steam locomotive that operated in the United States. It was operated for the first time on September 15, 1831, and became the oldest operable steam locomotive in the world when the Smithsonian Institution ran it under its own steam in 1981. Built by Robert Stephenson and Company, it was initially purchased by and operated for the Camden and Amboy Railroad, the first railroad in New Jersey, which gave it the number 1 and its first name, &quot;Stevens&quot;. (Robert L. Stevens was president of the Camden and Amboy Railroad at the time.) The C&amp;A used it heavily from 1833 until 1866, when it was removed from active service and placed in storage.

After the C&amp;A&#x27;s assets were acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871, the PRR refurbished and operated the locomotive a few times for public displays: it was fired up for the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and again for the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in 1883. In 1884 it was purchased by the Smithsonian Institution as the museum&#x27;s first major industrial exhibit.

In 1939 the employees of the PRR&#x27;s Altoona, Pennsylvania workshops built an operable replica of the locomotive for further exhibition duties, as the Smithsonian wanted to keep the original locomotive in a more controlled environment. After being on static display for 42 years, the Smithsonian commemorated the locomotive&#x27;s 150th birthday in 1981 by firing it up; it was then the world&#x27;s oldest surviving operable steam locomotive.

, the original &quot;John Bull&quot; is on static display in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and the replica is preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

==Construction and initial use==
The &quot;John Bull&quot; was built in Newcastle, England, by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Camden and Amboy Railroad (C&amp;A), the first railroad built in New Jersey. It was dismantled and then shipped across the Atlantic Ocean in crates aboard the &quot;Allegheny&quot;. C&amp;A engineer Isaac Dripps reconstructed the locomotive to the best of his ability (the shipment did not include any drawings or instructions to assemble the locomotive) and ran it for the first time in September 1831. On November 12, 1831, Robert Stevens (then president of the C&amp;A) repaid some political debts by inviting several members of the New Jersey legislature and some local dignitaries, including Napoleon&#x27;s nephew Prince Murat, for rides behind the newly delivered locomotive over a short test track. The prince&#x27;s wife, Catherine Willis Gray, made a point of hurrying onto the train so she could be declared the first woman to ride a steam-powered train in America, though unknown to her, men and women had already ridden behind the steam powered maiden runs on the Baltimore and Ohio, South Carolina Railroad, and the Mohawk and Hudson by this point in 1831.

Until the railroad was completed, the locomotive was placed in storage; horse-drawn cars served the construction efforts until 1833. The C&amp;A applied both numbers and names to their first locomotives, giving this engine the number 1 and officially naming it &quot;Stevens&quot; after Robert L. Stevens. However, through regular use of the engine, crews began calling it &quot;the old John Bull&quot;, a reference to the cartoon personification of England, John Bull. Eventually the informal name was shortened to &quot;John Bull&quot; and this name was so much more widely used that &quot;Stevens&quot; fell out of use.

In September 1836 the &quot;John Bull&quot; and two coaches were shipped by canal to Harrisburg, and became the first locomotive to operate there.

==Mechanical modifications and early exhibitions==
Stephenson built the locomotive originally as an 0-4-0. Power was transmitted to the driving axles from pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels and in front of the front axle. The main rods of the inside cylinders were connected to a rear crank axle, with a connecting rod between the two axles providing power to the front axle.

Due to poorer quality track than was the norm in its native England, the locomotive tended to derail, so the C&amp;A&#x27;s engineers added a leading truck to help guide the engine into curves. The leading truck&#x27;s mechanism necessitated the removal of the coupling rod between the two main axles, leaving only the rear axle powered. Effectively, the &quot;John Bull&quot; became a 4-2-0. Later, the C&amp;A also added a pilot (&quot;cowcatcher&quot;) to the lead truck. The cowcatcher is an angled assembly designed to deflect animals and debris off of the railroad track in front of the locomotive. To protect the locomotive&#x27;s crew from the weather, the C&amp;A added a cab to the locomotive, and C&amp;A workshop crews added safety features such as a bell and headlight.

After several years serving as a switching engine and stationary boiler, the &quot;John Bull&quot; was retired in 1866 and stored in Bordentown, New Jersey. Toward the end of its life in revenue service, the locomotive worked as a pump engine and as the power for a sawmill.

The C&amp;A was soon absorbed into the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company (1869), which, in turn, was merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871. The PRR saw the potential publicity to be gained by exhibiting such an old engine, showing it at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia; PRR workshop staff then retrofitted the engine to look more as it originally had. The wide funnel was replaced with a straight metal tube and the cab walls and roof were removed. The PRR then exhibited the engine in 1883 at the &quot;National Railway Appliance Exhibition&quot; in Chicago, Illinois. In 1885, the Smithsonian Institution accepted the donation of the &quot;John Bull&quot; from the PRR as the Institution&#x27;s first large engineering artifact.

==Smithsonian Institution and locomotive restoration==
At the exhibition in 1883, the Pennsylvania Railroad ended up resolving two problems at once. In the Smithsonian Institution, the railroad was able to find a home for the historic locomotive, as well as a suitable new employer for a young civil engineer named J. Elfreth Watkins. Watkins had been involved in an accident on the railroad in New Jersey a few years before the exhibition. He had lost a leg in the accident, so he was no longer suited to the physical demands of railroad work, although the railroad did employ him as a clerk for a while after his accident. The PRR employed his engineering experience as an expert curator for the Smithsonian&#x27;s new Arts and Industries Building, which was opened in 1880. The locomotive&#x27;s first public exhibition at the Smithsonian occurred on December 22, 1884, where it was displayed in the East Hall of the Arts and Industries building.
The locomotive remained on display in this location for nearly 80 years, but it was transported for display outside the museum on certain rare occasions. The most significant display in this time occurred in 1893 when the locomotive traveled to Chicago for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. The Pennsylvania Railroad, like many other railroads of the time, put on grand displays of their progress; the PRR arranged for the locomotive and a couple of coaches to be delivered to the railroad&#x27;s Jersey City, New Jersey, workshops where it would undergo a partial restoration to operating condition. The PRR was planning an event worthy of the locomotive&#x27;s significance to American railroad history — the railroad actually planned to operate the locomotive for the entire distance between New Jersey and Chicago.

The restoration was supervised by the PRR&#x27;s chief mechanical officer, Theodore N. Ely. Ely was confident enough in its 50-mile (80.5 km) test run to Perth Amboy, New Jersey (which took two hours and fifteen minutes), that the governors of all the states that the locomotive was to pass through and the then President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, were invited to ride behind the engine on its first leg toward Chicago. The &quot;John Bull&quot; was to pull a few passenger cars in a train that would carry dignitaries and representatives of the press. The train traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the charge of one locomotive crew. From Philadelphia, local engineers (train drivers) were employed to ride on the locomotive&#x27;s footplate as pilots to advise the operators for the trip over the local engineers&#x27; territories for the rest of the journey to Chicago. Traveling at , the train departed from the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Jersey City station at 10:16 a.m. on April 17 and reached Chicago on April 22. The locomotive operated during the exhibition giving rides to the exhibition&#x27;s attendees, and then the train left Chicago on December 6 for the return trip to Washington. The locomotive arrived back in Washington on December 13.

In 1927 the &quot;John Bull&quot; again traveled outside the museum. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was celebrating its centenary that year in its Fair of the Iron Horse in Baltimore, Maryland. Since the locomotive&#x27;s original tender (fuel and water car) had deteriorated beyond repair and was dismantled in 1910, the PRR built a replica of the tender at its Altoona, Pennsylvania, workshops. The locomotive was also refurbished in Altoona for operation during the fair. This fair was the last steam up for the locomotive until 1980.

==(Mostly) static display==
After the locomotive returned to the Smithsonian, it remained on static display. In 1930 the museum commissioned the Altoona Works to build a second replica of the locomotive&#x27;s tender for display with the locomotive in the museum. This replica tender integrated some of the fittings of the original that the museum had retained when it had been dismantled twenty years earlier.

The Smithsonian recognized the locomotive&#x27;s age in 1931, but, since the museum did not have the funds to refurbish the locomotive for full operation again, it was decided to run the locomotive in place (with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using jacks) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive&#x27;s 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive&#x27;s semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.

The PRR again borrowed the locomotive and rebuilt tender from 1933 to 1934 for the Century of Progress exhibition in Chicago. Unlike its earlier round-trip to Chicago under its own steam, the engine was hauled and displayed as a static exhibit. During the exhibit the Altoona Works built a operable replica, which was operated in 1940 at the New York World&#x27;s Fair, while the original locomotive returned to the Smithsonian.

The John Bull was displayed outside the museum one more time in 1939 at the New York World&#x27;s Fair, but the museum&#x27;s curators decided that the locomotive was becoming too fragile for repeated outside exhibits. It was then placed in somewhat permanent display back in the East Hall where it remained for the next 25 years. In 1964 the locomotive was moved to its current home, the National Museum of American History, then called the Museum of History and Technology.
The &quot;John Bull&quot; had remained on static display for another 15 years, but the locomotive&#x27;s significance as one of the oldest in existence, or its use on the first railroad in New Jersey, was not very plainly noted in the display&#x27;s literature. As 1981 and the locomotive&#x27;s 150th birthday approached, the Smithsonian started discussions on how best to commemorate the John Bull&#x27;s age and significance. There was very little question that special publications and exhibits would be prepared, but museum officials were left with the thought that the exhibit could still be so much more than that.

Many superficial inspections were performed on the locomotive in 1980 and it was found to be in relatively sound mechanical condition. No significant amount of deterioration was noted in these early inspections, and when the wheels were jacked off the rails, as they had been 50 years earlier, the axles were found to be freely operable. One morning in January 1980, before the museum opened to the public, museum officials used compressed air to power the cylinders and move the wheels through the connecting rods for the first time since its last semi-operation. After the compressed air blew some dirt and debris out of the locomotive&#x27;s exhaust stack, it was soon running smoothly.

The running gear seemed to be in good order, but it was still not known whether the boiler could still handle the pressure of steam and a live fire again. The museum asked the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company to inspect the locomotive&#x27;s boiler for operation. The inspections were conducted after hours at the museum (from 6:30 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.) over three days and included electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and radiographic tests. The tests did reveal a few flaws, but it was projected that the engine could operate at a reduced boiler pressure of 50 psi (340 kPa); as delivered to the Camden &amp; Amboy, the boiler was rated for . The Smithsonian&#x27;s staff, after a few further hydrostatic tests, were confident that the locomotive could again operate under its own power. The items that needed repair were serviced, and on October 14, 1980, the locomotive was successfully field-tested on the Warrenton Branch Line in Fauquier County between Calverton and Casanova, Virginia. The site was selected because at the time only one freight train per week used the branch line. On September 15, 1981, the locomotive operated under steam on a few miles of branch line near the Potomac River within Washington, D.C. With this exhibition, the locomotive became the oldest operable steam locomotive (and oldest self-propelled vehicle) in the world.

, the original &quot;John Bull&quot; was on static display in the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History and the replica was preserved at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania.

<text>Irapuã is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 8,048 (2020 est.) in an area of 258 km2. The elevation is 428 m. 

==History==
The municipality was created by state law in 1944.
== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia de Telecomunicações do Estado de São Paulo until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

<doc id="1044460" wikidata="Q599025" url="?curid=1044460" title="Disa (plant)">
<text>Disa is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It comprises about 182 species. Most of the species are indigenous to tropical and southern Africa, with a few more in the Arabian Peninsula, Madagascar, and Réunion. &quot;Disa bracteata&quot; is naturalised in Western Australia, where the local name is &quot;African weed-orchid.&quot;

The genus &quot;Disa&quot; was named by P.J. Bergius in 1767. It was named after Disa, the heroine of a Swedish legend.

== Description ==
The plants grow from a fleshy tuberous root which is a source of maltodextrins which are used as a sugar substitute. Some species attain a height of 90 cm.
The flowers are solitary or arranged in racemes. The petals and the lip are small. The flowers consist essentially of the sepals. The flowers range in color from very light to dark red.

== Pollination ==
&quot;Disa&quot; exhibits a variety of pollination syndromes. Each species of &quot;Disa&quot; usually has a single species as pollinator and nearly every available pollinating insect is employed by some species of &quot;Disa&quot;. Species that adapted to the same pollinator often independently evolved a similar floral morphology which confounded the infrageneric classification of &quot;Disa&quot; until cladistic analysis was applied to DNA sequences from this genus.

Examples of convergent evolution in &quot;Disa&quot; pollination include the following:
* flowers pollinated by butterflies have evolved twice, for example the pollination of &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; and &quot;Disa ferruginea&quot; by the Table Mountain Pride butterfly (&quot;Aeropetes tulbaghia&quot;) (Satyrinae)
* flowers with conspicuous deception, pollinated by carpenter bees, have evolved twice.
* long-spurred flowers, pollinated by long-tongued flies, have evolved four times.
* night-scented flowers, pollinated by moths, have evolved three times.
&quot;Disa&quot; serves as an example of how speciation can be caused by changes in pollinator availability and evolution.

Some &quot;Disa&quot; species are pollinated by sunbirds and have pollinaria that stick to the feet of the sunbirds when they perch on the inflorescence.

== Phylogeny ==
The first molecular phylogeny of the genus involved comparison of nuclear ribosomal ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, and ITS2 sequences, and showed that &quot;Herschelia&quot; and &quot;Monadenia&quot; were nested within a paraphyletic &quot;Disa&quot;.

In &quot;Genera Orchidacearum&quot; volume 2, &quot;Disa&quot; and &quot;Schizodium&quot; compose the subtribe Disinae of the tribe Diseae. After that volume was published in 2001, molecular phylogenetic studies showed that &quot;Schizodium&quot; is nested within &quot;Disa&quot;. &quot;Schizodium&quot; comprises only six species, all endemic to South Africa.

In a classification of orchids that was published in 2015, Chase et alii placed &quot;Schizodium&quot; in synonymy under &quot;Disa&quot;. They also defined the subtribe Disinae as consisting of &quot;Pachites&quot;, &quot;Disa&quot; and &quot;Huttonaea&quot;. This version of Disinae is probably not monophyletic, but was created as a holding classification, to avoid the unnecessary designation of subtribes before further studies can clarify the relationships of these three genera.

== Seeds ==
The genus can be split into two groups based on the size of the seeds. Those with relatively large balloon-shaped seeds up to 1.5 mm long belong to the &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; group. The remaining species have seeds that are smaller than 0.7 mm. The &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; group comprises plants that grow along stream sides: &quot;Disa uniflora&quot;, &quot;Disa tripetaloides&quot;, &quot;Disa cardinalis&quot;, &quot;Disa caulescens&quot; and &quot;Disa aurata&quot;. They belong to the few species in Orchidaceae that do not rely on mycorrhizal fungi for germination, and are thought to be an adaptation to hydrochory. This pattern was later extended to split the genus into summer rainfall species and non-summer rainfall species. Those in the second group added &quot;Disa cornuta&quot; to the list of &quot;Disa&quot; seeds that germinate readily.

== Horticulture ==
The species &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; is well known as an ornamental. It is a spectacular red orchid known as &quot;The Pride of Table Mountain.&quot; Other commonly cultivated species include &quot;Disa aurata, Disa cardinalis, Disa crassicornis, Disa racemosa, Disa sagittalis&quot;, and &quot;Disa tripetaloides&quot;. Some of the species are grown only in African gardens.

Once very rare in cultivation, &quot;Disa uniflora&quot; is gaining in popularity as a cut flower. However, they are difficult to grow, because of the needed mineral composition of the potting soil. Also, if exposed to excessive moisture, they can be easily killed by rot.

=== Hybrids ===

The following species have been used to create more than 400 hybrids : &quot;Disa cardinalis&quot;, &quot;Disa caulescens&quot;, &quot;Disa racemosa&quot;, &quot;Disa tripetaloides&quot;, &quot;Disa uniflora&quot;, &quot;Disa aurata&quot; and &quot;Disa venosa&quot;.

<text>Oudelande is a village in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is a part of the municipality of Borsele, and lies about 19 km southeast of Middelburg.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1312 as &quot;in Badickendorpe ende in Oudelant aen die zuudtzyde&quot;, and means &quot;old land&quot;, because it was not flooded in 1014. Oudelande is a church village which developed on a ridge which was elevated to a &quot;terp&quot; (artificial living hill) in the 13th century. The circular structure was not completed on the northern side.

The Dutch Reformed church was originally dedicated to Saint Eligius. The large tower dates from the 14th century. In 1769, a part of the church was demolished and rebuilt.

Oudelande was home to 547 people in 1840. In 1927, a railway station was built on the Goes to Hoedekenskerke railway line. The station closed down in 1934. 

The village was severely damaged during the North Sea flood of 1953. Oudelande was a separate municipality until 1970, when it was merged with Borsele.

After running a test for one year, the city council decided to remove all traffic signs in the beginning of 2007 to improve the look of the historical village.

<text>The Neutral Confederacy (also Neutral Nation, Neutral people, or ) was a tribal confederation of Iroquoian peoples. Its heartland was in the floodplain of the Grand River in what is now Ontario, Canada. At its height, its wider territory extended toward the shores of lakes Erie, Huron, and Ontario, as well as the Niagara River in the east. To the northeast were the neighbouring territories of Huronia and the Petun Country, which were inhabited by other Iroquoian confederacies from which the term Neutrals was derived. The five-nation Iroquois Confederacy was across Lake Ontario to the southeast.

Like others of Iroquoian language and culture, the tribes would raid and feud with fellow Iroquoian tribes. They were generally wary of rival Algonquian-speaking peoples, such as those who inhabited Canada to the East, along the St. Lawrence Valley basin. Iroquoian tribes were later known to historians for the fierce ways in which they waged war. A largely agrarian society, the Neutral Confederacy developed farmsteads that were admired and marveled over by European leaders writing reports to their sponsors.

The Neutral Confederacy were primarily engaged in hunting; they traded with others through furs and animal skins. The largest group identified as Chonnonton (&#x27;keepers of the deer&#x27;), partly because of their practice of herding deer into pens, a strategy used while hunting. Another group, the Onguiaahra (&#x27;near the big waters&#x27; or possibly &#x27;the strait&#x27; – or something else, see ), populated the more southern Niagara Peninsula and allegedly account for the origin of the word &quot;Niagara&quot;. The Chonnonton territory contained large deposits of flint, which was a valuable resource for sharp tools, fire-starting and, eventually, firearms, which, as a primary resource, allowed them to trade simultaneously with often-warring Huron and Iroquois tribes.

Since they were not at war with the Huron or the Iroquois in 1600, Jesuits travelling in the area of what is now Hamilton, the lower Grand Valley and Niagara, called them the Neutrals. However, the confederacy had feuds with an Algonkian people called the Mascouten or &quot;Fire Nation&quot;, who were believed to live in what is present-day Michigan. In 1616, the Neutral Confederacy had an estimated 40 villages and 4,000 warriors. In 1641, after a serious epidemic, the Jesuits counted 40 Neutral villages, with about 12,000 people.

The nation was unable to survive the changes. In the 1650s, after the Iroquois Wars, they dispersed. One source indicates that the reasons included &quot;wars, diseases and famine&quot;. The remaining members became a part of various other Iroquoian nations. Historical records kept by the French do not discuss the Neutrals as a nation or confederacy after 1672.

==Names==
The Neutrals&#x27; name for themselves was Chonnonton, or &#x27;people of the deer&#x27;, or, more precisely, &#x27;the people who tend or manage deer&#x27;. They were called &quot;Attawandaron&quot; by the Huron, meaning &#x27;people whose speech is awry &quot;or&quot; a little different&#x27;. The Iroquois called them Atirhagenrat (Atirhaguenrek) and Rhagenratka. Some of the tribes of the Neutral confederacy included the Aondironon, the Wenrehronon, and the Ongniaahraronon. They spoke Iroquoian languages but were culturally distinct from the Iroquois and competed with them for the same resources.

The French called the people &quot;Neutral&quot; () because they tried to remain neutral in the many wars between the confederacy of the Huron tribes and the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy.

==Geography==
During the late 16th and the early 17th centuries, the territory of the &quot;Attawandaron&quot;, as they were called by the Huron Nation, was mostly within the limits of present-day southern Ontario. The Museum of Ontario Archaeology summarizes that territory as follows: 
they &quot;inhabited dozens of villages in Southwestern Ontario stretching along the north shore of Lake Erie from the Niagara Peninsula to the Detroit River, perhaps as far north as Toronto in the east and Goderich in the west.&quot; They had population concentrations on the Niagara Peninsula and in the vicinity of the present-day communities of Hamilton and Milton, Ontario. In addition to this main territory, there was a single population cluster to the east, across the Niagara River, near modern-day Buffalo, New York, which was west of the Wenro people.
Souharissen was the warrior chief who lived in a village called &quot;Ounontisatan,&quot; which was visited by the French in 1625-1626. His trade agreement with the Neutral people provided protection for them by his warriors. The principal headman took on and defeated the Fire Nation in what is present-day Michigan. The Recollect priest Joseph de la Roche Daillon lived with him for five months in the winter of 1626–1627. Daillon visited 28 Neutral villages, including the capital, which the French referred to as &quot;Nôtre Dame des Anges.&quot; The fertile flats of the various oxbows that Big Creek makes three miles from its mouth at Grand River, were ideal for long-term settlement. Noble uses the term &quot;Neutralia&quot; to designate the concentration of Iroquoian-speaking natives in the area.

F. Douglas Reville&#x27;s &quot;The History of the County of Brant&quot; (1920) said that the hunting grounds of the Attawandaron ranged from Genesee Falls and Sarnia and south of a line drawn from Toronto to Goderich.

During their travels, Jean de Brébeuf and Pierre Joseph Marie Chaumonot gave each Neutral village a Christian name. The only ones that are mentioned in their writings were &quot;Kandoucho&quot;, or All Saints, the nearest to the Huron Nation; &quot;Onguioaahra&quot;, on the Niagara River; &quot;Teotongniaton&quot; or St. William, in the centre of their country; and &quot;Khioetoa&quot;, or St. Michel (near what is now Windsor, Ontario).

Reville described their territory as having been heavily forested and full of &quot;wild fruit trees of vast variety,&quot; with nut trees, berry bushes, and wild grape vines. &quot;Elk, caribou, and black bear; deer, wolves, foxes, martens and wild cats filled the woods.&quot;

According to the City of Waterloo, Ontario, the indigenous people who lived in the area in the precontact era included the Neutral Confederacy. In 2020, a site in nearby Kitchener, Ontario was found to include artifacts from an Iroquioan village that was inhabited circa 1300 to 1600. Archeologists found some 35,000 objects including stone tools and a 4,000 year old arrowhead. Another source states that the site &quot;is among a cluster of Attawandaron villages in this part of the region&quot;. In 1976, a Neutral Confederacy cemetery was unearthed in Grimsby, Ontario. The area that now comprises Morriston in Puslinch, Ontario is said to have been inhabited by the Neutral Confederacy, in a village of 4,000. This region may have had the largest Neutral Confederacy settlement in Ontario, at one time.

Onondaga chert was plentiful in Neutral lands due to the presence of the Onondaga Limestone formation. This tool stone was also available to the Five Nations Iroquois in their own lands, but not to other neighbouring peoples. The Neutral territory marked the furthest northern and western extent of useable chert deposits, even though the Onondaga Limestone runs further.

==History==
The Neutrals had an alliance with the Wenrohronon, also Iroquoian-language people, to defend against the powerful Iroquois Five Nations Confederacy, who were also Iroquoian speakers. That dissolved in 1639, with devastating effects, particularly to the Wenrohronon. The Wenrohronon made an alliance with the Huron, who were located farther away and could not offer much support.

Traveling south from Midland, Ontario, Étienne Brûlé passed through the Attawandaron territory circa 1615 and spent a winter among the Nation, during 1625–1626. A Franciscan Récollet, Father Joseph de La Roche Daillon, spent time with the Nation in 1626 and estimated the population as 40,000 at that time. About 14 years later, Brébeuf and Chaumonot visited 18 Neutral Confederacy settlements and stayed in ten villages. By that time, the estimated population was only &quot;about 12,000 people and 4,000 warriors in about 40 villages and hamlets&quot;.

After destroying the Hurons, the Iroquois attacked the Neutrals. Around 1650, during a period that is now loosely referred to as the Beaver Wars, referring to the theft of furs, the Iroquois Confederacy declared war on the Attawandaron. Some historians state that the Iroquois destroyed the Neutral society, which ended as a separate entity in 1651. However, the Neutral population had already been reduced by diseases such as smallpox and measles carried by Europeans. By 1652, the Iroquois had also destroyed the Huron, Petun and Erie Nations. Some of the Neutrals were incorporated into Seneca villages in upstate New York, and others were absorbed into various other societies. The Kenjockety family, one of the last known families to trace their ethnicity to the Neutrals, still lives among the Senecas.

Anthropologist Jackes discussed the year 1651 as particularly significant: &quot;during the final Iroquois onslaught...the Neutral fled into the woods and dispersed for the last time ... The years of famine and disease no doubt contributed to the rout&quot;.  

The last reference to the Neutrals as an independent society is from the fall of 1653. A historical mention in 1864 refers to the &quot;Huron de la nation neuter&quot; and &quot;Hurons neutres&quot; (neutral Hurons).

==Society and culture==
The Neutral Confederacy had much in common with the Petun Nation and may have had shared ancestry. The Jesuit Relations in 1652 describes tattooing among the Petun (also called the Tobacco Nation) as well as the Neutrals: &quot;And this (tattooing) in some nations is so common that in the one which we called the Tobacco, and... the Neutral. I know not whether a single individual was found, who was not painted in this manner, on some part of the body.&quot;

The Museum of Ontario Archeology describes the society as &quot;semi-nomadic&quot;, living in villages for about 20 years before abandoning a site after depleting the game and the soil of the area. A historian in 1997 stated that the Nation &quot;also made use of hamlets, agricultural field cabins, specialized camps ... and cemeteries. Another source describes the Neutrals as a &quot;hunter-gatherer society who lived in longhouses that sheltered multiple families&quot;. Research conducted by anthropologist Mary Jackes states that they remained neutral &quot;in the conflicts between the Iroquois from south of the Great Lakes and the Ontario Iroquoians who lived to the north&quot; and thrived through active trading instead of war, although the Huron nation aggressively worked to prevent trade between the Neutrals and the French.    

The chief of 28 villages, villas, and towns in the last years of the Neutral confederacy was named Tsouharissen or Souharissen (&quot;Child of the Sun&quot;) who led several raids against the Mascouten (or &quot;The Fire Nation&quot;), who lived in territory in present-day Michigan and Ohio. A 1627 report called him the chief of all of the nation (Neutrals). Tsouharissen died around 1646. Within a generation (by the early 1670s), all of the nearby first nations, the Erie, the Huron, Neutrals, Tobacco tribes, and even the fierce Susquehannocks would all fall between rampaging epidemic diseases or in the bloody Beaver Wars between themselves and/or to the last tribe standing with any significant military power, the Iroquois.

===Flintworking and trade===
The Neutrals quarried Onondaga chert from the Onondaga Limestone formation in their lands. Prior to European contact, they used this chert as a tool stone for arrowheads, bifaces, and other weapons and tools. This extended into the protohistoric and post-contact periods, and has been documented at sites associated with the Onondaga, Oneida, and St. Lawrence Iroquoians. It was superior for toolmaking to other local chert varieties around the St. Lawrence Lowlands.

That important resource was used to make spearheads and arrowheads and so gave the Neutrals the power to maintain their neutrality. Once the neighbours began receiving firearms through trade with the Europeans, however, the possession of the flint grounds was much less of an advantage. Flints were still used in trade for the flintlocks on guns. The Neutral continued to trade commodities such as maize, tobacco, and black squirrel and other high-grade furs for steel axes, glass beads, cloaks, conch shells, gourd containers, and firearms.

===Language===
Records left by Jesuit priests in the 1600s indicate that the Neutral language was similar to Huron and so was a dialect of Iroquoian. They believed that all three groups had once been a part of a single group.

Their neighbours, the Wendat (Wyandot, or Huron) Nation referred to the Neutrals (Chonnonton) impolitely as &quot;Attawandaron,&quot; meaning &quot;Those whose speech is awry&quot; because their dialect was different. (Apparently, the Chonnonton referred to the Wendat by the same term.) Because the language of the Neutral Confederacy has been extinct for more than three centuries, little is known about the Neutrals&#x27; language. Mithun (1979:145, 188–189) cites Jesuits pointing out that the Neutral language was different from the Wendat language, in that the Neutrals were &quot;vne Nation differente de langage, au moins en plusieurs choses&quot; (Thwaites 21.188) / &quot;a Nation different in language, at least in many respects&quot; (Thwaites 21.189). Mithun further cites work by Roy Wright (Mithun 1979:160) where the latter notes from the Neutral name given to Chaumonot that the Neutral language did not have sound changes that distinguish Wendat from other Northern Iroquoian languages. Hanzeli (1969), referencing Thwaites (21:228–230), notes Brébeuf and Chaumonot considered Neutral different enough from Wendat to write a separate Neutral grammar and dictionary, now lost.

==Archaeology==
The Southwold Earthworks, near St. Thomas, Ontario, contains the remains of a precontact Neutral village and is a National Historic Site of Canada. It is known for conspicuous earthworks, which were rare in southern Ontario, and are well preserved.

The Museum of Ontario Archaeology in London, Ontario, is located adjacent to the Lawson site. It is another 500-year-old Neutral village which has been under study since the early 1900s. An Ontario historical plaque commemorates the site, which was occupied by Neutrals in the 1500s. About 1000 to 2000 people lived in longhouses in the fortified community. Scientific excavation was first completed in 1921–1923, when the site was owned by the Lawson family. The searches have recovered 30,000 artifacts and the remains of 19 longhouses. Some of the longhouses and the pallisade have been reconstructed.

The McMaster University professor William Noble has excavated and documented the existence of many villages southwest of Hamilton, comprising a Neutral Confederacy, which he believes to have been centred at the Walker site and was presided over by the chief Souharissen. Noble was instrumental in excavating and documenting other Neutral sites in Thorold, Grimsby, and Binbrook. Reports from those and other Southern Ontario sites near Milton (Crawford Lake) and Oakville have indicated that the Neutral Confederacy hunted not only deer but also elk, moose, beaver, raccoons, squirrels, black bear, fox and muskrat. The remains of catfish, whitefish, salmon and trout were also common at many of the sites.

In 1983–1985, another site was excavated. One of the largest Attawandaron villages, the location covered 13 acres of the Badenoch section of Puslinch, on the east side of Morriston, Ontario. The estimated population of the Ivan Elliot site was 4,000; the Neutrals lived in longhouses and used the village for about 20 years. Another nearby site, on the McPhee farm, owned by Raymond Reid, was excavated in 1983. The village had a population of about 1,000 around 1500–1530.

The Neutral Confederacy decline and eventual end can be attributed to genocide. The final catastrophe that led to its end by the early 1650s was investigated by the archaeologist Mary Jackes. The demise of the Neutral Confederacy occurred in spite of reports by the French, who first met it, &quot;in 1610 as strong, healthy and numerous. They lived in the most fertile and warmest part of Ontario. They were determined to remain neutral in the conflicts between the Iroquois from south of the Great Lakes and the Ontario Iroquoians who lived to the north of the Neutral. They throve on trade, rather than war.&quot; Jackes re-examined French reports including the Jesuit Relations and the artefacts found in the Grimsby site.

When grounds were prepared for a new housing development in Grimsby, Ontario, in 1976, a Neutral Confederacy burial site was uncovered in sheltered embayment of the Niagara Escarpment. The excavation by Kenyon was closed after only two months in 1977, and the skeletons were reburied near the original site. It was estimated that over 100 bodies were recovered at the time. &quot;Natural disruption, disease, famine and years of severe weather would have been sufficient to begin population decline. Intensifying war, with many killed, taken captive or forced to become refugees, led to almost complete population collapse.&quot; Jackes suggested that this burial site &quot;had significance and that it was a place of refuge... especially for women and children.&quot;

<doc id="1044472" wikidata="Q263673" url="?curid=1044472" title="Lorne sausage">
<text>The Lorne sausage, also known as square sausage, flat sausage or slice, is a traditional Scottish food item made from minced meat, rusk and spices. Although termed a sausage, no casing is used to hold the meat in shape, hence it is usually served as square slices from a formed block. It is a common component of the traditional Scottish breakfast.

== Name ==
It is thought that the sausage is named after the region of Lorne in Argyll; advertisements for &#x27;Lorne Sausage&#x27; have been found in newspapers as early as 1892. This was long before Scottish comedian Tommy Lorne, after whom the sausage has been said to be named, became well-known: he was born in 1890.

==History==
The exact origins of the Lorne sausage remain unclear. It is often eaten in the Scottish variant of the full breakfast or in a breakfast roll. The sausage is also an appropriate size to make a sandwich using a slice from a plain loaf of bread cut in half.

==Preparation==
Sausage meat (beef, pork or more usually a combination of the two) is minced with rusk and spices, packed into a rectangular tin with a cross-section of about square, and sliced about thick before cooking. Square sausage has no casing, unlike traditional sausages, and must be tightly packed into the mould to hold it together; slices are often not truly square.

Occasionally, it has a length of caseless black pudding or haggis through the middle, in the style of a gala pie.

<text>Itanhaém is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of the Baixada Santista. The population is 103,102 (2020 est.) in an area of 601.85 km². The elevation is 4 m.

==Geography==
The name &quot;Itanhaém&quot; comes from the Tupi word &quot;&quot;-&quot;&quot;, meaning the &quot;plate of rock&quot;. Some other Tupinologists (people who study the ancient language Tupi, spoken by the natives back in the 16th century) believe itanhaém means, ita = rock - and nhaém = that cries; due to the rocky coast and the waves that constantly hit it.

Itanhaém was among the greatest tour destinations in the State of São Paulo, in the late-1970s. Located in the Southeastern Brazil, the region is surrounded by the tropical Atlantic Forest that shelters many tropical animals such as colorful birds named Saíra (many subspecies) and animals such as Onças (Brazilian Jaguars), Quatis and Saruês. Itanhaém has many beaches: Downtown beach (Centro or Boca da Barra), Fishermen&#x27;s Beach (Praia dos Pescadores); Dream Beach (Praia do Sonho); Indians&#x27; Well Beach (Poço dos Índios), Peruíbe Beach (Praia do Peruíbe) and Seagull Beach (Praia da Gaivota).

Other beaches are located in Peruíbe, once part of Itanhaém&#x27;s territory (20 km southwards) and in the Juréia-Itatins Ecological Station, the best preserved and biggest sanctuary of the Atlantic Forest in Brazil, sheltering endemic species such as the Red-tailed amazon (Brazilian Portuguese: &quot;papagaio-de-cara-roxa&quot;). Among some of the most popular places in Peruibe, there are the falls of Pereque and Paraiso (Paradise), both forming lakes and waterholes deep enough for a dive among pitus (freshwater shrimp) and lambaris (freshwater fish). The most popular beaches are the ones of Barra do Una (this one on the border of the Municipality of Iguape), Carambore, Desertinha, Juquia, Paranapua, Brava, Guarau and Little Guarau ou Guarauzinho; all of them very close to Itanhaém.

The most important river in the region is located in Itanhaém (Itanhaém River) and its tributary streams such as the Black and the White rivers make sinuous paths into the forest towards the foot of the Serra do Mar where there are many, if not hundreds, of waterfalls. Itanhaém can be reached in 1½ hours by car from the city of São Paulo (130,000 km2), the capital of the State of São Paulo.

The municipality contains part of the Tupiniquins Ecological Station.

The city is served by the Antônio Ribeiro Nogueira Jr. Airport.

<doc id="1044490" wikidata="Q635839" url="?curid=1044490" title="Battle of Sentinum">
<text>The Battle of Sentinum was the decisive battle of the Third Samnite War, fought in 295 BC near Sentinum (next to the modern town of Sassoferrato, in the Marches region of Italy), in which the Romans overcame a formidable coalition of Samnites, Etruscans, and Umbrians and Senone Gauls. The Romans won a decisive victory that broke up the tribal coalition (the Etruscans, Umbrians, and Senones pulled out of the war) and paved the way for the Romans&#x27; complete victory over the Samnites. The Romans involved in the battle of Sentinum were commanded by consuls Publius Decius Mus and Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus.

==Background==
The Third Samnite War started when envoys from Lucania asked Rome for help against an attack on them by the Samnites. Rome intervened and the war started. Just prior to and during the first year of this, Rome was also facing a war with the Etruscans. In 297 BC the Romans received news that the Etruscans were considering suing for peace. As a result, both Roman consuls marched on Samnium and concentrated their operations there. Quintus Fabius defeated the Samnites at the Battle of Tifernum and Publius Decius defeated a Samnite force from Apulia near Maleventum. The two consuls then spent four months ravaging Samnium. Fabius also seized Cimetra (location unknown).

In 296 BC Quintus Fabius and Publius Decius were made proconsuls and were given a six-month extension of their military command to carry on the war in Samnium. Publius Decius ravaged Samnium until he drove the Samnite army outside its territory. The Samnite army headed north to Etruria to back up previous calls for an alliance with the Etruscans that had been turned down. Gellius Egnatius, a Samnite commander, insisted on the Etruscan council being convened. Most Etruscan city-states voted for a joint war. Umbrian groups near Etruria also joined in and there were attempts to hire Gallic mercenaries.

The consul Appius Claudius Caecus set off for Etruria with two legions and 15,000 allied troops. The other consul, Lucius Volumnius Flamma Violens, had already left for Samnium with two legions and 12,000 allies. Appius Claudius suffered some setbacks so Lucius Volumnius went to Etruria to help. The two consuls together defeated the Etruscans and Lucius Volumnius returned to Samnium as their appointments as proconsulships were about to expire. Meanwhile, the Samnites raised new troops and raided Roman territories and allies in Campania. Volumnius repelled the raids. However, the raids alarmed Rome because of news that the Etruscans were arming themselves and had invited the Samnites (under Gellius Egnatius) and the Umbrians to join them in a major revolt against the Romans. There were also reports that large sums of money were being offered to the Gauls followed by reports of an actual coalition between these four peoples and that there was &quot;a huge army of Gauls.&quot;

It was the first time that Rome had to confront such a large coalition of forces. The two best military commanders, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus and Publius Decius Mus, were elected as consuls again (for 295 BC). They took on the war in Etruria with four legions and a large body of allied infantry and cavalry (1,000 Campanian soldiers are mentioned), 40,000 men in total. The allies fielded an even larger army. Lucius Volumnius&#x27; command was prolonged for a year to continue the war in Samnium with two legions. Livy thought that his going there with such a big force must have been part of a diversionary strategy to force the Samnites to respond to Roman raids in Samnium and limit their troop deployment in Etruria. Two reserve contingents headed by propraetors were stationed in the Faliscan district and near the Vatican Hill to protect Rome.

The Etruscans, Samnites, and Umbrians crossed the Apennine Mountains and approached Sentinum. Their plan was for the Samnites and Senones to engage the Romans and for the Etruscans and Umbrians to take the Roman camp during the battle. Deserters from Clusium informed Quintus Fabius about this plan. The consul ordered the legions in Falerii and the Vatican to march to Clusium and ravage its territory as another diversionary strategy. This succeeded in drawing the Etruscans away from Sentinum to defend their land. Livy thought that with their departure the two enemy forces were so evenly matched that if the Etruscans and Umbrians had been present it would have been a disaster for the Romans. The propraetor Gnaeus Fulvius defeated the Etruscans. Perusia and Clusium lost up to 3,000 men.

==Battle==
The two armies arrived at the plain of Sentinum, but waited for two days to do battle. Finally, unable to control the eagerness of their troops, the Romans attacked. The Senones stood on the right and the Samnites on the left. On the Roman side Quintus Fabius commanded the right and Publius Decius the left.

Quintus Fabius fought defensively to make the battle a test of endurance and wait for the enemy to flag. Publius Decius fought more aggressively and ordered a cavalry charge, which drove back the Senone cavalry twice. During the second charge they reached the enemy infantry, but were counter-charged by the Senone chariots and were routed. The line of Decius’ infantry was broken by the chariots and the Senone foot.

Publius Decius decided to perform the &quot;devotio&quot;, offering prayers to the gods and launching himself into the enemy lines, effectively sacrificing himself when his troops were in dire straits, just as his father had done at the Battle of Vesuvius in 340 BC. This act galvanised the Roman left who were joined by two reserve contingents which Quintus Fabius had called in to help.

On the right, Quintus Fabius directed the cavalry to outflank the Samnite wing and attack it in the flank and ordered his infantry to push forward. He then called in the other reserves. The Samnites broke and fled past the Senone line. The Senones formed a testudo with their shields at the front and top. Quintus Fabius ordered 500 Campanian lancers to attack them in the rear, combined with attacks by the middle line of one of the legions and by other cavalry units. Meanwhile, Quintus Fabius and the rest of the army took the Samnite camp by storm and cut off the line of retreat of the Senones. The Senones were defeated, losing 20,000 men according to Livy, while the Romans lost 8,700 men.

==Aftermath==
Livy noted that some writers (whose work is lost) exaggerated the size of the battle, saying that the Umbrians also took part which gave the enemy an infantry of 60,000, a cavalry of 40,000 and 1,000 chariots and claiming that Lucius Volumnius and his two legions also fought in the battle. Livy said that Lucius Volumnius, instead, was holding the front in Samnium and routed a Samnite force near Mount Tifernus. After the battle, 5,000 Samnites made their way back home from Sentinum through the land of the Paeligni. The locals attacked them and killed 1,000 men. Quintus Fabius left Publius Decius’ army to guard Etruria and went to Rome to celebrate a triumph. In Etruria, the Perusini continued the war. Appius Claudius was sent to head Publius Decius’ army as propraetor and Quintus Fabius confronted and defeated the Perusini. The Samnites attacked the areas around the River Liris (at Formiae and Vescia), and the River Volturnus. They were pursued by Appius Claudius and Lucius Volumnius. They joined their forces and defeated them near Caiatia, near Capua.

Rome&#x27;s victory broke up the coalition it had defeated. The Etruscans, Umbrians and Senone Gauls pulled out of the war. The Samnites, besides losing their allies, suffered heavy casualties. The Romans went on to win other battles against the Samnites. In the final stage of the war, which ended five years later, the Romans devastated Samnium and the Samnites capitulated. Rome gained control over much of central Italy and part of southern Italy.

<text>The Palio di Siena (; known locally simply as ; from Latin ) is a horse race held twice each year, on 2 July and 16 August, in Siena, Italy. Ten horses and riders, bareback and dressed in the appropriate colours, represent ten of the seventeen , or city wards, in a tradition dating back to the 17th-century. The Palio held on 2 July is named Palio di Provenzano, in honour of the Madonna of Provenzano, a Marian devotion particular to Siena which developed around an icon from the area of the city. The Palio held on 16 August is named Palio dell&#x27;Assunta, in honour of the Assumption of Mary.

Sometimes, in case of exceptional events or local or national anniversaries deemed relevant and pertinent ones, the city community may decide for an extraordinary Palio, run between May and September, such as on 9 September 2000, to celebrate the city entering the new millennium and on 20 October 2018, in commemoration of the centenary of the end of the Great War.

The Corteo Storico, a pageant to the sound of the March of the Palio, precedes the race, which attracts visitors and spectators from around the world.

The race itself, in which the jockeys ride bareback, circles the Piazza del Campo, on which a thick layer of earth has been laid. The race is run for three laps of the piazza and usually lasts no more than 90 seconds. It is common for a few of the jockeys to be thrown off their horses while making the treacherous turns in the piazza, and indeed, it is not unusual to see riderless horses finishing the race. A horse is not required to have a rider to win the race.

==History==
===Origins===
The earliest known antecedents of the race are medieval. The town&#x27;s central &quot;piazza&quot; was the site of public games, largely combative: &quot;pugna&quot;, a sort of many-sided boxing match or brawl; jousting; and in the 16th century, bullfights. Public races organized by the &quot;contrade&quot; were popular from the 14th century onwards; called &quot;&quot;, they were run across the whole city.

When the Grand Duke of Tuscany outlawed bullfighting in 1590, the &quot;contrade&quot; took to organizing races in the Piazza del Campo. The first such races were on buffalo-back and called &quot;bufalate&quot;; &quot;asinate&quot;, races on donkey-back, later took their place, while horse racing continued elsewhere. The first modern Palio (called &quot;palio alla tonda&quot; to distinguish it from the earlier &quot;palio alla lunga&quot;) took place in 1633.

===A second Palio in August===
At first, one race was held each year, on 2 July. A second, on 16 August, was added from 1701, though initially, the August race was run intermittently rather than every year. The August race &quot;(il palio dell&#x27;Assunta)&quot;, which coincided with the Feast of the Assumption, was probably introduced &quot;spontaneously&quot; as part of the feasting and celebration associated with this important festival. The date 16 August was presumably chosen because the other days of the mid-August canonical festival, the 14th and 15th of the month, were already taken up respectively by the Corteo dei Ceri (Procession of the Ceri) and by the census.

The August Palio started out as an extension of the celebrations of the July Palio and was organized and funded by July&#x27;s winning contrada, though only if the contrada in question could afford it. After 1802, however, organisation and funding the August race became a central responsibility of the city, which removed annual uncertainty over whether or not an August Palio would run. It has been held at least since 15 August 1581 when 15-year-old jockey Virginia Tacci was the first female to ride a steed in the race.

===Restriction===
In 1729, the city&#x27;s Munich-born governor, Violante of Bavaria, defined formal boundaries for the contrade, at the same time imposing several mergers so that the number of Sienese contrade was reduced to seventeen. This was also the year of the decree restricting to ten the number of contrade that could participate in a Palio; the restriction, which remains in force, resulted from the number and extent of accidents experienced in the preceding races.

==The seventeen contrade==
The seventeen contrade are: 

* Aquila (Eagle)
* Bruco (Caterpillar)
* Chiocciola (Snail)
* Civetta (Little Owl)
* Drago (Dragon)
* Giraffa (Giraffe)
* Istrice (Crested Porcupine)
* Leocorno (Unicorn)
* Lupa (She-Wolf)
* Nicchio (Seashell)
* Oca (Goose)
* Onda (Wave)
* Pantera (Panther)
* Selva (Forest)
* Tartuca (Tortoise)
* Torre (Tower)
* Valdimontone (Valley of the Ram) often shortened to &quot;Montone&quot;
In each race, only ten of the seventeen &quot;contrade&quot; participate: the seven which did not participate in the previous year&#x27;s Palio and three others chosen by drawing lots.

==The race today==
The first race (Palio di Provenzano) is held on 2 July, which is both the Feast of the Visitation and the date of a local festival in honour of the Madonna of Provenzano (a sculpture of the Virgin Mary once owned by the Sienese leader Provenzano Salvani, which was supposed to have miraculous curative power). The second race is held on 16 August (Palio dell&#x27;Assunta), the day after the Feast of the Assumption, and is likewise dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After exceptional events (e.g., the Apollo 11 Moon landing) and on important anniversaries (e.g., the centennial of the Unification of Italy), the Sienese community may decide to hold a third Palio between May and September. The most recent was in 2018 to celebrate the anniversary of the end of WWI.

The field consists of ten horses, so not all seventeen contrade can take part in the Palio on any occasion. The seven contrade that did not take part in that month of the previous year are automatically included; three more are chosen by draw (twice a year, in the last days of May and at the beginning of July). Private owners (among them, some jockeys) offer the pick of their stables, selected during the year after trial races, other Palio races in Italy and veterinary examination, from which main representatives of the participating &quot;contrade&quot;, the &quot;Capitani&quot;, choose ten of approximately equal quality, three days before the race. A lottery then determines which horse will run for each &quot;contrada&quot;. Six trial races are run, the first on the evening of the horse selection and the last on the morning before the Palio. Corruption (bribery) is commonplace, prompting the residents of each &quot;contrada&quot;, known as &quot;contradaioli&quot;, to keep a close watch on their stable and their rider. The horses are of mixed breed; no purebred horses are allowed.
The race is preceded by a spectacular pageant to the sound of the March of the Palio, the Corteo Storico, which includes (among many others) &quot;Alfieri&quot;, flag wavers, in medieval costumes. Just before the pageant, a squad of &quot;carabinieri&quot; on horseback, wielding swords, demonstrate a mounted charge around the track. They take one lap at a walk, in formation, and a second at a gallop that foreshadows the excitement of the race to come, before exiting down one of the streets that leads out of Piazza del Campo. Spectators arrive early in the morning, eventually filling the centre of the town square, inside the track, to capacity; the local police seal the entrances once the festivities begin in earnest. Seats ranging from simple bleachers to elaborate box seats may be had for a price, but sell out long before the day of the race.
At 7:30 p.m. for the July race, and 7 p.m. for the August race, the detonation of an explosive charge echoes across the piazza, signaling to the thousands of onlookers that the race is about to begin. The race itself runs for three laps of the &quot;Piazza del Campo&quot;, the perimeter of which is covered with several inches of dirt (imported and laid for the occasion at great expense to the city) and the corners of which are protected with padded crash barriers for the occasion. The jockeys ride the horses bareback from the starting line, an area between two ropes. Nine horses, in an order only decided by lot immediately before the race starts, enter the space. The tenth, the &quot;rincorsa&quot;, waits outside. When the &quot;rincorsa&quot; finally enters the space between the ropes the starter (&quot;mossiere&quot;) activates a mechanism that instantly drops the &quot;canapo&quot; (the front rope). This process (the &quot;mossa&quot;) can take a very long time, as deals have usually been made between various &quot;contrade&quot; and jockeys that affect when the &quot;rincorsa&quot; moves—he may be waiting for a particular other horse to be well—or badly-placed, for example.
On the dangerous, steeply canted track, the riders are allowed to use their whips (in Italian, &quot;nerbi&quot;, stretched, dried bulls&#x27; hide) not only for their own horse, but also for disturbing other horses and riders. The Palio in fact is won by the horse who represents his &quot;contrada&quot;, and not by the jockeys. The winner is the first horse to cross the finish line—a horse can win without its rider (a condition known as &quot;cavallo scosso&quot;). A horse can also win without its decorative headgear (&quot;spennacchiera&quot;), although the opposite belief is widely held even among the Sienese. The loser in the race is considered to be the &quot;contrada&quot; whose horse came second, not last.

The winner is awarded a banner of painted silk, or &quot;palio&quot;, which is hand-painted by a different artist for each race. The enthusiasm after the victory, however, is so extreme that the ceremony of attribution of the &quot;palio&quot; is quite instantaneous, being the first moment of a months-long celebration for the winning ward. There are occasional outbreaks of violence between partisans of rival &quot;contrade&quot;.

There may be some danger to spectators from the sheer number of people in attendance. There have also been complaints about mistreatment of horses, injuries and even deaths, especially from animal-rights associations and even from some veterinarians. In the Palio held on 16 August 2004, the horse for the &quot;contrada&quot; of Bruco (the Caterpillar) fell and was badly trampled, as the race was not stopped despite possible additional safety risks for other horses. The horse died of its injuries, raising further complaints from animal-rights organizations.

The Palio differs from &quot;normal&quot; horse races in that part of the game is for the wards to prevent rival &quot;contrade&quot; from winning. When a &quot;contrada&quot; fails to win, its historical enemy will celebrate that fact nearly as merrily as a victory of its own, regardless of whether adversarial interference was a deciding factor. Few things are forbidden to the jockeys during the race; for instance, they can pull or shove their fellows, hit the horses and each other, or try to hamper other horses at the start.

The most successful ward is Oca, the Goose, which has won 64 races (at least according to their records, which start from 1644), followed by Chiocciola, the Snail, with 51, and Tartuca, the Tortoise, with 46. Oca is also the &quot;contrada&quot; with the most wins in recent history (from 1900 to 2010) with 21 victories, followed by Selva, the Forest, with 18, and Drago, the Dragon, with 17.

Among jockeys, the most victorious of all time is Andrea Degortes, nicknamed &quot;Aceto&quot; (&#x27;Vinegar&#x27;), with 14 wins (from 1964 to 1996). Angelo Meloni, nicknamed &quot;Picino&quot; (active from 1897 to 1933) has the second in the number of wins with 13 successes, and Luigi Bruschelli, nicknamed &quot;Trecciolino&quot; (still active), has the third most of 12 wins (although he claims 13 victories, his horse won without him one year).

The most successful horses were Folco and Panezio with eight wins each, followed by Topolone with seven.

In recent history (from 1900 to the present), only three wards have succeeded in winning both the July and the August races in a single year (the term in Italian is &quot;fare cappotto&quot;) with the same jockey. Tartuca (the Tortoise) accomplished the feat in 1933 with jockey Fernando Leoni (nicknamed &quot;Ganascia&quot;) on Folco. In 1997, Giraffa (the Giraffe) won both races, with jockey Giuseppe Pes, nicknamed &quot;Il Pesse&quot;. In 2016, jockey Jonatan Bartoletti, on the mount &quot;Preziosa Penelope&quot;, won both the July and August races for Lupa (the She-wolf).

==Ritual and rivalry==
The &quot;Palio di Siena&quot; is more than a simple horse race. It is the culmination of ongoing rivalry and competition between the &quot;contrade&quot;. The lead-up and the day of the race are invested with passion and pride. Formal and informal rituals take place as the day proceeds, with each &quot;contrada&quot; navigating a strategy of horsemanship, alliances and animosities. There are the final clandestine meetings among the heads of the &quot;contrade&quot; and then between them and the jockeys. There is the two-hour pageant of the &quot;Corteo Storico&quot;, and then all this is crowned by the race, which takes only about 75 seconds to complete. Although there is great public spectacle, the passions displayed are still very real.

The &quot;contrada&quot; that has been the longest without a victory is nicknamed &quot;nonna&quot; (&#x27;grandmother&#x27;). Civetta (the Owlet) had the title from 1979 until 2009, when it won 16 August race. Torre (the Tower) had this title for being without victory for 44 years (from 1961 to 2005), and Bruco (the Caterpillar) held the title for not winning over 41 years (from 1955 to 1996). Last &quot;nonna&quot; was Lupa (the She-Wolf), which has not had a victory since 2 July 1989, a period of years, until July 2016, when it finally won, leaving now the &quot;nonna&quot; title to Aquila (the Eagle).

==Palio (Drappellone)==

The &quot;drappellone&quot; (&#x27;banner&#x27;), or &quot;palio&quot;, known affectionately as &quot;cencio&quot; (&#x27;the rag&#x27;) in Siena, is the trophy that is to be delivered to the &quot;contrada&quot; that wins the Palio.

The &quot;palio&quot; is an elongated rectangular piece of silk, hand-painted by an artist for the occasion. It is held vertically on a black-and-white shaft halberd and topped by a silver plate, with two white and black plumes draped down the sides.

The &quot;palio&quot;, along with the plumes, remains the property of the &quot;contrada&quot;. The plate is returned to the city of Siena before the two Palii of the following year, after the date and the name of the victorious &quot;contrada&quot; are inscribed on its back. There is one silver platter for the Palio in July and another for the August Palio. The plates are replaced approximately every ten years.

The value of the banner is unique, because it represents a particular historical period of the city of Siena. The &quot;palii&quot; often reflect the symbols of the various governments that have presided at various times, including the crest of the grand duchy of Lorraine, the crest of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the crest of the Kingdom of Sardinia, symbols from Fascist Italy, and most recently, imagery of the Republic.

The process that an artist should follow in designing the &quot;palio&quot; is rigid: it must follow a precise iconography that includes some sacred symbols, as the July Palio is dedicated to the Madonna of Provenzano, and that of August to the Madonna of the Assumption. It must present the insignia of the city, those of the third part of the city, and the symbols or colors of the ten &quot;contrade&quot; participating in the race. There are, however, no limits regarding the style of the art. The &quot;palio&quot; is first presented at a press conference in the courtyard of the Podestà of the City Hall about a week before the race.

==Preparations throughout the year==

Although many activities take place within each &quot;contrada&quot;, the organization of the Palio is still the largest, since it is not just in two races each year. Each time, the festival itself runs for four days of events, the preparation for which lasts all year.

Beginning in early winter, the contrada leaders talk and develop strategies, making contacts with the jockeys and horse owners. These leaders prepare those who will race in the Piazza del Campo or take part in minor Palios elsewhere in nearby towns (&quot;la cosiddetta provincia&quot;) and bring them to training courses organized by the city in the spring.

The full activities of the Palio start to grow in momentum towards the end of May, with the drawing of lots of the three remaining &quot;contrade&quot; that will join the seven that have won the right to race. With districts and teams outlined, &quot;contrade&quot; begin to talk about &quot;deals&quot; (engagement of jockeys) and &quot;parties&quot; (secret pacts for the win), despite not knowing which horse they will draw in the lot.

About a week before the race, the &quot;palio&quot; (&quot;drappellone&quot;) itself is presented to the city, which has commissioned a local artist (in the case of the Palio of July) or internationally recognized artist (in the case of the Palio of August or a special Palio) to create the prize. Also at this time, visits occur to the horses which will be presented for the lottery.

In the first of the four days of the festival, the lottery is held to select which &quot;barbero&quot; (the term for &#x27;racehorse&#x27; in the city of Siena and Tuscany) will go to which contrada. The stone race track around the square is covered with a layer of dirt composed of a mixture of tuff, clay and sand. Six trials are run, during which the riders have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with their horse and with the track itself, its sounds and rhythms of the race. The trials, &quot;Prova&quot;, are held the evening of the horse lottery and twice daily for the next two days. Attended by many tourists and &quot;contrada&quot; members in square, barriers are mounted on the outside of the track so no people may move in and out during the race. The children of the &quot;contrade&quot; are assembled in bleachers to sing closest to the city hall during the trials, but adults will sit there on the race day. Children are no longer allowed to stand in the middle of the piazza during the race, and can only view from a bleacher or window.

Among the events that mark the approach of the Palio are the rehearsal dinner, the &quot;mass&quot; of the jockeys and the blessing of the horse and jockey.

==Extraordinary Palios==
An extraordinary Palio is a third Palio which may take place during the period between May and September and is associated with events or anniversaries of major importance for the community of Siena. The most recent extraordinary Palio was held in 2018. An extraordinary Palio on 9 September 2000 coincided with the advent of the new millennium and was won by Selva (Forest), by jockey Giuseppe Pes riding on the horse Urban II. Prior to this, the last extraordinary Palio was held on 13 September 1986 to celebrate the centenary of the abolition of the Balia and Biccherna governments.

In earlier times, the third Palio was a way to honor distinguished guests passing through or visiting Siena. Examples are the extraordinary Palio of 7 June 1676, during the visit to Siena of the wife of Prince Don Agostino Chigi, and that of 15 June 1673 (not considered official), honouring the visit to Siena of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. Even the Grand Duke of Tuscany requested another round of Palio, perhaps closer to the ordinary.

From the second half of the 19th century, extraordinary Palios began to be organized for celebration of special events, rather than illustrious visits. This was the case of a meeting of the Society of Sciences or the inauguration of important monuments (such as the inauguration of the monument to the fallen in the Battle of Curtatone and Montanara, on 29 May 1893). In 1896, they even ran four Palios, both ordinary and two extraordinary. The first extraordinary race was on 16 August, which is considered extraordinary because it was requested by the citizens as the original race was moved to 25 August due to transfer from Siena&#x27;s VIII Corps, and the second was on 23 September for the inauguration of the monument to Giuseppe Garibaldi.

A third Palio, the &quot;Palio of Peace&quot;, was held in 1945 by popular acclaim to celebrate the end of World War II and was won by Gioacchino Calabro riding Rubacuori su Folco, for the &quot;contrada&quot; of Drago (Dragon). An extraordinary Palio was held in 1969 to commemorate the landing on the Moon by the Apollo 11 mission.

After 1945 the habit of running extraordinary palios to mark important centenaries emerged. A palio was held on 28 May 1950 to celebrate the five hundredth anniversary of the canonization of Saint Bernardine of Siena. On 5 June 1961 an extraordinary palio marked the centenary of unification. The most recent centenary palio, held on 20 October 2018, commemorated the ending of the First World War in 1918.

==Victories per &quot;contrada&quot;==
==Controversy and equine security measures==
For several years, the Palio has been the focus of numerous protests by animal-rights organizations, including the Anti-Vivisection League. Concerns include primarily race incidents causing falls, which in some cases have led to horses&#x27; deaths.

In 2011, these concerns resulted in Italy&#x27;s tourism minister blocking the Palio from being nominated for listing in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

The results of calculations on the percentage of accidents caused by the Palio vary depending on who makes them. According to the Anti-Vivisection League, a total of 48 horses have died from 1970 to 2007, an average of one dead horse per year. However, the calculations carried out by supporters of the Palio for the same period, which include all the tests held before the real race, give a rate of 2.05% of fatal accidents per ride.

Many rules governing the protection of animals have been developed and implemented only since the 1990s; supporters of the Palio stress that injuries have been drastically reduced since then.

In recent decades, the city of Siena has adopted a series of measures to ensure the protection of horses (and riders) before, during and after the race, but these measures are still judged insufficient by some animal welfare groups, who continue to seek abolition of the race. Among the measures taken include:

* A compulsory health check held by a commission appointed by the City Council and consisting of two surgeons
* Serum chemistry analysis, introduced in May 1999 in order to confirm and verify what has always been required by the Rules, or the prohibition of administration of substances with stimulants and depressants and local anesthetics

<text>Workplace OS is IBM&#x27;s ultimate operating system prototype of the 1990s. It is the product of an exploratory research program in 1991 which yielded a design called the Grand Unifying Theory of Systems (GUTS), proposing to unify the world&#x27;s systems as generalized &quot;personalities&quot; cohabitating concurrently upon a universally sophisticated platform of object-oriented frameworks upon one microkernel. Using personalities, a single machine would be able to run applications from multiple conventional operating systems like Unix and OS/2.

Within the AIM alliance, Apple demonstrated its mature Pink operating system prototype to IBM&#x27;s GUTS design team which was immediately heavily impressed and influenced. The result is Workplace OS, intended to improve software portability and maintenance costs by aggressively recruiting all operating system vendors to convert their products into Workplace OS personalities. That included Pink when it became Taligent, which was a pillar of AIM and co-developed with Workplace OS. In 1995, IBM reported that &quot;Nearly 20 corporations, universities, and research institutes worldwide have licensed the microkernel, laying the foundation for a completely open microkernel standard.&quot; Workplace OS was at the core of IBM&#x27;s new unified strategic direction for the entire company, and was intended also as a bellwether toward PowerPC hardware platforms, to compete with the Wintel duopoly.

With protracted development spanning four years and $2 billion (or 0.6% of IBM&#x27;s revenue for that period), the project suffered development hell characterized by workplace politics, feature creep, and the second-system effect. Many idealistic key assumptions made by IBM architects about software complexity and system performance were never tested until far too late in development, then proven infeasible. In January 1996, the first and only commercial preview was billed under the OS/2 family with the name &quot;OS/2 Warp Connect (PowerPC Edition)&quot; for limited special order by select IBM customers, as a crippled prototype. The entire Workplace OS platform was discontinued in March due to very low market demand, including that for enterprise PowerPC hardware.

A University of California case study described the Workplace OS project as &quot;one of the most significant operating systems software investments of all time&quot; and &quot;one of the largest operating system failures in modern times&quot;.

==Overview==
===Objective===
By 1990, IBM acknowledged the software industry to be in a state of perpetual crisis. This was due to the chaos from the inordinate complexity of software engineering inherited by its legacy of procedural programming practices since the 1960s. Large software projects were too difficult, fragile, expensive, and time-consuming to create and maintain; they required too many programmers, who were too busy with fixing bugs and adding incremental features to create new applications. Different operating systems were alien to each other, each of them running their own proprietary applications. IBM envisioned &quot;life after maximum entropy&quot; through &quot;operating systems unification at last&quot; and wanted to lay a new worldview for the future of computing.

IBM sought a new world view of a unified foundation for computing, based upon the efficient reuse of common work. It wanted to break the traditional monolithic software development cycle of producing alphas, then betas, then testing, and repeating over the entire operating system — instead, compartmentalizing the development and quality assurance of individual unit objects. This new theory of unifying existing legacy software and the new way of building all new software, was nicknamed the Grand Unified Theory of Systems or GUTS.

Coincidentally, Apple already had a two-year-old secret prototype of its microkernel-based object-oriented operating system with application frameworks, named Pink. The theory of GUTS was expanded by Pink, yielding Workplace OS.

===Architecture===
IBM described its new microkernel architecture as scalable, modular, portable, client/server distributed, and open and fully licensable both in binary and source code forms. This microkernel-based unified architecture was intended to allow all software to become scalable both upward into supercomputing space and downward into mobile and embedded space.

Leveraged upon a single microkernel, IBM wanted to achieve its grand goal of unification by simplifying complex development models into reusable objects and frameworks, and all while retaining complete backward compatibility with legacy and heritage systems. Multiple-library support would allow developers to progressively migrate select source code objects to 64-bit mode, with side-by-side selectable 32-bit and 64-bit modes. IBM&#x27;s book on Workplace OS says, &quot;Maybe we can get to a 64-bit operating system in our lifetime.&quot; IBM intended shareable objects to eventually reduce the footprint of each personality, scaling them down to a handheld computing profile.

At the base of Workplace OS is a fork of the Mach 3.0 microkernel (release mk68) originally developed by Carnegie Mellon University and heavily modified by the Open Software Foundation&#x27;s Research Institute. Officially named &quot;IBM Microkernel&quot;, it provides five core features: IPC, virtual memory support, processes and threads, host and processor sets, and I/O and interrupt support.

On top of the IBM Microkernel is a layer of shared services (originally called Personality Neutral Services or PNS) to cater to some or all of the personalities above them. Shared services are endian-neutral, have no user interface, and can serve other shared services. &quot;Byte&quot; summarizes that shared services &quot;can include not only low-level file system and device-driver services but also higher-level networking and even database services. [Workplace OS&#x27;s lead architect Paul Giangarra] believes that locating such application-oriented services close to the microkernel will improve their efficiency by reducing the number of function calls and enabling the service to integrate its own device drivers.&quot; This layer contains the file systems, the scheduler, network services, and security services. IBM first attempted a device driver model completely based in userspace to maximize its dynamic configuration, but later found the need to blend it between userspace and kernelspace, while keeping as much as possible in userspace. The Adaptive Driver Architecture (ADD) was designed for the creation of layered device drivers, which are easily portable to other hardware and operating system platforms beyond Workplace OS, and which consist of about 5000-8000 lines of device-specific code each. Some shared services are common only to select personalities, such as MMPM serving multimedia only to Windows 3.1 and OS/2 personalities, and which is alien or redundant to other markets.

Atop the shared services, another layer of userspace servers called personalities provide DOS, Windows, OS/2 (Workplace OS/2), and UNIX (WPIX) environments. The further hope was to support OS/400, AIX, Taligent OS, and MacOS personalities. Personalities provide environment subsystems to applications. Any one personality can be made dominant for a given version of the OS, providing the desktop user with a single GUI environment to accommodate the secondary personalities. In 1993, IBM intended one release version to be based upon the OS/2 Workplace Shell and another to be based upon the UNIX Common Desktop Environment (CDE).

IBM explained the branding: &quot;Workplace OS is the codename for a collection of operating system components including, among others, the IBM Microkernel and the OS/2 personality. Workplace OS/2 is the specific codename for the OS/2 personality. Workplace OS/2 will operate with the IBM Microkernel and can be considered OS/2 for the PowerPC.&quot; For the 1995 final preview release, IBM continued, &quot;When we stopped using the name &#x27;Workplace&#x27; and started calling the product &#x27;OS/2 for the PowerPC&#x27;, you might have thought that the &#x27;Workplace&#x27; was dead. But the &#x27;Workplace&#x27; is far from dead. It has simply been renamed for prime time.&quot; Workplace OS/2 was intended to define the future of OS/2, as a 32-bit clean platform and free of internal legacy, with perfect compatibility for source code of OS/2 applications and drivers. IBM originally wanted to prove new development models on Workplace OS/2 and backport them into OS/2 2.1 for x86 until the two platforms were unifiedespecially the IBM Microkernel, a new graphics subsystem, fully 32-bit system code with a flat memory model, Taligent, and OpenDoc.

IBM intended for Workplace OS to run on several processor architectures, including PowerPC, ARM, and x86 which would range in size from handheld PDAs to workstations to large 64-bit servers and supercomputers. IBM saw the easy portability of the Workplace OS as creating a simple migration path to move its existing x86 (DOS and OS/2) customer base onto a new wave of standard reference PowerPC-based systems, such as the PC Power Series and the Power Macintosh. Creating a unique but open and industry-standard reference platform of open-source microkernel, IBM hedged its company-wide operating system strategy by aggressively attempting to recruit other computer companies to adopt its microkernel as a basis for their own operating systems.

==History==
===Development===
====GUTS====
In January 1991, there was an internal presentation to the IBM Management Committee of a new strategy for operating system products. This included a chart called the Grand Unification Theory of Operating Systems (GUTS) which outlined how a single microkernel underlying common subsystems could provide a single unifying architecture for the world&#x27;s many existing and future operating systems. It was initially based in a procedural programming model, not object-oriented. The design elements of this plan had already been implemented on IBM&#x27;s RS/6000 platform via the System Object Model (SOM), a model which had already been delivered as integral to the OS/2 operating system.

Sometime later in 1991, as a result of the Apple/IBM business partnership, a small exploratory IBM team first visited the Taligent team, who demonstrated a relatively mature prototype operating system and programming model based entirely on Apple&#x27;s Pink project from 1987. There, GUTS&#x27;s goals were greatly impacted and expanded by exposure to these similar goals—especially advanced in the areas of aggressive object-orientation, and of software frameworks upon a microkernel. IBM&#x27;s optimistic team saw the Pink platform as being the current state of the art of operating system architecture. IBM wanted to adopt Pink&#x27;s more object-oriented programming model and framework-based system design, and add compatibility with legacy procedural programming along with the major concept of multiple personalities of operating systems, to create the ultimate possible GUTS model.
Through the historic Apple/IBM partnership, Apple&#x27;s CEO John Sculley said that the already volume-shipping OS/2 and MacOS would become unified upon the common PowerPC hardware platform to &quot;bring a renaissance to the industry&quot;.

In late 1991, a small team from Boca Raton and Austin began implementing the GUTS project, with the goal of proving the GUTS concept, by first converting the monolithic OS/2 2.1 system to the Mach microkernel, and yielding a demo. To gain shared access to key personnel currently working on the existing OS/2, they disguised the project as the Joint Design Task Force and brought &quot;a significant number&quot; of personnel from Boca, Austin (with LANs and performance), Raleigh (with SNA and other transport services), IBM Research (with operating systems and performance), and Rochester (with the 64-bit, object-oriented worldview from AS/400). Pleased with the robust, long-term mentality of the microkernel technology and with the progress of the project, the team produced a prototype in mid 1992. The initial internal-development prototypes ran on x86-based hardware and provided a BSD Unix derived personality and a DOS personality.

====Demos and business reorganization====
At Comdex in late 1992, the team flew in and assembled a private demonstration based on last-minute downloads to replace corrupted files and one hour of sleep. The presentation was so well received that the prototype was put on the trade show floor on Thursday, as the first public demonstration of the IBM Microkernel-based system running OS/2, DOS, 16-bit Windows, and UNIX applications. In 1992, IBM persuaded Taligent to migrate the Taligent OS from its internally developed microkernel named Opus, onto the IBM Microkernel. Ostensibly, this would have allowed Taligent&#x27;s operating system (implemented as a Workplace OS personality) to execute side-by-side with DOS and OS/2 operating system personalities.

In 1993, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; reported that Jim Cannavino &quot;has gone around the company and developer support for a plan to merge all of the company&#x27;s computing platforms—ES/9000, AS/400, RS/6000, and PS/2—around a single set of technologies, namely the PowerPC microprocessor, the Workplace OS operating system, and the Taligent object model, along with a series of open standards for cross-platform development, network interoperability, etc.&quot; On June 30, 1993, a presentation was given at the Boca Programming Center by Larry Loucks, IBM Fellow and VP of Software Architecture of the Personal Software Products (PSP) Division.
By 1993, IBM reportedly planned two packages of Workplace OS, based on personality dominance: one based on the OS/2 Workplace Shell and another based upon the UNIX Common Desktop Environment (CDE). IBM and Apple were speaking about the possibility of a Mac OS personality.

By January 1994, the IBM Power Personal Systems Division had still not yet begun testing its PowerPC hardware with any of its three intended launch operating systems: definitely AIX and Windows NT, and hopefully also Workplace OS. Software demonstrations showed limited personality support, with the dominant one being the OS/2 Workplace Shell desktop, and the DOS and UNIX personalities achieving only fullscreen text mode support with crude hotkey switching between the environments. &quot;Byte&quot; reported that the multiple personality support promised in Workplace OS&#x27;s conceptual ambitions was more straightforward, foundational, and robust than that of the already-shipping Windows NT. The magazine said &quot;IBM is pursuing multiple personalities, while Microsoft appears to be discarding them&quot; while conceding that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to create a robust plan than a working operating system with robust implementations of multiple personalities&quot;.

In 1994, the industry was reportedly shifting away from monolithic development and even application suites, toward object-oriented, component-based, crossplatform, application frameworks.

By 1995, Workplace OS was becoming notable for its many and repeated launch delays, with IBM described as being inconsistent and &quot;wishy washy&quot; with dates. This left IBM&#x27;s own PowerPC hardware products without a mainstream operating system, forcing the company to at least consider the rival Windows NT. In April 1994, &quot;Byte&quot; reported that under lead architect Paul Giangarra, IBM had staffed more than &quot;400 people working to bring [Workplace OS] up on Power Personal hardware&quot;.

In May 1994, the RISC Systems software division publicly announced IBM&#x27;s first attempt to even study the feasibility of converting AIX into a Workplace OS personality, which the company had been publicly promising since the beginning. One IBM Research Fellow led a team of fewer than ten, to identify and address the problem. The team defined the AIX personality problem as being the fundamentally incompatible byte ordering between the big-endian AIX and the little-endian Workplace OS. This problem is endemic, because though the PowerPC CPU and Workplace OS can perform in either mode, endianness is a systemwide configuration set once at boot time only; and Workplace OS favors OS/2 which comes from the little-endian Intel x86 architecture. After seven months of silence on the issue, IBM announced in January 1995 that the intractable endianness problem had resulted in the total abandonment of the flagship plan for an AIX personality.

In late 1994, as Workplace OS approached its first beta version, IBM referred to the beta product as &quot;OS/2 for the PowerPC&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Just Good Old OS/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As the project&#x27;s first deliverable product, this first beta was released to select developers on the Power Series 440 in December 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/2 for PowerPC Tidbits&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A second beta was released in 1995. By 1995, IBM had shipped two different releases of an application sampler CD for the beta OS.

====Preview launch====
In mid 1995, IBM officially named its planned initial Workplace OS release &quot;OS/2 Warp Connect (PowerPC Edition)&quot; with the codename &quot;Falcon&quot;. In October 1995, IBM announced the upcoming first release, though still a developer preview. The announcement predicted it to have version 1.0 of the IBM Microkernel with the OS/2 personality and a new UNIX personality, on PowerPC. Having been part of the earliest demonstrations, the UNIX personality was now intended to be offered to customers as a holdover due to the nonexistence of a long-awaited AIX personality, but the UNIX personality was also abandoned prior to release.

This developer release is the first ever publication of Workplace OS, and of the IBM Microkernel (at version 1.0), which IBM&#x27;s internal developers had been running privately on Intel and PowerPC hardware. The gold master was produced on December 15, 1995 with availability on January 5, 1996, only to existing Power Series hardware customers who paid $215&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/2 Beta FAQ&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; for a special product request through their IBM representative, who then relayed the request to the Austin research laboratory. The software essentially appears to the user as the visually identical and source-compatible PowerPC equivalent of the mainstream OS/2 3.0 for Intel. Packaged as two CDs with no box, its accompanying overview paper booklet calls it the &quot;final edition&quot; but it is still a very incomplete product intended only for developers. Its installer only supports two computer models, the IBM PC Power Series 830 and 850 which have PowerPC 604 CPUs of , of RAM, and IDE drives. Contrary to the product&#x27;s &quot;Connect&quot; name, the installed operating system has no networking support. However, full networking functionality is described within the installed documentation files, and in the related book &quot;IBM&#x27;s Official OS/2 Warp Connect PowerPC Edition: Operating in the New Frontier&quot; (1995) — all of which the product&#x27;s paper booklet warns the user to disregard. The kernel dumps debugging data to the serial console.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/2 on ThinkPad 850&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The system hosts no compiler, so developers are required to cross-compile applications on the source-compatible OS/2 for Intel system, using MetaWare’s High C compiler or VisualAge C++, and manually copy the files via relocatable medium to run them.

With an officially concessionary attitude, IBM had no official plans for a general release packaged for OEMs or retail, beyond this developer preview available only via special order from the development lab. Upon its launch, Joe Stunkard, spokesman for IBM&#x27;s Personal Systems Products division, said &quot;When and if the Power market increases, we&#x27;ll increase the operating system&#x27;s presence as required.&quot; On January 26, 1996, an Internet forum statement was made by John Soyring, IBM&#x27;s Vice President of Personal Software Products: &quot;We are not planning additional releases of the OS/2 Warp family on the PowerPC platform during 1996 — as we &quot;just&quot; released in late December 1995 the OS/2 Warp (PowerPC Edition) product. ... We have just not announced future releases on the PowerPC platform. In no way should our announcement imply that we are backing away from the PowerPC.&quot;

====Roadmap====
On November 22, 1995, IBM&#x27;s developer newsletter said, &quot;Another focus of the 1996 product strategy will be the IBM Microkernel and microkernel-based versions of OS/2 Warp. Nearly 20 corporations, universities, and research institutes worldwide have licensed the microkernel, laying the foundation for a completely open microkernel standard.&quot; IBM planned a second feature-parity release for x86 and PowerPC in 1996, and version 2.0 of the microkernel was &quot;distributed to microkernel adopters&quot; early that year. This version was described as final, with support for x86 and ARM processors. IBM reportedly tested OS/2 on the never-released x86-compatible PowerPC 615.

At this point, the several-year future roadmap of Workplace OS included IBM Microkernel 2.0 and was intended to subsume the fully converged future of the OS/2 platform starting after the future release of OS/2 version 4, including ports to Pentium, Pentium Pro, MIPS, ARM, and Alpha CPUs.

===Discontinuation===
The Workplace OS project was finally canceled in March 1996 due to myriad factors: inadequate performance; low acceptance of the PowerPC Reference Platform; poor quality of the PowerPC 620 launch; extensive cost overruns; lack of AIX, Windows, or OS/400 personalities; and the overall low customer demand. The only mainstream desktop operating system running on PowerPC was Windows NT, which also lacked supply and demand. Industry analysts said that &quot;the industry may have passed by the PowerPC&quot;. In 1996, IBM also closed the Power Personal Division responsible for personal PowerPC systems. IBM stopped developing new operating systems, and instead committed heavily to Linux, Java, and some Windows. In 2012, IBM described Linux as the &quot;universal platform&quot; in a way that happens to coincide with many of the essential design objectives of GUTS.

==Reception==
===Industrial reception===
Reception was enthusiastically but skeptically mixed, as the young IT industry was already constantly grappling with the second-system effect, and was now presented with Workplace OS and PowerPC hardware as the ultimate second system duo to unify all preceding and future systems. On November 15, 1993, &quot;InfoWorld&quot;″s concerns resembled the Osborne effect: &quot;Now IBM needs to talk about this transition without also telling its customers to stop buying all the products it is already selling. Tough problem. Very little of the new platform that IBM is developing will be ready for mission-critical deployment until 1995 or 1996. So the company has to dance hard for two and maybe three years to keep already disaffected customers on board.&quot;

In 1994, an extensive analysis by &quot;Byte&quot; reported that the multiple personality concept in Workplace OS&#x27;s beta design was more straightforward, foundational, and robust than that of the already-shipping Windows NT. It said &quot;IBM is pursuing multiple personalities, while Microsoft appears to be discarding them&quot; and conceded that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to create a robust plan than a working operating system with robust implementations of multiple personalities&quot;.

Upon the January 1996 developer final release, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; relayed the industry&#x27;s dismay that the preceding two years of delays had made the platform &quot;too little, too late&quot;, &quot;stillborn&quot;, and effectively immediately discontinued. An analyst was quoted, &quot;The customer base would not accept OS/2 and the PowerPC at the same time&quot; because by the time IBM would eventually ship a final retail package of OS/2 on PowerPC machines, &quot;the power/price ratio of the PowerPC processor just wasn&#x27;t good enough to make customers accept all of the other drawbacks&quot; of migrating to a new operating system alone.

In 2013, &quot;Ars Technica&quot; retrospectively characterized the years of hype surrounding Workplace OS as supposedly being &quot;the ultimate operating system, the OS to end all OSes ... It would run on every processor architecture under the sun, but it would mostly showcase the power of POWER. It would be all-singing and all-dancing.&quot;

===Internal analysis===
In January 1995, four years after the conception and one year before the cancellation of Workplace OS, IBM announced the results of a very late stage analysis of the project&#x27;s initial assumptions. This concluded that it is impossible to unify the inherent disparity in endianness between different proposed personalities of legacy systems, resulting in the total abandonment of the flagship plan for an AIX personality.

In May 1997, one year after its cancellation, one of its architects reflected back on the intractable problems of the project&#x27;s software design and the limits of available hardware.

===Academic analysis===
In September 1997, a case study of the history of the development of Workplace OS was published by the University of California with key details having been verified by IBM personnel. These researchers concluded that IBM had relied throughout the project&#x27;s history upon multiple false assumptions and overly grandiose ambitions, and had failed to apprehend the inherent difficulty of implementing a kernel with multiple personalities. IBM considered the system mainly as its constituent components and not as a whole, in terms of system performance, system design, and corporate personnel organization. IBM had not properly researched and proven the concept of generalizing all these operating system personalities before starting the project, or at any responsible timeframe during it — especially its own flagship AIX. IBM assumed that all the resultant performance issues would be mitigated by eventual deployment upon PowerPC hardware. The Workplace OS product suffered the second-system effect, including feature creep, with thousands of global contributing engineers across many disparate business units nationwide. The Workplace OS project had spent four years and $2 billion (or 0.6% of IBM&#x27;s revenue for that period), which the report described as &quot;one of the most significant operating systems software investments of all time&quot; and &quot;one of the largest operating system failures in modern times&quot;.

<doc id="1044501" wikidata="Q4391491" url="?curid=1044501" title="Robert Carney">
<text>Robert Bostwick Carney (March 26, 1895 – June 25, 1990) was an admiral in the United States Navy who served as commander-in-chief of the NATO forces in Southern Europe (1951–1953) and then as Chief of Naval Operations (1953–1954) during the Eisenhower administration. He was the father in law of Joseph K. Taussig Jr.

==Early years==
Born in Vallejo, California, Carney graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1916. He served in World War I, seeing combat against German U-boats.

==Between wars==
Carney served as Flag Secretary to Admiral Louis R. de Steiguer during the mid-1920s during de Steiguer&#x27;s time in command of various battleship forces. Their relationship was not happy, mainly due to de Steiguer&#x27;s imperious manner described by Carney as &quot;constant pressure, irascibility, criticism, and unpleasantness&quot;.

Famously, Carney eventually marched into de Steiguer&#x27;s cabin, snapped, &quot;Admiral, I just want to tell you I think you are a goddamn rotten son of a bitch,&quot; and stormed out. After failing to retrieve Carney with a Marine orderly, de Steiguer visited Carney&#x27;s cabin in person, said, &quot;Sonny, you&#x27;ve been working too hard. You and I are going ashore&quot; after which he took Carney on an epic drinking binge. Carney ultimately concluded that his three years with de Steiguer had been a valuable experience, but not one he would have chosen to repeat.

==World War II==
In February 1941, then Commander Carney was recalled from duty in the Pacific to assist in organizing, equipping, and training a special Surface-Air Force, having as its mission the protection of shipping against submarine and air attack. This force became fully involved in convoy escort prior to the involvement of the United States into the war. From September 13, 1941, until April 1942, this force, under command of Vice Admiral Arthur L. Bristol, Jr., escorted over 2,600 ships on the ocean lanes while suffering the loss of only six ships.

From October 15, 1942, until July 1943 Carney commanded the cruiser in the Pacific Theater. He was twice decorated for engagements in the Solomon Islands campaign, earning the Bronze Star Medal with Combat &quot;V&quot; for meritorious service as Commanding Officer of &quot;Denver&quot; while attached to a task group of Admiral William Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet during operations against the Japanese-held islands of Kolombangara and Shortland. Off Bougainville the night of July 26, 1943 he took advantage of poor weather to lay a large quantity of mines along sea lanes around the island, and then delivered a naval bombardment against the Japanese shore installations.

On July 29, 1943, Carney was appointed chief of staff to Halsey, and was promoted to rear admiral. At the time Halsey was Commander, South Pacific Force, a responsibility which included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. Carney later wrote that &quot;Admiral Halsey unfailingly gave credit to his subordinates for successes achieved, and took all blame for failures on his own shoulders.&quot; While in this assignment, Carney was awarded his second Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his contributions to the overall strategy and in organizing the logistic support of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific, the citation stating, in part:
When Halsey assumed command of the Third Fleet in the Central Pacific in June 1944, Carney accompanied him as Chief of Staff. Carney participated in the amphibious invasions of Palau and Lingayen, and the naval Battle of Leyte Gulf. It was during this engagement that Carney famously confronted an enraged Halsey. During Halsey&#x27;s run to the north in tracking down the Japanese carriers, he received numerous calls from Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid&#x27;s Seventh Fleet, whose escort carriers were under attack from a Japanese battle group of battleships, cruisers and destroyers. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, an anxious message was received from Admiral Chester Nimitz: &quot;Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders&quot;. The tail end of this message, The world wonders, was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The inquiry appeared to be a rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing. Finally Carney confronted him, telling Halsey &quot;Stop it! What the hell&#x27;s the matter with you? Pull yourself together.&quot; Halsey regained his composure, and later turned the fleet south to support Seventh Fleet.

Later, Carney continued to assist Halsey as Chief of Staff during his operations in the Okinawa campaign and the carrier air raids against Japanese air fields in Vietnam and Formosa in the South China Sea. In 1945, Third Fleet was striking targets in the Japanese homeland itself, launching attacks on Tokyo, the naval base at Kure and the northern Japanese island of Hokkaidō, as well as the bombardments of a number of Japanese coastal cities in preparation for a possible invasion of Japan which never happened.

Carney arranged with Japanese emissaries for the entry of the Third Fleet into Tokyo Bay, accepted the surrender of Yokosuka Naval Base and surrounding area from Vice Admiral Michitaro Totsuka of the Imperial Japanese Navy, and attended the ceremony for the surrender of Japan held on board Halsey&#x27;s flagship, the battleship .

==Post-war==

In 1946, Carney was promoted to vice admiral and, until February 1950, served as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. He then assumed command of the Second Fleet operating on the East Coast of the United States. On October 2, 1950, Carney was advanced in rank to admiral.

From 1951 to 1953, Carney served as Commander-in-Chief of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#x27;s Allied Forces Southern Europe, where he was responsible for the fleets of five countries and the armed forces of Italy, Greece and Turkey.

On May 13, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower selected Carney as the next Chief of Naval Operations. On completion of this assignment, Carney retired from active service in the Navy.

Over the next several years, Carney&#x27;s various assignments, coupled with his personal interest in industrial participation in the defense effort, resulted in close contact with industry including the position of chairman of the board, Bath Iron Works, Corporation.

Carney died of cardiac arrest in Washington, D.C., on June 25, 1990, at the age of 95. He and his wife are buried at Arlington National Cemetery. and Carney Park were named in his honor.

<text>Novocherkassk () is a city in Rostov Oblast, Russia, located near the confluence of the Tuzlov and Aksay Rivers, the latter a distributary of the Don River. Novocherkassk is best known as the cultural capital of the Cossacks, and as the official capital of the Don Cossacks. Population: 

==History==
===Imperial era===
====Foundation====
Although the first settlement in the region was founded by Temroqwa Idar, the city of Novocherkassk was founded in 1805 by Lieutenant-general Matvei Platov, the Ataman of the Don Cossacks, as the administrative center of the Don Host Oblast. It was established in reaction to the original administrative center, the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Cherkassk, being deemed unsuitable as the capital for the Don Cossacks for several reasons. Cherkassk was repeatedly flooded for long periods of time due to its low-lying location on the banks of the Don River, and attempts at constructing levees to protect the town were found to be too costly and ineffective. Additionally, Cherkassk was prone to destructive fires due to its chaotic layout and wooden buildings, and was located far away from any major roads. Despite the fact that ten of the eleven representatives of the villages that were part of Cherkassk refused to move the capital, Platov still made a presentation to Tsar Alexander I asking him to allow the capital of the Don Cossacks to be moved to another location, and was granted permission in a decree from the Tsar on August 23, 1804.

====Plan as new capital of the Don Cossacks====
Platov and the engineer François Sainte de Wollant developed Novocherkassk as a planned city, deciding to build it on a location at the top of a hill known as the &quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot; to the north of Cherkassk, near the confluence of the Tuzlov River and Aksay River. On November 7, 1804, De Wollant and Platov presented to Tsar Alexander a plan for the future of the city and an extensive report, in which the clearly embellished merits of the area chosen for construction were described. The city was designed in the popular traditions of European models of urban development, with spacious areas, wide avenues and boulevards full of greenery. De Wollant, calling the future Novocherkassk &quot;little Paris&quot; on the basis of numerous town squares, each of which was supposed to feature a church, and to have streets beginning radially around each square. On December 31, 1804, after reviewing the plan and the report of Platov and De Wollant, Tsar Alexander personally inscribed: &quot;To be according to this. Alexander&quot;. The construction of the city was slow, primarily because of the reluctance of most Don Cossacks to leave their homes in Cherkassk, and the new capital being from the River Don, with which the Cossacks were closely connected throughout its history. To compensate, there were even plans to deepen the Aksay River (a distributary of the Don) where the new city was located to eventually alter the course of the Don through the city. This plan was abandoned due to lack of funds, and for more than three decades the question of the place of the capital of the Don Cossack remained unresolved, while growth of Novocherkassk stagnated.

By 1837, an alternative to transfer the capital to the village of Aksayskoy, which was also on a hill and near the Don, gained popularity. However, Tsar Nicholas I personally inspected Novocherkassk and the village of Aksayskoy that same year, and after returning to Saint Petersburg ordered the Don Cossacks to keep the capital in Cherkassk because of the difficulties and uselessness of the transfer. In the first half of the 19th century, Novocherkassk was built only as an army center, administrative buildings, guest yards, taverns, wine cellars, hotels, and generals and noblemen&#x27;s houses. In the 1850s, industrialization reached Novocherkassk and industrial enterprises were formed, however only one-thousand of the city&#x27;s twenty-thousand residents worked in them.

===Soviet era===
On the eve of the February Revolution, Novocherkassk had a population of about sixty thousand people, about twenty-five thousand of whom were serving Cossacks and their families, three thousand were noblemen, and about five hundred were clergymen. Novocherkassk, unlike many Russian cities at the time, had almost no permanent merchants or peasants. During the Russian Civil War from 1917 to 1922, Novocherkassk was the center of the Don Army counter-revolution and came under the command of General Alexey Kaledin. The Red Army eventually defeated ousted the White-aligned Don Army from Novocherkassk on January 7, 1920.

During World War II, the Wehrmacht of Nazi Germany occupied Novocherkassk between July 24, 1942 and February 13, 1943. The city was chosen as the headquarters of the Don Army Group, headed by Erich v. Manstein in November of 42’.

On June 1–2, 1962, events known as the Novocherkassk massacre occurred when food riots and workers rights protests broke out following a labor strike at the locomotive factory, the Novocherkassk Electric Locomotive Plant, in the city. The protests were suppressed by troops of the Soviet Army, resulting in 26 protesters being killed and 87 being wounded.

On November 20, 1990, Andrei Chikatilo, one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s most prolific serial killers, with 56 convicted murders, was arrested in Novocherkassk. On 14 February 1994, he was taken from his death row cell to a soundproofed room in Novocherkassk prison and executed with a single gunshot behind the right ear. He was buried in an unmarked grave at the prison cemetery.

===Recent history===
On October 5–6, 1991, a meeting of the Grand Circle of the Union of Cossacks of the Don Military Region took place, where the status of the historical and modern center of the Don Cossacks was established in the city, officially making Novocherkassk the capital of the Don Cossacks. On July 17–18, 1993, a meeting of the United Supreme Circle of Cossack troops of Russia and abroad was held in Moscow, where Novocherkassk was proclaimed the world capital of the Cossacks.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Novocherkassk Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.

==Economy==
Novocherkassk NEVZ ElektroVagon Plant, trains and locomotives.

==Culture and religion==

Novocherkassk was once an archiepiscopal see of the Greek Orthodox Church and has a huge neo-Byzantine cathedral (1904), as well as the Church of Our Lady of the Don (2013), St. George&#x27;s Church and Sts. Constantine and Helen Church, the palace of the ataman of the Cossacks, and monuments to Matvei Platov and Yermak Timofeyevich (Mikhail Mikeshin, 1904). During the bicentenary celebrations in September 2005 another monument, dedicated to the reconciliation of White and Red Cossacks, was opened in the presence of the members of the Romanov family.

In 1856, the Trinity Church was built, but later it was destroyed.

<doc id="1044506" wikidata="Q942071" url="?curid=1044506" title="Itapetininga">
<text>Itapetininga is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The population is 165,526 (2020 est.) in an area of 1790 km2. The name comes from a Tupi-Guarani language, meaning &quot;dry stone&quot;.

The city is the seat of the Government Region of Itapetininga, made up of twelve other municipalities: Alambari, Angatuba, Boituva, Campina do Monte Alegre, Capela do Alto, Cerquilho, Cesário Lange, Guareí, Quadra, São Miguel Arcanjo, Sarapuí and Tatuí, which together have more than 520 thousand inhabitants.

It is situated in the southern part of the state, and is known as &quot;cidade das escolas&quot;, meaning city of schools in Portuguese.

==History==

Itapetininga developed along with the &quot;tropeirismo&quot; (Trooping), as a resting point of the cattle dealers, who were mounting groups and villages for the landing, before they travel towards the South. The first nucleus of cattle dealers in the region of Itapetininga appeared in 1724, when it was discovered that the pasture in the region was abundant and the land was fertile for planting. To these factors there was added up the distance to the Sorocaba town - 12 leagues - that was corresponding to a journey of a troop. About 1760, a group of Portuguese, led by Domingos José Vieira, left the first nucleus (today, district of Porto) and formed another, in a high place and surrounded by two streams.

At this time there was an argument between two nucleuses that wanted to be elevated to the condition of town. The results: on April 17, 1770, Simão Barbosa Franco was nominated to establish and administering the new village, and so was left to him the choice of the principal nucleus. Historians tell that a &quot;marching&quot; mule, offered as a present to Simão Barbosa Franco, guaranteed the victory to Domingos José Vieira. The town of &quot;Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres de Itapetininga&quot; was officially created on November 5, 1770, when a solemn mass was celebrated by the vicar of the new parish, Priest Inácio of Araújo Ferreira. It is in this date that was agreed to commemorate the anniversary of the municipality.

Besides Simão Barbosa Franco and Domingos José Vieira, an Itu town citizen. Salvador de Oliveira Leme (-nicknamed Sarutayá )- has been included among the historical founders of the municipality, since he was the second captain-mor of Itapetininga (the first one was Domingos José Vieira). The emancipation of the Town of Itapetininga happened in 1852, through the Law nº 11, on July 7, 1852. The law granted judicial autonomy, thus creating to judicature of Itapetininga. The town, however, only became a municipality, in fact, on March 13, 1855 with the name of Itapetininga.

The holy patron of Itapetininga is Our Lady of the Pleasures.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

Although the parent club Vålerengens Idrettsforening was founded in 1913, the history of Vålerenga Ishockey starts in 1947, when the junior team participated in the national junior championships for the first time. In the 50s, the junior team won the national junior championships five years in a row.

=== First dynasty (1960–1973) ===

Vålerenga won their first national championship in 1960, taking over the throne from local rivals Gamlebyen. More championships were won in 1962 and 1963. From 1965 to 1971, Vålerenga won the championship seven times in a row, a feat not repeated in Norwegian hockey since. Notable players from this era include Arne &quot;Mikkel&quot; Mikkelsen, Steinar &quot;Bjølle&quot; Bjølbakk, Tor &quot;Jern-Gustav&quot; Gundersen, and notably, Roy &quot;Sleipern&quot; Jansen. Another title was added in 1973, but this also marked the end of the first dynasty as the club faced a generational change.

=== A new generation (1982–1994) ===

Ten years went by before Vålerenga could celebrate another championship, in 1983. A new generation had emerged, and players such as Jim Marthinsen, Roy Johansen, Geir Myhre, Tor Helge &quot;Totto&quot; Eikeland, Bjørn Kolsrud, Arne Billkvam and Jon Magne Karlstad would go on to become club legends. In 1988, Vålerenga won their 15th title. The next season saw the debut of Espen Knutsen, who would later become the first Vålerenga product to play in the National Hockey League.

=== Recent era ===

This marked the start of another dynasty for Vålerenga and the club added several more titles in the 1990s. Kent Forsberg became head coach in 1994 and invited his son Peter and Markus Näslund to play a friendly match for the club during the lockout season in the NHL. The 20th national championship was won in 1999. Notable players from this era include Morten Ask, Kenneth Larsen, and Kjell Richard &quot;Ricky&quot; Nygaard, along with Swedish imports such as Johan Brummer, Patric Englund and Niklas Gällstedt. Six more championships were added after 2000, the last being won in 2009. Vålerenga were in talks to join the Kontinental Hockey League in 2014, but the plans didn&#x27;t go through.

Vålerenga&#x27;s home arena through six decades, Jordal Amfi, was demolished in January 2017 and replaced by new arena, completed in the fall of 2020 after construction delays.

<text> (Lit. translation: &quot;The Class Struggle&quot;) is a Norwegian daily newspaper in print and online. Its tagline is &quot;The daily newspaper of the Left&quot;. The paper&#x27;s net circulation is 33,265 (2022), and it has around 111,000 daily readers on paper (160,000 on Saturdays). This makes it the third largest Norwegian print newspaper, based on readership. Chief editor from 2018 is Mari Skurdal.

 started out in early 1969 as a monthly periodical published by a group of Oslo-based Marxist-Leninists, with Pål Steigan as a key founder and Anders M. Andersen as the first editor. It promoted the positions of the Workers&#x27; Communist Party (AKP; founded 1973) and its predecessors. became a weekly in January 1973, a bi-weekly in January 1976 and finally a daily newspaper in April 1977. It was the official organ of the AKP until April 1991. Its mission statement now describes itself as &quot;revolutionary socialist.&quot; As with most Norwegian newspapers, it relies on financial support from the Norwegian government. 

 has received praise for its critical political and economic journalism, but also accusations of promoting Russian propaganda, transphobia, trans-exclusionary radical feminism, and Holocaust revisionism, which the paper&#x27;s chief editor has denied. Despite its overt political position, enjoys a wide readership both within the business class and the broader Norwegian society. 

== History ==

=== 1969–1972: Monthly paper for the marxist-leninist movement ===
 was initiated in 1968 by a group of young communists, members of SUF(m-l), the youth organization of the socialist Sosialistisk Folkeparti (SF). Pål Steigan, Tron Øgrim and Sigmund Grønmo were key figures, The first issue was published on February 7, 1969, coinciding with the annual convention of the SF, at which a left-wing opposition broke with the party, as did SUF (m-l). In the first period the paper was published as a monthly periodical by &quot;a group of marxist-leninists&quot;. According to Steigan, the name was proposed by Øgrim, the name indicating that it intended to play a larger role than being the monthly periodical of a youth organization. The newspaper&#x27;s stated goal was to strengthen the Marxist–Leninist movement and lay the foundations for a new communist party in Norway. At the same time, it set itself the goal of becoming a working class newspaper.

As a monthly, had no paid staff. The editorial work, the printing as well as sales were carried out by volunteers. The first printing press was financed mostly by young people taking summer jobs or being newspaper couriers (for other newspapers) before school hours. Due to the progress of the m-l-movement and its high level of activity, sales and circulation increased rapidly: the first issue in 1969 was printed in 3,500 copies. The circulation passed 10,000 in 1970, and 20,000 in 1971. Labour Day was always an important sales day, and the May 1st issue of 1972 was published in 45,000.

During the period as a monthly newspaper, also published a number of extra issues on current issues and leaflet-like printed matter. From 1972 the paper was officially linked to the Marxist–Leninist Groups (MLG), which was a forerunner of the Workers&#x27; Communist Party (AKP (m-l)). At the same time, fundraising and recruitment of subscribers was started with a plan of weekly publication.

=== 1973–1976: Weekly newspaper for AKP(m-l) ===
In January 1973, became a weekly newspaper. Shortly afterwards, it became the formal party organ for the newly formed AKP (m-l).

As a weekly, got its own editorial offices in Oslo for the first time, as well as a paid editorial staff. Still, much of the volunteer spirit continued, with groups of party members and sympathizers contributing in special editorial fields. In 1974, a campaign was launched to link &quot;workers&#x27; correspondents&quot; to the newspaper. After two years as a weekly, it was summarized that a third of the newspaper was written by the permanent editorial staff, a third by the volunteer staff and a third by workers&#x27; correspondents and readers. The proportion of workplace reports doubled from 1973 to 1974.

The winter of 1973 the weekly newspaper had a circulation of 13,000. The fall of 1974 it had increased to 19,000 and two years later 27,000. During the years 1973–1976 11,000 new subscribers were enrolled, and door-to-door sales were effectively organized. From January 1976, was published twice a week, as an escalation before the transition to daily publications. In order to prepare for this transition, a major fundraising campaign was also carried out for investing in the paper&#x27;s own rotary printing plant. The &quot;rotation campaign&quot; started little by little in 1974 and was not completed until just before the daily newspaper was launched. At that time, NOK 5,631,000 had been collected.

In the pre-daily period, disclosed several classified military documents. In May 1971, it was shown that a NATO exercise had exemplified revolutionary groups, Vietnam War activists and trade unionists as enemies of the state. During an exercise in 1973, the paper disclosed that opponents of NATO membership and student groups had been &quot;assigned&quot; this role. In 1976, the paper carried a series of articles by Jon Michelet about the Soviet presence at Svalbard, suggesting that the Soviet Union might be constructing a military base at Cape Heer, thus violating the Svalbard Treaty. These reports were later developed into Michelet&#x27;s novel &quot;Orion&#x27;s Belt&quot; and a movie with the same name.

=== 1977–1991: Daily newspaper for AKP (m-l) ===
From April 1, 1977, switched to daily publication (except Sundays). At that time, the rotary press and editorial offices were installed on Bryn in Oslo. In the first years as a daily newspaper, was edited strictly according to party guidelines.

The operation of the daily newspaper was more resource-intensive than anticipated, not least financially. Income from advertising was scarce. In addition, AKP (m-l) had adopted a policy of &quot;self-support&quot; and therefore did not accept the state support that was entitled to. The newspaper was to be built entirely on the support of the readers. This policy hit the wall in 1978, and bankruptcy was just around the corner. A new fundraiser avoided immediate collapse, but the party had to accept state aid. In November 1979, could announce that &quot;the daily is saved!&quot; This of course had a cost: The paper was cut from 16 to 12 pages most days, and the staff was reduced heavily. District offices in Bergen, Trondheim and Tromsø had to close, and special editions in Sàmi, English and Spanish were stopped, as were publications aimed specially at immigrant workers and at farmers/fishermen.

The party had also decided that the paper should build up its own courier service. Unpaid volunteers delivered the newspaper to the subscribers in major cities every evening or night. This was partly for economic reasons, partly as a security measure – AKP did not want to hand over the list of subscribers to someone else. (The parliamentary &quot;Lund Report&quot; concerning the Norwegian secret services later confirmed that subscribing to could be a reason for registration.) The courier system meant great strain on the party organization that, literally, carried the newspaper. From late 1979 the system was discontinued in most of Norway, but in some parts of Oslo it was effective for a decade.

In 1977, criminal charges were brought against then editor Finn Sjue for the paper&#x27;s disclosures of secret NATO exercise telegrams. Two years later he was sentenced to ten days in prison or a fine of NOK 2,500. The sentence was later confirmed by the Supreme Court with a 3–2 vote.

During the 1980s, managed to get national acclaim for its journalism in certain focus areas. Journalist Per Bangsund specialized in the growth of right wing extremism and neo-nazism in Norway and had contacts regarding this within the secret services. A group for investigative journalism (with among others Alf R. Jacobsen) was established, possibly the first in Norway. A focus area for this group was tax evasions among business people and top politicians. Finn Sjue, now as a journalist, dug into illegal or semi-illegal surveillance practices by the secret services towards organizations, politicians and activists on the left. Furthermore, the paper had broad international coverage, partly through AKP&#x27;s party contacts, but through the years also through extensive travel activities by its own staff. The Middle East, Horn of Africa, Eastern Europe, Central America and Northern Ireland was prioritized. In 1983, journalist Kjell Gjerseth received the Narvesen Prize, at that time the highest ranked journalism award in Norway, for his reports from Afghanistan in the early years of the Soviet occupation.

The Lund Report in 1996 stated that the telephones in offices had been tapped by the Secret Services from 1976 until 1979. Furthermore, the names of employees, contributors, subscribers and street vendors had been registered.

In 1979, Sigurd Allern was hired as editor for a new period. He held this position until 1995 and was vital in the editorial development of the daily. Also being a member of the AKP central committee, he managed pragmatically to professionalize the paper without creating too much discontent in the party. The editorial directive was in effect discontinued. Still, there were some conflict points between the party and the staff. In 1984–1985 this culminated, when a group of journalists organized a strike protesting on the paper&#x27;s employment policy. The strike lasted only a couple of hours, but led to a long-lasting internal conflict in the paper and the party. At the same time, the Norwegian Graphical Union decided to exclude all members at Duplotrykk, print shop, on the grounds that they had accepted hours and pay grade outside of the tariff regulations.

====Accusation of Holocaust revisionism====
Historian Torkel Brekke argues that Klassekampen in the 1970s promoted a form of Holocaust revisionism that constituted &quot;trivialization and relativization of the Holocaust which is close to what we find on the extreme right,&quot; including a series of articles in which the newspaper claimed that the Zionists were complicit in the genocide against the Jews in Europe.

=== 1991–1999: New orientation ===

==== The Allern years ====

The process of liberating the paper from party ties, peaked in April 1991, when no longer reckoned itself party organ of AKP. A new purpose clause stated that the paper should carry serious critical journalism with &quot;disclosures of all kinds of exploitation, oppression and environmental destruction&quot; as well as inspire and contribute to &quot;ideological criticism, organizing and political struggle&quot; from a &quot;revolutionary, socialist viewpoint&quot;. This change had been approved by the party, that however still would own 80 percent of the shares in the publishing company with the same name. This &quot;liberation process&quot; followed the general line among Norwegian papers, as also conservative and Labour media gained more independence in these years.

Helped by state support, frequent fundraising campaigns and an increasing circulation, the 1980s had passed without any financial catastrophes, but the economy was still tight. A system with regular contributions from the readers had been started in 1983 (&quot;Else Berg memorial fund&quot;). In late 1991 this was formalized into the support organization &quot;Friends of Klassekampen&quot;, that was given the remaining 20 percent of the shares and a seat in the company board. Together with a big fundraiser this provided means for a renewal in design and editorial focus. The circulation increased to more than 10,000 in 1992, but then &quot;Klassekampen&quot; lost momentum. It did not manage to use the 1994 referendum on EU membership, where the paper was among with a clear stand against, for increased growth. In early 1995, Duplotrykk – the paper&#x27;s own printing company – went bankrupt. After this, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; has been printed by commercial suppliers.

Internal conflicts in the staff were frequent. Editor Sigurd Allern had a rather authoritarian style of leadership, that did not suit the liberated situation and hindered the creative capabilities of the staff. An expansion of the Saturday edition in 1994 was forced through by Allern against the will of the journalists, the marketing department, the CFO and a minority of the board. He (supported by the majority of the board) also pursued a strategy of a still broader ownership and had talks with Kristen Nygaard, that had led the No to EU movement and with the Socialist Left Party (SV) and their then weekly, &quot;Ny Tid&quot;.

==== The Bjerke years ====
Main owner AKP had, as many of its sister parties from the 1970s, declined during the 80s. A further setback came in 1991, when its election front Rød Valgallianse became an independent organization and many party members chose to quit AKP and concentrate on RV. Among these were several of those sympathetic to Allern&#x27;s strategy, while the skepticism toward the editor in the rest-AKP became obvious. In 1995, Allern took the consequences of this and resigned. Paul Bjerke, who had been Allern&#x27;s deputy, was appointed new editor. He had worked in the paper since 1982. His work style was very opposite to his predecessor&#x27;s. In a portrait interview in 1997 with the headline &quot;Mumble mumble&quot; he described himself as &quot;somewhat over the edge antisocial&quot;.

Bjerke soon had to accept reductions in staff and number of pages. His proposed strategy was to meet the problems with expansion. This line was supported by Aksel Nærstad, who from late 1994 had been leading the company board. Nærstad argued that it would be possible to reach a circulation of 15,000 within few years, and that a capital increase of ten million NOK could be obtained provided AKP reduced its ownership. AKP considered these to be numbers without links to reality and instead suggested a discussion on what could be done to fulfill the paper&#x27;s purpose and strengthen &quot;Klassekampen&quot; as a &quot;revolutionary, radical, indignant on behalf of the poor, critical to the system and foresighted&quot; newspaper. The national convention of AKP in May 1997 was positive to reducing the party&#x27;s ownership, but also stated that changing the name or the purpose clause was unacceptable.

Criticism of the paper did not only arise from the AKP leadership and cadre. In 1996, an internet forum named &quot;KK-forum&quot; was established by outsiders as an attempt on participatory democracy, but this was not welcomed by the paper and its staff, who mostly refused to participate in open polemics. Around the same time there was a notable change in &quot;Klassekampen&quot; culture pages with more high-brow intellectual essays that seemed uninteresting and unavailable for the common reader. This led to heavy discussions. Early 1997 Nærstad and Bjerke chose – against AKP&#x27;s will – to go public with their suggested strategy. This led to Nærstad being sacked as leader of the board, and also to discussions about Bjerke&#x27;s position. During the spring and summer several initiatives were taken to solve the situation, but there was an increasing lack of confidence between the groups.

In September 1997, parliamentary elections were due. For four years RV had had its first representative, Erling Folkvord, but polls indicated that he was in danger of losing his seat. &quot;Klassekampen&quot; had always been supporting RV at elections, but now party members felt the help to be somewhat lacking. A few days before the elections the conflict around the newspaper became public as other media claimed that AKP would fire Bjerke. AKP denied that this was the plan. On election day, 15 September, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; front page had a picture of Kristin Halvorsen of SV, and Folkvord lost his seat with a margin of 600 votes. The next day AKP formally declared non-confidence to Bjerke. Most of the editorial staff gathered around their editor, started a byline strike and published comments confronting the papers main owner.

==== Michelet takes over ====

AKP now offered the position as editor to Jon Michelet, novelist, RV politician and former journalist. He was asked not to take the job by a large majority of the staff. Furthermore, campaigns were organized to hit the paper&#x27;s economy by not renewing subscriptions or withholding promised financial contributions. When Bjerke received a formal letter about the boards decision of firing him, the local union of journalists declared that it collectively took over the leadership. As a compromise the board now decided to open for alternative candidates. Meanwhile, journalist Carsten Thomassen was appointed temporary editor. By the end of the month, four additional candidates had signed up, with Kjell Gjerseth being the favorite of the staff. He and MIchelet got the same number of votes in the board, leaving the decision to the board leader who voted in favor of Michelet. The public debate during and after this was hard. Both sides had its supporters. Bjerke went to court to keep the job, but settled with one year paid leave before quitting, while the board admitted that their reasons were not necessarily objectively justified. With most of the editorial staff as well as several external contributors leaving, Michelet&#x27;s most acute task was to fill the columns of the paper on a daily basis. This turned out to be easier than feared, and soon the offices were filled with a new generation of journalists.

Still, it was necessary to improve the paper&#x27;s economy. In 1998, AKP launched a campaign to sell new shares. If successful, this would give &quot;Klassekampen&quot; 5.5 million NOK while simultaneously reducing the party&#x27;s ownership to just below 50 percent. The result was 5.9 million. At the same time, circulation dropped dramatically, leading to several years with operating deficits.

=== From 2000: Daily of the left ===
In the AKP years, other parties of the left as well as the trade union leadership regularly were criticized, often in a secterical way. To survive economically and fulfill the strategy of 1991, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; and its staff – in line with the slogan &quot;The daily of the left&quot; – had to make friends with these groups. Furthermore, the paper realized that it was not possible to grow by committing only to a working class group of readers, whereupon the coverage of cultural and ideological topics was increased. Much was done in these areas during the 1990s – and much was lost again during the 1997 crisis. Thus, a primary task for Michelet and his staff was to rebuild confidence within these groups. Several persons with links to the Socialist Left Party (and its youth organization Socialist Youth) was hired or offered columns in the paper.

MIchelet had a personal style that helped reducing old conflict and build confidence. On the other hand, his impulsivity could create internal problems, causing the board and the CFO to alarm AKP, still the largest owner. Strengthening of the paper&#x27;s editorial leadership was necessary. In October 2000, Bjørgulv Braanen was hired as assistant editor (&quot;redaksjonssjef&quot;). Braanen had been in Klassekampen before, as head of layout in the late 1980s, but had spent ten years in different positions in &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot;, a liberal business paper. The return to &quot;Klassekampen&quot; for him meant a 50 percent reduction in salary, but he said it was a project he could stand for – on the condition that AKP would reduce its ownership and that the paper would develop further into an arena for the broad left.

In 2002, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; published around 10 essays by and two interviews with Israel Shamir, who was criticized for arguing in favour of alliances with the far right. After a debate between Shamir and Håkon Kolmannskog (then editor of the correspondence pages), the cooperation was ended.

==== Braanen&#x27;s years ====

Michelet had a five-year contract as editor. For health reasons he abstained from prolongation, whereupon Braanen took over as chief editor in 2002. He presented his ambitions: &quot;I think we have a golden opportunity to build a broad, versatile and radical paper. The political situation also demands such a paper, and not the propaganda paper of former times. The left is on the defensive, and the way ahead is vague. (...) In this situation we need a broad and inclusive radical and critical paper, not one that pretends to have all the answers up front.&quot;

Braanen followed this line, and &quot;Klassekampen&quot; managed to increase its circulation year by year. This naturally helped the paper&#x27;s financial situation and made improvements possible. One of these was an increased coverage of culture. In September 2006 &quot;Bokmagasinet&quot; (The Book Magazine) was launched as an enclosure every Saturday, inspired by &quot;Guardian Review&quot; and the Danish &quot;Weekendavisen&quot;, and aiming to become &quot;Norway&#x27;s most important literature paper&quot;. In 2012 a similar music was approached in the same way when the weekly &quot;Musikkmagasinet&quot; started on Mondays. Theatre and the arts also have regular pages. For some time, the separate magazine &quot;Cinema&quot; was distributed along with &quot;Klassekampen&quot; six times per year.

In 2004, former editor Paul Bjerke returned to the paper with a regular weekly column that ran for thirteen years.

Another step against the mainstream media flow, was to improve the paper&#x27;s coverage of &quot;all Norway&quot; through regional offices – in Trondheim (2012), Tromsø (2017) and Bergen (2017).

In 2006 Braanen received the Fritt Ord Award for his efforts – together with the staff – to develop &quot;Klassekampen&quot; into a broad and including daily &quot;with exceptional contributions in the field of serious political journalism&quot;. In 2009 he was named Editor of the Year by the Editors&#x27; Association of Oslo.

AKP&#x27;s majority ownership was still a topic of discussion. In 2006 two left-wing publishing houses, Oktober and Pax, proposed to invest NOK 3 million in the paper. This was turned down by AKP, creating fear that the party was going back on its plan to reduce its share. But it turned out that the party&#x27;s plan was even more ambitious, and in 2007 it was announced that also Fagforbundet, Norway&#x27;s largest trade union, would throw in 3 million. A spokeswoman for the union stated that &quot;Klassekampen plays an important role in areas important for the union: defending the welfare state, a critical attitude to neoliberalism and wide coverage of the environmental crisis&quot;. Later on more trade unions have bought shares in &quot;Klassekampen&quot;. Fellesforbundet first acquired shares for NOK 100,000 in 2011 (as did Landsorganisasjonen), and then in 2015 threw in 5 million NOK to become a 5 percent owner. In 2007, AKP and RV merged into the Red Party, which took over AKP shares.

==== Skurdal takes over ====
In 2018, Braanen resigned as chief editor and was replaced by Mari Skurdal who had along career in different leading positions in the paper. Braanen continued as a political commentator/editor. Skurdal has in general continued Braanen&#x27;s editorial line, but with increased priority on investigative journalism. A separate unit for this was established in late 2021. A new digital platform was launched in 2018 and received the DOGA-label for good design the following year. However, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; remains to be a primarily printed newspaper with only a few daily articles openly accessible on the Internet.

In 2022 Skurdal was named Editor of the year by the Editors&#x27; Association of Oslo.

=====Coverage of Russia=====
In early 2022 &quot;Klassekampen&quot; was criticized by some of Norway&#x27;s mainstream newspapers for an uncritical attitude towards Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Russia and for having published pro-Russian conspiracy theories. The political editor of &quot;Dagbladet&quot; Geir Ramnefjell wrote that &quot;Klassekampen&quot; got its coverage of the events of the Russo-Ukrainian War that led to the 2022 full-scale invasion &quot;most consistently wrong&quot; and claimed – based on the publication of an essay by the Italian journalist Thomas Fazi – that the paper continued to publish &quot;third rate conspiracy theories&quot; of the &quot;crackpot left&quot; even after the invasion. The day after the Russian invasion the paper was described as &quot;Putin&#x27;s Norwegian parrots&quot; by of &quot;Aftenposten&quot;. The political editor of &quot;Dagens Næringsliv&quot; Frithjof Jacobsen wrote that &quot;Klassekampen&#x27;s&quot; former editor Bjørgulv Braanen was among those who had espoused &quot;rigid anti-Americanism&quot; and &quot;whose voices we do not need to listen to any more.&quot; &quot;Klassekampen&quot;, however, condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine from the beginning. An editorial from Norway&#x27;s largest newspaper &quot;Aftenposten&quot; in November 2022 stated that &quot;before the invasion, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; went to great lengths to dismiss concerns that there was any threat from Russia against Ukraine. Now the newspaper chooses to downplay the danger that Russian manipulation of Western democracies poses.&quot;

=====Coverage of transgender people=====
The paper has been criticized by representatives of the LGBT community for its coverage of transgender people. Gender studies scholar wrote that &quot;&quot;Klassekampen&quot; has published regular columnists who have voiced transphobic views for a long time.&quot; Jon Martin Larsen argued that some published articles were trampling on transgender people and inciting hatred against them. Skurdal denied the accusations of transphobia and said that the editorial profile is to bring in different voices on this and other issues, giving the readers the opportunity to make up their own minds. Regular columnists Anne Kalvig (vice chair of Women&#x27;s Declaration International) and Kajsa Ekis Ekman (a Swedish freelance writer) have written several articles in the newspaper from &quot;gender critical&quot; viewpoints.

===Internet===

&quot;Klassekampen&quot; has had a relatively small Internet presence since the 1990s, launched in late 1996. In 2020 the paper launched its new website and since then the newspaper has been climbing on daily digital readers. Katrine Holmøy has been &quot;Klassekampens&quot; development editor from 2016. In 2019, &quot;Klassekampens&quot; online paper was awarded with the DOGA-label for good design.

&quot;KK-forum&quot; was established by Trond Andresen in 1996. Andresen has since been a keen advocate of the newspaper&#x27;s use of the Internet, both as moderator of its various semi-official or official early Internet platforms, as a columnist in the printed newspaper and at the shareholders&#x27; meetings. &quot;KK-forum&quot; played a major role in the ousting of then-editor Paul Bjerke in 1997, when the paper&#x27;s owners, AKP, appointed Jon Michelet as the new editor. As editor of &quot;Klassekampen&quot; Michelet initiated a formal cooperation with Trond Andresen and &quot;KK-forum&quot;, that became the semi-official Internet forum of &quot;Klassekampen&quot; from 1997; it was linked from the newspaper&#x27;s Internet frontpage. Andresen was also a regular columnist in the printed newspaper from 2000 to 2016.

In 2008 &quot;Klassekampen&quot; launched its official online forum, also moderated by Trond Andresen, following a decision at the shareholders&#x27; meeting spearheaded by Andresen.

In 2009 Trond Andresen established the Facebook group &quot;Vi som bryr oss om avisa Klassekampen&quot; [Those of us who care about the newspaper Klassekampen], where the paper&#x27;s editorial practices are discussed. After some years &quot;Klassekampen&quot; distanced itself from the group, and in an editorial the newspaper claimed that the forum &quot;has for years been the scene of backbiting of the newspaper&#x27;s journalism and staff.&quot;

== Current content ==

The paper is based in Oslo and has local offices in Bergen, Trondheim, Tromsø and Cairo, Egypt. Ownership is shared by the Red Party (successor of the Workers&#x27; Communist Party), the national trade unions Fagforbundet, Fellesforbundet and Industri Energi, Mater (sole owner of the Pax publisher), Oktoberstiftelsen (minority owner of the Oktober publishing house), the support organization &quot;Klassekampens venner&quot;, as well as smaller shareholders.

On Saturdays, the newspaper features a separate book magazine. Editors of this section have been Bendik Wold (2006–2008) and Karin Haugen (2008–present). Among the regular contributors are (per 2022): Jonas Bals, Ellen Engelstad, Tore Linné Eriksen, Elin Kittelsen, Mimir Kristjansson, Sandra Lillebø, Espen Stueland and Janneken Øverland. A special column on Nordic literature features essays by Gerður Kristný (Iceland), Peter Fröberg Idling and Magnus Nilsson (Sweden), Kristina Stoltz and Peter Nielsen (Denmark), and Sirpa Kähkönen and Pia Ingström (Finland).

A music magazine is included on Mondays. Editor is Erik Blegeberg. It features interviews, essays and reviews of a broad spectrum of music genres. Contributors include Egil Baumann, Mariann Bjørnelv, Charlotte Myrbråten and Tom Skjeklesæter.

In general, the paper presents a variety of opinions. It features several columns with regular external contributors (per 2022): &quot;Feminist of course&quot; (Wencke Mühleisen, Asta Beate Håland, Stephen Walton, Anne Bitsch), &quot;Kringla heimsins&quot; (Hans Jacob Orning, Gro Steinsland, Frans-Arne Stylegar, Christine Amadou, Thomas Reinertsen Berg, Gunnhild Røthe), &quot;Homo Politicus&quot; (Ottar Brox, Arne Johan Vetlesen, Bente Aasjord, Linn Herning, Magnus Marsdal), &quot;A Nordic Dawn&quot; (trade union activists from the Nordic countries), &quot;Horizon&quot; (Bhaskar Sunkara, Kajsa Ekis Ekman, Thomas Fazi, Francesca Borri, William Shoki, Grace Blakely, Vijay Prashad), &quot;Heads and Tails&quot; (Morten Jerven, Erik S. Reinert, Maria Walberg, Rune Skarstein, Chr. Anton Smedshaug, Ole Kvadsheim), &quot;In good faith&quot; (Lars Gule, Rania Jalal Al-Nahi, Gyrid Gunnes, Eivor Andersen Oftestad, Mina Bai), &quot;Naturally&quot; (Stefan Sundström, Anna Blix, Kathrine Kinn, Frans-Jan Parmentier, Lene Liebe Delsett), &quot;Signed&quot; (Jonas Bals, Sandra Lillebø, Olav Elgvin, Olaug Nilssen, Minda Holm, Åsa Linderborg).

Other regular contributors are Solveig Aareskjold, Idar Helle, Dag Seierstad, Morten Harper, Arild Linneberg, Torgrim Eggen, Arild Rønsen, and Sylfest Lomheim. Bjørn Vassnes has a weekly column on advances in science. Comedian Knut Nærum contributes as a cartoonist on Saturdays. Jens Styve&#x27;s one-liner &quot;Dunce&quot; runs daily. Reviews of theater, film and art exhibition are regular.

The Norwegian edition of the monthly &quot;Le Monde diplomatique&quot; is enclosed in a full subscription of &quot;Klassekampen&quot;.

== Funding ==
Norway has for a long time had various schemes for state support of newspapers. Still, it has proved difficult to establish new nationwide print papers. When &quot;Klassekampen&quot; became a daily in 1977, it was the first time since 1945 a new paper entered this arena. The next time was in 1992.

In addition to state support and income from subscriptions, single sales and advertisements, &quot;Klassekampen&quot; has always been based on voluntary financial and practical support. The first printing press was financed by enthusiastic young people taking summer jobs or newspaper couriers (for established newspapers) before school hours. All work (editing, printing, sales) was done on a voluntary basis in the first years. The first paid employees started when the paper turned into a weekly publication in 1973. In 1974 the party launched a campaign to finance a rotary press. The following 2.5 years the campaign raised more than NOK 5.6 million.

&quot;Klassekampen&#x27;s&quot; current owners include Norway&#x27;s Red Party, the association &quot;Klassekampens venner&quot; (&quot;Friends of Klassekampen&quot;), several trade unions and smaller shareholders.

<doc id="1044528" wikidata="Q6973968" url="?curid=1044528" title="National Lampoon's Doon">
<text>National Lampoon&#x27;s Doon is a parody novel written by Ellis Weiner and published in 1984 by Pocket Books for &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. &quot;Doon&quot; is a spoof of Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot;. 

&quot;Doon&quot; was reprinted by Grafton Books () in 1985. In 1988 William F. Touponce called the book &quot;something of a tribute to Herbert&#x27;s success on college campuses&quot;, noting that &quot;the only other book to have been so honored is Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;,&quot; which was parodied by &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot; in 1969.

&quot;Dune&quot; is set on the dangerous planet Arrakis, sole source of the spice melange, the most valuable substance in the universe. The parody follows a similar storyline, wherein rival restaurant-owning families battle for control of Arruckus, which is overrun by giant pretzels and the source of valuable beer.

== Plot ==
The planet Arruckus is also known as &quot;Doon&quot;, the Dessert Planet totally devoid of entrées, and its only export is beer. Within the Galactic Empire, House Hardchargin, the House given charge of Arruckus, has been displaced by House Agamemnides, with Duke Lotto at its head.

Soon after arriving at Doon, Duke Lotto and House Agamemnides fall victim to a scheme originated by Baron Vladimir Hardchargin and implemented by the Duke&#x27;s own accountant Oyeah, who kept a secret second ledger. When the Emperor called for an audit of the fief, the duplicate ledger made it appear as though House Agamemnides had been cooking the books. Duke Lotto&#x27;s brief reign over Doon is ended and House Hardchargin is reinstated as fief-holders.

Banished to the sugared wilderness, Pall, head of House Agamemnides, and Lady Jazzica meet with and are eventually accepted by the planet&#x27;s native population, the Freedmenmen. Pall begins to ascend the power structure of the tribe and takes the Freedmenmen girl Loni as his lover. Pall positions himself as the long hoped-for Freedmenmen messiah, who will finally bring the entrées the Freedmenmen have hungered for. By this route, he assumes and consolidates his power over the natives.

Meanwhile, Baron Vladimir Hardchargin is hungry for more success, and has plans to become the true power in the galaxy. Events come to a head when Pall challenges the Baron to a bake-off, with a new ingredient: peanut butter, rendered from the naturally occurring snack mix&#x27;s peanuts, and debuting his secret weapon – a liqueur made from beer – Drambrewski. With the support of the people, Pall assumes Imperial control, banishing the Emperor&#x27;s house to the prison planet Simplicissima Secundus, acquiring the hand of the Emperor&#x27;s daughter Serutan in a marriage of convenience, and the Freedmenmen woman Loni as his concubine.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Doon&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #76, and stated that &quot;with the best will in the world, a parody of a particular author gets tiresome after a few thousand words.&quot;

<text>Asaphida is a large, morphologically diverse order of trilobites found in marine strata dated from the Middle Cambrian until their extinction during the Silurian. Asaphida contains six superfamilies (Anomocaroidea, Asaphoidea, Cyclopygoidea, Dikelocephaloidea, Remopleuridoidea and Trinucleioidea), but no suborders. Asaphids comprise some 20% of described fossil trilobites.

In 2020, the superfamily Trinucleioidea was proposed to be raised to an order (Trinucleida) and removed from Asaphida.

==Morphology==

The Asaphids generally have cephalon (head) and pygidium (tail) parts similar in size, and most species have a prominent median ventral suture. Heads are often flat, and carapace furrows in the head area are often faint or not visible. Thoracic segments typically number 5 - 12, though some species have as few as two and some as many as 30. They also generally have a wide doublure, or rim, that surrounds the cephalon. This causes some specimens to be described as having a characteristic &quot;snowplow&quot; shaped cephalon. When present, eyes are typically large.

One Asaphida line, the superfamily Asaphoidea, shows a continuous evolution of eyestalks, from individuals with stubby eyes to &quot;Asaphus kowalewskii&quot;, a trilobite with long eyestalks. This line is found in the Middle Ordovician Asery Level deposits of the Volkhov River region near Saint Petersburg, Russia. During the Ordovician, the region that is now Eastern Europe was a shallow inland sea. This eyestalk development is believed to be an adaptation to changes in turbidity during this time, with eye-stalked trilobites like &quot;A. kowalewski&quot; presumably arising in a time of increased turbidity. One thought is that this trilobite may have lain in wait for prey buried in the bottom sediment with only its periscope eyestalks protruding.

The major extinction event marking the end of the Ordovician Period reduced the diversity of all trilobite orders with most asaphid families disappearing. The only surviving asaphids were members of superfamily Trinucleioidea, and they too disappeared before the end of the Silurian Period.

<text>Michel Loève (January 22, 1907 – February 17, 1979) was a French-American probabilist and mathematical statistician, of Jewish origin. He is known in mathematical statistics and probability theory for the Karhunen–Loève theorem and Karhunen–Loève transform.

Michel Loève was born in Jaffa (then part of the Ottoman Empire) in 1907, to a Jewish family. He passed most of his childhood years in Egypt and received his primary and secondary education there in French schools. Later, after achieving the grades of B.L. in 1931 and A.B. in 1936, he studied mathematics at the Université de Paris under Paul Lévy, and received his &quot;Doctorat ès Sciences (Mathématiques)&quot; in 1941. In 1936 was employed as actuaire of the University of Lyon.

Because of his Jewish origin, he was arrested during the German occupation of France and sent to Drancy internment camp. One of his books is dedicated &quot;To Line and To the students and teachers of the School in the Camp de Drancy&quot;. Having survived the Holocaust, after the liberation he became between 1944 and 1946 chief of research at the Institut Henri Poincaré at Paris University, then until 1948 worked at the University of London.

After one term as a visiting professor at Columbia University he accepted the position of professor of mathematics at Berkeley, in 1955 adding the title professor of statistics.

He is the author of one of the earliest books on measure-theoretic probability theory and one of the best known textbooks. He is memorialized via the Loève Prize created by his widow Line.

<doc id="1044537" wikidata="Q955510" url="?curid=1044537" title="Itapevi">
<text>Itapevi is a Brazilian municipality in the state of São Paulo located in the western part of the Greater São Paulo metropolitan area (35 km to the west of São Paulo city). The population is 240,961 (2020 est.) in an area of 82.7 km2.

Its boundaries are Santana de Parnaíba to the north, Barueri in the northeast, Jandira in the east, Cotia to the south, Vargem Grande Paulista to the southwest and São Roque to the west.

The city is served by Castello Branco and Raposo Tavares highways and also by Line 8 of CPTM, the São Paulo Metropolitan Railway Company.

==Etymology==

The toponym comes from the Tupi language Itapevi and means &quot;river of flat stones,&quot; according to two books: &quot;Vocabulário Tupi-Guarani - Português&quot;, by Prof. Silveira Bueno (Brasilivros Editora), and &quot;A Origem dos Nomes dos Municípios Paulistas&quot; (Imprensa Oficial do Estado de São Paulo, 2003), by Enio Squeff and Helder Perri Ferreira.

Says the constant entry of final work: &quot;Itapevi (by Tupi - itá peb&#x27;y): itapevas river, the river slabs of flat stones, of ita-peba (flat stone slab) and &#x27;y (river or waters) &quot;.

==History==

The formation of the village began around the eighteenth century, and the first building in the city was a house built around 1720, used by bandeirantes. The earliest settlers were probably the Abreus family.

On July 10, 1875, the train station of Cotia (Sorocabana) was inaugurated, around which formed the core of Itapevi. In 1895, the Italian Giulio Michaeli opened a quarry for the production of paving stones, attracting families of Italian immigrants, such as Belli, Michelotti and Silicani.

In 1912, Joaquim Nunes Filho (Nho Quim), from Cotia city, purchased the Sítio Itapevy, with 152 bushels. This place covering all the current city center. Nunes became a local political boss, for his ties to the former PRP (Partido Republicano Paulista). He managed the elevation of the village to district Cotia on October 12, 1920; Nunes has brought electricity in 1929 and the installation of the first telephone in 1930.

Nevertheless, the reference of the place was still under the name of Cotia train station, removing the possibility of identifying own the place.

In 1940, he arrived in Itapevi Carlos de Castro, businessman. Knowing that the Nunes family had pretensions to sell the land that belonged to Joaquim Nunes (who died in 1941), he acquired vast tract of land, giving rise to the allotment of Parque Suburbano and Jardim Bela Vista. It was from there that accelerated the process of urbanization of the place.

At the time, the train station was still called Cotia and the headquarters of the future city was known as Vila Cotia. With this, they created enormous confusion up to the postal and telegraph service in the district. In 1945, Carlos de Castro got with then Minister João Alberto that the station had its name changed to Itapevi. The people celebrated this decree.

On May 10, 1952, Carlos de Castro met with three other residents of the district: Nicolau Leonardo, Raul Leonardo and Ezequiel Dias Siqueira. Together, they drafted a petition to the Assembléia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo for the emancipation of the district. Taking more than a thousand signatures, but even so, they were defeated by the fact that Itapevi was very near Cotia and that residents were indebted to the city. They had to wait five years for the project to be voted on again. From then and now, in a spirit of emancipation throughout this region, members of the society of the time initiated the movement for autonomy in the district, causing the population to commit mass in the process. Its founders were men like himself Carlos de Castro, Americo Christianini, Cezário de Abreu, Bonifácio de Abreu, Rubens Caramez (then councilor of Cotia and who later became the first mayor of Itapevi), Raul Leonardo (the only emancipatory still alive), Jose dos Santos Novaes, Antônio Pedra Pereira and many others.

In 1958, about nine hundred people opted for emancipation, against only thirty unwilling to accept autonomy in a referendum. That same year was formalized by Governor Jânio Quadros the law that created the city of Itapevi. The city was officially founded in the following year, on February 18, 1959, by Governor Carvalho Pinto. The first mayor was Rubens Caramez, who won the elections against Carlos de Castro.

==Politics==

The executive branch is currently exercised by the mayor Jaci Tadeu da Silva (PV) - elected in 2012 with a mandate until 2016, by Deputy Mayor Azevedo Fláudio Limes (PT) and the municipal secretaries appointed by the mayor (current Secretary of Government: Peter Tomishigue Mori).

==Geography==

===Physical setting===
Itapevi is located in Southeastern Brazil, in southeastern São Paulo State, approximately halfway between São Paulo city and Sorocaba. The city is located on a plateau located within the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for &quot;Sea Range&quot;), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around 799 metres (2,621 ft) above sea level, although being at a distance of only about 100 kilometres from the Atlantic Ocean.

The original flora consisted mainly of a great variety of broadleaf evergreens. Today, non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, with eucalyptus being especially ubiquitous.

===Climate===
Itapevi climate is subtropical, temperate, warm the coldest month being July and warmest in February. Rainfall is abundant, amounting to an annual average of 1,324 mm. According to Köppen, Itapevi can be classified as a humid subtropical climate &quot;Cfa&quot;.

The climate table below shows the monthly and annual mean temperatures and rainfall for the city of Itapevi:

==Economy==

The municipality of Itapevi concentrates almost all its population in urban areas, resulting in reduced agricultural activity.

The Exame magazine pointed Itapevi among the 10 cities with the best economic development in the country, and as the first in the state of São Paulo. The ranking is part of the story &quot;The best cities for business&#x27;.

Itapevi has a well diversified industrial park, with an emphasis on the pharmaceutical industry. Large companies are located within the municipality, such as Henkel, Jaraguá, Cacau Show, Casa Suíça, Eurofarma, Alpla, Wyeth, Blanver, Bomi Brasil and others.

Between 1960 and 1980, one of the main industries was the Santa Rita Cement Factory, which belonged to the Grupo Votorantim and was deactivated and demolished.

==Demography==

*Total: 200.874 inhabitants (2010).
*Demographic density (inhabitants/km2): 2.430,15
*Child mortality until 1 year (in 1000): 9,74 (2004)
*HDI : 0,759 (2000)
** HDI-M Income: 0,663
** HDI-M Longevity: 0,737
** HDI-M Education: 0,876

<text>The Indonesia national football team () represents Indonesia in international men&#x27;s football matches since 1945. The men&#x27;s national team is controlled by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI), the governing body for football in Indonesia, which is a part of AFC, under the jurisdiction of FIFA. Most of Indonesia home matches are played at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.

The team is colloquially referred to as &quot;Tim Garuda&quot; (Garuda Team), &quot;Timnas&quot; (National Team) or &quot;Merah Putih&quot; (The Red and White) after the country&#x27;s national emblem and their distinctive red-and-white jerseys based on the country&#x27;s flag. Their fan club is known as &quot;La Grande Indonesia&quot; and &quot;Ultras Garuda&quot;.

Indonesia was the first team from Asia to participate in the FIFA World Cup. The predecessor of the team, Dutch East Indies, participated in the 1938 edition, where they were eliminated in the first round. The team&#x27;s only appearance at the Olympics was in 1956. Indonesia qualified for the AFC Asian Cup on five occasions, and advanced to the knockout stage for the first time in the 2023 tournament, exiting in the round of 16. Indonesia achieved the bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games in Tokyo. The team appeared in the ASEAN Championship final six times. They finished runners-up on all six occasions. Indonesia has long-standing football rivalries with neighbours Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.

==History==
=== 1921–1938: Colonization era ===

Dutch East Indies, or Netherlands East Indies was the national team that represented the territory of present-day Indonesia during the Dutch colonial era. The team was organized by the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU), which became a member of FIFA on 24 May 1924. The first recorded unofficial match of the Dutch East Indies was against Singapore on 28 March 1921 in Batavia, which ended in a 1–0 win. This was followed by matches in August 1928 against Australia (2–1 win) and in 1930 against a team from Shanghai, China (4–4 draw).

On 19 April 1930, Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) was founded with Soeratin Sosrosoegondo as the first leader, after most all non-national organizations in the country such as VIJ Jakarta, BIVB Bandung, PSM Mataram, IVBM Magelang, VVB Solo, MVB Madiun, and SIVB Surabaya gathered at a meeting in Soerakarta and agreed to form the second national football organization in order to resist the Dutch control of the colonies by gathering all the footballers to play under PSSI.

In 1934, a team from Java represented the Dutch East Indies in the Far Eastern Games in Manila, Philippines. The team managed to beat Japan 7–1 in the first match, but the last two matches ended in defeat, 0–2 to China and 2–3 to the Philippines, resulting in the team finishing second in the tournament. These matches are considered by World Football Elo Ratings to be the first matches involving the Indonesia national team. On 9 June 1935, two national organizations, NIVU and PSSI, joined forces and worked together to contribute players to the national team. NIVU remained the official football association of the Dutch East Indies and was admitted to FIFA membership on 14 August 1936, after first becoming a member in 1924.

=== 1938–1945: Asia&#x27;s first FIFA World Cup participant ===

Dutch East Indies made its FIFA World Cup debut during the 1938 edition in France. The team advanced to the final round without playing any qualifying matches. Japan, who were drawn in Group 12 of the qualifying round with the Dutch East Indies, decided to withdraw from the competition. The Dutch East Indies were then ordered by FIFA to carry out a play-off match against one of the Group 11 participants, the United States. The match was scheduled to be played on 29 May 1938, but never took place after the United States also decided to withdraw from the competition. This allowed the Dutch East Indies to advance to the final round as the Asia&#x27;s first World Cup participant.

In the final round, the Dutch East Indies were coached by Johan Mastenbroek who also served as chairman of the Dutch East Indies Football Association (NIVU). The team consisted of 17 players and was captained by a local Indonesian, Achmad Nawir. In the competition which still used the knockout format, the Dutch East Indies were eliminated in the first round when they were defeated by Hungary 0–6. This match took place on 5 June 1938 at the Stade Municipal, Reims. At the end of the competition, Hungary who had previously eliminated the Dutch East Indies, became the runner-up of the competition after being defeated by Italy 2–4 in the final. To this day, the Dutch East Indies have been the only team representing a colony, before becoming an independent nation, to have qualified for a FIFA World Cup.

=== 1945–1984: Independence era ===

After the Second World War, followed by the Indonesian Revolution in 1947, the national team no longer used the name Dutch East Indies and replacing it with the name Indonesia. The previous national football organization, the Dutch East Indies Football Union (NIVU) was succeeded by the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI). The team&#x27;s first official match under the name Indonesia was on 5 March 1951 at the Asian Games, where they lost 0–3 by the host nation India at the National Stadium, New Delhi.

Indonesia qualified for the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne. The team advanced directly to the quarter-finals of the tournament after the withdrawal of their first-round opponents, South Vietnam. In the quarter-finals, the team met the Soviet Union who had previously defeated the United Team of Germany 2–1. The match was held on 29 November 1956, where Indonesia forced the Soviet Union to a goalless draw. This resulted the match being replayed two days later where the team lost 0–4.

In 1957, Indonesia dominated the qualifying round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup. The team defeated China in the first round, then subsequently refused to play its next opponents, Israel, for political reasons. Indonesian player Rusli Ramang became the top scorer at the end of the competition with 4 goals.

Indonesia won the bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games where the team beat India 4–1 in the third-place match. The team also drew 2–2 with East Germany in a friendly match. Indonesia won Merdeka Tournament trophy on three occasions (1961, 1962 and 1969). The team were also champions of the 1968 King&#x27;s Cup. Indonesia returned to World Cup qualification rounds in 1974 as the team was eliminated in the first round, with only one win from six matches, against New Zealand. During the qualification round of 1978 FIFA World Cup, Indonesia won a single of four matches, against the host team, Singapore. Four years later, in 1982, Indonesia won two FIFA World Cup qualifying matches, over Chinese Taipei and Australia.

=== 1985–1995: Renaissance of Indonesia football ===
The 1986 FIFA World Cup qualification round saw Indonesia advance from the first round with four wins, one draw, and one loss, eventually finishing at the top of its group. South Korea emerged victorious over Indonesia in the second round. The team reached the semi-final of the 1986 Asian Games after beating the United Arab Emirates in the quarter-finals. Indonesia then lost to host South Korea in the semi-finals and lost to Kuwait in the bronze medal match.

A milestone during this era was the gold medal victory at the Southeast Asian Games in both 1987 and 1991. In 1987, Indonesia beat Malaysia 1–0; while in 1991, it beat Thailand in a penalty shoot-out. In the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, the Indonesian team lost in the first round, with only one win against Hong Kong, three draws and two defeats. The team also only managed a single victory against Vietnam in the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification round.

=== 1995–2016: Continental appearances ===

====1996 AFC Asian Cup====
Indonesia&#x27;s first appearance in the AFC Asian Cup was against United Arab Emirates in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup. During the tournament, Indonesia only scored a single point from a 2–2 draw against Kuwait in the first round.

====1998 Tiger Cup====
In the final group stage match of the 1998 Tiger Cup, Indonesia faced Thailand while the both teams already through to the semi-finals, but were also aware that the winner would have to face hosts Vietnam. Indonesia&#x27;s Mursyid Effendi deliberately kicked the ball into Indonesia&#x27;s own goal as Thailand&#x27;s attacker ran towards the ball. FIFA fined both teams $40,000 for &quot;violating the spirit of the game&quot; while Effendi was banned from international association football for a lifetime. Indonesia was rewarded with a match by the team they wanted to face; minnows Singapore (who they ironically lost 2–1 to) in the semi-finals.

====2000 AFC Asian Cup====
The team&#x27;s second appearance in the Asian Cup was in Lebanon in the 2000 AFC Asian Cup; again, the Indonesian team gained only one point from three games, and again, from a match against Kuwait that finished without a score from either side. Indonesia established a higher record in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, beating Qatar 2–1 to record the team&#x27;s first-ever victory in the history of the tournament. The win was not enough for it to qualify for the second round, having fallen 0–5 to host China and 1–3 to Bahrain.

====2004 AFC Asian Cup====
Indonesia then qualified for their third successful tournament in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup being grouped with China, Qatar, and Bahrain with them winning the only match against Qatar in a 2–1 victory but crashed out of the tournament with only three points.

====2007 AFC Asian Cup====
The 2007 AFC Asian Cup saw Indonesia co-hosting the tournament with Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam becoming the first time in the AFC Asian Cup history that four countries co-hosted the competition. In the opening match of the tournament, Indonesia faces Bahrain with goals coming from Budi Sudarsono and Bambang Pamungkas to secure a 2–1 win. However, in the following two matches, Indonesia suffered a 2–1 defeat to Saudi Arabia and narrowly losing to South Korea 1–0 which Indonesia failed to qualified to the knockout stage of the tournament.

====AFF Championship====
Indonesia reached the finals of AFF Championship on six occasions (2000, 2002, 2004, 2010, 2016, and 2020), albeit never managing to lift the trophy victoriously. The team&#x27;s claim of regional titles came in the Southeast Asian Games of 1987 and 1991.

After the Peter Withe era, the inability to fulfill the ASEAN target has been cited as the reason for Indonesia&#x27;s &quot;revolving door&quot; in terms of team managers. Over two years, Indonesia&#x27;s manager changed from Kolev to local coach Benny Dollo who was in turn sacked in 2010. The head coach position was then held by Alfred Riedl who failed to lift any cups and in July 2011 was then replaced by Wim Rijsbergen.

=== 2012–2016: Suspensions ===
In March 2012, PSSI received a warning for the divided state of Indonesian football, whereby two separate leagues existed: the rebel Indonesia Super League (ISL), which isn&#x27;t recognized by PSSI or FIFA, and the Indonesia Premier League (IPL). The National Sports Committee (KONI) encouraged PSSI to work collaboratively with Indonesian Football Savior Committee (KPSI) officials to rectify the situation but KONI chairman Tono Suratman stated in March 2012 that KONI would take over the beleaguered PSSI if matters are not improved. FIFA did not state whether Indonesia would face suspension, but on 20 March 2012, FIFA made an announcement. In the lead-up to 20 March 2012, PSSI struggled to resolve the situation and looked to its annual congress for a final solution. PSSI was given until 15 June 2012 to settle the issues at stake, notably the control of the breakaway league; failing this, the case was to be referred to the FIFA Emergency Committee for suspension. FIFA eventually set a new 1 December 2012 deadline. In the two weeks preceding the deadline, three out of four PSSI representatives withdrew from the joint committee, citing frustrations in dealing with KPSI representatives. However, FIFA stated that it would only issue a punishment to Indonesian football after the Indonesian national squad finished its involvement in the 2012 AFF Championship.

In 2013, the president of PSSI Djohar Arifin Husin signed a Memorandum of understanding (MoU) with La Nyalla Matalitti (KPSI-PSSI) that was initiated by FIFA and the AFC through the Asian Football Confederation&#x27;s Task Force. Since then, the control of Indonesia Super League was taken by the Joint committee to remain manageable by &quot;PT Liga Indonesia&quot; until the establishment of a new professional competition by the committee. This means the Indonesian players from ISL were able to play and join the national team. The PSSI called players from both football leagues, ISL and IPL to fortify the national team for the Asian Cup qualifier of 2015. On 7 January 2013, PSSI announced a list of 51 players from both sides of football leagues regardless of whether players from the breakaway Indonesia Super League (ISL) would make an appearance, allegedly ISL clubs were reluctant to release players because they doubted Djohar&#x27;s leadership.
On 18 March 2013, PSSI held a congress at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Both parties, PSSI and KPSI (breakaway group) solved their differences in four contentious points; such as; Reunification of two leagues; Revision of the PSSI Statutes; Reinstatement of the four expelled PSSI Executive Committee members La Nyalla Mattalitti, Roberto Rouw, Erwin Dwi Budiawan, and Toni Apriliani; and agreement of all parties to the Memorandum of Understanding from 7 June 2012 on the list of delegates to the PSSI Congress based on the list of the Solo Congress of July 2011. The new PSSI called 58 players from both sides leagues (ISL and IPL) for the national squad. Rahmad Darmawan returned as the caretaker coach of the national team with Jacksen F. Tiago as the assistant coach. They trimmed the 58 players initially called for national training to 28. The list would then be trimmed again to just 23 players for the Saudi Arabia match. Victor Igbonefo, Greg Nwokolo and Sergio van Dijk the three naturalised players were on the final list. On 23 March 2013, Indonesia was defeated 1–2 by Saudi Arabia at home. Boaz Solossa gave Indonesia the first goal in their campaign for AFC Asian Cup qualification; the home team started with the goal in the sixth minute but the Saudi Side fought back with the equalizer from Yahya Al-Shehri in the 14th minute before Yousef Al-Salem the scored what turned out to be the winner on 56th minute.

In 2015, Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) was suspended by FIFA due to government interference in the domestic competition. The announcement was made on 30 May 2015 and had an immediate impact on the national team. Indonesia would not be eligible to compete in the next round of qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup, starting less than two weeks later. FIFA took action against Indonesia following a row between the local government and the football association which has resulted in the cancellation of the domestic competition. The suspension was lifted at the 66th FIFA Congress. By then, hurried perpetration was done for Indonesia in order to get in touch for the upcoming 2016 AFF Championship where Indonesia eventually reached the final and once again fell to Thailand in process.

=== 2017–2019: Rebuilding ===
Some weeks after finishing as runners-up in the 2016 AFF Championship, PSSI held a congress on 8 January 2017 in an effort to sign Spanish coach, Luis Milla to handle their senior and U-22 team. Prior to the 2018 AFF Championship, Milla departed without any explanation, causing anger among Indonesian supporters. Indonesia crashed out from the group stage in the 2018 AFF Championship, which led to the sacking of Bima Sakti. In order to prepare for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign, Indonesia signed Scottish coach Simon McMenemy with hope that his successful tenure with the Philippines could reinvigorate Indonesia&#x27;s performance especially when Indonesia was grouped with three Southeast Asian rivals Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam alongside UAE. Indonesia lost all four matches including a 2–3 home defeat to Malaysia despite having taken a 2–1 lead prior followed by a home loss to Vietnam for the first time in any competitive tournaments. On 6 November 2019, PSSI decided to sack McMenemy over the national team&#x27;s deteriorating performance. Indonesia traveled to Malaysia and lost 0–2 to its rival and was officially eliminated from the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.

=== 2020–2025: Shin Tae-yong era ===

After failing to qualify for the World Cup, PSSI appointed Shin Tae-yong as the head coach of the Indonesian national team, becoming the first South Korean in Indonesia&#x27;s managerial history. This appointment was based on the success of fellow Korean coach Park Hang-seo in Vietnam. Shin was then tasked with immediately forming a team to compete in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification round.

Under the management of Shin Tae-yong, the majority of the senior team was reshuffled to include many young players of whom the majority were from the Indonesia national under-23 football team. Indonesia made it to the 2020 AFF Championship final with an average player age of 23.

====2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification====

In the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Indonesia defeated host and former Asian champions, Kuwait, whom they had not defeated in 42 years, 2–1, to the surprise of many people, the first official win by a Southeast Asian team against a West Asian host since 2004 (when Thailand beat Yemen 3–0 in Sana&#x27;a during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification), and was the first time in the history that a Southeast Asian team had won against a Persian Gulf team as the visitor. In the final match, Indonesia massively beat Nepal 7–0 at the Jaber Al-Ahmad International Stadium. Boosted by the win, Indonesia qualified for the upcoming 2023 AFC Asian Cup after a 16-year absence. Indonesia would be drawn with the top AFC rank team, Japan, Iraq, and Southeast Asia rival, Vietnam.

==== 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification ====

On 19 June 2023, Indonesia hosted 2022 FIFA World Cup champions, Argentina in preparation for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification. Indonesia massively played well holding the world&#x27;s champion but a long strike from Leandro Paredes settled a 1–0 win right before halftime. In the second half, Cristian Romero scored a header to level it up to 2–0 for the Argentines.

Indonesia started the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification from the first round, as they convincingly defeated Brunei in a 12–0 aggregates.

In the second round, Indonesia were put in a group with the same two teams that were drawn with Indonesia too in the upcoming AFC Asian Cup, Iraq, and two Southeast Asia rivals, Vietnam, and Philippines. Indonesia started the second round with a 5–1 defeat against Iraq in Basra, and a draw against Philippines in Manila.

====2023 AFC Asian Cup====
Indonesia then started off 2024 playing two friendly matches against Libya at the Mardan Sports Complex in Turkey before flying off to Qatar for the last friendly match against Iran as the final preparation for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup tournament, which Indonesia lost all the three matches.

In the first match, Indonesia faced off against Iraq just after two months of facing each other, in a 1–3 loss. In the second match, Indonesia faced off against Southeast Asia rival Vietnam where captain, Asnawi Mangkualam converted a goal from the penalty spot to score the only goal in the match, it was the first time Indonesia defeated Vietnam after 7 years, as Indonesia gained 3 points. In the last group match, Indonesia lost 3–1 to the AFC top rank team, Japan.

Despite with two losses in the group stage, Indonesia qualified into Round of 16 by finishing as one of the four best third-place groups which was confirmed after another match in Group F between Kyrgyzstan and Oman ended in a draw. For the first time ever, Indonesia passed through to the knockout stage of the AFC Asian Cup since their first appearance in 1996 AFC Asian Cup. Indonesia faced against Australia in the Round of 16, and the team&#x27;s run ended with a 4–0 loss.

====Advanced to the third round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification====

At the continuation of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Indonesia managed to beat Vietnam again twice on 21 &amp; 26 March, in a 1–0 on Jakarta and 3–0 on Hanoi victories respectively, the latter would be the first time since 2004 that Indonesia defeated Vietnam in their own home ground. Thus Indonesia climbed up to the second place of the group with 7 points. The two victories also made Indonesia surpass ASEAN rivals, Philippines and Malaysia in the FIFA ranking, the latter would be the first time Indonesia placed above Malaysia in the FIFA ranking in 5 years.

On 25 April 2024, PSSI president Erick Thohir announced that Shin&#x27;s contract is officially extended until 2027.

In June 2024, continuing the FIFA World Cup qualifiers second round last two matches at home, Indonesia lost 0–2 to Iraq once again. However, in the last match, Indonesia defeated the Philippines 2–0 at home. Indonesia would end up finishing as Group F runner-up, thus they qualified to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup and for the first time in history they advanced to the third round of World Cup qualification. In the third round, Indonesia were drawn into Group C which consisted of powerhouse like Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, China, and Bahrain. Indonesia started off their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in September 2024 where they draw 1–1 against Saudi Arabia in Jeddah and a goalless draw with Australia at home. In October 2024, Indonesia draw 2–2 with Bahrain in Riffa but however suffered a 2–1 defeat to China in Qingdao. In November 2024, Indonesia suffered a heavy 4–0 defeat to Japan at home. However, in the next match, Indonesia surprised the entire world with a shock as they defeated Saudi Arabia 2–0 with Marselino Ferdinan scoring a brace, thus breaking the record of Southeast Asian countries that have never beaten Saudi Arabia.

====2024 ASEAN Championship====
In the 2024 ASEAN Championship, Indonesia did not field their FIFA World Cup Qualification&#x27;s main squad, with the majority of players fielded and called for Training Camp (TC) were from the U-16 and U-20 squads, with the addition of several veteran players who have played in 2023 AFC Asian Cup and the current 2026 World Cup Qualification. Indonesia is in Group B, of which contains Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar, and Laos. Indonesia only brought up an average of 20.4 years old squads, and they were knocked out from the group stage, after managed to only get one victory.

==== Shin&#x27;s Contract Termination ====
On 6 January 2025, PSSI and Shin have mutually agreed to terminate the contract. It was speculated by Erick Thohir, the dismissal was due to communication and tactic issues, and the lost against China and the failure in the ASEAN Championship became the decisive factors.

===2025–present: Patrick Kluivert===
Following Shin Tae-yong&#x27;s dismissal, on 8 January 2025, the PSSI officially appointed Patrick Kluivert as head coach, with Alex Pastoor and Denny Landzaat assisting him.

===Kits and crest===
During the Dutch colonial era, the team competed as Dutch East Indies in international matches and played in an orange jersey, the national color of the Netherlands. There are no official documents about the team&#x27;s kit, only several black-and-white photos from the match against Hungary in the 1938 FIFA World Cup; but unofficial documents stated that the kit consisted of an orange jersey, white shorts and light blue socks.
Since Indonesia&#x27;s independence, the kit consists of red and white, the colors of the country&#x27;s flag. A combination of green and white has also been used for the away kits and was used for the team&#x27;s participation in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia, until the mid-1980s.

Erspo is the national team&#x27;s kit provider, a sponsorship that began in 2024 after the AFC Asian Cup in Qatar, and is contracted to continue until at least 2026. Previously the team&#x27;s kit was supplied by Nike and Mills. Indonesia also wears other apparel, only when they compete in international sports events such as the Asian Games and the Southeast Asian Games. In those events Indonesia wears Li-Ning, this is due to the Asian Games and SEA Games being multi-sports events all of whose contingents are under the Indonesian National Olympic Committee (NOC).
From 2007 to 2019, Nike was the national team kit provider. The 2010–2012 home kit became an issue when the team played against an opponent wearing an all-white uniform since the socks were white instead of the usual red. The solution was solved with a red-green-green combination (for away games) with green shorts and socks taken from the away kit, or initially an all-red uniform (for home games). After a home defeat in the 2014 World Cup third round qualifier match against Bahrain on 6 September 2011, the red shorts (with green application) were scrapped after its first outing and has never been used again. The red socks had white application on them, different from the red socks with green application worn during training. The combination of red-white-red was used sometimes in the future as the alternate home kit, for example on the subsequent home matches of the qualifiers against Qatar and Iran later that year.

On 31 May 2018, Nike released Indonesia&#x27;s new home and away kits. The home shirt was red with a golden Nike logo inspired by the country&#x27;s national emblem, the Garuda Pancasila. The home kit consisted of a red-white-red combination. The away kit consisted of a white-green-white combination with a green Nike logo on the shirt.

In 2020, Indonesia started using new apparel from local brands Mills until 2024. The home kit consists of a red-white-red combination with a silhouette in the front of the kit. The away kit consists white-green-white combination with a green horizontal strip across the front of the kit and a smaller white horizontal strip across the green strip. The third kit consists all black combination with golden strips and a silhouette in the front of the kit.

===Rivalries===
Indonesia&#x27;s main rival is Malaysia. It is one of Southeast Asia and Asia&#x27;s best known football rivalries. The countries have played against each other 99 times, of which Indonesia have won 40, drawn 21 and lost 38. The heated political conflict between the two countries in the 1960s transmitted disease to the football field. The infamous &quot;&quot;Ganyang Malaysia&quot;!&quot; statement put forward by Indonesia&#x27;s first president Sukarno in a 1963 political speech in Jakarta was considered an encouragement for the Indonesian team before matches against Malaysia.

The first competitive match between the countries was a 4–2 win for Indonesia in the second round of the 1957 Merdeka Tournament in Kuala Lumpur. Since then, the matches between the two, whether in Jakarta or Kuala Lumpur, have always been packed with spectators and have often resulted controversial incidents. In 2011, two fans died in a stampede during a Southeast Asian Games final between the under-23 teams of Indonesia and Malaysia in Jakarta. The two teams most recently met in the 2020 AFF Championship, with Indonesia winning 4–1.

Another of Indonesia&#x27;s rivalries is based on its geographical proximity to neighboring countries in Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore.

===Media coverage===
The national team has a broadcasting agreement with MNC Media. But from 2020, MNC only covered the national team matches at ASEAN Championship and AFC Asian Cup due to MNC–Lagardère (ASEAN Championship) and AFC broadcasting rights partnership contract. However, other networks like Emtek bought the rights from PSSI only.

Indonesia team qualifiers for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup are broadcast by MNC Media&#x27;s free-to-air television network RCTI (1st round, 2nd round until matchday 5, &amp; 3rd round) and Emtek&#x27;s free-to-air television network Indosiar and SCTV (matchday 6 of 2nd round only).

== Home stadium ==

During Indonesia&#x27;s early days as the Dutch East Indies, there was no stadium that could be recognized as a home ground since the national team never played home games in the country. The national team at that time played four games at neutral venues and one away game. It was only after independence in 1945, the national team used the Ikada Stadium in Jakarta as their home ground. The stadium had a capacity of 30,000 spectators and was also used for the National Sports Week in 1951. It was the largest stadium in Jakarta until 1962. The team used the stadium until 1963 after it was demolished to make way for construction of the National Monument. The site is now known as Merdeka Square.

In 1962, Gelora Bung Karno Stadium was inaugurated as Indonesia&#x27;s new national stadium ahead of the 1962 Asian Games. Located within the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex, Gelora, Tanah Abang, Central Jakarta, the stadium has a seating capacity of over 77,193 spectators and is currently the 40th largest association football stadium in the world. Indonesia&#x27;s first match at the stadium was played on 27 August 1962 against Philippines, where Indonesia won the match 6–0. Indonesia has used the stadium for almost every major home game, including the 2007 AFC Asian Cup matches.

In 2023, Jakarta International Stadium was agreed to be the occasional home for the Indonesian national team, based on the agreement between the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) and PT JAKPRO as the developer. Located in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, the stadium was inaugurated in 2022 and has a capacity of 82,000 spectators, making it the largest stadium in Indonesia and largest football-specific stadium in Asia. In addition, Indonesia also uses several stadiums to hold their home matches, such as Gelora Bung Tomo Stadium, Patriot Stadium and Pakansari Stadium.

<text>Itapira is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 75,234 (2020 est.) in an area of 518 km². The elevation is 643 m.

==History==

From the eighteenth century, there were already some residents in the region, whose descendants would stand out in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, through the figures of two citizens: João Gonçalves de Morais and Manuel Pereira da Silva, acclaimed the founders of the primitive Itapira, whose first name was &quot;Macuco.&quot; João Gonçalves de Morais, possessing a large portion of land in the locality, donated a part of them to the Catholic church. fathers, for the people to venerate as patron of the place, which was placed in a small chapel built of wood and inaugurated on March 19, 1821, when the chaplain, Father Antônio de Araújo Ferraz, celebrated the first mass. October 24, 1820, the toppling of a bush cape was begun on the top of the Morais land, and the chapel was erected there. João Gonçalves de Morais was married to Maria Alve s Leme, who gave him four children: Pedro, Manuel, Antonio and Francisco. There are no accurate records of the dates of his birth and death.

Manuel Pereira, trusted person of João Gonçalves de Morais, was the co-founder of Itapira. He was also the &quot;first protector and procurator&quot; of the image of Our Lady of Penha, according to a document left by João Gonçalves de Morais himself. He also owned large tracts of land and left numerous descendants. His father (or grandfather) seems to have been called Manuel Pereira Velho. It is also said that he married twice, the first with Maria Antônia Pereira da Silva and the second with Maria Isabel Pereira da Silva. Nor is there any concrete data on the dates of his birth and death.

Soon, the evolution of Macuco would have a milestone: the arrival of the rich farmer João Baptista de Araújo Cintra in 1840. To him, a member of the traditional and well-to-do family of farmers in the cities of Atibaia, Bragança Paulista and Amparo, and the beginning of the coffee culture, besides the construction of the chamber, the chain and a large mother church, a temple that served the population for a century, until 1955, when it was demolished. For his pioneering spirit, he was awarded the title of commander of the Imperial Order of the Rose. Emperor Dom Pedro II and Empress Teresa Cristina received his residence when the monarch was in the city on October 27, 1886. Commander João Cintra, born in Atibaia in 1805, was the son of the lieutenant Jacinto José de Araújo Cintra and of Maria Francisca Cardoso, having married in 1828 with his niece Maria Jacinta de Araújo Cintra. He died in Itapira with an advanced age, before the end of the century, leaving numerous descendants.

Another expressive date is that of February 8, 1847, when, by Provincial Law No. 1, sanctioned by the president of the province of São Paulo, Manuel da Fonseca Lima e Silva, the parish was raised to hitherto the Curada chapel of Nossa Senhora da Penha. In 1858, José Joaquim Torres, the president of the province of São Paulo, signed Law 4, creating the town of Nossa Senhora da Penha, whose solemn installation took place on September 20 of that same year, together with the first councilors, who had been elected on September 7, the first mayor being Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Lourenço Cintra.

On April 20, 1871, Provincial Law No. 41 gave the name Penha do Rio do Peixe to the town, still a village of Nossa Senhora da Penha. With this law, the provincial government responded to a request from the chamber. Through the ordinance signed by the president of the province, counselor Laurindo Abelardo de Brito, dated October 17, 1879, the town of Penha do Rio do Peixe was elevated to the category of term, creating the civil forum and council of jurors, whose installation was given on 8 November. Later, in 1881, on April 7 of that year, the senator of the empire Florencio de Abreu took office, in the presidency of the province of São Paulo, an authority that had to give the inhabitants of the town of Penha to the category of city. The request made by the chamber was justified on the grounds that the village had a good headquarters, an excellent chain and a chamber house and a population of more than 7,000 souls. On June 27 of that same year, the decree raising the town of Penha do Rio do Peixe was signed by Florêncio de Abreu.

On February 11, 1888, the local slave-owning planters, angered by the action of police chief Joaquim Firmino de Araújo Cunha, who joined the abolitionist movement and gave protection to the slaves fleeing their masters, culminated in the assassination of the police authority. This lamentable happened had great repercussion in all Brazil, causing that the municipal Intendance asked the governor of the state, Prudente de Morais, to change the name of the city, in order that, with the passage of the time, fell in the forgetfulness the pitiful occurred. Thus, through decree no. 40, of April 1, 1890, the city of Penha do Rio do Peixe was called Itapira. A little later, the district of Itapira was created. The São Paulo government had Dr. Bernardino de Campos in front of him when a judicial review of the state was made, creating 25 new counties, including, among them, that of Itapira, through Law No. 80 of August 25 of 1892, and was installed on 8 October of the same year, by the judge of law Jose Maria Bourrol. The meaning of the word Itapira, according to the geographical dictionary of the province of São Paulo, by João Mendes Caldeira, is explained as follows: Ita (stone, (tip, cliff, that is, tip of stone or pointed stone).

== City of the crazy==
The municipality of Itapira is nicknamed the &quot;City of the Mad&quot; because it houses three large psychiatric hospitals, one of which is one of the largest in area in the Americas and the world, the Bairral Institute of Psychiatry, with more than seventy years of tradition, going from the center to the edge of the city (sometimes called the &quot;psychiatric city&quot; institute), the Santa Fé Rest Clinic, world-famous for introducing and using innovative concepts in modern psychiatry, as well as the Cristália clinic located in Itapira road - Lindoia. Because of this, the city of Itapira is known as the pole of the psychiatric treatment, bringing together the greatest professionals of the area in the two institutions.

== Sports ==
=== Football in Itapira===
The municipality of Itapira invests heavily in its football. The team of Sociedade Esportiva Itapirense is currently disputing the Campeonato Paulista Segunda Divisão. The municipal stadium is called Coronel Francisco Vieira, also known as &quot;Chico Vieira&quot;, with capacity for 4,800 people.
Hilderaldo Bellini, who debuted with Itapirense in 1946, captained the winning Brazil National Team in the 1958 World Cup. 
He is credited with being the first World Cup captain to lift the trophy high into the air. Bellini performed in several teams, such as Vasco and São Paulo. After suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, he died on March 20, 2014, in São Paulo, at the age of 83. He was buried in Itapira, where he was received with honors from all Itapirenses and other authorities present.

==Economy==

Today Itapira services an agricultural hinterland which grows oranges, sugar-cane, cattle and (now-declining) coffee, but is also a manufacturing centre, specializing in wood and paper products, agricultural machinery, and ethanol production. The establishment in 1937 (by spiritist groups) of the pioneering Instituto Bairral psychiatric hospital in Itapira has fostered a well-developed health sector, both public and private. The town is home to a large number of professionals (such as the noted economist J.B. de Souza Ferreira Fo.), many of whom commute to neighbouring towns such as Campinas. The current mayor is Toninho Bellini, nephew of the famous footballer mentioned above, and himself a keen football supporter.

The town&#x27;s Historical Museum displays interesting relics of one of the last major battles of the Paulista War, which was fought nearby.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by Companhia Telefônica Brasileira until 1973, when it began to be served by Telecomunicações de São Paulo. In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the Vivo brand in 2012.

The company is currently an operator of cell phones, fixed lines, internet (fiber optics/4G) and television (satellite and cable).

== Religion ==

Christianity is present in the city as follows:

=== Catholic Church ===
The Catholic church in the municipality is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Amparo.

=== Protestant Church ===
The most diverse evangelical beliefs are present in the city, mainly Pentecostal, including the Assemblies of God in Brazil (the largest evangelical church in the country), Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others. These denominations are growing more and more throughout Brazil.

==History==
Settlement began in 1892 with the building of an army telegraph line and station between the city of Goiás (then the state capital) and Mato Grosso, breaking the isolation of the area. The name chosen was Itapirapuã, meaning &quot;white stone from the pool of the fish&quot;, because it was near a deep pool in the river where a whirlpool was formed around a white stone. After half a century of stagnation the settlement received a push forward with the selling by the local government of lots to new settlers. In 1953 it became a district of Goiás, and in 1959 it separated from Goiás and became an independent municipality.

<text>An umwelt (plural: &quot;umwelten&quot;; from the German , meaning &quot;environment&quot; or &quot;surroundings&quot;) is the specific way in which organisms of a particular species perceive and experience the world, shaped by the capabilities of their sensory organs and perceptual systems.

In the semiotic theories of Jakob von Uexküll and Thomas Sebeok, it is considered to be the &quot;biological foundations that lie at the very center of the study of both communication and signification in the human [and non-human] animal&quot;. Often translated as &quot;self-centered world,&quot; the term highlights how organisms, despite sharing the same physical environment, can inhabit distinct perceptual realities.

Uexküll proposed that each species has its own &quot;umwelt&quot;, a notion complemented by related concepts like &quot;Umgebung&quot; (the environment or &quot;Umwelt&quot; as observed externally) and &quot;Innenwelt&quot; (the internal mapping of the self to the external world). These ideas hold particular significance for fields such as cognitive philosophy, robotics, and cybernetics, offering insights into resolving complex problems like the infinite regress of the Cartesian Theater—the flawed notion of an endless chain of internal observers watching consciousness, which &quot;Umwelt&quot; reframes as a unified biological process.

==Discussion==

Each functional component of an &quot;umwelt&quot; has a meaning that represents the organism&#x27;s model of the world. These functional components correspond approximately to perceptual features, as described by Anne Treisman. It is also the semiotic world of the organism, including all the meaningful aspects of the world for any particular organism. It can be water, food, shelter, potential threats or points of reference for navigation. An organism creates and reshapes its own &quot;umwelt&quot; when it interacts with the world. This is termed a &#x27;functional circle&#x27;. The &quot;umwelt&quot; theory states that the mind and the world are inseparable because it is the mind that interprets the world for the organism. Because of the individuality and uniqueness of the history of every single organism, the &quot;umwelten&quot; of different organisms differ. When two &quot;umwelten&quot; interact, this creates a semiosphere.

As a term, &quot;umwelt&quot; also unites all the semiotic processes of an organism into a whole. Internally, an organism is the sum of its parts operating in functional circles and, to survive, all the parts must work cooperatively. This is termed the &quot;collective &quot;umwelt&quot;&quot; which models the organism as a centralised system from the cellular level upward. This requires the semiosis of any one part to be continuously connected to any other semiosis operating within the same organism. If anything disrupts this process, the organism will not operate efficiently.

Uexküll&#x27;s writings show a specific interest in the various worlds that he believed to exist (&#x27;conceptually&#x27;) from the point of view of the &quot;umwelt&quot; of different creatures such as ticks, sea urchins, amoebae, jellyfish, and sea worms.

The biosemiotic turn in Jakob von Uexküll&#x27;s analysis occurs in his discussion of the animal&#x27;s relationship with its environment. The &quot;umwelt&quot; is for him an environment-world which is, according to Agamben, &quot;constituted by a more or less broad series of elements [called] &#x27;carriers of significance&#x27; or &#x27;marks&#x27; which are the only things that interest the animal&quot;. Agamben goes on to paraphrase Uexküll&#x27;s example of the tick, saying:

&quot;...this eyeless animal finds the way to her watchpoint [at the top of a tall blade of grass] with the help of only its skin’s general sensitivity to light. The approach of her prey becomes apparent to this blind and deaf bandit only through her sense of smell. The odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals, works on the tick as a signal that causes her to abandon her post (on top of the blade of grass/bush) and fall blindly downward toward her prey. If she is fortunate enough to fall on something warm (which she perceives by means of an organ sensible to a precise temperature) then she has attained her prey, the warm-blooded animal, and thereafter needs only the help of her sense of touch to find the least hairy spot possible and embed herself up to her head in the cutaneous tissue of her prey. She can now slowly suck up a stream of warm blood.&quot;
Thus, for the tick, the &quot;umwelt&quot; is reduced to only three (biosemiotic) carriers of significance: (1) the odor of butyric acid, which emanates from the sebaceous follicles of all mammals; (2) the temperature of 37°C (corresponding to the blood of all mammals); and (3) the hairy topography of mammals.

==Critics==
Uexküll&#x27;s application of the notion of &quot;umwelt&quot; to the human person has been contested. In &quot;Welt und Umwelt&quot; and &quot;Die Wahrheit der Dinge&quot;, the philosopher and sociologist Josef Pieper argued that reason allows the human person to live in &quot;Welt&quot; (world) while plants and animals do indeed live in an Umwelt—a notion he traces back far beyond Uexküll to Plato, Aristotle, and Thomas Aquinas.

<text>Baydon is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England about south-east of Swindon. The eastern boundary of the parish forms part of the county boundary with Berkshire, and the village is about north-west of the West Berkshire market town of Hungerford.

==History==
Baydon is close to the Ridgeway, a pre-Roman road. The village is on the Ermin Way Roman road which runs north-west towards Cirencester and forms part of the western boundary of the parish. (The road is called Ermin Street locally but is not to be confused with the Ermine Street between London and York.)

The earliest known reference to Baydon is in 1196. The land was part of the Bishop of Salisbury&#x27;s Ramsbury estate until most of it was sold in the later 17th century. Later landowners include Sir Francis Burdett (1770–1844), a long-serving Member of Parliament who married Sophia Coutts, a daughter of the wealthy banker Thomas Coutts. Their daughter Angela inherited the Coutts fortune, and her philanthropy included rebuilding several cottages in the village between 1875 and 1890.

Bailey Hill farm, the demesne land of Ramsbury manor in the north of the parish, was sold in 1681 and passed through several owners until it was bought by Lord Craven in 1800; it remained in Craven ownership until 1947. In the south of the parish, the land of Baydon House farm also had a succession of owners from the 17th century. The Wiltshire Victoria County History traces the ownership of other smaller estates. One source states that Sir Isaac Newton had an estate at Baydon, which he gave away shortly before his death in 1727.

The population of the parish peaked at 380 around the time of the 1861 census, then fell steadily to 213 in 1921 before rising sharply from the 1960s, as it became a dormitory community for people working in Swindon.

Until the 1790s, when it became an independent ecclesiastical parish, Baydon was a tithing and chapelry of Ramsbury parish within Ramsbury hundred.

The M4 motorway which passes just north of the village was opened on 22 December 1971.

==Religious sites==

=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church, dedicated since the 19th century to Saint Nicholas, has a Norman nave and two-bay north arcade, while the south aisle and northern clerestory are Early English Gothic. The north aisle was rebuilt in 1857–1858 by the Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street, who also designed a new east window. The south clerestory is Perpendicular Gothic. The west window, dated 1928, is by Edward Woore and is a memorial to the Rev. Augustus Gibson. The church is Grade II* listed.

The font, partly octagonal, is probably from the 13th century. The three bells are dated 1744 (cast nearby at Aldbourne by John Stares), 1670 and 1650.

The church was dependant on Holy Cross at Ramsbury, and the prebendary of Ramsbury appointed chaplains until the living became a perpetual curacy in the 19th century. In 1956 the incumbent was authorised to hold both Aldbourne and Baydon, and the two benefices were united in 1965. Today the church is one of six in the Whitton grouping.

=== Others ===
A Particular Baptist chapel named Providence Chapel was built in 1806; it closed between 1885 and 1922, then was demolished. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1823; by 1939 it was a private house.

== Notable buildings ==
A barn at Finches Farm, with flint walls and a generous thatched roof, is from the 17th century. Baydon House Farmhouse has a 1744 date-stone. The school (1843, next to the church) and the former vicarage (1857, west of the church) were designed by Wiltshire architect T. H. Wyatt, in brick with flint bands.

The water tower on Finches Lane near the M4, designed in the 1970s by Edmund Percey for Scherrer and Hicks, is described by Pevsner as &quot;a striking design ... the tank clasped by tapering concrete piers&quot;.

==Amenities==
The village school is now Baydon St Nicholas Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School.

Baydon Village Stores incorporates a Post Office. The village pub, the &quot;Red Lion&quot; (closed in 2019), has however reopened as a restaurant/bar under the new name Fancy B.

Baydon is close the local Motorway, the M4, which provides easy access to Bristol to the west and London to the east. 

==Notable residents==
Ian Lomax (1931–1996, cricketer) farmed near Baydon. 

Kevin Wilkinson (1958–1999, pop musician) lived at Baydon.

<doc id="1044568" wikidata="Q166089" url="?curid=1044568" title="Abraham Lincoln (1930 film)">
<text>Abraham Lincoln, also released under the title D. W. Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, is a 1930 pre-Code American biographical film about Abraham Lincoln directed by D. W. Griffith. It stars Walter Huston as Lincoln and Una Merkel, in her second speaking role, as Ann Rutledge. The script was co-written by Stephen Vincent Benét, author of the Civil War prose poem &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; (1928), and Gerrit Lloyd. This was the first of only two sound films made by Griffith.

The film entered the public domain in 1958 when the initial copyright expired. The copyright holders did not elect to extend it for a second 28-year term.

== Synopsis ==

The first act of the film covers Lincoln&#x27;s early life as a storekeeper and rail-splitter in New Salem and his early romance with Ann Rutledge, and his early years as a lawyer and his courtship and marriage to Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois. The majority of the film deals with Lincoln&#x27;s presidency during the American Civil War and culminates with Lee&#x27;s surrender and Lincoln&#x27;s assassination at Ford&#x27;s Theatre.

==Cast==
Characters in the order of their appearance:
==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;quite a worthy pictorial offering with a genuinely fine and inspiring performance by Walter Huston in the role of the martyred President&quot; and later put it on his year-end list of the ten best films of 1930.

&quot;More than an outstanding classic of sound pictures, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; eclipses the most conservative illusion of a modernized &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;&quot;, wrote &quot;Variety&quot; in a rave review. &quot;It is a startlingly superlative accomplishment; one rejuvenating a greatest Griffith. In characterization and detail perfection it is such as to be almost unbelievable.&quot; &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it a &quot;distinguished and human narrative&quot; and wrote that Huston&#x27;s performance &quot;may be listed as one of the 10 best of the year – or any talker year.&quot;

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that it was &quot;by and large...a pretty high-grade picture.&quot; Despite these accolades, however, the film&#x27;s box office performance was uneven.

==Historical accuracy==
The film covers some little-known aspects of Lincoln&#x27;s early life, such as his romance with Ann Rutledge, his depression and feared suicidal tendencies after her death, and his unexplained ending of his engagement with Mary Todd. However, the film surmises that the cause was because of his unresolved feelings over Ann Rutledge, and it adds a dramatic scene in which Lincoln stands Mary up on their scheduled wedding day. In reality, Lincoln ended the engagement before the wedding day. He later had regrets about his decision and returned to ask Mary&#x27;s hand in marriage, and they were married, as happens in the film.

While the early scenes of Lincoln&#x27;s life are remarkably accurate, many of the later scenes contain historical inaccuracies. The Lincoln-Douglas debates, in addition to the historically accurate topic of the extension of slavery, are turned into an argument about secession. Lincoln was an underdog for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1860, but the film suggests that he was the sole nominee as a result of the Lincoln-Douglas debates.

The outbreak of the Civil War seems to be the Union firing on Charleston, South Carolina from Fort Sumter rather than the other way around. Also, early in hostilities, General Winfield Scott is depicted as being overconfident of a quick victory and something of a buffoon, but in reality, he was one of the voices in the minority claiming the war would be long, costly, and bloody.

In the film, Lincoln receives a report from the Secret Service that some Copperheads in the North have issued threats against him. However, in reality, the Secret Service was not created until two months after Lincoln&#x27;s death.

Finally, in the film&#x27;s climax, Lincoln delivers a conflation of the words of the Gettysburg Address and Second Inaugural Address at Ford&#x27;s Theatre on April 14, 1865, moments before his assassination. This movie was Griffith&#x27;s second portrayal of Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, and the first was in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;.

==Preservation status==
&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; is part of the David Wark Griffith collection at the Museum of Modern Art, and it was donated as a gift from screenwriter-producer Paul Killiam, a collector of silent movies. Funding for the preservation of this film was provided by The Lillian Gish Trust for Film Preservation, The Film Foundation, and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

==Legacy==
More recent assessments of &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; have been less effusive in their praise of the film, finding that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; has not aged well. In 1978, the film was included as one of the choices in the book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;, criticizing the film&#x27;s historical inaccuracies, instances of clumsy dialogue and Merkel&#x27;s melodramatic acting style. Glenn Erickson, reviewing the DVD in 2012, wrote that it &quot;comes off as an interesting curio. Its earnest simplicity seems more dated than ever, despite the fine performance of Walter Huston in the lead role.&quot;

Film historian Melvyn Stokes found that &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;″s episodic structure &quot;came at the cost of dramatic tension&quot; and suggested that the film&#x27;s disappointing box-office performance was due to its having &quot;nothing of major importance and relevance to say about its subject to moviegoers of Depression-era America.&quot; &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was the first sound film about the Civil War which veterans of that war could view.

<doc id="1044571" wikidata="Q6658420" url="?curid=1044571" title="Liverpool Empire Theatre">
<text>The Liverpool Empire Theatre is a theatre on the corner of Lime Street in Liverpool, England. The playhouse, which opened in 1925, is the second one to be built on the site. It has the largest two-tier auditorium in the United Kingdom and can seat 2,348 people.

==History==
The site&#x27;s first theatre, which at that time was Liverpool&#x27;s largest, was named the &quot;New Prince of Wales Theatre and Opera House&quot; opened on 15 October 1866. On 29 July 1867 its name was changed to the &quot;Royal Alexandra Theatre and Opera House&quot; in honour of Princess Alexandra, Princess of Wales. In 1894, the playhouse closed but was re-opened the following year under the ownership of Empire Theatre (Liverpool) Ltd. In 1896 the theatre was sold to Messrs. Moss and Thornton for £30,000 (), and renamed &quot;The Empire&quot;. It closed for the final time on 16 February 1924, and was demolished.

The current Liverpool Empire Theatre opened on 9 March 1925. In 1977 the theatre was still owned by Moss Empires, who were making plans to dispose of it. Two years later it was acquired by Merseyside County Council. During the following two years a total of £680,000 was spent on improving the back stage facilities, and extending the stage and orchestra pit. The theatre underwent a further major refurbishment in 1999; this included increasing the size of the stage and improving the facilities for the audience. By 2002 the theatre was owned by Clear Channel Entertainment. In that year an extension was built on the north side of the building.

==Architecture==

===Exterior===
The theatre was designed by W. and T. R. Milburn for Moss Empires; the carving and the ornamentation in the auditorium were carried out by E. O. Griffiths. The building is constructed on a steel frame, with a Portland stone façade and brick elsewhere. The architectural style of the façade is free Neoclassical. The front of the theatre is in five bays, the central three of which have an attic rising above the two lateral bays. The ground floor of the central bays contains the entrance doors and over them is a steel canopy decorated with medallions and guilloché bands. The storey above ground level contains the balcony, with single and paired Ionic columns, between which are recessed windows. Over this is a dentilled cornice and the attic. In the first floor of the side bays there are windows in architraves that are flanked by shallow pilasters above which is a plain parapet.

===Interior===
The entrance foyer is on the ground level, with stairs to the balcony on both sides of the foyer. The seats are raked both to the sides and to the rear in order to improve the lines of sight. The internal decoration is in Louis XVI style. It contains &quot;many curious decorative features including carved elephant caryatids&quot;.

===Conservation===
The theatre was listed in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II listed building on 16 October 1990. When it was opened its design was considered advanced, owing to the raked seating layout. There are 2,350 seats, Britain&#x27;s largest two-tier auditorium. It is sited in the William Brown Street Conservation Area.

===Past performances===
Performers in the original theatre included George Formby Sr., Harry Tate, Dan Leno, Florrie Forde, The Two Bobs, and Wilson, Keppel and Betty. The first production in the present theatre was &quot;Better Days&quot;, starring Stanley Lupino, Maisie Gay and Ruth French. Subsequent performers have included Fred Astaire and his sister Adele Astaire, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, Mae West, Laurel and Hardy, Roy Rogers and Trigger, Charlton Heston, Sarah Bernhardt, Henry Irving, Vesta Tilley, and Arthur Askey.

In 1957 a local pop group called The Quarrymen appeared at the theatre. They returned in 1959, having changed their name to &quot;Johnny and the Moondogs&quot;. They returned to the Empire again in 1962, now named The Beatles. The Beatles played the Empire for the last time on 5 December 1965. 

The Rolling Stones performed at the Empire Theatre with Ike &amp; Tina Turner and The Yardbirds on 25 September 1966.

During the 1970s, two Royal Command Performances were held in the Empire, and in 2007 the theatre was the venue for the Royal Variety Performance in recognition of Liverpool being made the European Capital of Culture the following year.

Singers and musicians who performed at the venue include Johnny Mathis, The Carpenters, Neil Sedaka, The Osmonds, Tommy Steel, Adam Faith, Bruce Forsyth, Victoria Wood, Morecambe and Wise, Ken Dodd, Shirley Bassey, Kylie Minogue, Kate Bush, Elton John, Cilla Black, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Chuck Berry, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rush, Wishbone Ash, The Police, Queen, Santana, Iron Maiden, Genesis, Steve Hillage, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel (the band&#x27;s 1976 concert at the theatre is frequently alluded to by Steve Harley when he plays concerts in the North of England, since, during the extended instrumental in his song &#x27;Death Trip&#x27; (track 10 of 1973&#x27;s &#x27;The Human Menagerie&#x27; album), he fell off the stage and into the orchestra pit, but continued performing as though nothing had happened, despite breaking 3 ribs and as a result having to cancel the rest of the tour).

==Present day==
The Empire Theatre continues to stage productions in various genres, including musicals, pop concerts, comedians, plays, opera, and wrestling. The theatre is reputed to be haunted by at least two ghosts, one a former painter at the theatre called Len, the other a girl aged about nine or ten in Victorian dress. As of 2011 the Empire is part of the Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG).

Each year a musical is produced at the theatre performed by participants in Stage Experience, a two-week summer school in which local youngsters take part in performing a full-scale musical with a professional team. This began in 2007 with &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;, followed by &quot;The Wiz&quot; in 2008, &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; in 2009, &quot;Fame&quot; in 2010, &quot;West Side Story&quot; in 2011, &quot;Annie&quot; in 2012, &quot;Grease&quot; in 2013, &quot;Cats in 2014&quot;, and &quot;Rent&quot; in 2019.

<doc id="1044574" wikidata="Q4677505" url="?curid=1044574" title="Active Fuel Management">
<text>Active Fuel Management (formerly known as displacement on demand (DoD)) is a trademarked name for the automobile variable displacement technology from General Motors. It allows a V6 or V8 engine to &quot;turn off&quot; half of the cylinders under light-load conditions to improve fuel economy. Estimated performance on EPA tests shows a 5.5–7.5% improvement in fuel economy.

GM&#x27;s Active Fuel Management technology used a solenoid to deactivate the lifters on selected cylinders of a pushrod V-layout engine.

GM used the Active Fuel Management technology on a range of engines including with the GM Small Block Gen IV engine family, first-generation GM EcoTec3 engine family, second-generation GM High-Feature V6 DOHC engine family, and first-generation High-Feature V8 DOHC engine family. Vehicle applications included the 2005 Chevy TrailBlazer EXT, the GMC Envoy XL, Envoy XUV, and Pontiac Grand Prix.

==Displacement on demand==
General Motors was the first to modify existing production engines to enable cylinder deactivation, with the introduction of the Cadillac &quot;L62&quot; &quot;V8-6-4&quot; in 1981.

==Second generation==
In 2004, the electronics side was improved greatly with the introductions of Electronic Throttle Control, electronically controlled transmissions, and transient engine and transmission controls. In addition, computing power was vastly increased. A solenoid control valve assembly integrated into the engine valley cover contains solenoid valves that provide a pressurized oil signal to specially designed hydraulic roller lifters provided by Eaton Corp. and Delphi. These lifters disable and re-enable exhaust and intake valve operation to deactivate and reactivate engine cylinders . Unlike the first generation system, only half of the cylinders can be deactivated. It is notable that the second generation system uses engine oil to hydraulically modulate engine valve function. As a result, the system is dependent upon the quality of the oil in the engine. As anti-foaming agents in engine oil are depleted, air may become entrained or dissolve in the oil, delaying the timing of hydraulic control signals. Similarly engine oil viscosity and cleanliness is a factor. Use of the incorrect oil type, i.e. SAE 10W40 instead of SAE 5W30, or the failure to change the engine oil or oil filter at factory recommended intervals, can also significantly impair system performance.

In 2001, GM showcased the 2002 Cadillac Cien concept car, which featured Northstar XV12 engine with Displacement on Demand. Later that year, GM debuted Opel Signum² concept car in Frankfurt Auto Show, which uses the global XV8 engine with displacement on demand. In 2003, GM unveiled the Cadillac Sixteen concept car at the Detroit Opera House, which featured an XV16 concept engine that can switch between 4, 8, and 16 cylinders.

On April 8, 2003, General Motors announced this technology (now called Active Fuel Management) to be commercially available on 2005 GMC Envoy XL, Envoy XUV and Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT using optional Vortec 5300 V8 engine. GM also extended the technology on the new High Value &quot;LZ8&quot; V6 engine in the Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo as well as the 5.3L V8 LS4 engine in the last generation Chevrolet Impala SS, Monte Carlo SS and Pontiac Grand Prix GXP. In both designs, half of the cylinders can be switched off under light loads.

On July 21, 2008, General Motors unveiled the production version of the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro. The Camaro SS with an automatic transmission features the GM L99 engine, a development of the LS3 with Active Fuel Management which allowed it to run on four cylinders during light load conditions.

==Third generation==
In January 2018, GM announced an improved version of AFM called &quot;Dynamic Fuel Management&quot; to be initially released in Chevy Silverado trucks. This system shuts off any number of cylinders in a variety of combinations, maximizing fuel economy and avoiding switching between banks of cylinders. This is achieved by using oil pressure solenoids to collapse each individual hydraulic valve lifter, allowing for fully independent individual cylinder control. The system is based on &quot;Dynamic Skip Fire,&quot; a technology developed by California company Tula Technology. The 6.2L V8 engine of the Chevrolet Silverado incorporating the technology was named one of Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines for 2019.

<text>Itaquaquecetuba, also simply called Itaquá, is a municipality in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo. The population is 375,011 (2020 est.) in an area of . It sits at an elevation of .

The municipality was founded between 1560 and 1563 by Jesuits led by Father Joseph of Anchieta, among native villages near the Tietê River, beginning with the Catholic chapel of Our Lady of Acute, which was established by Father Joseph. The settlement saw little development, and was almost deserted by the early twentieth century. Until 1958 the city was a district of Mogi das Cruzes. Following the emancipation of the municipality that year, the first Mayor, Victorio Eugenio Deliberato, began a campaign of industrial development that had great geographic and economic impact on Itaquaquecetuba in the decades to come.

Today, Itaquaquecetuba is one of the 10 best Brazilian cities who had significant advances in challenges against inequality in the last 20 years, and has the second-best GDP in the region.

It ranked 199th on the list of cities with the highest homicide rates per 100,000 inhabitants. Itaquaquecetuba has a strong industrial vocation due to its geographic location: highways such as SP-66, SP-56, SP-88 and the Ayrton Senna Highway pass through the city, connecting the city to cities such as Mogi das Cruzes, Poá, Suzano, Ferraz de Vasconcelos and Arujá. The city also borders other large urban centers, such as the state capital and Guarulhos.

== History ==
The origin of the city dates back to Itaquaquecetuba of the twelve villages founded by the Jesuit priest José de Anchieta, in his long stay in Brazil. Its creation is due to the then president of the province, Bernardo José Pinto Gavião Peixoto, named village of Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, on September 7, 1560, being established in the River Tietê, to catechize the guaianases.

<text>Pantelleria (; Sicilian: &quot;Pantiḍḍirìa&quot;; ), known in ancient times as Cossyra or Cossura, is an Italian island and comune in the Strait of Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea, southwest of Sicily and east of the Tunisian coast. On clear days Tunisia is visible from the island. Administratively Pantelleria&#x27;s comune belongs to the Sicilian province of Trapani.

According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics, the population of Pantelleria was in 2022.

==Description==
With an area of , Pantelleria is the largest volcanic satellite island of Sicily. The last eruption occurred below sea level in 1891, and today phenomena related to volcanic activity are present, such as hot springs and fumaroles. The highest peak, the &quot;Montagna Grande&quot;, reaches above sea level. The islanders speak Pantesco, a dialect of Sicilian influenced by Arabic.

Specchio di Venere lake is a soda lake.

==Names==
The Carthaginians knew the island as () or ().

The Greek geographers recorded it as &quot;Kossyra&quot; () and &quot;Kossyros&quot; (), which became the Latin . This appears in Arabic as &quot;Qawṣirah&quot; () and Maltese as the former name .

The original Arab name for the island was &quot;Bint al-Riyāḥ&quot; (Arabic: and Maltese: &quot;Bint l-Irjieħ&quot;), meaning &quot;Daughter of the Winds&quot; after the strong gales that can arise off the north coast of Africa.

Its Sicilian name is , which gave rise to the present Maltese name .

== History ==

The earliest evidence of human activity dates to the Neolithic, where it appears visitors to the island would arrive temporarily in order to extract obsidian for dispersion elsewhere in the central Mediterranean. The earliest permanent settlement would not begin until the Bronze Age, with the primary site, Mursia, being the only settlement known from the period. The iconic Sesi, megalithic multi-burial structures, would be built during this period as well.

The original population of Pantelleria did not come from Sicily, but were of Iberian or Ibero-Ligurian ancestry. After a considerable interval, during which the island probably remained uninhabited, the Carthaginians took possession of it, no doubt owing to its importance as a station on the way to Sicily. This probably occurred around the beginning of the 7th centuryBC. Their acropolis was the twin hill of San Marco and Santa Teresa, south of the present town of Pantelleria. The town has considerable remains of walls made of rectangular blocks of masonry and also of a number of cisterns. Punic tombs have been discovered, and the votive terra-cottas of a small sanctuary of the Punic period were found near the north coast.

The Romans occupied the island as the &quot;Fasti Triumphales&quot; record in 255BC, lost it again the next year, and recovered it in 217BC. It struck bronze coins, originally with a Punic inscription but changing to Latin by the 1st centuryBC. Under the empire, it served as a place of banishment for prominent persons and members of the imperial family. The town enjoyed municipal rights.

In AD700, Arabs conquered the island. In 1123, Roger II of Sicily took the island, and in 1311 an Aragonese fleet under the command of Lluís de Requesens won a considerable victory here. Requesens&#x27;s family became princes of Pantelleria until 1553, when a Turkish fleet commanded by Dragut sacked the island. A naval battle took place near the island in July 1586 when an armed English merchant fleet of five ships managed to repel an attack by eleven Spanish and Maltese galleys.

A Siculo-Arabic dialect similar to Maltese was the vernacular of the island until the late 18th century, when the Romance Sicilian superseded it. The modern Sicilian language in Pantelleria contains many Arabic loanwords, and most of the island&#x27;s place names are of Semitic origin.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the British considered the possibility of taking over Pantelleria (together with Lampedusa and Linosa) so as to be able to supply Malta, but a royal commission stated in an 1812 report that there would be considerable difficulties in this venture.

Pantelleria&#x27;s capture was regarded as crucial to Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 as planes based on Pantelleria could readily reach Sicily. In Operation Corkscrew the Allies bombarded Pantelleria heavily from air and sea in the days before the invasion. The garrison surrendered as the landing troops approached. Pantelleria then became a vital base for Allied aircraft during the assault on Sicily.

===Archaeological sites===
A Middle Bronze Age village was on the west coast, southeast of the harbour, with a rampart of small blocks of lava, about high, wide at the base and at the top, upon the undefended eastern side. Remains of huts were found there, with pottery, tools of obsidian, and other artifacts. These objects are in the museum at Syracuse.

To the southeast, in the district known as the Cunelie, are many tombs, known as &quot;sesi&quot;. They are similar in character to the nuraghe of Sardinia, though of smaller size, and consist of round or elliptical towers with sepulchral chambers in them, built of rough blocks of lava. Fifty-seven of them can still be traced. The largest is an ellipse of about , but most of the &quot;sesi&quot; have a diameter of only . The identical character of the pottery found in the &quot;sesi&quot; with that found in the prehistoric village proves that the former are the tombs of the inhabitants of the latter.

===Monuments and other buildings ===

The island has scattered typical one-level buildings called &quot;dammuso&quot; of unknown but probably remote origins. A &quot;dammuso&quot; is a dry stone building with thick walls that usually appear black due to the extensive use of volcanic rock. They have characteristic domes on top painted white to avoid overheating. The domes collect rainwater that is directed to a large tank (usually below the building) or to the nearby soil for use in the dry season.

Most of the other constructions were destroyed during the Second World War. One notable exception is the castle &quot;Barbacane&quot;, a renaissance building formed by an irregularly quadrangular plan with internal court joined to a squared base tower.

== Geology ==

The island of Pantelleria is located above a drowned continental rift in the Strait of Sicily and has been the focus of intensive volcano-tectonic activity. The 15 kilometre-long () island is the emergent summit of a largely submarine edifice. Two large Pleistocene calderas dominate the island, the older of the two formed about 114,000 years ago and the younger Cinque Denti caldera formed about 45,000 years ago. The eruption that formed the Cinque Denti caldera produced the distinctive green tuff deposit that covers much of the island, and is found across the Mediterranean, as far away as the island of Lesbos in the Aegean Sea. Holocene eruptions have constructed pumice cones, lava domes, and short, blocky lava flows.

Later activity constructed the cone of Monte Gibele, part of which was subsequently uplifted to form Montagna Grande. Several vents are located on three sides of the uplifted Montagna Grande block on the southeast side of the island. A submarine eruption in 1891 from a vent off the northwest coast is the only confirmed historical activity.

Currently the island is subsiding, and Montagna Grande is slowly sinking. This is thought to be caused by the magma beneath the volcano cooling and degassing. There are numerous hot springs and fumaroles on the island due to an active hydrothermal system. Favara Grande, in the south east of the island, is one of the best examples. The island is releasing a small amount of CO2 through passive degassing.
Total carbon stock in the first of soil of Pantelleria is about 230,000 tonnes.
The island is the type locality for pantellerite, a peralkaline rhyolite.

==Climate==
Pantelleria has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) characterized by very warm to hot, almost rainless and humid summers, very mild and frost-free winters, a powerful seasonal lag and a small diurnal temperature range. The constant sea breezes moderate the daytime summer temperatures. Coastal Pantelleria (along with Lampedusa, Kasos, Karpathos, Kastellorizo and coastal Malta) is one of the very few areas along the Mediterranean Sea coast that has never recorded frost. Below freezing temperatures and snow only occur, and sporadically, at Montagna Grande and higher elevations on the island. Despite the very dry summers and the fairly low annual precipitation, the dry season is noticeably short at four months, and the rainy season lasts at least eight months.
==Environment==

Pantelleria National Park (Italian: &quot;Parco Nazionale dell&#x27;Isola di Pantelleria&quot;) was established in 2016, and covers an area of , or 80% of the island.

Specchio di Venere (literally &quot;Venus&#x27; mirror&quot;) is a natural lake formed in an extinct volcanic crater, and fed by rain and hot springs. The lake is deep and is popular for swimming, hot springs, and mud bathing.
Other natural attractions are paths to the sea, a large network of trekking paths, hot springs, and a popular natural sauna fed by vapours filtering through rocks in a small cave. Also situated on the Island is Laghetto delle Ondine (&quot;Pond of the ripples&quot; or &quot;Pond of the wavelets&quot;) a seawater lake which has developed into a very desired swimming hole.

The island has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a population of Eleonora&#x27;s falcons, with some 35–40 breeding pairs estimated in 1994.

== Economy ==

The economy of Pantelleria consists mainly of agriculture and tourism.

=== Wine ===
Pantelleria is noted for its sweet wines, Moscato di Pantelleria and Moscato Passito di Pantelleria, both made from the local Zibibbo grape. In 2014, the traditional agricultural practice of cultivating the &quot;vite ad alberello&quot; (head-trained bush vines) of the community of Pantelleria was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

== Transport ==

The island is served by Pantelleria Airport, which is served by DAT, connecting Trapani and Palermo and other companies in summer, connecting the island with Italian cities such as Milan, Rome, Venice and others. Ferries reach the island from Trapani, and it is near the main east–west route through the Mediterranean Sea.

<text>Pablo Mastroeni (born August 29, 1976) is an American soccer coach and former player who is the head coach of Major League Soccer club Real Salt Lake. He was formerly head coach of the Colorado Rapids, and assistant coach of the Houston Dynamo. In his playing career, he played as a defensive midfielder. Born in Argentina, he played for the United States men&#x27;s national team.

==Early life and education==
Mastroeni moved to the United States from Argentina with his family at the age of four, settling in Phoenix, Arizona. He attended Thunderbird High School and Mountain Sky Middle School, and played youth soccer for the Santos Futbol Clube. Mastroeni attended North Carolina State University where he played on the men&#x27;s soccer team from 1994 to 1997. From 1995 to 1997, he spent the collegiate off season playing for the Tucson Amigos of the USISL.

==Playing career==

===Professional===
In February 1998, the Miami Fusion selected Mastroeni in the second round (thirteenth overall) of the 1998 MLS College Draft.
He played four seasons with the Fusion, becoming a regular starter in his second year with the team in either central defense or defensive midfield, and was named to the MLS Best XI in 2001.

The Fusion was contracted after the 2001 season and Mastroeni was the first overall choice of the 2002 MLS Allocation Draft, going to the Colorado Rapids, whom he captained to their first title in 2010. Mastroeni scored his first MLS playoff goal against the Columbus Crew on October 28, 2010.

Mastroeni was traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy in June 2013 and retired at the end of the season.

In 2021, Mastroeni&#x27;s #25 was retired by the Colorado Rapids. This was the first number retired by the Colorado Rapids.

===International career===

Mastroeni earned his first U.S. cap against Ecuador on June 7, 2001. When Chris Armas went out with an injury just weeks prior to the 2002 World Cup, Mastroeni found himself a starter in the opening game as the U.S. defeated Portugal 3–2.

On January 10, 2005, it was reported that he tore the quadriceps in his left leg and would be out for six to eight weeks. The injury happened while training with the national team.

Mastroeni was named to the 2006 U.S. World Cup squad. In a FIFA World Cup 2006 match against Italy on June 17, Mastroeni was given a red card for an aggressive tackle in the first half. Mastroeni was fined CHF 7,500 and received a three-game suspension, thus missing the last U.S. match of the World Cup and the first two matches of the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

On February 7, 2007, during a friendly between the United States and Mexico, Mastroeni was the team captain.

Mastroeni was called up for the United States&#x27; first World Cup qualifying match of 2010 and two third-round matches, and started three of the first five final round matches for the United States. However, he was not named to the Confederations Cup roster nor any of the squads for the final five qualifiers for the United States.

==Coaching==

===Colorado Rapids===

====2014====
Mastroeni was named the interim head coach of the Colorado Rapids after Oscar Pareja left for FC Dallas in January 2014. He was named head coach of the Rapids on March 8, 2014, one week before the 2014 season began.

In 2014, Mastroeni and the Rapids experienced the worst Rapids season in the 34 game MLS era. Allowing the most goals in the MLS, 62, the Rapids finished second to last in the Western Conference with 32 points.

====2015====
2015 was another unsuccessful campaign for Mastroeni. The Rapids ended the season last in the Western Conference and second to last in the overall standings, receiving the second overall pick in the upcoming MLS Superdraft.

====2016====
During the offseason before the 2016 season, Mastroeni visited London, spending several days watching Arsenal and Tottenham train. While there, he analyzed the coaching styles of Tottenham&#x27;s Mauricio Pochettino and Arsenal&#x27;s Arsène Wenger, before he traveled to Orlando to attend a supplementary coaching course. Mastroeni helped the Rapids establish a team identity in 2016, a defensive based team which operated out of the 4-2-3-1 formation. This identity helped the Rapids to their best regular season record of all time, with a franchise low 6 losses and a franchise high of 58 points. The team allowed an MLS low 32 goals in 2016. Mastroeni finished second in voting for the annual MLS Coach of the Year award.

====2017====
In the offseason, Mastroeni signed a three-year contract extension, through 2019. On August 15, Mastroeni was fired as Head Coach and replaced by Steve Cooke.

=== Houston Dynamo ===
In 2020, Mastroeni was named as an assistant coach for the Houston Dynamo

=== Real Salt Lake ===

====2021====
In 2021, Mastroeni was named as an assistant coach for Real Salt Lake On August 27, 2021, he was named the interim head coach upon Freddy Juarez&#x27;s unexpected midseason departure. On December 13, 2021, Mastroeni was named permanent head coach of the club for the 2022 season.

<text>Itaí is a municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. The population is 27,382 (2020 est.) in an area of 1083 km². The elevation is 614 m. This place name comes from the Tupi language, &quot;Itaí&quot; means river stone. The Tropic of Capricorn crosses the city of Itaí.

== History ==

Farmers close to the mouth of the Taquari River have difficulties in supplying and marketing their products given the distance from the nearest village, which was Faxina (now Itapeva). Thus, in 1869, Salvador de Freitas, José Silveira Melo, Manoel Pedroso de Oliveira and Captain José Floriano, founded on the slope of Serrinha, close to the Carrapatos river, a village with the name of Santo Antônio da Ponta da Serra, a name chosen in tribute to the patron saint and to define the position occupied by the nucleus.

The forty acres of the patrimony were acquired from Bernardino Leite by Salvador de Freitas and José Silveira Melo, Manoel Pedroso and captain José Floriano were responsible for the construction of the first building measuring approximately 80 square meters. In these forty acres a chapel and the first houses in the village were installed.

The village of Santo Antônio, founded by farmers, grew and organized itself around this chapel, which can be considered as the ground zero of the city of Itaí. At the time these buildings were built, a unique structure that existed there was a wooden and clay house, inhabited by Miguel Correa Melo and located at the northern end of today&#x27;s Rua Salvador de Freitas.

As early as 1870, the initial plan of the village was drawn up and the square and streets were demarcated and places. In 1872, the locality already had around fifty habitable houses, showing a high rate of development compared to other villages existing in the region until that time.

This small initial development favored the transformation of the village into a parish on April 16, 1874. From that day on, the new parish was renamed &quot;Santo Antônio da Boa Vista&quot;, belonging to the municipality of Itapetininga. On May 1, 1891, the parish was elevated to the category of village. On December 19, 1906, the village was elevated to the category of city and on November 25, 1920, by state law nº 1748, it completes its current name, Itaí. [3]

The neighboring village, Bom Sucesso (currently Paranapanema), which also began to form, was elevated to the category of parish, passing Santo Antônio da Ponta da Serra to its territory in March 1874. A month later, it was created in village of Santo Antônio das Pedras, a parish of Santo Antônio da Boa Vista, this last name being adopted for the old nucleus. In 1920, it was renamed Itaí, which in Tupi-Guarani means river stone (&quot;ita&quot; = stone + &quot;y&quot; = river).

<doc id="1044598" wikidata="Q15197142" url="?curid=1044598" title="Wispa">
<text>Wispa is a brand of chocolate bar manufactured by British chocolate company Cadbury. Using aerated chocolate, the bar was launched in 1981 as a trial version in North East England, and with its success it was introduced nationally in 1983. It was seen as a competitor to Rowntree&#x27;s Aero (now owned by Nestlé).
In 2003, as part of a relaunch of the Cadbury Dairy Milk brand, the Wispa brand was discontinued and the product relaunched as &quot;Dairy Milk Bubbly&quot;. As part of the relaunch, the product was reshaped as a standard moulded bar (similar to other &#x27;Dairy Milk&#x27; products) instead of a whole-bar count-line.

In 2007, helped by an Internet campaign by enthusiasts, the Wispa bar was relaunched, albeit for a &quot;limited period&quot;. In October 2008, Wispa permanently returned to shops in the UK and Ireland due to the chocolate bar&#x27;s popularity during the previous limited period release.

== Manufacture ==
The tiny bubbles within the chocolate form via aerating the molten chocolate with gas, typically carbon dioxide or nitrogen, while at a high pressure, which causes microscopic gas bubbles to form within the liquid. The liquid is then lowered to atmospheric pressure as it cools, causing the gas pockets to expand and become trapped in the chocolate. Air is not used to make the bubbles as this would oxidize the chocolate.

== Advertising ==
The bar was launched by teaser advertisements in 1983 bearing the phrase &quot;Have you heard the latest Wispa?&quot; which did not identify the product as a chocolate bar. Original Wispa advertisements, all performed to camera in front of a black background, featured well-known actors such as Paul Eddington, Nigel Hawthorne, Victoria Wood, Julie Walters, Simon Cadell, and Ruth Madoc. John Le Mesurier and Arthur Lowe also made a final appearance as their characters from &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

At the time of its comeback in 2008, Wispa was re-launched using large outdoor posters featuring the tagline &quot;It&#x27;s back. Apparently.&quot; and smaller, roadside posters featuring conversations about Wispa returning, which read; &quot;Apparently, the Wispa thing is true. It&#x27;s coming back. Finally. Brilliant.&quot; In December 2009, Wispa aired a television advert entitled &quot;For the love of Wispa&quot;, starring members of the public recruited from an earlier advertising campaign. The advert included cheerleaders, choirs and grandparents, and was aired on 20 December at 8 pm on ITV.

In 2009, to mark the return of Wispa Gold a request for submissions to be considered for an outdoor poster campaign received over 7,000 submissions and featured over 900 different posters across Britain and Ireland&quot;.

In 2015, Mondelēz International shrunk the size of the Bitsa Wispa sharing bag from 130g to 110g and also reduced the size of the Wispa Easter Egg making it 78g lighter. The Wispa chocolate bar wrapper was also redesigned ditching the blue coloured wrapper for the traditional Cadbury purple. The wrapper was redesigned again in 2016, as part of the Cadbury &#x27;Obey Your Mouth&#x27; brand re-positioning, in which the Wispa logo now resembles the shape of a balloon.

==Australia release==
During October or November 2016, Wispa chocolate bars released into IGA stores for around $2. Cadbury Heroes was released in Australia in November 2016 at certain retailers which contained mini Wispas.

In April 2017, Bitsa Wispa 110g bags were released, alongside another three items including chocolate buttons and bite size flakes.

== Discontinuation and relaunch ==
In 2003, Cadbury made Dairy Milk into a family brand by taking existing brands and marketing them as Dairy Milk sub-brands. As part of this change, the Wispa brand was phased out and replaced by &quot;Dairy Milk Bubbly&quot;.

Since the discontinuation of the Wispa bar in 2003, a host of internet campaigns and an online petition to bring it back slowly gained momentum. During Iggy and the Stooges&#x27; 2007 performance at Glastonbury Festival, several Wispa fans invaded the stage armed with a banner saying &quot;Bring Back the Wispa.&quot; In addition, several &quot;Bring Back Wispa&quot; groups on Bebo, MySpace and Facebook were set up. In August 2007, these campaigns prompted Cadbury to announce that the bar would be relaunched on 8 October 2007 for an initial limited production of 23 million bars, with a permanent return possible if sales are high enough. Predictions that the relaunched product would be marketed as &quot;Wispa Classic&quot; proved unfounded, and the new Wispa hit shelves in similar packaging to the original bar, a combination of the original colours and the slightly updated lettering style of the later bars. There have been claims that the spontaneous &#x27;campaign&#x27; was pre-planned and orchestrated by Cadbury, rather than by members of the public.

On 24 August 2007, the first box of the relaunched Wispas was put up for auction on eBay, with a press release from Cadbury stating that the auction was real and that the proceeds were going towards the Cadbury Charity, Ghana for the Source. The winning bid was £195 by a 23 year old Nicholas Bradley from the Isle of Man.

In February 2008, Rebecca Wells auctioned an original out-of-date Wispa bar, which she found in a sofa, on eBay for the charity LAM Action. The initial winning bid of £2,550 was found by eBay to be &quot;unauthorised&quot;. It has since been re-listed, and raised £1,000 for the charity.

The bar returned on a permanent basis in October 2008. Prior to the permanent launch of Wispa, for a limited time a Wispa McFlurry was available at McDonald&#x27;s restaurants until 30 September 2008. 
During Easter 2009, a Wispa Easter Egg was made.

On 14 September 2009, Wispa Gold was relaunched for a limited time, following a Facebook campaign. The product was initially released for sale at Foreways on Warwick Road in Carlisle two weeks earlier, after the shop had been chosen from many around the country as part of a competition. As of 20 January 2010, Wispa Gold once again became available in Australia (having been previously marketed as the Crave bar) following parallel importing by Coles Supermarkets.

On 26 August 2011, it was announced that Wispa Gold would return permanently in November in support of team GB at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

In April 2013, Cadbury launched Wispa Hot Chocolate. A Wispa Gold version of the Wispa Hot Chocolate was launched and Cadbury later launched Wispa Biscuits.

<doc id="1044601" wikidata="Q524418" url="?curid=1044601" title="Hoshana Rabbah">
<text>Hoshana Rabbah (, ) is the seventh day of the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, the 21st day of the month of Tishrei. This day is marked by a special synagogue service, the Hoshana Rabbah, in which seven circuits are made by the worshippers with their lulav and etrog, while the congregation recites &quot;Hoshanot&quot;. It is customary for the scrolls of the Torah to be removed from the ark during this procession. In a few communities a &quot;shofar&quot; is sounded after each circuit.

== Themes ==
=== Final judgment ===
Hoshana Rabbah is known as the last of the Days of Judgment, which begin on Rosh Hashana. The Zohar says that while the judgment for the new year is sealed on Yom Kippur, it is not &quot;delivered&quot; until the end of Sukkot (i.e., Hoshana Rabbah, the last day of Sukkot), during which time one can still alter their verdict and decree for the new year. This idea has no source in the Mishna, Midrash, or Talmud, but a similar idea appears in the Tosefta: that all judgment is made on Rosh Hashana, but judgment of the people is sealed on Yom Kippur, while judgment for rain, grain, and fruits are sealed on the agricultural festivals of Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot respectively.

R&#x27; Mordecai Yoffe argued that Hoshana Rabbah should be a day of judgment based on calendrical considerations: The Jewish year is 12 lunar months or approximately 354 days long (in a non-leap year). Adding the 10 days between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, there are a total of approximately 364 days between one year&#x27;s Rosh Hashana and the next year&#x27;s Yom Kippur, almost exactly equaling a solar year of 365 (or 366) days. Thus, on Yom Kippur one is judged for the deeds of the previous solar year. The next solar year lasts approximately from Yom Kippur to the next year&#x27;s Hoshana Rabbah, thus Hoshanah Rabbah is also a day of judgment. The third year will typically be a leap year, in which case the solar year lasts approximately from Hoshana Rabbah to Rosh Hashana, after which the cycle repeats itself.

Consequently, an Aramaic blessing that Jews give each other on Hoshana Rabbah, פתקא טבא (&quot;pitka tava&quot; or &quot;piska tava&quot;), which in Yiddish is &quot;A guten kvitel&quot;, or &quot;A good note&quot;, is a wish that the verdict will be positive. In many congregations, the cantor wears a kittel on Hoshana Rabbah as on the High Holidays. Since the Hoshana Rabbah liturgy blends elements of the High Holy Days, Chol HaMoed, and Yom Tov, in the Ashkenazic tradition, the cantor recites the service using High Holiday, Festival, Weekday, and Sabbath melodies as appropriate.

In some Sephardic communities, prayers known as Selichot (forgiveness) are recited before the regular morning service (these are the same prayers recited before Rosh Hashanah). In the different prayers of this day, Syrian Jews pray in the same maqam (melody) as on the high holidays. In Amsterdam and in a few places in England, America, and elsewhere, the shofar is sounded in connection with the processions, reflecting the idea that Hoshana Rabbah is the end of the High Holy Day season. Because Hoshanah Rabbah is also linked to the high holidays as well as being a joy-filled day, in the Diaspora, some Hasidic communities such as Satmar have the custom of having Priestly Blessing recited during the Mussaf service. Some communities such as Bobov will only do this if it is on Friday. However, this is not the common practice outside of Israel and some Sephardic communities where the Priestly Blessing is recited daily.

== Rituals and customs ==
The reasons for many of the customs of the day are rooted in Kabbalah.

=== Seven hoshanot ===
The modern-day observance of the rituals of Hoshana Rabbah is intended to emulate the practices that existed in the times of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. During Sukkot, the four species are taken in a circuit (&quot;hakafah&quot;) around the &quot;bimah&quot; of the synagogue once daily. On Hoshana Rabbah, there are seven circuits (hakafot).

Making a circuit around the bimah on Sukkot while each person holds the four species in his hands has its origin in the Temple service, as recorded in the Mishnah: &quot;It was customary to make one procession around the altar on each day of Sukkot, and seven on the seventh day&quot; (Sukkah 4:5). The priests carried the palm branches or willows in their hands. The entire ceremony is to demonstrate rejoicing and gratitude for a blessed and fruitful year. Moreover, it serves to tear down the iron wall that separates us from our Father in Heaven, as the wall of Jericho was encompassed &quot;and the wall fell down flat&quot; (Joshua 6:20). Furthermore, the seven circuits correspond to the seven Hebrew words in - &quot;I wash my hands in purity and circle around Your altar, O Lord&quot;.

According to Kabbalistic tradition, each circuit is done in honor of a patriarch, prophet, or king. The list of honorees is identical to that of the honorary invitees to the &quot;sukkah&quot; according to the tradition of &quot;Ushpizin&quot;: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph, David.

=== Tikkun Hoshana Rabbah ===
Abudarham speaks of the custom of reading the Torah on the night of Hoshana Rabbah, out of which has grown the custom of reading Deuteronomy, Psalms, and passages from the Zohar; reciting Kabbalistic prayers. In Orthodox Jewish circles, some men will stay up all night learning Torah.

Sephardim have a tradition of staying up the entire night on the eve of this day. Throughout the night in the synagogues, Torah learning takes place, and some recite Selichot prayers. The entire books of Deuteronomy is read. The reason for this is because this book is considered by some as a &quot;review&quot; of the entire Torah, but also because in the Torah portion cycle, the book of Deuteronomy is about to be completed the following days on Simchat Torah. In addition, many read the entire book of Psalms.

It is customary to read the whole of Tehillim (Psalms) on Hoshana Rabbah eve. There is also a custom to read the book of Deuteronomy on the night of Hoshana Rabbah.

In Hasidic communities that follow the customs of Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Rimanov, there is a public reading of the Book of Devarim (Deuteronomy) from a Sefer Torah. This may be followed by a &quot;tish&quot; in honor of the festival.

The entire book of Psalms is read, with Kabbalistic prayers being recited after each of the five sections.

=== Five willow branches ===
At the conclusion of a number of &quot;Piyyutim&quot; (liturgical poems), five willow branches are beaten on the ground or other surfaces to symbolize the elimination of sin. This is also symbolic as a prayer for rain and success in agriculture. According to the Kabbalah, beating the ground with the five willow branches is done to &quot;Sweeten the Five Severities&quot;. There is no blessing said for this ritual, but the Aramaic expression &quot;&quot;chabit, chabit velah barich&quot; (&quot;beat, beat but don&#x27;t bless&quot;) is chanted because, according to tradition, this custom of beating the willow branches was started only in the times of Ezra by the three last prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.

The Midrash notes that the Aravah (willow) represents the common folk, unlearned and lacking exceptional deeds. Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook noted that these simple people have their own contribution to the nation; they are blessed with common sense and are unencumbered by sophisticated calculations. The unusual custom to beat the willow on the ground symbolizes that these common folk provide “a natural, healthy power that is part of the arsenal of the Jewish people. We do not strike the willow. We strike with the willow.” It is important to note that the Aravah represents the unlearned and not the evildoers.

=== Prayers for Messiah ===
In the Ashkenazic and Italian rites, the hoshanot are accompanied by a series of liturgical verses written by Rabbi Eleazar birabbi Qallir climaxing with, &quot;Kol mevasser, mevasser ve-omer&quot;&quot; (The voice of the Herald [Elijah] heralds and says)—expressing hope for the speedy coming of the Messiah.

===Traditional foods===

In Ashkenazi culture, it is traditional to eat soup with kreplach during the meal served on the day of Hoshana Rabba.

Also in Yiddish-speaking communities, some eat boiled cabbage on Hoshanah Rabbah. This is because the Hebrew phrase &quot;Kol Mevasser (קול מבשר)&quot; chanted on the day, sounds, when pronounced in traditional Eastern Ashkenazi pronunciation, like &quot;koyl mit vasser (קויל מיט וואסער)&quot;, Yiddish for &quot;cabbage with water&quot;(cabbage in German being kohl). Rabbi Pinchas of Koretz taught that one should bake an apple with the Hoshana branch in it to ward off toothaches in the coming year.

<text>The Chevrolet Uplander is a minivan manufactured and marketed by the Chevrolet division of General Motors for model years of 2005–2009, replacing the Venture and the Astro. Marketed over a single generation, the Uplander was offered in short and long wheelbase variations — each with foldable and removable second and third row seating; a V-6 engine and 4-speed automatic transmission.

Heavily based on GM&#x27;s predecessor minivans, the Uplander was initially marketed with those vehicles, the Venture and Astro. The minivan and its rebadged variants, the Saturn Relay, Buick Terraza, and Pontiac Montana SV6, were manufactured at GM&#x27;s Doraville Assembly and were discontinued in 2008 when GM left the minivan market, ended production and closed the Doraville Assembly plant.

The Uplander was marketed in the United States, Canada, Chile, Mexico, and the Middle East.

==Year to year changes==
2005: The Uplander was initially offered with a 3.5 L High Value 3500 LX9 V6 generating 200 hp (149 kW) and 220 lb·ft (298 N·m).
2006: A 3.9 L LZ9 V6, with 240 hp (179 kW) and 240 lb·ft (332 Nm) torque, was added as an option. Wheels were changed from a five-lugnut design to a six-lugnut design. The GM logo was added to the front doors. A short-wheelbase model became available, but only for the fleet market.
2007: The 3.5 L V6 was dropped, leaving the 3.9 L as the base engine. Consequently, the optional AWD system was also dropped, since it could not handle the torque of the 3.9 L engine. A flex-fuel version of the 3.9 L V6 also became available for 2007.
2008: The Uplander&#x27;s last year for the United States, although production continued for export to Canada and Mexico up to the 2009 model year. The final vehicle (a 2009 Canadian-specification short wheelbase Pontiac Montana SV6 in Liquid Silver Metallic with a roof rack) rolled off the Doraville assembly line on September 26, 2008.

==Safety==
According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the Chevrolet Uplander has an improved crash test rating than its predecessor, the Venture. The Uplander, Pontiac Montana SV6, Buick Terraza, and Saturn Relay earned the highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; in the IIHS offset frontal crash test but was rated only &quot;Acceptable&quot; and &quot;Poor&quot; in the IIHS side crash test with and without the optional side airbags, respectively.

<text>The Boundary Waters–Canadian Derecho (also called the Boundary Waters Blowdown) was an international derecho that occurred during the afternoon and evening hours of July 4 and the early morning hours of July 5, 1999. It traveled and lasted 22 hours.

==Storm path==

===North Dakota===
In the pre-dawn hours of July 4, a band of thunderstorms developed over far eastern North Dakota. Hector International Airport in northwest Fargo recorded winds in excess of 58 mph (95 km/h) for 40 minutes and a maximum wind gust of . Many planes were damaged or overturned. The hangars suffered damage as well.

The worst damage occurred farther south in West Fargo, North Dakota and in south central Fargo, North Dakota. Wind gusts in these areas were estimated at as high as .

The storm caused $85 million in damage (1999 dollars) in the Fargo metropolitan area. Over 40,000 people were without power. Cars were overturned, roofs were severely damaged, and power poles were blown down.

===Minnesota===
The derecho moved into Minnesota and caused massive damage in Cass, Itasca, and Aitkin Counties, at around $3 million. A semi-trailer truck was blown over on U.S. Route 53 near Canyon.

One person was killed and 60 were injured as the derecho passed through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) and Superior National Forest. People were there to enjoy canoeing and other recreation for the Independence Day weekend. Straight line winds in excess of 90 mph (145 km/h) uprooted and snapped off trees in over 370,000 acres (1,500 km²) of the 1 million acre (4,000 km²) wilderness area. In total, more than 477,000 acres (1,930 km²) of forest was affected in the Superior National Forest in a swath 30 miles (48.3 km) long and 4 to 12 miles (6.4 to 19.3 km) wide. It is estimated that 25 million trees were blown down in the BWCAW.

===Ontario===
The derecho brought more damage when it crossed the border into Ontario during the early afternoon hours of July 4. At its peak near Thunder Bay, the winds were estimated to have been much stronger, around 100 mph (160 km/h) and it spawned some small tornadoes. One small sailboat was overturned and two people were thrown into the cold waters of Lake Superior. They were rescued by a nearby boater.

The storm carved a path of destruction into the sparsely populated forested areas of northern Ontario. The Canadian Pacific track between White River and Chapleau in northeastern Ontario was put out of service by fallen trees. Significant tree and property damage was recorded in Timmins.

===Quebec===

As it raced eastward at 62 mph (100 km/h), the system entered into western Quebec in the Témiscamingue region around 11:00 p.m. A gust of 65 mph (102 km/h) was reported at the automatic station of Angliers. There was also a tremendous amount of lightning associated with this derecho, with around 6,000 lightning strikes per hour. Another person in this derecho was killed at Val-des-Lacs (V on the map) when a tree fell on the victim. A woman was injured when a tree crushed her car.

After narrowly missing the Ottawa area, the storm moved quickly into Montreal (M on the map) around 3:00 a.m. heading southeastward toward Maine. Much damage was recorded in the Metropolitan area but the worst affected area of Quebec was farther along its path near Sherbrooke (S on the map) in the Eastern Townships where a church was badly damaged, farm buildings were damaged and 2,000 trees were felled. Hydro-Québec reported that over 600,000 people lost power; some were without power for over a week.

===New England===
The storm continued southeast and caused more damage in New Hampshire and Vermont, killing one more person, before finally dissipating in Maine after 5:00 a.m. on July 5.

==Aftermath==
The Boundary Waters – Canadian Derecho is one of the farthest north &quot;progressive&quot; derechos to have ever been recorded. The derecho caused well over $100 million in damage, killed 4 persons and injured 70. Over 700,000 homes and businesses lost power from the event.

<doc id="1044611" wikidata="Q1002939" url="?curid=1044611" title="Buick Terraza">
<text>The Buick Terraza is a four-door minivan marketed by Buick from the 2005 to 2007 model years as a &quot;luxury crossover sport van.&quot; As Buick&#x27;s first minivan for the North American market, it was a badge-engineered variant of the Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Saturn minivans sharing the U platform (Uplander, Montana SV6, and Relay respectively), all manufactured in Doraville, Georgia.
==Design==
The Terraza retailed at US$28,110 in 2005 (), and debuted with one engine, a 3.5 L High Value V6 generating 200 hp (149 kW) and 220 lb·ft (298 N·m) of torque. For 2006, a 3.9 L LZ9 V6, with 240 hp (179 kW) and 240 lb·ft (332 Nm) torque became available; the 3.5 L engine was discontinued a year later. The Terraza offered leather seats and faux wood trim on the steering wheel, instrument panel, and gear shift knob.

Borrowing a design feature from the Rendezvous, all 2005–2006 Terraza models featured an independent short-and-long-arm rear suspension with aluminum crossmember and control arms, regardless of drivetrain. The independent rear suspension was replaced with a beam axle for 2007.

The 2007 Terraza equipped with side airbags scored a &quot;good&quot; in the frontal offset and an &quot;acceptable&quot; in the side impact Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests.

==Year-by-year changes==
*2005: Buick introduces the Terraza, its first minivan for the North American market. The Terraza was available in two trim lines: entry-level &quot;CX&quot; and top-of-the-line &quot;CXL&quot;; both trims were available in front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.
*2006: The 3.5 L V6 could now be upgraded to a 3.9 L (in FWD only) LZ9 V6 engine. Second-row seat-mounted side airbags were now an option, and wheels now had six lug nuts instead of five.
*2007: The Terraza&#x27;s last year, and all-wheel-drive models were dropped. The 3.9 L V6 was the only engine offered; however, it was available with a flex-fuel option. More standard features were offered on the new &quot;CX Plus&quot; model, which slotted between the &quot;CX&quot; and &quot;CXL&quot;. The independent rear suspension was replaced with a beam axle. The last Terraza was assembled in June 2007, and the Terraza was removed from Buick&#x27;s website in early fall 2007.

<doc id="1044614" wikidata="Q7417003" url="?curid=1044614" title="Sandusky (locomotive)">
<text>Sandusky was the name of a steam railroad locomotive, a 4-2-0, built in the United States. This locomotive included engineering features that hadn&#x27;t been used before in locomotive construction and it played an integral role in the railroad history of Ohio.

==History==
&quot;Sandusky&quot; was the first locomotive built by Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor; it was completed in 1837. Thomas Rogers, the manufacturing company&#x27;s founder, designed the locomotive. While some references cite &quot;Sandusky&quot; as the first locomotive built in the United States, the &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; is more widely accepted as the first; the &quot;Best Friend of Charleston&quot; was built in 1831.

The &quot;Sandusky&quot;, however, was the first locomotive to feature counterweights in its driving wheels to offset the force of the piston stroke and the combined weight of the axle, wheels and piston rod against the railroad track. Rogers filed a patent for the engine&#x27;s counterbalance on July 12, 1837. &quot;Sandusky&quot; also featured the first use of hollow oval-shaped spokes in its driving wheels.

While &quot;Sandusky&quot; was built for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company, that railroad never actually purchased the engine. It was eventually sold to the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad (MR&amp;LE), the first railroad built in Ohio. Through this purchase, &quot;Sandusky&quot; earned a couple more firsts — it became the first locomotive to cross the Allegheny Mountains (although this crossing was made by river ferry and not by rail) and it was the first locomotive to operate in Ohio. Its transportation to Ohio was supervised by Thomas Hogg. The &quot;Sandusky&quot; pulled the first train on the MR&amp;LE from Sandusky to Bellevue.

==Timeline==
* October 3 or October 6, 1837: The &quot;Sandusky&quot; makes its first trial run between Paterson, Jersey City, and New Brunswick New Jersey. Some references cite October 3 while others cite October 6 as the locomotive&#x27;s first trial operations.
* October 14, 1837: The Mad River &amp; Lake Erie railroad purchases &quot;Sandusky&quot;.
* December 2, 1837: &quot;Sandusky&quot; makes its first run on the MR&amp;LE in Ohio.

<doc id="1044619" wikidata="Q957653" url="?curid=1044619" title="Itu, São Paulo">
<text>Itu is a historic municipality in the state of São Paulo in Brazil. It is part of the Metropolitan Region of Sorocaba. The population was 175,568 as of 2020, in an area of 640.72 km2. The elevation is 583 m. This place name comes from the Tupi language, meaning &quot;big waterfall&quot;. Two rivers flow through Itu: Tietê and Jundiaí. Itu has five hospitals, eleven bank agencies and one shopping center, the Plaza Shopping Itu.

Itu was founded in 1610 by &quot;bandeirante&quot; Domingos Fernandes. It became a parish in 1653. In 1657, it was elevated to a town and municipality. It became a part of Brazil in 1822. It became a city in 1843.

It is the 46th most populous municipality in the state of São Paulo and the 174th in Brazil, in addition to being the second largest city in the Sorocaba Metropolitan Region, behind only Sorocaba.

==Transportation==

The main roads passing through the municipality are:
*SP-75

==Tourism==

Itu was the birthplace of nationally-known comedian Simplicio, whose catchphrase was &quot;back home in Itu everything is bigger&quot;. This led to the city becoming known as the &quot;capital of large things&quot;, with a number of oversized objects being constructed there. The town&#x27;s &quot;exaggerations&quot; include a 4m tall yellow pay phone called &quot;orelhão&quot;, an oversized street light, a giant car tire (which was set on fire) and a mast decorated with a star, claimed to be the world&#x27;s tallest artificial Christmas tree.

With the increase in domestic tourism the infrastructure soon developed to attract foreign visitors as well as international meetings, seminars and congress events.

The industrial sector has changed a little during the last decades as the cotton and soybeans crops had gone to agricultural frontiers as Mato Grosso and Goias and the sugarcane reconfigured the north of São Paulo.

<doc id="1044629" wikidata="Q947939" url="?curid=1044629" title="Tokyo Jihen">
<text>, also known as Tokyo Incidents, is a Japanese rock band formed by Ringo Sheena, after leaving her solo career. The band&#x27;s debut single &quot;Gunjō Biyori&quot; was released in September 2004, and they ended activities in February 2012. The band sold 2.3 million albums, singles, and DVDs. The band reunited and released a new single on January 1, 2020.

==History==

=== Origins (2003) ===
Tokyo Jihen started as Ringo Sheena&#x27;s backing band at first for her last concert tour before ending the first half of her solo career. Sheena was contemplating working with a band while working on her last solo album, &quot;Kalk Samen&quot; &quot;Kuri no Hana&quot;. She began looking for members of her backing band to support her solo tour &quot;Sugoroku Ecstasy&quot; in the Autumn of 2003. The tour band was introduced as Tokyo Jihen during the tour for the first time, featuring guitarist Mikio Hirama, pianist H Zett M, drummer Toshiki Hata, and familiar bassist Seiji Kameda. The musicians she selected became the core of what would become Tokyo Jihen.

After the tour, she announced that she would stop her solo career to join &quot;Tokyo Jihen&quot; as a full-fledged member.

=== &quot;Phase 1&quot; era and its end (2004–2005) ===
On May 31, 2004, the members of the Tokyo Jihen declared that they worked as a permanent band. On July 24, they appeared in the presence of fans at the live &quot;0724 Yamabikari&quot; for the first time. They played some live sets during that year&#x27;s &quot;Fuji Rock Festival&quot;, and made their major debut with the single &quot;Gunjō Biyori&quot; on September 8. Tokyo Jihen released one album and two singles, and held their first concert tour -Tokyo Jihen live tour 2005 &quot;dynamite!&quot;-.

On July 1, 2005, it was announced during the tour that keyboardist H ZETT M and guitarist Mikio Hirama would leave Tokyo Jihen. H ZETT M returned to his duties as pianist for PE&#x27;Z, and Hirama went back to being a solo singer. It was decided that they would withdraw from the band before the &quot;&quot;&quot;dynamite!&quot; tour started.

After the departure of the band&#x27;s former guitarist and keyboardist, Sheena began a search for new members. She was going to have at least a keyboard player join because two people left the band at the same time. H ZETT M recommended his friend and former bandmate, Keitaro Izawa, as a substitute for him to Sheena, but she began visiting music clubs to look for other keyboardists. In the end she found no one who was better than Izawa, and Sheena decided to invite him to join. He assumed the stage name of Ichiyo Izawa during his time with the band.

The search for a new guitarist proved more difficult. Sheena approached several guitarists as potential members, but was turned down by all of them, possibly because they disliked the idea of being considered her &quot;backing band&quot;. At worst, she planned to choose a different guitarist each time without having a regular guitarist. However, when the other members listened to the first Tokyo Jihen album &quot;Kyōiku&quot; demos, the situation changed. All of them were pleased with the demo session guitarist and asked Sheena his name. This guitarist was Ryosuke Nagaoka, who assumed the stage name of Ukigumo after joining Tokyo Jihen. Sheena and Ukigumo had been friends since her days as a soloist. He turned down the offer to join Tokyo Jihen at first, but finally accepted just before recording began for &quot;Adult&quot;.

With so many members replaced, Sheena considered changing the name of the band, but decided against it in the end.

In September 2005, keyboardist Ichiyō Izawa and guitarist Ukigumo formally joined Tokyo Jihen. The lineup including the former members subsequently came to be called , with the current one referred to as .

=== Beginning of &quot;Phase 2&quot; (2006–2007) ===
The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Adult&quot;, released on January 25, 2006, went to number one on the Oricon charts, a first for the band. They held two concerts, entitled &quot;DOMESTIC! Virgin LINE&quot;, at Nippon Budokan Hall and Osaka-jo Hall in February as the new members debut. A nationwide tour, &quot;DOMESTIC!&quot; &quot;Just can&#x27;t help it&quot; followed later the same year.

In the latter half of 2006, Sheena produced the film score of the movie &quot;Sakuran&quot;, on which three of the other four band members (excluding Hata, who had broken his leg) collaborated.

Following the 2007 release of two singles, &quot;O.S.C.A.&quot; and &quot;Killer-tune&quot;, and an album, &quot;Variety&quot;, the first release not containing any compositions by Sheena, they embarked on the concert tour &quot;Tokyo Jihen live tour 2007 Spa &amp; Treatment&quot; to promote the album.

=== Members&#x27; activities outside Tokyo Jihen (2008–2009) ===
The music video for &quot;Killer-tune&quot; won the Best Technical Works Video category in the March 15, 2008 Space Shower Music Video Awards &quot;08&quot; by Space Shower TV.

As 2008 marked the 10th anniversary of Sheena&#x27;s professional debut, she resumed solo activities as &quot;Ringo Sheena&quot; for the first time since the formation of Tokyo Jihen. She participated in the summer Rising Sun Rock Festival both as a soloist and as a member of Tokyo Jihen. The activity of Tokyo Jihen was thus restricted during this period.

In 2009, Sheena continued her solo activity from the previous year with the release of a new solo album, her first since 2003&#x27;s &quot;Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana&quot;, in June. During the same period, Ukigumo and Izawa resumed activities with their respective bands. Kameda returned to his work as a producer, overseeing several top ten releases, and Hata participated in the recording and subsequent tour for Fujifabric&#x27;s new album. Sheena, Ukigumo, and Izawa were all involved in the production of Rie Tomosaka&#x27;s album &quot;Toridori&quot; the same year. Ukigumo and Izawa joined Tomosaka&#x27;s promotional tour as part of her backing band.

On May 25, 2009, it was announced that Izawa had joined &quot;The Hiatus&quot;, a new band formed by former Ellegarden member Takeshi Hosomi. They defined The Hiatus as &quot;a project of music, arts, and depicters&quot; on the band&#x27;s official site. Izawa was listed as a tour member on the site, and took part in their &quot;Trash We&#x27;d Love Tour 2009&quot;. Izawa also held some concerts with Hosomi as from October to December.

On December 2, 2009, Tokyo Jihen released the single &quot;Nōdōteki Sanpunkan&quot;, their first in two years, and resumed their activity as a band full-time. They appeared as part of the lineup of the December 30, 2009 Countdown Japan 09/10.

=== Final years and dissolution (2010–2012) ===
The fourth album &quot;Sports&quot;, released on February 24, 2010, won the 1st place in Oricon chart after an interval of four years. The nationwide tour &quot;Tokyo Incident live tour 2010 UltraC&quot; started in March.

The fifth album &quot;Dai Hakken&quot; was released on June 29, 2011, and the nationwide tour &quot;Tokyo Incident live tour 2011 Discovery&quot; started in September 30.

On January 11, 2012, Ringo Sheena announced their break up on their official site. Their last original release, a mini-album entitled &quot;Color Bars&quot;, was released on January 18, 2012. A live best of album, &quot;Tokyo Collection&quot;, and a concert DVD and Blu-ray release of their &quot;Discovery Tour&quot; went on sale on February 15. Tokyo Jihen&#x27;s embarked on a final tour, entitled &quot;Domestique Bon Voyage&quot;&quot;&quot;, which included Yokohama Arena (February 14–15), Osaka-jo Hall (February 21–22), and Tokyo&#x27;s Nippon Budokan (February 28–29).

The band officially dissolved on February 29, 2012, after their sold-out final Budokan concert. On June 15, an announcement on Sheena&#x27;s official site, Kronekodow, revealed that Tokyo Jihen would release one final album, &quot;Shin&#x27;ya Waku&quot; &quot;(The Edge of Late Night)&quot;, and DVD/Blu-ray video, &quot;Chin Play Kou Play&quot; (&quot;Strange Plays and Great Plays&quot;) in August of that year. The album, a collection of B-sides, included the previously unreleased-on-CD &quot;Handsome Sugite&quot; and one new song, &quot;Tadanaranu Kankei&quot;. The video contained highlights from the band&#x27;s best live performances along with festival appearances and rare material.

=== After dissolution ===
On December 31, 2016, when Sheena Ringo participated in the 67th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen, Tokyo Jihen played as her backing band. However, the band&#x27;s name was not written in the credits. Ukigumo and H Zett M have been regular collaborators with Sheena, playing on recorded work and in backing bands on her live tours.

=== Reunion ===
On January 1, 2020, Tokyo Jihen released a surprise digital single, &quot;Erabarezaru Kokumin&quot;&quot;&quot;, and announced a tour of Japan titled &quot;Live Tour 2020 News Flash&quot;, beginning February 29. In February, the band announced their 5-song EP &quot;News&quot; would be released on April 8, 2020. Their sixth studio album &quot;Ongaku&quot; (, &quot;Music&quot;) was released on June 9, 2021.

===Timeline===
=== Producers ===

* Main occupation: Audio engineer
:Inoue has produced all of Sheena Ringo&#x27;s works since her second album. Sheena calls him &quot;the sixth member&quot;.

===Naming of members===
The real names of Hirama and Hata are &quot;平間 幹央&quot; and &quot;畑 利樹&quot; respectively, but, Ringo Sheena gave them stage names, using Kanji which is not usually used for their names, but as they are the phonetic equivalent, the pronunciation is not changed.
Since Ryosuke Nagaoka always drifted unsteadily and nobody knew where he would go, Sheena named Nagaoka &quot;Ukigumo&quot; which means the drifting cloud.
Sheena planned to give Keitaro Izawa a stage name, but he refused and chose one for himself, Ichiyō Izawa.

== Songwriting ==
The band members have different writing styles. Sheena Ringo and Ichiyo Izawa write their songs using musical notation. Seiji Kameda uses different methods, recording himself humming, using musical instruments, or using a computer. Ukigumo, on the other hand, cannot write musical notation, Izawa or (less frequently) Sheena transcribe his tunes in the studio. Since Ukigumo writes music without considering a song, it is hard for Sheena to put the words to his music, so he often writes the lyrics to his own songs. Finally, Toshiki Hata stubbornly refused to write music, even declining to write lyrics when Sheena asked him to. He finally did contribute one song to the band&#x27;s last EP before their split, &quot;Color Bars&quot;, and the first EP since their reunion, &quot;News&quot;.

<doc id="1044633" wikidata="Q969059" url="?curid=1044633" title="Layer Cake (film)">
<text>Layer Cake is a 2004 British crime drama thriller film directed by Matthew Vaughn, in his directorial debut. The screenplay was adapted by J. J. Connolly from his 2000 novel of the same name. The film was produced by Adam Bohling, David Reid and Vaughn, with Stephen Marks as executive producer. The title refers to the social strata, especially in the British criminal underworld. The film&#x27;s plot revolves around a London-based criminal, played by Daniel Craig, who works in the cocaine trade and wishes to leave the drug business. The film also features Tom Hardy, Michael Gambon, Colm Meaney, and Sienna Miller. Craig&#x27;s character is unnamed in the film and is listed in the credits as &quot;XXXX&quot;.

&quot;Layer Cake&quot; grossed $11.9 million at the box office and received generally positive reviews from critics. Craig&#x27;s performance in the film has often been cited as a major factor in his casting as James Bond in 2005.

==Plot==
The protagonist XXXX (otherwise unnamed) is a London cocaine distributor who abhors violence and operates with the care and professionalism of a legitimate businessman. His chief associates are his enforcer and partner Morty, and Gene, an Irish gangster who serves as his liaison to mob boss Jimmy Price. Just as XXXX is ready to retire from criminal life, he is summoned to a lunch meeting with Jimmy, who gives him two tasks.

The first is to track down Charlie, the drug-addicted runaway daughter of one of Price&#x27;s associates. XXXX enlists the con men Cody and Tiptoes to find her; they learn that Charlie has apparently been kidnapped, but are unable to discover who abducted her.

The second task is for XXXX to oversee the purchase of one million ecstasy tablets from the &quot;Duke&quot;, a low-level criminal who recently returned to London from Amsterdam with his girlfriend Slasher and crew of thugs led by his right-hand man Gazza. Unbeknownst to XXXX, the Duke and his crew have stolen the pills from a gang of Serbian war criminals. He meets the Duke&#x27;s feckless nephew, Sidney, and finds himself attracted to his girlfriend Tammy. XXXX tries to broker the sale of the pills to Liverpool gangsters Trevor and Shanks but they refuse, informing him of their origin and that the vengeful Serbians have sent the assassin Dragan to recover the pills and kill the thieves. As the Duke had mentioned his name to the Serbians, XXXX is also a target.

XXXX arranges a tryst with Tammy but is kidnapped and brought to Eddie Temple, a wealthy crime lord. Eddie explains that Charlie is his daughter, whom he has recovered; Jimmy, having recently lost a fortune due to bad investments he blames on Eddie, wanted her as a hostage until Eddie recouped his losses. Eddie gives XXXX a recording, revealing that Jimmy has been working as an informant for Scotland Yard, planning to betray XXXX to the police once the pills were sold in exchange for immunity for his own crimes and XXXX&#x27;s money. Eddie demands that XXXX sell him the pills instead.

XXXX assassinates Jimmy at his home, but later finds that his accountant, an associate of Jimmy&#x27;s, has vanished along with XXXX&#x27;s money. Confronted by Gene and Morty, he shares the evidence of Jimmy&#x27;s betrayal, and the pair acknowledge him as the new acting boss. Gene shows them the corpse of the Duke, who was killed by one of his men when Slasher threatened to go to the police if Jimmy did not help them out of their situation. XXXX hires a hitman to ambush and kill Dragan, but Dragan kills the hitman first and makes XXXX promise to recover the pills.

Sidney brings XXXX to Duke&#x27;s old hideout, and, as he tries to bargain with Gazza for the pills, the police arrive. XXXX and the Duke&#x27;s gang barely escape the raid, while Dragan watches from afar as the pills are confiscated. However, it turns out that XXXX arranged for the raid, with Cody and Tiptoes posing as officers to secure the pills. XXXX delivers the Duke&#x27;s severed head to Dragan as a peace offering; satisfied, Dragan reports to the Serbians that the police have seized the drugs. The Serbians accept the loss, which is revealed to be a small amount in comparison to their overall manufacturing capacity.

When XXXX and his crew arrive at Eddie&#x27;s warehouse to sell the pills as arranged, Eddie&#x27;s henchmen relieve them of the drugs at gunpoint, and Eddie welcomes him to the &quot;layer cake&quot; of criminal hierarchy. Having anticipated this double-cross, XXXX arranges Trevor and Shanks to gun down Eddie&#x27;s men in an armed robbery, take the drugs, and sell them via Dizzy so he can settle his accounts. The gang assembles for lunch at the Stoke Park Country Club, honouring their new boss, but XXXX declines their offer of leadership and follows up on his initial plan to retire. With Tammy on his arm, he leaves the club, but is shot by a jilted yet apologetic Sidney. He collapses, bleeding out on the steps.

==Release==
===Box office===
===Home media===
&quot;Layer Cake&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on 23 August 2005 and on Blu-ray in 2007. It was also re-released in 2014.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Layer Cake&quot; received positive reviews, with an 81% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an average of 7.1/10 based on 142 reviews. The critical consensus states that it is &quot;A stylized, electric British crime thriller&quot;. On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 30 reviews.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; remarked, &quot;The movie was directed by Matthew Vaughn, who produced &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot;, and this one works better than those films because it doesn&#x27;t try so hard to be clever and tries harder to be menacing&quot;. Of Craig&#x27;s performance, he said, &quot;Craig is fascinating here as a criminal who is very smart, and finds that it is not an advantage because while you might be able to figure out what another smart person is about to do, dumbos like the men he works for are likely to do anything&quot;. He gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; remarked on the &quot;efficient, gripping story&quot; and wrote that Craig&#x27;s performance as an improvising, &quot;intelligent amateur&quot; contained the &quot;cool-yet-humble vibe of Steve McQueen&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it a grade A, calling it a &quot;Fast, convulsive, and densely exciting new British gangster thriller&quot;. Leslie Felperin of Variety wrote: &quot;There&#x27;s a proper lived-in believability about Layer Cake&#x27;s depiction of how the worlds of the rich, the criminal and the criminally rich intersect.&quot;

Craig&#x27;s starring role in the film has been cited as the performance that led to his high-profile casting as James Bond.

===Awards and accolades===
==Future==
Jason Statham&#x27;s production company is said to have the rights to produce a sequel, entitled &quot;Viva La Madness&quot; with Statham taking the lead role from Craig. On 17 September 2015, it was reported that &quot;Viva La Madness&quot; will be a TV show for Gaumont International Television.

<text>Dickon Edwards (born Richard Edwards; 3 September 1971), also known as Dickon Angel, is a London-based indie pop musician and diarist. He was a founding member of the bands Orlando and Fosca, and briefly played guitar in the band Spearmint.

He has kept a blog called &quot;The Diary at the Centre of the Earth&quot; since 8 December 1997 (predating the 1999 coining of the term &quot;blog&quot; - he terms it an &quot;online diary&quot;). Excerpts from the blog were included in Travis Elborough and Nick Rennison&#x27;s &quot;A London Year&quot; and in the follow-up title &quot;A Traveller&#x27;s Year&quot;.

In March 2008 he released a printed collection of lyrics titled &quot;The Portable Dickon Edwards&quot;, which was released in a limited edition alongside Fosca&#x27;s &quot;The Painted Side of the Rocket&quot; album.

In 2021, Edwards completed a PhD on &quot;Ronald Firbank and the Legacy of Camp Modernism&quot; at Birkbeck College, University of London.

==Personal life==
Known for his dandy aesthetic, Dickon has peroxide blonde hair and is often seen in a white, blue, or silver-grey three-piece suit, the silver-grey suit being a bequest from fellow London dandy Sebastian Horsley.
Edwards is a son of the quiltmaker and author Lynne Edwards MBE, and the cartoonist Brian &quot;Bib&quot; Edwards. His brother was the Adam Ant guitarist, Tom Edwards.

<text>Orlando (styled O&quot;rland&quot;o) were an English Romo band of the 1990s. They were one of seven core Romo acts featured by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in their guide to the Romo scene and were subsequently cited as being &quot;figureheads&quot; of the scene. As well as substantial coverage in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the band also received press coverage from the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Select&quot; &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Penthouse UK&quot;.

The band consisted of Dickon Edwards, Tim Chipping, Neil Turner, Mike Austen and David Gray. Musically, Orlando combined the synthesised dance-pop of 1990s boybands and American swingbeat acts with verbose lyrics in the general style of Morrissey and Richey Edwards.

==Career==
Orlando first played live on the London indie circuit as a generic alternative rock band in 1993–1994. They later withdrew from the scene to reinvent themselves as an &quot;alienated&quot; white soul duo consisting of Chipping and Edwards plus sidemen Turner and Austen. In early 1995, they issued the EP &quot;Reproduction Is Pollution&quot; under the name Shelley on Sarah Records. The band approached founding Romo clubnight Club Skinny in Camden to relaunch themselves as a live act. David Gray, synth programmer for fellow Romo band Hollywood (and formerly their drummer in their previous incarnation as punk trio Xerox Girls) later become Orlando&#x27;s live drummer while Club Skinny co-promoter Paul &quot;Hi Fi&quot; Nugent became the band&#x27;s manager.

In March 1996, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Nature&#x27;s Hated&quot; was included in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s covermount cassette &quot;Fiddling While Romo Burns&quot; and a single track CD was put on sale at dates of the similarly named Romo package tour in which Orlando participated. In the summer of that year Orlando released their first single, &quot;Just for a Second.&quot; In Autumn of that year they released the &quot;Magic EP&quot; which achieved No. 96 on the UK Singles Chart. A new version of &quot;Nature&#x27;s Hated&quot;, the group&#x27;s third single, was released in 1997, and they also contributed a cover of Tim Hardin&#x27;s &quot;How Can We Hang on to a Dream&quot; to the soundtrack of the film &quot;Fever Pitch&quot;.

In September 1997, the band released their album, &quot;Passive Soul&quot;, through the label Blanco y Negro. It made both the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Gay Times&quot; albums of the year list The album is now hard to find and commands upwards of £30 on the collectors market.

Shortly after the release of the album, Edwards left the band to form Fosca, who released three albums between 2000 and 2008. Chipping took over as lyricist and the new Orlando recorded a second album &quot;Sick Folk&quot; with a new folk music sound. Orlando disbanded in spring 2000 with the album still unreleased. In 2002, Chipping uploaded six songs from &quot;Sick Folk&quot; to his own website.

Chipping later embarked on an acting career; his credits included playing a gay &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, in cosplay as Mr Spock, in the BBC comedy series &quot;Little Britain&quot;. In 2012, in his capacity as Music Editor of the website Holy Moly, Chipping was appointed as a Pundit by the BBC for their &quot;Sound of 2012&quot;.

==Discography==

The discography of Orlando consists of one studio album, five singles/EPs, three music videos and one original appearance on another release.

An out-takes compilation and part of an unreleased second studio album have been made available posthumously as downloads.

<doc id="1044644" wikidata="Q5544356" url="?curid=1044644" title="George School">
<text>George School is a private Quaker (Society of Friends) boarding and day high school located on a rural campus in Middletown Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania (Newtown postal address). It has been at that site since its founding in 1893, and has grown from a single building (The building known as “Main”) to over 20 academic, athletic, and residential buildings. Besides the usual college preparatory courses, including an International Baccalaureate program, the school features several distinct programs deriving from its Quaker heritage. These include community service requirements, an emphasis on social justice and environmental concerns, required art courses, and community-based decisionmaking.

==History==

George School was founded in 1891 and opened in 1893. John M. George, who donated much of the money for the school, is the school&#x27;s namesake. It was intended as a school for Hicksite members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). They wanted an alternative to Orthodox Westtown School. The two schools have remained friendly rivals in athletics, although they resolved the sectarian rift between them in the 1950s. The Patterson Cup (commonly known as &quot;the moose&quot; for the moose head at Westtown, where the tally was kept by hanging tea bags on alternating antlers) is awarded each year to the school which has won the most varsity and junior varsity contests between the schools. An alumni fundraising competition between the schools, the &quot;Machemer Cup&quot; also exists.

The campus was built on of the Worth Farm. The owners retained , including the 1756 Tate House and 1804 Worth House. The school gave over the bulk of its property in the early years to a farm managed for its benefit. The farm produced the school&#x27;s milk and meat until the farm closed in 1967. The school purchased the remaining property, including the two historic houses, in 1945. The school leased or gifted parts of the campus to Newtown Friends School in 1947 and the Pennswood retirement community in 1979.

The first headmaster, George Maris, had been a strong voice in favor of &quot;guarded education,&quot; separated from worldly vices, for Hicksite Friends. Maris was one of the group of Hicksites who courted George and secured a codicil to his will 74 days before his death. Maris was an ineffective headmaster, although the reasons for his lack of success are unclear; Maris was forced out of his position in 1901 and replaced by Joseph Walton, who had also been part of the founding group.

The new headmaster, Joseph Walton, had been a leading candidate for the presidency of Swarthmore College, the Hicksite-sponsored Friends college, in 1898. During Walton&#x27;s tenure as head of George School (1901–1912), the school overcame what had been a troubled balance sheet by expanding. The school built a new dormitory, Drayton Hall, in 1903 (the school had built Orton in a fit of optimism in 1897), and the first separate classroom building, Retford Hall, in 1903. Unlike Maris, Walton opposed the idea of &quot;guarded&quot; education and encouraged arts education. Walton died of a duodenal ulcer, aged 57.

George Walton, the son of Joseph Walton, served as headmaster from 1912 to 1948, the longest term of any head of school. There was little new construction during his term (the one major building was Bancroft Hall, built in 1931), but considerable social change. The enrollment nearly doubled, from 226 to 425, while the number of Quakers attending remained about the same, lowering the proportion. The school accepted its first black student in the 1940s and introduced social dancing and football. Outside of the school, he was a prominent voice within the Friends community. He was part of the group that founded the Pendle Hill study center in 1930; he accompanied two of that group, the well-known writer Rufus Jones and D. Robert Yarnall on a 1938 mission to Germany on behalf of the American Friends Service Committee to allow that group to distribute relief in Poland, then under occupation. After retiring from George School, he was an instrumental figure in reconciling the Hicksite and Orthodox Philadelphia Yearly Meetings in 1955.

Following World War II, teacher Walter Mohr, who had also worked with the American Friends Service Committee, organized affiliations with two German schools, Jacobi Gymnasium for boys in Düsseldorf and Gertraudenschule for girls in Berlin, at first sending relief supplies and organizing student exchanges. In 1950, the first of almost twenty years of German workcamps began. In the late 1960s, these affiliations and work camps began to spread to Russia, Africa, and Latin America and included work projects domestically.

The next headmaster, Richard McFeely, ushered in an era of campus growth and a change to a less formal relationship between students and faculty: McFeely insisted on being addressed by first name. McFeely was generally known as &quot;Mr. Dick.&quot; McFeely had contracted polio while a student at Swarthmore. McFeely was friendly with Franklin D. Roosevelt, having spent time with him at Warm Springs, Georgia. During McFeely&#x27;s time as the head of school (1948–1966), the school constructed the Alumni Gym, Hallowell Hall, McFeely Library (so named after his death), and Walton Center. McFeely retired because of poor health from polio and died within the year.

During the mid-1950s, Julian Bond, later a prominent civil rights leader, attended George School. While Bond encountered some cases of racism while attending there, he was impressed by the anti-racist philosophy of the school and first encountered ideas of non-violence and social action. One event, in particular, involved Bond, a varsity athlete, going to Philadelphia with his white girlfriend while wearing George School apparel. Upon returning, the school dean reprimanded him. George School has claimed it was enforcing a policy of not wearing George School insignia apparel off-campus; Bond alleged that the reprimand was racially-motivated and &quot;That was just like somebody stopping you and slapping you across the face.&quot;

Eric Curtis, an Englishman and a former faculty member at Earlham College, was brought in to be the headmaster after McFeely, serving from 1967 (there was an interim head for 1966–67) until 1979. Curtis oversaw a tumultuous time of change in the social relationships within the school, as assertive students and younger faculty battled older faculty and administrators (and George School Committee) over various procedures. The two significant new buildings in Curtis&#x27; time were the Science Center and the Sports Center.

David Bourns was head of school from 1979 to 2001 when he left to head the Paul Cuffee charter school in Providence, Rhode Island. Bourns&#x27; time began as a recentering after the tumult of the previous decade. A new emphasis on academic rigor was enforced, along with more focused activism: the school built an Alternative Energy Center in the mid-1980s and for several years hosted a regional &quot;Peace Fair.&quot; Nancy Starmer, the first non-member of the Society of Friends to head the school, succeeded him.

On September 18, 2007, Barbara Dodd Anderson, George School Class of 1950, gave a gift of $128.5 million to George School. The gift is to be received over twenty years from an irrevocable charitable lead trust and is the single largest gift to an existing private school in U.S. history. The gift has its origins with billionaire businessman and philanthropist, Warren Buffett. Buffett was a student of Anderson&#x27;s father, David Dodd, an economist and professor at Columbia University School of Business. Dodd became an early investor in Buffett&#x27;s Berkshire Hathaway. Ms. Dodd Anderson, Mr. Buffet, and Mollie Dodd Anderson, granddaughter of Barbara Dodd Anderson, were present for the dedication of the new LEED Gold Certified Learning Commons and Mollie Dodd Anderson Library on October 17, 2009.

On April 27, 2015, George School became the first preparatory school in the nation to divest its endowment from coal.

== Governance ==
The George School Committee governs George School, self-perpetuating by approval of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends. Quaker influences on the school are apparent in many of the Friends-derived procedures of the school, especially in the consensus format for faculty and other committee meetings, in which all present must either agree to proposals or &quot;stand aside&quot; for them to be approved. A four-year course of spiritual study begins with a term of Essentials of a Friends Community in the student&#x27;s first year, followed by two terms of Faith Traditions, an in-depth World Religions course. Additionally, all students and faculty gather for a thirty-minute Meeting for Worship once a week, and all boarding students and resident faculty attend a longer meeting on Sundays. Also, in the Quaker spirit, since 1942, every student has had a &quot;co-op&quot; job, the equivalent to other schools&#x27; work-study jobs, but shared equally among all students regardless of their financial aid status. Finally, in the most apparent difference between outsiders, teachers and students usually refer to one another on a first-name basis.

== Curriculum ==
George School offers a college-preparatory course of study. To graduate, students must complete four years of English, three years of mathematics, three years of history, three years of science, three years of arts, and religious courses, and demonstrate third-year proficiency in a foreign language.

George School offers the two-year International Baccalaureate program, which certifies students to attend colleges and universities worldwide.

George School also offers Advanced Placement courses and examinations in Biology, Calculus (AB), English, U.S. History, Human Geography, Chemistry, Physics, Statistics and the school&#x27;s four foreign languages: French, Spanish, Latin and Chinese. Additionally, students in the Portfolio Preparation class have been known to submit their work for the Art AP.

Students must take three full years of art. George school offers classes in
ceramics, chorus, dance, digital imaging, drama, music seminar, newspaper (&quot;The Curious George&quot;, formerly &quot;The George School News&quot;), painting and drawing, photography, stagecraft, film production, orchestra, woodworking, and yearbook.

===Service===
All George School students must complete a 65-hour community service project before graduating. Students work on projects and in programs that reflect Friends&#x27; practices. Projects must be grounded in one-on-one contact with communities and persons who are disempowered because of social, racial, economic, or health factors. These projects include intense, two-week experiences in school-sponsored, domestic or international work camps; once-a-week experiences that extend throughout the school year; and preapproved independent projects. Students may complete service projects during the school year or on vacation after their second year.

Recent service trips include India; Nicaragua; Cuba; Costa Rica; Boston, Massachusetts; Coastal Mississippi; and The Palestinian territories; France; South Africa; Ghana; Arizona; New Orleans, Louisiana; Americus, Georgia; South Carolina; Virginia Beach, Virginia; Washington, D.C.; West Virginia; South Korea; Vietnam; and China.

While more than half of the students at George School are on significant financial aid, proportionally few of those students can afford to go on international service trips as the maximum scholarship offered on most trips amounts to roughly half of the total costs, which range from $2000 to over $5000.

== Extracurricular activities ==
===Athletics===
Students are almost always required to play a competitive sport or participate in a physical education program. Since 1996, certain fully-scheduled students may take one trimester with no athletics. Still, first- and second-year students must play two interscholastic competitive sports, and juniors and seniors must play one:

*Fall: cross country, equestrian, field hockey, football, cheerleading, Association Football, volleyball, and tennis (girls)
*Winter: basketball, cheerleading (basketball), swimming, winter track, and wrestling
*Spring: baseball, softball, equestrian, golf, lacrosse, tennis (boys), and track and field

George School competes in the Friends School League, but in certain sports, such as equestrian, football, and wrestling, this is not possible due to the small number of league members that also participate.
There is an annual competition with Westtown which results in the awarding of the Patterson Cup, which most students and faculty refer to as &quot;The Moose&quot;. The scores are based on the results of all varsity and junior varsity competitions between the two schools.

The school once had a swimming competency requirement for graduation.

===Publications===
*&quot;The Curious George&quot; is the school&#x27;s student-produced newspaper on campus, formerly &quot;The George School News,&quot; &quot;&quot;G Magazine&quot;,&quot; and &quot;&quot;The Gazette&quot;.&quot; It returned to the name &quot;Curious George&quot; in 2016. 
*&quot;The Georgian&quot; is the alumni newspaper circulated to alums, parents, and faculty.
*&quot;Argo&quot; is a student-produced literary and arts magazine.
*&quot;Opus&quot; is the school&#x27;s yearbook.

===Performing arts===
The school has a very active performing arts program of long-standing. Although it is not formally an &quot;art school,&quot; many of George School&#x27;s most prominent alumni are performing artists.

Both student- and department-produced theater productions are performed in Walton Center. Shows range from conventional high school productions, such as Guys and Dolls, to more controversial pieces, such as the Laramie Project. George School&#x27;s dance classes perform in the annual Dance Eclectic, a combination of student and faculty-created choreography. George School Community Chorus includes a mixture of students and adults and offers a yearly winter concert. George School&#x27;s Musical Theater course performs a musical in Walton Auditorium in the spring or winter term.

===Symbols and logos===
*The school&#x27;s seal is an oil lamp with the inscription &quot;Mind the light,&quot; referring to the Quaker conception of God&#x27;s presence within all people as the inner light.
*The logo consists of the two words of the name (&quot;The George School&quot; is incorrect) separated by a stylized tree, reminiscent of the large one on the south end of campus. The Katsura tree which inspired the logo was removed and replaced in 2014 due to its &quot;frail and dangerous condition.&quot; The current logo, adopted in 2000, replaced a more stylized, &quot;bare branch&quot; logo adopted in the late 1970s.
*The school colors were historically buff and brown, but those proved harder and harder to find for sports uniforms. Since autumn 2000, the school colors have been green and white.
*The mascot is a cougar, portrayed by one of the cheerleaders.

==Campus==
Although its mailing address is Newtown, Pennsylvania, only a tiny part of its campus is in Newtown Township. Most of the campus is in Middletown Township. Both towns are in Bucks County.

Its property is now divided by the Route 332/Route 413 Newtown bypass, and the main entrance is on Route 413 south of the bypass.

The campus is adjacent to Neshaminy Creek, and Newtown Creek cuts through the property. Both are in the less-developed western part of the campus.

The Pennswood retirement community and Newtown Friends School, also Quaker institutions, are on George School land and adjacent to the campus.

===George School Station===

When founded, George School was relatively isolated. It had its own train station on the Reading Railroad&#x27;s Newtown line (later the Fox Chase Line), and its own post office branch. SEPTA suspended commuter train service on January 14, 1983. 

===Meetinghouse===
The campus meetinghouse was originally the 12th Street Meeting House at 10 South 12th Street, Philadelphia. Built 1812–1814, it incorporated materials from the Greater Meeting House at 2nd and Market Streets dating back to 1755. The building became redundant when the 12th Street Meeting merged with Race Street Meeting in 1956 to form Central Philadelphia Monthly Meeting. The land was sold, but the building was saved from demolition by being dismantled and relocated to George School, 1972–1974.

<doc id="1044657" wikidata="Q4879031" url="?curid=1044657" title="Bede Aircraft">
<text>Bede Aircraft Corporation was founded by aeronautical engineer Jim Bede in Cleveland in 1961 to produce the BD-1 kit aircraft, which eventually became the American Aviation Corporation&#x27;s AA-1. The company also created and produced a number of advanced kit planes including the famous Bede BD-5 (pusher propeller driven) and BD-5J (turbojet driven). The BD-5J has held the Guinness record as the World&#x27;s Smallest Jet Aircraft for more than a quarter century. Versions of it saw use in various Budweiser commercials (the Bud Light Jet, which was lost in an inflight fire and crash unrelated to airshow work). The tiny jet also appeared in two James Bond movies; &quot;Octopussy&quot; starring Sir Roger Moore, and later in a cameo appearance, hanging from the wall of Q&#x27;s workshop in &quot;Die Another Day&quot; starring Pierce Brosnan as Agent 007.

A later design, the BD-10 powered by the same engine (GE J-85) used on Lear Jet business jets, claimed to be the first supersonic personal jet built from a kit. Five examples were built in total and three of these crashed. Only two examples remain, both unflyable. The second aircraft was built at the Peregrine Aircraft Company in Minden Nevada. During a flight Test at Douglas County Airport, the aircraft far exceeded the maximum safe flight test speed, and broke up inflight, killing pilot Mike VanWagonen. It was estimated that this aircraft experienced catastrophic vertical stabilizer failure, due to the excess speed during the flight. None of them ever broke the sound barrier. This aircraft was featured on the cover of Aviation Week in June 1994, with a full pilots report.

<doc id="1044664" wikidata="Q2991426" url="?curid=1044664" title="Shefford County, Quebec">
<text>Shefford County is an historical county in southern Québec, Canada. It is named after Shefford, a small town in Bedfordshire county, England of the same name and is in the Eastern Townships region of Québec.

Topographically, part of the county is situated on the western foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The county contains four small lakes, Lake Waterloo near Waterloo, Lake Boivin in Granby Township, Lake Roxton in Roxton Township, and Lake Stukely in Stukely Township. All of the lakes flow into the Yamaska River, except for Lake Stukely which feeds into the St-François River, both of which flow northwards and are tributaries to the Saint Lawrence River. A prominent feature of the county is Mont Shefford in the Township of Shefford, one of a series of the Monteregian Hills that lie in a line between the Appalachian Mountains and the Saint Lawrence River.

The county is shaped almost like a trapezoid. It is bounded in the south by Brome County (48 km; 45°17&#x27; N), in the north and northwest by Bagot County (35 km; 45°41&#x27; N), Richmond and Sherbrooke Counties in the east (35 km; 72°15&#x27; W) and in the west by Rouville County (34 km; 72°46&#x27; W).

The county is divided into seven townships of which six are square-shaped, three in the north (from east to west, the Township of Ely, the Township of Roxton and the Township of Milton); and three in the south (from east to west, the Township of Stukely, the Township of Shefford and the Township of Granby). The Township of Upton is a strip of land located in the northwestern corner of the county and measures 1,25 km by 6,25 km. The county seat is Waterloo, located in the Township of Shefford. The best known town in the county is Granby, located in the township of the same name, known for its annual song and musical festival. Another well known town is Bromont, located in the southwestern corner of Shefford Township. The town has Canada&#x27;s only IBM plant and was the site of the 1976 Summer Olympics equestrian events.

In the early 1980s, Quebec abolished its counties, and Shefford County was divided and transferred to Acton Regional County Municipality (north), Les Maskoutains Regional County Municipality (northwest), La Haute-Yamaska Regional County Municipality (west), Brome-Missisquoi Regional County Municipality (southwest), Memphremagog Regional County Municipality (southeast), and Le Val-Saint-Francois Regional County Municipality (northeast).

<text>Heroes to Zeros is the third and final studio album by The Beta Band, released in 2004. It was produced by The Beta Band and mixed by Nigel Godrich.

The cover illustration was created by comic book writer and artist Kaare Andrews. The Beta Band logo for the album was created by comic book artist Dave McCaig, later to be reused on &quot;The Best of the Beta Band&quot;.

The song &quot;Liquid Bird&quot; features a sample of &quot;Painted Bird&quot; by Siouxsie and the Banshees.

Mason later said, &quot;We shouldn&#x27;t have produced it ourselves, and if you think we did a bad job of producing it, we made an even worse job mixing it. We presented it to the label, and they immediately handed the whole thing over to Nigel Godrich to mix.&quot;
