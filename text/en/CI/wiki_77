<text>Craig John Murray (born 17 October 1958) is a Scottish author, human rights campaigner, journalist, and former diplomat.

While he was the British ambassador to Uzbekistan (2002–2004), he exposed the violations of human rights in that country by the Karimov administration. This led to conflict with his superiors in the Foreign Office until finally he was removed from the post. Specifically, Murray lodged formal written complaints to his superiors stating that it was morally and legally wrong to obtain intelligence under torture and that intelligence received by the Secret Intelligence Service (and the US Central Intelligence Agency) from the Uzbek government was unreliable because it had been obtained through torture.

Subsequently he became a political activist, campaigning for human rights and for transparency in global politics as well as for the independence of Scotland. Between 2007 and 2010 he was the elected Rector of the University of Dundee.

His books include two memoirs, first about his time in Central Asia, &quot;Murder in Samarkand&quot; (2006), and then &quot;The Catholic Orangemen of Togo: and other Conflicts I Have Known&quot; (2009), about his early career years in West Africa; and a historical biography, &quot;Sikunder Burnes: Master of the Great Game&quot; (2016), about Alexander Burnes and the rivalry between the 19th century British and Russian Empires over influence in Asia.

==Early life and career==
===Family and education===
Murray was born in West Runton, Norfolk, to Robert Cameron Brunton Murray and Poppy Katherine Murray () and was raised in neighbouring Sheringham. His father, one of 13 children, had worked in the docks in Leith, Scotland, before joining the Royal Air Force. Murray was educated at Sheringham Primary and then at Paston School, an all-boys state grammar school in North Walsham in Norfolk, which he greatly disliked. He told John Crace in 2007 that pupils were obliged each week to don &quot;military uniform and become cadets. Either I skipped school or refused to take part, so I was frequently suspended&quot;. His A-levels suffered as a result.

Murray became President of the East Anglian Federation of Young Liberals. Aged 16 he was elected to the National Council of the Liberal Party to represent the Eastern Region of England. At the University of Dundee, to which, Murray said, he barely gained admission to read Modern History, he &quot;made a policy decision not to attend any lectures&quot;. Instead he &quot;read voraciously&quot; to teach himself, and graduated in 1982 with an MA (Hons) first class. He remained active in Liberal then Liberal Democrat politics, serving on the Students&#x27; Representative Council as an avowed liberal. Murray became President of Dundee University Students&#x27; Association, elected to this sabbatical office twice (1982–1983 and 1983–1984), an occurrence so unusual that the university court (the highest body) changed the rules to prevent him running a third time. He spent seven years in total at the university (he had to re-sit one year for not attending tutorials), compared with the four years for a Scottish first (honours) degree.

===Early years in HM Diplomatic Service===
Murray sat the 1984 Civil Service Open Competition exams in his second year as the Students&#x27; Association President because a woman he was interested in was also sitting them, although he had no interest in entering the civil service. Later, after he was told he was in the top three of his year, he chose the HM Diplomatic Service because &quot;it seemed marginally more glamorous than anything else on offer&quot;.

Murray had a number of overseas postings with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to Nigeria, Poland (in the 1990s, where he was first secretary heading the embassy&#x27;s political and economic section) and Ghana. In London, he was appointed to the FCO&#x27;s Southern European Department, as Cyprus desk officer, and later became head of the Maritime Section. In August 1991 he worked in the Embargo Surveillance Centre as the head of the FCO section. This job entailed monitoring the Iraqi government&#x27;s attempts at smuggling weapons and circumventing sanctions. His group gave daily reports to Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In &quot;Murder in Samarkand&quot;, he describes how this experience led him to disbelieve the claims of the UK and US governments in 2002 about Iraqi WMDs.

===Ambassador to Uzbekistan===
Murray was appointed ambassador to Uzbekistan, at the age of 43, where he was formally in office from August 2002 to October 2004, when he was dismissed. He told Nick Paton Walsh, then with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in July 2004 that &quot;there is no point in having cocktail-party relationships with a fascist regime&quot;. In a 2005 University of York speech, Murray recounted that, about a fortnight after his arrival, he observed a court trial at which an elderly defendant said his statement about two of the other accused, nephews of his, had been made as he watched his children being tortured, and the claim the two men were associates of Osama bin Laden was entirely false.

====Human rights====
In October 2002, according to Nick Cohen in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Murray &quot;delivered a speech which broke with all the established principles of Foreign Office diplomacy&quot;. &quot;The brave and honest ambassador&quot;, Cohen commented, spoke at a human rights conference hosted by Freedom House in Tashkent, although David Stern reported in January 2003 for EurasiaNet that other western officials had made similar comments. In the speech, Murray said that:
 Nick Paton Walsh wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;[t]he Foreign Office cleared the speech, but not without an acrimonious struggle over its content&quot;. Murray also said in his speech that the boiling to death of two men (reportedly members of Hizb ut-Tahrir) was &quot;not an isolated incident&quot;. A photograph of one of the men showed that his fingernails had been pulled out. The US ambassador John Herbst was present at the event and reportedly &quot;livid&quot; at Murray&#x27;s speech. According to a report in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Murray was advised by Whitehall not to antagonise the government in Tashkent any further. The Americans were said to have put pressure on the British government for Murray to tone down his comments. The then Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan confronted Uzbek President Islam Karimov with Murray&#x27;s claims.

Murray was summoned to the FCO in London and, on 8 March 2003, was reprimanded for writing to his employers, in response to a speech by President of the United States George W. Bush criticising human rights violations by Saddam Hussein, that &quot;when it comes to the Karimov regime, systematic torture and rape appear to be treated as peccadilloes, not to affect the relationship and to be downplayed in the international fora. Double standards? Yes&quot;. Murray believed the human rights abuses in Uzbekistan were worse than in Iraq in the run up to the invasion of Iraq, but that the latter was being invaded while the government of the former was being supported. In an internal document by Murray, later leaked to the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, he commented that Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) used intelligence provided by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from the Uzbek authorities gained through torture. Murray wrote that &quot;[t]orture dupes are forced to sign up to confessions showing what the Uzbek government wants the US and UK to believe&quot;. &quot;It is morally, legally and practically wrong to continue to receive this material. It is hypocritical and fatally undermines our moral standing&quot;, he wrote in a July 2004 dispatch. Murray denied being responsible for the leaks.

According to Murray, the Uzbek government overstated the activities of local militants and their connections to Al-Qaeda. He later wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the material from the CIA &quot;revealed the same pattern of information&quot; as the &quot;forced confessions&quot; of which he had become aware. In October 2004 the British government said neither it, nor the intelligence agencies, had ever used torture or encouraged others to so on its behalf. A later enquiry by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in connection with an interview with Murray, did not indicate the British had instituted an &quot;absolute ban&quot; on using information gained via torture. According to Murray, in March 2003 the Foreign Office legal team told him there was nothing to prevent their use of information gained by the Uzbeks using these methods.

====Disciplinary charges====
Some of the embassy staff were sacked in July 2003 while Murray was away on holiday. They were reinstated after he expressed his outrage to the FCO. Later during the same holiday he was recalled to London for disciplinary reasons. He was confronted with 18 charges on 21 August 2003. These included &quot;hiring dolly birds [pretty young women] for above the usual rate&quot; for the visa department, although Murray said that the department had an all-male staff, and Murray was accused of granting British visas to Uzbek women in exchange for sex in his office. The FCO gave him a week to resign and told him that discussing the charges would be a violation of the Official Secrets Act 1989. Representatives of the US embassy in Tashkent and the British Foreign Office later denied the US government had any involvement in Murray being recalled to London. However, a &quot;local analyst&quot; in Tashkent told Nick Paton Walsh that Murray and the US ambassador John Herbst (who left his Uzbekistan post in 2003) were regularly in heated disagreement.

Murray collapsed during a medical check in Tashkent on 2 September 2003 and was airlifted to St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London. He was treated in hospital for depression having seriously considered taking his own life. After an FCO internal inquiry conducted by Tony Crombie, Head of the FCO&#x27;s Overseas Territories Department, all but two of the charges (being drunk at work and misusing the embassy&#x27;s Land Rover) were dropped. The charges were leaked to the press in October 2003. Murray returned to work in mid-November 2003. Only a few days after his return to Uzbekistan, Murray suffered another health crisis and was again flown back to London for medical treatment for what turned out to have been a near-fatal pulmonary embolism on a lung.

Around the same time, a group of more than a dozen British expatriates in Tashkent, including businessmen, wrote to the Foreign Secretary Jack Straw defending Murray as an advocate for inward British trade. One of the co-signers of the letter said there was a &quot;common belief that Mr Murray is being sacrificed to the Americans&quot;. Members of Ozod Ovoz (Free Voice), an Uzbeki free speech group, pleaded with Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President Bush for Murray to remain in his post as he was &quot;an example for other ambassadors&quot;. Murray&#x27;s stance was also supported by Clare Short, Secretary of State for International Development until her resignation in May 2003, and Daniel Hannan, the Conservative Member of the European Parliament (MEP).

The FCO exonerated Murray of all 18 charges in January 2004 after a four-month investigation but reprimanded him for speaking about them. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell said the government &quot;endorse his comments about the human rights situation in Uzbekistan&quot;.

====Removal from post====
Murray was removed from his post in October 2004, shortly after the &quot;Financial Times&quot; leak which, Murray later told Amy Goodman, he thought had been leaked by the British government to incriminate him.

The FCO denied any direct connection and stated that Murray had been suspended for disciplinary reasons after he gave a series of media interviews criticising the FCO. He was suspended, amid claims that he had lost the confidence of senior officials and colleagues. The following day, in an interview on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, Murray countered that he was a &quot;victim of conscience&quot;, although he did not then believe the Americans were involved. A week later he was accused of &quot;gross misconduct&quot; by the FCO. A spokesman said &quot;He is suspended on full pay pending an investigation into his conduct. I think it is more what he said than giving interviews&quot; to the media. In February 2005 Murray took a severance package from the FCO, most of which was used to pay tax and fund his divorce.

A later report by European investigators found that Uzbekistan was used as a base in the US programme of extraordinary rendition during the War in Afghanistan (the neighbouring country) and Iraq, which remained secret during Murray&#x27;s time in the country, because such countries were tolerant of the use of torture. Speaking to Kevin Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in January 2008 Murray gave this as a reason why the response to his revelations was so &quot;ferocious&quot;.

==Subsequent career==

=== Alisher Usmanov affair ===

In September 2007 shortly after Alisher Usmanov&#x27;s investment in Arsenal Football Club, Murray blogged about the character of Usmanov, an Uzbek multi-billionaire whom &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine had identified as the 142nd wealthiest person in the world. Murray had written two &quot;quite highly classified&quot; telegrams about Usmanov&#x27;s influence and commercial dealings to the Foreign Office in 2002 and 2004 while he was ambassador in Uzbekistan. Usmanov&#x27;s solicitors, Schillings, requested that the hosting company Fasthosts delete the material from Murray&#x27;s blog. As a result, the server that hosted Murray&#x27;s blog was permanently closed by the hosting company Fasthosts on 20 September 2007, an action which resulted in unintended deletion of other sites, including the blog by Boris Johnson.

An attempt to release the Foreign Office documents, including Murray&#x27;s telegrams, was made by Jeremy Corbyn, then a backbench Labour MP, in whose constituency Arsenal is based. In late October 2007 Jim Murphy, then minister for Europe, refused to release the documents on data protection grounds.

=== University career ===
Murray was elected to the position of Rector of the University of Dundee, his &quot;alma mater&quot;, on 16 February 2007. The other nominee was former British Lion and Scotland rugby captain Andy Nicol. Murray opposed the cuts to University departments and services which were proposed. He remained in the post until 2010.

=== Entrepreneurial activities ===

As of 2009 Murray was executive chairman of Atholl Energy Ltd and chairman of Westminster Development Ltd, a gold mining company, both operating in Accra, Ghana.

===Political activities===

Murray remained a member of the Liberal Democrats until 2005. He continued to oppose the War on Terror.

He stood for election to the House of Commons three times. At the May 2005 general election he stood as an independent, in Blackburn, Lancashire, against his former boss, Jack Straw, then the MP for the constituency. He polled 2,082 votes (5.0%) and came fifth out of seven candidates.

Following the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, Murray stood for election in the July 2009 Norwich North by-election under the slogan &quot;Put an honest man into Parliament&quot;. He polled 953 votes (2.77%), which placed him sixth out of the twelve candidates.

Murray rejoined the Liberal Democrats, according to his blog entry on 22 March 2010. By September 2011 he had left the Liberal Democrats again, as he objected to policies pursued by the coalition government, and joined the Scottish National Party.

Murray supported the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. Following his failed bid for SNP nomination, Murray resigned from the SNP in March 2016 &quot;to campaign for Scottish Independence&quot; in the 2017 parliamentary election.

In the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, Murray was chosen as the main candidate for Action for Independence in the Lothian region. However, Murray and the other Action for Independence candidates stood down to support Alex Salmond, who launched the Alba Party.

In an April 2023 blog post titled &quot;So Now Who Do We Vote For?&quot;, Murray advocated supporting the Alba Party in Scotland, the Green Party in England, Plaid Cymru in Wales and Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland.

In the July 2024 general election Murray stood for the Workers&#x27; Party in the Blackburn constituency. He came third with 7,105 votes, or 18.3%.

===Investigative reporting===
In 2011–2012 Murray exposed four undisclosed meetings that took place from September 2009 between Britain&#x27;s then defence minister Liam Fox, Fox’s friend Adam Werritty and the UK Ambassador to Israel Matthew Gould in Tel Aviv, possibly to promote a pro-Israel or anti-Iran foreign policy outside the control of the UK Foreign Office.

===Scepticism about Salisbury poisoning ===
Murray questioned the official UK government account of the Skripal poisoning in Salisbury, March 2018, writing on his blog that Israeli security services were more likely to be behind the poisoning than Russia and that, while Russia lacked a motive, &quot;Israel has a clear motivation for damaging the Russian reputation&quot;. This contributed to &quot;The Times&quot; and others writing that he had promoted conspiracy theories. Murray, who had visited the former chemical site at Nukus, Uzbekistan, where novichok was manufactured, stated that Russia&#x27;s stocks had been dismantled with US assistance. He said &quot;anyone who expresses scepticism&quot; about Russian involvement in the poisoning &quot;is seen as an enemy of the state&quot;. In September 2018 Murray claimed in a blog post that the photos issued by the Metropolitan Police of the suspects in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal were &quot;impossible&quot; because they depicted the two suspects at the same place at the same time. A Metropolitan Police spokesperson confirmed that the photographs &quot;of two suspects at Gatwick are taken from two different cameras covering separate lanes at the point passengers exit from international arrivals&quot;. Murray retracted his claim, corrected his post and added a note that &quot;it is good to acknowledge mistakes&quot;.

=== Relationship with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks ===
In December 2016 Murray said that the leak of Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton campaign emails before the US 2016 presidential election was the work of a DNC insider, and said that he had met the leaker. Murray said that the US intelligence claims about the source of the leaks were &quot;bullshit&quot;. Murray contradicted the conclusion of American intelligence services that the Russian authorities had hacked the DNC and Clinton servers. Assange responded to the claim by saying that &quot;Craig Murray is not authorized to talk on behalf of WikiLeaks.&quot;

Murray was one of few people granted access to Julian Assange&#x27;s extradition hearing which started in the Old Bailey on 7 September 2020. He published detailed reports of each day&#x27;s proceedings on his website. He was invited to Assange and Stella Moris&#x27; wedding at Belmarsh Prison in March 2022. The UK Ministry of Justice said it had barred Murray from attending due to security concerns. It had initially said that Murray had not been invited. Murray said his ban was aimed at isolating Assange.

===Alex Salmond trial and contempt of court charge===

Murray attended two days of Alex Salmond&#x27;s trial in 2020 and wrote about the court proceedings on his blog and on Twitter. He alleged that the Scottish National Party leadership, the Scottish government, the Crown Office and police conspired to convict Salmond on charges of sexual harassment and attempted rape.

The judge in the case, Lady Dorrian, had issued an order forbidding the publication of the names of the women who testified against Salmond, or other information that might identify them. In March 2021 she found Murray to be in contempt of court after he published information that in her view could potentially lead to identifying some of the complainants, and sentenced him to eight months&#x27; imprisonment. In June 2021 she refused Murray&#x27;s application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, saying that there were &quot;no arguable points of law arising&quot; in his appeal.

Murray appealed directly to the Supreme Court but his application was refused on 29 July 2021. Murray announced that he would appeal to the European Court of Human Rights and surrendered himself to the police on 1 August 2021. Alba Party MP Kenny MacAskill called Murray&#x27;s sentencing &quot;vindictive and a sad day for Scottish justice&quot;.

Murray was released on 30 November 2021, after serving half of his eight month sentence. In March 2022 the Appeal Court of the High Court of Justiciary refused his petition to quash the finding of contempt along with the prison sentence.

===Workers Party of Britain===
In March 2024 Murray was selected as the Workers Party of Britain candidate for the Blackburn constituency at the 2024 general election.

==Personal life==
Murray married his first wife, Fiona Ann Kennedy, in 1984. They had two children before separating in 2004. Murray married Nadira Alieva, an Uzbek woman, on 6 May 2009. They have two sons.

He is a friend of Peter Oborne, who described him as &quot;one of the greatest truth-tellers of our time&quot; and said that &quot;Apart from Julian Assange, no one has done more to expose coalition crimes during the War on Terror.&quot;

In November 2023 Murray&#x27;s Twitter account was hacked.

==Works==
===&quot;Murder in Samarkand&quot;===
Murray&#x27;s book &quot;Murder in Samarkand – A British Ambassador&#x27;s Controversial Defiance of Tyranny in the War on Terror&quot; (2006) is a memoir about his time as an ambassador.

In December 2005 Murray published confidential memos on his website, which had been officially removed from the text when &quot;Murder in Samarkand&quot; was submitted for checking. He had initially acceded to these cuts. According to Murray, the British government &quot;refused to clear it&quot; uncut. The Foreign Office, after publication was announced, &quot;said that they wouldn&#x27;t seek to prevent publication but that they may act against it later&quot;.

The British government claimed copyright over the documents in July 2006, saying they were &quot;damaging to the national interest&quot; and demanding they be removed. In response, Murray deleted some of the material.

Murray&#x27;s biography of Alexander Burnes, first published in 2016, was reviewed favourably in a number of academic journals, including the historical and area studies journals &quot;Asian Affairs&quot; and &quot;Central Asian Survey&quot;.

== Awards ==
* January 2006: the Sam Adams Award for Integrity in Intelligence, in recognition of his campaigning work on torture and human rights
* November 2006: the Premio Alta Qualità della Città di Bologna

Murray has turned down three honours from Queen Elizabeth, saying letters after his name are &quot;not his thing&quot;.

== Portrayals in fiction ==
Murray&#x27;s life featured in a show by Nadira Alieva, &quot;The British Ambassador&#x27;s Bellydancer&quot;, initially presented in 2007 at the Arcola Theatre in Hackney, later moving to London&#x27;s West End.

Robin Soans used an interview with Murray and Alieva as a character for his verbatim-style play &quot;Talking to Terrorists&quot; which had a successful run at the Royal Court Theatre and has since been produced worldwide. Soans used Murray again as a verbatim character in his later play &quot;Life After Scandal&quot; in which Murray &quot;tells of how scandal was used against him when the government wanted to undermine his claims about humanitarian disasters&quot;.

On 20 February 2010 BBC Radio Four broadcast a radio play &quot;Murder in Samarkand&quot;, written by Sir David Hare and directed by Clive Brill, based on Murray&#x27;s book. The play, with David Tennant portraying Craig Murray, was nominated for best drama at the Sony Radio Academy Awards 2011 and had positive reviews.

<text>The Sajó ( , Hungarian) or Slaná (Slovak) is a river in Slovakia and Hungary.

Its length is 229 km, of which 110 km is in Slovakia. Its source is in the Stolica Mountains range of the Slovak Ore Mountains. It flows through the Slovak town Rožňava and the Hungarian city Miskolc. In Hungary Sajó flows through the county of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén. It flows into the River Tisza near Tiszaújváros. Its main tributaries are the Bodva and the Hornád. It is also known for the Battle of the Sajó River from 11 April 1241 between the Mongol Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name is the subject of scholar discussions. Hungarian linguists and historians suggested the derivation from the Hungarian &quot;sojó, só folyó&quot; (salt water, river) already in the 19th century. Newer theories associate the name with &quot;sió&quot; referring to fast streams. According to Slovak linguists the name is pre-Hungarian (&quot;Slaná&quot;: salt river) and most likely not associated with the salinity but with the salt road existing already in times of Great Moravia. The supporters argue by numerous Slavic toponyms in the river basin and by local names related to &quot;soľ&quot; (salt) and Moravia like &quot;Moravce&quot;, &quot;Soľár&quot;, &quot;Solišče&quot;, &quot;Soľka&quot;, &quot;Soľník&quot;, &quot;Morava&quot; (according to this interpretation the Hungarian name is a later translation).

<text>The Quebec Nordiques (, pronounced in Quebec French, in Canadian English; translated &quot;Northmen&quot; or &quot;Northerners&quot;) were a professional ice hockey team based in Quebec City. The Nordiques played in the World Hockey Association (1972–1979) and the National Hockey League (1979–1995). The franchise was relocated to Denver in May 1995 and renamed the Colorado Avalanche. They played their home games at the Colisée de Québec from 1972 to 1995.

The Nordiques were the only major professional sports team based in Quebec City in the modern era, and one of two ever; the other, the Quebec Bulldogs, played in the National Hockey Association (NHA) from 1910 to 1917 and one season in the NHL in 1919–20.

==History==

===Beginnings in the WHA===

The Nordiques formed as one of the original World Hockey Association (WHA) teams in 1972–73. The franchise was originally awarded to a group in San Francisco and sold to a consortium of Quebec City-based businessmen who owned the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). They bought the team after the Quebec Aces of the American Hockey League (AHL), relocated to Richmond, Virginia.

The team was named the Quebec Nordiques because they were one of the northernmost teams in professional sports in North America. Quebec City is located at 47 degrees north latitude; Nordiques translated from French to English means &quot;Northerners&quot; or &quot;Northmen.&quot; The only WHA teams located farther north were the Alberta Oilers, who changed their name to the Edmonton Oilers after one season, Calgary Cowboys, Vancouver Blazers, and Winnipeg Jets.

The Nordiques&#x27; first head coach was the legendary Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard but he only lasted two games – a 2–0 loss to the Cleveland Crusaders and a 6–0 win against the Alberta Oilers. Richard decided coaching was not his forte and stepped down.

The Nordiques&#x27; first star was two-way defenceman J. C. Tremblay, who led the WHA in assists in the league&#x27;s first season and was named a league All-Star for his first four years in Quebec. The next season team was joined by Serge Bernier and Rejean Houle. In 1974–75 season, the Nordiques finally made the playoffs with the help of the high-scoring Marc Tardif; the year also saw the debut of Real Cloutier, who would be one of the WHA&#x27;s stars. They beat the Phoenix Roadrunners and the Minnesota Fighting Saints to reach the finals, where they were swept in four games by the Gordie Howe-led Houston Aeros.

The 1975–76 season saw the squad become a high-flying offensive juggernaut, becoming the only team in major professional history to have five players break 100 points (Tardif, Cloutier, Chris Bordeleau, Bernier and Houle). The season ended in disappointment as the Nordiques lost to the Calgary Cowboys in the first round of the playoffs, after losing Marc Tardif to injury after a controversial hit by the Cowboys&#x27; Rick Jodzio.

Despite injuries to Tardif and an aging Tremblay, the Nordiques finally captured the Avco World Trophy in 1976–77 as they took out the New England Whalers and the Indianapolis Racers in five games before beating the Winnipeg Jets in seven games, behind Bernier&#x27;s record 36 points in 17 playoff games. They represented Canada at the 1977 Izvestia Trophy in Moscow, finishing last with a 0–3–1 record.

By 1978, the WHA was in crisis, and Marcel Aubut, by then the team&#x27;s president under ownership of the Carling O&#x27;Keefe brewer, began checking on interest in the NHL. The Nordiques were unable to defend their title and fell in the 1978 playoffs to the New England Whalers. The 1978–79 season would be the final one for the WHA and for J. C. Tremblay, who retired at the end of the season and had his no. 3 jersey retired.

===1980s===

As part of the NHL–WHA merger, the WHA insisted on including all of its surviving Canadian teams, including the Nordiques, among the teams taken into the NHL at the end of the 1978–79 season. As a result, the Nordiques entered the NHL along with the Whalers, Oilers, and Jets. The Nordiques were placed in the Adams Division of the Prince of Wales Conference.

Forced to let all but three players go in a 1979 dispersal draft, the Nordiques sank to the bottom of the standings. They finished the 1979–80 NHL season with the second-worst record in the league despite the play of promising rookie left winger Michel Goulet. An early highlight to the otherwise dreary season came when Real Cloutier became the second NHL player, following Alex Smart, ever to score a hat trick in his first NHL game.

In August 1980, the Nordiques announced that they signed newly-defected brothers Peter and Anton Stastny, members of the Czechoslovak national team, since they drafted Anton in the 1979 entry draft. Their brother, Marian, would follow and sign with Quebec in the summer of 1981. The following season, led by Peter Stastny&#x27;s 109-point Calder Memorial Trophy-winning performance, the Nordiques made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time, but fell in the best-of-five preliminary round in five games to the Philadelphia Flyers.

Led by Goulet and Peter Stastny, the Nordiques made the playoffs seven years in a row. However, due to the playoff structure during most of the 1980s, the Nordiques faced the near-certainty of having to get past either the Montreal Canadiens or Boston Bruins – or both – to make it to the conference finals. In 1981–82, despite notching only 82 points in the regular season, they defeated the Canadiens and Bruins, both in winner-take-all games on the road. Their Cinderella run ended when they were swept by the defending champion New York Islanders in the conference finals.

The intraprovincial rivalry with the Canadiens intensified during the 1983–84 NHL season culminating in the infamous Good Friday Massacre – or &quot;la bataille du Vendredi saint&quot;, as it is called in francophone Canada – during the 1984 playoffs. The Canadiens scored five unanswered goals in the third period of game 6 at Montreal Forum to eliminate the Nordiques. The goals all came after Peter Stastny and Dale Hunter were ejected in the brawl.

In 1984–85, Montreal and Quebec battled for the Adams Division title. The Nordiques finished with 91 points, at the time their highest point total as an NHL team. However, the Canadiens won the division by three points, including a 7–1 Canadiens&#x27; win in Montreal Forum in the final week of the regular season. This was still enough, however, for the Nordiques to garner home-ice advantage for the first time ever as an NHL team. After being pushed to five games by the Buffalo Sabres, they exacted revenge on the Canadiens in the division finals by ousting them in seven games. Peter Stastny clinched the series with an overtime goal in game 7 at the Forum. They then took the powerful Philadelphia Flyers, who had the league&#x27;s best record, to six games.
The Nordiques won their first NHL division title in 1985–86, but a defensive collapse in the 1986 playoffs allowed the Hartford Whalers to sweep the Nordiques in three games.

The next season the Nordiques met the Whalers in the division semifinals of the 1987 playoffs for the second straight season, this time Quebec got their revenge beating Hartford in six games. The next round saw more of the Nordiques–Canadiens rivalry as the playoff series went to seven games, with the Canadiens coming out on top. In that same season, when Quebec hosted Rendez-vous &#x27;87, an alteration of the NHL All-Star Game to include the Soviet national team, a costumed mascot, Badaboum – a fuzzy, roly-poly blue creature – began entertaining fans at the Colisée de Québec with his bizarre dance routines. Badaboum was created just for Rendez-vous &#x27;87, but generated such a following that the Nordiques made him a permanent fixture at home games.

Decline began the following season when the Nordiques finished last in their division – the first of five straight years of finishing at the bottom of the Adams Division – and missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years. In 1988–89 the Nordiques had league-worst 27–46–7 record.

The 1989–90 season saw the return of head coach Michel Bergeron, who had coached the team from 1980 to 1987. The season was also highlighted by the arrival of Hall of Famer Guy Lafleur, who turned down a lucrative offer from the Los Angeles Kings and chose instead to finish his career in his home province. It soon became clear Lafleur&#x27;s best years were far behind him as he managed only 24 goals in 98 games with Quebec over two seasons. The Nordiques once again finished the season in last place with abysmal 12–61–7 record.

In March 1990, the Nordiques traded Goulet to the Chicago Blackhawks, while Peter Stastny was sent to the New Jersey Devils respectively. Despite the stellar play of young forward Joe Sakic, the Nordiques struggled throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, in the 1989 NHL entry draft they drafted Swedish prospect Mats Sundin, making him the first European to be selected first overall in an NHL entry draft. In the following draft Quebec chose first again, this time taking Owen Nolan.

===1990s===

====Lindros draft and trade====

In the 1991 draft, the Nordiques once again had the first overall pick. They picked junior star Eric Lindros, even though he had let it be known well in advance that he would never play for Quebec. Among the reasons, Lindros cited distance, lack of marketing potential, and having to speak French. After the Nordiques selected him anyway, Lindros then refused to wear the team jersey on draft day and only held it for press photographs. Lindros, on advice of his mother Bonnie, refused to sign with the team and began a holdout that lasted over a year. The Nordiques president publicly announced that they would make Lindros the centrepiece of their franchise turnaround, and refused to trade Lindros, saying that he would not have a career in the NHL as long as he held out. Some of the Nordiques wanted to move on without Lindros, as Joe Sakic commented, &quot;We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I&#x27;m tired of hearing that name. He&#x27;s not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game.&quot; Meanwhile, the Nordiques finished with another dreadful season in 1991–92, missing the 70-point barrier for the fifth year in a row. For the first time since 1988, the Nordiques did not finish with the NHL&#x27;s worst record, as they finished ahead of the expansion San Jose Sharks in the overall standings.

On June 30, 1992, after confusion over whether Quebec had traded Lindros&#x27; rights to the Philadelphia Flyers or New York Rangers was settled by an arbitrator, the Nordiques sent Lindros to the Flyers in exchange for forwards Peter Forsberg and Mike Ricci, goaltender Ron Hextall, defencemen Steve Duchesne and Kerry Huffman, and future considerations, which eventually became enforcer Chris Simon, two first-round picks and US$15 million. One of the draft picks was used by the Nordiques to select goaltender Jocelyn Thibault, the other was traded twice and ultimately used by the Washington Capitals to select Nolan Baumgartner.

After the trade, Lindros said that his refusal to play for the Nordiques had nothing to do with the language question, and more to do with what he saw as a &quot;lack of winning spirit&quot; in the Nordiques organization. However, in 2016, Lindros said that he simply did not want to play for a team owned by Aubut.

The deal transformed the Nordiques from league doormats to a legitimate Stanley Cup contender almost overnight. Forsberg won the Calder Memorial Trophy in 1994–95, his first season with the Nordiques, and would be one of the cornerstones of the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise for almost a decade with his playmaking and physical presence (albeit being out with injury for periods of time like Lindros), winning the Hart Memorial Trophy and Art Ross Trophy in 2002–03. Ricci would give six useful seasons to the franchise before being traded on November 21, 1997. Hextall was moved after a single season to the New York Islanders, and in return the Nordiques got Mark Fitzpatrick (who would go on to be left unprotected in the 1993 NHL expansion draft in which he was claimed by the Florida Panthers) and a first round pick, which the Nordiques used to select Adam Deadmarsh, who would be a key member of the Avalanche Cup-winning teams. Thibault would be traded for Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy in December 1995, after the franchise moved to Denver.

====1992–1994====

During the 1992–93 NHL season, these new players, along with Sakic – now a bona fide NHL All-Star – and the rapidly developing Sundin and Nolan, led Quebec to the biggest single-season turnaround in NHL history. They leaped from 52 points in the previous season to 104 – in the process, going from the second-worst record in the league to the fourth-best (behind only Pittsburgh, Boston and Chicago), as well as notching the franchise&#x27;s first 100-point season as an NHL team. They made the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time in six seasons, and also garnered home-ice advantage in the first round for only the third time ever as an NHL team. However, they fell to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in the first round, winning the first two games but then losing the next four due to inspired goaltending from Montreal&#x27;s Patrick Roy. Sakic and Sundin both scored over 100 points each, and head coach Pierre Page was a finalist for the Jack Adams Award.

In 1993–94, the NHL renamed their conferences and divisions to better reflect geography; the Nordiques would be situated in the Northeast Division of the Eastern Conference for their last two seasons of play in Quebec. The Nordiques missed the playoffs in 1993–94 as they struggled with injuries. After the season, Sundin was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in return for Wendel Clark. This trade was controversial for both teams, as Sundin was one of the Nordiques&#x27; rising talents, while Clark was the Maple Leafs captain and fan favourite. While Clark performed respectably, he then became embroiled in a contract dispute after the season ended and was sent to the New York Islanders.

====Final season and move to Colorado====

For the 1994–95 season, Marc Crawford was hired as the new head coach, and Forsberg was deemed ready to finally join the team, but first there was the problem of a lockout. In the shortened 48-game season, the Nordiques finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference. However, the team faltered in the 1995 playoffs and was eliminated in the first round by the defending Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers in six games.

The playoff loss proved to be the Nordiques&#x27; swan song as the team&#x27;s financial troubles increasingly took centre stage, even in the face of renewed fan support over the previous three years. The league&#x27;s Canadian teams found it difficult to compete in a new age of rising player salaries and a weakening Canadian dollar. Quebec City was by far the smallest market in the NHL; it was also the second-smallest major-league city in North America, behind only Green Bay, Wisconsin; home of the National Football League&#x27;s Green Bay Packers. However, the Packers had long drawn support from the nearby major market of Milwaukee, a luxury the Nordiques did not have.

The Nordiques also faced a unique disadvantage due to Quebec City&#x27;s status as a virtually monolingual francophone city. There were no privately-owned anglophone radio stations and only one privately-owned anglophone television station, CKMI. The only anglophone newspaper, the &quot;Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph&quot;, was a weekly. The near-total lack of English-language media limited the Nordiques&#x27; marketability even in their best years, and made many non-French-speaking players wary of playing for them.

While Aubut never lost money on the Nordiques, he feared unsustainable losses without a bailout from Quebec&#x27;s provincial government. However, Premier Jacques Parizeau turned the request down, as few in Quebec were willing to be seen as subsidizing a hockey club that paid multimillion-dollar salaries. Finally in May 1995, shortly after the Nordiques were eliminated from the playoffs, Aubut announced the acceptance of an offer from COMSAT Entertainment Group, owner of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Denver Nuggets to move the team to Denver, where it was renamed the Colorado Avalanche.

Maintaining their momentum from their successful last season as the Nordiques, the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in their first season after the move, added another in 2000–01, and then won in 2021–22. They would also win their division every year in their first eight years in Denver for a total of nine consecutive division titles, the second-most in the expansion era.

The last active NHL player who played for the Nordiques was Adam Foote who announced his retirement after the 2010–11 season. The last active player in any league was Martin Rucinsky, who announced his retirement after the 2014–15 season while playing in the Czech Extraliga.

==Uniforms==

Throughout their history, the Nordiques were famous for their iconic powder blue and white uniforms. But for their first WHA season, the Nordiques&#x27; uniforms featured splashes of red on the shoulders, waist and numbers. From 1973 to 1975, the blue on the Nordiques uniforms briefly reverted to a dark royal blue shade. Contrasting nameplates were used in 1973–74, then the fleur-de-lis symbol was added to the shoulders the following season which was modeled after the flag of Quebec.

Prior to the 1975–76 season, the Nordiques unveiled what was now their standard look, returning to a powder blue base and adding three fleur-de-lis symbols on the waist. Red was only used on the logo. For the first season, the Nordiques wore red pants, but switched to powder blue pants afterwards. This look would be carried over upon joining the NHL in 1979, and other than some minor trim changes on the logo and numbers, remained basically the same until the relocation.

The Colorado Avalanche unveiled the &quot;Reverse Retro&quot; design based on the Nordiques uniforms on November 16, 2020, honouring the legacy of the franchise.

===Uniform change===
Aubut intended to change the team&#x27;s entire look had he won enough financing to keep the Nordiques in Quebec City for the 1995–96 season. The Nordiques would have abandoned the blue, white, and red palette they had worn throughout their history in favour of a teal, black, and navy scheme. The team would also have abandoned the &quot;igloo holding a hockey stick&quot; logo they had used for their entire existence in favour of a fierce looking Siberian husky, with &quot;NORDIQUES&quot; in grey block letters below it and the &quot;I&quot; in the team&#x27;s name fashioned to look like an icicle. These designs were published in local papers before the team ultimately decided to move. Due to the team missing an NHL deadline, the logo and uniforms would not have taken effect until the 1996–97 season.

<text>Lands&#x27; End, Inc., headquartered in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, is a retailer of clothing, baggage, and furniture.

In fiscal 2023, 63.2% of its revenue was from online retail orders in the U.S., 7.7% of revenue was international orders, 18.3% of revenue was sales of logo apparel to businesses and schools, 7.6% of revenue was received from third-party sellers, and 3.2% of revenue was from company-operated stores. As of February 2, 2024, the company operated 26 stores.

The company is named after Land&#x27;s End; after promotional materials were printed, the founder noticed the typographical error in the location of the apostrophe, but could not afford to reprint the material.

==History==
Lands&#x27; End began as a mail-order yachting supply company in 1963 in Chicago. It was founded by Gary Comer, along with his partners, 1963 Pan American Games gold medalist sailors Richard Stearns and Robert Halperin, and two of Stearns&#x27; employees.

In 1978, it expanded into general clothing and home furnishings, and moved to Dodgeville, Wisconsin. 

In October 1986, it became a public company via an initial public offering.

In the late 1980s, Lands&#x27; End was the jersey supplier of the United States national rugby union team.

In July 1995, the company launched its website, Landsend.com.

In 2002, Sears, Roebuck and Company acquired the company for $2 billion in cash. Sears offered products by Lands&#x27; End in many of its retail stores, until 2019.

In November 2009, Lands&#x27; End launched Lands&#x27; End Canvas, which offered a more fashion-oriented selection of casual clothing for men and women. It was discontinued in 2013. The line was reintroduced in 2016 but cancelled in 2017 by the new CEO.

In 2013, the company partnered with Borderfree to display international orders in local currency.

The company began selling on Debenhams and in 2014, in its first international partnership, in House of Fraser.

In April 2014, Sears completed the corporate spin-off of the company, which once again became publicly traded.

Jerome Griffith became CEO in March 2017, succeeding Federica Marchionni.

In 2018, the company began selling on Amazon.com.

In 2018 and 2019, the company produced uniforms for employees of Delta Airlines and American Airlines.

In 2019, Lands&#x27; End closed its remaining store-within-a-store branches in Sears stores, after Sears Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In 2020, the company entered into a partnership with Kohl&#x27;s to sell the company&#x27;s products in its stores.

In 2021, the company partnered with QVC to sell its products on its website, expanded to video sales in April 2022.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1998, Lands&#x27; End was named among the 100 Best Companies To Work For In America by &quot;Fortune&quot; Magazine.

==Controversies==
In 2016, feminist activist Gloria Steinem was featured in the catalog of Lands&#x27; End. After an outcry from anti-abortion customers, the company removed Steinem from its website. The company then faced further criticism, this time both from customers who were still unhappy that Steinem had been featured in the first place, and customers who were unhappy that Steinem had been removed.

<doc id="1070514" wikidata="Q839291" url="?curid=1070514" title="TurboJET">
<text>Shun Tak–China Travel Ship Management Limited, doing business as TurboJET (), is a ferry company based in Hong Kong. The company was established from the joint venture between Shun Tak Holdings and China Travel International Investment Hong Kong in July 1999. It operates hydrofoil and high-speed ferry services between Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai in the Pearl River Delta area.

TurboJET is one of the two companies operating high-speed ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau – the other one being Cotai Water Jet. TurboJET uses the IATA two-letter airline code 8S only for routes to and from Hong Kong International Airport.

==History==
Shun Tak and China Travel had their own separate ferry business brands before merging as TurboJET on 1 July 1999. They were Far East Hydrofoil by Shun Tak, and Turbo Cat by CTS Parkview Company Ltd.

It acquired New Ferry – Transporte Marítimo de Passageiros Limitada (abbreviated New World First Ferry (Macau)) from NWS Holdings for HK$350 million on 11 August 2011, and completed the transaction on 30 September.

Since the opening of the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge in October 2018, passenger numbers have been falling sharply due to the direct competition. The ferry service was deemed too slow and expensive. Since 2019, TurboJET started gradually cutting frequencies adjusting to the passenger numbers with the anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Routes==
TurboJET provides services between Hong Kong, Hong Kong International Airport, Macau, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, all located around the Pearl River Delta in southern China. The route between Hong Kong and Macau is the busiest, operating 24 hours a day, taking approximately one hour to travel the journey on TurboJET&#x27;s high-speed vessels.

In the past, besides the inter-city routes, Turbo Cat operated Hong Kong out-lying routes during the years 1999 to 2000. The routes were Central to Tuen Mun (on weekdays), and Central to Tai O (on weekends). After the merger, the routes were operated under the TurboJET brand.

==Fleet==
TurboJET is the world&#x27;s largest operator of Boeing&#x27;s Jetfoils; all used to belong to the former Far East Hydrofoil, which also used PS-30 and FoilCat. The former Turbo Cat used Flying Cat and TriCat.

TurboJET&#x27;s fleet includes seven major types of vessels (and eight minor vessels), with one of the major types (and two minor types) rented from another company.

<doc id="1070521" wikidata="Q1284551" url="?curid=1070521" title="Kay Kyser">
<text>James Kern Kyser (June 18, 1905 – July 23, 1985), known as Kay Kyser, was an American bandleader and radio personality of the 1930s and 1940s.

==Early years==
Kyser was born in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, the son of pharmacists Emily Royster Kyser (née Howell) and Paul Bynum Kyser. He was one of six children, and his mother was the first registered female pharmacist in the state. Journalist and newspaper editor Vermont C. Royster was his cousin. Kyser graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1928, where he was senior class president and was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity.

Owing to his popularity and enthusiasm as a cheerleader, he was invited by Hal Kemp to take over as bandleader when Kemp ventured north to further his career. He began taking clarinet lessons but was better as an entertaining announcer than a musician. He adopted the initial of his middle name as part of his stage name, for its alliterative effect.

==Career==

===Kay Kyser&#x27;s Kollege of Musical Knowledge===
:&quot;See main article, Kay Kyser&#x27;s Kollege of Musical Knowledge.

Long before his national success, Kyser recorded two sessions for Victor in the late 1920s (Camden, New Jersey in November 1928 and Chicago in early 1929). These were issued on Victor&#x27;s V-40000 series devoted to country music and regional dance bands. Following graduation, Kyser and his band, which included Sully Mason on saxophone and arranger George Duning, toured Midwest restaurants and night clubs and gradually built a following.

They were popular at Chicago&#x27;s Blackhawk restaurant, where Kyser came up with an act combining a quiz with music which became &quot;Kay Kyser&#x27;s Kollege of Musical Knowledge.&quot; The act was broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1938 and then moved to NBC Radio from 1939 to 1949. The show rose in the ratings and spawned many imitators. Kyser led the band as &quot;The Ol&#x27; Perfessor&quot;, spouting catchphrases, some with a degree of Southern American English: &quot;That&#x27;s right—you&#x27;re wrong&quot;, &quot;Evenin&#x27; folks, how y&#x27;all?&quot; and &quot;C&#x27;mon, chillun! Le&#x27;s dance!&quot;

===Big band era===
Although Kyser and his orchestra gained fame through the &quot;Kollege of Musical Knowledge,&quot; they were a successful band in their own right. They had 11 number one records, including some of the most popular songs of the late 1930s and early 1940s.

Unlike most other big bands of the era, which centered on only the bandleader, individual members of Kyser&#x27;s band became stars in their own right and would often receive the spotlight. Some of the more popular members included vocalist Harry Babbitt, cornetist Merwyn Bogue (a.k.a. Ish Kabibble), trombonist Bruce King, saxophonist Jack Martin (who sang lead vocal on the number one hit, &quot;Strip Polka&quot;), Ginny Simms (who had her own successful acting and singing career after leaving Kyser&#x27;s band), Sully Mason, Mike Douglas (years before he became a popular TV talk show host) and Georgia Carroll.

Carroll, a blonde fashion model and actress whose best-known role was Betsy Ross in &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;, was dubbed &quot;Gorgeous Georgia Carroll&quot; when she joined the group in 1943. Within a year, she and Kyser married.

Kyser was also known for singing song titles, a device copied by Sammy Kaye and Blue Barron. When the song began, one of the band&#x27;s lead singers (usually Babbitt) sang the title phrase, and then the first verse or two of the song was performed instrumentally before the lyrics resumed. Several of his recordings spawned catch phrases, such as &quot;Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition&quot;.

His group had a major hit with the novelty tune, &quot;Three Little Fishes&quot;. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.

During the Swing Era, Kyser, Hal Kemp and Tal Henry often performed in or near New York City, making possible a reunion of North Carolina musicians. Later, after retirement, Kyser and Henry got together to share music world memories.

Inspired by Rosalind P. Walter, Kyser helped popularize the song &quot;Rosie the Riveter&quot;.

===Movies===
During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Kyser&#x27;s band appeared in several motion pictures, usually as themselves, beginning with the successful &quot;That&#x27;s Right – You&#x27;re Wrong&quot; (1939), &quot;You&#x27;ll Find Out&quot; (1940), &quot;Playmates&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Spy&quot;. Some of the films built a plot around the band. &quot;Around the World&quot; (1943) fictionalized the band&#x27;s international tours of military camps.
In &quot;Carolina Blues&quot; (1944), Kyser has to replace his lead singer (Carroll) who has run off to get married. Caught in a jam, he reluctantly hires the daughter of a powerful defense plant owner, played by Ann Miller. Two of the band&#x27;s best-known performance appearances were in 1943 when they appeared in the wartime films &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; and &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot;. Kyser appeared as a light comedian; he acted with (and was billed above) John Barrymore in Barrymore&#x27;s final film &quot;Playmates&quot; (1941). Kyser is the dupe in a scam where Barrymore pretends to teach him how to act in Shakespearean drama.

Kyser also appeared in a Porky Pig cartoon, &quot;Africa Squeaks&quot; (1940). In the cartoon, he voiced a caricature of himself called &quot;Cake-Icer,&quot; at the request of director Bob Clampett. A caricature (unnamed) of Kyser as the &quot;Lil Perfessor&quot; was seen in the Warner Brothers cartoon Malibu Beach Party.

After the war, Kyser&#x27;s band continued to record hit records, including two featuring Jane Russell as vocalist. &quot;It&#x27;s All Up to You&quot; features vocals by Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore, although Kyser&#x27;s participation in this recording is disputed, record label showing Axel Stordahl as conductor. Kyser had intended to retire following the end of the war, but performance and recording contracts kept him in show business for another half decade.

During this time, Kyser made a cameo appearance in a &quot;Batman&quot; comic book. Kyser was first to introduce the new sonic audio process called the &#x27;sonovox&#x27;, a singing electronic voice triggered by music. The Sonovox would be used by Jingle Companies such as PAMS and JAM Creative Productions, and said jingles would be used in heavy rotation by rock radio stations such as WABC, WMEX, WXYZ, KONO, WKDA, and WHTZ.

===Television===
In 1949 and 1950, &quot;Kay Kyser&#x27;s Kollege of Musical Knowledge&quot; aired on NBC-TV. In addition to Kyser, the TV show featured Ish Kabibble and vocalists Mike Douglas, Sue Bennett and Liza Palmer, plus The Honeydreamers vocal group and the dance team of Diane Sinclair and Ken Spaulding. Ben Grauer was the announcer during the first season. Always the businessman, Kyser reunited his band especially for this series and just as quickly disbanded it when the show ended. After a four-year hiatus, the &quot;Kollege of Musical Knowledge&quot; was revived by Tennessee Ernie Ford, prior to the launching of his own NBC program, &quot;The Ford Show&quot;, which ran from 1956 to 1961.

===Radio (non-musical)===
Kyser and Ginny Simms co-starred in &quot;Niagara to Reno&quot; (described as &quot;an original comedy&quot;) on CBS radio&#x27;s &quot;Silver Theater&quot; April 6, 1941.

==Post-musical career==
After retiring from music, Kyser became involved with his church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist. When he was a child, his mother turned to a Christian Science practitioner for healing while apparently on her deathbed. In 1932, Kay recalled her recovery and turned to a practitioner himself while feeling the need for spiritual guidance; the practitioner encouraged him to continue with music, so he could use his talents to help people relieve tension in their lives. Kyser recalled: &quot;I felt so healed that I quit worrying about it and for the next 18 years I couldn’t think of anything except how to make better records and how to make the music more danceable. ... Underlying that was the unquenchable desire to serve mankind’s needs.&quot; In the 1940s, he began to experience his own health problems, which at times confined him to a wheelchair, and he turned to the religion in earnest; becoming a practitioner himself in 1961, a teacher of Christian Science a few years afterwards, and in 1974 working at the church&#x27;s headquarters in Boston directing its radio and television broadcasting. In the late 70s and early 80s he traveled around as a Christian Science lecturer, and in 1983, he became the church&#x27;s president, a one-year position which he referred to as &quot;honorary&quot;, joking that he hadn&#x27;t &quot;been elected Pope or anything&quot;.

Kyser supported various philanthropic causes after his retirement from music including health care, educational television, and highway safety. Kyser supported the construction of a wing in St. John&#x27;s hospital in Santa Monica, and there is a portrait of him at the entrance of its medical library. He also helped raise $62 million to build more hospitals and train nurses in his home state of North Carolina, lobbied the state legislature, and had his entertainment friends including Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore do a commercial in support of expanding healthcare in the state. Kyser also supported his old school, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, especially the arts, through the Kyser Foundation which gave scholarships to UNC music and drama students; and supported the university&#x27;s theatre, pharmacy school, and its Center for Public Television. He also gave to the North Carolina Symphony Society, the first state symphony orchestra in the country.

In 1962, several members of the Kay Kyser team (including Babbit, Kabibble, and Simms but not Kyser himself) reunited at Capitol Records to record an album of new versions of Kyser&#x27;s greatest hits. Comedian Stan Freberg, one of Capitol&#x27;s regular artists, did an impression of Kay&#x27;s original song introductions.

==Family==
Kyser and Georgia Carroll remained married until his death. They moved back to Kyser&#x27;s home state of North Carolina where they lived in his uncle&#x27;s old house, the oldest house in Chapel Hill, and raised their three daughters – Amanda, Carroll, and Kimberly, who all graduated from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

==Death==

Kyser died of a heart attack in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on July 23, 1985. He was buried at Old Chapel Hill Cemetery in Chapel Hill.

==Legacy==
Kyser was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1990. 

Kyser was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 1999.

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is custodian of a large archive of documents and material about Kyser which was donated by his widow and made available to the public on April 8, 2008.

<text>Not Drowning, Waving (styled as not drowning, waving) were a musical group formed in Melbourne, Australia, in 1983 by David Bridie and John Phillips. Their music combined elements of rock, ambient music and world music; their lyrics dealt with characteristically Australian topics: word-pictures of landscapes and people, the seasons, and some political issues – such as Indonesia&#x27;s invasion of East Timor. The group released six studio albums and two soundtracks until disbanding in 1994, they briefly reformed in 2001, 2003 and 2005–2006. From 2005 to 2007, they issued three compilation albums. Not Drowning, Waving won the ARIA Award for Best Independent Release at the ARIA Music Awards of 1992 for &quot;Proof&quot;, their soundtrack for the 1991 film of the same name. In 1991, Bridie and fellow members of Not Drowning, Waving, formed a side-project, My Friend The Chocolate Cake to play more acoustic-based material.

==History==
===1983–1985: Beginnings and &quot;Another Pond&quot;===
Not Drowning, Waving were formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1983 by David Bridie and John Phillips. Bridie and Phillips are trained in classical music and met when Bridie, on keyboards, was composing a track, &quot;Moving Around&quot; and asked Phillips to provide guitar. Their name is derived from Stevie Smith&#x27;s poem &quot;Not Waving but Drowning&quot;. Rowan McKinnon soon joined on bass guitar and they recorded &quot;Moving Around&quot; with a drum machine. Other atmospheric instrumentals were recorded at the LaTrobe University&#x27;s music department&#x27;s studio. &quot;Moving Around&quot; was released as their debut single in April 1984 on the Rampant Records label. Tim Cole on vocals and Russel Bradley on drums joined the group. &quot;Another Pond&quot; was released in January 1985. In September 1985, the band released a dance single, &quot;Mr Pooh, (Do Be a Don&#x27;t Be)&quot;.

===1986–1992 :&quot;The Little Desert&quot;, &quot;Cold and the Crackle&quot;, &quot;Claim&quot; and &quot;Tabaran&quot;===
Not Drowning, Waving&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Little Desert&quot; was released in January 1986. Bridie and Phillips also worked on the soundtrack for &quot;Canoe Man&quot;, a documentary about canoe makers from Manus Island in Papua New Guinea. Their work resulted in a six-track extended play (EP), &quot;The Sing Sing&quot;, which was released in June. Other members of Not Drowning, Waving have included Penny Hewson and Andrew Carswell.

In June 1987, the band released their third studio album, &quot;Cold and the Crackle&quot; which was followed in December 1987 with an EP, &quot;I Did&quot;, recorded with Robby Douglas Turner on vocals. By 1989, Not Drowning, Waving left Rampant Records and signed with Mighty Boy to issue their fourth album, &quot;Claim&quot; in May. The album was voted &#x27;Best Australian Album&#x27; on the Australian &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Critics Poll in 1989. In 1989, Bradley, Bridie and Mountfort formed a side project, My Friend The Chocolate Cake, as an acoustic music group after Bridie took a holiday in New Zealand and wrote a collection of songs that did not fit into the Not Drowning, Waving style.

Later in 1989, the group visited Papua New Guinea playing several concerts and meeting George Telek (Moab Stringband, Painim Wok) with whom they later recorded two tracks for their next album, &quot;Tabaran&quot; which was released late in 1990. &quot;Tabaran&quot; was credited to Not Drowning, Waving and the Musicians of Rabaul, Papua New Guinea Featuring Telek. Helen Mountfort had joined on cello in 1990, and the group covered The Reels track &quot;Kitchen Man&quot; for a various artists&#x27; album, &quot;Used and Recovered By&quot; (1990). Not Drowning, Waving recorded the soundtrack for 1991 film &quot;Proof&quot; which was released in April 1992.

In May 1992, they were the support act for David Byrne at the State Theatre in Sydney, Australia, playing: &quot;Palau&quot;, &quot;Amidel&quot;, &quot;The Kiap Song&quot;, &quot;Crazy Birds&quot;, &quot;Willow Tree&quot;, &quot;Terra Nullius&quot;, &quot;Albert Namatjira&quot;, &quot;The Migrant&quot;, and &quot;Sing Sing&quot;.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992, &quot;Tabaran&quot; was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Release, while &quot;Proof&quot; won ARIA Award for Best Independent Release.

===1993–1994 :&quot;Circus&quot; and break up===
In 1993, the group released their sixth studio album &quot;Circus&quot;, which was recorded at the Rockfield Studios in Wales and produced by Hugh Jones.

In 1994, they were the support act for Peter Gabriel on his first tour of Australia. Late in the year, Bridie and Montfort recorded the soundtrack for the film &quot;Hammers Over the Anvil&quot;, they used Jen Anderson on violin (ex-The Black Sorrows) and the horn section from Hunters &amp; Collectors. It was released in 1994 as &quot;Hammers&quot; under the name Not Drowning, Waving. The group disbanded in 1994, while Bridie and Mountfort continued with their offshoot venture, My Friend The Chocolate Cake.

===2001–2007: Reunions===
In November 2001, a short reunion of Not Drowning, Waving – consisting of Bradley, Bridie, Mountfort, Phillips and Southall in the line-up – occurred at the Corner Hotel in Richmond for the book launch of &quot;Blunt: A Biased History of Australian Rock&quot;.

In February 2003, they reunited again for The Morning Star Concert for West Papua at the Melbourne Concert Hall.

Another reunion, for several months, started in March 2005 when the band, together with Telek, performed twice at the 2005 WOMADelaide festival. Several other performances followed – at the 10th Fest&#x27;Napuan in Port Vila, Vanuatu; the Corner Hotel; and the Northcote Social Club, Northcote. The band&#x27;s final show with the full lineup took place at Festival Melbourne 2006 in the Alexandra Gardens, a free concert for Melbourne&#x27;s Commonwealth Games celebrations on 25 March 2006. During this time they issued two compilation albums, &quot;Through the One Last Door – Best Of&quot; (2005) and &quot;Maps for Sonic Adventurers&quot; (2006). A live album of performances from 1986 to 2005 was released as &quot;Live (At the Butchers&#x27; Picnic)&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="1070538" wikidata="Q942874" url="?curid=1070538" title="Parahippus">
<text>Parahippus (&quot;near to horse&quot;), is an extinct equid, a relative of modern horses, asses, and zebras. It lived from 24 to 17 million years ago, during the Miocene epoch. It was very similar to &quot;Miohippus&quot;, but slightly larger, at around tall, at the withers. Their fossils have been found in North America, primarily in the Great Plains region and Florida.

== Taxonomy ==
The following fossil species are known:

* P. cognatus (type species) - mid-Miocene (Hemingfordian to Barstovian) of Nebraska (Loup Fork Formation) &amp; South Dakota (Batesland Formation), US
* P. coloradoensis - early-mid Miocene (Arikareean to Barstovian) of South Dakota (Rosebud Formation), Colorado (Pawnee Creek Formation), &amp; Oregon (Butte Creek Formation)
* P. leonensis - early to mid-Miocene (Arikareean to Hemingfordian) of Florida (Torreya Formation), Delaware (Calvert Formation), Texas (Oakville Formation), Colorado (Browns Park Formation), &amp; Oregon (John Day Formation)
* P. pawniensis - early-mid Miocene (Arikareean to Hemingfordian) of Colorado (Pawnee Creek Formation), Wyoming, South Dakota (Rosebud Formation), Nevada, California (Vaqueros Formation) &amp; Oregon (John Day Formation)
The former species &quot;P. tyleri&quot; is now placed in &quot;Desmatippus&quot;.

== Description ==

&quot;Parahippus&quot; was larger than &quot;Miohippus&quot;, with longer legs and face. The bones in the legs were fused and this, along with muscle development, allowed &quot;Parahippus&quot; to move with forward-and-back strides. Flexible leg rotation was eliminated, so that the animal was better adapted to fast forward running on open ground without moving from side to side. Most importantly, &quot;Parahippus&quot; was able to stand on its middle toe, instead of walking on pads, which gave it the ability to run faster; its weight was supported by ligaments under the fetlock to the big central toe.

Since leafy food had become scarce, these animals were forced to subsist on the newly evolved grasses that were by now taking over the plains, and their teeth adapted accordingly. The extra molar crest that was variable in &quot;Miohippus&quot; became permanent in &quot;Parahippus&quot;. The molars developed high crowns and a hard covering for grinding the grass, which was typically covered with high-silica dust and sand.

<doc id="1070543" wikidata="Q966040" url="?curid=1070543" title="The Greater of Two Evils">
<text>The Greater of Two Evils is an album by American heavy metal band Anthrax. It was released in November 2004 via Sanctuary and is the last Anthrax release prior to the band&#x27;s reunion with Joey Belladonna and guitarist Dan Spitz.

The album is made up of 14 songs from the band&#x27;s early era that were first released between 1983 and 1990. These tracks have been re-recorded by Anthrax&#x27;s 2004 lineup, with vocalist John Bush recording new versions of songs originally sung by Neil Turbin and Joey Belladonna. The final track listing was decided by a vote on the band&#x27;s website. The track list was then recorded by the band &quot;live&quot; in the studio over two days. The album was originally going to be named &quot;Metallum Maximum Aeturnum&quot;, with possible plans to change it to &quot;Old School, New School, Our School: Metallum Maximum Aeturnum&quot; or &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad: Metallum Maximum Aeturnum&quot;. The album sleeve features liner notes by comedian and Anthrax fan Brian Posehn.

The album did not chart in the US, selling 3,421 copies in its first week.

==Track listing==
===Bonus disc (Japanese edition)===
The following tracks are available on a 2-disc Japanese version sold in other countries as an import.
==Trivia==
*The Japanese katakana writing on the front cover says: スラッシュ　メタル, literally Surasshu Metaru (a transliteration of &quot;thrash metal&quot;).
*On the original version of the album, &quot;Lone Justice&quot; appears as a hidden track. It begins after &quot;Gung-Ho&quot; ends, and is followed by the sound of &quot;Lone Justice&quot; being rewound. The song was included due to what seemed to be a strong demand for the track to be recorded by the members of the band&#x27;s official message board, although many on the board claimed that the high votes for the song were a result of internet sabotage of the voting process. This addition to the album was not included on the Japanese edition, which featured an additional disc, on which &quot;Lone Justice&quot; was featured as a separate track.
*&quot;Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)&quot; is listed as N.F.L. on the cover of the album.

==Personnel==
*John Bush – lead vocals
*Rob Caggiano – lead guitar, rhythm guitar on &quot;Panic&quot; and &quot;Anthrax&quot;
*Scott Ian – rhythm guitar, backing vocals, lead guitar on &quot;Panic&quot; and &quot;Anthrax&quot;
*Frank Bello – bass, backing vocals
*Charlie Benante – drums

<text>Orohippus (from the Greek , &#x27;mountain&#x27; and , &#x27;horse&#x27;) is an extinct equid that lived in the Eocene (about 50 million years ago).

== Description ==
It is believed to have evolved from equids such as &quot;Eohippus&quot;, as the earliest evidence for &quot;Orohippus&quot; appears about 2 million years after the first appearance of &quot;Eohippus&quot;. The anatomical differences between the two are slight: they were the same size, but &quot;Orohippus&quot; had a slimmer body, a more elongated head, slimmer forelimbs and longer hind legs, all of which are characteristics of a good jumper. Its teeth were brachydont in height, but the development of flattened surfaces and shearing lophs on their molars suggests they were more a browser than a frugivore. The outer toes of &quot;Eohippus&quot; are no longer present in &quot;Orohippus&quot;, hence on each forelimb there were four fingers (toes) and on each hind leg three toes.

Species of &quot;Orohippus&quot; has also been referred to &quot;Protorohippus&quot;.

<text>Kevin Eldon (born 2 October 1959) is an English actor and comedian. He featured in British comedy television shows of the 1990s including &quot;Fist of Fun&quot;, &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, &quot;Big Train&quot;, &quot;Brass Eye&quot; and &quot;Jam&quot;. In 2013, Eldon appeared in his own BBC sketch series &quot;It&#x27;s Kevin&quot;. He has also appeared in minor speaking roles in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Personal life==
Eldon was born in Chatham, Kent. He has been a practising Buddhist since 1990. He has two children with his wife Holly, who he met in late 2005 on the set of &quot;Hyperdrive&quot;, where she was the art director.

==Early career and &#x27;Lee &amp; Herring&#x27;==
Eldon occupies half a page in Oliver Gray&#x27;s book called &quot;Volume – A Cautionary Tale of Rock and Roll Obsession&quot;; this includes coverage of punk-era Hampshire where, in late 1978, with two schoolmates from Bay House School, Gosport, Eldon started a band named Virginia Doesn&#x27;t. Virginia Doesn&#x27;t&#x27;s career peaked with a session broadcast on Radio One&#x27;s John Peel Show on 18 October 1979. In early 1980, Virginia Doesn&#x27;t morphed into The Time, in which Eldon was again the front man. The Time recorded and performed from April 1980 until August 1982, during which time the band gigged extensively and played support slots with The Jam, Joe Jackson&#x27;s Jumpin&#x27; Jive and Bad Manners. The Time had songs included on several self-released tape compilations, although they never secured a recording contract. In August 1982, The Time became Gerry Hackett &amp; The Fringes, a spoof Sixties revival band. On 6 November 1983 Gerry Hackett &amp; The Fringes appeared on BBC South&#x27;s &#x27;The Cellar Show&#x27; presented by John Sessions. Eldon started on the stand-up circuit in the early 1990s performing an act in-character as the political poet Paul Hamilton, but has also, on occasion, done stand-up as himself.

On the circuit, Eldon formed a friendship with stand-up comedian Stewart Lee, which would later lead to an invitation to work with him on the radio series &quot;Lee &amp; Herring&#x27;s Fist of Fun&quot; with Lee&#x27;s comedy partner Richard Herring. Lee and Herring would usually refer to him as &quot;the actor Kevin Eldon&quot;, in reference to his claim to being an actor rather than a comedian. Eldon&#x27;s work sat well with that of Lee and Herring, and he continued to work with them on many of their projects, including &quot;The Lee &amp; Herring Radio Show&quot;, &quot;Fist of Fun&quot; and &quot;This Morning with Richard Not Judy&quot;. He played recurring characters Simon Quinlank (the self-styled &quot;King of Hobbies&quot;) and &#x27;Rod Hull&#x27;, a nonsensical version of Rod Hull with a prosthetic limb and an obsession with jelly, especially the &#x27;green&#x27; variety. In 1994 and 1997, he appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival as part the comedy troupe Cluub Zarathustra; other comedians in the troupe including Roger Mann, Johnny Vegas, Simon Munnery, and later Stewart Lee. They were given a Channel 4 pilot, which led to the television series &quot;Attention Scum!&quot; The book &quot;You Are Nothing&quot; by Robert Wringham praises the performers&#x27; talent. From March 2009, Eldon appeared in &quot;Stewart Lee&#x27;s Comedy Vehicle&quot; in a number of the show&#x27;s sketches most often with Paul Putner.

==Stage and screen==

Eldon has appeared in many British comedy shows from the 1990s onwards. One of his first appearances on television was in 1995 in &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot; as Fanny Thomas, a foul-mouthed transvestite chef and then later appeared on &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; as the laughing racist, Mike Samson.

During the 1990s, he worked with such comedians as Simon Pegg, Mark Heap, Julia Davis, Amelia Bullmore and others in the sketch-comedy series &quot;Big Train&quot;. One of Eldon&#x27;s more notable characters for &quot;Big Train&quot;, George Martin, was inspired by his impression of the Beatles producer. He had previously worked with some of the cast in the satirical series &quot;Brass Eye&quot;, and the dark comedy &quot;Jam&quot;, both written by Christopher Morris. Eldon would later act in &quot;Nathan Barley&quot; and the 2010 film &quot;Four Lions&quot; as a police sniper (also written by Christopher Morris). In 2004, Eldon appeared in the BAFTA award-winning dark comedy &quot;Nighty Night&quot; as Terry Tyrrell, husband to Julia Davis&#x27; character. They also appeared later in &quot;Hunderby&quot; (another dark comedy written by Julia Davis), &quot;Little Crackers&quot; and &quot;Psychobitches&quot;. He worked again with Pegg in an episode in the sitcom &quot;Spaced&quot; with Mark Gatiss, both of whom played two Matrix-style government agents, and in the comedy film &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; where he played Sergeant Tony Fisher.

Eldon has appeared on stage and screen numerous times with the comedian Bill Bailey; they performed as a spoof of the German band Kraftwerk, singing German versions of the &quot;Hokey Cokey&quot; and The Wurzels song &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot; for the recorded version of Bill Bailey&#x27;s &quot;Part Troll&quot; comedy tour, along with two others (John Moloney and Martin Trenaman). He played the same role in Bailey&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Tinselworm&quot; tour, &quot;Channel 4&#x27;s Comedy Gala&quot; in 2010, and Bailey&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Dandelion Mind&quot; tour. 

In late 2006, Eldon, alongside Bill Bailey, helped to organise and produce a short tour and a West End run of &quot;Pinter&#x27;s People&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre, London. The show was a collection of sketches written by Harold Pinter, also starring Geraldine McNulty and Sally Phillips. They appeared together again when Eldon was a panellist on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; in 2007 (with Bailey as team captain), as well as on the &#x27;Dave&#x27; show &quot;Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled&quot;. They also acted together in the sitcom &quot;Black Books&quot; &#x27;Grapes of Wrath&#x27; episode, where Eldon played &quot;The Cleaner&quot;. Eldon has also had minor guest starring roles in numerous comedy projects, including &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;, &quot;Green Wing&quot;, &quot;The IT Crowd&quot; and &quot;The Kennedys&quot;.

In February 2010, Eldon appeared in the pilot for a &quot;sort-of-sketch-show&quot; called &quot;Missing Scene&quot;. In 2011 he appeared in sketches throughout &quot;How TV Ruined Your Life&quot;, and with Paul Whitehouse, as one of a pair of women 1950s typists in season four of &quot;Harry and Paul&quot;. In October 2013, Eldon read his own short story &quot;What do you say?&quot; on the storytelling series &quot;Crackanory&quot;, an adult-oriented remake of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Jackanory&quot;.

In 2013, Eldon was given a six-part sketch comedy series called &quot;It&#x27;s Kevin&quot;, broadcast on BBC Two. The show had many guest stars, mostly comedians that Eldon had already worked with before. Every episode ended with a song, including: &quot;Mobile Phone&quot;, sung by the mock Swiss pop duo Popsox played by Eldon and Bill Bailey; &quot;Brad&quot;, where the bully character Brad was played by Peter Serafinowicz; and &quot;Pension Rap&quot;. Regular characters included the obnoxious poet Paul Hamilton; Stanley Duthorpe, the fictional man from the North of England; and an offensive French musician. These characters also appeared in Eldon&#x27;s stand-up DVD &quot;Kevin Eldon is Titting About.&quot; Eldon also wrote a spoof biography on Paul Hamilton called &quot;My Prefect Cousin: A Short Biography of Paul Hamilton&quot; in 2013 where he pretends that Hamilton is his own cousin. &quot;Big Train&quot; writer Arthur Matthews was one of the guest writers for the show.

In October 2008, he played the part of pessimistic, unpopular &quot;Big Brother&quot; housemate Joplin in Charlie Brooker&#x27;s five-part E4 horror thriller, &quot;Dead Set&quot;. He has also appeared in several minor serious roles in British drama shows such as &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;Utopia&quot;, &quot;Merlin&quot;, &quot;Skins&quot;, &quot;New Tricks&quot; and &quot;Hustle&quot;. In 2016, he appears in the 6th season of the American fantasy drama series, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; along with Richard E. Grant as part of a theatre troupe, with Eldon&#x27;s character portraying a version of Ned Stark. Uncredited appearances include the 2005 film version of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, playing &quot;Man with Dog&quot; alongside Mark Heap and the 2014 film &quot;Cuban Fury&quot;, as the neighbour to the main character played by Nick Frost. He has also played an English policeman in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Hugo&quot;. Eldon played the role of Pete in the David Shrigley/Chris Shepherd animation, &quot;Who I Am And What I Want&quot;, and also of Mick McManus in Tim Plester&#x27;s short film &quot;World of Wrestling&quot; in 2007. In 2009, he played the lead role of Arthur in &quot;Radio Mania: An Abandoned Work&quot;, a stereoscopic 3D film for the BFI, directed by British artists Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard.,

Eldon co-authored the theme tune, and is script editor for, the children&#x27;s series &quot;Genie in the House&quot;. He provided the voice of Penfold in the 2015 revival series of &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;. He also appeared in the 2015 series of the children&#x27;s comedy sketch show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; as William the Conqueror - performing a parody version of Korean popstar PSY&#x27;s hit, &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; called &quot;Norman Style&quot;. He has also been a contestant on the gameshow &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; and was winner in a 2014 episode of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, where his specialist subject was &quot;The Music of The Beatles&quot;.

Eldon voiced the character of Frobisher in the 2012 PlayStation Vita game &quot;Frobisher Says&quot;, and provided voice work for the 2013 indie game &quot;Gun Monkeys&quot; by Size Five Games.

Red Dwarf season XI episode 1, Twentica, which was broadcast in 2016 features Kevin Eldon in the role &quot;4 of 27&quot;.

In 2019, he played Lance Corporal Jones in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army: The Lost Episodes&quot;, a recreation of three missing episodes of the BBC comedy &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;.

He also starred as the great dwarf smith Narvi in The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power season 2 TV series, which first aired on HBO in 2024.

From 1997 to 1999, Eldon appeared in BBC Radio 1 show, &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, which was later adapted into the TV series &quot;Jam&quot;.

In 2001, Eldon appeared in the non-canon &quot;Doctor Who&quot; four-part webcast series &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;, in which he played Antimony, a companion to the Seventh Doctor.

In 2008, Eldon presented &quot;Poets&#x27; Tree&quot;, a four-part &quot;poetry type programme&quot; for BBC Radio 4, in the character of Paul Hamilton, which was co-written and edited by Stewart Lee.

<text>In team sports, the term home advantage – also called home ground, home field, home-field advantage, home court, home-court advantage, defender&#x27;s advantage or home-ice advantage – describes the benefit that the home team is said to gain over the visiting team. This benefit has been attributed to psychological effects supporting fans have on the competitors or referees; to psychological or physiological advantages of playing near home in familiar situations; to the disadvantages away teams suffer from changing time zones or climates, or from the rigors of travel; and in some sports, to specific rules that favor the home team directly or indirectly. In baseball and cricket in particular, the difference may also be the result of the home team having been assembled to take advantage of the idiosyncrasies of the home ballpark/ground, such as the distances to the outfield walls/boundaries; most other sports are played in standardized venues.

The term is also widely used in &quot;best-of&quot; playoff formats (e.g., best-of-seven) as being given to the team that is scheduled to play one more game at home than their opponent if all necessary games are played.

In many sports, such designations may also apply to games played at a neutral site, as the rules of various sports make different provisions for home and visiting teams. In baseball, for instance, the visiting team always bats first in each inning. Therefore, one team must be chosen to be the &quot;visitor&quot; when games are played at neither team&#x27;s home field. Likewise, there are uncommon instances in which a team playing a game at their home venue is officially the visiting team, and their opponent officially the home team, such as when a game originally scheduled to play at one venue must be postponed and is later resumed at the other team&#x27;s venue.

==Advantages==
In most team sports, the home or hosting team is considered to have a significant advantage over the away or visiting team. Due to this, many important games (such as playoff or elimination matches) in many sports have special rules for determining what match is played where. In association football, matches with two legs, one game played in each team&#x27;s &quot;home&quot;, are common, with the team hosting the second leg having this home-field advantage. It is also common to hold important games, such as the Super Bowl, at a neutral site in which the location is determined years in advance. In many team sports in North America (including baseball, basketball, and ice hockey), playoff series are often held with a nearly equal number of games at each team&#x27;s site. However, as it is usually beneficial to have an odd number of matches in a series (to prevent ties), the final home game is often awarded to the team that had more success over the regular season.

An example is UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Europa Conference League home and away legs, with weaker teams often beating the favorites when playing at home. The World Cup victories of Uruguay (1930), Italy (1934), England (1966), Germany (1974), Argentina (1978) and France (1998) are all in part attributed to the fact that the World Cup was held in the winner&#x27;s country. A 2006 study by &quot;The Times&quot; found that in the English Premiership, a home team can be expected to score 37.29% more goals than the away team, though this changes depending on the quality of the teams involved. Others have suggested that the increase in British medals during the 2012 Olympics may have been impacted by home court advantage. (However, having home court did not help Canada at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, the only Summer Games at which the hosting country failed to win a single gold medal.)

The strength of the home advantage varies for different sports, regions, seasons, and divisions. For all sports, it seems to be strongest in the early period after the creation of a new league. The effect seems to have become somewhat weaker in some sports in recent decades.

Adams &amp; Kupper (1994) described home-field advantage as an expertise deficiency. They demonstrated that, in theory and in practice, home-field advantage decreases as superiority of performance increases. They also showed that home-field advantage is not applicable for no-hit major league baseball games for pitchers who either replicated performance by winning two or more no-hitters or amassed a large number of career wins. Their general finding was that home-field advantage is a metric for the inability to maintain performance independent of environment and that this metric is inversely related to variables of expertise.

In recognition of the difficulty in winning away matches, cup competitions in association football often invoke the away goals rule. Away goals can also sometimes be used to separate teams level on points and goal difference in league competitions.

===Causes===
====Factors related to the location and the venue====
There are many causes that attribute to home advantage, such as crowd involvement (for instance a 2024 study on ice hockey results during COVID-19, where no spectators were allowed at matches), travel considerations, and environmental factors. The most commonly cited factors of home advantage are usually factors which are difficult to measure and so even their existence is debated. Most of these are psychological in nature: the home teams are familiar with the playing venue; they can lodge in their homes, rather than in a hotel, and so have less far to travel before the game; and they have the psychological support of the home fans.

Other factors, however, are easier to detect and can have noticeable effects on the outcome of the game. In American football, for instance, the crowd often makes as much noise as it can when the visiting team is about to run a play. That can make it very difficult for the visiting team&#x27;s quarterback to call audible play changes, or for any player to hear the snap count. In contrast, the crowd is often quiet while the home team is on offense, and that enables the quarterback to use the hard count intended to draw the defense offsides as the defense can hear the hard count. In basketball, when a visiting player is making a free throw, home fans behind the backboard typically wave their arms or other objects in an attempt to break the visiting player&#x27;s focus on making the shot. Environmental factors such as weather and altitude are easy to measure, yet their effects are debatable. Both teams have to play in the same conditions, but the home team may be more acclimated to local conditions with difficult environments, including extreme temperatures high altitude (such as the case of Denver teams, as well as the Mexico national football team, many of whose home matches are played in Mexico City).

The stadium or arena will typically be filled with home supporters, who are sometimes described as being as valuable as an extra player for the home team. The home fans can sometimes create a psychological lift by cheering loudly for their team when good things happen in the game. The home crowd can also intimidate visiting players by booing, whistling, or heckling. Generally the home fans vastly outnumber the visiting team&#x27;s supporters. While some visiting fans may travel to attend the game, home team fans will generally have better access to tickets and easier transport to the event, thus in most cases they outnumber the visitors&#x27; fans (although in local derbies and crosstown rivalries this may not always be the case). In some sports, such as association football, sections of the stadium will be reserved for supporters of one team or the other (to prevent fan violence) but the home team&#x27;s fans will have the bulk of the seating available to them. In addition, stadium/arena light shows, sound effects, fireworks, cheerleaders, and other means to enliven the crowd will be in support of the home team. Stadium announcers in many sports will emphasize the home team&#x27;s goals and lineup to excite the crowd.

Ryan Boyko, a research assistant in the Department of Psychology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, studied 5,000 English Premier League games from 1992 to 2006, to discern any officiating bias and the influence of home crowds. The data was published in the &quot;Journal of Sports Sciences&quot; and suggested that for every additional 10,000 people attending, home team advantage increased by 0.1 goals. Additionally, his study found that home teams are likely to be awarded more penalty kicks, and this is more likely with inexperienced referees.

Further, home players can be accustomed to peculiar environmental conditions of their home area. The city of Denver, being above sea level, has thinner air, enough so that it affects the stamina of athletes whose bodies are not used to it. Although baseball is less aerobically demanding than many other sports, high altitude affects that sport&#x27;s game play in several important ways. Denver&#x27;s combination of altitude and a semi-arid climate (the city averages only about 16 in/400 mm precipitation annually) allows fly balls to travel about 10% farther than at sea level, and also slightly reduces the ability of a pitcher to throw an effective breaking ball. The low humidity also causes baseballs to dry out, making it harder for pitchers to grip them and further reducing their ability to throw breaking balls. The Colorado Rockies have a very large home advantage. This anomaly has been countered with Colorado&#x27;s innovative use of humidors to keep the baseballs from drying out. Denver&#x27;s altitude advantage has also come into play in gridiron football; the second longest field goal in National Football League history took place in Denver, as did the longest recorded punt. The national association football team of Bolivia also enjoys the advantage of playing at high altitude: at home during World Cup qualifiers at the even more extreme 3,600 m (11,800 ft) altitude of La Paz they have even been known to beat Brazil, a team regularly ranked number one in the FIFA World Rankings. More recently, Bolivia beat Argentina, who were ranked sixth in the world, 6–1 on April 1, 2009, Argentina&#x27;s heaviest defeat since 1958. In cricket, the condition of the pitch and the behaviour of the ball when it bounces off the pitch varies significantly in different parts of the world, and consequently the players on the visiting team must adjust to the ball behaving in an unfamiliar way to be successful on foreign surfaces; additionally, the home team has the right to adjust the preparation of its pitches in a manner which specifically enhances its own strengths or exacerbates its opponent&#x27;s weaknesses.

The weather can also play a major factor. For example, the February average temperature minimum in Tel Aviv, Israel is , while the average at the same time in Kazan, Russia is , with snow being common. This means that when Rubin Kazan played at home to Hapoel Tel Aviv in the 2009-10 UEFA Europa League, Hapoel needed to acclimatize and were therefore at a disadvantage. Hapoel duly lost the match 3–0. This advantage, however, can also be a disadvantage to the home team, as weather conditions can impede the home team as much as the visitors: the Buffalo Bills, whose home stadium (Highmark Stadium) is subject to high and unpredictable winds and lake-effect snow in the late fall and early winter, regularly suffer large numbers of injuries late in the season.

Sometimes the unique attributes of a stadium create a home-field advantage. The unique off-white Teflon-coated roof of the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome trapped and reflected noise to such an extent that it was distracting or even harmful. This, combined with the color of the roof, caused opposing baseball players to commit more errors in the Dome than in other ballparks. While this is no longer an issue for opponents of the Minnesota Twins with that team&#x27;s 2010 move to the open-air Target Field, it remained important to the many college baseball teams that played games in the Dome until its late 2013 closing. Hard Rock Stadium, the home stadium of the NFL&#x27;s Miami Dolphins, is designed in such a way that when the sun is overhead, the home sideline is in the shade while the visitors sideline is directly in the sun&#x27;s path. This, combined with the hot tropical climate South Florida receives, can lead to differences of up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit or more between the two sidelines, with the visiting sideline temperature getting as high as 120 °F (49 °C). The parquet floor at the Boston Celtics&#x27; former home of Boston Garden contained many defects, which were said to give the Celtics, who were more likely to be familiar with the playing surface, an advantage. During the 1985–1986 season, the Larry Bird-led Celtics posted a home court record of 40–1; this record still stands in the NBA. Memorial Gymnasium, the venue for men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball at Vanderbilt University, was built in 1952 with the team benches at the ends of the court instead of along one of the sidelines, a setup that was not unusual at the time. However, the configuration is now unique in U.S. major-college sports, and has been said to give the Commodores an edge because opposing coaches are not used to directing their teams from the baseline. Cherry Hill Arena, a New Jersey–based arena in the southern suburbs of Philadelphia, had a number of idiosyncrasies that its home teams used to their advantage but earned the arena an extremely poor reputation, including a slanted ice surface that forced opponents to skate the majority of the game uphill and lack of showers for the visiting team.

&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, in a 17 January 2011 article, reported that home crowds, rigor of travel for visiting teams, scheduling, and unique home field characteristics, &quot;were not&quot; factors in giving home teams an advantage. The journal concluded that it was favorable treatment by game officials and referees that conferred advantages on home teams. They stated that sports officials are unwittingly and psychologically influenced by home crowds and the influence is significant enough to affect the outcomes of sporting events in favor of the home team.

Other research has found that crowd support, travel fatigue, geographical distance, pitch familiarity, and referee bias do not have a strong effect when each factor is considered alone suggesting that it is the combination of several different factors that creates the overall home advantage effect. An evolutionary psychology explanation for the home advantage effect refers to observed behavioral and physiological responses in animals when they are defending their home territory against intruders. This causes a rise in aggression and testosterone levels in the defenders. A similar effect has been observed in football with testosterone levels being significantly higher in home games than in away games. Goalkeepers, the last line of defense, have particularly strong testosterone changes when playing against a bitter rival as compared to a training season. How testosterone may influence results is unclear but may include cognitive effects such as motivation and physiological effects such as reaction time.

An extreme example of home advantage was the 2013 Nigeria Premier League; each of the 20 teams lost at most 3 of 19 home matches and won at most 3 of 19 away matches. Paul Doyle ascribed this to visiting teams&#x27; facing &quot;violent crowds, questionable refereeing and [...] [a]rriving just before kick-off after long road trips, often on hazardous surfaces&quot;.

The 2020–21 NHL season saw major disruption due to COVID-19-restricted conditions that resulted in bubble playoffs and ghost games, as fans were unable to attend in person. New research has shown that this led to a significant drop to home advantage compared with the previous six seasons. In 592 games played under the restricted conditions through March, home teams suffered a decline of 10% while road teams’ win rates increased by 7%.

====Factors related to the game rules====
In a number of sports, the hosting team has the advantage of playing with their first choice uniforms, while the visiting team wears their alternative away/road colors. Some sports leagues simply state that the team wears its away uniforms only when its primary jerseys would clash with the colors of the home team, while other leagues mandate that visiting teams must always wear their away colors regardless. However, sometimes teams wear their alternative uniforms by choice. This is especially true in North American sports where generally one uniform is white or grey, and &quot;Color vs. color&quot; games (e.g., blue vs. red uniforms) are a rarity, having been discouraged in the era of black-and-white television. Many teams from warm-weather cities may wear their white uniforms at home, forcing their opponent to wear dark uniforms in the hot weather. An exception is a rule in high school American football (except Texas, which plays by NCAA football rules), requiring the home team to wear dark jerseys and the visiting team to wear white jerseys, which may work as a disadvantage to the home team in hot-weather games.

In ice hockey, there are at least three distinct rule-related advantages for the home team. The first is referred to as &quot;last change&quot;, where during stoppages of play, the home team is allowed to make player substitutions after the visiting team does (unless the home team ices the puck, in which case no substitutions are allowed). This allows the home team to obtain favorable player matchups. This rule makes the home team designation important even in games played on neutral ice. Traditionally, the second advantage was that when lining up for the face-off, the away team&#x27;s centre always had to place his stick on the ice before the centre of the home team. However, in both the NHL and international rule sets, this now applies only for face-offs at the centre-ice spot; when a face-off takes place anywhere else on the ice, the defending centre has to place his stick first. The centre who is allowed to place his stick last gains the ability to time the face-off better and gives him greater odds of winning it. The third advantage is that the home team has the benefit of choosing whether to take the first or second attempt in a shootout.

In baseball, the home team – which bats in the bottom half of each inning – enjoys the advantage of being able to end the game immediately if it has the lead in the ninth inning (or other scheduled final inning) or in extra innings. If the home team is leading at the end of the top half of the ninth inning, the game ends without the bottom half being played. If the home team is trailing or the score is tied in the bottom half of the ninth inning or any extra inning, the game ends immediately if the home team takes the lead; the visiting team does not get another opportunity to score and the home team does not have to protect their lead. On the other hand, if the visiting team has the lead when the top half of the ninth inning or extra inning ends, the home team still gets an opportunity to score and so the visiting team must protect their lead. In addition, in the late innings, the home team knows how many runs they need to win or tie, and can therefore strategize accordingly. For example, in a tie game in the ninth inning or extra innings, the home team may employ strategies such as bunting or stealing bases, which oftentimes increase the chance of scoring one run, but decrease the chance of scoring multiple runs.

Additionally in baseball, the host team is familiar with the unique dimensions of their home field yielding them advantages (pitching, hitting, fielding) over visiting teams. Before the Major League Baseball labor agreement that ended the 2021–22 lockout saw the designated hitter added permanently in the National League, the home league&#x27;s rules concerning the designated hitter (DH) were followed during interleague games, including the World Series. This put AL teams at a disadvantage when they played in NL parks, as AL pitchers were typically not used to batting nor baserunning. NL teams at AL parks were at a disadvantage because a player who did not play often had to bat an entire game, usually on consecutive nights. The NL team&#x27;s DH was a pinch-hitter who batted perhaps once every two or three games during the season, or alternated in a platoon system with other players (such as a catcher who does not start because the starting pitcher uses the other catcher), while the AL team&#x27;s DH batted three or more times a game throughout the season.

=== Measuring and comparing of home-field advantage ===
Measuring the home-field advantage of a team (in a league with balanced schedule) requires a determination of the number of opponents for which the result at home-field was better (formula_1), same (formula_2), and worse (formula_3). Goals scored and conceded – in so called &quot;combined measure of home team advantage&quot; – are used to determine which results are better, same, and which are worse. Given two results between teams formula_4 and formula_5, formula_6 played at formula_4&#x27;s field and formula_8played at formula_5&#x27;s field, we can compute differences in scores (e.g. from formula_4&#x27;s point of view): formula_11and formula_12. Team formula_4 played better at home field if formula_14, and formula_4 played better at away field if formula_16 (for example, if Arsenal won 3–1 at home against Chelsea, i.e. formula_17, and Arsenal won 3–0 at Chelsea, i.e. formula_18, then the result for Arsenal at home was worse). Same approach has to be used for all opponents in one season to obtain formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3.

Values of formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 are used to estimate probabilities as formula_25, where formula_26 is total number of opponents in a league (this is Bayesian estimator). To test hypothesis that home-field advantage is statistically significant we can compute formula_27, where formula_28 is incomplete gamma function. For example, Newcastle in 2015/2016 English Premier League season recorded better result at home field for 13 opponents, same result with 4 opponents, and worse result for two opponents; therefore formula_29 and hypothesis about home team advantage can be accepted. This procedure was introduced and applied by Marek and Vávra (2017) on English Premier League seasons 1992/1993 – 2015/2016. Later, the procedure was finalised in Marek and Vávra (2020).

Marek and Vávra (2018) described procedure which allows to use observed counts of combined measure of home team advantage (formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3) in two leagues to be compared by the &quot;test for homogeneity of parallel samples&quot; (for the test see Rao (2002)). The second proposed approach is based on distance between estimated probability description of home team advantage in two leagues ( formula_33) which can be measured by Jeffrey divergence (a symmetric version of Kullback–Leibler divergence). They tested five top level English football leagues and two top level Spanish leagues between 2007/2008 and 2016/2017 season. The main result is that home team advantage in Spain is stronger. Spanish La Liga has the strongest home team advantage, and English football league two has the lowest home team advantage, among analysed leagues.

Comparison of home advantage in 19 European football leagues between the 2007/2008 and 2016/2017 seasons was made in Marek and Vávra (2024). They found that, among the analysed leagues, the Super League Greece had the strongest home advantage and English Football League Two had the lowest home advantage.

==Gaining or losing home-field advantage==
During the regular season for a sport, in the interest of fairness, schedulers try to ensure that each team plays an equal number of home and away games. Thus, having home-field advantage for any particular regular-season game is largely due to random chance. (This is only true for fully organized leagues with structured schedules; for a counterexample, college football schedules often have an imbalance in which the most successful and largest teams can negotiate more home appearances than mid-majors, a situation that was also prevalent in the early, disorganized years of the National Football League.)

However, in the playoffs, home advantage is usually given to the team with the higher seed (which may or may not have the better record), as is the case in the NFL, MLB, and Stanley Cup playoffs. One exception to this was MLB&#x27;s World Series, which from 2003 to 2016, awarded home-field advantage to the team representing the league which won the All-Star Game that year, to help raise interest in the All-Star Game after a tie in 2002; before 2003, home-field advantage alternated each year between the National League and the American League. Starting in 2017, home-field advantage in the World Series is nowadays given to the team with the best regular season record. Home-ice advantage in the Stanley Cup Finals is given to the team with the best season record. The NBA is the only league that has home-court advantage based solely on which team has the best record (using various tiebreakers to settle the question should the teams finish with identical records).

For most championship series, such as the NBA Finals, the team with the better regular season record, regardless of seed, has home-court advantage.

Rugby union&#x27;s European Rugby Champions Cup also uses a seeding system to determine home advantage in the quarterfinals (though not in the semifinals, where the nominal &quot;home&quot; teams are determined by a blind draw).

In many sports, playoffs consist of a &#x27;series&#x27; of games played between two teams. These series are usually a best-of-5 or best-of-7 format, where the first team to win 3 or 4 games, respectively, wins the playoff. Since these best-of series always involve an odd number of games, it is impossible to guarantee that an equal number of games will be played at each team&#x27;s home venue. As a result, the team with the better regular season record must be scheduled to have one more home game than the other. This team is said to have home-field advantage for that playoff series.

During the course of these playoff series, however, sports announcers or columnists will sometimes mention a team &quot;gaining&quot; or &quot;losing&quot; home-field advantage. This can happen after a visiting team has just won a game in the series. In playoff series format, the home-field advantage is said to exist for whichever team would win the series &quot;if&quot; all remaining games in the series are won by the home team &quot;for that game&quot;. Therefore, it is possible for a visiting team to win a game and, hence, gain home-field advantage. This is somewhat similar to the concept of losing serve in tennis.

As an example, in the 1982 NBA Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers played the Philadelphia 76ers, with the 76ers having earned home court advantage because of a better regular season record. Four games were scheduled to be played in Philadelphia, while three were scheduled in Los Angeles. If the home team were to win each game, then the 76ers would have won four games, the Lakers would have won three games, and the 76ers would have won the series, so we say that Philadelphia had the home-court advantage. However, the visiting Lakers won Game 1. Los Angeles now had one win, and there were three games remaining at each arena. The home team went on to win all of the remaining games in that series, so Los Angeles won four games, while Philadelphia won two (Game 7, which would have been played in Philadelphia, was omitted, as even if the 76ers won, they&#x27;d still lose the series 4–3). Since the Lakers won the series in this scenario, it is said that they have taken home-court advantage away from the 76ers.

In some cup competitions, (for example the FA Cup in all rounds prior to the semi-final), home advantage is determined by a random drawing. However, if the initial match is drawn (tied), home advantage for the replay is given to the other team.

==Neutral venues==
For certain sporting events, home advantage may be removed by use of a neutral venue. This may be a national stadium that is not a home stadium to any club (for example Wembley Stadium hosts the FA Cup Final and semi-finals). Alternatively the neutral venue may be the home stadium of another club, such as was used historically to stage FA Cup semi-finals.

If the venue is chosen before the start of the competition however, it is still possible for one team to gain home field advantage. For example, in the European Cup/UEFA Champions League, there have been four instances where a club has managed to reach the final hosted in its own stadium (1957, 1965, 1984, and 2012). Most recently Bayern Munich played (and lost) the 2012 final at their home stadium of Allianz Arena, as it was chosen as the venue in January 2010. In the Champions League Final, however, if the &quot;home&quot; shirt colors of both teams conflict (e.g. both are red) then there is a draw which assigns one of the teams their &quot;away&quot; shirt. The NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl is also played in a venue chosen years in advance of the game. Super Bowl LV in 2021 was the first Super Bowl in which one of the participating teams was playing in its home stadium, as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. The next year saw the Los Angeles Rams play Super Bowl LVI at their home of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Both games were awarded to their respective locations in 2017. Two other Super Bowls (XIV in 1980 and XIX in 1985) were played in neutral stadiums in the market area of one of the participating teams. Regardless, tickets are allocated equally between both competing teams, even if one happens to be playing in its own stadium.

Neutral-venue matches may arise out of necessity. For example, on December 12, 2010, the roof of the Minnesota Vikings&#x27; stadium, the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome collapsed due to a snowstorm. The Vikings were supposed to play against the New York Giants at the stadium the next day. The game was moved to the Detroit Lions&#x27; stadium, Ford Field. The following week, the Vikings&#x27; &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Chicago Bears was moved to the University of Minnesota&#x27;s TCF Bank Stadium.

As part of a settlement for a 1992 strike by the NHL Players Association, the National Hockey League scheduled two neutral-site games for each team in a non-NHL market, with one as designated home team and one as the designated away team. The neutral site games ended after the 1993–94 NHL season, as the following season was lockout-shortened, and the 1995–96 NHL season reduced the regular season from 84 to 82 games per team. The NHL has held neutral-site, season-opening games in Europe (sometimes also including preseason exhibitions against European clubs), first from 2007 to 2011 as the &quot;NHL Premiere&quot;, and from 2017 as the &quot;NHL Global Series&quot;. The 2019 NHL Heritage Classic was also a neutral site game, played in the non-NHL market of Regina, Saskatchewan—falling roughly halfway between the markets of the participating teams, the Calgary Flames and Winnipeg Jets.

A requirement to play home matches at a neutral venue has been used as a punishment by UEFA for teams whose fans cause disturbances at a previous match. For example, after the violent clashes after the Turkey-Switzerland game in 2005, UEFA punished the Turkish team with playing the next six regular international home matches abroad. It is also required where one team&#x27;s home location is in a war zone or at high risk of terrorism, or if the visiting team is prevented from travelling to (one of) their opponent&#x27;s regular stadium(s) for political reasons. The latter consideration is uncommon because governing bodies typically implement measures to prevent national teams from jurisdictions with the most serious political disputes (for example, Spain and Gibraltar or Serbia and Kosovo) from being drawn in the same group, but it does happen - for example, the Ukraine–Kosovo qualifier game for the 2018 World Championships was held in Krakow, Poland, because Ukraine does not recognize Kosovo and does not admit Kosovar nationals to its territory. In all such cases, the match is still treated as a &quot;home&quot; match for such purposes as implementing the away goals rule.

In North America, Major League Soccer formerly hosted its MLS Cup final at a neutral site. Since 2012, the game has been held at the venue of the participating team that had the better regular season record.

==By competition==

===Baseball===
In the 2018 Major League Baseball regular season, the home team won 1,277 games (52.6%), and the away team won 1,149 games (47.4%). These totals do not include the six games played at neutral sites (though all of the neutral-site games had a designated &quot;home&quot; team).

* The team with the best overall record, the Boston Red Sox, finished 108–54, going 57–24 at home and 51–30 away. Of their wins, 52.8% were at home, and 55.6% of their losses were on the road.
* The team with the worst record, the Baltimore Orioles, went 47–115 (28–53 at home, 19–62 away). Of their total wins, 59.6% were at home, and 53.9% of their losses were away.
* The largest differential between home and road records was that of the Philadelphia Phillies, going 48–32 at home, 31–50 away, and winning their only neutral-site game as the designated home team. Exactly 60% of their wins were in their home park, and 61.0% of their losses were on the road.
* An especially anomalous home/away split was that of the Houston Astros, whose 103–59 record was second-best in MLB. They were 11 games better on the road than at home (46–35 home, 57–24 away). Of their wins, 44.6% were at home, while 40.7% of their losses were away.
* The 2019 World Series is the first 7-game series in the history of major North American sports where all seven games were won by the road team. Ironically, both finalists, the Washington Nationals and the Houston Astros, had been stronger at home than on the road in both the regular season and playoffs, until the World Series. The 2023 ALCS was the second 7-game Major League Baseball series where all seven games were won by the road team.

===Basketball===
In the 2018–19 NBA regular season, the home team won 729 games (59%), and the away team won 501 games (41%).

* The team with the best overall record, the Milwaukee Bucks, finished 60–22, going 33–8 at home and 27–14 away. In all, 55% of their wins were at home, and 64% of their losses were on the road.
* The Denver Nuggets had the best home record, going 34–7 at home, but went 20–21 away. This meant that 63% of their wins were at home, and 75% of their losses were away.
* The only teams with a better record on the road than at home were the Chicago Bulls and the Miami Heat, going 9–32 and 19–22 at home and 13–28 and 20–21 on the road, respectively.

===Cricket===
Across the 2008, 2010, and 2011 seasons of the Indian Premier League, the home team won 95 games (54.3%), and the away team won 80 games (45.7%).

===American football===
At least some degree of home field advantage has been recorded in almost every National Football League season; each year, designated home teams have won more games than lost. The 2020 NFL season, played in empty and near-empty stadiums, was the first in which no significant advantage was recorded: home teams that year finished 127–128–1 ().

===Hockey===
In the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, for the first time in NHL history all division winners (who had home-ice advantage) were eliminated in the first round as all the wild-cards advanced to the second round. The Columbus Blue Jackets won a playoff series for the first time, defeating the first-place Lightning in four games, and marking the first time in Stanley Cup playoff history that the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners were swept in the opening round, and the first time since 2012 that the Presidents&#x27; Trophy winners were defeated in the opening round. They were soon followed by the Calgary Flames, who with their five-game loss to the Colorado Avalanche, ensured that for the first time in NHL history, neither of the conference number one seeds advanced to the second round. After that, the two remaining division winners, the Nashville Predators and Washington Capitals, were each eliminated in an overtime game, the Predators in six by the Dallas Stars, and the Capitals in seven by the Carolina Hurricanes.

===Association football===
In the 2018–19 Premier League, the home team won 181 matches (47%), the away team won 128 matches (34%), and teams drew in 71 matches (19%); however, this is considered an aberration, as home advantage has statistically been steadily declining for over a century.

* Liverpool had 30 wins, 7 draws and 1 loss. They had 57% of their wins at home, and 100% of their losses away.
* Crystal Palace had 14 wins, 7 draws and 17 losses. They had 64% of their wins away, and 53% of their losses at home.

==&quot;Big Four&quot; playoff series in which the home team goes undefeated==
* This list includes MLB, NBA, and NHL playoff series that are best-of-five or best-of-seven in which the home team wins every game.
===MLB===
* In a best-of-five or best-of-seven series, the home team has won every game of a Major League Baseball postseason series 11 times.
===NBA===
* In a best-of-five or best-of-seven series, the home team has won every game in 43 different NBA playoff series.
===NHL===
* In a best-of-five or best-of-seven series, 13 times in the Stanley Cup playoffs has the home team gone undefeated across the entirety of the series.
===&quot;Big Four&quot; playoff series in which the road team goes undefeated===
* Conversely, only six playoff series that are either best-of-five or best-of-seven have seen the road team win every game of the series.
** Only three have occurred in a best-of-seven format.

<text>This glossary lists types of keys as the term is used in cryptography, as opposed to door locks. Terms that are primarily used by the U.S. National Security Agency are marked &quot;(NSA)&quot;. For classification of keys according to their usage see cryptographic key types.

* 40-bit key - key with a length of 40 bits, once the upper limit of what could be exported from the U.S. and other countries without a license. Considered very insecure. &quot;See&quot; key size for a discussion of this and other lengths.
* authentication key - Key used in a keyed-hash message authentication code, or HMAC.
* benign key - (NSA) a key that has been protected by encryption or other means so that it can be distributed without fear of its being stolen. Also called BLACK key.
* content-encryption key (CEK) a key that may be further encrypted using a KEK, where the content may be a message, audio, image, video, executable code, etc.
* crypto ignition key An NSA key storage device (KSD-64) shaped to look like an ordinary physical key.
* cryptovariable - NSA calls the output of a stream cipher a key or key stream. It often uses the term cryptovariable for the bits that control the stream cipher, what the public cryptographic community calls a key.
* data encryption key (DEK) used to encrypt the underlying data.
* derived key - keys computed by applying a predetermined hash algorithm or key derivation function to a password or, better, a passphrase.
* DRM key - A key used in digital rights management to protect media
* electronic key - (NSA) key that is distributed in electronic (as opposed to paper) form. &quot;See&quot; EKMS.
* [[ephemeral key]] - A key that only exists within the lifetime of a communication session.
* expired key - Key that was issued for a use in a limited time frame (cryptoperiod in NSA parlance) which has passed and, hence, the key is no longer valid.
* FIREFLY key - (NSA) keys used in an NSA system based on public key cryptography.
* Key derivation function (KDF) - function used to derive a key from a secret value, e.g. to derive KEK from Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
* key encryption key (KEK) - key used to protect MEK keys (or DEK/TEK if MEK is not used).
* key production key (KPK) -Key used to initialize a keystream generator for the production of other electronically generated keys.
* key fill - (NSA) loading keys into a cryptographic device. &quot;See&quot; fill device.
* master key - key from which all other keys (or a large group of keys) can be derived. Analogous to a physical key that can open all the doors in a building.
* master encryption key (MEK) - Used to encrypt the DEK/TEK key.
* master key encryption key (MKEK) - Used to encrypt multiple KEK keys. For example, an HSM can generate several KEK and wrap them with an MKEK before export to an external DB - such as OpenStack Barbican.

* [[one time pad]] (OTP or OTPad) - keying material that should be as long as the plaintext and should only be used once. If truly random and not reused it&#x27;s the most secure encryption method. &quot;See&quot; one-time pad article.
* one time password (OTP) - One time password based on a prebuilt single use code list or based on a mathematical formula with a secret seed known to both parties, uses event or time to modify output (see TOTP/HOTP).
* paper key - (NSA) keys that are distributed in paper form, such as printed lists of settings for rotor machines, or keys in punched card or paper tape formats. Paper keys are easily copied. &quot;See&quot; Walker spy ring, &quot;RED key&quot;.
* poem key - Keys used by OSS agents in World War II in the form of a poem that was easy to remember. &quot;See&quot; Leo Marks.
* public/private key - in public key cryptography, separate keys are used to encrypt and decrypt a message. The encryption key (public key) need not be kept secret and can be published. The decryption or private key must be kept secret to maintain confidentiality. Public keys are often distributed in a signed public key certificate.
* public key infrastructure - (PKI) a set of roles, policies, hardware, software and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption.
* pre-placed key - (NSA) large numbers of keys (perhaps a year&#x27;s supply) that are loaded into an encryption device allowing frequent key change without refill.
* RED key - (NSA) symmetric key in a format that can be easily copied, e.g. &quot;paper key&quot; or unencrypted &quot;electronic key&quot;. Opposite of &quot;BLACK&quot; or &quot;benign key&quot;.
* revoked key - a public key that should no longer be used, typically because its owner is no longer in the role for which it was issued or because it may have been compromised. Such keys are placed on a certificate revocation list or CRL.
* [[session key]] - key used for one message or an entire communications session. &quot;See traffic encryption key.&quot;
* symmetric key - a key that is used both to encrypt and decrypt a message. Symmetric keys are typically used with a cipher and must be kept secret to maintain confidentiality.
* traffic encryption key (TEK)/data encryption key (DEK) - a symmetric key that is used to encrypt messages. TEKs are typically changed frequently, in some systems daily and in others for every message. See &quot;session key&quot;. DEK is used to specify any data form type (in communication payloads or anywhere else).
* transmission security key (TSK) - (NSA) seed for a pseudorandom number generator that is used to control a radio in frequency hopping or direct-sequence spread spectrum modes. &quot;See&quot; HAVE QUICK, SINCGARS, electronic warfare.
* seed key - (NSA) a key used to initialize a cryptographic device so it can accept operational keys using benign transfer techniques. Also a key used to initialize a pseudorandom number generator to generate other keys.
* signature key - public key cryptography can also be used to electronically sign messages. The private key is used to create the electronic signature, the public key is used to verify the signature. Separate public/private key pairs must be used for signing and encryption. The former is called signature keys.
* stream key - the output of a stream cipher as opposed to the key (or &quot;cryptovariable&quot; in NSA parlance) that controls the cipher
* training key - (NSA) unclassified key used for instruction and practice exercises.
* Type 1 key - (NSA) keys used to protect classified information. &quot;See&quot; Type 1 product.
* Type 2 key - (NSA) keys used to protect sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. &quot;See&quot; Type 2 product.
* Vernam key - Type of key invented by Gilbert Vernam in 1918. &quot;See stream key&quot;.
* zeroized key - key that has been erased (see zeroisation.)

*Specific encryption systems and ciphers have key types associated with them, e.g. PGP key, DES key, AES key, RC4 key, BATON key, Kerberos key, etc.

<doc id="1070578" wikidata="Q83851589" url="?curid=1070578" title="Situs ambiguus">
<text>Situs ambiguus (), or heterotaxy, is a rare congenital defect in which the major visceral organs are distributed abnormally within the chest and abdomen. Clinically, heterotaxy spectrum generally refers to any defect of left-right asymmetry and arrangement of the visceral organs; however, classical heterotaxy requires multiple organs to be affected. This does not include the congenital defect situs inversus, which results when arrangement of all the organs in the abdomen and chest are mirrored, so the positions are opposite the normal placement. Situs inversus is the mirror image of situs solitus, which is normal asymmetric distribution of the abdominothoracic visceral organs. Situs ambiguus can also be subdivided into left-isomerism and right-isomerism based on the defects observed in the spleen, lungs and atria of the heart.

Individuals with situs inversus or situs solitus do not experience fatal dysfunction of their organ systems, as general anatomy and morphology of the abdominothoracic organ-vessel systems are conserved. Due to abnormal arrangement of organs in situs ambiguus, orientation across the left-right axis of the body is disrupted early in fetal development, resulting in severely flawed cardiac development and function in 50–80% of cases. They also experience complications with systemic and pulmonary blood vessels, significant morbidity, and sometimes death. All patients with situs ambiguus lack lateralization and symmetry of organs in the abdominal and thoracic cavities and are clinically considered to have a form of heterotaxy syndrome.

Heterotaxy syndrome with atrial isomerism occurs in 1 out of every 10,000 live births and is associated with approximately 3% of congenital heart disease cases. Additional estimation of incidence and prevalence of isomerism proves difficult due to failure to diagnose and underestimation of the disease by clinicians. Furthermore, right isomerism is much more easily recognized than left isomerism, contributing to the failure to diagnose.

Situs ambiguus is a growing field of research with findings dating back to 1973.

== Signs and symptoms ==
There are a variety of clinical manifestations of situs ambiguus. Acute symptoms can be due to both cardiac and non-cardiac defects. Cyanosis or blue skin coloration, primarily affecting the lips and fingernails, can indicate a systemic or circulatory issue. Poor feeding, failure to thrive, and rapid shallow breathing may also be observed due to poor circulation. Upon examination, arrhythmia and heart murmur may raise further suspicion of a cardiac abnormality. Non-cardiac symptoms include impairments of the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Biliary atresia, or inflammation and destruction of the bile ducts, may lead to jaundice. Vomiting and swelling of the abdominal region are features that suggest improper positioning of the intestines. Poor positioning of the intestine also makes it more prone to blockage, which can result in numerous chronic health issues. Asplenia and polysplenia are also possible features of heterotaxy syndrome.

Due to abnormal cardiac development, patients with situs ambiguus usually develop right atrial isomerism consisting of two bilaterally paired right atria, or left atrial isomerism consisting of two bilaterally paired left atria. Clinical features and symptoms can vary dependent upon assignment of left versus right atrial isomerism. In either instance, the apex of the heart will be poorly positioned, which should alert a clinician of the likelihood of atrial isomerism. It is estimated that 5–10% of isomeric patients have mesocardia, in which the heart is positioned at the center of the thorax, 25–50% have dextrocardia, in which the apex of the heart is pointed toward the right side of the thorax, and 50–70% have levocardia, in which the apex of the heart is pointed toward the left side of the thorax.

=== Right atrial appendage isomerism ===
Right atrial appendage isomerism, also called right atrial isomerism, is a cardiac development defect in which the heart has bilateral right atria and atrial attachments in the muscle wall, as opposed to the normal right atrium and left atrium. In right atrial isomerism, the pulmonary blood oxygen tract is damaged due to right-left shunting of blood. In addition, the atrial septum which distinguishes the 2 atria is absent. These impairments, in addition to congestion in the pulmonary tract, allows deoxygenated blood to mix with oxygenated blood, contributing to cyanosis and possible respiratory distress. Poor systemic circulation also results due to improper positioning of the aorta.

=== Left atrial appendage isomerism ===
Left atrial appendage isomerism, also called left atrial isomerism, is a cardiac development defect in which the heart has two bilateral left atria and atrial appendages in the muscle wall. Left atrial isomerism can have varied clinical manifestations, including a later onset of symptoms. Heart failure is often a concern because the inferior vena cava is disrupted due to the inappropriate morphology of the left ventricle to support the vena cava.

=== Conductive nodes and tissues ===
Abnormal development of the heart results in impaired doubles of conductive nodes, as well as faulty electrical fibers throughout the ventricles. Individuals with right atrial isomerism develop two sinoatrial nodes, as they have 2 mirrored right atria, whereas those with left atrial isomerism fail to develop a sinus node at all. Thus, patients with left atrial isomerism are more likely to experience atrial fibrillation, or irregular rapid heart beat, and abnormal heart rhythm, known as atrial flutter. Development of the atrioventricular node and bundle of His largely depends on physiological looping of the ventricles. Abnormal looping of the ventricles contributes to arrhythmia and heart block in fetuses.

=== Bronchial tree and lungs ===
Isomerism of the bronchial tree is not typically damaging and presents no significant clinical complications. Pulmonary valve stenosis results in issues of blood flow to the lungs.

=== Abdominal organs ===
Abdominal organs, including the liver, stomach, intestinal tract, and spleen may be randomly arranged throughout the left-right axis of the body. Distribution of these organs largely dictates treatment, clinical outcomes, and further evaluation.

The liver is typically symmetrical across the left-right axis in patients with situs ambiguus, which is abnormal. A majority of left atrial isomeric patients have defects throughout the biliary tree, which is responsible for bile production, even when the gall bladder is functional and morphologically normal. This biliary atresia can lead to acute problems such as nutrient malabsorption, pale stools, dark urine, and abdominal swelling. If this condition continues without proper treatment, cirrhosis and liver failure become a major concern. Biliary atresia is not usually observed in patients with right atrial isomerism.

Random positioning of the stomach is often one of the first signals of situs ambiguus upon examination. Malrotation of the entire intestinal tract, or improper folding and bulging of the stomach and intestines, results in bowel obstruction. This impairment leads to vomiting, abdominal distension, mucus and blood in the stool. Patients may also experience abdominal pain. Intestinal malrotation is more commonly identified in patients with right atrial isomerism than in those with left atrial isomerism.

Isomeric patients often experience disruptions to splenic development during embryogenesis, resulting in an overall lack a spleen (asplenia) or development of many spleens (polysplenia). Asplenia is most often observed in patients with right atrial isomerism. Polysplenia results in 90% of patients with left atrial isomerism. Although they have many spleens, each is usually ineffective resulting in functional asplenia. Rarely, left atrial isomeric patients have a single, normal, functional spleen. Patients lacking a functional spleen are in danger of sepsis and must be monitored.

== Causes ==
Situs ambiguus has been linked to family history of malformations and maternal cocaine use, suggesting both genetic and environmental factors play a role. Several genes in the TGF-beta pathway, which controls left-right patterning of visceral organs across the body axis, have been indicated in sporadic and familial cases of atrial isomerism. There is also overlap between genes associated with situs ambiguus and primary ciliary dyskinesia, likely due to the important role of cilia in establishing left-right asymmetry. The planar cell polarity has an important role in positioning these cilia, and thus genes within this pathway are increasingly associated with situs ambiguus.

Disrupted mitochondria function has also been recently linked to heterotaxy.

== Pathophysiology ==

=== Molecular and cellular mechanism ===
Several genes have been identified in normal development of the right-left axis. These genes have been extensively researched. Gene mutations that lead to atrial isomerism is a growing area of research. Mutations in genes that encode proteins in the TGF-beta pathway, including NODAL, NKX2-5, and ZIC3, have been linked to tetralogy of Fallot and hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Mutations in the ZIC3 gene, which encodes a zinc finger family transcription factor, is linked to a 50% risk of atrial isomerism in families. It is also an X-linked disorder, so testing for ZIC3 mutations is highly encouraged in male births.

The most prevalent and best characterized genetic associations of heterotaxy include:

=== Classical pathology ===
* Cardiac looping malformations:
** Fallot&#x27;s tetralogy
** transposition of the great vessels
** Ventricular and atrial septal defects.
* Deranged abdominal organ asymmetry:
** The stomach and spleen are prone to isolated reversal
** The stomach, liver, and a single adrenal gland are occasionally found in the midline.
* Organ malformations:
** asplenia and polysplenia often lead to sepsis
** More rarely, the head of the pancreas fails to form
** Horseshoe kidneys develop, which can lead to cancer, kidney stones, and/or infection.
* Malrotation errors cause volvulus and/or faulty peritoneal attachments, which completely obstruct the bowel.
* Vascular abnormalities:
** Interrupted inferior vena cava,
** Bilateral superior or inferior venae cavae
** Intrahepatic interruption of the inferior vena cava with connection to the azygos or hemiazygos veins
** Aberrant portal veins.

=== Bronchial tree and lungs ===
Pathophysiology in the bronchial tree can be observed by radiography. Under normal development, the bronchial tree consists of two main bronchi that are anatomically different:
* Hyparterial bronchus (below the pulmonary artery): supplies blood to the bi-lobed left lung
* Eparterial bronchus (adjacent to the artery): supplies blood to the tri-lobed right lung
In situs ambiguus, there is a duplication of either the hyparterial or eparterial bronchus. These features are not associated with any significant clinical complications. Mechanisms leading to bronchial duplication are not thoroughly understood.

In pulmonary valve stenosis, there is a reduction in blood flow to the lungs due to an obstruction of the heart at the pulmonic valve. This contributes to cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension.

==Diagnosis==
For proper diagnosis of situs ambiguus, cardiac and non-cardiac features must be evaluated. Diagnostic criteria for atrial isomerism includes observation of symmetry of thoracic visceral organs upon echocardiogram, arrhythmia upon electrocardiogram, and chest x-ray for confirmation of the heart&#x27;s location across the left-right axis. Additional radiographic and cross-sectional imaging may be obtained to evaluate both cardiac and non-cardiac manifestations of situs ambiguus. In addition, a series of gastrointestinal tests can be conducted for observation of intestinal malrotation, as well as a scan of the liver and spleen for biliary function.

=== Diagnostic techniques for cardiac causes ===
* Echocardiography
* Electrocardiography
* Computed tomography
* Magnetic resonance imaging
* Cardiac catheterization and angiography
* Chest x-ray

=== Diagnostic techniques for non-cardiac causes ===
* Computed tomography
* Magnetic resonance imaging
* Splenic function analysis
* Evaluation of biliary anatomy and cholangiogram
* Evaluation of intestinal malrotation
* Pulse oximeter

=== Other diagnostic features ===
* Assessment of family history
* Genetic testing

== Management ==
Each of the symptoms of situs ambiguus must be managed with appropriate treatment dependent upon the organ system involved. Intestinal malrotation is treated surgically using the Ladd procedure. This procedure widens a fold in the peritoneum so that the intestines can be placed in non-rotated formation. It is not possible to return the bowel to a normal morphology However, 89% of patients that undergo the Ladd surgery experience a complete resolution of symptoms.

Following cholangiogram, a Kasai procedure is usually performed in cases of biliary atresia. In this surgery, a Y-shaped shunt is used to passage bile from the liver directly to the intestine. If this is unsuccessful, liver transplantation can be considered based on the overall health of the patient. The Kasai procedure is successful in approximately 80% of patients. Following the operation, patients are advised to take fat-soluble vitamins, choleretics, and anti-inflammatory medications.

Functionally asplenic patients have an elevated lifetime risk of sepsis, as they have no functional spleen for fighting infection. For this reason, asplenic patients are under constant observation for any signs of fever or infection. In the case of infection, patients are placed on controlled empiric antibiotic therapy to avoid development of antibiotic resistance. This therapy battles infection by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Right-atrial and left-atrial isomerism and associated pulmonary issues are treated in a series of steps based on the severity of symptoms. Isomeric patients are first treated by inserting a shunt that will move incoming blood through the pulmonary circuit. The Fontan procedure routes blood through the patient&#x27;s single ventricle, to the lungs, and into systemic circulation. This process is favorable in patients aged 2 to 5 years old. About 20–30% of patients will require a heart transplant. Left-atrial isomeric patients have less severe complications, as they typically have 2 functional ventricles. In this case, they can undergo biventricular repair to form 2 separate ventricles and functional associated valves.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis for patients with situs ambiguus is quite varied, owed to the spectrum of clinical manifestations. Infants who experience severe cyanosis at birth may die within hours of delivery if medical intervention is not immediate. Alternatively, longevity of neonates with mild cardiac lesions is unaffected. Ten percent of patients born with right atrial isomerism die by the age of 5 without intervention. Improvements in therapies has increased the 5-year survival to 30–74% for right atrial isomeric patients and 65–84% for left atrial isomeric patients based on the cause of their disease.

== Research ==
There have been vast amounts of research on the clinical features, racial disparities, and physiological mechanisms of heterotaxy syndrome dating back to 1973.

Mishra et al. published a review in November 2015 describing current knowledge of cardiac and non-cardiac abnormalities associated with situs ambiguus. The author stresses the importance of genetic testing prior to deciding a prognosis for affected patients. She also proposes prenatal screening and evaluation in cases at risk for development of situs ambiguus.

Recent studies have shown higher rates of heterotaxy syndrome among Hispanic infants of Mexican descent, as well as female infants of non-Hispanic black and white mothers. Additional studies must be done to clarify the mechanisms behind racial disparities in heterotaxy syndrome. Individuals of Asian descent show a higher prevalence of heterotaxy syndrome in general than members of the Western world.

The National Birth Defects Prevention study (October 2014) attempted to link clinical presentations of situs ambiguus to demographics in an epidemiological study. This proved a difficult task due to the vast differences in presentation of this disorder. However, the authors are hopeful that finding a link can help inform clinical decision-making, predictive analyses, and future outcomes.

<text>Castle Combe is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. The village is around north-west of Chippenham and north-east of Bath. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 356.

Castle Combe is within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is a popular tourist attraction. With its cluster of Cotswold stone cottages and lack of modern buildings – no new houses have been built in the historic centre of the village since about 1600 – the village has been described as a &quot;chocolate box&quot;, a &quot;tourist honeypot&quot;, and &quot;the prettiest village in England&quot;.

The village is in two parts: one is in the narrow valley of By Brook, while Upper Castle Combe is on higher land to the east, on the B4039 road connecting Chippenham and Chipping Sodbury. South of the upper village is the Castle Combe motor racing circuit. A castle once stood in the area, but was demolished centuries ago.

==History==
A Roman villa once stood about three miles from the village, indicating Roman occupation of the area. The site has been excavated on at least three occasions, the first by George Poulett Scrope in 1852 and the most recent in 2010. Some reports refer to the site as the North Wraxall or the Truckle Hill villa. Evidence of a bath house and corn drying ovens were found, the latter from the 4th century. The villa itself apparently contained 16 rooms, and there were additional buildings and a cemetery. Neolithic flint tools and Iron Age brooches were also discovered not far from the villa, in 1985.

The settlement was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, with 33 households; the Lord was Humphrey de l&#x27;Isle.

The village takes its name from the 12th-century castle which stood about to the north. The site where the castle once stood now only contains the old earthworks and masonry, which are estimated to date from the 12th century. It is believed that the castle was constructed as the seat of the Barony of Combe under Reginald de Dunstanville either during the reign of Henry I or Henry II. Reginald was thought to support Empress Matilda during the Anarchy, and the castle was constructed during the wave of castle buildings of the Anarchy period.
The 14th-century market cross, erected when the right to hold a weekly market in Castle Combe was granted, stands where the three principal streets of the lower village converge. The Market Cross, a scheduled monument, reflects &quot;the significance of the cloth industry in this area&quot;. Next to the cross is one of Castle Combe&#x27;s two village pumps. Small stone steps near the cross were for horse riders to mount and dismount, and close by are the remains of the buttercross, built in the late 19th century from old masonry. This structure, also known as Weavers&#x27; Steps and &#x27;the stone&#x27;, is another scheduled monument.

During the 14th century, the seat of the Barony was transferred to the Manor House within Castle Combe village and a deer park was created next to the castle. The market town prospered during the 15th century when it belonged to Millicent, the wife of Sir Stephen Le Scrope and then of Sir John Fastolf (1380–1459), a Norfolk knight who was the effective lord of the manor for fifty years. By 1340, the village had a fulling mill, confirming the importance of wool by that time. Scrope promoted the woollen industry, supplying his own troops and others for Henry V&#x27;s war in France. The parish was in the ancient hundred of Chippenham.
By the 17th century, John Aubrey stated that a market was held on the site of the old castle. At some time in the late 1700s, the level of the Bybrook River fell, so it could no longer be used to power mills. The cloth industry began leaving the area during that century; &quot;industrial prosperity was over and the population decreased&quot;. Notable houses include the Dower House, from the late 17th century is now Grade II listed.

The village was owned by the Scrope family for over five centuries, until 1866 when it was sold to the Gorst family and Edward Chaddock Lowndes (who was previously also known as Gorst). The latter spent a great deal of money on improving the manor house and the estate.

A National School was built in 1826, on a site between the upper and lower villages. The school was taken over by the county council in 1909, and educated children of all ages until 1956 when older pupils were transferred to secondary schools in Chippenham. It closed in 1998 on the opening of a new primary school at Yatton Keynell.

During the Second World War, the RAF Castle Combe airfield was built east of the village, with runways, hangars and a control tower. Between 1946 and 1948 the airfield buildings were used as temporary housing for former military from Poland. The property was sold in 1948, and was later modified for motor racing; the tower is still used during races at Castle Combe Circuit.

For decades the village had a number of gristmills and sawmills but all went out of business; Nettleton Mill closed before 1916 and Gatcombe Mill closed circa 1925; both are Grade II listed. The Long Dean Mill shut down in 1956; the Lower mill is now Grade II listed; Colham Mill was demolished in 1962. The last remaining stone tower of the castle stood for centuries, but it too was demolished, in 1950.

== Listed buildings ==
Castle Combe parish has 107 listed buildings; nearly all are in the Grade II category.

== Religious sites ==
=== Parish church ===
The Church of England parish church of St Andrew is a Grade I listed building. Part of the chancel is 13th-century; in 1850–51 nearly all of the building, except the 15th-century tower, was taken down and reconstructed to the same plan.

=== Congregational Church ===
The first chapel was built in 1757 and extended with a schoolroom in 1846. The current church, opened in 1914, is in the upper part of the village on what is now the B4039 road. The building is a former malt house and is attached to an 18th-century house which became the manse. The church continues in use.

== In popular culture ==
The village was a location for the 1967 film musical &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot;. Its frequently rainy summer climate frustrated production, as did attempted sabotage – including by British Army officer (and future explorer) Sir Ranulph Fiennes - because of residents&#x27; irritation at the producers&#x27; modifications of the area for shooting. Other productions include &quot;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&quot;, an episode of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, The Shell Seekers (1989) and the films &quot;Stardust&quot; and &quot;The Wolfman&quot;. Throughout September 2010, the village was a filming location for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s production of &quot;War Horse&quot;.

Raymond Austin set the action of his book &quot;Find me a Spy, Catch me a Traitor&quot; in the village and at the Manor. The house of Alice Cartalet in the manga and anime series &quot;Kiniro Mosaic&quot; was based on Fosse Farmhouse, a guesthouse near Castle Combe.

The village was a filming location for the fantasy adventure movie &quot;Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box&quot; in 2012, and later for a series of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;.

The Apple TV+ spy thriller series Slow Horses filmed several episodes of its second series in Castle Combe and the nearby airfield, referring to the village as &#x27;Upshott&#x27;.

==Tourist services==
Castle Combe has a car park at the top of the hill, and toilet facilities over the bridge at the bottom of the village. A small museum closed in 2012.

The Manor House was built in the 17th century and rebuilt in the 19th. It has 48 rooms and of gardens. During World War II, the house was used as a hospital. In 1947, the owner of the Castle Combe estate sold the houses and the estate and the Manor House became a country club. After 18 months, the club left the premises, and the house was shortly thereafter sold to Bobbie Allen, an amateur hotelier, and her husband. Mrs Allen wrote a book of her experiences, &quot;From Claridge&#x27;s to Castle Combe&quot;. The property was owned by the Allen family for some time, and they sold the Manor House to Mr and Mrs Oliver Clegg who (some time after 1976) sold it to the corporation which now owns the property. By the time it was listed as a Grade II property in 1960, it was already operating as a hotel.

<doc id="1070600" wikidata="Q1503425" url="?curid=1070600" title="Metabolism (architecture)">
<text>was a post-war Japanese biomimetic architectural movement that fused ideas about architectural megastructures with those of organic biological growth. It had its first international exposure during CIAM&#x27;s 1959 meeting and its ideas were tentatively tested by students from Kenzo Tange&#x27;s MIT studio.

During the preparation for the 1960 Tokyo World Design Conference a group of young architects and designers, including Kiyonori Kikutake, Kisho Kurokawa and Fumihiko Maki prepared the publication of the Metabolism manifesto. They were influenced by a wide variety of sources including Marxist theories and biological processes. Their manifesto was a series of four essays entitled: Ocean City, Space City, Towards Group Form, and Material and Man, and it also included designs for vast cities that floated on the oceans and plug-in capsule towers that could incorporate organic growth. Although the World Design Conference gave the Metabolists exposure on the international stage, their ideas remained largely theoretical.

Some smaller, individual buildings that employed the principles of Metabolism were built and these included Tange&#x27;s Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre and Kurokawa&#x27;s Nakagin Capsule Tower. The greatest concentration of their work was to be found at the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka where Tange was responsible for master planning the whole site whilst Kikutake and Kurokawa designed pavilions. After the 1973 oil crisis, the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan and toward Africa and the Middle East.

==Origins of Metabolism==
The Congrès Internationaux d&#x27;Architecture Moderne (CIAM) was founded in Switzerland in 1928 as an association of architects who wanted to advance modernism into an international setting. During the early 1930s they promoted the idea (based upon new urban patterns in the United States) that urban development should be guided by CIAM&#x27;s four functional categories: dwelling, work, transportation, and recreation. By the mid-1930s Le Corbusier and other architects had moulded CIAM into a pseudo-political party with the goal of promoting modern architecture to all. This view gained some traction in the immediate post-war period when Le Corbusier and his colleagues began to design buildings in Chandigarh. By the early 1950s it was felt that CIAM was losing its avant-garde edge so in 1954 a group of younger members called &quot;Team 10&quot; was formed. This included the inner circle Dutch architects Jacob Bakema and Aldo van Eyck, Italian Giancarlo De Carlo, Greek Georges Candilis, the British architects Peter and Alison Smithson and the American Shadrach Woods. The Team 10 architects introduced concepts like &quot;human association&quot;, &quot;cluster&quot; and &quot;mobility&quot;, with Bakema encouraging the combination of architecture and planning in urban design. This was a rejection of CIAM&#x27;s older four function mechanical approach, and it would ultimately lead to the break-up and end of CIAM.

Kenzo Tange was invited to the CIAM &#x27;59 meeting of the association in Otterlo, Netherlands. In what was to be the last meeting of CIAM, he presented two theoretical projects by the architect Kiyonori Kikutake: the Tower-shaped City and Kikutake&#x27;s own home, the Sky House. This presentation exposed the fledgling Metabolist movement to its first international audience. Like Team 10&#x27;s &quot;human association&quot; concepts, Metabolism too was exploring new concepts in urban design.

Tower-shaped City was a 300 metre tall tower that housed the infrastructure for an entire city. It included transportation, services and a manufacturing plant for prefabricated houses. The tower was vertical &quot;artificial land&quot; onto which steel, pre-fabricated dwelling capsules could be attached. Kikutake proposed that these capsules would undergo self-renewal every fifty years, and the city would grow organically like branches of a tree.

Constructed on a hillside, the Sky House is a platform supported on four concrete panels with a hyperbolic paraboloid shell roof. It is a single space divided by storage units with the kitchen and bathroom on the outer edge. These latter two were designed so that they could be moved to suit the use of the house—and, indeed, they have been moved and/or adjusted about seven times over the course of fifty years. At one point a small children&#x27;s room was attached to the bottom of the main floor with a small child-sized access door between the two rooms.

After the meeting, Tange left for Massachusetts Institute of Technology to begin a four-month period as a visiting professor. It is possible that based upon the reception of Kikutake&#x27;s projects in Otterlo he decided to set the fifth year project as a design for a residential community of 25,000 inhabitants to be constructed on the water of Boston Bay. Tange felt a natural desire to produce urban designs based upon a new prototype of design, one that could give a more human connection to super-scale cities. He considered the idea of &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; city structure and how this could grow in cycles like the trunk and leaves of a tree.

One of the seven projects produced by the students was a perfect example of his vision. The project consisted of two primary residential structures each of which was triangular in section. Lateral movement was provided by motorways and monorail, whilst vertical movement from the parking areas was via elevators. There were open spaces within for community centres, and at every third level there were walkways along which were rows of family houses. The project appeared to be based upon Tange&#x27;s unrealised competition entry for the World Health Organization headquarters in Geneva and both projects paved the way for his later project, &quot;Plan for Tokyo – 1960&quot;. Tange went on to present both the Boston Bay Project and the Tokyo Plan at the Tokyo World Design Conference.

==Tokyo World Design Conference, 1960==

The conference had its roots with Isamu Konmochi and Sori Yanagi who were representatives of the Japanese Committee on the 1956 International Design Conference in Aspen, Colorado. They suggested that rather than a four yearly conference in Aspen there should be a roving conference with Tokyo as its first setting in 1960. Three Japanese institutional members were responsible for organising the conference, although after the Japan Industrial Design Association pulled out only the Japan Institute of Architects and the Japan Association of Advertising Arts were left. In 1958 they formed a preparation committee led by Junzo Sakakura, Kunio Maekawa and Kenzo Tange. As Tange had just accepted an invitation to be a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology he recommended his junior colleague Takashi Asada to replace him in the organisation of the conference programmes.

The young Asada invited two friends to help him: the architectural critic and former editor of the magazine Shinkenchiku, Noboru Kawazoe, and Kisho Kurokawa who was one of Tange&#x27;s students. In turn these two men scouted for more talented designers to help, including: the architects Masato Otaka and Kiyonori Kikutake and the designers Kenji Ekuan and Kiyoshi Awazu. Kurokawa was selected because he had recently returned from an international student conference in the Soviet Union and was a student of the Marxist architectural theorist Uzō Nishiyama. Ekuan was asked because of his recent participation in a seminar given by Konrad Wachsmann (he arrived at the lecture on a YA-1 motorbike that he had newly designed for Yamaha) and Otaka was a junior associate of Kunio Maekawa and had just completed the Harumi Apartment Building in Tokyo Bay. Fumihiko Maki, a former undergraduate student of Tange also joined the group whilst in Tokyo on a travelling fellowship from the Graham Foundation.

By day Asada canvassed politicians, business leaders and journalists for ideas, by night he met with his young friends to cultivate ideas. Asada was staying at the Ryugetsu Ryokan in Asakusa, Tokyo and he used it as a meeting place for progressive scholars, architects and artists. He often invited people from other professions to give talks and one of these was the atomic physicist, Mitsuo Taketani. Taketani was a scholar who was also interested in Marxist theory and he brought this along with his scientific theories to the group. Taketani&#x27;s three stage methodology for scientific research influenced Kikutake&#x27;s own three stage theory: &quot;ka&quot; (the general system), &quot;kata&quot; (the abstract image) and &quot;katachi&quot; (the solution as built), which he used to summarise his own design process from a broad vision to a concrete architectural form.

The group also searched for architectural solutions to Japan&#x27;s phenomenal urban expansion brought about by its economic growth and how this could be reconciled with its shortage of usable land. They were inspired by examples of circular growth and renewal found in traditional Japanese architecture like the Ise Shrine and Katsura Detached Palace. They worked in coffee shops and Tokyo&#x27;s International House to produce a compilation of their works that they could publish as a manifesto for the conference.

The conference ran from 11–16 May 1960 and had 227 guests, 84 of whom were international, including the architects Louis Kahn, Ralph Erskine, B. V. Doshi, Jean Prouvé, Paul Rudolph and Peter and Alison Smithson. Japanese participants included Kunio Maekawa, Yoshinobu Ashihara and Kazuo Shinohara.

After his 13 May lecture, Louis Kahn was invited to Kikutake&#x27;s Sky House and had a long conversation with a number of Japanese architects including the Metabolists. He answered questions until after midnight with Maki acting as translator. Kahn spoke of his universal approach to design and used his own Richards Medical Research Laboratories as an example of how new design solutions can be reached with new thinking about space and movement. A number of the Metabolists were inspired by this.

===The Metabolism name===

Whilst discussing the organic nature of Kikutake&#x27;s theoretical Marine City project, Kawazoe used the Japanese word &quot;shinchintaisha&quot; as being symbolic of the essential exchange of materials and energy between organisms and the exterior world (literally &quot;metabolism&quot; in a biological sense.) The Japanese meaning of the word has a feeling of &quot;replacement of the old with the new&quot; and the group further interpreted this to be equivalent to the continuous renewal and organic growth of the city. As the conference was to be a world conference, Kawazoe felt that they should use a more universal word and Kikutake looked up the definition of &quot;shinchintaisha&quot; in his Japanese-English dictionary. The translation he found was the word &quot;Metabolism&quot;.

==The Metabolism manifesto==

The group&#x27;s manifesto, &quot;Metabolism: The Proposals for New Urbanism&quot;, was published at the World Design Conference. Two thousand copies of the 90 page book were printed and were sold for ¥500 by Kurokawa and Awazu at the entrance to the venue. The manifesto opened with the following statement:

The publication included projects by each member but a third of the document was dedicated to work by Kikutake who contributed essays and illustrations on the &quot;Ocean City&quot;. Kurokawa contributed &quot;Space City&quot;, Kawazoe contributed &quot;Material and Man&quot; and Otaka and Maki wrote &quot;Towards the Group Form&quot;. Awazu designed the booklet and Kawazoe&#x27;s wife, Yasuko, edited the layout.

Some of the projects included in the manifesto were subsequently displayed at the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s 1960 exhibition entitled &quot;Visionary Architecture&quot; and exposed the Japanese architects&#x27; work to a much wider international audience.

Unlike the more rigid membership structure of Team 10, the Metabolists saw their movement as having organic form with the members being free to come and go. Although the group had cohesion they saw themselves as individuals and their architecture reflected this. This was especially true for Tange who remained a mentor for the group rather than an &quot;official&quot; member.

===Ocean City===
Kikutake&#x27;s Ocean City is the first essay in the pamphlet. It covered his two previously published projects &quot;Tower-shaped City&quot; and &quot;Marine City&quot; and included a new project &quot;Ocean City&quot; that was a combination of the first two. The first two of these projects introduced the Metabolist&#x27;s idea of &quot;artificial land&quot; as well as &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; structure. Kawazoe referred to &quot;artificial land&quot; in an article in the magazine &quot;Kindai Kenchiku&quot; in April 1960. In responding to the scarcity of land in large and expanding cities he proposed creating &quot;artificial land&quot; that would be composed of concrete slabs, oceans or walls (onto which capsules could be plugged). He said that the creation of this &quot;artificial land&quot; would allow people to use other land in a more natural way.

For Marine City, Kikutake proposed a city that would float free in the ocean and would be free of ties to a particular nation and therefore free from the threat of war. The artificial ground of the city would house agriculture, industry and entertainment and the residential towers would descend into the ocean to a depth of 200 metres. The city itself was not tied to the land and was free to float across the ocean and grow organically like an organism. Once it became too aged for habitation it would sink itself.

Ocean City was a combination of both Tower-shaped City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the tangent point. The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself as though it was undergoing cell division. This enforced the Metabolist idea that the expansion of cities could be a biological process.

===Space City===

In his essay &quot;Space City&quot;, Kurokawa introduced four projects: Neo-Tokyo Plan, Wall City, Agricultural City and Mushroom-shaped house. In contrast to Tange&#x27;s linear Tokyo City Bay Project, Kurokawa&#x27;s Neo-Tokyo Plan proposed that Tokyo be decentralised and organised into cruciform patterns. He arranged Bamboo-shaped Cities along these cruciforms but unlike Kikutake he kept the city towers lower than 31 metres to conform with Tokyo&#x27;s building code (these height limits were not revised until 1968).

The Wall City considered the problem of the ever-expanding distance between the home and the workplace. He proposed a wall-shaped city that could extend indefinitely. Dwellings would be on one side of the wall and workplaces on the other. The wall itself would contain transportation and services.

Surviving the Ise Bay Typhoon in 1959 inspired Kurokawa to design the Agricultural City. It consisted of a grid-like city supported on 4 metre stilts above the ground. The 500 metres square city sat on concrete slab that placed industry and infrastructure above agriculture and was an attempt to combine rural land and the city into one entity. He envisaged that his Mushroom Houses would sprout through the slab of Agriculture City. These houses were shrouded in a mushroom-like cap that was neither wall nor roof that enclosed a tea room and a living space.

===Towards the Group Form===

Maki and Otaka&#x27;s essay on Group Form placed less emphasis on the megastructures of some of the other Metabolists and focused instead on a more flexible form of urban planning that could better accommodate rapid and unpredictable requirements of the city.

Otaka had first thought about the relationship between infrastructure and architecture in his 1949 graduation thesis and he continued to explore ideas about &quot;artificial ground&quot; during his work at Maekawa&#x27;s office. Likewise, during his travels abroad, Maki was impressed with the grouping and forms of vernacular buildings. The project they included to illustrate their ideas was a scheme for the redevelopment of Shinjuku station which included retail, offices and entertainment on an artificial ground over the station. Although Otaka&#x27;s forms were heavy and sculptural and Maki&#x27;s were lightweight with large spans, both contained the homogeneous clusters that were associated with group form.

===Material and Man===
Kawazoe contributed a brief essay entitled &quot;I want to be a sea-shell, I want to be a mold, I want to be a spirit&quot;. The essay reflected Japan&#x27;s cultural anguish after the Second World War and proposed the unity of man and nature.

==Plan for Tokyo, 1960–2025==

On 1 January 1961 Kenzo Tange presented his new plan for Tokyo Bay (1960) in a 45-minute television programme on NHK General TV. The design was a radical plan for the reorganization and expansion of the capital in order to cater for a population beyond 10 million. The design was for a linear city that used a series of nine-kilometre modules that stretched 80 km across Tokyo Bay from Ikebukuro in the north west to Kisarazu in the south east. The perimeter of each of the modules was organised into three levels of looping highways, as Tange was adamant that an efficient communication system would be the key to modern living. The modules themselves were organised into building zones and transport hubs and included office, government administration and retail districts as well as a new Tokyo train station and highway links to other parts of Tokyo. Residential areas were to be accommodated on parallel streets that ran perpendicular to the main linear axis and people would build their own houses within giant A-frame structures.

The project was designed by Tange and other members of his studio at Tokyo University, including Kurokawa and Arata Isozaki. Originally it was intended to publish the plan at the World Design Conference (hence its &quot;1960&quot; title) but it was delayed because the same members were working on the Conference organisation. Tange received interest and support from a number of government agencies but the project was never built. Tange went on to expand the idea of the linear city in 1964 with the Tōkaidō Megalopolis Plan. This was an ambitious proposal to extend Tokyo&#x27;s linear city across the whole of the Tōkaidō region of Japan in order to re-distribute the population.

Both Kikutake and Kurokawa capitalised on the interest in Tange&#x27;s 1960 plan by producing their own schemes for Tokyo. Kikutake&#x27;s plan incorporated three elements both on the land and the sea and included a looped highway that connected all the prefectures around the bay. Unlike Tange however its simple presentation graphics put many people off. Kurokawa&#x27;s plan consisted of helix-shaped megastructures floating inside cells that extended out across the bay. Although the scheme&#x27;s more convincing graphics were presented as part of a film the project was not built.

With Japan&#x27;s property boom in the 1980s, both Tange and Kurokawa revisited their earlier ideas: Tange with his Tokyo Plan 1986 and Kurokawa with his New Tokyo Plan 2025. Both projects used land that had been reclaimed from the sea since the 1960s in combination with floating structures.

== Plan for Skopje ==

The reconstruction plan of the capital city of Skopje then part of the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) following a major earthquake was won by Tange&#x27;s team. The project was significant because of its international influence as well as an international model case for urban reconstruction. It is a major breakthrough for the Metabolist movement to realise their approach on an international scale.

==Selected built projects==



===Yamanashi Press and Broadcaster Centre===

In 1961 Kenzo Tange received a commission from the Yamanashi News Group to design a new office in Kōfu. As well as two news firms and a printing company the building needed to incorporate a cafeteria and shops at ground floor level to interface with the adjoining city. It also needed to be flexible in its design to allow future expansion.

Tange organised the spaces of the three firms by function to allow them to share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange&#x27;s design from other architects&#x27; designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn&#x27;s Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.

Although the building was expanded in 1974 as Tange had originally envisioned, it did not act as a catalyst for the expansion of the building into a megastructure across the rest of the city. The building was criticised for forsaking the human use of the building in preference to the structure and adaptability.

===Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower===

In 1966 Tange designed the Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower in the Ginza district of Tokyo. This time using only a single core Tange arranged the offices as cantilevered steel and glass boxes. The cantilever is emphasised by punctuating the three-storey blocks with a single-storey glazed balcony. The concrete forms of the building were cast using aluminium formwork and the aluminium has been left on as a cladding. Although conceived as a &quot;core-type&quot; system that was included in Tange&#x27;s other city proposals, the tower stands alone and is robbed of other connections.

===Nakagin Capsule Tower===

The icon of Metabolism, Kurokawa&#x27;s Nakagin Capsule Tower was erected in the Ginza district of Tokyo in 1972 and completed in just 30 days. Prefabricated in Shiga Prefecture in a factory that normally built shipping containers, it is constructed of 140 capsules plugged into two cores that are 11 and 13 stories in height. The capsules contained the latest gadgets of the day and were built to house small offices and pieds-à-terre for Tokyo salarymen.

The capsules were constructed of light steel welded trusses covered with steel sheeting mounted onto the reinforced concrete cores. The capsules were 2.5 metres wide and four metres long with a 1.3 metre diameter window at one end. The units originally contained a bed, storage cabinets, a bathroom, a colour television set, clock, refrigerator and air conditioner, although optional extras such as a stereo were available. Although the capsules were designed with mass production in mind, there was never a demand for them. Nobuo Abe was a senior manager, managing one of the design divisions on the construction of the Nakagin Capsule Tower.

Since 1996, the tower was listed as an architectural heritage by DoCoMoMo. However, in 2007 the residents voted to tear the tower down and build a new 14-story tower. In 2010, some of the remaining habitable pods were converted for use as budget hotel rooms. As of 2017, many capsules had been renovated and were being used as residential and office spaces, while short-stay renting such as Airbnb or other lodging provisions had been banned by the administration of the building. The tower was demolished in April of 2022. 

===Hillside Terrace, Tokyo===

After the World Design Conference Maki began to distance himself from Metabolist movement, although his studies in &quot;Group Form&quot; continued to be of interest to the Metabolists. In 1964 he published a booklet entitled &quot;Investigations in Collective Form&quot; in which he investigated three urban forms: Compositional-form, Megastructure and Group Form. The Hillside Terrace is a series of projects commissioned by the Asakura family and undertaken in seven phases from 1967 to 1992. It includes residential, office and cultural buildings as well as the Royal Danish Embassy and is situated on both sides of Kyū-Yamate avenue in the Daikanyama district of Tokyo.

The execution of the designs evolves through the phases with exterior forms becoming more independent of the interior functions and new materials being employed. For example, the first phase has a raised pedestrian deck that gives access to shops and a restaurant and this was designed to be extended in subsequent phases but the idea, along with the original master plan, was discarded in later phases. By the third phase Maki moved away from the Modernist maxim of &quot;form follows function&quot; and started to design the building exteriors to better match the immediate environment. The project acted as a catalyst to the redevelopment of the whole area around Daikanyama Station.

==Metabolism in context==

Metabolism developed during the post war period in a Japan that questioned its cultural identity. Initially the group had chosen the name &quot;Burnt Ash School&quot; to reflect the ruined state of firebombed Japanese cities and the opportunity they presented for radical re-building. Ideas of nuclear physics and biological growth were linked with Buddhist concepts of regeneration. Although Metabolism rejected visual references from the past, they embraced concepts of prefabrication and renewal from traditional Japanese architecture, especially the twenty-year cycle of the rebuilding of the Ise Shrine (to which Tange and Kawazoe were invited in 1953). The sacred rocks onto which the shrine is built were seen by the Metabolists as symbolising a Japanese spirit that predated Imperial aspirations and modernising influences from the West.

In his &quot;Investigations in Collective Form&quot; Maki coined the term &quot;Megastructure&quot; to refer structures that house the whole or part of a city in a single structure. He originated the idea from vernacular forms of village architecture that were projected into vast structures with the aid of modern technology. Reyner Banham borrowed &quot;Megastructure&quot; for the title of his 1976 book which contained numerous built and unbuilt projects. He defined megastructures as modular units (with a short life span) that attached to structural framework (with a longer life span). Maki would later criticise the &quot;Megastructure&quot; approach to design advocating instead his idea of &quot;Group Form&quot; which he thought would better accommodate the disorder of the city.

The architect Robin Boyd readily interchanges the word Metabolism with Archigram in his 1968 book &quot;New Directions in Japanese Architecture&quot;. Indeed, the two groups both emerged in the 1960s and disbanded in the 1970s and used imagery with megastructures and cells, but their urban and architectural proposals were quite different. Although utopian in their ideals, the Metabolists were concerned with improving the social structure of society with their biologically inspired architecture, whereas Archigram were influenced by mechanics, information and electronic media and their architecture was more utopian and less social.

==Osaka Expo, 1970==

Japan was selected as the site for the 1970 World Exposition and 330 hectares in the Senri Hills in Osaka Prefecture were set aside as the location. Japan had originally wanted to host a World Exposition in 1940 but it was cancelled with the escalation of the war. The one million people who had bought tickets for 1940 were allowed to use them in 1970.

Kenzo Tange joined the Theme Committee for the Expo and along with Uso Nishiyama he had responsibility for master planning the site. The theme for the Expo became &quot;Progress and Harmony for Mankind&quot;. Tange invited twelve architects, including Arata Isozaki, Otaka and Kikutake to design individual elements. He also asked Ekuan to oversee the design of the furniture and transportation and Kawazoe to curate the Mid-Air Exhibition which was sited in the huge space-frame roof.

Tange envisioned that the Expo should be primarily conceived as a big festival where human beings could meet. Central to the site he placed the Festival Plaza onto which were connected a number of themed displays, all of which were united under one huge roof. In his Tokyo Bay Project Tange spoke about the living body having two types of information transmission systems: fluid and electronic. That project used the idea of a tree trunk and branches that would carry out those types of transmission in relation to the city. Kawazoe likened the space frame roof of the Festival Plaza to the electronic transmission system and the aerial-themed displays that plugged into it to the hormonal system.

Kawazoe, Maki and Kurokawa had invited a selection of world architects to design displays for the Mid-Air Exhibition that was to be incorporated within the roof. The architects included Moshe Safdie, Yona Friedman, Hans Hollein and Giancarlo De Carlo. Although Tange was obsessed with the theory of flexibility that the space framed provide he did concede that in reality it was not so practical for the actual fixing of the displays. The roof itself was designed by Koji Kamaya and Mamoru Kawaguchi who conceived it as a huge space frame. Kawaguchi invented a welding-free ball joint to safely distribute the load and worked out a method of assembling the frame on the ground before raising it using jacks.

Kikutake&#x27;s Expo Tower was situated on the highest hill in the grounds and acted as a landmark for visitors. It was built of a vertical ball and joint space onto which was attached a series of cabins. The design was to have been a blueprint for flexible vertical living based upon a 360m3 standard construction cabin clad with a membrane of cast aluminium and glass that could be flexibly arranged anywhere on the tower. This was demonstrated with a variety of cabins that were observation platforms and VIP rooms and one cabin at ground level that became an information booth.

Kurokawa had won commissions for two corporate pavilions: the Takara Beautillion and the Toshiba IHI pavilion. The former of these was composed of capsules plugged onto six point frames and was assembled in just six days; the latter was a space frame composed of tetrahedron modules, based upon his Helix City that could grow in 14 different directions and resemble organic growth.

Expo &#x27;70 has been described has the apotheosis of the Metabolist movement. But even before Japan&#x27;s period of rapid economic growth ended with the world energy crisis, critics were calling the Expo a dystopia that was removed from reality. The energy crisis demonstrated Japan&#x27;s reliance both on imported oil and led to a re-evaluation of design and planning with architects moving away from utopian projects towards smaller urban interventions.

==Later years==

After the 1970 Expo, Tange and the Metabolists turned their attention away from Japan towards the Middle East and Africa. These countries were expanding on the back of income from oil and were fascinated by both Japanese culture and the expertise that the Metabolists brought to urban planning. Tange and Kurokawa capitalised on the majority of the commissions, but Kikutake and Maki were involved too.

Tange&#x27;s projects included a 57,000 seat stadium and sports center in Riyadh for King Faisal, and a sports city for Kuwait for the planned 1974 Pan Arab Games. However, both were put on hold by the outbreak of the Fourth Arab–Israeli War in 1973. Likewise, the plan for a new city center in Tehran was cancelled after the 1979 revolution. He did however complete the Kuwaiti Embassy in Tokyo in 1970 and Kuwait&#x27;s International Airport, as well as the Presidential Palace in Damascus, Syria.

Kurokawa&#x27;s work included a competition win for Abu Dhabi&#x27;s National Theatre (1977), capsule-tower designs for a hotel in Baghdad (1975) and a city in the desert in Libya (1979–1984).

Kikutake&#x27;s vision for floating towers was partly realised in 1975 when he designed and built the Aquapolis for the Okinawa Ocean Expo. The 100 x 100 meter floating city block contained accommodation that included a banquet hall, offices and residences for 40 staff and it was built in Hiroshima and then towed to Okinawa. Further unbuilt floating city projects were undertaken, including a floating city in Hawaii for ocean research and a plug-in floating A-frame unit containing housing and offices that could have been used to provide mobile homes in the event of a natural disaster.

<text>Menoceras (&quot;Crescent Horns&quot;) is a genus of extinct, small rhinocerotids endemic to most of southern North America and ranged as far south as Panama during the early Miocene epoch. It lived from around 30.7—19.7 Ma, existing for approximately .

==Description==
&quot;Menoceras&quot; was much smaller than any living rhinoceros, with the genus being compared in size to a sheep or a pig, an with estimated bodymass of . Male &quot;Menoceras&quot; sported two horns side by side at the tip of the nose, whereas the females were hornless or had greatly reduced horns, and have differently shaped nasal bones. &quot;Menoceras&quot; along with &quot;Diceratherium&quot; is unique in having paired horns among rhinocerotids. Both sexes of &quot;Menoceros&quot; grew to a length of long.

==Paleobiology==
&quot;Menoceras&quot; roamed across a tropical, savanna-like grassland and plains environment that covered much of North America. Because of the massive accumulations of fossil bones of this animal, particularly at Agate Springs Nebraska, &quot;Menoceras&quot; may have lived in large herds. Other sites include Martin-Anthony site Martin County, Florida, and Cady Mountains Horse Quarry, San Bernardino County, California.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Menoceras&quot; was named by Troxell and assigned to Rhinocerotidae in 1921. It was synonymized subjectively with &quot;Diceratherium&quot; by Matthew in 1931 and Wood in 1964. Again assigned to Rhinocerotidae by Prothero, Guerrin, Manning in 1989. Tanner (1969), Wilson and Schiebout (1981), Prothero and Manning (1987), Carroll (1988) and Prothero et al. (1989); and to Menoceratinae by Prothero (1998).

==Fossil distribution==

Fossil distribution is as far north as New Jersey, south to Florida (3 collections) and Texas (6 collections), as far west as Nebraska (7 collections) and California (2 collections).

The Panamanian find was determined to be 19.7 Ma (AEO). It was found in the Gaillard Cut in Panama in &quot;a 45 m thick section (narrow stratigraphic interval)&quot; It was reposited in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.
Other sites: 
*Lay Ranch Beds, Goshen County, Wyoming, a deposit of several carnivores and herbivores.
*Agate Springs Quarries, Sioux County, Nebraska, a deposit of Miocene herbivores and carnivores such as &quot;Moropus elatus&quot;, &quot;Cynelos&quot;, &quot;Cephalogale&quot;, and a number of Artiodactyla.
*Martin Canyon Quarry A, Logan County, Colorado, a very substantial number of carnivores and herbivores.

<text>USS &quot;Tattnall&quot; (DD–125) was a &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first ship named for Captain Josiah Tattnall III.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; was laid down at Camden, New Jersey, on 1 December 1917 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 5 September 1918; sponsored by Miss Sarah Campbell Kollock; and commissioned on 26 June 1919.

==Service history==
Following trials off the New England coast, &quot;Tattnall&quot; sailed for the eastern Mediterranean. She arrived at Constantinople on 27 July and, for almost a year, operated in Turkish waters. During that time, she also visited ports in Egypt, Greece, Russia, and Syria transporting passengers and mail. In June 1920, the destroyer began her return voyage to the United States. During the voyage home, she was designated DD-125 on 17 July 1920 when the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of 125 designations. She stopped at ports in Italy and France before entering New York harbor on 22 July. Following overhaul, &quot;Tattnall&quot; put to sea to join the Pacific Fleet. After port calls along the southern coast of the United States and at ports in Cuba, Nicaragua, Mexico, and the Panama Canal Zone, she reached San Diego on 17 December. The warship operated along the California coast until 15 June 1922, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Diego.

On 1 May 1930, &quot;Tattnall&quot; was recommissioned. The warship served with the Battle Force along the west coast until 1931. By 1 July of that year, she had been transferred to the United States East Coast for duty with the Scouting Force Destroyers as a unit of Destroyer Division 7.

A year later, &quot;Tattnall&quot;″s activity was curtailed by her assignment to the rotating reserve. On 1 January 1934, the destroyer resumed a more active role with the Fleet when she began a year of duty with the Scouting Force Training Squadron. Following another period of relative inactivity in rotating reserve, she rejoined the Training Squadron late in 1935. During the latter part of 1937, the Training Detachment, United States Fleet, was established; and &quot;Tattnall&quot; and the other units of the Scouting Force Training Squadron joined the new organization. The destroyer continued her training duties until November 1938.

===World War II===
On 17 November 1938, she and relieved and as units of the Special Service Squadron. &quot;Tattnall&quot; was based in the Canal Zone until the squadron was disbanded on 17 September 1940. The warship, however, continued to operate in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea out of her home port at Panama. After the United States entered World War II, &quot;Tattnall&quot; began escorting coastwise convoys in her area of operations, frequently through the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola, a dangerous area during the height of the Caribbean U-boat blitz. Though she made many sonar contacts and depth charge attacks, &quot;Tattnall&quot; registered no confirmed kills.

Early in July 1943, the destroyer escorted her last Caribbean convoy north from the Windward Passage to Charleston, South Carolina. She arrived on the 10th, began conversion to a high-speed transport at the navy yard, and was redesignated APD-19 on 24 July. On 6 September 1943, the day following the 25th anniversary of her launching, &quot;Tattnall&quot; completed conversion. She finished her shakedown cruise in mid-September. Following post-shakedown repairs and alterations in late September, the high-speed transport began amphibious training—first, at Cove Point, Maryland, and later, at Fort Pierce, Florida.

In April 1944, &quot;Tattnall&quot; was designated flagship of Transport Division (TransDiv) 13, the only high-speed transport division in the Atlantic theater. On 13 April, she departed the U.S. East Coast for Oran, Algeria, in company with , , , and . TransDiv 13 joined the 8th Fleet at the end of April, and &quot;Tattnall&quot; moved to Corsica to practice for her first assignment, the capture of Elba and Pianosa Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea. However, before the invasion and during her training period, &quot;Tattnall&quot; was called upon to feign a landing near Civitavecchia, Italy, north of Rome, to draw off German reinforcements headed south to turn back the American forces breaking through at Monte Cassino and heading for Rome. The ruse apparently worked. The reinforcements never reached Monte Cassino; and, on the following day, German radio announced an Allied invasion north of Rome.

On 17 June, the invasion troops went ashore on Elba and Pianosa. &quot;Tattnall&quot;″s boats came under machine gun fire, but suffered no serious damage. After the landings in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the high-speed transport began convoy duty between Italian, Sicilian, and North African ports. Following that duty, she resumed amphibious operations, this time with members of the American-Canadian 1st Special Service Force embarked. Their mission was to capture the heavily fortified Hyeres Islands, located just east of Toulon, and hold them during the main landings in the invasion of southern France. On 15 August, the five ships of TransDiv 13 rapidly put 1,600 troops ashore, and the islands were secured within three days. During the next two weeks, &quot;Tattnall&quot; and her sister transports shuttled reinforcements and supplies into southern France and evacuated Allied wounded and German prisoners of war. For the remainder of the year, the high-speed transport escorted convoys between ports in the Mediterranean Sea.

&quot;Tattnall&quot; returned to the United States at Norfolk on 21 December and began a month-long availability period before heading for the Pacific. She got underway from Hampton Roads on 31 January 1945. After transiting the Panama Canal early in February and making stops at San Diego, Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Ulithi, the fast transport reached the Okinawa area on 19 April.

The high-speed transport remained in the Ryukyus through the end of the month. During that time, she stood guard on several of the screen stations which circled Okinawa to protect the units of the fleet from attack by &quot;kamikazes&quot;. &quot;Tattnall&quot; fired at enemy planes several times in the days preceding the night of 29 April and 30 April.

Three red alerts before 0200 failed to materialize into enemy attacks. However, at about 0215, bogies began closing in from the west. A twin-engined plane crossed &quot;Tattnall&quot;″s stern from about 3,000 yards, and her 40 mm gun crews opened fire. The attacker retired to her starboard quarter with one engine ablaze, only to renew its attack. This time, her gunners finished the job they had begun on its first pass, and it crashed into the sea. Soon thereafter, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; approached the warship from starboard. &quot;Tattnall&quot;, her engines at full speed, turned hard to port to evade the attacker. It splashed down close to her starboard bow. Debris rained down on &quot;Tattnall&quot; and pierced her above the waterline, but she suffered neither casualties nor serious damage.

The following day, &quot;Tattnall&quot; departed Okinawa and headed for the Mariana Islands and convoy escort duty. She arrived at Saipan on 3 May and returned with a convoy to Okinawa on the 20th. The warship resumed picket duty but experienced no more action like that of the night of 29 April and 30 April. To be sure, her crew stood long watches and, on 25 May, was at general quarters for 18 hours straight. On that day, &quot;Barry&quot; and &quot;Roper&quot; were hit by &quot;kamikazes&quot;. &quot;Barry&quot; later sank, and &quot;Roper&quot; was sent to a rear area for repairs.

Early in June, &quot;Tattnall&quot; was ordered to report for duty with the Philippine Sea Frontier. She stopped at Saipan on 13 June and reached Leyte on the 17th. Through the end of the war and for almost a month thereafter, she conducted patrols in the Philippines and escorted convoys to Ulithi and Hollandia. On 13 September, &quot;Tattnall&quot; headed back to the United States. After stops at Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, the fast transport arrived in San Francisco on 30 October.

From there, she was routed north to the Puget Sound Navy Yard and disposition by the Commandant, 13th Naval District. &quot;Tattnall&quot; was decommissioned at Puget Sound on 17 December 1945. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 8 January 1946. She was sold to the Pacific Metal Salvage Company, of Seattle, Washington, on 17 October 1946 and scrapped. Her hull was towed to Royston, British Columbia and beached as part of a breakwater, parts of her hull are still visible in 2009.

==Awards==
&quot;Tattnall&quot; received three battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="1070606" wikidata="Q5305754" url="?curid=1070606" title="Dramarama">
<text>Dramarama is an American, New Jersey–based alternative rock/power pop band, who later moved to Los Angeles. The band was formed in New Jersey in 1982 and disbanded in 1994. The band formally reunited in 2003 following an appearance on VH1&#x27;s &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;.

Since 1996, an evolving lineup of the band, always fronted by singer/songwriter John Easdale, has been performing in one incarnation or another (initially billed as Easdale solo but usually joined by former Dramarama bandmates), and from then until 2003 played occasional shows in Los Angeles as well as in New Jersey. However, amid renewed interest since the episode on &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; in January 2004 and a large-scale appearance at KROQ-FM&#x27;s annual Inland Invasion festival concert (attended by more than 78,000 fans) in September 2003, Dramarama then toured nationally and released a full-length CD titled &quot;Everybody Dies&quot; on October 25, 2005. Fifteen years later, they released the album &quot;Color TV&quot;.

==History==
===1981–1994===
In 1982, Dramarama formed in the basement of a record store in Wayne, New Jersey, owned by founding member Chris Carter. Carter operated the alternative record store Looney Tunez Records (previously known as Dirt Cheap Records). Initially the line-up consisted of singer/songwriter John Easdale, &quot;Mr. E Boy&quot; (Mark Englert) and Carter, later joined by Peter Wood on guitars and Ron Machuga on drums.

The evolution and combined efforts prompted the emergence of the DPW (a local parody named in honor of their hometown Department of Public Works) and re-incarnation &quot;The F&amp;cks&quot;. The band emerged in North New Jersey, where at that time there was a scene with radio station WHTG 106.3 and venues such as The Stone Pony, Green Parrot and Fast Lane featuring other local bands such as Red House, Smithereens, Whirling Dervishes and The Blases. In 1982, the band released its first single, &quot;You Drive Me&quot;, attracting some national attention.

In 1984, keyboard player Ted Ellenis and drummer Ken Moutenot (replacing Machuga) joined the band and Dramarama released their first EP &quot;Comedy&quot;, a self-funded, five-track debut that garnered both critical and unexpected cult praise in France. Moutenot was replaced by Jesse Farbman, who left the group after the band&#x27;s third album to pursue mind/body purity and to obtain &quot;philosophical and spiritual awareness&quot;. Dramarama issued its first full-length release, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Cinéma Vérité&quot; on France&#x27;s New Rose Records. It was re-released in the U.S. after receiving airplay on KROQ-FM radio from influential Los Angeles disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer (who at first thought the band was French). Bingenheimer alerted Posh Boy Records at New Rose, which approved Robbie Fields&#x27; contacting the band directly in New Jersey.

One of the early radio stations to play the song &quot;Anything, Anything (I&#x27;ll Give You)&quot; was KROQ. It was one of the station&#x27;s more requested songs in 1986 and 1987, and it became one of the more requested songs in the station&#x27;s history. Following the local L.A. success of &quot;Anything, Anything&quot;, the band obtained a larger advance from Chameleon and permanently moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles. The song was featured in &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master&quot; and was covered for the &quot;East Timor Benefit Album&quot;.

As an expression of gratitude to both Bingenheimer and Fields, the band gave Fields their recording of the New York Dolls&#x27; song &quot;Private World&quot; for inclusion on the CD &quot;The Best of Rodney on The Roq&quot;, released in 1987 and re-released in 1992 through Rhino Records.

The recording sessions for &quot;Stuck in Wonderamaland&quot; produced enough material for three albums. Easdale and Carter decided to again try a foreign release. Thus, &quot;Looking Through...&quot;, a 14-song album, was released in Europe by The Bent Backed Tulips, both pseudonym and album title in reference to lyrics from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Glass Onion&quot;. &quot;Looking Through...&quot; was re-released in the U.S. through eggBERT Records with extra tracks, increasing the number of songs to 20.

The band then signed with Chameleon distributor Elektra and released 1991&#x27;s &quot;Vinyl&quot;. Backed by a major label for the first time, Dramarama received nationwide airplay with the singles &quot;Haven&#x27;t Got a Clue&quot; (which also was on a CD included with the Sega CD video game system in the United States) and &quot;What Are We Gonna Do?&quot;. The album&#x27;s production with Don Smith added to the success of the LP. &quot;Vinyl&quot; included contributions from Mick Taylor, Jim Keltner, Benmont Tench, and Brian Macleod of Wire Train.

After &quot;Vinyl&quot;, a limited-edition, 17-song CD titled &quot;The Days of Wayne and Roses (The Trash Tapes)&quot; was made available to members of the Dramarama fan club. It included the band&#x27;s early recordings together as well as songs that were dropped from their early albums, a couple of live performances, and one song exclusive (at the time) to the disc.

The band&#x27;s final release on Elektra, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Hi-Fi Sci-Fi&quot;, was well received among both critics and fans. Clem Burke, who had joined the band for the &quot;Vinyl&quot; tour, appears on this album, and backing vocal contributions include Dwight Twilley and Sylvain Sylvain. After the tours, the group split.

===1995–2005===
Following two relatively quiet years after the 1994 breakup, John Easdale began performing live music again in 1996, doing shows in both New Jersey and the L.A. area. He assembled a band that he occasionally has named The John Easdale Group and has casually named it The Newcomers, featuring Dramarama&#x27;s Mark Englert, as well as Peter Wood for East Coast appearances. Other Newcomers have included fellow eggBERT alum Nick Celeste (of former Bongo Richard Barone&#x27;s band and once the frontman for In Color), Aimee Mann, Jules Shear, Muddy Shews, Danny Roselle, and Chris O&#x27;Hara. Easdale found steady players in Mike Davis, Tony Snow and Craig Ballam, who connected with Easdale circa 1996.

In 1998, Easdale released a solo album on the eggBERT label titled &quot;Bright Side&quot;, on which many of the tracks featured musicians with ties to both Dramarama and the Newcomers, including Mark Englert and Clem Burke, as well as Mike Davis, Tony Snow and Craig Ballam, who also contributed production and engineering skills. Before &quot;Bright Side&quot;, Easdale issued a fan-only, no-label version of the &quot;Bright Side&quot; in 1996 that contained versions of songs that made the final cut as well as some that did not. Easdale refers to it as his &quot;blueprint&quot; for the final collection, and fans call it the &quot;pre-release&quot; of &quot;Bright Side&quot;.

Following the publicity from the VH1 series &quot;Bands Reunited,&quot; their subsequent performance at KROQ&#x27;s Inland Invasion, and an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that lauded their retooling of the Dead Kennedys&#x27; politically charged &quot;California über alles&quot; in response to Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s 2003 run for governor of California, Easdale decided in late 2003 the band name Dramarama should continue. The next CD (an EP) would be billed to Dramarama, titled &quot;Absolutely, 100% Made in N.J.&quot;, which was recorded on a whim while Easdale and the band were on a brief tour of New Jersey in 2003. The EP&#x27;s liner notes indicated that most of the seven tracks were &quot;from the forthcoming Dramarama album &quot;Everybody Dies&quot;.&quot;

The album was released on October 25, 2005, by California-based label 33rd Street Records.

They appeared on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; as Ellen DeGeneres&#x27; 50th birthday present from her DJ Ted Stryker.

===2006–present===
The current lineup consists of original founding members Easdale, lead and rhythm guitar player Peter Wood (the only band member who moved back to New Jersey and still maintains a residence there), and lead guitarist Mark Englert (Mr. &quot;E&quot; Boy). Rounding out the band are Los Angeles–based musicians Tony Snow (of No Sugar and Shiteland Ponies) on drums, and (former Lizzy Borden member) Mike Davis on bass. In addition, Snow leads Tonio &amp; The Change, and Davis is the bass player for both Judas Priest frontman Rob Halford&#x27;s eponymous solo band Halford and metal &quot;supergroup&quot; Death Dealer.

The Dramarama song &quot;Anything Anything&quot; served as the title and theme song of New York City radio station WRXP-FM&#x27;s free-form program &quot;Anything Anything with Rich Russo&quot;. The version from &quot;Live at the China Club&quot; began each show. After the switch of format to all news on WRXP-FM, Russo&#x27;s radio show was picked up on WXPK-FM and WDHA-FM, where &quot;Anything Anything&quot; still served as the name and the China Club version opened each show.

The band has been very active since 2005. In 2009, they played for the Troy High School Battle of the Bands. This event took place on February 3, 2009 at Plummer Auditorium, located in Fullerton, California. Also in 2009 were several shows at House of Blues venues in Texas and Southern California as well as Six Flags Magic Mountain. Dramarama returned to New Jersey for two shows in November 2009 and performed in Downtown Los Angeles and San Juan Capistrano&#x27;s The Coach House in December 2009. They returned to Troy High School&#x27;s Battle of the Bands in 2010 and 2011.

A special live version of &quot;Last Cigarette&quot; was recorded for the limited-edition, 500-pressing vinyl album &quot;Anything Anything with Rich Russo on 101.9 RXP Presents Exclusive Live Performances&quot;. In this version, the band replaces the lyric &quot;Johnny Carson&quot; with &quot;Rich Russo&quot; as an homage to the free-form DJ. The album was released April 2010.

, Dramarama continued to perform frequently as headliners and at various festivals.

After a 15-year hiatus the band released &quot;Color TV&quot; on May 1, 2020.

===Post-Dramarama careers===
Original bass player/producer and Dramarama co-founder Chris Carter is currently a disc jockey in Los Angeles, where he hosts America&#x27;s longest-running Beatles show &quot;Breakfast with the Beatles&quot;, and the weekly four-hour eclectic program on the satellite radio station Sirius XM &quot;Chris Carter&#x27;s British Invasion.&quot; Carter also produced and wrote the film &quot;Mayor of the Sunset Strip&quot;, which in 2003 was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 19th Independent Spirit Awards, and which featured members of Dramarama. After Dramarama split in 1994, Carter formed QM Management, for which he manages the pop group The Wondermints, currently touring as Beach Boy Brian Wilson&#x27;s backing band.

Drummer Jesse Farbman, a.k.a. Anant Jesse, lived in Montreal, where he taught spiritual therapeutics and maintained a private practice; he died in 2014. Former keyboard player Theodore Ellenis works as senior finance executive for a New York City area firm.

<doc id="1070621" wikidata="Q659072" url="?curid=1070621" title="Dinosaur classification">
<text>Dinosaur classification began in 1842 when Sir Richard Owen placed &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Hylaeosaurus&quot; in &quot;a distinct tribe or suborder of Saurian Reptiles, for which I would propose the name of Dinosauria.&quot; In 1887 and 1888 Harry Seeley divided dinosaurs into the two orders Saurischia and Ornithischia, based on their hip structure. These divisions have proved remarkably enduring, even through several seismic changes in the taxonomy of dinosaurs.

The largest change was prompted by entomologist Willi Hennig&#x27;s work in the 1950s, which evolved into modern cladistics. For specimens known only from fossils, the rigorous analysis of characters to determine evolutionary relationships between different groups of animals (&quot;clades&quot;) proved incredibly useful. As computer-based cladistics matured in the 1990s, paleontologists were among the first zoologists to broadly adopt the system. Progressive scrutiny and work upon dinosaurian interrelationships, with the aid of new discoveries that have shed light on previously uncertain relationships between taxa, have begun to yield a stabilizing classification since the mid-2000s. While cladistics is the predominant classificatory system among paleontology professionals, the Linnean system is still in use, especially in works intended for popular distribution.

==Benton classification==
As most dinosaur paleontologists have advocated a shift away from traditional, ranked Linnaean taxonomy in favor of rankless phylogenetic systems, few ranked taxonomies of dinosaurs have been published since the 1980s. The following schema is among the most recent, from the third edition of &quot;Vertebrate Palaeontology&quot;, a respected undergraduate textbook. While it is structured so as to reflect evolutionary relationships (similar to a cladogram), it also retains the traditional ranks used in Linnaean taxonomy. The classification has been updated from the second edition in 2000 to reflect new research, but remains fundamentally conservative. 

Michael Benton classifies all dinosaurs within the Series Amniota, Class Sauropsida, Subclass Diapsida, Infraclass Archosauromorpha, Division Archosauria, Subdivision Avemetatarsalia, Infradivision Ornithodira, and Superorder Dinosauria. Dinosauria is then divided into the two traditional orders, Saurischia and Ornithischia. The dagger (†) is used to indicate taxa with no living members.

== Weishampel / Dodson / Osmólska classification==
The following is based on the second edition of &quot;The Dinosauria&quot;, a compilation of articles by experts in the field that provided the most comprehensive coverage of Dinosauria available when it was first published in 1990. The second edition updates and revises that work. 

The cladogram and phylogenetic definitions below reflect the current understanding of evolutionary relationships. The taxa and symbols in parentheses after a given taxa define these relationships. The plus symbol (&quot;+&quot;) between taxa indicates the given taxa is a node-based clade, defined as comprising all descendants of the last common ancestor of the &quot;added&quot; taxa. The greater-than symbol (&quot;&gt;&quot;) indicates the given taxon is a stem-based taxon, comprising all organisms sharing a common ancestor that is not also an ancestor of the &quot;lesser&quot; taxon.

==Baron / Norman / Barrett classification==
In 2017 Matthew G. Baron and his colleagues published a new analysis proposing to put Theropoda (except Herrerasauridae) and Ornithischia within a group called Ornithoscelida (a name originally coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in 1870), redefining Saurischia to cover Sauropodomorpha and Herrerasauridae. Amongst other things this would require hypercarnivory to have evolved independently for Theropoda and Herrerasauridae. This scheme is currently debated among palaeontologists, with recent studies finding little difference between the traditional and newly proposed models.
*Dinosauria
** Ornithoscelida
*** Ornithischia
*** Theropoda
** Saurischia
*** Sauropodomorpha
*** Herrerasauridae

== Cau 2018 ==
In his paper about the stepwise evolution of the avian bauplan, Cau (2018) found in the parsimony analysis a polytomy between herrerasaur-grade taxa, Sauropodomorpha and the controversial Ornithoscelida. The Bayesian analysis, however, found weak support for the sister grouping of Dinosauria and Herrerasauria, but strong support for the dichotomy between Sauropodomorpha and Ornithoscelida, as shown below:

<text>Lipetsk (, ), also romanized as Lipeck, is a city and the administrative center of Lipetsk Oblast, Russia, located on the banks of the Voronezh River in the Don basin, southeast of Moscow. Population: 

==History==
The name means &quot;Linden city&quot; and is cognate with Leipzig. In 1284, the city was destroyed by the Mongols.

The foundation of the modern city dates back to 1703, when Peter the Great ordered construction of a cast iron factory in Lipetsk near the iron ore deposits for making artillery shells. On September 27, 1779, Lipetsk was granted town status. It became one of the principal towns of Tambov Governorate.

In 1879, Lipetsk hosted a congress of members of Land and Liberty.

After the Treaty of Rapallo (1922) until 1933, the much-reduced German Army (&quot;Reichswehr&quot;) of the Weimar Republic secretly contracted with Soviet authorities to operate a clandestine military aviation base and test facility near Lipetsk – circumventing prohibitions of the Versailles Treaty. The base enabled technical collaboration by the two powers whose separate defeats in World War I left them isolated in post-war Europe. This activity inside the USSR took place away from the vigilant eyes of the victors.
The Abwehr, The SS and German Army Group Centre penetrated part of this Lindenstadt Region in 1941–2.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Lipetsk is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Lipetsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as Lipetsk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction—an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, Lipetsk City Under Oblast Jurisdiction is incorporated as Lipetsk Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
The principal industries of Lipetsk include ferrous metallurgy, machinery, metalworking, machine tools, engines, chemicals, food, and clothing.

The former steel combine was privatized in 1992 and Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK) with approximately 48,000 employees and a 64% export ratio (2005) is one of the largest employers in the oblast. In 2008, the company&#x27;s revenue was $11.7 billion. Other industry are another metallurgical plant &quot;Svobodny Sokol&quot; (&quot;Free Falcon&quot;), a tractor factory LTZ, solvent-extraction plant Liboil (largest rapeseed oil producer in Central Federal District and the second in Russia), pipe factory, a factory for refrigerators and household appliances, an ice factory, lathe factory, chemical factories, etc. Industry is mainly located south of the Voronezh River.

===Transportation===
Since 1868, there is a railway connection between Lipetsk and Moscow. Trams, trolleybuses and buses provide local public transportation. The municipality aspires to renovate the tramway network as it is largely segregated from motor traffic. It has negotiated a 10-year, RUR 30 billion loan from the European Bank of Reconstruction &amp; Development for tramway renewal.

===Health care===
Lipetsk is one of the oldest mud bath and balneological resorts in Russia (first opened in 1805). Peat mud and chalybeate bicarbonate calcic springs are used to treat patients. Sulphate and chloride sodium water is used for therapeutic baths and drinking.
==Education==
Lipetsk is home of the Lipetsk State Technical University, Lipetsk State Pedagogical University, and some other colleges.
==Military==
The Lipetsk air base is located north of the town. The 4th Center of Combat Application and Conversion of Frontline Aviation named after Valery Chkalov is situated in Lipetsk.

The Lipetsk Air Center&#x27;s chief, colonel Kharchevsky, has become famous after trial air combats in the United States and being a personal pilot of President Putin.

The city is also served by the smaller Lipetsk Airport.
On 24 February 2024, Ukraine claimed that its drones set fire to the Novolipetsk steel plant in Lipetsk. No casualties were reported however the facility was evacuated.

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Lipetsk is twinned with:

<doc id="1070635" wikidata="Q2688017" url="?curid=1070635" title="East Kennett">
<text>East Kennett is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, west of Marlborough. The United Kingdom Census 2011 recorded a parish population of 84.

The River Kennet forms most of the northern boundary of the parish, and the village lies close to the river. The neighbouring village of West Kennett is on the opposite bank a short distance upstream, in Avebury parish.

== History ==
Evidence of prehistoric activity includes a Neolithic long barrow, probably a communal burial site, on a hillside south of the present village; this monument is part of the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site. Further south, a circle of sarsen stones is possibly from the Bronze Age. The Ridgeway, an ancient trackway, passes through East Kennet village. Some 600 metres north of the village, at Overton Hill, the trackway becomes the Ridgeway National Trail which runs northeast as far as Buckinghamshire.

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded holdings in Chenete, the area which later became East and West Kennett. There was a church at East Kennett in the 12th century and by 1291 it was a separate parish.

A schoolhouse was built opposite the manor house in 1857 with support from Maria and Ann Mathews, daughters of the owner of the house. Maria gave a large endowment in 1878 and the school became known as Miss Mathews&#x27; School. After her death in 1882 it became a Church of England elementary school, and pupils of all ages attended until 1924 when older children transferred to Avebury or West Overton. In 1990 the school federated with the school at Lockeridge, as numbers at both schools were low; the combined school was named Kennet Valley and the East Kennet site housed the upper years, in buildings behind the original. This site closed in 2011 after accommodation at Lockeridge was increased.

The church benefice was united with Avebury in 1923; a further rearrangement in 1929 formed the benefice of Overton and Fyfield with East Kennett.

== Notable buildings ==
Manor Farmhouse, opposite the church, is dated 1630 with extensions added in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The older part is constructed from the local sarsen sandstone.

East Kennett Manor House is a three-storey brick house from the late 18th century, extended in the 19th century and again in 1925.
The Church of England parish church, Christ Church, was built in 1864 on the site of a 12th-century church. Today the parish is part of the Upper Kennet benefice.

<doc id="1070636" wikidata="Q738431" url="?curid=1070636" title="Stourton Caundle">
<text>Stourton Caundle is a village and civil parish in the county of Dorset in southwest England. It lies within the Blackmore Vale, about east of Sherborne. In the 2011 census the parish had 181 households and a population of 439.

Stourton Caundle is one of several settlements in the area to bear the name &quot;Caundle&quot;, the others being Bishop&#x27;s Caundle, Purse Caundle and Caundle Marsh. The origin of &quot;Caundle&quot; is uncertain. In the Domesday Book in 1086 there are seven Domesday entries connected to the village, recorded as &quot;Candelle&quot;, &quot;Candel&quot; or &quot;Candele&quot; in the hundred of Brunsell. The entries record a total of 45 households and a total taxable value of 17 geld units. Sir Henry de Haddon, a lord from Northamptonshire, bought land and founded a manor here in 1202, and the resultant settlement was called &quot;Caundel Haddon&quot; or &quot;Caundle Haddon&quot;. The Haddons retained the manor until 1461 when it passed to the Stourton family, which resulted in the current village name.

The manor was on the west side of the main village street and was probably fortified, resulting in it being referred to as a &#x27;castle&#x27;, though only a thirteenth-century chapel building (no longer used as such) and two fish ponds associated with the site now remain.

Stourton Caundle&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to St Peter and has a thirteenth-century nave and chancel, and a fourteenth-century tower.

The village was once a venue for stave dancing.

The village has a small pub called The Trooper, but villagers must travel to local town Stalbridge for other amenities.

Enid Blyton used Manor Farm as inspiration for her novel &quot;Five on Finniston Farm&quot;. She owned the farm for a short time in the late 1950s.

<text>Sturminster Marshall is a village and civil parish in the east of Dorset in England, situated on the River Stour between Blandford Forum and Poole. The parish had a population of 1,895 at the 2001 census, increasing to 1,969 at the 2011 Census and includes the village of Almer () west of Sturminster Marshall, near Winterborne Zelston and the hamlet of Henbury to the south-east of the village. The village is twinned with the French commune of Sainte-Mère-Église in Normandy. The appropriate electoral ward is called &#x27;Stour&#x27;. From &quot;Sturminster Marshall&quot; the ward goes east to Pamphill, with a total population of 2,582.

King Alfred the Great, in his will of 899, a copy of which can be seen at the British Library, left the village to his youngest son Æthelweard (c.880-922).

Sturminster Marshall has a 13th century church, St. Mary&#x27;s. Its predecessor contributed to the village&#x27;s name; &#x27;Sturminster&#x27; meaning &quot;church on the River Stour&quot;. The second part of the name came from William Marshall. Until 1857, St. Hubert&#x27;s Church in Corfe Mullen acted as a chapel of ease to Sturminster Marshall. St. Mary&#x27;s pre-reformation chalice, dating to 1536, has survived although the stem has been replaced. It is on loan to Dorset Museum.

==Village amenities==
Sturminster Marshall has a playing field with a children&#x27;s playground in one corner. Nearby is the Memorial Hall which offers a meeting-space for many village societies. There is also an old school hall which is also used as a meeting-space.

There are many walks around the village including the Stour Valley Way, which follows the Stour right from the source to the sea.

The village has two pubs: the Red Lion within the village and the Golden Fox on the outskirts.

The village has a cricket club with a side in Dorset division 3. There is also a football club with a senior side and several junior teams.

==Landmarks==
===Church of St Mary the Virgin===
The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church date from the 12th century, with 13th, 14th and 15th century additions. The three-stage west tower was rebuilt in 1805 and the whole building was heavily restored in 1859. The monuments and brasses inside the church are mainly 19th century, but there is a 17th century funeral helm and a 14th century coffin slab with a Latin inscription: &quot;Quisquis ades qui morte cades, sta, perlege, plora. Sum quod eris, fueram quod es. Pro me precor, ora&quot;. It is a Grade II* listed building.

===White Mill Bridge===
Crossing the River Stour to the east of the village is a 16th century stone bridge of eight arches. The later parapet overhangs the bridge sides on corbels. An early 19th century iron plaque threatens anyone damaging the bridge with penal transportation. It is a Grade I listed building.

<text>Poincaré is a large lunar impact basin that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. Most of the formation has been heavily eroded by subsequent impacts, leaving a battered formation with only rugged remnants of the original outer rim to the west.

The eastern half has been completely worn away, and much of the interior has been resurfaced by lava flows. This surface has a lower albedo than the surrounding terrain, giving it a dark appearance. A rugged formation forms a low north–south range across the eastern section of the floor, possibly the remnant of an inner ring.

The perimeter of Poincaré has several notable craters. To the north is the crater Hopmann, while the craters Abbe and Hess lie to the east. Directly to the west is Planck, a walled plain of similar dimensions to Poincaré. Both formations are sufficiently large to have formed a small lunar mare on the near side face of the Moon.

The basin&#x27;s name was adopted in 1970 by the IAU.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Poincaré.

<doc id="1070649" wikidata="Q2314940" url="?curid=1070649" title="Liberty (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Liberty is the sixth studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 20 August 1990 by Parlophone. The album reached number eight on the UK Albums Chart, and spawned the singles &quot;Violence of Summer (Love&#x27;s Taking Over)&quot; and &quot;Serious&quot;. The album has received negative reviews from critics, citing poor songwriting and a lack of musical direction.

==Background==
Duran Duran had emerged as one of the most successful bands of the 1980s, helping to both spearhead the so-called &#x27;Second British Invasion&#x27; of the American charts and making increasingly striking music videos to promote their singles via MTV. By the mid 1980s, however, the band had lost both Roger and Andy Taylor, who had quit shortly after their 1985 Live Aid performance. Subsequent studio albums released including &quot;Notorious&quot; and &quot;Big Thing&quot; were not well received either critically or commercially, selling in far fewer quantities than their predecessors. Whilst the 1989 &quot;Decade&quot; compilation managed to chart in the Top 10 around the world, it was seen as a temporary stop-gap and an opportunity for the band to decide what musical direction they wanted to explore in the 1990s.

==Writing and recording==
Vocalist Simon Le Bon commented, &quot;We went into a barn in Sussex and started jamming away, and before we got finished, it was like, &#x27;Right we&#x27;ve got the album, let&#x27;s go and record it now.&#x27; And I don&#x27;t think we got it right; I don&#x27;t think we were paying enough attention. We were quite self-conscious at the time as well, the way things had been going, and it kind of made us stand outside of ourselves to do the album. But out of that came two of the best songs Duran&#x27;s ever come up with, &#x27;Serious&#x27; and &#x27;My Antarctica&#x27;, they&#x27;re really, really beautiful songs. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad album, but there&#x27;s definitely weak spots on it, definitely. I mean, something like &#x27;Violence of Summer&#x27;, it just didn&#x27;t have a proper chorus, great verse though. Just not paying enough attention, we just lost our concentration.&quot; Ultimately though, he proved to be quite sanguine about the album as a whole, stating on its 25th anniversary in 2015: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go back and change anything though, I&#x27;d rather spend two weeks writing a new song than making changes to &quot;Liberty&quot;. It was a point in time for Duran Duran. I really do look back on &quot;Liberty&quot; with a lot of fondness.&quot;

According to John Taylor, the recording sessions dragged as the band members were unsure of the album&#x27;s direction. Le Bon also suffered from writer&#x27;s block and devoted more time to his wife and newborn daughter than recording. &quot;Liberty&quot; was the first Duran Duran album to credit guitarist Warren Cuccurullo as an official member. It is also drummer Sterling Campbell&#x27;s sole credit as an official member of the band, as he left following the album&#x27;s release.

A bootleg recording of the demo sessions for the album, titled &quot;Didn&#x27;t Anybody Tell You?&quot; surfaced in 1999. Many unreleased, scrapped songs from the &quot;Liberty&quot; sessions were heard by the public for the first time:

*&quot;Bottleneck&quot;
*&quot;Money on Your Side&quot;
*&quot;Dream Nation&quot;
*&quot;In Between Woman&quot;
*&quot;Worth Waiting For&quot;
*&quot;My Family&quot; (played live 1989)

When asked about the bootleg, John Taylor said, &quot;I like coming across things that I&#x27;ve forgotten about. That I&#x27;ve forgotten that we recorded. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s really exciting about the &quot;Didn&#x27;t Anybody Tell You&quot; bootleg, because there&#x27;s so many songs on there that never got finished. They just take me back to that moment. Actually, what I like about that album is that the &quot;Liberty&quot; album—when we were rehearsing it, when we were writing it was gonna be a great album. I really felt it was gonna be a great album. When we got in the studio I fell apart and the production just wasn&#x27;t right. It turned out to be a very mediocre album, but at the demo stage, which is what that [bootleg] album is all about, I think there&#x27;s a great album in there. Could have been great songs.&quot;

In an interview discussing the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary, Le Bon looked back on &quot;Liberty&quot; fondly, giving high praise to songs such as &quot;Serious&quot;, &quot;My Antarctica&quot; and &quot;Venice Drowning&quot;, ultimately saying, &quot;I think the issue with &quot;Liberty&quot; is that we were in a transition and there were some tracks that didn&#x27;t have our whole heart in it.&quot;

==Release==
The lead single, &quot;Violence of Summer (Love&#x27;s Taking Over)&quot;, was released on 23 June 1990, debuting at number 23 in the UK but failing to reach the top 60 in the US. The band themselves did not have faith in the single. In a 2020 interview with Paul Sinclar, the editor of website Super Deluxe Edition, Kimsey noted that either the songs &quot;Serious&quot; or &quot;Liberty&quot; should have been lead singles and the whole album may have seen more commercial success.

Released on 20 August 1990, &quot;Liberty&quot; reached number eight in the UK before falling off the chart quickly. It fared similarly in the US, reaching number 46 before dropping off. &quot;Serious&quot; was released as the second single on 5 November 1990, failing to break the UK top 40. The band did not tour for &quot;Liberty&quot;, instead making brief promotional trips to Australia, New Zealand and Florence. Four months after the album&#x27;s release, Capitol Records scrapped plans for music videos for proposed singles &quot;First Impression&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot;.

==Reception==

Critical reception to &quot;Liberty&quot; was mainly negative with a number of music journalists slating the album; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; magazine described it as &quot;a senseless collision of tuneless guitar raunch, Motown-inflected soul-pop and numbing dance grooves&quot; whilst &quot;Q Magazine&quot;″s reviewer Andrew Martin suggested that only three tracks—&quot;Liberty&quot;, &quot;Serious&quot; and &quot;My Antarctica&quot;—were worthy of inclusion, a view echoed in 2020 by producer Chris Kimsey, who said: &quot;if you took all the crap off this album and had an EP, it would have been huge[...] the other stuff was, like, panic, pressure.&quot;

A positive review appeared in &quot;Spin&quot; in November 1990. Reviewer Mark Blackwell wrote &quot;&quot;Liberty&quot; shows the band in its most appealing form in years (...) Duran Duran once again successfully straddle the line between dance and rock&quot;. Blackwell noted that &quot;the new songs are characteristically slick, yet stripped-down. Effects and samples are minimal. The guitar is prominently back and the music is diverse&quot;, while admitting that &quot;a couple of the songs, like &#x27;Hothead&#x27;, are stupid and meaningless.&quot;

Later reviews have been mostly negative, with the author Steve Malins calling &quot;Liberty&quot; Duran Duran&#x27;s worst album. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album lacked direction and featured no material that lives up to the band&#x27;s best work, arguing that it failed to meet the finest moments on &quot;Big Thing&quot;. &quot;Classic Pop&quot; called the album &quot;overproduced and underwritten&quot; and a record that even hardcore Duran Duran fans fail to defend.

<text>West Lulworth is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset, situated on the English Channel beside Lulworth Cove. In the 2011 census the civil parish—which includes most of Lulworth Camp army base—had 291 households and a population of 714. The village is a gateway to the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site and is a popular tourist destination, especially for day trips.

==History==
In 1086 in the Domesday Book West Lulworth was not distinguished from neighbouring East Lulworth; only one settlement was recorded, called &quot;Luluorde&quot;, &quot;Luluworde&quot; or &quot;Loloworde&quot;. It had 38.3 households, was in Winfrith Hundred and the lord and tenant-in-chief was Aiulf the chamberlain. Despite this, East and West Lulworth may have been separate settlements at this time, and definitely were so by the end of the 13th century.

The Castle Inn is one of the oldest pubs in Dorset, dating from the 16th century. Holy Trinity parish church was originally in the village centre, but was demolished in 1869 although the old churchyard still remains. The present church, built of local stone taken from the cove, replaced it. It was largely financed by the then incumbent Rev. William Gildea, brother of philanthropist Sir James Gidea.
From the late seventeenth to the mid nineteenth century smugglers used Lulworth Cove and other bays and beaches nearby. The building of coastguard cottages, which housed the customs officers still stand above the cove. Lulworth at one point had a mill, powered by water from a nearby spring. It was burnt down during the 19th century and all that remains of its existence is the millpond.

West Lulworth is also the location of the only building designed by the eminent architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in the county of Dorset. Weston was built in 1927 for the surgeon Sir Alfred Downing Fripp after he was left a legacy by a friend.

==Geography==
West Lulworth civil parish covers . The underlying geology is mostly chalk, with a strip of Portland limestone along the coast. At Lulworth Cove the sea has breached the limestone and eroded the soft Wealden Beds behind, resulting in the circular shape of the cove.

West Lulworth village is dominated by two hills: to the east is Bindon Hill, a high ridge, which has extensive remains of Iron Age earthworks. To the west is Hambury Tout, which has a barrow on its rounded top.
West Lulworth village is about north of Lulworth Cove, a picturesque, sheltered bay enclosed almost in a circle. The natural limestone arch of Durdle Door is west along the coast from Lulworth Cove. About west of the cove is Stair Hole, a geological formation of caves with blowholes.

==Amenities==
West Lulworth village has a first school, a youth hostel, several small hotels, pubs and a general store. Commercial fishing is based at the cove, together with scallop diving and leisure trips. The stores and hotels line the route between the town and the cove, with several small stores selling locally caught seafood.

==Governance==
West Lulworth is part of West Purbeck electoral ward. This ward extends northwards from the Cove to East Stoke and the intermediate area. The total population of the ward at the 2011 Census was 1,464. West Purbeck ward is part of the UK Parliamentary Constituency for South Dorset.

==Transport==
West Lulworth is the terminus of the B3070 road which runs from the A352 road at Wool. The nearest rail access is also from Wool railway station. Scheduled buses run to Weymouth and Poole. Transport and car parking infrastructure has been a problem for the village in recent decades due to the volume and seasonal nature of the tourist traffic, with reported problems including car parks overflowing and traffic blocking emergency access.

<doc id="1070664" wikidata="Q3337808" url="?curid=1070664" title="Wimborne St Giles">
<text>Wimborne St Giles is a village and civil parish in east Dorset, England, on Cranborne Chase, north of Wimborne Minster and north of Poole. The village lies within the Shaftesbury estate, owned by the Earl of Shaftesbury. A tributary of the River Allen, formerly known as the Wimborne, snakes its way through the village.

The village of St Giles was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Wimborne St Giles was established in 1733, when the St Giles and All Hallows parishes were merged at the request of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. In 2001 the population was 366, served by the village hall, post office, parish church, and a primary school. Recreational enterprises include commercial shooting, a trout farm, and fly fishing on the River Allen. The village is largely agricultural, with residents generally commuting to nearby cities and towns for employment.

== History ==
Wimborne St Giles is a hundred and parish located in the wooded valley of the River Allen, near the royal hunting ground of Cranborne Chase. As originally divided, various parishes and villages resided within the hundred, including the parishes of West Woodyates, St Giles, and All Hallows. The tithing of All Hallows is located in the village, as well as the eponymous parish of Wimborne St Giles.

== St Giles House ==
Early property owners in St Giles included the Malmayne family. Matilda Malmayne, heiress of the Malmayne estate, married Edmund Plecy. Ownership of the estate encompassing the present-day St Giles House has not changed hands through purchase since the Norman Conquest. In 1375, the manor estate was known as St Giles Upwymbourne Plecy.

The Plecy male line became extinct towards the end of the 14th century, and the estate was transferred to Edmund and Matilda&#x27;s descendant Joan Plecy, as heiress. Lady Joan Plecy was soon married to Sir John Hamelyn (d. 1399), high sheriff of Somerset. When Hamelyn died, there were no male heirs. The estate went to Sir John&#x27;s daughter Egidia, by his second wife, who married Robert Ashley. The family estate, initially known as the Ashley Manor, has belonged to the Ashleys and Ashley-Coopers ever since.

The cornerstone of St Giles House, home to the Earls of Shaftesbury, was laid by Sir Anthony Ashley-Cooper, then 2nd Baronet, later 1st Earl of Shaftesbury on 19 March 1650. The country house was built on the remains of Ashley Manor. Incorporating late medieval work in the basement and cellars, the continued construction of the main body of St Giles House was initiated in 1651.

== Parish church ==

When the Earl of Shaftesbury built a new country house close to St Giles, the writing was on the wall for All Hallows. In 1672, Sir Anthony wrote to the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, offering to give Charles II a living of his choice in exchange for being allowed to close down the living of All Hallows and concentrate worship at St Giles. The 1st earl&#x27;s request to the king was granted in 1733, at which time, the St Giles and All Hallows parishes were merged and took the name of Wimborne St Giles. The name is derived from the meadow stream which flows through both villages, from Old English &quot;winn&quot; and &quot;burna&quot;. Saint Giles being an 8th-century hermit of Provençal origin.

In 1742, All Hallows church was demolished, leaving only the lychgate and churchyard. While the parish was centralised in Wimborne St Giles, the churchyard at All Hallows continued to be used for burials up to the end of the 19th century, because there was no room for a burial ground at St Giles church. The church was restored in 1852. In the early 20th century, a new cemetery was opened on the opposite side of road to the All Hallows graveyard. Many of the Earls of Shaftesbury are buried in Wimborne St Giles church, in the family crypt.

The bow of Eros (properly Anteros) in Piccadilly Circus, London was originally positioned to point towards Wimborne St Giles, the country seat of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury, in commemoration of his philanthropic works.

The church has a plaque in commemoration of robins who nested in the altar in 1887 and again in 1908.

<text>The National University of San Marcos (, UNMSM) is a public research university located in Lima, the capital of Peru. In the Americas, it is the first officially established (privilege by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) and the oldest continuously operating university.

The university started in the general studies that were offered in the convent of the Rosario of the order of Santo Domingo—the current Basilica and Convent of Santo Domingo—in around 1548. Its official foundation was conceived by Fray Thomas de San Martín on May 12, 1551; with the decree of Emperor Charles I of Spain and V of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1571, it acquired the degree of pontifical granted by Pope Pius V, with which it ended up being named the &quot;Royal and Pontifical University of the City of the Kings of Lima&quot;. It is also referred to as the &quot;University of Lima&quot; throughout the Viceroyalty.

Throughout its history, the university had a total of four colleges under tutelage: the Colegio Real y Mayor de San Martín and the Colegio Real y Mayor de San Felipe y San Marcos, the Real Colegio de San Carlos—focused on law and letters, derived from the merger of the two previous ones—and the Royal College of San Fernando—focused on medicine and surgery.

The University of San Marcos has passed through several locations, of which it maintains and stands out: the &quot;Casona de San Marcos&quot;, one of the buildings in the Historic Center of Lima that were recognized as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO in 1988. The University of San Marcos has 66 professional schools, grouped into 20 faculties, and these in turn in 5 academic areas. Through its &quot;Domingo Angulo&quot; historical archive, the university preserves documents and writings. In 2019, the &quot;Colonial Fund and Foundational Documents of the National University of San Marcos: 1551–1852” was incorporated into the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.

The National University of San Marcos is currently the leading Peruvian institution in scientific production, both annually and cumulatively throughout history. It has also achieved the top position nationally in various editions of academic university rankings, being one of the three Peruvian universities to ever reach such a position and the only public one to do so. It holds a ten-year institutional licensing granted by the National Superintendency of Higher Education (SUNEDU) and an international institutional accreditation. To date, twenty-one Presidents of the Republic of Peru, seven Peruvian candidates for the Nobel Prizes in Physics, Literature, and Peace, and the only Peruvian Nobel Prize laureate have been alumni or professors of this institution. Due to its historical and academic significance, the National University of San Marcos is often referred to as the most important and representative educational institution in Peru.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
During the General Studies carried out in the cloisters of the Convent of the Rosario of the Order of Santo Domingo—current Basilica and Convento de Santo Domingo—in around 1548, the Lima town council would send Fray Tomás de San Martín and Captain Juan Jerónimo de Aliaga to Spain, who obtained the founding order of the university from Charles I of Spain and V of the Holy Roman Empire and Queen Juana I of Castile. The foundation of the Royal University of the City of Kings was officially carried out. The university began to function officially on January 2, 1553.

They asked the Royal Court for compliance with the Royal decree of 1570. The university moved to its second location, near the outskirts of San Marcelo, where the Convent of the Order of Saint Augustine had previously operated. On September 6, 1574, the official name of the university was chosen to be Royal and Pontifical University of San Marcos, and therefore Mark the Evangelist as the patron saint of the University. In 1575, the university changes its establishment again and is located in the old Plaza del Estanque.

The officially named University of San Marcos began its work in the viceregal era with the faculties of Theology and Arts, later the canons of Law and Medicine would be created. On November 27, 1579, the professors asked King Philip II for the institution of jurisdiction that governed the University of Salamanca. In 1581, Viceroy Francisco Álvarez de Toledo authorized clerics and laymen to be elected.

=== 1700s to 1900s ===
The support for the secularization of the University of San Marcos was given by Viceroy Francisco Álvarez de Toledo. It was also exercised by the rector of the Royal Convictory of San Carlos. Between 1792 and 1811, the amphitheater and medicine chairs began to develop in the Royal Hospital of San Andrés. Both the University of San Marcos and the College of Law and Letters of San Carlos and the College of Medicine of San Fernando began to be watched by the Viceroy because their house professors and students were suspected of envisioning.

The University of San Marcos became part of the current Republic of Peru since its independence in 1821. The First Constituent Congress of Peru was initially chaired by the former rector of the University of San Marcos, Toribio Rodríguez de Mendoza; of the 64 constituent deputies, 54 were San Marcos&#x27;s alumnus and Carolines&#x27;s. In 1822, the university handed over its collection of 50,000 books to form the National Library of Peru. In 1840, the Colleges of San Carlos and San Fernando are taken over by the University of San Marcos. San Marcos was empowered by the then President Ramón Castilla to approve new universities and control the newly created ones.

During the 1870s, the university moved to the Casona of San Marcos. During the War of the Pacific and specifically during the occupation of Lima by Chilean troops, art and cultural objects and assets were taken from the university in order to be taken to Chile by sea. At the end of the 19th century, the San Fernando Faculty of Medicine, which was located in a building in the old Plaza de Santa Ana, moved to its current location in the Orchard of Mestas. Once the war ended, by law of 1901, it is stated that Peruvian university education corresponds to the National University of San Marcos and the minor universities of Trujillo, Cusco, and Arequipa, which were later joined by the Catholic University of Lima and technical schools.

=== Modern history ===

At the beginning of the 20th century, university activists promoted a reform within the University of San Marcos. In 1909, the students had participated in protests against the Peruvian dictatorial governments. In 1916, the Federation of Students of Peru (FEP) was established, led mainly by students from San Marcos. The FEP&#x27;s demands included university reforms such as updating curricula, removing untrained faculty, and eliminating Peruvian government interference in the university. The university educational system was later reorganized and university autonomy was granted.

In 1946, the university&#x27;s name was made official as the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos. In 1951, as a commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the founding of the University of San Marcos, the university acquires a new piece of land to build the new University City, where the Stadium of the University of San Marcos was inaugurated that same year. A ceremony was also held that brought together the rectors of the main Ibero-American universities, who decided to give her the title of &quot;Dean of America&quot;. Due to this, the university has retained the names of the University of Peru and the Dean of the Americas.

In 1958, then Vice President Richard Nixon had scheduled a conference at the University of San Marcos as part of his visit to Latin America; however, this did not take place due to the protest of San Marcos, who spoke out against US policy in the region with phrases such as &quot;Nixon, Go Home!&quot;. The conference was transferred to the Catholic University of Lima.

In the mid-1960s, several faculties of the university began to move to the Ciudad Universitaria site, where 17 of the 20 faculties are currently located. On September 22, 1984, the current statute of the university was promulgated. It had nearly 40,000 students and more than 4,000 faculty. In 2010, a Nobel Prize was awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa, a students of the University of San Marcos. As a tribute, on March 30, 2011, the university distinguished Vargas Llosa with its highest decoration: the San Marcos Medal of Honor in the degree of Grand Cross. The ceremony was held in the Casona de San Marcos. In 2019, the university awards a doctoral degree based on a thesis written and defended entirely in Quechua.
=== University symbols ===
Since its foundation until 1574, the first official shield showed an image of the Virgen del Rosario, considered the patron saint of the Dominican friars; on the right, a representation of the Pacific Ocean; and below a lime—fruit, referring to the city of Lima. The coat of arms was approved by King Charles I of Spain in 1551. By the end of 1570, after the papal bull of Pius V, the coat of arms was modified, replacing the image of the Virgen del Rosario with that of the new patron of the university, the apostle Saint Mark and the Lion.

For the coat of arms, the documents about them in the century were black and white. It was not until 1929 that the colors, blue for the &#x27;ocean&#x27;, black or brown for the image of the saint, light blue for the background, and silver for the columns, became used. The second original shield with the image of San Marcos has been the longest-lasting symbol of the university. In 1929, the original colors were officially introduced: blue for the &#x27;ocean&#x27;, black or brown for the image of the saint, light blue for the background, and silver for the columns.

==== Flag ====

In ancient manuscripts, it was indicated that the university&#x27;s official banner was composed of major shields centered on a white background; this description gave rise to the appearance of banners and flags of the university that followed these patterns during the 17th to 19th centuries. Although the use of a white flag with the shield of the university in the center had already been generalized, its use was recently made official through a rectoral resolution on June 14, 2010.

==== Anthem ====
The university anthem is regularly performed at special ceremonies and anniversaries of the University of San Marcos, mainly by the University Choir. The lyrics of the anthem were composed by Manuel Tarazona Camacho, and the music by Luis Craff Zevallos.

The National University of San Marcos also mentions other symbolic documents for the university. Among them are the Royal Certificate by which King Charles I of Spain authorized the foundation of the university in 1551, and the Quipu found in the Huaca San Marcos.

==Organization==

===Governance and administration===
The University of San Marcos was originally governed by clerics of monastic orders; during the Age of Enlightenment, the Bourbon Reforms transformed it into a secular institution. The University Assembly is the highest governing body in the university. It is made up of the rector and the two vice-rectors, the deans of the faculties, the director of the graduate school, representatives of the teachers, and representatives of the students—which constitute a third of the total number of members of the assembly—representatives of the graduates, and the president of the Federation of students of the University of San Marcos with the right to speak, without a vote.

Administrative officials of the highest level can attend the assembly when they are required as advisors, without the right to vote.

In 1956, the faculty moved to its current location in San Borja. The Faculty of Psychology was created in 1963.

==== Basic Sciences ====
The Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering was created on April 7, 1855. The faculty was started by Antonio Raimondi and José Eboli. In 1946, then President José Luis Bustamante y Rivero promulgated Law 10555, which created the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of San Marcos. On April 24, 1964, the study of chemical engineering was introduced, with which the faculty acquired the current name of Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.
The Faculty of Biological Sciences became independent on March 15, 1866. In the 20th century, there was a reform of the biological sciences study program and the granting of the professional title of biologist was established. The Faculty of Physical Sciences was officially instituted in 1966. The Faculty of Mathematical Sciences began its operation in the year 1850. In 1862, it was called the Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics; in 1876, it was named the Faculty of Sciences. It is located in Ciudad Universitaria.

The School of Geographic Engineering was created on the next day on November 6, 1980. In 1983, the university assembly approved the creation of the Faculty of Geology, Mines, Metallurgy, Geographical Sciences, and Fluid Mechanics. In 2009 and 2014, the School of Civil Engineering and the School of Environmental Engineering were created respectively; this being the final conformation of the current Faculty of Geological, Mining, Metallurgical and Geographic Engineering.

The Faculty of Industrial Engineering was established in 1969. However, this program did not function independently until 1982. The Faculty of Electronic and Electrical Engineering was branched out from the electrical and electronic courses at the Faculty of Physical Sciences.

Faculty of Systems Engineering and Informatics&#x27;s main antecedent is the School of Computing, which was founded with the French government in the Faculty of Mathematical Sciences in 1969. In 1996, the school of Systems Engineering was created. On October 30, 2000, by rectory resolution, the Faculty of Systems Engineering and Informatics of the University of San Marcos was created.

==== Economics and Management Sciences ====

The Faculty of Administrative Sciences, the Faculty of Accounting Sciences, and the Faculty of Economic Sciences started as part of the studies at the Faculty of Political and Administrative Sciences. In 1920, the faculties were restructured and broken down. In 1984, the creation of an independent faculty for the study of administration was established, which is the current Faculty of Administrative Sciences.

==== Humanities, and Legal and Social Sciences ====
The Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences started from the faculties of theology and arts, which would later derive the Faculty of Letters. In 1854, under the government of Ramón Castilla, it adopted the name of Faculty of Philosophy and Humanities. In the 20th century, the faculty changed its name several times until 1965, when it was given the current name. It is currently located in the University City. The faculty is in charge of various research institutes and museums, such as the Museum of Art and the Language Center of the University of San Marcos.

The Faculty of Education started with the authorization of the then president of Peru, Manuel Pardo y Lavalle, at the Pedagogy on March 18, 1876. On December 14, 1925, the Pedagogy section was created in the Faculty of Letters.

It is located mainly in the University City; it also has the San Marcos Application College.In 1770, the historic Real Convictorio de San Carlos was founded—merging the existing San Felipe College of Law and the San Martín College of Philosophy and Law. On June 28, 1935, a new university statute was issued, in which it was called the Faculty of Law and Political Science. It has a free legal office for its service.

In 1969, with the promulgation of the Organic Law of the Peruvian University, the Department of Historical-Social Sciences is created. On September 24, 1984, in accordance with the University Law, a new administrative academic structure created the Faculty of Social Sciences. The faculty is in charge of the university&#x27;s Museum of Archeology and Anthropology.

==Academics==

===Admissions===
Admission for undergraduate studies is mainly through an entrance examination. Although there are ways to carry out a special exam in the case of transfers, foreigners, first places in schools, and the disabled. The most required type of exam is the one that is carried out twice a year: in March and in September.

In the case of postgraduate studies, admission is made through enrollment. As there are a limited number of vacancies, an admission exam is carried out that is prepared and graded by a special jury according to the area of study to which it is applied. In 2020, after the suspension of the first admission exam on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and after more than six months of not applying it, the University Council decided to approve the application of the online admission exam, being the first of its kind in the history of the university, on October 2 and 3 of that same year.

=== International programs ===
The University of San Marcos is actively involved in fostering international cooperation and engagement through various academic programs, research collaborations, and global partnerships. In addition, the university has counted as a main member of the Strategic Alliance of Peruvian Universities with agreements to achieve exchanges of undergraduate and postgraduate students from the three main Peruvian universities—UNMSM, UNI and UNALM—and others Peruvian universities as associated members.

===Rankings===
In the first national university ranking in Peru, prepared by the National Assembly of Rectors of Peru under the auspices of UNESCO in 2006, the National University of San Marcos ranked first in the country.

Together with the Cayetano Heredia University and the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, the National University of San Marcos is one of the only three Peruvian universities—and the only public one—that has managed to rank first nationally in certain editions of different major international university rankings.

In 2021, the Webometrics Ranking of World Universities of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) ranked the National University of San Marcos as the best university in the country in its first ranking of the year. In 2022, the university was awarded by the National Council of Science, Technology and Technological Innovation of Peru (Concytec) and the Elsevier corporation for being the institution with the historical highest number of scientific publications in Scopus (6,907), the largest bibliographic database of abstracts and citations of articles in all the universities of Peru.

==Campuses==
Since its foundation, the University of San Marcos has passed through five different main locations: From 16th to 19th centuries: the first location was located at the premises of the Convent of Nuestra Señora del Rosario of the Dominican Order; the second one was near the outskirts of San Marcelo, shortly before the Convent of the Order of San Agustín had functioned; the third—since 1575—was in the primitive Plaza del Estanque, the current location of the Congress of Peru.

In the second half of the 19th century, it was moved to the premises of the old Convictorio de San Carlos. At the end of the 19th century, the &quot;San Fernando&quot; Faculty of Medicine moved to its permanent location on the current Avenida Grau. Since the mid-1960s, during the government of Manuel Prado, the university began to occupy its main campus, the current Ciudad Universitaria, located between Avenida Universitaria and Avenida Venezuela. The rectory, the Central Library and 17 of the 20 faculties of the university are currently located there.

=== University city ===
Since 1966, the University City of the National University of San Marcos, generally known as &quot;University City of Lima&quot; or simply &quot;University City&quot;, is the main campus of the National University of San Marcos. In it are located 17 of the 20 faculties of the University of San Marcos, the Central Library, the Stadium of the University of San Marcos, and one of the university residences. In addition, the City includes the archaeological complex of Huaca San Marcos. The university has two residence halls for its two main campuses.

Since 2007, road works have been carried out outside the University City. The works were imposed by the former mayor, Luis Castañeda, of the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima. In 2008, specialists from the National University of Engineering and the CDL-College of Engineers of Peru reformulated the municipal works. The works have been stopped by a precautionary measure from the National Institute of Culture (INC) after verifying that these works damaged part of the cultural heritage in the Huaca San Marcos. In January 2011, the new municipal management deemed that the operation was unnecessary.
The &quot;Pedro Zulen&quot; Central Library of the university is a 19,800 m² building. It has a multifunctional stage and 400 seats. The Central Library &quot;Pedro Zulen&quot;, under the auspices of UNESCO, leads the initiative to develop digitalization of publications. The library directs the main activity of SISBIB. Each one of the faculties of the National University of San Marcos has its own library in the study areas of each faculty, these are connected to each other through the Library System (SISBIB) of the university.

==== Stadium of the University of San Marcos ====
The Stadium of the National University of San Marcos, officially known as the &quot;Colossus of America&quot;, is located in the center of the University City. Its main accesses are through block 5 of Av. Amézaga and block 36 of Av. Venezuela. At the local level, it has been the official stadium of the university soccer team, Club Deportivo Universidad San Marcos, which played until 2011 in the Second Division of Peru.

It was inaugurated in 1951, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the founding of the University of San Marcos. The San Marcos stadium initially had a total capacity of 70,000 people. It has been conditioned to an official capacity of 32,000 people; the remodeled venue was for the 2019 South American U-17 Championship and the 2019 Pan American Games.

== Research ==
The University of San Marcos has 37 academic research units. They are classified mainly in the areas of: health sciences, basic sciences, engineering, economic and management sciences, and humanities and legal and social sciences. The research centers have museums and laboratories. Each institute also has its own publications. The university has around 500 research groups. Since 2015, the University of San Marcos has also had the Center for Technological, Biomedical and Environmental Research (CITBM). It is led by the University of San Marcos and is made up of three national companies and three international centers of excellence. Below is a list of the main research institutes of the University of San Marcos:

=== Production and scientific publications ===
According to the 2009 annual balance prepared by the National Council of Science, Technology and Technological Innovation (CONCYTEC) of Peru, 20% of Peruvian scientific production was generated by the National University of San Marcos. Several scientific publications of the University of San Marcos and its research institutes had appeared in &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;. The main scientific publications of the University of San Marcos are published in academic journals &quot;Alma Máter&quot; and &quot;Theorema&quot; and in the 20 official magazines of each of the university&#x27;s faculties. Each professional school also has its own academic journal.

Currently, the National University of San Marcos has two cultural centers in two of its historic buildings. The Casona de San Marcos—its main cultural center—and the Colegio Real de San Marcos.

The Cultural Center &quot;La Casona&quot; of San Marcos is one of the main tourist attractions of the Historic Center of Lima. The complex is part of the area and the list of buildings in the historic center of the capital that in 1988 was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In 1989, the National University of San Marcos, the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI) and the National Institute of Culture sign a Peru-Spain agreement to adapting its architectural complex for culture and artistic creation.
The Royal College Cultural Center of Contemporary Peruvian Cultures, established in 2006, is located in the environment of the old &quot;Royal College&quot; of San Marcos, next to the Congress of the Republic of Peru. It is made up of three units of the university: the Institute of Applied Linguistics CILA, the &quot;Domingo Angulo&quot; Historical Archive of the University of San Marcos, and the Andean Rural History Seminar. Exhibitions and shows are regularly held.

It was founded on the initiative of Viceroy Francisco Álvarez de Toledo in 1592. After the Bourbon Reforms that led to the expulsion of the Jesuits, the campus was recast as the Convictorio de San Carlos. At the end of the 18th century, the War Inspector Gabriel de Avilés y del Fierro dedicated the premises to the headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Lima. Since the end of the 20th century, the University of San Marcos has given the Royal College the functions of a Cultural Center and Historical Archive.

=== University museums ===
The University of San Marcos has institutions that function exclusively as museums, these are the Museum of Natural History of Lima, the Sacaco Paleontological Museum, the Museum of Art, the Museum of Archaeology, the Historical Museum of Physical Sciences, among others. The university also has four other specialized libraries.

=== Archaeological sites ===

The National University of San Marcos has researched various archaeological sites and historical collections, such as the Huaca de San Marcos and others of the Maranga archaeological complex. In it, various ceramics have been found, as well as spondylus and quipus. The Ministry of Culture of Peru first declared the Huaca San Marcos and then all the minor archaeological sites on the campus, as Cultural Heritage of the Nation.

In 1966, Pablo Macera organized a trip to the Pacopampa archaeological site in Querocoto District; in 1970, he got Emilio Choy Ma to make a donation to San Marcos to acquire the Pacopampa Ceremonial Center.

== Notable people ==

Both formally and colloquially, the characters that have been part of the National University of San Marcos have received the title of &quot;sanmarquinos&quot;. The word has been in common use by the Peruvian population to refer to the close and prominent figures of this house of studies, and even to the pets and animals adopted by the university community.

==Athletics==
On August 7, 1924, San Marcos students founded the University Sports Federation of Peru. Since 1936, this federation has organized the National University Sports Games, the Regional University Sports Games and the National University Championships. Since 1963, it has participated in the Universiade. The basketball team had participated in the Lima Basketball League.

The University of San Marcos has had various professional football teams, including the University Football Federation (Club Universitario de Deportes) that was founded in 1924 by students until it was separated from the university and became private due to problems with the authorities in 1932; and the Deportivo Universidad San Marcos that came to dispute the second division until 2012.

The first university Games were held in 1936 in the city of Lima. Since then, four years between each Games was marked, though, recently, they have been taking place every 2 years. In 1951, the Stadium of the University of San Marcos was inaugurated in the center of the main campus. For the celebration of the 2019 Pan American Games, the Organizing Committee of Lima 2019 chose various sports facilities located between the city of Lima, as well as in Callao, as Pan American venues. Among them, the National University of San Marcos had its stadium remodeled to host the event. The Stadium of the National University of San Marcos was the sole venue of the 2019 South American U-17 Championship that took place in Peru.

=== Origin of the Club Universitario de Deportes ===

José Rubio Galindo, a student at the Faculty of Letters, and Luis Málaga Arenas, a student at the Faculty of Medicine, would join Plácido Galindo, Eduardo Astengo, Rafael Quirós, Mario de las Casas, Alberto Denegri, Luis de Souza Ferreira (who scored the first Peruvian goal in a FIFA World Cup), Andrés Rotta, Carlos Galindo, Francisco Sabroso, Jorge Góngora, Pablo Pacheco, Carlos Lassus and Carlos Cillóniz, among others. On August 7, 1924, at 7:00 p.m. (UTC-5), university students met at the headquarters of the Federation of Students of Peru, at 106 Juan de la Coba street.

The National Sports Committee, the highest body of Peruvian sports at that time, recognized the Federación Universitaria as if it were a League. Hence, together with the Peruvian Football League, the Amateur Association, the Callao League, Circolo Sportivo Italiano and Lima Cricket and Football Club, they formed the Football Federation. After participating in inter-university tournaments between 1924 and 1927, the Peruvian Football Federation invited the Federación Universitaria to participate in the Selection and Competition Championship (First Division Tournament) of 1928.

In the 1929 championship, the Federación Universitaria team of the University of San Marcos (today Club Universitario de Deportes) only had the participation of twelve teams due to the suspension of Alianza Lima for refusing to cede its players to the national team. The Federación Universitaria team still won the championship.

In 1930, the first FIFA World Cup was held in Montevideo, Uruguay. After the World Cup, the club traveled to the provinces by steamboat to face the Association White Star, which it defeated 1:0, then he toured Huacho and participated in the Gubbins Cup. The following year, the rector José Antonio Encinas prohibited the use of the name—Federación Universitaria de Fútbol—and this led to the change by Club Universitario de Deportes.

=== Club Deportivo San Marcos ===
In 2001, the University of San Marcos created the Club Deportivo Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, where it played until 2011. Club San Marcos played at the San Marcos stadium. The team was baptized with the name &quot;The Lions&quot; because the animal is the symbol of Mark the Evangelist. Later, the university created Deportivo San Marcos. The club has participated since 2013 in the first division of Cercado de Lima.

<doc id="1070678" wikidata="Q1933194" url="?curid=1070678" title="Notorious (Duran Duran album)">
<text>Notorious is the fourth studio album by the English pop rock band Duran Duran, released on 24 November 1986 by EMI Records. Produced by the band with Nile Rodgers, its musical style differed from the band&#x27;s previous albums with a funk rock sound. It is the first album to feature the band as a trio with singer Simon Le Bon, keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor, as drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Andy Taylor both left by the time the album was released. Andy Taylor would later be replaced by former Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, who completed recording parts of the album in addition to Rodgers and session drummer Steve Ferrone. 

&quot;Notorious&quot; peaked at number 16 on the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has been certified platinum and sold over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. The album yielded three singles: the title track, &quot;Skin Trade&quot;, and &quot;Meet &quot;El Presidente&quot;&quot;; the song &quot;Notorious&quot; was a worldwide success, reaching number seven and number two in the UK Singles Chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. Despite being a commercial failure selling fewer copies than their previous releases, it received positive reviews from critics, who praised the band&#x27;s maturity and production.

== Background and recording ==
Following the success of their previous album &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot; and its subsequent world tour, Duran Duran planned to take a break for a year but all the band members ended up working on two side projects: the Power Station and Arcadia which were both moderate successes. The band would regroup in 1985 to record the song &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; for the James Bond film of the same name and performed at the Live Aid charity concert in July of the same year, which proved to be the last time all original members played together.

By the time it came to record the new album at the beginning of 1986, drummer Roger Taylor had quit the group, citing exhaustion and overwhelmed with the band&#x27;s success. The remaining three members would continue to work on the album, with producer Nile Rodgers of Chic also contributing to guitar and drummer Steve Ferrone who worked with the Average White Band, Chaka Khan and Scritti Politti.

=== Andy Taylor&#x27;s departure and Warren Cuccurullo ===

Guitarist Andy Taylor was expected to record with the band in early stages of the album. He did not show up when the sessions began and tensions arose when the band realized the guitarist was in Los Angeles planning his own solo career and was not satisfied with the musical direction the band members were going for. The recording sessions would be interrupted by a legal battle between both parties. After several months however, the band agreed to let him go but Taylor would play on several tracks before his departure. Andy would write in his autobiography, &quot;Wild Boy: My Life in Duran Duran&quot; about his final studio session. &quot;I plugged in my guitar, played a few tracks with the engineer in order to honour my contractual obligations and then left to phone my lawyer. It was over.&quot;

In a 1986 interview, Andy Taylor stated, &quot;When I got to the studio, they had already started. It didn&#x27;t matter. I just didn&#x27;t want to be in the band anymore. They were playing this dance and R&amp;B style of music and I wanted to play rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. I left on good terms with them. I don&#x27;t feel any hostility.&quot; Keyboardist Nick Rhodes reflected on the circumstances saying, &quot;When John went on the Power Station tour with him, he felt they were growing up. I went over to Los Angeles in January to see Andy to talk about the new album and try out new ideas. It was very uneasy. Anyway, it doesn&#x27;t matter. I think the fact was we came to do the album the three of us really wanted to do and he didn&#x27;t. He wanted to make a solo record. I just wish he told us a bit earlier.

During the sessions, Taylor began hanging out with members of American rock band Missing Persons which had broken up. Guitarist Warren Cuccurullo would eventually contact the band several times, being initially rebuffed. When the album reached the mixing stage, the band would invite Warren over and was hired as a replacement, in which he contributed on several tracks on the album. Cuccurullo would eventually become a full-time member of the band in 1989 after their tour supporting their follow-up album &quot;Big Thing&quot;.

== Music ==
Given the experience the band members had on their side projects, there was a massive change in the musical style of Duran Duran. The sound of &quot;Notorious&quot; was an obvious direction, especially due to the fact that the band&#x27;s last two hit singles &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; and the James Bond theme &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; were &quot;edgier&quot; but were worldwide successes nevertheless. The band wanted to distance themselves away from their synth-pop approach and explore a &quot;funkier urban&quot; sound. Rhodes mentioned that the band wanted to focus more on their music and less on their image. &quot;On the last tour, the audience was too loud in some places,&quot; Rhodes said. &quot;The screaming little girls tend to make their way to the front of the stage and make a lot of noise. We like the young fans. But it would be nice if they were a little quieter.&quot;

Rhodes further elaborated on the musical change saying, &quot;I think &quot;Notorious&quot; is quite typical on some of the dance tracks on the album, but it&#x27;s certainly nothing like any of the old stuff&quot;, while lead singer Simon Le Bon stated that the involvement of Nile Rodgers helped with the musical direction the band was looking for. Bassist John Taylor and the rest of the band were also influenced by disco band Chic, in which Rodgers was the guitarist. The band also commented that the writing process was easier, in comparison with the tense recording sessions of &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;. &quot;John, particularly has had a very funky nerve,&quot; said Le Bon. &quot;He was the one who really pushed to get Nile. Nick would probably declare that he did. I was just happy to get along with anybody just to get some music down.&quot;

=== Lyrics ===
Similar to their previous works, the lyrical content on &quot;Notorious&quot; focused on certain topics. Due to the band&#x27;s determination to move to a more sophisticated style, the results were more mature such as the negative aspects of the press (&quot;Notorious&quot;), work exploitation (&quot;Skin Trade&quot;), band tensions (&quot;Vertigo (Do the Demolition)&quot;, manipulation (&quot;So Misled&quot;), and political intrigue (&quot;Meet &quot;El Presidente&quot;&quot;). The band named several tracks after several Alfred Hitchcock films, such as &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Rope&quot; – the original title for &quot;Hold Me&quot;.

Rhodes and Le Bon said that the writing for the album was easier in comparison to the tension and hysteria-filled sessions of &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;. Nile Rodgers said of composing the title track, &quot;[...] &#x27;Notorious&#x27; is basically James Brown soul-power. That&#x27;s when I started to groove and started playing along with it. And Nick Rhodes went, &#x27;Wow! A D-minor 6th. That&#x27;s such a great chord. We got to write that into a song.&quot;

== Release and promotion ==
The evolving sound and mature direction of Duran Duran was seen as a major turning point in the band&#x27;s commercial prospects. Several other factors regarding the lackluster performance of &quot;Notorious&quot; included the band members dismissing their managers, the Berrow brothers and acting as their own management. In June 1986, EMI fired its president and went through a reconstruction with the label losing interest in the band in favor of new artists. This, combined with the hiatus the band took would alienate much of the band&#x27;s core fanbase as the mature approach would leave behind the light synth-pop of their earlier releases.

&quot;Notorious&quot; was released on 24 November 1986. The album would peak at number 16 in the UK Albums Chart and number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It would be certified platinum on January 20, 1987 and has since sold over 1,000,000 copies worldwide. Despite this, &quot;Notorious&quot; was seen as a commercial failure because it did not replicate the same success as their previous albums. The lead single, &quot;Notorious&quot;, was a commercial success, reaching number 7 in the UK Singles Chart and number 2 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and saw heavy rotation on MTV. &quot;Skin Trade&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, stalled at number 22 in the UK and at number 39 on the American Top 40, a first for the band since their early releases. The third single, &quot;Meet &quot;El Presidente&quot;&quot;, was remixed to capitalize on the growing &quot;Miami dance&quot; scene, but it only reached number 24 in the UK and number 70 in the US. The commercial underperformance of both the album and its subsequent singles would ultimately shadow Duran Duran for years to come until the success of 1992&#x27;s &quot;Ordinary World&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

The reviews &quot;Notorious&quot; would receive were mostly positive, with some praising the band&#x27;s newfound maturity and improved songwriting. Jon Pareles of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Duran Duran&#x27;s newfound disillusionment may mark a step toward maturity...they managed to catch a trend on the upswing, perhaps &quot;Notorious&quot; suggests that for late 1980s grit and pessimism is coming into style.&quot; William Shaw of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; also praised the album calling it, &quot;the best LP Duran Duran recorded. They&#x27;ve tended to fill in all that space between the singles with somewhat drivelly that never quite make up their mind where they&#x27;re ging. But on &quot;Notorious&quot;, blimey! Duran Duran seem to have found themselves.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Mark Coleman wrote, &quot;&quot;Notorious&quot; is by far the group&#x27;s most consistently listenable work. But while it doesn&#x27;t plunge to past depths, neither does it scale the giddy heights of irresistible hit singles like &quot;The Reflex.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album a positive review. Reviewer Chris Williams said of the production, &quot;Nile Rodgers, is no miracle worker—he doesn&#x27;t leave a stamp on his production efforts with meager artists so much as the veneer of an airbrush—but his studio prowess is punchy enough to make the usual ponderous material a tad easier to swallow. Nick Rhodes&#x27; omnipresent layers of synthesizers have more character and variety this time around.&quot;

Some critics were mixed with the songwriting. In a negative review, AllMusic criticized the songwriting. The reviewer Mike DeGagne would write, &quot;Beneath Duran Duran&#x27;s attempts at trying to sound musically devious, mysterious, and slightly seductive, the tracks fail to bear enough weight in order to be effective all the way through. It&#x27;s easy to see why the band would choose such a route at this point in their career, but moderate doses of pop enthusiasm would have made &quot;Notorious&quot; a fuller and more enjoyable package. The provocative, nightclub brand of martini-sipping pop that does surface is meritorious to a certain extent, felt mostly in the album&#x27;s two biggest tracks.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; was also less enthusiastic; writer John Bergstrom wrote that the songwriting &quot;isn&#x27;t always as consistent as the production. It also showcases Duran Duran&#x27;s, and Rhodes&#x27; in particular, underrated ability to summon a satisfyingly ethereal atmosphere. Other tracks, though, suffer from lack of distinction. Duran Duran always struggled to supplement their singles with strong album material, and &quot;Notorious&quot; does at times reveal the stress and tension of the period in unflattering ways.&quot;

<doc id="1070679" wikidata="Q323080" url="?curid=1070679" title="John Flynn (minister)">
<text>John Flynn (25 November 18805 May 1951) was an Australian Presbyterian minister who founded the Australian Inland Mission (AIM) which later separated into Frontier Services and the Presbyterian Inland Mission, as well as founding what became the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the world&#x27;s first air ambulance.

==Early life==
Flynn was born at Moliagul, central Victoria on 25 November, 1880. The third child of Thomas and Rosetta, John was raised in Sydney by his mother&#x27;s sister after his mother died during childbirth. When he was five, John was reunited with his family at Snake Gully, near Ballarat.
The Flynn family later moved to Sunshine in Melbourne&#x27;s western suburbs. Educated at Snake Valley, Sunshine and Braybrook primary schools, he matriculated from University High School in Parkville in Melbourne, aged 18. Unable to finance a university course, he became a pupil-teacher with the Victorian Education Department and developed interests in photography and first aid. In 1903 he began training for the ministry through an extra-mural course for &#x27;student lay pastors&#x27;, serving meanwhile in pioneering districts of Beech Forest and Buchan. His next four years in theological college were interspersed with two periods on a shearers&#x27; mission and the publication of his Bushman&#x27;s Companion (1910).

==Ministry==
Always thinking of the needs of those in isolated communities, in September 1910 Flynn published &quot;The Bushman&#x27;s Companion&quot; which was distributed free throughout inland Australia. He took up the opportunity to succeed E. E. Baldwin as the Smith of Dunesk Missioner at Beltana, a tiny settlement 500 kilometres north of Adelaide. He was ordained in Adelaide for this work in January 1911. The missioners visited the station properties in a wide radius of Beltana, and their practical and spiritual service was valued in the isolated localities. Flynn used it as an opportunity to look at the potential for something bigger. By 1912, after writing a report for his church superiors on the difficulties of ministering to such a widely scattered population, Flynn was made the first superintendent of the Australian Inland Mission which became Frontier Services. Flynn&#x27;s vision was to establish a &#x27;Mantle of Safety&#x27; for the people of Outback Australia. As well as tending to spiritual matters, Flynn quickly established the need for medical care for residents of the vast Australian outback, and established a number of bush hospitals.

By 1917, Flynn was already considering the possibility of new technology, such as radio and aircraft, to assist in providing a more useful acute medical service, and then received a letter from an Australian pilot serving in World War I, Clifford Peel, who had heard of Flynn&#x27;s speculations and outlined the capabilities and costs of then-available planes. This material was published in the church&#x27;s magazine, the start of Flynn turning his considerable fund-raising talents to the task of establishing a flying medical service. The first flight of the Aerial Medical Service was in 1928 from Cloncurry, Queensland. A museum commemorating the founding of the Royal Flying Doctor Service is located at John Flynn Place in Cloncurry.
==Marriage==
Flynn married the secretary of the AIM, Jean Blanch Baird, on 7 May 1932 at the Presbyterian Church in Ashfield, Sydney. He was 51 years old and the marriage reportedly came as a surprise even to his close friends. 
==Death==
He retired and died in Sydney on 5 May 1951. He was 70 years old. He was cremated and his remains were placed under a large boulder from the Devils Marbles. The Northern Territory Department of Public Works had taken the rock from a site sacred to its traditional owners, but after many years of negotiations the rock was returned to its original location in 1998. It was replaced with one acceptable to the Aboriginal people, both of the original rock&#x27;s home and the people on whose land his grave lies.

The land adjoining the grave site was proclaimed as a reserve on 21 March 1957 and became a historical reserve known as the John Flynn&#x27;s Grave Historical Reserve on 30 June 1978.

His widow Jean died at the Pitt Wood Presbyterian nursing home in Ashfield, Sydney, New South Wales on 27 August 1976.

==Awards==
Flynn was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1933.

==Legacy==
The work of the Australian Inland Mission (AIM) is continued today through the Uniting Church of Australia&#x27;s Frontier Services and the Presbyterian Church of Australia&#x27;s Presbyterian Inland Mission. The Royal Flying Doctor Services still continues to deliver Flynn&#x27;s vision of a &#x27;Mantle of Safety&#x27; to the people of outback Australia.

==Commemoration==
Flynn is featured on the reverse of the polymer Australian twenty-dollar note.

Flynn&#x27;s name has also been adopted in commemoration of him, including:
* The Alice Springs suburb of Flynn
* The Canberra suburb of Flynn 
* The federal electorate of Flynn in Queensland was created by the Australian Electoral Commission in 2006.
* Qantas has announced that they intend naming one of their Airbus A380s after Flynn in recognition of his contribution to the aviation industry and particularly to his achievement of founding the Royal Australian Flying Doctors Service.
* The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine has also created a John Flynn Placement Program, which is a scholarship for medical students wanting to experience medical practice in the outback
* The John Flynn Memorial Uniting Church in Alice Springs was officially opened by Governor-General William Slim on Sunday 6 May 1956.
*The John Flynn Private Hospital located on the Gold Coast, Queensland

<text>Worth Matravers () is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. The village is situated on the cliffs west of Swanage. It comprises limestone cottages and farm houses and is built around a pond, which is a regular feature on postcards of the Isle of Purbeck.

The civil parish stretches from the coast northwards to, and just beyond, the A351 road from Corfe Castle to Swanage. The village of Worth Matravers is situated on side roads towards the south of the parish, which also includes the village of Harman&#x27;s Cross on the main road to the north.

==Etymology==
The earliest attestation of the name of Worth Matravers occurs in the Domesday Book of 1086, where the settlement was simply called &#x27;Worth&#x27; (represented by a range of spellings including &quot;Wirde&quot;, &quot;Orde&quot;, and &quot;Urda&quot;). This name originates in , meaning &#x27;an enclosure&#x27;. The &quot;Matravers&quot; element was added to disambiguate the place from others of the same name: it is the family name of John Matravers, who held the estate from 1335.

==History==
Archaeological investigations at the site known as &quot;Football Field&quot; revealed frequent activity from the early Neolithic to the early medieval period, including a Neolithic enclosure, a Bronze-Age roundhouse, settlement during the Iron Age and Roman period, and an inhumation cemetery from shortly after the Roman period. Archaeogenetic research at the cemetery showed genetic continuity from Britain&#x27;s Iron-Age population to the population of the cemetery, with little influence from the genetically Continental northern European population that became dominant in Eastern English cemeteries during the Roman and early medieval periods.

The cliffs of Worth Matravers were the site of a Chain Home radar station during World War II, which was instrumental in the development of radar when the Telecommunications Research Establishment outstation shared the site from 1940 until 1942 when it was relocated to Malvern, Worcestershire.

In 2004, local fishermen were targeted with a sabotage campaign by the so-called &quot;Lobster Liberation Front&quot;, a fringe animal rights group operating in the area.

In September 2006, it was reported that the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; had been filming in the village for a storyline involving the Wicks family. The village centre, and the area around the Square and Compass pub, were used as locations.

==Geography==
To the south of Worth Matravers village are the limestone cliffs of the English Channel coast. These are situated on the South West Coast Path and are part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. This coastline is popular with tourists in the summer months, with the rocky beaches of Winspit, Seacombe and Chapman&#x27;s Pool situated within walking distance of the village.

To the north of the village and parish are the chalk Purbeck Hills. Many tourists pass through this area on the Swanage Railway, a steam locomotive operated heritage railway. Harman&#x27;s Cross railway station on that railway is within the parish boundaries, but a significant distance from the village centre of Worth Matravers.

The parish includes the settlement of Harman&#x27;s Cross to the north, and has an area of 10.98 square kilometres. In the 2011 census it had 285 households and a population of 638. The parish formed part of the Purbeck local government district until its replacement by the Dorset unitary authority in April 2019. It is located within the South Dorset constituency of the House of Commons. Prior to Brexit in 2020, it was in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Economy==
Traditionally the village&#x27;s economy was based on farming, quarrying and fishing. As of 2019, two quarries – Swanworth and St Aldhelm&#x27;s – are still in operation. Both arable and pasture farming are still central to the village&#x27;s economy.

In March 2022, it was announced that the National Trust had purchased the 350 acre Weston Farm, in the village, adding to its other landholdings in the village and its vicinity such as Spyway.

==Places of interest==

A monument on St Aldhelm&#x27;s head, about a mile from the village, commemorates the development of radar by the Telecommunications Research Establishment at RAF Worth Matravers which was also one of the Chain Home radar stations during World War II, which proved decisive in the allied victory of that war. A Royal Observer Corps monitoring post is situated in the layby on the road to Worth Matravers.

About a mile from the village is Winspit, an old quarry on the cliffs. This was used as a filming location for an episode of Blake&#x27;s 7 and also in two Doctor Who stories.

On the bluff of the headland is the Norman Saint Aldhelm&#x27;s Chapel dedicated to St Aldhelm, Bishop of Sherborne. The village&#x27;s parish church of St Nicholas of Myra dates from the 12th century and is Grade I listed.

The village is also well known for the Square and Compass, a Grade II listed public house, which has operated since 1793. It is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors. It holds an annual week-long stone carving festival and accommodates a small museum exhibiting fossils and other local artefacts.

==Notable people==

*The tombs of Benjamin Jesty, a farmer who is reported to have vaccinated his family against smallpox having made the same observations as Edward Jenner and a while earlier, but kept quiet about it, and his wife, are side by side in the churchyard. Jesty&#x27;s family may be the first recorded deliberate attempt to induce immunity to smallpox using cowpox, or it may have been a more widespread activity prior to its systematisation.
*Sculptors Sir Anthony Caro (1924-2013) and Mary Spencer Watson (1913-2006) are buried in the village&#x27;s churchyard.
*The first President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Lord Phillips, took Worth Matravers as part of his title.

<text>Jacobus Hendrik (Henk) Pierneef (usually referred to as Pierneef) (13 August 1886 Pretoria – 4 October 1957 Pretoria), was a South African landscape artist, generally considered to be one of the best of the old South African masters. His distinctive style is widely recognised and his work was greatly influenced by the South African landscape.

Most of his landscapes were of the South African highveld, which provided a lifelong source of inspiration for him. Pierneef&#x27;s style was to reduce and simplify the landscape to geometric structures, using flat planes, lines and colour to present the harmony and order in nature. This resulted in formalised, ordered and often-monumental views of the South African landscape, uninhabited and with dramatic light and colour.

Pierneef&#x27;s work can be seen worldwide in many private, corporate and public collections, including the Africana Museum, Durban Art Gallery, Johannesburg Art Gallery, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum, Pierneef Museum and the Pretoria Art Gallery.

==Life history==
Pierneef was born in Pretoria, from Dutch and Boer parentage. He started his high school career at the &quot;Staatsmodelschool&quot; (literally &quot;model state school&quot;) there, where he took his first art classes, but it was interrupted by the Second Boer War. Due to the war, the Pierneef family decided to move back to the Netherlands in 1901. While there he studied at the Rotterdamse Kunstakademie. During this time, he also came into contact with the works of the old masters, which left a lasting impression on him.

Pierneef returned to Pretoria at the age of 18, where he met with and was encouraged by already established South African artists such as his godfather Anton van Wouw, Hugo Naude and Frans Oerder. His first public exhibition, where his work was generally well received, was with van Wouw and Naude in 1902. He worked at the State Library during the night for almost ten years and painted in his studio during the day. In 1910, Pierneef married Agatha Delen, a woman 12 years his senior.

Pierneef held his first solo exhibition in 1913, to great critical acclaim, some even describing his work as that of a genius, which inspired him greatly. His second solo exhibition was held two years later and was also very well received. During this period, he also did various illustrations for a periodicals and books.

In 1918, Pierneef left the State Library and started a career as an art lecturer at the Heidelberg (South Africa) College of Education. In that year he also painted the bush camp of Anton van Wouw of which two versions remains to today. One with, and one without visitors. During these camping adventures Van Wouw and Pierneef talked, sketched, fished for kurper and drank a great deal of coffee.

During the following year, he also started teaching drawing at the Pretoria College of Education. These positions gave him the opportunity to focus on his art and he participated in many successful solo and group exhibitions during 1920 to 1921. Due to the recognition that he received, Pierneef realised that he was setting the trend for a unique South African style. Personally, it was a difficult time in his life – his wife Agatha suffered from a mental disorder and also started to lose her sight.

Pierneef resigned as lecturer and became a full-time painter in 1923, due to differences of opinion regarding the curriculum with the Department of Education.

Pierneef visited South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1923 to 1924, where he sketched extensively for paintings that would later be completed in his studio. These would later be considered some of his best works.

Despite his successes, he was experiencing some financial difficulties, and had to resort to other jobs to make ends meet. During one of these, an advertising project to sell the land around Hartebeespoort dam, he met his future second wife, a Dutch woman named May Schoep. Pierneef divorced Agatha in 1923 and married May in 1924.

The couple visited Europe from 1925 to 1926, where Pierneef promoted his art and also studied the newest art movements. He also held a solo exhibition in the Netherlands, where his Bushmen drawings drew great attention.

In 1927 Pierneef&#x27;s daughter was born and he held a very successful exhibition of 86 of his works in Pretoria. However, during his solo exhibition the following year, he had some abstract modern works on display, which were very badly received, compelling him to revert to his old style. His daughter&#x27;s name was Marita (&quot;Mickie&quot;) Pierneef. May Pierneef (née Shoep) was the sister of Albertha Louise du Preez, nickname Be (née Schoep) who was married to Dr Jan Dirk Gysbert du Preez (a doctor, graduated in the Netherlands and Maths genius), who brought May Schoep and their mother, Wietje, to South Africa from the Netherlands, when he married Be.

Pierneef accepted a commission in 1929 to paint 32 panels for the interior of the then-new Johannesburg Railway Station, a task he completed by 1932. Since 2002 the complete set of thirty two panels, twenty eight landscape and four tree scenes, is on long term loan from the Transnet Foundation to the Rupert Art Foundation and have also been exhibited in the Jan Rupert Centre in Graaff-Reinet. The panels are considered to be some of his best work.

In 1933, he was commissioned to do seven murals for South Africa House, the South African embassy on Trafalgar Square, London. Pierneef completed this work in 1934.

<doc id="1070708" wikidata="Q1191206" url="?curid=1070708" title="Maburaho">
<text>is a romantic school comedy light novel series written by Toshihiko Tsukiji, illustrated by Eiji Komatsu and serialized in &quot;Gekkan Dragon Magazine&quot;. The light novel was adapted into a manga illustrated by Miki Miyashita and later developed into a 24 episode anime series produced by J.C.Staff and broadcast by WOWOW in Japan.

The series is about the story of Kazuki Shikimori, a second year student of the prestigious magic school, Aoi Academy. Unlike ordinary people who can use magic fewer than a hundred times and several of his classmates, who can use magic several thousand times, Kazuki can only use his magic eight times before he turns to ash. His life changes when it is revealed that Kazuki is descended from a line of world-famous magicians and he has the potential to father the most powerful magician in the world. Suddenly three girls, Yuna Miyama, Kuriko Kazetsubaki and Rin Kamishiro, enter Kazuki&#x27;s life in order to obtain his valuable genes.

A.D. Vision (ADV) acquired the English language distribution rights of the anime series in March 2004 and released it under its ADV Films division. Later the same year, ADV acquired the English language rights to the manga, which is released under the ADV Manga division.

==Plot==
&quot;Maburaho&quot; is set in a world where every character has the ability to use magic, however everyone&#x27;s magic is not equal. Each person in the story has a different degree of magic and a set number of times that they can use their magic. The average person is able to use magic fewer than a hundred times, however some people are able to use magic several thousand times. Because of this, a person&#x27;s social standing is determined by the number of times that he or she can perform magic. If someone uses up all of their magic, their body turns to ash and is scattered into the winds.

The series first introduces us to Kazuki Shikimori, a second year student from an elite magic school, Aoi Academy. However, unlike his classmates, Kazuki can only use his magic eight times before he turns to dust. As a result, he is at the bottom of the school&#x27;s social pecking order. However things change one day when Yuna Miyama shows up in his dorm room and declares that she is his wife. Moments later, Kuriko Kazetsubaki and Rin Kamishiro appear at Kazuki&#x27;s dorm, the former in order to obtain his genes and the latter to kill him to escape her obligation to marry him. Kazuki learns that he is a descendant of most of the world&#x27;s greatest magicians from both the eastern and western worlds. Even though he has a feeble spell count, his offspring has the potential of becoming a powerful magician.

Despite his weak spell count, each spell he performs is treated as an epic event. Kazuki&#x27;s magic is referred to as the most powerful magic in the world able to achieve miracles. Due to Kazuki&#x27;s kindness, his spell count begins to drop as he uses his magic on behalf of each girl. First by making it snow in the middle of summer to cheer up Yuna. Second by pulling Yuna out of a vortex that also merges the boy&#x27;s and girl&#x27;s dorms together. Kazuki uses his magic again to destroy two Behemoths in order to save Kuriko, who was unable to defeat them. And then, Kazuki reverses time to save Rin&#x27;s homemade box lunch. He also uses it to save his childhood friend Chihaya Yamase after a monster summoned by Kazuki&#x27;s classmates appeared at the school festival. Not long after, Yuna accidentally releases an incurable retrovirus on herself which also creates a doppelganger of her with the opposite of all her qualities (ex. the real Yuna loves Kazuki, the clone wants to kill him). Kazuki uses his sixth spell to obliterate the clone. Finally, Kazuki uses his last two charges in order to save Yuna&#x27;s life from the virus.

Each event leaves an impression on the girls and they attempt to keep Kazuki from using any more of his magic and eventually search for ways to increase his spell count. However, their attempts fail when halfway through the series Kazuki uses the last of his magic to save Yuna from the magical retrovirus. However, while Kazuki turned to ash and the ashes scattered, his ghost remains.

At this point in the story, Shino Akai appears in order to capture Kazuki and add him to her ghost collection. The girls try to protect Kazuki from Shino and eventually learn that Kazuki&#x27;s ashes had been scattered into each of their own hearts. But before Kazuki&#x27;s ashes were completely returned to him, Shino informs Rin and later the rest of the girls that this is not the first time someone&#x27;s ashes have been scattered and later restored. However, when Kazuki&#x27;s ashes are returned to him and his body restored, he will lose all of his memories. Knowing this, the girls still return Kazuki&#x27;s ashes to him. At the very end of the anime series, it is shown that instead of losing his memories as a side effect of restoring his body, Kazuki has now split into ten different bodies.

In the novel, the side effect of Kazuki&#x27;s restoration was gaining a special magical body that can cause disaster to the whole world if he lets out his magic powers. Another side effect of Kazuki&#x27;s restoration is the overflowing of his magical powers every now and then causing minor mishaps and sometimes great chaos.

==Characters==


===Primary characters===
: The male protagonist, Kazuki, is a second year student from an elite magic school, Aoi Academy, with serious social problems, and because he has a low spell count of only eight spells, most of the other students, especially the girls, would not notice him. At the beginning of his second year it is revealed that he is descended from not only the most powerful of eastern mages, but the most powerful of western mages. Having both powerful bloodlines fused into one body means that despite his low spell count, he is capable of wielding nearly omnipotent power. He is therefore the most powerful character in the series. He is shown to have feelings for Yuna as her kiss was the one to bring him back to his human form.
: Overall, Kazuki is a good person and helps others by using his magic, even when that means that he runs the risk of turning into ash. His selflessness and kindness eventually wins over the hearts of Rin and Kuriko. He is at times indecisive and not very courageous, but he prevalently shows his honest nature and his sense of doing the right thing.
; 
: Yuna, the typical harem anime &quot;housewife&quot;, transfers to Aoi Academy to become Kazuki&#x27;s wife and even first introduced herself as &quot;Yuna Shikimori&quot; to the rest of Kazuki&#x27;s class. Yuna is the only one who actually cares for Kazuki from the very beginning instead of just being interested in his genes. As the series progress, Yuna becomes extremely possessive of Kazuki and becomes very jealous when other girls show any kind of interests in him. Even later on the hair sticking out of her head acts as a locator to be able to find Kazuki.
: Using flashbacks, it is explained that Yuna and Kazuki first met each other when they were still children. Yuna was crying because she was about to move away, but after hearing Kazuki introduce himself as the greatest magician in the world, she begged him to use his magic so that she and her parents would not have to move. Instead, she settles on having him make it snow on a warm summer&#x27;s day with a promise to become Kazuki&#x27;s bride if he can do it.
: Tsukiji states in an interview in &quot;Newtype USA&quot; that Yuna was the first character that &quot;popped&quot; into his head, so he created the two other characters to be different from her.
; 
: At the beginning of the story, Kuriko&#x27;s only interest in Kazuki is to obtain his genes for the wealthy and influential Kazetsubaki family and the stature that goes with being the mother of a powerful sorcerer. A third year student and a member of the student government, Kuriko takes great pleasure in flirting with Kazuki and teasing Yuna. Often she will appear out of nowhere into Kazuki&#x27;s arms or lap right in front of Yuna or use her body, charm, or her family&#x27;s resources to seduce Kazuki. Kuriko gradually falls in love with him. Of the three girls, Kuriko demonstrates to be the most knowledgeable with regards to magic and the politics surrounding magic. She has an extremely high magic count, and it is considered to be among the strongest, though it is nowhere near as strong as Kazuki&#x27;s. Near the beginning of the series, Kuriko finds herself playing &quot;mother&quot; to the ghost girl Elizabeth after an incident that resulted in both the boys and girls dorms merging together by one of Kazuki&#x27;s magical spells.
; 
: The third prominent female character, Rin is a competent swordswoman and a member of the Kamishiro branch family. Rin has a reserved and dignified personality and always dresses in a samurai-style kimono that is suitable to her warrior nature. Rin is ordered by the head family to secure Kazuki&#x27;s genes in order to ensure the Kamishiro family&#x27;s dominance, which according to Kuriko, has been weakening because of the number of branch families. At the beginning of the story, Rin would prefer to kill Kazuki than be forced to marry someone whom, in her words, has bad grades, no athletic prowess, and no redeeming values. However, as the story progress, she gradually softens up to Kazuki and even begins to smile after witnessing his kindness and compassion towards others, including herself. Kazuki is the only one who could eat her horrendous cooking, and was totally honest about it.

===Supporting characters===
: First appearing in the anime during the Aoi Fest, Chihaya, or Yamase as Kazuki calls her, is Kazuki&#x27;s childhood friend and is in the same year as Kazuki at Aoi Academy. Tsukiji describes Chihaya as a comet that circles around and visits our system every once in a while. For most of their childhood, Chihaya did everything she could to prevent Kazuki from using any of his magic. However, when they got older, Kazuki began avoiding her making her feel like Kazuki hated her.
: Chihaya makes three appearances in the anime series, the first appearance during the Aoi Fest when she asks Kazuki if their classes would join together to produce a play. However after the festival, Chihaya moves away. Chihaya&#x27;s second appearance occurs when the students of Aoi Academy take a field trip to Kyoto after Kazuki has become a ghost. It is through her that it is learned that each of the girls contains a portion of Kazuki&#x27;s ashes.
: Chihaya makes one final appearance at the very end when she visits Kazuki. Even though his ashes returned from all four girls, Kazuki has not return to normal. It is soon revealed that Kazuki made the same promise to Chihaya as he did with Yuna moments before Kazuki met Yuna. Chihaya believed that Kazuki made it snow for her and that misunderstanding led Kazuki to avoid her. Because of that event, Yuna and Chihaya jointly hold the last portion of Kazuki&#x27;s ashes.
: In the novel, Chihaya was a character in the side stories that was released along with the novel, but not part of the main story itself. In the side stories, Chihaya is not Kazuki&#x27;s childhood friend but just a student from another class that had a crush on Kazuki. Chihaya is a shy and inward character and does not have the proper chance to convey her feelings to Kazuki.
; 
: It is through Dr. Akai&#x27;s monologue at the beginning of the series that the world of Maburaho is explained. The resident (and rather bishōnen) doctor of Aoi Academy, Dr. Akai is a formidable wizard with great powers of his own. Despite his laid-back appearance, he has Kazuki&#x27;s best interests at heart. Throughout the series Dr. Akai uses a variety of eye lenses that he carries around and through which he uses his magic. Dr. Akai is quite smitten with Kaori Iba, and sometimes comments to her that he has a &quot;special bed&quot; in the nurse&#x27;s office just for her.
: Dr. Akai&#x27;s main interest in Kazuki is that of a research subject, especially after Kazuki becomes a ghost. During the recap of events in episode 20, he reveals that this is the second time he has seen someone&#x27;s body being restored after their ashes had been scattered. But while he knows how to restore Kazuki&#x27;s body, he does not reveal the information to Yuna, Kuriko, or Rin.
; 
: Shino enters the story after Kazuki becomes a ghost. She attempts to capture Kazuki and make him part of her ghost collection, but is thwarted by her older brother, Dr. Akai. Afterwards, she becomes an assistant under her brother, but she still tries to make Kazuki part of her collection for personal reasons. At the end of the series, it is revealed that she along with Karei, Kazuki&#x27;s dorm manager, were in a similar situation as Yuna, Rin, and Kuriko and tries her best to convince them that restoring Kazuki&#x27;s body is pointless. She is powerful with seals and great in combat exceeding both Kuriko and Rin. She does not hate Kazuki, but feels that a tragedy will repeat itself if the girls persist on their goal. It is hinted that she has feelings for Kazuki since her brother had asked her why she kept hesitating to put Kazuki into her collection, even though she could have done so at any time. It is also believed that Shino and her brother, Dr. Akai and Karei are somehow &quot;ghosts&quot; as in episode 23 she flashes back to when Japan was still in the era of Warring States, and how the Manager told her to &quot;keep her promise&quot;, like they promised long ago. In the last episode of the anime, one of the &quot;Kazuki&#x27;s&quot; went to her for a health checkup and at the end, she tells Kazuki about a &quot;new bed&quot; and tells him to come over whenever he wants, showing that she is fully in love with him the same way her brother is from Kaori Iba.
; 
: It is explained in the story that Elizabeth is a ghost of a young girl who was once a member of a noble family during the Holy Roman Empire. Elizabeth is first introduced in the third episode when she moves into Kazuki&#x27;s dorm room. She once lived in an old mansion that was located between the girls and boys dorms until a group of real-estate agents from the Kazetsubaki group drove her out. After Kazuki and Yuna make an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve a suit of armor for her, Elizabeth creates a magical vortex which sucks Yuna in. Elizabeth threatened to torture her so Kazuki uses his magic to save Yuna, who ended up being tickled instead of tortured. Kazuki&#x27;s magic resulted in the girls dormitory being pulled toward and merging into the boys dorm.
: When Elizabeth sees Kuriko, who resembles Elizabeth&#x27;s mother, lift up a helmet, it reminded her of a knight that guarded her and Elizabeth adopts Kuriko as her new mother. From then on, Elizabeth lives in Kuriko&#x27;s chest and often tries to help Kuriko with Kazuki. When Kazuki becomes a ghost at the midpoint of the story, Elizabeth tries to gives him advice in order to cheer him up. She also seems to get mad easily, and then starts to use her magic to destroy things in anguish.
; 
: Through most of the series Karei is seen sweeping in front of the boys dorms, which she manages. She is always seen wearing a sexy, black funeral outfit and often appears to be watching out for Kazuki, even after he becomes a ghost. At the end of the series, it is revealed that she along with the ghost collector, Shino, were in a similar situation as Yuna, Rin, and Kuriko. However, unlike Shino, Karei views that it is better for a person to be alive, even without their memories, than to remain a ghost.
: While never directly stated in the series, there are strong hints that the man that Karei and Shino once loved is related to Kazuki. The first is that Karei pledges to watch over her love from the background, something she still does with Kazuki. Second is that Karei&#x27;s love was a Shinto priest, while Kazuki is also descended from a line of Shinto priests. And finally is an overlay between Karei&#x27;s love and Kazuki as Karei reminds Shino of their pledge to watch over their love.
; 
: Yuna and Kazuki&#x27;s homeroom teacher for the class of 2-B. She seems like a student herself, as she rarely if ever truly tries to exercise control over the class of 2-B. Instead, she enjoys spending her time playing video games, sometimes playing them while in the middle of teaching a class.
; Class 2-B
: Class 2-B is the most troublesome class at Aoi Academy. During the entire series, the students of the class are always coming up with schemes to make money and getting into fights which destroy parts of the school building. The more notable members of the class are:
:: Nakamaru is a greedy individual who pretends to be Kazuki&#x27;s best friend, but is extremely jealous of Kazuki&#x27;s relationship with Yuna and would try to exploit Kazuki&#x27;s abilities for his own personal gain. In every case, his schemes always backfire, hurting him the most.
:; 
:: She&#x27;s a member of a rival house of Rin Kamishiro and is the only class member who does not participate in the class&#x27;s schemes. Her clan happens to be masters of unarmed combat, and though she does not take part in the long-standing feud between her family and Rin&#x27;s, she does want to compete honorably with Rin to finally determine who is the best.
:; 
:: An equally opportunistic girl who is often Nakamaru&#x27;s foil.
; 
: Maiho is another of Kazuki&#x27;s classmates. Maiho was introduced in the original novel just as the script for the anime series was finishing. At first, Shinichiro Kimura, director of the anime series, wanted to bring Maiho into the series but decided to focus on the relationships between Kazuki, Yuna, Kuriko, Rin and Chihaya, though Maiho does make an appearance in the final episode. According to &quot;Newtype USA&quot;, Maiho has the ability to neutralize magical powers. Because of this, she often tags along with Kazuki in order to keep his magic in check, much to Yuna&#x27;s irritation.

===Novel characters===
: Kentaro first appears in &quot;The Volume of Revival – Part 2 (South East)&quot;. He is Yuna&#x27;s father and an archeologist. However, the artifacts he uncovered end up being sold in the black market. Kentaro met his wife, Yukari, in Turkey where they fell in love at first sight and got married. But according to Kentaro, it seemed more like he had been forced in marriage.
: First appearing in &quot;The Volume of Revival – Part 6 (North West)&quot;, Yukari is Yuna&#x27;s mother who works as a broker in Italy. The first impression Yukari gave out to Kazuki was that she is a beautiful traditional Japanese woman, but actually she was the one who had taught Yuna that it is bad to lose, which had led to Yuna&#x27;s easily jealous character. Yukari had once chased Kentaro all over the world before finally cornering him at the summit of Kilimanjaro and forced him into agreement to marry her.
: Debuting in the side story, &quot;The Volume of Maids&quot;, Liera is the captain from the Maid Organization, MMM (More and More Maids) fifth armored company (commonly known as &quot;Housekeeper&quot;).

Kazuki has been appointed to be her next master and because of that Liera had been trying her best. Because of her love for Kazuki, Liera tends to easily forget about the existence of Yuna.
: Kamiyo is Chihaya&#x27;s younger sister who makes her first appears in a side story in &quot;The Volume of Revival – Part 3 (South)&quot;.

Kamiyo adores and idolizes her elder sister Chihaya. So when Kamiyo sees Chihaya in very depressed mood, Kamiyo decides to find out and fix the problem (Kazuki) for her older sister.

==Development==
&quot;Maburaho&quot; was Toshihiko Tsukiji&#x27;s first attempt at writing a romantic school comedy. Tsukiji inspired to write &quot;Maburaho&quot; after losing a previous novel competition hosted by &quot;Gekkan Dragon Magazine&quot;, the Dragon Cup. Tsukiji won the competition and &quot;Maburaho&quot; received high acclaim from &quot;Gekkan Dragon&quot; readers. In an interview in &quot;Newtype USA&quot;, Tsukiji states, &quot;I kept two key words in mind, two things that are common to every teenage boy—school and girls.&quot; Tsukiji wanted to create three characters that were different from each other in every way.
Tsukiji originally conceived of ending the series after six installments with the death of Kazuki after using all of his magic, however the publisher asked him to extend the series. Instead of manipulating Kazuki&#x27;s magic count, Tsukiji decided to continue the story with Kazuki as a ghost. &quot;I figured it&#x27;d probably be most interesting if I made him a ghost,&quot; states Tsukiji.

When discussing the anime adaptation, Tsukiji states, &quot;I was actually very inspired by a scene from Episode 1, the one where Yuna introduces herself.&quot; Tsukiji was amazed with how skillfully anime director Shinichiro Kimura and the voice actors were able to express each of the girls&#x27; personalities.

==Reception==
The English language release of &quot;Maburaho&quot; was met with mediocre reviews. Many critics comment that &quot;Maburaho&quot; was a typical &quot;by the book&quot; harem comedy that added little originality to the genre. &quot;&quot;Maburaho&quot; feels like more of an unfinished prototype for the harem genre than an actual anime series&quot;, states Anime News Network critic, Carlo Santos. &quot;The plot is there, but it lacks any defining elements besides the general theme of magic; the characters are there, but they don&#x27;t have any particular traits apart from being, well, the one loser guy and the cookie-cutter hot girls chasing after him.&quot; Santos goes on to state. Chris Beveridge, critic for AnimeOnDVD, comments, &quot;&quot;Maburaho&quot; has some cute quirks to it, very nice character designs and it&#x27;s a show that actually took a risk midway through the series by changing the nature of the lead character.&quot; However Beveridge goes on to say, &quot;While it has these good points, it didn&#x27;t capitalize on them and instead worked hard towards keeping with a mediocre series of events and scripts. ... It&#x27;s a by the book piece with some flashes of creativity.&quot;

Jason Thompson gave the manga series a half-of-one-star review in his &quot;&quot;, saying &quot;The characters and situations are stock, the girls are identical except for their hair, and the fanservice is tame.&quot;

<text>Hess is a lunar impact crater that lies in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. The crater rim has been worn by subsequent impacts, leaving a low, eroded outer wall. The flat interior has been resurfaced by lava flows and is free of significant impacts. This floor has a slightly darker albedo than the surrounding terrain.

The crater Boyle is nearly attached to the northeastern rim of Hess, and Abbe lies to the south. To the west is the large walled plain Poincaré, and Hess is located at the eastern edge of the crater&#x27;s deeply eroded outer rim. The satellite crater Hess Z is partly overlaid by the northern rim of Hess. The small crater Hess M joins the south-southwest rim of Hess to the northwest rim of Abbe.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hess.

<text>Benjamin Frankel (31 January 1906 – 12 February 1973) was a British composer. His best known pieces include a cycle of five string quartets, eight symphonies, and concertos for violin and viola. He was also notable for writing over 100 film scores and working as a big band arranger in the 1930s. During the last 15 years of his life, Frankel also developed his own style of 12-note composition which retained contact with tonality.

==Biography==
Frankel was born in London on 31 January 1906, the son of Polish Jewish parents. He began to learn the violin at an early age, showing remarkable talent; at age 14, his piano-playing gifts attracted the attention of the American pianist and teacher Victor Benham (1867–1936) who persuaded his parents to let him study music full-time. 

He spent six months in Germany in 1922, then returned to London, where he won a scholarship from the Worshipful Company of Musicians and attempted his first serious compositions while earning his income as a jazz violinist, pianist and arranger. Known then as Ben Frankel, his jazz work can be heard on recordings by Fred Elizalde&#x27;s band. He also played violin with Carroll Gibbons and the Savoy Hotel Orpheans.

By the early 1930s, Frankel was in demand as an arranger and musical director in London, working with several dance bands. He wrote several popular dance band arrangements for Henry Hall&#x27;s BBC Dance Orchestra, including &quot;Learn To Croon&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot;, &quot;Weep No More My Baby&quot;, &quot;April in Paris&quot; and &quot;In Town Tonight&quot;. He wrote many arrangements and scores for theatre and film music but gave up theatre work in 1944. 

He did, however, retain an interest in film composing until his death, writing over 100 scores. These included &quot;The Seventh Veil&quot; (1945), &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot; (1951), &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952), &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964), and &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), as well as the first British (partly) serial film score, to &quot;The Curse of the Werewolf&quot; (1961).

From 1941 until 1952 he was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but resigned his membership in protest against the Slánský trial. 

During and after the war Frankel started to become widely known as a composer of works in traditional classical form. One of the first to gain attention was the Sonata No 1 for solo violin of 1942, which was dedicated to the Austrian-born violinist and viola player Max Rostal.
Rostal made the premiere recording in 1944.

He went on to perform Frankel&#x27;s most famous work, the Violin Concerto &quot;in memory of &#x27;the six million&#x27;&quot; (a reference to the Jews murdered during the Holocaust), commissioned for the 1951 Festival of Britain, and was the soloist in the Viola Concerto for BBC radio broadcasts in 1970 and 1972. The core of Frankel&#x27;s output are the eight symphonies (composed between 1958 and 1971) and the five string quartets (composed between 1945 and 1965). His friend Hans Keller was a champion of his concert music and did much to promote its performance at home and abroad.

In 1955 Frankel succeeded Edward Clark as Chairman of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM). That year issues arose about certain expenses Clark had claimed while he was chairman. Clark alleged that Frankel had accused him of fraud. Frankel denied he had ever made such a claim, but nevertheless said that such a claim, had he made it, would have been true. This amounted to slander as far as Clark was concerned, and he sued Frankel in the High Court, calling the composers Christian Darnton and Bernard Stevens as witnesses. While Frankel&#x27;s alleged slander itself was unproven, the jury exonerated Clark of any wrongdoing and he felt this meant his integrity was intact. Clark&#x27;s wife Elisabeth Lutyens ever after referred to Frankel as &quot;composer and ex-colleague&quot;.

Born and raised in Hammersmith, Frankel lived in London for many years, most notably at 17 Soho Square between 1953 and 1957, where he was the host of a circle of artists including the poet Cecil Day Lewis and film director Anthony Asquith. From 1952 there was also a house in Sussex, Rodmell Hiil, Rodmell, near Lewes. The writer Leonard Woolf lived next door. In 1958 he re-located to Locarno in Switzerland. He married three times: first in 1932 to Joyce Stanmore Rayner (divorced 1944), then to Phyllis Anna Leat (1944 until her death in 1967), and finally to Xenia Hamilton-Kennaway in 1972, not long before his death. There were two sons and one daughter by the first marriage. 

Frankel died in London on 12 February 1973 while working on the three-act opera &quot;Marching Song&quot; and a ninth symphony, which had been commissioned by the BBC. When he died, &quot;Marching Song&quot; had been completed in short score; it was orchestrated by Buxton Orr, a composer who had studied with Frankel and whose advocacy has been at least partly responsible for the revival of interest in his works.

==Posthumous reputation==
In the twenty years following his death, Frankel&#x27;s works were almost completely neglected. Thea King&#x27;s landmark recording of the Clarinet Quintet with the Britten Quartet released in 1991 was the first commercial recording of his music since his death. A major turning point, however, came in the mid-1990s when German record company CPO (Classic Produktion Osnabrück, since bought by JPC) decided to partner with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to record Frankel&#x27;s complete oeuvre. This allowed for the first time an appraisal of his output. CPO recorded all the symphonies (conducted by Werner Andreas Albert) and all the string quartets (by the Nomos Quartet), and in 1998 issued the world premiere recordings of the Violin Concerto, Viola Concerto and Serenata Concertante. With recordings now available, BBC Radio 3 featured him as the &quot;Composer of the Week&quot;, first in 1996 and again in 2006.

<doc id="1070735" wikidata="Q27022" url="?curid=1070735" title="Equus (genus)">
<text>Equus () is a genus of mammals in the family Equidae, which includes horses, asses, and zebras. Within the Equidae, &quot;Equus&quot; is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. Like Equidae more broadly, &quot;Equus&quot; has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus originated in North America and dispersed into the Old World and South America during the Early and Middle Pleistocene. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies), and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers, with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower-quality vegetation.

While the domestic horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild equine populations are limited to Africa and Asia. Wild equine social systems are in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion/jackass, several females or mares/jennets, and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females take care of their offspring, but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild equine populations.

==Etymology==
The word is Latin for &quot;horse&quot; and is cognate with the Greek (, &quot;horse&quot;) and Mycenaean Greek , the earliest attested variant of the Greek word, written in Linear B syllabic script. Compare the alternative development of the Proto-Greek labiovelar in Ionic ().

==Taxonomic and evolutionary history==
The genus &quot;Equus&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It is the only recognized extant genus in the family Equidae. The first equids were small, dog-sized mammals (e.g. &quot;Eohippus&quot;) adapted for browsing on shrubs during the Eocene, around 54 million years ago (Mya). These animals had three toes on the hind feet and four on the front feet with small hooves in place of claws, but also had soft pads.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1126/science.1105458&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Equids developed into larger, three-toed animals (e.g. &quot;Mesohippus&quot;) during the Oligocene and Miocene. From there, the side toes became progressively smaller through the Pleistocene until the emergence of the single-toed &quot;Equus&quot;.

The genus &quot;Equus&quot;, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from &quot;Dinohippus&quot;, via the intermediate form &quot;Plesippus&quot;. One of the oldest species is &quot;Equus simplicidens&quot;, described as zebra-like with a donkey-like head shape. The oldest material to date was found in Idaho, USA. The genus appears to have spread quickly into the Old World, with the similarly aged &quot;E. livenzovensis&quot; documented from western Europe and Russia. Molecular phylogenies indicate that the most recent common ancestor of all modern equines (members of the genus &quot;Equus&quot;) lived ~5.6 (3.9-7.8) Mya. Direct paleogenomic sequencing of a 700,000-year-old middle Pleistocene horse metapodial bone from Canada implies a more recent 4.07 Mya for the most recent common ancestor within the range of 4.0 to 4.5 Mya.

Mitochondrial evidence supports the division of &quot;Equus&quot; species into noncaballoid (which includes zebras and asses) and caballoids or &quot;true horses&quot; (which includes &quot;E. caballus&quot; and &quot;E. ferus przewalskii&quot;, alternatively &quot;E. przewalskii&quot;). Of the extant equine species, the lineage of the asses may have diverged first, possibly as soon as &quot;Equus&quot; reached the Old World. Zebras appear to be monophyletic and differentiated in Africa, where they are endemic. Members of the subgenus &quot;Sussemionus&quot; were abundant during the Early and Middle Pleistocene of North America and Afro-Eurasia, but only a single species, &quot;Equus ovodovi&quot; survived into the Late Pleistocene and Holocene in south Siberia and China, with the youngest remains from China dating to around 3500 BP (1500 BC), during the Shang dynasty. Genetic data from &quot;E. ovodovi&quot; has placed the &quot;Sussemionus&quot; lineage as closer to zebras and asses than to caballine horses.

Molecular dating indicates the caballoid lineage diverged from the noncaballoids 4 Mya. Genetic results suggest that all North American fossils of caballine equines, as well as South American fossils traditionally placed in the subgenus &quot;E.&quot; (&quot;Amerhippus&quot;), belong to &quot;E. ferus&quot;. Remains attributed to a variety of species and lumped together as New World stilt-legged horses (including &quot;E. francisci&quot;, &quot;E. tau&quot;, and &quot;E. quinni&quot;) probably all belong to a second species that was endemic to North America. This was confirmed in a genetic study done in 2017, which subsumed all the specimens into the species &quot;E. francisci&quot; which was placed outside all extant horse species in the new genus &quot;Haringtonhippus&quot;&quot;,&quot; although its placement as a separate genus was subsequently questioned. A separate genus of horse, &quot;Hippidion&quot; existed in South America. The possible causes of the extinction of horses in the Americas (about 12,000 years ago) have been a matter of debate. Hypotheses include climatic change and overexploitation by newly arrived humans. Horses only returned to the American mainland with the arrival of the &quot;conquistadores&quot; in 1519.

===Extant species===
===Prehistoric species===
Many extinct prehistoric species of &quot;Equus&quot; have been described. The validity of some of these species is questionable and a matter of debate. For example, &quot;Equus niobrarensis&quot; is likely synonymous with &quot;Equus scotti&quot;, while &quot;Equus alaskae&quot; is most likely the same species as &quot;Equus lambei&quot;, which itself may be a North American form of the living &quot;Equus przewalskii&quot;.

DNA studies on American horse remains found frozen into permafrost have shown that several of the supposed American species, as well as the European &quot;Equus ferus&quot;, are actually a single highly-variable widespread species, as if the evolutionary process of speciation was persistently being frustrated by large herds moving long distances and mixing.

===Hybrids===
Equine species can crossbreed with each other. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a male donkey and a female horse. With rare exceptions, these hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a male horse and a female donkey. Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse and a zonkey or zedonk, a hybrid of a zebra and a donkey. In areas where Grévy&#x27;s zebras are sympatric with plains zebras, fertile hybrids do occur. Ancient DNA identifies the Bronze Age kunga as a cross between the Syrian wild ass and the donkey.

==Biology==
===Physical characteristics===

Equines have significant differences in size, though all are characterized by long heads and necks. Their slender legs support their weight on one digit (which evolved from the middle digits). Grévy&#x27;s zebra is the largest wild species, standing up to and weighing up to . Domesticated horses have a wider range of sizes. Heavy or draft horses are usually at least high and can be as tall as and weigh from about . Some miniature horses are no taller than in adulthood. Sexual dimorphism is limited in equines. The penis of the male is vascular and lacks a bone (baculum). Equines are adapted for running and traveling over long distances. Their dentition is adapted for grazing; they have large incisors that clip grass blades and highly crowned, ridged molars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines (&quot;tushes&quot;), which can be used as weapons in fighting. Equines have fairly good senses, particularly their eyesight. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.

A dun-colored coat with primitive markings that include a dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant equine species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but 2014 evidence supports the theory that they are a form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats, and compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing from the top of the tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some equine species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.

===Ecology and daily activities===

Extant wild equines have scattered ranges across Africa and Asia. The plains zebra lives in lush grasslands and savannas of Eastern and Southern Africa, while the mountain zebra inhabits mountainous areas of southwest Africa. The other equine species tend to occupy more arid environments with more scattered vegetation. Grévy&#x27;s zebra is found in thorny scrubland of East Africa, while the African wild ass inhabits rocky deserts of North Africa. The two Asian wild ass species live in the dry deserts of the Near East and Central Asia and Przwelski&#x27;s wild horse&#x27;s habitat is the deserts of Mongolia. Only the range of the plains and Grévy&#x27;s zebras overlap. In addition to wild populations, domesticated horses and donkeys are widespread due to humans. In certain parts of the world, populations of feral horses and feral donkeys exist, which are descended from domesticated animals that were released or escaped into the wild.

Equines are monogastric hindgut fermenters. They prefer to eat grasses and sedges, but they, particularly asses, may also consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits, and roots if their favored foods are scarce. Compared to ruminants, they have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. After food is passed through the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum, where cellulose is broken down by micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants—30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for cattle. Equines may spend 60–80% of their time feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer, mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers such as blue wildebeests and Thomson&#x27;s gazelles, which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.

Wild equines may spend seven hours a day sleeping. During the day, they sleep standing up, while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks, and other objects and roll around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild equines can roll over completely.

===Social behavior===

Equines are social animals with two basic social structures.

Horses, plains zebras, and mountain zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females, and their offspring. These groups have their own home ranges, which overlap and they tend to be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates such as the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, and protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next-highest ranking mare and her offspring, and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.

In Grévy&#x27;s zebras and the wild ass species, adults have more fluid associations and adult males establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water, and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with nonlactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories, but remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horses exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.

In both equine social systems, excess males gather in bachelor groups. These are typically young males that are not yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over estrous females and involve biting and kicking.

===Communication===

When meeting for the first time or after they have separated, individuals may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other&#x27;s genitals. They then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their heads on one another. This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.

Equines produce a number of vocalizations and noises. Loud snorting is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors also squeal while play fighting. The contact calls of equines vary from the whinnying and nickering of the horse and the barking of plains zebras to the braying of asses, Grévy&#x27;s zebras, and donkeys. Equines also communicate with visual displays, and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate the positions of the head, ears, and tail. An equine may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth, and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.

===Reproduction and parenting===

Among harem-holding species, the adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more promiscuous and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrus in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread and raise their tails when in the presence of a male. Males assess the female&#x27;s reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species; it is roughly 11–13 months, and most mares come into estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like Grévy&#x27;s zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.

Among harem-holding species, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers, but if threatened by predators, the entire group works together to protect all the young. The group forms a protective front with the foals in the center and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close. In territory-holding species, mothers may gather into small groups and leave their young in &quot;kindergartens&quot; under the guard of a territorial male while searching for water. A Grévy&#x27;s zebra stallion may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his.

==Human relations==

The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to around 4000–3500 BCE. By 3000 BCE, the horse was completely domesticated, and by 2000 BCE, a sharp increase occurred in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable, evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were buried with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BCE. Studies of variation in genetic material shows that a very few wild stallions, possibly all from a single haplotype, contributed to the domestic horse, mating with many mares in early domesticated herds.

Przewalski&#x27;s horse has been conclusively shown not to be an ancestor of the domestic horse, though the two can hybridize and produce fertile offspring. The split between Przewalskii&#x27;s horse and &quot;E. caballus&quot; is estimated to have occurred 120,000–240,000 years ago, long before domestication. Of the caballine equines of &quot;E. ferus,&quot; &quot;E. f. ferus,&quot; also known as the European wild horse or &quot;tarpan&quot;, shares ancestry with the modern domestic horse. In addition, tarpans that lived into modern times may have been hybridized with domestic horses.

Archaeological, biogeographical, and linguistic evidence suggests that the donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.

===Conservation issues===

Humans have had a great impact on the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the quagga and the tarpan, became extinct. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, Grévy&#x27;s zebra, the mountain zebra, and Przewalski&#x27;s horse as endangered, the onager as vulnerable, the plains zebra as near threatened, and the kiang as least concern. Przewalski&#x27;s horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.

Feral horses vary in degree of protection and generate considerable controversy. For example, in Australia, they are considered a non-native invasive species, often viewed as pests, though are also considered to have some cultural and economic value. In the United States, feral horses and burros are generally considered an introduced species because they are descendants from domestic horses brought to the Americas from Europe. While they are viewed as pests by many livestock producers, conversely, a view also exists that &quot;E. caballus&quot; is a reintroduced once-native species returned to the Americas that should be granted endangered species protection. At present, certain free-roaming horses and burros have federal protection as &quot;living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West&quot; under the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, and in &quot;Kleppe v. New Mexico&quot;, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the animals so designated were, as a matter of law, wildlife.

<text>A high-speed camera is a device capable of capturing moving images with exposures of less than second or frame rates in excess of 250 frames per second. It is used for recording fast-moving objects as photographic images onto a storage medium. After recording, the images stored on the medium can be played back in slow motion. Early high-speed cameras used photographic film to record the high-speed events, but have been superseded by entirely electronic devices using an image sensor (e.g. a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a MOS active pixel sensor (APS)), typically recording over 1 000 frames per second onto DRAM, to be played back slowly to study the motion for scientific study of transient phenomena.

==Overview==
A high-speed camera can be classified as:
# A high-speed film camera which records to film,
# A high-speed video camera which records to electronic memory,
# A high-speed framing camera which records images on multiple image planes or multiple locations on the same image plane (generally film or a network of CCD cameras),
# A high-speed streak camera which records a series of line-sized images to film or electronic memory.

A normal motion picture film is played back at 24 frames per second, while television uses 25 frames/s (PAL) or 29.97 frames/s (NTSC). High-speed film cameras can film up to a quarter of a million fps by running the film over a rotating prism or mirror instead of using a shutter, thus reducing the need for stopping and starting the film behind a shutter which would tear the film stock at such speeds. Using this technique one second of action can be stretched to more than ten minutes of playback time (super slow motion). High-speed video cameras are widely used for scientific research, military test and evaluation, and industry. Examples of industrial applications are filming a manufacturing line to better tune the machine, or in the car industry filming a crash test to investigate the effect on the crash dummy passengers and the automobile. Today, the digital high-speed camera has replaced the film camera used for Vehicle Impact Testing. 

Television series such as &quot;MythBusters&quot; and &quot;Time Warp&quot; often use high-speed cameras to show their tests in slow motion. Saving the recorded high-speed images can be time-consuming because , consumer cameras have resolutions up to four megapixels with frame rates of over 1,000 per second which will record at a rate of 11 gigabytes per second. Technologically these cameras are very advanced, yet saving images requires use of slower standard video-computer interfaces. While recording is very fast, saving images is considerably slower.
To reduce the storage space required and the time required for people to examine a recording, only the parts of an action which are of interest or relevance can be selected to film. When recording a cyclical process for industrial breakdown analysis, only the relevant part of each cycle is filmed.

A problem for high-speed cameras is the needed exposure for the film; very bright light is needed to be able to film at 40,000 fps, sometimes leading to the subject of examination being destroyed because of the heat of the lighting.
Monochromatic (black and white) filming is sometimes used to reduce the light intensity required.
Even higher speed imaging is possible using specialized electronic charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging systems, which can achieve speeds of over 25 million fps. These cameras, however, still use rotating mirrors, like their older film counterparts. Solid state cameras can achieve speeds of up to 10 million fps. All development in high-speed cameras is now focused on digital video cameras which have many operational and cost benefits over film cameras.

In 2010 researchers built a camera exposing each frame for two trillionths of a second (picoseconds), for an effective frame rate of half a trillion fps (femto-photography). Modern high-speed cameras operate by converting the incident light (photons) into a stream of electrons which are then deflected onto a photoanode, back into photons, which can then be recorded onto either film or CCD.

==Uses in television==
*The show &quot;MythBusters&quot; prominently uses high-speed cameras for measuring speed or height.
*&quot;Time Warp&quot; was centered around the use of high-speed cameras to slow things down that are usually too fast to see with the naked eye.
*High-speed cameras are frequently used in television productions of many major sporting events for slow motion instant replays when normal slow motion is not slow enough, such as international Cricket matches.

==Uses in science==
High-speed cameras are frequently used in science in order to characterize events which happen too fast for traditional film speeds. Biomechanics employs such cameras to capture high-speed animal movements, such as jumping by frogs and insects, suction feeding in fish, the strikes of mantis shrimp, and the aerodynamic study of pigeons&#x27; helicopter-like movements using motion analysis of the resulting sequences from one or more cameras to characterize the motion in either 2-D or 3-D.

The move from film to digital technology has greatly reduced the difficulty in use of these technologies with unpredictable behaviors, specifically via the use of continuous recording and post-triggering. With film high-speed cameras, an investigator must start the film then attempt to entice the animal to perform the behavior in the short time before the film runs out, resulting in many useless sequences where the animal behaves too late or not at all. In modern digital high-speed cameras, the camera can simply record continuously as the investigator attempts to elicit the behavior, following which a trigger button will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval before and after the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size and memory capacity during continuous recording). Most software allows saving a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest. Such triggering can also be used to synchronize recording across multiple cameras.

The explosion of alkali metals on contact with water has been studied using a high-speed camera. Frame-by-frame analysis of a sodium/potassium alloy exploding in water, combined with molecular dynamic simulations, suggested that the initial expansion may be the result of a Coulomb explosion and not combustion of hydrogen gas as previously thought.

Digital high-speed camera footage has strongly contributed to the understanding of lightning when combined with electric field measuring instrumentation and sensors which can map the propagation of lightning leaders through the detection of radio waves generated by this process.

==Uses in industry==
When moving from reactive maintenance to predictive maintenance, it is crucial that breakdowns are really understood. One of the basic analysis techniques is to use high-speed cameras in order to characterize events which happen too fast to see, e.g. during production. Similar to use in science, with a pre- or post-triggering capability the camera can simply record continuously as the mechanic waits for the breakdown to happen, following which a trigger signal (internal or external) will stop the recording and allow the investigator to save a given time interval prior to the trigger (determined by frame rate, image size, and memory capacity during continuous recording). Some software allows viewing the issues in real time, by displaying only a subset of recorded frames, minimizing file size and watch time issues by eliminating useless frames before or after the sequence of interest.

High-speed video cameras are used to augment other industrial technologies such as x-ray radiography. When used with the proper phosphor screen which converts x-rays into visible light, high-speed cameras can be used to capture high-speed x-ray videos of events inside mechanical devices and biological specimens. The imaging speed is mainly limited by the phosphor screen decay rate and intensity gain which has a direct relationship on the camera&#x27;s exposure. Pulsed x-ray sources limit frame rate and should be properly synchronized with camera frame captures.

==Uses in warfare==
In 1950 Morton Sultanoff, a physicist for the U.S. Army at Aberdeen Proving ground, invented a super high-speed camera that took frames at one-millionth of a second, and was fast enough to record the shock wave of a small explosion. High Speed digital cameras have been used to study how mines dropped from the air will deploy in near-shore regions, including development of various weapon systems. In 2005 high speed digital cameras with 4 megapixel resolution, recording at 1500 fps, were replacing the 35mm and 70mm high speed film cameras used on tracking mounts on test ranges that capture ballistic intercepts.

<text>Hassan Ebrahim Habibi (; 29 January 1937 – 31 January 2013) was an Iranian politician, lawyer, scholar and the first vice president from 1989 until 2001 under Presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami. He was also a member of the High Council of Cultural Revolution and head of Academy of Persian Language and Literature from 2004 until his death in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Habibi studied sociology in France. He held a PhD in law and sociology. When he was a university student he visited Khomeini while the latter was in exile.

==Career==
Habibi was tasked by Ayatollah Khomeini to draft the prospective constitution of Iran when the latter was in exile in Paris. His version was heavily modified due to criticisms and the final text was approved by the election in November 1979.

Following the Iranian revolution, Habibi was named public spokesman for the revolutionary council. He was among the main architects of the first draft of Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which was later passed for more discussion to an elected Assembly of Experts for Constitution. The assembly made significant changes in the original draft, e.g. by introducing the new position of &quot;leader of the Islamic Republic&quot; based on Khomeini&#x27;s concept of Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists, which gave almost unlimited power to the clergy. The modified version was approved in a popular referendum in 1979. In the 1980 presidential election, Habibi ran for office, but received only ten percent of the vote against Banisadr&#x27;s seventy percent. Habibi was backed by Mohammad Beheshti in the election process. In the same year he won a parliamentary seat, being a representative of the Islamic Republican Party.

Habibi served as the minister of justice under Prime Minister Mousavi. He was first vice president of Iran from 1989 to 2001, eight years under President Rafsanjani and then four years under President Khatami. He was replaced by Mohammad Reza Aref in the post in Khatami&#x27;s second term. He was also head of the Academy of Persian Language and Literature and a member of the Expediency Council.

==Death==
Habibi died on 31 January 2013. He was buried at the mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini in Tehran on 1 February. The funeral service was attended by leading Iranian political figures, including President Ahmedinejad.

==Work==
Habibi is the author of several books, including &quot;God&quot; (1981), &quot;Society, Culture, Politics&quot; (1984), &quot;Islam and the Crisis of Our Time&quot; (1984), &quot;In the Mirror Of Rights: Views Of International Rights, Comparative Rights And Sociology&quot; (1988), &quot;Seeking the Roots&quot; (editing &amp; translation) (1994), &quot;Casework of An Ages Student&quot; (1997), &quot;One Word Out Of Thousands&quot; (2 vol.) (1998-2001) and &quot;General International Rights&quot; (2 vol.) (2003).

==Political affiliation ==
Habibi was director of the National Front publications in Europe during the 1960s. In the capacity, he was involved in publication and distribution of &quot;Payam-e-Daneshjou&quot;, organ of the party&#x27;s student wing.

Habibi was a member of the Freedom Movement of Iran, before he defected to the Islamic Republican Party after the Iranian Revolution.

<text>Jeetendra (born Ravi Kapoor ; 7 April 1942) is an Indian actor who is known for his work in Hindi cinema. He has worked in more than 200 films in a career spanning over six decades.

Jeetendra began his acting career with &quot;Geet Gaya Patharon Ne&quot; (1964). He shot to stardom in 1967 with &quot;Farz&quot;, and achieved greater success in later years, being dubbed India&#x27;s &quot;Jumping Jack&quot; for several of his on-screen roles in Hindi films. He consistently starred in several top–grossing Indian films from the late-1960s to the 1980s, such as &quot;Jeene Ki Raah&quot;, &quot;Khilona&quot;, &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Bidaai&quot;, &quot;Udhar Ka Sindur&quot;, &quot;Dharam Veer&quot;, &quot;Swarg Narak&quot;, &quot;Jaani Dushman&quot;, &quot;Aasha&quot;, &quot;Meri Aawaz Suno&quot;, &quot;Farz Aur Kanoon&quot;, &quot;Himmatwala&quot;, &quot;Tohfa&quot;, &quot;Maqsad&quot;, &quot;Swarag Se Sunder&quot;, &quot;Khudgarz&quot; and &quot;Thanedaar&quot;, as well as some of his acclaimed performances, include &quot;Boond Jo Ban Gayee Moti&quot;, &quot;Mere Huzoor&quot;, &quot;Dharti Kahe Pukar Ke&quot;, &quot;Humjoli&quot;, &quot;Parichay&quot;, &quot;Khushboo&quot;, &quot;Kinara&quot;, &quot;Priyatama&quot;, &quot;Lok Parlok&quot;, &quot;Takkar&quot;, &quot;Jyoti&quot;, &quot;Pyaasa Sawan&quot; and &quot;Sanjog&quot;. In the early-2000s, he became the chairman of Balaji Motion Pictures which emerged as one of the leading production houses in Hindi cinema.

== Early life ==
Jeetendra was born in a Punjabi family as Ravi Kapoor in Amritsar, Punjab, to Amarnath and Krishna Kapoor, whose business dealt with imitation jewellery, supplied to film industry. He attended St. Sebastian&#x27;s Goan High School in Mumbai with his friend Rajesh Khanna and then studied at Siddharth College in Mumbai. While supplying jewellery to V. Shantaram, he was cast as Sandhya&#x27;s character&#x27;s double in the 1964 movie &quot;Geet Gaya Patharon Ne&quot; after which his career never turned back.

== Career ==
===1964–1971: Debut and breakthrough===

Jeetendra began his career in 1964 playing the lead in V. Shantaram&#x27;s &quot;Geet Gaya Patharon Ne&quot; alongside Rajshree. Despite heavy promotions and positive reviews, the film proved to be an unsuccessful venture domestically. After a brief period of absence from films, he established himself with Ravikant Nagaich&#x27;s spy thriller &quot;Farz&quot; in 1967. A remake of Telugu film &quot;Gudachari 116&quot; (1966), it emerged a blockbuster at the box office and made Jeetendra a star. The music of &quot;Farz&quot; was one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1960s. Majority of its songs like – &quot;Mast Baharon Ka Main Aashiq&quot;, &quot;Baar Baar Din Ye Aaye – Happy Birthday To You&quot;, both solos by Mohammed Rafi and &quot;Hum To Tere Aashiq Hain&quot;, a duet by Mukesh and Lata Mangeshkar remain popular till date. In 1968, he had three releases – &quot;Suhaag Raat&quot;, &quot;Aulad&quot; and &quot;Mere Huzoor&quot;. While, &quot;Suhaag Raat&quot; and &quot;Aulad&quot; were critical and commercial failures, the lattermost co-starring Raaj Kumar and Mala Sinha received positive response from reviewers and did decent business at the box office.

In 1969, Jeetendra had three major commercial successes with L. V. Prasad&#x27;s &quot;Jeene Ki Raah&quot;, T. R. Ramanna&#x27;s &quot;Waris&quot; and Ravikant Nagaich&#x27;s &quot;Jigri Dost&quot;. He began the 1970s with Chander Vohra&#x27;s &quot;Khilona&quot; which also had Sanjeev Kumar and Mumtaz in the lead. The film emerged a huge hit with all the three leads receiving praise for their respective performances. He delivered another superhit that year with T. R. Ramanna&#x27;s &quot;Humjoli&quot; which was a remake of blockbuster Tamil film &quot;Panakkara Kudumbam&quot; (1964). In 1971, Jeetendra starred alongside Asha Parekh in Nasir Hussain&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Caravan&quot;. The film proved to be a superhit domestically and an &quot;All Time Blockbuster&quot; in overseas markets, especially China where it went on to become the highest-grossing foreign film, surpassing Raj Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951). The soundtrack of &quot;Caravan&quot; composed by R. D. Burman was a huge chartbuster and one of the best-selling Hindi film albums of the 1970s.

===1972–1979: Career slump and return to prominence===

Despite kicking off the new decade on a successful note, Jeetendra saw a bad phase from 1972 to 1973 as majority of his films, such as &quot;Ek Hasina Do Diwane&quot; (1972), &quot;Shaadi Ke Baad&quot; (1972), &quot;Yaar Mera&quot; (1972), &quot;Roop Tera Mastana&quot; (1972), &quot;Anokhi Ada&quot; (1973) and &quot;Gehri Chaal&quot; (1973), all flopped commercially. During this phase, he saw moderate successes in &quot;Bhai Ho To Aisa&quot; (1972) and &quot;Jaise Ko Taisa&quot; (1973) and received praise for his portrayal of a kind-hearted tuition teacher in Gulzar&#x27;s light-hearted drama &quot;Parichay&quot; (1972). The song &quot;Musafir Hoon Yaroon&quot; from &quot;Parichay&quot; was listed at #25 in the Binaca Geetmala annual list 1973 and is considered to be one of the most loved &quot;filmi&quot; songs of all time.

In 1974, Jeetendra played the lead in L. V. Prasad&#x27;s &quot;Bidaai&quot; co-starring Leena Chandavarkar and Durga Khote. The film proved to be a blockbuster at the box office thus ending his dry run and also emerging one of the top 5 highest-grossing films of that year. In 1975, he reunited with Gulzar for the romantic drama &quot;Khushboo&quot;. Based on Sarat Chandra Chatterjee&#x27;s Bengali novel &quot;Panditmashai&quot;, it was well received by the masses as well as the critics. The following year, he delivered three more commercial successes with &quot;Suntan&quot;, &quot;Udhar Ka Sindur&quot; and &quot;Nagin&quot; (in which he played a small role).

1977 proved to be a big one for Jeetendra with many successes. He had a massive blockbuster in Manmohan Desai&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Dharam Veer&quot;, also starring Dharmendra, Zeenat Aman and Neetu Singh. In United Kingdom, the film had 23 shows in 5 cities. Driven by the success of Rafi&#x27;s songs, the film took a record initial of £50,000 in the UK, equivalent to . In addition, the film sold 32 million tickets in the Soviet Union. The huge success of &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; was followed by a superhit in J. Om Prakash&#x27;s third directional venture &quot;Apnapan&quot;. That same year, his final collaboration with Gulzar took place for another romance film &quot;Kinara&quot; opposite Hema Malini. The film is widely remembered for its heartwarming premise and the song &quot;Naam Gum Jayega&quot; sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Bhupinder Singh. Jeetendra&#x27;s good run continued in 1978 with a superhit in Dasari Narayana Rao&#x27;s family drama film &quot;Swarg Narak&quot; which was a remake of director&#x27;s own Telugu film &quot;Swargam Narakam&quot;. He also had hits in Ram Maheshwari&#x27;s &quot;Karmayogi&quot; alongside Raaj Kumar and K. Bapayya&#x27;s &quot;Dil Aur Deewaar&quot; co-starring Ashok Kumar. He concluded the decade on a high with one more blockbuster in Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s ensemble horror thriller &quot;Jaani Dushman&quot; and a hit in Anil Ganguly&#x27;s drama film &quot;Khandaan&quot;. He also appeared in T. Rama Rao&#x27;s fantasy comedy &quot;Lok Parlok&quot; which ended up as an average fare.

With continuous flow of hits from 1974 to 1979, Jeetendra solidified his star-status.

===1980–1990: Widespread success===

Jeetendra reached his peak in the early-1980s and enjoyed a strong innings throughout the decade. His first release of 1980 was J. Om Prakash&#x27;s drama film &quot;Aasha&quot; which went on to become a massive blockbuster and remains his biggest solo hit till date. Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal dominated the musical charts and was one of the best selling Hindi film albums of the decade. His next release was Ravi Chopra&#x27;s big-budget action thriller &quot;The Burning Train&quot; in which he co-starred alongside Dharmendra, Vinod Khanna, Hema Malini, Parveen Babi and Neetu Singh. The film did average business at the time of release, but received praise for its well-choreographed action sequences as well as performances of the cast and attained cult status in later years. After having fair runners in the form of &quot;Takkar&quot; and &quot;Nishana&quot;, he concluded the year with three back-to-back hits in &quot;Jyoti Bane Jwala&quot;, &quot;Judaai&quot; and &quot;Maang Bharo Sajana&quot;. In 1981, Jeetendra starred in S. V. Rajendra Singh Babu&#x27;s action crime film &quot;Meri Aawaz Suno&quot;. A remake of mega hit Kannada film &quot;Antha&quot;, it ran into controversies due to its bold subject, but opened to excellent audience response and proved to be a huge blockbuster at the box office. The same year, he had a superhit in &quot;Ek Hi Bhool&quot; and couple of successes with films, such as &quot;Waqt Ki Deewar&quot;, &quot;Sharda&quot;, &quot;Jyoti&quot;, &quot;Shakka&quot; and &quot;Pyaasa Sawan&quot;. With his last few films doing extremely well at ticket counters, Jeetendra decided to produce and star in H. S. Rawail&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Deedar-E-Yaar&quot; (1982) under his home banner Tirupati Films. The film which also had Rekha, Rishi Kapoor and Tina Munim in the lead, failed to live up to the expectations and proved to be a major box office flop with minimal recovery of the investment. After this unexpected debacle, Jeetendra made a solemn vow never to return into filmmaking again. Despite the disastrous response to &quot;Deedar-E-Yaar&quot;, his other releases that year performed well commercially. He delivered two superhits in &quot;Farz Aur Kanoon&quot; and &quot;Jeeo Aur Jeene Do&quot;, a hit film &quot;Samraat&quot;, followed by five more successful films, &quot;Chorni&quot;, &quot;Badle Ki Aag&quot;, &quot;Insaan&quot;, &quot;Apna Bana Lo&quot; and &quot;Dharam Kanta&quot; to go with the major grossers. 1983 proved to be one of the best years of Jeetendra&#x27;s career with many successes. He first starred in K. Raghavendra Rao&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;Himmatwala&quot;. A remake of the Telugu film &quot;Ooruki Monagadu&quot;, it emerged a blockbuster with two songs, &quot;Nainon Mein Sapna&quot; and &quot;Taki O Taki&quot; topping the musical charts. The huge success of &quot;Himmatwala&quot; made Sridevi a big star and she formed a hit pair with Jeetendra. His other notable releases of the year were – &quot;Arpan&quot;, &quot;Nishaan&quot;, &quot;Jaani Dost&quot;, &quot;Justice Chaudhury&quot; and &quot;Mawaali&quot;. While the latter two were hits, &quot;Arpan&quot;, &quot;Nishaan&quot; and &quot;Jaani Dost&quot; ended up as moderate commercial successes.

In 1984, Jeetendra appeared in &quot;Tohfa&quot; which was a remake of Sobhan Babu starrer Telugu superhit &quot;Devatha&quot;. &quot;Tohfa&quot; like the original opened to excellent response and emerged a blockbuster as well as the highest earner of 1984. This was followed by hits in &quot;Maqsad&quot; and &quot;Qaidi&quot;, the same year. 1985 also proved to be a big one for Jeetendra with four of his films emerging commercial successes, these were - &quot;Haqeeqat&quot;, &quot;Balidaan&quot;, &quot;Pataal Bhairavi&quot; and &quot;Sanjog&quot;. The following year, he added one more blockbuster in his kitty with K. Bapayya&#x27;s family drama &quot;Swarag Se Sunder&quot; co-starring Mithun Chakraborty, Jaya Prada and Padmini Kolhapure. He also worked with Dilip Kumar in K. Raghavendra Rao&#x27;s actioner &quot;Dharm Adhikari&quot;. Despite the presence of some of the biggest stars of the time, the film failed to live up to the expectations and ended up as an average fare. After the underperformance of &quot;Dharm Adhikari&quot;, he reunited with T. Rama Rao for &quot;Dosti Dushmani&quot; alongside Rajinikanth and Rishi Kapoor, which emerged a box office hit. He also appeared in the successful films &quot;Ghar Sansar&quot;, &quot;Sadaa Suhagan&quot; and &quot;Locket&quot; and did a guest appearance in the superhit &quot;Jaal&quot;, the same year.

In 1987, Jeetendra played the lead in Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s directional debut &quot;Khudgarz&quot;. The film proved to be a superhit and established Roshan&#x27;s career as a director. The same year, he delivered two more commercial successes with &quot;Sindoor&quot; (in which he had a small role) and &quot;Insaaf Ki Pukar&quot;. Following a string of critical and commercial failures for the next two years, in 1990, Jeetendra starred in Raj N. Sippy&#x27;s actioner &quot;Thanedaar&quot; alongside Jaya Prada, Sanjay Dutt and Madhuri Dixit. The film backed up with chartbuster music went on to become a superhit venture at the box office. Apart from &quot;Thanedaar&quot;, his other commercially successful films that year, included &quot;Souten Ki Beti&quot;, &quot;Mera Pati Sirf Mera Hai&quot;, &quot;Sheshnaag&quot;, &quot;Agneekaal&quot; and &quot;Amiri Garibi&quot;.

===1991–present: Later career===

Post-1990, Jeetendra kapoor star power began to wane as his subsequent releases like &quot;Begunaah&quot; (1991), &quot;Ranbhoomi&quot; (1991), &quot;Sapnon Ka Mandir&quot; (1991), &quot;Yeh Raat Phir Na Aayegi&quot; (1992), &quot;Rishta Ho To Aisa&quot; (1992) and &quot;Insaaf Ki Devi&quot; (1992) failed to do well commercially. 

His last full-fledged Hindi film appearance was in Basit Khan&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Ho Jaata Hai Pyar&quot; (2005). It received negative response from reviewers and flopped at the box office. He then made a guest appearance in the song &quot;Deewangi Deewangi&quot; from Farah Khan&#x27;s reincarnation drama &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; (2007). 

In 2020, Jeetendra made his digital debut with the romantic web series &quot;Baarish&quot; which had Sharman Joshi and Asha Negi in the lead.

== Personal life ==

Jeetendra had met his wife, Shobha, when she was only 14. She completed school, went to college, and was employed as an Air Hostess with British Airways. When Jeetendra was struggling between 1960–66 to establish himself as an actor, he was in a relationship with Shobha and she was his girlfriend until 1972. It was not until the release of &quot;Bidaai&quot; on 18 October 1974, that Jeetendra and Shobha decided to get married, which they did in a simple ceremony at Janki Kutir with only a few family members and friends present. In her authorised biography, Hema Malini claimed that they almost got married, but she backed out.

Jeetendra and Shobha have two children from their marriage. Elder of them, daughter Ekta Kapoor, runs Balaji Telefilms while their son Tusshar Kapoor is also an actor. During an episode of &quot;The Kapil Sharma Show&quot;, when Jeetendra and Ekta Kapoor were the guests, he related an incident from 1976 where he was supposed to go to Madras (now Chennai) by flight on Karva Chauth. His flight got delayed and he went back home so that Shobha could perform the necessary rituals. Shobha refused to let him go back to the airport. So Jeetendra called his make-up man and told him to come back home, and that they would leave the next day. Around nighttime he looked outside from his flat and saw a fireball hurtling toward the airport. Later, after a couple of hours, his phone rang incessantly with people calling to find out what happened. The flight that he was supposed to have taken had crashed and was Indian Airlines Flight 171.

<doc id="1070746" wikidata="Q1572552" url="?curid=1070746" title="Ham House">
<text>Ham House is a 17th-century house set in formal gardens on the bank of the River Thames in Ham, south of Richmond in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The original house was completed in 1610 by Thomas Vavasour, an Elizabethan courtier and Knight Marshal to James I. It was then leased, and later bought, by William Murray, a close friend and supporter of Charles I. The English Civil War saw the house and much of the estate sequestrated, but Murray&#x27;s wife Catherine regained them on payment of a fine. During the Protectorate his daughter Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Dysart on her father&#x27;s death in 1655, successfully navigated the prevailing anti-royalist sentiment and retained control of the estate.

The house achieved its greatest period of prominence following Elizabeth&#x27;s second marriage—to John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, in 1672. The Lauderdales held important roles at the court of the restored Charles II, the Duke being a member of the Cabal ministry and holder of major positions in Scotland, while the Duchess exercised significant social and political influence. They began an ambitious program of development and embellishment at Ham. The house was almost doubled in size and equipped with private apartments for the Duke and Duchess, as well as princely accommodation suites for visitors. The house was furnished to the highest standards of courtly taste and decorated with &quot;a lavishness which transcended even what was fitting to their exalted rank&quot;. The Lauderdales accumulated notable collections of paintings, tapestries and furniture, and redesigned the gardens and grounds to reflect their status and that of their guests.

After the Duchess&#x27;s death, the property passed through the line of her descendants. Occasionally, major alterations were made to the house, such as the reconstruction undertaken by Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart, in the 1730s. For the most part, later generations of owners focused on the preservation of the house and its collections. The family did not retain the high position at court held by the Lauderdales under Charles II, and a strain of family eccentricity and reserve saw the fifth Earl refuse a request from King George III to visit Ham. On the death of the 9th Earl – the last Earl to live at Ham – in 1935, the house passed to his second cousin, Lyonel; he and his son, Major (Cecil) Lyonel Tollemache, donated it to the National Trust in 1948. During the second half of the 20th century the house and gardens were opened to the public, and were extensively restored and researched. The property has become a popular filming location for cinema and television productions, which make use of its period interiors and gardens.

The house is built of red brick, and was originally constructed to a traditional Elizabethan era H-plan; the southern, garden frontage was infilled during the Lauderdales&#x27; rebuilding. The architect of Vavasour&#x27;s house is unknown although drawings by Robert Smythson and his son John exist. The Lauderdales first consulted William Bruce, a cousin of the Duchess, but ultimately employed William Samwell to undertake their rebuilding. Ham retains many original Jacobean and Caroline features and furnishings, most in an unusually fine condition, and is a &quot;rare survival of 17th-century luxury and taste&quot;. The house is a Grade I listed building and received museum accreditation from Arts Council England in 2015. Its park and formal gardens are listed at Grade II*. Bridget Cherry, in the revised &quot;London: South&quot; Pevsner published in 2002, acknowledged that the exterior of Ham was &quot;not as attractive as other houses of this period&quot;, but noted the interior&#x27;s &quot;high architectural and decorative interest&quot;. The critic John Julius Norwich described the house as a &quot;time machine – enclosing one in the elegant, opulent world of van Dyck and Lely&quot;.

==The builders==
===Early years===

In the early 17th century the manors of Ham and Petersham were bestowed by James I on his son, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales. The original construction of Ham House was completed in 1610 by Sir Thomas Vavasour, Knight Marshal to James I. The Thames-side location was ideal for Vavasour, allowing him to move between the palaces at Richmond, Hampton, London and Windsor as his court role required. It originally comprised an H-plan layout consisting of nine bays and three storeys, as shown in a 1649 miniature by Alexander Marshal, but the lack of estate documentation makes it impossible to verify the names of persons involved in the design and construction of the house. Robert Smythson&#x27;s survey drawing of the house and gardens is a key record of the early structure. Prince Henry died in 1612, and the lands passed to James&#x27;s second son, Charles, several years before his coronation in 1625. After Vavasour&#x27;s death in 1620, the house was granted to John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness, until he died in 1626.

===William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart (1643–55)===
In 1626, Ham House was leased to William Murray, courtier, a close childhood friend and alleged whipping boy of Charles I. Murray&#x27;s initial lease was for 39 years and, in 1631, a further 14 years were added. When Gregory Cole, a neighbouring landowner, had to sell his property in Petersham as part of the enclosure of Richmond Park in 1637, he made over the remaining leases on his land to Murray. Shortly afterwards William and his wife Katherine (or Catherine) engaged the services of skilled craftsmen, including the artist Francis Cleyn and the painter Matthew Goodrich (or Goodricke), to begin improvements on the house as befitting a Lord of the Manors of Ham and Petersham. He extended the Great Hall and added an arch that leads to the ornate cantilever staircase to create a processional route for guests as they approached the dining room on the first floor. He remodelled the Long Gallery and added the adjoining Green Closet that was influenced by Charles I&#x27;s own &quot;Cabbonett Room&quot; at Whitehall Palace, to which Murray had donated two pieces. As part of the Whitehall Group, Murray would have been in touch with the latest tastes in art and architecture at court.


In 1640 William was also granted a lease on the nearby Manor of Canbury, now in Kingston upon Thames, but in the run-up to civil war in 1641 he signed over the house to Katherine and his four daughters, appointing trustees to safeguard the estate for them. The principal of these was Thomas Bruce, 1st Earl of Elgin, a relative of his wife and an important Scottish Presbyterian, Parliamentarian supporter and ally of the Puritan party in London. Murray was raised to the peerage as Earl of Dysart in 1643, although his elevation appears not to have been confirmed at that time. As a Scottish title, the earldom could be inherited by daughters, as well as by sons.

Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War, the house and estates were sequestrated, but persistent appeals by Katherine regained them in 1646 on payment of a £500 fine.
Katherine skilfully defended her ownership of the house throughout the Civil War and Commonwealth, and it remained in the family&#x27;s possession despite Murray&#x27;s close ties with the Royalist cause. Katherine died at Ham on 18 July 1649 (Charles I had been executed on 30 January of the same year). The Parliamentarians sold off much of the Royal Estate, including the Manors of Ham and Petersham. These, including Ham House, were bought for £1,131.18s on 13 May 1650 by William Adams, the steward acting on behalf of Murray&#x27;s eldest daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet of Helmingham Hall, Suffolk. Ham House became Elizabeth and Lionel&#x27;s primary residence, as Murray was in exile abroad, predominantly in France.

===Elizabeth, Countess of Dysart (1655–98) and Sir Lionel Tollemache Bt. (1640–69)===
Elizabeth and Lionel Tollemache were married in 1648. He was from a family of Royalists who had estates in Suffolk, Northamptonshire and London, and they celebrated their union at Ham with a display of arms that can be seen in the spandrels of the arch above the main entrance to the house: on the left an earl&#x27;s coronet above the Tollemache horse&#x27;s head and on the right the Tollemache argent a fret sable quartering Murray.

When her father died in 1655 Elizabeth became the 2nd Countess of Dysart in her own right, but at that time during the Interregnum the title would have held little prestige. Of far more interest to the Protectorate authorities was the matter of Elizabeth&#x27;s allegiance. Her parents&#x27; activities during the Civil War had raised suspicion among both Royalists and Parliamentarians, and similar speculation attached to Elizabeth, which was heightened when she began a close relationship with Oliver Cromwell in the early 1650s. Her family and connections provided the perfect cover for an agent, especially a double agent, and her movements were closely monitored by both Royalist and Parliamentarian spies.

Between 1649 and 1661, Elizabeth bore eleven children, five of whom survived to adulthood; Lionel, Thomas, William, Elizabeth, and Catherine. Elizabeth and Lionel made few substantial changes to the house during this busy time. On the Restoration in 1660, Charles II rewarded Elizabeth with a pension of £800 for life and, while many of the Parliamentarian sales of Royal lands were put aside, Elizabeth retained the titles to the Manors of Ham and Petersham. In addition, in about 1665, following William&#x27;s death, Lionel was granted freehold of of land in Ham and Petersham including that surrounding the house and a 61-year lease of of demesne lands. The grant was made in trust to Robert Murray for the daughters of the, then, late Earl of Dysart, &quot;in consideration of the service done by the late Earl of Dysart and his Daughter, and of the losses sustained by them by the enclosure of the New Park&quot;. Lionel died in 1669, leaving his Ham and Petersham estate to Elizabeth along with Framsden Hall in Suffolk, which had been her jointure on their marriage.

===Elizabeth and John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale (1645–82)===

Elizabeth may have become acquainted with John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale at some time in the 1640s, when he was one of the Scottish Commissioners on the Committee of Both Kingdoms who petitioned for her father&#x27;s release on charges of treason in 1646. She felt sufficient gratitude towards him to claim in later years that she appealed to Cromwell to show clemency following his capture after the Battle of Worcester, a gesture Maitland repaid in his will when he left her £1,500 in gold for &quot;preserving my life when I was a prisoner in the year 1651&quot;. They became much closer following the death of her husband and he began visiting Ham regularly. Already a favourite of the King, he was appointed High Commissioner for Scotland in August 1669 which, on top of his political influence as Secretary of State and participation in Charles&#x27;s Cabal ministry, made him one of the most powerful men in the country. In 1671 Lauderdale was granted by Letters patent full freehold rights to the Manors of Ham and Petersham and the 289 acres of leased land. In 1672 Elizabeth and Lauderdale were married, and soon afterwards he was created Duke of Lauderdale and Knight of the Garter. With Lauderdale&#x27;s part in the Cabal Ministry, the family remained close to the heart of court intrigue.
As Duchess and consort to a very political Duke, Elizabeth had risen to the peak of Restoration society where she could exercise her many talents and interests. Image was paramount and the Lauderdales began a programme of aggrandisement of their properties – Elizabeth consulted her cousin, William Bruce, and Maitland commissioned William Samwell, respectively amateur and professional architects. Ham was extended on the south front with an enfilade of rooms created each side of a central axis around a new downstairs Dining Room. Most grand houses at that time had apartments laid out in this way, comprising a suite of rooms approached one through the other. The original plan was to create the Duchess&#x27;s apartments to the left (east) and the Duke&#x27;s to the right, she having two closets for privacy and entertainment and he having a staircase connecting his bedroom to the library above, but Elizabeth appears to have changed her mind while the rooms were being built and eventually each came to have a bedchamber within the other&#x27;s apartment. This alteration may have been due to the installation of a bathroom downstairs which had to be near the kitchen (the source of hot water) in the basement at the Duke&#x27;s end of the house. Despite the swap of bedchambers, she retained her original closets at the east side of the house.

Closets formed an exclusive and very private end to the sequence into which only the most important guests were invited. Visitors knew that they would only progress through the rooms according to their rank or significance in society: being entertained in one of Elizabeth&#x27;s closets would have been an honour. Her White Closet was designed for entertaining and had a private door opening onto the Cherry Garden. It was decorated in the most advanced tastes of the day and according to the 1679 inventory that it had &quot;one Indian furnace for tee garnish&#x27;d wt silver&quot;, a luxury at a time when tea was only beginning to be drunk outside of exclusive royal residences. For this reason, too Elizabeth kept her tea secure in a &quot;Japan box&quot; in her adjoining Private Closet.

Upstairs the existing State Apartments (Great Dining Room, North Drawing Room and Long Gallery) were extended with the addition of a State Bedroom apartment. The bedchamber itself was being referred to as &quot;the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber&quot; in 1674 which suggests that Queen Catherine of Braganza, a friend of Elizabeth&#x27;s, had occupied it at least once. This was the most important room in the house and the focal point towards which one progressed on the first floor. Another benefit of transforming the house from single to double-pile – a &quot;pile&quot; is a row of rooms, single-pile houses have only one row while double-pile houses are two rows deep, often with a corridor between the rows – had been that it allowed the creation of hidden passages and staircases for servants who could now enter rooms via discreet jib doors rather than by moving through one room to get to another. Michael Wilson notes the &quot;positive warren&quot; of such passages at Ham.

The eldest daughter of Elizabeth and Lionel, also named Elizabeth (1659–1735), married Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll in Edinburgh in 1678. Their first child, John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll, was born at Ham House in 1680; their second son, Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll was born there a few years later.

The glorious years for the Lauderdales began to wane in 1680 when the Duke had a stroke and his influence declined. On his death in 1682 he left the Ham and Petersham property to Elizabeth, thereby securing the estate for the Tollemache dynasty. However, Elizabeth also inherited her husband&#x27;s debts including mortgages on his former properties in England and Scotland and her latter years were marred by a financial dispute with her brother-in-law, Charles Maitland, 3rd Earl of Lauderdale. Even the intervention of the newly crowned James II failed to reconcile them and the matter was finally settled in her favour in the Scottish courts in 1688. Although this may have suppressed Elizabeth&#x27;s lavish lifestyle, she went on to make further alterations to the house at Ham, opening the Hall ceiling and creating the Round Gallery in about 1690. As she got older her movements became restricted by gout and she rarely went upstairs, living mainly in what had been the Duke&#x27;s apartments, but her intellect remained and she liked to be kept informed about events at court and in politics. Elizabeth Maitland continued to live at Ham House until her death in 1698 at the age of 72.

==Architecture==

Ham House is a brick building of three storeys and nine bays, with a hip roof and ashlar dressings, representing two distinctively different architectural styles and periods. Michael Wilson, referencing Ham in his work, &quot;The English Country House and its furnishings&quot;, considers the later 17th century as the finest period of English brick building. The first phase is the original main house facing north-east to the river Thames, built in 1610 in the early Jacobean English renaissance style on a traditional H-plan for Thomas Vavasour, Knight Marshal at the court of James I. Simon Jenkins, in his study, &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Houses&quot;, records that the original entrance had a tower over the porch and flanking, projecting turrets, which were removed in subsequent reconstruction, and suggests that Vavasour&#x27;s original house may have been of an E-plan type. John Julius Norwich also notes the original configuration of the north front, which he considers &quot;forbidding&quot;, and the &quot;damson-coloured&quot; brickwork. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner, in the &quot;London: South&quot; volume of the Buildings of England series, record the &quot;not specially impressive&quot; nature of the remaining doorway but are clear that Ham was built to an H-plan. The architect of Vavasour&#x27;s house is not known although survey drawings by Robert and John Smythson exist.

The second phase of reconstruction is the ambitious expansion to the south or garden side of the original house by the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale in 1672 to display their high status in the court of King Charles II. They infilled the space between the southern wings of the H-plan building, almost doubling the volume of the house. Jenkins considers the Lauderdales&#x27; remodelling one of the earliest examples in England of the creation of a suite of state rooms for the accommodation and entertainment of royalty. Although the Lauderdales initially consulted William Bruce, the architect ultimately employed to undertake the reconstruction of their south front was William Samwell. Bruce did design the gates fronting the Thames on the north facade. 
The northern façade retains the Jacobean arched loggias on either side of the front door and also includes an array of marble and lead busts, which continue into the flanking courtyard walls. The southern Caroline façade is loosely based on a classical style introduced from the continent by the architect Inigo Jones (1573–1652). At the time the Lauderdales&#x27; remodelling project was considered impressive, the façades giving the impression of two separate houses, while the interior blends them harmoniously. Roger North, a contemporary aristocrat, amateur architect and critic, described the remodelling in his treatise, &quot;Of Building&quot;, and considered it as the best work he had seen. The renovation also included a very early installation of sash windows, a French invention which were refined with weights and pulleys in England. The east front of the house retains many of its 17th century windows, as well as the door to the Great Staircase and the door from the Duchess&#x27;s private apartments to the cherry garden. The west front of the house contains a mixture of 17th and 18th century windows and has long served as the service entrance to the house. Structures such as the bake house, still house, bath house, dairy and ice house were located to the west of the house, although some no longer survive.

===Listing designations===
Historic England is an organisation dedicated to the protection of England&#x27;s historic environment and is responsible for the listing of buildings. There are three available designations: Grade I, Grade II* and Grade II, with the first being applied to buildings of &quot;exceptional interest&quot;. The house is a Grade I listed building. Ham was also given Accredited Museum status in 2015, having demonstrated compliance with UK industry standards for museums and galleries. The Park and Garden has a Grade II* listing. A number of the surrounding features have a Grade II listing: the Forecourt, the entrance gates and railings, the Garden walls and gatepiers to the south, the Orangery (now used as a tea room), the Ice House, the service yard to the west of the house and the Gatehouse.

===Plan===
==Interiors and collections==
===Introduction===
Ham House is unusual in retaining much of its original 17th-century interior decoration, offering a rare experience of the style of the courts of Charles I and Charles II. Ham House&#x27;s rooms display collections of 17th-century paintings, portraits and miniatures, in addition to cabinets, tapestries and furniture amassed and retained by generations of the Murray and Tollemache families. Geoffrey Beard, in his study, &quot;The National Trust Book of English Furniture&quot;, noted the extraordinarily high quality of the Lauderdales&#x27; furnishing of the house, undertaken with &quot;a lavishness which transcended even what was fitting to their exalted rank&quot;. Bridget Cherry, in the &quot;London: South&quot; volume of the Pevsner Architectural Guides suggested that, while the exterior of Ham was &quot;not as attractive as other houses of this period&quot;, the &quot;high architectural and decorative interest&quot; of its interior should be recognised. John Julius Norwich considered the interiors, a &quot;time machine – enclosing one in the elegant, opulent world of van Dyck and Lely&quot;.

===Great Hall===

This room forms part of the original 1610 construction and is off-set from the centre, in the English Gothic and Tudor tradition. During this time, the hall may have been used for both dining and entertainment. The distinctive black and white marble chequerboard flooring is also believed to date from the original construction. By the early 18th century the room had been expanded upwards by opening the ceiling to the room above, now known as the Round Gallery. The room contains a number of large and notable paintings.

* &quot;Charlotte Walpole, Countess of Dysart (1738–1789)&quot;, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1775.
* John Constable, a family friend, was commissioned to make copies of two family portraits: &quot;Anna Maria Lewis, Countess of Dysart (1745–1804)&quot; as Miranda, painted in 1823 after Joshua Reynolds and &quot;Lady Louisa Tollemache, Countess of Dysart (1745–1840)&quot;, painted in 1823–25 after John Hoppner.
* Hanging side by side are John Vanderbank&#x27;s portraits of &quot;Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart (1708–1770)&quot; painted in 1730 and of his wife &quot;Lady Grace Carteret, Countess of Dysart (1713–1755)&quot;, signed and dated 1737.

===Chapel===

Formerly the family&#x27;s sitting room, this room was converted to a chapel during the major renovations of the 1670s. It was decorated with crimson velvet and damask wall hangings, which were changed to black velvet upon the Duke&#x27;s death in 1682. While designed for Protestant worship, the chapel was used in the late 19th century by the wife of the 8th Earl for Roman Catholic services. The sumptuous and rare 17th-century textiles require that the light levels remain low, in order to minimise damage.

===Great Staircase===

The Great Staircase, described by the historian Christopher Rowell as &quot;remarkable&quot; and &quot;apparently without a close parallel in the British Isles&quot;, was created for William Murray at the east end of the Great Hall in 1638–39 as part of a series of improvements to the house which reflected his rising status at Court. An ornately carved archway marks the entrance from the Great Hall to the stairs, which were designed as a grand processional route giving access to the State Apartments on the first floor. The cantilever staircase rises over three floors above a square stairwell. The balustrade is composed of boldly hand-carved pierced wooden panels depicting trophies of war. Each panel is different, with varying images on each face of arms and armour, including a set of horse armour. The wide range of arms includes field guns with cannonballs and barrels of gunpowder, swords, shields, quivers of arrows and halberds. Dolphins, elephant heads, dragons and other fantastical creatures also appear on the dado panelling, together with military drums and trumpets. The martial theme of these panels is interspersed with drops of relief carvings of bay leaves, richly carved newel posts topped with baskets of fruit designed to carry candles or candelabra, and miniature swags decorating the outer string. Originally gilded and grained to resemble walnut, in the 19th century the balustrade and other woodwork were picked out in bronze, traces of which survive. According to Rowell, &quot;There is no other architectural wood carving on this scale and of such sophistication surviving from the late 1630s.&quot;

A collection of 17th century copies of old master paintings in their original carved frames hangs on the staircase wall. Two were copied from originals in the collection of Charles I: &quot;Venus with Mercury and Cupid&quot; (The &quot;School of Love&quot;) by Correggio at the base of the stairs (the original in the National Gallery, London), while on the first floor landing there is a copy of &quot;The Venus Del Pardo (Venus and a Satyr)&quot; by Titian (the original in the Louvre, Paris).

===Round Gallery===
Before the upward expansion of the Great Hall this room had served as the Great Dining Room, as created by William Murray in the 1630s. The ornate white plasterwork ceiling was created by Joseph Kinsman, master craftsman and member of the London Plasterers&#x27; Company. Engaged by the Royal Works at Goldsmith&#x27;s Hall, Whitehall and Somerset House, he was employed by William Murray at Ham House during the 1637 renovation and creation of the State Apartments. The ceilings at Ham are the only surviving example of his work, showing the influence of Inigo Jones in their design of deep beams with rosettes at the intersections, enclosing geometric compartments. The white plaster high relief oval swags of luscious fruit, flowers and ribbons, including the odd worm, contrasted with the elaborate frieze which was originally coloured blue and gold.

Notable paintings include Peter Lely&#x27;s final portrait of Elizabeth, painted c. 1680, and the earlier double portrait, &quot;John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale and Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Dysart and Duchess of Lauderdale&quot; painted by Lely c. 1675.

===North Drawing Room===

After dinner in the adjacent dining room, guests would have retired to the North Drawing Room for conversation. This room was decorated at the same time as the Great Dining Room, and was later hung with tapestries. Kinsman continued his elaborate plasterwork in the white ceiling in this room. Deep beams enclose rectangles bursting with individually crafted fruit and flowers. The hemispherical rosettes at the intersections are unusual, possibly unique.

A notable piece of furniture in this room is the ivory cabinet: veneered in rippled ivory panels on the exterior and the interior, this large oak and cedar cabinet opens to reveal 14 drawers. An inner door conceals small drawers, further secret drawers and a compartment. It was recorded as being moved to the prestigious Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber shortly after its appearance in the 1677 inventory and is considered the most impressive piece of furniture designed or bought for the house (with the exception of the State Bed, which no longer exists). The cabinet may have been made in the Northern Netherlands based on furniture inlaid in ivory brought back in 1644 by John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, the former Governor of Dutch Brazil for his home in The Hague, now called the Mauritshuis. 
Also notable in the room are a vibrant set of tapestries. James I established the Mortlake Tapestry Works in 1619 just three miles from Ham House, from which the Lauderdales had purchased a set of tapestries showing the seasons incorporating gold thread for the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber. While these are no longer at the house, the 4th Earl of Dysart acquired a set woven in Lambeth in 1699–1719 by the ex-Mortlake weaver Stephen de May, probably to the Mortlake design. Altered to hang in the North Drawing Room, this set of &quot;The Seasons&quot; was originally commissioned by the 1st Lord Shelburne. Tapestries were important in Europe for comfort in draughty manor houses and as status objects because of their expense. Sets with designs showing the seasons or months were popular and had a number of variations depicting appropriate seasonal activities such as milking for April, ploughing and sowing for September, and wine-making for October.

===Long Gallery===

The Long Gallery was part of the original 1610 house, but was extensively redecorated in 1639 by William Murray. It has been used as an exercise space as well as a gallery to showcase portraits of family and important royal connections. Notable paintings include:

* &quot;Sir John Maitland, 1st Baron Maitland of Thirlestane (1543–1595), aged 44&quot; attributed to Adrian Vanson. In late 2016 an X-ray revealed that underneath the main painting was another, unfinished portrait likely of Mary, Queen of Scots, dated 1589—two years after her execution. According to the National Trust, this painting &quot;shows that portraits of the queen were being copied and presumably displayed in Scotland around the time of her execution, a highly contentious and potentially dangerous thing to be seen doing&quot;.
* &quot;King Charles I (1600–1649)&quot; by Sir Anthony van Dyck and studio. In recognition of their friendship this painting was given by Charles I to William Murray; a 1638–39 memorandum of pictures bought by the King from Van Dyck includes framed pictures, one of which is believed to be this portrait.
*&quot;Colonel The Hon. John Russell (1620–1681)&quot; by John Michael Wright is signed and dated 1659.
* Of the 15 portraits by Peter Lely in Ham House, 11 are hung in the Long Gallery. These include &quot;Elizabeth Murray with a Black Servant&quot;, &quot;John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale (1616–1682) in Garter robes&quot;, and &quot;Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh KG (1630–1673) in Garter robes&quot;.

Picture frames at Ham House date from the 17th century and its Long Gallery portraits are a showcase of elaborately carved, gilded frames in the auricular style (literally &#x27;of the ear&#x27;). Two frames date from the 1630s, &quot;Charles I&quot; and &quot;Henrietta Maria&quot;. Later frames, for instance on the portraits of &quot;Elizabeth Murray with a Black Servant&quot; and &quot;Lady Margaret Murray, Lady Maynard&quot; are in a similar auricular style with straight sight edges. These frames, referred to as Sunderland frames, are distinguished by their irregular sight edges. They take their name from the 2nd Earl of Sunderland, who displayed many pictures at his estate Althorp framed in this style. There are examples of Sunderland frames on the portraits of &quot;John Maitland, Duke of Lauderdale (1616–1682) in Garter Robes&quot; and &quot;Colonel The Hon. John Russell (1620–1681)&quot;.

This room also displays some notable furniture:

* Floral marquetry cabinet: Ham House has a number of tables and cabinets decorated with floral marquetry including this, the earliest inventoried example in England, dating from 1675. The naturalistic representations of flowers and fruit are cut from contrasting woods such as ebony, walnut and stained fruitwood and laid onto the carcass. The woods and other materials were often dyed to create a greater range of colours and the green leaves on this piece are made from stained ivory or bone. This cabinet, as well as other tables and a mirror in the house, is attributed by the National Trust to Gerrit Jensen, who was the cabinet maker in ordinary to Catherine of Braganza. 
* Japanese lacquered cabinet: Japanese lacquered furniture was fashionable in the 17th century and this cabinet from 1650 remains in the Long Gallery where it has stood since then. Decorated with hills, trees and birds in raised gold and silver lacquer, the doors open on engraved brass hinges to reveal 10 drawers. The giltwood stand has four legs carved as elephant trunks topped with winged cherub busts. 
* Chinese lacquered chest: China was another Asian source of lacquered furniture in the 17th century. Decorated with watery landscapes and branches, this chest is lacquered in gold and red on a dark crimson ground. It was a standard form of storage chest for linens and other textiles. The English stand c. 1730 is japanned, a technique developed by English and European craftsmen to approximate the hard, smooth and shiny surfaces of popular Asian lacquered goods.

===Green Closet===

Used for the display of miniature paintings and smaller-scale furniture, in contrast to the Long Gallery, this room is a very rare survival of a room in the style of Charles I&#x27;s court. In the 1630s the Green Closet was specifically designed by William Murray to display miniatures and small paintings. The ceiling paintings are tempera on paper, and represent some of Franz Cleyn&#x27;s best surviving work. Two preliminary drawings for the &quot;capricci&quot; of putti by Cleyn and an associate are held by the University of Southampton.

Today it contains 87 items including &quot;Queen Elizabeth I (1533–1603)&quot; painted c. 1590 by Nicholas Hilliard, and &quot;A Man Consumed by Flames&quot; painted c. 1610 by Isaac Oliver.

===Library===

The Library dates from the 1672–74 enlargement of the house. The architectural historian Mark Girouard considers it probably &quot;the oldest country house library&quot; still in existence. Although some shelves were moved from what is now the Queen&#x27;s Antechamber, most of the cedar fixed furniture, including the secretaire, was provided by Henry Harlow. The Duke of Lauderdale added substantially to the contents: he was an avid reader and collector (so much so that his Highgate house was said to be in danger of collapse due to the weight of his substantial book collection), and he owed huge sums to booksellers when he died. Mark Purcell, in his 2017 study &quot;The Country House Library&quot;, notes that the probate inventory undertaken on the Duke&#x27;s death estimated the value of his books at half of the total worth of the house&#x27;s chattels. Many volumes were sold at auctions between 1688 and 1692, in part due to the Duchess&#x27;s money difficulties upon the Duke&#x27;s death.

Later members of the family rebuilt the collection, notably the 4th Earl who bought at the Harleian auction and elsewhere. He acquired 12 books printed by William Caxton and many other incunabula; in 1904 a visitor, William Younger Fletcher, described the library as containing books of greater value, in proportion to its size, than any other in Europe. Most of the books were sold in 1938, and the bulk of the remainder after the Second World War. A notable exception, a Book of Common Prayer from Whitehall Palace, is sometimes on display in the chapel.

After the war Norman Norris, a Brighton book dealer, assembled a collection of books from a range of post-war country house sales. He bequeathed the collection to the National Trust and many eventually came to Ham, primarily those pre-dating the mid-18th century. One, &quot;Jus Parliamentarium&quot;, which has the Dysart coat of arms on its cover, is from the Dysart collection. The ceiling and friezes in the room display a lively naturalism. Two globes with rare leather covers (acquired in 1745 and 1746) and two fire screens (1743) are notable.

===Queen&#x27;s Apartments===
This suite of three rooms, now referred to as the Queen&#x27;s Apartments, was created by the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale when the house was enlarged in 1673. Intended for use by Catherine of Braganza, they reflect the latest innovations from France, where royalty received important visitors in the State Bedchamber. The rooms are decorated with increasing splendour, beginning with the relatively modest Antechamber, culminating in the small but richly gilded and decorated Queen&#x27;s Closet.

====Antechamber====
The first of the suite of rooms is the antechamber, where visitors would wait for an audience with the Queen. The ceiling of this waiting room is the first of the three ceilings by the plasterer Henry Wells. A circular garland of leaves is thickly studded with small flowers, surrounded by four spandrels containing foliage and ribbons. The oak parquet floor, an innovation from France, continues through to the far side of the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber where it is then replaced with a more elaborate marquetry design where the State Bed would have stood. The blue velvet and damask wall hangings, installed during the period 1679–1683, are extremely rare survivals.

====Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber====

This room, built on the central axis of the house, was designed for the reception of guests and visiting dignitaries who would have waited to be summoned from the Antechamber. The State Bed stood prominently on a raised dais at the east end of the room facing the door. A balustrade separated the bed from the main area of the room where visitors may have gathered for their audience with the Queen. The bed was on an elaborate marquetry floor inlaid with the cipher and ducal coronet of the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale, their initials J, E and L entwined in cedar and walnut, a feature that repeats in the Queens&#x27;s Closet. The floor remains in excellent condition. This ceiling has the richest plaster decoration in the house, a large deep oval of bay leaves dotted with roses. These cluster more densely at the east end, above the area of the Queen&#x27;s State Bed. The spandrels are also more decorative, acanthus leaves swirl to fill the panels, each corner hiding a grotesque figure among the foliage or bursting from the flowers.

The bed had been removed by 1728 and the rooms were closed and rarely used, contributing to their excellent state of preservation. The change of use to a drawing room took place in the mid‑18th century with the lowering of the dais in line with the rest of the floor, and the purchase of new furniture and a set of William Bradshaw&#x27;s popular early 18th century pastoral tapestries. Woven in 1734–40 for Henry O&#x27;Brien, 8th Earl of Thomond, and purchased in 1742 for £184 on behalf of the 4th Earl of Dysart, the tapestries needed only slight alterations to fit three of the walls of his newly decorated drawing room. Bradshaw&#x27;s signature can be seen on The &quot;Dance&quot; tapestry. Woven in Soho, London, the four wool and silk tapestries have narrow borders in the style of picture frames and are thought to incorporate several different images from works by the French painters Antoine Watteau, Nicolas Lancret and Jean-Baptiste Pater.

====Queen&#x27;s Closet====
The smallest, most intimate of the suite of rooms, the third and final room was designed for private use and could be closed off, away from the business of the State Bedchamber. Rarely used and preserved largely intact, the decoration, textiles and furniture give a unique record of late 17th century interior decoration. The marquetry floor incorporating the ducal coronet and cipher continues from the Bedchamber into the Closet. The ceiling painting of Ganymede and the Eagle is in the style of the Italian artist Antonio Verrio (1636–1707). Framed by a plaster garland, following the designs of the previous rooms, the richness of the effect is emphasised by gilding of the roses. Three ceiling paintings, again in the style of Verrio, of cupids sprinkling flowers, are partly hidden from view above the alcove. The elaborate chimney piece, hearth and windowsill, again including the Lauderdale cipher and ducal coronet, are made from scagliola, possibly the earliest documented example of scagliola in this country.

===Private Closet===

This was the Duchess&#x27;s most private and intimate room where she would read, write and entertain her closest family and friends. The elaborate oil on plaster ceilings in both of the Duchess&#x27;s closets are by Antonio Verrio. They are among his earliest commissions in England, and his earliest surviving work following his arrival from France in 1672. As his reputation grew he was commissioned by royal and aristocratic clients for larger projects including for Charles II at Windsor Castle, interiors for the Earl of Exeter at Burghley House and for William III at Hampton Court. The ceiling painting of &quot;The Penitent Magdalene Surrounded by Putti Holding Emblems of Time, Death and Eternity&quot; was completed around 1675. The central figure floats above the room, circled by three putti carrying symbols of time (an hourglass), death (a skull), and eternity (a snake eating its own tail). Verrio linked the ceiling design to the room by enclosing it in a narrow painted grey marble surround, matching the marble fireplace. The room also contains a portrait of &quot;Catherine Bruce, Mrs William Murray (d. 1649)&quot;, by John Hoskins the Elder, a watercolour on vellum in an ebony travelling case, signed and dated 1638.

===White Closet===
Adjoining the Private Closet and richly decorated, this room was used by the Duchess for relaxing and entertaining, its double glazed door leading out to the Cherry Garden. The coved ceiling of this glamorous room, originally decorated with white silk hangings and marble effect walls, emphasises the advanced taste of the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale in a room intended for their most important visitors. Painted by Verrio in oil on plaster in 1673/74, it is described by the art historians Peter Thornton and Maurice Tomlin as &quot;decorated with one of the earliest examples of Baroque illusionism to have been executed in a domestic interior in this country&quot;. Putti climb up over a trompe l&#x27;oeil balustrade to reach the figures of &quot;Divine Wisdom Presiding Over The Liberal Arts&quot;, represented by seven mainly female figures bearing the symbols of Verrio&#x27;s version of the liberal arts. The figure of Wisdom floats on clouds pointing to the all-seeing eye in the open sky above. Verrio linked the ceiling design to the room by enclosing it in a narrow painted red marble surround, matching the red marble fireplace, as in the Private Closet. The heavily gilded coving includes medallions of the four Cardinal virtues. Notable collection items include:

*&quot;Ham House from the South&quot; (1675–79) by Hendrick Danckerts depicts a finely dressed couple (possibly the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale) in front of the south front and formal gardens, and was set into the chimneypiece in the White Closet shortly after the building was completed.
*Escritoire of kingwood oysterwork: this elegant oak scriptor (c. 1672–75) is veneered with South American kingwood using the oystering technique and features silver mounts. Made for the Duchess of Lauderdale, it is listed in the 1679 inventory of Ham House and is believed to have been made in London by a French or Dutch craftsman. Kingwood was one of the most expensive woods used in furniture making in the 17th century.

===Marble Dining Room===

Since 1675 the walls of the Marble Dining Room have been decorated with leather panels. Today visitors can see two distinct designs. The earlier design of 1675 complemented the original black and white marble floor, for which the room is named, with brightly coloured Flemish leather panels of fruits and flowers such as tulips and roses mixed with birds and butterflies on a white background. These had been embossed and some elements gilded, giving the room a sumptuous look.

In 1756, the 4th Earl removed the marble floor and replaced it with a fine marquetry floor of tropical hardwoods. He also commissioned John Hutton of London to make a new set of leather wall hangings with an embossed diaper rosette surrounded by four leaves. The parts of the design which are now brown would originally have appeared to be gold, made by varnishing silver leaf in yellow. The fashion for leather wall decoration spread from Spain and the Spanish Netherlands in the 17th century and was considered ideal for dining rooms as leather did not become impregnated with the odours of food like the fabric of a tapestry. The Ham House inventory of 1655 indicates the &quot;two parlers facing the river were hung with gilt leather.&quot;

===Withdrawing Room===

After dining in the adjacent Marble Dining Room, guests would retire to this space for entertainment and conversation. It also served as an antechamber to the adjacent bedchamber. Notable in this room is the ebony and tortoiseshell cabinet: this cabinet (c. 1650–1675) on a possibly 19th century stand features red tortoiseshell decoration on a somewhat austere ebonised pine exterior that does not prepare the viewer for the ornate interior. Two doors open to reveal multiple shallow drawers on either side of an architectural exterior, which then opens to a theatrical set framed by golden pillars and mirrors. Known as the Antwerp cabinet, it is embellished with ivory, pietra paesina (a type of naturally patterned limestone) and gilt bronze and brass.

===Duchess&#x27;s Bedchamber===
Originally the Duke&#x27;s bedchamber, it is believed it became the Duchess&#x27;s bedchamber following the installation of the bathroom which is accessed via the door to the left of the bed alcove. The ceiling above the bed in the alcove is painted in the style of Antonio Verrio and shows the partially clothed &quot;Flora Attended by Cupids&quot; floating above the tester of the four poster bed. The monogram initials J, E and L (John, Elizabeth, Lauderdale) are entwined in each corner. Notable paintings include:

* &quot;Elizabeth Murray (1626–1698)&quot; painted by Peter Lely in 1648, the year of her marriage to Lionel Tollemache.
* A set of four overdoor maritime paintings by Willem van de Velde the Younger, signed and dated 1673, including &quot;Calm: An English Frigate at Anchor Firing a Salute&quot;, which remain from the decoration scheme planned for the room&#x27;s use as the Duke&#x27;s bedchamber.

===Back Parlour===
This was the room in which senior male staff would have eaten their meals and spent any free time. Hanging in this room is: &quot;Elizabeth Murray, Countess of Dysart (1626–1698), with her First Husband, Sir Lionel Tollemache (1624–1669), and her Sister, Margaret Murray, Lady Maynard (c. 1638–1682)&quot; painted c. 1648 by Joan Carlile, a friend and neighbour to the Murrays.

==Garden and grounds==

The gardens and pleasure grounds at Ham cover approximately . They follow an axial plan, with avenues originally leading east, west and south from the house. The fourth, northern, side of the estate fronts the River Thames. The listed avenues leading to the house from the A307 are formed by more than 250 trees stretching east from the house to the 19th-century Jacobethan gate house at Petersham, and south across the open expanse of Ham Common where it is flanked by a pair of more modest gatehouses. A third avenue to the west no longer exists, and the view to and from the Thames completes the principal approaches to the house. The gardens and grounds are listed Grade II* on Historic England&#x27;s Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. From the initial survey drawings produced by Robert Smythson and son in 1609, it is clear that the garden design was considered as important as that of the house and that the two were intended to be in harmony. The original design shows the house set within a range of walled gardens, each with different formal designs as well as an orchard and vegetable garden. Uncertainty remains as to how much of the original design was actually realised; nevertheless, the plans illustrate the influence of the French formal garden of the time, with its emphasis on visual effects and perspectives.

The 1671 plans for the renovation undertaken by the Duke and Duchess of Lauderdale, which have been attributed to John Slezer and Jan Wyck, demonstrate the continued importance of the garden design, with many features that exist today such as the Orangery, the Cherry Garden, the Wilderness and eight grass squares (plats) on the south side of the house. Both the private apartments for the Duke and Duchess and the State Apartments added to the south front of the house were designed to overlook the formal gardens, an innovation that was highly commended by contemporaries. John Evelyn remarked favourably on the garden design observed during his August 1678 visit, noting &quot;...the Parterres, Flower Gardens, Orangeries, Growves, Avenues, Courts, Statues, Perspectives, Fountaines, Aviaries…&quot;. The Duchess also commissioned a set of iron gates for the north entrance to the property, which remain in place today.

The 3rd and 4th Earls of Dysart who subsequently inherited the estate maintained the formal garden features into the 18th century, while also planting avenues of trees in the wider vicinity. After inheriting the estate in 1799, the 6th Earl opened the north front of the property to the river and installed the Coade stone statue of the River God at the front of the house. He also created the ha-ha which runs along the north entrance of the property. Louisa Tollemache, 7th Countess of Dysart, inherited the estate upon her brother&#x27;s death and was acquainted with the artist John Constable, who completed a sketch of Ham House from the south gardens during a visit in 1835.
By 1972, the gardens had become greatly overgrown – large bay trees at the front blocked the view of the busts in their niches, the south lawn had reverted to a single large expanse of grass and the Wilderness was overgrown with rhododendrons and sycamore trees. Work to restore the 17th century design to the eastern and southern parts of the garden began in 1975. In 1974, an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum entitled &quot;The Destruction of the Country House&quot; had included a model of Ham House with its gardens shown according to the 1672 plans created by Ms. Lucy (Henderson) Askew. This model illustrated the details of the 17th-century design in terms of both layout and plant selection and was used to garner support for the restoration project. By 1977, the grass plats and the structure of the Wilderness to the south of the house were re-established. The 1675 painting by Hendrick Danckerts showing the Duke and Duchess in the south gardens was used to guide the restoration of the furniture and statues now in place.

In approaching the restoration of the &quot;cherry garden&quot; on the east side of the house, there was less documentary evidence available to guide the design. A set of diagonally-set parterres outlined by box hedges and cones were planted with lavender, with the whole garden being enclosed by tunnel arbours and double yew hedges. Later archaeological studies completed in the 1980s indicated no evidence of formal gardens in this area prior to the 20th century; despite this finding, the National Trust&#x27;s Gardens Panel decided not to remove the garden, but rather allow it to remain so long as visitors to the property were clearly informed of its origins. The focus of garden restoration since 2000 has been the walled kitchen garden to the west of the house, to restore its use as a supply of fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers. The produce is used in the Orangery cafe, while the flowers are used to decorate the house. The garden itself is also used as an exhibition space, with information about tulip varieties and the range of edible flowers.

==Later owners==
===Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Earl of Dysart (1698–1727)===
Elizabeth and Lionel Tollemache&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Lionel, became 3rd Earl of Dysart on his mother&#x27;s death in 1698, inheriting Ham House, the adjoining estates and the manors of Ham and Petersham. Already the owner of his father&#x27;s estates in Suffolk and Northamptonshire, he had also acquired in Cheshire through his marriage in 1680 to Grace, daughter of Sir Thomas Wilbraham, 3rd Baronet. He only spent short periods at Ham, and apparently did little for the upkeep of the house though he kept the garden well. He did use his wealth to pay off the interest on the outstanding mortgages but was not considered generous, even with his immediate family. His only son, Lionel, predeceased him in 1712 and on his death he was succeeded as Earl of Dysart by his grandson, also named Lionel.

===Lionel, 4th Earl (1727–70)===

Lionel Tollemache was only 18 years old when he became the 4th Earl of Dysart and head of the family in 1727. Shortly after returning from the Grand Tour in 1729 he married Grace Carteret, the 16-year-old daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, and began repairing existing furniture as well as commissioning new pieces for his properties at Ham and at Helmingham Hall] in Suffolk. Ham House had been largely neglected since the death of Elizabeth; in 1730 he ordered a structural survey of the building from John James which revealed serious problems, especially on the north front. Repairs began in the 1740s. At the front of the house the &quot;Advance&quot;, a projecting frontispiece which extended two storeys to form a porch over the main entrance, had become detached from the wall and was in danger of pulling down the roof. It was removed completely and the stone reused for repairs to the first and second floors. The canted bays on the projections at each end of the house were rebuilt as deeper three-window bays, with corresponding alterations made to the bays on the south front. Major repairs were also made to the roof, where old unfashionable red tiles on the outer pitches were replaced with slate and reused for repairs to the inner pitches where they would not be visible.

Much new furniture was commissioned, but the 4th Earl seems to have also been committed to preserving existing artefacts, making repairs to fixtures from the Lauderdale period where necessary. He made three large changes to the interior of the house: the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber on the first floor became the principal drawing room with furniture and tapestries supplied by the London upholsterer and textile producer William Bradshaw; the Volury on the ground floor became another drawing room with the addition of tapestries and its distinctive X-framed seat furniture; and in the Dining Room the marble floor was replaced with marquetry, with matching gilded leather panels on the walls. By means of his extensive investment, the house would have become sumptuously furnished by the mid-18th century.

Of the sixteen children of the 4th Earl and Countess, only seven lived to maturity. Three of their five sons died in the pursuit of their naval careers. The Countess died in 1755 aged 42, and the Earl in 1770 aged 61. He was survived by his sons Lionel, Lord Huntingtower, and Wilbraham, as well as three daughters: Jane, Louisa and Frances.

===Lionel, 5th Earl (1770–99)===
Lionel Tollemache, 5th Earl of Dysart succeeded to the title in 1770 on his father&#x27;s death. Despite spending on the house, the 4th Earl had kept his son short of money during his lifetime, causing friction in the relationship; he married without his father&#x27;s consent. His wife, Charlotte, was the youngest illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole, second son of Robert Walpole, and niece of Horace Walpole who lived near to Ham across the Thames at Strawberry Hill. The 5th Earl seems to have been a reclusive and introverted individual who shunned publicity, preferring to remain on his estates and refusing to allow changes or renovations to Ham House. His aversion to visitors was so marked as to lead him to refuse a request to visit from George III; &quot;whenever my house becomes a public spectacle, His Majesty shall certainly have the first view&quot;. In contrast to his conserving instincts at Ham, he demolished two properties in Northamptonshire and Cheshire, although retaining the productive, and lucrative, estates. He continued the family tradition of acquiring fine furniture, most notably a marquetry commode which can be seen in the Queen&#x27;s Bedchamber, and the sunburst chairs in the White Closet.

Charlotte died, childless, in 1789 and although Lionel remarried he remained without an heir. The families of his surviving sisters, Louisa and Jane, reverted to the family name of Tollemache in anticipation of eventual succession. On his death in 1799 his brother, Wilbraham became the 6th Earl of Dysart.

===Wilbraham, 6th Earl (1799–1821)===

Wilbraham was aged 60 when he inherited the title in 1799. One of his first acts was to buy the rights of the Manor of Kingston/Canbury from George Hardinge, extending the Dysarts&#x27; property south into Kingston. He had the wall which isolated the property and separated Ham House from the river demolished and replaced by a ha-ha, leaving the gates free-standing. Coade stone pineapples were added to decorate the balustrades to the north of the property and John Bacon&#x27;s statue of the river god which is placed in front of the north entrance, pictured here, also in Coade stone, dates from this period. Several busts of Roman emperors which had adorned the now-demolished walls since the 17th century were relocated to niches in the front of the house. Further restoration of the old furniture took place as well as the addition of Jacobean reproductions. The 6th Earl became a patron of John Constable at this time. Wilbraham&#x27;s wife died in 1804 and, devastated, he moved away, close to the estate in Cheshire. Wilbraham died without heir in 1821, aged 82.

===Louisa, 7th Countess (1821–40)===

Of the 4th Earl&#x27;s children, only the eldest daughter, Lady Louisa, by then widow of John Manners MP, was still surviving when her brother Wilbraham, the 6th Earl, died. Already heiress to Manners&#x27; at Buckminster Park, Louisa inherited the title and estates at Ham in 1821 at the age of 76. The remaining Tollemache estates were bequeathed to the heirs of Lady Jane. Louisa continued the patronage of John Constable who was a frequent and welcome visitor to Ham. Increasingly infirm and blind in old age, Louisa lived to the age of 95, dying in 1840.

===Lionel, 8th Earl (1840–1878)===
Louisa&#x27;s eldest son, William, had predeceased her in 1833. Her grandson, Lionel William John Tollemache, inherited the title and became the 8th Earl of Dysart in 1840. Lionel preferred to live in London and invited his brothers, Frederick and Algernon Gray Tollemache, to manage the estates and Ham and Buckminster. Lionel became increasingly reclusive and eccentric. Lionel&#x27;s only son, William, a controversial figure who amassed great debts guaranteed by the expectation of inheriting the family fortune also predeceased his father, who subsequently bequeathed the estates to his grandson William John Manners Tollemache, with the 8th Earl&#x27;s brothers Frederick and Algernon along with Charles Hanbury-Tracy acting as trustees until 1899. Following the 8th Earl&#x27;s death, his son&#x27;s creditors brought an action in the High Court against the Tollemache family who ultimately had to pay a sum of £70,000 to avoid forfeiting much of the Ham estate.

===William, 9th Earl (1878–1935)===
The 9th Earl inherited in 1878. In his autobiography, Augustus Hare recounts a visit to Ham House the following year, contrasting the dilapidation and disrepair of the house and estate with the treasures the house still contained. Shortly afterwards, the 9th Earl, with agreement from the trustees, undertook extensive renovation of the house and its contents and by 1885 it was again in a suitable state to host social activities, notably a garden party to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887. In 1890 Ada Sudeley, a niece of the 8th Earl, published her 570-page book &quot;Ham House, Belonging to the Earl of Dysart&quot;.

On 23 September 1899, full control of the Tollemache estates at Ham and Buckminster was transferred from trustees to the 9th Earl, then aged about 40, in accordance with his grandfather&#x27;s will. By the early 1900s the Dysarts had installed electricity and central heating at the house along with other modern gadgets including, in the Duchess&#x27;s basement bathroom, a bath with jets and even a wave machine. The 9th Earl travelled widely, rode despite blindness, invested successfully in the stock market, and while eccentric and difficult, nonetheless was hospitable and supportive of the local community. His cantankerous nature proved too much for his wife who left him in the early 1900s but he lived on with other family members at Ham for many years. In the 1920s and 1930s he employed a staff of up to 20 including a chauffeur for his four cars including a Lanchester and Rolls-Royce. When he died in 1935 he left investments worth £4,800,000 but had no direct heir. He was the last Earl of Dysart to live at the house.

===Sir Lyonel Tollemache, Bt. (1935–52)===
On the 9th Earl&#x27;s death in 1935, his inheritance passed to the families of his sisters. His niece, Wynefrede, daughter of his sister Agnes, inherited the earldom. Wynefrede&#x27;s cousin, Lyonel, at the age of 81, inherited the baronetcy and the estates at Ham and Buckminster. He and his middle-aged son, Cecil Lyonel Newcomen Tollemache, lived at the house, but the lack of available staff during the Second World War added to the difficulty of maintaining it. The nearby Hawker Siddeley aircraft factory was a target for bombing raids, and the house and grounds suffered some minor damage. Much of the house&#x27;s contents were removed to the countryside for safety. Most of the family papers were deposited in Chancery Lane but, while they survived the Blitz, they suffered significant water damage from fire hoses. Thought for some time to have been lost, an additional set of papers was subsequently recovered from the Ham House stables in 1953, though many were in poor condition from inadequate storage conditions.

===National Trust (1948–present)===
In 1943, Sir Lyonel invited the National Trust&#x27;s first Historic Buildings Secretary, James Lees-Milne, to visit the house. Lees-Milne saw the neglected state of the house and grounds but, even though devoid of its contents, the historical importance of the underlying estate was immediately apparent. He recorded his impressions in his diary for 1947, extracts from which were later reproduced in the volume &quot;Some Country Houses and their Owners&quot;: &quot;The grounds are indescribably overgrown and unkempt. All the rooms are dirty and dusty. The garden and front doors look as they had not been used for decades.&quot; Despite the neglect, a report commissioned by Lees-Milne in 1946 concluded that it was &quot;by far the finest, most valuable and most representative building of the period to which it belongs in the United Kingdom&quot;. Following lengthy negotiations, Sir Lyonel and his son donated the house and its grounds to the Trust in 1948. The stables and other outlying buildings were sold privately and much of the remaining estate was auctioned in 1949.

The National Trust at first transferred ownership of Ham House to the state on a long lease to the Ministry of Works. The contents of the house were purchased by the government who entrusted them to the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&amp;A) after considerable urging by the director of the museum, Sir Leigh Ashton. His efforts were essential because the National Land Fund, which had been established in 1946 through the sale of surplus war materials, allowed for the purchase of property but not art or other interior furnishings. The legislation was amended in 1953, following the agreement that properties such as Ham House ought to retain their historic collections.

By 1950, the house was open to the public and a series of research and restoration works since undertaken, restoring and reproducing much of the house&#x27;s former grandeur. The arrival of Peter Thornton as the Keeper of the Furniture Department at the V&amp;A led to a new approach in the management of the collection; efforts focused on arranging pieces within the house according to the documented history of the property, rather than treating individual items as simply part of the museum inventory. Research on historic interiors emerged as a discipline from the late 1960s, with an important source made available through the publication of the Ham House bills and inventories in 1980.

The government relinquished its lease in 1990, and the compensation was used to form a fund to support maintenance. The collections were fully transferred from the V&amp;A to the National Trust in 2002. Since that time, the National Trust has invested in recreating the period interiors of the house by rehanging the collection and placing furniture according to inventory records as well as commissioning replica textiles based on archival descriptions. To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the property, a symposium was held to stimulate interest in new research; this led to the publication of a major historical survey overseen by Christopher Rowell in 2013. The Trust continues to acquire items at auction with a historical connection to the house, such as paintings which were formerly in the collection. Restoration is an additional area of major investment, such as that completed for the Queen&#x27;s Antechamber wallhangings in 2010. In its 2018/2019 Annual Report, the Trust reported that Ham received 127,195 visitors.

These routes terminate near Kingston station. There is a free council car park north-west of the house, next to the Thames. Hammerton&#x27;s Ferry, to the north-east, links to a playground between Orleans House Gallery and Marble Hill House below Twickenham&#x27;s central embankment. The house is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists via the Thames Path national trail.

<text>Barnard is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon. It is attached to the southeast rim of the large crater Humboldt, and Abel lies directly to the south. To the northeast is the crater Curie, while to the southeast is the Mare Australe.

The formation has been reshaped and distorted by nearby impacts. The interior is irregular, with an intrusion into the southwest rim and rugged formations particularly in the southern half. A matched pair of small craterlets lies near the center of the interior floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Barnard.

<text>Geber is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged south-central highlands of the Moon. It lies halfway between the crater Almanon to the north-northeast and the crater pair of Azophi and Abenezra to the south-southwest. Farther to the southeast is Sacrobosco. Geber is 45 kilometers in diameter and 3,510 meters deep.

The rim of Geber is symmetrical and nearly circular, with only minor indentations at the north and south faces of its high, terraced wall. The floor is flat and lacks a significant central peak at the midpoint. The small satellite crater Geber B is attached to the northwest rim. 
Geber is from the Nectarian period.

In 1935, the crater was officially named after Jabir ibn Aflah (Latinized as Geber), a Spanish-Arab astronomer active in the first half of the twelfth century.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Geber.

<doc id="1070779" wikidata="Q319201" url="?curid=1070779" title="Malcolm Glazer">
<text>Malcolm Irving Glazer (August 15, 1928 – May 28, 2014) was an American businessman and sports team owner. He was the president and chief executive officer of First Allied Corporation, a holding company for his varied business interests, and owned both Manchester United of the Premier League and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League.

==Early life==
Glazer was born in Rochester, New York, the fifth of seven children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants, Abraham and Hannah Glazer. He began working in his father&#x27;s watch parts business at age 8. At 15, when his father died, he sold watches door to door to help support his family. Reuters quoted Glazer as saying his father&#x27;s death &quot;was probably the most tragic thing that ever happened in my life, but it was good in one way&quot; because &quot;it made me a man.&quot; He briefly attended Sampson College in Romulus, New York before committing himself full-time to jewelry and watch repair. A small man with a reddish beard, he was referred to in the news media as &quot;the leprechaun&quot;.

==Business history==
Glazer obtained the watch repair concession at the Sampson Air Force Base. When the base closed in 1956, he expanded into real estate investing in single-family homes, duplexes and commercial buildings in Rochester, eventually owning commercial real estate across America. In 1963, he bought the National Bank of Savannah in upstate New York. In 1973, he bought the first of five health care facilities he was to own, the West Hill Convalescent Center in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1976, he purchased three television stations for $20 million including WRBL in Columbus, Georgia. In 1984, he founded First Allied Corporation, a holding company for his various endeavors where he served as president and chief executive officer. First Allied invested in a diverse portfolio of international holdings and public companies including: Zapata Corporation, Houlihan&#x27;s Restaurant group, Harley-Davidson, Formica, Tonka Toys, Specialty Equipment and Omega Protein.

Glazer first gained national business attention in 1984, when he launched an unsuccessful $7.6 billion bid to buy the government-controlled freight rail company, Conrail. He was later the largest shareholder of kitchen designer Formica in 1988 and, later, with motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson. Glazer achieved control of Zapata Corporation, an oil and gas company founded by George H. W. Bush. Glazer successfully diversified it into fish protein and Caribbean supermarkets.

Glazer owned a diverse portfolio of investments, which included food service equipment, food packaging and food supplies, marine protein, broadcasting, health care, property, banking, natural gas and oil, the Internet, stocks and bonds.

==Sports ownership==

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Glazer purchased the Tampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League (NFL) franchise on January 16, 1995, following the death of former owner Hugh Culverhouse. He paid $192 million, a league record at that time. Glazer served as president of the team, while sons Bryan, Joel and Edward were co-chairmen at the time.

Since coming under the Glazer family&#x27;s ownership, the club has experienced an upswing in its fortunes, winning 131 regular season games, earning seven playoff berths and winning Super Bowl XXXVII and Super Bowl LV, the latter following Glazer&#x27;s death. Prior to Glazer&#x27;s acquisition of the franchise, the Buccaneers had won just 87 games in 19 seasons and advanced to the postseason just three times.

Tampa Bay also eclipsed the club record for wins in a regular season with 12 in 2002. Tampa Bay was the only team in the league to play in the postseason each year from 1999 to 2002. The 2007 campaign saw the Buccaneers claim their third NFC South Division title in six years, the sixth division crown in franchise history.

After the team finished 9–7 in 2008, the team fired Jon Gruden, the most successful coach in franchise history. The team did not make the playoffs again until the 2020 season under the leadership of Bruce Arians as coach and Tom Brady as quarterback.

In January 2009, Glazer and his family hired Raheem Morris as head coach of the Buccaneers, making him the youngest head coach in the National Football League upon his appointment. In addition, the family named longtime Director of Pro Personnel Mark Dominik as the fourth general manager in club history. Morris went 17–31 as a head coach and was fired after three seasons. The fact that the Bucs lost their final 10 games of the 2011 season was a likely contributor to the decision.

On January 27, 2012, Glazer and his family hired long-time Rutgers University head coach Greg Schiano as the ninth head coach in franchise history. Schiano only lasted two seasons, being fired following a disappointing 4–12 season in 2013. Mark Dominik was also fired at that time, lasting five seasons. During his tenure the team compiled a record of 28–52, which included only one winning season.

Glazer devoted a significant amount of time working to make the organization more fan-friendly by greatly increasing fan activities at Buccaneers home games through the expansion of the club&#x27;s community relations and special events departments. His mandate to enhance the team&#x27;s visibility in the community was reflected through increased appearances by Buccaneer players, coaches, cheerleaders and front office officials in recent years. Since 1999, the team has also coordinated with the Glazer Family Foundation to host &quot;Gameday for Kids&quot;, a program that has hosted over 13,000 underprivileged youth at Buccaneers home games, giving them an opportunity to spend pregame moments on the playing field and to cheer on the Buccaneers from exclusive seats in Raymond James Stadium.

===Manchester United===

Manchester United is one of the most popular and profitable football clubs in the world. Glazer acquired ownership of United in a £790m takeover by gradually buying out United shareholders between 2003 and 2005. Glazer&#x27;s takeover was protested by a large portion of United&#x27;s fans due to concerns about the use of the club&#x27;s financial reserves and the taking on of large amounts of debt. When Glazer suffered a stroke in April 2006, his sons Joel and Avram took over the day-to-day running of the club, and his family continued to control the club following his death in 2014. Their 90% stake in the club was split equally among Glazer&#x27;s six children.

==Philanthropy==
In addition to his business ventures, Glazer was also involved in philanthropic efforts. He launched the Glazer Family Foundation in 1999, which is dedicated to assisting charitable and educational causes in the Tampa Bay community. During its existence, the foundation has donated millions in programs, tickets, grants and in-kind contributions. The foundation donated $5 million toward the construction of the Glazer Children&#x27;s Museum in downtown Tampa, which opened on September 25, 2010.

Glazer also oversaw the operations of the far-reaching Glazer Family Foundation&#x27;s Vision Program, created in 2006 to provide school children with an opportunity to have vision problems identified in schools at an early age. The initiative, highlighted by the Vision Mobile, visits schools and provides eye examinations to thousands of disadvantaged children.

Glazer&#x27;s charitable activities also included the Tampa Bay Sports Commission, an organization that promotes amateur sports activities. Glazer committed $2 million to the commission.

==Personal life==
Glazer married his wife, Linda, in 1961. They lived in Palm Beach, Florida, and they attended Palm Beach Synagogue regularly. They had five sons, Avram Glazer, Kevin Glazer, Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Edward Glazer, and one daughter, Darcie S. Glazer Kassewitz.

Glazer, who had been in poor health since suffering two strokes in April 2006, died at age 85 on May 28, 2014.

At the time of his death, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be US$4 billion.

<text>This list of people executed in New York gives the names of some of the people executed in New York, both before and after statehood in the United States (including as New Amsterdam), as well as the person&#x27;s date of execution, method of execution, and the name of the Governor of New York at the date of execution. 1963 marked the last execution in New York State. Some executions recorded during the 17th and 18th centuries do not indicate the name(s) of the executed and therefore are not included.

Regarding electrocutions, which comprise a large percentage of the executions: 
* 55 people (54 men and 1 woman) were electrocuted at Auburn Correctional Facility 
* 26 men were electrocuted at Clinton Correctional Facility
* 614 people (including 8 women) were electrocuted at Sing Sing

== 1600–1799 ==
== 1800–1899 ==
== 1900–1963 ==
As a result of several United States Supreme Court decisions, capital punishment was suspended in the United States from 1972 through 1976.

Since 24 June 2004, the New York State death penalty statute has been declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals.

<doc id="1070806" wikidata="Q698516" url="?curid=1070806" title="Attersee (lake)">
<text>Attersee, also known as Kammersee, English sometimes Lake Atter, is the largest lake of the Salzkammergut region in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. It is Austria&#x27;s third largest lake by area, surpassed only by Lake Constance and Lake Neusiedl, which, however, both of those larger lakes extend beyond national borders.

==Geography==
The surface area of Lake Attersee extends for about from north to south and from east to west. With an average depth of , its water volume even surpasses the Chiemsee, which is larger by area.

The main inflow is the Seeache creek, which flows out of the nearby Mondsee lake in the southwest. Both Attersee and Mondsee are part of a chain of lakes, beginning with Fuschlsee and Irrsee. The waters flow off with the Ager River down to the Traun which itself discharges into the Danube at Linz.

In the southwest of the lake the Schafberg (&quot;Sheep Mountain&quot;), part of the Salzkammergut Mountains, rises up to , separating it from the Mondsee lake, whose southern shore borders the state of Salzburg. The &quot;Höllengebirge&quot; (literally &quot;hell mountains&quot;) karst range, with a height of up to , is located southeast of the lake.

Due to its steady winds and clean water quality, Attersee is famous for attracting sailors and swimmers alike. During the season numerous sailing competitions are held. One of the most cherished winds on Attersee is the so-called &quot;Rosenwind&quot; meaning &quot;breeze of roses&quot;. It is an easterly wind that crosses a castle&#x27;s rose garden and fills the air across the lake with the smell of roses. The surrounding settlements largely depend on tourism, mainly in spring, summer and autumn.

Because of the lake&#x27;s size and despite the cold temperatures during winter the lake rarely freezes. The last time the lake was entirely covered with ice was in the late 1940s, when people were seen skating and riding motorcycles across the thickly frozen surface of the lake.

== History ==

The name &quot;Atter&quot;, derived from &quot;ata&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;, probably is of proto-Celtic origin. The shores were already settled in the Neolithic era. In August 1870, remains of prehistoric pile dwellings were found near Seewalchen at the northern end of the lake. The Mondsee group stilt houses since 2011 are part of the UNESCO Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps World Heritage Site. Other archaeological findings denote settlement activities in Roman times from the 2nd century BC onwards.

In the middle of the 19th century paddlesteamers were introduced on the lake to ferry mail and goods between the villages located around the Attersee. Today it is an important recreation site for people from the urban areas of Vienna and Linz.

From the &quot;Fin de siècle&quot;, Attersee became a popular destination for summer guests, apart from the bustle at the emperor&#x27;s sojourn in nearby Bad Ischl. Near the village of Litzlberg, part of Seewalchen, there is a small island castle, which Gustav Klimt frequently visited during the summer. Likewise, the German painter Albert Weisgerber was a summer visitor on Attersee.

Lake Attersee was a rallying point for several German divisions during World War II which had retreated during the Siege of Budapest. Among these were several foreign volunteer divisions of the Waffen-SS, which sought to reach Attersee where surrender to the Americans was preferable to capture by the Red Army.

The lake is celebrated in the Viennese painter Gustav Klimt&#x27;s work Insel im Attersee.

==Fishing==
Among the fish species found in the lake are:
* Northern pike
* Brown trout
* Rainbow trout
* Arctic char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;)
* Lake char (&quot;Salvelinus umbla&quot;)
* European eel
* Carp
* Burbot
* Perch
* Whitefish

<text>Ultimate Kylie is the second major greatest hits album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and her first greatest hits released under her contract with Parlophone, her record company between 1999–2015. The compilation was released in many different formats including a two-disc edition and a deluxe double disc with a bonus DVD. A separate compilation DVD with the same name, was released to accompany the audio versions. The album includes two new tracks; its lead single, &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, and the second single, &quot;Giving You Up&quot;. A third track, &quot;Made of Glass&quot;, was recorded for the album but not used; it was included on the physical releases of &quot;Giving You Up&quot;.

&quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; was commended by contemporary critics who noted the musical and credible progression from the start of her career; some critics criticised the earlier material. The album reached the top ten in the United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland, Greece, and Germany, while it charted in several other territories including Spain, Sweden, and New Zealand. The album was certified platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for one million shipments throughout Europe. &quot;I Believe in You&quot; debuted inside the top ten in several countries worldwide, while &quot;Giving You Up&quot; charted moderately in some regions. The compilation was promoted through the in 2005. After Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer, she cancelled the tour and was resumed with in 2006.

This compilation was superseded by 2019&#x27;s &quot;Step Back in Time: The Definitive Collection&quot; with only &quot;Giving You Up&quot; not being included on the expanded, 3-CD version of the latter.

==Background==
&quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; is Minogue&#x27;s ninth greatest hits album, and her first compilation through Parlophone. The release follows her eight previous greatest hits albums, &quot;The Kylie Collection&quot; (1988), &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1992), &quot;Hits+&quot; (2000), &quot;Confide in Me&quot; (2001), &quot;Greatest Hits 87–97&quot; and its re-release (2002 and 03), &quot;Greatest Hits: 87–99&quot; (2003), and &quot;Artist Collection&quot; (2004). &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Hits+&quot; are her only compilations released through her signed labels; &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released through her 1987–1992 record label, PWL, and &quot;Hits+&quot; was released through her 1993–1998 record label, Deconstruction Records. &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; is her first greatest hits album under her contract with Parlophone; her final greatest hits release through the contract was &quot;The Albums 2000–2010&quot; (2011). On Minogue&#x27;s website, she shared her thoughts on the release:

Since my first hit, I can’t believe how quickly time has passed. This collection is very dear to me and holds a lifetime of memories. There is nothing like time to give you a sense of perspective and I hope the listener gets as much enjoyment out of these tracks as I do. I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to experiment throughout the years and that my fans have embraced the need in me to try new approaches. I am just as excited about the new tracks featured here as I am about all the others on the record. At this point in my career, I am happy to celebrate the past and look forward to the future.
On 22 November 2004, &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; was released as a standard two-disc set. Three versions were issued; the standard two-disc set, and a digital release through Amazon.com and iTunes Store; as of May 2011, the digital release has been removed from digital stores. The third format was a triple-disc package, with the original two-discs and a bonus DVD, including music video content; this was released in Australia through HMV stores in 2006. A DVD with the same name was simultaneously released which included several music videos of Minogue that have never appeared on a DVD before. It includes the completed video of the single &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, but no video of &quot;Giving You Up&quot; was produced at the album and DVD&#x27;s release. The DVD contains all the music videos with of the songs with on-screen lyrics (with the exception of &quot;Giving You Up&quot;, which had not been filmed at the time of release). It also contains Minogue&#x27;s performance at the 2002 BRIT Awards of &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Blue Monday Out of My Head&quot; – a mix of her song &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; and New Order&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot;. Early versions of the UK DVD were known to suffer from disc rot after a short period of time, where the playing surface becomes cloudy or forms a &#x27;cracked&#x27; pattern. The record label offered free replacements to those who returned their damaged copies. &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot; is also featured in edited form with the first chorus removed. &quot;Giving You Up&quot; had not been filmed yet and is represented in the instrumental intro on the menu page.

On 28 October 2006, upon resuming her Showgirl tour, the compilation was re-issued as the &quot;Showgirl Homecoming Special Edition&quot; and included the two-disc compilation plus the corresponding DVD in a three-disc set.

==Critical response==
&quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; received a generally positive response from music critics. &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave it a positive review, saying: &quot;&quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot;, which seems condensed even at its double-disc length, is one of the best collections of dance music available, even while including her &#x27;80s pop hits. It is enough to get her MP3s permanently out of my &quot;guilty pleasures&quot; bin&quot; and gave the album an 8 out of 10 rating, which means that the album was of excellent status and &quot;among the best work of the given artist, or among the best in the given genre&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it a very positive review, awarding it four and a half out of five stars. At first he said &quot;There certainly hasn&#x27;t been a shortage of Kylie Minogue hits compilations&quot;, but finished the album with a positive review and ending saying &quot;it nevertheless gives all the hits, both big and small, in one place, which means that this not only makes this ideal for fans for all levels of dedication, it means that Ultimate Kylie lives up to its billing.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; staff noted that &quot;this is a &quot;greatest hits&quot; truly deserving of the name, and offers more hits than you can shake a stick at&quot;.

Jason Shawahn from About.com gave it a positive review, awarding it four stars out of five. He praised the album for its inclusion of two new songs, which he feels were &quot;among the finest tracks that Kylie has recorded in years&quot; and show her at her best. He later finished saying &quot;but as far as providing the comprehensive Kylie, the folks at EMI have done a pretty good job.&quot; In a review for &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;, Mark Edwards called the first disc &quot;horribly naff&quot; and full of &quot;squeaky songs&quot;. The review also mentioned &quot;every year or two she’ll release another pop gem, sell a squillion more calendars and finally retire as a multi-millionairess with a greatest hits compilation in every household. Because everyone loves Kylie, even if half of this album is terrible.&quot; Jaime Gill from Yahoo! Music gave it a positive review, saying &quot;But why not accept it as merely the brand for a shiny double CD of brilliant pop tunes? If she disappeared tomorrow few would really care, but if songs like this did we really, really would.&quot; In 2007, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included the album in their &quot;1000 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; list. In 2006, &quot;I Believe in You&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Dance Recording category at the 48th Grammy Awards.

==Chart performance==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; debuted at number four, staying in for thirty-one weeks. The album was certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments of 900,000 units. The album entered at number five on the Australian Albums Chart, and stayed in the top fifty for forty-two weeks, Minogue&#x27;s longest charting greatest hits album. &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; was certified quadruple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), selling over 280,000 copies in the country. In New Zealand, the album entered at thirty-nine on the New Zealand Albums Chart, and reached thirty-three.

&quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; had other success in other countries as well. The album managed to peak at number fourteen and thirty-five in Belgium (Flanders) and Belgium (Wallonia), being certificated Platinum there. The album debuted at number forty-nine in Spain, and it eventually peaked at number thirty-four after fifteen weeks in the charts. The album was certificated Gold in the country, selling over 50,000 copies. The album also peaked at number eight on the Irish Albums Chart, and was certificated Platinum by the Irish Recording Music Association (IRMA).

==Promotion==

In order to promote &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; and the single, Minogue performed &quot;I Believe in You&quot; in shows such as &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, Nordic Music Awards, &quot;Top of the Pops Saturday&quot;, Premios Ondas, &quot;Star Academy&quot;, &quot;Hit Machine&quot;, &quot;Today with Des and Mel&quot;, and &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. On 24 October 2004, it was announced that Minogue also would go on tour to promote the compilation. It commenced on 19 March 2005 and ended on 7 May 2005, visiting 14 cities in 11 European countries, totalling 37 concerts. The show was split into six acts and an encore: &quot;Showgirl&quot;; &quot;Smiley Kylie&quot;; &quot;Denial&quot;; &quot;What Kylie Wants, Kylie Gets&quot;; &quot;Dreams&quot;; &quot;Kyliesque&quot; and &quot;Minx in Space&quot;. After performing in Europe, she travelled to Melbourne, where she was diagnosed with breast cancer and was forced to cancel the tour; she intended to extend the tour to Asia and Australia. Two recordings from the tour were released; the first was a video album titled &quot;Kylie Showgirl&quot;, and released in November 2005, whilst the second one was released in December as an extended play with eight tracks from the tour, titled &quot;Showgirl&quot;.

In November 2005, her tour promoter announced the tour&#x27;s restart for the end of the following year, with an update from the original version &quot;as a thank you for the patience and understanding of Australian ticket holders&quot;. She resumed the tour, entitled , in November 2006 with a performance in Sydney. Her dance routines had been reworked to accommodate her medical condition, and slower costume changes and longer breaks were introduced between sections of the show to conserve her strength. The media reported that Minogue performed energetically, with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; describing the show as an &quot;extravaganza&quot; and &quot;nothing less than a triumph&quot;. The tour was released as a live album, titled &quot;&quot;, in January 2007. The Greatest Hits Tour grossed more than US$19.97 million from 23 shows in the United Kingdom alone, and the Homecoming Tour grossed $40.11 million($ million in dollars).

It also peaked within the top ten in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Italy and Ireland, also becoming her best entry on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance Club Songs chart, after &quot;Slow&quot;.

<doc id="1070820" wikidata="Q1106331" url="?curid=1070820" title="Sir Andrew Noble, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Andrew Noble, 1st Baronet (13 September 1831 – 22 October 1915) was a Scottish physicist noted for his work on ballistics and gunnery.

==Early life==
Born at Greenock, he was educated at Edinburgh Academy and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned in the Royal Artillery in 1849, promoted captain in 1855 and became secretary of the Royal Artillery Institution. He was secretary of the British government select committee on the replacement of smooth-bore cannon with rifled artillery and carried out research on the subject. In 1859 he became Assistant-Inspector of Artillery and in 1860 a member of the Ordnance Select Committee and of the Committee on Explosives, remaining on the committee until it was dissolved in 1880.

==Notable work==
In 1860 he joined Armstrong&#x27;s armaments works in Elswick, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, first as joint manager and, from 1861, as a partner, where he continued research into artillery, in particular inventing ways of measuring breech pressures. In 1862 he invented the Electro-Mechanical Chronoscope to measure small time intervals between triggers inserted into a gun to determine the acceleration of projectiles as they travelled down the barrel, allowing him to assess the performance of different powders.

He worked with Sir Frederick Abel on improving the properties of black powder, making it burn more slowly to produce more gas and a more consistent pressure, with the result that he was able to increase muzzle velocities from 1600 to 2100 feet per second, while the energy developed increased by about 75%. Noble&#x27;s work also assisted Abel&#x27;s further development of a new smokeless powder, cordite, in 1889. These developments required the re-design of both the guns and their mountings, manufactured by Armstrongs, which gave them a competitive advantage, ultimately helping the company expand into shipbuilding, locomotives, tanks and aircraft to become one of the world&#x27;s largest armament firms by 1914. With Sir William Armstrong&#x27;s effective retirement from active control in about 1890, Noble&#x27;s primary role changed from scientist to businessman, formally becoming chairman in 1900, and he oversaw much of this growth of the company. Noble claimed that all the Japanese guns which sank the Russian fleet at the crucial battle of Tsushima in 1905, had been manufactured at Elswick.

In 1870, at the age of 38 he was recognised for his scientific work and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was awarded the Society&#x27;s Gold Medal in 1880. He was made a Companion of the order of the Bath in 1881 and knighted in 1893. He served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1896. It was announced that he would receive a baronetcy in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902 for the (subsequently postponed) coronation of King Edward VII, and on 24 July 1902 he was created a Baronet, of Ardmore and Ardardan Noble, in the parish of Cardross, in the county of Dumbarton.

==Personal life==

In 1854, while stationed with his regiment in Quebec, Noble married Margery Durham Campbell. They had four sons and two daughters. Margery lived to the age of 101.

Noble&#x27;s first and second sons George and Saxton became successively second and third baronets, while his third son John Noble, also involved with Armstrongs, was created a baronet in his own right in 1923. The latter&#x27;s youngest son Michael Noble became a prominent Conservative politician and was created a life peer as Baron Glenkinglas in 1974.

Noble&#x27;s youngest daughter Ethel married Alfred Cochrane cricketer and poet who was Company Secretary at Armstrongs. His granddaughter Cynthia Noble married the diplomat Gladwyn Jebb.

==Architectural patronage==
Noble and his sons used their wealth to commission a number of important houses from some of the foremost architects of the day.

In 1871, he bought Jesmond Dene House, which was originally designed by John Dobson, and commissioned Norman Shaw and later local architect Frank West Rich to double the size of the house adding a west wing, billiard room, Gothic porch, Great Hall and a range of bedrooms. In 1894 he also built a real tennis court in the grounds of the house, one of only around 50 currently in use worldwide. Jesmond Dene House is now an hotel and restaurant.

In 1905, Noble bought the Ardkinglas estate on Loch Fyne in Argyllshire, commissioning Sir Robert Lorimer to build a large new house, Lorimer&#x27;s masterpiece, and later to restore Dunderave Castle on the other side of the loch.

In 1910 his eldest son George commissioned Randall Wells to rebuild Besford Court, Worcestershire in a Tudor gothic style, the architect&#x27;s masterpiece and the last great gothic English country house.

In 1911 his second son Saxton commissioned Reginald Blomfield to build Wretham Hall, Norfolk in a William and Mary style. Following the near-collapse of Armstrongs in 1927 Wretham was demolished, and Saxton commissioned designs for a topiary garden representing the plan of a huge house for the site from Sir Edwin Lutyens.

In 1920 his youngest son Philip again commissioned Sir Robert Lorimer to alter Glendoe, Inverness-shire.
