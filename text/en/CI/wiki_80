<text>The line-crossing ceremony is an initiation rite in some English-speaking countries that commemorates a person&#x27;s first crossing of the equator. The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing headlands, and become a &quot;folly&quot; sanctioned as a boost to morale, or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long, rough voyages. Equator-crossing ceremonies, typically featuring King Neptune, are common in the navy and are also sometimes carried out for passengers&#x27; entertainment on civilian ocean liners and cruise ships. They are also performed in the merchant navy and aboard sail training ships.

Throughout history, line-crossing ceremonies have sometimes become dangerous hazing rituals. Most modern navies have instituted regulations that prohibit physical attacks on sailors undergoing the line-crossing ceremony.
== Traditions ==
=== Australia ===
In 1995, a notorious line-crossing ceremony took place on the Royal Australian Navy submarine . Sailors undergoing the ceremony were physically and verbally abused before being subjected to an act called &quot;sump on the rump&quot;, where a dark liquid was daubed over each sailor&#x27;s anus and genitalia. One sailor was then sexually assaulted with a long stick before all sailors undergoing the ceremony were forced to jump overboard and tread water until permitted to climb back aboard the submarine. A videotape of the ceremony was obtained by the Nine Network and aired on Australian television. The coverage provoked widespread criticism, especially when the videotape showed some of the submarine&#x27;s officers watching the entire proceedings from the conning tower.

=== Canada ===
In the Royal Canadian Navy, those who have not yet crossed the equator are nicknamed &quot;tadpoles&quot; or &quot;dirty tadpoles;&quot; an earlier nickname was &quot;griffins.&quot;

=== France ===
The French author François-Timoléon de Choisy crossed the equator in April 1685 (aboard the &quot;Oiseau&quot; bound for Siam), and had the following to say about their tradition: 
&quot;...we had the ceremony this morning. All the sailors who had already crossed it were armed with tongs, pincers, cooking pots and cauldrons... This company, after having done their drill, lined up beside a bucket or tub full of water, in which according to the ancient rite everyone who had not yet crossed the Line had to be dipped. His Excellency the Ambassador appeared before the court first, and promised, with his hand on a map of the world, to observe the ceremony, if ever he recrossed the Line, and in order not to be doused he put in the basin a fistful of silver. I did the same, as did all the officers, and those who had the wherewithal to buy their way out. The rest were plunged into the tub, and drenched in twenty buckets of water. Nearly sixty crowns were collected, which will be spent on buying refreshments for the crew&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===

By the eighteenth century, there were well-established line-crossing rituals in the British Royal Navy. On the voyage of HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; to the Pacific in 1768, captained by James Cook, Joseph Banks described how the crew drew up a list of everyone on board, including cats and dogs, and interrogated them as to whether they had crossed the equator. If they had not, they must choose to give up their allowance of wine for four days, or undergo a ducking ceremony in which they were ducked three times into the ocean. According to Banks, some of those ducked were &quot;grinning and exulting in their hardiness&quot;, but others &quot;were almost suffocated&quot;.

Captain Robert FitzRoy of suggested the practice had developed from earlier ceremonies in Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian vessels passing notable headlands. He thought it was beneficial to morale. FitzRoy quoted Otto von Kotzebue&#x27;s 1830 description in his 1839 &quot;Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of His Majesty&#x27;s Ships&quot; Adventure &quot;and&quot; Beagle &quot;between the Years 1826 and 1836&quot;.

A similar ceremony took place during the second survey voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;. As they approached the equator on the evening of 16 February 1832, a pseudo-Neptune hailed the ship. Those credulous enough to run forward to see Neptune &quot;were received with the watery honours which it is customary to bestow&quot;. The officer on watch reported a boat ahead, and Captain FitzRoy ordered &quot;hands up, shorten sail&quot;. Using a speaking trumpet he questioned Neptune, who would visit them the next morning. About 9 am the next day, the novices or &quot;griffins&quot; were assembled in the darkness and heat of the lower deck, then one at a time were blindfolded and led up on deck by &quot;four of Neptunes constables&quot;, as &quot;buckets of water were thundered all around&quot;. The first &quot;griffin&quot; was Charles Darwin, who noted in his diary how he &quot;was then placed on a plank, which could be easily tilted up into a large bath of water. — They then lathered my face &amp; mouth with pitch and paint, &amp; scraped some of it off with a piece of roughened iron hoop. —a signal being given I was tilted head over heels into the water, where two men received me &amp; ducked me. —at last, glad enough, I escaped. — most of the others were treated much worse, dirty mixtures being put in their mouths &amp; rubbed on their faces. — The whole ship was a shower bath: &amp; water was flying about in every direction: of course not one person, even the Captain, got clear of being wet through.&quot; The ship&#x27;s artist, Augustus Earle, made a sketch of the scene.

=== United States ===
The U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard and United States Marines have well-established line-crossing rituals. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed &quot;Shellbacks&quot;, &quot;Trusty Shellbacks&quot;, &quot;Honorable Shellbacks&quot;, or &quot;Sons of Neptune&quot;. Those who have not crossed are nicknamed &quot;Pollywogs&quot;, or &quot;Slimy Pollywogs,&quot; or sometimes simply &quot;Slimy Wogs.&quot;

==== History ====
In the 18th century and earlier, the line-crossing ceremony was quite a brutal event, often involving beating pollywogs with boards and wet ropes and sometimes throwing the victims over the side of the ship, dragging the pollywog through the surf from the stern. In more than one instance, sailors were reported to have been killed while participating in a line-crossing ceremony.

Baptism on the line, also called equatorial baptism, is an alternative initiation ritual sometimes performed as a ship crosses the Equator, involving water baptism of passengers or crew who have never crossed the Equator before. The ceremony is sometimes explained as being an initiation into the court of King Neptune.

The ritual is the subject of a painting by Matthew Benedict named &quot;The Mariner&#x27;s Baptism&quot; and of a 1961 book by Henning Henningsen named &quot;Crossing the Equator: Sailor&#x27;s Baptism and Other Initiation Rites&quot;.

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described his crossing-the-line ceremony aboard the &quot;Happy Ship&quot; with his &quot;Jolly Companions&quot; in a letter to his wife Eleanor Roosevelt on 26 November 1936. Later, during World War II, the frequency of the ceremony increased dramatically, especially in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, where the service&#x27;s fleet operations grew enormously to counter widely dispersed Japanese forces. As late as World War II, the line-crossing ceremony was still rather rough and involved activities such as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Tongue&quot;, which was an electrified piece of metal poked into the sides of those deemed pollywogs. Beatings were often still common, usually with wet firehoses, and several World War II Navy deck logs speak of sailors visiting sick bay after crossing the line.

Efforts to curtail the line-crossing ceremony did not begin until the 1980s, when several reports of blatant hazing began to circulate regarding the line-crossing ceremony, and at least one death was attributed to abuse while crossing the line.



==== Today ====
The two-day event (evening and day) is a ritual in which previously inducted crew members (Trusty Shellbacks) are organized into a &quot;Court of Neptune&quot; and induct the Slimy Pollywogs into &quot;the mysteries of the Deep&quot;. Physical hardship, in keeping with the spirit of the initiation, is tolerated, and each Pollywog is expected to endure a standard initiation rite in order to become a Shellback. Depending on the Ocean or Fleet AOR, there can be variations in the rite. Some rites have discussed a role reversal as follows, but this is not always a normal feature, and may be dependent on whether a small number of Shellbacks exist to conduct the initiation.

The transition flows from established order to the &quot;controlled chaos&quot; of the Pollywog Revolt, the beginnings of re-order in the initiation rite as the fewer but experienced enlisted crew converts the Wogs through physical tests, then back to, and thereby affirming, the pre-established order of officers and enlisted.

The eve of the equatorial crossing is called Wog Day and, as with many other night-before rituals, is a mild type of reversal of the day to come. Wogs (all of the uninitiated) are allowed to capture and interrogate any Shellbacks they can find (e.g., tying them up, cracking eggs or pouring aftershave lotion on their heads). The Wogs are made very aware that it will be much harder on them if they do anything like this.
After crossing the line, Pollywogs receive subpoenas to appear before &quot;King Neptune and his court&quot; (usually including his first assistant Davy Jones and her Highness Amphitrite and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest-ranking sailors who are Shellbacks), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of men dressing up as women, each department of the ship being required to introduce one contestant in swimsuit drag. Afterwards, some may be &quot;interrogated&quot; by King Neptune and his entourage, and the use of &quot;truth serum&quot; (hot sauce + after shave) and whole uncooked eggs put in the mouth. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees on nonskid-coated decks; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; being locked in stocks &amp; pillories and pelted with mushy fruit; being locked in a water coffin of salt-water and bright green sea dye [fluorescent sodium salt]; crawling through chutes or large tubs of rotting garbage; kissing the Royal Baby&#x27;s belly coated with axle grease, hair chopping, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks.

Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate declaring his new status. Another rare status is the &quot;Golden Shellback&quot;, a person who has crossed the Equator at the 180th meridian. The rarest Shellback status is that of the &quot;Emerald Shellback&quot; (US), or &quot;Royal Diamond Shellback&quot; (Commonwealth), which is received after crossing the Equator at the prime meridian, near the Null Island weather buoy. When a ship must cross the Equator reasonably close to one of these meridians, the ship&#x27;s captain might plot a course across the &quot;Golden X&quot; so that the ship&#x27;s crew can be initiated as Golden or Emerald/Royal Diamond Shellbacks. 

In the PBS documentary &quot;Carrier,&quot; filmed in 2005 (Episode 7, &quot;Rites of Passage&quot;), a crossing-the-line ceremony on is extensively documented. The ceremony is carefully orchestrated by the ship&#x27;s officers, with some sailors reporting the events to be lackluster due to the removal of the rites of initiation.

Reflecting the popularity of tattoos among sailors, some people choose to get tattoos to mark that they have participated in a ceremony, such as an image of a shellback turtle or King Neptune.

==== Honors for line crossings and other navigational events ====
As Shellback initiation is conducted by each individual ship as a morale exercise and not officially recognized by the Navy with inclusion on discharge papers (DD Form 214) or through a formally organized institution, variations of the names as well as the protocol involved in induction vary from ship to ship and service to service.

Unique Shellback designations have been given to special circumstances which include:

*The Star Spangled Shellbacks being given to the crew of crossing the equator on July 4, 1966. Most recently the crew of earned it on July 4, 2023, making the 2nd documented US vessel to do so. It is not known if this designation has ever been used before or since, as no other mention of such honor has been located to date.
*The Iron Shellback for the crew who served on , USS Vella Gulf (CG-72), USS Paul Hamilton (DDG-60) and , who crossed the equator during a 200+ consecutive day underway with no ports during their 2020 deployment.

Variations to the Shellback designation include: 

*The &quot;Order of the Ebony Shellback&quot; for maritime personnel who have crossed the Equator on Lake Victoria.
*The Emerald Shellback or Royal Diamond Shellback for maritime personnel who cross the Equator at the prime meridian.
*The Golden Shellback for maritime personnel who have crossed the point where the Equator crosses the 180th meridian.
*The Top Secret Shellback for submariners who have crossed the equator at a classified degree of longitude.
*The Wooden Shellback for maritime personnel who have crossed the equator on a vessel with a wooden hull.

Consequently, similar &quot;fraternities&quot; commemorating other significant milestones in one&#x27;s career include:
*The &quot;Order of the Blue Nose&quot; (Domain of the Polar Bear) for maritime personnel who have crossed the Arctic Circle.
*The Caterpillar Club for aviators who have made an unscheduled parachute jump from a disabled plane.
*The Century Club for aviators who have completed their 100th carrier landing.
*The &quot;Realm of the Czars&quot; for maritime personnel who crossed into the Black Sea.
*The &quot;Order of the Ditch&quot; for maritime personnel who have passed through the Panama Canal.

*The &quot;Order of Purple Porpoises&quot; for maritime personnel who crossed the junction of the Equator and the International Date Line at the Sacred Hour of the Vernal Equinox.
*The &quot;Order of the Red Nose&quot; (Domain of the Penguin) for maritime personnel who have crossed the Antarctic Circle.
*The &quot;Order of the Rock&quot; for maritime personnel who have transited the Strait of Gibraltar.
*The Safari to Suez or The Order of Mariners of the Desert for maritime personnel who have transited the Suez Canal.
*The &quot;Order of the Sand Squid&quot; (or Sand Sailor) for maritime personnel who have been attached to land-based Army or Marine units stationed in the Middle East.
*The &quot;Order of the Spanish Main&quot; for maritime personnel who have sailed in the Caribbean.
*The &quot;Order of the Sparrow&quot; for maritime personnel who sailed on all seven seas.
*The &quot;Order of the Square Rigger&quot; for maritime personnel who have served aboard or .

==== California Maritime Academy ====
California Maritime Academy observed the line-crossing ceremony until 1989, after which the ceremony was deemed to be hazing and was forbidden. The 1989 crossing was fairly typical, as it was not realized to be the last one. Pollywogs participated voluntarily, though female midshipmen observed that they were under social pressure to do the ceremony but were targets of harder abuse. Pollywogs (midshipmen and anyone else who had not crossed) ascended a ladder from the forecastle to the superstructure deck of the ship. There, they crawled down a gauntlet of Shellbacks on both sides of a long, heavy canvas runner, about 10–12 meters. The shellbacks had prepared 3-foot lengths of canvas/rubber firehose, which they swung hard at the posterior of each Wog. The Wogs then ascended a ladder to the boat deck to slide down a makeshift chute into the baptism of messdeck leavings in sea water in an inflated liferaft back on the superstructure deck. Wogs then returned to the forecastle, where they were hosed off by firehose and then allowed to kiss, in turn, the belly of the sea-baby, the foot of the sea-hag, and the ring of King Neptune, each personified by Shellbacks.

==== Others ====
SUNY Maritime occasionally holds a Blue Nose ceremony for its cadets after crossing the Arctic Circle. Their most recent ceremony was during the summer of 2019, on the TSES VI, held shortly after departing Reykjavik. Cadets crawled through a tunnel with lo mein, or &quot;Eel Spawn&quot;, and then had food put in their hair before crawling through the fantail while being sprayed by fire hoses.

Colorado State University&#x27;s Semester at Sea Program holds a line-crossing ceremony twice a year for its students when their vessel, Blue Dream Star, crosses the equator.

<text>Esoteric is an English funeral doom metal band from Birmingham, founded in 1992. Releasing seven studio albums, and a demo, the band is widely regarded as among the first groups to develop the funeral doom style. The band has named a variety of groups as influences, such as metal bands Morbid Angel and My Dying Bride, more &quot;trippy&quot; artists such as Pink Floyd, Spacemen 3, and King Crimson, and the industrial and dark ambient genres.

== History ==
Esoteric was formed in 1992, and in 1993, released &quot;Esoteric Emotions – The Death of Ignorance&quot; – a demo tape containing 82 minutes of material with a total of eight tracks. Shortly thereafter they received an offer from Aesthetic Death to record a full-length CD of new material.

In June 1994, Esoteric entered Rich Bitch studios in Birmingham to record six tracks to be released as a double CD, titled &quot;Epistemological Despondency&quot;. Soon after the recording of this album, Stuart Blenkinsop (guitar) and Darren (drums) left the band, leaving Greg Chandler (vocals), Bryan Beck (bass), Simon Phillips and Gordon Bicknell (guitars). In September of that year, Steve Peters joined Esoteric to complete the guitar section. However, a suitable drummer was yet to be found.

Having only played a handful of gigs in the UK, Esoteric travelled to Germany to play a series of shows. Halfway through the tour, they were forced to turn back after an injury to Steve&#x27;s leg made it impossible to continue. In June 1995, the band was back on the road with a small tour of the UK. This tour was also cut short after only two shows when their equipment was destroyed by fire. Once the equipment was replaced, Esoteric began to prepare for the recording of their second release on Aesthetic Death Records.

In 1996, Esoteric entered the studio once more to record &quot;The Pernicious Enigma&quot; – their second double-CD, consisting of 9 tracks. Towards the end of 1997, one day before they were due to depart for a short tour of Germany, Simon (guitar) left the band without warning. Greg (vocals) was able to fill in at short notice. This has since become a permanent arrangement.

Progress was becoming slow without a full line-up and with increasing work commitments, and the three tracks that were in development over a period of two years were recorded in order to make way for new material; without a permanent drummer, Esoteric was forced to use session drum-work, provided courtesy of Keith York. Eibon Records (Italy) offered to release these tracks which were recorded, engineered and produced without the aid of professional mixing and/or mastering technicians, and in 1999, &quot;Metamorphogenesis&quot;, was released.

In May 2002, just one week before Esoteric were due to start recording their fourth album, Bryan (bass) left the band leaving the three remaining members to record the album. This was done in intervals over a period of time spanning across the rest of the year and into 2003, using session work (as with their previous album) involving Keith York on drums and Trevor Lines on bass. After negotiation with various labels, Esoteric signed with the French label Season of Mist. The album titled &quot;Subconscious Dissolution into the Continuum&quot; was released on 28 June 2004.

Esoteric completed their line-up in mid-2003, including Andy Semmens (drums) and Mark Bodossian (bass). In addition, Olivier Goyet joined the band to perform on the keyboards which allowed them to better orchestrate their material in a live environment, where the use of an extra instrument has become necessary to emulate the complexity of the studio recordings. Following this was a number of shows and tours throughout Europe in 2004 and 2005.

In 2005, Semmens left the band, Steve Peters left in 2007, and Olivier Goyet in mid-2009. Kris Clayton (founder of Camel of Doom) joined as session live guitarist in 2007. This arrangement remained in place until 2009 when Ilia Rodriguez took over live duties. Jim Nolan, a permanent third guitarist was found at the end of 2009. Joe Fletcher joined on drums at the beginning of 2007. The 5th album titled &quot;The Maniacal Vale&quot; and recorded at Priory Recording Studios was released to critical acclaim in June 2008. Since then Esoteric have performed live throughout Europe. Founding member and guitarist Gordon Bicknell briefly left in early 2011 for unknown reasons, contributing guitars and keyboards to only one track (&quot;Non-Being&quot;) on the band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Paragon of Dissonance&quot; which was released on 11 November 2011 in Europe and 15 November 2011 for the rest of the world. He has since rejoined.

<doc id="1071647" wikidata="Q644485" url="?curid=1071647" title="Something Wild (1986 film)">
<text>Something Wild is a 1986 American comedy thriller film directed by Jonathan Demme, written by E. Max Frye, and starring Melanie Griffith, Jeff Daniels and Ray Liotta. It was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. The film has some elements of a road movie combined with screwball comedy.

==Plot==
Charlie Driggs is a conventional yuppie investment banker who works in New York City. After he leaves a greasy spoon diner without paying, a wildly dressed woman with a brunette bob who calls herself Lulu confronts him. Lulu offers Charlie a ride downtown but instead heads for New Jersey and throws his beeper from the moving car. Lulu openly drinks liquor while driving and stops in a town to buy more. While Charlie phones his office, Lulu — unbeknownst to him — robs a liquor store.

Charlie claims the cash he is carrying is for his Christmas club account, but Lulu persuades him to pay for a room at a roadside motel. Once inside she handcuffs him to the bed. She phones his boss and puts the receiver to his head while they are having sex, forcing him into an awkward conversation. Later Charlie pretends to phone his wife but Lulu is unaware that his marriage ended nine months ago.

After sharing a meal with Lulu at an Italian restaurant, Charlie realizes he is unable to pay with what little cash he has left. Lulu leaves him with the check, forcing him to flee the restaurant to escape an angry chef who demands payment. After spending the night at a motel, Lulu and Charlie awaken to find a police officer and tow truck near the car she drove down an embankment and into a signpost the night before. Lulu abandons the car and buys one from a sleazy used car dealer, leaving Charlie wondering where she got the money. He starts to enjoy Lulu&#x27;s free-wheeling lifestyle and realizes he is falling in love with her.

Lulu confesses that her real name is Audrey and introduces Charlie as her husband to her mother, Peaches, at her Pennsylvania home. She appears as a demure blonde, having removed her brunette wig. She takes Charlie to her high school reunion, where a former classmate recognizes him as his office colleague. Audrey&#x27;s violent ex-convict husband, Ray Sinclair, also appears and makes clear that he wants her back. After ditching his date, Ray takes Audrey and Charlie along while he robs a convenience store. He pistol-whips a clerk and breaks Charlie&#x27;s nose. They drive to a cheap motel, where Ray forces Charlie to admit his wife left him (having learned this from Charlie&#x27;s colleague at the class reunion). Realizing Charlie has deceived her, Audrey stays behind with Ray.

Despite Ray warning him to stay away from him and Audrey, Charlie secretly tails the couple as they leave the motel. Charlie confronts Ray in a Virginia restaurant with several police officers seated nearby and threatens to reveal Ray&#x27;s parole violations unless he allows Audrey to leave with him. He demands that Ray hand over his wallet and car keys and leaves the check with Ray to force him to stay behind as they flee. Ray is saved from this dilemma by a shop girl he had met earlier.

Charlie takes Audrey to his Stony Brook, Long Island, home, but their idyllic suburban retreat is literally shattered when Ray hurls a patio chair through their sliding glass door. He severely beats Charlie and handcuffs him to the pipes under the bathroom sink before attacking Audrey. Charlie frees himself by pulling the pipes apart and strangles Ray with the handcuffs. During the scuffle, Charlie retrieves Ray&#x27;s dropped knife. Ray dies when he accidentally impales himself on the knife Charlie is holding. Audrey is taken away for questioning when the police arrive.

Charlie later quits his job and looks for Audrey at her apartment, but finds she has moved. Outside the diner where Charlie met Audrey, a waitress accuses him of leaving without paying. Audrey suddenly appears with the cash he left on the table in her hand. Stylishly dressed and with elegant makeup, she smiles and invites Charlie into her woodie station wagon and back into her life.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Something Wild&quot; was acclaimed by critics. The film holds a 92% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Boasting loads of quirky charm, a pair of likable leads, and confident direction from Jonathan Demme, &quot;Something Wild&quot; navigates its unpredictable tonal twists with room to spare.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert rated the film 3-stars-out-of-4 and stated &quot;&quot;Something Wild&quot; is quite a movie. Demme is a master of finding the bizarre in the ordinary. The accomplishment of Demme and the writer, E. Max Frye, is to think their characters through before the very first scene. They know all about Charlie and Lulu, and so what happens after the meeting outside that restaurant is almost inevitable, given who they are and how they look at each other. This is one of those rare movies where the plot seems surprised at what the characters do.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Dave Kehr gave the film a perfect four star review, stating &quot;It&#x27;s not every day that someone goes Alfred Hitchcock one better, but in &quot;Something Wild,&quot; Jonathan Demme has done it.&quot;

Pauline Kael, writing for &quot;the New Yorker&quot;, stated: &quot;&quot;Something Wild&quot; is rough-edged. It doesn’t have the grace of Demme&#x27;s &quot;Citizens Band&quot; and &quot;Melvin and Howard&quot; or the heightened simplicity of his &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;. It has something else, though -- a freedom that takes off from the genre framework.&quot; A more mixed review from Vincent Canby of &quot;the New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;The performances are, without exception, good. The film&#x27;s principal difficulty is E. Max Frye&#x27;s original screenplay, which is better thought out in terms of its narrative than of the characters.&quot;

In his seminal work &quot;Postmodernism&quot;, American theorist Fredric Jameson uses the film&#x27;s premises, along with others&#x27; such as that of Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;The Trial&quot;, for his observations on the possibilities for rebellion in modern or postmodern capitalist society.

===Accolades===
==Home media==
&quot;Something Wild&quot; was released on VHS by HBO Video on July 15, 1987. The film was released on DVD by MGM on June 5, 2001, presented in its original 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio. The only special feature was the original theatrical trailer.

On May 10, 2011, &quot;Something Wild&quot; was released by The Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray.

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on LP and CD, featuring only 10 of the 49 tracks in the title credits.

<doc id="1071650" wikidata="Q3267719" url="?curid=1071650" title="Too Many People">
<text>&quot;Too Many People&quot; is a song by Paul McCartney and his wife Linda McCartney, from the 1971 album &quot;Ram&quot;. The song was issued as the B-side of the &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; single, and was also included on &quot;The 7&quot; Singles Box&quot; in 2022.

==Background==
&quot;Too Many People&quot; contains lyrical digs at McCartney&#x27;s former bandmate and songwriting partner John Lennon, as well as his wife Yoko Ono. According to &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Michael Gallucci, it is &quot;McCartney&#x27;s bitchiest kissoff to his ex-bandmates.&quot; McCartney recalled in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1984:

The song begins with the line &quot;piece of cake&quot;, which was later revealed to be a veiled comment at Lennon:

The line &quot;You took your lucky break and broke it in two&quot; was originally &quot;Yoko took your lucky break and broke it in two&quot;, though McCartney revised it before recording the song. Despite this, Gallucci interprets the line as a &quot;dig at Lennon&#x27;s relationship with Yoko Ono.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; remarked that &quot;Too Many People&quot;&#x27;s &quot;incredibly sweet melody is proof that McCartney could use his charm as a weapon when he wanted to.&quot;

The introduction to the song, as well as the bridge, alternate the tonic chord of G major with its minor subdominant chord of C minor. This allows McCartney to go from the bridge to a repetition of the introduction music as a means of moving the music back to the verses. According to Vincent Perez Benitez, this strategy &quot;enhance[s] the coherence of the song,&quot; in a manner consistent with McCartney&#x27;s earlier song &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed.&quot; &quot;Too Many People&quot; incorporates guitar solos in both the middle and at the end of the song.

McCartney also recorded an instrumental version of &quot;Too Many People&quot; that was released on his &quot;Thrillington&quot; album. In this version a stereo phaser was used to produce a sound that music journalist Ian Peel describes as coming from a &quot;psychedelic echo chamber.&quot;

==Recording==
&quot;Too Many People&quot; was initially recorded on 10 November 1970 in Columbia Studios in New York City. Most of the overdubbing, including adding brass instruments to the beginning of the song, occurred in January 1971. Additional overdubbing took place in March and April 1971.

==Aftermath==
Following the release of &quot;Ram&quot;, John Lennon pointed out several songs that he claimed were attacks at him, among them being &quot;Too Many People&quot;.

In response, Lennon wrote &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; for his album &quot;Imagine&quot;, an attack at McCartney, which featured musical contributions from George Harrison. McCartney later wrote &quot;Dear Friend&quot;, a truce offering to Lennon, and released it on the album &quot;Wild Life&quot; with his band, Wings.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated &quot;Too Many People&quot; to be McCartney&#x27;s 3rd greatest post-Beatles song, 2 slots ahead of its A-side &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot; and behind only &quot;Band on the Run&quot; and &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Too Many People&quot; as &quot;wailing sentimentality.&quot; &quot;Capital Journal&quot; critic Steve Gettinger called &quot;Too Many People&quot; a high point of &quot;Ram&quot; stating that it is &quot;bright and bitter, carefully constructed&quot; and &quot;unmistakably Beatles.&quot; &quot;Boston Globe&quot; critic Ernie Santosuosso described it as &quot;a loud meditation about society&quot; with a &quot;particularly violent guitar statement,&quot; praising the music more than the lyrics.

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn described &quot;Too Many People&quot; as &quot;a sort of musical extension of Thomas Malthus that includes some of the humorous irony of the vintage Beatles,&quot; with lines such as &quot;Too many reaching for a piece of cake&quot; and &quot;Too many hungry people losing weight.&quot; Hilburn goes on to state that the song provides a lyrical surprise, which he likens to an O. Henry story, in which the lyrics turn to &quot;a statement about the resolution of ones problems in a difficult self-centered world.&quot; Hilburn suggests that this may be a reference to McCartney&#x27;s experience with the Beatles&#x27; breakup.

According to &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Nick DeRiso, the song&#x27;s &quot;haughty sermonizing&quot; towards Lennon is one of the weaknesses of the &quot;Ram&quot; album, though fellow &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Gallucci rated the song as the 4th best Beatles&#x27; post-breakup fight song and &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Brian Wawzenek rated it as the 4th best song inspired by Yoko One.

Of the instrumental version on &quot;Thrillington&quot;, Peel states that &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is transformed into funky jazz with more than a hint of studio experimentation.&quot;

<doc id="1071653" wikidata="Q5533546" url="?curid=1071653" title="Genre studies">
<text>Genre studies is an academic subject which studies genre theory as a branch of general critical theory in several different fields, including art, literature, linguistics, rhetoric and composition studies.

Literary genre studies is a structuralist approach to the study of genre and genre theory in literary theory, film theory, and other cultural theories. The study of a genre in this way examines the structural elements that combine in the telling of a story and finds patterns in collections of stories. When these elements (or semiotic codes) begin to carry inherent information, a genre emerges.

Linguistic genre studies can be roughly divided into two schools, Systemic Functional Linguistics or &quot;SFL&quot;, and English for Specific Purposes or &quot;ESP.&quot; SFL scholars believe that language structure is an integral part of a text&#x27;s social context and function. SFL scholars often conduct research that focuses on genres&#x27; usefulness in pedagogy. ESP also examines the pedagogical implications of genre, focusing in particular on genre analysis as a means to help non-native English speakers to use the language and its conventions. ESP genre analysis involves identifying discourse elements such as register, formation of conceptual and genre structures, modes of thought and action that exist in a specific discourse community.

A third approach developed from scholarship in New Rhetorics, principally Carolyn R. Miller&#x27;s article &quot;Genre as Social Action&quot; and is called rhetorical genre studies (RGS). RGS has found wide application in composition studies, whose scholars insist that the textual forms that are usually called &quot;genres&quot; are only traces of recurring social action. The social action itself, in other words, is the genre, not the document or text that it leaves behind.

==Literary and linguistic branches==

===Systemic functional linguistics===
Systemic functional linguistics scholars believe that language is organized within cultures based on cultural ideologies. The &quot;systemic&quot; of SFL refers to the system as a whole, in which linguistic choices are made. SFL is based largely on the work of Michael Halliday, who believed that individuals make linguistic choices based on the ideologies of the systems that those individuals inhabit. For Halliday, there is a &quot;network of meanings&quot; within a culture, that constitutes the &quot;social semiotic&quot; of that culture. This &quot;social semiotic&quot; is encoded and maintained by the discourse system of the culture. For Halliday, contexts in which texts are produced recur, in what he calls &quot;situation types.&quot; People raised within a specific culture become accustomed to the &quot;situation types&quot; that occur within that culture, and are more easily able to maneuver through the &quot;situation types&quot; within that culture than people who were not brought up within it.

Halliday&#x27;s approach to cultural context in the formation of recurrent &quot;situation types&quot; influenced other scholars, such as J.R. Martin, to develop a linguistic pedagogy called the &#x27;Sydney School&#x27;. Martin led the SFL pedagogical approach, which emphasized the role of context in text formation. Martin and his associates believed that process-based approaches to education ignored the cultural boundaries of texts, and privileged middle- and upper- class students at the expense of students from lower-class backgrounds. According to Martin and other SFL scholars, an explicit focus on genre in literature would help literacy teaching. Focusing on genre reveals the contexts that influences texts, and teaches those contexts to students, so that they can create texts that are culturally informed.

Through their genre work in schools, Martin and his associates developed a definition of genre as a &quot;staged, goal-oriented, social process.&quot; In the Martinian genre model, genres are staged because they accomplish tasks that require multiple steps; they are goal-oriented because their users are motivated to see the completion of the stages to the end; and they are social because users address their texts to specific audiences.

===English for Specific Purposes===

English for Specific Purposes scholarship has been around since the 1960s, but ESP scholars did not begin using genre as a pedagogical approach until the 1980s, when John Swales published &quot;Genre Analysis: English in Academic and Research Settings&quot;, in which Swales laid out the methodological approach that brought together ESP and genre analysis. Swales identified two characteristics of ESP genre analysis: its focus on academic research in English and its use of genre analysis for applied ends. ESP focuses on specific genres within spheres of activity, such as the medical profession, but it also focuses on the broader concept of communicative purposes within fields of study.

English for Specific Purposes shares some characteristics with SFL studies. Both believe that linguistic features are connected to social context and function, and both aim to help disadvantaged students grasp the system in which texts are created so that they can create similar texts, by teaching them the relationship between language and social function. Both try to accomplish their goals by teaching specific genres to underprivileged users.

However, there are also some important differences between ESP and SFL. Whereas SFL scholars focus on teaching basic genre structures to primary and secondary school students, ESP scholars are focused on teaching Professional and Academic disciplinary genres to University- and graduate-level students. ESP students tend to be more bound to discursive genre subjects, within very particular contexts. ESP focuses on micro-level genres and contexts, whereas SFL focuses on macro-level contexts.

===Rhetorical genre studies===

Rhetorical genre studies or RGS (a term coined by Aviva Freedman) scholars examine genre as typified social action, as ways of acting based in recurrent social situations. This founding principle for RGS was developed in Carolyn R. Miller&#x27;s essay &quot;Genre as Social Action,&quot; which was published in 1984. In her article, Miller draws on Lloyd Bitzer&#x27;s notion of exigence as &quot;an imperfection marked by an urgency&quot;, that is a condition in the world that serves as an &quot;external cause of discourse.&quot; Miller modifies this objective view with Kenneth Burke&#x27;s notion of &quot;motive&quot; as internal source of human action. Drawing on Alfred Schutz&#x27;s phenomenological concept of typification, she views situations and exigences as social constructions. Genres are typified ways of responding to recurring social situations. As a consequence genres are not fixed in number and cannot be organized into a taxonomy; rather they are evolving historical constructions that &quot;change, evolve, and decay.&quot; A rhetorical approach focuses on genres not as forms but as communicative actions.

RGS scholarship has developed beyond Miller&#x27;s founding definition of genre. Charles Bazerman examined the historical evolution of the experimental article in the sciences and social sciences demonstrating how the major features and variations emerged. He analyzed how the changing forms of the genre and the proliferation of its varieties carried out the activities of those sciences, formed the knowledge of various disciplines, and established criteria about how knowledge should be formulated and evaluated. He also found evidence about how genre expectations influenced the social structure and values of sciences. He then examined how practices of intertextuality and citation developed with modern scientific genres to create more collaborative relations within sciences. Carol Berkenkotter and Thomas Huckin begin with the notion that genre is knowledge foundation, and argue that genres embody communities&#x27; knowledge and ways of acting. For Berkenkotter and Huckin, genre becomes a way of navigating social activity. As such, it is dynamic, because the conditions of social activity are always in flux. Recurrence, they claim, involves variation. Berkenkotter and Huckin redefine genre as social cognition.

The notion of &quot;uptake&quot; is also integral to RGS scholars&#x27; understanding of genre. Anne Freadman uses uptake to describe the ways in which genres interact with each other in her articles &quot;Uptake&quot; and &quot;Anyone for Tennis?&quot;. She uses the game of tennis to explain the ways genres, as typified actions, are &quot;taken up&quot; by writers (tennis players). Tennis players, she says, do not exchange tennis balls, they exchange shots. Each shot only has meaning within the game, its rules, and the context of the game being played. Shots are meaningful because they take place in a game. The game is meaningful because it takes place within &quot;ceremonials.&quot; Thus, the final at Wimbledon provides a different context than a game between friends. Genres are the games that take place within ceremonials, and shots are utterances, or verbal exchanges. We cannot really understand a text without understanding the ceremonial in which it occurs. &quot;Uptake&quot; is the illocutionary response elicited by particular situations.

A number of different scholars have proposed terms that highlight the different ways genres may be related to each other. Amy Devitt initially proposed &quot;genre sets&quot; as those genres produced by an individual actor, carrying out that person&#x27;s various roles, as part of the person&#x27;s role set. Bazerman proposed &quot;genre systems&quot; to indicate the systematic unfolding of genres in an activity setting. John Swales proposed a similar term, &quot;genre sequences.&quot; Clay Spinuzzi, with his term &quot;genre ecologies,&quot; emphasized a more open set of genre options in a setting. Vijay Bhatia proposed &quot;genre colonies&quot; to note how genres move from one activity system to another to create new clusters of genres. For instance, if we were to take a courtroom as an activity system, the judge&#x27;s genre set could be defined as only those genres used by the judge, while all the communications produced by all the witnesses, lawyers, and other court officers would be included within the genre system, and the regularized series of utterances from judge to lawyers to witnesses could be identified as a genre sequence. The total range of kinds of utterances in the court would form a genre ecology, and the introduction of technical discourses through, for example, the testimony of expert witnesses could indicate the colonization of genres from one domain to another. Bazerman, in a more complex example, studied the history and workings of the multiple activity systems and their associated genres that Thomas Edison needed to engage with, including journalism, finances and equity markets, patents and the courts, civic regulation, industrial laboratories, commercial marketing, corporate organization and others, in order to develop a system of lighting and centralized power. The technical innovations only became possible by gaining presence, meaning and value within the communications of each of these systems.

Another influence on rhetorical genre studies comes from M.M. Bakhtin&#x27;s analysis of genre, based in literary criticism and non-structural dialogic linguistics. Bakhtin considers genre as responsive to social, situational context, laden with intertextual history and ideology. Bakhtin states, &quot;Utterances and their types, that is, speech genres are the drive belts from the history of society to the history of language.&quot; His work strengthened the developing view of genre both as a semiotic structure and as a recurrent action analogous to the speech act or utterance. Translated into English from the Russian in 1986, Bakhtin&#x27;s &quot;Problem of Speech Genres&quot; began to influence genre studies in the 1990&#x27;s (for examples, in the work of Berkenkotter and Huckin, Devitt, Freedman, Journet, and Schryer.

=== Literary conventions ===
Conventions are usual indicators such as phrases, themes, quotations, or explanations that readers expect to find in a certain genre. They could be considered &quot;stereotypes&quot; of that genre. For example, Science fiction is expected to be set in the future, and have futuristic events, technological advances, and futuristic ideas. Realism is expected to contain a story about people who could pass as real, struggling through real-life situations and/or real world events, etc.

Critic Paul Alpers explains that literary conventions are like meeting places where past and present writers &quot;come together&quot; to determine the form a convention should take in a particular literary instance (work). In practical terms, this coming together is a matter of the present writer consulting the work of predecessors, but Alpers wants to connote the sense of active negotiation and accommodation that takes place between the writer and the genre he or she is working in (a genre defined by other people). According to Alpers, a misconception persists in modern criticism that literary convention is an &quot;arbitrary and inflexible practice, established by widespread usage and imposed from without.&quot; Convention in this sense is the &quot;antithesis of the personal and individual&quot;; it is &quot;felt to constrain the [writer].&quot; Alpers reconceptualizes literary convention as something &quot;constitutive and enabling.&quot; For him, generic conventions are &quot;not fixed procedures imposed by impersonal tradition;&quot; rather, they are the living &quot;usages of other [writers],&quot; &quot;the shared practice of those who come together.&quot; Thinking of generic conventions as a practice shared by many users, allows later writers to exercise the same degree of control over convention as those who predated them. Far from constraining writers, convention provides flexibility to preserve certain aspects of a genre and transform others. Convention in this sense enables &quot;individual expression, because the [writer] is seen as responsive to, even when challenging, his predecessors and fellows.&quot;

Genre theorist David Fishelov also deals with generic conventions—he calls them &quot;generic rules&quot;—in elaborating his explanatory metaphor of &quot;literary genres as social institutions&quot; in the book &quot;Metaphors of Genre: The Role of Analogies in Genre Theory&quot;. Fishelov, like Alpers, sees generic conventions as an inescapably &quot;vital part of the literary communicative situation,&quot; linking present and past writers to each other, as well as to readers. Established conventions are &quot;a challenge, or a horizon, against which the writer and his reader have to define themselves.&quot; The writer may respond to this challenge by &quot;stretch[ing] the generic rules.&quot;

Fishelov draws his metaphor of genre as social institution from a passage in René Welleck and Austin Warren&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Literature&quot;:

:The literary kind [genre] is an &#x27;institution&#x27;—as Church, University, or State is an institution. It exists not as an animal exists or even as a building, chapel, library, or capital, but as an institution exists. One can work through, express oneself through, existing institutions, create new ones, or get on, so far as possible, without sharing in politics or rituals; one can also join, but then reshape institutions.

This formulation ascribes agency to actors within social institutions. In the same way institutions like churches, universities, and states organize social actors to accomplish collective social purposes, literary genres organize relationships between writers and readers to accomplish communicative purposes, which change over time. Genres are not static, but rather, like social institutions, persist through the constant renovation of their conventions by individuals. Fishelov is particularly helpful in theorizing the role of the reader in alternately constraining and motivating generic change:

:[T]he reader demands compliance with the established generic conventions so that he can integrate the new text, but at the same time he expects the writer to manipulate these established conventions so that the new text is more than a tedious repetition of the generic tradition.

Reader expectations operate as both a constraint on the writer and a &quot;latent demand for innovation.&quot; The writer &quot;is expected to manipulate the existing conventions and to carry them (at least) one step further…. From the writer&#x27;s perspective, the generic convention is a model to follow but also a challenge to overcome.&quot; Fishelov explains that writers choose or are compelled to manipulate prevailing conventions for a variety of aesthetic and thematic reasons.

==History of genre theory==
Genre theory or genre studies got underway with the Ancient Greeks, who felt that particular types of people would produce only certain types of poetry. or oratory. Regarding literary theory, the Greeks also believed that certain metrical forms were suited only to certain genres. Aristotle said, 
We have, then, a natural instinct for representation and for tune and rhythm—and starting with these instincts men very gradually developed them until they produced poetry out of their improvisations. Poetry then split into two kinds according to the poet&#x27;s nature. For the more serious poets represented the noble deeds of noble men, while those of a less exalted nature represented the actions of inferior men, at first writing satire just as the others wrote hymns and eulogies. This is all based on Plato&#x27;s mimetic principle. Exalted people will, in imitation of exaltation, write about exalted people doing exalted things, and vice versa with the &quot;lower&quot; types (Farrell, 383). Genre was not a black-and-white issue even for Aristotle, who recognized that though the &quot;Iliad&quot; is an epic it can be considered a tragedy as well, both because of its tone as well as the nobility of its characters. However, most of the Greek critics were less acutely aware—if aware at all—of the inconsistencies in this system. For these critics, there was no room for ambiguity in their literary taxonomy because these categories were thought to have innate qualities that could not be disregarded.

The Romans carried on the Greek tradition of literary criticism. The Roman critics were quite happy to continue on in the assumption that there were essential differences between the types of poetry and drama. There is much evidence in their works that Roman writers themselves saw through these ideas and understood genres and how they function on a more advanced level. However, it was the critics who left their mark on Roman literary criticism, and they were not innovators.

Regarding rhetorical genres, although a general classification of various kinds of oratory predated Aristotle, earlier writers did not provide a conceptual basis for them. Aristotle in his treatise On Rhetoric describes three kinds of rhetoric, based on the kinds of audience; deliberative rhetoric concerning decisions about the future, judicial (or forensic) rhetoric concerning decisions about the past, and ceremonial or epideictic rhetoric concerning decisions about the present. Each genre has a characteristic goal, context, and arguments. This delineation of rhetorical genres persisted into the medieval and early modern educational traditions, being codified in the work of the Roman orator Cicero, the pedagogue Quintilian, in the influential &quot;Rhetorica ad Herrenium&quot;, and elsewhere. Thus genre became a static, essentialized, and formalized notion, entrenched in later appropriations of the classic tradition in both rhetoric and poetics.

After the fall of Rome, when the scholastic system took over literary criticism and rhetoric, genre theory was still based on the essential nature of genres. This is most likely because of Christianity&#x27;s affinity for Platonic concepts. This state of affairs persisted until the 18th century.

===Enlightenment age===
At the end of the 18th century, the theory of genre based on classical thought began to unravel beneath the intellectual chafing of the Enlightenment. The introduction of the printing press brought texts to a larger audience. Then pamphlets and broadsides began to diffuse information even farther, and a greater number of less privileged members of society became literate and began to express their views. Suddenly authors of both &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; culture were now competing for the same audience. This worked to destabilize the classical notions of genre, while still drawing attention to genre because new genres like the novel were being generated (Prince, 455).

Locke, in &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; (1690), had reduced data to its smallest part: the simple idea derived from sense. However, as the science of cognition became more precise it was shown that even this simple idea derived from sense was itself divisible. This new information prompted David Hartley to write in his &quot;Observation on Man&quot; (1749), How far the Number of Orders may go is impossible to say. I see no Contradiction in supposing it infinite, and a great Difficulty in stopping at any particular Size. (Prince, 456). 

The possibility of an infinite number of types alarmed theologians of the time because their assumption was that rigorously applied empiricism would uncover the underlying divine nature of creation, and now it appeared that rigorously applied empiricism would only uncover an ever-growing number of types and subsequent sub-types.

In order to re-establish the divine in categorization, the new taxonomical system of aesthetics arose. This system offered first beauty, and then the sublime as the taxonomical device. The problem with Aesthetics was that it assumed the divine and thus the sublime must underlie all these categories, and thus, the ugly would become beautiful at some point. The paradox is glaring.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
American rhetorical education in the early 19th century was dominated by Hugh Blair&#x27;s belletrism, emphasizing five common forms (letters, treatises, essays, biographies and fiction), and in the later 19th century by what became known as the modes of discourse,&quot; based on eighteenth century faculty psychology and codified as narration, description, exposition, and argument (sometimes called persuasion). These formalized and context-free categories were codified in textbooks and influential in the teaching of writing through the middle of the twentieth century.

in 1925 neo-Aristotelian speech criticism inaugurated by Herbert Wichelns in 1925 revived Aristotelian rhetorical genres and codified them in the teaching of new departments of speech communication. Edwin Black identified the classification of rhetoric into forensic, deliberative, and epideictic genres as first among the &quot;primary and identifying ideas of neo-Aristotelianism.&quot; Black&#x27;s critique of neo-Aristotelianism enabled Karlyn Kohrs Cambell and Kathleen Jamieson&#x27;s turn toward a situation-based, historically-developmental conception of genres.

===Evolution===
Ever since the late 18th century literary critics have been trying to find a theory of genre that would be more commensurate with the realities of individual texts within genres. The evolution of genre took many twists and turns through the 19th and 20th centuries. It was heavily influenced by the deconstructionist thought and the concept of relativity. In 1980, the instability engendered by these two new modes of thought came to a head in a paper written by Jacques Derrida titled, &quot;The Law of Genre.&quot; In the article Derrida first articulates the idea that individual texts participate in rather than belong to certain genres. He does this by demonstrating that the &quot;mark of genre&quot; is not itself a member of a genre or type. Thus, the very characteristic that signifies genre defies classification. However, at the end of this essay, Derrida hints at what might be a more fruitful direction for genre theory. &quot;There, that is the whole of it, it is only what &#x27;I,&#x27; so that say, here kneeling at the edge of literature, can see. In sum, the law. The law summoning: what &#x27;I&#x27; can sight and what &#x27;I&#x27; can say that I sight in this site of a recitation where I/we is.&quot; By which Derrida means that not only is taxonomy a subjective sport, but due to this very fact, &quot;the place and time the taxonomical act takes place&quot; deserves further study.

Then, in 1986, Ralph Cohen published a paper in response to Derrida&#x27;s thoughts titled &quot;History and Genre.&quot; In this article Cohen argued that 
genre concepts in theory and in practice arise, change, and decline for historical reasons. And since each genre is composed of texts that accrue, the grouping is a process, not a determinate category. Genres are open categories. Each member alters the genre by adding, contradicting, or changing constituents, especially those of members most closely related to it. The process by which genres are established always involves the human need for distinction and interrelation. Since the purposes of critics who establish genres vary, it is self-evident that the same texts can belong to different groupings of genres and serve different generic purposes. (Cohen, 204)

====Genre evolution in RGS====

RGS scholars largely agree that while genres are indeed dynamic and constantly evolving entities, they are difficult to change. Amy Devitt describes this bind, as she considers a genre to be &quot;both the product and the process that creates it&quot; (580). To Devitt, genres not only respond to recurrent situations, but they construct them as well. Berkenkotter and Huckin note that &quot;Genres...are always sites of contention between stability and change. They are inherently dynamic, constantly (if gradually) changing over time in response to the sociocognitive needs of individual users.&quot; This phenomenon makes theorizing genre evolution challenging. Carolyn R. Miller has explored the implications for genre change of the language of &quot;evolution&quot; and &quot;emergence.&quot; Many RGS scholars have theorized how genres change. JoAnne Yates and Wanda Orlikowski, who introduced the importance of genre to the organizational studies and information technology fields, embedding it in structuration theory, assert that &quot;one person cannot single-handedly effect the change of an institutionalized structure [like genre]; other relevant participants must adopt and reinforce the attempted change for it to be implemented and sustained in practice&quot; (108). Elsewhere they argue that &quot;the potential for genre modification is inherent in every act of communication,&quot; but that only &quot;significant and persistent modifications of genre rules that are widely adopted result in modified genre.&quot; In other work, they examine how the structuring of genre systems can be strategically used to organize interaction and influence response timing in electronic interchange. Natasha Artemeva has made similar observations based on an eight-year ethnographic survey that followed engineering students from academia and into the workplace environment. Although Artemeva observed that two of her subjects impacted the evolution of workplace genres when a kairotic moment presented itself (164) these former student&#x27;s success in changing the workplace genre also depended on three individually acquired skills: 1) &quot;cultural capital&quot;, 2) &quot;domain content expertise&quot;, and 3) &quot;agency in the rhetor&#x27;s ability&quot; to not only see when a kairotic moment presented itself, but &quot;to also seize the opportunity&quot; (167). Thomas Helscher is not as optimistic; he writes, the &quot;rhetorical constitution of [a] discourse community operates as a counterweight to the process of community growth and change&quot; (30) and argues that the &quot;transformation of the fundamental generic conventions by which communities constitutes themselves...is paradigmatic of the process of social transformation&quot; (32).

==The problem of genre taxonomy==

The definition of genre from dictionary.com is &quot;a class or category of artistic endeavor having a particular form, context, technique, or the like.&quot; Such a definition seems to invite a fixed taxonomy of enduring categories; however, understanding genre attribution as a process recognizes that genre categories are mutable and evolving, and thus are only quasi-stable.

Genres, according to Daniel Chandler, create order to simplify the mass of available information. Creating categories promotes organization instead of chaos. Jane Feuer has divided ways to categorize genres into three different groups. The first is aesthetic. By using this method one can organize according to certain sets of characteristics, and so the overall work of the artist is not disparaged by generalization. The second classification method is ritual. Ritual uses its own culture to help classify. If one performs a ritual associated with a system of ritual, one can be said to be practicing as a member of that system. The common taxonomic method is ideological. This occurs most often in the marketing of texts, music, and movies. The effectiveness of this type of categorization can be measured by how well the public accepts these categories as valid.

Amy J. Devitt focuses on the rhetorical approach to genre. Scholars generally recognize the restrictions placed on works that have been classified as a certain genre. However, viewing genre as a rhetorical device gives the author and the reader more freedom and &quot;allows for choices.&quot; Genres are not free-standing entities, but are actually intimately connected and interactive amongst themselves and the activities carried out by those among whom the genres circulate, leading to pervasive change and hybridity. Rhetorical theory of genre recognizes that genres are generated by authors, readers, publishers, and the entire array of social forces that act upon a work at every stage of its production. Consequently rhetorical genre scholars tend to focus on the processes of genre production and change rather than taxonomies of genre that are mutable and subject to the changing interests and perceptions of users within evolving social circumstances.

This recognition of the mutability and fluidity does not make the taxonomy of texts easy. Chandler points out that very few works have all the characteristics of the genre in which they participate. Also, due to the interrelatedness of genres, none of them is clearly defined at the edges, but rather fade into one another. Genre works to promote organization, but there is no absolute way to classify works, and thus genre is still problematic and its theory still evolving.

Moreover, the metagenre as a concept has been an important point to study. According to Giltrow, metagenre is &quot;situated language about situated language&quot;. Metagenres such as institutional guidelines can be &quot;ruling out certain kinds of expression, endorsing others&quot;, constraining and enabling. The concept of metagenre also provides a valuable way to understand the dynamics of institutional interrelations between genres. In the mental health discourse, for example, has been demonstrated the metageneric function of the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s (DSM) for standardizing and mediating the localized epistemological communicative practices of psychiatrists.

==Functions and limits==

Genre began as an absolute classification system in ancient Greece. Poetry, prose and performance had a specific and calculated style that related to the theme of the story. Speech patterns for comedy would not be appropriate for tragedy, and even actors were restricted to their genre under the assumption that a type of person could tell one type of story best. This classical system worked well as long as the arts were largely directed by nobility and rich patrons. A common understanding of meaning was handy in knowing what the employer expected, and the crowds understood it.

During the Enlightenment period in 18th century Europe, this system of patronage began to change. A merchant middle class began to emerge with money to spend and time to spend it. Artists could venture away from classical genres and try new ways to attract paying patrons. &quot;Comedy&quot; could now mean Greek metered comedy, or physical camp, or some other type of experience. Artists were also free to use their mediums to express the human condition in a way that was not possible under single patronage, or at least not profitable. Art could be used to reflect and comment on the lives of ordinary people. Genre became a dynamic tool to help the public make sense out of unpredictable art. Because art is often a response to a social state, in that people write/paint/sing/dance about what they know about, the use of genre as a tool must be able to adapt to changing meanings. In fact, as far back as ancient Greece, new art forms were emerging that called for the evolution of genre, for example the &quot;tragicomedy.&quot;

Unfortunately, genre does have its limitations. Our world has grown so much that it is difficult to absolutely classify something. Information overlaps, and a single book can encompass elements of several genres. For example, a book might be classified as fiction, mystery, science fiction and African American literature all at once.
Genre suffers from the same ills of any classification system. Humans are pattern-seeking beings; we like to create order out of the chaos of the universe. However, when we forget that our order is imposed, often arbitrarily, over a universe of unique experiences, the merit of the individual gets lost. If a system of classification, like genre, is then used to assign value judgments, we allow our preconceptions about the whole to influence our opinion of the individual. Genre is useful as long as we remember that it is a helpful tool, to be reassessed and scrutinized, and to weigh works on their unique merit as well as their place within the genre.

A simple example of the inherent meaning in an art form is that of a western movie where two men face each other on a dusty and empty road; one wears a black hat, the other white. Independent of any external meaning, there is no way to tell what the situation might mean, but due to the long development of the &quot;western&quot; genre, it is clear to the informed audience that they are watching a gunfight showdown between a bad guy and a good guy.

It has been suggested that genres resonate with people because of the familiarity, the shorthand communication, as well as the tendency of genres to shift with public mores and to reflect the zeitgeist. While the genre of storytelling has been relegated as lesser form of art because of the heavily borrowed nature of the conventions, admiration has grown. Proponents argue that the genius of an effective genre piece is in the variation, recombination, and evolution of the codes.

Genre studies have perhaps gained the most recognition in film theory, where the study of genre directly contrasts with auteur theory, which privileges the director&#x27;s role in crafting a movie.

== In social communities ==
There is something more about genre theory, and to that effect it is necessary to propose Kristen H. Perry&#x27;s definition. Written (textual) genres are social constructions that represent specific purposes for reading and writing within different social activities, created by social groups who need them to perform certain things. They change over time, reflecting essential shifts in social function performed by that text. Genres also represent constellations of textual attributes: some attributes are necessary and other attributes are optional.

Another definition which shows the different aspects of genre theory is Miller who defines genres as &quot;typified rhetorical actions&quot; that respond to recurring situations and become instantiated in groups&#x27; behaviors. Genre evolves as &quot;a form of social knowledge—a mutual construing of objects, events, interests and purposes that not only links them but makes them what they are: an objectified social need&quot;. This view sees genres not as static forms but, rather, as &quot;forms of ways of being ... frames for social action ... environments for learning ... locations within which meaning is constructed&quot; (Bazerman), suggesting that different communities use different means of communication to accomplish their objectives.

To try to show the importance of the context in genre an example is used about a particular part of the genre theory—speech genres; but it is important to stress that context is really important in all situations. Context plays an important role in shaping genres (Holquist, 1986). Genre theory does not conceptualize context as simply the space outside of text or the container surrounding texts, but as dynamic environments that simultaneously structure and are structured by the communicative practices of social agents. Speech genres are recognizable patterns of language-in-context (Bakhtin, 1986): speech genres include both oral and written forms of language.

Researchers have also shown that the rhetorical moves people must make within accepted genres to communicate successfully in particular contexts operate to reinforce communities&#x27; identities and to legitimate particular communication practices. Thus, the genres that communities enact help structure their members&#x27; ways of creating, interpreting, and using knowledge (Myers; Winsor, Ordering, Writing; Bazerman, Shaping, Constructing; Berkenkotter and Huckin; Smart).
Genres are very important in our everyday life and we do not realize how much we use them, how much they affect us, or how much they determine the way we act and understand the others.

==Aspects of genre theory==

===Rhetorical situation===
A rhetorical situation is a situation that has the potential for modification by the use of discourse. Bitzer states, &quot;it is the situation which calls discourse into existence&quot;. Thus, the situation controls what type of rhetorical response takes place. Each situation has an appropriate response in which the rhetor can either fulfill or fail to fulfill. They express the imperative nature of the situation in creating discourse, because discourse only comes into being as a response to a particular situation. Discourse varies depending upon the meaning-context that is created due to the situation, and because of this, it is &quot;embedded in the situation&quot;.

According to Bitzer, rhetorical situations come into existence, at which point, they can either mature and be resolved, or mature and persist. Bitzer describes rhetorical situations as containing three components: exigence, audience, and constraints. He highlights six characteristics needed from a rhetorical situation that are necessary to creating discourse. A situation calls a rhetor to create discourse, it invites a response to fit the situation, the response meets the necessary requirements of the situation, the exigence which creates the discourse is located in reality, rhetorical situations exhibit simple or complex structures, rhetorical situations after coming into creation either decline or persist. Bitzer&#x27;s main argument is the concept that rhetoric is used to &quot;effect valuable changes in reality&quot; (Bitzer 14).

In 1984, Carolyn R. Miller claimed that &quot;situations are social constructs that are the result, not of &#x27;perception, but of &#x27;definition&#x27;&quot;. In other words, we essentially define as social recognitions. Although Bitzer never considers genre, Miller believes genres are created through social construction of perceived recurrence. Miller holds that, rhetorically, genre should be &quot;centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish&quot;. Since her view focuses on action, it cannot ignore that humans depend on the &quot;context of the situation&quot; as well as &quot;motives&quot; that drive them to action. Essentially, &quot;we create recurrence,&quot; or similar responses, through our &quot;construal&quot; of types. Miller defines &quot;types&quot; as &quot;recognition of relevant similarities&quot;. The way to bring about a new &quot;type&quot;, is to allow for past routines to evolve into new routines, thereby maintaining a cycle that is always open for change.

===Antecedent genres===
Written in 1975, Kathleen Hall Jamieson&#x27;s &quot;Antecedent Genre as Rhetorical Constraint&quot; declares that discourse is determined by the Rhetorical Situation, as well as antecedent genres. Antecedent genres are genres of the past that are used as a basis to shape and form current rhetorical responses. When placed in an unprecedented situation, a rhetor can draw on antecedent genres of similar situations in order to guide their response. However, caution should be taken when drawing on antecedent genres because sometimes antecedent genres are capable of imposing powerful constraints. The intent of antecedent genres are to guide the rhetor toward a response consistent with situational demands, and if the situational demands are not the same as when the antecedent genre was created, the response to the situation might be inappropriate.

Through three examples of discourse, the papal encyclical, the early State of the Union Address, and congressional replies, she demonstrates how traces of antecedent genres can be found within each. These examples clarify how a rhetor will tend to draw from past experiences that are similar to the present situation in order to guide them how to act or respond when they are placed in an unprecedented situation. Jamieson explains, by use of these three examples, that choices of antecedent genre may not always be appropriate to the present situation. She discusses how antecedent genres place powerful constraints on the rhetor and may cause them to become &quot;bound by the manacles of the antecedent genre&quot;. These &quot;manacles,&quot; she says, may range in level of difficulty to escape. Jamieson urges one to be careful when drawing on the past to respond to the present, because of the consequences that may follow ones choice of antecedent genre. She reiterates the intended outcome through her statement of &quot;choice of an appropriate antecedent genre guides the rhetor toward a response consonant with situational demands&quot;.

===Reciprocity of genre===
People often recognize genre based on the characteristics that the situation offers. Amy Devitt states this when she says, &quot;A genre is named because of its formal markers&quot; (Devitt 10). However she also says, &quot;the formal markers can be defined because a genre has been named&quot; (Devitt 10). When we label something as a certain genre, we also flag these same characteristics as contributing to what we already believe the genre to be. These two quotes show how reciprocity functions within genre. Devitt displays the reciprocal nature of genre and situation according to the individual by using an example of a grocery store list. A question posed by this example is, is something a grocery list because it lists groceries or is it a grocery list because one person says it is a grocery list and we thus recognize all the items on the list as groceries? Though each possible answer to this raised question contradict one another, they are both correct. Similarly, individuals recognize the characteristics of the recurring rhetorical situations in the same way as they see them as affirmation of what they already know about the preexisting genre. The rhetorical attributes of the genre act as both objects which define and are defined by genre. In other words, genre and rhetorical situations are reciprocals of one another. Devitt focused on activity system of genre and that the participants&#x27; situation, contexts and text are all mutually created &quot;no one aspect fully determines the other.&quot; (Devitt)

===Tyranny of genre===
The phrase &quot;tyranny of genre&quot; comes from genre theorist Richard Coe, who wrote that &quot;the &#x27;tyranny of genre&#x27; is normally taken to signify how generic structures constrain individual creativity&quot; (Coe 188). If genre functions as a taxonomic classification system, it could constrain individual creativity, since &quot;the presence of many of the conventional features of a genre will allow a strong genre identification; the presence of fewer features, or the presence of features of other genres, will result in a weak or ambiguous genre identification&quot; (Schauber 403).

Genres can act as constraints on readers as well. Literary historian Hans Robert Jauss describes genres as creating a &quot;horizon of expectation&quot; under which readers will interpret texts based on how much they correspond to the features of the genre they recognize from works they have previously read. The classification-system concept results in a polarization of responses to texts that do not fit neatly into a genre or exhibit features of multiple genres: &quot;The status of genres as discursive institutions does create constraints that may make a text that combines or mixes genres appear to be a cultural monstrosity. Such a text may be attacked or even made a scapegoat by some as well as be defended by others&quot; (LaCapra 220).

Under the more modern understanding of the concept of genre as &quot;social action&quot; à la Miller, a more situational approach to genre is enabled. This situational approach frees genre from the classification system, genre&#x27;s &quot;tyranny of genre&quot;. Relying on the importance of the rhetorical situation in the concept of genre results in an exponential expansion of genre study, which benefits literary analysis. One literature professor writes, &quot;The use of the contemporary, revised genre idea [as social action] is a breath of fresh air, and it has opened important doors in language and literature pedagogy&quot; (Bleich 130). Instead of a codified classification as the pragmatic application of genre, the new genre idea insists that &quot;human agents not only have the creative capacities to reproduce past action, such as action embedded in genres, but also can respond to changes in their environment, and in turn change that environment, to produce under-determined and possibly unprecedented action, such as by modifying genres&quot; (Killoran 72).

===Stabilization, homogenization and fixity===
Never is there total stabilization in a recognized genre, nor are there instances that indicate a complete lack of homogenization. However, because of the relative similarities between the terms &quot;stabilization&quot; and &quot;homogenization&quot;, the amount of stabilization or homogenization a certain genre maintains is based on opinion. Necessary discourse is, obviously, always needed and is thus considered perfectly stabilized. In rhetorical situation or antecedent genres, that which is unprecedented mostly leads to stable and predictable responses. Outside the natural setting of a given form of discourse, one may respond inappropriately due to an unrecognized alternate. The unrecognized alternate is created by the lack of homogenization or differing expectations in the presented rhetorical situation.

Fixity is uncontrolled by a given situation and is deliberately utilized by the affected before the rhetorical situation occurs. Fixity almost always directly effects stabilization, and has little to no bearing on homogenization. The choice of discourse will provide a certain value of fixity, depending on the specific choice. If a situation calls for more mediated responses, the fixity of the situation is more prevalent, and therefore is attributed with a stable demand of expectations. Stability nor fixity can be directly affected by the subject at hand. The only option is affecting homogenization which in turn, can positively or negatively affect stability. Directly choosing a fixed arena within genre inversely alters the homogenization of said chooser constituting as a new genre accompanied with modified genre subsets and a newly desired urgency. The same ideological theory can be applied to how one serves different purposes, creating either separate genres or modernized micro-genres. (Fairclough)

===Genre ecology and activity theory===

Activity theory is not grounded in any one area of field of research, but instead draws from several disciplines including psychology, behaviorism, and socio-cultural studies. Although activity theory originated in the social sciences, it is currently applied most frequently to social-scientific, organizational, and writing studies. Modeled as a triangle, activity theory considers how multiple factors (subject, object, mediating artifacts, rules, and division of labor) existing in an activity system (environment) interact to achieve an outcome. Central to activity theory is the concept of mediation. Human activities are driven by a need to achieve a certain outcome or goal. Typically this activity is mediated by artifacts which include tools, language, signs, and cultural norms. In &quot;Textual Objects&quot; Cheryl Geisler explains that texts are traditionally identified as meditational means to complete a task, though she offers that texts might also be identified as the motive in discourse communities in which text is valued as the outcome as opposed to the means of an outcome. Geisler notes that texts produced for meditational means are typically more private/personalized, whereas texts identified as objects are often written with a public motive. She does not argue, however, that texts should exist exclusively as one or the other, but rather she suggests that texts can function as both.

For some genre theorists, such as Clay Spinuzzi, genres are tools-in-use, and as such can be seen as mediating objects within the world. This view of genre as a tool-in-use is exemplified in the school of genre theory that studies genres&#x27; relationships to activity systems. In his article &quot;Textual Grounding: How People Turn Texts into Tools,&quot; Jason Swarts asserts that users utilize texts as tools when they recognize the text&#x27;s specific value in a rhetorical situation or environment. User&#x27;s then &quot;ground&quot; texts, altering the texts structure for personal use, to make them usable under very specific conditions. The user takes the text from a &quot;formalized representation of information&quot; to a personal tool. Swarts argues that the meaning of a text is established by uptake of the users, though this varies depending on the user and the user&#x27;s goal. Similarly, in &quot;Tracing Genres Through Organizations: A Sociocultural Approach to Information Design&quot;, Clay Spinuzzi asserts that the use of certain tools in certain situations can help users to act purposefully in that activity. Within this tradition of genre studies, &quot;Genres are not discrete artifacts, but traditions of producing, using, and interpreting artifacts, traditions that make their way into the artifact as a form-shaping ideology.&quot; The study of genres as mediating artifacts within activity systems is closely related to Activity Theory, in which the interactions of different spheres of activity are examined. Activity theory, according to David Russell, &quot;traces cognition and behavior, including writing, to social interaction.&quot; Activity theorists examine the ways that the work done in one sphere of activity could potentially change the work done in another. For example, Russell examines how people use writing to mediate their activities, and how changes in one activity can lead to changes in another activity. Russell points out that &quot;the activity system of cell biology research is not confined to universities. It also extends into boundary activity systems of drug companies, government medical research facilities, and so on.&quot; Subtle changes in the use of writing in one activity can effect changes in the use of writing in related systems. If the government sets down new pharmaceutical documentation laws, then the teaching of how to document the distribution of pharmaceuticals will change, not just in pharmacies, but also in hospitals and nursing classrooms. Activity systems are always in flux, because subtle changes in one level of the system result in subtle changes in other levels of the system. Activity systems are still relatively stable, despite their constant flux. The changes within them are often subtle, and large scale changes usually occur over long periods of time.

Genre ecology describes the dense connections between genres within the activities that they mediate. Multiple genres mediate a single activity; no genre exists in isolation. In &quot;The Ecology of Genre&quot; Anis Bawarshi argues that genres are &quot;rhetorical ecosystems&quot; in which participants actively enact and, consequently, reenact social practices, relations, and identities. Participants use genre to interpret and perform social motives which sustain rhetorical ecosystems that produce social contexts, practices, and identities. For Spinuzzi, and other genre theorists studying the social aspects of genre (like Carolyn R. Miller, Amy Devitt, and Kathleen Jamieson, among others), genre is more than a category or artifact; genre is a way of interacting with the world. In the study of genre ecologies, genre is seen as a way people can accomplish activities. Like activity systems, genre ecologies are not entirely stable, because activities change, causing the genres mediating them to change, as well. Take, for example the digitization of the workplace. Before computers, the workspace was largely mediated by genres such as the paper memo,or the company newsletter. After digitization, paper memos and paper newsletters began to disappear. Memos and newsletters did not disappear; instead, their distribution method changed. Now, memos and newsletters are disseminated electronically in emails. The genres of the memo and newsletter still exists, but they have changed, slightly, to reflect the changes in the activity system that they mediate.

===Secondary speech genres===
Analyzing the interaction between multiple, competing voices and registers in literary works, Mikhail Bakhtin argued that complex, secondary speech genres are constituted by simple, primary speech genres. Bakhtin defined complex, secondary speech genres as &quot;novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, major genres of commentary, and so forth [that] arise in more complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication&quot; (62). While Bakhtin focused on the historical emergence of the novel in much of his work, in &quot;The Problem of Speech Genres&quot; he claimed that his theory applied to all literary genres, including &quot;profoundly individual lyrical work[s]&quot; (61) such as the pastoral elegy. Complex, secondary speech genres form when they &quot;absorb and digest various primary (simple) genres that have taken form in unmediated speech communion&quot; (62). Primary speech genres are &quot;short rejoinders of daily dialogue,&quot; &quot;everyday narration,&quot; &quot;brief standard military command&quot; (60), &quot;verbal signals in industry&quot; (63), &quot;letters, diaries, minutes, and so forth&quot; (98), notable for their referentiality to and function within the pragmatic communicative contexts of &quot;extraverbal reality (situation)&quot; (83). When primary speech genres are absorbed by secondary ones, according to Bakhtin, they are &quot;altered and assume a special character,&quot; losing &quot;their immediate relation to actual reality and to the real utterances of others&quot; (62). This process of absorption and digestion of primary speech genres by secondary ones leads to a &quot;more or less distinct dialogization of secondary genres, the weakening of their monological composition&quot; (66). It is unclear, however, how this distinction between primary and secondary genres would apply in such quotidian comments as &quot;I don&#x27;t trust Joe&#x27;s opinion, he has such a strange way of looking at things&quot; or &quot;Mary forwarded that recipe from the vegan website, so you need to be into that stuff to try it.&quot; While Bakhtinian dialogization may weaken the monological composition of secondary speech genres, it does not preclude a dominant theme, ideology, or cultural meaning from arising out of interplay of the &quot;various transformed primary genres&quot; (98) that make up a secondary work (although, Bakhtin admitted, this dominant ideology is difficult to isolate in complex works, and is, to a certain extent, left open to the interpretation of individual readers). In Bakhtin&#x27;s view, primary genres undergo a more or less thorough process of contestation and resolution within the secondary work they constitute and &quot;enter into actual reality only via the [work] as a whole, that is, as a literary-artistic event and not as everyday life&quot; (62). &quot;As a rule, these secondary genres of complex cultural communication play out various forms of primary speech communication&quot; (Bakhtin 98). Even as a work permits and enacts dialogization between characters, conventional forms, and semantic content, it resolves or &quot;finalizes&quot; that content into a &quot;wholeness&quot; of utterance, which is intelligible to readers, and therefore &quot;guarantee[s] the possibility of response (or of responsive understanding)&quot; (76). Through the finalization of disparate conventional and thematic strands, a work achieves the fullness of what Bakhtin called its &quot;specific authorial intent,&quot; Milton&#x27;s &quot;speech plan&quot; or &quot;speech will&quot; for his work, and readies itself for responsive understanding (reception, interpretation) on the part of readers (77). Despite its internal dialogization, the work delivers itself to readers as a semantically exhaustive whole, and in this way uses its internal drama to respond ideologically to its genre: &quot;other works connected with it in the overall processes of speech communication in [its] particular cultural sphere&quot; (75). These include &quot;works of predecessors on whom the author relies,&quot; &quot;other works of the same school,&quot; and &quot;works of opposing schools with which the author is contending&quot; (75). In this way the work forms a crucial &quot;link the chain of speech communion&quot; of its genre (76).

<text>The AN/ASQ-228 Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) is a multi-sensor, electro-optical targeting pod incorporating thermographic camera, low-light television camera, target laser rangefinder/laser designator, and laser spot tracker developed and manufactured by Raytheon. It is used to provide navigation and targeting for military aircraft in adverse weather and using precision-guided munitions such as laser-guided bombs. It is intended to replace the earlier AN/AAS-38 Nite Hawk pod in US Navy service.

ATFLIR is 72 in (183 cm) long, weighs 420 lb (191 kg), and has a slant range of 40 mi (64.3 km), said to be useful at altitude of up to 50,000 ft (15,240 m). It has fewer parts than many previous systems, which is intended to improve serviceability (although early examples, in service with VFA-115 &#x27;Eagles&#x27; in 2003 experienced problems). Crews indicate that it offers much greater target resolution and image accuracy than previous systems.

ATFLIR presently is used by the US Navy on the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the earlier F/A-18C/D and with Marine Corps F/A-18Cs when deployed onboard aircraft carriers. It is normally carried on one of the fuselage hardpoints otherwise used for AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles. 410 pods were delivered to the U.S. Navy. Pods have also been delivered to Switzerland and Australia (for its EA-18G Growler fleet), and six pods will be delivered to Malaysia.

The US Navy is considering options to either improve or replace ATFLIR because of current hardware readiness state and sustainment costs.

<text>Sony Music Entertainment (SME), commonly known as Sony Music, is an American multinational music company owned by Sony Entertainment and managed by the American umbrella division of multinational conglomerate Sony Group Corporation. It is the recording division of Sony Music Group, with the other half being the publishing division, Sony Music Publishing.

Founded in 1929 as American Record Corporation, it was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1938 and renamed Columbia Recording Corporation. In 1966, the company was reorganized to become CBS Records. Sony bought the company in 1988 and renamed it SME in 1991. In 2004, Sony and Bertelsmann established a 50–50 joint venture known as Sony BMG to handle the operations of Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG), but Sony bought out Bertelsmann&#x27;s stake four years later and reverted to using the 1991 company name. This buyout led to labels formerly under BMG ownership, including Arista, Jive, LaFace and J Records into former BMG and currently Sony&#x27;s co-flagship record label, RCA Records, in 2011 and led to the relaunch of BMG as BMG Rights Management. Arista Records would later be revived in 2018.

On July 17, 2019, Sony announced a merger of Sony Music Entertainment and music publishing arm Sony/ATV to form the Sony Music Group. The merger was completed on August 1, 2019.

, Sony Music Entertainment is the second largest of the &quot;Big Three&quot; record companies, behind Universal Music Group and followed by Warner Music Group. Its music publishing division Sony Music Publishing (formerly Sony/ATV) is the largest music publisher in the world.

== History ==
=== 1929–1938: American Record Corporation ===

The American Record Corporation (ARC) was founded in 1929 through a merger of several record companies. The company grew over the next several years, acquiring other brands such as the Columbia Phonograph Company, including its Okeh Records subsidiary, in 1934.

=== 1938–1970: Columbia/CBS Records ===
In 1938, ARC was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) under the guidance of chief executive William S. Paley. The company was later renamed Columbia Recording Corporation, and changed again to Columbia Records Inc. in 1947. Edward Wallerstein, who served as the head of Columbia Records since the late 1930s, helped establish the company as a leader in the record industry by spearheading the successful introduction of the LP record. Columbia&#x27;s success continued through the 1950s with the launch of Epic Records in 1953 and Date Records in 1958. By 1962, the Columbia Records productions unit was operating four plants around the United States located in Los Angeles, California; Terre Haute, Indiana; Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Pitman, New Jersey.

Columbia&#x27;s international arm was launched in 1962 under the name &quot;CBS Records&quot;, as the company only owned the rights to the Columbia name in North America. In 1964, the company began acquiring record companies in other countries for its CBS Records International unit and established its own UK distribution outfit with the acquisition of Oriole Records.

By 1966, Columbia was renamed CBS Records and was a separate unit of the parent company, CBS-Columbia Group. In March 1968, CBS and Sony formed CBS/Sony Records, a Japanese business joint venture.

=== 1971–1991: CBS Records Group ===

In 1971, CBS Records was expanded into its own &quot;CBS Records Group&quot;, with Clive Davis as its administrative vice president and general manager. In the 1980s to the early 1990s, the company managed several successful labels, including CBS Associated Records, which signed artists including Ozzy Osbourne, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Electric Light Orchestra, Joan Jett, and Henry Lee Summer. In 1983, CBS expanded its music publishing business by acquiring the music publishing arm of MGM/UA Communications Co. CBS later sold the print music arm to Columbia Pictures. By 1987, CBS was the only &quot;big three&quot; American TV network to have a co-owned record company. With Sony being one of the developers behind the compact disc digital music media, a compact disc production plant was constructed in Japan under the joint venture, allowing CBS to begin supplying some of the first compact disc releases for the American market in 1983.

In 1986, CBS sold its music publishing division, CBS Songs, to SBK Entertainment. On November 17, 1987, Sony acquired CBS Records for US$2 billion. CBS Inc., now Paramount Global, retained the rights to the CBS name for music recordings but granted Sony a temporary license to use the CBS name. The sale was completed on January 5, 1988. CBS Corporation founded a new CBS Records in 2006, which was distributed by Sony through its RED subsidiary.

In 1989, CBS Records re-entered the music publishing business by acquiring Nashville-based Tree International Publishing.

=== 1991–2004: Sony Music Entertainment ===

Sony renamed the record company Sony Music Entertainment (SME) on January 1, 1991, fulfilling the terms set under the 1988 buyout, which granted only a transitional license to the CBS trademark. The CBS Associated label was renamed Epic Associated. Also on January 1, 1991, to replace the CBS label, Sony reintroduced the Columbia label worldwide, which it previously held in the United States and Canada only, after it acquired the international rights to the trademark from EMI in 1990. Japan is the only country where Sony does not have rights to the Columbia name as it is controlled by Nippon Columbia, an unrelated company. Thus, Sony Music Entertainment Japan issues labels under Sony Records. The Columbia Records trademark&#x27;s rightsholder in Spain was Bertelsmann Music Group, Germany, which Sony Music subsequently subsumed via a 2004 merger, and a subsequent 2008 buyout.

In 1995, Sony and pop singer Michael Jackson formed a joint venture which merged Sony&#x27;s music publishing operations with Jackson&#x27;s ATV Music to form Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

=== 2004–2008: Sony BMG ===

&lt;br&gt;
In August 2004, Sony entered a joint venture with an equal partner Bertelsmann, by merging Sony Music and Bertelsmann Music Group, Germany, to establish Sony BMG Music Entertainment. However, Sony continued to operate its Japanese music business independently from Sony BMG and BMG Japan was made part of the merger.

The merger made Columbia and Epic sister labels to RCA Records, which was once owned by CBS rival, NBC. It also started the process of bringing BMG&#x27;s Arista Records back under common ownership with its former parent Columbia Pictures, a Sony division since 1989, and brought Arista founder Clive Davis back into the fold. As of 2017, Davis was still with Sony Music as a chief creative officer.

=== 2008–present: Sony Music revival and restructuring ===
On August 5, 2008, Sony Corporation of America (SCA) and Bertelsmann announced that Sony had agreed to acquire Bertelsmann&#x27;s 50% stake in Sony BMG. The acquisition was completed on October 1, 2008. On July 1, 2009, SME and IODA announced a strategic partnership to leverage worldwide online retail distribution networks and complementary technologies to support independent labels and music rights holders. In March 2010, Sony Corp partnered with The Michael Jackson Company in a contract of more than $250 million, the largest deal in recorded music history.

From 2009 to 2020, Sony owned 50% of Syco Entertainment, which operates some of the world&#x27;s most successful reality TV formats, including &quot;Got Talent&quot; and &quot;The X Factor&quot; with Simon Cowell. Cowell acquired Sony&#x27;s stake in 2020.

Doug Morris, who was head of Warner Music Group, and later Universal Music, became chairman and CEO of Sony Music Entertainment on July 1, 2011. Sony Music underwent restructuring upon Morris&#x27;s arrival; with some artists switching labels and other labels eliminated.

In June 2012, a consortium led by Sony/ATV acquired EMI Music Publishing, making Sony/ATV the world&#x27;s largest music publisher at the time. This acquisition also reunited the common ownership of pre-1986 CBS Songs (as SBK Songs) catalog to Sony/ATV.

Rob Stringer became CEO of Sony Music Entertainment on April 1, 2017. He previously served as chairman and CEO of Columbia Records.

Sony has experienced many changes with its international labels. In February 2012, Sony Music reportedly closed its Filipino office due to piracy, and Ivory Music and Video had been handling distribution for its catalog a few months earlier in July 2011. In early 2018, their distribution deal with Ivory expired and SME resumed its operations in the Philippines, with the new offices still located in Ortigas Center, Pasig. In July 2013, Sony Music withdrew from the Greek market due to an economic crisis. Albums released by Sony Music in Greece from domestic and foreign artists would then be carried by Feelgood Records.

In June 2017, Sony announced that by March 2018 it would be producing vinyl records internally for the first time since ceasing its production in 1989. Reporting the decision, the BBC noted that, &quot;Sony&#x27;s move comes a few months after it equipped its Tokyo studio with a cutting lathe, used to produce the master discs needed for manufacturing vinyl records&quot; but added that &quot;Sony is even struggling to find older engineers who know how to make records&quot;.

On February 5, 2019, a group of 1970s-era musicians including David Johansen and John Waite filed lawsuits accusing Sony Music Entertainment and UMG Recordings, Inc. of improperly refusing to let them reclaim the rights to songs they had signed away earlier in their careers. The lawsuit cites U.S. copyright law, which gives artists who formerly bargained away their rights on unfavorable terms a chance to reclaim those rights by filing termination notices after 35 years. The plaintiffs claim that Sony and UMG have &quot;routinely and systematically&quot; ignored hundreds of notices, having taken the position that recordings are &quot;works made for hire&quot; and are therefore not subject to being reclaimed.

In April 2021, the Brazilian media company Grupo Globo sold its domestic record label Som Livre to Sony Music for an undisclosed amount. It was approved by the Administrative Council for Economic Defense on November 4, 2021.

The UK media company Somethin&#x27; Else was acquired outright by Sony Music in 2021, to form a Global Podcast Division, headed up by the Somethin&#x27; Else principles, Steve Ackerman and Jez Nelson. The new division was to have teams in New York, LA and London. 

In 2022, Sony Music Entertainment acquired boutique branding and merchandising agency, Ceremony of Roses (CoR). CoR would handle SME&#x27;s &#x27;branding, design, media and events&#x27;. The newly acquired company would merge with Sony&#x27;s existing merch division and continue under the CoR banner. The merger brought together artists like Adele, A$AP Rocky, and Lil Nas X under one merchandising house. According to Sony, the move will help expand their merchandising team and take artists&#x27; merch to the next level.

In January 2023, Sony Music and Alamo Records founder Todd Moscowitz launched Santa Anna, an artist and label services company.

In April 2024, it was announced Sony Music Entertainment&#x27;s Global Podcast Division had acquired the Los Angeles-headquartered podcast production company, Neon Hum Media for an undisclosed amount.

== Sony Music Canada ==
Sony Music Canada was formed when Sony Music acquired Canadian assets of CBS Records in 1990 (itself formerly Columbia Records Canada in 1954).

Sony Music Canada is operated by Sony Canada, which evolved from General Distributors or Gendis, which had been founded in Winnipeg in 1954 by Albert D. Cohen, who had made a deal with Sony to market its transistor radios in the same year.

== Sony Music UK ==
Sony Music UK is owned and operated by Sony Music Entertainment in the United Kingdom. Since 2014, Jason Iley has been chairman and CEO of Sony Music UK. Though owned by Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Music UK has standalone operations in the UK to promote musicians within the UK.

In June 2017, it was announced that Sony would be merging its two independent distribution companies The Orchard and Red Essential.

In 2014, Sony had its best singles success of 33 years, with 11 number 1 singles. Sony Music artists won a total of five individual awards at the BRITs 2015, including Best Female Solo Artist for Paloma Faith, and Mark Ronson&#x27;s &quot;Uptown Funk&quot;, which picked up Best British Single. Several other of the label&#x27;s artists – Foo Fighters, One Direction and Pharrell Williams – also collected awards.

Sony&#x27;s performance at the BRITs 2015 was the label&#x27;s best in nearly 20 years, winning a total of 5 awards. In 2017, Sony Music UK celebrated the most successful BRIT Awards in the company&#x27;s history, winning seven of the 11 awards.

Sony Music UK has made key acquisitions including forming Insanity Records with Insanity Management. Craig David became the first artist to sign an album deal with Insanity Records. Sony Music UK signed Robbie Williams, who released his 11th album &quot;The Heavy Entertainment Show&quot; in 2016. Jason Iley commented that the agreement was &quot;a once in a lifetime signing with the biggest male solo artist of our generation&quot;.

Sony Music UK incorporated the independent sales and distribution company Essential Music and Marketing – renamed to Red Essential. In August 2016, Sony Music acquired Ministry of Sound Recordings, home to London Grammar, DJ Fresh and Sigala.

On April 5, 2017, two of Sony Music UK&#x27;s labels won awards at the annual Music Week Awards. Columbia Records was awarded A&amp;R of the Year, and Syco was awarded Record Company of the Year.

In 2021, Sony agreed to buy Kobalt neighboring rights division and independent distribution company AWAL, from the Kobalt Music Group for $430 million.

== Sony Music Russia ==
Sony Music Entertainment Russia was the Russian music label of Sony Music Entertainment. The company opened its division in the Russian Federation in 1999. In 2000, the first contract was signed with the Russian group Bi-2. For 2021, experts estimated the company&#x27;s share in the Russian recording market at approximately 15-20%. Sony Music Entertainment LLC&#x27;s revenue in 2021 amounted to 2.56 billion rubles ($42.7 million). Net profit amounted to 132.9 million rubles ($2.22 million).

On March 10, 2022, in connection with Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sony Music Entertainment announced the suspension of operations and new releases in Russia, while Russian employees of Sony Music Group receive pay indefinitely. On September 8, Sony Music officially announced its final withdrawal from Russia. The company recalled all foreign catalogs from the Russian streaming services Yandex Music, Zvooq and VK Music, and tracks from AC/DC, Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Bring Me the Horizon and many other artists were removed. The Russian division is intended as a completely independent structure from Sony Music to represent only local musicians under the new brand Kiss Koala, which was later bought by the structures of former top managers of Warner Music Russia.

== Criticism and controversies ==
=== CD price fixing ===

Between 1995 and 2000, music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as minimum advertised pricing to artificially inflate prices of compact discs. This was done in order to end price wars of the early 1990s among discounters such as Best Buy and Target. A settlement was reached in 2002 that included music publishers and distributors Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music and Universal Music. In restitution for price fixing, they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups but admitted no wrongdoing. It is estimated that customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million overall and up to $5 per album.

=== George Michael ===

British artist George Michael, signed to Columbia in the U.S. and Epic worldwide, advised Sony executives in 1990 that he would not be appearing in music videos to support his forthcoming album, &quot;Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1&quot;. Michael then accused Sony of not promoting the album at all. He sued in the UK in 1992, asking to be released from his contract. Sony ultimately prevailed in the courts in 1994, but Michael&#x27;s contract was bought out by other labels. Some 11 years later, Michael licensed tracks to Sony for release.

=== Michael Jackson and Tommy Mottola ===
The release of &quot;Invincible&quot; was preceded by a dispute between Michael Jackson and Sony Music Entertainment. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him sometime in the early 2000s, after which he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep the profits; however, clauses in the contract set the revert date years into the future. Jackson discovered that the attorney who had represented him in the deal had also been representing Sony. He was also concerned that for years Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in its music catalog venture; he feared that Sony might have had a conflict of interest, since if Jackson&#x27;s career failed, he would have had to sell his share of the catalog at a low price. Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.
In July 2002, Jackson alleged that the then-Sony Music chairman Tommy Mottola was a &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own gain. He charged that Mottola had called his colleague Irv Gotti a &quot;fat nigger&quot;. Sony refused to renew Jackson&#x27;s contract, and claimed that a promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the United States.

=== Prosecution of copyright infringement ===
In May 2012, Sony Music filed charges against the website IsoHunt. The plaintiff&#x27;s claims in the court document filed at the Supreme Court of British Columbia read: &quot;The IsoHunt Websites have been designed and are operated by the defendants with the sole purpose of profiting from rampant copyright infringement which defendants actively encourage, promote, authorize, induce, aid, abet, materially contribute to and commercially profit from.&quot; In February 2016, in a lawsuit filed at a California federal court, Sony Music Entertainment and its associated brands (Arista Records and LaFace Records, formerly owned by Bertelsmann Music Group) accused Belgian radio aggregator Radionomy (owned by Universal Music Group&#x27;s parent Vivendi) of copyright infringement.

=== Kesha v. Dr. Luke and 2016 boycott ===

In February 2016, 100,000 people signed an online petition in less than 24 hours, calling for a boycott of Sony Music and all other Sony-affiliated businesses after rape allegations against music producer Dr. Luke were made by musical artist Kesha. Kesha asked a New York City Supreme Court to free her from her contract with Sony Music, but the court denied the request, prompting a widespread public and media response.

<doc id="1071665" wikidata="Q584720" url="?curid=1071665" title="Music for the Masses">
<text>Music for the Masses is the sixth studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 28 September 1987 by Mute Records. The album was supported by the Music for the Masses Tour, which launched their fame in the United States when they performed at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The tour led to the creation and filming of the documentary/live album titled &quot;101&quot;.

Considered one of the band&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2006). The album reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart.

It was preceded by the singles &quot;Strangelove&quot;, released on 13 April, &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot;, released on 24 August. Two other singles followed the release of the album, one being &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot;, released 28 December, and the other being &quot;Little 15&quot;, which was released on 16 May the following year.

==Background and recording==
Depeche Mode had released their album &quot;Black Celebration&quot; in early 1986, followed up with a supporting tour which lasted through the middle of that year, and contributed the song &quot;But Not Tonight&quot; to the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Modern Girls&quot; (1986). Daniel Miller, citing growing tension in the studio during the recording of &quot;Black Celebration&quot;, stepped away from production duties. With Miller&#x27;s approval, the band approached David Bascombe to co-produce &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, who had previously worked as a recording engineer with Tears for Fears and Peter Gabriel. &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; saw the band using heavy amounts of sampling, much like they did in &quot;Black Celebration&quot;.

The album was recorded at Studio Guillame Tell outside of Paris, and mixed in Puk Studio in Denmark. The song &quot;Little 15&quot; was one of the last to come together during the sessions, as the band wasn&#x27;t quite sure how to put it together. The group, having seen &quot;A Zed &amp; Two Noughts&quot; during the sessions, decided to try the song in the style of its soundtracks, and &quot;from there, it was easy. It just flowed.&quot; &quot;Behind the Wheel&quot; had a sequence of four chords that kept cycling, which Alan Wilder compared to Penrose stairs; &quot;once you get around, you&#x27;re back at the bottom again. That&#x27;s kind of how the chord sequence works [in the song].&quot; For &quot;Pimpf&quot;, Wilder said that it &quot;starts off with one little riff that just feeds on itself. ... You&#x27;ve got this one thing and we just keep adding and adding and adding to it.&quot;

==Album title==
Band members Andy Fletcher and Martin Gore both explained the album&#x27;s title was conceived as a joke, after Gore found an old album called &quot;Music for the Millions&quot;. Fletcher said, &quot;The title&#x27;s ... a bit tongue-in-cheek, really. Everyone is telling us we should make more commercial music, so that&#x27;s the reason we chose that title.&quot; According to Gore, the title &quot;was a joke on the uncommerciality of [the album]. It was anything but music for the masses!&quot; Miller agreed, saying that the name &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; was &quot;about how Depeche Mode were forever destined to be a cult band who could never quite crack the mainstream,&quot; disproved by the success of Depeche Mode&#x27;s subsequent tours and albums.

==Cover art==
The megaphone (or its iconic representation) on the album&#x27;s cover was used during the breadth of the album&#x27;s release: at press events, on the covers of the album&#x27;s singles, and during the tour. Alan Wilder gave credit to Martyn Atkins, who had been a longtime Depeche Mode collaborator, for the use of the megaphone. &quot;[Martyn came] up with this idea of a speaker, but, to give the kind of ironic element which the title has, to put this speaker in a setting which wasn&#x27;t really to do with the masses at all. It was, in fact, the opposite. So you end up with this kind of eerie thing where you get these speakers or megaphones in the middle of a setting that doesn&#x27;t suit it at all, like a desert or whatever.&quot; They took the megaphone, mounted it to a pole, and drove up to the Peak District to take pictures. Atkins called the cover his favorite of all the Depeche Mode album covers he was involved in.

An early alternative cover was rejected for the album. The rejected cover was also designed by Atkins and a test pressing copy was auctioned off by Wilder in 2011. It features a white-and-orange stylised design of the megaphone emitting sound waves. This alternate artwork was planned to be used for a budget series of albums, but the project was scrapped.

==Tour==

The tour began in October 1987 with a European leg, starting in Madrid and finishing mid-November in Paris. In early December, a North American run commenced in San Francisco and culminated three weeks later in New York City.

In January 1988, the group played an eleven-date UK tour, which was followed by further dates in Europe beginning in Hamburg, West Germany in early February. The leg wrapped up in Vienna in late March.

In April 1988, the group played four dates in Japan. This was followed later in the month by the start of a second North American leg, which began in Mountain View, California. The entire tour concluded mid-June with a concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, where the band performed in front of a sold-out crowd of nearly 80,000 people, released as the live album &quot;101&quot; in 1988.

==Re-release==
In 2006, &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; became one of the first Depeche Mode albums (along with &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; and &quot;Violator&quot;) to be released on a special two-disc SACD/CD Hybrid + DVD format, in the vein of their eleventh studio album &quot;Playing the Angel&quot; (2005), which had a limited edition SACD + DVD release. The format was the same as &quot;Playing the Angel&quot;″s, the first disc had a special digitally remastered version of the album, while the DVD had the album on three formats (PCM Stereo, 5.1 surround sound and DTS 5.1) plus bonus tracks, and a documentary on the album. The re-release preserves the album as it was originally intended. Thus, the four bonus tracks do not appear on the SACD, but appear on the DVD. The DVD also features all B-sides from the &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; era, but unlike the album and the bonus tracks, the B-sides are only available in PCM Stereo.

The documentary, a 37-minute short film titled &quot;Depeche Mode: 1987–88 (Sometimes You Do Need Some New Jokes)&quot;, is an extensive look at the album, featuring commentary from a wide variety of people, including the current Depeche Mode, former member Wilder, producer David Bascombe, Daniel Miller, Daryl Bamonte, Atkins, Anton Corbijn, and others. The documentary features new facts on the album, and also an extensive look at the film &quot;101&quot;.

The re-release was released on 3 April 2006 in Europe. The US version was delayed to 2 June 2006 and is only available on a CD + DVD format, with no SACD. The DVD on all the versions are region independent, but differ in television formats: PAL or NTSC. The remastered album was released on vinyl on 2 March 2007 in Germany and 5 March 2007 internationally.

==Critical reception==

The album mostly received favourable reviews upon release. Robert Christgau complimented the abnormal road symbolism of the lyrics, particularly on &quot;Little 15&quot;, and believed that apart from the sadomasochistic metaphors, Depeche Mode succeeded in turning &quot;adolescent &quot;Weltschmerz&quot; into something catchy, sexy and seemingly significant&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; Jane Solanas felt Gore was &quot;at his obsessive best&quot; on &quot;Music for the Masses&quot;, particularly on &quot;Never Let Me Down Again&quot;, which she called &quot;an intriguing masterpiece, combining homo-eroticism with drug euphoria.&quot; In a less enthusiastic review, Paul Mathur from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; was ambivalent towards the group&#x27;s more mature, minimalist aesthetic and said although they had departed from their simpler pop sound, the record was &quot;seamless, fluid, and, once the lights are out, particularly dull.&quot;

In a retrospective review, &quot;Q&quot; magazine found the narratives on &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; to be among Depeche Mode&#x27;s most uncertain and contemplative, and that most of its songs were &quot;real diamonds in the darkness ... this was the point at which Depeche Mode were first taken seriously.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s Sal Cinquemani said that &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; showed the gloomier side of the &quot;post-punk synthpop&quot; scene during the 1980s and was a success with both critics and consumers. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; called the record &quot;articulate, intricate electronic music that lacked the tinny feel of DM&#x27;s early synth pop&quot;. &quot;Music for the Masses&quot; was listed by &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; at number 75 on their list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2006).

<doc id="1071666" wikidata="Q708421" url="?curid=1071666" title="Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey">
<text>Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, PC, (10 July 16146 April 1686) was an Anglo-Irish royalist statesman. After short periods as President of the Council of State and Treasurer of the Navy, he served as Lord Privy Seal between 1673 and 1682 for Charles II. He succeeded his father as 2nd Viscount Valentia in 1660, and he was created Earl of Anglesey in 1661.

==Early life==
Annesley was born in Dublin, Ireland, to Francis Annesley, 1st Viscount Valentia, and his first wife Dorothy, daughter of Sir John Philipps, Bt, of Picton Castle. He was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1634 as a Bachelor of Arts; that year, he was admitted into Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. Having made the grand tour he returned to Ireland; and being employed by Parliament on a mission to the Duke of Ormonde, now reduced to the last extremities, he succeeded in concluding a treaty with him on 19 June 1647, thus securing the country from complete subjection to the rebels. In April 1647 he was returned for Radnorshire to the House of Commons.

He supported the parliamentarians against the republican or army party, and may have been one of the members excluded in Pride&#x27;s Purge during 1648, though some sources claim he wasn&#x27;t. As a moderate and a presbyterian, he was highly sceptical of the army&#x27;s decisions towards the end of the war. He did support Oliver Cromwell however, though at this time Cromwell wasn&#x27;t as powerful as he would later become as Lord Protector, as the New Model Army was under the command of Lord Fairfax. His loyalty to Cromwell may have allowed him to retain his seat in parliament after the events of 1648. He sat in Richard Cromwell&#x27;s parliament as Member of Parliament for Dublin City, and endeavoured to take his seat in the restored Rump Parliament of 1659. He was made President of the Council of State in February 1660, and in the Convention Parliament sat for Carmarthen. The anarchy of the last months of The Protectorate converted him to royalism, and he showed great activity in bringing about the English Restoration. He used his influence in moderating measures of revenge and violence, and while sitting in judgement on the regicides was on the side of leniency. He was sworn of the Privy Council on 1 June and in November he succeeded his father as Viscount Valentia in the Irish peerage. On 20 April 1661, he was created Baron Annesley, of Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire and Earl of Anglesey in the Peerage of England.

Anglesey supported the king&#x27;s administration in parliament, but opposed strongly the unjust measure which, on the abolition of the Court of Wards and Liveries, placed the extra burden of taxation thus rendered necessary on the Excise. His services in the administration of Ireland were especially valuable. He filled the office of Vice-Treasurer from 1660 till 1667, served on the committee for carrying out the declaration for the settlement of Ireland and on the committee for Irish affairs, while later, in 1671 and 1672, he was a leading member of various commissions appointed to investigate the working of the Acts of Settlement. In February 1661 he had obtained a captaincy of horse, and in 1667 he exchanged his post of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland with Sir George Carteret for that of Treasurer of the Navy.

He was elected as a Bailiff to the board of the Bedford Level Corporation in 1664 and again in 1679, a position he then held until his death.

==Later years==

His public career was marked by great independence and fidelity to principle. On 24 July 1663, he alone signed a protest against the Act for the Encouragement of Trade, on the plea that owing to the free export of coin and bullion allowed by the act, and to the importation of foreign commodities being greater than the export of home goods, &quot;it must necessarily follow ... that our silver will also be carried away into foreign parts and all trade fail for want of money.&quot; He especially disapproved of another clause in the same bill forbidding the importation of Irish cattle into England, a mischievous measure promoted by the Duke of Buckingham, and he opposed again the bill brought in with that object in January 1667, though without success. This same year his naval accounts were subjected to an examination in consequence of his indignant refusal to take part in the attack upon Ormonde; and he was suspended from his office in 1668, no charge, however, against him being substantiated. He took a prominent part in the dispute in 1671 between the two Houses concerning the right of the Lords to amend money bills, and wrote a learned pamphlet on the question entitled &quot;The Privileges of the House of Lords and Commons&quot; (1702), in which the right of the Lords was asserted. In April 1673, he was appointed Lord Privy Seal, and was disappointed at not obtaining the Great Seal the same year on the removal of Lord Shaftesbury.

In the bitter religious controversies of the time, Anglesey showed great moderation and toleration. In 1674 he is mentioned as endeavouring to prevent the justices from putting into force the laws against the Roman Catholics and Nonconformists. In the panic of the &quot;Popish Plot&quot; in 1678 he exhibited a saner judgment than most of his contemporaries and conspicuous courage. On 6 December he protested with three other peers against the measure sent up from the Commons enforcing the disarming of all convicted recusants and taking bail from them to keep the peace; he was the only peer to dissent from the motion declaring the existence of an Irish plot; and though believing in the guilt and voting for the death of Lord Stafford, he interceded, according to his own account, with the king for him as well as for the barrister Richard Langhorne and Oliver Plunkett, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland.

His independent attitude drew upon him an attack by the notorious informer Dangerfield, and in the Commons by the Attorney General, Sir William Jones, who accused him of endeavouring to stifle the evidence against the Romanists. In March 1679 he protested against the second reading of the bill for disabling the Earl of Danby.

In 1681, Anglesey wrote &quot;A Letter from a Person of Honour in the Country&quot;, as a rejoinder to the Earl of Castlehaven, who had published memoirs on the Irish rebellion defending the action of the Irish and the Roman Catholics. In so doing Anglesey was held by Ormonde to have censured his conduct and that of Charles I in concluding the &quot;Cessation&quot;, and the duke brought the matter before the council. Anglesey was by now disillusioned about the efficacy of the Council, complaining bitterly that Councillors were kept in ignorance of what passed between the King and the Secretaries of State. In 1682 he wrote &quot;The Account of Arthur, Earl of Anglesey ... of the true state of Your Majesty&#x27;s Government and Kingdom&quot;, which was addressed to the king in a tone of censure and remonstrance, but appears not to have been printed till 1694. In consequence he was dismissed on 9 August 1682, from the office of Lord Privy Seal.

In 1683, Anglesey appeared at the Old Bailey as a witness in defence of Lord Russell, and in June 1685 he protested alone against the revision of Lord Stafford&#x27;s attainder. He divided his time between his estate at Blechingdon in Oxfordshire, and his house on Drury Lane in London, where he died in 1686 from quinsy, closing a career marked by great ability, statesmanship and business capacity, and by conspicuous courage and independence of judgement. He amassed a large fortune in Ireland, in which country he had been allotted lands by Cromwell. At his death, his library of books was believed to be the largest English library not in ecclesiastical hands. He was buried at Farnborough, Hampshire.

The unfavourable character drawn of him by Burnet is certainly unjust and not supported by any evidence. Pepys, a far more trustworthy judge, speaks of him invariably in terms of respect and approval as a &quot;grave, serious man,&quot; and commends his appointment as treasurer of the navy as that of &quot;a very notable man and understanding and will do things regular and understand them himself&quot;. That being so, his appearance was also said to be strange, even alarming: &quot;his face long and emaciated, his complexion between purple and green.&quot; 

On a more intellectual point, he was a learned and cultivated man and collected a celebrated library, which was dispersed at his death. His books were sold at auction in London beginning on 26 October 1686. The sale was interrupted by the overseer of the press, Sir Roger L’Estrange, to withdraw controversial materials which included the removal of works by John Milton. Many of his books have now been identified, however, including a heavily annotated copy of the Latin translation of Margaret Cavendish&#x27;s &quot;Life of William Cavendish.&quot;

==Works==
* &quot;A True Account of the Whole Proceedings betwixt ... the Duke of Ormond and ... the Earl of Anglesey&quot; (1682)
* &quot;A Letter of Remarks upon Jovian&quot; (1683)
* &quot;The King&#x27;s Right of Indulgence in Matters Spiritual ... asserted&quot; (1688)
* &quot;Truth Unveiled, to which is added a short Treatise on ... Transubstantiation&quot; (1676)
* &quot;The Obligation resulting from the Oath of Supremacy&quot; (1688)
* &quot;England&#x27;s Confusion&quot; (1659)
* &quot;Reflections on a Discourse concerning Transubstantiation&quot;

Memoirs of Lord Anglesey were published by Sir P. Pett in 1693, but contain little biographical information and were repudiated as a mere imposture by Sir John Thompson, his son-in-law, in his preface to Lord Anglesey&#x27;s &quot;State of the Government&quot; in 1694. The author however of the preface to &quot;The Rights of the Lords&quot; asserted (1702), while blaming their publication as &quot;scattered and unfinished papers,&quot; admits their genuineness.

==Marriage and legacy==
Anglesey married Elizabeth, daughter and co-heiress of Sir James Altham of Oxey, Hertfordshire, a baron of the Exchequer, and his first wife Margaret Skinner. They had seven sons and six daughters, including:
* James (1645–1690), who succeeded as 2nd Earl of Anglesey, married (in 1669) Elizabeth, daughter of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland and Frances Montagu;
* Altham, created Baron Altham;
* Richard (died 1701), served as Dean of Exeter and succeeded as 3rd Baron Altham, married Dorothy, daughter of John Davey, of Ruxford, Devon;
* Arthur;
* Charles, who married Margaret Eyre and had issue;
* Dorothy, married Richard Power, 1st Earl of Tyrone (1630–1690) in 1654;
* Elizabeth, married Alexander MacDonnell, 3rd Earl of Antrim (1615–1699);
* Frances (died 1704/5), married firstly Francis Windham, of Felbrigg, Norfolk, and secondly (in 1668) John Thompson, 1st Baron Haversham;
* Philippa (died 1714/5), married firstly Charles Mohun, 3rd Baron Mohun (their son was the duellist Charles, 4th Baron Mohun), and secondly William Coward, of Wells, Somerset; and
* Anne, married Sir Francis Wingate J.P. of Harlington Grange, Harlington. The latter arrested John Bunyan and committed him to prison. Bunyan was held overnight at Harlington Grange.

James&#x27;s sons succeeded as the 3rd, 4th and 5th earls. Richard&#x27;s second son, Richard (died 1761), succeeded his cousin as the 6th earl, and left a son Arthur (1744–1816), whose legitimacy was doubted and his father&#x27;s English titles were declared extinct. He was summoned to the Irish House of Peers as Viscount Valentia, but was denied his writ to the parliament of Great Britain by a majority of one vote. He was created Earl of Mountnorris in 1793 in the Peerage of Ireland. All the male descendants of the 1st Earl of Anglesey became extinct in the person of George, 2nd Earl of Mountnorris, in 1844, when the titles of Viscount Valentia and Baron Mountnorris passed to his cousin Arthur (1785–1863), who thus became 10th Viscount Valentia, being descended from the 1st Viscount Valentia the father of the 1st Earl of Anglesey in the Annesley family. The 1st viscount was also the ancestor of the Earls Annesley in the Irish peerage.

<text>Auraria was a gold mining camp established in 1858 in the Kansas Territory of the United States. Today it survives in its original location as a neighborhood of Denver, Colorado, immediately south of the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River.

==Geography==
Auraria is in central Denver, just west of downtown, and is roughly triangular, bordered by Colfax Avenue on the south, Cherry Creek to the northeast, and South Platte River to the northwest.

== History ==
On October 3, 1858, a group of Georgia prospectors led by Green Russell established the townsite of Auraria south of Cherry Creek near the Cherry Creek Diggings, over a month before a group of Kansas Territory speculators led by William Larimer established the rival Denver City on the other side of Cherry Creek. Henry Allen, a surveyor, laid the town platte and was Auraria town company&#x27;s first president. The town was named for the gold mining settlement of Auraria, Georgia. On October 29, Charles H. Blake and A.J. Williams opened a mercantile business out of wagons in Auraria.

On January 18, 1859, the United States Post Office Department authorized the first three post offices in the Pike&#x27;s Peak gold region: Auraria, Kansas Territory; Montana, Kansas Territory; and St. Vrain, Nebraska Territory. Henry Allen was the first postmaster of Auraria. On, April 15, 1859, ten delegates from six communities in the Pike&#x27;s Peak Country met in convention at Dick Wooton’s store in Auraria to pass resolutions to organize a Provisional State of Jefferson. On April 23, William Byers published the first edition of the Rocky Mountain News, the Rocky Mountain region&#x27;s first newspaper, at Auraria. At an election on September 24, voters rejected the proposed state, but on October 24, voters approved the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson.

Auraria ceased to exist as a separate town on December 3, 1859, when the Jefferson Territory granted a charter to the consolidated City of Denver, Auraria, and Highland, which would come to be known as just Denver City, the territorial capital and seat of Arrappahoe County. The Auraria post office was renamed Denver City on February 11, 1860. The Jefferson Territory was itself superseded on February 28, 1861, when U.S. President James Buchanan signed An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado.

Auraria suffered a devastating flood on May 19, 1864. In response, many businesses left the neighborhood. Some speculate that Auraria never truly recovered from this event. However for the next century Auraria continued as a neighborhood mixing industry, commerce and housing. Residents included working class and varying immigrant populations. By the 1920s Auraria&#x27;s residents were largely Hispanic.

In 1965, parts of Auraria were again heavily damaged by flooding, leading city leaders to describe the neighborhood as blighted and in need of urban renewal. In 1969 Denver citizens approved a bond issue to purchase approximately half of Auraria&#x27;s land area to form an educational campus. An estimated 400 to 900 residents were relocated, along with 249 businesses. Demolition began on March 10, 1973, and the area became the home of University of Colorado Denver, Metropolitan State University, and Community College of Denver. The Displaced Aurarian Scholarship program offers free tuition to these institutions for direct descendants of those displaced from Auraria. A few buildings from old Auraria are still standing today.

The name &quot;Auraria&quot; survives in Denver as the neighborhood along the west bank of Cherry Creek to the east bank of the South Platte River, bordered on the south by Colfax Avenue. 

== Pending redevelopment ==
A large section of Auraria not included in the Auraria Higher Education Campus, and located northwest of Auraria Parkway, is occupied by two large entertainment complexes and is bisected by the RTD lightrail tracks. Elitch Gardens is currently northwest of the rail lines, whereas Ball Arena is to the south. Plans have been proposed that suggest changes to these areas and have moved through some of the approval processes, but no firm date has been set for redevelopment. Despite mitigation after the 1965 flood, this part of Auraria is still largely within the 100-year flood plain, so rechanneling the South Platte River is a precondition for the developments.

In 2018, the City and County of Denver approved rezoning and development agreements for The &quot;River Mile&quot;, 58 acres currently occupied by Elitch Gardens. To make room for this mixed use development, Elitch Gardens will move, but no date has been set.

In 2024, the City and County of Denver approved rezoning and development agreements for 64 acres of Auraria centered around the Ball Arena (which will remain).

==Sports==
Auraria contains the Ball Arena arena, home of the Colorado Avalanche, Denver Nuggets, and Colorado Mammoth, as well as the venue of concerts and other events.

==Education==

The neighborhood of Auraria is dominated by the Auraria Campus, which is home to three institutions of higher learning: University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver), Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver), and Community College of Denver (CCD). Vestiges of the old neighborhood remain, however, in the Ninth Street Historic Park on the campus. The three institutions occupy the bulk of the Auraria Neighborhood, so there is very little permanent residence. The schools mainly serve commuter students, though housing has recently been developed at Campus Village Apartments (UCD), Auraria Student Lofts, and Regency Student Housing.

==Media==
There are two student newspapers that are published in Auraria. The University of Colorado Denver&#x27;s newspaper is called the &quot;CU Denver Sentry&quot; and Metropolitan State University&#x27;s newspaper is &quot;Met Media&quot;.

==Transportation==

Auraria is serviced by the Regional Transportation District. In addition to service from several bus lines, it has four light rail stations within its boundaries: Colfax at Auraria station, Auraria West station, Empower Field at Mile High station and Ball Arena–Elitch Gardens station.

<text>Number 13 Squadron, also written as XIII Squadron, is a squadron of the Royal Air Force which operate the General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle from RAF Waddington since reforming on 26 October 2012. The unit first formed as part of the Royal Flying Corps on 10 January 1915 and went on to fly the Martinsyde G.100, the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2, the SPAD VII and SPAD XIII, the Sopwith Dolphin during the First World War. In the Second World War it started out operating the Westland Lysander for army cooperation. From late 1942 it used Blenheims in North Africa but in 1943 squadron converted to Ventura for coastal patrols and convoy escort duties. Post war it operated Mosquito before transitioning to the new jet aircraft Gloster Meteor and English Electric Canberra for photoreconnaissance. From 1 January 1990, it operated the Panavia Tornado, initially the GR1A at RAF Honington and later the GR4/4A at RAF Marham where it temporarily disbanded on 13 May 2011.

==History==

===First World War===
No. XIII Squadron RFC was formed at Fort Grange, RAF Gosport, Hampshire, on 10 January 1915 and moved to France and the Western Front on 19 October 1915, initially on Army co-operation duties and subsequently on bombing raids, pioneering formation bombing. Aircraft types operated during the war included the Martinsyde G.100, the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2, the Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8, the SPAD VII and SPAD XIII, and the Sopwith Dolphin fighters. The squadron disbanded on 31 December 1919.

===Second World War===
The unit had reformed at RAF Kenley on 1 April 1924 and inter-war years saw the squadron operate from various UK bases equipped with a variety of aircraft types including the Bristol F.2 Fighter, Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, Hawker Audax and Hawker Hector for army cooperation. By January 1939 the squadron was equipped with Westland Lysanders and moved to France on 2 October until late May 1940 when it withdrew to UK bases following the Fall of France.

In May 1941 No. XIII Squadron changed role and theatre, flying a variety of bomber aircraft including the Bristol Blenheim and Douglas Boston light bombers in the Mediterranean until the end of the war, disbanding on 19 April 1946.

===Cold War (1946–1982)===

No. XIII Squadron reformed as No. 13 (Photographic Reconnaissance) Squadron on 1 September 1946 at RAF Ein Shemer, Palestine, when No. 680 Squadron was renumbered. Peace heralded the return to reconnaissance duties, with the unit flying the de Havilland Mosquito PR.34. Moving to Egypt, the squadron converted to the Gloster Meteor PR.10 in 1952 and by 1956 was operating the English Electric Canberra PR.7.

During the 1956 Suez Crisis, the squadron flew reconnaissance flights over Syria from Cyprus, which resulted in one Canberra being shot down by the Syrian Air Force.

In 1978, the squadron moved to RAF Wyton near Huntingdon in the UK, flying Canberra PR.7 and PR.9s, built by Short Brothers, until the unit disbanded on 1 January 1982.

===Panavia Tornado (1990–2011)===
====RAF Honington &amp; Gulf War (1990–1994)====
The squadron reformed at RAF Honington on 1 January 1990 equipped with reconnaissance Tornado GR.1A aircraft. These aircraft were equipped with the new and somewhat embryonic reconnaissance equipment designed to exploit the night, all-weather capability of the Tornado by using a unique system of infra-red sensors and video recorders. The complete system is carried and allows the Navigator to either view the imagery in real time or later in the mission. As the Allied Coalition began to deploy forces to the Gulf in the latter part of 1990, it quickly became apparent that the unique night reconnaissance capability of the Tornado GR.1A could provide vital intelligence to the Allied commanders. As a result, on 15/16 January 1991, immediately before hostilities commenced, 6 aircraft were deployed to Saudi Arabia. During the first nights of the War, the Reconnaissance Wing successfully discovered several of the elusive Scud sites.

The majority of sorties were however, tasked into Central and Eastern Iraq to identify the disposition of the various Iraqi ground forces in preparation for the ground offensive. Although the rest of the Coalition Air Forces moved to medium level operations after the first few nights of the air war, the GR.1As operated at night and at low-level for the duration of the conflict. The Squadron was also fundamental to the success of the Tornado/TIALD (Thermal Imaging And Laser Designation) combination. 4 XIII Squadron crews began the work-up from mid-January and, after encouraging results, four aircraft flew to Tabuk.

After the war, the Squadron continued its peacetime training role at RAF Honington as well as taking part in Operation Jural, the monitoring of a No-Fly Zone in the South of Iraq below the 32nd parallel north.

====RAF Marham (1994–2011)====
On 1 February 1994, No. XIII Squadron moved to RAF Marham. Since that time, the Squadron has taken part in a number of successful exercises around the world from Yuma in America to Penang, Malaysia. Deployments to operational theatres have continued to be a major feature of the squadron&#x27;s life having deployed on Operation Warden and Operation Bolton to monitor both the Northern and Southern No-Fly Zones in Iraq. XIII Squadron crews joined the Ali Al Salem Combat Air Wing (Composite RAF Squadron formed from the Tornado GR4 Force for Gulf War 2) in early 2003 and flew Scud Hunting missions in the Western Desert of Iraq during the Iraq War of 2003. The squadron also flew the last sortie by a Tornado in support of Operation Telic in 2009.

In the summer of 2010 the squadron flew Close Air Support in Afghanistan as part of Operation Herrick, and in 2011 they fired Storm Shadow missiles against Libya in the early days of Operation Ellamy. A few weeks later, on 13 May 2011, the squadron was disbanded as part of the reductions announced in the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010.

===MQ-9 Reaper (2012–present)===
At the disbandment parade of XIII (Tornado) Squadron in May 2011, the Chief of the Air Staff announced the formation of a second unit operating the MQ-9 Reaper RPAS, which would receive the XIII Squadron numberplate. XIII (Reaper) Squadron was reformed on 26 October 2012 at RAF Waddington. Subsequently, the Squadron flew the first remote operational mission from UK soil towards the end of April 2013 and conducted its first remote weapons strike a few days later.

The squadron will re-equip with Protector RG Mk1 when that comes into service around 2024.

<text>Betulio Segundo González (born October 24, 1949) is a former boxer from Venezuela, who is considered a national hero in Venezuela. He is considered by many to be Venezuela&#x27;s greatest world champion in boxing history. A combatant of 92 bouts, he fought until eleven months before he turned forty, the mandatory age for professional fighters to retire in Venezuela.

==Professional career==
A native of Maracaibo, Zulia State he made his professional boxing debut on April 24, 1968, knocking out Elio Monzat in the third round at Gonzalez&#x27;s hometown. Gonzalez won his first ten fights, including his Caracas debut, on November 25 of that same year, with a ten-round decision over Evencio Bruguillos.

On August 1, 1969, his winning streak came to a halt, when he was held to a ten-round draw (tie), by Juan José Brizuela in Caracas. He beat Brizuela by a ten-round decision in a September 16 rematch, then challenged Hector Criollo for the Venezuelan Flyweight title on October 10. He won his first belt by knocking out Criollo in seven rounds to win the regional title.

On March 6, 1970, he suffered a somewhat surprising defeat, at the hands of Felix Marquez, who had only five prior professional fights. He was knocked out by Marquez in six rounds. He followed this with a win over Marquez by 12 rounds split decision to retain the Venezuelan flyweight title in a rematch as well as a win over Nestor Jimenez and a loss to Ignacio Espinal; both Jimenez and Espinal would later go on to fight for world titles.

On April 1, 1971, he got his first world title try, in what also was his first fight abroad. Fighting Masao Ohba in Tokyo for the WBA world Flyweight title, he dropped a fifteen-round unanimous decision.

After three more wins, he had his second chance at a world title: on November 20, he faced world champion Erbito Salavarria for his WBC world title. The fight resulted in a controversial fifteen-round draw: The Zulia State boxing commission alleged that Salavarria had been given sugar or illegal drugs during the fight, and sent the WBC a bottle with which the sugar or drugs had supposedly been administered. The WBC recognized Gonzalez to be as world champion.

He lost the title in his second defense, being handed a tenth-round knockout by Venice Borkhorsor on September 29 at Bangkok. He defeated Socrates Batoto in his lone defense.

Gonzalez had four wins in a row after that loss, and, on August 4, 1973, he became a world Flyweight champion for the second time, when he claimed the vacant WBA title by defeating Miguel Canto by a fifteen-round majority decision in Maracaibo.

On November 17, he retained the title with an eleventh-round knockout over Alberto Morales. On May 19, 1974, he faced Shoji Oguma, another world champion boxer, in a non-title, ten round bout held at Tokyo. Gonzalez prevailed by a ten-round decision. On July 20, Gonzalez fought in Italy against Franco Udella, a world Jr. Flyweight champion, and he retained the WBA world Flyweight title with a tenth-round knockout.

Oguma became the WBA world Flyweight champion when he beat Gonzalez, on November 1, with a fifteen-round split decision in Tokyo.

After one more win, Gonzalez and Canto met, this time with Canto as WBC world champion. Canto defeated Gonzalez by a fifteen-round split decision on May 24, 1975 at Monterrey, Mexico.

Gonzalez then won eight fights in a row, before fighting for the Fecarbox regional Flyweight title. On June 20, 1976, he won that title by knocking out Hildo Roche in two rounds. On November 10, he and Canto had a third match; Canto retained the WBC world Flyweight title with a fifteen-round split decision, in a fight held in Caracas.

Gonzalez won eight more fights in a row before being given another chance at becoming world Flyweight champion. On August 12, 1978, he joined the exclusive group of boxers who have become world champions three times in the same division, by defeating Guty Espadas by a fifteen-round majority decision in Caracas. This fight proved controversial as well, as Gonzalez appeared to be knocked down in the last round, but the fight&#x27;s referee chose not to count it as a knockdown.

On November 4, he retained the title against the famed but maligned Chilean fighter Martin Vargas, a national hero in his country himself, with a twelfth-round knockout. Then, he and Oguma proceeded to have a third encounter, and, on January 1, 1979, they fought to a fifteen-round draw in Hamamatsu.

Gonzalez returned to Japan in July 1979, where, on July 6, he avenged his previous defeat to Oguma, by retaining the title with a twelfth-round knockout. But in his next defense, against Luis Ibarra, he lost a fifteen-round decision and the world title on November 17.

Gonzalez then embarked on another winning streak, which reached seven victories in a row, including two knockouts over future world champion Peter Mathebula, in ten and six rounds, respectively. This winning streak stopped when he challenged Juan Herrera for the WBA world Flyweight title on December 19, 1981. Trying to become a world Flyweight champion for the fourth time, Gonzalez was knocked out in seven rounds.

Santos Laciar went on to beat Herrera for the WBA world title, and, after Gonzalez got another win, the two boxing legends met, on September 14, 1982, at a Maracaibo hotel. In what turned out to be his last try at becoming world Flyweight champion for the fourth time, Gonzalez lost a split decision to the Argentine boxer.

After losing by a twelve-round decision to Alberto Castro for the Fedelatin Flyweight title on July 7, 1984, Gonzalez announced his retirement for the first time.

In 1988, however, he returned to boxing for one more fight: having lost on November 28 to future world champion Rodolfo Blanco by knockout in eight rounds, he retired, eleven months before mandatory retirement in Venezuela.

He became a household name all over Latin America during his tenures as world champion, especially after the Spanish boxing magazines &quot;Ring En Español&quot; and &quot;Guantes&quot; helped popularize him.

<text>William Larimer Jr. (October 24, 1809 – May 16, 1875) was an American businessman, investor, militia general, and politician who is best known as the founder of Denver, Colorado, in 1858. Larimer often went by &quot;General Larimer&quot;, having acquired the title in the Pennsylvania Militia.

==Biography==
Larimer was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, and made his first fortune in the railroad industry in Pittsburgh. He became a land speculator in the 1850s in the Kansas Territory, founding a homestead in Leavenworth where he lived with his wife and nine children. In 1858, Larimer helped found the Denver City Land Company with the intention of creating a new city in the western part of the territory.

On November 22, 1858, Larimer arrived at a hill overlooking the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River. The site was across Cherry Creek from the existing settlement of Auraria, founded by William Greenburry Russell who is credited with starting the Pike&#x27;s Peak Gold Rush. Larimer staked his claim by laying cottonwood logs along a square-mile parcel of land on the hill. Larimer chose the name &quot;Denver City&quot; to honor the governor of the Kansas Territory, James W. Denver, with the intention that the city would become the county seat of Arapaho County. In a letter dated February 1859, he had declared that &quot;I am Denver City.&quot;

Larimer planned the site and aggressively sold tracts to miners and other migrants traveling through the Rocky Mountains. In the first years, tracts were often traded for grubstakes and in gambling. In 1860, all of the stockholders of Denver City merged with their rivals in Auraria, forming one city under the name Denver. Larimer was instrumental in the formation of the Colorado Territory in 1861, and in making Denver its capital. He anticipated being named the first governor of the territory, but was disappointed when Abraham Lincoln gave the appointment to William Gilpin of Missouri, in part as a favor to the governor of the state. After this unexpected turn of events, Larimer became a United States commissioner and a judge of probate for the First Judicial District of Colorado. During the Civil War, he became a colonel for the Third Regiment of Colorado Volunteers, and after returned to Kansas.

After serving as a Kansas state senator from 1867 until 1870, Larimer retired to his family farm in Leavenworth, Kansas, where he died in 1875. He is commemorated in the city he helped found by Larimer Street in downtown, as well as Larimer Square. He is also commemorated by Larimer County, Colorado, in the northern part of the state, and by the Larimer neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

<text>Smash Records was an American record label founded in 1961 as a subsidiary of Mercury Records. 

== History ==
Mercury Record Corporation president Irving Green announced the formation of the company’s new pop subsidiary label, Smash Records, in March 1961. Smash was seen as an opportunity for greater exposure and sales for both newly-signed talent and for independently cut masters.

In the summer of 1961, the label achieved its first number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Wooden Heart,&quot; by Joe Dowell.

In November 1961, label head Charles Fach announced the label would move into the &quot;country and western&quot; field, and announced the signing of two artists, Billy Deaton and Howard Crockett. Mercury A&amp;R chief Shelby Singleton was tapped to head the C&amp;W production. Singleton was interested in Southern styles, and had recruited east Texas&#x27;s Big Bopper and Johnny Preston to the parent label. 

Eventually, Smash Records&#x27; roster expanded to include artists from other music genres, such as Frankie Valli, James Brown, Bruce Channel, Roger Miller, The Left Banke, Bill Justis, and Jerry Lee Lewis. 

A dispute with King Records led James Brown to release all of his band&#x27;s instrumental recordings between 1964 and 1967 on Smash. Smash also released three of Brown&#x27;s vocal recordings, including his 1964 proto-funk single &quot;Out of Sight&quot;.

Smash shared the numbering system for its singles with other labels that the label distributed. The most significant of these was Fontana Records. Mercury discontinued the Smash label in 1970.
After Smash parent Mercury was acquired by PolyGram in 1972, the Smash imprint was used for reissues in the 1980s. PolyGram revived Smash in 1991 as an R&amp;B/dance label with its offices located in Chicago. It was first under the PolyGram Label Group (PLG) umbrella, then under the Independent Label Sales (ILS) umbrella, then under Island Records until the imprint was retired in 1996. One of the hits Smash saw during this period was &quot;People Are Still Having Sex&quot; by house music producer LaTour. Another successful artist on the dance charts was Jamie Principle.

<doc id="1071703" wikidata="Q288771" url="?curid=1071703" title="Hans van Mierlo">
<text>Henricus Antonius Franciscus Maria Oliva &quot;Hans&quot; van Mierlo (; 18 August 1931 – 11 March 2010) was a Dutch politician and journalist who co-founded Democrats 66 (D66).

Van Mierlo studied Law at the Radboud University Nijmegen obtaining a Master of Laws degree and worked as a journalist and editor for the &quot;Algemeen Handelsblad&quot; from August 1960 until January 1967. In October 1966 Van Mierlo was one of the co-founders of the Democrats 66 (initially abbreviated D&#x27;66) party, and became its first party leader and lead candidate for the 1967 general election. Van Mierlo was elected to the House of Representatives and became parliamentary leader on 23 February 1967. For the 1971 and 1972 general elections Van Mierlo served again as lead candidate. On 1 September 1973 Van Mierlo unexpectedly announced he was stepping down as party leader, stating that he would not stand for the 1977 general election but would continue to serve in the House of Representatives as a frontbencher until the end of the parliamentary term.

Van Mierlo semi-retired from active politics and became active in the public sector as a non-profit director, and worked as a television producer for the &quot;VARA&quot; from January 1980 until September 1981. After the 1981 general election, Van Mierlo was appointed as Minister of Defence in the Van Agt II cabinet taking office on 11 September 1981. The cabinet fell just seven months into its term on 12 May 1982 and was replaced by the caretaker Van Agt III cabinet with Van Mierlo continuing his position and shortly thereafter announced that he would not not stand for the 1982 general election. Van Mierlo continued to be active in politics and was elected to the Senate in the 1983 Senate election, serving as a frontbencher and spokesperson for foreign affairs. For the 1986 general election Van Mierlo again served as lead candidate and returned to the House of Representatives as parliamentary leader on 3 June 1986. For the 1989 and 1994 general elections Van Mierlo once again served as lead candidate, and following a successful cabinet formation with Labour Party leader Wim Kok and People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy leader Frits Bolkestein formed the Kok I cabinet, with Van Mierlo appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, taking office on 22 August 1994. In March 1997 Van Mierlo announced that he was stepping down as leader a second time but that he would stand for the 1998 general election. After a cabinet formation, Van Mierlo was asked to continue to serve in the new cabinet in a different function, but declined and returned to the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998. Shortly after the installation of the Kok II cabinet, Van Mierlo announced his retirement and resigned from the House of Representatives on 18 August 1998.

Van Mierlo retired from active politics at 67 and again became active in the public sector as a non-profit director and served as a diplomat for several economic and diplomatic delegations on behalf of the government, and continued to be active as a advocate and lobbyist for more European integration, republican issues and government reforms. Van Mierlo was known for his abilities as a skilful debater and effective negotiator. Van Mierlo was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 24 October 1998 and continued to comment on political affairs as a statesman until his death in March 2010 from the complications of a Hepatitis C infection at the age of 78.

==Early life==


Henricus Antonius Franciscus Maria Oliva van Mierlo was born on 18 August 1931 in Breda in the province of North Brabant in a Roman Catholic family as the second child of eight children of Anthonius Alphonsus Marie van Mierlo (born 9 May 1902) and Adriana Maria Francisca van der Schrieck (born 3 April 1905). After receiving his Gymnasium-A diploma at the Canisius College in Nijmegen he studied at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where he received a Bachelor of Laws and Master of Laws degree in 1960. After graduating, he became a journalist for the &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot; and worked as a managing editor from 1960 until 1967, first as an editor Home Affairs, later as the opinion page&#x27;s chief editor.

==Politics==

===Party foundation===
In 1966 Van Mierlo together with Hans Gruijters founded the Democrats 66 party after continuing frustrations with &quot;The Establishment&quot; parties. Van Mierlo was selected as Leader and chairman of the Democrats 66 on 14 October 1966. For the 1967 general election Van Mierlo was the lead candidate and won seven seats in the House of Representatives, the first time the Democrats 66 won representation in the States General of the Netherlands.

Van Mierlo was elected to the House of Representatives and became the parliamentary leader of the Democrats 66 on 23 February 1967. For the 1971 general elections Van Mierlo again as lead candidate won eleven seats. For the 1972 general election Van Mierlo for the third time as lead candidate won only six seats but after a long formation period a coalition agreement with the Labour Party (PvdA), Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP), Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and the Political Party of Radicals (PPR) was made which formed the Den Uyl cabinet.

Hans Gruijters became Minister of Housing and Spatial Planning. Because of the disappointing election results Van Mierlo resigned as parliamentary leader and party leader on 1 September 1973. Van Mierlo remained a member of the House until after the 1977 general election on 8 June 1977.

===Cabinet of Dries van Agt===
After the 1981 general election Van Mierlo was asked by Jan Terlouw to become Minister of Defence in the Second Van Agt cabinet under Prime Minister Dries van Agt of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and served from 11 September 1981 until 4 November 1982. After the 1983 Senate election of 1983 Van Mierlo was elected to the Senate, serving from 13 September 1983 until 4 June 1986.

In 1986 Van Mierlo staged a political comeback and was re-elected as Leader of the Democrats 66 on 25 January 1986. For the 1986 general election, Van Mierlo, back as lead candidate, won nine seats. For the 1989 general election Van Mierlo, again as lead candidate, won twelve seats. For the 1994 general election Van Mierlo, for the sixth time as lead candidate, won twenty four seats and the Democrats 66 became a major party in the House of Representatives.

===Cabinet of Wim Kok===
After an arduous cabinet formation with the Labour Party and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), a deal was struck that resulted in the First Kok cabinet with Van Mierlo becoming Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs serving from 22 August 1994 until 3 August 1998.

The First Kok cabinet was considered groundbreaking in Dutch politics, because it was the first Cabinet of the Netherlands since 1908 without a Christian democratic party. On 7 March 1997, Van Mierlo announced his retirement as Leader of the Democrats 66. Van Mierlo remained Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs until the Second Kok cabinet was installed on 3 August 1998. For the 1998 general election, Van Mierlo was re-elected to the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998 but resigned on 18 August 1998.

===Convention on the Future of Europe===
Van Mierlo semi-retired from active politics on his sixty-seventh birthday. He served as the first Dutch representative to the Convention on the Future of Europe from 1 March 2002 until 26 September 2002. Following the end of his active political career, Van Mierlo occupied numerous seats on supervisory boards on cultural organizations.

==Personal==
He was appointed Minister of State on 24 October 1998, a mainly honorary title for politicians with an extensive history of government service. Hans van Mierlo was married thrice. He has a son from his first marriage and two daughters from the second. Since 1999 Van Mierlo had a relationship with the Dutch writer Connie Palmen; they got married on 11 November 2009, in Amsterdam.

Hans van Mierlo died on 11 March 2010 at the age of 78; he had been living with a transplanted liver since 2000 which was required after liver failure as a consequence of a hepatitis C contamination contracted from a blood transfusion in 1982.

<text>Jebel Musa (, &quot;&quot;; ; meaning &quot;Mount Moses&quot;) is a mountain in the northernmost part of Morocco, on the African side of the Strait of Gibraltar. It is part of the Rif mountain chain. The mountain is generally identified as the southern Pillar of Hercules, Mons Abila (Mount Abila or Abyla).

==History==
Jebel Musa, named, according to the 14th-century Berber Muslim geographer Ibn Battuta, in honour of Musa bin Nusayr, to whom the conqueror of Andalusia Tariq ibn Ziyad owed fealty, was known to the ancient Greeks and Phoenicians as &quot;Mount Abyla&quot; and to the Romans as &quot;Columna&quot;. Together with the Rock of Gibraltar to the north, it is generally identified as one of the Pillars of Hercules (this title is also claimed for Monte Hacho in the Spanish exclave of Ceuta, to the east of Jebel Musa).

The name &quot;pillars of Hercules&quot; derives from one of the twelve labours assigned by the Greek hero Heracles. Perseus had defeated the Titan Atlas by showing him the head of the Gorgon. Atlas was petrified; his hair became a forest and his shoulders became cliffs. Heracles was then directed to get the Cattle of Geryon and deliver them to Eurystheus. Heracles&#x27; way was blocked by the mountain that Perseus had created; to clear a way, he used his mace to split the mountain in half, one part becoming the Rock of Gibraltar and the other becoming a mountain in Morocco. According to the myth, this split in the mountain created a sea link between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. This link was the Strait of Gibraltar.

==Geography==
Jebel Musa is high. To the north, across the Strait of Gibraltar, lie Spain and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. To the east is Ceuta, a Spanish exclave, and to the west and south is Morocco. By road, the mountain is about west of Ceuta and about east of Tangier.

Jebel Musa is opposite the Rock of Gibraltar at the entrance to the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. It is an important landmark in the region of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima on the north coast of Morocco. The coastlines around the mountain show evidence of having had varying sea levels through the ages. These highstands are at 120–130 metres; 80 to 90 metres; 40 to 60 metres and from 0 to 25 metres above the present sea level.

In Ceuta, around the town of Benzú, the mountain is known as &quot;The Dead Woman&quot; (), because from that direction it resembles a woman on her back.

==Ecology==
The mountain is a site for birdwatching. Migratory birds use the updraughts and thermals from Jebel Musa to gain height before attempting to cross the Strait of Gibraltar. The Strait of Gibraltar is &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most prominent&quot; migration bottlenecks and raptor watching is popular in the fall, though the best observation points may be north of the Strait. The site has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports significant populations of migrating soaring birds, especially raptors, cranes and storks, as well as passerines and waders. The shoreline at the foot of the mountain has been designated as a protected Ramsar site since 2019.

The area around the mountain has over 200 caves that attract visiting cavers. The area around the mountain is mainly forest and is identified in the Plan for Protected Areas in Morocco as a Site of Biological and Ecological Interest (SIBE).

<doc id="1071710" wikidata="Q2054713" url="?curid=1071710" title="Buckhorn Weston">
<text>Buckhorn Weston is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset, situated in the Blackmore Vale about west of the town of Gillingham. It lies on the western edge of the former royal hunting ground of Gillingham Forest. The underlying geology is Oxford clay and Corallian limestone. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 356.

==History==
In Saxon times the area was known as Bokere Waston, which meant &#x27;hamlet in the wilderness near the dyke&#x27;. Saxons invaded the area around 450 AD, driving out existing inhabitants and possibly erecting a temple on the site of a previous place of worship. When the Saxons converted to Christianity in about 600 AD, they built a church to replace the temple.

In 1086 Buckhorn Weston was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Westone&quot;; it had 26 households, 6 ploughlands and of meadow. It was in Gillingham hundred and the tenant-in-chief was Count Robert of Mortain. In 1349 the village was badly affected by the plague and its population much reduced. 

Later, the estate passed via the Stourton family (associated with Stourhead) and the Fane family into the hands of the Stapleton family in 1837 who remained substantial local landowners until the death of Sir Miles Stapleton in 1979. The village inn still bears the family name and coat of arms. In celebration of the Millennium, the village was enabled to build a new village hall with the help of significant external funding.

==Parish Church==
The Parish Church of St John the Baptist is a Grade II listed building. The church was well established by the beginning of the 13th century and has probably existed from earlier times. The present building dates largely from the 14th and 15th centuries, though in the 19th century much of it was significantly altered, which included the rebuilding of the west tower in 1861 and the organ loft in 1870.

<doc id="1071713" wikidata="Q2262061" url="?curid=1071713" title="Ian Fleming Publications">
<text>Ian Fleming Publications Limited (formerly known as Glidrose Productions Limited, from 1972 to 1998, and Ian Fleming (Glidrose) Publications Limited, from 1998 to 2002, named after its founders John Gliddon and Norman Rose) is a production company. In 1952, author Ian Fleming bought it after completing his first James Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;; he assigned most of his rights in &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, and the works which followed it to Glidrose.

In 1956, Ian Fleming hired literary agent Peter Janson-Smith to handle the foreign translation rights in the James Bond novels. He was the literary consultant and chairman of Ian Fleming Publications until 2001. Today, the Fleming family-owned Ian Fleming Publications administers all Fleming&#x27;s literary works.

==Publication history==
After Fleming&#x27;s death in 1964, the estate either commissioned or permitted new Bond works to be published. In 1968, Kingsley Amis published &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Robert Markham&quot;. The company changed its name from Glidrose Productions to Glidrose Publications. In 1973, Glidrose sanctioned &quot;James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007&quot; by John Pearson. In 1977 and again in 1979, Eon Productions authorized Christopher Wood to write novelisations of his scripts for the Bond films &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot; and &quot;Moonraker&quot;.

In 1981 the James Bond book series was revived, with new novels written by John Gardner. After writing 14 Bond books, John Gardner retired in 1996, and Raymond Benson, controversially at first, the first American to write a James Bond novel, replaced him. It was during Benson&#x27;s six-book run that the company owning the rights to the Bond characters changed names from Glidrose Publications to Ian Fleming Publications; the publisher&#x27;s new name appeared first in the 1999 book &quot;High Time to Kill&quot;. Benson stopped writing Bond books in 2002. On what would have been Fleming&#x27;s 100th birthday—28 May 2008—the novel &quot;Devil May Care&quot;, appeared. Its author, Sebastian Faulks, was true to Bond&#x27;s original character and background and provided &#x27;a Flemingesque hero&#x27; who drove a battleship grey 1967 T-series Bentley. Next, Ian Fleming Publications commissioned Jeffery Deaver to write &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;, which was published in May 2011. In April 2012, the company announced that William Boyd would write the next Bond novel and Jonathan Cape in the UK and HarperCollins in Canada and the US published &quot;Solo&quot; in 2013. Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Trigger Mortis&quot; appeared in September 2015.

Between 2005 and 2008, Ian Fleming Publications has supported the publication of Charlie Higson&#x27;s five &quot;Young Bond&quot; novels telling the adventures of a teenage James Bond in the 1930s. In 2005 the company launched another series of Bond-related spin-off books, &quot;The Moneypenny Diaries&quot; by Samantha Weinberg, writing as &#x27;Kate Westbrook&#x27;. Young Bond returned in 2013 with &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; by Steve Cole.

In a controversial move in 2023, the James Bond novels were rewritten to remove references deemed offensive following a sensitivity review commissioned by the company. Some depictions of Black people were removed, while a reference to the &quot;sweet tang of rape,&quot; a description of homosexuality as a &quot;disability,&quot; and mockery of East Asian people were allowed to remain.

<text>Buckland Newton is a village and civil parish in Dorset, England. It is situated beneath the scarp slope of the Dorset Downs, south of Sherborne. In the 2011 census the civil parish had a population of 622. The village covers around 6000 acres.

The village lies within the Buckland Newton Hundred. Amenities in the village include a pub (The Gaggle of Geese), shop, primary school and village hall.

Approximately three quarters of the parish lies within the Dorset National Landscape area.

==History==
The name &#x27;Buckland&#x27; derives from &quot;bōc-land&quot;, Old English for &#x27;charter land&#x27; or land with special privileges created by royal diploma, while &#x27;Newton&#x27; is a more recent addition taken from Sturminster Newton, a nearby town.

Evidence for prehistoric settlement comes from Bronze Age barrows at Gales Hill and the Iron Age hill fort of Dungeon Hill.

The parish originally had five settlements, each with their own open field system: Buckland Newton, Brockhampton, Duntish, Henley (perhaps previously known as Knoll) and Minterne Parva, the last now part of Minterne Magna parish. Farms based on small mediaeval enclosures include Chaston Farm, Revels Farm, and possibly Bookham.

Although the Parish Church of the Holy Rood was restored in the 19th century, it has a 13th-century chancel and 15th-century nave, west tower and aisles, plus fragments of 12th-century sculpture which are evidence of an earlier structure. In 1980 the writer and literary director Roland Gant described Holy Rood as &quot;a lovely church&quot;, but that the first impression it created was not favourable due to its exterior having been rendered in cement, &quot;giving the Perpendicular square tower the look of a Foreign Legion fort&quot;. The church has six bells, the oldest having been cast around 1380.

Duntish Court, sited about north of the main village, was a compact, classical country house built in 1764 beside the main Weymouth to Bath turnpike road. Designed by Sir William Chambers for Fitzwalter Foy, the Court — originally named Castle Hill — had notable plasterwork, grounds of and played a role in the arrest of agricultural labourers in Dorset&#x27;s &#x27;Captain Swing&#x27; riots of 1830. It was demolished in 1965.

==Geography==
Prominent nearby hills at the top of the escarpment to the southeast include the Ball Hill and the Lyscombe Hill near the Dorsetshire Gap.
The southern part of the parish is mainly chalk with an elevation ranging from . The northern lies between above sea-level and is mainly clay with Gault and Corallian Limestone beds.

The River Lydden rises in the numerous springs round the village, principally Buckland Bottom and Bladeley Bottom 

There are 11 locally recognised Sites of Nature Conservation Interest within or close to the parish, as well as areas of Ancient Woodland. The main habitat types for sites of wildlife interest are deciduous woodland and calcareous grassland (the latter is particularly significant for butterflies). There is also a small area of lowland meadows within Buckland Newton Itself.

<text>San Andrés () is the capital city of the department of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina, or The Raizal Islands, in Colombia. As of 2005 its population was 55,426.

==Overview==
It is situated at the north end of San Andrés Island, on the Caribbean Sea, with the runway of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla International Airport bisecting the western urban portion area clustering the cape of Punta Norte from the Eastern portion of the urban area. The population is considered to be about 20% Raizals and 80% mainland Colombians. The economy is mainly sustained by tourism and commercial fishing. Once a duty-free port, it still has a relatively vigorous shopping district selling various consumer goods at bargain prices, including Colombian gold and emerald jewellery, leather goods and other distinctively Colombian wares.

San Andrés has become such a byword for bargain shopping in Colombia that many towns and cities have a bargain shopping area known as a San Andresito (&quot;little San Andres&quot;).

<text>Burstock is a village and civil parish in west Dorset, England, south of Crewkerne. In the 2011 census the parish had 59 dwellings, 49 households and a population of 120.

In 1086 Burstock was recorded in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Bureuuinestoch&#x27;, meaning a farm (&#x27;stoc&#x27;) owned by either &#x27;Burgwine&#x27; (a man) or &#x27;Burgwynn&#x27; (a woman). It had 12 households, 8 acres of meadow and 3 ploughlands. It was in Whitchurch Canonicorum Hundred, the lord was William Malbank and the tenant-in-chief was Earl Hugh of Chester.

Before the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the mid 16th century, Burstock was closely associated with the Cistercian monks at nearby Forde Abbey; at Whetham, in the north of the parish, the abbey developed a mill, and in 1316 the Abbot became Burstock&#x27;s lord of the manor.

<doc id="1071725" wikidata="Q2566185" url="?curid=1071725" title="Rathdowney">
<text>Rathdowney or Rathdowny () is a town in southwest County Laois, Ireland. It lies some 32 km southwest of Portlaoise in the Irish Midlands, at the point where the R433 regional road from Abbeyleix to Templemore is crossed by the R435 from Borris-in-Ossory to Johnstown. The R433 provides access for Rathdowney to the Dublin-Cork M8 motorway, while the R435 links the town to the Dublin-Limerick M7. As of the 2016 census, the population of Rathdowney was 1,271. The town is in a townland and civil parish of the same name.

==History==
Rathdowney is named after a nearby ringfort, or &quot;ráth&quot;, which was levelled in 1830. This ráth is mentioned three times in the Annals of the Four Masters:

* 874 Flaithri, son of Máel Dúin, Lord of Rath-Tamhnaighe (Rathdowney) died
* 909 Maelpadraig, son of Flaithri, Lord of Rath-Tamhnaighe, died
* 1069 Gillamoula, grandson of Bruaideadh, Lord of Rath-Tamhnaighe

The settlement of Rathdowney has existed since at least the 9th century. Historically it forms part of the Kingdom of Osraige, and today it remains part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ossory, as such Rathdowney is not historically part of Laois. The present-day county of Laois is a modern administrative construct. A half mile southeast of Rathdowney, there stood until 1836, the ruins of a castle called Rathpiper, which most probably took its name from &quot;Pipard&quot;, a descendant of Adam de Hereford. This locality of &quot;Pyperath&quot; within Rathdowny parish appears to have been a royal site associated with the medieval Mac Giolla Phádraig dynasty, as documents relating to meeting there in 1558 show.

The Croppy&#x27;s Grave located in the town&#x27;s central square is the still visible cobbled grave of a croppy revolutionary hanged and buried there in 1798. The site also contains a recent memorial.

The town was raided at least once by anti-treaty forces during the Irish Civil War of 1922 to 1923.

Queen Victoria passed through Rathdowney during her first visit to Ireland in 1849 and in a letter to her maternal sibling Princess Feodora of Leiningen about the visit to Ireland she described passing through a town assumed to be Rathdowney by historians as &quot;a quaint village, surrounded by hills&quot; and went on to describe it as &quot;an idyllic small town&quot;.

==Churches==
Saint Andrew&#x27;s Church of Ireland church, which overlooks the town&#x27;s square, was built in the early 19th century. It stands on the traditional site of the pre-Reformation church. A Roman Catholic church was constructed on the main street in the 1830s, and this church served the Catholic population of the area for the next 120 years before it too was demolished; to be replaced by a shrine and carpark. A new larger Catholic church, the Church of the Holy Trinity, was designed by Simon Aloysius Leonard and built on the west side of the town in the 1950s.

There are a number of &quot;mass pits&quot; (outdoor areas used for Catholic masses during penal times) located in the vicinity of the town.

==Economy==
The Meadow Meats processing plant is part of the Dawn Meats Group and was the largest employer in the town. This factory stands on the old Perry&#x27;s Brewery site, it was purchased by Lyons Meats in 1968 and converted by them to a meat processing facility, which went into production in 1971. Rathdowney is also something of a centre for several out lying villages and is a focal point for the surrounding agricultural hinterland.

==People==
* Tony Byrne, international footballer.
* Ned Campion, international showjumper.
* Kieran Patrick Kelly, suspected serial killer.
* Edward Ledwich, historian, antiquary and topographer, was curate in Rathdowney for a time.
* John Moyney, an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, was born in Rathdowney.
* James Pearson, also a Victoria Cross recipient from Rathdowney.
* Kieran Phelan, Irish politician, member of Seanad 2002–2010.
* Thomas Prior, author and founder of the Royal Dublin Society.

<doc id="1071729" wikidata="Q464835" url="?curid=1071729" title="Padma Lakshmi">
<text>Padma Parvati Lakshmi (; née Vaidynathan; born September 1, 1970) is an American television personality, model, and author. She hosted the cooking competition program &quot;Top Chef&quot; on Bravo continuously from 2006 to 2023. She is the creator, host, and executive producer of the docuseries &quot;Taste the Nation with Padma Lakshmi&quot;, which premiered in June 2020 on Hulu. The series covers the food and culture of immigrant and indigenous communities across America. For her work with these two series, as an executive producer and as a host, she has received 16 Primetime Emmy nominations. 

Born in India, Lakshmi immigrated to the United States as a child. She became a model before embarking on a career in television. She has written five books: two cookbooks, &quot;Easy Exotic&quot; and &quot;Tangy, Tart, Hot &amp; Sweet&quot;; an encyclopedia, &quot;The Encyclopedia of Spices &amp; Herbs: An Essential Guide to the Flavors of the World&quot;; a memoir, &quot;Love, Loss, and What We Ate&quot;; and a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Tomatoes for Neela&quot; illustrated by Juana Martinez-Neal, the latter two appearing on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list. Lakshmi has formed and produced sales for five different businesses. In 2023, she was listed among &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s 100 most influential people in the world, was a co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America, and is a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador.

==Early life and education==
Padma Parvati Lakshmi Vaidynathan was born on September 1, 1970, in Madras (now Chennai), India. Her mother, Vijaya Lakshmi, is a retired oncology nurse. Lakshmi&#x27;s parents divorced when she was two years old.

Lakshmi immigrated to the United States at the age of four and lived in New York City before moving to La Puente, California, with her mother and stepfather. She has stated that, as a teenager, she was bullied due to her Indian heritage, which caused her to struggle to overcome &quot;internalized self-loathing.&quot;

At the age of 14, Lakshmi was hospitalized for three weeks and eventually diagnosed with Stevens–Johnson syndrome, a rare illness caused by hypersensitivity to an infection or a potentially fatal reaction to certain kinds of medications.

Two days after her discharge from the hospital, she was injured in a car accident in Malibu, California, which left her with a fractured right hip and a shattered right upper arm. The arm injury required surgery, from which she retained a seven-inch scar between her elbow and shoulder.

Lakshmi graduated from William Workman High School in City of Industry, California, in 1988. In 1992, she graduated from Clark University, earning a Bachelor’s Degree in Theatre Arts and American Literature.

In a 2018 essay for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lakshmi revealed that, at the age of 16, she was raped by her then boyfriend, which she did not report. Lakshmi stated that her decision to keep silent about the rape resulted from her stepfather&#x27;s relative assaulting her when she was seven years old. After she told her mother and stepfather about his assault, they sent her to live with her grandparents for a year. Lakshmi wrote, &quot;The lesson was: If you speak up, you will be cast out.&quot; She said, &quot;I am speaking now because I want us all to fight so that our daughters never know this fear and shame and our sons know that girls&#x27; bodies do not exist for their pleasure and that abuse has grave consequences.&quot; When she became a naturalized US citizen, Lakshmi officially changed her name to simply Padma Parvati Lakshmi to honor her mother.

==Career==
===Modeling===
In effect, Lakshmi began her modeling career at age 21, when a modeling agent discovered Lakshmi while she was studying in Madrid. She has said, &quot;I was the first Indian model to have a career in Paris, Milan, and New York. I&#x27;m the first one to admit that I was a novelty.&quot; Lakshmi was able to pay off her college loans by working as a model and actress.

=== Activism ===
Lakshmi is known as an advocate for immigrant rights, the independent restaurant industry, and women&#x27;s rights.

Lakshmi is the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ambassador for immigration and women&#x27;s rights. She has also been a critic of skin-lightening creams marketed to people of color. She has also spoken about the colorism she has experienced while living in India and the United States.

Lakshmi was appointed United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador on March 7, 2019. &quot;My main mission as UNDP Goodwill Ambassador is to shine a spotlight on the fact that inequality can affect people in rich and poor countries alike. Many nations have greatly reduced poverty, but inequality has proved more stubborn,&quot; said Lakshmi. &quot;Inequality is further compounded by gender, age, ethnicity, and race. It especially affects women, minorities, and others who face unimaginable discrimination in the societies in which they live.&quot; In December 2021, she received the Advocate of the Year Award by the United Nations Correspondents Association (UNCA). In October 2022, Lakshmi was honored at the 20th edition of the ACLU&#x27;s Sing Out For Freedom benefit concert along with Patti Smith and Shaina Taub.

<doc id="1071730" wikidata="Q3413403" url="?curid=1071730" title="Hyperbolic quaternion">
<text>In abstract algebra, the algebra of hyperbolic quaternions is a nonassociative algebra over the real numbers with elements of the form
:formula_1
where the squares of i, j, and k are +1 and distinct elements of {i, j, k} multiply with the anti-commutative property.

The four-dimensional algebra of hyperbolic quaternions incorporates some of the features of the older and larger algebra of biquaternions. They both contain subalgebras isomorphic to the split-complex number plane. Furthermore, just as the quaternion algebra H can be viewed as a union of complex planes, so the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is a pencil of planes of split-complex numbers sharing the same real line.

It was Alexander Macfarlane who promoted this concept in the 1890s as his &quot;Algebra of Physics&quot;, first through the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1891, then through his 1894 book of five &quot;Papers in Space Analysis&quot;, and in a series of lectures at Lehigh University in 1900.

==Algebraic structure==
Like the quaternions, the set of hyperbolic quaternions form a vector space over the real numbers of dimension 4. A linear combination

:formula_2

is a hyperbolic quaternion when formula_3 and formula_4 are real numbers and the basis set formula_5 has these products:

:formula_6
:formula_7
:formula_8
:formula_9

Using the distributive property, these relations can be used to multiply any two hyperbolic quaternions.

Unlike the ordinary quaternions, the hyperbolic quaternions are not associative. For example, formula_10, while formula_11. In fact, this example shows that the hyperbolic quaternions are not even an alternative algebra.

The first three relations show that products of the (non-real) basis elements are anti-commutative. Although this basis set does not form a group, the set

:formula_12

forms a loop, that is, a quasigroup with an identity element. One also notes that any subplane of the set &quot;M&quot; of hyperbolic quaternions that contains the real axis forms a plane of split-complex numbers. If

:formula_13

is the conjugate of formula_14, then the product

:formula_15

is the quadratic form used in spacetime theory. In fact, for events &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, the bilinear form 
: formula_16
arises as the negative of the real part of the hyperbolic quaternion product &quot;pq&quot;*, and is used in Minkowski space.

Note that the set of units U = {&quot;q&quot; : &quot;qq&quot;* ≠ 0 } is &quot;not&quot; closed under multiplication. See the references (external link) for details.

==Discussion==

The hyperbolic quaternions form a nonassociative ring; the failure of associativity in this algebra curtails the facility of this algebra in transformation theory. Nevertheless, 
this algebra put a focus on analytical kinematics by suggesting a mathematical model:
When one selects a unit vector &quot;r&quot; in the hyperbolic quaternions, then &quot;r&quot; 2 = +1. The plane formula_17 with hyperbolic quaternion multiplication is a commutative and associative subalgebra isomorphic to the split-complex number plane.
The hyperbolic versor formula_18 transforms Dr by
:formula_19
Since the direction &quot;r&quot; in space is arbitrary, this hyperbolic quaternion multiplication can express any Lorentz boost using the parameter &quot;a&quot; called rapidity. However, the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is deficient for representing the full Lorentz group (see biquaternion instead).

Writing in 1967 about the dialogue on vector methods in the 1890s, historian Michael J. Crowe commented
:&quot;The introduction of another system of vector analysis, even a sort of compromise system such as Macfarlane&#x27;s, could scarcely be well received by the advocates of the already existing systems and moreover probably acted to broaden the question beyond the comprehension of the as-yet uninitiated reader.&quot;

==Geometry==
Later, Macfarlane published an article in the &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot; in 1900. In it he treats a model for hyperbolic space H3 on the hyperboloid

:formula_20

This isotropic model is called the hyperboloid model and consists of all the hyperbolic versors in the ring of hyperbolic quaternions.

==Historical review==
The 1890s felt the influence of the posthumous publications of W. K. Clifford and the &quot;continuous groups&quot; of Sophus Lie. An example of a one-parameter group is the hyperbolic versor with the hyperbolic angle parameter. This parameter is part of the polar decomposition of a split-complex number. But it is a startling aspect of finite mathematics that makes the hyperbolic quaternion ring different:

The basis formula_21 of the vector space of hyperbolic quaternions is not closed under multiplication: for example, formula_22. Nevertheless, the set formula_23 is closed under multiplication. It satisfies all the properties of an abstract group except the associativity property; being finite, it is a Latin square or quasigroup, a peripheral mathematical structure. Loss of the associativity property of multiplication as found in quasigroup theory is not consistent with linear algebra since all linear transformations compose in an associative manner. Yet physical scientists were calling in the 1890s for mutation of the squares of formula_24,formula_25, and formula_26 to be formula_27 instead of formula_28 :
The Yale University physicist Willard Gibbs had pamphlets with the plus one square in his three-dimensional vector system. Oliver Heaviside in England wrote columns in the &quot;Electrician&quot;, a trade paper, advocating the positive square. In 1892 he brought his work together in &quot;Transactions of the Royal Society A&quot; where he says his vector system is
:simply the elements of Quaternions without quaternions, with the notation simplified to the uttermost, and with the very inconvenient &quot;minus&quot; sign before scalar product done away with.

So the appearance of Macfarlane&#x27;s hyperbolic quaternions had some motivation, but the disagreeable non-associativity precipitated a reaction. Cargill Gilston Knott was moved to offer the following:

Theorem (Knott 1892)
:If a 4-algebra on basis formula_21 is associative and off-diagonal products are given by Hamilton&#x27;s rules, then formula_30.

Proof:
:formula_31, so formula_32. Cycle the letters formula_24, formula_25, formula_26 to obtain formula_36. &quot;QED&quot;.

This theorem needed statement to justify resistance to the call of the physicists and the &quot;Electrician&quot;. The quasigroup stimulated a considerable stir in the 1890s: the journal &quot;Nature&quot; was especially conducive to an exhibit of what was known by giving two digests of Knott&#x27;s work as well as those of several other vector theorists. Michael J. Crowe devotes chapter six of his book &quot;A History of Vector Analysis&quot; to the various published views, and notes the hyperbolic quaternion:

:&quot;Macfarlane constructed a new system of vector analysis more in harmony with Gibbs–Heaviside system than with the quaternion system. ...he...defined a full product of two vectors which was comparable to the full quaternion product except that the scalar part was positive, not negative as in the older system.&quot;

In 1899 Charles Jasper Joly noted the hyperbolic quaternion and the non-associativity property while ascribing its origin to Oliver Heaviside.

The hyperbolic quaternions, as the &quot;Algebra of Physics&quot;, undercut the claim that ordinary quaternions made on physics. As for mathematics, the hyperbolic quaternion is another hypercomplex number, as such structures were called at the time. By the 1890s Richard Dedekind had introduced the ring concept into commutative algebra, and the vector space concept was being abstracted by Giuseppe Peano. In 1899 Alfred North Whitehead promoted Universal algebra, advocating for inclusivity. The concepts of quasigroup and algebra over a field are examples of mathematical structures describing hyperbolic quaternions.

==Macfarlane&#x27;s hyperbolic quaternion paper of 1900==
The &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh&quot; published &quot;Hyperbolic Quaternions&quot; 
in 1900, a paper in which Macfarlane regains associativity for multiplication by reverting 
to complexified quaternions. While there he used some expressions later 
made famous by Wolfgang Pauli: where Macfarlane wrote
:formula_37 
:formula_38
:formula_39
the Pauli matrices satisfy
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42
while referring to the same complexified quaternions.

The opening sentence of the paper is &quot;It is well known that quaternions are intimately connected with spherical trigonometry and in fact they reduce the subject to a branch of algebra.&quot; This statement may be verified by reference to the contemporary work &quot;Vector Analysis&quot; which works with a reduced quaternion system based on dot product and cross product. In Macfarlane&#x27;s paper there is an effort to produce &quot;trigonometry on the surface of the equilateral hyperboloids&quot; through the algebra of hyperbolic quaternions, now re-identified in an associative ring of eight real dimensions. The effort is reinforced by a plate of nine figures on page 181. They illustrate the descriptive power of his &quot;space analysis&quot; method. For example, figure 7 is the 
common Minkowski diagram used today in special relativity to discuss change of velocity of a frame of reference and relativity of simultaneity.

On page 173 Macfarlane expands on his greater theory of quaternion variables. By way of contrast he notes that Felix Klein appears not to look beyond the theory of Quaternions and spatial rotation.

<doc id="1071756" wikidata="Q171141" url="?curid=1071756" title="Gastronomy">
<text>Gastronomy is the study of the relationship between food and culture, the art of preparing and serving rich or delicate and appetizing food, the cooking styles of particular regions, and the science of good eating. One who is well versed in gastronomy is called a gastronome, while a gastronomist is one who unites theory and practice in the study of gastronomy. Practical gastronomy is associated with the practice and study of the preparation, production, and service of the various foods and beverages, from countries around the world. It is related with a system and process approach, focused on recipes, techniques and cookery books. Food gastronomy is connected with food and beverages and their genesis. Technical gastronomy underpins practical gastronomy, introducing a rigorous approach to evaluation of gastronomic topics.

==Etymology==
Archestratus wrote a guide to the foods of the Mediterranean in the form of a poem called &quot;Gastronomy&quot;, according to Chrysippus of Tyana; only fragmentary quotations remain. The word is a compound of Greek &#x27;stomach&#x27; and lit. &#x27;custom&#x27;, modeled on &#x27;astronomy&#x27;. It was revived in 1801 as the title of a poem by . It was Brillat-Savarin, in his &quot;Physiologie du goût&quot; (1825) who systematized the study of food and cooking under this name.

== History ==
Gastronomy involves discovering, tasting, experiencing, researching, understanding and writing about food preparation and the sensory qualities of human nutrition as a whole. It also studies how nutrition interfaces with the broader culture. The biological and chemical basis of cooking has become known as molecular gastronomy, while gastronomy covers a much broader, interdisciplinary ground.
Pascal Ory, a French historian, defines gastronomy as the establishment of rules of eating and drinking, an &quot;art of the table&quot;, and distinguishes it from good cooking () or fine cooking (). Ory traces the origins of gastronomy back to the French reign of Louis XIV when people took interest in developing rules to discriminate between good and bad style and extended their thinking to define good culinary taste. The lavish and sophisticated cuisine and practices of the French court became the culinary model for the French. Alexandre Grimod de La Reynière wrote the gastronomic work (1803), elevating the status of food discourse to a disciplined level based on his views of French tradition and morals. Grimod aimed to reestablish order lost after the revolution and institute gastronomy as a serious subject in France. Grimod expanded gastronomic literature to the three forms of the genre: the guidebook, the gastronomic treatise, and the gourmet periodical. The invention of gastronomic literature coincided with important cultural transformations in France that increased the relevance of the subject. The end of nobility in France changed how people consumed food; fewer wealthy households employed cooks and the new bourgeoisie class wanted to assert their status by consuming elitist food. The emergence of the restaurant satisfied these social needs and provided good food available for popular consumption. The center of culinary excellence in France shifted from Versailles to Paris, a city with a competitive and innovative culinary culture. The culinary commentary of Grimod and other gastronomes influenced the tastes and expectations of consumers in an unprecedented manner as a third party to the consumer-chef interaction.

The French origins of gastronomy explain the widespread use of French terminology in gastronomic literature. Pascal Ory criticizes this literature as conceptually vague; relying heavily on anecdotal evidence; and using confusing, poorly defined terminology. Nevertheless, gastronomy has grown from a marginalized subject in France to a serious and popular interest worldwide.

The derivative &quot;gourmet&quot; has come into use since the publication of &quot;Physiology of Taste&quot; () an 1825 cooking treatise by Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, a lawyer and politician who aimed to define classic French cuisine. While the work contains some flamboyant recipes, it goes into the theory of preparation of French dishes and hospitality. According to Brillat-Savarin: &quot;Gastronomy is the knowledge and understanding of all that relates to man as he eats. Its purpose is to ensure the conservation of men, using the best food possible.&quot;

==Writings on gastronomy==
Many writings on gastronomy throughout the world capture the thoughts and aesthetics of a culture&#x27;s cuisine during a period in their history. Some works continue to define or influence the contemporary gastronomic thought and cuisine of their respective cultures.

Some additional historical examples:
* or (&quot;On the Subject of Cooking&quot;): A 1st-to-5th-century collection of ancient Roman recipes, often attributed (without clear evidence) to the gourmet Marcus Gavius Apicius, it contains instructions for preparing dishes enjoyed by the elite of the time. A new English translation was published in 2009 as &quot;Cookery and Dining in Imperial Rome&quot;.
* (, &quot;The Way of Eating&quot;, also known in English as &quot;Recipes from the Garden of Contentment&quot;): An 18th-century manual on Chinese cuisine of Qing dynasty by the poet Yuan Mei, it contains recipes from different social classes at the time along with two chapters on Chinese gastronomic and culinary theory. The first translation into English was completed in 2017.

<text>Wagon Train is an American Western television series that aired for eight seasons, first on the NBC television network (1957–1962) and then on ABC (1962–1965). &quot;Wagon Train&quot; debuted on September 18, 1957 and reached the top of the Nielsen ratings. It is the fictional adventure story of a large westbound wagon train through the American frontier from Missouri to California. Its format attracted famous guest stars for each episode appearing as travelers or residents of the settlements that the regular cast encountered. 

The show initially starred film actor Ward Bond as the wagon master (replaced after his death in 1960 by John McIntire) and Robert Horton as the scout (eventually replaced by Robert Fuller).

The series was inspired by the 1950 film &quot;Wagon Master&quot; and the 1930 early widescreen film &quot;The Big Trail&quot;, both featuring Bond. The series influenced the development of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, pitched as &quot;&quot;Wagon Train&quot; to the stars&quot; and launched in 1966.

==Overview==


The series chronicles the adventures of a wagon train from St. Joseph, Missouri, across the plains of the Midwestern United States and the Rocky Mountains to Sacramento, California. It features the trials of the series regulars, who conducted the train through the American West.

Episodes revolve around the stories of guest characters portraying members of the massive wagon train or encountered by it. Many starring roles were played by already famous actors such as Ernest Borgnine, Bette Davis, Jane Wyman, Ronald Reagan, Lee Marvin, and Joseph Cotten. Episode titles routinely emphasize the guest characters, such as &quot;The Willy Moran Story&quot; and &quot;The Echo Pass Story&quot;.

As a favor to Ward Bond, film director John Ford joined the show to direct a 1960 segment titled &quot;The Colter Craven Story&quot;, which includes many members of the &quot;John Ford Stock Company&quot;, momentarily featuring John Wayne speaking from the shadows and billed in the credits as &quot;Michael Morris&quot;.

==Cast==
The regular cast includes:
*Ward Bond as wagon master Major Seth Adams (1957–61, seasons 1–4). Bond died of a heart attack in the middle of the fourth season, and was replaced by John McIntire as wagon master. No explanation was ever given on the show.
*Robert Horton as scout Flint McCullough (1957–62, seasons 1–5).
*John McIntire as Christopher Hale (1961–65, seasons 4–8), replacing Bond as wagon master upon Bond&#x27;s death. McIntire had guest starred in a Season 3 episode in the role of preacher Andrew Hale, apparently Christopher&#x27;s brother according to a reference made by Christopher later in the series.
*Robert Fuller as scout Cooper Smith (1963–65, seasons 7–8) replacing the McCullough character after Robert Horton left the series. Fuller had previously played a lead in the Western series &quot;Laramie&quot; and physically resembled Horton. Fuller and McIntire rotated top billing from week to week on the series. Fuller even shared the same birthday as Horton, albeit nine years apart.
*Frank McGrath as cook Charlie Wooster (1957–65, seasons 1–8), one of only two regulars to last the entire series.
*Terry Wilson as Bill Hawks (1957–65, seasons 1–8), was one of only two regulars to last the entire series.
*Michael Burns as Barnaby West (1960–65, seasons 6–8).
*Scott Miller (aka; Denny Miller) as Duke Shannon (1961–64, seasons 4–7).
*Chick Hannan in various roles (1957–65, seasons 1–8), mostly as a wagon train member.

In the first four seasons Ward Bond was billed above Robert Horton in the opening credits. In season five Horton rotated top billing with relative newcomer John McIntire, a practice which subsequently continued with McIntire and Robert Fuller rotating top billing from episode to episode when Fuller joined the series in the seventh season.

During the sixth season, Horton had left and Fuller had not yet replaced him, so McIntire carried the show with the supporting cast. Neither Bond nor McIntire, both veterans of dozens of supporting roles in movies, routinely had a leading role in theatrical films, although Bond did in at least one B-picture. Rivals Bond and Horton frequently quarreled on the set, an extensively publicized development at the time, while their characters disputed within the episodes. According to Scott Eyman in his biography of John Wayne, Bond&#x27;s jealousy of Horton was fueled by Horton receiving more fan mail. Eyman stated Bond would try to limit Horton&#x27;s screen time and interfere with any good lines Horton might be given in the scripts. They eventually reconciled shortly before Bond&#x27;s death.

==Episodes==

== Production ==

=== Development ===
Taking inspiration from John Ford&#x27;s 1950 film &quot;Wagon Master&quot;, Revue Productions conceived of a semi-anthology series with an emphasis on strong storytelling and quality direction with weekly guest stars known for their work in motion pictures and other media but retaining a regular cast of characters to provide a touchstone for audiences.

At an initial budget of per segment, &quot;Wagon Train&quot; episodes cost over 40% more than most contemporary hour-long Westerns, allowing it to film on location in California&#x27;s San Fernando Valley and afford its expensive guest stars.

=== Theme music ===
The first season theme &quot;Wagon Train&quot; was written by Henri René and Bob Russell, and lyrics were not used. The theme was conducted by Revue musical director Stanley Wilson. In the second season, a new more modern sounding theme was introduced. &quot;(Roll Along) Wagon Train&quot; was written by Sammy Fain and Jack Brooks and sung by Johnny O&#x27;Neill. About midway through the second season this was replaced with an instrumental version by Stanley Wilson. In the third season a more traditional sounding score was introduced. &quot;Wagons Ho!&quot; was written and conducted by Jerome Moross, who adapted it from a passage of music he had written for the 1959 film &quot;The Jayhawkers&quot;. This theme would last through the series&#x27;s run and is the most remembered &quot;Wagon Train&quot; theme. Stanley Wilson re-recorded &quot;Wagons Ho!&quot; when the series was broadcast in color in 1963, then an abbreviated version of the 1963 re-recorded theme was used for the final season when it returned to black-and-white. 

== Release ==
=== Original broadcast ===
The show ran for 284 episodes over 8 seasons: the first aired on September 18, 1957, and the final segment was broadcast on May 2, 1965.

The series aired for most of its run as hour-long episodes in black-and-white except for five episodes during the 1961-62 season which were produced and broadcast in color to promote NBC&#x27;s parent company RCA&#x27;s color television sets. After its move to ABC the show mirrored &quot;The Virginian&quot; on NBC by filming in color and expanding to 90 minutes. In its final and eighth season and due to declining ratings, the show returned to its hour format and was filmed in black and white.

===Syndication===
When the original Ward Bond episodes were broadcast weekday afternoons on ABC beginning in 1963, a new series title &quot;Seth Adams Trailmaster&quot; was given to the episode to avoid viewer confusion because &quot;Wagon Train&quot; was still on the ABC evening schedule. A new theme song, the &quot;Trailmaster Theme&quot;, written and conducted by Stanley Wilson, was used for these syndicated episodes. The later episodes from the John McIntire era were syndicated under the simpler title &quot;Trailmaster.&quot; All episodes eventually reverted to their original titling after the series left the air. The 75-minute episodes were usually syndicated separately, sometimes shown on local stations as &quot;movies.&quot;

One episode very seldom shown is &quot;Princess of the Lost Tribe&quot; (season 4 episode 6, shown 6 Nov 1960), in which Flint McCullough happens upon the hiding place of descendants of the Aztec Indians - now moved up from central Mexico to the vicinity of Arizona, with Raymond Massey playing their king, Montezuma IX, speaking English with flawless educated diction.

===Home media===
In 2004, Alpha Video released three episodes of &quot;Wagon Train&quot; on DVD. Four years later Timeless Media Group released a DVD selection consisting of 12 episodes on three discs. Also in 2008, it released &quot;The Complete Color Season&quot;, a 16 disc box set with season seven and 16 select episodes from the other seasons. From 2010 to 2013, Timeless Media Group released the series in eight box sets of one season each, and the seventh season lacks the bonus episodes.

== Cultural influences ==
Gene Roddenberry said he pitched &quot;Star Trek&quot; as &quot;&quot;Wagon Train&quot; to the stars&quot;, referring to the concept of a recurring cast on a long journey with famous guest stars becoming the focus of various stories. In his March 11, 1964, initial pitch document, he wrote, &quot;&quot;Star Trek&quot; is a &quot;Wagon Train&quot; concept—built around characters who travel to worlds &#x27;similar&#x27; to our own.&quot;

<text>James William Denver (October 23, 1817 – August 9, 1892) was an American politician, soldier and lawyer. He served in the California state government, as an officer in the United States Army in two wars, and as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from California. He served as secretary and Governor of the Kansas Territory during the struggle over whether or not Kansas would be open to slavery. The city of Denver, Colorado, is named after him.

==Early life and career==

James W. Denver was born near Winchester, Virginia. His father was born in Ireland, while his mother was of English descent. He attended public schools and moved to Ohio with his parents in 1830, settling near Wilmington. In 1841 he taught school in Missouri, and in 1844 he graduated from the Cincinnati Law School. He was admitted to the bar and practiced law near Xenia, Ohio. He moved to Platte City, Missouri, in 1845, where he continued his law practice and acting career.

In 1847, during the Mexican–American War, he recruited a company for the 12th U.S. Volunteer Infantry and was commissioned a captain, serving under General Winfield Scott. After the war in 1850, Denver traveled to California, where he became a trader. Denver killed newspaper editor Edward Gilbert in a duel on August 2, 1852. Later that same year, he was elected to the California State Senate. He was later appointed as Secretary of State of California. In 1854 he was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from California, serving from March 4, 1855 – March 3, 1857. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1856. On April 17, 1857, President James Buchanan appointed him as Commissioner of Indian Affairs.

On June 17, 1857, Denver was appointed by Buchanan as Secretary of the Kansas Territory. In December 1857 he was appointed as Territorial Governor. On the day that Denver assumed the territorial governorship, citizens in the territory voted on the Lecompton Constitution, which opened the territory to slavery. The vote offered a choice only between full slavery and limited slavery in the territory and was thus largely boycotted by Free-Staters who were in favor of abolishing slavery. The pro-slavery constitution passed by an overwhelming margin. Later it was discovered that several thousand votes were cast fraudulently by &quot;Border Ruffians&quot; who had crossed into the territory from Missouri in order to cast pro-slavery ballots; this scandal became known as Bleeding Kansas. (The vote was overturned by a subsequent election in August 1858, and Kansas was later admitted to the Union, in 1861, as a free state.)

In November 1858, while Denver was still serving as territorial governor, William Larimer, Jr., a land speculator from Leavenworth, planted the townsite of &quot;Denver City&quot; along the South Platte River in Arapaho County in western Kansas Territory (the present-day state of Colorado). Larimer chose the name &quot;Denver&quot; to honor the current territorial governor with the intention that the city would be chosen as the county seat of Arapaho County.

Denver retired as territorial governor in November 1858, was reappointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and served until his resignation on March 31, 1859.

==Civil War and later career==
A few months after the start of the American Civil War in early 1861, President Abraham Lincoln commissioned Denver a brigadier general in the volunteer army on August 14. In November 1861, he was ordered to report to Fort Scott in Kansas and in December, he assumed command of all Federal troops in Kansas. During March and April 1862 he commanded the District of Kansas until he was transferred to the District of West Tennessee. On May 16, 1862, Denver assumed command of the 3rd Brigade/5th Division under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman in the midst of the Siege of Corinth. The very next day Denver&#x27;s brigade participated in the fight for Russell&#x27;s House. Though his brigade suffered no casualties in this engagement it was nonetheless one of the two brigades leading the attack. On May 27 General Sherman again selected Denver&#x27;s brigade to be one of the leading units in an attack against the Double Log House. Denver and Morgan L. Smith&#x27;s brigade successfully stormed the log cabin turned block house. During this engagement Major General Ulysses S. Grant was present on the battlefield and indicated his approval of the handsome manner in which the troops behaved. After the fall of Corinth Denver continued in command of his brigade, serving on garrison duty in Mississippi. During the early stages of the Vicksburg Campaign Denver was in command of the 1st Division, XVI Corps, until his resignation from the Union Army on March 5, 1863.

After the war, Denver practiced law in Washington, D.C., and Wilmington, Ohio; he and his family lived in the Rombach Place while residing in Wilmington. He served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1876, 1880, and 1884. He was mentioned as a possible Democratic presidential nominee in 1876 and 1884, although his name was never offered into formal nomination.

Denver reportedly visited Denver, Colorado, in 1875 and 1882, but complained that his visits received little affection from the residents of the city named after him.

He died in Washington, D.C., in 1892 and is buried in Sugar Grove Cemetery in Wilmington, Ohio.

His son, Matthew R. Denver, was a U.S. Congressman from Ohio from 1907 to 1913.

<text>Castleton is a civil parish in the English county of Dorset. The parish virtually encircles the town of Sherborne, and contains within its boundary both Sherborne Castle and Sherborne Old Castle. These and other buildings within the parish are today generally regarded as comprising part of Sherborne. The parish includes the hamlets of Wyke, Silverlake, Over Coombe, Higher Clatcombe, Dodds Cross, and Pinford. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 155.

Roman remains have been found at two sites in the parish: at Pinford Lane, in the east, and near Sandford Lane, in the north. The Pinford Lane site revealed the remains of buildings, an oven or kiln, coins, pottery, brooches and beads. The Sandford Lane site revealed more remains of buildings, coins and one brooch.

Most of the houses in the parish, but not the church, were pulled down when the railway was built through the town. Castleton shares a grouped parish council, Yeohead &amp; Castleton Parish Council, with the three village parishes of Poyntington, Goathill and Oborne.

The parish is currently in the Dorset County division of Sherborne Rural, and the Parliament constituency of West Dorset.

<text>Jill Jones (born July 11, 1962) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress, who performed as a backing vocalist for Teena Marie and Prince in the 1980s. She is best known for her various collaborative works with Prince in the 1980s and 1990s, including her self-titled debut album in 1987. Since 2001, she has released three acoustic and dance albums, with her most recent being 2016&#x27;s &quot;I Am&quot;. 

==Overview==
Jones was born in Lebanon, Ohio on July 11, 1962. Her mother, a fashion model, is of African American heritage, and her father, a jazz drummer, is Italian. Jones was raised mostly by her grandparents, until relocating to Los Angeles when her mother remarried. She began a singing career at age 15 as a backup vocalist for Teena Marie, whom her mother managed.

==Early music career==
Jones performed as backing vocalist on a number of Teena Marie&#x27;s Motown albums in the early 80s and also co-wrote the songs &quot;Young Girl In Love&quot; from &quot;Lady T&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Ballad of Cradle Rob and Me&quot; from &quot;It Must Be Magic&quot; (1981). She met Prince in 1980 at age 18, when Teena Marie was the opening act during his &quot;Dirty Mind&quot; tour. Prince loved her voice, encouraged her to sing, and stayed in touch with Jones.

She became a backup vocalist for Prince when he invited her to the Sunset Sound recording studios in 1982, to sing backing vocals for several tracks on the album &quot;1999&quot;. She was credited under just her initials J.J. She also was featured in music videos for the songs &quot;1999&quot; and &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot;, as well as extended rarely aired music video for &quot;Automatic&quot;, and then joined the tour for &quot;1999&quot; to sing backing vocals with the Prince side-project Vanity 6. After the tour, she moved to Minneapolis and became Prince&#x27;s on-and-off again girlfriend. She had a bit part as a waitress in the film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; (1984), and had an appearance in the sequel &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; (1990), where she takes off an undergarment to end a conflicting scene with Prince.

Her debut album was the self-titled &quot;Jill Jones&quot; (1987), released on Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park Records. Prince was credited as a co-writer with Jones, but wrote all of the songs himself. Lead single &quot;Mia Bocca&quot; became a top 10 hit in Italy in July 1987, peaking at #6. Upon its release, the album received positive reviews from critics, but was not a commercial success. As of 2007, the album has been out of print for many years.

Jones recorded numerous demo tracks in London in the late 1980s, including the tracks &quot;Deep Kiss&quot;, &quot;Unattainable Love&quot;, &quot;Long Time&quot;, &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;White Dogs&quot; &amp; &quot;Tango&quot;, among others. In 1989, she contributed a song (&quot;The Ground You Walk On&quot;) to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Earth Girls Are Easy&quot;.

Several demos were recorded for a second album on Paisley Park, and a video was filmed for the track &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, but an album never surfaced. In 1993, she released the dance single &quot;Bald&quot; on Flying Records.

Jones also did backing vocals for Apollonia 6 and recorded the Prince-written single &quot;G-Spot&quot;, which was remixed for a 12&quot; release by Blondie&#x27;s Jimmy Destri. She also sang lead vocals on Japanese artist Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s single &quot;You Do Me&quot; from his 1990 album &quot;Beauty&quot;. In addition, Jones wrote and co-produced the song &quot;The Great Pretender&quot; for Lisa Lisa. She was also lead vocalist for the band Baby Mother, who recorded an album in 1995 for London Records, which remains unreleased. In 1996, she toured performing co-lead vocals as part of Chic with Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards before Edwards&#x27; death, and can be heard on the 1999 Chic release&quot;Live at the Budokan&quot;.

The Prince song &quot;She&#x27;s Always in My Hair&quot;, a B-side to the single &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; (1985), was written about Jones.

Though Prince aided in the production of her first album, there was no input from Prince on the sessions for Jones&#x27; intended second album, which was more pop-rock oriented. From 2001 to the present, Jones has been performing acoustic rock as well as producing edgy and modern dance tracks.

She is also featured in the unreleased Vanity 6 song &quot;Vibrator&quot;. In this song, she does a skit in a department store where Vanity goes to get batteries for her vibrator. Prince is also in the skit.

==Solo career==
Jill provided vocals on a cover version of Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Why&quot; on Ronny Jordan&#x27;s album &quot;A Brighter Day&quot; in 2000 as well as contributing a cover version of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot; to a Giorgio Moroder tribute album. This was subsequently issued as a single with various remixes, including ones by Todd Terry and Mantronix.

With the help of former Paisley Park photographer and close friend David Honl, Jones released a second album entitled &quot;Two&quot; in 2001, with instrumentalist Chris Bruce. Jones performed lead vocals on the 2004 album &quot;Wasted,&quot; which was credited to The Grand Royals featuring Jill Jones. A collaboration with dance outfit Funky Junction resulted in the single &quot;Someone to Jump Up&quot;, which has appeared on various Hedkandi compilation releases.

In 2008, Jones joined a performance in New York by Jeremy Gloff, coming up on stage to sing with Gloff&#x27;s cover of her song &quot;So Much in Love&quot; On April 28, 2009, Jones released &quot;Living for the Weekend&quot; on the Peace Bisquit label. Although &quot;Wasted&quot; and &quot;Two&quot; are out of print, both albums can be found on the iTunes Store, along with &quot;Living for the Weekend&quot;.

2014 saw the release of the single &quot;This Is How It Feels&quot; with Italian techno act Get Far. In August 2015, Jones made the track &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; available via SoundCloud. This track is from her dance album, &quot;I Am&quot; released in February 2016 via Peace Bisquit. Currently, she maintains her own fan pages on Twitter and Facebook.

<text>The Tampa Bay Times, called the St. Petersburg Times until 2011, is an American newspaper published in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States. It is published by the Times Publishing Company, which is owned by The Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a nonprofit journalism school directly adjacent to the University of South Florida St. Petersburg campus.

It has won fourteen Pulitzer Prizes since 1964, and in 2009, won two in a single year for the first time in its history, one of which was for its PolitiFact project.

==History==

The newspaper traces its origins to the &quot;West Hillsborough Times&quot;, a weekly newspaper established in Dunedin, Florida, on the Pinellas Peninsula in 1884. At the time, neither St. Petersburg nor Pinellas County existed; the peninsula was part of Hillsborough County. The paper was published weekly in the back of a pharmacy and had a circulation of 480. It subsequently changed ownership six times in seventeen years. In December 1884, it was bought by A. C. Turner, who moved it to Clear Water Harbor (modern Clearwater, Florida). In 1892, it moved to St. Petersburg, and by 1898 it was officially renamed the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;.

The &quot;Times&quot; became bi-weekly in 1907, and began publication six days a week in 1912. Paul Poynter, a publisher originally from Indiana, bought the paper in September 1912 and converted to a seven-day paper, though it was rarely financially stable. Paul&#x27;s son, Nelson Poynter, became editor in 1939 and took majority control of the paper in 1947, and set about improving the paper&#x27;s finances and prestige. Nelson Poynter controlled the paper until his death in 1978, when he willed the majority of the stock to the non-profit Poynter Institute. In November 1986, the &quot;Evening Independent&quot; was merged into the &quot;Times&quot;. Poynter was succeeded as editor by Eugene Patterson (1978–1988), Andrew Barnes (1988–2004), Paul Tash (2004–2010; chair of the Times Publishing Company since 2004 and the Poynter Institute since 2007) Neil Brown (2010–2017), and Mark Katches (2018–present).

On January 1, 2012, the St. Petersburg Times was renamed the Tampa Bay Times; this stemmed from a 2006 decision of a lawsuit with Media General, at the time the publishers of the &quot;Times&quot;″ competing newspaper, &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, which allowed that paper to keep its exclusive right to use the name of its defunct sister paper, &quot;The Tampa Times&quot;, for five years after the decision.

As the newly rechristened &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, the paper&#x27;s weekday tabloid &quot;tbt*&quot;, a free daily publication and which used &quot;(* Tampa Bay Times)&quot; as its subtitle, became just &quot;tbt&quot; when the name change took place. The &quot;St. Pete Times&quot; name lives on as the name for the &quot;Times&quot;″ neighborhood news sections in southern Pinellas County (formerly &quot;Neighborhood Times&quot;), serving communities from Largo southward.

The &quot;Times&quot; has also done significant investigative reporting on the Church of Scientology, since the church&#x27;s acquisition of the Fort Harrison Hotel in 1975 and other holdings in Clearwater. The &quot;Times&quot; has published special reports and series critical of the church and its current leader, David Miscavige.

In 2010, the &quot;Times&quot; published an investigative report questioning the validity of the United States Navy Veterans Association, leading to significant reaction and official investigations into the group nationwide.

On May 3, 2016, the &quot;Times&quot; acquired its longtime competitor &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;, with the latter publication immediately ceasing publishing and &quot;Tribune&quot; features and some writers expected to be merged into the &quot;Times&quot;. As reported by other local media outlets in the Tampa Bay area at the time of this acquisition, for many years the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; was considered to be the more conservative newspaper in the region, while the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; was thought of as more liberal.

The &quot;Times&quot;″ purchase of &quot;The Tribune&quot; also allowed its circulation area to be expanded into Polk County, placing it in competition with other newspapers such as &quot;The Lakeland Ledger&quot; and &quot;The Polk County Democrat&quot;, as well as into the south central region of the state known as the Florida Heartland. In the case of the latter, the &quot;Times&quot; published &quot;Highlands Today&quot;, which was a daily news supplement of &quot;The Tribune&quot; for readers in Highlands County. The &quot;Times&quot; sold the paper in 2016 to Sun Coast Media Group.

In October 2019, the paper laid off seven newsroom employees.

The &quot;Times&quot; received $8.5 million in federal loans from the Paycheck Protection Program by July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. By this point, they had reduced delivery to two days per week. They had also cut 11 journalists&#x27; jobs through layoffs expected before the pandemic.

In August 2024, the paper announced it will eliminate 60 jobs, amounting to 20% of total staff.

On October 9-10, 2024, the Tampa Bay Times building was severely damaged during Hurricane Milton by a nearby construction crane that collapsed onto the building.

==PolitiFact.com==

The newspaper created PolitiFact.com, a project in which its reporters and editors &quot;fact-check statements by members of Congress, the White House, lobbyists and interest groups…&quot; They publish original statements and their evaluations on the PolitiFact.com website and assign each a &quot;Truth-O-Meter&quot; rating, with ratings ranging from &quot;True&quot; for completely true statements to &quot;Pants on Fire&quot; (from the taunt &quot;Liar, liar, pants on fire&quot;) for false and ridiculous statements. The site also includes an &quot;Obameter&quot;, tracking U.S. President Barack Obama&#x27;s performance with regard to his campaign promises. PolitiFact.com was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting in 2009 for &quot;its fact-checking initiative during the 2008 presidential campaign that used probing reporters and the power of the World Wide Web to examine more than 750 political claims, separating rhetoric from truth to enlighten voters.&quot; The &quot;Times&quot; sold PolitiFact.com to its parent company, the Poynter Institute, in 2018.

<doc id="1071774" wikidata="Q2149663" url="?curid=1071774" title="Richard Fulton">
<text>Richard Harmon Fulton (January 27, 1927 – November 28, 2018) was an American Democratic politician who served as a member of the Tennessee State Senate and of the United States House of Representatives, and the second mayor of the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County.

== Personal life ==
Fulton was born in Nashville, Tennessee. He graduated from East Nashville High School and served in the United States Navy in World War II. After returning from his military service, he entered the University of Tennessee where he played for the Volunteers on the football team. He died on November 28, 2018, at a hospice in Nashville at the age of 91.

==Political career ==
=== State Senate ===
In 1954, Fulton was elected to the Tennessee State Senate in place of his brother Lyle, who suddenly died from cancer shortly after receiving the Democratic nomination for that post. Fulton was sworn in on January 3, 1955, but because he was only 27, below the minimum age for Senators under the Tennessee State Constitution, the Senate voted unanimously (28–0) to unseat him. Fulton could not serve in the Senate until he was elected in 1956 at the age of 31. He was reelected to the Senate in 1958, then left politics to begin a career in real estate.

=== Congress ===
In 1962, he entered the Democratic primary for the Nashville-based 5th Congressional District against incumbent Congressman Joseph Carlton Loser. The election commission initially declared Loser the winner; however, a friend of Fulton successfully filed suit to throw out the primary results after &quot;The Tennessean&quot; reported corruption at the commission. In the rerun of the primary, Fulton defeated Loser and was victorious in November. Fulton voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. He resigned from the House after his election as mayor.

=== Mayor of Nashville ===
Fulton served three terms as mayor of Nashville, Tennessee from 1975 until 1987. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1978 and 1986. In 1999, he embarked on a comeback mayoral bid where he made it to the runoff election, but then withdrew and endorsed his opponent Bill Purcell.

During his tenure as mayor, Fulton was an influential voice in the development of key downtown streets, Riverfront Park, the Nashville Convention Center, the construction of Interstate 440, the expanded use of the Metro Development and Housing Agency and established of parks in the city.

From 1983 until 1984, Fulton served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

<doc id="1071782" wikidata="Q144574" url="?curid=1071782" title="Alaska State Senate">
<text>The Alaska State Senate is the upper house in the Alaska State Legislature, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Alaska. It convenes in the Alaska State Capitol in Juneau, Alaska and is responsible for making laws and confirming or rejecting gubernatorial appointments to the state cabinet, commissions and boards.

With just twenty members, the Alaska Senate is the smallest state legislative chamber in the United States. Its members serve four-year terms and each represent an equal number of districts with populations of approximately 35,512 people, per 2010 census figures. They are not subject to term limits.

==Powers and legislative process==
The Alaska Senate shares the responsibility for making laws in the state of Alaska with the Alaska House of Representatives. Bills are developed by staff from bill requests and information from the bill&#x27;s sponsor. Bills undergo three or four readings during the legislative process. After the first reading, they are assigned to committee. Committees can amend measures or hold legislation and prevent it from reaching the Senate floor. Once a committee has weighed in on a piece of legislation, the bill returns to the floor for second hearing and a third hearing, which happens just before the floor vote on it.

Once passed by the Senate, a bill is sent to the opposite legislative house for consideration. If approved, without amendment, it is sent to the governor. If there is amendment, however, the Senate may either reconsider the bill with amendments or ask for the establishment of a conference committee to work out differences in the versions of the bill passed by each chamber. Once a piece of legislation approved by both houses is forwarded to the governor, it may either be signed or vetoed. If it is signed, it takes effect on the effective date of the legislation. If it is vetoed, lawmakers in a joint session may override the veto with a two-thirds majority vote (three-fourths majority is required if it is an appropriations bill).

For gubernatorial nominees requiring confirmation, the Alaska Senate sits in joint session with the Alaska House and the two bodies vote together on confirmation, with each representative and senator having one vote.

==Committees==
Current committees include:
==Current composition==

Past partisan compositions can be found on Political party strength in Alaska.

==Membership==
===Qualifications and terms===
Senators must be a qualified voter and resident of Alaska for no less than three years, and a resident of the district from which elected for one year immediately preceding filing for office. A senator must be at least 25 years old at the time the oath of office is taken.

Senators may expel a member with the concurrence of two-thirds of the membership of the body. This has happened only once in Senate history. On February 5, 1982, the Senate of the 12th Legislature expelled Bethel senator George Hohman from the body. Hohman was convicted of bribery in conjunction with his legislative duties on December 24, 1981, and had defiantly refused to resign from his seat. Expulsion was not a consideration during the 2003–2010 Alaska political corruption probe, as Ben Stevens and John Cowdery were the only Senators who were subjects of the probe and neither sought reelection in 2008.

Legislative terms begin on the second Monday in January following a presidential election year and on the third Tuesday in January following a gubernatorial election. The term of senators is four years and half of the senators are up for election every two years.

===Leadership===
The President of the Senate presides over the body, appointing members to all of the Senate&#x27;s committees and joint committees, and may create other committees and subcommittees if desired. Unlike many other states, the Lieutenant Governor of Alaska does not preside over the Senate. Instead, the Lieutenant Governor oversees the Alaska Division of Elections, fulfilling the role of Secretary of State. Only two other states, Hawaii and Utah, have similar constitutional arrangements for their lieutenant governors. The other partisan Senate leadership positions, such as the Majority and Minority leaders, are (usually) elected by their respective party caucuses to head their parties in the chamber.

<text>The Public Schools Battalions were a group of Pals battalions of the British Army during World War I. They were raised in 1914 as part of Kitchener&#x27;s Army and were originally recruited exclusively from former public schoolboys. When the battalions were taken over by the British Army they became variously the 16th (Service) Battalion (Public Schools) of the Middlesex Regiment and the 18th–21st (Service) Battalions (1st–4th Public Schools) of the Royal Fusiliers. However, Kitchener&#x27;s Army was faced with a dire shortage of officers and so &#x27;young gentlemen&#x27;— public schoolboys and university graduates, including many of those who had enlisted in the Public Schools Battalions — were encouraged to apply for commissions. The battalions&#x27; depleted ranks were made up with ordinary volunteers (and later conscripts) and although they retained the Public Schools titles, their exclusive nature was doomed. Two battalions remained to serve on the Western Front: the original battalion was all but destroyed on the first day of the Somme. After hard service both battalions were disbanded in February 1918 before the end of the war.

==Recruitment==

On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular British Army, and the newly appointed Secretary of State for War, Earl Kitchener of Khartoum issued his famous call to arms: &#x27;Your King and Country Need You&#x27;, urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener&#x27;s First New Army, or &#x27;K1&#x27;. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and many of the units were organised under the auspices of local organisations up and down the country. The concept of a &#x27;battalion of pals&#x27; serving together originated with the &#x27;Stockbrokers Battalion&#x27; of the Royal Fusiliers raised in the City of London and was taken up enthusiastically as the &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27;. These local and pals battalions formed Kitchener&#x27;s Fifth New Army, or &#x27;K5&#x27;, authorised on 10 December 1914.

One of the most prominent of these units was raised by Major (and self-promoted) Lieutenant-Colonel J.J. Mackay and a committee of businessmen meeting at Harrow-on-the-Hill in Middlesex. They decided to raise a battalion exclusively from former public schoolboys and university men. They established a recruiting office at 24 St James&#x27;s Street, London SW, and began recruiting on 4 September 1914. Membership was by application only; over 1,500 applications were received including from retired officers who wished to serve in the ranks. Such was the spirit of adventure that many men wished to serve as private soldiers alongside their comrades, rather than as officers. Amongst the recruits were enough former international players for the battalion to field two rugby union and one football team. This became the 16th (Service) Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own), but was often referred to by its members as the &#x27;PSB&#x27;.

The volunteers were summoned to Waterloo Station on 15 September and boarded a special train for Kempton Park Racecourse where they were to go into camp and begin their training. Such was the success of the original recruitment drive that four further Public Schools battalions were raised by the Public Schools and University Men&#x27;s Force of 66 Victoria Street, London, beginning on 11 September. These gathered at Epsom Downs Racecourse and were the battalions that joined the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment).

==16th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment (Public Schools)==
===Training===
The battalion was initially issued with blue uniforms and old Long Lee-Enfield rifles due to the shortages of khaki and modern Short Magazine Lee-Enfields (SMLE Mk III). However, a number of the recruits were already familiar with the older rifle from service in their school Cadet Corps. A Regular officer, Lt-Col J. Hamilton Hall, took over command. In January 1915 the battalion was marched to a hutted camp at Woldingham, Surrey, with kit being moved by private cars and hired removal vans. By the end of 1914 the battalion had provided 360 candidates for officer training, many of them replaced by volunteers arriving from different parts of the British Empire. Unfit men were weeded out and posted to the reserve companies, E and F under Maj Mackay (later 24th (Reserve) Battalion &quot;see below&quot;).

On 10 December 1914 the 16th Middlesex was assigned to 119th Brigade in 40th Division, but the War Office (WO) then decided to convert the K4 battalions into reserve battalions to train reinforcements for the earlier K1–K3 units. So on 27 April 1915 the K5 divisions were renumbered to take up the designations of the K4 formations. The short-lived 40th Division thus became 33rd Division, and 16th Middlesex was in 100th Brigade.

On 1 July 1915 the battalions were formally taken over by the WO and on 9 July the 16th Middlesex moved to Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire where all the infantry of the division were concentrated by 13 July. On 3 August they went to Salisbury Plain for final battle training, with 100th Bde at Perham Down.

33rd Division landed in France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in November 1915. Advanced parties of the 16th Middlesex arrived at Le Havre on 14 November and the main body of the battalion left Perham Down on 17 November. In December 33 Division took over the trenches on the La Bassée front from Givenchy to &#x27;Mad Point&#x27;, just north of the Hohenzollern Redoubt, scene of bitter fighting the previous autumn, but now considered a &#x27;quiet&#x27; sector suitable for newly arrived formations to learn the routines of trench warfare. 16th Middlesex was introduced to the trenches by 1st Middlesex of 19th Bde, a Regular Army brigade that had been transferred into 33rd Division to exchange experience

In its first tour of duty at the Annequin North trenches on 2–14 January the battalion suffered its first casualties, losing one officer and 11 other ranks (ORs) killed, with 24 ORs wounded by a single shell. The next tour (27 January–2 February) was responsible for more serious casualties: first the frontline and support trenches were heavily bombarded on 28 January, then the battalion was ordered to carry out a trench raid on &#x27;Mad Point&#x27;. Although the raid was cancelled, the patrol sent out that night to reconnoitre suffered casualties. Then when the battalion was in brigade reserve on the night of 3/4 February, it was ordered to make a bombing attack on three craters at Mine Point. D Company (140 men plus 32 battalion bombers) went out but the attack was a failure; a second attempt next night also failed, with mounting casualties. On 16 February the Germans exploded a large mine; a party of 16th Middlesex held the lip of the crater until relieved by 21st Royal Fusiliers (4th Public Schools).

On 25 February the public schools battalions were withdrawn from 33rd Division and assigned to GHQ Troops at Saint-Omer while their best men were selected for officers&#x27; commissions; 16th Middlesex supplied 250 candidates. The rest of the battalion was then quarantined at Saint Omer due to an outbreak of German Measles, and it was not until 24 April that it entrained for Doullens, made up to strength with raw recruits. At Doullens it joined 86th Bde in 29th Division, replacing an Irish battalion of the Regular Army that could not get enough reinforcements from Ireland.

===Somme===


29th Division had recently taken over a section of the line in front of Beaumont-Hamel and was preparing for the &#x27;Big Push&#x27; (the Battle of the Somme) scheduled for 29 June 1916. The division&#x27;s objective was to cross of open ground and penetrate the German front line to Beaumont-Hamel, taking the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt with the assistance of a large mine. The 16th Middlesex, like other battalions, had to provide working parties to carry away the chalk excavated by the tunnellers. The plan hinged on a five-day artillery bombardment to destroy the enemy trenches and barbed wire. Bad weather obscured the targets, patrols (including one from 16th Middlesex) reported much of the wire still uncut, and the bombardment was extended for two extra days, with Z day put back to 1 July. The 16th Middlesex was in support, behind the 2nd Royal Fusiliers attacking towards the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt and the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers advancing from a sunken lane in No man&#x27;s land towards The Copse a few hundred yards further north. Controversially, the Hawthorn Ridge mine was blown at 07.20, 10 minutes before Zero hour, which allowed the Germans time to recover before the infantry went &#x27;over the top&#x27;. The explosion was caught by cameraman Geoffrey Malins and later shown worldwide in his film &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot;.

Before dawn on 1 July 16 Middlesex under Lt-Col Hall moved up to assembly trenches named Cripps Cut and Cardiff Street, where they waited while the first wave went forward into No man&#x27;s land five minutes before Zero. Both the Royal Fusiliers and Lancashire Fusiliers were caught by a cross-fire of machine guns from the &#x27;Bergwerk&#x27; to the right of Hawthorn Ridge and from the Copse, and by the artillery barrage that the Germans laid down on the British start line. The barrage was so intense and the number of returning wounded so great that the second wave, including B and D Companies of the 16th Middlesex, could not leave their trenches until 07.55. A and C Companies followed, but all were caught by the same fire. The 16th Middlesex just about reached the wire in front of the crater, with heavy loss, but could get no further. Malins&#x27; film shows a distant group of men, believed to be from the 16th Middlesex, reaching the crater, then retreating in smaller numbers. 16th Middlesex&#x27;s adjutant, Captain F.S. Cochram, went forward to reorganise the men of B and D Companies in front of the crater, but was wounded. Following up at 09.15, the Newfoundland Regiment in 88th Bde were cut down, and 29th Division&#x27;s attack was halted, having achieved nothing. Lt-Col Hall worked to reorganise the survivors and bring up the battalion reserve to hold the front trench. Many of the men remained pinned down among the wounded in front of the wire and were taken prisoner later in the day.

The battalion was taken out of the line on 3 July, moving back into billets. Figures vary, but the consensus is that on the First day of the Somme the 16th Middlesex lost 22 officers and about 500 ORs in the attack, among the heaviest casualty lists of the day; only one frontline officer remained of the four companies that had attacked. Many of the men of the 16th Middlesex are buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&#x27;s Hawthorn Ridge Cemetery No 1, close to the mine crater (41 named graves), others are in Auchonvillers Cemetery behind the start line (21 named), and 91 names appear on the Thiepval Memorial to the missing.

29th Division was relieved from duty on 24/25 July and was sent to camp in the Ypres Salient where the battalions were rebuilt and began doing trench duty once more. In October 29 Division returned to the Somme where it did trench duty in the Transloy area while the Somme Offensive continued, but 86th Bde made no further attacks until 28 February 1917, when it assaulted Palz and Potsdam Trenches near Sailly-Saillisel. The objective was to gain observation over the valleys to the north, and to discover whether the Germans were planning a withdrawal. The Regular battalions of the brigade attacked behind a Creeping barrage that moved slowly because of the mud the men had to cross. After a partial success the brigade consolidated the captured trenches.

===Arras===
In April 29 Division moved north to join in the Arras Offensive, entering the line on 14 April too late to take much part in the First Battle of the Scarpe. It then attacked at the Second Battle of the Scarpe on 23 April with 86th Bde in support for the second phase. A German counter-attack disrupted preparations for the second attack in the afternoon, and although 86th Bde took its objective it was pushed back from part of it to hold &#x27;Shrapnel Trench&#x27;, where the Lewis guns of B Company held off the last counter-attack until relieved that night. The division went back into the line on 14 May for the final stages of the Arras Offensive. On 30 May 86th Bde attacked to take a trench in front of &#x27;Infantry Hill&#x27;. It planned a surprise night attack without preliminary artillery fire, but the attack was postponed and secrecy was compromised. When the attack went in the following night, the Germans saw the attackers leaving their trenches in the moonlight and brought down defensive artillery fire. Most of the attack broke down, but a party of 16th Middlesex succeeded in getting into the enemy trench. However, they could not be reinforced and were forced to surrender next morning.

===Ypres===
In July the division was transferred north to take part in the Third Ypres Offensive, and the battalion went into the line on 9/10 August. The following night three platoons of A Company and three from the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers advanced under a &#x27;pocket barrage&#x27; to push outposts across the troublesome Steenbeck stream (which had halted earlier attacks) and take Passerelle Farm. This was successful, but had to be repeated the following night to secure the farm. The battalion was relieved on the night of 12/13 August, having lost two officers and 30 ORs killed and three officers and 83 ORs wounded during this short tour of duty.

86th Brigade was in support for the division&#x27;s attack at the Battle of Langemarck on 16 August, and 16th Middlesex was not called upon. However, that night the battalion moved forward to take over the line and the commanding officer, Lt-Col Frank Morris of the Border Regiment, was killed, only two days after taking command (Lt-Col Hamilton Hall having been promoted earlier). Major J. Forbes-Robertson arrived next day to replace him.

The battalion was present in the line and suffered casualties but did not attack at the Battles of Polygon Wood (26 September) and Broodseinde (4 October). At the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October, the battalion was detailed to be a counter-attack battalion for 86th Bde, which reached its objectives by 08.00 without much difficulty. The unused 16th Middlesex then took over the line that night.

===Cambrai===
On 16 October 29th Division was moved south by rail to train for the great tank attack on the Hindenburg Line (the Battle of Cambrai). The plan was for the division to pass through the attacking divisions of III Corps, advance with the reserve tanks to take the first day&#x27;s objectives, and then continue the advance next day. Tank–infantry training began at Wailly in early November, and the division began moving into position during the night of 18/19 November.

The attack was launched at 06.20 on 20 November accompanied by a massive artillery fireplan. By 11.30 III Corps had captured nearly all of the enemy&#x27;s outpost line and battle zone. 29th Division was given permission to advance at 10.15. Four Mark IV tanks of No 9 Section, 3 Company, A Battalion, Tank Corps, had crossed the British start line an hour after Zero and waited under cover for the infantry of 86th Bde to come up. The lead tank then used its Fascine to cross the wide Hindenburg Line front trench and the section followed it over. They silenced machine guns and snipers in Couilet Wood and Marcoing before moving on to Nine Wood, their final objective for the day. 16th Middlesex, leading 86th Bde, followed the tanks to find H Battalion of the Tank Corps already holding the wood. There were still German infantry among the trees, but the battalion suppressed these with the help of No 9 Section. At 13.15 the commander of H Battalion received a receipt for the wood from the infantry, and withdrew to his rallying point. About 16.00 a platoon of 16th Middlesex with one tank captured a bridge across the St Quentin Canal and linked up at Noyelles-sur-Escaut (already entered by the cavalry) with 2nd Royal Fusiliers which had fought its way past Marcoing.

Next day the brigade was unable to advance as planned because the Germans put in a determined counter-attack at 10.30 to recover Noyelles, and for several hours the 16th Middlesex, 2nd Royal Fusiliers and the 18th Hussars were hard pressed, parts of the village changing hands several times in bitter street fighting. With the help of two tanks they succeeded in driving the Germans out entirely by 16.00 and were then relieved in order to go into billets in Marcoing.

After the initial stunning success, the Battle of Cambrai died down in stalemate. 29th Division was set to work turning Marcoing and Masnières into strongpoints. It reported that 29 November was an exceptionally quiet day, but the Germans launched a massive counter-stroke before dawn next day. 16th Middlesex was holding posts at Mon Plaisir Farm and the nearby canal lock bridge; at 07.00 86th Bde called down artillery fire on the approaches to the farm where movement had been detected. Then shortly before 09.00 a frontal attack came in, preceded by low-flying aircraft Strafing the positions, as well as artillery and machine gun fire. Although the British guns supported as best they could, the Germans had broken through the neighbouring brigade and were streaming towards Marcoing and the battery positions in large numbers. The battalion caused halted these attackers with rifle and Lewis gun fire in enfilade at 400–500 yards&#x27; range while an improvised flank guard at the canal lock held the Germans and saved the brigade (Captain Robert Gee of the brigade staff won a Victoria Cross for this action). The CO, Lt-Col Forbes-Robertson, sent the adjutant with a party to the brigade ammunition dump on the other side of the canal; they drove off the Germans who were there and saved some of the ammunition. The Germans did not renew their attacks in the afternoon, but 16th Middlesex remained under heavy artillery and machine gun fire; as the &quot;Official History&quot; relates: &#x27;[t]his Battalion bore its ordeal with amazing fortitude, heartened by its commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel J. Forbes-Robertson, who visited all positions in turn even when, blinded by a wound, he had to be led by hand&#x27;.

86th Brigade bore the main brunt of the German attacks the next day (1 December). 16th Middlesex drove off strong patrols in the morning, but a furious bombardment began at 14.30. Having been forced into an untenable salient along the canal by the previous day&#x27;s fighting, the brigade had to be either reinforced or withdrawn, but it was not until 19.00 that word got through to pull out. All the wounded were evacuated and every man was loaded up with ammunition, the rest being dumped into the canal. The withdrawal was completed by 04.00 on 2 December, and the brigade was sent for well-earned rest in Ribécourt-la-Tour while the Germans continued to shell their empty positions at Masnières. The shelling extended to Ribécourt, so the brigade went back further to Trescault to get some peace.

During December 16 Middlesex marched by stages through blizzards to Renty, SW of Saint-Omer, arriving on 18 December, moving to Setques in early January, where they carried out training. The battalion went back into the line on 18 January 1918, holding a series of shellholes near Passchendaele.

===Disbandment===
By early 1918 the BEF was suffering a severe manpower shortage: roughly one in four infantry battalions had to be disbanded and their surviving personnel drafted to reinforce other units. After its last tour of trench duty from 23 to 26 January the battalion was sent to work on defences at Gravenstafel, where orders arrived to disband the battalion. 16th Middlesex sent drafts to the 2nd, 18th (1st Public Works Pioneers) and 20th (Shoreditch) Battalions of the Middlesex Regiment (in 8th, 33rd and 14th (Light) divisions respectively). Then on 11 February battalion headquarters and the last details (three officers and 58 ORs) went to VIII Corps&#x27; reinforcement camp and the battalion was formally disbanded.

===Insignia===
As well as the Middlesex Regiment cap badge and brass title &#x27;MIDDLESEX&#x27; on the shoulder straps, all ranks wore a yellow cloth bar across the base of the shoulder strap and a yellow vertical rectangle on the side of the steel helmet cover. In June 1917 a soldier of the battalion reported that they were wearing a blue band on the arm as well. The red isosceles triangle of 29th Division was won on both sleeves just below the shoulder strap.

==24th (Reserve) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment==
When the four service companies of the 16th Middlesex went to Clipstone Camp they left the two depot companies (E and F) at Woldingham under the command of Lt-Col MacKay. They later moved to Tring in Hertfordshire and formed into 24th (Reserve) Battalion on 25 September 1915 to supply reinforcement drafts to the parent battalion. It joined 23rd Reserve Brigade at Northampton, moving to Aldershot by May 1916. On 1 September the local reserve battalions were transferred to the Training Reserve (TR) and it became 100th Training Reserve Battalion in 23rd Reserve Bde. It was redesignated as 256th (Infantry) Battalion, TR on 6 September 1917, then transferred to the Royal Sussex Regiment on 27 October 1917 as 52nd (Graduated) Battalion, engaged in progressive training of 18–19-year-olds. Finally, on 8 February 1919, after the Armistice, it became a Service battalion of the Royal Sussex. It was disbanded on 27 March 1920.

==18th–21st (Service) Battalions, Royal Fusiliers (1st–4th Public Schools)==

The four Public Schools Battalions of the Royal Fusiliers formed at Epsom Downs Racecourse on 11 September 1914: 
* 18th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (1st Public Schools)
* 19th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (2nd Public Schools)
* 20th (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (3rd Public Schools)
* 21st (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (4th Public Schools)

Their training experience was similar to the 16th Middlesex and other Kitchener battalions. Like all Kitchener units, there was an initial shortage of experienced officers and NCOs to train the battalions. The commanding officer appointed to the 18th Bn was Lord Henry Scott, former commanding officer of the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Scots, in the Special Reserve. The 20th and 21st Battalions were camped at Ashtead and at Leatherhead in Surrey during the winter of October 1914–March 1915 while the others stayed at Epsom.

From 10 December the four battalions constituted 118th Brigade in 39th Division of K5, but when the K5 divisions were reorganised on 27 April 1915 the brigade was transferred to 33rd (formerly 40th) Division and was renumbered 98th Brigade. By 26 June 1915 the brigade had concentrated at Clipstone Camp in Nottinghamshire and on 1 July the battalions were formally taken over by the WO. All the infantry of the division were concentrated at Clipstone by 13 July and on 3 August they moved to Salisbury Plain for final battle training, with 98th Bde at Tidworth Camp.

===Western Front===

98th Brigade landed in France to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in November 1915, but 18th and 20th Bns were immediately detached on 27 November to join 19th Bde, which had been transferred into 33rd Division to exchange experience (&quot;see above&quot;). After only a short period learning the routines of trench warfare the 18th, 19th and 21st Battalions were all transferred to GHQ Troops on 27 February 1916 and disbanded on 24 April, when the majority of their personnel were commissioned as officers (&quot;see above&quot;).

The remaining battalion, 20th (3rd Public Schools), continued serving in 19th Bde. Captain Robert Graves of 2nd Bn Royal Welch Fusiliers, also in 19th Bde, was highly critical of the battalion: &#x27;Their training had been continually interrupted by the large withdrawal of men needed to officer other regiments. The only men left, in fact, appeared to be those unfitted to hold commissions; or even to make good private soldiers&#x27;. He claimed that the remaining battalion &#x27;proved a constant embarrassment to the brigade&#x27;. One night he visited the front line when an apparent German raiding party was detected: after a flare and a few machine gun rounds had been fired over their heads the &#x27;raiders&#x27; surrendered and turned out to be a large patrol from the public schools battalion that had been wandering aimlessly in No man&#x27;s land.After conscription was introduced in 1916 the special character (good or bad) of the Pals battalions was diluted as the war went on.

===Somme===
In early July 1916, 33rd Division was sent south from First Army to reinforce Fourth Army fighting on the Somme. It began to move south by train on 10 July and was in Corps Reserve during the Battle of Albert (12–13 July) before part of the division was committed to action during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge on 14 July. 19th Brigade then took part in the Attacks on High Wood: at dawn on 20 July the brigade attacked with two battalions, who forced their way into the wood but came under machine gun fire. 20th Royal Fusiliers, following close behind, cleared the southern part of the objective, but the losses in senior officers led to confusion in the brigade. With fresh support, 20th Royal Fusiliers then reached the northern part after hard fighting, but were driven back to the southern half by high explosive and gas shelling before relief could arrive. Casualties suffered in holding the positions in High Wood under shellfire were heavy.

33rd Division was rested until the night of 6/7 August when it returned to the High Wood sector to carry out engineering preparations for the next attack on &#x27;Wood Lane&#x27;. When the attacking brigade launched the assault on 18 August the various engineering aids failed and the brigade was so badly hit that 19th Bde was urgently called up to relieve it before next morning. On 28 October, during the Battle of Le Transloy, the division captured &#x27;Dewdrop&#x27; and &#x27;Rainy&#x27; trenches, but twice failed against &#x27;Boritska&#x27; trench before taking it on 5 November. At this period the 20th Royal Fusiliers was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel W.B. Garnett. Supplies had to be manhandled to the front line across of thick mud. The division then took over a section of line from the French and garrisoned this during the winter.

===Arras===
33rd Division was engaged in actions against rearguards as the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line in March 1917 in Operation Alberich. It was then put into the line for the Arras Offensive, during which the 19th Bde fought in the First Battle of the Scarpe on 14 April under the command of 21st Division, attempting to push into the Hindenburg Line positions. 20th Royal Fusiliers made a second unsuccessful attempt on the night of 15/16 April. The rest of the division attacked in the Second Battle of the Scarpe on 23–24 April. On 20 May the division made a surprise frontal attack on the battered Hindenburg Line, and made some progress. Casualties were heavy during the operations of April and May, and included the commanding officer of the 20th Royal Fusiliers, Lt-Col L.F. Leader, who was wounded and succeeded by Lt-Col Modera, MC (Lt-Col Garnett, DSO, was now commanding 2nd Royal Welch Fusiliers in the same brigade).

In the summer 33rd Division was transferred to Nieuport on the Flanders coast, where Fourth Army was intended to make an amphibious assault behind the enemy lines and advance up the coast in conjunction with the BEF&#x27;s Flanders offensive (the Third Battle of Ypres). It arrived on 31 July and spent the next three weeks under shellfire – both high explosive and Mustard gas – and nightly air raids, as well as repelling one serious attack on 19th Bde, but by the end of August it was clear that the BEF was not going to achieve a clean breakthrough, and the units on the coast began to be sent to the Ypres Salient to reinforce the offensive there.

Elements of the division went into the line in the Ypres sector during September, and then whole division moved up from reserve and was committed to the Battle of Polygon Wood on 26 September. But the division had to fight off a spoiling attack by the Germans the day before, so its own planned attack was dislocated and limited to recovering lost ground.

In November 1917 the 33rd Division was moved to the north of Ypres to take over the Passchendaele Salient from the Canadians, and spent the winter months taking turns of duty in this, probably the worst area on the Western Front, a sea of mud with no cover, with appalling trackways to traverse to and from the line, and under persistent shellfire, particularly with mustard gas shells.

===Disbandment===
Like the 16th Middlesex, the 20th Royal Fusiliers was disbanded between 2 and 15 February 1918, when 19 officers and 520 ORs were posted to other battalions, and the remainder sent to VIII Corps&#x27; Reinforcement Camp.

===Insignia===
Before uniforms were issued, the men trained in civilian dress wearing a lapel badge with the intertwined letters &#x27;PUS&#x27; (for Public Schools and University Mens Force). Later the four battalions wore the Royal Fusiliers&#x27; crowned &#x27;bomb&#x27; badge with Tudor rose and garter superimposed. During their short existence, the other ranks of 18th (1st) Bn wore a red rectangle, 19th (2nd) a violet bar), 20th (3rd) a blue rectangle, and 21st (4th) a green rectangle. 20th Royal Fusiliers had given up special badges by July 1917. 33rd Division&#x27;s badge was a &#x27;Double-3&#x27; domino.

==28th and 29th (Reserve) Battalions, Royal Fusiliers==
When the four Royal Fusiliers Public Schools battalions went to Clipstone Camp their depot companies had remained at Epsom and in August 1915 these were formed into two reserve battalions:
* 28th (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers – from 1st and 2nd Public Schools
* 29th (Reserve) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers – from 3rd and 4th Public Schools

In November 1915 the two reserve battalions moved to Oxford and then in March 1916 to Edinburgh. On 1 September 1916 they became 104th and 105th Training Reserve Bns in 24th Reserve Bde at Edinburgh. 105th TR Battalion was disbanded at Catterick Camp on 14 December 1917, but 104th TR Bn reverted to the Royal Fusiliers on 1 November 1917 as 53rd (Young Soldier) Bn. On 8 February 1919, after the Armistice, it became the 53rd (Service) Bn at Ripon. It was absorbed into the 26th (Service) Bn, Royal Fusiliers (Bankers) on 2 April 1919.

<text>Raúl Ramón Mondesí Avelino (born March 12, 1971) is a Dominican former politician and baseball player. Mondesí played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 13 seasons, primarily for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and made his MLB debut with them in 1993. He was the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year in 1994, an MLB All-Star, and a two-time Rawlings Gold Glove Award winner. Known for his combination of power and speed, Mondesí twice achieved the 30–30 club. He led MLB right fielders in assists in three separate seasons over the course of his career.

After baseball, Mondesí began a career in politics, gaining election to the Dominican Chamber of Deputies in 2006. In 2010, he became mayor of San Cristóbal in the Dominican Republic, serving a six-year term. In 2017, Mondesí was sentenced to eight years in prison on corruption charges arising from his mayoral tenure.

==Career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Mondesí was originally signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1988 out of the Dominican Republic. With the Great Falls Dodgers in 1990, he hit .303 with 30 stolen bases and was selected to the Pioneer League All-Star team. In 1991, he played in 21 games with the Bakersfield Dodgers, 53 games with the San Antonio Missions, and 2 with the Albuquerque Dukes hitting .277 with 8 home runs and 18 stolen bases. In 1992, he played 18 games with San Antonio and 35 with Albuquerque, hitting .296. He spent all of 1993 with the Dukes, hitting .280 with 12 homers and 13 steals.

He made his MLB debut for the Dodgers on July 19, 1993, against the Philadelphia Phillies, hitting a single to center field as a pinch hitter in seventh inning against David West for his first major league hit. He hit his first home run, a two-run shot off Bob Scanlan in the 13th inning of a game against the Chicago Cubs on July 31. He returned to the minors after the August 6 games, but was back with the Dodgers for good in September. He appeared in 42 games that season for the Dodgers, hitting .291 with four home runs.

Mondesí made the Dodgers opening day roster in 1994 and played in 112 games, hitting .306 with 16 homers, 56 RBI, and 11 stolen bases. He was selected as the National League Rookie of the Year.

In 1995, he was twice selected as National League Player of the Week (April 30 and July 5), he won the Rawlings Gold Glove Award and was selected to the 1995 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He flew out to right field in his one at-bat in the All-Star game. He also competed in the Home Run Derby. Overall, he hit .285 with 26 home runs, 88 RBI, and 14 stolen bases. He had two hits in nine at-bats for the Dodgers in the 1995 National League Division Series loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He was two for twelve in the 1996 National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, with two doubles.

In 1997, he hit .310 with 30 homers, 88 RBI, and 32 steals becoming the first Dodger player in history to join the 30–30 club. He also won his second Rawlings Gold Glove Award and finished 15th in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. In 1999, he again joined the 30–30 club with 33 homers and 36 steals, though his average had dipped to .253.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
On November 8, 1999, Mondesí was traded by the Dodgers (along with Pedro Borbón Jr.) to the Toronto Blue Jays for Shawn Green and minor league player Jorge Nunez. He only played in 96 games during his first season in Toronto after he tore ligaments in his right elbow during a game on July 21, which required season-ending surgery. He played two and a half seasons with the Blue Jays, playing in 320 games and hitting 66 home runs. He won the American League Player of the Week Award for the week of May 6, 2001.

===New York Yankees===
Mondesí was traded by the Blue Jays to the New York Yankees on July 1, 2002, for Scott Wiggins. He played in 71 games for the Yankees that season and another 98 in 2003, hitting .250 with 27 home runs and 92 RBI. He had 3 hits in 12 at-bats for the Yankees in the 2002 American League Division Series against the Anaheim Angels.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
The Yankees traded Mondesí on July 29, 2003, to the Arizona Diamondbacks for David Dellucci, Bret Prinz and minor leaguer John Prowl. In 45 games with the Diamondbacks, he hit .302 with eight home runs.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Mondesí signed as a free agent with the Pittsburgh Pirates on February 24, 2004. By May he was talking of leaving the team for personal reasons, involving a legal dispute, in the Dominican Republic. He left the team on May 11, 2004, and his contract was terminated a week later.

===Anaheim Angels===
The Anaheim Angels signed Mondesí on May 30, 2004. The deal was investigated by Major League Baseball, but the Angels were cleared of any wrongdoing. Shortly after Mondesí signed with the Angels, he tore his quadriceps and was placed on the disabled list. He was released by the Angels in July for not showing up for his rehab therapy.

===Atlanta Braves===
The Atlanta Braves signed Mondesí in 2005; he appeared in 41 games with the team before the Braves released him on May 31.

==Career statistics==
In 1525 games over 13 seasons, Mondesí recorded a .273 batting average (1589-for-5814) with 909 runs, 319 doubles, 49 triples, 271 home runs, 860 RBI, 229 stolen bases, 475 walks, .331 on-base percentage, and .485 slugging percentage. Defensively, although primarily a right fielder, he posted a .976 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions.

==Post-baseball career==
In May 2006, running on the ballot of the Dominican Liberation Party, Mondesi was elected to a seat in the Dominican Republic&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies, representing his home province San Cristóbal. In November 2007, he switched sides, aligning himself with the Dominican Revolutionary Party after discrepancies with the government over humanitarian aid to be given to his province after Tropical Storm Noel. He was elected mayor of his hometown on May 16, 2010, for a six-year term.

In September 2017, Mondesi was sentenced to eight years in prison and ordered to pay a $1.3 million fine for corruption and mishandling of public funds during his term as mayor of San Cristóbal. In 2024, Mondesi was re-sentenced to a term of six years and nine months imprisonment. As he had been under house arrest, the sentence was considered served.

==Personal life==
Mondesí&#x27;s son Adalberto Mondesí (formerly known as Raul Mondesí Jr.) is also a professional baseball player. He made his MLB debut for the Kansas City Royals in the 2015 World Series.

<doc id="1071790" wikidata="Q720324" url="?curid=1071790" title="Alaska House of Representatives">
<text>The Alaska State House of Representatives is the lower house in the Alaska State Legislature, the state legislature of the U.S. state of Alaska. The House is composed of 40 members, each of whom represents a district of approximately 17,756 people per 2010 census figures. Members serve two-year terms without term limits. With 40 representatives, the Alaska House is the smallest state legislative lower chamber in the United States. The House convenes at the State Capitol in Juneau.

==Powers and process==
Members of the Alaska House of Representatives are responsible for a portion of the process of making and amending state law. The first step of the legislative process is filing a bill by giving it to the chief clerk of the Alaska House of Representatives. The chief clerk will then assign bills a number.

Bills are introduced and read the first time with the number, sponsor or sponsors, and the title of the bill and then referred to a committee(s). Committee chairs can choose whether or not hear a bill and committees can vote to approve a bill in its original form or make modifications through a committee substitute. Once bills or substitutes are approved, the legislation is referred to the next committee of assignment or to the Rules Committee, which can further amend the bill or assign it to the daily floor calendar.

Once a bill is scheduled on the floor, it appears on the calendar in Second Reading. The bill is again read by number, sponsor or sponsors, and title along with the standing committee reports. A motion is made on the floor to adopt any committee substitutes. Amendments can also be offered and voted on. Third Reading is where the motion is made to vote on the bill.

===Senate action===
After final passage in the Alaska House of Representatives, a bill is engrossed and sent to the Alaska Senate to go through the same process of introduction, committee referral and three readings. Likewise, bills that have been approved on Third Reading in the Alaska Senate are engrossed and sent to the Alaska House of Representatives.

===Enrollment or conference===
When a bill is not modified in the second house, it can be sent to the governor on Third Reading, through enrollment. If the bill is modified, the house of origin must vote to accept or reject amendments by the opposite house. A Fourth Reading, in the case of acceptance, will send the bill to the governor, through enrollment. If amendments are rejected, the bill can be sent to conference, where members of the Senate and House hash out a final version and send it to a Fourth Reading in both houses.

===Governor and veto override===
The governor can choose to sign or veto the legislation. In the case of the veto, a two-thirds majority of a joint session can override the veto. An appropriations bill requires a three-fourths majority vote in a joint session to override a veto. If signed or approved by a veto override, the legislation becomes law.

==Membership==
===Terms and qualifications===
State representatives must be a qualified voter and resident of Alaska for no less than three years, and a resident of the district from which elected for one year immediately preceding filing for office. A state representative must be 21 years of age at the time the oath of office is taken. The Alaska House of Representatives may expel a member with the concurrence of two-thirds of the membership of the house.

Legislative terms begin on the second Monday in January following a presidential election year and on the third Tuesday in January following a gubernatorial election. State representatives serve for terms of two years.

===Leadership===

The Speaker of the House presides over the House of Representatives. The Speaker is elected by the majority party caucus followed by confirmation of the full House through the passage of a House Resolution. In addition to presiding over the body, the Speaker is also the chief leadership position, and controls the flow of legislation and committee assignments. Other House leaders, such as the majority and minority leaders, are elected by their respective party caucuses relative to their party&#x27;s strength in the chamber.

===Current composition===

The 21-member majority caucus consists of all 14 Democrats, all 5 Independents and 2 Republicans. The 19-member minority caucus consists of 19 Republicans.

Past partisan compositions can be found on Political party strength in Alaska.

<text>Chicken of the Sea is a packager and provider of seafood, owned by the Thai Union Group in Samut Sakhon, Thailand. The brand is attached to tuna, salmon, clams, crab, shrimp, mackerel, oysters, kippers and sardines in cans, pouches and cups, as are its sister brands, Genova and Ace of Diamonds.

==History==
The company was founded in the United States when Frank Van Camp&#x27;s son Gilbert Van Camp moved to San Pedro, Los Angeles, in 1914 and purchased the California Tuna Canning Company, changing the name to the Van Camp Sea Food Company. They adopted the advertising slogan &quot;Chicken of the Sea&quot; in the 1950s. The phrase &quot;Chicken of the Sea&quot;, first devised as a way to describe the taste, was so successful that soon it also became the company name.

In 1963, Van Camp Seafood Company was purchased by Ralston Purina. In 1988, Ralston sold its Van Camp division to an Indonesian corporation, PT Mantrust (headed by Teguh Sutantyo), which had financial problems, and the primary creditor, Prudential Life Insurance Company, became the majority owner.

In 1997 the company was purchased by the investment group Tri-Union Seafoods LLC, made up of three partners: 
# Thai Union International Inc., a Thai conglomerate based in Bangkok and the then-largest tuna packer in Asia and second largest in the world 
# Edmund A. Gann, American owner of Caribbean Marine Service, Co., Inc., a tuna-fishing fleet
# Tri-Marine International, Inc., a global trading company formed in Singapore in 1972 dealing in tuna and tuna products headed by Renato Curto, president and majority shareholder.

The new owners changed the name of Van Camp Seafood Company to Chicken of the Sea International. In 2000, Tri-Marine International Inc and Edmund A. Gann sold their 50 percent interest in Chicken of the Sea to Thai Union International, Inc., leaving Thai Union the sole owner of the company. Chicken of the Sea International and Tri-Union International LLC merged into one company, still called Chicken of the Sea International.

With the 2003 acquisition of Empress International, an importer of frozen shrimp and other shellfish, Chicken of the Sea&#x27;s total annual sales climbed to US$600 million. In 2006, Thai Union formed a new division, Chicken of the Sea Frozen Foods, to focus on sales of premium quality fresh and frozen seafood products. This division grew quickly, enhancing Chicken of the Sea&#x27;s brand awareness and distribution in the food service and retail industries.

In August 2015, Olean Wholesale Grocery, a regional cooperative of supermarkets in upstate New York, sued Chicken of the Sea and both of its competitors, Bumble Bee Foods and StarKist, accusing the three of colluding to fix prices. Chicken of the Sea was in talks to merge with Bumble Bee at the time, but it was called off on 3 December 2015 after the US Justice Department expressed &quot;serious concerns&quot; stemming from the Olean Wholesale lawsuit.

In 2016 Chicken of the Sea recalled 107,000 cans of tuna in the US due to undercooking because of an equipment malfunction at an undisclosed factory.

In May 2018, the company moved its headquarters from San Diego to El Segundo, California.

==Product name==
The company&#x27;s official explanation for the name of their product is that, in the &quot;old days&quot;, fishermen referred to white albacore tuna as &quot;chicken of the sea&quot;. It was so called because of the white color of its flesh and mild flavor reminded them of chicken. The founder of the company thought it would be a unique name for a brand of tuna.
Their advertising mascot, Catalina, a blonde mermaid with a golden scepter, was introduced in the 1950s and soon became a familiar product icon. In her book &quot;The Longest Trek: My Tour of the Galaxy&quot;, Grace Lee Whitney is credited as being the original Chicken of the Sea Mermaid. One of the photographs in the book documents this.

<doc id="1071800" wikidata="Q1277599" url="?curid=1071800" title="Earth (American band)">
<text>Earth is an American rock band originally based in Olympia, Washington and led by the guitarist Dylan Carlson. Initially active between 1989 and 1997, their early work is characterized by heavy guitar distortion, drones, and lengthy, minimalist song structures; their 1993 debut album &quot;Earth 2&quot; is recognized as a pioneering work of the drone metal genre. The band resurfaced in the early 2000s, with their subsequent output reducing the distortion and incorporating elements of country, jazz rock, and folk. Earth&#x27;s current lineup consists of Carlson and drummer Adrienne Davies. Often Bill Herzog is on bass as well as other Earth members, past present and future. 

==History==
Dylan Carlson founded the band in 1989 along with Slim Moon and Greg Babior, taking the title &quot;Earth&quot; from Black Sabbath&#x27;s prior name. Carlson has remained the core of the band&#x27;s line-up throughout its changes. At the time of Earth&#x27;s formation, Carlson was conceptually influenced by minimalist composers such as La Monte Young as well the bands King Crimson and Slayer.

&quot;Earth 2&quot; was described as a &quot;milestone&quot; by &quot;Terrorizer&quot;″s Dayal Patterson, which he described as &quot;a three-track, 75 minute deluge of feedback and distorted guitars that marked the blueprint for what Carlson at the time coined &#x27;ambient metal&#x27;&quot;. Carlson was a close friend of Kurt Cobain, who sang lead vocals in the song &quot;Divine and Bright&quot;, from a demo included on the re-release of the live album &quot;Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars&quot;. Because police had twice confiscated guns from Cobain inside a single year, Cobain had Carlson purchase a shotgun for him on March 30, 1994. Cobain told Carlson the gun was for protection. Cobain would use the shotgun to kill himself six days later. The band went on hiatus after the release of &quot;&quot; due to Carlson&#x27;s personal problems, including heroin addiction, rehabilitation, his connection to Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death, and incarceration. Carlson attributed the break primarily to his heroin addiction:

Earth reappeared around 2000 with a markedly different sound. Its music was still drone based, slow-paced, and lengthy, but it now included a drummer and featured strong elements of country music. Remarking on the stylistic change, Carlson was quick to point to the continuity with Earth&#x27;s previous sound:

The press release for &quot;Hex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method&quot; (2005) stated the band&#x27;s music shows &quot;the influence of country guitarists/songwriters such as: Duane Eddy, Merle Haggard, Roy Buchanan and fuses it with the vibe of epic visionary composer: Ennio Morricone.&quot; The press release for &quot;The Bees Made Honey in the Lion&#x27;s Skull&quot; (2008) referenced &quot;the more adventurous San Francisco bands of the late 1960s and 1970s, and the more spiritually aware and exciting forms of Jazz-Rock from the same era&quot;. The press release for &quot;Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light I&quot; describes &quot;inspiration from both British Folk-Rock bands the Pentangle and Fairport Convention&quot;.

<text> (birth name Yoshimura Yoshisaburō; 吉村芳三郎) (1 March 1816 – 22 January 1893) was a Japanese dramatist of Kabuki. It has been said that &quot;as a writer of plays of Kabuki origin, he was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, Japan has ever known&quot;. He wrote 150 or so plays over the course of his 58-year career, covering a wide variety of themes, styles, and forms, including short dance pieces, period plays (&quot;jidaimono&quot;), contemporary genre pieces (&quot;sewamono&quot;), tragedies and comedies, as well as adaptations of foreign (Western) stories, though he is perhaps most famous for his &quot;shiranamimono&quot;, plays featuring sympathetic or tragic rogues and thieves. For the greater part of his career he wrote under the professional name Kawatake Shinshichi, only taking the name Mokuami on his retirement from the stage in 1881.

==Life and career==
Mokuami was born in the Nihonbashi district of Edo (modern-day Tokyo). He was disinherited by his father at age fourteen, and obtained work at a lending library, introducing him to the world of theatre. In 1835, he entered into an apprenticeship with Tsuruya Nanboku IV, and in 1843 became the lead playwright (&quot;tate-sakusha&quot;) for the Kawarazaki-za theatre, succeeding to the name Kawatake Shinshichi II. He began working with kabuki star Ichikawa Kodanji IV in 1854, producing &quot;kizewamono&quot; pieces. Most of Mokuami&#x27;s works are in this form, and were written specifically for the star actors of the time, such as Onoe Kikugorō V and Ichikawa Kodanji IV. Many of his plays, such as the famous &quot;Benten Kozō&quot;, featured thieves and robbers, also known as &quot;shiranami&quot; (white waves), whom he represented somewhat sympathetically, as low-class heroes, or as tragic figures.

As Japan modernized and Westernized rapidly in the Meiji period, Mokuami moved along with new trends in theatre, becoming a pioneer of &quot;Shin-kabuki&quot; (&quot;New Kabuki&quot;), writing plays in new genres such as &quot;katsurekimono&quot; (realistic, historically accurate &quot;jidaimono&quot; period plays) and &quot;zangirimono&quot; (&quot;sewamono&quot; genre plays featuring Meiji era contemporary characters and setting).

During his 58-year career, he became the most prolific kabuki author in history, producing over 360 works: 130 sewamono, 90 jidaimono, and 140 dances. Mokuami formally retired in 1881, but continued to present new works, and was spoken highly of by novelist and literary critic Tsubouchi Shōyō. Mokuami died in 1893 and is buried at Gentsū-ji in Nakano, Tokyo.

<doc id="1071805" wikidata="Q1781457" url="?curid=1071805" title="Guinea-Bissau Civil War">
<text>The Guinea-Bissau Civil War was fought from 7 June 1998 to 10 May 1999 and was triggered by an attempted coup d&#x27;état against the government of President João Bernardo Vieira led by Brigadier-General Ansumane Mané. Government forces, backed by neighbouring states, clashed with the coup leaders who had quickly gained almost total control over the country&#x27;s armed forces.

The conflict resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands.

An eventual peace agreement in November 1998 provided for a national unity government and new elections in the next year. However, a subsequent and brief outbreak of fighting in May 1999 ended with the deposing of Vieira on 10 May 1999 when Vieira signed an unconditional surrender.

==Pre-conflict tension==
Guinea-Bissau gained independence from Portugal in 1974 after an eleven-and-a-half-year-long war of independence. In January 1998, ten fighters from the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MDFC), an insurgent separatist group from the Senegalese region of Casamance, were killed and another forty were arrested following clashes with the armed forces in two towns on the northern border of Guinea-Bissau.

The armed forces deployed reinforcements along the border with Casamance to prevent the separatists from entering the country. In late January, following the seizure in Guinea-Bissau of a cache of weapons, a number of officers of the armed forces were arrested on charges of supplying arms to the Casamance separatists.

On 30 January 1998, Guinea-Bissau&#x27;s defense minister announced the suspension of the Chief of Staff of the armed forces, Brigadier-General Ansumane Mané on the grounds of dereliction of duty as the weapons impounded in the previous month had been taken from a military depot of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces.

In March 1998, following protest by opposition parties at delays in the organization of legislative elections, an independent national elections commission was established. The elections were due to be held in July. In April, Mané publicly accused the Minister of Defense and a group of officers in the armed forces of involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists. At the sixth PAIGC congress held May 1998, President João Bernardo Vieira was re-elected president of the party.

==Coup and civil war (1998–1999)==
Vieira dismissed the suspended Mané and appointed General Humberto Gomes to replace him on 6 June 1998. On 7 June, rebelling troops led by Ansumane Mané seized control of military barracks in Bissau as well as other strategic locations including the international airport. Mané subsequently demanded the resignation of Vieira and his administration and the conduct of free and democratic elections in July. With the support of 1,300 Senegalese and 400 Guinean soldiers, troops loyal to the government attempted unsuccessfully to regain control of rebel held areas of the city and heavy fighting ensued.

Documentary footage shows armored vehicles saw combat with the mostly rebel-aligned Guinea-Bissau armed forces and intervening Guinean troops deploying 
PT-76, T-34-85 and T-54 tanks, with several knocked out. Panhard AML-90 armored cars were also employed by Senegalese troops.

In the following days more than 3,000 foreign nationals were evacuated from the capital by ship to Senegal. An estimated further 200,000 residents of Bissau fled the city, prompting fears of a humanitarian disaster, with the hostilities preventing aid organizations from distributing emergency food and medical supplies to the refugees. Fighting continued into July, with many members of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces reportedly defecting to the side of the rebels. Portuguese marines were dispatched to occupy Bissau to both rescue Portuguese citizens and attempt to force a ceasefire.

On 26 July, following mediation by a delegation from the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), the government and the rebels agreed to implement a truce enforced by the Portuguese, still occupying Bissau and other major urban centers. On 25 August, representatives of the government and the rebels met under the auspices of the CPLP and ECOWAS on Sal Island, Cape Verde, where an agreement was reached to transform the existing truce into a cease-fire. The accord provided for the reopening of the international airport and for the deployment of international forces to maintain and supervise the cease-fire.

In September 1998, talks between the government and the rebels resumed in Abidjan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. The rebels demanded that all Senegalese and Guinean forces be withdrawn from the country as a precondition to a definitive peace agreement, which was rejected by the government. The rebels, in turn, rejected a proposal for the establishment by Senegal of a buffer zone within Guinea-Bissau territory along the border with Casamance.

In October the rebels agreed to a government proposal for the creation of a demilitarized zone separating the opposing forces in the capital. Before the proposal could be formally endorsed, the cease-fire collapsed as fighting erupted in the capital and several other towns. On 20 October, the government imposed a nationwide curfew, and on the following day President Vieira declared a unilateral cease-fire.

By that time almost all of the government troops had defected to the side of rebel forces, which were believed to control approximately 99% of the country. On 23 October, Brigadier-General Mané agreed to observe a 48-hour truce to allow Vieira time to clarify his proposals for a negotiated peace settlement and agreement was subsequently reached for direct talks to be held in Banjul, The Gambia. At the talks, which took place on 29 October, the rebels confirmed that they would not seek Vieira&#x27;s resignation.

Further talks held under the aegis of ECOWAS in Abuja, Nigeria, resulted in the signing of a peace accord on 1 November. Under the accord&#x27;s terms, the two sides reaffirmed the cease-fire of 25 August and resolved that the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea-Bissau be conducted simultaneously with the deployment of an ECOMOG (ECOWAS Cease-fire Monitoring Group) interposition force, which would guarantee security on the border with Senegal.

It was also agreed that a Government of National Unity would be established to include rebel representatives and that presidential and legislative elections would be held no later than March 1999. In early November 1998, an agreement was reached on the composition of a joint executive commission to implement the peace accord. Later that month the commission approved the structure of the new government, which was to comprise ten ministers and seven secretaries of state.

On 3 December, Francisco Fadul was appointed Prime Minister and later that month Vieira and Mané reached agreement on the allocation of portfolios to the two sides. The first contingent of 100 ECOMOG troops arrived in late December. At the same time, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1216 which called for both parties to form a government of national unity and hold elections by the end of March 1999.

===1999===
In January 1999, Fadul announced that presidential and legislative elections would not take place in March as envisaged in the Abuja accord, and would be delayed until the end of the year. Also in January agreement was reached between the government, rebels and ECOWAS on the strength of the ECOMOG interposition force, which was to comprise some 710 troops. Agreement was also reached on a timetable for the withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops from Guinea-Bissau.

At the end of January 1999, hostilities resumed in the capital resulting in numerous fatalities and the displacement of some 250,000 residents. On 9 February, talks between the government and the rebels produced agreement on a cease-fire that provided for the immediate withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops.

At a meeting held in Lomé, Togo on 17 February, João Bernardo Vieira and Ansumane Mané pledged never again to resort to armed conflict. On 20 February the new Government of National Unity was announced. The disarmament of rebel troops and those loyal to the president, as provided for under the Abuja accord, began in early March. The withdrawal of Senegalese and Guinean troops was completed that month following an extension of the deadline from 28 February to 16 March, owing to logistical problems.

In April, a report was released by the National People&#x27;s Assembly, which exonerated Mané on charges of trafficking arms to the Casamance rebels. Although the report, which had been due for release in June 1998 when hostilities began, called for the reinstatement of Mané as Chief of Staff of the armed forces, it revealed that President Vieira&#x27;s presidential guard had been heavily implicated in arms trafficking. The United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office in Guinea-Bissau was subsequently established to monitor the general elections and the implementation of the Abuja Agreement.

===Second coup (May 1999)===
In early May 1999, Vieira announced that legislative and presidential elections would take place on 28 December, but he was overthrown by the rebel military junta on 7 May, to widespread condemnation by the international community. Fighting had erupted in Bissau on the previous day when rebel troops seized stockpiles of weapons that had been held at the international airport since the disarmament of the rival forces in March.

The rebels, who claimed that their actions had been prompted by Vieira&#x27;s refusal to allow his presidential guard to be disarmed, surrounded the presidential palace and forced its surrender. Vieira subsequently took refuge at the Portuguese embassy, where on 10 May 1999 he signed an unconditional surrender.

==Post-conflict events==
The President of the National People&#x27;s Assembly, Malam Bacai Sanhá, was appointed acting president of the republic until elections were held. The Government of National Unity, including the ministers appointed by Vieira, remained in office. At a meeting of the ruling bodies of the PAIGC that month, Manuel Saturnino da Costa was appointed to replace Vieira as party leader.

At a tripartite meeting conducted in late May by representatives of the government, the military junta and the political parties, agreement was reached that Vieira should stand trial for his involvement in arms trafficking to the Casamance separatists and for political and economic crimes relating to his terms in office. Vieira subsequently agreed to stand trial, but only after receiving medical treatment abroad, after which he pledged to return to Guinea-Bissau.

At a meeting of ECOWAS foreign ministers held in Togo in May 1999, Vieira&#x27;s overthrow was condemned and demands were made for him to be permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau. It was also decided that ECOMOG forces would be withdrawn from the country. The last ECOMOG troops left in early June.

That month Vieira was permitted to leave Guinea-Bissau to seek medical treatment in France. Sanhá cited humanitarian reasons for allowing Vieira&#x27;s departure, but stressed that he would return to stand trial. In the same month Sanhá asserted that presidential and legislative elections would take place by 28 November. In July, constitutional amendments were introduced that limited the tenure of presidential office to two terms and abolished the death penalty. It was also stipulated that the country&#x27;s principal offices of state could only be held by Guinea-Bissau nationals born of Guinea-Bissau parents.

On 28 November 1999, presidential and legislative elections were held with the opposition Social Renewal Party (PRS) winning 38 of 102 seats making it the largest party represented in the National People&#x27;s Assembly. The long ruling African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) won 24 seats. The PRS presidential candidate, Kumba Ialá, placed first winning 38.81% of the vote. In a run-off held on 16 January 2000, Ialá easily defeated acting President Malam Bacai Sanhá of the PAIGC, winning 72% of the vote. He was sworn in on 17 February 2000.

It is his first new studio album since &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot; in 1995 and is Seger&#x27;s first studio album not to be credited to &quot;Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band&quot; since &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot; in 1975.

The album was certified platinum in the United States.

<doc id="1071818" wikidata="Q1276598" url="?curid=1071818" title="Merle Travis">
<text>Merle Robert Travis (November 29, 1917 – October 20, 1983) was an American country and western singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Born in Rosewood, Kentucky, his songs&#x27; lyrics were often about the lives and the economic exploitation of American coal miners. Among his many well-known songs and recordings are &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;, &quot;Re-Enlistment Blues&quot;, &quot;I am a Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Dark as a Dungeon&quot;. However, it is his unique guitar style, still called Travis picking by guitarists, as well as his interpretations of the rich musical traditions of his native Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, for which he is best known today. Travis picking is a syncopated style of guitar fingerpicking rooted in ragtime music in which alternating chords and bass notes are plucked by the thumb while melodies are plucked by the index finger. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970 and elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1977.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Merle Travis was born and raised in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, a place which would inspire many of his original songs. (This is the same coal mining county mentioned in the John Prine&#x27;s song &quot;Paradise&quot;.) He became interested in the guitar early in life and first played one made by his brother. Travis reportedly saved his money to buy a guitar which he had window-shopped for some time.

Merle developed his guitar playing style out of the native, western Kentucky fingerpicking tradition. Among its early practitioners was the black country blues guitarist Arnold Shultz. Shultz taught his style to several local musicians, including Kennedy Jones, who passed it on to other guitarists, notably Mose Rager, a part-time barber and coal miner, and Ike Everly, the father of The Everly Brothers. Their thumb and index fingerpicking method created a solo style that blended lead lines picked by the finger and rhythmic bass patterns picked or strummed by the thumb. This technique captivated many guitarists in the region and was the main inspiration to young Travis. Travis acknowledged his debt to both Rager and Everly, and appears with Rager on the DVD &quot;Legends of Country Guitar&quot; (Vestapol, 2002).

At the age of 18, Travis performed &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; on a local radio amateur show in Evansville, Indiana, leading to offers of work with local bands. In 1937, fiddler Clayton McMichen hired Travis to be the guitarist in his Georgia Wildcats. He later joined the Drifting Pioneers, a Chicago-area gospel quartet that moved to WLW radio in Cincinnati, the major country music station north of Nashville. Travis&#x27; style amazed everyone at WLW and he became a popular member of their barn dance radio show the &quot;Boone County Jamboree&quot; when it began in 1938. He performed on various weekday programs, often working with other WLW acts including Louis Marshall &quot;Grandpa&quot; Jones, the Delmore Brothers, (in Alton Delmore&#x27;s book &quot;Truth is Stranger Than Publicity&quot; on pages 274–275, Alton describes how he taught Merle Travis how to read and write music) Hank Penny and Joe Maphis, all of whom became lifelong friends.

In 1943, he and Grandpa Jones recorded for Cincinnati used record dealer Syd Nathan, who had founded a new label, King Records. Because WLW barred their staff musicians from recording, Travis and Jones used the pseudonym The Sheppard Brothers. Their recording of &quot;You&#x27;ll Be Lonesome Too&quot; was the first to be released by King Records which subsequently became known for its country recordings by the Delmore Brothers and Stanley Brothers as well as R&amp;B musicians Hank Ballard, Wynonie Harris and most notably James Brown.

With the threat of being drafted during World War II, Travis enlisted in the US Marine Corps. His stint as a marine was very brief, and he returned to Cincinnati. When the Drifting Pioneers left radio station WLW, leaving a half-hour hole in the schedule, Merle, Grandpa Jones and the Delmore Brothers formed a gospel group called &quot;The Brown&#x27;s Ferry Four&quot; . Performing a repertoire of traditional white and black gospel songs, with Merle singing bass. They became one of the most popular country gospel groups of the time, recording nearly four dozen sides for the King label between 1946 and 1952. The Brown&#x27;s Ferry Four has been called &quot;possibly the best white gospel group ever.&quot;

During this period, Travis appeared in several soundies, an early form of music video intended for visual jukeboxes where customers could view as well as hear the popular performers of the day. His first soundie was &quot;Night Train To Memphis&quot; with the band Jimmy Wakely and his Oklahoma Cowboys and Girls, including Johnny Bond and Wesley Tuttle along with Colleen Summers (who later married Les Paul and became Mary Ford). His performance of &quot;Why&#x27;d I Fall For Abner&quot; with Carolina Cotton was chosen for inclusion in the 2007 PBS documentary &quot;Soundies&quot;. Several years later, he recorded a set of Snader Telescriptions, short music videos intended for local television stations needing filler programming. His performances included playful duets with his then wife, Judy Hayden, as well as several songs from his 1947 album &quot;Folk Songs from the Hills&quot; (see below).

===Career peak===
Travis performed in stage shows and landed bit parts and singing roles in several B westerns. He recorded for small West Coast labels until 1946 when he signed with Hollywood-based Capitol Records. Early hits like &quot;Cincinnati Lou&quot;, &quot;No Vacancy&quot;, &quot;Divorce Me C.O.D.&quot;, &quot;Sweet Temptation&quot;, &quot;So Round, So Firm, So Fully Packed&quot;, and &quot;Three Times Seven&quot;, all his own compositions, gave him national prominence, although they did not all showcase the guitar work that Travis was renowned for among his peers. His design for a solid body electric guitar, built for him by Paul Bigsby with a single row of tuners, is thought to have inspired his longtime pal Leo Fender&#x27;s design of the famous Broadcaster in 1950. The Travis-Bigsby guitar now resides in the Country Music Hall of Fame Museum in Nashville.

In 1946, Capitol asked him to record an album of folk songs. Travis combined traditional songs and several original compositions recalling his family&#x27;s days working in the mines. Capitol released the results as the four disc, 78 rpm box set &quot;Folk Songs of the Hills&quot;. The album, with Travis accompanied only by his guitar, contains his two most enduring songs, both centered on the lives of coal miners: &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; and &quot;Dark as a Dungeon&quot;.

&quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; became a No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; country hit for Tennessee Ernie Ford in 1955 and has been recorded many times over the years. Travis and Molly Bee appeared together as guests on November 24, 1960, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. The darkly philosophical &quot;Dark As A Dungeon&quot;, although never a hit single, became a folk standard during the 1960s folk revival, and has been covered by many artists including Johnny Cash in his best-selling concert album &quot;At Folsom Prison&quot;, by Dolly Parton on her &quot;9 to 5 and Odd Jobs&quot; album and by Travis himself, along with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band in the landmark 1972 album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. In spite of its initial lack of commercial success, &quot;Folk Songs of the Hills&quot;, with added tracks, has remained in print virtually ever since.

Travis was a popular radio performer throughout the 1940s and &#x27;50s. He appeared on many country music television shows, co-hosting a show &quot;Merle Travis and Company&quot; with his wife, Judy Hayden, around 1953. He was a regular member of the Hollywood Barn Dance broadcast over radio station KNX, Hollywood, and of the Town Hall Party which was broadcast first as a radio show on KXLA out of Pasadena, California and later as a TV series from 1953 to 1961. Despite his successes, his personal life became increasingly troubled. A heavy drinker and at times desperately insecure despite a multitude of talents (including prose writing, taxidermy, cartooning and watch repair), he was involved in a number of violent incidents in California, and he married several times in the course of his life. He suffered from serious stage fright, though amazed fellow performers added that once onstage, he was an effective and even charismatic performer. In spite of his problems, he was respected and admired by his friends and fellow musicians. Longtime Travis fan Doc Watson named his son Merle Watson, and Travis admirer Chet Atkins named his daughter Merle Atkins, in Travis&#x27; honor.

Travis&#x27; string of 1940s&#x27; chart topping, honky tonk hits did not continue into the 1950s despite the reverence of friends like Grandpa Jones and Hank Thompson with whom he toured and recorded. He was lead guitarist in Thompson&#x27;s Brazos Valley Boys during the time when Billboard magazine rated them the number one Country Western band for 14 years in a row. (Thompson, who could pick Travis-style, even had Gibson design him a Super 400 hollow body electric guitar identical to the one Travis began using in 1952.) Travis continued recording for Capitol in the 1950s, broadening his repertoire to include new guitar instrumentals, blues and boogie numbers. His uptempo single &quot;Merle&#x27;s Boogie Woogie&quot; showed him working with multi-track disc recording at the same time as Les Paul.

He found greater popularity after appearing in 1953&#x27;s hugely popular and multiple Academy Award winning movie &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; singing and playing &quot;Reenlistment Blues&quot; and following the success of his friend Tennessee Ernie Ford&#x27;s million-selling rendition of &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot; in 1955. His reputation as a folk-inspired singer-composer and guitarist grew after the release in 1956 of the album &quot;The Merle Travis Guitar&quot;, the reissue of &quot;Folk Songs of the Hills&quot; with four additional tracks under the title &quot;Back Home&quot; in 1957, and &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Strings&quot; in 1960, the latter two of which won five star ratings from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. His career acquired a second wind during the American folk music revival in the late 1950s and early 1960s leading to appearances at clubs, folk festivals and at Carnegie Hall as a guest of Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs in 1962. In the mid-1960s he moved to Nashville and joined the Grand Ole Opry. During this time. he became Johnny Cash&#x27;s close friend and occasional hunting partner.

===Guitar style===
Merle Travis is now acknowledged as one of the most influential American guitarists of the 20th century. His unique guitar style inspired many guitarists who followed, most notably Chet Atkins, who first heard Travis&#x27;s radio broadcasts on Cincinnati&#x27;s WLW &quot;Boone County Jamboree&quot; in 1939 while living with his father in rural Georgia. Among the many other guitarists influenced by Travis are Scotty Moore, Earl Hooker, Lonnie Mack, Doc Watson and Marcel Dadi. His son, Thom Bresh (1948–2022), had continued playing in Travis&#x27;s style on a custom-made &quot;Langejans Dualette&quot;.

Although his early tutors were among the first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing, freeing the fingers to pick melody, Travis&#x27; style, according to Chet Atkins, went on in musical directions &quot;never dreamt about&quot; by his predecessors. His trademark mature style incorporated elements from ragtime, blues, boogie, jazz and Western swing, and was marked by rich chord progressions, harmonics, slides and bends, and rapid changes of key. He could shift quickly from finger-picking to flatpicking in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick. In his hands, the guitar resembled a full band. As his son Thom Bresh puts it, on first hearing his father as a child &quot;I thought it was just the coolest sound, because it sounded like a whole bunch of instruments coming from one guitar. In it, I heard rhythm parts, I heard melodies, I heard chords and all this wrapped up in one.&quot; Equally at home on acoustic and electric guitar, Travis was one of the first to exploit the full range of techniques and sonorities available on the electric guitar.

Though Chet Atkins was the most prominent guitarist to be inspired by Merle Travis, the two players&#x27; styles were significantly different. As Atkins explained, &quot;While I play alternate bass strings which sounds more like a stride piano style, Merle played two bass strings simultaneously on the one and three beats, producing a more exciting solo rhythm, in my opinion. It was somewhat reminiscent of the great old black players.&quot; The resemblance was no coincidence; Travis himself acknowledged the influence of black guitarists such as Blind Blake, the foremost ragtime and blues guitarist of the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Guitarist Marcel Dadi explains and exemplifies Travis&#x27; style on his DVD &quot;The Guitar of Merle Travis&quot; which includes videos of Travis performing &quot;John Henry&quot; and &quot;Nine Pound Hammer&quot; and includes transcriptions of Travis solos in tablature.

===Late career===
After a career dip during which he struggled to overcome alcohol and drug abuse, Travis put his career back on track in the 1970s. He appeared frequently on such country music TV shows as &quot;The Porter Wagoner Show&quot;, &quot;The Johnny Cash Show&quot;, &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, &quot;Grand Old Country&quot;, and &quot;Nashville Swing&quot;; and he was featured on the 1972 Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot; which introduced him to a new generation of roots music enthusiasts. His 1974 album of duets with Chet Atkins, &quot;The Atkins - Travis Traveling Show&quot;, won a Grammy award in the category &quot;Best Country Instrumental&quot;, and a later album &quot;Travis Pickin&quot;&#x27; received another nomination. In 1976, he contributed to the musical score of the Academy Award-winning documentary Harlan County, USA. Toward the end of the 1970s, he signed a new contract with the Los-Angeles-based country music label CMH which launched one of the most prolific recording periods in his career. The many titles that followed included new guitar solo albums, duets with Joe Maphis, a blues album, and a double album tribute to the country fiddler Clayton McMichen, with whom he had played in the 1930s.

In 1983, Travis died of a heart attack at his Tahlequah, Oklahoma home. His body was cremated and his ashes scattered around a memorial erected to him near Drakesboro, Kentucky.

==Legacy==

Many of his original LP albums are now available on CD and his posthumous discography continues to grow due in large part to the efforts of independent labels. In 1993, Rounder Records released a live concert album &quot;Merle Travis in Boston, 1959&quot; that shows Travis&#x27; singing and guitar work still at its peak. In 1994, Bear Family Records released a major retrospective of his work and career that includes much previously unreleased material, &quot;Guitar Rags and a Too Fast Past&quot;, a five CD box with an 80-page booklet authored by Rich Kienzle, who interviewed many of Travis&#x27; contemporaries. The Country Routes label has issued several discs of transcriptions of his radio broadcasts of the 1940s and 1950s. Vestapol and Bear Family released several DVDs recently that collect many of his music videos and television appearances. In 1996, he was an honoree of the two hour television special &quot;An Evening of Country Greats: A Hall of Fame Celebration&quot; and two classic Travis performances are included in the 2001 four part PBS television documentary &quot;American Roots Music&quot; which is available in CD and DVD formats.

<doc id="1071821" wikidata="Q3234156" url="?curid=1071821" title="Ghostwriter (1992 TV series)">
<text>Ghostwriter is a children&#x27;s mystery television series created by Liz Nealon and produced by Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop) and BBC Television. The series revolves around a multiethnic group of friends from Brooklyn who solve neighborhood crimes and mysteries as a team of youth detectives with the help of a ghost named Ghostwriter. Ghostwriter can communicate with children only by manipulating whatever text and letters he can find and using them to form words and sentences. The series was filmed on location in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. It began airing on PBS on October 4, 1992, and the last episode aired on February 12, 1995. It reran on Noggin, a channel co-founded by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, from 1999 to 2003.

==Premise==
The series is designed to teach reading and writing skills to schoolchildren. Each mystery is presented as a case, covering four 30-minute episodes (except for the first and fifth story arc, where there are five 30 minute episodes); children are encouraged to follow each mystery and use the reading and writing clues given to attempt to solve them just as the Ghostwriter team does.

==Critics and merchandise==
&quot;Ghostwriter&quot; was critically acclaimed and honored for presenting a realistic, ethnically diverse world in its two-hour mystery stories. By the end of its third season, &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; ranked in the top five of all children&#x27;s shows on American television.

Created as an integrated, branded, multi-media project, the &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; brand included magazines and teacher&#x27;s guides, software (Microsoft), home video, games/licensed product, and other outreach materials that reached over a million children each month. There were many &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; novels released, both novelizations of the TV episodes and new stories. They were released by Bantam Books.

Noggin&#x27;s website featured exclusive casebook files based on the show.

==Broadcast and home release==
&quot;Ghostwriter&quot; has been broadcast in 24 countries worldwide, and generated a number of foreign-language adaptations, including a dubbed over version on Discovery Kids in Latin America marketed as &quot;Fantasma Escritor&quot;.

Despite its popularity, the program was abruptly canceled after the third season due to inadequate funding after the BBC pulled out of co-producing the show. The original series was rerun from 1995 to 1999 on PBS. From 1999 to 2003, it aired on the Noggin cable network, which was jointly founded by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop) with MTV Networks. In the U.K. it aired on the BBC and the Disney Channel at different times. The show&#x27;s revival &quot;The New Ghostwriter Mysteries&quot; also aired on Noggin as part of its nighttime programming blocks, The Hubbub and The N.

===VHS releases===
During the mid-1990s, &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; was released on VHS by Republic Pictures Home Video. The company released &quot;Ghost Story&quot;, &quot;Who Burned Mr. Brinker&#x27;s Store?&quot;, and &quot;Into the Comics&quot; with their respective story-arc episodes edited together into a feature-length format.

===DVD releases===

Shout! Factory released Season 1 of &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; on DVD on June 8, 2010. Its supplements are a trivia game and a casebook.The entire series except for the last two story arcs were also released by GPN.

==Awards and nominations==
* Writers Guild of America, United States, 1995
** Won, WGA Award (TV) for Children&#x27;s Script—Carin Greenberg Baker, for &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Music&quot;.
* Young Artist Awards, 1993
** Nominated, Outstanding Performers in a Children&#x27;s Program: Todd Alexander, Blaze Berdahl, David López, Mayteana Morales, Tram-Anh Tran, Sheldon Turnipseed

==&quot;The New Ghostwriter Mysteries&quot;==
In 1997, CBS aired a new version of the series, The New Ghostwriter Mysteries, as part of their educational &quot;Think CBS Kids&quot; block, but it was canceled after one season due to low ratings. The new series had little in common with the original, changing Ghostwriter&#x27;s on-screen appearance, introducing entirely new characters, and getting rid of the serial format of the original series. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and featured a new team of three kids: Camella Gorik (Charlotte Sullivan), Emilie Robeson (Erica Luttrell), and Henry &quot;Strick&quot; Strickland (Kristian Ayre). Ghostwriter only had two colors, which were silver and gold. Production locations included Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and New York, United States of America. Episodes ran for 22-24 minutes. Production companies were Children&#x27;s Television Workshop and Decode Entertainment. It aired on CBS (CBS Preschoolers) (United States) and CBC Television (CBC Preschoolers) (Canada).

==Ghostwriter&#x27;s identity==
&quot;Ghostwriter&quot; producer and writer Kermit Frazier revealed in a 2010 interview that Ghostwriter was a runaway slave during the American Civil War. He taught other slaves how to read and write and was killed by slave catchers and their dogs. His spirit was kept in the book that Jamal discovers and opens in the pilot episode, freeing the ghost.

==Radio series==
In 2006, BBC School Radio produced a radio series of &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; for primary school students. Character names from the TV series were retained, though voiced by new children. Music and the theme song were also kept, and a new arranged jingle for children to recognize Ghostwriter&#x27;s appearances was created by Sesame Workshop.

==Revival==

A revival of &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; aired on Apple TV+, premiering on November 1, 2019. The series was nominated for eight Daytime Emmy Awards.

A spin-off, &quot;Ghostwriter: Beyond the Page&quot;, premiered on April 1, 2021.

<doc id="1071840" wikidata="Q994779" url="?curid=1071840" title="Delegate (American politics)">
<text>A delegate is a person selected to represent a group of people in some political assembly of the United States.

There are various types of delegates elected to different political bodies. In the United States Congress delegates are elected to represent the interests of a United States territory and its citizens or nationals. In addition, certain US states are governed by a House of Delegates or another parliamentary assembly whose members are known as elected delegates.

Prior to a United States presidential election, the major political parties select delegates from the various state parties for a presidential nominating convention, often by either primary elections or party caucuses.

== As elected official ==

Delegate is the title of a person elected to the United States House of Representatives to serve the interests of an organized United States territory, at present only overseas or the District of Columbia, but historically in most cases in a portion of North America as the precursor to one or more of the present states of the union.

Delegates have powers similar to that of Representatives, including the right to vote in committee, but have no right to take part in the floor votes in which the full house actually decides whether the proposal is carried.

A similar mandate is held in a few cases under the style resident commissioner.

*Delegate is also the title given to individuals elected to the lower houses of the bicameral legislative bodies of Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.
*Members of other parliamentary assemblies, such as the Continental Congress or the New York State Constitutional Convention.
*Members of a body charged with writing or revising a foundational or another basic governmental document (such as members of a constitutional convention are usually referred to as &quot;delegates&quot;).

== Presidential conventions ==
=== Democratic Party ===
The Democratic Party uses pledged delegates and unpledged delegates (generally known as superdelegates or sometimes as automatic delegates), a combined system which had been introduced in 1984. Between 1984 and 2016, a candidate for the Democratic nomination had to win a majority of combined delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention.

Pledged delegates are elected or chosen at the state or local level, with the understanding that they will support a particular candidate at the convention. Pledged delegates are, however, usually not legally bound to vote for that candidate, thus the candidates are allowed to periodically review the list of delegates and eliminate any of those they feel would not be supportive. Currently there are 4,051 pledged delegates.

Of the 4,765 total Democratic delegates, 714 (approximately 15%) are superdelegates, which are usually Democratic members of Congress, governors, former presidents and former congressional and party leaders, as well as all current members of the Democratic National Committee and at times additionally added delegates (which had in fact enlarged the percentage of superdelegates towards 20% in the 2000s). They are not required to indicate preference for a candidate. Since 2018, the rules and bylaw committee of the party decided to change the rules so that superdelegates would not get a vote on the first ballot unless the outcome was certain.

The Democratic Party uses a proportional representation to determine how many delegates each candidate is awarded in each state. A candidate must win at least 15% of the vote in a particular contest or in a district of that contest in order to receive any delegates. Pledged delegates are awarded proportionally on both statewide and district level. So it is possible for candidates to win delegates even if they receive fewer than 15% of overall votes in a state provided they receive more than 15% in a particular district. There is no process to win superdelegates, since they can vote for whomever they please, but until 2016 a candidate needed to win a simple majority of total delegates to earn the Democratic nomination. However, it had been a usual campaign strategy to negotiate with as many superdelegates as possible to get their non-binding public endorsement and win a psychologically or even mathematically important numeral advantage by counting their awaited vote into one&#x27;s delegate numbers. There have even been presidential nominations in the past, which had been ultimately decided by such superdelegate endorsements.

===Republican Party===
The Republican Party utilizes a similar system with slightly different terminology, employing bound and unbound delegates (also known as automatic delegates, but rarely as superdelegates, as their influence is much smaller compared to those in the Democratic Party). Of the total 2,472 Republican delegates, most are bound delegates who, as with the Democratic Party, are elected at the state or local level. To become the Republican Party nominee, the candidate must win a simple majority of 1,276 of the 2,472 total delegates at the Republican National Convention.

The Republican Party has fewer unbound delegates than the Democrats do. The people who get unbound status mostly are the members of the Republican National Committee, three from each state, which are the party chair and two additional committee members elected to the committee by the state convention, one committeeman and one committeewoman. This means that unbound delegates are mainly just 168 of the total number of delegates. As the Republican Party in difference to the Democratic Party puts few national rules on how to organize the state contests and the state parties have large freedom to decide over their delegate selection process, there are also very few contests, territorial in particular and in a few states, which reserve the option to let all of their delegates or a substantial amount stay unbound until the convention, or freely declare their candidate preference binding themselves. Because of this the amount of unbound delegates is slightly higher. The state party rules ultimately decide over the status as unbound delegates, and there are also state parties that directly define their RNC members as bound delegates.

Despite their status still being part of the national party rules, unbound delegates have not retained their freedom to vote for whichever candidate they please. At the 2012 national convention, following the unusually long process to determine presumptive nominee Mitt Romney and in order to prevent a chaotic convention through a so-called &quot;insurgency&quot; of Ron Paul delegates (who had planned to garner public interest for Paul&#x27;s minority libertarian views), the Romney campaign and the Convention Committee on Rules and Order of Business enacted several historic rule changes by a vote of 63-38, which tightened the role of unbound delegates and enabled the RNC to change the rules (by a 3/4 majority) between national conventions, without needing delegate approval. Unbound delegates from states with a primary or presidential preference vote were obliged to vote according to their state&#x27;s result, and other votes were disqualified. In 2015, the RNC reiterated this decision; the unbound RNC members have since then essentially been bound to the statewide winner in the same manner as the state&#x27;s at-large delegates.

Because of the freedom of the local parties over the process, the process by which delegates are awarded to a candidate varies from state to state. Many states have been using a winner-take-all system, where popular vote determines the winning candidate for that state. However, beginning in 2012 many states introduced proportional representation. While the Republican National Committee does not require a 15% minimum threshold, individual state parties have in part introduced varying thresholds.

<text>Operation Chopper occurred on 12 January 1962 and was the first time U.S. forces participated in major combat in the Vietnam War.

==Background==
On 11 December 1961, the USS Core (T-AKV-41) docked in Saigon with 32 U.S. Army Piasecki H-21 helicopters and 400 crewmen of the 8th Transportation Company (Light Helicopter) and the 57th Transportation Company (Light Helicopter). A little more than 12 days later, Operation Chopper commenced.

==Operation==
The helicopters transported over 1,000 Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) paratroopers for an assault on a suspected Viet Cong (VC) stronghold west of Saigon. The VC were surprised and soundly defeated.

==Aftermath==
This operation heralded a new era of air mobility for the U.S. Army, which had been slowly growing as a concept since the Army formed twelve helicopter battalions in 1952 as a result of the Korean War. These new battalions eventually formed a sort of modern-day cavalry for the Army.

On 15 April 1962 the United States Marine Corps began Operation Shufly, the rotating deployment of Marine helicopter squadrons, associated maintenance units and air traffic control detachments to South Vietnam to improve the mobility of ARVN forces.

<doc id="1071853" wikidata="Q2398705" url="?curid=1071853" title="No. 100 Group RAF">
<text>No. 100 (Bomber Support) Group was a special duties group within RAF Bomber Command. The group was formed on 11 November 1943 to consolidate the increasingly complex business of electronic warfare and countermeasures in one organisation. The group was responsible for the development, operational trial and use of electronic warfare and countermeasures equipment. It was based at RAF stations in East Anglia, chiefly Norfolk.

The group was a pioneer in countering the formidable force of radar-equipped Luftwaffe night fighters, using a range of electronic &#x27;homers&#x27; fitted to de Havilland Mosquito fighters which detected night fighter radar and radio emissions and allowed the RAF fighters to home in onto the Axis aircraft and either shoot them down or disrupt their missions against the bomber streams. Other Mosquitoes would patrol around Luftwaffe fighter airfields ready to attack night fighters as they landed.

This constant harassment had a detrimental effect on the morale and confidence of many Luftwaffe crews and indirectly led to a high proportion of aircraft and aircrew wastage from crashes as night fighters hurried in to land to avoid the Mosquito threat (real or imagined).

From 1944–45, the Mosquitos of 100 Group claimed 258 Luftwaffe aircraft shot down for 70 losses. The gradually increasing threat from the RAF fighters also created what the Luftwaffe crews nicknamed &quot;Moskito Panik&quot; as the night fighter crews were never sure when or where they may come under attack from the marauding 100 Group fighters.
Top Mosquito ace with 100 Group was Wing Commander Branse Burbridge of 85 Squadron, with 21 claims from 1944–45.

The bomber squadrons of 100 Group utilised various specialist electronic jamming devices to disrupt German radio communications and radar. During 100 Group&#x27;s existence over 32 different devices were evaluated and used. Specially equipped 100 Group aircraft would fly in the bomber stream. Much of this equipment was developed at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE).

Special equipment used included &quot;Airborne Cigar&quot; (ABC) jammer, &quot;Jostle&quot; (jammer), &quot;Mandrel&quot; (jammer), &quot;Airborne Grocer&quot; (jammer), &quot;Piperack&quot; (jammer), &quot;Perfectos&quot; (homer), &quot;Serrate&quot; (homer), &quot;Corona&quot; (spoofer), &quot;Carpet&quot; (jammer) and &quot;Lucero&quot; (homer), used against German equipment such as &quot;Lichtenstein&quot;, &quot;Freya&quot;, and &quot;Wurzburg&quot; radars.
== History ==
100 Group was formed in November 1943 under Air Commodore Addison at Radlett. Its first unit was 192 Squadron whose aircraft had been used for monitoring German radio traffic as part of Y service. The Squadron moved to RAF Foulsham in Norfolk on 7 December. The Group HQ was initially at West Raynham, Norfolk. and then made its permanent headquarters at Bylaugh Hall - about five miles from East Dereham - from January 1944, a central location from which to administer the group&#x27;s airfields in north Norfolk.

The first operation was in support of Bomber Command raid on Berlin with four intruder aircraft (two Beaufighters and two Mosquitos) of 141 Squadron on 16/17 December. The first success was a Junkers Ju 88 shot down on 23/24 December by a Beaufighter. The squadrons Mosquitos were old aircraft in poor condition and their Beaufighters were being transferred out. With 239 and 169 squadrons still in training, 100 Group could only provide a couple of aircraft, if any, for Bomber Command&#x27;s attacks on Berlin. Problems with the Mosquitos persisted even when all three squadrons were operational in late January.

The group disbanded on 17 December 1945. During its existence it had one commander, Air Vice-Marshal Edward Addison.

==Order of battle==

No 100 Group operated from eight airfields with approximately 260 aircraft, 140 of which were various marks of de Havilland Mosquito night fighter intruders with the remainder consisting of Handley Page Halifaxes, Short Stirlings, Vickers Wellingtons, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberators carrying electronic jamming equipment. The group also operated the Bristol Beaufighter for a short time.

Intruder aircraft were fitted with Mark IV Airborne Interception radar for locating and attacking enemy fighters and Serrate radar detector to find enemy aircraft using their own Lichtenstein radar to look for Allied aircraft. Intruders would loiter near enemy airfields or staging beacons.

The Short Stirlings were fitted with &quot;Mandrel&quot; which jammed German Freya (early warning) radars. Later B-17 Flying Fortresses equipped the &quot;Carpet&quot; to jam Würzburg (gun directing) radars.

No 223 Squadron&#x27;s Liberators were ex-American Eight Air Force B-24 H and J models, already well used but long ranged and each able to carry multiple &#x27;Jostle&#x27; radio telephony jamming units. The Jostle transmitter took the place of the ventral ball turret.

Other units and stations:

<text>The Finke River, or Larapinta in the Indigenous Arrernte language, is a river in central Australia, whose bed courses through the Northern Territory and the state of South Australia. It is one of the four main rivers of Lake Eyre Basin and is thought to be the oldest riverbed in the world. It flows for only a few days a year. When this happens, its water usually disappears into the sands of the Simpson Desert, rarely if ever reaching Lake Eyre.

==Geography==
The source of the Finke River is in the Northern Territory&#x27;s MacDonnell Ranges, which flows through central Australia. The name is first applied at the confluence of the Davenport and Ormiston Creeks, just north of Mount Zeil. From here, the river meanders for about to the western edge of the Simpson Desert in northern South Australia. It flows through the West MacDonnell and Finke Gorge National Parks.
Usually the river is a string of waterholes, but it can become a raging torrent during rare flood events, fed by tropical rains upstream. In extreme instances, water from the Finke River flows into the Macumba River, which empties into Lake Eyre – a total distance from headwater streams of about . Major tributaries include Ellery Creek, and the Palmer and Hugh Rivers.

== History ==
Wangkangurru is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Wangkangurru country. It is closely related to Arabana language of South Australia. The Wangkangurru language region was traditionally in the South Australian-Queensland border region, taking in Birdsville and extending south towards Innamincka and Lake Eyre, including the local government areas of the Shire of Diamantina and the Outback Communities Authority of South Australia.

After several bridges on the now-closed Central Australia Railway were washed away by floods, rails were laid permanently on the bed of the river. In February 1953, after two days waiting at Finke township nearby, the river level was low enough for a steam-hauled train – The Ghan – to proceed slowly across.

==Names==
The Finke River was named by John McDouall Stuart in 1860 after an Adelaide man, William Finke, who was one of the promoters of his expedition.

The Aboriginal name for the river in parts of the Northern Territory, usually taken as &quot;Larapinta&quot;, may have been incorrectly translated by its first transcriber, the explorer Ernest Giles. In August 1872, while camped at Charlotte Waters Telegraph Station, Giles was the first &quot;outsider&quot; to record the Arrernte name for the Finke River. He incorrectly deduced from his conversations with Southern Arrernte that the name was derived from the gigantic mythological snake (known as the Rainbow Serpent) which was believed to have created the river, and thought that &quot;larapinta&quot; meant snake in the local language. However in July 1876, Rev. Georg A. Heidenreich, the Superintendent of the Finke River Mission Station (Hermannsburg), appears to have been the first to have confirmed the Western Arrernte name of the river, which was actually &quot;Lara Beinta&quot;, which means &quot;Salt River&quot;. This translation is now widely accepted because the Finke contains certain waterholes that are constantly salty (one of which is named &quot;Salt Hole&quot; in English). The legend of its derivation from the serpent is nonetheless held by the local people.

The original spelling was a deliberate choice used for the main exit road west from Alice Springs, Larapinta Drive, as it leads to the Finke River at Hermannsburg; the name was also used for an Alice Springs suburb and the Larapinta Trail. (Larapinta, Queensland may have a different derivation.)

==Antiquity of the Finke River==
The Finke River is frequently cited as the oldest river in the world. Its age has been deduced from observation and analysis of various factors in the geology of the area. In places such as the James Range, the Finke flows through deeply incised meanders. Because meanders only form on flat plains, the river must be an antecedent stream, and have formed before the ranges were pushed up; this happened in a mountain building event referred to as the Alice Springs Orogeny which peaked between 400 and 300 million years ago (Devonian to Carboniferous Periods, both within the Paleozoic Era). 

It is not possible to say with absolute confidence that it is the very oldest river, but it is certainly one of the oldest rivers in the world. However, southern parts of its course must be much younger, because the areas where the Finke now flows near the southern edge of the Northern Territory, and further south, were under the sea during the Mesozoic Era, part of the Great Artesian Basin.

The antiquity of the Finke River is not unique, but applies equally to other large mountain-sourced river systems in central Australia, such as the Todd and Hale Rivers and many others, because most of the central Australian mountain belts formed at around the same time. There are other eroded mountain ranges of equal or greater age to the MacDonnell Ranges, both in Australia and on other continents, so present rivers in those areas may have evolved from ancestral streams of equal or greater antiquity than the Finke.

==TV series==
The 2023 six-part documentary series &quot;Larapinta&quot; looks at the people, stories, and science of the Finke River. Created by Arrernte and Luritja woman Talia Liddle, the series features historians, scientists, and traditional owners, who share their stories and knowledge. Songlines and stories from The Dreaming add to academic data about the river and surrounds. Cinematography is by Torstein Dyrting. The series aired on NITV from 19 August 2023, as well as being available on SBS On Demand.

<doc id="1071860" wikidata="Q248076" url="?curid=1071860" title="Port Bannatyne">
<text>Port Bannatyne (), is a coastal village on the Isle of Bute, Firth of Clyde, Scotland that is home to many steamers. Port Bannatyne developed into the 1900s as a quieter alternative to Rothesay. It is a popular harbour, with a small yacht marina and boatyard and an unusual 13-hole golf course rather than the standard 18.

==Geography==
Port Bannatyne lies on the Firth of Clyde, approximately north of Rothesay on the Scottish Isle of Bute. Rhubodach is a further north away on the A886 and a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service to the Cowal peninsula. This ferry runs every 30 minutes during the day. In Rothesay there is a Caledonian MacBrayne ferry service to Wemyss Bay in Inverclyde. This ferry leaves every hour (journey time 35 minutes) during the day.

Substantial slate and stone houses face the sea around Kames Bay. The village&#x27;s focus was the stone pier mid-way along the south shore of Kames Bay. The bay provided mooring for yachts and fishing boats.
On the seafront are a shop/Post Office and the community-owned Anchor Tavern which was rescued from closure by local people who formed the Port Bannatyne Development Trust in 2020. The Port Royal Hotel was bought in 2000 by a Russo-Norwegian family who renovated the building and converted it into a replica of a Russian Tavern of Imperial Times, however it closed in 2017.

Above the village, with views across the sea to the Isle of Arran and the Argyll hills, is the Port Bannatyne golf-course. Built in 1912, the course now has 13 holes. The village has strong links overseas and has its own club for the French game of Pétanque, with a pitch, or piste, on the seafront.

In 2005, work was started on a new yacht marina at the west end of the village, beside an existing boatyard business. The small boatyard has grown into a stone-built breakwater which encloses part of Kames Bay and provides 108 berths for craft up to 16.5m in length.

==History==
The village started in 1801 with the building of a small harbour on Kames Bay. Lord Bannatyne of Kames Castle, at the head of the bay, planned the village in an attempt to rival Rothesay. Initially known as &quot;Kamesburgh&quot;, by the mid-19th century, steamers were calling there regularly. In 1860 the Marquess of Bute purchased this part of the island and renamed the village Port Bannatyne in honour of the long historical association of the Bannatyne family with the area. Boat building became an important local industry.

In 1879 a narrow gauge horse-drawn tram linked Port Bannatyne with Rothesay. This was electrified and extended across the island to Ettrick Bay in 1902.
In the Second World War midget submarines exercised in the bay and nearby Loch Striven. The luxury Kyles Hydro Hotel, overlooking the Port, was requisitioned by the Admiralty to serve as the HQ for midget submarine (x-craft) operations. In particular, it was from here (hotel renamed ) that the top secret and audacious attack on the Tirpitz was masterminded.

<text>Dryburgh Abbey, near Dryburgh on the banks of the River Tweed in the Scottish Borders, was nominally founded on 10 November (Martinmas) 1150 in an agreement between Hugh de Morville, Constable of Scotland, and the Premonstratensian canons regular from Alnwick Abbey in Northumberland. The arrival of the canons along with their first abbot, Roger, took place on 13 December 1152.

It was burned by English troops in 1322, after which it was restored only to be again burned by Richard II in 1385, but it flourished in the fifteenth century. It was finally destroyed in 1544, briefly surviving until the Scottish Reformation, when it was given to the Earl of Mar by James VI of Scotland. It is now a designated scheduled monument and the surrounding landscape is included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan bought the land in 1786. Sir Walter Scott and Douglas Haig are buried in its grounds. Their respective tomb and headstone, along with other memorials, are collectively designated a Category A listed building.

== The Premonstratensian order ==
The Premonstratensian order was founded by St Norbert of Xanten who was firstly a canon at Xanten Cathedral. Unhappy with the way of life of his fellow canons, he left the Rhine lands for the diocese of Laon, in the north of France where the reforming Bishop Bartholomew was transforming his see into one that was more apostolic. Bartholomew persuaded Norbert to form a canonical order at Prémontré, in Aisne in 1120 and while the order was Augustinian in form, the canons wore the white habit and not the black. They followed an austere monastic life but had a duty to preach and teach to those on the outside of the monastery walls. The order spread rapidly across Europe with the Abbot of Prémontré becoming Abbot-General for all the daughter-houses. Even before the first Abbot-General Hugh of Fosse died, one hundred and twenty abbots attended the annual general chapter. The Premonstratensians took on many of the methods of the Cistercians including land management and the use of lay-brothers to undertake the labour-intensive work of the communes.

== Abbey endowments ==

Unlike the situation at nearby Melrose Abbey with its royal patronage, Hugh de Morville, although a very wealthy noble, could not endow Dryburgh on the same scale as that of a monarch. However, it seems that King David I of Scotland was not unsympathetic to the monastery; it is recorded in a charter that as well as confirming various donations from de Morville&#x27;s wife, Beatrice de Beauchamp, the king allowed the abbey to take freely, timber from his forests for the building work. Hugh gave the lands of Dryburgh containing the forests, grasslands and accompanying waters; the fishings from Berwick; the churches with their lands at Mertoun and Channelkirk in his lordship of Lauderdale and Asby in Westmoreland; and the earnings from the mills of Saltoun and Lauder. Beatrice gave the income from the church at Bozeat, Northamptonshire to the abbey as well as lands at Roxburgh that she bought solely for subsequent donation.

Hugh, in around 1162, like some other magnates of the period, turned his back on worldly affairs and entered the abbey-church, adopting the habit of the canons. He gave his elder son, Richard, his large Scottish estates while his younger son, Hugh, received those in England. Hugh, the senior, died at Dryburgh Abbey that same year.

Following Hugh&#x27;s death, his son Richard carried on as patron to the abbey. However, in c. 1170 he founded the hospital of St Leonard near his castle at Lauder and then sometime between 1169 and 1187, the abbey of Kilwinning in the lordship of Cunningham. Although Kilwinning Abbey was built on a grand scale, it was inadequately provided for and so Richard ensured that some of the expense of its construction and upkeep was met from his holdings in Lauderdale; indeed a long-running argument broke out between Kilwinning and Dryburgh over the former&#x27;s share of the tithes from the church of Lauder. Richard de Morville&#x27;s establishment of this second monastery ensured that both establishments would remain in a state of relative poverty.

== Daughter houses ==
Dryburgh Abbey, despite this underfunding, managed to attract a continuous flow of novices to bolster the number of canons, so much so that by the closing years of the 12th century the abbey was overcrowded necessitating the establishment of colonies. John de Courcy, the earl of Ulster installed a colony at Carrickfergus and a second at Drumcross but neither flourished in the longer term and this is put down more to the constant political convulsions throughout 13th century Ulster rather than any problems at the motherhouse.

== Mounting debt ==

At the beginning of the 13th century, like its near neighbour Melrose Abbey, the abbey of Dryburgh commenced on a rebuilding programme on a grander scale, but building in stone against a background of an insecure income soon ensured that the construction work would not be completed quickly. Also at this time, the monastery became embroiled in a series of legal proceedings regarding land ownership and tithe revenues resulting, in April 1221, in the Pope&#x27;s legate having to spend some time at Dryburgh to adjudicate. The construction effort was protracted and endured into the 1240s and with debts continuing to mount to the point that David de Bernham, Bishop of St Andrews gave Abbott John permission on 21 April 1242 to appoint his canons as vicars to the supporting churches stating &quot;… since they have been burdened by grinding debts both on account of construction of the monastery and also on account of other and various necessities.&quot; 

Pope Innocent IV granted to the abbey in 1246, on the anniversary of its consecration, an indulgence lasting forty days intended to attract visitors who would hopefully be generous with their alms-giving. Additionally, he also provided a suspension of the requirements to create pensions and benefices that might deplete the abbey&#x27;s revenues, and importantly, safeguarded the monastery, its property and the canons themselves against legal redress.

Abbott John was blamed for ineffectual financial management and was required to resign and, on 13 January 1255 Pope Alexander IV wrote to the Bishop of St Andrews (position vacant at the time) and to Nicholas de Prenderlathe, abbot of Jedburgh demanding that most of the abbey&#x27;s income be diverted to paying off debts while only a basic level of income was to be retained for day to day expenses. Slow improvement in the abbey&#x27;s finances took place over the next forty or so years in a period of relative stability. However this improvement was only relative; Dryburgh&#x27;s neighbouring monasteries with their much more extensive grazing lands provided the main source of a much greater income.

== Changing patronage ==

Hugh de Morville&#x27;s line had died out in 1196 on the death of his grandson, William, and the estates passed to William&#x27;s sister, Helen, whose husband was Lochlann, Lord of Galloway. The semi-independent Lords of Galloway were much wealthier than the de Morvilles but even they could not lavish large amounts on all their dependencies. Lochlann was already benefactor to four religious houses in Galloway that included his own Cistercian establishment of Glenluce Abbey as well as being associated with Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh and the Cumbrian abbey of Holmcultram and the priory of St Bees.
Dryburgh being one of many establishments who sought the generosity of the Galloway lords got a further setback in 1234 when Alan, the last of the line of Galloway lords, died. His property was to be split between three daughters and their husbands. The lands previously held by the de Morvilles were divided again and in the 1250s were held by Helen of Galloway with her husband, Roger de Quincy, the Earl of Winchester, and Dervorguilla of Galloway with her husband, John I de Balliol, Lord of Barnard Castle and Gainford. These new owners in Lauderdale diluted the available patronage yet again as they themselves had pre-existing commitments however the de Quincys did provide a fishing in Mertoun Loch, a burgage at Haddington and lands at Gledswood near Bemerside. Devorguilla&#x27;s main concern however was her own foundation at Sweetheart Abbey, but she was at Dryburgh in 1281 to settle her lands in England on her son, John Balliol, the future king. Balliol came to the throne of Scotland on St Andrews Day, 1292 but his reign was short and he abdicated in July 1296 following the defeats of the Scots at Berwick and Dunbar at the hands of King Edward I of England. This heralded the end of a long period of stability in the borderlands.

== Wars of Scottish Independence ==
The abbots of Dryburgh, Jedburgh, Melrose and Kelso all submitted to Edward I on 28 August 1296 at an event later to be described as the &quot;Ragman Rolls&quot;, and so on 2 September, Edward ordered that lands belonging to the abbey of Dryburgh be restored. From this point up to the year 1316, very few records of the abbey exist, however it is known that Sir Henry de Percy, one of the senior members of the English occupying force, placed himself and his cortege at Dryburgh in 1310. Despite the abbey&#x27;s affiliation with the Balliol family who remained resolutely at odds with the Bruce monarchy, the abbot and canons, before 21 October 1316, expelled two of their rank for refusing to acknowledge Robert as their king; a grateful King Edward II of England rewarded them by providing them with the rent and fishery of the abbey at Berwick.

Evidence is lacking on Robert&#x27;s participation as a patron of Dryburgh. He certainly used the abbey as a base in July 1316 while conducting raiding expeditions into Northumberland. In retaliation for Bruce&#x27;s raids in July 1322, Edward II of England took his army north in August only getting as far as Edinburgh. The English army retreated through Lauderdale and looted and burned both the abbeys of Melrose and Dryburgh. Melrose Abbey&#x27;s reconstruction was generously provided for by Robert while Dryburgh&#x27;s needs seem to have been ignored. It is unclear why Bruce chose to be so ungenerous towards the canons of Dryburgh; Melrose was granted £2000 by Robert while Dryburgh received the confirmation of a pre-existing rent of 20 shillings per annum

Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and Bruce&#x27;s son-in-law was not unsympathetic to the abbey though and transferred to it his entitlements from Maxton church, and its lands and provided of land belonging to himself. In 1326, Bishop John de Lindsay of Glasgow endorsed the abbey&#x27;s possession of the church and allowed the canons to use its considerable income to help fund the rebuilding process. Bruce&#x27;s brother-in-law, Sir Andrew Murray a Guardian of Scotland during the exile of King David II may also have given holdings in his Smailholm lands Added to these were gifts from lesser donors; people like Patrick de Dunbar, earl of Marsh who gave a handful of possessions while Sir William Abernethy gave lands in Saltoun and various other minor nobles added further packets of land. Robert the Bruce died in June 1329 and in August 1332 Edward Balliol, son of the ousted King John, returned to Scotland with an army provided by the disinherited Scottish landowners and defeated the Scottish army at the Battle of Dupplin Moor, near Perth and had himself crowned King of Scots at Scone. In December, Balliol was attacked at his castle at Annan in Galloway by John Randolph, 3rd Earl of Moray and Sir Archibald Douglas and was forced to flee into England. With the support of King Edward III of England, Balliol was restored to the Scottish crown but at the price of having to make Edward his overlord and ceding to him the sheriffdoms of Berwick, Dumfries, Edinburgh, Peebles and Selkirk, including the forests of Ettrick and Jedburgh Dryburgh found itself once again under English domination. However, this did not adversely affect the abbey; Sir Wiliam de Felton, the new Sheriff of Roxburgh and Keeper of Roxburgh Castle, bought and granted to the abbey a significant burgage in Roxburgh. In 1334, Balliol was forced to Berwick for protection and the English were slowly finding their authority in the Lothians slipping away and only managed to hold power in the garrisoned centres and so in mid-July 1335, Edward III marched his army to Glasgow where he met with Balliol and his army and together they advanced to Perth. In October, following his campaign, Edward moved to Dryburgh Abbey where he expected the Scots to present him with their terms of surrender but this did not happen. David II returned from France in 1342 and more of the lands held by Edward III were won back into Scottish control so that by 1346, the county of Roxburgh and the western parts of the county of Berwick were in the charge of the Bruce party. Patronage for the canons was once again provided by Scottish lords when it is recorded that Sir John Maxwell gave the income from the Pencaitland church, in East Lothian. The Scottish lordship changed again when David was captured at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross and an English garrison took command at Roxburgh putting the central lands of Tweeddale and all of Teviotdale firmly back under the control of England and it was to remain so for over twenty years. On 20 January 1356 Abbot Andrew of Dryburgh along with the Abbots of Melrose, Jedburgh and Kelso witnessed Edward Balliol&#x27;s resignation. With the English victory over the French in September 1356, Scotland lost its continental ally and forced her back to the negotiating table for the release of David II from hostage. The treaty for the Scottish king&#x27;s release was agreed on 3 October 1357 and four days later David was back in Scotland; under the terms of the treaty, 100,000 marks were to be paid to England over 10 years and England would retain its occupied lands until the ransom was paid in full.

== Borderland partition ==
David II&#x27;s liberation from hostage in 1357 did not come without conditions, one of which was that Edward would hold on to the lands in the southeast of the country; this ensured that Dryburgh and the other border abbeys stayed in English-held territory. David allowed the abbeys to keep their Scottish possessions and did not interfere with the canons and monks from receiving the income from those. Dryburgh&#x27;s records had all been lost at this time and it is only from what is known at Melrose that Dryburgh&#x27;s position can be traced. The wool export trade and the resultant customs duty was important to David and so the Border abbeys who produced large amounts of wool were encouraged to use the Scottish ports and at the expense of Edward&#x27;s Berwick. The 1360s and 1370s saw the English hold over the Border areas diminish until it was basically the castles at Berwick, Jedburgh and Roxburgh with the county of Berwick and the eastern part of the county of Roxburgh still in their grip. Pressure on these bastions intensified during 1384 and 1385 and Scottish raiding parties moved deep into England forcing Richard II to launch his army on a hugely damaging incursion through the Borders to Edinburgh which he burned. On the way he ordered the sacking of Dryburgh, Melrose and Newbattle. It was while Richard was in Newbattle Wood in August 1385 that he took reprisals against all those in Teviotdale who had returned to the Scottish cause.

== Turning point ==

The damage caused to Dryburgh was great and influential nobles seemed to have played a significant part in its restoration—in the closing years of the 1380s it seems that Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife, Archibald Douglas, 3rd Earl of Douglas and Walter Trail, Bishop of St Andrews all had roles in assisting the abbey to extricate itself from this disaster. King Robert III, in a charter dated 9 March 1391, granted to the canons all the very substantial income-rich possessions of the Cistercian nuns of South Berwick which had been destroyed by Richard II in 1385. The family of the Black Douglases continued with their support and in around 1420 Archibald, fourth earl of Douglas gave Dryburgh the income from the possessions of Smailholme parish church. The fifth earl continued the grant of Smailholm and went further in 1429 by asking the pope to formally confirm this together with the inclusion of the hospitals of St Leonards of Lauder and Smailholme. In 1443, the canons suffered once again when fire destroyed the abbey, evidently by accident yet eighteen years later in 1461, the abbey is recorded as requesting protection from Pope Pius II inferring that the canons were finding it difficult to finance the repairs.

== The final century ==
The abbey lost the patronage of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany on his death in 1420, and in 1455 with the forfeiture of the lands of the Black Douglases, they lost a major benefactor and protector in James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas. The election of Walter Dewer as abbot in 1461 was seemingly the last prelate to be elected by the canons, but it was under his abbacy that alienation of the monastery lands began. The rest of the 15th century was characterised by contests for the abbacy from either indigenous canons and from outside, expulsions, papal refusals or royal intervention.

=== Commendators ===
King James IV rewarded clerics who gave him good service by providing them with commendatorships. The first commendator of Dryburgh Abbey was Andrew Forman, the Bishop of Moray in 1509. Forman’s primary role was in the service of James IV as a diplomat and was employed by the king extensively in Europe but accumulated much wealth from his religious and other appointments. He received the commendatorships of the abbey of Culross in 1492 although he stepped down the following year after being provided with a large pension from the abbey. In June 1497 he was prior of Pittenweem, received the rectory of Cottingham from King Henry VII of England in May 1501, was commendator of Kelso (although he was unable to firmly establish his provision), as well as the Keeper of Darnaway Castle, Chamberlain of Moray and Custumar North of the Spey in 1511.

Forman gave up his rights to Dryburgh sometime after becoming Archbishop of St Andrews and was succeeded by James Ogilvie, another secular cleric and diplomat who received the temporalities of the abbey in August 1516. He held the commendatorship for only a short time, dying in 1518.

David Hamilton, Bishop of Argyll, and the younger brother of James, Lord Hamilton, Earl of Arran, was the next to be proposed to the Abbey by John Stewart, Duke of Albany and became commendator in May 1519. He died in 1523.

The next to be provided to the abbey was James Stewart, a canon from Glasgow Cathedral. Although named in a letter from Albany to Cardinal Accolti, Cardinal Protector for Scotland in Rome, Albany actually gave the commendatorship to the Earl of Lennox who in turn sold or gave his right to it to Stewart who then borrowed from money lenders in Paris to purchase the confirming papal bulls. Stewart received the temporalities of the abbey on 6 October 1526 until his death 1539.

Pope Paul III received King James V’s recommendation of Thomas Erskine as the next commendator in November 1539 but was not confirmed until April 1541 due to a contesting provision. In 1541, hostilities between Scotland and England resumed but Dryburgh remained untouched until 7 November 1544 when Edward Seymour, earl of Hertford, burned the town of Dryburgh and its abbey. He returned in 1545 and again set fire to the abbey. Erskine was captured at Dover when the Scottish warship he was aboard foundered while en route to France prompting Marie de Guise, widow of James V, to call for his release. Erskine was ransomed for £500 and Dryburgh would have been expected to provide amply to the settlement and it may have been the need to obtain funds that, in July 1548, he resigned his commendatorship to his brother John.

Like most of his commendatory forebears, John Erskine took very little interest in the spiritual side of the abbey but was an important personage in the politics of Scotland during the reigns of James V, Mary, Queen of Scots, and James VI. John was commendator until 1556 when he stepped down in favour of his nephew, David Erskine.

David Erskine received the bulls confirming his office in July 1556 and set about quickly alienating the possessions of the abbey by granting lands to important local families. Erskine took part in the kidnapping of James VI known as the Raid of Ruthven but when the king escaped from his imprisonment in Ruthven castle, he and his accomplices fled to England. Erskine was deprived of his lands and the commendatorship of Dryburgh Abbey was given to William Stewart.

William Stewart held the commendatorship for just over a year when in 1585 David Erskine found favour once more with James VI and all of his possessions and appellations were reinstated.

In June 1600, Erskine wrote to a relative saying that all the canons had now died and marked the ending of the monastery. In 1604, the remaining possessions of the abbey were integrated into the Lordship of Cardross of John Erskine, the then Earl of Mar. Henry Erskine, Mar’s son received the titular title of commendator of Dryburgh Abbey.

== Routine of the canons ==

The daily routine of the canons was made up of religious services, agricultural duties, household functions, copying books and reading. In detail, this would have been: 
* The canonical hour of &quot;Matins&quot; was held in the early morning when the canons were wakened by the dormitory bell. They would proceed to the church for the first service of the day following which they returned to bed.
* The &quot;Prime&quot; service was held at 6 a.m. when the canons were re-awakened and summoned to church for mass; they would remain in private prayers until the bell announcing the daily meeting in the chapter house.
* The community would assemble in the cloister then proceed to the chapter house where a lesson from the rules of the order was read. Any transgressors were held to account for their actions and any punishments carried out by the prior.
* In winter, at the hour of &quot;Tierce&quot;, or 9 a.m., following on from the meeting of the chapter, the canons would proceed in pairs to the church for the singing of hymns. In summer, there was a longer interval before Tierce so that the abbey duties could be performed. The summer Tierce was a high mass.
* High mass was performed at the hour of &quot;Sext&quot;, or mid-day, in winter.
* The community ate at 1 p.m. where only two dishes were served except on certain occasions when an additional sweet dish, called a &quot;pittance&quot; was provided. If someone was late for the meal then unless he had an adequate excuse, he would have to sit at the most remote of the tables and perhaps with no wine or ale.
* After the dinner, some canons rested while others conversed until the hour of &quot;Nones&quot;, or 3 p.m. when the canons proceeded to church for another service after which, the community were required to wash their hands and wait in the cloister until summoned to the refectory to drink.
* At 6 p.m. the canons attended &quot;Vespers&quot;.
* The &quot;Compline&quot;, the last of the day&#x27;s worship was held after 7 p.m. followed by a light supper and then bed.
* There were no sheets on the dormitory beds and the canons were required to sleep in their habit
* in the Autumn, the agricultural canons would leave for the fields early in the morning and occasionally would not return until after vespers. They had to recite their prayers at the appointed hours as they toiled, however.

There is a legend that the ruins of Dryburgh Abbey is the home of a benevolent spirit called Fat Lips. A woman who lost her lover in the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion made her home in the ruined abbey and claimed that Fat Lips, a little man in iron boots, used to tidy her cell for her.

<text>Sir Wilmot Hudson Fysh (7 January 18956 April 1974) was an Australian aviator and businessman. A founder of the Australian airline company Qantas, Fysh was born in Launceston, Tasmania. Serving in the Battle of Gallipoli and Palestine Campaign as a lieutenant of the Australian Light Horse Brigade, Fysh later became an observer and gunner to Paul McGinness in the AFC. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross during the aftermath of the war for his services to aerial warfare.

Fysh, alongside Paul McGinness and Sir Fergus McMaster started Qantas in 1920. Despite government ownership, Fysh became managing director and chairman of Qantas. A committee member of the International Air Transport Association, he became president of the organisation in 1960. He was also one of the founders of the Australian National Travel Association, now known as the Australian Tourist Commission, a member of the Royal Aeronautical and British Interplanetary society, the Institute of Transport and the Australasian Pioneers Club.

Acknowledged for his work as an aviation historian, Fysh wrote books on the history and development of Qantas, exemplifying the airline&#x27;s role in both military and civil aviation. Authoring a trilogy of memoirs dealing with the impact of Qantas in history, the series drew comparisons by critics towards Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Second World War&quot;.

Fysh died in Paddington at the age of 79, on 6 April 1974.

==Early and personal life==

Wilmot Hudson Fysh was born in the city of Launceston in Tasmania, Australia, on 7 January 1895. His father, Frederick Wilmot Fysh, was a merchant, while his mother, Mary (&quot;née&quot; Reed), was the daughter of a famous landowner, Henry Reed. Fysh was the oldest of five siblings; Hudson, Henry, Margaret, Mary and Graham. He was also the great-nephew of Sir Philip Fysh. His childhood was marred by the failure of his parents&#x27; marriage and his father&#x27;s business. Originally staying with his father, he ran away so often that eventually he was able to stay with his mother. Living in St Leonards—a suburb of Launceston—until 1914, he enlisted in the Light Horse upon the start of World War I.

Educated at Launceston and Geelong grammar schools, Fysh worked as a jackaroo and woolclasser after his education. He was also a cadet in the 70 Infantry Militia as a teenager, before volunteering for the Tasmanian 26th Light Horse upon the outbreak of war. After the foundation of Qantas, Fysh, being a poor student at school, tried to make up for his lack of training by studying economics and taking a course in pelmanism. After his retirement from Qantas, Fysh received an honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering (EngD), in a commemoration ceremony from the University of Tasmania, in 1971.

Described as a man of &quot;great political acumen&quot; and having &quot;a hard head for business&quot;, Fysh had a reputation as a stern, uncompromising taskmaster. This contrasted against his &quot;shy, quiet&quot; nature; he described himself as &quot;painfully shy...as a child feeling looked down on, sensitive, and socially lost.&quot; Fysh felt these feelings never left him, being &quot;ill at ease with fame or publicity.&quot; Described as single-minded in many instances, his insistence on using a D.H.86 (De Havilland Express 86) lead to a bitter clash and eventual fall-out between Fysh and Sir Gordon Taylor. Fysh also made rivals in other airline entrepreneurs such as Norman Brearley, a founder of Western Australian Airways.

On 5 December 1923, Fysh married Elizabeth Eleanor (&quot;Nell&quot;) Dove, from Hunter River, in St James Church, Sydney. They had a son and daughter, John Hudson Fysh and Wendy Elizabeth Fysh, both born in Longreach, Queensland. Fysh described his family as &quot;his bulwark against the [company&#x27;s] relentless pressures&quot;

==World War I==

On 25 August 1914, Fysh enlisted in the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade at a training camp in Pontville, Tasmania, following the declaration of the Great War. Initially commissioned as a private, Fysh was transported from Hobart on the HMAT Geelong to Egypt on 20 October 1914. He received his training in Egypt, and arrived at Gallipoli in May 1915; only two weeks after the initial Anzacs had arrived. Fysh was evacuated in December 1915, after serving for 7 months in the Australian Imperial Force.

He served in Palestine and Sinai, fighting in the Palestine Campaign for the &#x27;C&#x27; Squadron of the Light Horse Regiment. He was transferred from Palestine on 17 July 1916, to the 1st Light Horse Brigade, Machine Gun Squadron. First promoted to corporal, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in January 1917. Fighting under lieutenant Ross Smith in the Light Horse, he soon replaced Smith as the section officer when Smith was transferred to the Flying Corps.

In July 1917, Fysh requested a transfer from the Light Horse Brigade to the Royal Flying Corps. After months of training, he qualified as an observer and gunner, in October 1917. Originally fighting for the Royal Flying Corps No. 67 squadron, he later fought for the No.1 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps, under the command of Major Richard Williams.

In the Flying Corps, Fysh was gunner to Major Sydney W. Addison and later to Lieutenant Paul McGinness. Engaging in battle as gunner in a Bristol Fighter, against German and Turkish aircraft in the Middle Eastern campaigns, Fysh was an observer ace, shooting down 5 enemy aircraft. On 8 January 1919, Fysh was recommended for the Distinguished Flying Cross. The award was gazetted in the London Gazette and the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette on 8 February 1919 and 23 May 1919 respectively.

==Career==

===Survey of the Great Air Race===

On 28 February 1919, at Heliopolis, Fysh received his flying licence, graduating as a scout pilot. In March 1919, an announcement was made by the Prime Minister of Australia, William Morris Hughes, of a Great Air Race for the &quot;first successful flight to Australia from Great Britain in a machine manned by Australians&quot;. The prize money was £A10,000 (or £8,000 sterling), under the condition that the flight is completed within 720 hours, and before midnight of 31 December 1919. Deciding to join the race, Fysh regrouped with Paul McGinness as his co-pilot.

To fund the race, McGinness approached Sir Samuel McCaughey, the man who donated the plane that McGinness flew in for World War I. McCaughey agreed to fund the race, and they were joined by Arthur Baird, their flight-sergeant engineer during the war. Prior to the race, on 25 July 1919, McCaughey died and his executors refused to honour his agreement with McGinness. As a result, plans for the race were abandoned. Instead, Fysh and McGinness were commissioned to survey Northern Australia for the preparation of the Air Race, by Major-General James Gordon Legge (later Lieutenant-General) from the Defence Department. They were instructed to survey the route from the town of Longreach, past Katherine, and ending at the state capital of Darwin, in the Northern Territory.

Arriving in Longreach in August 1919, they acquired a Model T Ford, as a transport for the survey, and were accompanied by a mechanic, George Gorham. Leaving Longreach on 18 August 1919, the group traveled through Winton, Kynuna and McKinlay, reaching the town of Cloncurry on 20 August 1919. They were the first people to travel across the Gulf of Carpentaria, using an automobile. The team traveled through Burketown, the stations of Westmoreland and Wollorgorang, before reaching Hobble Chain Creek. From there, they traveled through Big Running Creek, Calvert River, Warbys Lagoon, Snake Lagoon, Fulch River, Werrin River, Fletcher River, Feathertop Creek. As none of the rivers have bridges, the group had to wade across the rivers. Following a route taken by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845, they reached Borroloola. Fysh began a diary of maps and photography, to record their journey across Northern Australia.
Leaving Borroloola on 25 September 1919, they followed the Roper River, and arriving at Katherine on 8 October 1919. From Katherine, they took a train, &quot;Leaping Lena&quot;, to Darwin. In total, the pair had traveled through 2180 kilometre in their Model T Ford, taking up 51 days for their trip from Longreach to Katherine. As a result of their journey across the outback, the group found Legge&#x27;s route lacking the necessary open space for aircraft landing. Fysh and McGinness became convinced that an alternate route through the Barkly Tableland will be more convenient for the winners of the air race, after talking to some motorcyclists from Sydney.

Upon reaching Darwin, McGinness and Gorham traveled back to Cloncurry to survey and build landing routes on the way there, while Fysh was to stay in Darwin and create suitable landing strips there and at Katherine. In a letter addressed to General Legge dated to 30 October 1919, Fysh rejected the use of the racecourse in Darwin, which was originally picked by Reginald Lloyd (the head of the first ground survey to find a suitable route for the aircraft), as the landing ground for the winning aircraft. He then suggested an alternate strip, locating one near Fannie Bay, to the north of Darwin. Shortly before the landing of the Smith brothers, the landing strip at Fannie Bay was completed at the cost of £A700.

On 10 December 1919, the team of Ross Smith, Keith Smith, Jim Bennett and Wally Shiers, winners of the Great Race, arrived in Darwin and were greeted by Fysh (as the official representative of the Defence Department). Deciding to return to Longreach in May 1920, Fysh met Alexander Kennedy, when he was given hospitality in Kennedy&#x27;s homestead, &quot;Bushby Park&quot;. As McGinness had stopped at the homestead earlier on his way to Cloncurry, Kennedy told Fysh about McGinness&#x27; idea of an airline service for the region.

===Foundation of Qantas===

After reuniting at the Cloncurry Post Office, McGinness and Fysh started to make plans to build their airline service, confident in the future of commercial aviation. Writing about his experiences in the outback in his autobiography, Fysh commented that: 

Earlier on, McGinness had met a grazier, Fergus McMaster, when McMaster&#x27;s car axle had broken down on a bed in Cloncurry River. McGinness fixed the car, gaining the respect of McMaster. McGinness and Fysh headed off to Brisbane, further developing their plan along the way. Coincidentally, McMaster also went to Brisbane. Upon realising this, Fysh and McGinness, explained their airline plans to him. The initial plans for the airline service consisted of joyriding, air taxi trips and charter services spanning the Northern Territory— Western Queensland region of Australia. As a result, on 20 June 1920 in Brisbane&#x27;s Gresham Hotel, McGinness, Fysh, McMaster and Alan Campbell, an adviser for the Queensland Primary Producers, began to register the new airline company. The registration of the company was not finalised that day. It took several months before a name and the necessary funds were found for the business.

Funds for the company were lacking. Demonstrating his faith in the airline, Fysh invested his savings of £A500 (£400 sterlings), while McGinness invested £1000. After being contacted by the group, Arthur Baird joined them in the idea, once again closing his garage business. A main investor for Qantas was Ainslie Templeton, a friend of Fergus McMaster and a woolgrower in the Longreach district, who promised to match McMaster&#x27;s investments in the &quot;air service project&quot;, upon being told of the idea. Fysh and McGinness then traveled through the towns in the Northern Territory and Queensland, asking for investments for the airline. They were met with positive responses. After observing a shareholder writing &quot;Donation&quot; across the cheque butt, Fysh wrote:
After trying many different names for the company, the Queensland And Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited or Qantas was chosen, a name that McMaster later stated was created &quot;with Anzac as its inspiring factor&quot;. Qantas was formed on 16 November 1920, with Fysh, McGinness, McMaster, Ainslie Templeton, and Alan Campbell in the Gresham Hotel, with an initial paid-up capital of £A6,700 (£5,360 sterlings). The job of executive chairman of the airline was given to McMaster, with Winton becoming the head office and &quot;the official birthplace of Qantas&quot;.

Partially due to McMaster&#x27;s intervention, the original plans for air-taxi work and joyriding gave way for airmail services, which would link communication in the settlements between Darwin and Longreach. McMaster summarised it as &quot;an aerial mail service from Longreach to Port Darwin, connecting at Winton, Cloncurry, Avon Downs, Anthony Lagoon, Newcastle Waters and The Katherine&quot;, therefore making it the longest direct air service in the world at that time. Another plan for Qantas came forth with Dr Frederick Archibald Michod, a doctor and aviator in Longreach who became foundation director of Qantas after its formation. Visiting cattle stations and private properties to give medical treatment, Michod was aware of the difficulties faced in the outback. Establishing a hospital in Longreach, he often used his aircraft as an aerial ambulance. He proposed an idea for a &quot;flying doctor&quot;, which would later take form in the late 1920s with the Presbyterian minister, John Flynn.

The airline was provided with a wool store as their first hangar by A.J.B. McMaster, owner of Alba Woolscour, original Qantas shareholder and older Brother of Sir Fergus McMaster. On 7 February 1921, the first and only Qantas board meeting in Winton was held in the Winton Club, three days after the pilots landed, on 10 February. A quick decision was made to move Qantas headquarters to Longreach, which would be more central to operations, with easier access to passengers and spare parts.

===Qantas first fleet and flight===

In August 1920, Fysh and McGinness ordered their first aircraft for the company from Mascot Aerodrome, the first airport in Australia – two Avro 504K with Sunbeam Dyak engines, bought at £A1,425 each. The purchase for the 504K was dated 19 August 1920, and under the name of &quot;The Western Queensland Auto Aero Service Limited&quot;. The Avro was one of the original, of six, military aircraft built in Australia by AA &amp; E Co. Ltd. upon the orders of the Commonwealth Government for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). AA &amp; E later went into liquidation after falling to their cheaper British competitors.

However a delay in the engines caused anxiety in the pilots, with their financial circumstance lingering. A decision was soon put up to order a third aircraft, with the company considering both the Avro 547 triplane and the &quot;Westland Limousine Machine&quot;. After initial misgiving by McMaster, Fysh and McGinness finally settled for the Avro triplane. The Avro 547 was bought for £A2,798, and was considered a revolution in airplane technology, able to hold 4 passengers in an enclosed cabin. The Avro had also won a £A10,000 competition sponsored by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; for the &quot;best commercial aircraft&quot;. Due to their financial circumstances however, the order for one of the Avro 504K was cancelled.

After being informed that the Dyak engine was ready by the owner of the Aerodrome, Nigel Love, on 23 November 1920; they were told that the Avro 504K would be ready by December. However the aircraft was delayed until 25 January 1923, upon which McGinness send a wire message to McMaster stating that all tests have been complete with satisfactory results. Fysh, who was also in Mascot, was left redundant due to the cancellation of the second Avro 504K, until Charles Knight, a Longreach stock and station agent, requested him to fly a RAF B.E.2e back to Longreach. Despite only having thirty minutes of practice on the BE2e during his pilot licence training, Fysh agreed to fly it, with Baird as his passenger. Fysh later stated that &quot;when I took the aeroplane over, the problem of my own temporary redundancy was solved&quot;.

On 31 January 1921, 6 days after McGinness sent the message to McMaster, McGinness, Fysh and Baird took off from Mascot aiming to reach Moree before dark. Due to the strong winds and turbulence, the BE2e began to spin, disorientating Fysh in the process. Landing his aircraft on an upside slope of a hill, they came to rest near a miner&#x27;s cottage. Fysh and Baird soon found out that they were near Red Head mine (formally named &quot;Lambton B Pit&quot;), close to Singleton.

Joining McGinness, who had safely arrived in Singleton, they flew northwards; stopping at Moree, St. George, Charleville, Blackall, and then at Barcaldine, the last stop before reaching Longreach. Meeting at Barcaldine with McMaster, who had caught the train from Rockhampton to the town, McMaster decided to fly with them to Longreach, hoping their arrival in the town would be &quot;impressive and historical&quot;. Reaching Longreach in the scheduled time, the flight beat the mail train from Barcaldine by 20 minutes despite the train leaving Barcaldine 2-hour earlier. Mapping the airline&#x27;s short-term future in the Shakespeare Hotel in Longreach, they soon planned the last leg of the journey to Winton.

With Ainslie Templeton accompanying McMaster and McGinness in the Avro, Fysh flew with the owner of the aircraft, Charles Knight, to Winton on 7 February 1921. The trip of one and a half hours took considerably longer than that, with McGinness steering in the wrong direction, causing them to lose their path. They finally reached Winton after 3 hours of flight, with 15 minutes worth of fuel left. After &quot;landing gracefully&quot; to the cheering of a crowd in Winton, they were &quot;entertained at a smoke concert at the North Gregory Hotel.&quot; In the hotel, McMaster outlined the links between aviation and defence, in reference to the future of Qantas.

The next day, the 2 aircraft took off from Winton to return to Longreach. With Knight as his passenger in the BE2e, Fysh lost his way, missing Longreach by ; he navigated his way back to the town by following the Thompson River. The journey, coupled with the earlier delayed trip when flying from Longreach to Winton, proved to be too much for Knight, who sold the BE2e to the company upon landing, swearing that &quot;nothing would induce him to fly again.&quot; The cost of the aircraft was £A450 which was partially bought, as insisted by McMaster, in the form of shares to the airline company.

===Further career with Qantas===
In 1922, Qantas was successful in bidding for the second Australian scheduled air route, which was to be established between Charleville and Cloncurry. The route was backed by the government, procured by relations between Qantas and regional politicians. While still piloting regularly until 1930, hard working Fysh studied business and management, and became managing director in 1923. When the airmail route to England was planned, Qantas successfully tendered, with Fysh involved in planning the route in the years 1931 to 1933. The final agreement saw Qantas flying the airmail to Singapore, where British Imperial Airways would take over. 1934, Qantas and Imperial Airways built a new company, Qantas Empire Airways, with both companies holding 50% of the stock. Fysh became managing director in the new formed company as well. He was also a co-founder of the Tasman Empire Airways Ltd in 1940, which later should become Air New Zealand.

Second World War was hitting the prospering business of Qantas hard. Japanese attacks in Singapore destroyed half of Qantas&#x27; fleet, the airport in Darwin was under attack as well. Fysh, still an officer in the RAAF, took responsibility for using Qantas equipment in war-related efforts, for example evacuation and supply flights. In 1946, the Australian government bought Qantas for market value. Fysh was the only manager of the company who supported this course of events. After finishing the negotiations, he became chairman of now government-owned Qantas, succeeding his co-founder McMasters. In 1955 he retired from the position as managing director. After controversies with the rest of the Qantas board, he eventually retired as chairman in 1966.

==Published works==

A writer of aviation history, Fysh authored many books during and after his career. In the biography &quot;Taming the North: The Story of Alexander Kennedy and Other Queensland Pathfinders&quot; which was first published in 1933, Fysh details the life of Alexander Kennedy, the first paying passenger for Qantas and a well-known pastoralist, later recording Kennedy&#x27;s life in the Australian Dictionary of Biography. Fysh also wrote &quot;The Log of the Astraea&quot;, a book on the Imperial Airways monoplane airliner &quot;Astraea&quot; and the events surrounding the airmail flights to England, which eventually led towards Qantas&#x27; partnership with the Imperial Airways.

However his most successful publication was an autobiographical trilogy dealing with Qantas&#x27; history and its role in World War II and transportation in Australia. The first book in the trilogy, &quot;Qantas Rising: The Autobiography of the Flying Fysh&quot;, is an autobiography of Fysh&#x27;s life, from World War I and the development of Qantas to the expansion of Qantas into Qantas Empire Airways in the mid-1930s. The book was &quot;one of the very few autobiographies of airline pioneers&quot;, and was noted as &quot;much to be welcomed&quot; by critical review.

The second book in the series, &quot;Qantas at War&quot;, was written about the changes of Qantas and the Imperial Airways in times of nationalization and war. The book follows the dispute between Qantas. Following the positive response from the prior book in the trilogy, Qantas at War was compared to Winston Churchill&#x27;s six-volume history series &quot;The Second World War&quot;. Higham (an aviation historian and professor of history) wrote that they (&quot;The Second World War&quot; and &quot;Qantas at War&quot;) &quot;are well-written memoirs of the higher direction&quot; and &quot;both leave room for other works which will more mundanely examine the whole of the problems and set the story in its general milieu&quot;. When addressing future historians, he states that they &quot;will ever remain most grateful to Sir Hudson for these memoirs&quot;.

The trilogy was completed with &quot;Wings to the World&quot; which was published in 1970. The book oversaw the expansion of Qantas, from the introduction of the Super Constellations to the beginnings of the jet era. &quot;Taming of the North&quot;, &quot;Qantas Rising&quot;, &quot;Qantas at War&quot; and &quot;Wings of the World&quot;, alongside &quot;Front-Line Airline&quot; by E. Bennett-Bremner, was selected for a series titled the &quot;Qantas Foundation Memorial Book Set&quot;. Also authoring a biography on Henry Reed, titled &quot;Henry Reed: Van Diemen&#x27;s Land pioneer&quot; in Hobart, 1973, Fysh wrote a profile on the merchant in the Australian Dictionary of Biography in 1967. He also wrote a treatise on trout fishing, &quot;Round the bend in the stream&quot;, in 1968.

==Tributes==
As a result of his contributions to international aviation, he was knighted in 1953, becoming a Knight-Commander of the Order of the British Empire.

He received an honorary Engineering Doctorate in 1971.

After Fysh&#x27;s death on 6 April 1974, to mark the centenary year of Australia Day, he was named in the list of &quot;100 most influential Australians of the century&quot; by the Sydney Morning Herald.

In theatrical productions, Fysh was portrayed by Brendan Hanson in the Australian television mini-series, &quot;Air Australia&quot;, a documentary depicting the history of early Australian aviation.

In 2002, Fysh was inducted into the Pacific Air Travel Association&#x27;s Gallery of Legends for &quot;personal excellence, integrity and a lifetime contribution to travel and tourism&quot;, the tenth person ever to be inducted.

In late 2008, an Airbus A380 was named after Hudson Fysh in recognition of his contribution to the aviation industry and Qantas.

There is a Hudson Fysh Avenue in Parap, Northern Territory near the old Darwin Airport runway.

The sample card of Qantas Frequent Flyer and Qantas credit card products all have W H Fysh as placeholder name.

<text>Wemyss Bay () is a village on the coast of the Firth of Clyde in Inverclyde in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. It is in the traditional county of Renfrewshire. It is adjacent to Skelmorlie, North Ayrshire. The town and villages have always been in separate counties, divided by the Kelly Burn.

Wemyss Bay is the port for ferries on the Sea Road to Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. Passengers from the island can connect to Glasgow by trains, which terminate in the town at Wemyss Bay railway station, noted for its architectural qualities and regarded as one of Scotland&#x27;s finest railway buildings. The port is very exposed, so in high winds the ferries must travel up river to Gourock to dock.

==Topography==

==Etymology==

The name Kelly comes from Celtic languages, with the meaning of a wood or woodland. Similarly, Kelburn refers to a wooded river.

The name Wemyss is derived from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;uaimh&quot; which means &quot;cave&quot;. It is believed to be taken from the caves of the Firth of Forth where the Clan Wemyss made their home. The chiefs are one of the few noble families who are descended from the Celtic nobility through the Clan MacDuff Earls of Fife.

Unlike the Firth of Forth, no conspicuous caves were seen in the Wemyss Bay area, though some minor caves may have been found in the cliffs. In his guide, Boyd says he was told the story that an old fisherman named Robert Wemyss lived at the bay in the 18th century, and rented out boats. Three of his regular customers were unable to agree on the name for the bay, until they decided to &quot;call it after old Bob&quot;.

==History==
===Lands of Kelly and Ardgowan===
The Kelly Burn flows west down the hillside in a ravine and into the bay, which at one time was called Kelly Bay or White Week. The lands of Kelly, to the north of the burn, were granted in the late 15th century by King James III of Scotland to the Bannatyne family, descendants of the Bannatynes of Kames on Bute. Their Kelly Castle stood on a cliff edge on the north side of the ravine, about 500m upstream from the sea, and was the setting for the song &quot;The Carle of Kellyburn Braes&quot; collected by Robert Burns. The castle burnt down in 1740, and was not rebuilt.
The land on the north side of the bay to the west of what became the turnpike road, identified as Lower Finnock, was part of the adjoining Shaw Stewart Ardgowan Estate. This densely wooded area had valuable salmon fishing rights, the only dwelling was &quot;Wemyss Cottage&quot; occupied by a fisherman. In the late 18th century, ihe Ardgowan Estate feued an area for houses to Mr. Orkney of Rothesay, who built four identical villas facing the bay, off an access road (Wemyss Bay Road) extending west from the main road; they are shown in John Ainslie&#x27;s 1796 survey which also records the names Wemyss Bay and Wemyss Point. These villas, the only houses in the bay for many years, were let to Glasgow merchants and came to be known as New Glasgow.

===Wallace&#x27;s &quot;marine village&quot;===
In 1792 the Glasgow merchant John Wallace, owner of extensive estates in Jamaica with sugar plantations and slaves, bought the Kelly Estate. In 1793 he had a red sandstone mansion called Kelly House built on the hillside up from the road, looking over the bay (this was later painted white). About this time the Wemyss Bay Hotel was built on the east side of the main road, near the junction to the road serving the villas; a building is shown there on Ainslie&#x27;s map.

In 1803 his son Robert Wallace of Kelly inherited the Kelly Estate, and began major improvements, including a large picture-gallery extension to Kelly House. In 1814 he exchanged his land at North Finnock with Shaw Stewart of Ardgowan to gain the Lower Finnock area adjoining Wemyss Bay, so that his estate boundary on both sides of the road was on a line immediately north of what became Ardgowan Road. He also bought land which he exchanged with the Earl of Eglinton to extend the Kelly Estate across the Kelly Burn into Ayrshire, incorporating the Auchindarroch area of upper Skelmorlie. In 1832 Wallace became Greenock&#x27;s first MP, and he played a significant part in introduction of the Uniform Penny Post. He had a row of houses built on the west side of the turnpike road between Inverkip and Wemyss Bay, and named the development Forbes Place after his wife&#x27;s maiden name, Forbes, of Craigievar.

Wallace planned the expansion of Wemyss Bay into a &quot;Marine Village&quot; of 200 villas, with facilities including three churches, hotel, Academy, hot baths, reading room and billiards room, terraced walks featuring a fountain and grass promenade, bowling green, curling pond, and quoiting ground. His plans included a harbour and a steamboat quay. In 1846 the Jamaican estates Wallace had inherited were devalued, and he lost his wealth. He resigned as MP, and sold the Kelly Estate to an Australian merchant named James Alexander.
An 1847 guide book described how &quot;in passing Wemyss Point, we come upon &quot;Wemyss Bay&quot; or &quot;New Glasgow&quot;, which from its sheltered situation, the number of beautiful localities admirably adapted for building sites, and which indeed we understand had been purchased of Mr. Wallace by Mr. Alexander, with the view of building villas thereon, will no doubt become an important rival to its neighbouring watering places. There is already a row of neat villas and cottages stretching from the port, and occasionally an elegant mansion. We are now within sight of Kelly House, the seat of R. Wallace, Esq., M.P.&quot;.

Whiting Bay pier was constructed to the west of the original villas. Alexander went bankrupt after only a few years, and in 1850 his creditors sold the estate in two roughly equal portions; Kelly went to James Scott of Glasgow, Wemyss Bay to Charles Wilsone Brown.

===Wemyss Bay estate and railway===
Charles Wilsone Brown did a great deal to develop the bay, selling ground for feuing. By 1855 there were 36 villas, and he got Castle Wemyss, designed by Robert William Billings, built on the hillside above Wemyss Point. In 1860 he sold his estate on to George Burns, recently retired as a partner in the Cunard Line. Burns had Wemyss House, designed by James Salmon built (near Undercliff) near the north end of the bay. His son John Burns took over Castle Wemyss and had it dramatically enlarged to a design by Billings.
In November 1862 work began on the Greenock and Wemyss Bay Railway. The original plan was for a station in the grounds of the &quot;Clutha&quot; villa at the start of Undercliffe Road, with a short walk along to Whiting Bay pier, but objections were raised by the Burns family. James Scott sold ground from the Kelly Estate to the railway, and the line crossed a bridge over the road to extend down the coast over a beach which Wallace&#x27;s 1845 plan had identified as &quot;Bathing Bay&quot;. The railway opened in May 1865 with its stone-built terminus station at a new pier near the Kelly Burn. The Whiting Bay pier had been repaired after damage by a hurricane in February 1856, it was finally wrecked by a storm at the end of 1865.
Further development introduced bigger, more complex, houses. Of the four original villas, two were taken down as the site for a larger house, one replaced by a villa which may have been designed by Billings and was later remodelled by John Honeyman. Only one still shows something of the original design and scale. In 1887 George Burns had the episcopal Inverclyde Church built at Undercliffe Road in memory of his wife. This church was designed by J.J. Burnet.

===James Young of Kelly===
In 1867 Scott sold the Kelly estate to James Young, who had become a wealthy industrialist by inventing paraffin, and was known from then as James Young of Kelly. After his wife Mary died in April 1868, he continued living at Kelly House with his family.
Since college in Glasgow in 1836, Young had been a friend and supporter of David Livingstone. After the news of the explorer&#x27;s death, he arranged for Livingstone&#x27;s assistants Chuma and Susi to visit Britain in 1874. They arrived after the funeral, and following a period at Newstead Abbey helping Horace Waller with Livingstone&#x27;s &quot;Last Journals&quot;, they reached Kelly in June. Young questioned them closely about the hut in which Livingstone had died, and as grass in fields was similar to that in Africa, they made a facsimile of the one they had built at Ilala. A photo of this informed the book illustrator. They also replicated the &quot;kitanda&quot; they had made to carry Livingstone after he became too weak to walk. On a later visit to Livingstone&#x27;s relatives at Hamilton they made another hut. Wrench made a colourised photograph postcard of &quot;Livingstone&#x27;s Hut, Wemyss Bay&quot;.

The original Kelly House was replaced by a mansion designed by William Leiper, built further up the hill in 1890. This Kelly House was destroyed in a fire in 1913. Attempts were made to blame suffragettes, but research indicates faulty electrical wiring was a more likely cause. The house remained a burnt out ruin for several years. A caravan park now occupies the estate, with its facilities building on the site of the 1890 mansion.

===Other notable buildings===

A memorial on the shore road recalls &#x27;The Gaiter Club&#x27;, whose members included Anthony Trollope, Lord Kelvin, Lord Palmerston and the Earl of Shaftesbury.

Neither Castle Wemyss nor James Salmon&#x27;s Wemyss House remain, having been demolished in the 1980s and 1940s respectively. Also gone is J.J. Burnet&#x27;s episcopal Inverclyde Church, which stood on the shore road of Undercliff Road and was demolished in 1970.

The Castle Wemyss estate and adjoining areas had been sold off in the 1960s to property developers and since then the village has grown considerably, albeit largely a dormitory settlement for Greenock and Glasgow. However several of the fine red sandstone properties remain and are now seen as renovation opportunities. There is a butcher, newsagent, cafe and fish and chip shop in the village and a pub and cafe in the extensive railway station buildings.

Walter Smart&#x27;s &quot;Skelmorlie&quot; (1968) provides an account of both Wemyss Bay and Skelmorlie. &quot;Gourock, Inverkip and Wemyss Bay from Old Photographs&quot; (1981) and &quot;Gourock, Inverkip and Wemyss Bay in Old Picture Postcards&quot; (1998) are also of interest. All are currently out of print.
M.E. Spragg released a book in 2018 called &quot;A Walk Through Time at Wemyss Bay&quot;.

<doc id="1071889" wikidata="Q1067470" url="?curid=1071889" title="Red Ball Express">
<text>The Red Ball Express was a famed truck convoy system that supplied Allied forces moving quickly through Europe after breaking out from the D-Day beaches in Normandy in 1944. To expedite cargo shipment to the front, trucks emblazoned with red balls followed a similarly marked route that was closed to civilian traffic. The trucks also had priority on regular roads.

Conceived in an urgent 36-hour meeting, the convoy system began operating on August 25, 1944. Staffed primarily with African-American soldiers, the Express at its peak operated 5,958 vehicles that carried about 12,500 tons of supplies a day. It ran for 83 days until November 16, when the port facilities at Antwerp, Belgium, were opened, enough French rail lines were repaired, and portable gasoline pipelines were deployed.

==History==
Use of the term &quot;Red Ball&quot; to describe express cargo service dated at least to the end of the 19th century. Around 1892, the Santa Fe railroad began using it to refer to express shipping for priority freight and perishables. Such trains and the tracks cleared for their use were marked with red balls. The term grew in popularity and was extensively used by the 1920s.

The need for such a priority transport service during World War II arose in the European Theater following the successful Allied invasion at Normandy in June 1944. To hobble the German army&#x27;s ability to move forces and bring up reinforcements in a counter-attack, the Allies had preemptively bombed the French railway system into ruins in the weeks leading up to the D-Day landing.

At the time of the landing, traditional French ports were mostly inoperable and, after supporting the troops of the Allied invasion, the Normandy beaches needed to then become the makeshift port that would supply the march toward Germany. The temporary piers and docks known as Mulberry harbours that would create the port had been towed from England and had, by the end of June, unloaded 170,000 vehicles, of fuel and 500,000 tons of supplies. Some 28 Allied divisions needed constant resupply. During offensive operations, each division consumed about 750 tons of supplies per day (about 100 pounds per man) totaling about 21,000 tons in all. The only way to deliver them was by truck – thereby giving birth to the Red Ball Express.

At its peak, it operated 5,958 vehicles and carried about 12,500 tons of supplies per day. Colonel Loren Albert Ayers, known to his men as &quot;Little Patton&quot;, was in charge of gathering two drivers for every truck, obtaining special equipment, and training port battalion personnel as drivers for long hauls. Able-bodied soldiers attached to other units whose duties were not critical were made drivers. Almost 75% of Red Ball drivers were black.

Over 36 hours of planning, 132 already existing military trucking operations were combined into a truck force composed primarily of 2.5 ton GMC “Jimmy’s” and 1.5 ton Dodges. The Dodge trucks had a reputation for reliability. The GMCs were prone to breakdown, but were available in greater numbers. The larger concept of the Express and its routing would be the work of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, based on a French model (and would be an influence in Eisenhower’s role in the development of the U.S. Interstate Highway System in the 1950s).

To keep supplies flowing without delay, two routes were opened from Cherbourg (Cherbourg-en-Cotentin since 2016) to the forward logistics base at Chartres. The northern route was used for delivering supplies, the southern for returning trucks. Both roads were closed to civilian traffic.

The Red Ball was at the center of a number of other named supply tracks. The Green Diamond operated in the region of Cherbourg; the White Ball from Le Havre to Paris; the Lions Express between Bayeux and Brussels; and the ABC Express eastward from Antwerp.

Only convoys of at least five trucks were allowed, escorted in front and behind by a jeep. In reality, it was common for individual trucks to depart Cherbourg as soon as they were loaded. It was also common to disable the engine governors to travel faster than .

Convoys were a primary target of the German Luftwaffe but by 1944 German air power was so reduced that even these tempting and typically easy targets were rarely attacked. The biggest problems facing the Express were maintenance, finding enough drivers, and lack of sleep for the overworked truckers.

The most problematic natural enemy of the Express was mud. The trucks used wheels that could be easily overwhelmed, and efforts to escape could burn out transmissions while dried mud could immobilize their brakes. 

To control traffic and provide security for the route, the 793rd Military Police Battalion, activated December 1942, was sent to the Red Ball from August through December 1944. The early beginnings of the battalion are commemorated on the distinctive unit insignia, with two red balls on a diagonal line of yellow, with a field of green behind (green and gold are the colors of the U.S. Army Military Police).

<text>Claudio Sillero-Zubiri is an Argentine-born British zoologist. He is a Professor of Conservation Biology at Oxford University&#x27;s WildCRU, the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, and Bill Travers Fellow at Lady Margaret Hall. He is the Chair of the IUCN/SSC Canid Specialist Group, and Chief Scientist of the Born Free Foundation. He is internationally recognized for his work with carnivore conservation, and in particular the endangered Ethiopian wolf (&quot;Canis simensis&quot;).

He studied at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata, then obtained his Ph.D. at Oxford University in 1994 with a study on the behavioural ecology of the Ethiopian wolf. Academic interests are the behavioural ecology of carnivores, conservation biology, population biology and disease dynamics, with a particular interest in the Canidae.

His work includes the conservation of endangered species, protected areas management, and wildlife surveys for 35 years spanning four continents. In 1998 he received the Whitley Award for Animal Conservation from the Royal Geographical Society for his work in Ethiopia.

Becoming increasingly involved in the relationships between protected areas and their surrounding rural communities, he is now working with biodiversity conservation policies and practices, particularly in South America, India and Ethiopia.

His work with the IUCN Canid Specialist Group began in 1995 assisting with various conservation programmes and coordinating the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP). He is the Chair of the Canid Specialist Group, and Editor of the &quot;Canid Biology and Conservation&quot; journal. He is also active in several other IUCN Specialist Groups.

Prof Sillero is frequently a keynote speaker at the annual Wildlife Conservation Network expo.

<doc id="1071950" wikidata="Q1125439" url="?curid=1071950" title="Conformal fuel tank">
<text>Conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) are additional fuel tanks fitted closely to the profile of an aircraft that extend the endurance of the aircraft.

==Advantages==
CFTs have a reduced aerodynamic penalty compared to external drop tanks, and do not significantly increase an aircraft&#x27;s radar cross-section. Another advantage CFTs provide is that they do not occupy ordnance hardpoints like drop tanks, allowing the aircraft to carry its full payload.

==Disadvantages==
Conformal fuel tanks have the disadvantage that, unlike drop tanks, they cannot be discarded in flight, because they are plumbed into the aircraft and so can only be removed on the ground. As a result, they will impose a slight drag-penalty and minor weight gain on the aircraft even when the tanks are empty, without any benefit. They can also impose slight g-load limits, although not always an absolute issue: the CFTs on the F-15E actually allow the same maneuverability without g-limitations.

==Examples==
===Conformal fuel tanks===
*F-15C Eagle/F-15E Strike Eagle/F-15EX Eagle II
:F-15C entered service with CFT capability. Initially known as FAST packs (Fuel And Sensor Tactical), each unit carried an additional of fuel, while retaining hardpoints for four AIM-7F Sparrow missiles or bombs, some on the FAST packs. They were first tested on the F-15B in 1974. All U.S. F-15Es, and Strike Eagle export variants such as the Israeli and Singapore models, are fitted with CFTs under the wing outside the engine intake and require modification to fly without them. The FAST pack was originally intended to carry a navigational and targeting infrared sensor system (thus &quot;Fuel And Sensor&quot;); however, the F-15 simply began carrying LANTIRN pods for ground-attack missions instead.

*F-16C/D Block 50/52+, F-16E/F Block 60, F-16 V Block 70/72 and F-16I &quot;Sufa&quot;
:Export aircraft for Greece, Chile, Israel, Poland, Pakistan, Turkey, Singapore, Morocco, Egypt and the UAE are plumbed for carriage of two CFTs mounted atop the aircraft near the wing root. Together they hold , 3050lb of fuel.
*Dassault Rafale
:Two CFTs were first tested by Dassault in April 2001.
*Mikoyan MiG-29SMT – MiG-29S (Product 9.13)- Mikoyan MiG-35
:One CFTs in a further enlarged spine.
*Eurofighter Typhoon

<doc id="1071969" wikidata="Q6636594" url="?curid=1071969" title="List of river borders of U.S. states">
<text>Because of its unique history, many of the boundaries of the political divisions of the United States were artificially constructed (rather than permitted to evolve and drawn using natural features of the landscape). Therefore, many U.S. states have straight lines as boundaries, especially in the West. However, there are many partial state boundaries, particularly in the Midwest, Northeast, and South, that are defined by rivers; in fact, only four mainland states (Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming) completely lack any borders defined by rivers or waterways, as well as Hawaii whose borders are the islands.

== The rule of the thread of the channel and its exceptions ==

River boundaries are typically defined by the &quot;thread of the channel&quot; (the river&#x27;s thalweg, usually in the approximate middle of the river&#x27;s channel), under a rule that the United States inherited from England, where it applies to boundaries between counties. In the United States, there are at least six exceptions, however, where the boundary is one bank of the river rather than the thread of the channel:

* The boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont is the west bank of the Connecticut River. This was established as the eastern boundary of New York by a grant of King Charles II in 1664. It was disregarded by Governor Benning Wentworth of New Hampshire, who treated the New Hampshire Grants west of the river as a &quot;de facto&quot; part of New Hampshire during the years 1649–1764, but King George III put an end to that in 1764. In August 1781, the Continental Congress decided it would recognize the then largely unrecognized state of Vermont, which had been organized in defiance of New York, on condition that Vermont would agree to certain boundaries. In 1782, the legislature of Vermont agreed, but nonetheless Vermont was not admitted to the Union until 1791. In 1933, citing the 1782 legislation, the United States Supreme Court denied the petition from the state of Vermont to make the boundary the thread of the channel.
* The boundaries between Kentucky and West Virginia and the three states to their north – Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois – is based on the historical northern bank of the Ohio River. In 1763, Britain defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War, whose North American theater was called the French and Indian War. At that time, Canada, which had been a French colony, became a British colony, and Parliament made the north bank of the Ohio the southern boundary of Canada. The river was thus included in the district of Kentucky, which was then a part of Virginia. In January 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Ohio v. Kentucky&quot; that the state line is the low-water mark of the Ohio River&#x27;s north shore as of Kentucky&#x27;s admission to the Union in 1792. Because both damming and natural changes have rendered the 1792 shore virtually undetectable in many places, the exact boundary was decided in the 1990s in settlements among the states.
* The boundary between Delaware and New Jersey north of 39° 30&#x27; north latitude is the east bank of the Delaware River.
* The boundary between Delaware and New Jersey south of a certain point is the east bank of the Delaware River, rather than the thread of the channel.
* The boundary between Maryland and Virginia is the south bank of the Potomac River. This also applies both to the border between Maryland and West Virginia (from Harper&#x27;s Ferry to the source of the Potomac near the Fairfax Stone) since the latter was at one point part of Virginia, and to the border between Virginia and Washington, D.C., since the capital was established from a section of Maryland property.
* The boundary between Alabama and Georgia, south of West Point, Georgia, is the west bank of the Chattahoochee River at the mean water mark. This was established in an 1860 Supreme Court ruling, &quot;Alabama v. Georgia&quot;.

<doc id="1071971" wikidata="Q10375211" url="?curid=1071971" title="Susto">
<text>Susto (, ) is a cultural illness primarily among Latin American cultures. It is described as a condition of &quot;chronic somatic suffering stemming from emotional trauma or from witnessing traumatic experiences lived by others&quot;.

==Symptoms==

Among the indigenous peoples of Latin America, in which this illness is most common, susto may be conceptualized as a case of spirit attack. Symptoms of susto are thought to include nervousness, anorexia, insomnia, listlessness, fever, depression, and diarrhea.

==Treatment==
Treatments among indigenous people are natural. Some natural treatments to susto consist of using plants as medicine; sweating out the toxins; and massaging to encourage blood flow. Prayer is a big part of the treatment of susto. In addition to prayer, healing rituals are also used, some of which include sweeping and giving gifts.

==Classification==
Susto may be a culturally dependent variation of the symptoms of a panic attack, which is distinct from anxiety and depressive disorders.

<text>Trygve Magnus Haavelmo (13 December 1911 – 28 July 1999), born in Skedsmo, Norway, was an economist whose research interests centered on econometrics. He received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1989.

== Biography ==
After attending Oslo Cathedral School, Haavelmo received a degree in economics from the University of Oslo in 1930 and eventually joined the Institute of Economics with the recommendation of Ragnar Frisch. Haavelmo was Frisch&#x27;s assistant for a period of time until he was appointed as head of computations for the institute. In 1936, Haavelmo studied statistics at University College London while he subsequently traveled to Berlin, Geneva, and Oxford for additional studies. Haavelmo assumed a lecturing position at the University of Aarhus in 1938 for one year and then in the subsequent year was offered an academic scholarship to travel abroad and study in the United States. During World War II he worked with Nortraship in the Statistical Department in New York City. He received his PhD in 1946 for his work on The Probability Approach in Econometrics.

He was a professor of economics and statistics at the University of Oslo between 1948–79 and was the trade department head of division from 1947 to 1948. Haavelmo acquired a prominent position in modern economics through his logical critique of a series of custom conceptions in mathematical analysis.

In 1989, Haavelmo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics &quot;for his clarification of the probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of simultaneous economic structures.&quot;

Haavelmo resided at Østerås in Bærum. He died on 28 July 1999 in Oslo.

==Legacy==
Judea Pearl wrote &quot;Haavelmo was the first to recognize the capacity of economic models to guide policies&quot; and &quot;presented a mathematical procedure that takes an arbitrary model and produces quantitative answers to policy questions&quot;. According to Pearl, &quot;Haavelmo&#x27;s paper, &#x27;The Statistical Implications of a System of Simultaneous Equations&#x27;, marks a pivotal turning point, not in the statistical implications of econometric models, as historians typically presume, but in their causal counterparts.&quot; Haavelmo&#x27;s idea that an economic model depicts a series of hypothetical experiments and that policies can be simulated by modifying equations in the model became the basis of all currently used formalisms of econometric causal inference. (The biostatistics and epidemiology literature on causal inference draws from different sources.) It was first operationalized by Robert H. Strotz and Herman Wold (1960) who advocated &quot;wiping out&quot; selected equations, and then translated into graphical models as &quot;wiping out&quot; incoming arrows. This operation has subsequently led to Pearl&#x27;s &quot;do&quot;-calculus and to a mathematical theory of counterfactuals in econometric models. Pearl further speculates that the reason economists do not generally appreciate these revolutionary contributions of Haavelmo is because economists themselves have still not reached
consensus of what an economic model stands for, as attested by profound disagreements among econometric textbooks.

<text>Blackfriars Theatre and Arts Centre is a theatre and community centre situated in Spain Lane, Boston, Lincolnshire, England. The building is a remaining part of a mediaeval friary.

==Building==
Blackfriars Theatre and Arts Centree is Grade II* listed. The two-storey building was the refectory of a Dominican friary that was &quot;heavily restored and altered&quot; in 1963 when an eastern gable was rebuilt with casement windows added. The interior retains a 17th-century staircase, although not in its original position. &quot;Pevsner&quot; describes the building as a long &quot;Friars Hall&quot;, running on an east to west axis with its upper floor previously the refectory. At the Suppression of the Monasteries material from the Friary was used to repair sea walls.

Blackfriars Friary was formed some time during the 13th Century. The first written record is from 1288 when it was noted that the friary had been rebuilt after being destroyed by fire. In 1300 the friary housed a total of 29 friars. The surviving building was converted into a theatre in 1965.

Blackfriars is said to be haunted by a friar, who hides sharp objects left by theatregoers under the stage.

==Use==
The centre&#x27;s first professional director was appointed in 1980, but today it is completely run and managed by local volunteers with the help of a full-time theatre technician.. It comprises a theatre with a 230-seat auditorium, a foyer gallery, a revue bar, and an art studio.

In former days the arts centre provided art classes, including night classes in still life, life drawing, screen printing, needlework and photography. It included various residences and numerous outreach workers throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

Groups which use the arts centre currently include the Boston Playgoers, BOS Musical Theatre Group, and Cutwater Theatre Group. There is also a very active Theatre Academy for children from 4 to 19, and a number of other organisations meet here including U3A, Ballet schools, and Lithuanian Community Groups. Rooms are available for hire.

The building hosts performances, workshops, classes and other activities, and has a rolling art exhibition, generally featuring local artists, which is changed monthly.

Stump Radio was established at the centre with help from Spalding&#x27;s Tulip Radio, and broadcast during July and August 2006, and in 2007. The station is now Endeavour FM, presenting news, music and community events through local presenters.

<text>Jason Truby (born June 1, 1973) is an American guitarist. He began his career in 1989 with Living Sacrifice as lead guitarist. He was also a member of P.O.D., but has also performed with Phil Keaggy, David Beegle, Ashley Cleveland and her husband Kenny Greenberg, and was a guest performer with Phil Keaggy&#x27;s band Glass Harp at the First Annual Denver Guitar Festival.

==History==

===Living Sacrifice===
In 1989, Truby joined Living Sacrifice with the other members being Bruce Fitzhugh, DJ Johnson, and Lance Garvin.

In 1991, Living Sacrifice&#x27;s self-titled debut was released on R.E.X. Records. In 1992, Living Sacrifice released their second album, &quot;Nonexistent&quot;.

In 1994, the band released a third album, &quot;Inhabit&quot; Living Sacrifice signed onto Solid State Records seeking to widen their audience. In 1995, Johnson left the band and was replaced by Truby&#x27;s older brother, Chris.

Living Sacrifice recorded &quot;Reborn&quot;, their Solid State debut, in 1997. The band started to play a mix of groove metal and metalcore. &quot;Reborn&quot; is considered the most influential of all Living Sacrifice records. In 1998, both Truby brothers left the band and were eventually replaced by Rocky Gray and Arthur Green.

===P.O.D.===
In 2003, P.O.D. lacked a guitarist after former band member Marcos Curiel parted with the band amidst controversy. Truby was available at the time and wrote and recorded the band&#x27;s single, &quot;Sleeping Awake&quot;, for &quot;The Matrix Reloaded Soundtrack album&quot;. He became a full-time member soon afterward.

The band released its first album with Truby, &quot;Payable on Death&quot;, in November 2003. It was the first time the band discarded its rap metal style, which sparked much controversy. Despite the new style, the album has sold over one million copies worldwide.

Truby also wrote the song &quot;Truly Amazing&quot; with P.O.D. for &quot;The Passion of the Christ: Songs&quot; album, which won a GMA Dove Award.

In 2005, POD released the &quot;Warriors 2 EP &quot;.

The second P.O.D. album with Truby, &quot;Testify&quot;, was produced by Glen Ballard and released in January 2006, including Katy Perry on background vocals on the song &quot;Goodbye for Now&quot;. Later that year, P.O.D. released its Greatest Hits album, which was Truby&#x27;s last work with the band.

On December 30, 2006, Truby left P.O.D.

===Solo===
Truby&#x27;s first solo album was &quot;String Theory&quot; (2004), an acoustic album. Truby released his second album, also instrumental, &quot;Waiting on the Wind&quot; on November 20, 2007. On July 26, 2008, Truby announced a third solo acoustic album, &quot;Finding the Quiet&quot;, released on November 25. Truby completed his debut rock album, &quot;Entropy&quot; in 2009. In 2011, he released an acoustic Christmas album entitled &quot;The Greatest Love&quot;.

Truby produced a compilation album in 2012 for a non-profit adoption and foster care organization called &quot;Project Zero&quot;. This album entitled &quot;Grafted&quot; featured Truby, Stu G from Delirious?, Sonny Sandoval from P.O.D., Cheri Keaggy, Phil Keaggy, Steve Dean, Tiffany Thornton, Geoff Moore, Willet, The Roys (2010 bluegrass band of the year), Caitlin Evanson, Sean Michel.

In 2012, Truby released an acoustic driven vocal album called &quot;Our Time Here&quot; a fingerstyle album with songs featuring artist Phil Keaggy.

Truby&#x27;s instrumental, &quot;Passages&quot;, was released in 2013 and features Phil Keaggy. 2016 Truby was commissioned to do an instrumental guitar album, &quot;Hymns&quot;, consisting of his fingerstyle arrangements of ancient hymns. It has been distributed to cancer treatment centers to give to patients and families undergoing cancer treatments.

Truby is currently working on an instrumental Christmas album.

<text>Mondsee (&quot;Moon Lake&quot;) is a lake in the Upper Austrian part of the Salzkammergut and near the larger Attersee. Its southwestern shore marks the border between the states of Upper Austria and Salzburg and also between the Northern Limestone Alps in the south and the Sandstone zone of the northern Alps. The Drachenwand (&quot;Dragonwall&quot;) is a large cliff face over the southern shore of the lake. Mondsee is one of Austria&#x27;s last privately owned lakes. In August 2008, owner Nicolette Wächter announced it was up for sale.

In 1864, remains of neolithic pile dwellings were discovered in the lake.

Mondsee likely derives its name from the old noble family name &quot;Mannsee&quot;.

==New species discovered in Lake Mondsee==
Two bacterial strains isolated from Lake Mondsee were recognized as new species and described as &quot;Polynucleobacter cosmopolitanus&quot; and &quot;Polynucleobacter duraquae&quot;, respectively. Both species are non-pathogenic and dwell in the lake as part of its bacterioplankton.

==Fish community of Lake Mondsee==
Fish living in the lake:
* esox
* lake trout
* brown trout
* rainbow trout
* The lake char became locally extinct in the last quarter of the 20th century
* European eel
* carp
* burbot
* whitefish

==Mondsee in fiction==

Ian Fleming mentions the Mondsee in one of his James Bond novels, &quot;Thunderball&quot;. In chapter six, Blofeld reports to the members of SPECTRE that their German unit has successfully retrieved (in secret) Himmler&#x27;s hoard of jewels from Lake Mondsee.

Arno Geiger&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Beneath Drachenwand Mountain&quot; is set mainly in Mondsee.

<doc id="1071991" wikidata="Q5897583" url="?curid=1071991" title="Hooding">
<text>Hooding is the placing of a hood over the entire head of a prisoner. Hooding is widely considered to be a form of torture; one legal scholar considers the hooding of prisoners to be a violation of international law, specifically the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, which demand that persons under custody or physical control of enemy forces be treated humanely. Hooding can be dangerous to a prisoner&#x27;s health and safety. It is considered to be an act of torture when its primary purpose is sensory deprivation during interrogation; it causes &quot;disorientation, isolation, and dread.&quot; According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, hooding is used to prevent a person from seeing, to disorient them, to make them anxious, to preserve their torturer&#x27;s anonymity, and to prevent the person from breathing freely.

In 1997, the United Nations Committee Against Torture had concluded that hooding constituted torture, a position it reiterated in 2004 after the committee&#x27;s special rapporteur had &quot;received information on certain methods that have been condoned and used to secure information from suspected terrorists.&quot;

Hooding is a common prelude to execution.

==Modern history==
In the first half of the twentieth century, hooding was rarely used. During World War II, the Gestapo used it especially in the Breendonk prison in Belgium. It became more popular after World War II as a means of &quot;stealthy torture,&quot; since it makes public testimony more difficult; the victim can testify only with difficulty as to who did what to them. In the 1950s, hooding was used in South Africa and French Algeria; in the 1960s, in Brazil and Franco&#x27;s Spain, in the 1970s, in Northern Ireland, Chile, Israel, and Argentina; and since then in a great number of countries.

In some cases, hooding was accompanied by white noise, such as in Northern Ireland; such techniques used by British troops followed up on research done in Canada under the direction of Donald O. Hebb.

==Documented use of hooding==

===Argentina===
After the 1989 attack on La Tablada Regiment, during the presidency of Raúl Alfonsín, the military reacted violently and again hooded prisoners; its methods were called &quot;an immediate return to the methodology used during the dictatorship.&quot;

===Honduras===
Battalion 3-16, the unit of the Honduran Army which carried out assassinations and tortured political opponents in the 1980s, was trained by interrogators from the CIA and from Argentina, and made up in part of graduates of the School of the Americas. Hooding was taught to Battalion 3-16 by Argentineans, who used a hood made of rubber called &quot;la capucha&quot;, which induced suffocation.

===Israel===
In Israel, Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, uses hooding systematically (more systematically than the IDF), according to reports published by Human Rights Watch, who interviewed Palestinian detainees who had been hooded for extensive periods (four to five days at a time throughout their detention). They complained about hoods being dirty, having difficulty breathing, and suffering from headaches and pain in their eyes. The object, according to Human Rights Watch, wasn&#x27;t so much the inability of victims to recognize their torturers, but to increase &quot;psychological and physical pressure.&quot; According to Amnesty International&#x27;s influential report &quot;Torture in the Eighties&quot;, hooding and other forms of ill-treatment became widespread again after the resignation of Menachem Begin in 1984.

Israeli troops are accused of using hooding in prisons in for instance Tulkarm (where 23-year-old Mustafa Barakat died while in custody, most of which he spent hooded), Ashkelon (death of 17-year-old Samir Omar) and Gaza (death of Ayman Nassar); many deaths in Israeli detention centers involved hooded prisoners, such as Husniyeh Abdel Qader, who &quot;was held in solitary confinement with her hands cuffed behind her back and her head in a dirty bag during the first four days of her detention.&quot; In turn, Palestinian authorities in the West Bank were accused of the same practice in 1995, according to media reports and organizations such as B&#x27;Tselem.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the United Kingdom, hooding, one of the so-called &quot;five techniques,&quot; was used as a means of interrogation during The Troubles, the period of violent conflict in Northern Ireland from 1966 to 1998, and notably so during Operation Demetrius. In the prison Long Kesh, now known as Maze, prisoners were subjected to hooding in 1971: &quot;throughout their days and nights of interrogation torture, their heads were kept covered by thick, coarse cloth bags.&quot; Complaints quickly led the Heath government to order troops in 1971 &quot;not to use hoods when interrogating prisoners.&quot; On behalf of fourteen of these, the Republic of Ireland filed suit against the British government at the European Commission of Human Rights, which found in 1976 that the British had been guilty of torturing political dissidents. When, in March 1972, Direct rule was instated, the practice did not cease altogether, and at the end of 1972 the European Commission of Human Rights accepted a second case on behalf of victims of the practice. In March 1972, the Parker report had concluded that the five techniques were in fact illegal under British law; on the same day the report was published, Prime Minister Edward Heath announced in the House of Commons that the techniques &quot;will not be used in future as an aid to interrogation.&quot;

While the practice was thus officially banned since 1972, reports of its use by British troops appeared during the Iraq War. Hooding was discovered to have been applied in 2003 and 2004 to Iraqi prisoners who were held by American troops and questioned by intelligence officers from the British Secret Intelligence Service. Baha Mousa, an Iraqi civilian, died in British custody after being hooded and beaten.

===United States===

Most notably in recent history, hooding occurred at the Abu Ghraib prison and at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In 2003 already, Amnesty International had reported such abuse in a memorandum sent to Paul Bremer, then the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority.
Delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross also protested the hooding of U.S. prisoners.

In cases of extraordinary rendition by the United States, suspects are usually hooded, apparently as part of &quot;standard operating procedures.&quot; Sometimes, however, suspects are abused and interrogated as well. The famous photograph of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed taken not long after his capture, where he appears &quot;dazed and glum,&quot; was taken moments after his hood was removed; he was hooded continuously throughout the first days after his arrest by commandos from the United States and Pakistan.

Resistance to hooding is a standard element of the Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape training undergone by elite US military.

===Uruguay===
According to a 1989 report by the &quot;Servicio Paz y Justicia Uruguay&quot;, hooding was the most common form of torture practiced in military and police centers in the 1970s.

<text>AP Films or APF (renamed Century 21 Productions in 1966) was a British independent film production company of the 1950s until the early 1970s. The company became internationally known for its imaginative children&#x27;s action-adventure marionette television series – most significantly &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; – produced for British ITV network companies Associated-Rediffusion, Granada, ABC and ATV. At its height, the company employed more than 200 staff.

==Origins==
Established in 1957 by editor-director Gerry Anderson and cinematographer Arthur Provis, following the liquidation of their employer Polytechnic Films, AP Films was set up, named after the initials of Anderson and Provis. They took with them producer Reg Hill, cinematographer John Read and secretary, then known as Sylvia Thamm. Thamm would later become Anderson&#x27;s second wife. The company was created with the intention of it becoming a conventional film production house.

With no commissions and funds running low, APF were approached with an offer of collaboration with children&#x27;s author Roberta Leigh and her colleague Suzanne Warner to produce the puppet TV series &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot; for Associated-Rediffusion. With some reluctance, the company took on the commission and the programme was such a success that it immediately led to a further collaboration with Leigh for the first series of &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot;.

In 1959, Provis left the company amicably following disagreements with Anderson over future strategy. APF then went on to make its first wholly independent production of &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, a puppet Western created by Barry Gray who was better known for his musical contributions to the company&#x27;s productions, for Granada Television. In 1960, APF made a live-action thriller feature film, &quot;Crossroads to Crime&quot;, for Anglo-Amalgamated, and a series of TV advertisements for a London travel company.

==Success==
Returning to filming with puppets, but with a change in direction and the adoption of a technique by which mouth movements were synchronised with recorded dialogue in a process that Anderson dubbed &quot;Supermarionation&quot;, the company then filmed its best-known productions – a succession of futuristic science-fiction action-adventure series, all made for ATV. &quot;Supercar&quot; was made between 1960 and 1961, &quot;Fireball XL5&quot; in 1962, &quot;Stingray&quot; in 1964 – the first British children&#x27;s TV series to be filmed exclusively in colour – and &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; between 1964 and 1966. Following the completion of &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, ATV owner Lew Grade had purchased the company, becoming managing director, with the Andersons, Hill and Read remaining as directors.

==Productions==
The following were made under the AP Films name.
* &quot;The Adventures of Twizzle&quot;, 1957–1958 (Associated-Rediffusion)
* &quot;Torchy the Battery Boy&quot;, 1960 (ABC)
* &quot;Four Feather Falls&quot;, 1960 (Granada)
* &quot;Crossroads to Crime&quot;, 1960 (film)
* &quot;Supercar&quot;, 1961–1962, (ATV)
* &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, 1962–1963 (ATV)
* &quot;Stingray&quot;, 1964–1965 (ATV)
* &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; (first series), 1965–1966 (ATV)

==Century 21==
Following completion of the first season of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, AP Films was renamed Century 21 Productions to align it with its growing merchandising sister companies Century 21 Merchandising, Century 21 Toys, Century 21 Music, and Century 21 Publications. In the second half of the 1960s, the company expanded its studios, increasing the number of filming stages to seven.

All Century 21&#x27;s productions featured an opening ident of a field of pale concentric circles, which form a moving, off-centre tunnel against a blue background, into which flies a yellow dart which penetrates through a gap in the Century 21 logo already situated in front, at which point everything stops moving. This was accompanied by a typical Barry Gray string glissando and the caption &quot;A Gerry Anderson Century 21 Television/Cinema Production&quot; – the logo being part of that. This sequence was first used for the two &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; films that followed the series (&quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; – premiering 12 December 1966 – and &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; in 1968), and two more Supermarionation series for ATV, &quot;Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons&quot; (broadcast between 1967 and 1968) and &quot;Joe 90&quot; in (1968–69).

A live-action film, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot;) followed in 1969. That same year, Century 21 made its final puppet TV series, the rarely seen &quot;The Secret Service&quot; (which combined live action with puppetry), after which its puppet studios closed and its merchandising and publication subsidiaries contracted rapidly. Its first and only all-live action TV series, &quot;UFO&quot; (1970), proved to be its last production. Although a second series of &quot;UFO&quot; was planned, the project failed to progress beyond substantial pre-production work.

==Group Three==
At the start of the 1970s, on completion of their contracted tenure stemming from Lew Grade&#x27;s 1962 buy-out, the Andersons and Reg Hill went on to form another company titled Group Three Productions (named after the three founders), with Gerry as chairman. Although no longer owned by Grade, the company maintained a close professional relationship with him. It produced &quot;The Protectors&quot; and the first series of &quot;&quot;.

==Other notable people==
Although most notable for its link with Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the company features other notable figures in its history. Barry Gray composed and arranged the scores for all Anderson&#x27;s independent productions up to and including the first series of &quot;&quot; in 1975. Second unit director Brian Johnson would go on to become a leading special effects figure in film production in the United States. Christine Glanville, already an experienced puppeteer, joined the expanding company in the early days to supervise puppet operations, progressing into production management toward the end of Century 21&#x27;s existence.

Derek Meddings joined the staff in the earliest days as a special effects assistant, painting miniatures on scenery, but ultimately became the department&#x27;s director, developing significant advances in miniature effects technology. Prior to his death in 1995, he would later rise to the position of one of the foremost special effects experts in the film industry.

<text>In geometry, a median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, thus bisecting that side. Every triangle has exactly three medians, one from each vertex, and they all intersect at the triangle&#x27;s centroid. In the case of isosceles and equilateral triangles, a median bisects any angle at a vertex whose two adjacent sides are equal in length.
The concept of a median extends to tetrahedra.

==Relation to center of mass==
Each median of a triangle passes through the triangle&#x27;s centroid, which is the center of mass of an infinitely thin object of uniform density coinciding with the triangle. Thus, the object would balance at the intersection point of the medians. The centroid is twice as close along any median to the side that the median intersects as it is to the vertex it emanates from.

==Equal-area division==

Each median divides the area of the triangle in half, hence the name, and hence a triangular object of uniform density would balance on any median. (Any other lines that divide triangle&#x27;s area into two equal parts do not pass through the centroid.) The three medians divide the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area.

===Proof of equal-area property===
Consider a triangle &quot;ABC&quot;. Let &quot;D&quot; be the midpoint of formula_1, &quot;E&quot; be the midpoint of formula_2, &quot;F&quot; be the midpoint of formula_3, and &quot;O&quot; be the centroid (most commonly denoted &quot;G&quot;).

By definition, formula_4. Thus formula_5 and formula_6, where formula_7 represents the area of triangle formula_8 ; these hold because in each case the two triangles have bases of equal length and share a common altitude from the (extended) base, and a triangle&#x27;s area equals one-half its base times its height.

We have:
:formula_9

:formula_10

Thus, formula_11 and formula_12

Since formula_13, therefore, formula_14.
Using the same method, one can show that formula_15.

===Three congruent triangles===
In 2014 Lee Sallows discovered the following theorem:
:The medians of any triangle dissect it into six equal area smaller triangles as in the figure above where three adjacent pairs of triangles meet at the midpoints D, E and F. If the two triangles in each such pair are rotated about their common midpoint until they meet so as to share a common side, then the three new triangles formed by the union of each pair are congruent.

==Formulas involving the medians&#x27; lengths==
The lengths of the medians can be obtained from Apollonius&#x27; theorem as:
formula_16
formula_17
formula_18
where formula_19 and formula_20 are the sides of the triangle with respective medians formula_21 and formula_22 from their midpoints.

These formulas imply the relationships:
formula_23
formula_24
formula_25

==Other properties==

Let &quot;ABC&quot; be a triangle, let &quot;G&quot; be its centroid, and let &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;F&quot; be the midpoints of &quot;BC&quot;, &quot;CA&quot;, and &quot;AB&quot;, respectively. For any point &quot;P&quot; in the plane of &quot;ABC&quot; then 
formula_26

The centroid divides each median into parts in the ratio 2:1, with the centroid being twice as close to the midpoint of a side as it is to the opposite vertex.

For any triangle with sides formula_27 and medians formula_28 
formula_29

The medians from sides of lengths formula_30 and formula_31 are perpendicular if and only if formula_32

The medians of a right triangle with hypotenuse formula_20 satisfy formula_34

Any triangle&#x27;s area &quot;T&quot; can be expressed in terms of its medians formula_35, and formula_22 as follows. If their semi-sum formula_37 is denoted by formula_38 then
formula_39

==Tetrahedron==

A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional object having four triangular faces. A line segment joining a vertex of a tetrahedron with the centroid of the opposite face is called a &quot;median&quot; of the tetrahedron. There are four medians, and they are all concurrent at the &quot;centroid&quot; of the tetrahedron. As in the two-dimensional case, the centroid of the tetrahedron is the center of mass. However contrary to the two-dimensional case the centroid divides the medians not in a 2:1 ratio but in a 3:1 ratio (Commandino&#x27;s theorem).

<text>Gus Edward Zernial (June 27, 1923 – January 20, 2011) was an American professional baseball player. He played as an outfielder in Major League Baseball, most notably for the Philadelphia Athletics with whom he remained when they moved west and became the Kansas City Athletics in 1955.

Nicknamed &quot;[[Ozark Ike]]&quot; after the popular comic strip character, Zernial was one of the most prolific power hitters of the 1950s, joining Hall of Famers Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Larry Doby in the American League for most home runs in the decade.

== Professional career ==

=== Minor leagues ===
Before being called up to the major leagues, Zernial played in the Pacific Coast League, the highly successful minor league circuit. In the HBO series &quot;When It Was a Game&quot;, Zernial states that he took a pay cut to come to the majors.

=== Major leagues ===
After he hit 29 homers for the White Sox in 1950, Zernial was sent to the Athletics in a trade that brought Minnie Miñoso to Chicago in 1951. That year Zernial led the league in home runs (33), runs batted in (129), extra base hits (68), and outfield assists (17). In 1952 he hit 29 homers with 100 RBIs, and in 1953 he hit 42 home runs with 108 RBIs.

Zernial was the first major leaguer to hit four home runs in the month of October during the regular season, since 1900, which he accomplished during a doubleheader on October 1, 1950. Ron Kittle would become the second player to do this in 1985.

Zernial and Al Zarilla teamed up in April 1951 to become the only players whose last names started with &quot;Z&quot; to play together in the same outfield. Zernial and Zarilla played left and right field, respectively, as part of a White Sox outfield unit in four games before Zernial was traded to the Philadelphia A&#x27;s at the end of April.

Sal Maglie, former star pitcher for the New York Giants, wrote that Zernial had a &quot;pretty big&quot; strike zone, due to his stand-up posture when he was at the plate.

=== Career overview ===
An aggressive fielder, Zernial twice (1949 and 1954) broke his collarbone while making diving catches. He finished his career in Detroit, primarily as a pinch hitter, hitting .323 with 10 home runs in his new role.

Zernial was a career .265 hitter (1093-for-4131) with 237 home runs, 776 RBI, 572 runs, 159 doubles, 22 triples, 15 stolen bases and 383 bases on balls in 1234 games.

Zernial is featured in one of the most unusual baseball cards of all time. His 1952 Topps card shows Zernial holding a bat that has six baseballs attached to it. This photo recognized that he had tied an American League record by hitting six home runs in three consecutive games from May 13–16, 1951. The day after the picture was taken, he hit his seventh home run in a fourth consecutive game.

Zernial has the third most home runs of all time among players whose last name begins with the letter Z. His 237 are third only to Todd Zeile who finished his career with 253 and Ryan Zimmerman who finished his career with 284.

Zernial was the first player to hit three home runs in the final game of a season, a record equalled by Dick Allen in 1968 and Evan Longoria and Dan Johnson in 2012.

In a postscript to his acclaim noted above as the &quot;new DiMaggio&quot;, Zernial figured, coincidentally, in Joe DiMaggio meeting his legendary future wife Marilyn Monroe. The &quot;handsome&quot; young Zernial was chosen to pose with rising star Monroe in a movie-studio publicity shot. DiMaggio was so struck by Marilyn in the photo, as well as so envious of Zernial&#x27;s opportunity, that he asked the rival outfielder how to reach Marilyn.

== Later honors ==
When the Oakland Athletics played the Philadelphia Phillies for the first time in interleague play in June 2003 at Veterans Stadium, the Phillies invited former Philadelphia A&#x27;s Eddie Joost and Zernial to the games and recognized them prior to the first game.

== Death ==
Zernial was diagnosed with cancer in 1990. He died on January 20, 2011, from complications related to congestive heart failure.

<text>Mondsee is a town in the Vöcklabruck district in the Austrian state of Upper Austria located on the shore of the lake Mondsee. The town is home to the medieval Mondsee Abbey, whose cloister church was used for the site of the wedding in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

The town is also known for the SKGLB railway museum and for prehistoric pile-dwelling (or stilt house) settlements at Mondsee, which are part of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

One of its past sons is Alexander Strähuber (1814–1882), the history painter and book illustrator, and from 1865 to 1882 professor at the Munich Royal Academy of Fine Arts.

<doc id="1072032" wikidata="Q261446" url="?curid=1072032" title="Bloody Roar">
<text>is a series of fighting games created by Hudson Soft and developed together with Eighting. The series has been published by multiple companies including Activision, Konami, SCEA, and Virgin Interactive. Konami holds the rights to the franchise after Hudson Soft was absorbed into the former company in 2012.

The series began in 1997 under the name &quot;Beastorizer&quot;. The game incorporates anthropomorphism as its main gameplay feature and theme, where the playable characters are &quot;Zoanthropes&quot; (the name comes from the clinical term, &#x27;zoanthropy&#x27;, which is similar to lycanthropy), humans who have the ability to transform into half-human, half-animal creatures (anthropomorphic animals). This form is called a &quot;beast&quot; form, and &quot;Zoanthropes&quot; are capable of switching between their &quot;human&quot; and &quot;beast&quot; forms. The game would appear under the name &quot;Bloody Roar&quot; when it was ported to the PlayStation in 1998, which would become the permanent title for the series thereafter.

&quot;Bloody Roar&quot; has kept somewhat the same controls over the series. A button each for both punch and kick, the beast (transform/attack) button, and a fourth button that has been either a throw button, a block button, an evade button (introduced for some characters in &quot;Bloody Roar 4&quot;), or a rave button (an early version of Hyper Beast form in the original &quot;Bloody Roar&quot; only).

&quot;Bloody Roar&quot; is a 3D fighting game series in the same vein as &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, &quot;Soulcalibur&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. Although some characters have remained mostly identical throughout all five games, others have changed vastly. For example, Yūgo has a new moveset with many different moves in Extreme/Primal Fury and 4 compared to his original in previous games, but Bakuryū has stayed almost the same apart from a few extra moves which are relevant to the games&#x27; evolution over time.

 in &quot;Bloody Roar&quot; have standard moves and command moves. Standard moves are combination style moves from fighting games such as &quot;Tekken&quot;, where the player must press different buttons to create &quot;combos&quot;, sometimes pressing the directional pad in one of eight directions at the same time. Command moves are special moves that require a rolling technique with the directional pad while inputting certain commands, like &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. Each character has fourteen &quot;suggested&quot; combination techniques listed in the manuals for each game, most of these can vary in many different ways, allowing around forty to seventy combination techniques with each character. Every character also has at least eight command moves, which can be incorporated into cancel points for standard moves or combos. There are around twenty to forty cancel points in each character&#x27;s combo palette. These cancel points, when utilized with command moves, can then be cancelled once more, allowing the player to begin a new strategy with adequate timing. As well as this, the combat system has two types of dodging techniques: a heavy and light block that spans over three parts of the body, instead of the typical two in most fighting games; and &quot;Scratch&quot; techniques, which can break guards from dead angles and is a series of command counters, throws, and vanishing attacks. &quot;Bloody Roar 4&quot;, the latest game in the series, may be the most complex one with the largest fighter roster of eighteen characters, and the ability to earn more moves by earning experience in &quot;Career Mode&quot;.

&quot;Bloody Roar&quot; was adapted into a manga drawn and written by Maruyama Tomowo. It was originally published in Monthly Shōnen Jump. A few themes were used from the games, but the scenarios and characters in Maruyama&#x27;s version were completely new, although a few of his characters looked similar to the characters from the games. The main stars of the manga were a lone wolf zoanthrope named Fang and a rabbit girl zoanthrope named Mashiro. Their adventures had them fighting out-of-control zoanthropes and trying to stop an evil creature from being released by a gathering of talismans. The manga was released in two volumes during 2001.

Concept artwork and illustrations for the first three games were drawn by artist Naochika Morishita (known under the pseudonym CARAMEL MAMA), and he also created the art used for the in-game cutscenes in 2 and 3.

For their 2000 single &quot;My Console&quot;, the Italian eurodance group Eiffel 65 included Bloody Roar along with several other popular PlayStation titles in the song&#x27;s lyrics.

Yūgo appears as a playable character in the 2003 crossover fighting game &quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&quot;.
