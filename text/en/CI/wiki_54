<text>Robert McCormick (22 July 1800 – 25 October 1890) was a British Royal Navy ship&#x27;s surgeon, explorer and naturalist.

==Life==
McCormick was born in Great Yarmouth, England. His father, also Robert McCormick, was a ship&#x27;s surgeon from Ballyreagh, County Tyrone. From 1821 McCormick studied medicine in London under Sir Astley Cooper at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and Guy&#x27;s Hospital, gaining his diploma in 1822, then in 1823 he joined the Royal Navy as an assistant surgeon. He served in the West Indies for two years before being invalided home. Following a year in a North Sea cutter, he became assistant surgeon on the &quot;Hecla&quot; under William Edward Parry in 1827, joining Parry&#x27;s expedition searching for the North Pole. Three commissions abroad followed, and in each case he felt unappreciated and was &quot;invalided home&quot;, which in Naval terms implied personal dissatisfaction or disagreements.

Near the start of 1830 he took half-pay leave and attended the natural history lectures of Robert Jameson at the University of Edinburgh. This was encouraged by the Navy, McCormick felt that &quot;only Scotchmen have any chance with the head of our department.&quot; McCormick also attended classes there in medical practice, midwifery, some botany and chemistry, and took tuition in surgery from John Lizars. By May 1831 McCormick had returned to London, where Francis Beaufort was looking for suitable personnel for a survey expedition to South America. McCormick appeared well qualified, and was recruited as ship&#x27;s surgeon for the second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; under Captain Robert FitzRoy. McCormick expected this position meant the usual duties as a naturalist, as did Jameson who wrote to him in November giving detailed advice on how to make the most of the &quot;numberless opportunities&quot; this &quot;exploratory expedition&quot; would provide &quot;for the advancement of natural history&quot;. McCormick fully expected to put together a sizeable natural history collection with significant social value, gaining him fame as an exploring naturalist.

While the preparations of the &quot;Beagle&quot; progressed in late October, McCormick met Charles Darwin who had been given an unofficial place on board as a self-funded gentleman naturalist who would be a companion to Captain FitzRoy. Darwin wrote telling his university tutor John Stevens Henslow about McCormick: &quot;My friend the Doctor is an ass, but we jog on very amicably: at present he is in great tribulation, whether his cabin shall be painted French Grey or a dead white— I hear little excepting this subject from him&quot;. When the voyage got under way, their first landfall was at St. Jago in the Cape Verde Islands in January 1832. McCormick and Darwin walked into the countryside together, and Darwin, influenced by Charles Lyell&#x27;s ideas on geology, found the surgeon&#x27;s approach old-fashioned: &quot;He was a philosopher of rather an antient date; at St Jago by his own account he made &quot;general remarks&quot; during the first fortnight &amp; collected particular facts during the last.&quot; McCormick became increasingly frustrated as FitzRoy took Darwin onshore, leaving McCormick behind without opportunities for collecting. The last straw came at Rio de Janeiro in April 1832, when FitzRoy arranged for Darwin&#x27;s collection to be packaged and sent back to England. McCormick was invalided home, and as he recalled in his memoirs of 1884, &quot;Having found myself in a false position on board a small and very uncomfortable vessel, and very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed in the way of my getting on shore and making collections, I got permission from the admiral in command of the station here to be superseded and allowed a passage home in H.M.S. &quot;Tyne&quot;.&quot;)

McCormick subsequently became surgeon on the James Clark Ross&#x27;s Antarctic expedition between 1839 and 1842. 
On the latter voyage most of the naturalist&#x27;s duties were performed by Joseph Dalton Hooker, with McCormick concentrating on geology and bird collecting, assisted by Thomas Abernethy.

On 26 August 1844 McCormick was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.

McCormick also led an unsuccessful search party in search of John Franklin in the &quot;Forlorn Hope&quot;. His autobiography was entitled &quot;Voyages of Discovery in the Arctic and Antarctic Seas and around the World&quot; (1884).

==Legacy==
The south polar skua (&quot;Stercorarius maccormicki&quot;) was named for him by Howard Saunders. McCormick shot the type specimen on 12 January 1841, on Possession Island, Victoria Land, Antarctica.

Devon Island&#x27;s Macormick Bay, near the area he explored in search of Franklin&#x27;s lost expedition, is named in McCormick&#x27;s honor.
MacCormick Fjord in NW Greenland was named after him by Robert Peary.

<text>The following is a list of current, former, and confirmed future facilities of Ford Motor Company for manufacturing automobiles and other components. Per regulations, the factory is encoded into each vehicle&#x27;s VIN as character 11 for North American models, and character 8 for European models.
The River Rouge Complex manufactured most of the components of Ford vehicles, starting with the Model T. Much of the production was devoted to compiling &quot;knock-down kits&quot; that were then shipped in wooden crates to Branch Assembly locations across the United States by railroad and assembled locally, using local supplies as necessary. A few of the original Branch Assembly locations still remain while most have been repurposed or have been demolished and the land reused. Knock-down kits were also shipped internationally until the River Rouge approach was duplicated in Europe and Asia.

<doc id="1061842" wikidata="Q672973" url="?curid=1061842" title="Follow-on">
<text>In cricket, a team who batted second and scored significantly fewer runs than the team who batted first may be forced to follow-on: to take their second innings immediately after their first. The follow-on can be enforced by the team who batted first, and is intended to reduce the probability of a drawn result, by allowing the second team&#x27;s second innings to be completed sooner and to avoid a team who were significantly better in their first innings from having to declare their second innings closed so they can attempt to win the match, giving the inferior team an undeserved advantage.

The follow-on occurs only in those forms of cricket where each team normally bats twice: notably in domestic first class cricket and international Test cricket. In these forms of cricket, a team cannot win a match unless at least three innings have been completed. If fewer than three innings are completed by the scheduled end of play, the result of the match can only be a draw.

The decision to enforce the follow-on is made by the captain of the team who batted first, who considers the score, the apparent strength of the two sides, the conditions of weather and the pitch, and the time remaining.

The rules governing the circumstances in which the follow-on may be enforced are found in Law 14 of the Laws of Cricket.

==Example==
During the India national cricket team&#x27;s 2017 tour of Sri Lanka, in the Second Test, India won the toss and batted first. Sri Lanka batted second, failed to score within 200 runs of India&#x27;s first innings score, and were forced to follow-on. India won the match by an innings and 53 runs.

# India scored 622/9, dec
# Sri Lanka scored 183, all out
# Sri Lanka scored 386, all out

This contrasts with the order of innings batted in the First Test of the same series, where Indian captain Virat Kohli had the right to enforce the follow-on, but declined. India won the match by 304 runs.

# India scored 600
# Sri Lanka scored 291, all out
# India scored 240/3, dec
# Sri Lanka scored 245, all out

==Minimum lead==
Law 14 of the Laws of Cricket considers the length of the match in defining the minimum lead required for the defending team to enforce the follow-on:
* In a match of five days or more, a side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs has the option of requiring the other side to follow-on.
* In a match of three or four days, a lead of at least 150 runs.
* In a match of two days, a lead of at least 100 runs.
* In a one-day match, a lead of at least 75 runs.

When the start of a match is delayed by one or more full days, e.g., due to bad weather, the score lead required to enforce the follow-on is reduced accordingly.
However, when a match duration is shortened after it has started, the score lead required to enforce the follow-on remains unchanged.

==Enforcement==
The follow-on is not automatic; the captain of the leading team decides whether to enforce it. Conventional theory suggests the follow-on is almost always enforced. In his classic text &quot;The Art of Captaincy&quot;, Mike Brearley deals with the issue in a single paragraph, and finds the advantages overwhelming.

# The main reason to enforce the follow-on is to prevent a draw. Batting last, the chasing side can bat cautiously and use up time to draw the match rather than lose, and the follow-on gives them more time, making that strategy more difficult.
# Enforcing the follow-on can also increase the pressure on the chasing team, since they have already posted an inferior score, and the state of the pitch often deteriorates as a match progresses.

However, there are several reasons for not enforcing the follow-on:
# Most simply, it is tiring for bowlers to bowl for two consecutive innings, and it can be more difficult to dismiss a team in their second innings than it was in their first innings. During the first test of the 1958 series between Pakistan and West Indies on 17–23 January, West Indies batting first declared at 579/9 and Pakistan replied with 106 all out. After Pakistan was asked to follow-on on the third day of the six-day match, Mohammed Hanif held his ground for 970 minutes, scoring 337 runs, forcing a draw.
# Declining to enforce the follow-on reduces the defending team&#x27;s probability of losing. Already with a substantial lead in the first innings, the defending team can score enough runs and/or use up enough time to give the chasing team no chance of victory. This does increase the probability of a drawn result, but it can also demotivate the chasing team who have nothing to play for.
# Refusing to enforce the follow-on can be a strategic decision based on the current situation of a multi-game series such as The Ashes. A team who only needs a draw to achieve their series goal may refuse to enforce the follow-on so they can bat out the remaining time when a draw is sufficient to win or retain the series trophy. This can happen when a team is leading the series by the number of games left to play including the current game, e.g. leading an Ashes series by one win during the fifth and final game of a series.
# It is usually a disadvantage to bat last, when the pitch has deteriorated and favours spin bowling.
In recent years there has perhaps been a trend against enforcing the follow-on in Test cricket: former England captain Andrew Strauss on several occasions took his second innings straight away. It has, though, had some notable successes, for instance at Lord&#x27;s in the 2009 Ashes series. Here, Australia were 210 behind on first innings but did not follow on; England batted again, set Australia a highly unlikely victory target of 522, and won the game easily. For their part, Australian captains Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting were also notably reluctant to enforce the follow-on, although that was perhaps more to do with wanting to allow Shane Warne to bowl on a deteriorating pitch later in the game. Michael Clarke only enforced the follow-on once in his career as a captain (during his final match in the 2015 Ashes), even when holding a substantial first innings lead due to the risk of tiring his fast bowlers.

==Victories by sides not made to follow on==
===Test matches===
South Africa v Australia, Kingsmead, 1950

In a four-day Test (with one rest day in the middle of the match), South Africa won the toss, chose to bat, and posted 311. The offspinner Hugh Tayfield took 7–23, helping to bundle out Australia for 75, giving South Africa a first-innings lead of 236. South African captain Dudley Nourse elected not to enforce the follow-on owing to forecasts of rain, but in their second innings South Africa folded for 99. Thanks largely to an unbeaten 151 from Neil Harvey, Australia made 336 in 123.6 overs to win by 5 wickets.

ICC Intercontinental Cup, Afghanistan v Canada, Sharjah, 2010

Canada won the toss and chose to bat, scoring 566 in their first innings and bowling out Afghanistan for 264 in reply, giving Canada a first-innings lead of 302 runs. Wicketkeeper-captain Ashish Bagai, who retired hurt in Canada&#x27;s second innings, declared with Canada on 191–4 after 40 overs to set Afghanistan a target of 494. The wicketkeeper Mohammad Shahzad made 214* as Afghanistan scored 494–4 to win by 6 wickets.

===First-class matches===
Irani Cup, Rest of India v Mumbai, 2016

Mumbai won the toss and chose to bat, scoring 603 in their first innings and bowling out Rest of India for 306. This gave Mumbai a first-innings lead of 297 runs. However, they declined to enforce the follow on, and were bowled out for 182 in their second innings. Rest of India, set 479 to win, chased down the total with 4 wickets to spare. Faiz Fazal, the opener for Rest of India, made 127 in the winning effort.

==Victories by sides following-on==
===Test matches===
There have been only four occasions in Test cricket where a team that was forced to follow-on won the match. Incidentally, Australia lost the first three of these matches. New Zealand defeated England in the fourth.

====1894–95 Ashes====
In the first innings of the First Test at Sydney, Australia had scored a massive 586 (Syd Gregory 201, George Giffen 161) and then dismissed England for 325. England responded with 437, leaving them ahead by 176. However, at stumps on the fourth day, Australia were 113 for 2 and looked to be the winners. But heavy rain fell overnight (in this era, pitches were not covered between days of play), and the next morning, England&#x27;s slow left-arm bowlers, Bobby Peel and Johnny Briggs, were unplayable on the sticky wicket. England dismissed Australia for 166, winning by 10 runs, and went on to win the series 3–2.

====Botham&#x27;s Test: England v Australia, Headingley, 1981====
In 1981, England&#x27;s Ian Botham was performing poorly as captain against the touring Australians. The Australian team was rated as second only to the great West Indies team of the time, and contained a formidable pace attack in the form of Dennis Lillee, Terry Alderman and Geoff Lawson. After a loss and a draw in the first two Test matches of the summer&#x27;s six-test Ashes series, Botham resigned the captaincy.

Mike Brearley, the captain Botham had replaced, resumed the reins for the third Test, at Headingley. This started out very badly: Australia scored 401 (John Dyson 102; Kim Hughes 89; but Botham took 6–95), and asked England to follow on after bowling them out for 174 (Lillee took 4–49; Lawson 3–32). The one bright point in the innings came from Botham, who top scored with 50 (his first since he had been made captain 13 matches earlier). In the second innings, Botham came to the crease with England on 105 for 5, still 126 behind. Matters did not improve: Geoffrey Boycott and Bob Taylor soon followed, and with England 135 for 7 and still 92 runs behind an innings defeat looked likely.

By all accounts, everyone on both sides thought the game was lost. Ladbrokes famously offered 500–1 against England winning the Headingley Test. When Graham Dilley joined him at the crease, Botham reportedly said, &quot;Right then, let&#x27;s have a bit of fun.&quot; Botham, with able support from the lower order, went on to make 149 not out, and gave England a slender lead of 129. The next day a fired-up Bob Willis took 8 for 43, and Australia slumped to 111 all out.

====India v Australia, Eden Gardens, 2001====

Australia, who had won their 16 previous Test matches, including the first of the three-Test series between the two teams, had scored 445 in the first innings of the second Test and restricted India to 171; only V. V. S. Laxman (59) and Rahul Dravid reached 25 runs. The only other bright spot for India was the bowling of Harbhajan Singh, who took 7 for 123, including a hat-trick (Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne). Australia then enforced the follow-on.

Laxman came to the crease just before the end of Day 3 and proceeded to change the course of both the match and the series by hitting 281, at that time the record for an Indian Test batsman. He did most of his damage partnered with Dravid, who hit 180; the two were at the crease for the entire fourth day. India progressed to 657/7 in their second innings (a lead of 383), declared shortly before lunch on the final day (giving Australia insufficient time to reach the total, thus securing at least a draw). By tea, Australia had scored 161/3, and a draw appeared the most likely result. Then, within minutes, Australia lost five wickets for 8 runs in a span of 31 balls. Harbhajan took the first two wickets in the same over, followed quickly by three wickets from Sachin Tendulkar. Australia proceeded to fall for 212 in the second innings and India won the match. Despite Harbhajan&#x27;s prodigious bowling—6 for 73 to go with his seven-wicket haul from the first innings—Laxman was named man of the match. India&#x27;s 171-run victory was by far the largest of the four Test victories by the team following on (both of England&#x27;s winning margins had been fewer than 20 runs), and it was the only time in history that a side has been able to declare the follow-on innings and still win. India under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly went on to win the 3rd test, and hence the series, with Laxman contributing half-centuries in both innings and Harbhajan, who was named as man of the series for taking 32 wickets.

====New Zealand v England, Wellington, 2023====
New Zealand became only the third team in history to win a Test after following on, winning by one run after wrestling the game away from England on a dramatic final day in Wellington. Neil Wagner was the catalyst with a short-ball assault during the afternoon session, and he capped the comeback by taking the final wicket amid rising tension at Basin Reserve. England declared at 435/8 in their first innings with Joe Root and Harry Brook scoring 150+ each. New Zealand&#x27;s first innings ended at 209 with a rear guard action from Tom Blundell and Captain Tim Southee limiting the damage to a 226 run deficit. Following on, New Zealand scored a mammoth 483 in 162 overs, with 4 half-centuries and a Kane Williamson 132, leaving England with a target of 258. England had trouble putting together a significant partnership, and when Ben Foakes departed at 251/9, the tailenders Jack Leach and James Anderson could only add 5 more runs before Anderson glanced a leg side delivery through to the keeper to lose the game. Controversially, the ball prior should have been called a wide, as a bouncer flew well over the batsman&#x27;s head, and one run extra could have potentially seen the match end as the third ever tied Test.

===First-class matches===

====22-24 July 1847 match between MCC and Surrey====
In 1847 at The Oval, the MCC were bowled out for 91 in reply to Surrey&#x27;s 197 in a three-day match. Under the Laws in force, the MCC were required to follow-on, and scored 216 before bowling Surrey out for 101 to win by nine runs.

====County Championship – Warwickshire v Hampshire, 1922====
In 1922 at Edgbaston, Hampshire were bowled out for 15 in just 53 balls and 40 minutes in reply to Warwickshire&#x27;s 223 in a three-day match; Hampshire&#x27;s total is the seventh-lowest score for a completed first-class innings. After Warwickshire enforced the follow-on, Hampshire famously scored a mammoth 521 before bowling Warwickshire out for 158 to win by 155 runs. Hampshire&#x27;s first innings total of 15 remains the lowest score in the county&#x27;s history, and the lowest for a completed innings by a team that won the match as of 2022.

*1787: First known instance; at that time, it was the custom for any side behind on first innings to bat again regardless of the deficit (follow-on in the case of the side batting second).
*1835: Added to Laws, made compulsory after a deficit of 100 runs.
*1854: Compulsory after a deficit of 80 runs.
*1894: Compulsory after a deficit of 120 runs.
*1900: Made optional after a deficit of 150 runs in a three-day match, 100 runs in a two-day match, and 75 runs in a one-day match.
*1946: Experimental Law allowed declaration on the first day after batting side had scored 300.
*1951: A side could declare at any time.
*1957: Above made Law. Declarations were not to be made as a result of agreement with the opposing captain.
*1961: In abeyance in the County Championship, but restored in 1963.
*1980: Optional after a deficit of 200 runs in a five-day match, 150 runs in a three- or four-day match, 100 runs in a two-day match, and 75 runs in a one-day match.

==In other sports==
Some informal baseball games use variations of the follow-on.

<text>Little Cheverell is a small village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. In some sources the Latinized name of Cheverell Parva is used, especially when referring to the parish. The village lies on the B3098 Westbury–West Lavington road, which skirts the northern edge of Salisbury Plain, and is about east of Westbury and south of Devizes.

Like its neighbour to the west, Great Cheverell, the parish is narrow from east to west, but extends south onto higher ground where its southernmost part has been within the Imber Range military training area since 1943.

The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

== History ==
A large settlement of 111 households was recorded at &quot;Chevrel&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086.

The population of the parish peaked in the 19th century, with 295 recorded at the 1841 census; numbers in the 20th century were in the range 150 to 200.

The Stert and Westbury Railway was built across the parish by the Great Western Railway Company in 1900, providing routes from London to Weymouth or Taunton. There was a station called Lavington, just beyond the east boundary of the parish, by the bridge over the A360. The line remains open but the station was closed in 1967 and no local stations remain; the nearest are Pewsey and Westbury.

Hawkswell House, south of the church, was built in brick in 1914–1920 for Robert Awdry, to designs of Arthur Campbell Martin (who also designed additions to Dauntsey&#x27;s School, West Lavington). Awdry, a cricketer and county councillor who was chairman of Wiltshire County Council from 1946 to 1949, lived here until the house was commandeered by the War Office in 1941.

== Parish church ==
There was a church at Little Cheverell by 1291. The parish church was earlier called St Nicholas&#x27;s but has been dedicated to St Peter since at least 1850. The squat west tower is from the 13th century, while the rest of the 14th-century church was rebuilt (and increased in length) in 1850 to designs of T. Cundy.

From 1915 onwards, the benefice of Cheverell Parva was united at various times with Great Cheverell (Cheverell Magna) and/or West Lavington. Today the parish is part of the Benefice of the Lavingtons, Cheverells &amp; Easterton.

<text>The .38 Short Colt, also known as .38 SC, is a heeled bullet cartridge intended for metallic cartridge conversions of the cap and ball Colt 1851 Navy Revolver from the American Civil War era.

Later, this cartridge was fitted with a diameter inside-lubricated bullet in the range.

==Case==
Visually, it resembles a .38 S&amp;W but the case dimensions are slightly different. The .38 Short Colt case is the parent to the .38 Long Colt and .38 Special.

Remington is one of the few producers of this cartridge today with a 125 gr LRN bullet. Magtech produces this grain weight and Ten-x manufactures a 95 gr load, as well as blanks.

<doc id="1061855" wikidata="Q117691" url="?curid=1061855" title="FICON">
<text>FICON (Fibre Connection) is the IBM proprietary name for the ANSI &quot;FC-SB-3 Single-Byte Command Code Sets-3 Mapping Protocol&quot; for Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. It is a FC layer 4 protocol used to map both IBM&#x27;s antecedent (either ESCON or parallel Bus and Tag) channel-to-control-unit cabling infrastructure and protocol onto standard FC services and infrastructure. The topology is fabric utilizing FC switches or directors. Valid rates include 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Gigabit per second data rates at distances up to 100 km.

FICON was introduced in 1998 as part of System/390 G5 IBM mainframe. In July 2013, FICON replaced ESCON in new zEnterprise BC12/EC12, and later models,

because of FICON&#x27;s technical superiority (especially its higher performance) and lower cost.

== Protocol internals ==
Each FICON channel port is capable of multiple concurrent data exchanges (a maximum of 32) in full duplex mode. Information for active exchanges is transferred in Fibre Channel sequences mapped as FICON &quot;Information Units&quot; (IUs) which consist of one to four Fibre Channel frames, only the first of which carries 32 bytes of FICON (FC-SB-3) mapping protocol. Each FICON exchange may transfer one or many such IUs.

FICON channels use five classes of IUs to conduct information transfers between a channel and a control unit. They are: Data, Command, Status, Control, and lastly Link Control. Only a channel port may send Command or Command and Data IUs, while only a control unit port may send Status IUs.

As with prior IBM mainframe channel protocols, there is a concept of a channel to control unit &quot;connection&quot;. In its most primitive form, a connection is associated with a single channel program. In practice, a single channel program may result in the establishment of several sequential connections. This normally occurs during periods where data transfers become dormant while waiting for some type of independent device activity to complete (such as the physical positioning of tape or a disk access arm). In such cases, the connection may be closed by action of the device&#x27;s control unit with the signaling of appropriate status. When the control unit is ready to resume such an interrupted connection, it signals the channel to reconnect and resume the interrupted channel program. By closing temporarily dormant connections, channel and control unit facilities may be better utilized to serve other active channel programs and certain protocol timeouts that might otherwise occur may be avoided.

FICON uses two Fibre Channel exchanges for a channel control unit connection one for each direction. So while a Fibre Channel exchange is capable of carrying a command and response on a single exchange, and all other FC-4 protocols work that way, the response to a FICON IU is always on a different exchange from the IU to which it is a response. The two exchanges that implement a connection are called an exchange pair (Note that the concept of the two exchanges being related exists only at the FC-4 layer). While other FC-4s have a single &quot;data structure type&quot; code that characterizes their IUs in Fibre Channel frame headers, FICON has two. One is for IUs from channel to control unit; the other for control unit to channel.

Except for some initialization dialogue that requires stronger synchronization, FICON uses Fibre Channel class of service 3 (Datagram). Thus, at the Fibre Channel physical (FC-2 and below) level, the communication is connectionless, frames and sequences may arrive out of order, and there is no acknowledgement of arrival. But all of that exists at the FC-4 level.

=== Additional CRC ===
The integrity of customer data carried within one or more IUs is protected by a running 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) contained in the last frame of an IU classified as an ending IU within each data transfer. This is in addition to the standard Fibre Channel CRC used to verify the integrity of each individual FC frame. As such, the FICON CRC has the capability of detecting missing or out of sequence frames/IUs.

== Cables ==
FICON may employ Fibre Channel fiber optic cables with either &quot;short&quot; wavelength (multi-mode; 62.5 or 50 micrometer core) or &quot;long&quot; wavelength (single mode; 9 micrometer core). Long wavelength is used in the majority of applications owing to its superior optical power budget and bandwidth. FICON cannot use &quot;Copper&quot; Fibre Channel cables.

== Usage ==
FICON is used exclusively with computers based on the IBM z/Architecture (current descendant of System/360, System/370, etc.), commonly called mainframes. FICON and its predecessors are the only protocols sufficient to communicate with traditional mainframe peripheral devices, especially for z/OS. However, most mainframe operating systems also support FCP (SCSI command set over Fibre Channel).

FICON is technically quite similar to more popular storage protocols, such as FCP. Both FICON and FCP share levels 1–3 of Fibre Channel specifications. Some administrators argue that FICON offers somewhat easier troubleshooting in mainframe environments, but the inherent technical advantages and disadvantages between FICON and FCP are much alike. Some mainframe-specific setups, such as GDPS, require FICON (or its predecessor ESCON). Mainframe-attached storage, such as IBM&#x27;s System Storage DS8000, often supports both protocols. The storage is divided into fixed block storage volumes (accessed with FCP) and mainframe-specific CKD/ECKD storage volumes (accessed with FICON and/or ESCON).

Other older FICON switching platforms are still in use. These include the McDATA 6064, CNT UMD, and CNT (Inrange) FC/9000. Inrange was acquired by CNT in 2003, CNT was acquired by McDATA in 2005, and in 2007 McDATA was in turn acquired by Brocade Communications Systems. Approximately 80% of FICON directors and switches installed in mainframe environments were Brocade products at the time. McDATA was well established in the mainframe directors space, manufacturing the 9032-3 and 9032-5 ESCON directors for IBM, as well as the FICON Bridge Card. Brocade has many co-patents with IBM for FICON and ESCON technology. Cisco Systems was a relative newcomer to this space, with their first FICON director coming out in 2003.

Other manufacturers producing FICON-compatible equipment include Optica Technologies, and InfoPrint Solutions Company, which offers high-volume printers that can attach via FICON.

<text>Telida (&quot;Tilaya-di&quot; or &quot;Tilayadi’&quot; in Upper Kuskokwim) is an unincorporated community located in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. At the 2010 census the population was 3, unchanged from 2000.

== Geography ==
Telida is located at 63.3832623N, 153.2803835W, on the south side of the Swift Fork (McKinley Fork) of the Kuskokwim River, about by air northeast of McGrath.

The word &quot;Telida&quot; means &#x27;whitefish&#x27; in the Upper Kuskokwim Athabaskan language.

== History ==
Athabascan folklore says that Telida&#x27;s residents are descended from two sisters, survivors of an attack by another Athabascan group, who fled from the McKinley area to Telida Lake where they discovered whitefish at its outlet. The women were later discovered by stragglers from the attacking party, who married the women and settled at the lake. The village of Telida is named after the lake.

The village has been located in three different places. The first village was located about upstream from present-day Telida. It was first visited by United States army explorers in 1899. When the Swift Fork changed course, the village was moved what is now called &quot;Old Telida.&quot; In 1916, some residents moved to the present day site, &quot;New Telida,&quot; about downstream from Old Telida. A Russian Orthodox church, St. Basil the Great, was built in Old Telida in 1918. A roadhouse was also built during this period. In 1920-21, Old Telida was a stopping point on the trail between McGrath and Nenana and hundreds of people used the roadhouse. In 1935, Old Telida flooded and the remaining residents relocated to New Telida.

In 1958, a fire burned an area in which the villagers constructed an airstrip. Many families moved to Takotna during the school year and lived in Telida only during summer months. A school was built in Telida in the 1970s, but the population has declined to almost nothing since.

==Demographics==

Telida first appeared on the 1980 U.S. Census as a census-designated place (CDP). In 1990, it lost that designation and was reclassified as an unincorporated Alaskan Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA).

==Transportation==
Telida Airport (IATA: TLF, FAA: 2K5) is a public use airport serving Telida.

==Education==
It was previously served by the Telida School of the Iditarod Area School District.

The &quot;Telida Current&quot; began publication after the school received a copy machine. It was later published using the Quill, software for literacy

<doc id="1061867" wikidata="Q2902412" url="?curid=1061867" title="Atlit detainee camp">
<text>The Atlit detainee camp was a internment camp established by the authorities of Mandatory Palestine in the late 1930s on what is now the Israeli coastal plain, south of Haifa. Under British rule, it was primarily used to hold Jews and Arabs who were in administrative detention; it largely held Jewish immigrants who did not possess official entry permits. Tens of thousands of Jewish refugees were interned at the camp, which was surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers.

The camp at Atlit now has a museum that covers the history of &quot;aliyah&quot; by non-permitted Jews. It was declared a National Heritage Site by Israel in 1987.

==History==

The camp at Atlit, established by the British government in the 1930s, was surrounded by barbed wire and watchtowers. Many of the detainees during the 1930s and 1940s were Jewish refugees from German-occupied Europe.

At Atlit camp, the men were sent to one side, women to the other. They were sprayed with DDT, then told to undress and enter the showers. In 1939–1948, tens of thousands of Jewish immigrants were interned here, men and women separated by barbed wire. Some internees stayed as long as 23 months.

===WWII (camp active 1939-42)===
Some of the Palestine Germans, including Templers living in their own colonies, who openly supported the Nazis, were declared enemy nationals by the British authorities and were detained at Atlit prior to deportation.

In November 1940, the British authorities decided to send 5000 immigrants to detention camps on Mauritius. One of these deporting ships was the &quot;Patria&quot;. To stop the deportation, the Haganah, the Jewish underground militia in Palestine, exploded a bomb in the ship&#x27;s hold on November 25. The size of the explosive charge had been seriously miscalculated, and the ship sank quickly. On board were 1800 refugees; 216 drowned in the disaster. The survivors from the &quot;Patria&quot; were detained in Atlit and not deported to Mauritius. They were released after a few months.

The &quot;Darien II&quot; arrived with 800 refugees in March 1941. They were detained at the Atlit camp until September 1942, when the camp was shut down.

===Post-WWII British camp (1945-1948)===
The Atlit camp was reopened in 1945 following World War II, as more and more immigrants arrived in Palestine. Most of them were Holocaust survivors from DP camps in Europe who made the journey through the Berihah and Ha&#x27;apala (&quot;Aliya Beth&quot;) clandestine immigration network.

On October 10, 1945, the Palmach (special forces unit of the Haganah) broke into the camp and released 208 detainees, who escaped. Yitzhak Rabin, then a young officer, planned the raid and Nachum Sarig commanded it. Following this event, the British deported immigrants to Cyprus internment camps. These camps operated from 1946 through the establishment of the State of Israel.

===Israel&#x27;s wars (1948-49, 1967-70)===
During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Atlit detainee camp served as a prisoner of war (POW) camp and civil internment camp for local Arabs.

POWs from the 1967 war including soldiers from Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, as well as Lebanese citizens were also held at Atlith camp.

==Museum==
One of the barracks has been restored, with clothes, books, dolls and everyday items donated by former inmates. Also displayed are boards on which prisoners scratched their names and countries of origin in the hopes of finding friends and family members from whom they had become separated during the Holocaust.

<doc id="1061874" wikidata="Q599197" url="?curid=1061874" title="Florian Znaniecki">
<text>Florian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882 – 23 March 1958) was a Polish and American philosopher and sociologist who taught and wrote in Poland and in the United States. Over the course of his work, he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire school of thought in sociology. 

He won international renown as co-author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, &quot;The Polish Peasant in Europe and America&quot; (1918–1920), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as &quot;humanistic coefficient&quot; and &quot;culturalism&quot;.

In Poland, he established the first Polish department of sociology at Adam Mickiewicz University, where he worked from 1920 to 1939. 

His career in the US began at the University of Chicago (1917 to 1919) and continued at Columbia University (1932 to 1934 and 1939 to 1940) and at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (1942 to 1950). 

He was the 44th President of the American Sociological Association (for the year 1954).

==Life==
===Childhood and education===
Florian Znaniecki was born on 15 January 1882 at Świątniki, Congress Poland, a state controlled by the Russian Empire to Leon Znaniecki and Amelia, née Holtz. He received early schooling from tutors, then attended secondary schools at Warsaw and Częstochowa. While in secondary school, he was a member of an underground study group, specializing in history, literature and philosophy. His secondary-school grades were average at best, and he had to repeat a year of school; this was largely due to his extracurricular interest in Polish-language study, which was banned under the Russified school program. As a youth, he wrote some poetry, including a drama, &quot;Cheops&quot; (1903). A poem of his, &quot;Do Prometeusza&quot; (&quot;To Prometheus&quot;), was included in a 1900 anthology; however, neither he in later life, nor literary critics, judged his poetry outstanding.

He entered the Imperial University of Warsaw in 1902, but was soon expelled after taking part in protests against the Russian administration&#x27;s curtailment of student rights. Threatened with conscription into the Imperial Russian Army, he chose to emigrate, and in early 1904 he left Warsaw for Switzerland.

During that period, he was briefly an editor at a French-language literary magazine, &quot;Nice Illustrée&quot; (late 1904 – early 1905); faked his own death; briefly served in the French Foreign Legion in Algeria; and worked at a flea market, on a farm, in a traveling circus, and as a librarian at the Polish Museum in Rapperswil, Switzerland.

In Switzerland, he soon resumed his university studies, first at the University of Geneva (1905–1907), then at the University of Zurich (1907–1908), eventually transferring to the Sorbonne in Paris, France (1908–1909), where he attended lectures by sociologist Émile Durkheim. In 1909, after the death of his supervisor Frédéric Rauh, he returned to Poland, where in 1910 he obtained his PhD degree at Jagiellonian University, in Kraków, under a new supervisor, .

===Early Polish career===
That year he also joined the , in which he would be highly active over the next few years, becoming its vice president in 1913–1914. Much of his early academic work at that time could be classified as philosophy. In 1909, aged 27, he published his first academic paper, &quot;Etyka filozoficzna i nauka o wartościach moralnych&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Ethics and the Science of Moral Values&quot;); a year later, he published &quot;Zagadnienie wartości w filozofii&quot; (&quot;The Question of Values in Philosophy&quot;), based on his doctoral dissertation, and a paper, &quot;Myśl i rzeczywistosc&quot; (&quot;Mind and Reality&quot;). In 1912, he published a new book, &quot;Humanizm i Poznanie&quot; (&quot;Humanism and Knowledge&quot;), and a paper, &quot;Elementy rzeczywistości praktycznej&quot; (&quot;Elements of Practical Reality&quot;). A year later, he published an annotated translation of Henri Bergson&#x27;s &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; and a paper, &quot;Znaczenie rozwoju świata i człowieka&quot; (&quot;The Meaning of World and Human Development&quot;). The year 1914 saw the publication of his papers, &quot;Formy i zasady twórczości moralnej&quot; (&quot;Forms and Principles of Moral Creativity&quot;) and &quot;Zasada względności jako podstawa filozofii&quot; (&quot;The Principle of Relativity as a Foundation of Philosophy&quot;). His works, published in Polish, were well received by the Polish scholarly community and intelligentsia.

Due to his past political activism, he was unable to secure a post at a major university. From 1912 to 1914, he lectured at a novel women&#x27;s institution of higher education, the . During his studies, he had worked at several European institutions dealing with Polish immigrants; he would build on his experiences by becoming involved with the Warsaw-based Society for the Welfare of Émigrés (&quot;Towarzystwo Opieki nad Wychodźcami&quot;), where he worked in 1910–1914. By 1911, he was the Society&#x27;s director and (1911–1912) editor of its journal, &quot;Wychodźca Polski&quot; (&quot;The Polish Émigré&quot;). Znaniecki became an expert on Polish migration, in 1914 authoring for the government a 500-page report, &quot;Wychodźtwo Sezonowe&quot; (&quot;Seasonal Migration&quot;).

===Work with Thomas===

A year earlier, in 1913, Znaniecki had met William I. Thomas, an American sociologist who had come to Poland in connection with his research on Polish immigrants in the United States. Thomas and Znaniecki had begun to collaborate, and soon Thomas invited Znaniecki to come to Chicago to continue work with him in the United States. In July 1914, just on the eve of World War I, Znaniecki left Poland to work with Thomas as a research assistant. From 1917 to 1919, Znaniecki also lectured in sociology at the University of Chicago.

Their work culminated in co-authoring of &quot;The Polish Peasant in Europe and America&quot; (1918–1920), considered a sociology classic. It was his collaboration with Thomas that marked the transition in Znaniecki&#x27;s career from philosopher to sociologist. Znaniecki stayed with Thomas in Chicago until mid-1919, when he moved to New York, following Thomas, who had lost his job at Chicago due to a spurious scandal.

That year Znaniecki published a new book, still mostly philosophical rather than sociological, &quot;Cultural Reality&quot;. Published in English, it was a synthesis of his philosophical thought. In New York, Thomas and Znaniecki carried on research for the Carnegie Corporation on the process of immigrant Americanization. Znaniecki contributed to Thomas&#x27; book, &quot;Old World Traits Transplanted&quot;, and published an anonymous solicited article on that topic in the February 1920 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;.

===Founding Polish sociology===

Poland had regained independence in 1918, following World War I. In 1919, Znaniecki contacted the newly founded Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education, offering to return to Poland if the Ministry could help him secure a chair at a Polish university. He proposed creating a novel Institute of Sociology, but bureaucracy and communication delays resulted in that idea being shelved, and he was offered a philosophy professorship at the newly organized Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.

In 1920, Znaniecki returned to the newly established Second Polish Republic, where at Poznań University he soon became Poland&#x27;s first chair in sociology. He accomplished this by renaming the department, originally &quot;Third Philosophical Department&quot;, to &quot;Department of Sociology and Cultural Philosophy&quot;, doing the same for his chair, and establishing a Sociological Seminary. That same year he also founded the Polish Institute of Sociology (&quot;Polski Instytut Socjologiczny&quot;), the fifth-oldest sociological institute in Europe.

In 1927, his department was officially renamed to &quot;department of sociology&quot;, and in 1930, the department gained authorization to issue degrees in sociology. Also in 1930, the Polish Institute of Sociology began publishing the first Polish sociological journal, &quot;Przegląd Socjologiczny&quot; (The Sociological Review), with Znaniecki its chief editor from 1930 to 1939. That year, the Institute organized Poland&#x27;s first academic sociologists&#x27; conference. Due to his role as founder of so many of its building blocks, Znaniecki is considered as one of the fathers of sociology in Poland.

===Later U.S. career===
Keeping in touch with American sociologists, Znaniecki lectured as a visiting professor at Columbia University in New York City in 1932–34 and during the summer of 1939. That summer ended the Polish stage of his career, as the invasion of Poland and the start of World War II prevented his return to Poland. He was already aboard a ship bound for Poland when his travel was cut short in the United Kingdom. He still briefly considered returning to Poland, where his wife and daughter remained; however, faced with the occupation, he returned to the United States in 1940. His wife and daughter, after briefly being imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, joined him.

With help from American colleagues, Znaniecki obtained an extension of his appointment at Columbia University through mid-1940. He then moved to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and in 1942, obtained American citizenship, allowing him to transition from a visiting to a regular professorship. He taught at the University of Illinois until his retirement, deciding not to return to the communist Polish People&#x27;s Republic, established in the aftermath of World War II, despite the offer of a chair at Poznań University. In 1950, he retired, becoming a professor emeritus.

He was 44th President of the American Sociological Association (for 1954). His presidential address, &quot;Basic Problems of Contemporary Sociology,&quot; was delivered on September 8, 1954 at the Association&#x27;s annual meeting and was later published in the &quot;American Sociological Review&quot;.

He died on March 23, 1958 in Champaign, Illinois. The cause of death was arteriosclerosis. His funeral took place on March 26, and he was buried at Roselawn Champaign Cemetery.

==Family==
In 1906, Znaniecki married a fellow Polish student at the University of Geneva, Emilia Szwejkowska. They had a son, poet and writer , born in 1908. Emilia died in 1915.

The next year, Znaniecki married Eileen Markley (1886–1976). They had one daughter, sociologist Helena Znaniecki Lopata, born in 1925.

==Importance==
Polish sociologist and historian of ideas Jerzy Szacki writes that Znaniecki&#x27;s major contributions include: the founding of sociology in Poland; his work in empirical sociology; and his work in sociological theory. Szacki notes that Znaniecki sought to bridge a number of gaps: between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches; between objectivity and subjectivity; between humanistic and naturalistic methodologies and viewpoints; and between American and European intellectual traditions.

Szacki writes that, while Znaniecki&#x27;s theoretical contributions were subsequently pushed into the background by Talcott Parsons&#x27; &quot;functionalism&quot;, Znaniecki offered the most ambitious sociological theory known to America before Parsons.

Znaniecki&#x27;s most famous work remains &quot;The Polish Peasant in Europe and America&quot; (1918–1920), co-authored with William I. Thomas. His other major works include &quot;Wstęp do socjologii&quot; (An Introduction to Sociology, 1922), &quot;The Method of Sociology&quot; (1934), &quot;Social Actions&quot; (1936), &quot;The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge&quot; (1940) and &quot;Cultural Sciences&quot; (1952).

==Themes==
===Empirical sociology===
Znaniecki&#x27;s contributions to empirical sociology began after, and were influenced by, his collaboration with William I. Thomas. &quot;The Polish Peasant in Europe and America&quot; (1918–1920), a five-volume work which he wrote with Thomas, is considered a classic of empirical sociology. It is a study of Polish immigrants to America, based on personal documents. The work became a landmark study of Americanization — of how new immigrants to the United States &quot;become Americans&quot;.

This work represents Znaniecki&#x27;s most valued contribution to empirical sociology. Most of his other works focused on theory, the only other notable exception being &quot;Miasto w świadomości jego obywateli&quot; (The City in the Consciousness of its Citizens, 1931).

===Sociology: theory and definition===
A key element of Znaniecki&#x27;s sociological theory is his view of sociology in particular, and of the social sciences in general, as a scientific field uniquely different from the natural sciences. Znaniecki defines sociology as a study of social actions. His recommended methodology was analytic induction: analysis of typical case studies, and generalization from them.

Znaniecki&#x27;s theories form a major part of sociology&#x27;s action theory, and his work is a major part of the foundation of humanistic sociology. Another term connected with Znaniecki&#x27;s theories is &quot;systematic sociology&quot; (&quot;socjologia systematyczna&quot;). He sought to create a grand sociological theory, one that would bridge the gap between empirical sociology and more theoretical approaches.

Znaniecki criticized the widespread definition of sociology as the study of society. In Znaniecki&#x27;s culturalist perspective, sociology is a study of culture (though it is not &quot;the&quot; study of culture, as Znaniecki recognized that other social sciences also study culture). His definition of sociology has been described as that of &quot;a cultural science whose function is to study systems of social interaction based upon patterns of values and norms of behaviour, through the use of the humanistic coefficient&quot;, or more simply, &quot;the investigation of organized, interdependent interaction among human beings.&quot; The part of the culture that sociology focused on was that of social relation or interaction.

Znaniecki saw culture as a field separate from nature, but also from individuals&#x27; perceptions. The essence of culture is socially constructed objects. He was one of the first sociologists to begin analyzing personal documents such as letters, autobiographies, diaries, and the like. He considered the analysis of such documents an important part of the humanistic-coefficient method.

Znaniecki saw sociology as an objective, inductive and generalizing science. According to Szacki, Znaniecki viewed sociology as a nomothetic science that should be able to use a methodology similar to that of the natural sciences (however, Znaniecki&#x27;s daughter Helena Znaniecki Lopata, in her introduction to &quot;Social Relations and Social Roles&quot;, contradicts Szacki, writing that, for Znaniecki, sociology was a science &quot;whose subject matter calls for a method different from that of the natural sciences.&quot;). In 1934 he formulated the principle of analytic induction, designed to identify universal propositions and causal laws. He contrasted it with enumerative research, which provided mere correlations and could not account for exceptions in statistical relationships. He was also critical of the statistical method, which he did not see as very useful.

In addition to the science of sociology, Znaniecki was also deeply interested in the larger field of the sociology of science. He analyzed the social roles of scientists, and the concept of a school of thought.

===Four social systems===
According to Znaniecki, sociology can be divided into the study of four dynamic social systems: social action theory, social relation theory, social actors theory, and social groups theory. Znaniecki saw social actions as the foundation of a society, as they give rise to more complex social relations, and he saw this theory as the foundation of all the others. Unlike Max Weber, he did not believe that everything can be reduced to social actions; he was also quite skeptical of any insights coming from the science of psychology, which he held in low esteem.

The four major forms of cooperative interaction, or four social systems, in growing complexity, were:
* social actions (in Polish, &quot;czyny społeczne&quot; or &quot;czynności społeczne&quot;): the most basic type of social fact;
* social relations (in Polish, &quot;stosunki społeczne&quot;): these require at least two persons and a mutual obligation; the study of social relations is the study of norms regulating social actions;
* social personalities (in Polish, &quot;osoby społeczne&quot; or &quot;osobowości społeczne&quot;): the combined picture that emerges from a number of different social roles that an individual has;
* social group (in Polish, &quot;grupa społeczna&quot;): any group which is recognized by some as a separate entity; Znaniecki saw a society as a group of groups, but denied it primacy as an area that the sociologist should focus on (while at the same time recognizing that most sociologists differed on this).

The four-category division described above appeared in his 1934 book, &quot;The Method of Sociology&quot;. By 1958 he had reformulated the division, and was speaking instead of social relations, social roles, social groups, and societies.

===Sociology of culture===
Znaniecki coined the term &quot;humanistic coefficient&quot; for a method of social research by way of data analysis that emphasizes participants&#x27; perceptions of the experience being analyzed. The humanistic coefficient sees all social facts as being created by social actors and as being understandable only from their perspective. Thus the sociologist ought to study reality by trying to understand how others see the world, not (objectively) as an independent observer; in other words, the scientist needs to understand the subject&#x27;s world. While some have criticized this approach as being too close to subjectivism, Znaniecki himself saw it as anti-subjectivist; he observed that social facts such as cultural systems can exist even if no one perceives their existence. He was also skeptical of any value coming from personal, subjective observations, arguing that such observations have value only if they can be objectively described. He argued that the difference between the natural and social sciences lies not in the difference between objective and subjective experiences, but in the subject being studied: for Znaniecki, the natural sciences studied things, and the social sciences studied cultural values.

Znaniecki characterized the world as being caught within two contrary modes of reflection; idealism and realism. He proposed a third way, which he called &quot;culturalism&quot;. His culturalism was one of the founding ideas of modern antipositivist and antinaturalist sociology. The term &quot;culturalism&quot; was introduced into English in his book, &quot;Cultural Reality&quot; (1919), and was translated into Polish as &quot;kulturalizm&quot;; previously Znaniecki had discussed the concept in Polish as &quot;humanism&quot; (&quot;humanizm&quot;).

Elżbieta Hałas has insisted on a gradual evolution of Znaniecki&#x27;s sociology of culture from &quot;Cultural Reality&quot; to &quot;Cultural Sciences&quot;, his most reviewed book, which was published more than thirty years later, in 1952. By that time, Znaniecki saw the cultural order as &quot;axionormative&quot;, a universal concept encompassing “relationships among all kind of human actions” and the corresponding values. Hałas noted that this approach put him at odds with what was the dominant approach of the sociology of culture in the 1950s, whose most authoritative exponents were Americans who regarded Znaniecki&#x27;s approach as typically European and hardly applicable to the analysis of culture in the United States.

===Other themes===
Znaniecki&#x27;s work also touched on many other areas of sociology, such as intergroup conflict, urban sociology, and rural sociology.

==Works==
Znaniecki&#x27;s first academic works, of the 1910s, were more philosophical than sociological in nature; beginning in the 1920s, his works were primarily sociological. His &quot;Cultural Reality&quot; (1919) was a synthesis of his philosophical thought, but the simultaneous publication of his much more popular &quot;The Polish Peasant in Europe and America&quot; (1918–1920) associated his name in academic circles primarily with sociology rather than with philosophy. His early works focused on analysis of culture and strongly criticized the principles of sociological naturalism. Szacki notes a puzzling gap in Znaniecki&#x27;s research: while he was well-read in, and engaged with, most previous and current theories, he largely ignored the works of some notable sociologists of his time such as Max Weber, Vilfredo Pareto and Talcott Parsons. On the other hand, his works engaged closely with those of William I. Thomas, Georg Simmel, Robert E. Park, and Émile Durkheim.

His &quot;The Method of Sociology&quot; first introduced his concept of divisions within subfields of sociology. His most notable works included two books published in the same year (1952): &quot;Modern Nationalities&quot;, and &quot;Cultural Sciences&quot;. The former is an analysis of the evolution of national-culture societies, and the latter presents a theoretical study of the relation between sociology and other sciences. Znaniecki never finished his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Systematic Sociology&quot;, which would eventually be collected and published posthumously in its unfinished but final form as &quot;Social Relations and Social Roles: The Unfinished Systematic Sociology&quot; (1965).

<text>Mummenschanz is a Swiss mask theater troupe who perform in a surreal mask- and prop-oriented style. Founded in 1972 by Bernie Schürch, Andres Bossard (August 9, 1944 – March 25, 1992), and the Italian-American Floriana Frassetto, the group became popular for its play with bizarre masks and forms, light and shadow, and their subtle choreography. The name &quot;Mummenschanz&quot; is German for &quot;mummery&quot;, or a play involving mummers. &quot;Mummer&quot; is an Early Modern English term for a mime artist.

==History==
After studies with Jacques Lecoq in Paris and Roy Bosier in Rome, and following a three-year period of experimentation, the Mummenschanz Mask Theater was founded in 1972. In 1973, under the direction of producers Arthur Shafman and Robert B. D&#x27;Angelo, Mummenschanz toured the United States, Canada, Europe, and South America, and later enjoyed a 1,326-performance, three-year run on Broadway (1977–80). On March 4, 1977, Mummenschanz appeared on the Tonight Show. 
In 1986, they performed their &quot;The New Show&quot; at the Helen Hayes Theatre in New York. During this time they were spoofed on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; by Chris Elliott. They appeared as special guest stars on the last episode of the first season of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, which taped in November 1976. The troupe won the Rose d&#x27;Or for their TV production &quot;La Pomme&quot; in 1980. They appeared on &quot;Sesame Street.&quot; They also appeared on &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; in the 1980s and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; in the 1990s. On Feb. 6, 1986 they appeared on &quot;The&quot; &quot;Tonight Show&quot; on NBC. In 1987, Mummenschanz performed in the award-winning music video for &quot;Devil&#x27;s Ball&quot; by Double (featuring Herb Alpert on trumpet). In 1992, Andres Bossard, a founding member of the troupe, died at age 47 from AIDS-related complications. Mummenschanz toured with American actor John Charles Murphy for the duration of &quot;Parade&quot;, their world tour beginning in 1995. Their next show was an anniversary programme called &quot;40 years&quot;, and it presented the highlights of four decades of creative endeavors. In December 2016, Mummenschanz began touring Switzerland with a new program titled &quot;you &amp; me&quot;, created by founding member Floriana Frassetto.

<doc id="1061886" wikidata="Q7636437" url="?curid=1061886" title="Sullivan University">
<text>Sullivan University is a private for-profit university based in Louisville, Kentucky. It is licensed to offer certificates and diplomas, associate&#x27;s, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees by the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. According to the Kentucky Council, for the 2015–2016 academic year, 40% of Sullivan&#x27;s full-time, first-time associate degree students received their degrees within three years.

Sullivan University currently has physical campuses in Louisville, Lexington, Fort Knox, and a learning center in Louisa, Kentucky. Most of the university&#x27;s degree programs are also available online or in a hybrid format.

==History==
Sullivan Business College was founded in 1962 by A.O. Sullivan and his son, A.R. Sullivan, as a one-year school preparing people for careers. In 1972, the school began to offer associate degrees in addition to its one-year career diplomas. The institution was renamed in 1976 to Sullivan Junior College of Business to reflect its authority to grant associate degrees, and moved to its present Louisville campus on Bardstown Road and the Watterson Expressway. The school soon expanded by opening additional campuses—its Ft. Knox campus was opened in 1982, and its campus in Lexington (currently on Harrodsburg Road) in 1985. In 1987 Sullivan opened the National Center for Hospitality Studies offering degrees in culinary arts, baking and pastry arts, hotel and restaurant management and catering.

In 1990, the school was approved by the Kentucky Council on Higher Education to award the Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration. In addition, the baccalaureate degree program was added, receiving its accreditation in 1992. The college first offered an MBA degree in 1997.

In 1998, Sullivan College became the largest private college in Kentucky with 3,000 students enrolling at its campuses in Louisville, Lexington, and Fort Knox. The name was changed to its present designation, Sullivan University, in 2000, reflecting the college&#x27;s growth.

In 2008, Sullivan began its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Pharmacy, which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). Pharmacy graduates are eligible to sit for the National Board Exam.

In 2010, Sullivan launched its first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in management. Sullivan University still reflects its original philosophy of quickly preparing students for careers by offering a &quot;stair step&quot; approach. A student can attain a career diploma in one year, an associate degree in eighteen months (although only a minority of full-time students reach this far), a bachelor&#x27;s degree after an additional eighteen months, and a master&#x27;s degree in an additional eighteen months. This way, they can attain employment at an entry level while working toward a degree.

Sullivan University operates on the quarter system with each period lasting eleven weeks. The Louisville and Lexington campuses offer &quot;Plus Friday,&quot; where campuses do not hold classes on any Fridays but do have the campus offices open so students can work with full-time undergraduate instructors, who are required to be on campus on Friday morning.

In 2012, Sullivan University entered into an agreement with Historic Homes Foundation, Inc., the owner of the adjoining Historic Farmington Plantation, to lease five of the landmark&#x27;s 18 acres for use as a 300-space parking lot to be shared by the entities. Controversial questions about the proposal were raised in online media leading up to its consideration in the February 3, 2013, meeting of the Metro Louisville Landmarks Commission&#x27;s Individual Landmarks Architectural Review Committee.

Sullivan University merged with Spencerian College and Sullivan College of Technology and Design, creating a single university in 2018.

The university&#x27;s founder, A.R. Sullivan, retired as chancellor in 2020 and was named chancellor emeritus. He still serves on the board of directors. Glenn Sullivan was subsequently named chancellor of the university.

===Legal issues===
In a 2009 lawsuit, it was disclosed that the organization held just $20 million in cash reserves though the Sullivan University System distributed $77 million over the previous 10 years to its two sole stockholders, Chancellor Alva Sullivan and ex-wife Patricia Schrenk. These distributions excluded salaries, bonuses, and other benefits received from employment with the organization. In her filing, Schrenk alleged that college funds were used to pay for personal vacations, to settle sexual harassment lawsuits, and for private lawn care at the stockholders&#x27; residences. Though the lawsuit was not lodged against the Sullivan University System, its relatively low cash reserves despite the large distributions made to its stockholders made local and regional news.

In August 2011, a special prosecutor was appointed to investigate potential violations of state campaign-finance laws when a former employee alleged that the Sullivan University System Chancellor and other executives asked more than 100 employees to pledge to vote for and donate to Todd P&#x27;Pool, a then-candidate for Kentucky Attorney General. P&#x27;Pool was running against incumbent Jack Conway, who had been investigating the Sullivan University System in several matters since earlier that same year. The allegation stated that executives urged employees to demonstrate their support for the candidate in front of all present at a meeting and to donate to the campaign by presenting a personal check to Sullivan University System executives.

In 2011, the Sullivan University System was ordered to pay more than $480,000 to then-current and previous employees for a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The suit alleged that the system misclassified admissions representatives and failed to accurately track work hours in order to avoid payment of overtime wages. Though alerted to the situation in 1994, the U.S. Department of Labor did not review the case until 2007, and did not file the lawsuit against both the Sullivan University System and its Chancellor until 2010.

==Culinary programs==
The school&#x27;s culinary programs are one of its distinctive features. Both faculty and students have been featured on the Food Network; Former Louisville instructor John Castro bested Bobby Flay in Hot Browns in a 2008 &quot;Throwdown&quot;, while Lexington graduate Brigitte Nguyen came in a close second in a hamburger-themed Ultimate Recipe Showdown shown in 2009. Brigitte won the $50,000 first prize in the National Chicken Cooking Contest in San Antonio May 2, 2009, with her &quot;Chinese Chicken Burgers with Rainbow Sesame Slaw.&quot;

The American Culinary Federation, Inc. (ACF) has named Chef Derek Spendlove first chair of the ACF Certification Commission. Spendlove currently serves as Director of the Baking and Pastry Arts Program for the National Center for Hospitality Studies (NCHS) at Sullivan University. He also serves as team manager of Sullivan University&#x27;s award-winning student culinary competition team.

In 2008, Sullivan University was selected as the only culinary program in the United States to have been formally invited to cook for the Olympic athletes and sponsors for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

In 2021, Jackie Joseph, a Sullivan University graduate, was crowned &quot;Best Baker in America&quot; on the Food Network.

<text>Medfra is an unincorporated community located in the Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska.

== Geography ==
Medfra is located on the north bank of the Kuskokwim River, about by air northwest of Nikolai.

== History ==
Medfra may have been a small seasonal camp for Alaska Natives before the arrival of Europeans in Alaska. Early in the 20th century, a trading post and boat landing called &quot;Berrys Landing&quot; were established at Medfra. A post office was open from 1922 to 1955.

==Demographics==

Medfra first reported on the 1930 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It did not appear again until 1950. It last appeared on the 1990 census, when it was designated an Alaskan Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA), but it was uninhabited. It has not appeared on the census since.

<text>Andrzej Dobrowolski (September 9, 1921 – August 8, 1990) was a Polish composer and teacher. He studied at the Warsaw Conservatoire during the war and afterwards in the State High School of Music in Kraków. He went on to teach theory and, later, composition in Kraków and then Warsaw at the State Higher School of Music, becoming a Professor at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Graz in 1976, where he taught composition and electronic music.

Dobrowolski was one of the first Polish composers to concentrate on music for tape, and one of the first to pioneer the combination of pre-recorded tape and live performers. He was one of the first composers to use the Experimental Studio of the Polish Radio in Warsaw, which was founded in 1958.

<doc id="1061897" wikidata="Q1732216" url="?curid=1061897" title="Louisiana State Penitentiary">
<text>The Louisiana State Penitentiary (known as Angola, and nicknamed the &quot;Alcatraz of the South&quot;, &quot;The Angola Plantation&quot; and &quot;The Farm&quot;) is a maximum-security prison farm in Louisiana operated by the Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections.

Angola is the largest maximum-security prison in the United States, with 6,300 prisoners and 1,800 staff, including corrections officers, janitors, maintenance workers, and wardens. Located in West Feliciana Parish, the prison is set between oxbow lakes on the east side of a bend of the Mississippi River and thus flanked on three sides by water. It lies less than south of Louisiana&#x27;s straight east–west border with Mississippi.

The of land the prison sits on was known before the American Civil War as the Angola Plantations, a slave plantation owned by slave trader Isaac Franklin. The prison is located at the end of Louisiana Highway 66, around northwest of St. Francisville. Death row for men and the state execution chamber for women and men are located at the Angola facility.

==History==



Before 1835, state inmates were held in a jail in New Orleans. The first Louisiana State Penitentiary, located at the intersection of 6th and Laurel streets in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, was modeled on a prison in Wethersfield, Connecticut. It was built to house 100 convicts in cells of . In 1844, the state leased operation of the prison and its prisoners to McHatton Pratt and Company, a private company.

During the American Civil War, Union soldiers occupied the prison in Baton Rouge. In 1869, during the Reconstruction era, Samuel Lawrence James, a former Confederate major, received the military lease to the future prison property along the Mississippi River. He tried to produce cotton with the forced labor of African Americans.

The land developed as Angola Penitentiary was purchased in the 1830s from Francis Rout as four contiguous plantations by Isaac Franklin. He was a planter and slave trader, co-owner of the profitable slave trading firm Franklin and Armfield, of Alexandria, Virginia, and Natchez, Mississippi. After he died in 1846, Franklin&#x27;s widow, by then known as Adelicia Cheatham, joined these plantations: Panola, Belle View, Killarney, and Angola, when she sold them all in 1880 to Samuel Lawrence James, the former CSA officer. The Angola plantation was named after the country on the west coast of Southern Africa, from which many enslaved people were from. It contained a building called the Old Slave Quarters.

Under the convict lease system, Major James ran his vast plantation using convicts leased from the state as his workers. He was responsible for their room and board and had total authority over them. With the incentive to earn money from prisoners, the state passed laws directed at African Americans, requiring payment of minor fees and fines as punishment for infractions. Cash-poor men in the agricultural economy were forced into jail and convict labor. Such convicts were frequently abused, underfed, and subject to unregulated violence. The state exercised little oversight of conditions. Prisoners were often worked to death under harsh conditions. James died in 1894.

===20th century operations===
The Louisiana Department of Public Safety &amp; Corrections says this facility opened as a state prison in 1901. The state began transferring prison facilities out of the old penitentiary into Angola. The old penitentiary continued to be used as a receiving station, hospital, clothing, and shoe factory, and place for executions until it finally closed in 1917. The history and archaeology of the old penitentiary provide insights into inmates&#x27; structures and daily life.

In September 1928, prisoners Cleveland Owen, Steven J. Beck, and James Heard took two prison guards hostage and escaped from Camp E armed with .45 Colt automatics. Ten additional prisoners followed them out of the gates. The break was thwarted when the anticipated ferry was not positioned on the river&#x27;s prison side. A gunfight between guards and prisoners ensued, leaving five prisoners dead. According to contemporary news reports, twenty-six persons were shot. &quot;Trusty&quot; prisoners who assisted the guards later sought pardons from Governor Huey Long.

Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell, authors of &quot;The Life and Legend of Leadbelly&quot;, stated that Angola was &quot;probably as close to slavery as any person could come in 1930.&quot; Hardened criminals broke down upon being notified that they were being sent to Angola. White-black racial tensions in the society were expressed at the prison, adding to the violence: each year, one in every ten inmates was stabbed. Wolfe and Lornell stated that the staff, consisting of 90 people, &quot;ran the prison like it was a private fiefdom.&quot;

The two authors stated that prisoners were viewed as the worst of the lowest order&quot;. The state did not appropriate many funds for the operation of Angola and saved money by trying to decrease costs. Much of the remaining money ended up in the operations of other state projects; Wolfe and Lornell stated that the re-appropriation of funds occurred &quot;mysteriously&quot;.

In 1935, remains of a Native American individual were taken from Angola and were donated to the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science.

In 1948, governor Earl Kemp Long appointed Rollo C. Lawrence, a former mayor of Pineville, as the first Angola superintendent. Long subsequently established the warden position as one of political patronage. Long appointed distant relatives as wardens of the prison.

In the institution&#x27;s history, the electric chair, Gruesome Gertie, was stored at Angola. Because West Feliciana Parish did not want to be associated with state executions, for some time, the state transported the chair to the parish of conviction of a condemned prisoner before executing them.

A former Angola prisoner, William Sadler (also called &quot;Wooden Ear&quot; because of hearing loss he suffered after a prison attack), wrote a series of articles about Angola in the 1940s. &quot;Hell on Angola&quot; helped bring about prison reform.

In February 1951, 31 inmates, in protest of the prison&#x27;s conditions, cut their own Achilles tendons. Unable to use both feet, the inmates hopped around and sang &quot;The Heel-String Boogie&quot;, and the group was labeled the Heel String Gang. When the protest made headlines, Long convened a committee of 32 judges, law officers and media members to investigate conditions at the prison. By May, the number of inmates who had slashed their Achilles tendons had risen to 55. However, the protest was successful; the committee recommended several reforms, including the abolition of corporal punishment at the prison. In its November 22, 1952, issue, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Magazine&quot; referred to Angola as &quot;the worst prison in America&quot;. In addition, Margaret Dixon, managing editor of the &quot;Baton Rouge Morning Advocate&quot; for two decades, worked for prison reform, specifically, construction of other facilities to reduce the population at Angola. The new Margaret Dixon Correctional Institution opened in 1976 and was named for her.

On December 5, 1956, five men escaped by digging out of the prison grounds and swimming across the Mississippi River. They were Robert Wallace, 25; Wallace McDonald, 23; Vernon Roy Ingram, 21; Glenn Holiday, 20; and Frank Verbon Gann, 30. The &quot;Hope Star&quot; newspaper of Arkansas reported that one body (believed to be Wallace) was recovered from the river.

McDonald was captured later in Texas, after returning to the United States from Mexico. McDonald said that two of his fellow escapees drowned, but warden Maurice Sigler disputed this. Sigler said that he believed no more than one inmate drowned. His men had found three clear sets of tracks climbing up the river bank.

Gann&#x27;s family wrote to Sigler on multiple occasions, requesting that he declare the escaped prisoner dead to free up benefits for his children. Although the family never heard again from Gann, Sigler refused to declare him dead, saying that he was likely in Mexico. Gann had been imprisoned in Angola after escaping from the Opelousas Parish Jail on April 29, 1956, where he was serving a relatively minor charge for car theft.

In 1961, female inmates were moved from Angola to the newly opened Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women.

In 1971, the American Bar Association criticized the conditions at Angola. Linda Ashton of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; stated that the bar association described Angola as &quot;medieval, squalid and horrifying&quot;. In 1972, Elayne Hunt, a reforming director of corrections, was appointed by Governor Edwin Edwards. The U.S. courts in &quot;Gates v. Collier&quot; ordered Louisiana to clean up Angola once and for all, ordering the end of the Trustee-Officer and Trusty systems.

Efforts to reform and improve conditions at Angola have continued. In 1975, U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, declared conditions at Angola to be in a state of emergency. The state installed Ross Maggio as the warden. Prisoners nicknamed Maggio &quot;the gangster&quot; because he strictly adhered to rules. Ashton said that, by most accounts, Maggio had improved conditions. Maggio retired in 1984.

In the 1980s, Kirksey Nix perpetrated the &quot;Angola Lonely Hearts&quot; scam from within the prison.

On June 21, 1989, US District Judge Polozola declared a new state of emergency at Angola.

In 1993 Angola officers fatally shot 29-year-old escapee Tyrone Brown.

Burl Cain served as the warden from 1995 to March 7, 2016. He was known for numerous improvements, lowering the prison violence rate, and numerous criminal allegations.

In 1999, six inmates who were serving life sentences for murder took three officers hostage in Camp D. The hostage takers bludgeoned and fatally stabbed 49-year-old Captain David Knapps. Armed officers ended the rebellion by shooting the inmates, killing 26-year-old Joel Durham, and seriously wounding another.

===21st century===
In 2004, Paul Harris of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Unsurprisingly, Angola has always been famed for brutality, riots, escape and murder.&quot;

On August 31, 2008, New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin stated in a press conference that anyone arrested for looting during the evacuation of the city due to Hurricane Gustav would not be housed in the city/parish jail, but instead sent directly to Angola to await trial.

As evidence that the prison had retained its notoriety, Nagin warned:

In 2009, the prison reduced its budget by $12 million by &quot;double bunking&quot; (installing bunk beds to increase the capacity of dormitories), reducing overtime, and replacing officers with security cameras.

In 2012, 1,000 prisoners were transferred to Angola from C. Paul Phelps Correctional Center, which had closed. The state government did not increase the prison&#x27;s budget or hire additional employees.

On March 11, 2014, Glenn Ford, a man wrongfully convicted of murder and Louisiana&#x27;s longest-serving death row prisoner, walked free after a court overturned his conviction a day earlier when petitioned by prosecutors. Ford had spent nearly three decades at the prison, with 26 years in solitary confinement on death row. The state&#x27;s policy was to house death row prisoners in solitary confinement, but lengthy appeals have created new harsh conditions of extended solitary. Convicts and their defense counsels have challenged such lengthy stays in solitary confinement, which is harmful to both mental and physical health and has been considered to be &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; under the US Constitution.

In March 2019, seven members of staff at the facility were arrested for rape, smuggling items to inmates, and maintaining personal relationships with prisoners.

In 2020, regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Louisiana, &quot;ProPublica&quot; wrote that prisoners alleged that deliberately low testing rates masked an epidemic in the prison. Prison officials denied the prisoner&#x27;s allegations. Prisoners also allege they were treated with over-the-counter medications, and &quot;four of the 12 prisoners who have died in the pandemic...had been denied needed medical help for days because their symptoms were not considered sufficiently serious&quot;. &quot;ProPublica&quot; also wrote that some sick inmates &quot;concealed their symptoms to try to avoid losing their freedom of movement and other privileges&quot; because of extended quarantines.

In 2023, U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, ruled that the juvenile detainees in Angola were being held in conditions that were unconstitutional and ordered their removal from temporary lockup. Legal advocates like the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center were involved in advocating for the juvenile detainees, mostly black boys, to be removed from Angola, citing concerns about their mental health, access to education, and the excessive heat in the former death row unit the boys were being held in.

==Management==

Angola was designed to be as self-sufficient as possible; it functioned as a miniature community with a canning factory, a dairy, a mail system, a small ranch, repair shops, and a sugar mill. Prisoners raised food staples and cash crops. The self-sufficiency was enacted so taxpayers would spend less money and so politicians such as Governor of Louisiana Huey P. Long would have an improved public image. In the 1930s, prisoners worked from dawn until dusk.

As of 2009, there are three levels of solitary confinement. &quot;Extended lockdown&quot; is colloquially known as &quot;Closed Cell Restricted&quot; or &quot;CCR&quot;. Until a period before 2009, death row inmates had more privileges than &quot;extended lockdown&quot; inmates, including the privilege of watching television.

&quot;Extended lockdown&quot; was initially intended as a temporary punishment. The next most restrictive level was, in 2009, &quot;Camp J&quot;, referring to an inmate housing unit that houses solitary confinement. The most restrictive level is &quot;administrative segregation&quot;, colloquially referred to by inmates as the &quot;dungeon&quot; or the &quot;hole&quot;.

==Location==

Louisiana State Penitentiary is in unincorporated West Feliciana Parish, in east central Louisiana. It is located at the base of the Tunica Hills, in a region described by Jenny Lee Rice of &quot;Paste&quot; as &quot;breathtakingly beautiful&quot;.

The prison is about northwest of St. Francisville, about northwest of Baton Rouge, and northwest of New Orleans. Angola is about an hour&#x27;s drive from Baton Rouge, and it is about a two-hour driving distance from New Orleans. The Mississippi River borders the facility on three sides. The prison is near the Louisiana-Mississippi border. Angola is located about from the Dixon Correctional Institute.

Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell, authors of &quot;The Life and Legend of Leadbelly&quot;, stated that in the 1990s, the prison remained &quot;far away from public awareness&quot;. The prison officials sometimes provide meals for official guests because of what the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections refers to as the &quot;extreme remote location&quot; of Angola; the nearest non-prison dining facility is, as of 1999, away. The prison property is adjacent to the Angola Tract of the Tunica Hills Wildlife Management Area. Due to security reasons regarding Angola, the Tunica Hills WMA&#x27;s Angola Tract is closed to the general public from March 1 through August 31 every year.

The main entrance is at the terminus of Louisiana Highway 66, a road described by Wolfe and Lornell as &quot;a winding, often muddy state road&quot;. From St. Francisville one would travel about north along U.S. Highway 61, turn left at Louisiana 66, and travel on that road for until it dead ends at Angola&#x27;s front gate. The Angola Ferry provides a ferry service between Angola and a point in unincorporated Pointe Coupee Parish. The ferry is open only to employees except during special events, when members of the general public may use it.

==Composition==
The prison property occupies a area. The size of the prison property is larger than the size of Manhattan. Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell, authors of &quot;The Life and Legend of Leadbelly&quot;, stated that Angola of the 1990s looks &quot;more like a large working plantation than one of the most notorious prisons in the United States.&quot; Officers patrol the complex on horseback, as many prison acres are devoted to cultivating crops. By 1999, the prison&#x27;s primary roads had been paved.

The Tunica Hills and the Mississippi River surround the prison property. The perimeter of the property is not fenced, while the individual prisoner dormitory and recreational camps are fenced. Most prison buildings are yellow with a red trim.
===Inmate quarters===
The state of Louisiana considers Angola to be a multi-security institution. 29% of the prison&#x27;s beds are designated for maximum security inmates. The inmates live in several housing units scattered across the Angola grounds. By the 1990s, air conditioning and heating units had been installed in the inmate housing units.

Most inmates live in dormitories instead of cell blocks. The prison administration states that having &quot;inmates of all ages and with long sentences live this way encourages cooperation and healthy peer relationships.&quot;

====Main Prison Complex====
The Main Prison Complex consists of the East Yard and the West Yard. The East Yard has 16 minimum and medium custody prisoner dormitories and one maximum custody extended lockdown cellblock; the cellblock houses long-term extended-lockdown prisoners, in-transit administrative segregation prisoners, inmates who need mental health attention, and protective-custody inmates.

The West Yard has 16 minimum and medium custody prisoner dormitories, two administrative segregation cellblocks, and the prison treatment center. The treatment center houses geriatric, hospice, and ill in-transit prisoners. As of 1999, the main prison complex houses half of Angola&#x27;s prisoners.

Dormitories within the main prison include the Ash, Cypress, Hickory, Magnolia, Oak, Pine, Spruce, and Walnut dormitories. The cell blocks are A, B, C, and D. The main prison also houses the local Main Prison administration building, a gymnasium, a kitchen/dining facility, the Angola Vocational School, and the Judge Henry A. Politz Educational building.

====Outcamps====
Angola also has several outcamps. Camp C includes eight minimum and medium custody dormitories, one cellblock with administrative segregation and working cellblock prisoners, and one extended lockdown cellblock. Camp C includes the Bear and Wolf dormitories and Jaguar and Tiger cellblocks. Camp D has the same features as Camp C, except that it has one working cellblock instead of an extended lockdown cellblock, and its other cellblock does not have working prisoners. Camp D houses the Eagle and Falcon dormitories and the Hawk and Raven cellblocks.

Camp F has four minimum custody dormitories and the &quot;Dog Pen&quot;, which houses 11 minimum custody inmates. All of the prisoners housed in Camp F are &quot;trusties&quot;, who mop floors, deliver food to fellow prisoners, and perform other support tasks. Camp F also houses Angola&#x27;s execution chamber. Camp F has a lake where trusties fish. A prisoner quoted in &quot;Self-governance, Normalcy and Control: Inmate-produced Media at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola&quot; described Camp F as being &quot;off from the rest of the prison&quot;.

The Close Cell Restricted (CCR) unit, an isolation unit located near the Angola main entrance, has 101 isolation cells and 40 trustee beds. Jimmy LeBlanc, the corrections secretary, said in October 2010 that the State of Louisiana could save about $1.8 million during the remaining nine months of the 2010–2011 fiscal year if it closed CCR and moved prisoners to unused death row cells and possibly some Camp D double bunks. LeBlanc said that the prisoners in isolation would remain isolated.

Camp J was in operation until its 2018 closure. It has four extended lockdown cellblocks, which contained prisoners with disciplinary problems, and one dormitory with minimum and medium custody inmates who provide housekeeping functions for Camp J. Camp J housed the Alligator, Barracuda, Gar, and Shark cellblocks.

=====Reception center and death row=====
The Reception Center, the closest prison housing building to the main entrance, acts as a reception center for arriving prisoners. It is inside the main gate to the right of the main highway. In addition, it contains the death row for male inmates in Louisiana, with 101 extended lockdown cells housing condemned inmates. The death row facility has a central room and multiple tiers. The entrance to each tier includes a locked door and color photographs of the prisoners in each tier.

Death row includes eight tiers, lettered A to G. Seven tiers have 15 cells each, while one tier has 11. Each hallway has a cell for showering. The death row houses exercise areas with basketball posts. The death row facility was constructed in 2006 without air conditioning or cross ventilation. In addition, the Reception Center has one minimum custody dormitory with inmates who provide housekeeping for the facility.

In June 2013, three prisoners filed a federal lawsuit against the prison in the court in Baton Rouge, alleging that the death row facility does not have adequate measures to prevent overheating. The prisoners said that due to pre-existing medical conditions, the heat may cause health problems. Brian A. Jackson, the district federal judge, ordered temperature data collection at the Angola death row for three weeks to determine the conditions. During that time, Angola officials blasted the outer walls of the prison with water cannons and installed window awnings to attempt to lower temperature data. In response, Jackson said that he was &quot;troubled&quot; by the possibility of manipulating the temperature data.

On Monday, August 5, 2013, , the federal trial regarding the condition of the death row in high heat started. The following day, Warden Burl Cain apologized for violating the court order regarding data collection. On Wednesday, August 7, 2013, closing arguments in the trial ended. In December 2013, U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson ruled that the heat index of the prison was cruel and unusual punishment, and therefore, a cooling system must be installed. By 2014, a court-ordered plan to install a cooling system was underway.

As of May 2019, the issue was close to being resolved after a 6-year-long court battle. A settlement has been reached between the death row inmates and the prison. The settlement agreement calls for daily showers for the three Angola inmates of at least 15 minutes; individual ice containers that are replenished promptly by prison staff; individual fans; water faucets in their cells; &quot;IcyBreeze&quot; units or so-called &quot;Cajun coolers&quot;; and the diversion of cool air from the death row guard pod into their cells. Even though these measures have already been put in place, the court ruling could take until November 2019 to be made final by Judge Brian Jackson.

===B-Line===
The facility includes a group of houses called the &quot;B-Line&quot;, which function as residences for prison staff members and their families; inmates perform services for the staff members and their households. The employee housing includes recreational centers, pools, and parks. The Angola B-Line Chapel was dedicated on Friday, July 17, 2009, at 4:00 pm.

Residents on the prison grounds are zoned to West Feliciana Parish Public Schools. Primary schools serving the Angola grounds include Bains Lower Elementary School and Bains Elementary School in Bains. Secondary schools serving the Angola grounds are West Feliciana Middle School and West Feliciana High School in Bains. The West Feliciana Parish Library is located in St. Francisville. The library, previously a part of the Audubon Regional Library System, became independent in January 2004. West Feliciana Parish is in the service area of Baton Rouge Community College.

Previously, elementary school children attended Tunica Elementary School in Tunica, Louisiana, located in proximity to Angola. The school building, from Angola, is several miles from Angola&#x27;s main entrance, and many of its students live on the Angola grounds. On May 18, 2011, due to budget cuts, the parish school board voted to close Tunica Elementary.

===Fire station===
The fire station houses the Angola Emergency Medical Services Department staff, who provide fire and emergency services to the prison. The Angola Fire Department is registered as department number 63001 with the Louisiana Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office. The department&#x27;s equipment includes one engine, tanker, and rescue truck. Within Angola, the department protects 500 buildings, including employee and prisoner housing quarters. The department has mutual aid agreements with West Feliciana Parish and with Wilkinson County, Mississippi.

===Religious sites===

The main entrance to Angola has an etched monument that refers to Epistle to the Philippians 3:15.

Reflecting the historic dominance of the Catholic church in south Louisiana, St. Augustine Church was built in the early 1950s and is staffed by the Roman Catholic Church. The New Life Interfaith Chapel was dedicated in 1982.

In the 2000s, the main prison church, the churches for Camps C and D, and a grounds chapel were constructed as part of an effort to build chapels for every state-run prison facility. A staff and family of staff chapel was also under construction. Outside donations and ticket sales from the prison rodeo funded these churches. The Camp C Chapel and the B-Line Chapel were dedicated the same day.

The most recent structure is Our Lady of Guadalupe Chapel, a structure built with over $450,000 worth of materials donated by Latin American businessmen Jorge Valdes and Fernando Garcia. Its design resembles The Alamo in San Antonio, Texas. Built in 38 days by 50 prisoners, it opened in December 2013. The interfaith church &quot;includes seating for more than 200 and features paintings, furniture and stained-glass windows crafted by inmates.&quot;

===Recreational facilities===

Prison staff members have access to recreational facilities on the Angola property. Angola has ball fields, the Prison View Golf Course, a swimming pool, a tennis court, and a walking track. Lake Killarney, an oxbow lake of the Mississippi River located on the prison grounds, has large crappie fish. The prison administration controls access to Lake Killarney, and few people fish there. The crappie fish grow very large.

Butler Park is a recreational facility on the edge of the Angola property. It houses gazebos, picnic tables, and barbecue pits. As of 1986, a prisoner who has no major disciplinary issues for at least a year may use the property.

====Prison View Golf Course====
Prison View Golf Course, a , 9-hole, 36-par golf course, is located on the grounds of Angola. Prison View, the only golf course on the property of an American prison, is between the Tunica Hills and Camp J, at the intersection of B-Line Road and Camp J Road. All individuals wishing to play must provide personal information 48 hours before arrival so that the prison authorities can conduct background checks. Convicted felons and individuals on visitation lists cannot play on the golf course. Current prisoners at Angola are not permitted to play on the golf course.

The golf course, constructed on a former bull pasture site, opened in June 2004. Prisoners performed most of the work to construct the course. Prisoners that the administration considers to be the most trustworthy are permitted to work at the golf course. Warden Burl Cain said he built the course so employees would be encouraged to stay at Angola over weekends. He wanted them available to provide support in case of an emergency.

===Guest house===
The &quot;Ranch House&quot; is a facility for prison guests. James Ridgeway of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; described it as &quot;a sort of clubhouse where the wardens and other officials get together in a convivial atmosphere for chow prepared by inmate cooks.&quot; Originally constructed to serve as a conference center to supplement the meeting room in the Angola administration building, the &quot;Ranch House&quot; received its name after Burl Cain was selected as Warden. Cain had the building renovated to accommodate overnight guests. The renovations, which included converting one room into a bedroom and adding a shower and fireplace, cost approximately $7,346. Traditionally, prisoners who worked successfully in the Ranch House were later assigned to work as cooks at the Louisiana Governor&#x27;s Mansion.

===Cemeteries===
Point Lookout Cemetery is the prison cemetery, located on the north side of the Angola property, at the base of the Tunica Hills. Deceased prisoners from all state prisons had been buried here who were not claimed and transported elsewhere by family members. A white rail fence surrounds the cemetery. The current Point Lookout was created after a 1927 flood destroyed the previous cemetery, located between the current Camps C and D. In September 2001, a memorial was installed here dedicated to &quot;Unknown Prisoners&quot;. The Point Lookout plot established after 1927 has 331 grave markers and an unknown number of bodies; it is considered full.

Point Lookout II, a cemetery annex east of the original Point Lookout, opened in the mid-1990s; it has a capacity of 700 grave sites. As of 2010, 90 prisoners were buried at Point Lookout II.

===Angola Museum===
The Angola Museum, operated by the nonprofit Louisiana State Penitentiary Museum Foundation, is the on-site prison museum. Visitors are charged a $5 per adult admission fee and $3 per adult if the group is ten or larger. The museum is located outside the prison&#x27;s main gate, in a former bank building.

===Angola Airstrip===
The prison includes the Angola Airstrip . The airstrip is used by state-owned aircraft to transport prisoners to and from Angola and for transporting officials on state business to and from Angola. The airport is used during daylight and visual flight rules times.

===Other prison facilities and features===

The facility&#x27;s main entrance has a metal-roofed guard house to review traffic to and from the prison. Michael L. Varnado and Daniel P. Smith of &quot;Victims of Dead Man Walking&quot; stated that the guard house &quot;looks like a large carport over the road. &quot; The guard house has long barriers, with Stop signs, to prevent automobiles entering and leaving the compound without the permission of the officers. The officers manually raise the barriers to allow a vehicle access or egress.

The Front Gate Visiting Processing Center, with a rated capacity of 272 persons, is the processing and security screening point for prison visitors. The United States Postal Service operates the Angola Post Office on the prison grounds. It was established on October 2, 1887.

The David C. Knapps Correctional Officer Training Academy, the state training center for correctional officers, is located at the northwest corner of Angola, in front of Camp F. Near the training center, Angola prisoners maintain the only nature preserve located on the grounds of a penal institution. The R. E. Barrow, Jr. Treatment Center is located on the Angola premises.

The C.C. Dixon K-9 Training Center is the dog-training area. It was named in 2002 to commemorate Connie Conrad Dixon, a dog trainer, and K-9 officer, who died in 1997 aged 89.

The Louisiana State Penitentiary Wastewater Treatment Plant serves the prison complex. The prison also houses an all-purpose arena.

===History of infrastructure at the prison===

Camp A, the former slave quarters for the plantation, was the first building to house inmates. In the early 21st century, Camp A did not house prisoners.

Charles Wolfe and Kip Lornell, authors of &quot;The Life and Legend of Leadbelly&quot; (1992), stated that during the 1930s, Angola was &quot;even further removed from decent civilization&quot; than it was in the 1990s. The two added, &quot;That&#x27;s the way the state of Louisiana wanted it, for Angola held some of the meanest inmates.&quot;

In 1930, about 130 women, most of them black, were imprisoned in Camp D. In 1930, Camp A, which held around 700 black inmates, was close to the center of the Angola institution. Inmates worked on levee control as the springtime high water threatened Angola. The Mississippi River was nearly wide in this area. Many inmates who tried to swim across drowned; few of their bodies were recovered.

The prison hospital opened in the 1940s. The campus had only one permanent nurse and no permanent doctor.

In the 1980s, the main road to Angola had not been paved. It has since been blacktopped.

The outcamp buildings, constructed in 1939 as a WPA project during the Great Depression, were renovated in the 1970s. In May 1993, the buildings&#x27; fire safety violations were reported. In June of that year, Richard Stalder, the Secretary of Corrections, said that Angola would close the buildings if LDP S&amp;C did not find millions of dollars to improve the buildings.

====Red Hat Cell Block====
The most restrictive inmate housing unit was colloquially referred to as &quot;Red Hat Cell Block&quot;, after the red paint-coated straw hats that its occupants wore when they worked in the fields. &quot;Red Hat&quot;, a one-story, 30-cell building at Camp E, was built in 1933. Brooke Shelby Biggs of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; reported that men who had lived in &quot;Red Hat&quot; &quot;told of a dungeon crawling with rats, where dinner was served in stinking buckets splashed onto the floors.&quot;

Warden C. Murray Henderson phased out solitary confinement at &quot;Red Hat&quot;. In 1972, his successor Elayn Hunt had &quot;Red Hat&quot; officially closed.

In 1977, the administration made Camp J the most restrictive housing unit in Angola. On February 20, 2003, the National Park Service listed the Red Hat Cell Block on the National Register of Historic Places as #03000041.

==Demographics==
Louisiana State Penitentiary is the largest correctional facility in the United States by population. In 2010, the prison had 5,100 inmates and 1,700 employees. In 2010, the racial composition of the inmates was 76% black and 24% white. 71% of inmates were serving a life sentence. 1.6% had been sentenced to death. As of 2016 many inmates come from the state of Mississippi.

As of 2011, the prison has about 1,600 employees, making it one of the largest employers in Louisiana. Over 600 &quot;free people&quot; live on prison property. These residents are Angola&#x27;s emergency response personnel and their dependents. In 1986, around 200 families of employees lived within Angola property. Hilton Butler, then Angola&#x27;s Warden, estimated that 250 children lived on the Angola property.

Many prison employees are from families that have lived and worked at Angola for generations. Laura Sullivan of &quot;National Public Radio&quot; said, &quot;In a place so remote, it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s nepotism. There&#x27;s simply no one else to hire.&quot;

==Operations==

As of 2011, the annual budget of the Louisiana State Penitentiary was more than $120 million. Angola still is operated as a working farm; former Warden Burl Cain once said that the key to running a peaceful maximum security prison was that &quot;you&#x27;ve got to keep the inmates working all day so they&#x27;re tired at night.&quot; In 2009 James Ridgeway of &quot;Mother Jones&quot; wrote Angola was &quot;An 18,000-acre complex that still resembles the slave plantation it once was.&quot;

Angola has the largest number of inmates on life sentences in the United States. As of 2009, Angola had 3,712 inmates on life sentences, making up 74% of the population that year. Some 32 inmates die each year; only four generally gain parole each year. Louisiana&#x27;s tough sentencing laws result in long sentences for the inmate population, who have been convicted of armed robbery, murder, and rape. In 1998, Peter Applebome of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to visit the place and not feel that a prisoner could disappear off the face of the earth and no one would ever know or care.&quot;

Most new prisoners begin working in the cotton fields. A prisoner may spend years working there before gaining a better job.

In Angola parlance, a &quot;freeman&quot; is a correctional officer. Around 2000, the officers were among the lowest-paid in the United States. Like the prisoners they supervised, few had graduated from high school. As of 2009, about half of the officers were female.

The administration uses prisoners to provide cleaning and general maintenance services for the West Feliciana Parish School Board and other government agencies and nonprofit groups within West Feliciana Parish.

Warden Burl Cain maintained an open-door policy with the media. He allowed the filming of the documentary &quot;The Farm: Angola, USA&quot; (1998) at the prison, which focused on the lives of six men. It won numerous awards. Films such as &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, and &quot;I Love You Phillip Morris&quot; were partly filmed in Angola. Cain did not allow a proposed sex scene between two male inmates in &quot;I Love You Phillip Morris&quot; to be filmed at the prison.

The prison hosts a rodeo every April and October. Inmates produce the newsmagazine &quot;The Angolite&quot;, which has won numerous awards. It is available to the general public and is relatively uncensored.

The museum features among its exhibits Louisiana&#x27;s old electric chair, &quot;Gruesome Gertie&quot;, last used for the execution of Andrew Lee Jones on July 22, 1991. Angola Prison hosts the country&#x27;s only inmate-operated radio station, KLSP.

===Farming===
Inmates cultivate, harvest, and process various crops that make the facility self-supporting. Crops include cabbage, corn, cotton, strawberries, okra, onions, peppers, soybeans, squash, tomatoes, and wheat. In 2013, the prison resumed growing sugarcane, a practice stopped in the 1970s.

As of 2010, the prison had 2,000 head of cattle. Much of the herd is sold at markets for beef. Each year, the prison produces four million pounds of vegetable crops.

Inmates also breed and train the horses used for field work at Angola. Trustees are mounted to supervise workers in the fields. In 2010, the Angola Prison Horse Sale was initiated during the annual rodeos.

===Inmate education===
Angola offers literacy classes for prisoners with no high school diploma and no General Equivalency Diploma (GED) from Monday through Friday in the main prison and camps C-D and F. Angola also offers GED classes in the main prison and camps C-D and F. The prison also offers ABE (Adult Basic Education) classes for prisoners who have high school diplomas or GEDs but who have inadequate Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) scores to get into vocational school. SSD (Special School District #1) provides services for special education students.

Prisoners with satisfactory TABE scores may be admitted to vocational classes. Such classes include automotive technology, carpentry, culinary arts, graphic communications, horticulture, and welding. In 1995, a campus of the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary was established in the penitentiary following an invitation from the prison warden, Burl Cain. The school has significantly reduced the rate of violence in the prison.

In 1994, the United States Congress voted to eliminate prisoner eligibility for Pell Grants, making religious programs such as the New Orleans Baptist program the only ones in higher education available to prisoners. As of Spring 2008, 95 prisoners were students in the program. Angola also offers the PREP Pre-Release Exit and Re-Entry Programs for prisoners about to be released into the outside world.

Inmate library services are provided by the main Prison Library and four outcamp libraries. The prison is part of the Inter-Library Loan Program with the State Library of Louisiana.

===Manufacturing===
Angola has several manufacturing facilities. The Farm Warehouse (914) is the point of distribution of agricultural supplies. The Mattress/Broom/Mop shop makes mattresses and cleaning tools. The Printing Shop prints documents, forms, and other printed materials. The Range Herd group manages 1,600 head of cattle. The Row Crops group harvests crops. The Silk-Screen group produces plates, badges, road and highway signs, and textiles; it also manages sales of sign hardware. The Tag Plant produces license plates for Louisiana and overseas customers. The Tractor Repair shop repairs agricultural equipment. The Transportation Division delivers goods manufactured by the Prison Enterprises Division.

===Magazine===

&quot;The Angolite&quot; is the institution&#x27;s inmate-published and edited magazine, which began in 1975 or 1976. Each year, six issues are published. Louisiana prison officials believed an independently edited publication would help the prison. &quot;The Angolite&quot; gained a national reputation as a quality magazine and won international awards under two prisoner editors, Wilbert Rideau and Billy Sinclair, who became co-editors in 1978. Associate editor Ron Gene Wikberg joined them in 1988, moving up from a position as a staff writer. He worked on the magazine until gaining parole in 1992.

===Radio===
Angola is the only penitentiary in the U.S. to be issued an FCC radio station license. KLSP (Louisiana State Penitentiary) is a 100-watt radio station that operates at 91.7 on the FM dial from inside the prison to approximately 6,000 potential listeners including inmates and penitentiary staff. Inmates operate the station and carry some satellite programming. Inside the walls of Angola, KLSP is called the &quot;Incarceration Station&quot;. The station airs a variety of programming including gospel, jazz, blues, rock-n-roll, country, and oldies music, as well as educational and religious programs. The station has 20 hours of daily airtime, and all of the music aired by the station is donated. Music from His Radio and the Moody Ministry Broadcasting Network (MBN) airs during several hours of the day. Prisoners make the majority of broadcasting decisions.

A radio station was established in 1986 originally as a means of communication within the complex. Jenny Lee Rice of &quot;Paste&quot; wrote, &quot;the need to disseminate information rapidly is critical&quot; because Angola is the largest prison in the United States. The non-emergency uses of the station began in 1987 when Jimmy Swaggart, an evangelist, gave the prison old equipment from his radio network. In the early years, the radio station emphasized announcements and music more than religion, but it broadcast more religious programming in the early 21st century.

In 2001, Christian music artist Larry Howard of Chuck Colson&#x27;s Prison Fellowship visited the prison. He encouraged Jim Campbell, the President of Radio Training Network, to rebuild the station, which was off the air due to antiquated and broken equipment. His Radio Network Manager, Ken Mayfield, led a team that helped rebuild the station. It included Ted McCall (HIS Radio Chief Engineer), Jerry Williams (The Joy FM), Ben Birdsong (The Wind FM), Steve Swanson (WAFJ), and Rob Dempsey (HIS Radio). The team conducted an on-air radio fundraiser to buy new radio equipment. The fundraiser exceeded its $80,000 goal, raising more than $124,000 within three hours. Warden Burl Cain used the funds to update the radio equipment. Ken Mayfield returned several times to Angola to train prisoner DJs in using the new electronic systems. New equipment, including a new transmitter, allowed KLSP to broadcast in stereo for the first time, utilize satellite to expand its daily airtime to 20 hours, and upgrade its programming. As of 2012, KLSP had an output of 105 watts. Further than away from Angola on Louisiana Highway 61, the signal begins to fade. At , listeners can hear only white noise. Paul von Zielbauer of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Still, 100 watts does not push the station&#x27;s signal far beyond the prison gate.&quot; All 24 hours are devoted to religious programming. After religion became the primary focus, some inmates stopped listening to the station.

===Television===
The prison officials have started LSP-TV, a television station. According to Kalen Mary Ann Churcher of Pennsylvania State University, the television station follows the religious programming emphasis of the radio station more closely than it emulates reporting of &quot;The Angolite&quot;. But its prisoner staff and technicians also films prisoner events, such as the Angola Prison Rodeo, prize fights, and football games. As it has a closed circuit system, it allows even inmates on death row to watch the broadcasts.

===Burial of the deceased===
Coffins for deceased prisoners are manufactured by inmates on the prison grounds. Previously, deceased prisoners were buried in cardboard boxes. After one body fell through the bottom of a box, Warden Burl Cain changed a policy, allowing for the manufacture of proper coffins for the deceased.
In April 2006, Franklin Graham, son of evangelist Billy Graham, held a large meeting in the arena at Angola Prison. While there, he visited the woodworking shop where inmates built the caskets. Graham ordered two - one for each of his parents. Graham&#x27;s casket was placed in the Capitol Rotunda, where he lay in honor on February 28, 2018. 

===Death row===
In 1972, in the US Supreme Court decision in &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, the court found the application of the death penalty so arbitrary under existing state laws that it was unconstitutional. It suspended executions for all persons on death row in the United States (slightly more than 600, overwhelmingly male) under current state laws. It ordered state courts to judicially amend their sentences to the next lower level of severity, generally life in prison. Louisiana passed a new death penalty statute, which was overturned by the state supreme court in 1977 for its application to convictions for rape. The death penalty statute was amended again, effective September 1977. Louisiana did not execute any prisoners until 1983.

According to Louisiana Department of Corrections policy, inmates on death row are held in solitary confinement during the entire time they are incarcerated, even if appeals take years. This means that they are severely isolated and confined to their windowless cells for 23 hours per day. For one hour per day an inmate may shower and/or move up and down the halls under escort. An inmate is permitted to use the exercise yard thrice a week. Death row inmates can have several books at a time, and each inmate may have one five-minute personal telephone call per month. They may not participate in education or work programs. Death row inmates receive unlimited visitor access. Officers patrol the death row corridors nightly as a suicide prevention tactic.

Nick Trenticosta, a New Orleans attorney with the ACLU who is involved with prison issues, has said that warden Burl Cain treated death row inmates in a more favorable manner than did wardens of other death row prisons in the United States. Trenticosta said, &quot;It is not that these guys had super privileges. But Warden Cain was somewhat responsive to not only prisoners but to their families.&quot;

In March 2017, three death row inmates at Angola filed a federal class-action suit against the prison and LDOC over its solitary confinement policy, charging that it constituted &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; under the 8th Amendment to the US Constitution. Each of the men had been held in solitary for more than 25 years. The lawsuit describes basic conditions on death row:
* sparse cells, hot in summer, with little natural light
* lack of recreation
* no hobbies
* very little religion

This lawsuit was settled in October 2021, requiring that inmates on death row are granted a minimum of four hours out of their cells to congregate with other incarcerated people in their tier each day, at least five hours of communal outdoor recreation each week, the ability to worship together, evening time out of their cells on their tier, at least one meal with other prisoners per day, group classes and contact visitations.

===Execution===
Male death row inmates are moved from the Reception Center to a cell near the execution chamber in Camp F on the day of the execution. The only person informed of when a prisoner will be transferred is the Warden; this is for security reasons and not to disrupt the prison routine. On a scheduled execution date, an execution can occur between 6 p.m. and midnight. Michael L. Varnado and Daniel P. Smith of &quot;Victims of Dead Man Walking&quot; stated that, on many occasions, the rest of Angola is not aware of the execution being carried out. In 2003, Assistant Warden of the Reception Center Lee said that once death row inmates learn of the execution, they &quot;get a little quieter&quot; and &quot;[i]t suddenly becomes more real to them.&quot;

When the State of Louisiana used electrocution as its method of capital punishment, it formally referred to the anonymous executioner as &quot;The Electrician&quot;. When the State of Louisiana referred to the executioner by name, he was called &quot;Sam Jones&quot;, after Sam H. Jones, the Governor of Louisiana in power when electrocution was introduced as the capital punishment.

==Inmate life==
===Musical culture===
, several Angola inmates practiced musical skills. The prison administration encourages prisoners to practice music and uses music to reward inmates who behave.

In the 1930s John Lomax, a folklorist, and Alan Lomax, his son, traveled throughout the U.S. South to document African-American musical culture. Since prison farms, including Angola, were isolated from general society, the Lomaxes believed that prisons had the purest African-American song culture, as popular trends did not influence it. The Lomaxes recorded several songs, which were plantation-era songs that originated during the slavery era. The Lomaxes met Lead Belly, a famous musician, in Angola. Swamp blues musician Lightnin&#x27; Slim also served time in Angola for manslaughter in the 1930s and early 1940s.

From 1968 to 1970, WAFB-TV in Baton Rouge aired a weekly early-morning program, &quot;Good Morning, Angola Style&quot; featuring bands made up of Angola inmates. The show was hosted by Buckskin Bill Black, who developed the idea for the program after meeting one of the prison&#x27;s country music bands, The Westernaires, after performing at the 1967 Angola Prison Rodeo.

===Sexual slavery===
A 2010 memoir by Wilbert Rideau, an inmate at Angola from 1961 through 2005, states that &quot;slavery was commonplace in Angola with perhaps a quarter of the population in bondage&quot; throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. &quot;The New York Times&quot; states that weak inmates served as sex slaves who were raped, gang-raped, and traded and sold like cattle. Rideau stated, &quot;The slave&#x27;s only way out was to commit suicide, escape or kill his master.&quot; Herman Wallace and Albert Woodfox, members of the Angola 3, arrived at Angola in the late 1960s. They became active members of the prison&#x27;s chapter of the Black Panther Party, where they organized petitions and hunger strikes to protest conditions at the prison and helped new inmates protect themselves from rape and enslavement. C. Murray Henderson, one of the wardens brought in to clean up the prison, states in one of his memoirs that the systemic sexual slavery was sanctioned and facilitated by the officers.

=== Inmate mental health ===
==== Mental health and faith at Angola ====
Louisiana State Penitentiary has been known for its non-traditional mental health interventions. One such initiative is a faith-based prototype program for mental healthcare and inmate rehabilitation known as the Angola Prison Seminary. This model focuses on introducing inmates to faith and helping them to find value and purpose through it – be that internally or externally through serving as an Inmate Minister. Through this position, inmates are trained to offer counseling to other inmates, deliver sermons at religious services, officiate funerals for fellow prisoners, and deliver care packages to ill inmates. This model proved to be particularly effective in Louisiana State Penitentiary, especially with its &quot;sidewalk counseling&quot; component. In this type of guidance, the counseling inmate asks leading questions and helps to guide the other inmate to answering their own question, without revealing any positionality. This model positively impacted both the counselor and the advisee, as the counselor felt an increased sense of self-worth by helping someone else, and the advisee felt heard and seen, maybe for the first time in his life. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that this program can help inmates feel &quot;at peace with themselves and their lives&quot;. Reports noted that the Bible College behind bars made the prison feel significantly more relaxed than it truly was.

Faith is referenced many times as being a catalyst for positive change in the lives of lots of Louisiana State Penitentiary inmates. Author Mark Baker describes this connection in his book entitled &quot;You Can Change: Stories from Angola Prison and the Psychology of Personal Transformation&quot;. Here, Baker discusses how the high rates of reincarceration among Louisiana State Penitentiary inmates serves as an extremely demoralizing and discouraging reminder of the historical and systemic factors that landed them behind bars in the first place. Given the highly religious background of many of the inmates, who come largely from Louisiana, Mississippi, and other southern states, faith has proven to be a powerful motivator for many of the inmates in Angola. Baker discusses how inmates exposed to religious practices while incarcerated often went on to find a higher purpose in themselves and better avoid future reincarceration.

This faith-based approach to mental healthcare is also seen in palliative care at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Due to the predominantly older population of inmates at Louisiana State Penitentiary, the prison sees much higher rates of intake than releases, as many men pass away while incarcerated. In partnership with the University Hospital Community Hospice program based out of New Orleans, the Louisiana State Penitentiary has introduced a hospice program for terminally ill inmates. Inmate Ministers can assist in counseling with the ill inmates, as well as help them practice faith if they are interested in doing so. As seen with the other responsibilities they were assigned, this serious duty proved beneficial to not only the recipients but the Inmate Ministers as well.

Though the blend of mental healthcare and faith interventions has been controversial and yielded mixed results in many spaces, research like Baker&#x27;s suggests it works positively in Louisiana State Penitentiary. However, it is unclear why the large role of religion, particularly Christianity, in the Southern United States could be a major factor in this occurrence.

==== Violations of inmate rights ====
In 2021, a federal judge found that the Louisiana State Penitentiary violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in treating inmates requiring rehabilitative services. The judge, Chief U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick, ultimately ruled that the Louisiana State Penitentiary had committed a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and concluded her opinion by describing fifteen areas in which the prison required injunctive relief.

=== Inmate organizations ===
Inmate organizations include Angola Men of Integrity, the Lifers Organization, the Angola Drama Club, the Wonders of Joy, the Camp C Concept Club, and the Latin American Cultural Brotherhood. Angola is also the only penitentiary in the United States where inmates are allowed to independently run their own churches, a practice founded in the penitentiary&#x27;s history with slavery and one looked upon favorably by inmates.

===Angola Rodeo===

On one weekend in April and every Sunday in October, Angola holds the Angola Prison Rodeo. On each occasion, thousands of visitors enter the prison complex. Initiated with planning in 1964, the rodeo held its first events in 1965. Initially, it was held for prisoner recreation but attracted increasing crowds.

The prison charges admission. Due to the rodeo&#x27;s popularity, Angola built a 10,000-person stadium to support visitors; it opened in 2000. As part of the prison rodeo, the prison holds a semiannual Arts and Crafts Festival. In 2010, it started the Angola Prison Horse Sale, also during the rodeo.

===Programs for fathers===
Angola has two programs for fathers who are incarcerated at Angola. Returning Hearts is an event where prisoners may spend up to eight hours with their children in a Carnival-like celebration. Returning began in 2005; by 2010, 2,500 prisoners had participated in the program. Malachi Dads is a year-long program that uses the Christian Bible to teach how to improve a prisoner&#x27;s parenting skills. Malachi began in 2007; as of 2010, 119 men participated. It is based on Malachi 4:6,
&quot;He will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers ...&quot;

==Cultural references==
===Musical references===

The prison has held many musicians and has been the subject of several songs. Folk singer Lead Belly served over four years of his attempted murder sentence and was released early from Angola for good behavior. Tex-Mex artist Freddy Fender was pardoned from there.

The song &quot;Grown So Ugly&quot; by American blues musician and ex-convict Robert Pete Williams references Angola. The song&#x27;s lyrics have some basis in fact, as Williams was imprisoned there and was officially pardoned (from a murder charge) in 1964, the year the song says that he left the prison.

The classic New Orleans song &quot;Junco Partner&quot; includes the lines:

In the Clash&#x27;s version of &quot;Junco Partner&quot;, the lines are a little bit different:

Aaron and Charles Neville wrote &quot;Angola Bound&quot;:

Angola is also featured in the Neville Brothers song &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; on the album &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;.

Folklorist Harry Oster recorded &quot;Angola Prison Worksongs&quot; for his Folklyric Records in 1959, now re-released on Arhoolie Records. According to Oster, between 1929 and 1940, 10,000 floggings were carried out in Angola.

Singer Gil Scott-Heron wrote and recorded the song &quot;Angola, Louisiana&quot; on his 1978 album with Brian Jackson, &quot;Secrets&quot;. The song deals with the imprisonment of inmate Gary Tyler.

Canadian blues and roots musician Rita Chiarelli filmed the documentary &quot;Music from the Big House&quot; at Angola in 2010. The film, directed by Bruce McDonald, focuses on a concert at the prison, organized by Chiarelli, that featured four bands comprising musicians incarcerated in Angola.

Comprising the entire B-Side of his album &quot;Remedies&quot;, New Orleans musician Dr. John features an extended 17:35 song titled &quot;Angola Anthem&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Myshkin recorded &quot;Angola&quot; in 1998 for her album &quot;Blue Gold&quot;. The song refers to the case of former Angola warden C. Murray Henderson, who was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the attempted murder of his wife, writer Anne Butler:

New Orleans rap artist Juvenile has part of a verse in the Hot Boys song &quot;Dirty World&quot; that says:

New Orleans pianist James Booker mentions Angola prison in his cover of &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot;; where he was sent for heroin possession:

(Booker was less than 10 years old when Lead Belly died, so they would not have been there at the same time.)

Ray Davies recorded a song entitled &quot;Angola (Wrong Side of the Law)&quot;, which was released as a bonus track on the expanded release of &quot;Working Man&#x27;s Café&quot; in February 2008.

The American folk singer David Dondero, in the song &quot;20 years&quot;, describes the experiences of a prisoner released from Angola prison:

Jazz trumpeter Christian Scott has a track on his 2010 album &quot;Yesterday You Said Tomorrow&quot; called &quot;Angola, LA &amp; the 13th Amendment&quot;

Texas Country Music artist Sam Riggs of Sam Riggs and the Night People (Austin, Texas) wrote and recorded a song called &quot;Angola&#x27;s Lament&quot;. It was released in 2013 on the &quot;Outrun the Sun&quot; album.

American folk rock duo Indigo Girls reference Angola in the song &quot;The Rise of the Black Messiah&quot; from their 2015 album &quot;One Lost Day&quot;.

<text>Equinoctial France (French: &quot;France équinoxiale&quot;) was the contemporary name given to the colonization efforts of France in the 17th century in South America, around the line of the equator, before &quot;tropical&quot; had fully gained its modern meaning: Equinoctial means in Latin &quot;of equal nights&quot;, i.e., on the equator, where the duration of days and nights is nearly the same year round. The settlement was made in what is now known as the Bay of São Luis and lasted for 3 years.

The French colonial empire in the New World also included New France (&quot;Nouvelle France&quot;) in North America, extending from Canada to Louisiana, and for a short period (12 years) also included the colony of Antarctic France (&quot;France Antarctique&quot;, in French), in present-day Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. All of these settlements were in violation of the papal bill of 1493, which divided the New World between Spain and Portugal. This division was later defined more exactly by the Treaty of Tordesillas.

==History==

The establishment of &quot;France Équinoxiale&quot; commenced in 1612, when a French expedition departed from Cancale, Brittany, France, under the command of Daniel de la Touche, Seigneur de la Ravardière, and Admiral François de Razilly. Carrying 500 colonists, it arrived on the northern coast of what is today the Brazilian state of Maranhão. De la Ravardière had discovered the region in 1604 but the death of the king, Henry IV postponed his plans to start its colonization.

The colonists soon founded a village, Saint-Louis, in honor of the French king Louis IX. This later became São Luís in Portuguese, the only Brazilian state capital founded by France. On 8 September, Capuchin friars prayed the first mass, and the soldiers started building a fortress. An important difference in relation to France Antarctique is that this new colony was not motivated by escape from religious persecutions by Protestant Huguenots (see French Wars of Religion).

The colony did not last long. A Portuguese army assembled in the Captaincy of Pernambuco, under the command of Alexandre de Moura, was able to mount a military expedition, which defeated and expelled the French colonists in 1615, less than four years after their arrival in the land. Thus, it repeated the disaster spelt for the colonists of France Antarctique, in 1567. A few years later, in 1620, Portuguese and Brazilian colonists arrived in number and São Luís started to develop, with an economy based mostly in sugar cane and slavery.

French traders and colonists tried again to settle a France Équinoxiale further North, in what is today French Guiana, in 1626, 1635 (when the capital, Cayenne, was founded) and 1643. Twice a Compagnie de la France Équinoxiale was founded, in 1643 and 1645, but both foundered as a result of misfortune and mismanagement. It was only after 1674, when the colony came under the direct control of the French crown and a competent Governor took office, that France Équinoxiale became a reality. To this day, French Guiana is a department of France.

<text>Chromotherapy, sometimes called color therapy, colorology or cromatherapy, is an alternative medicine that is considered pseudoscience and quackery. Chromotherapists claim to be able to use light in the form of color to balance &quot;energy&quot; lacking from a person&#x27;s body, whether it be on physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental levels. For example, they thought that shining a colored light on a person would cure constipation. Historically, chromotherapy has been associated with mysticism and occultism.

Color therapy is unrelated to photomedicine, such as phototherapy and blood irradiation therapy, which are scientifically accepted medical treatments for a number of conditions, as well as being unrelated to photobiology, which is the scientific study of the effects of light on living organisms.

== History ==
Avicenna (980–1037), seeing color as of vital importance both in diagnosis and in treatment, discussed chromotherapy in &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;. He wrote that &quot;color is an observable symptom of disease&quot; and also developed a chart that related color to the temperature and physical condition of the body. His view was that red moved the blood, blue or white cooled it, and yellow reduced muscular pain and inflammation.

Pioneer of photography Robert Hunt performed experiments on the effects of different wavelengths of light on the germination and growth of plants, detailed in his 1844 book &quot;Researches on Light&quot;. Apparently influenced by this work, from 1860 Augustus Pleasonton started to conduct original experiments, and in 1876 published the book &quot;The Influence of the Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue Color of the Sky&quot;, detailing how the color blue can improve the growth of crops and livestock and can help heal diseases in humans. This led to the birth of modern chromotherapy, influencing contemporary scientists Dr. Seth Pancoast and Edwin Dwight Babbitt to conduct experiments and publish &quot;Blue and Red Light; or, Light and Its Rays as Medicine&quot; (1877) and &quot;The Principles of Light and Color&quot; (1878) respectively.

Pancoast&#x27;s book has been described by historians as a confusing mix of color therapy, mysticism and occultism. He held a lifelong interest in the Kabbalah and was a founding member of the Theosophical Society. Pancoast held the view that God is light and &quot;the one universal pathological agent&quot; that could cure disease. He would expose medications to colored light before administering them to a patient and also utilized sun-baths fitted with colored panes of glass. Throughout the 19th century &quot;color healers&quot; claimed colored glass filters could treat many diseases, including constipation and meningitis. In Germany in the late 1890s, Georg von Langsdorff promoted Babbitt&#x27;s ideas and mixed color therapy with psychometry and spiritualism.

The Buddhist monk Bhante Dharmawara was a notable advocate of color therapy who promoted the use of green, blue and yellow for health. Other notable advocates include Anthroposophist Theo Gimbel who authored many books on the subject and founded the Hygeia Institute for Colour Therapy in 1968.

===Dinshah P. Ghadiali===

In 1933, Indian scientist Dinshah P. Ghadiali published &quot;The Spectro Chromemetry Encyclopaedia&quot;, a work on color therapy. Ghadiali claimed to have discovered why and how the different colored rays have various therapeutic effects on organisms. He believed that colors represent chemical potencies in higher octaves of vibration, and for each organism and system of the body there is a particular color that stimulates and another that inhibits the work of that organ or system. He also thought that, by knowing the action of the different colors upon the different organs and systems of the body, one can apply the correct color that will tend to balance the action of any organ or system that has become abnormal in its function or condition. The American Medical Association published refutations of Ghadiali&#x27;s color therapy claims. In 1958, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) facilitated a permanent injunction against Ghadiali&#x27;s Visible Spectrum Research Institute.

Ghadiali&#x27;s son, Darius Dinshah, continues to provide information about color therapy via his Dinshah Health Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing non-pharmaceutical home color therapy, and his book &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;.

==Colored chakras==
Practitioners of ayurvedic medicine believe the body has seven &quot;chakras&quot;, which some claim are &#x27;spiritual centers&#x27;, and are thought to be located along the spine. New Age thought associates each of the chakras with a single color of the visible light spectrum, along with a function and organ or bodily system. According to this view, the chakras can become imbalanced and result in physical and mental diseases, but application of the appropriate color can allegedly correct such imbalances.

== Scientific rejection ==

Chromotherapy is regarded by health experts and historians as pseudoscience and quackery.

According to a book published by the American Cancer Society, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that alternative uses of light or color therapy are effective in treating cancer or other illnesses&quot;. Regarding Dinshah Ghadiali&#x27;s work, science writer Martin Gardner had described him as &quot;perhaps the greatest quack of them all&quot;. According to Gardner, photographs of Ghadiali at work in his laboratory are &quot;indistinguishable from stills of a grade D movie about a mad scientist&quot;.

Historian Deborah Ascher Barnstone has noted that chromotherapy is &quot;distinct from scientifically verified light treatments such as neonatal jaundice treatment. As, unlike chromotherapy, the light used in such therapies, whether scientifically proven or not, was not always colored, their particulars are not relevant in this context.&quot;

Photobiology, the term for the scientific study of the effects of light on living tissue, has sometimes been used instead of the term chromotherapy in an effort to distance it from its roots in Victorian mysticism and to strip it of its associations with symbolism and magic. Light therapy is a specific treatment approach using high intensity light to treat specific sleep, skin and mood disorders.

A review of the existing research on chromotherapy found that there is no evidence to support a causal link between specific colors to health outcomes, there is not enough evidence to support a causal link between specific colors and emotional or mental states, and there is no research to suggest there exists one-to-one relationships between specific colors and emotions.

Chromotherapy has been accused of oversimplifying psychological responses to colors, making sweeping statements based on myths or beliefs that lack empirical support. Guidelines for chromotherapy lack consistency and appear to be subjective judgements that have inconclusive and nonspecific applicability in healthcare systems. While twelve colors have been reported as beneficial for health and well-being, a rigorous definition of each of these colors has yet to be provided, making it impossible to know if all color therapists are using the same wavelengths for these colors.

More recently, concern regarding the theory has questioned the risks associated with the emergence of light-emitting diode (LED) based lamps that have been created for use in chromotherapy, these lamps are classified as low risk for exposure and do not require any warnings to accompany the products. However, certain chromotherapy procedures require the individual to place the lamps near their eyes, which is not the recommended use for these lights and may alter the exposure duration to a level that can cause risk of retinal damage. With no consensus or regulation regarding how these products are to be used and whether eyewear is required, this treatment puts participants at risk for serious eye damage.

<doc id="1061914" wikidata="Q7334925" url="?curid=1061914" title="Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College">
<text>Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College was an American circus school which trained around 1,400 clowns in the &quot;Ringling style&quot; from its founding in 1968 until its closure in 1997.

==History==
Clown College was the brainchild of Irvin Feld, the owner of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, and longtime Ringling clown and front man Bill Ballantine. In 1968, Ringling had only a handful of clowns, most of them over fifty years of age. It was clear that these performers would not be able to go on forever. But there was a dearth of suitable replacements at that time. So Feld decided to create a school to train a new generation in this ancient art form.

Feld also saw the potential public relations opportunity in having a place that could become the Mecca of clowning in the United States. In addition, he wanted to use the school as another way of keeping his show more attractive to audiences than his competition, and have a place where he could guarantee getting an endless supply of new talent.

Circus World was planned in September 1972 to have the clown college&#x27;s campus on site.

In 1984, after Feld&#x27;s death, Kenneth Feld, his son, took over production of Feld Entertainment and the Ringling shows. In 1993, the clown college was moved from the Venice Arena to Baraboo, Wisconsin. He continued to operate the school through the 1997 session, and then closed Clown College because it was no longer necessary: with nearly fifteen hundred graduates, many of whom were teaching others the lessons they had learned, and with a home videotape produced by Ringling and made at Clown College in 1986 titled &quot;Be A Clown&quot;, which featured many of the techniques used in the school&#x27;s training sessions, Ringling Bros and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus officially discontinued their Clown College just shy of its 30th year.

Two notable national events took place involving Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College. The first occurred on February 17, 1988, when CBS Television broadcast the &quot;Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College: 20th Anniversary&quot; special. This hour long program was hosted by Dick Van Dyke and it featured a cadre of clown alumni, performing their favorite routines, as well as Van Dyke, in character as the school custodian &quot;Burford&quot;, who was trying to pick up some of the &quot;course material&quot; on the sly.

The second was on August 4, 1992, when Ringling created &quot;Smiles Across America&quot;, an event done locally in cities and towns across the country to raise awareness of various issues and to help make people happier. Clown College graduates performed such civic duties as visiting hospitals and parks and appeared for photo ops and did &quot;meet &amp; greet&quot; with the media and the general public.

Van Dyke and long time &quot;Today Show&quot; weatherman Willard Scott, the first person to portray Ronald McDonald in a television advertisement, are both honorary graduates of the school.

After 25 years the college moved from Venice, Florida to Baraboo, Wisconsin, hometown of the Ringling Bros. After three years in Baraboo, the clown college operated at the Sarasota Opera House in Sarasota until 1998 before the program was suspended. The college continued to operate after closing the facility, albeit in a different form. It was run in different locales in and around Rosemont, Illinois until 2015. In 2017, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus folded, but returned in 2023, no longer featuring any animal performances.

==Operation==

Clown College was a unique institution for several reasons. First, the method to apply to the school was an extensive written personality profile that gave the directors an opportunity to have an understanding of the applicant&#x27;s psychology, interests and previous experience. The circus also held in-person auditions at most stops along the route to drum up interest in the show and to get a range of people from all over the United States to apply.

Next, tuition was free (though students were responsible for their own room and board, as well as any other incidental expenses incurred), and a graduate from the school finished the term with a full &quot;Agent Suit&quot; or specific clown costume, including a wig and proper clown shoes and a complete make-up kit, as well as the training needed to be a good clown performer.

Each yearly session was held in the fall. The number of students admitted to any year&#x27;s session varied but it ranged from thirty to fifty, with the vast majority being men. The ratio of men to women in a Clown College class was roughly 8 to 1.

The Clown College session over the years ranged from approximately thirteen weeks down to ten and a half weeks before it was eventually scaled back to an eight-week course in its final years. Students would work together or &quot;play off&quot; each other 8 hours a day, six days a week preparing material for the &quot;Big Show&quot; (Clown College served as a think tank to create new gags for the circus) and learning all of the basics of clowning. Typical classes included make-up application, costume design, acrobatics, juggling, stilt walking, pantomime and other skills training. Films of classic performers like Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and The Three Stooges were studied, as were the cartoon work of Wile E. Coyote and Bugs Bunny.

The entire session was one long audition for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, as the instructors took note of which students had what they were looking for to fill the positions for the new season&#x27;s show, which began several weeks after the Clown College session ended. Chosen graduates received a one-year contract to travel with &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, which they were obliged to accept. (This was Ringling&#x27;s only stipulation for all students who agreed to receive the school&#x27;s free training, but was only added after several students declined job offers at the end of the session. The first two to do so were Penn Jillette and Bill Irwin in 1973 and 1974, respectively.) Grads not selected to tour were often given opportunities to perform in other capacities within the Feld Organization, sometimes were added to the show&#x27;s clown alley at a later date, or became a member of any of a collection of other circuses that sought well-trained clowns for their shows.

==Clown style==
The particular &quot;Ringling Style&quot; of clowning taught at Clown College was rooted in the American type of clown performance, with an accent towards broad and slapstick type humor, as opposed to the European approach which was typically more subtle. Because of the &quot;three ring&quot; configuration of the Ringling show, and the bigger arenas that were needed to present such an attraction, audiences were larger and many patrons sat in balconies or upper decks, far above the action. In order to reach the people in every area of these larger arenas, clowns on the Ringling show had to design their makeup to be seen at a distance, and use their props and clear physical movements to show the audience what was happening during a gag, no matter where in the house they were seated. The training given here was tailored for the Ringling show, but could be transferred to other circus styles.

<text>Güntersberge () is a village and a former town in Harz District, in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. It has held the status of an officially recognized resort town since 2001. Güntersberge, together with the other municipalities of the former &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;collective municipality&quot;) Unterharz, merged into the town of Harzgerode as of 1 August 2009.

==Geography==
The settlement is located in the upper Selke Valley, in the lower eastern part of the Harz mountain range close to the border with Thuringia. In the northwest, down the scenic Selke Valley Trail, is the abandoned village of Selkenfelde. In the southwest is the Katzsohlteich reservoir of the Katzsohlbach, a right tributary of the Selke river. The Steinfurtbach and other numerous mountain brooks run through the area.

Güntersberge station is a stop on the Selke Valley Railway, part of the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways network, running from Quedlinburg up the Harz range to Hasselfelde. The &quot;Bundesstraße 242&quot; highway runs through the area.

==History==

Nearby Güntersburg Castle was first mentioned in 1326, then located on important trade routes through the Harz mountains. The settlement of Güntersberge itself was documented as a town in 1437. Temporarily given in pawn to the Landgraves of Thuringia and the comital House of Stolberg, it was purchased by the Ascanian prince George III of Anhalt-Dessau in 1546. From 1603 the area belonged the Principality of Anhalt-Bernburg, from 1635 to 1709 to Anhalt-Harzgerode. Güntersberge remained part of the Free State of Anhalt until 1945.

After World War II the eastern Harz region was located in the Soviet occupation zone and became part of East Germany in 1949. From 1952 to 1990, it was part of the Bezirk Halle of East Germany. Güntersberge was the site of a large summer camp run by the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation.

<doc id="1061921" wikidata="Q7427114" url="?curid=1061921" title="2005 Saudi Arabian municipal elections">
<text>Municipal elections for 178 municipalities were held in Saudi Arabia between 10 February and 21 April 2005. The first to be held in the country since the 1960s, the elections were held in three stages: the first on 10 February around the capital city of Riyadh, the second in the east and southwest on 3 March, and the third, in the north, on 21 April.

Male citizens over the age of 21 voted for half of the members of their municipal councils. On 11 October 2004, Prince Nayef bin Abd al-Aziz, the Saudi Interior Minister, announced to a Kuwaiti newspaper that women would not be able to run as candidates or vote in the elections: &quot;I do not think that women&#x27;s participation is possible.&quot; Elections officials noted logistical concerns, such as the lack of separate women&#x27;s voting booths and the fact that many women do not have identification cards, as well as opposition from conservative religious traditionalists. Saudi women&#x27;s rights campaigner Hatoon al-Fassi felt that authorities giving a practical reason for non-participation of women rather than a religious reason constituted a success for women&#x27;s campaigning, since arguing against practical objections is easier than arguing against religious objections. Prince Mansour bin Turki bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud expressed the hope that women would be able to vote in the 2009 elections. In March 2011, the delayed elections were announced for 23 April 2011.

==Election results of Riyadh region==
On 10 February 2005, the first round of the elections was realized in the Riyadh region and Islamists won the majority, taking all the seven available seats. A total of 646 candidates were on the list. Those who were not chosen accused the Saudi religious establishment for using the backing of to get votes, and breaking election laws for campaigning on the election day. The winners, on the other hand, denied all these allegations. In the election campaigns, those who used ads in newspapers, posters or other ways to meet the potential voters that are much more traditional election strategies did not win in the election, while those who did not employ any of these strategies won in the election. However, the winners employed much more advanced strategies such as internet and mobile phones that is regarded as a tactic frequently preferred by Islamist groupings in the region to expand their ideas.

==Election results in other cities==
In Jeddah, the most liberal Saudi city, all the seven winning candidates were those supported by the prominent conservative religious scholars among 530 candidates. Five of the six winners in Buraydah, the capital of the very conservative Qaseem province, also gained a similar clerical support. Islamists won all the seats in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina as well. In the eastern regions, several non-Islamist candidates were elected on 3 March 2005. Shiites swept the board in the town of Qatif and won five out of six seats in al-Hasa. However, in the urban centres of the eastern regions such as Dammam, Dhahran and Al Khobar that are inhabited by considerable Shi’ite population Sunni candidates won the seats with the help of the support they secured from fundamentalist clerics.

<doc id="1061925" wikidata="Q388615" url="?curid=1061925" title="Cantona (archaeological site)">
<text>Cantona (La casa del sol) is a Mesoamerican archaeological site in Mexico. It is located between 2,450 and 2,600 meters above sea level in the state of Puebla, on the border with the state of Veracruz. The site lies about an hour&#x27;s drive from the city of Puebla and about an hour and a half from Xalapa, Veracruz. Limited archaeological work has been done at the site. It is estimated that only one to ten per cent of the site can be seen.

At its peak, Cantona was a walled, fortified city with a high level of urbanization. Its original inhabitants are unknown, but it is speculated that it was inhabited by Olmec-Xicalanca groups towards the late Classical Period.

Cantona sat astride an old trading route between the Gulf Coast and the Central Highlands and was a prominent, if isolated, Mesoamerican city between 600 and 1000 CE. It was abandoned after AD 1050.

Its maximum apogee is placed at the epiclassical Mesoamerica period, that is, the period during which Teotihuacan ceased to be the main power center in the region and small regional states sought to gain control of the various trade routes. Cantona was one of these regional centers, and controlled Sierra Madre Oriental resources.

The Pre-Columbian settlement area occupies approximately 12 km2, distributed in three units, of which the largest is at the south, with an area of fivekm2. In Cantona 24 ballgame courts have been discovered, more than in any other mesoamerican site, as well as a series of small pyramids. The Zaragoza obsidian mine is located nearby. It has an elevated Acropolis over the rest of the city in which the main buildings of the city were built. This was used for the ruling elite and priests, and was where the temples of the most important deities where located.

The site comprises a road network with over 500 cobblestone causeways, more than 3,000 individual patios, residences, 24 ball courts and an elaborate acropolis with multiple ceremonial buildings and temples.

These impressive buildings were constructed with carved stones (one atop the other) without any Stucco or cement mortar. Its population is estimated at 80,000 inhabitants at its peak. It is believed that trade was an important activity. It certainly was built with a definite urban design and walkways connecting each and every part of the city. The &quot;First Avenue&quot; is 563 meters in length. Cantona was contemporary of Teotihuacan.

Its inhabitants were mainly agricultural farmers and traders, particularly for obsidian, obtained from Oyameles-Zaragoza mountains surrounding the city. Additionally, they may have been supplying the lowlands with a derivative of the maguey plant, pulque. After Chichimec&#x27;s invasions in the 11th century, Cantona was abandoned.

So far, 27 ballgame courts have been found in Cantona, a quantity that symbolizes the power maintained over other peoples by managing the largest ceremonial center of their time, where the losers in the game were slaughtered, a source of pride for the people.

==Site history==

Henri de Saussure claimed to have discovered Cantona in 1855 after a lengthy and prolonged search, Nicolás León, based on a Saussure publication, visited the zone in the early 1900s and explored the site, he left a full and comprehensive description of structures and surface objects at that time. Cantona is derived from the Nahuatl word Caltonal which means &quot;House of the Sun&quot;.

In 1938, Paul Gendrop mentions that Cantona occupies an area of almost 20 km long by 12 kilometers wide. As for the site&#x27;s architectonic elements distribution, he noted that it is formed by numerous rectangular rooms 20 to 30 meters long by 12 to 20 meters wide, delimited by thick stone walls, fairly straight and well preserved.

Eduardo Noguera, in 1958, after a tentative study of ceramics and constructive systems, noted that Cantona occupies only half the size of what was previously calculated by Paul Gendrop and locates it, chronologically in the preclassical horizon (200 to 100 BC), coinciding with data available then.

In 1980 archaeologist Diana Lopez de Molina, based on aerial photographs, made a sketch of the settlement and dug some stratigraphic wells that allowed her to propose a tentative timeline to the occupation of the area. Previous studies allow the assumption that this prehispanic city was occupied from the late preclassical horizon (200 BC) to the early classic (0 to 200 AD), which makes it one of the oldest cities of the country.

According to investigation, Cantona would be chronologically situated between 600 and 1000 AD; its splendor coincides with the fall of the main cities of the classical horizon (it is even thought it had something to do with the Teotihuacan fall, by obstructing passage of products from the coast to the Highlands) and with the arrival of warrior people who soon seized and dominated the region.

==The site==

The site covers about 12 square kilometers. For study purposes it was divided into three large units. The southern part is the best preserved part. The Acropolis (area where the main structures are located, believed to be the shelter of political, economic and religious powers), is a good example of the settlement.

The site is made up by many patios of approximately 50 x 40 meters, or even larger; in some of them obsidian and stone workshops (stone tools) were found, hence a clear division and specialization of its inhabitants work is deduced. According to García Cook, rural people settled in low lands, leaving people with social rank the intermediate areas and, finally, at the top were temples, ball games, and the houses of chiefs and leaders. Evidence indicate that the patios were residential places for Cantona family groups; such is the amount, that in sector V, 620 patios were detected and 997 mounds, including housing units, altars and pyramids.

Its architecture is absent of stucco as decoration element, although mud was possibly used to join volcanic rock in addition to the technique of placing stone on stone, as was done to shape walls, alleys, platforms and other archaeological structures. There are two large prehispanic roads; these avenues are framed by high and thick volcanic stone walls, (some of them more than a kilometer long) that together with the streets and roads allowed access to the patios and ceremonial areas, constituting an important access control to the city and internal urban areas; this great fortress also had a moat that protected the city on its limits with the Valley, from possible invasions from this sector.

In the highest areas are located ceremonial nature structures as ballgame courts (over 24) 12 of them have a special distribution which has been termed &quot;Cantona type&quot;, because it has integrated architectural complexes in which generally are a pyramid, one or two plazas, an altar, and several peripheral structures; there is uneven symmetry on its walls, there are discrepancies in orientation or measures. Recent studies indicate that Cantona was besieged by foreign groups, which together with strong climate change, ended up affecting the city, leading to its abandonment.

The construction system and size included in its three units, has been considered the most urbanized city known so far in the central Mexican Plateau. Its size is surprising, its roads and stone walls, by its patios and ballgame courts, but more surprising of all is to learn that, all visited in the site (3 km), and the structures available comprise only 10% of the total of this prehispanic city.

It is assumed that water in this area was scarce, but did not limit construction of towering pyramids, housing spaces and narrow streets to maintain order in the different social standards that existed at that time, only two people can walk on the streets at the time because of narrow streets, in addition to street side walls for better control. The Earth Fertility Plaza is one of the most popular visits, because of phallic sculptures found, the two votive axes and all other material found, and is considered one of the most important findings. Cantona began declining as of 950 and 1000 and by 1100 was completely abandoned, without any current definition as to the reason why settlers migrated, although it was a prosperous and superbly constructed site.

==Chronology==

The history of Cantona is divided into several different phases of development spanning approximately 2,000 years, from around 1000 B.C.E. until the city was finally abandoned around 1050 C.E.

Pre-Cantona (1,000/900 B.C.E - 600 B.C.E.) The first settlers began to occupy this area which would later form a vast city. Pottery shards from the pre-Cantona period tell us that the early settlers came from the Poblano-Tlaxcalteca Valley and the Tehuacan Valley, and later from the Gulf of Mexico and the East. At this time Cantona consisted of a few sparse settlements with no fortification or defined plan. Between 900 and 750 A.C., two villas occupied the center and southern portion of the area where the city would later develop, and one or two villages existed to the North or Northeast. Little is known about the architecture of this phase, although the city had not yet developed complex fortifications, walls or streets that would characterize later stages of development. Cantona began exploiting and trading in obsidian obtained from the nearby Zaragoza-Oyameles Mountains of northeastern Puebla. Obsidian was a valuable resource used for weapons, tools, and artifacts to conduct ritual auto-sacrfice. The Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian source would ultimately turn Cantona into one of the largest and most prosperous cities in prehispanic Mesoamerica.

In the late pre-Cantona period, between 750 - 600 A.C., the city began to develop joined housing, some streets in its interior, as well as paths to connect with other settlements.

Cantona I (600 B.C.E. - 50 C.E.) Fueled by mining local obsidian, Cantona entered a phase of rapid urban development with the city reaching a size of approximately 822 acres. The city began developing defensive systems and more complex internal traffic circulation, and raised platforms constructed of pieces of volcanic rock supporting thatched houses. Silos were built to store grain; these silos were strategically located to ensure control by the city elite. In addition to family workshops, areas were specially designated for specialized, state-controlled workshops. Ceremonial centers began to develop as rectangular plazas with pyramids. By the end of this phase, the city had built sixteen ballcourts, six of which were aligned with ceremonial plazas, altars, and pyramids. This phase also shows evidence of large-scale commercial trade with southern and southeastern Mexico.

Cantona II (50 C.E. - 600 C.E.) This period saw a flurry of construction activity correlated with increased social complexity. This is considered to have been the first major cultural peak in Cantona&#x27;s history. Cantona now covered 2,718 acres and by 150 - 200 C.E. contained twenty ballcourts, half of which were aligned with ceremonial centers. By 400 C.E., the city had a population of 64,000.

Cantona III (600 C.E. - 900/950 C.E.) This was a period of significant change in governmental leadership, as the priest class was supplanted by military authority. While religious rituals did not disappear, the city ceased producing ceramic effigies of gods and stone sculpture.

Cantona IV (900/950 C.E. - 1000/1050 C.E.) This final period is primarily characterized by a rapid depopulation of the city. Cantona&#x27;s population was reduced to no more than three to five thousand individuals, before disappearing completely.

==About the name==
There are many studies and investigations, by multiple entities, it has been established that the ancient city was developed the Olmec or Chichimec culture, but the only safe conclusion reached so far is that a lot of investigation remains, because only 1 percent of the total of this archaeological area was investigated and the remaining 99 per cent is still under the grass, trees, soil and rocks.

The discrepancy about the origins of this place starts with the name, because while officially known as Cantona, for San Pedro Tepeyahualco native inhabitants the real name is Caltona.

<text>Steinar Bastesen (26 March 1945 – 18 February 2024) was a Norwegian politician, fisherman and whaler. He was first elected to the Norwegian Storting in 1997 as an independent candidate, and in 1999 broke out and founded the Coastal Party (&quot;Kystpartiet&quot;). He headed the party from its founding until March 2005, when internal disparity among the members forced him to give up his leadership. Bastesen kept his seat in the Storting until the 2005 election six months later.

==Life and career==
Steinar Bastesen was born on the island of Dønna to fisherman Ingvart Meyer Bastesen and housewife Karly Edvarda, née Edvardsen. He first participated in whaling with his father and in 1953, aged 8, and bought his first whaler ship in 1971 wen he was 26. Later the same year he received an award from the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue for rescuing people on a wrecked ship with his whaler ship during a severe storm. Bastesen became actively involved in local industry and politics in the late 1970s and later held elected positions in the organization for Norway&#x27;s fishermen, Norges Fiskarlag, and in the sale&#x27;s organization for fish, Norges Råfisklag. He was leader of an organization for whalers, Norges Småkvalfangerlag, from 1984 to 1996. In the 1980s he was active as a local politician for the Centre Party and later for the Conservative Party, before he later became a member of parliament for the Non-Partisan Deputies (1997–2001) and the Coastal Party (2001–2005). In 2005, he resigned from the leadership position after internal disputes, and was later dismissed from the party altogether in 2008. He briefly attempted a return to politics for the Non-Partisan Deputies in 2009, but failed to the required votes. He returned to the Coastal Party in 2017, but again failed to get enough votes to get elected.

Bastesen was best known for his vigorous advocacy of whaling, and usually appeared on television or at events wearing a seal-fur vest, which was met with controversy, especially abroad. While attending a trade convention in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 1994, his vest was confiscated as it violated American import laws on whaling products, but was returned to him via mail two years later. In 1997, Canadian anti-whaling activist Paul Watson claimed in an NRK interview that Bastesen had threatened to kill him. Bastesen vehemently denied the allegation, and sued NRK for defamation of character by letting the interview air. Bastesen won in the Oslo District Court, but lost in the appeal court in 2002 as the court found that Watson&#x27;s accusation was of journalistic interest.

In 1998, Bastesen said that the whale Keiko, known from the &quot;Free Willy&quot; films, should be killed and the meat sent to Africa as foreign aid. This was his response to hearing that millions of dollars were being spent on preparing the whale for returning to the wild.

===Health issues and death===
Bastesen struggled with health issues for the last decades of his life, which he later said was a result of an unhealthy lifestyle, excessive drinking, and overworking himself. In late 2001, he suffered a series of strokes that left him hospitalized for several months and during the first weeks it was unclear whether or not he would survive, but he eventually made a full recovery. In 2009, he again suffered a minor stroke while celebrating his 64th birthday, but recovered quickly. Soon after was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but made a full recovery. Bastesen began exercising and changing his lifestyle to avoid further health issues, losing 30 kgs (66 lbs) of weight.

Bastesen died in a drowning accident near his home on 18 February 2024, at the age of 78.

<doc id="1061938" wikidata="Q913860" url="?curid=1061938" title="North American Hockey League">
<text>The North American Hockey League (NAHL) is one of the top junior hockey leagues in the United States and is in its 50th season of operation in 2024–25. It is the only Tier II junior league sanctioned by USA Hockey, and acts as an alternative for those who would not or did not make the roster of a team in the Major Junior Canadian Hockey League (CHL) nor Tier I United States Hockey League (USHL). The NAHL is one of the oldest junior hockey leagues in the United States and is headquartered in Addison, Texas.

The teams span the United States from Maine in the East to Alaska in the Northwest and to Texas in the South. The teams play a 59-game regular season, usually starting on the 2nd weekend in September and ending near mid-April (2020–21 season is exception, the season started in late 2020-early 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The Champions of each division(not regular season) will play in Blaine, MN at the Fogarty Arena and will compete for the Robertson Cup Champion.

Under USA Hockey Tier II sanctioning, NAHL teams do not charge players to play and also provide players with uniforms, team clothing and select equipment such as sticks, gloves and helmets. Players without local family live with billet families in their area and pay a monthly stipend that covers food and other costs. Unlike the Tier I United States Hockey League, there are no roster restrictions in the NAHL on overage players, which allows for the older players to gain extra NCAA exposure as well as teams to retain a veteran core. Teams are still bound to USA Hockey rules regarding import players, and presently each team is allowed to have four non-American players on their roster. Import players may also apply for an exemption from being counted as an import, but only if they have played hockey in the United States for four years prior.

From its beginning in 1975, the NAHL was primarily a 6–12-team league based in the Midwest, known as the Great Lakes Junior Hockey League and changed the name to the North American Hockey League in 1984. The league&#x27;s all-time leading scorer is Ryan Fultz who tallied 246 points in four seasons. Other notable alumni from the NAHL include Pat LaFontaine, Mike Modano, Doug Weight, Pat Peake, Brian Rolston, Brian Holzinger, Brian Rafalski, Todd Marchant, John Scott, Connor Hellebuyck, and George Parros. In 2003, the league merged with the now defunct America West Hockey League to form a 19-team league.

<doc id="1061947" wikidata="Q2666382" url="?curid=1061947" title="Llanfair Caereinion">
<text>Llanfair Caereinion ( ) is a market town and community in Montgomeryshire, Powys, Wales upon the River Banwy (also known as the River Einion), around 8 miles west of Welshpool. In 2011 the ward had a population of 1,810; the town itself had a population of 1,055 according to Nomis.
==History==

Its name is a combination of Welsh &#x27; &quot;church&quot; + &#x27; &quot;Mary&quot; and &#x27; &quot;fort&quot; + &#x27;, a personal name, meaning &quot;the church of Mary [at] the fort of Einion&quot;. The town is built upon the site of an old Roman fort. The site of the Battle of Maes Moydog (1295) is nearby. In 1758 the town was almost completely wiped out by a major fire.

==Geography==
The town is close to Welshpool. It acts as a centre for many scattered hamlets and villages in the area. The electorate of the community places it fourteenth in size, out of the county&#x27;s eighteen towns. Llanfair Caereinion is classified as an area centre in the Powys Unitary Development Plan, for the market town has the largest range of community services and facilities and the greatest capacity to accommodate additional development in its locality. There are also rural settlements within the community at Heniarth and Melin-y-ddol. The remainder of the population lives in scattered farms and dwellings.

==Transport==
The town is served by the following bus routes: 73 (Llanfair-Welshpool-Oswestry) which operates only two services each way on Wednesdays and Fridays between 8:58 and 14:57. 84 (Llanfair-Newtown) which operates only two services each way Mondays-Fridays but is more a school service. 87 (Llanfair-Welshpool-Foel) which operates Mondays to Saturdays with six services a day and three each way to Foel, Llanfair and Welshpool. 89 (Llanfair-Welshpool) offer additional service on Mondays only to Welshpool and back to Llanfair.

The nearest mainline railway station is Welshpool and further away is Machynlleth. The town is also the terminus of the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. This offers an additional method of travel to Welshpool from the town between Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays although it is primarily a heritage railway.

==Governance==
Since the May 2022 local elections, Llanfair Caereinion, with neighbouring Llanerfyl, has been part of the Llanfair Caereinion and Llanerfyl electoral ward, represented by one county councillor on Powys County Council.

==Notable residents==
*John Griffiths (1837–1918), an artist who worked in India, noted for his Orientalist works, was born here.
*Thomas John Jehu (1871–1943), geologist and physician, was born here.
*Lu Corfield (born ca.1980), a Welsh actress, raised at nearby Four Crosses 
*Alis Huws (born 1995), a Welsh harpist, born at Foel.

<text>Ivan Petrovich Ivanov-Vano (; – 25 March 1987), born Ivanov, was a Soviet and Russian animation director, animator, screenwriter, educator, professor at Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography (VGIK). One of the pioneers of the Soviet animation school, he is sometimes called the &quot;Patriarch of Soviet animation&quot;. People&#x27;s Artist of the USSR (1985).

==Biography==
Ivan Petrovich Ivanov was born in the Manezhnaya Square district, at the time populated by students and poor people. His parents had a peasant background. His father was a shoemaker who arrived to Moscow from the Kaluga Governorate; soon he left the family. Ivanov&#x27;s mother was illiterate and couldn&#x27;t give her son a proper education, thus he was raised in the family of his elder sister Evdokia Petrovna Spasskaya who was married to an artist and educator at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. As a result, Ivanov became interested in art early in his life and as a kid drew decorations for a puppet theater.

At the age of 14, Ivanov also entered the Moscow School of Painting. After the October Revolution it was reformed and turned into Vkhutemas (Higher Art and Technical Studios). He continued his studies and finally graduated from Vkhutemas in 1923. In a year, Ivanov started working as an animator at the State Film Technicum. Together with his fellow students he created some of the first Soviet animated films using home-made tools. Their works were distinguished by cutout animation and unique art style influenced by constructivism.

In 1927, Ivanov turned to traditional animation with one of the boldest experiments &quot;The Skating Rink&quot; directed by Yuri Zhelyabuzhsky. In later years he took part in a number of other important projects. Around the same time he started using Ivanov-Vano as a pseudonym. According to some of his colleagues, this was done in order to distinguish himself from another prominent Soviet animator Aleksandr Ivanov.

In 1936, Ivanov started working as a director at the newly founded Soyuzmultfilm. His earlier works at the studio were heavily influenced by early Disney, a popular trend during the middle 1930s which he later opposed. In 1939, Ivanov directed &quot;Moydodyr&quot; based on the fairy tale of the same name which became a big step from the Disney stylistics towards more traditional Russian art that predominated during later years.

In 1939, Ivanov organized animation courses at VGIK where he also became one of the leading educators (he was granted the title of professor in 1952). Among his student were Lev Milchin, Yevgeniy Migunov, Aleksandr Petrov, Francheska Yarbusova, Stanislav Sokolov and a Bulgarian animator Todor Dinov. Ivanov was a member of the Communist Party from 1951, and was also a founder and the original Vice President of ASIFA (International Animated Film Association) from 1961 to 1973.

Ivanov-Vano directed a record number of Soviet feature animated films, often working as a screenwriter as well. The majority of his works were based on Russian folklore and fairy tales by classical Russian writers. In 1947, shortly after the end of war, Ivanov presented the first Soviet feature-length animated film &quot;The Humpbacked Horse&quot; based on the fairy tale in verse by Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov. The film gained a lot of praise internationally, and Walt Disney even used it as a teaching tool for his studios.

Since 1962 his artistic style varied a lot. He approached lubok, icon painting, frescoes, Dymkovo toys, lace and Russian avant-garde. Some of his longtime collaborators such as Alexandra Snezhko-Blotskaya and Yuri Norstein who started as his second unit directors and co-directors went on to become popular directors on their own. Ivanov-Vano was a laureate of numerous festivals. His short film &quot;The Battle of Kerzhenets&quot; won Grand Prix award at Animafest Zagreb in 1972.

Ivanov died on March 25, 1987, and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. For 54 years, he was married to Tatiana Ivanova-Bekker (1902–1982). They had a daughter Galina.

<doc id="1061954" wikidata="Q1028304" url="?curid=1061954" title="Cambridge International Education">
<text>Cambridge International Education (abbreviated CIE, informally known as Cambridge International or simply Cambridge and formerly known as CAIE, Cambridge Assessment International Education and CIE, Cambridge International Examinations) is a provider of international qualifications, offering examinations and qualifications to 10,000 schools in more than 160 countries. It is part of Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment, a non-profit and non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge.

==History==

Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment is part of the University of Cambridge. Its assessment organisation was founded in 1858 as the &quot;University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate.&quot; It would later on become known as (University of) Cambridge International Examinations, or simply CIE. As part of a restructuring process of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge Assessment and Cambridge University Press were merged to form Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment and CIE eventually became CAIE: Cambridge Assessment International Education. Thereafter, CAIE was renamed Cambridge International Education and adopted again the abbreviation CIE.

==Qualifications==
Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment offers primarily school-leaving qualifications for university entrance such as the Cambridge International General Certificate of Education (IGCSE) and Advanced Level (Cambridge International GCE A-levels). In addition, Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment provides Key Stage examinations for primary and secondary schools internationally.

==Recognition==

Cambridge qualifications are recognized for admission by all UK universities as well as universities in the United States (Stanford and all Ivy League universities), Canada, the European Union, the Middle East, West Asia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Kazakhstan as well as in other countries.

==Partnerships==
Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment is engaged in partnerships with governments of 25 countries on integrated curriculum and assessment design and professional development for teachers.

==Philanthropy==
As part of its corporate social responsibility initiatives, Cambridge Assessment provides charitable support for children from troubled backgrounds.

==Criticism==
The predecessor organisation of Cambridge International Education was criticized in 2019 for what some claimed were &quot;colonial educational practices&quot; in its literature curricula. A 2019 study said that Cambridge Assessment had privileged European male authors and under-represented female authors from developing countries.

<text>Roman Holliday were a British band active in the 1980s. They are best known in the UK for their hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Stop It&quot;, which reached number 14 on the UK Singles Chart in the summer of 1983. A follow-up, &quot;Motormania&quot;, peaked at number 40.

==Career==
The band was established in November 1980 by Brian Bonhomme, Steve Lambert, Simon Cohen and Peter Noone (the latter of whom left shortly after the band&#x27;s formation). Later on, Rob Lambert and Jon Durno joined, followed by Soho Square busker, John Eacott. At the end of 1982, Adrian York joined the band as a piano player. Tony Wallman was in the band briefly (before the band became successful). After John Peel saw the band at the Jive Dive swing club in London, they recorded two sessions for his show. Mick Jones, then of the Clash, also saw them and invited them to support his band, which led to a signing to Jive Records. &quot;Don&#x27;t Try to Stop It&quot; was their second single for Jive and became a hit in summer 1983. The follow-up, &quot;Motormania&quot; failed to achieve the same success and the parent album &quot;Cookin&#x27; on the Roof&quot;, released in late 1983, achieved only modest success.
Despite this, Roman Holliday toured England and America, opening for Missing Persons, Culture Club, and Stray Cats. In 1984, both brass men, Rob Lambert and John Eacott left the band.

In the United States, the group achieved exposure through MTV, which aired their &quot;Stand By&quot; video. The single went to number one on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart in November 1983. Roman Holliday also charted in Japan on the international, as well as the domestic market, with &quot;Hear It in the Night&quot; and the Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange written and produced track, &quot;One Foot Back in Your Door&quot;. Both singles went top 10.

Bonhomme is currently employed at Youngstown State University. He is a professor of Russian history, and teaches a number of courses in modern European history and environmental history.

<text>&quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling&quot; is a lighthearted song in tribute to Ireland. Its lyrics were written by Chauncey Olcott and George Graff, Jr., set to music composed by Ernest Ball, for Olcott&#x27;s production of &quot;The Isle O&#x27; Dreams&quot;, and Olcott sang the song in the show. It was first published in 1912, at a time when songs in tribute to a romanticised Ireland were very numerous and popular both in Britain and the United States. During the First World War the famous tenor John McCormack recorded the song.

The song continued to be a familiar standard for generations. Decades later it was used as the opening song on the American radio show &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;. The song has been recorded on over 200 singles and albums and by many famous singers, including Bing Crosby, Connie Francis, and Roger Whittaker.

==Lyrics==

Verse 1:
:There&#x27;s a tear in your eye and I&#x27;m wondering why,
:For it never should be there at all;
:With such pow&#x27;r in your smile, sure a stone you&#x27;d beguile,
:So there&#x27;s never a tear-drop should fall;
:When your sweet lilting laughter&#x27;s like some fairy song,
:And your eyes twinkle bright as can be;
:You should laugh all the while and all other times, smile,
:And now smile a smile for me.

Chorus:
:When Irish eyes are smiling, 
:Sure it&#x27;s like a morn in Spring,
:In the lilt of Irish laughter
:You can hear the angels sing.
:When Irish hearts are happy,
:All the world seems bright and gay,
:And when Irish eyes are smiling,
:Sure, they steal your heart away.

Verse 2:
:For your smile is a part of the love in your heart,
:And it makes even sunshine more bright;
:Like the linnet&#x27;s sweet song, crooning all the day long,
:Comes your laughter so tender and light;
:For the spring-time of life is the sweetest of all,
:There is ne&#x27;er a real care or regret;
:And while spring-time is ours throughout all of youth&#x27;s hours,
:Let us smile each chance we get.

(Chorus)

==The song in the news==

The song gained notoriety in Canada after the so-called Shamrock Summit between Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and U.S. President Ronald Reagan held on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, 1985. At the end of the evening, the two leaders and their wives jointly sang &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,&quot; intended to celebrate both leaders&#x27; Irish heritage. Mulroney was extensively criticized in the Canadian press for a &quot;cloying performance&quot; said to symbolize his government&#x27;s excessive closeness to Reagan&#x27;s.

<text>The optic disc or optic nerve head is the point of exit for ganglion cell axons leaving the eye. Because there are no rods or cones overlying the optic disc, it corresponds to a small blind spot in each eye.

The ganglion cell axons form the optic nerve after they leave the eye. The optic disc represents the beginning of the optic nerve and is the point where the axons of retinal ganglion cells come together. The optic disc in a normal human eye carries 1–1.2 million afferent nerve fibers from the eye toward the brain. The optic disc is also the entry point for the major arteries that supply the retina with blood, and the exit point for the veins from the retina.

==Structure==
The optic disc is located 3 to 4 mm to the nasal side of the fovea. It is a vertical oval, with average dimensions of 1.76mm horizontally by 1.92mm vertically. There is a central depression, of variable size, called the optic cup. This depression can be a variety of shapes from a shallow indentation to a bean pot—this shape can be significant for diagnosis of some retinal diseases.

== Function ==
The optic disc or optic nerve head is the point of exit for ganglion cell axons leaving the eye. Because there are no rods or cones overlying the optic disc, it corresponds to a small blind spot in each eye.

==Clinical significance==
Almost all eye structures can be examined with appropriate optical equipment and lenses. Using a modern direct ophthalmoscope gives a view of the optic disc using the principle of reversibility of light. A slit lamp biomicroscopic examination along with an appropriate aspheric focusing lens (+66D, +78D or +90D) is required for a detailed stereoscopic view of the optic disc and structures inside the eye.

A biomicroscopic exam can indicate the health of the optic nerve. In particular, the eye care physician notes the colour, cupping size (as a cup-to-disc ratio), sharpness of edge, swelling, hemorrhages, notching in the optic disc and any other unusual anomalies. It is useful for finding evidence corroborating the diagnosis of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies, optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or papilledema (i.e. optic disc swelling produced by raised intracranial pressure), and optic disc drusen.

Women in an advanced stage of pregnancy with pre-eclampsia should be screened by an ophthalmoscopic examination of the optic disc for early evidence of a rise in intracranial pressure.

===Pale disc===

A normal optic disc is orange to pink in colour and may vary based on ethnicity. A pale disc is an optic disc which varies in colour from a pale pink or orange colour to white. A pale disc is an indication of a disease condition.

===Imaging===

Traditional colour-film camera images are the reference standard in imaging, requiring an expert ophthalmic photographer, ophthalmic technician, optometrist or ophthalmologist for taking standardised pictures of the optic disc. Stereoscopic images offer an excellent investigative tool for serial follow-up of suspected changes in the hands of an expert optometrist or ophthalmologist.

Automated techniques have also been developed to allow for more efficient and less expensive imaging. Heidelberg retinal tomography (HRT), scanning laser polarimetry and optical coherence tomography are computerised techniques for imaging various structures of the eyes, including the optic disc. They quantify the nerve fiber layer of the disc and surrounding retina and statistically correlate the findings with a database of previously screened population of normals. They are useful for baseline and serial follow-up to monitor minute changes in optic disc morphology. Imaging will not provide conclusive evidence for clinical diagnosis however, and the evidence needs to be supplanted by serial physiological testing for functional changes. Such tests may include visual field charting and final clinical interpretation of the complete eye examination by an eye care physician. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are able to provide this service.

Blood flow in the retina and choroid in the optic disc region can be revealed non invasively by near-infrared laser Doppler imaging. Laser Doppler imaging can enable mapping of the local arterial resistivity index, and the possibility to perform unambiguous identification of retinal arteries and veins on the basis of their systole-diastole variations, and reveal ocular hemodynamics in human eyes. Furthermore, the Doppler spectrum asymmetry reveals the local direction of blood flow with respect to the optical axis. This directional information is overlaid on standard grayscale blood flow images to depict flow in the central artery and vein.

A systematic review of 106 studies and 16,260 eyes compared the performance of the imaging techniques, and found that all three imaging tests performed very similarly when detecting for glaucoma. The review found that in 1,000 patients subjected to imaging tests, with 200 having manifest glaucoma, the best imaging tests would miss 60 cases out of the 200 patients with glaucoma, and incorrectly refer 50 out of 800 patients without glaucoma.

==Abnormalities==
*Megalopapilla: a non-progressive condition in which the optic disc is enlarged (diameter exceeding 2.1 mm) with no other morphological abnormalities.
*Morning glory disc anomaly: a unilateral congenital deformity resulting from failure of the optic nerve to completely form in utero. The term was coined in 1970 by Kindler, noting a resemblance of the malformed optic nerve to the morning glory flower.
*Optic pit: congenital excavation of the optic disc resulting from a malformation during development of the eye.

<text>The Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, officially the S. A. Gerasimov All-Russian University of Cinematography (, meaning
&quot;All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography named after S. A. Gerasimov&quot;), a.k.a. VGIK, is a film school in Moscow, Russia.

==History==
The institute was founded in 1919 by the film director Vladimir Gardin as the Moscow Film School and is the first and oldest film school in the world. From 1934 to 1991 the film school was known as the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography ().

Film directors taught at the institute include Lev Kuleshov, Marlen Khutsiev, Aleksey Batalov, Sergei Eisenstein, Mikhail Romm and Vsevolod Pudovkin.

Since 1986, the school has been named after the film director and actor Sergei Gerasimov.

The founding of the institute was authorized by Lenin in 1919. Its work in the early years was hampered by a shortage of film stock. It has a history as one of the oldest film schools in existence; many film directors have taught at the institute. During the period of the Soviet Union it was a requirement of the state to attend VGIK in order to be allowed to direct a film. More recently, its alumni were drawn both from the USSR (Soviet Union) and from other socialist and other countries, though it was a requirement for students to first learn Russian prior to attending. It is among the few film schools which offer scriptwriting courses.

<doc id="1061973" wikidata="Q6607758" url="?curid=1061973" title="List of birds of Oklahoma">
<text>This list of birds of Oklahoma includes species documented in the U.S. state of Oklahoma and accepted by the Oklahoma Ornithological Society&#x27;s Bird Records Committee (OBRC). As of May 2022, there were 488 species on the official list. Of them, 114 are classified as accidental, seven have been introduced to North America, two are known to be extinct, and two others might be extinct. An additional 16 species are classed as either hypothetical or of uncertain origin. Two additional accidental species have been added from other sources.

This list is presented in the taxonomic sequence of the &quot;Check-list of North and Middle American Birds&quot;, 7th edition through the 62nd Supplement, published by the American Ornithological Society (AOS). Common and scientific names are also those of the &quot;Check-list&quot;, except that the common names of families are from the Clements taxonomy because the AOS list does not include them.

Unless otherwise noted, all species listed below are considered to occur regularly in Oklahoma as permanent residents, summer or winter visitors, or migrants. These tags are used to annotate some species:

*(A) Accidental - Species considered rare or accidental by &quot;Bird Checklists of the World&quot; (the OBRC does not annotate its list with this category)
*(I) Introduced - a species introduced to North America by the actions of humans, either directly or indirectly
*(E) Extinct - a species that no longer exists
*(H) Hypothetical - &quot;species seen in the state and supported only by written documentation&quot; per the OBRC
*(UO) Uncertain origin - species whose provenance is unknown

<text>The Great Terror: Stalin&#x27;s Purge of the Thirties is a book by British historian Robert Conquest which was published in 1968. It gave rise to an alternate title of the period in Soviet history known as the Great Purge. Conquest&#x27;s title was also an evocative allusion to the period that was called the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution (French: &quot;la Terreur&quot; and from June to July 1794 &quot;la Grande Terreur&quot;, &quot;the Great Terror&quot;). A revised version of the book, called &quot;The Great Terror: A Reassessment&quot;, was printed in 1990 after Conquest was able to amend the text, having consulted the opened Soviet archives. The book was funded and widely disseminated by Information Research Department, who also published Orwell&#x27;s list collected by Conquest&#x27;s secretary Celia Kirwan.

One of the first books by a Western writer to discuss the Great Purge in the Soviet Union, it was based mainly on information which had been made public, either officially or by individuals, during the Khrushchev Thaw in the period 1956–1964, and on an analysis of official documents such as the Soviet census. It also drew on accounts by Russian and Ukrainian émigrés and exiles dating back to the 1930s. The book was well received in the popular press but its estimates started a debate among historians. Conquest defended his higher estimates of 20 million, which are supported by some historians and other authors in the popular press, while other historians said that even his reassessments were still too high and are considerably less than originally thought.

== Synopsis ==
The first critical inquiry into the Great Purge outside the Soviet Union had been made as early as 1937 by the Dewey Commission, which published its findings in the form of a 422-page book entitled &quot;Not Guilty&quot; (this title referred to the people who had been charged with various crimes by Joseph Stalin&#x27;s government and therefore purged); the Dewey Commission found them not guilty. The most important aim of Conquest&#x27;s &quot;The Great Terror&quot; was to widen the understanding of the purges beyond the previous narrow focus on the Moscow Trials of disgraced All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) leaders, such as Nikolai Bukharin and Grigory Zinoviev. The question of why these leaders had pleaded guilty and confessed to various crimes at the trials had become a topic of discussion for a number of Western writers and had underlain books, such as George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and Arthur Koestler&#x27;s &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot;. According to the book, the trials and executions of these former Communist leaders were a minor detail of the purges, which together with man-made famines had led to 20 million deaths according to his estimates. In the appendix of the original 1968 edition, Conquest estimated that 700,000 legal executions took place during 1937 and 1938, which was roughly confirmed by the 681,692 executions found in the Soviet archives for these two years. In the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;The Great Terror&quot;, Conquest wrote that he had been &quot;correct on the vital matter—the numbers put to death: about one million&quot; but lowered other figures, saying that the total number of deaths brought about by the various Soviet terror campaigns &quot;can hardly be lower than some 13 to 15 million.&quot;

In the book, Conquest disputed the assertion made by Nikita Khrushchev and supported by many Western leftists, namely that Stalin and his purges were an aberration from the ideals of the October Revolution and were contrary to the principles of Leninism. Conquest posited that Stalinism was a natural consequence of the system established by Vladimir Lenin, although he conceded that the personal character traits of Stalin had brought about the particular horrors of the late 1930s. Neal Ascherson wrote: &quot;Everyone by then could agree that Stalin was a very wicked man and a very evil one, but we still wanted to believe in Lenin; and Conquest said that Lenin was just as bad and that Stalin was simply carrying out Lenin&#x27;s programme.&quot; Conquest sharply criticized Western intellectuals for what he described as their blindness towards the realities of the Soviet Union, both in the 1930s and in some cases even in the 1960s. He described figures, such as Beatrice Webb and Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw, Jean-Paul Sartre, Walter Duranty, Bernard Pares, Harold Laski, Denis Pritt, Theodore Dreiser, and Romain Rolland, as dupes of Stalin and apologists for his regime for denying, excusing, or justifying various aspects of the purges. A widespread story recounts that when he was asked to provide a new title for an anniversary edition, after his initial findings were verified by the opened Soviet archives, Conquest allegedly replied: &quot;How about &quot;I Told You So, You Fucking Fools&quot;?&quot; According to Conquest, this never happened and was a joking invention of writer Kingsley Amis.

== Reception, impact, and debates ==
&quot;The Great Terror&quot; was the first comprehensive research of the Great Purge, which took place in the Soviet Union between 1934 and 1939 according to Conquest. Many aspects of his book remain disputed by Sovietologist historians and researchers on Russian and Soviet history. Many reviewers at the time were not impressed by his way of writing about the &quot;Great Terror&quot;, which was in the tradition of great men history. In 1995, investigative journalist Paul Lashmar suggested that the reputation of prominent academics such as Conquest was built upon work derived from material provided by the Information Research Department. In 1996, historian Eric Hobsbawm praised &quot;The Great Terror&quot; as &quot;a remarkable pioneer effort to assess the Stalin Terror&quot; but said that this work and others were now obsolete &quot;simply because the archival sources are now available.&quot; According to Denis Healey, &quot;The Great Terror&quot; was an important influence, &quot;but one which confirmed people in their views rather than converted them.&quot;

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the opening up of the Soviet archives, Conquest&#x27;s estimates of death tolls and other aspects of his research were challenged by several historians, including J. Arch Getty, Gábor T. Rittersporn, Hobsbawm, and Vadim Rogovin. Michael Ellman and Getty in particular criticised Conquest for relying on hearsay and rumour as evidence, and cautioned that historians should instead utilize archive material. Ellman distinguished between historians who base their research on archive materials, and those like Conquest whose estimates are based on witnesses evidence and other data that is unreliable. Historian Stephen G. Wheatcroft said that Conquest&#x27;s victim totals for Stalinist repressions are too high, even in his reassessments. Wheatcroft stated that historians relied on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn to support their estimates of deaths under Stalin in the tens of millions but research in the state archives vindicated the lower estimates, while adding that the popular press has continued to include serious errors that should not be cited, or relied on, in academia. Historian Timothy D. Snyder wrote that it is still taken for granted that Stalin killed more people than Adolf Hitler but the estimates of 6–9 million for the Stalin regime are considerably less than originally thought, while those for Nazi Germany are higher and in line with previous estimates.

Other historians, such as Stéphane Courtois and Steven Rosefielde, agree with Conquest and maintain their original, higher estimates, while Robert Gellately put more recent estimates at 10–20 million. Among other authors published by the popular press who agree with Conquest&#x27;s estimates are Stalin biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, perestroika architect and former head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, and the director of Yale University&#x27;s Annals of Communism series Jonathan Brent. Historian Dmitri Volkogonov, who was special adviser for defence issues to the Russian President Boris Yeltsin until 1994, is also broadly in agreement with Conquest. In 1997, Conquest stated: &quot;We are all inclined to accept the Zemskov totals (even if not as complete) with their 14 million intake to Gulag &#x27;camps&#x27; alone, to which must be added 4–5 million going to Gulag &#x27;colonies&#x27;, to say nothing of the 3.5 million already in, or sent to, &#x27;labour settlements&#x27;. However taken, these are surely &#x27;high&#x27; figures.&quot; In the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;The Great Terror&quot; (2007), Conquest wrote: &quot;Exact numbers may never be known with complete certainty, but the total of deaths caused by the whole range of Soviet regime&#x27;s terrors can hardly be &quot;lower&quot; than some fifteen million.&quot;

<text>The GE Honda HF120 is a small turbofan for the light business jet market, the first engine to be produced by GE Honda Aero Engines.

==Development==
Succeeding Honda&#x27;s original HF118 prototype, the HF120 was undergoing testing in July 2008, with certification targeted for late 2009. The first engines were produced at GE&#x27;s factory, but in November 2014 production shifted to Burlington, North Carolina. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded Part 33 certification to the HF120 turbofan engine in December 2013, and production certification in 2015.

==Design==

The engine has a wide-chord swept fan, two-stage low-pressure compressor and counter rotating high-pressure compressor based on a titanium impeller, for a takeoff thrust. The HF120 engine&#x27;s components interact with greater efficiency by incorporating 3D aerodynamic design, and its effusion-cooled combustor design emits low NOx, CO and HC. Noise levels are quieter than Stage 4 requirements.

In May 2016 time between overhaul was 2,500 h, which was expected to mature to 5,000 h; a midlife hot-section inspection is not required, and it is expected to remain on wing 40% longer than other engines and have lower operating costs.

==Operational history==

Besides the HondaJet, HF120 was announced as a retrofit to the Cessna CitationJet CJ1 by Sierra Industries, in partnership with GE Honda.

In addition, Spectrum Aeronautical has announced it is planning to use HF120 for its upcoming S-40 Freedom.

<doc id="1061984" wikidata="Q1187077" url="?curid=1061984" title="The Corbomite Maneuver">
<text>&quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; is the tenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Jerry Sohl and directed by Joseph Sargent, it first aired on November 10, 1966. In the episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounters a massive and powerful alien starship and its unusual commander. The episode has been well-received and frequently appears on lists of the best episodes in the series.

== Casting ==
The episode features a then 7-year-old Clint Howard – brother of actor and director Ron Howard – who plays the alien at the end (with an overdubbed voice provided by Walker Edmiston).

This was the first regular episode produced after the two pilots and the first to include DeForest Kelley as Dr. Leonard McCoy, Nichelle Nichols as Lt. Uhura (in a yellow uniform rather than red) and Grace Lee Whitney as Yeoman Rand. Because episodes were not aired in production order (a trait throughout the entire run of the original series), audiences had already been introduced to these three nine weeks earlier, in the series&#x27; debut episode, &quot;The Man Trap&quot;.

== Plot ==
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, commanded by Captain James T. Kirk, finishes a third day of star mapping when novice navigator Lt. Dave Bailey spots a large multi-colored cube spinning in space. He advocates attacking it with phasers. Kirk instead orders the ship to back away. The cube pursues them, emitting harmful radiation, and Kirk reluctantly destroys it.

A gigantic sphere approaches the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Commander Balok identifies the sphere as the &quot;Fesarius&quot;, the flagship of the &quot;First Federation&quot;. The destroyed cube was a border marker. Balok announces that he will destroy the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for trespassing into First Federation territory and destroying the marker. He gives the crew ten minutes to pray to their deities. First Officer Spock obtains a visual of Balok, a blue-skinned humanoid with constantly shifting facial features. Bailey succumbs to hysteria, and Kirk relieves him. Dr. McCoy argues that Bailey&#x27;s outburst was a result of Kirk putting too much pressure on him, and noting that he warned Kirk of Bailey&#x27;s condition. The argument inspires Kirk to try bluffing Balok. He tells Balok that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; contains &quot;corbomite&quot;, a substance that destroys any attacker, and claims little regard for the fact that the &quot;Enterprise&quot; would also be destroyed. Bailey contritely asks to resume his duties, which Kirk grants. Balok demands proof of corbomite&#x27;s existence. When Kirk refuses, a small tug ship detaches from the &quot;Fesarius&quot; and tows the &quot;Enterprise&quot; deep into First Federation space. Balok states the crew will be interned on an Earth-like planet and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; destroyed. Intuiting that the tug ship&#x27;s tractor beam cannot be as powerful as that of the &quot;Fesarius&quot;, Kirk orders the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to engage the engines at right angles to their course. Just as its engines are about to overload, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; breaks free. This apparently disables the alien vessel; the crew picks up a distress call which its mother ship does not answer.

Kirk, McCoy, and Bailey form a boarding party to render assistance. They beam over, discovering that the &quot;Balok&quot; on their monitor was an effigy. The real Balok, looking like a hyperintelligent human child, welcomes them aboard. He was testing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and its crew to discover their intentions. Balok expresses a desire to learn more about human culture, and suggests allowing a member of their crew to remain on his ship as an emissary of the Federation. Bailey volunteers, and Balok gives him a tour of his ship.

==Production==
The episode was the first episode of the regular series to be produced, after the two pilots, &quot;The Cage&quot; and &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;, which had been made in 1964 and 1965. It was shot at a different stage, in Hollywood. Sets were transferred from Desilu&#x27;s Culver City location, where later in the series a new engine room set would be constructed for a following episode (&quot;The Enemy Within&quot; production 005). Shooting started on May 24, 1966. The episode was held back until November due to the amount of special effects scenes that were not completed, becoming the 10th episode to be broadcast. NBC preferred planet-based stories which were ready to air before &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; because the miniature footage was not completed or ready when the series premiered.

==Reception==
In 2009, Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode an &quot;A&quot; rating, describing it as &quot;&quot;TOS&quot; [The Original Series] at its best—gripping, well-paced, and thematically coherent&quot;, and noting the ending&#x27;s note of optimism.

In 2010, &quot;SciFiNow&quot; ranked this the sixth-best episode of the original series.

&quot;Io9&quot; rated it the 14th best of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes, in 2014.

In 2015, &quot;WIRED&quot; magazine did not recommend skipping this episode in their binge-watching guide for the original series.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; the 45th best television episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, including live-action and the animated series but not counting the movies. In 2016, they ranked this episode as the 16th greatest episode of the original series.

In 2017, &quot;Business Insider&quot; ranked &quot;The Corbomite Maneuver&quot; the 8th best episode of the original series.

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised this episode as one of the &quot;most thoughtful episodes of the entire franchise&quot; and noting how it set the trend for bizarre first contact situations.

In 2018, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked this the 9th best episode of the original series.

Howard was very impressed with the acting opportunities in the franchise, having appeared multiple times in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; series: &quot;Oh, sure. I&#x27;m an actor and I love gainful employment. Virtually every job offer gets a legitimate consideration from me, but the fact that it&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; is a yes at the drop of a hat. How many people have been on shows 50 years ago and are still being asked to be in incarnations of the same franchise?&quot; When auditioning for George Lucas the filmmaker immediately cited Howard&#x27;s role as Balok years earlier, amazing the actor.

In 2018, &quot;Collider&quot; ranked this the 19th best episode of the original television series.

In 2019, &quot;Nerdist&quot; included this episode on their &quot;Best of Kirk&quot; binge-watching guide.

In 2021, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked this the number three episode of the original series, remarking, &quot;Like a good bottle of tranya, this episode only improves with time&quot;.

==Parody==
* At the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, Jon Stewart used the imaginary threat of &quot;corbomite&quot; in bottled water to illustrate how media figures (personified by Stephen Colbert) create and magnify fears in the public.

<doc id="1061985" wikidata="Q1352932" url="?curid=1061985" title="Classification Office (New Zealand)">
<text>The Office of Film and Literature Classification (), branded as the Classification Office (), is an independent Crown entity established under Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 responsible for censorship and classification of publications in New Zealand. A &quot;publication&quot; is defined broadly to be anything that shows an image, representation, sign, statement, or word. This includes films, video games, books, magazines, CDs, T-shirts, street signs, jigsaw puzzles, drink cans, and slogans on campervans. The Chief Censor, Caroline Flora, is the chair of the Office.

Films must be given a classification before they can be exhibited or supplied to the public. This is done either by the Film and Video Labelling Body or the Office.

Any person may submit any publication for classification by the Office, with the permission of the Chief Censor. However, the Secretary for Internal Affairs, the Comptroller of Customs, the Commissioner of Police, and the Film and Video Labelling Body may submit publications for classification without the Chief Censor&#x27;s permission. The courts have no jurisdiction to classify publications. If the classification of a publication becomes an issue in any civil or criminal proceeding, the court must submit the publication to the Office.

Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Office may have the relevant publication, but not the Office&#x27;s decision, reviewed by the Film and Literature Board of Review.

The Office also has a role in providing information to the public about classification decisions and about the classification system as a whole. It conducts research and produces evidence-based resources to promote media literacy and help people to make informed choices about the content they consume.

==Classification law==
The Office classifies material based on whether it is likely to be &quot;harmful&quot; or &quot;injurious to the public good.&quot; Specifically: &quot;a publication is objectionable if it describes, depicts, expresses, or otherwise deals with matters such as sex, horror, crime, cruelty, or violence in such a manner that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.&quot; The Censorship Compliance Unit of the Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for the enforcement of the FVPC Act.

In 2000 the Court of Appeal of New Zealand decided in &quot;Living Word Distributors Limited v Human Rights Action Group (Wellington)&quot; [2000] NZCA 179 (a case involving two videos produced by Jeremiah Films) that the juxtaposition of the words &quot;sex, horror, crime, cruelty or violence&quot; tends to point to activity rather than to the expression of opinion or attitude. On this interpretation, the Office had jurisdiction to restrict or ban publications describing or depicting sexual activities, but not those describing only an attitude or opinion about sex. The same interpretation required publications to describe or depict horror activities, criminal activities, cruel activities, and violent activities, rather than just an opinion or attitude about those things, for the Office to be able to classify them.

The Court of Appeal explicitly ruled that the phrase &quot;matters such as sex&quot; is strongly indicative of sexual activities and does not include sexual orientation. This made it more difficult for the Office to restrict or ban publications that simply exploited the nudity of children or portrayed classes of people as inherently inferior, but did not show any of the specified types of activity, notwithstanding the fact the FVPC Act directs the censors to give &quot;particular weight&quot; to these things when deciding whether or not to restrict or ban a publication. It also made it difficult for the Office to restrict publications simply containing offensive language or to ban videos of persons taken without their knowledge or consent, such as &quot;upskirt&quot; videos, on the ground of invasion of privacy, again because neither type of publication shows any of the specified types of activity. In 2005, Parliament amended the FVPC Act, and commenced amendment of the Crimes Act, to restore the Office&#x27;s jurisdiction over all of these matters except for publications that simply portray classes of people as inherently inferior.

Under the FVPC Act material that promotes, supports, or tends to promote or support the following is deemed objectionable (banned):
* Sexual exploitation of children
* Coercion
* Extreme violence, torture, and/or cruelty
* Bestiality
* Necrophilia
* Urophilia
* Coprophilia

In 2019, the Labour Government announced a regulatory change to bring commercial video on demand content from services like Netflix and Lightbox under the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993. This change, which came into force on 1 February 2022, requires major streaming services operating in New Zealand to rate content using an approved self-rating system. The Office approves these systems but they are developed and run by streaming services themselves.

Also on 1 February 2022, the Act was amended to give the Chief Censor the ability to issue urgent interim classification assessments for publications which are &quot;likely to be objectionable&quot;, effectively banning them temporarily. This power was used by Acting Chief Censor Rupert Ablett-Hampson to urgently assess a manifesto attributed to the perpetrator of the 2022 Buffalo, New York mass shooting, and a livestream of the attack. Both publications were later permanently banned.

== Chief Censor ==

The chairperson of the Classification Office is the Chief Censor, a position that is selected by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Internal Affairs with the agreement of the Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs and the Minister of Justice.

The Chief Censor has the power to &quot;call in&quot; publications that have not come to the Office for classification, requiring the publisher to submit the publication for classification.

=== List of Chief Censors ===
* William Jolliffe 1916–1927
* W. A. Tanner 1927–1937
* W. A. von Keisenberg 1938–1949
* Gordon Mirams 1949–1959
* Douglas McIntosh 1960–1976
* Bernard Tunnicliffe 1977–1983
* Arthur Everard 1984–1990
* Jane Wrightson 1991–1993
* Kathryn Paterson 1994–1998
* Bill Hastings 1999–2010
* Andrew Jack 2011–2017
* David Shanks 2017–2022
* Caroline Flora 2022–present

==Case studies==
===&quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;===
Chief Censor Andrew Jack used his call-in power to classify the Netflix series &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot; in 2017 and his successor David Shanks called in the second series in 2018. The Chief Censors were concerned that New Zealand audiences needed to be warned about rape and suicide in the series. New Zealand has the highest youth suicide rate in the OECD.

The series was given a specially created RP18 classification which means that someone under 18 must be supervised by a parent or guardian when viewing the series, which Netflix was required to display.

===&quot;A Star Is Born&quot;===
&quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (2018) was not classified by the Classification Office when it released in New Zealand. It had been rated an M in Australia so was automatically cross-rated M (Unrestricted, suitable for 16 years and over) in New Zealand by the Film &amp; Video Labelling Body. At that stage, it carried a descriptive note &quot;&#x27;Sex scenes, offensive language and drug use&quot;.&#x27; The Chief Censor required that the warning note be updated to include &#x27;suicide&#x27; after receiving complaints from members of the public, including health care providers. The film contains a scene depicting a suicide by hanging; this is the most common method of suicide in New Zealand.

The Film &amp; Video Labelling Body issued a new certificate to be displayed and alerted exhibitors to the note change so that they could update their information. Where possible, the distributor must update the label on all advertising.

===The March 15 attack publications===
Chief Censor David Shanks called in the livestream video of the Christchurch mosque shootings on 15 March 2019. The Office classified the full 17 minute footage as objectionable on 18 March 2019 due to its depiction and promotion of extreme violence and terrorism.

A 74-page publication (referred to as The Great Replacement) reportedly written by the perpetrator of the Christchurch mosque shootings was also called in by Chief Censor David Shanks. It was officially classified as objectionable in New Zealand on 23 March 2019.

The publication was found to provide justification for the Christchurch mosque shootings and to promote further acts of murder, terrorist violence, and extreme cruelty against identified groups of people. The objectionable classification was not due to the racist and extremist views expressed in the publication but due to the high likelihood of serious and fatal harm resulting from the continued availability of the publication.

Both decisions were reviewed by the Film and Literature Board of Review which also found the publications to be objectionable for the same reasoning as the Office. Publications found to be objectionable are illegal to possess or distribute in New Zealand without the express authority of the Office. The decisions of the Office and the Board of Review are only applicable to New Zealand and the publications continue to be legally available in other parts of the world.

==Research==
The Classification Office undertakes research about entertainment media content, media impacts, classification and censorship. Recent projects have investigated young New Zealanders experiences and views about sexual violence in entertainment media, and online pornography.

==Community engagement==
The Classification Office also regularly convenes panels that are demographically representative of New Zealand as a whole to assist it with the classification of particular publications. It has convened public panels to assist it with the classification of films such as &quot;Baise-moi&quot;, &quot;Salo&quot;, &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot;, &quot;Irréversible&quot;, &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, &quot;Du er ikke alene&quot;, &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;8MM&quot; and &quot;Hannibal&quot;.

More frequently, the Office consults experts to assist it with the classification of various publications. For example, religious experts were consulted to assist with the classification of &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, experts in road safety were consulted on &quot;Mischief Destroy&quot;, the Children&#x27;s Commissioner on &quot;Ken Park&quot; and &quot;The Aristocrats&quot;, homeopathic practitioners on drug manufacturing books written by Steve Preisler, and rape crisis centres and psychologists on &quot;Irréversible&quot; and an edition of the University of Otago student magazine &quot;Critic&quot;.

Each year the Office consults media studies students in its high school programme called &quot;Censor for a Day&quot;, during which an unreleased film is shown to high school students, who are then asked to classify it applying the criteria in the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993. The students&#x27; classification is compared with, and usually identical to, the film&#x27;s actual classification. Films used for &quot;Censor for a Day&quot; have included &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;, &quot;Get Out&quot;, &quot;Blockers&quot;, and &quot;Super Dark Times.&quot;

The Office works with a Youth Advisory panel of diverse young people aged 16–19 who provide a youth voice on media in New Zealand. Meetings are held once a month and are around two hours long. During the meetings, panel members express their views and perspectives on issues to do with potential media harms that impact on young people in New Zealand and the way the Classification Office responds to those issues. After a robust discussion, the panel members brainstorm what potential tangible outcomes could look like.

The panel regularly participate in classification assessments of upcoming feature films. Recently they helped with the classification of Boy Erased, Good Boys, and Booksmart. Their discussion is summarised in the classification decisions for those films.

== Labels ==

The FVPC Act gives the Classification Office the power to classify publications into three categories: unrestricted, restricted, and &quot;objectionable&quot; or banned. Unrestricted films are assigned a green or yellow rating label. Restricted films are assigned a red classification label.

Since early 2013 some DVDs and Blu-rays released in New Zealand have had the rating label printed on the cover to prevent the removal of the label, which is illegal.

New Zealand has used a colour-coded labelling system since 1987. The colours are intended to resemble the messages conveyed by a traffic light: a green label means that nothing in the film, video or DVD should inhibit anyone from viewing it; a yellow label means proceed with caution because the film, video or DVD may have content that younger viewers should not see; and a red label means stop and ensure that no one outside the restriction views the film, video, DVD or computer game. It is an offence to supply age-restricted material to anyone under the age shown on the label.

The current classification system was introduced in 1993, harmonising the previously different standards for film and video. The following classifications are currently in use:
The RP18 rating is the newest rating, having been created in April 2017 specifically for the drama series &quot;13 Reasons Why&quot;.

The Film and Video Labelling Body may award films, videos and DVDs an unrestricted classification of (G, PG or M) based on their Australian classification, or British classification if no Australian classification exists. The Office is the only body who may award restricted ratings.

<text>Maria Damanaki (; born 31 May 1952) is a Greek politician. She is a former president of the Synaspismos party of the left and former state member of the Hellenic Parliament within the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). She served as the Global Managing Director for Oceans at The Nature Conservancy. In this capacity leads a global team focused on how the world manages its oceans, including sustainable fisheries management, large-scale protection and restoration of coral reefs and other ecosystems, coastal resilience, and mapping and quantification of the full value of the world&#x27;s oceans to people.

==Early life and education==
Damanaki was born in Agios Nikolaos, Crete, in 1952, and studied chemical engineering in the National Technical University of Athens.

==Political career==
As a student, Damanaki became a member of the Communist Youth of Greece, the youth section of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), but also became actively involved in the antidictatorial struggle and took part in the Athens Polytechnic uprising. Damanaki was the voice of the famous &quot;&quot;Εδώ Πολυτεχνείο&quot; (&quot;This is the Polytechnic&quot;)&quot; radio broadcast from within the uprising, calling Greek citizens out to support; she was arrested and tortured by the regime.

===Member of the Greek Parliament, 1977–1993===
From 1977 to 1993 Damanaki was consistently elected member of the Hellenic Parliament, first with the Communist Party and then with Synaspismos, the new party she became president of in 1991. This made her Greece&#x27;s first female party president, preceded by being the first woman elected as Vice President of Parliament in 1986.

Damanaki was a candidate for mayor of Athens twice, in 1994, supported by Synaspismos, and in 1998, supported by both Synaspismos and PASOK; in the latter year she came second, defeated by Dimitris Avramopoulos, supported by the conservative party of New Democracy.

===European Commissioner, 2010–2014===
In November 2009 Damanaki was nominated as the representative of Greece in the European Commission and on 27 November 2009 was elected as the Commissioner-designate for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, serving from 2010 to 2014. She served for four years as European Union Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries.

In her role as Commissioner, the EU was able to bring fish populations back to healthier levels—from five sustainable stocks in 2010 to up to 27 in 2014. In just the next five years, the continuation of her fisheries policy efforts could lead to 15 million more tons of fish in the sea, 30 percent more jobs in Europe and the equivalent of over US$2 billion in additional revenue. She also introduced and implemented the Blue Growth agenda for Seas and Oceans in Europe, which aimed to create 1.6 million new jobs and the equivalent of US$750 billion in revenue by 2020 in sectors such as coastal tourism, ocean energy, and marine biotechnology. In addition, she established legislation to create a common framework for Marine Spatial Planning to map and better manage maritime activities across EU countries.

===Writings===
Damanaki is also the writer of four books &quot;&quot;The female face of power&quot; (Το θηλυκό πρόσωπο της εξουσίας)&quot; in 1995, &quot;&quot;The return of Politics&quot; (Η επιστροφή της Πολιτικής)&quot; in 2001, &quot;The return of politics – the European perspective&quot; in 2004, and &quot;The university in transition&quot; in 2006.

<doc id="1061993" wikidata="Q313396" url="?curid=1061993" title="John Sigismund Zápolya">
<text>John Sigismund Zápolya or Szapolyai (; 7 July 1540 – 14 March 1571) was King of Hungary as John II from 1540 to 1551 and from 1556 to 1570, and the first Prince of Transylvania, from 1570 to his death. He was the only son of John I, King of Hungary, and Isabella of Poland. JohnI ruled parts of the Kingdom of Hungary with the support of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman; the remaining areas were ruled by Ferdinand I of Habsburg, who also ruled Austria and Bohemia. The two kings concluded a peace treaty in 1538 acknowledging Ferdinand&#x27;s right to reunite Hungary after JohnI&#x27;s death, though shortly after John Sigismund&#x27;s birth, and on his deathbed, JohnI bequeathed his realm to his son. The late king&#x27;s staunchest supporters elected the infant John Sigismund king, but he was not crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary.

Suleiman invaded Hungary under the pretext of protecting John Sigismund from Ferdinand. Buda, the capital of Hungary, fell to the Ottomans without opposition in 1541, but Suleiman allowed the dowager queen, Isabella, to retain the territory east of the river Tisza on John Sigismund&#x27;s behalf. Isabella and John Sigismund moved to Lippa (now Lipova in Romania). Before long, they took up residence in Gyulafehérvár in Transylvania (Alba Iulia in Romania). John Sigismund&#x27;s realm was administered by his father&#x27;s treasurer, George Martinuzzi, who sought to reunite Hungary under the rule of Ferdinand. Martinuzzi forced Isabella to renounce her son&#x27;s realm in exchange for two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins in 1551. John Sigismund and his mother settled in Poland, but she continued to negotiate for John Sigismund&#x27;s restoration with Ferdinand&#x27;s enemies.

Ferdinand was unable to protect eastern Hungary against the Ottomans. At Suleiman&#x27;s urging, the Transylvanian Diet in 1556 persuaded John Sigismund and his mother to return to Transylvania, where she ruled her son&#x27;s realm until her death in 1559. A wealthy lord, Melchior Balassa, rebelled against John Sigismund in late 1561, and Ferdinand gained control of most counties outside Transylvania. The Székely people, whose liberties had been restricted in the 1550s, also rose up against John Sigismund, but he crushed the rebellion. During the ensuing war against the Habsburgs, the Ottomans supported John Sigismund, and he paid homage to Suleiman in Zemun in 1566. The 1568 Treaty of Adrianople concluded the war, confirming John Sigismund in the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary (Transylvania and &quot;Partium&quot;).

John Sigismund initiated a series of theological debates among the representatives of the concurring theological schools of the Reformation in the 1560s. He converted from Catholicism to Lutheranism in 1562 and from Lutheranism to Calvinism in 1564. Around five years later, accepting the Anti-Trinitarian views of his physician, Giorgio Biandrata and court preacher Ferenc Dávid, he became the only Unitarian monarch in history. In 1568, the Diet passed the Edict of Torda (now Turda in Romania), which emphasized that &quot;faith is a gift of God&quot; and prohibited the persecution of people for religious reasons. The edict expanded the limits of freedom of religion beyond the standards of late 16th-century Europe. John Sigismund abandoned the title &quot;elected king of Hungary&quot; in the Treaty of Speyer in 1570. Thereafter, he styled himself &quot;Prince of Transylvania and Lord of Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;. He died childless. The Catholic Stephen Báthory succeeded him.

== Family ==

John Sigismund&#x27;s father, John Zápolya, was the wealthiest Hungarian lord in the early . After the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent, inflicted a crushing defeat on the Hungarian army in the Battle of Mohács, the majority of the noblemen elected John Zápolya king in 1526. However, a group of influential lords proclaimed Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria, king in the same year. Hungary fell into a civil war that lasted for decades.

John paid homage to Suleiman at Mohács in 1529 to secure Ottoman support against Ferdinand. However, neither John nor Ferdinand could win control of the whole country during the next years. To conclude the civil war, the two kings&#x27; envoys signed the Treaty of Várad on 24February 1538, which confirmed both kings&#x27; right to retain the lands that they held. John, who was childless, also acknowledged Ferdinand&#x27;s right to take control of his realm (the central and eastern part of the Kingdom of Hungary) after his death. John also stipulated, if he fathered a son, his son would inherit his ancestral domains. Ferdinand, however, proved unable to protect John&#x27;s realm against an Ottoman invasion. At age 52 John married Isabella Jagiellon, the 20-year-old daughter of Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, on 2March 1539. The humanist scholars Paolo Giovio and Antun Vrančić emphasized that Isabella was one of the most educated women of their age.

John Sigismund was born in Buda on 7 July 1540. On learning of his birth, his father, who was on campaign in Transylvania, rode to his soldiers&#x27; camp to inform them of the good news. The following day John fell ill, and he died on 21 or 22 July. Before his death he persuaded those present at his death bed to take an oath that they would prevent the transfer of his realm to Ferdinand.

== Childhood ==

=== Accession ===

Soon after John Zápolya died, his treasurer, George Martinuzzi, hurried to Buda to secure John Sigismund&#x27;s inheritance. On Martinuzzi&#x27;s proposal, the Diet of Hungary elected John Sigismund king on 13September 1540, but he was not crowned with the Holy Crown of Hungary. The Diet proclaimed Queen Isabella and George Martinuzzi, along with two powerful lords, Péter Petrovics and Bálint Török, the guardians of the infant monarch.

In August, Ferdinand&#x27;s envoys had demanded the transfer of the late John Zápolya&#x27;s realm to Ferdinand in accordance with the Treaty of Várad. Peter Perényi, who had been the commander of Zápolya&#x27;s troops in Upper Hungary, and Franjo Frankopan, Archbishop of Kalocsa, soon deserted to Ferdinand. The wealthy Stephen Majláth expelled most of John Sigismund&#x27;s supporters from Transylvania in an attempt to seize the province for himself. Ferdinand&#x27;s envoy, Hieronymus Łaski, informed Suleiman of the Treaty of Várad, asking the sultan to consent to the unification of Hungary under Ferdinand&#x27;s rule. Instead, the sultan stated that he supported John Sigismund and had Łaski arrested.

Ferdinand&#x27;s army seized Visegrád, Vác, Pest, Tata and Székesfehérvár in October, but could not capture Buda. His military commander, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, again laid siege to Buda on 4May 1541. Suleiman left Istanbul at the head of a large army in June to take advantage of the new civil war in Hungary. On his command, Petru Rareș, Prince of Moldavia, captured Stephen Majláth and forced the Transylvanian Diet to swear fealty to John Sigismund in late July. Roggendorf lifted the siege of Buda before Suleiman reached the town on 26August.

Suleiman said that he had come to protect John Sigismund&#x27;s interests, but also announced that he wanted to see the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella&#x27;s having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan&#x27;s camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they wanted to see the town. This turned out to be a trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan&#x27;s camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.

=== First rule ===

Isabella and Martinuzzi left Buda on 5 September 1541, taking John Sigismund and the Holy Crown with them. She and her son settled in Lippa, which was the center of an old domain of the Zápolya family. The delegates of the counties of John Sigismund&#x27;s realm met in Debrecen on 18October. They swore fealty to him and acknowledged the sultan&#x27;s suzerainty. Martinuzzi signed a treaty with FerdinandI&#x27;s representative, Caspar Serédy, in Gyalu (now Gilău in Romania) on 29December. According to the Treaty of Gyalu, Hungary was to be reunited under the rule of Ferdinand, but John Sigismund&#x27;s right to the Zápolyas&#x27; domains in Upper Hungary was confirmed.

On 29 March 1542, the &quot;Three Nations of Transylvania&quot; urged Isabella to move from Lippa (which was located near the Ottoman Empire) to Transylvania. After John Statileo, Bishop of Transylvania, died in April, the Diet granted the domains of the bishopric to the royal family. Isabella and John Sigismund moved to Gyulafehérvár in June, taking up residence in the bishops&#x27; castle.

The Transylvanian Diet confirmed the Treaty of Gyalu in August. The representatives of the noblemen of the Partium (the counties between the Tisza and Transylvania) also consented to a war against the Ottoman Empire in November. However, the Habsburgs&#x27; army was unable to recapture Pest or defeat the Ottomans. Caspar Serédy came to Gyalu to take possession of John Sigismund&#x27;s realm on Ferdinand&#x27;s behalf, but Isabella refused him on 17December. Three days later, the Diet declared the Treaty of Gyalu null and void, over the objections of the delegates of the Transylvanian Saxons.

The relationship between Isabella and Martinuzzi was tense. Martinuzzi continued to control state administration and finance even after the Diet confirmed Isabella&#x27;s superior position in February 1543. The first tribute from John Sigismund&#x27;s realm was sent to the Ottoman Sultan in June. In the same month, Saxon clergymen from Kronstadt (now Brașov in Romania), who had adopted Lutheranism, participated in a debate with Catholic priests in the presence of the queen and Martinuzzi in Gyulafehérvár. The Saxons were allowed to leave, although Martinuzzi, who was bishop of Várad, wanted to bring them before court on charges of heresy. In April 1544, the Diet of Torda prescribed that travellers should respect the religious customs of the settlements they visited, showing that the ideas of the Reformation had spread to the whole province.

The first Transylvanian Diet at which delegates from the Partium were present met in August 1544. At the Diet, Martinuzzi was made chief justice. Five counties that had previously accepted Ferdinand&#x27;s ruleBereg, Szabolcs, Szatmár, Ung and Zemplénswore allegiance to John Sigismund before the end of 1555.

The Ottomans laid claim to two fortresses, Becse and Becskerek (now Novi Bečej and Zrenjanin in Serbia), in early 1546. The sultan refused to include John Sigismund&#x27;s realm in the peace treaty that he concluded with Ferdinand&#x27;s brother, Emperor Charles V, in 1547. Both actions suggested that Suleiman intended to seize part of John Sigismund&#x27;s kingdom, prompting Isabella and Martinuzzi to reopen negotiations with Ferdinand on the reunification of Hungary in 1548. Martinuzzi and Ferdinand&#x27;s envoy, Nicolaus of Salm, signed a treaty in Nyírbátor on 8September 1549. According to their agreement, Isabella and John Sigismund were to abdicate in exchange for the Silesian duchies of Opole and Racibórz and 100,000 florins in compensation. Isabella refused to execute the treaty and remained in Gyulafehérvár. Martinuzzi laid siege to the town, forcing her to give up resistance in October 1550.

Isabella and her supporters Péter Petrovics and Ferenc Patócsy made a new attempt to prevent the execution of the Treaty of Nyírbátor in May 1551, but Martinuzzi defeated them. Under duress, Isabella abdicated in favor of Ferdinand on John Sigismund&#x27;s behalf, in return for the two Silesian duchies and 140,000 florins on 19July. Two days later, she surrendered the Holy Crown to Ferdinand&#x27;s representative, Giovanni Battista Castaldo. The Diet acknowledged their abdication and swore fealty to Ferdinand on 26July.

=== In exile ===

Isabella and John Sigismund left Transylvania on 6August 1551, accompanied by Péter Petrovics. They settled in Kassa (now Košice in Slovakia), and moved to Opole in March 1552. Realizing that the Silesian duchies were poor, they left for Poland before the end of April. During the following years they lived in Kraków, Warsaw, Sanok, and other Polish towns. John Sigismund often went hunting for bison and regularly visited his uncle, Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland. However, his health was delicate because he suffered from epilepsy and chronic intestinal disorders.
The contemporaneous historian Ferenc Forgách, who was Isabella&#x27;s implacable enemy, accused her of bringing her son up &quot;shamefully&quot;, allowing him to keep bad company and drink. John Sigismund&#x27;s tutors were actually humanist scholars: the Hungarian Mihály Csáky and the Polish Wojciech Nowopołski. Nowopołski aroused John Sigismund&#x27;s interest in theological debates.

Ferdinand&#x27;s rule remained fragile in the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary because he did not send enough mercenaries to defend them. Suspecting that Martinuzzi was conspiring with the Ottomans, Castaldo had Martinuzzi murdered in late 1551. The Ottomans occupied the lowlands of Banat in the summer of 1552.

In March 1553 Suleiman urged Isabella to return to Hungary. Péter Petrovics rose against Ferdinand, and an assembly of the Székely people declared their loyalty to John Sigismund. However, both uprisings were crushed before the end of September. Deciding in April 1554 that Hungary should be restored to John Sigismund, Suleiman allowed Péter Petrovics to take control of two fortresses in Banat. Henry II of France, engaged in war against the Habsburgs, also urged Isabella to return to Hungary, promising one of his daughters in marriage to John Sigismund.

Suleiman sent messages to the Transylvanian lords in 1555, demanding they obey John Sigismund without resistance. Before the end of the year, the representatives of the Three Nations petitioned Ferdinand either to send reinforcements or to absolve them from their oath of fealty. Petrovics stormed into Transylvania in early 1556. The Diet swore an oath of fealty to John Sigismund on 12March 1556, referring to him as &quot;the son of King John&quot;. The envoys of the Diet departed for Poland on 1June to persuade Isabella and her son to return. Two weeks later, Ferdinand informed Suleiman that he was ready to withdraw his troops from John Sigismund&#x27;s former realm.

=== Return ===

The representatives of the Three Nations received Isabella and John Sigismund with much pomp and ceremony in Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 22October 1556. The Diet confirmed her right to administer state affairs in the name of her son, who was still a minor. In the following months several counties outside Transylvania (including Abaúj, Bihar, and Gömör) also acknowledged John Sigismund&#x27;s rule.

Isabella adopted a tolerant religious policy, enabling the spread of Calvinism, especially in Partium and Kolozsvár. In 1559 she started new negotiations with Ferdinand, proposing to renounce her son&#x27;s title of king if Ferdinand would agree to marry one of his daughters to John Sigismund and to confirm John Sigismund&#x27;s rule in the lands to the east of the Tisza. However, the dowager queen died at the age of 40 on 18September 1559.

== King-elect ==

=== Start of personal rule ===

John Sigismund&#x27;s rule began with his mother&#x27;s death. Rather than adopting a new title, he continued to style himself &quot;rex electus&quot; (king-elect). Mihály Csáky, Christopher and Stephen Báthory, and his mother&#x27;s other advisors continued to participate in state administration. John Sigismund sent envoys to Ferdinand to propose marriage with one of Ferdinand&#x27;s daughters, but also to announce his claim to the parts of Hungary under Ferdinand&#x27;s rule. His demands were rejected, but peace was preserved.

John Sigismund showed a particular interest in religious matters and initiated several debates among the representatives of diverse theological schools. The first debate was held between Lutheran and Calvinist priests in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) in January 1560. A year and a half later, John Sigismund sent letters to the University of Wittenberg and other theological centers in Germany to seek advice on the main points of the two Protestant schools of thought.

Melchior Balassa, one of the wealthiest lords in John Sigismund&#x27;s realm, deserted to Ferdinand in December 1561. John Sigismund moved to seize Balassa&#x27;s domains, but his army was routed at Hadad (now Hodod in Romania) on 4 March 1562. Stirred up by Balassa, the Székely commoners rose to restore their ancient liberties (including exemption from taxes), which had been restricted in the 1550s. John Sigismund&#x27;s army routed them in May, and their leaders were impaled or mutilated. The Diet adopted new laws to restrict the privileges of the Székelys, including a ban on the employment of commoners as jurors. Two new royal castles named Székelytámad (&quot;Székely-assault&quot;) and Székelybánja (&quot;Székely-regret&quot;) were erected in the Székely Land. After Balassa&#x27;s revolt, most counties outside Transylvania changed allegiance from John Sigismund to Ferdinand. To persuade Ferdinand to renounce the counties, John Sigismund even offered not to style himself king, but this was rejected in July 1562.

John Sigismund, originally Roman Catholic, converted to Lutheranism before the end of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian did not share either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to reconcile the Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564. The Diet acknowledged the existence of a separate Calvinist denomination in June. John Sigismund also adopted Calvinism and made Ferenc Dávid his court preacher.

=== Wars and debates ===

Ferdinand died on 25 July 1564, and his son Maximilian II succeeded him. The Transylvanian Diet declared war to reoccupy the counties that had been lost to the Habsburgs in 1562. John Sigismund&#x27;s army seized Szatmár (now Satu Mare in Romania), Hadad and Nagybánya (now Baia Mare in Romania) before the end of 1562, but a counter-invasion by Lazarus von Schwendi reached the river Szamos in March 1565. The envoys of John Sigismund and Maximilian II concluded a treaty in Szatmár on 13 March 1565 in which John Sigismund renounced his title of king in return for the recognition of his hereditary rule in Transylvania John Sigismund was also to marry Maximilian II&#x27;s sister, Joanna.

However, the Ottomans forced John Sigismund to declare the treaty null and void on 21 April. John Sigismund and Hasan, Pasha of Temesvár, joined forces and recaptured Erdőd (now Ardud in Romania), Nagybánya and Szatmár. He intended to see the sultan in Istanbul to give an explanation for the Treaty of Szatmár, but Suleiman informed him that he would personally come to Hungary.

Ferenc Dávid began to include Anti-Trinitarian ideas in his sermons, which infuriated the Calvinist bishop of Debrecen, Péter Melius Juhász. John Sigismund organized an open debate about the doctrine of Trinity, which was held in Gyulafehérvár in April 1566. After the debate John Sigismund granted funds to the Calvinist publishing house in Debrecen. He also sponsored the establishment of Protestant colleges in Kolozsvár, Marosvásárhely (present-day Târgu Mureș in Romania) and Nagyvárad. His letters to Petrus Ramus and other leading scholars of the Reformation show that he wanted to develop the royal college in Gyulafehérvár into an academy. An anthology of Italian poems, published in Venice in the 1560s, hailed John Sigismund as &quot;patron of the Renaissance&quot;.

Sultan Suleiman came to Zemun on the Danube in preparation for his campaign against Habsburg territories in the summer of 1566. John Sigismund hurried to the sultan&#x27;s camp, accompanied by 400 Transylvanian lords. After John Sigismund and his principal advisors prostrated themselves before the sultan in his tent, Suleiman confirmed John Sigismund&#x27;s position as hereditary ruler. According to the eyewitness Mustafa Selaniki, the sultan addressed John Sigismund as his &quot;beloved son&quot;.

John Sigismund invaded Upper Hungary on the sultan&#x27;s order on 28 July. However, when Suleiman died during the Siege of Szigetvár on 6September, Sokollu Mehmed Pasha ordered John Sigismund to return to Transylvania. In a letter written about this time to Cosimo I, Duke of Florence, the mercenary Giovanandrea Gromo described John Sigismund as &quot;extremely benevolent, gracious, subtle in thought, wise, level-headed, industrious [and] brave&quot;. Gromo mentioned that John Sigismund spoke Latin, Italian, German, Polish, Hungarian and Romanian well, and could also speak Greek and Turkish.

John Sigismund appointed a Calvinist bishop as the only religious leader of the Romanians in his realm in November 1566. The Diet also ordered that all Romanian priests who refused to convert to Calvinism were to be expelled, but this decision was not carried out. Influenced by Dávid and Biandrata, John Sigismund became receptive to Anti-Trinitarian ideas from early 1567. With John Sigismund&#x27;s support, Dávid published five books to promote his views, reproving for idolatry those who accepted the dogma of the Trinity.

John Sigismund and Hasan Pasha stormed into Upper Hungary in March 1567. However, John Sigismund was taken seriously ill in summer. The Transylvanian lords pledged to respect his last will when electing his successor. The Ottoman Sultan Selim II granted the Transylvanian lords the right to freely elect their monarch, only preserving the right to approve their decision. Before long, John Sigismund recovered.

=== Freedom of religion ===
The Diet met again in Torda in early 1568 and authorized preachers to &quot;teach the Gospel&quot; according to their own understanding. The Diet also declared that nobody should &quot;suffer at the hands of others for religious reasons&quot;, stating that &quot;faith is a gift of God&quot;. The Edict of Torda expanded the limits of religious freedom far beyond the standard of 16th-century Europe. The decree did not put a complete end to discrimination, because official status was granted only to the Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist clergymen, but Unitarian, Orthodox, Armenian, Jewish, and Muslim believers could also freely practise their religions.

The Treaty of Adrianople, signed in February 1568, concluded the first war between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs. According to the treaty, John Sigismund retained all territories that he had conquered from Maximilian II in the previous years. The envoy of the Ottoman Sultan Selim II in Paris suggested that John Sigismund should marry Margaret of Valois, but his proposal was ignored.

Many theological discussions on the Trinity were organized in 1568, the first of them taking place in his presence in Gyulafehérvár from 8 to 17 March. The growing influence of the Anti-Trinitarians on John Sigismund became obvious in 1569. After Péter Károlyi, a Calvinist cleric, complained about John Sigismund&#x27;s bias, John Sigismund accused the Calvinist bishop, Melius, of having persecuted non-Calvinist priests, stating that Melius &quot;should not play the pope&quot;. The largest debate between the Calvinist and Anti-Trinitarian, or Unitarian, theologians took place in Nagyvárad from 20 to 25 October 1569. Although neither side was declared winner, after the debate John Sigismund accepted Anti-Trinitarian ideas, which made him the only Unitarian monarch in history.

We wish that in our freedom shall reign. We know furthermore that faith is a gift from God and that conscience cannot be constrained. And if [Peter Melius Juhász] does not abide by this, he may go to the other side of the Tisza.|John Sigismund&#x27;s words to Péter Károlyi

After John Sigismund&#x27;s conversion, most of his courtiers also adhered to Unitarianism. According to historian Gábor Barta, political factors also contributed to John Sigismund&#x27;s conversion, because he &quot;found in [Anti-Trinitarianism] the means through which he could express both his adherence to the Christian world and the distance from it&quot;. István Keul says that the simplicity of the idea that &quot;There is but one God!&quot; also contributed to the spread of Unitarianism, especially among the Székely villagers and the townspeople of Kolozsvár. A religious enthusiast, György Karácsony, stirred up many peasants in Partium to wage holy war against the Ottomans in 1569. They marched against Debrecen, but the neighboring noblemen routed them near the town in early 1570.

== Prince of Transylvania ==

Negotiations between John Sigismund and Maximilian II concluded with the Treaty of Speyer, signed on 16August 1570. John Sigismund acknowledged Maximilian II as the sole king of Hungary and abandoned his own royal title. Instead, he adopted the new title &quot;Prince of Transylvania and Lord of Parts of the Kingdom of Hungary&quot;, also confirming that his realm was part of the Kingdom of Hungary and would revert to Maximilian II or Maximilian II&#x27;s heir after John Sigismund&#x27;s death.

John Sigismund, now gravely ill, ratified the treaty on 1December. The last Diet to meet during his reign confirmed the decrees of previous Diets enhancing religious freedom. He died in Gyulafehérvár on 14March 1571, a few days after Maximilian II had ratified the Treaty of Speyer. The Transylvanian lords kept his death secret for days. He was buried in St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral in Gyulafehérvár, in accordance with Unitarian rite.

John Sigismund had made his last testament and will in the presence of Chancellor Mihály Csáky and Treasurer Gáspár Bekes during his earlier illness in the summer of 1567. Despite his recovery, he did not alter the text in the following years. He willed most of his wealth to his uncle, Sigismund August of Poland, and his three aunts, Sophia, Anna and Catherine. He bequeathed his library to the Protestant school of Gyulafehérvár.

John Sigismund, who never married and left no heir, was the last member of the Zápolya family. In his will, he assured the Diet of its right to choose the new monarch. The representatives of the Three Nations elected the Roman Catholic Stephen Báthory, who adopted the title Voivode of Transylvania. Gáspár Bekes, supported by Maximilian II, contested the election, but Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and consolidated his rule.

<doc id="1062000" wikidata="Q7840108" url="?curid=1062000" title="Triangle of Life">
<text>The Triangle of Life is an unsubstantiated idea about how to survive a major earthquake, typically promoted via viral emails. The idea advocates methods of protection very different from the mainstream advice of &quot;drop, cover, and hold on&quot; method that is widely supported by reputable agencies. 

In particular, the method&#x27;s developer and key proponent, Doug Copp, recommends that at the onset of a major earthquake, building occupants should seek near solid items that will provide a protective space, a void or space that could prevent injury or permit survival in the event of a major structural failure, a &quot;pancake collapse&quot;, and specifically advises &quot;against&quot; sheltering under tables.

Officials of many agencies, including the American Red Cross and the United States Geological Survey, have criticized the &quot;Triangle of Life&quot; idea, saying that it is a &quot;misguided idea&quot; and inappropriate for countries with modern building construction standards where total building collapse is unlikely.

== Purpose ==
Copp&#x27;s idea is focused on situations when a building completely collapses, falling straight down, rather than the far more common situations, when side-to-side shaking causes falling objects (such as trees, chimneys, furniture, and objects on shelves) to land on top of people. According to his idea, if the building collapses, then the weight of the ceilings falling upon the objects or furniture inside tends to crush them, but the height of the object that remains acts as a kind of roof beam over the space or void next to it, which will tend to end up with a sloping roof over it. Copp terms this space for survival the &quot;triangle of life&quot;. The larger and stronger the object, the less it will compact; the less it compacts, the larger the void next to it will be. Such triangles are the most common shape to be found in a collapsed building.

== Criticisms ==
According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the Triangle of Life is a misguided idea about the best location a person should try to occupy during an earthquake. Critics have argued that it is actually very difficult to know where these triangles will be formed, as objects (including large, heavy objects) often move around during earthquakes. It is also argued that this movement means that lying beside heavy objects is very dangerous. Statistical studies of earthquake deaths show most injuries and deaths occur due to falling objects, not structures.

A person is more likely to be injured trying to move during an earthquake rather than immediately seeking a safe space by furniture, or near an interior wall, not doorways, as they are often not structural. Different architectural standards in different countries mean that the best strategy for earthquake survival could also be different; however, for the United States, &quot;Drop, Cover, and Hold On&quot; is recommended.

An Iranian peer-reviewed article analyzed and compared both methods in detail, considering their application, the extent of people who are under the coverage, simplicity in transferring concepts, and the probability of reducing casualties and damage in developing countries such as Iran. It argued that &quot;Drop, Cover and Hold on&quot; was useful advice for people who experience smaller earthquakes without total building collapse, which is the vast majority of earthquake survivors. It found that the &quot;Triangle of life&quot; theoretically could be a better strategy during larger earthquakes in buildings with a skeleton (wood or concrete) during a building pancake-type collapse, but acknowledged the possible problems of large objects shifting and crushing the person from horizontal movement, inability to predict which side of an object would create a survivable space, and that the triangle of life method is also difficult to teach and communicate. It concluded that the &quot;Triangle of Life&quot; could harm individuals who attempted to follow the advice in buildings that did not collapse. Neither strategy was useful for the majority of the population in rural Iran because of the mud-brick architecture which has no structure. Based on the simplicity of teaching and the fact that 12,000 times more people are affected by smaller earthquakes and injured, they concluded that &quot;Drop, Cover and Hold On&quot; is still regarded as a better option for people during an earthquake.

==Testing==
In 1996, Copp claims to have made a film to prove this methodology and to have recreated a model school and home, filling them with 20 mannequins. The buildings were collapsed by earthmoving equipment that knocked the supporting pillars out. Half the mannequins were in &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; positions and the others in Copp&#x27;s &quot;Triangle of Life&quot; positions. When Copp and his crew re-entered the building after the blast, they calculated that there would have been no survivors among the mannequins in &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; positions, but 100% survival for those hiding in the triangles beside solid objects. Copp is categorical about the importance of this technique, saying &quot;Everyone who simply ducks and covers when buildings collapse is crushed to death – every time without exception.&quot;

However, a critic of Copp has stated that this was a rescue exercise rather than an experiment. Additionally, the exercise did not simulate the lateral movement of earthquakes, instead causing a pancake collapse, which is more common in areas of extremely poor construction and rare in developed countries. The critic concluded that Copp&#x27;s results are therefore misleading.

<doc id="1062003" wikidata="Q5379083" url="?curid=1062003" title="Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist insignia">
<text>The Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist (EAWS) insignia is a military badge of the United States Navy which was created in March 1980. The insignia recognizes those members of the Navy&#x27;s enlisted force who have acquired the specific professional skills, knowledge, and military experience that result in qualification for service in the aviation activities of the Navy. This includes most personnel who are trained flight deck personnel onboard aircraft carriers, or maintenance personnel at an Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Detachment or Department (AIMD) or aircraft squadron.

==Prerequisite for EAWS==

The basic prerequisite for the EAWS insignia is that a service member be assigned in a sea-duty status to a deployable naval aviation unit or aviation-capable ship. Most service members earning this insignia hold an enlisted rating designated in aviation (though a non-aviation rating is still eligible), or a support rating; in the 21st century Navy the ratings that are eligible include:

The non-designated striker rates of Airman, Airman Apprentice, and Airman Recruit are also eligible to receive the EAWS insignia. However, due to the time involved in the qualification procedure, most service members obtain at least a Petty Officer Third Class rating before earning the EAWS insignia. Sailors outside the aviation community are eligible to attain EAWS designation; however they must first complete the warfare specialist qualification for their community.

==Qualification process==

The qualification process to obtain the insignia begins with the Enlisted Aviation Personal Qualification Standards, also known as PQS. There are two PQS for the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist insignia. The first is the Common Core which consists of concepts, policies, and tasks that are common throughout Naval aviation and provide a foundation for the Sailor&#x27;s knowledge. The second is a platform-specific PQS which consists of several training tasks and other practical experience on-the-job exercises relevant to the particular aviation community the sailor is currently serving in, for example an F/A-18 squadron or an aircraft carrier (CVN). The entire Enlisted Aviation PQS normally takes approximately one year to complete from the point of entering the enlisted aviation community though it can be completed much earlier with much dedication and effort.

Those completing the Enlisted Aviation PQS must then pass a written examination and a review board conducted by senior enlisted aviation personnel, normally the rank of Chief Petty Officer or above. Upon passing both the examination and the oral board, the EAWS insignia may be presented. The Sailor is then authorized to add the Enlisted Aviation Warfare Specialist designator (AW) after his or her rate.

Upon transfer to the Sailor&#x27;s next aviation command, he or she is required to complete an abbreviated re-qualification process to familiarize the Sailor with the differences between various aviation platforms. This process must be completed within 12 months of reporting aboard or the Sailor loses the right to wear the EAWS insignia.

The EAWS insignia is not required for continued advancement in the Navy, however for those in aviation rates the insignia must be obtained by three years as a Petty Officer Second Class. Those failing to obtain the insignia may be ineligible for advancement to Petty Officer First Class, reenlistment in their current rate or may be restricted to shore assignments.

The EAWS insignia is considered one of three primary warfare badges available to the Navy&#x27;s enlisted force. The other two aforementioned badges are the Enlisted Submarine Warfare Badge and the Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist Badge. The gold Aircrew Badge or Naval Aircrew Wings (NAC) are a similar badge available to select enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy aviation community. NAC is authorized for personnel who have undergone extensive training in flight operations of naval aircraft. Such training includes weapons management, electronic warfare, and water survival. Contrary to most other services, naval aircrewmen do not receive their wings after aircrew school. Rather, they receive their wings only after completing their platform respective Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) (roughly 1 year past the completion of training).

The Aircrew Badge is a separate badge from the EAWS Badge, and qualified service members are eligible to wear both badges simultaneously. Additionally the Fleet Marine Force (FMF) Insignia is reserved for Hospital Corpsmen, Religious Program Specialists, Logistics Specialists and Operations Specialists assigned to Fleet Marine Corps units. Sailors receiving this designator are authorized to wear it above any other designator while assigned to FMF units.

OPNAVINST 1414.9B is the Navy instruction that governs the Enlisted Warfare Qualification Programs.

<text>The Iditarod Trail, also known historically as the Seward-to-Nome Trail, is a thousand-plus mile (1,600 km) historic and contemporary trail system in the US state of Alaska. The trail began as a composite of trails established by Alaskan native peoples. Its route crossed several mountain ranges and valleys and passed through numerous historical settlements en route from Seward to Nome. The discovery of gold around Nome brought thousands of people over this route beginning in 1908. Roadhouses for people and dog barns sprang up every 20 or so miles. By 1918 World War I and the lack of &#x27;gold fever&#x27; resulted in far less travel. The trail might have been forgotten except for the 1925 diphtheria outbreak in Nome. In one of the final great feats of dog sleds, twenty drivers and teams carried the life-saving serum in 127 hours. Today, the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race serves to commemorate the part the trail and its dog sleds played in the development of Alaska, and the route and a series of connecting trails have been designated Iditarod National Historic Trail.

==Historic Iditarod Trail==
The Iditarod Trail was a trail that connected a point north of Seward, Alaska, where a forerunner of the Alaska Railroad ended, through Iditarod, Alaska and then to Nome. The trail was about long. The Iditarod Trail&#x27;s antecedents were the native trails of the Dena&#x27;ina and Deg Hit&#x27;an Athabaskan Peoples and the Iñupiat and Yup&#x27;ik.

From its beginning, the trail wound along Turnagain Arm, over Crow Pass, down the Eagle River Valley and northward to the trading post of Knik, Alaska, the largest town on the Upper Cook Inlet until the railroad town of Anchorage was founded in 1915. The trail then passed west through the valleys of the Susitna River and Yentna River and over the Alaska Range and Rainy Pass. West of the Alaska Range, the trail crossed the Kuskokwim River Valley to the hills west of McGrath and entered the Innoko River mining district and the town of Ophir. After Ophir, the trail went southwest through the Kuskokwim Mountains to Iditarod.

The trail went north from Iditarod through the now abandoned towns of Dikeman and Dishkaket and then northwest to the village of Kaltag. The trail then followed the long Kaltag Portage, an ancient native trading trail, to Unalakleet, on the Norton Sound. From Unalakleet, the trail coursed north and west around the shore of the Seward Peninsula, passing the villages of Shaktoolik, Koyuk, and Golovin. It then proceeded to its end on Front Street in Nome.

The trail was used during the winter by dog mushers with large freight sleds carrying up to of freight.

==History==
When explorers and prospectors arrived in the north, they quickly learned from Native Alaskans that sled dog teams were the only way to reliably move goods and people across the frozen landscape. Not by chance, the &quot;Seward to Nome Trail&quot; as the Iditarod was originally called, was first mapped and marked in 1908 by a four-person Alaska Road Commission crew supported by dog teams.

Nine months after the route was surveyed, two prospectors made a &#x27;Christmas Day Strike&#x27; in the Iditarod Mining District, and the last great gold rush was on. Between 1910 and 1912, 10,000 gold seekers came to Alaska&#x27;s &quot;Inland Empire&quot;. In the following years they worked $30 million of gold from the ground.

===Roadhouses and dog barns===
With the rush, entrepreneurs quickly erected roadhouses and dog barns along the trail at a convenient day&#x27;s journey apart—about 20 miles—to shelter and feed trail users. Freight shippers, mail haulers and well-to-do passengers relied on dogsleds. Less wealthy foot-travelers used snowshoes, skis, and the occasional bicycle.

By 1918 the stampede reversed itself. New winter mail contracts bypassed the fading town of Iditarod in favor of more direct routes to Nome, and World War I drew young miners and workers away from the gold fields.

The Cape Nome Roadhouse is the last remaining historical roadhouse on the Iditarod Trail and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Nome serum run===

In the winter of 1925, a deadly outbreak of diphtheria struck fear in the hearts of Nome residents. Winter ice had closed the port city from the outside world without enough serum to inoculate its residents. Serum from Anchorage was rushed by train to Nenana and picked up by a sled dog relay. Twenty of Alaska&#x27;s best mushers and their teams carried the serum from Nenana to Nome in just over 127 hours.

This was to be one of the final great feats by sled dogs. Within a decade, air transport replaced the sled dog team as the preferred way to ship mail. With downturns in gold mining, most of the roadhouses closed, boom towns emptied, and the Iditarod Trail fell into disuse.

===A partnership effort re-opens the Iditarod Trail===

Forest and tundra reclaimed the Iditarod Trail for almost a half a century until Alaskans, led by Joe Redington Sr., reopened the routes. To draw attention to the role dogs played in Alaska&#x27;s history, Redington and his friends created an epic sled dog race from Anchorage to Nome. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race ultimately revived dog mushing in Alaska and around the world. After years of effort by Redington and the Alaska Congressional delegation, the Iditarod was designated as a National Historic Trail in 1978.

==Management of the Historic Trail==
Most of the historic Iditarod Trail is located on public lands managed by the State of Alaska or federal agencies, although some segments pass over private lands. No one entity manages the entire historic trail—management is guided by a cooperative plan adopted by state and federal agencies in the mid-1980s. The federal Bureau of Land Management coordinates cooperative management of the trail and is the primary point of contact for matters involving the entire trail.

Every year local groups, community clubs and individuals contribute time and money to maintain and improve the Iditarod Trail. The statewide non-profit Iditarod National Historic Trail Inc. helps protect and improve the trail and keep the &quot;lore of the trail&quot; alive.

==Iditarod race route==
The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, named after the now-abandoned town of Iditarod, commemorates the last great gold rush in America to the Iditarod gold fields and the critical role that dogs played in the settlement and development of Alaska. It is a common myth that the race commemorates the dogsled relay known as the 1925 &quot;Serum Run&quot; from Nenana to Nome. The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race was first established by Joe Redington Sr. in the early 1973 to encourage the designation of the Iditarod Trail as a National Historic Trail, bring the dying tradition of dog sledding back to the villages of Alaska, and promote the sport of competitive dogsled racing.

Today the race follows much of the primary route of the Iditarod National Historic Trail, with a segment alternating north or south, depending on the year. (These segments are also part of the Iditarod National Historic Trail). Every odd year (i.e., 2011), the race travels the south route from Ophir to Kaltag through the ghost town of Iditarod. On even years, the race travels north from Ophir through Ruby and Galena to Kaltag. The 1925 Serum Run followed of trail (now designated as the Iditarod National Historic Trail system) between Ruby and Nome.
The Iditarod Trail Invitational human powered race for bikers, runners and skiers also follows the Iditarod Trail from Knik to McGrath with a 350-mile race and to Nome in a 1000-mile race. In 2024, Sunny Stroeer of Utah became the first woman to ski the 1,000-mile Iditarod Trail Invitational.

formula_2

where the indices &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;m&quot; (which are integers) are referred to as the degree and order of the associated Legendre polynomial respectively. This equation has nonzero solutions that are nonsingular on only if &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are integers with 0 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;ℓ&quot;, or with trivially equivalent negative values. When in addition &quot;m&quot; is even, the function is a polynomial. When &quot;m&quot; is zero and &quot;ℓ&quot; integer, these functions are identical to the Legendre polynomials. In general, when &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are integers, the regular solutions are sometimes called &quot;associated Legendre polynomials&quot;, even though they are not polynomials when &quot;m&quot; is odd. The fully general class of functions with arbitrary real or complex values of &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are Legendre functions. In that case the parameters are usually labelled with Greek letters.

The Legendre ordinary differential equation is frequently encountered in physics and other technical fields. In particular, it occurs when solving Laplace&#x27;s equation (and related partial differential equations) in spherical coordinates. Associated Legendre polynomials play a vital role in the definition of spherical harmonics.

==Definition for non-negative integer parameters and ==
These functions are denoted formula_3, where the superscript indicates the order and not a power of &quot;P&quot;. Their most straightforward definition is in terms

the &quot;P&quot; can be expressed in the form
formula_7

This equation allows extension of the range of &quot;m&quot; to: . The definitions of , resulting from this expression by substitution of , are proportional. Indeed, equate the coefficients of equal powers on the left and right hand side of
formula_8
then it follows that the proportionality constant is
formula_9
so that
formula_10

===Alternative notations===
The following alternative notations are also used in literature:
formula_11

===Closed Form===
The Associated Legendre Polynomial can also be written as:
formula_12
with simple monomials and the generalized form of the binomial coefficient.

==Orthogonality==
The associated Legendre polynomials are not mutually orthogonal in general. For example, formula_13 is not orthogonal to formula_14. However, some subsets are orthogonal. Assuming 0 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;ℓ&quot;, they satisfy the orthogonality condition for fixed &quot;m&quot;:

formula_15

Where is the Kronecker delta.

Also, they satisfy the orthogonality condition for fixed :

formula_16

==Negative and/or negative ==

The differential equation is clearly invariant under a change in sign of &quot;m&quot;.

The functions for negative &quot;m&quot; were shown above to be proportional to those of positive &quot;m&quot;:
formula_17

(This followed from the Rodrigues&#x27; formula definition. This definition also makes the various recurrence formulas work for positive or negative .)
formula_18

The differential equation is also invariant under a change from to , and the functions for negative are defined by

formula_19

==Parity==
From their definition, one can verify that the Associated Legendre functions are either even or odd according to

formula_20

==The first few associated Legendre functions==

The first few associated Legendre functions, including those for negative values of &quot;m&quot;, are:

formula_21

formula_22

formula_23

formula_24

formula_25
==Recurrence formula==

These functions have a number of recurrence properties:

formula_26

formula_27

formula_28

formula_29

formula_30

formula_31

formula_32

formula_33

formula_34

formula_35

formula_36

formula_37

formula_38

formula_39

formula_40

Helpful identities (initial values for the first recursion):

formula_41
formula_42
formula_43

with the double factorial.

==Gaunt&#x27;s formula==
The integral over the product of three associated Legendre polynomials (with orders matching as shown below) is a necessary ingredient when developing products of Legendre polynomials into a series linear in the Legendre polynomials. For instance, this turns out to be necessary when doing atomic calculations of the Hartree–Fock variety where matrix elements of the Coulomb operator are needed. For this we have Gaunt&#x27;s formula 
formula_44
This formula is to be used under the following assumptions: 
# the degrees are non-negative integers formula_45
# all three orders are non-negative integers formula_46
# formula_47 is the largest of the three orders
# the orders sum up formula_48
# the degrees obey formula_49

Other quantities appearing in the formula are defined as
formula_50
formula_51
formula_52

The integral is zero unless
# the sum of degrees is even so that formula_53 is an integer
# the triangular condition is satisfied formula_54

Dong and Lemus (2002) generalized the derivation of this formula to integrals over a product of an arbitrary number of associated Legendre polynomials.

==Generalization via hypergeometric functions==

These functions may actually be defined for general complex parameters and argument:

formula_55

where formula_56 is the gamma function and formula_57 is the hypergeometric function

formula_58

They are called the Legendre functions when defined in this more general way. They satisfy the same differential equation as before:

formula_59

Since this is a second order differential equation, it has a second solution, formula_60, defined as:

formula_61

formula_62 and formula_60 both obey the various recurrence formulas given previously.

==Reparameterization in terms of angles==
These functions are most useful when the argument is reparameterized in terms of angles, letting formula_64:

formula_65

Using the relation formula_66, the list given above yields the first few polynomials, parameterized this way, as:

formula_67

The orthogonality relations given above become in this formulation:
for fixed &quot;m&quot;, formula_68 are orthogonal, parameterized by θ over formula_69, with weight formula_70:

formula_71

Also, for fixed &quot;ℓ&quot;:

formula_72

In terms of θ, formula_73 are solutions of

formula_74

More precisely, given an integer &quot;m&quot;formula_750, the above equation has
nonsingular solutions only when formula_76 for &quot;ℓ&quot;
an integer ≥ &quot;m&quot;, and those solutions are proportional to
formula_73.

==Applications in physics: spherical harmonics==

In many occasions in physics, associated Legendre polynomials in terms of angles occur where spherical symmetry is involved. The colatitude angle in spherical coordinates is
the angle formula_78 used above. The longitude angle, formula_79, appears in a multiplying factor. Together, they make a set of functions called spherical harmonics. These functions express the symmetry of the two-sphere under the action of the Lie group SO(3).

What makes these functions useful is that they are central to the solution of the equation
formula_80 on the surface of a sphere. In spherical coordinates θ (colatitude) and φ (longitude), the Laplacian is

formula_81

When the partial differential equation

formula_82

is solved by the method of separation of variables, one gets a φ-dependent part formula_83 or formula_84 for integer m≥0, and an equation for the θ-dependent part

formula_74

for which the solutions are formula_73 with formula_87
and formula_88.

Therefore, the equation

formula_89

has nonsingular separated solutions only when formula_88,
and those solutions are proportional to

formula_91

and

formula_92

For each choice of &quot;ℓ&quot;, there are functions
for the various values of &quot;m&quot; and choices of sine and cosine.
They are all orthogonal in both &quot;ℓ&quot; and &quot;m&quot; when integrated over the
surface of the sphere.

The solutions are usually written in terms of complex exponentials:

formula_93
The functions formula_94 are the spherical harmonics, and the quantity in the square root is a normalizing factor.
Recalling the relation between the associated Legendre functions of positive and negative &quot;m&quot;, it is easily shown that the spherical harmonics satisfy the identity

formula_95

The spherical harmonic functions form a complete orthonormal set of functions in the sense of Fourier series. Workers in the fields of geodesy, geomagnetism and spectral analysis use a different phase and normalization factor than given here (see spherical harmonics).

When a 3-dimensional spherically symmetric partial differential equation is solved by the method of separation of variables in spherical coordinates, the part that remains after removal of the radial part is typically
of the form

formula_96

and hence the solutions are spherical harmonics.

==Generalizations==
The Legendre polynomials are closely related to hypergeometric series. In the form of spherical harmonics, they express the symmetry of the two-sphere under the action of the Lie group SO(3). There are many other Lie groups besides SO(3), and analogous generalizations of the Legendre polynomials exist to express the symmetries of semi-simple Lie groups and Riemannian symmetric spaces. Crudely speaking, one may define a Laplacian on symmetric spaces; the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can be thought of as generalizations of the spherical harmonics to other settings.

<doc id="1062023" wikidata="Q64048" url="?curid=1062023" title="Patriarch Theodore II of Alexandria">
<text>Theodore (Theodoros) II(; born &quot;Nikolaos Khoreftakis&quot; (), November 25, 1954) is the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria and all Africa. He was previously a monk in the Agarathos Holy Monastery of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.

== Early life and education ==
He was born in the Greek island of Crete in 1954, where he completed his schooling. He is a graduate of the Rizarios Ecclesiastical School in Athens and holds a degree from the Theology Department of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He also studied History of Art, Literature and Philosophy in Odesa.

He was ordained as Deacon in 1975 and Archbishop on 23 April 1978 by Metropolitan of Lambis and Sfakion Theodore Tzedakis. From 1975 to 1985, he served as Archdeacon and Chancellor of the Holy Metropolis of Lambis and Sfakion in Crete, where he developed significant Preaching and Philanthropic activities (hostels for needy youth, etc.). From 1985 to 1990 he served as Patriarchal Exarch in Russia, based in the Ukrainian city of Odesa, during the tenure of Patriarchs Nicholas VI and Parthenios.

== Years of ministry ==
Theodore established the Institution of Hellenic Culture and the Philiki Eterea Museum with 600 children, where they were taught a thorough knowledge of Greek. In 1990, he was ordained Bishop of Kyrene and was appointed Representative of Patriarch Parthenios in Athens (1990–97). He always accompanied Patriarch Parthenios on his travels throughout Africa and to many international, interfaith and theological conferences.

In 1997, he was appointed Patriarchal Vicar of Alexandria by Patriarch Petros VII to assist him at the outset of his Patriarchate and after ten months he was elected as Metropolitan of Cameroon. He greatly developed missionary activity there. He built churches, schools and hospitals, helping many Africans and local Greeks. In 2002, he was transferred to the Holy Metropolis of Zimbabwe, where he established four missionary centres in Harare, a Hellenic Cultural Centre for 400 delegates, two large missionary centres in Malawi, with a hospital, technical schools and nursery schools. Aided by the Greek Parliament he renovated the Hellenic Square (School-Church-Vicarage) in Beira, Mozambique. He founded churches and contributed to the establishment of the Hellenic Communities of Botswana and Angola.

== Patriarch of Alexandria ==
Following the sudden death of late Patriarch Petros in a helicopter crash, Theodore was unanimously elected on October 9, 2004 by the Synod of the Alexandrian Throne as Patriarch. The enthronement ceremony took place at the Cathedral of Annunciation in Alexandria, on Sunday, October 24, 2004, in the presence of distinguished religious and civilian representatives and a great number of faithful. He is the seventh of Patriarch of Alexandria of Cretan origin after Silvester, Meletius Pigas, Cyrillos Lucaris, Gerasimus Palladas, Gerasimus Spartaliotis and Meletius Metaxakis.

On 8 November 2019, Patriarch Theodore II formally recognised the autocephaly granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to the Orthodox Church of Ukraine earlier that year. In response, the Moscow Patriarchate (the ROC) severed eucharistic communion with Patriarch Theodore and the like-minded bishops of his church, a decision that was confirmed by the Standing Holy Synod of the ROC on 26 December 2019.

<text>Collier Street is a small village and civil parish in the Borough of Maidstone in Kent, England. The village is in a rural location but is close to the larger villages of Yalding, Marden and Horsmonden. 

The village includes St Margaret&#x27;s Church, a primary school, a small business estate and several farms. St. Margaret&#x27;s church and school are at the centre of the village. The church forms part of a benefice with St. Mary&#x27;s in Laddingford and St. Peter &amp; St. Paul in Yalding. The three villages are located within three miles of each other but Collier Street, once part of Yalding&#x27;s civil parish, has had its own parish since 1999. The civic or civil parish of Collier Street is governed by an elected parish council and was formed following a review by Maidstone Borough Council.
==History==
The village seems not to have existed before the start of the nineteenth century, nor does the road even appear on maps before the late C18th. It is most likely that the village was named for a long narrow clearing (&#x27;strait&#x27; hence &#x27;street&#x27;) through a wood used by charcoal burners (hence &#x27;Collier&#x27;). Subsequently farms were established along with a handful of country houses before the majority of housing followed in the early Victorian era. The church was built between 1847 and 1849 and the attached school was opened in 1860.

Collier Street as a village incorporated a handful of smaller places named for the older farms or substantial houses which existed before the majority of the village&#x27;s housing was built in Victorian times: for example Saxonden, Spitzbrook and Mockbeggar. A couple of old wealden roads make up the village proper; the main road which has no specific name is the B2162, part of a longer old road running from SE London / NW Kent down to Rye on the south coast.

Historically, the village was situated in the middle of a hop-growing region. Its population swelled during the harvest as whole families, often from South-East London, arrived to help bring in the hops. However, as foreign hops became cheaper and easier to source nearly all the farms moved to other arable production by the second half of the C20th. Today the fields are home to pears, strawberries and raspberries but the area is known more for its apple orchards – Collier Street has been colloquially known as &#x27;The village in an orchard&#x27;. Some of the old hoppers&#x27; huts can still be found amongst the local orchards, fields and gardens.
==Amenities==
The Church of England primary school (St. Margaret&#x27;s CEP) has been enlarged several times, now to accommodate more than 100 pupils. The closest comprehensive secondary school is Mascalls Academy and there are several private schools in the area. Ex-pupils of St. Margaret&#x27;s typically attend Mascalls or one of the various grammar schools in the nearest towns.

The village has a population of less than 500 and has no shop, post office or pub. There were once at least two pubs in the village itself but these are now private residences: The Duke of Wellington (now Wellington House) and the Prince of Wales (now Kerry House). Two more in the parish have also closed: The Engineers (between Collier Street and Laddingford) closed in 1970 and the White Hart (Claygate) closed in 2016. There are still two pubs within a couple of miles of the village however; The Woolpack in Benover to the north and The Chequers in Laddingford to the Northwest. There was once a shop / post office at the far end of Haviker Street but this was not re-instated after a fire in 1994. There was also a shop and police station opposite Bartons Farm in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Sport==
Collier Street was once home to The Boarded Circuit, a Grasstrack and Longtrack motorcycle racing circuit, which held two or three events each season. The circuit was unique in being the only fully boarded permanent Grasstrack venue in the UK, but this has now closed.

<text>Al-Khiyam (; sometimes spelled Khiam) is a large town and municipality in the Nabatieh Governorate of Southern Lebanon.

==Etymology==
According to Edward Henry Palmer, the name means tents.
Haifa Nassar, a Khiyam-based journalist, cites sources that confirm this. Muhammad Qubaisi, author of a book on South Lebanon, writes that according to the Torah, Jacob moved his family and livestock to the plain of Al-Khiam, where he lived in tents.

==Location==
Al-Khiyam is situated approximately south from the capital city of Beirut and south-east from the city of Nabatieh. The border with Israel is to the south. Khiam lies at a height of above sea level.

==History==

===Ottoman period===
In 1596, the village of Hiyam was an Ottoman &quot;nahiya&quot; (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the &quot;liwa&#x27;&quot; (district) of Safad, with a population of 111 Muslim households and 7 bachelors. The villagers paid a tax on wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, goats and beehives, in addition to &quot;occasional revenues&quot;; a total of 6,914 akçe.

In 1838, Eli Smith writes about &quot;el-Khiyam&#x27;,&quot; a Metawileh, &quot;Greek&quot; Christian and Maronite village in Merj &#x27;Ayun&#x27;.

In 1875, Victor Guérin visited: &quot;El Khiam contains two quarters: the one on the south, with a population of 700 Metawileh, and the other on the north, with 600 Christians, divided into Maronites, Greek-Orthodox, and Greek-Catholics, with some Protestants, who have founded a chapel and a school.&quot;

In 1881, the PEF&#x27;s &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot; (SWP) described it as: &quot;A village, northeast of the Merj Ayun, built of stone, containing about 300 Christians and 200 Druze. It contains a white round Moslem holy place and a modern church. It is situated on a low ridge, surrounded by figs, olives, and arable. The water supply is from three rock-cut cisterns, one birket, and the good spring of &#x27;Ain ed Derdarah.&quot;

=== French mandate period ===
The municipality of Al-Khiyam was established in 1928 during the French Mandate.The first municipal council, led by Haj Mohammad Haj Hussein Abdullah, was dissolved in 1931. 

In 1935, Haj Ali Afandi Haj Ibrahim Abdullah was elected mayor. In 1937, he stepped down after being appointed to the Lebanese parliament.
===After independence===
In 1953, Haj Khalil Haidar was re-elected and served as mayor until 1957. In 1957, he was replaced by Hassan Ali Faiz who remained in this position until 1963. A new council was elected in 1963, with 16 members, and Kamel Mohammad Ali Al-Daoui as the mayor and Haj Asaad Khalil Mhana as the deputy mayor. This council continued its work until the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975.

During the 1990s, Al-Khiam was the site of the Khiam Detention Center, operated by the South Lebanon Army during the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon. Lebanese Muslim civilians were exposed to torture by Israeli and Lebanese agents in this camp and faced indefinite detention once arrested. The prison was captured by Hezbollah during the Battle of Khiam in 2000, shortly before the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon.

The town saw a major confrontation between the Israeli Army and Hezbollah fighters in the 2006 Lebanon War, during which a United Nations post was bombed by the Israeli Army killing four United Nations Military Observers. The IDF and Hezbollah clashed in the area once again in June 2024, with fighter jets and artillery strikes.

In October 2024, the village of Al-Khiyam become the site of heavy fighting between the IDF and Hezbollah. On 29 October, Israeli tanks entered the outskirts of the Khaim, marking their deepest push into southern Lebanon since launching a ground operation in September.

==Demographics==
In 2014 Muslims made up 93.17% and Christians 6.48% of registered voters in Al-Khiyam. 91.29% of the voters were Shiite Muslims.

* Ali Daher (born 1996), Lebanese footballer
* Issam Abdallah (1986-2023), Reuters video journalist
* Ali Hassan Khalil (born 1964), former Minister of Finance

<doc id="1062036" wikidata="Q3281737" url="?curid=1062036" title="Morgan Stewart's Coming Home">
<text>Morgan Stewart&#x27;s Coming Home is a 1987 American comedy film starring Jon Cryer, Viveka Davis, Paul Gleason, Nicholas Pryor and Lynn Redgrave. The screenplay was written by Ken Hixon and David N. Titcher. The film was also released as &quot;Home Front&quot; and &quot;Homefront Riviera&quot; in some countries. The film was directed by Paul Aaron and Terry Winsor, but upon release the director was listed as &quot;Alan Smithee&quot;, a name often used when directors ask to remove their names from a picture.

==Plot==
Morgan Stewart is the son of a Republican senator from Virginia who has spent most of his life away at boarding school. While disappointed he cannot spend Thanksgiving with his parents, it does not faze him. He pulls off a major prank with three of his friends only to be busted by the Headmaster. Coincidentally, Morgan is told to he is going home when his mother calls the school and is ready for him to finally return.

Morgan is brought home to help with his father&#x27;s campaign for re-election as Senator with family being the notion he sets to bring. However, Morgan&#x27;s mother expects him to be conservative while his father tends to be more open to the fact that Morgan is growing up. Along the way, Morgan butts heads with both his mother and Jay, the campaign manager. Morgan decides to start doing what it takes for the family to be together, including doing chores like waxing the floors. When Morgan goes to a book signing for his idol George A. Romero, he meets fellow horror film fan Emily and the two soon begin a relationship. When Morgan &quot;borrows&quot; the car to go on a date with Emily, he is busted when Emily&#x27;s little brother calls the police and is grounded.

Morgan soon learns that his mother has placed cameras in his room. When Morgan learns he and his father have a lot more in common than he imagined, he still faces the wrath of his mother. This comes when Emily learns that Morgan had lied about his parents but when Morgan finally loses it after losing her, he is threatened with military school by Jay. Morgan escapes using a chainsaw signed by &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot;&#x27;s Tobe Hooper. He finally comes clean to Emily, who forgives him and the two decide to open Morgan&#x27;s coin collection that his late aunt left him (after he pickpocketed Jay to get the key). They learn that Jay has been embezzling campaign funds with the safety deposit box with the coin collection also containing evidence of the embezzlement. When Jay learns what has happened, he tries but ultimately fails to stop Morgan.

The end result would be Senator Stewart getting re-elected. Morgan&#x27;s mother finally decides to give up her vegetarian lifestyle and eat meat. Jay serves prison time. The family butler, Ivan, becomes a real estate tycoon and leaves wife Francheska for a younger woman. Francheska returns home to Russia happily single and back on her farm with her keeping in touch with Morgan. Emily is accepted by Morgan&#x27;s parents and Morgan is finally happy he has a family once again.

==Production==
The film was made in 1985 under the title &quot;Home Front&quot; directed by Terry Winsor. Four weeks after filming started, Winsor was fired. He was replaced by Paul Aaron but neither received credit on the film.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack included the opening track &#x27;Painted Moon&#x27; by The Silencers and music by Peter Bernstein, Timothy Duckworth, Bernard Herrmann, Chris Isaak, John Manikoff, and The Surfaris.

==Critical reception==
Critics generally felt the film to be poor, although the cast, especially Jon Cryer, was usually praised. The New York Times noted that &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine any adult sitting through this movie without dozing off or cracking up, but it&#x27;s a harmless enough fantasy, and if Jon Cryer&#x27;s career takes off -- he&#x27;s due in at least two more films, &quot;Dudes&quot; and &quot;Superman IV&quot; -- &quot;Morgan Stewart&quot; may find a place in the archives as an early little movie in which the star wasn&#x27;t nearly matched by the material.&quot;

Rob Lowing of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote of the film &quot;there are three good reasons to see it. However, these don&#x27;t include the direction, storyline or soundtrack.&quot; She was particularly critical of the direction: &quot;Director Smithee should cop most of the blame...a camera which wanders all over the place, a totally bland soundtrack, and fussy repetition of ideas...&quot; Conversely, Lowing singled out actors Paul Gleason, Lynn Redgrave and Jon Cryer as the three central attractions of the film, noting that &quot;there are flashes of brilliance, though, particularly when Cryer and Redgrave are left alone to strut their stuff.&quot;

<text>Dominic P. Giampaolo is a software developer who helped develop the Be File System for the Be Operating System (BeOS) and currently works at Apple Inc.

After graduating from Lewiston High School in Lewiston, Maine in 1987, he started studying political science at American University in Washington, D.C., but changed to computer science after one semester. After completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree, he did a master&#x27;s degree at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

After graduating, he travelled to the west coast to work for Silicon Graphics in their Advanced Systems Division. There he worked in the group that ported IRIX to the 64-bit R8000 microprocessor chip set and worked on the RealityEngine and InfiniteReality graphics systems. While working for Silicon Graphics, he located and fixed a bug in Discreet Logic&#x27;s Flame compositing system that was delaying post-production of the motion picture &quot;Speed&quot;.

In October 1995, Giampaolo heard about the BeBox from a friend at a poker game. Shortly after visiting the Be Inc. offices to see a demo of the computer, he began working on the BeOS, working initially in a number of areas including the kernel and the POSIX layer but most notably developing the Be File System alongside Cyril Meurillon, which replaced the Old Be File System written by Benoit Schillings which had itself replaced the original flat file system written by Meurillon. The Be File System included a number of advances compared to other personal computer filesystems in use at the time, such as a journal to improve reliability and support for extensive metadata that can be indexed to respond quickly to searches.

After Be, Giampaolo worked at Google and then QNX Software Systems. While at QNX, he discovered a bug in the Instruction Fetch Unit of Intel Pentium II and Pentium III processors.

Since March 2002, Giampaolo has been working for Apple Inc., where he is part of the macOS file system (Apple File System project) and Spotlight groups.

<text>USS &quot;S-38&quot; (SS-143) was an &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-38&quot;′s keel was laid down on 15 January 1919 by the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 17 June 1919, sponsored by Mrs. Grace M. Collins, and commissioned on 11 May 1923.

==Service history==
Fitted out at Mare Island, &quot;S-38&quot; joined Submarine Division 17 (SubDiv 17) at San Pedro, California, on 24 May and immediately began preparations for a cruise to the Aleutian Islands. On 9 June, she moved north with submarine tenders ,
, and three other S-boats. On 21 June, they reached Dutch Harbor, whence the boats conducted evaluation tests and exercises for the next three and a half weeks. On 16 July, the force put into Anchorage, Alaska.

On 17 July, while performing routine maintenance on &quot;S-38&quot;&#x27;s motors, a crewman removed a valve cover, creating an opening to sea below the boat&#x27;s waterline, flooding the motor room. The submarine was alongside her tender, , and no personnel were injured. She was easily raised, but the motors were crippled. Temporary repairs took until 23 July, when the boat was taken in tow by &quot;Ortolan&quot;.

===Asiatic Fleet===
&quot;S-38&quot; reached Mare Island on 1 August, remained there for repairs and alterations until April 1924, then returned to San Pedro, whence she conducted local exercises into the summer. In August, she prepared for duty with the Asiatic Fleet, and, in mid-September she headed west across the Pacific. She stood into Manila Bay on 4 November 1924 and, for the next 17 years, operated out of Cavite, with annual summer deployments to the China coast. Division operations occupied Asiatic Fleet submarines during most of the period; but, as civil war intensified on the mainland, submarine schedules became more varied. Annual deployments and regular exercises of the boats as a division were shortened in length, while exercises and patrols of individual boats were increased in number, duration, and range. During these operations, the submarines cruised off the Philippines, along the Indo-China coast, and into the Netherlands East Indies.

===World War II===
In June 1940, &quot;S-38&quot; completed her last cruise to China; and, from then into the fall of 1941, she conducted exercises, including joint Army-Navy war games, and practice war patrols in the waters off Luzon and neighboring islands. On 8 December 1941 (7 December east of the International Date Line), the attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, and &quot;S-38&quot; departed Manila Bay on her first war patrol.

====1941====
Initially assigned to patrol in Verde Island Passage, she shifted to the west coast of Mindoro on 9 December. On 11 December, &quot;S-38&quot; mistakenly torpedoed and sank Norwegian freighter &quot;Hydra II&quot; west of Mindoro&#x27;s Cape Calavite. On 12 December, she moved into the Cape Calavite area and, on the night of 19/20 December, set a course toward the Luzon coast. The following night, she put into Camens Cove; repaired damage caused by an explosion of pressure built up in the port engine lube oil cooler; and, with dawn on 21 December, resumed her patrol.

Receiving orders to penetrate shallow, hazard-filled Lingayen Gulf and attack hostile shipping, she entered the gulf just before dawn on 22 December. At 06:45, she sighted an enemy convoy of four transports, escorted by two destroyers. Waiting for the range to drop to a very short , at 07:10, she fired four bow tubes — all misses. As she reloaded, the enemy destroyers closed in, pinging, but no depth charges came. At 07:58, she launched two torpedoes at an anchored enemy cargo ship. Less than a minute later, the &quot;Hayo Maru&quot; blew up. Enemy destroyers again closed the submarine, and she went &quot;deep&quot;, to , and lay doggo as depth charges rained, none close. From 08:04 to 09:30, the S-boat ran silent, using evasive tactics. At 09:30, she grounded on the muddy bottom; she remained there most of the day, destroyers, joined by small boats, continuing to search, without success. At 21:30, the hunted submarine began efforts to clear by backing. During the maneuvering, her port propeller was damaged; but, by 22:01, she was free and underway for the Hundred Islands area on the western side of the gulf. &quot;S-38&quot; surfaced to change the air and charge batteries, then dove at dawn, remaining on the bottom all the next day, giving her crew a rest.

&quot;S-38&quot; remained undetected through 23 December; on 24 December, she moved to the southern section of the gulf where she closed a formation of six large auxiliaries just prior to 11:30. At 11:52, there was a huge explosion on her port side, evidently a patrol plane&#x27;s bomb. She went deeper. Between 12:06 and 12:08, eight more exploded around her. At 12:09, she stopped all motors and sank to the bottom in 180 feet of water. The depth charging continued, but the explosions were more distant. At 12:30, the submarine began to move again. At 12:45, the enemy hunters again located her and resumed depth charging. &quot;S-38&quot; again settled to the bottom. The depth charging continued until after 13:00. The search continued until after 18:00.

At 18:42, the submarine got underway, heading back to the Hundred Islands area. At 22:35, she surfaced to recharge her batteries. Five minutes later, her improperly-vented after battery exploded. At 23:04, she went ahead on her starboard engine, making her way out of Lingayen Gulf.

Soon after 02:00 on 25 December, she sighted two enemy destroyers, but remained undetected. At 03:46, however, she sighted a third, which sighted her. &quot;S-38&quot; submerged. The destroyer closed the submarine&#x27;s last surface position and, at 03:50, commenced depth charging. From then until after 09:00, the submarine evaded the destroyer, using her one quiet propeller. She then grounded on a steep bank at . For the next two hours, the destroyer circled. &quot;S-38&quot; slid down to , used her motor to bring herself up, then repeated the maneuver. The destroyer moved off and, at 12:35, the S-boat got underway for Manila. An hour later, she grounded, but only briefly; and, at 21:45 on 26 December she entered the outer minefield at the entrance to Manila Bay.

====1942====
Cavite had now become untenable, and &quot;S-38&quot; was ordered to Soerabaja and after repairs &quot;S-38&quot; was to operate with other Allied forces attempting to stem the Japanese thrust into the East Indies. On 14 January 1942, the submarine arrived at the Dutch base on the north coast of Java. On 15 January, the ABDA Command was officially established. On 24 January, the Japanese reached Balikpapan. On 25 January, &quot;S-38&quot;, hurriedly repaired, departed Soerabaja to patrol in Makassar Strait off Balikpapan.

During the next two weeks, &quot;S-38&quot; underwent two severe depth charge attacks. On 7 February, she penetrated close to Balikpapan to examine shipping in the harbor, activity along the coast road, and new defenses in the area. On 8 February, she resumed offensive operations, but poor weather hindered success. On 9 February, the Japanese moved on Makassar City, and &quot;S-38&quot; was ordered to patrol off Cape William on the Celebes side of the strait, where she remained until 12 February.

Then ordered back to Soerabaja the submarine arrived at her Javanese base on 16 February. Six days later, she again put to sea. Moving east, she patrolled initially off Meinderts Reef, off the northeast coast of Java; then headed north to round the eastern end of Madoera Island en route to Bawean Island. On 26 February, she shelled Japanese facilities at Sangkapura; then patrolled between Bawean and the western approach to Soerabaja. On 28 February, she picked up 58 survivors from destroyer , sunk the day before at the Battle of the Java Sea; and, on 1 March, transferred the British sailors to a surface ship in Madoera Strait. She then resumed her hunt for Japanese shipping which had put the enemy ashore at Batavia, Indramajoe, and Rembang, the latter the last large oil center in the Netherlands East Indies and only from Soerabaja.

On the morning of 2 March, &quot;S-38&quot; fired four torpedoes at a Japanese light cruiser and two at a destroyer, believing he damaged the cruiser, perhaps sank it. In fact, the torpedoes had missed light cruiser . S-38 then waited on the bottom as destroyers searched for her. In mid-afternoon, she moved out of the immediate area. That evening, she unsuccessfully attacked another enemy warship and, although damaged, survived another hunt by hiding beneath a halocline. On 3 March, she was ordered to western Australia.

&quot;S-38&quot; transited the whirlpool and rapids area at the lower end of Lombok Strait on 5 March. On 13 March she arrived at Fremantle; and, at the end of the month, proceeded to Brisbane to join other Asiatic Fleet S-boats in forming the nucleus of TF 42 and to prepare for operations in the New Guinea-Bismarck Archipelago-Solomon Islands area.

During March and April, enemy air raids against Port Moresby intensified in preparation to move into Papua from northeast New Guinea. On 28 April, &quot;S-38&quot; cleared Moreton Bay and headed north to patrol the Papuan coast. In mid-May, she shifted to Jomard Passage, where she remained, unable to communicate with Brisbane, until the night of 18 May. She then set a course for the Queensland coast. On 20 May, she passed debris believed to be a result of the Battle of the Coral Sea, and that night she successfully transmitted a message to Brisbane. On 24 May, she returned to Moreton Bay.

A month-long repair and test period followed during which cells damaged in the battery explosion on her first war patrol were finally replaced. On 24 June, she again stood down the Brisbane River, cleared Moreton Bay, and entered the Coral Sea bound for the Solomons. On 29 June, she entered her assigned patrol area and headed for the passage between the Russell Islands and Guadalcanal. On 30 June, she was standing down Lunga Roads, and, on 1 July, she arrived off Tulagi where she closed her first target of the patrol. Detected as she prepared to fire, she evaded a depth-charging destroyer and gradually gained sea room. The depth charging, however, aggravated problems of old age and corrosion. Depth control became difficult as leaks developed in an auxiliary tank and in the motor room bilges. The leaks in the latter worsened as she moved out of the immediate area and resulted in a stream of air bubbles which led to aerial detection two hours after she had left the destroyer behind. Thereafter, mechanical problems multiplied; and &quot;S-38&quot;, unable to remain effective on her station, set a course for Brisbane, arriving on 7 July.

For the better part of the next 20 days, &quot;S-38&quot; underwent intensive, round-the-clock repairs at the Queensland Government Dry Dock, and, on 28 July, she again headed out across the Coral Sea. On 4 August, she entered her assigned area, New Britain-New Ireland, and commenced patrolling along the Rabaul-New Guinea traffic lanes. By 6 August, she had moved eastward along the New Britain coast, crossed the shipping lanes at the southern entrance to St. George&#x27;s Channel, and closed the coast of New Ireland. On 7 August, she shifted her search for Japanese shipping further seaward and within hours sighted several targets; but distance, lack of speed and maneuverability, and mechanical breakdowns precluded successful attacks. This was later the main Japanese attack force for the Battle of Savo Island. On 8 August, however, approximately eight miles south of Cape St. George, she sighted a transport escorted by a destroyer and approaching so as to pass close ahead. At 23:09, &quot;S-38&quot; rigged for depth charging and prepared to fire. At 23:24, she fired two torpedoes at the transport. Less than a minute later, both exploded on target. The &quot;Meiyo Maru&quot; went dead in the water. &quot;S-38&quot; commenced evasive tactics. At 23:30, the destroyer dropped its first depth charge. At 23:32, &quot;Meiyo Maru&quot; began breaking up (the second of just two ships confirmed sunk by &quot;S-38&quot;) and, at 23:39, &quot;S-38&quot; headed south.

The sunken transport&#x27;s escort continued searching but, by 01:45 on 9 August, &quot;S-38&quot; had moved out of the area and all sounds of the search had faded behind her. On the night of 9/10 August, the S-boat returned to the traffic lanes eight miles (15 km) off the southwest coast of New Ireland, where she continued her hunting until 12 August. She then moved westward returning to the southeastern coast of New Britain to attempt to intercept traffic between Rabaul and New Guinea. On 15 August, she headed for Australia and reached Brisbane a week later.

Fleet submarines were now ranging the Pacific, and the S-boats were being ordered back to the United States for modernization overhauls. On 21 September, &quot;S-38&quot;, carrying only four torpedoes to avoid depleting the supply at Brisbane, departed Australia for the United States. Ordered to reconnoiter several of the Gilbert Islands en route, she fueled and took on lube oil and provisions at Nouméa on 25 and 26 September, then moved toward the Gilberts. On 30 September, she altered her course and headed for Anuda in the Santa Cruz Islands where she transferred an acute appendicitis case to a Navy PBY Catalina on 1 October; then resumed her original mission. On 5 October, she was in the Gilberts and two days later was off Tarawa where she attempted to sink a tanker as it emerged from the lagoon. The &quot;fish&quot;, however, exploded on the reef and &quot;S-38&quot; was forced to clear the area as the Japanese sent both aerial and surface antisubmarine forces into the action. By midnight, the submarine was patrolling the Makin-Tarawa traffic lane, and, on 10 October, she completed her reconnaissance mission at Makin and headed for Pearl Harbor.

====1943–1944====
From Hawaii, &quot;S-38&quot; went to San Diego, California, arriving on 6 November. Overhaul followed. Her engines, motors, and all auxiliary equipment were removed and completely overhauled; the superstructure was modified to reduce her silhouette, air conditioning and new radar, sound, and radio equipment were installed, and a four-inch (102 mm)/fifty caliber gun replaced her three-inch. On 13 April 1943, she completed overhaul; and, on 15 April, she sailed west.

The next day, &quot;S-38&quot; began suffering mechanical breakdowns again, and, on 29 April, she arrived at Pearl Harbor. Repairs took her into June. Tests followed and, on 26 June, she again moved west to the Marshall Islands where she conducted her last war patrol which, although scoreless and plagued by mechanical failures, was successful in gaining photographs of Japanese activity on future target islands.

On 22 July, &quot;S-38&quot; set a course for the New Hebrides; and, on 27 July, she arrived at Espiritu Santo to commence antisubmarine warfare training duties. With only two interruptions, she remained in the New Hebrides-New Caledonia area on that duty into the summer of 1944. At 10:17 on 16 August 1944, a U.S. Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bomber from the escort carrier mistook &quot;S-38&quot; for a Japanese submarine about ahead of the &quot;White Plains&quot; task unit while &quot;S-38&quot; was conducting antisubmarine warfare exercises near Espiritu Santo with two SBD Dauntless dive bombers and the yard patrol boat . The TBM dropped two depth charges as &quot;S-38&quot; crash-dived. The first depth charge detonated close aboard as &quot;S-38&quot; passed , causing &quot;S-38&quot; to lose all power temporarily. &quot;S-38&quot; claimed that the second exploded as she resurfaced, while the TBM pilot reported that it did not detonate.

On 27 August 1944, &quot;S-38&quot; departed Espiritu Santo for California; and, on 7 September, she arrived at San Diego. The following month, she was ordered inactivated.

==Fate==
&quot;S-38&quot; was decommissioned on 14 December 1944, struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 January 1945, and expended as a target by aerial bombing on 20 February 1945.

<doc id="1062049" wikidata="Q4868486" url="?curid=1062049" title="Bat and trap">
<text>Bat and trap is an English bat-and-ball pub game. It is still played in Kent, and occasionally in Brighton. By the late 20th century it was usually only played on Good Friday in Brighton, on the park called The Level, which has an adjacent pub called The Bat and Ball, whose sign depicts the game. Brighton &amp; Hove City Council started a Bat and Trap club based at The Level in 2013, as part of the Activities Plan associated with a £2.2m Heritage Lottery Fund and Big Lottery Fund-funded restoration of the park.

The game is played between two teams of up to eight players. At any one time, one team is batting and the other is bowling. The game involves placing a heavy solid-rubber ball, similar to a lacrosse ball, on one end of a &quot;trap&quot;, which is a low wooden box long, 5 inches wide, and high, on top of which is a simple see-saw mechanism. Each player in turn on the batting side hits the opposite end of the see-saw lever (the &quot;striker&quot;) with his or her bat, so as to propel the ball into the air, and then, using the same bat, attempts to hit the ball between two high posts situated away and apart at the other end of the playing area, or &quot;pitch&quot;.

The bowling side stand behind and between the posts. If any of them catches the ball before it hits the ground the batsman is out. The batsman is also out if he or she fails to hit the ball between the posts at a height not exceeding . After each successful hit, one fielder (the one whose turn it is to bowl next), returns the ball to the batting end by hurling, tossing, or bowling it back towards the trap, attached to the front of which is a square target, or &quot;wicket&quot;, hinged at the bottom. If the bowler hits the wicket with the ball so as to knock it flat, the batsman is &quot;bowled out&quot;. If the bowler does not succeed, the batsman scores one run and continues to play. Once all the members of the first batting team are out, the batting and bowling teams change places and the game continues until all players on both sides have batted.

==American version==
In the American rules of bat and trap, there are several differences in the equipment and game mechanics as well as the layout of the pitch. Each team is limited to 4 players. The trap is 6 inches by 6 inches, and it has a yellow background with a black &quot;X&quot; mark across the front. The posts are 1–2 feet high. There are two additional lines, one of which extends across the field at a right angle 10 yards in front of the trap; this line is the &quot;foul line&quot;. Balls put into play must not touch the ground prior to hitting this line or the batter is called out. In addition, there is an additional line 5 yards behind the posts; this line is known as the &quot;back line&quot;, and fair hit balls that cross the line, either before touching a fielder or after, or on the ground or in the air but below the imaginary line demarcating the fair zone, score four runs for the batting side. This is known as a &quot;four&quot;, and the fielding team does not have the opportunity to roll out the batter following a four. Since the posts are only 1–2 feet, the top of the fair hit zone is demarcated by an imaginary line running from the top of the tallest fielding player&#x27;s head. Batted balls that travel above this imaginary line are automatically out.

<doc id="1062051" wikidata="Q1206714" url="?curid=1062051" title="Cantina">
<text>A cantina is a type of bar common in Latin America and Spain. The word is similar in etymology to &quot;canteen&quot;, and is derived from the Italian word for a cellar, winery, or vault. 
In Italy, the word &quot;cantina&quot; refers to a room below the ground level where wine and other products such as salami are stored.

As &quot;cantine&quot; it was used to refer to the shop of a sutler, an army camp follower.

==Types of cantinas== 
===Spain===
In Spain, a &quot;cantina&quot; is a bar located in a train station or any establishment located at or near a where food and drinks are served.

&quot;Cantina&quot; was one of the foreign words that entered in from Renaissance Italy. During the 16th century, the Spanish Empire included large holdings in Italy. Luis de Bávia wrote in his &quot;Tercera y Cuarta Parte de la Historia Pontifical y Católica&quot; (1621): &quot;Perdiéndose en las cantinas y lugares baxos [sic] gran número de mercaderías...&quot; (&quot;Losing itself in the cantinas and places of ill repute a large quantity of merchandise...&quot;).

The cantina features in one of the sonnets of Francisco de Quevedo (1580-1645). This is a quatrain from that sonnet:

===Mexico===
In rural Mexico, a &quot;cantina&quot; traditionally is a kind of bar frequented by males for drinking alcohol and eating &quot;botanas&quot; (appetizers). Some &quot;cantinas&quot; are also known for being places where people gather to play dominoes, cards or other table games. Cantinas can often be distinguished by signs that expressly prohibit entrance to women and minors, as opposed to a &quot;club&quot;, &quot;salon de bailar&quot; (dance hall), or &quot;salon de mariachi&quot; (typified by the Salon Tenampa, at the Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City) which are intended for socializing between the sexes. Also, some cantinas explicitly prohibit entrance to dogs and men in police or military uniform. Some of the traditional restrictions on entry to cantinas are beginning to fade away. However, in many areas it is still viewed as scandalous for proper ladies to be seen visiting a genuine &quot;cantina&quot;.
===Angola===

Specifically In the &quot;musseques&quot; (Rural Areas) a &quot;cantina&quot; traditionally is a corner shop or bar frequented by the locals where they drink alcohol and eat &quot;petiscos&quot; (appetizers). Some &quot;cantinas&quot; in Angola are places where people gather to dance or play games. 

===United States===
A cantina in the U.S. is simply a tavern with a Southwestern or Mexican motif that serves traditional alcoholic Mexican drinks. In the 1890s, &quot;cantina&quot; entered American English from the Spanish language in the Southwest United States with the meaning of &quot;bar room, saloon&quot;.

=== Other ===
The term &quot;cantina&quot; entered the French language circa 1710.

<text>Naked Eyes are an English new wave duo that rose to prominence in the early 1980s. The band had four US top 40 singles.

The group&#x27;s first hit, &quot;Always Something There to Remind Me&quot;, is a cover of the Burt Bacharach/Hal David standard. The band had subsequent hits with more of their own compositions: &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot;, and &quot;(What) In the Name of Love&quot;.

==History==
Naked Eyes was formed by Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher. The two had formerly been part of a band called Neon, with future members of Tears for Fears.

The debut album &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; was produced by Tony Mansfield, along with the follow-up album &quot;Fuel for the Fire&quot;, which also featured two titles produced by Arthur Baker. Their second and third singles, &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; (the 12&quot; mix of which features vocals from Madonna) and &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot;, were also hit singles in the United States.

Following the release of the band&#x27;s second album, Byrne moved to California. He performed on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot;, sang backgrounds with Rita Coolidge and Princess Stephanie, and wrote and produced for the Olsen twins. Fisher also explored other projects, doing sessions in London and forming Climie Fisher with Simon Climie.

The group never toured due to the technical difficulties of recreating their studio sound in concert. 

Rob Fisher died on 25 August 1999, age 42, following surgery for bowel cancer.

Byrne released a solo album &quot;The Real Illusion&quot; in 2001, which featured some of the last tracks he wrote with Fisher for a proposed third Naked Eyes album. In 2005, Byrne put a band together to play Naked Eyes shows, and has been touring regularly since. In 2007, Naked Eyes released &quot;Fumbling with the Covers&quot;, an acoustic album which consisted of covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Elvis Costello, among others, along with the Naked Eyes hits.

In the summer of 2008, Naked Eyes completed a US tour along with Belinda Carlisle, ABC and the Human League. Naked Eyes did a US tour with the Go-Go&#x27;s, Scandal and the Motels in 2014 and has been touring each summer since; Naked Eyes&#x27; 2020 tour was postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19 related restrictions.

On 8 June 2021, Naked Eyes released its latest album, &quot;Disguise the Limit&quot;.

In 2024, Naked Eyes toured as part of the Abducted by the 80&#x27;s tour across the US and Canada with fellow 80&#x27;s acts Wang Chung, Men Without Hats, and The Motels.

<text>The Atherton Tableland is a fertile plateau, which is part of the Great Dividing Range in Queensland, Australia. It has very deep, rich basaltic soils and the main industry is agriculture. The principal river flowing across the plateau is the Barron River, which was dammed to form the irrigation reservoir named Lake Tinaroo. Unlike many other rural areas, the Tablelands is experiencing a significant growth in population.

==Physiography==
This area is a distinct physiographic section of the larger North Queensland Highlands province, which in turn is part of the larger East Australian Cordillera physiographic division. South of the Tablelands is the Bellenden Ker Range.

=== Geological history ===
Around 100 million years ago, the eastern edge of the Australian continent extended much further to the east, before tectonic forces fractured the eastern margin, pulling it apart. At the same time, slowly rising mantle material caused a doming up of the continental crust. As the eastern part of the continent broke away, it gradually sank below sea level. Since that time, the uplifted western portion has been slowly eroding westwards, creating the abrupt Great Escarpment, which separates the coastal plain to the east from the uplifted tablelands to the west.

Between 4 million to less than 10,000 years ago, a series of volcanic eruptions occurred over the Atherton Tableland. The oldest eruptions created large, gently sloping &#x27;shield volcanoes&#x27; that produced extensive basalt flows. These flows filled the pre-existing valleys, producing a relatively flat tableland surface, instead of the more dissected landscape that existed previously. Around one million years ago, the style of eruption changed. The lavas became more gas-charged, throwing fragmented lava into the air, which built the numerous, small scoria cones such as the Seven Sisters, near Yungaburra. Some of the rising magma interacted with groundwater, producing violent eruptions that led to the formation of maar volcanoes, such as Lake Eacham and Lake Barrine. Although all the volcanoes in the Atherton Basalt Province are regarded as being extinct and volcanism has been waning over time, given the relatively recent activity, it is possible that further eruptions could occur in the future.

==History==
The Atherton Tableland has a long history of Indigenous occupation. Aspects of traditional Aboriginal land use and culture have been documented from the period of first contact to present. Aboriginal people with ties to the region seek to maintain their culture today, despite a long period of forced removal from their lands following European occupation in the late 19th-early 20th century.

&quot;Yidinji&quot; (also known as &quot;Yidinj&quot;, &quot;Yidiny&quot;, and &quot;Idindji&quot;) is a local Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional region is within the local government areas of Cairns Region and Tablelands Region, in such localities as Cairns, Gordonvale, and the Mulgrave River, and the southern part of the Atherton Tableland including Atherton and Kairi.

Dyirbal (also known as Djirbal) is a language of Far North Queensland, particularly the area around Tully and Tully River Catchment extending to the Atherton Tablelands. The Dyirbal language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Cassowary Coast Regional Council and Tablelands Regional Council.

The first European exploration of this area, was undertaken in 1875 by James Venture Mulligan. Mulligan and his party were led by Aboriginal guides. Mulligan was prospecting for gold, but instead found tin. In 1879, John Atherton and his party settled with their cattle near the town which now bears his name. Atherton Creek is also named after John Atherton.

The town of Herberton was established on 19 April 1880 by John Newell to exploit the tin find, and mining began on 9 May. Later that year, Herberton had a population of 300 men and 27 women. At its apogee, Herberton was the richest tin mining field in Australia, and was home to 17 pubs, 2 local newspapers and a brewery.

In the late 19th century, the Mulligan Highway was built through the hills from Herberton and passed through what is now Main Street, Atherton, before continuing down to Port Douglas. This road was used by the coaches of Cobb and Co to access Western Queensland.

In the Second World War, Australian troops were camped around the district prior to being sent to the front and then again on their return. Many soldiers were interred at the war cemetery in Atherton.

===Industry===
The construction of a dray road through the Tableland brought a secondary rush of settlement after the mining rush, this time timber cutters. Redcedar cutters camps were at Rocky Creek, Prior Pocket, Oonda Swamp (Carrington) &amp; Ziggenbein&#x27;s Pocket. Tree species used for the timber industry include red cedar, kauri, maple, black bean, walnut, white beech and red tulip oak.

As part of the mining and timber booms a large population of Chinese-Australians moved into the Atherton Tableland region. In addition to mining and timber, the Chinese population took up agriculture. They grew fruit and vegetable crops and were some of the first to grow maize in north Queensland. As the community grew they also built a temple to worship at, the Hou Wang Temple. The temple remains standing today and was added to the Queensland State Heritage Register in 1992.
Agriculture is now the largest industry in the Tablelands Regional Council area. Crops grown in and around Atherton include banana, sugarcane, corn/maize, avocados, strawberries, macadamia nuts and mangoes and citrus. Tobacco was also grown until when it was ended by a Government buyout. Dairying, grazing and poultry are also present on the Tableland. Dairying was once the backbone of local industry in the region, with hundreds of dairy farms dotting the landscape. The deregulation of the dairy industry in 2000 is blamed for the decline.

===Tourism===
Tourism is the second largest economic driver of the Atherton Tablelands economy, with Tinaroo Dam and extensive trail network being the focal point.

==Towns==
Atherton and Mareeba are the largest towns in the area. Herberton, Kairi, Kuranda, Malanda, Millaa Millaa, Tinaroo, Tolga, Yungaburra, Chillagoe, Walkamin and Ravenshoe are also located on the Atherton Tablelands.

==Environment==

The tableland contains several small remnants of the rainforest which once covered it, many of which are now protected in national parks. It is classified by BirdLife International as one of Australia&#x27;s Important Bird Areas, supporting over 1% of the world population of the sarus crane and a significant population of the bush stone-curlew. Twelve species of birds are endemic to this area and the mountain ranges immediately south: Atherton scrubwren, Bower&#x27;s shrikethrush, bridled honeyeater, chowchilla, fernwren, golden bowerbird, grey-headed robin, Macleay&#x27;s honeyeater, mountain thornbill, pied monarch, tooth-billed bowerbird and Victoria&#x27;s riflebird.

<text>Ilex vomitoria, commonly known as yaupon () or yaupon holly, is a species of holly that is native to southeastern North America. The word yaupon was derived from the Catawban &quot;yą́pą&quot;, from &quot;yą-&quot; tree + &quot;pą&quot; leaf. Another common name, cassina, was borrowed from Timucua (despite this, it usually refers to &quot;Ilex cassine&quot;). The Latin name comes from an observation by early Europeans that the ingestion of the plant was followed by vomiting in certain ceremonies.

The plant was traditionally used by Native Americans and Euro-American colonists to make an infusion containing caffeine and theobromine. This drink went by different names, such as cassina, beloved drink, or white drink among natives and &quot;Carolina tea&quot;, or &quot;South Seas tea&quot; among colonists. It is only one of two known plants endemic to North America that produce caffeine. The other (containing 80% less) is &quot;Ilex cassine&quot;, commonly known as dahoon holly. Recently, the plant has begun to be harvested for making commercial tea once again in the United States.

Yaupon is also widely used for landscaping in its native range.

==Description==
Yaupon holly is an evergreen shrub or small tree reaching 5–9 m tall, with smooth, light gray bark and slender, hairy shoots. The leaf arrangement is alternate, with leaves ovate to elliptical and a rounded apex with crenate or coarsely serrated margin, 1–4.5 cm long and 1–2 cm broad, glossy dark green above, slightly paler below. The flowers are 5–5.5 mm diameter, with a white four-lobed corolla. The fruit is a small round, shiny, and red (occasionally yellow) drupe 4–6 mm diameter containing four pits, which are dispersed by birds eating the fruit. The species may be distinguished from the similar &quot;Ilex cassine&quot; by its smaller leaves with a rounded, not acute apex.

==Habitat and range==
&quot;I. vomitoria&quot; occurs in the United States from the Eastern Shore of Virginia south to Florida and west to Oklahoma and Texas. A disjunct population occurs in the Mexican state of Chiapas. It generally occurs in coastal areas in well-drained, sandy soils, and can be found on the upper edges of brackish and salt marshes, sandy hammocks, coastal sand dunes, inner-dune depressions, sandhills, maritime forests, nontidal forested wetlands, well-drained forests, and pine flatwoods.

==Ecology==

The fruit are an important food for many birds, including Florida duck, American black duck, mourning dove, ruffed grouse, bobwhite quail, wild turkey, northern flicker, sapsuckers, cedar waxwing, eastern bluebird, American robin, gray catbird, northern mockingbird, and white-throated sparrow. Mammals that eat the fruit include nine-banded armadillo, American black bear, gray fox, raccoon, and skunk. The foliage and twigs are browsed by white-tailed deer.

==Cultivation and uses==
===Human consumption===

Some Native American tribes brew the leaves and stems to create an herbal tea, commonly called black drink. Historically, the ceremonial consumption often included vomiting, and Europeans deduced that yaupon caused it (hence the Latin name - &quot;Ilex vomitoria&quot;). The active ingredients, like those of the related yerba mate and guayusa plants, are caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline; the vomiting may have resulted from the great quantities in which they drank the beverage, coupled with fasting.

Native Americans may have also used the infusion as a laxative. &quot;Ilex vomitoria&quot; usage by colonists for tea making and for medicinal uses in the Carolinas is documented by the early 18th century. In the English-speaking colonies, it was known variously as cassina, yaupon tea, Indian tea, Carolina tea, and Appalachian tea. Recently, the process of drying the leaves for consumption has been adopted by modern Americans, and yaupon is now commercially available.

===Ornamental===
&quot;Ilex vomitoria&quot; is a common landscape plant in the Southeastern United States. The most common cultivars are slow-growing shrubs popular for their dense, evergreen foliage and their adaptability to pruning into hedges of various shapes. These include:
* &#x27;Folsom Weeping&#x27; – weeping cultivar
* &#x27;Grey&#x27;s Littleleaf&#x27;/&#x27;Grey&#x27;s Weeping&#x27; – weeping cultivar
* &#x27;Nana&#x27;/&#x27;Compacta&#x27; – dwarf female clone usually remaining below 1 m in height
* &#x27;Pride of Houston&#x27; – female clone similar to type but featuring improvements in form, fruiting, and foliage
* &#x27;Schilling&#x27;s Dwarf&#x27;/&#x27;Stokes Dwarf&#x27; – dwarf male clone that grows no more than 0.6 m tall and 1.2 m wide
* &#x27;Will Fleming&#x27; – male clone featuring a columnar growth habit
* &#x27;Pendula&#x27; – &quot;weeping&quot; variety, has the highest caffeine content

<doc id="1062071" wikidata="Q976045" url="?curid=1062071" title="Kazimierz Siemienowicz">
<text>Kazimierz Siemienowicz (, ; was a Polish general of artillery, gunsmith, military engineer, and one of pioneers of rocketry. Born in the Raseiniai region of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, he served in the armies of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, the ruler of the Dutch Republic. No portrait or detailed biography of him has survived and much of his life is a subject of dispute.

After contributing his expertise to several battles, Siemienowicz published &quot;Artis Magnae Artilleriae&quot; in 1650. This treatise, which discusses rocketry and pyrotechnics, remained a standard work in those fields for two centuries.

==Early life==
===Polish school===
The Polish school describes his identity simply as member of the szlachta (i.e., nobility in the Commonwealth) from Grand Duchy. Some sources use the term &quot;Polish,&quot; others describe him as &quot;Lithuanian&quot;. Those terms should be understood in proper context: &quot;Polish&quot; means &quot;of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&quot;; &quot;Lithuanian&quot; from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, a federal part of the Commonwealth. Polish historian professor Tadeusz Marian Nowak described Siemienowicz as a Polonized Lithuanian nobleman. Polish historians acknowledge that he used the Ostoja Coat of Arms and that he was an alumnus of the Academy of Wilno.

===Lithuanian school===
Lithuanian literature asserts that he was Lithuanian. He was born near Raseiniai in Samogitia. The family, who was relatively poor, bore the Ostoja Coat of Arms with military service traditions in the Grand Duchy. Siemenowicz was educated in the Academy of Wilno.

===Belarusian school===
The Belarusian school asserts that he was born in the vicinity of Dubrowna in the Viciebsk land, to a family of minor Ruthenian princes (&quot;knyaz&quot;) of Siemienowicz, who possessed the small tracts of land in that part of the Belarusian Dnieper-land (&quot;Падняпроўе&quot;) in the 14th–17th centuries. Some examples of lexicography used by K. Siemienowicz support this interpretation.

There are no records of families with the surname Siemienowicz having the right to bear the Ostoja coat of arms and it is possible that Siemienowicz acquired the right to use the image of Ostoja in his book to facilitate its circulation.

==Military career==
As Siemienowicz wrote, he was fascinated by artillery since childhood, and he studied many sciences to increase his knowledge (mathematics, mechanics, hydraulics, architecture, optics, tactics). In 1632–1634 he took part in the Smolensk War, in the Siege of Belaya under Mikołaj Abramowicz (who in 1640 became the first Lithuanian General of Artillery). It is possible that in 1644 he took part in the Battle of Ochmatów.

He spent some time in the Netherlands, where he was sent by the King Władysław IV Vasa to serve in the army of Duke Frederick Henry of Orange during the war with Spain; he participated in the Siege of Hulst in 1645. In 1646 he returned to Poland when Władysław created the Polish artillery corps and gathered specialists from Europe, planning a war with Ottoman Empire. He served as an engineering expert in the fields of artillery and rocketry in the royal artillery forces. From 1648 he served as Second in Command of the Polish Royal Artillery.

In late 1648 the newly elected king John II Casimir Vasa, who had no plans for the war with Ottomans, advised him to return to the Netherlands and publish his studies there. There are rumors that in 1649 Siemienowicz became embroiled in a conflict with General of the Artillery Krzysztof Arciszewski over a bureaucratic matter; around 1649 he decided to leave the Commonwealth and work on his book in Amsterdam.

===Stance on poison gas===
Siemienowicz considered the use of poison gases dishonorable. In his work, he wrote:&quot;and most of all, they shall not construct any poisoned globes, nor other sorts of pyrobolic inventions, in which he shall introduce no poison whatsoever, besides which, they shall never employ them for the ruin and destruction of men, because the first inventors of our art thought such actions as unjust among themselves as unworthy of a man of heart and a real soldier&quot;.

===Use of biowarfare===
In a historically early instance of biowarfare, Siemienowicz sponsored the firing of artillery containing the saliva of rabid dogs during a 1650 battle. While the success of this experiment is unknown, it demonstrated an educated guess about the disease&#x27;s communicability that was not confirmed until the 18th century. It was popular in ancient warfare to catapult a deadly disease by using an infected cadaver or its parts to the enemy. One of the most notable examples was Genghis Khan&#x27;s war against besieged Chinese cities, where he catapulted dead bodies infected with plague into cities.

==&quot;Artis Magnae Artilleriae&quot;==
In 1650 Siemienowicz published a notable work, &quot;Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima&quot; (Great Art of Artillery, the First Part). Its name implies a second part, and it is rumored that he wrote its manuscript before his death. It is also rumored that he was killed by members of the metallurgy/gunsmith/pyrotechnics guilds, who were opposed to him publishing a book about their secrets, and that they hid or destroyed the manuscript of the second part. Guilds aggressively protecting their production secrets was widespread in these times, as we can see from James Stirling having to flee Venice in 1725 for fear of being assassinated after finding out a trade secret of the glassmakers of Venice. Siemienowicz disparaged what he saw as a culture of secrecy based on &quot;canting Alchymists of the times Past...they dealed in nothing but Smoke, yet arrogantly took upon them to be Professors of so noble and excellent an art as Chymistry.&quot;

&quot;Artis Magnae Artilleriae pars prima&quot; was first printed in Amsterdam in 1650, was translated to French in 1651, German in 1676, English and Dutch in 1729, and Polish in 1963.
In the first part of his work he wrote that the second one would contain the &quot;universal pyrotechnic invention, containing all of our current knowledge.&quot; According to his short description, this invention was supposed to greatly ease all measurements and calculations.

For over two centuries this work was used in Europe as a basic artillery manual / handbook. Its pyrotechnic formulations were used for over a century. The book provided the standard designs for creating rockets, fireballs, and other pyrotechnic devices. It discussed for the first time the idea of applying a reactive technique to artillery (rocket artillery). It contains a large chapter on caliber, construction, production and properties of rockets for both military and civil purposes, including multistage rockets, batteries of rockets, and rockets with delta wing stabilisers (instead of the common guiding rods). It was the first book in the world to systematically present knowledge about the development of multistage rockets and rocket artillery.

<text>Chilton Foliat is a village and civil parish on the River Kennet in Wiltshire, England. The parish is in the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is on the county boundary with West Berkshire and is about northwest of the Berkshire market town of Hungerford.

The village is on the B4192 Hungerford-Swindon road, which was the A419 until 1977, when it was redesignated after the opening of the M4 motorway. The parish includes the hamlets of Straight Soley and Crooked Soley.

== History ==
The ancient parish of Chilton Foliat straddled the Wiltshire/Berkshire border. In 1895 the Berkshire portion, including the village of Leverton and the Chilton Lodge estate, was transferred to Hungerford civil parish.

Chilton Aircraft, a small manufacturer in the 1930s and 1940s, had its factory within the Chilton Lodge estate.

From the estate of Lady Ward at Chilton Foliat, in 1942 U.S Army paratroopers trained with their British counterparts and deployed to combat in North Africa.

== Religious sites ==

The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary dates from c. 1300. Restoration by Benjamin Ferrey in 1845 included the addition of a south aisle. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1966.

The churchyard has an early 19th-century mausoleum to the Pearse family, designed by William Pilkington and described by Pevsner as &quot;heaviest Grecian&quot;.

The church was the location of the 2008 memorial service for Gerald Ward, godfather to Prince Harry; the service was attended by the Prince with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.

A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built in 1796, enlarged in 1932 and closed in 1988. The building is now a private
house.

== Notable buildings ==
Houses in the village include Vine Cottage, from the late 17th century. The Old Rectory, close to the church, is from the mid 18th century. Bridge House carries a date of 1766 but incorporates earlier work.

The gateway leading to Chilton Lodge, and part of its parkland, are within the parish. The house itself, built in 1800 and Grade II* listed, is now in West Berkshire. It replaced an earlier house on the Wiltshire side of the county boundary, which was demolished. Chilton Park Farm, a house in neo-Georgian style, was built on that site in 1940; nearby is an early 18th-century barn. The Chilton estate is owned by Sarah Scrope, heiress to Sir John and Lady Ward.

Littlecote House, a Grade I listed country house completed in 1592, now a hotel and leisure centre, is upstream on the other site of the Kennet in Ramsbury parish. Part of its estate is in Chilton Foliat parish.

==Notable residents==
Littlecote House was the seat of Sir Ernest Salter Wills, 3rd Baronet of Hazelwood, a member of the Wills tobacco family dynasty.

Auberon Waugh lived at the Old Rectory from 1964 to 1971.

Max Hastings, journalist, historian and author, lives here.

==Amenities==
The village has a public house, the &quot;Wheatsheaf&quot; (in an early 19th-century thatched house) and a village hall (dating from 1895).

A Church of England primary school serves Chilton Foliat and nearby villages. A National School opened in 1835, and in 1847 moved to the north side of the main street. In 1970 the school moved to a new building at Stag Hill.

Much of the Kennet floodplain within the parish has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), owing to the presence of the rare Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail. An area of watermeadow southwest of the village, Chilton Foliat Meadows, is also an SSSI for its diverse flora and variety of birds.

==Television appearances==
The 1987 BBC Television programme &quot;The Victorian Kitchen Garden&quot;, featuring head gardener Harry Dodson (1919–2005), was filmed at Chilton Lodge which lies between Chilton Foliat and the Berkshire hamlet of Leverton.

Chilton Foliat is referred to in the 2001 HBO series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; as the location where Captain Herbert Sobel was sent to train non-combat military support personnel who needed paratrooper training.

<doc id="1062080" wikidata="Q1664161" url="?curid=1062080" title="Innoko River">
<text>The Innoko River (; (Deg Xinag: &quot;Yooniq&quot;) is a tributary of the Yukon River in the U.S. state of Alaska. It flows north from its origin south of Cloudy Mountain in the Kuskokwim Mountains and then southwest to meet the larger river across from Holy Cross.

Most of its upper portion flows through the Innoko National Wildlife Refuge. The entire river is within the Yukon–Koyukuk Census Area.

Innoko is a Deg Hit’an name for the river. The Russian colonial administrators also called the river &quot;Shiltonotno&quot;, &quot;Legon&quot; or &quot;Tlegon&quot;, &quot;Chagelyuk&quot; or &quot;Shageluk&quot; and &quot;Ittege&quot; at various times in the 19th century.

<doc id="1062107" wikidata="Q158120" url="?curid=1062107" title="Briza">
<text>Briza is a genus of annual and perennial plants in the grass family, native to northern temperate regions of Eurasia, North Africa, and certain islands in the Atlantic.

The group is generally referred to as the quaking grasses because the flowers and seedheads shake on their stalks in the slightest breeze. Some of its members are grown as ornamental plants.

&quot;Briza&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including &quot;Coleophora lixella&quot;.

;Species
* &quot;Briza humilis&quot; – from Albania to Iran
* &quot;Briza marcowiczii&quot; – Turkey, Caucasus
* &quot;Briza maxima&quot; – Mediterranean, Azores, Madeira, Canary Islands; naturalized in parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and certain oceanic islands
* &quot;Briza media&quot; – Europe, Asia, North Africa, Azores, Canary Islands; naturalized in New Zealand and parts of North America
* &quot;Briza minor&quot; – from Azores + Canary Islands to Iran; naturalized in parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, the Americas, and certain oceanic islands

Over 100 species formerly included in &quot;Briza&quot; are now placed in other genera, including &quot;Agrostis&quot;, &quot;Airopsis&quot;, &quot;Chascolytrum&quot;, &quot;Desmazeria&quot;, &quot;Desmostachya&quot;, &quot;Distichlis&quot;, &quot;Eragrostis&quot;, &quot;Glyceria&quot;, &quot;Halopyrum&quot;, &quot;Neesiochloa&quot;, &quot;Poa&quot;, &quot;Tribolium&quot;, &quot;Trisetum&quot; and &quot;Uniola&quot;.

== Folklore ==
In certain Scottish folklore, a patch of briza, dawdle, or quaking grass indicated the location&#x27;s previous use in fairy dancing (similar to a fairy ring). The passerby who walks through the tainted grass was said to come down with an immediate drowsiness, worsening to the point of death. Through the action of cursing the victim, quaking grass is similar to hungry grass, both falling under the category of fairy grass.

<doc id="1062110" wikidata="Q634285" url="?curid=1062110" title="Dunnington">
<text>Dunnington is a village and civil parish in the City of York and ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. The population of the civil parish was 3,230 at the 2011 census. The village is approximately east from York city centre. The parish includes the hamlet of Grimston.

The village was historically part of the East Riding of Yorkshire until 1974. It was then a part of the Selby District in North Yorkshire from 1974 until 1996. Since 1996 it has been part of the City of York unitary authority.

==History==

Dunnington village was an Anglo-Saxon settlement, and was listed in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Donniton&quot;, which, according to &quot;Mills&quot;, translates as an &quot;estate associated with a man called Dun(n)a&quot;. The fields around the village became the country&#x27;s major area for growing chicory. On 1 April 1935 the civil parish of Grimston was abolished and merged with Dunnington.

Between 1913 and 1926 Dunnington was served by passenger trains on the Derwent Valley Light Railway, and the remaining goods-only railway was withdrawn in stages following the Beeching Axe. Steam trains ran to Dunnington on this line between 1977 and 1979, but following the closure of a crop drying facility the last tracks covering the route to York via Murton and Osbaldwick were lifted.

In 2006 Dunnington published a village design statement (VDS) as part of a national scheme introduced by the Countryside Commission in 1996. This describes the history, visual characteristics and local setting of the village and surrounding landscape. The VDS forms part of the Parish Plan.

Dunnington was the category winner in the small town category (for settlements with population over 3,000) of the 2014 Britain in Bloom competition.

The original Victorian village school was demolished, but a doctors&#x27; surgery building that sits on the site was built using a complementary construction style and reclaimed materials.

==Community==

The village has a historic centre, part of which is a conservation area.

According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 3,194. Before 1996 it had been part of the Selby district, and before 1974 the East Riding of Yorkshire.

Dunnington is connected to York by the A1079 York to Hull, and the A166 York to Bridlington roads. The village is on the FirstGroup bus company&#x27;s number 10 route through York as well as East Yorkshire Motor Services number 45 route which runs from Bridlington to York.

A monthly magazine for the village and neighbouring communities, &quot;The Grapevine&quot;, is published by the local church, and contains news from village organisations and feature articles.

Since 2017 Dunnington has had an online community network—known as &quot;This is Dunnington&quot;—for communicating, sharing and commenting on events, news, developments and activities in the parish and village.

Recreational areas within or around Dunnington are Hagg Wood, Hassacarr Nature Reserve, Julia&#x27;s Memorial Garden and a play park. Hassacarr Nature Reserve has attracted some 5,000 visitors over the past 20 years, and has recently been awarded Local Nature Reserve status.

Dunnington has one public house— The Cross Keys. Dunnington Sports Club is also open as a bar. The village also has a library, a doctors&#x27; surgery, a dental practice and a reading room at the Village Hall. The village school is Dunnington C of E Primary School.

Dunnington retains a small independent retail area mainly in and around York Street. Services include a newsagent, florist, hairdressers, a beauty salon, fast food, a bistro and a bakery. On the location of the old Dunnington railway station, the modern industrial estate is the home of wide range of light industrial businesses and services.

The Grade: II* listed St Nicholas&#x27; Church dates in part from the late 11th century with later additions and alterations to the 19th, when it was rebuilt by C. Hodgson Fowler.

Village sport facilities include those for bowls, cricket, football, tennis, squash, and ladies hockey. There is also a gymnasium.

<text>Sir Hari Singh (September 1895 – 26 April 1961) was the last ruling Maharaja of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir of the Dogra dynasty.

Hari Singh was the son of Amar Singh and Bhotiali Chib. In 1923, following his uncle&#x27;s death, Singh became the new Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. After Indian Independence in 1947, Singh wanted Jammu and Kashmir to remain as an independent kingdom. He was required to accede to the Dominion of India to get the support of Indian troops against an invasion by tribal armed men and the Pakistan Army into his state. Singh remained the titular Maharaja of the state until 1952, when the monarchy was abolished by the Indian government. After spending his final days in Bombay, he died on 26 April 1961.

Singh was a controversial ruler. He faced an agitation in Kashmir in 1931 and successful rebellions in Poonch. He is accused of being complicit in 1947 Jammu massacres. 

==Early life==
Hari Singh was born in the Dogra Rajput royal family on September 1895 at the Amar Mahal, Palace, Jammu. He was the only surviving son of Raja Amar Singh, the brother of Maharaja Pratap Singh, then the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. Since the Maharaja had no issue, Hari Singh was heir presumptive to the throne of Jammu and Kashmir.

In 1903, Hari Singh served as a page of honour to Lord Curzon at the grand Delhi Durbar. At the age of 13, he was sent to Mayo College in Ajmer. A year later, in 1909, his father died and the British took a keen interest in his education, appointing Major H. K. Barr as his guardian. After Mayo College, Hari Singh went to the British-run Imperial Cadet Corps at Dehradun for military training.

He was appointed the commander-in-chief of the State Forces in 1915 by Maharaja Pratap Singh.

==Reign==

Following the death of his uncle Pratap Singh on 23 September 1925, Hari Singh served as the second Prime Minister (1925–1926) of Jammu and Kashmir. Hari Singh ascended the throne of Jammu and Kashmir in February 1926 under British intervention, who overruled Pratap Singh&#x27;s choice of an adopted son, Raja Jagat Dev Singh of Poonch.

Hari Singh&#x27;s coronation from 22 to 28 February 1926 was divided into two separate ceremonies - the first few days for the religious ceremonies and official programme in the latter part was set aside for hosting the European attendees.
After becoming the ruler, Hari Singh conducted free elections and formed the Praja Sabha Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly to rule with laws implemented under Ranbir Penal Code (R.P.C) which Praja Sabha decreed. In April 1932, as per recommendations of the Glancy Commission, the Praja Sabha was established, made up of 75 members – 12 government officials, 16 state councillors, 14 nominated, and 33 elected (21 Muslims, 10 Hindus and 2 Sikhs). By September 1934 the elected members started making laws under the Praja Sabha which made Jammu and Kashmir a forerunner state for other Princely Indian States. On 7 September 1939 Maharaja Hari Singh and his law and Revenue Minister, Justice Sir Lal Gopal Mukherjee, a former judge of the Allahabad high court (1926–1934) who had served the state of Jammu and Kashmir from 1935 to 1940, produced a written constitution for Jammu and Kashmir which was the &quot;pioneer&quot; in the annals of Asia&#x27;s constitutional history; despite the fact that it was anything but a people-friendly &quot;Magna Carta&quot; for the state.
He made primary education compulsory in the state, introduced laws prohibiting child marriage, and opened places of worship to low caste subjects.

In 1930, Hari Singh attended the First Round Table Conference in London. He suggested that the Indian Princely states should join an “All India Federation” and pleaded for equal status for Indians in the British Commonwealth of Nations. While replying to the inaugural address by King-Emperor George V, Hari Singh said: 

===Partition and accession===
In 1947, after India gained independence from British rule, Jammu and Kashmir had the option of joining one of the new dominions, India and Pakistan, or remaining independent. Hari Singh opted to remain independent for the immediate future since the dominions were beset with partition violence and he needed time to weigh the options in the context of his Muslim-majority population. He signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan on 14 August 1947 and urged India to do the same, but India did not comply. On 6 October 1947, he faced an armed uprising in Poonch instigated by the Muslim Conference party, followed by Pakistan-backed Pashtun tribal invasion at Muzaffarabad on 22 October 1947.

After attack Hari Singh appealed to India for help following the invasion. India&#x27;s British Governor-General, Lord Mountbatten, advised the Maharaja to accede to India before India could send its troops. The Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession on 26 October 1947, joining the princely state to the Dominion of India. India sent troops to repel the invaders, which soon evolved into the first Indo-Pakistan War.

Pressure from Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Vallabhbhai Patel eventually compelled Singh to appoint his son and heir, Yuvraj (Crown Prince) Karan Singh, as Prince Regent of Jammu and Kashmir in 1949, although he remained the titular Maharaja of the state until 1952 when the monarchy was abolished by Nehru&#x27;s government. He was also forced to appoint the popular Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah as the prime minister of Kashmir. He had a contentious relationship with both Nehru and Abdullah. Karan Singh was appointed &#x27;Sadr-e-Riyasat&#x27; (&#x27;Head of State&#x27;) in 1952 and Governor of the State in 1964.

==Final years and death==

After signing the instrument of accession with India, Hari Singh was banished from Jammu and Kashmir. He departed from Jammu on April 28, 1949, for New Delhi and never came back again, there on June 9, 1949, he signed a proclamation appointing his 18-year-old son, Yuvraj Karan Singh, as the Regent of Jammu and Kashmir, on June 20, 1949, his son arrived in Jammu as Regent, while the Maharaja left for Bombay the same day and settled there for the rest of his life. He died on 26 April 1961, after fourteen years of banishment. As per his will, his ashes were brought to Jammu and spread all over Jammu and Kashmir, and immersed in the Tawi River at Jammu.

==Personal life==
===Blackmail case===
In 1921, Singh paid £300,000 (approximately £ in today&#x27;s value) to a prostitute who blackmailed him. The issue resulted in a court case in London in 1924 during which the India Office tried to keep his name out of proceedings by arranging for him to be referred to as Mr. A. India Office in Britain decided to close the files for a hundred years rather than the usual thirty years as the case involved espionage.

===Personal wealth===
Hari Singh was known as a lavish spender of money. In the funeral of his uncle and former ruler, Pratap Singh, he is believed to have spent excessive gold and jewellery in the funeral pyre.

===Marriages===
Singh married four times as he faced disturbances in his private life. Two of his wives passed away childless and a third Rajasthani bride was sent back with honour, to her parents&#x27; house as the couple could not establish an emotional connection. Also, Hari Singh faced political and domestic conspiracies at this time and thought it appropriate to send back the third wife to safety. With his last wife, Tara Devi Sahiba of Kangra, he had a son, Karan Singh.

<text>In Persian, Turkic, Hindustani and Punjabi, the word takhallus (from Arabic , ; ; ; ; , ) means a pen name. Pen names were widely adopted by Persian, Turkic, Urdu and Punjabi poets.

The &quot;takhallus&quot; is often included in the &quot;maqta&#x27;&quot;, the last couplet (&quot;bayt&quot;) of a &quot;ghazal&quot;.

==History==
While &quot;ghazal&quot; originated in Arabia evolving from &quot;qasida&quot;, some of the common features of contemporary &quot;ghazal&quot;, such as including the &quot;takhallus&quot; in the &quot;maqta″&quot;, the concept of &quot;matla&#x27;&quot;, etc., did not exist in Arabic &quot;ghazal&quot;. It was Persian &quot;ghazal&quot; which added these features.

==Common &quot;takhallus&quot;es==
List of &quot;takhallus&quot;es of some Persian poets:
* &quot;Suman&quot;
* &quot;Hafez&quot;
* &quot;Jami&quot;

<doc id="1062129" wikidata="Q1344617" url="?curid=1062129" title="Chilia branch">
<text>The Chilia branch (; ) is one of three main distributary channels of the river Danube that contribute to forming the Danube Delta. Lying at the northernmost area of the delta, the distributary creates a natural border between Romania and Ukraine (see Romania-Ukraine border) and is named after the two towns carrying the same name, located across from one another on both banks: Kiliya, on the northern, Ukrainian bank and Chilia Veche (Old Chilia) on the southern, Romanian bank.

The other two main branches of the Danube are the Sulina branch and the Sfântu Gheorghe branch.

The Chilia branch begins at the Ismail Islet where Danube splits on Chilia branch and Sulina branch and ends near the town of Vylkove where Chilia branch splits further into Ochakove distributary (eastward) and Old Istambul distributary (southward). Chilia branch is long. The flow at the entrance into the delta is of 6,350 m3/s; the Chilia branch carries between 58 and 60 percent of this flow.

Along the Chilia branch is located the former Ottoman fortress in today&#x27;s Ukrainian city of Izmail. The fall of Izmail in 1789 led the Ottomans&#x27; loss of complete control over the northern Pontic shores (today southern Ukraine) and to the expansion the Russian Empire to this part of the Black Sea, with the continuation of struggles and warring between the Ottoman and Russian Empires.

<doc id="1062137" wikidata="Q6934944" url="?curid=1062137" title="Top-down cosmology">
<text>In theoretical physics, top-down cosmology is a proposal to regard the many possible histories of a given event as having real existence. This idea of multiple histories has been applied to cosmology, in a theoretical interpretation in which the universe has multiple possible cosmologies, and in which reasoning &quot;backwards&quot; from the current state of the universe to a quantum superposition of possible cosmic histories makes sense. Stephen Hawking has argued that the principles of quantum mechanics forbid a single cosmic history, and has proposed cosmological theories in which the lack of a past boundary condition naturally leads to multiple histories, called the &#x27;no-boundary proposal&#x27;, the proposed Hartle–Hawking state.

According to Hawking and Thomas Hertog, &quot;The top-down approach we have described leads to a profoundly different view of cosmology, and the relation between cause and effect. Top down cosmology is a framework in which one essentially traces the histories backwards, from a spacelike surface at the present time. The noboundary histories of the universe thus depend on what is being observed, contrary to the usual idea that the universe has a unique, observer independent history.&quot;

<text>The Rhizobiaceae is a family of Pseudomonadota comprising multiple subgroups that enhance and hinder plant development. Some bacteria found in the family are used for plant nutrition and collectively make up the rhizobia. Other bacteria such as &quot;Agrobacterium tumefaciens&quot; and &quot;Rhizobium rhizogenes&quot; severely alter the development of plants in their ability to induce crown galls or hairy roots, respectively. The family has been of an interest to scientists for centuries in their ability to associate with plants and modify plant development. The Rhizobiaceae are, like all Pseudomonadota, Gram-negative. They are aerobic, and the cells are usually rod-shaped. Many species of the Rhizobiaceae are diazotrophs which are able to fix nitrogen and are symbiotic with plant roots.

==Genera==
Rhizobiaceae comprises the following genera:

* &quot;Agrobacterium&quot; 
* &quot;Allorhizobium&quot; 
* &quot;Ciceribacter&quot; 

* &quot;Endobacterium&quot; 
* &quot;Ensifer&quot;

<text>The music of [[Palau]] finds its heritage in Micronesia, but it has been supplemented with influences from the United States and Western Europe, as well as Japan.

The government department of the Republic of Palau and Director of the Bureau of Arts and Culture are in charge of developing and implementing cultural policies is the Ministry of Community and Cultural Affairs.
&quot;Belau rekid&quot;, the national anthem of Palau, was written by Ymesei O. Ezekiel, and has been the anthem since 1980.

There are no intellectual property restrictions in Palau.

The modern Palauan pop music scene began in the mid-1980s . The country recorded popular sound includes element of Japanese music, legacy of a period of Japanese domination . The American influence can be heard in a distinctly Palauan form of country music. Popular performers include IN-X-ES, whose &quot;Mousubes&quot; was a major commercial success in 1999.

<doc id="1062161" wikidata="Q306026" url="?curid=1062161" title="Cairo (graphics)">
<text>Cairo (stylized as cairo) is an open-source graphics library that provides a vector graphics-based, device-independent API for software developers. It provides primitives for two-dimensional drawing across a number of different backends. Cairo uses hardware acceleration when available.

== Software architecture ==
=== Language bindings ===
A library written in one programming language may be used in another language if bindings are written; Cairo has a range of bindings for various languages including C++, C# and other CLI languages, Delphi, Eiffel, Fortran, Factor, Harbour, Haskell, Julia, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scheme, Smalltalk and several others like Gambas (Visual Basic like).

=== Toolkit bindings ===
Since Cairo is only a drawing library, it can be quite useful to integrate it with a graphical user interface toolkit.

* FLTK has full Cairo support (through codice_1 compile switch).
* GTK began in 2005, with version 2.8, to use Cairo to render the majority of its graphical control elements, and since version 3.0 all rendering is done through Cairo.
* The Cairo development team maintains up-to-date instructions for rendering surfaces to SDL.

=== Available back-ends ===
Cairo supports output (including rasterisation) to a number of different back-ends, known as &quot;surfaces&quot; in its code. Back-ends support includes output to the X Window System, via both Xlib and XCB, Win32 GDI, OS X Quartz Compositor, the BeOS API, OS/2, OpenGL contexts (directly and via glitz), local image buffers, PNG files, PDF, PostScript, DirectFB and SVG files.

There are other back-ends in development targeting the graphics APIs OpenVG, Qt, Skia, and Microsoft&#x27;s Direct2D. The BeOS, OS/2, DirectFB and OpenGL backends were dropped in 2022.

=== Drawing model ===

The Cairo drawing model relies on a three-layer model.

Any drawing process takes place in three steps:
# First a mask is created, which includes one or more vector primitives or forms, i.e., circles, squares, TrueType fonts, Bézier curves, etc.
# Then source must be defined, which may be a color, a color gradient, a bitmap or some vector graphics, and from the painted parts of this source a die cut is made with the help of the above defined mask.
# Finally the result is transferred to the destination or surface, which is provided by the back-end for the output.

This constitutes a fundamentally different approach from Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which specifies the color of shapes with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules. Whereas Cairo would create a mask of a shape, then make a source for it, and then transfer them onto the surface, an SVG file would simply specify the shape with a codice_2 attribute. That said, the models are not incompatible; many SVG renderers use Cairo for heavy lifting.

==== Example ====
Quite complex &quot;Hello world&quot; graphics can be drawn with the help of Cairo with only a few lines of source code:

== Notable usage ==
Cairo is popular in the open source community for providing cross-platform support for advanced 2D drawing.

* GTK, starting in 2005 with version 2.8, uses Cairo to render the majority of its graphical control elements. Since GTK version 3, all the rendering is done using Cairo.
** A program called found in Debian allows for taking vector (SVG, PDF, or PostScript) screenshots of GTK 3 applications.
* The Mono Project, including Moonlight, has been using Cairo since very early in conception to power the back-ends of its GDI+ (libgdiplus) and System.Drawing namespaces.
* The Mozilla project has made use of Cairo in its Gecko layout engine, used for rendering the graphical output of Mozilla products. Gecko 1.8, the layout engine for Mozilla Firefox 2.0 and SeaMonkey 1.0, used Cairo to render SVG and &lt;canvas&gt; content. Gecko 1.9, the release of Gecko that serves as the basis of Firefox 3, uses Cairo as the graphics back-end for rendering both web page content and the user interface (or &quot;chrome&quot;).
* The WebKit framework uses Cairo for all rendering in the GTK and EFL ports. Support has also been added for SVG and &lt;canvas&gt; content using Cairo.
* The Poppler library uses Cairo to render PDF documents. Cairo enables the drawing of antialiased vector graphics and transparent objects.
* The vector graphics application Inkscape uses the Cairo library for its outline mode display, as well as for PDF and PostScript export since release 0.46.
* The original version of Manim referred to as ManimCairo, a mathematical animation engine used in the animations of 3Blue1Brown&#x27;s YouTube Videos. Manim has since moved to using OpenGL. This version is referred to as ManimGL.
* MorphOS 2.5 features a shared library implementation of Cairo, which was available as stand-alone release for earlier MorphOS versions.
* AmigaOS 4.1 supports a shared object library of Cairo (libcairo.so) in its default installation.
* FontForge enabled Cairo by default for rendering in mid-October 2008.
* R can output plots in PDF, PostScript and SVG formats using Cairo if available.
* Gnuplot 4.4 now uses Cairo for rendering PDF and PNG output.
* Internet Browser for PlayStation 3 uses Cairo since system software update 4.10.
* Synfig 0.64 now supports optional Cairo rendering.
* On-demand graphing of time series data in Graphite.
* The Konfabulator/Yahoo widget engine uses Cairo for identical output to both Win32 and Quartz on Mac OS/X.
*SolveSpace, free and open source 2D and 3D CAD software.

== History ==
Keith Packard and Carl Worth founded the Cairo project for use in the X Window System. It was originally (until at least 2003) called Xr or Xr/Xc. The name was changed to emphasize the idea of a cross-platform library to access display server, not tied to the X Window System.
The name &quot;Cairo&quot; derives from the original name &quot;Xr&quot;, interpreted as the Greek letters chi and rho.
==Complex text layout==
Cairo handles Latin and CJK based fonts, but does not directly support complex text layout fonts, which require shaping the glyphs. The Cairo developers recommend using Pango, which provides complex text layout and can integrate with Cairo.

<doc id="1062162" wikidata="Q687382" url="?curid=1062162" title="Ennea">
<text>Ennea was the second album by jazz-rock band Chase. It did not repeat the commercial success of their debut album, &quot;Chase&quot;.

The original lineup from the first album was changed midway through the recording sessions, with Gary Smith taking over from Jay Burrid on drums and G. G. Shinn replacing Terry Richards on lead vocals. Sessions for the recording occurred August 31-September 8, 1971, at CBS/Columbia Studios in San Francisco and again between November 15 and December 8, 1971. According to Chase&#x27;s attorney Alex Deveince, the cost of the album went $120,000 over budget.

The six songs on side two of the album comprise a progressive-jazz/rock suite entitled &quot;Ennea&quot;, with lyrics based on Greek mythology. The album&#x27;s title is the Greek word for &quot;nine&quot;, a reference to the nine band members. The lyrics to the suite were written by Bill Chase&#x27;s longtime lady companion Erin Adair. The tune &quot;Cronus&quot; was originally used as an instrumental.

The single &quot;So Many People&quot; (written by Paul Williams and performed by both him and The Neighborhood) saw limited airplay in the U.S. The album charted for just 12 weeks, peaking at #71.

Part of the song &quot;Cronus&quot; was featured in the intro to the Telewizja Polska show &quot;Magazyn Kryminalny 997&quot;.

&quot;Swanee River&quot;, which opens the album, was originally entitled &quot;Closer to the feeling&quot; and was going to have a quasi–Allman Brothers flavor, but the lyrics had yet to be written. When G. G. Shinn was listening to the playbacks in the studio, he noted the chord changes were the same as Stephen Foster&#x27;s immortal &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;, so the title was altered.

&quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Long&quot; was penned by organist Phil Porter and initially was much slower and had more of an &quot;Asian&quot; feel. Charlie Brent re-arranged the song for the band to feature a screaming solo for Bill and highlight the brilliance of the trumpets more.

The songs &quot;Darkest Days&quot; and &quot;Listen To Her Sing&quot; were slated to be included on the album; however, original vocalist Terry Richards was fired in November 1971 before recordings were completed.

The album cover was photographed in December 1971 by renowned rock photographer Jim Marshall at the Music Concourse plaza in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.

==Reception==

In his retrospective review for Allmusic, critic Bruce Eder wrote that although the band&#x27;s second album appeared with high expectations, &quot;Ennea fell so far short in critical reception and sales... What was lacking was balance—the rock and jazz elements that seemed so finely tuned together on the first album don&#x27;t coexist as easily on this album... Ennea still has lots of good moments and some great ones—greater, at times, that anything on the first album if nowhere near as appealing and concise overall—and is still worth hearing.&quot;

<doc id="1062181" wikidata="Q7571101" url="?curid=1062181" title="Southville, Bristol">
<text>Southville is an inner city ward of Bristol, England, on the south bank of the River Avon northwest of Bedminster. Most of the area&#x27;s houses were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for workers in the Bristol coal mining industry or the tobacco factories of W. D. &amp; H. O. Wills, homes of the eponymous &quot;Wills Girls&quot;. The world headquarters of Imperial Tobacco, the world&#x27;s fourth largest international tobacco company, used to be here, but moved to Ashton. Southville was also a centre for the tanning industry.

The area was bombed in the second world war, with many streets losing one or more houses. Southville was the unintended target of the many short-falling bombs aimed at the adjoining dock facilities and traffic. The subsequent post-war rebuilding is noticeable on many streets, where the generic style of house building changes to modern construction. Infilling of wartime damage is still continuing. The house price boom of the early 21st century has seen new builds on existing vacant sites and on bombed sites which had been previously used for other activities such as pre-fabricated garages and car sales lots.
The area has been gentrified since the late 1990s, accompanying the national rise in house prices. It has been jokingly referred to as Lower Clifton, a reference to a more prosperous area of the city. New bars and restaurants and the Tobacco Factory theatre attract visitors to the area, while the Southville Community Centre and Southville School have become the central features of a vibrant community atmosphere. There are many artists living in the area; during the annual Arts Trail which ended in 2018, they opened their houses to the public to show and sell their work.
Dame Emily Park, on the site of the old Dean Lane coal pit head, is celebrated for its popular skateboard park and the vivid graffiti, the latter regularly updated by a variety of artists on a weekly basis. Greville Smyth Park is the largest local park and is popular for sports, families and dog walkers. Bristol South Swimming Pool, a grade II listed building, is in the south of Dame Emily Park. Once a year you can look round the old Slipper Baths here on Bristol Open Doors. Southville Community Development Association (SCDA) is a local community-led organisation that supports many local projects and also runs the Southville Centre - a community centre, café, nursery, after-school club and older people&#x27;s Monday club.

Southville is also the name of a council ward which includes the northern part of Bedminster, Ashton Gate and Bower Ashton Boundaries recently amended.
Politically, Southville ward has traditionally returned Labour councillors to Bristol City Council, though in 2006 the Green Party candidate Charlie Bolton became the first Green Councillor in Bristol, with a narrow majority of seven votes. In 2015, two Green councillors were elected in Southville.

Southville forms a part of the Bristol South parliamentary constituency, currently represented by Karin Smyth.

<doc id="1062185" wikidata="Q1545329" url="?curid=1062185" title="Triumph Toledo">
<text>The Triumph Toledo is a compact car which was produced by the Rover-Triumph division of British Leyland in the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1976.

The Toledo was introduced in August 1970 as a cheaper version of the Triumph 1300, which was at the same time replaced by the Triumph 1500. The Toledo, like the front-wheel drive 1500, came with a new split grille at the front, but instead of the 1500&#x27;s twin round headlamps, it had single rectangular units set in a grey plastic grille. The rear end was like that of the 1300 except for the tail lights, which were of a simpler, flat-faced design.

The biggest change for the Toledo was a move to rear-wheel drive and live rear axle (still with coil springs), in the interest of simplicity and low production costs. The interior was also cheaper, with wood confined to a dashboard consisting of a simple plank with holes drilled for the quite basic instrumentation but the interior was a cut above most other small cars at a time when black plastic was commonplace.

Initially, the Toledo was only available as a two-door saloon with the 1296 cc engine Standard SC engine of net. Drum brakes were fitted all round and there was no overdrive or automatic option available.

In March 1971 a 4-door &quot;special export&quot; version was launched at the Geneva Motor Show, featuring a 1500 cc engine in single and twin carburettor &quot;TC&quot; form producing 61 and 64 bhp (45 and 48 kW) net, respectively. From late August 1971 the four-door model was also available on the home market. The four-door Toledo featured the same side body pressings as the Triumph 1300. The interior furnishings were in most respects indistinguishable between the two versions, but buyers of the four-door car received two extra ashtrays in each of the extra doors. Radial ply tyres were specified in place of the cross-plies offered on the two-door car, compensating for the additional 50 kg (approx) of weight involved in installing the extra doors.

The two-door model differed very little from the more popular four-door model in overall appearance, the two-door featured non-wraparound front and rear bumpers (although this would change in 1973 to full wraparound bumpers), whilst the four-door featured wraparound bumpers from the start. Two front bumper under-riders were fitted to the two-door model; however these were deleted on later cars from around late 1972 / early 1973.

The specification gradually improved over the years. In October 1972 front disc brakes were fitted as standard on both models and a heated rear window became standard equipment by late 1973 / early 1974.

In March 1975 the two-door version was dropped: the four-door model continued in production for another year, but in improved specification form. The existing Triumph Herald three-rail type gearbox was replaced with a Triumph Spitfire 1500 type single-rail gearbox and the car was fitted with a new clutch. The new look Toledo was also fitted with side body trims, new look black type front grille (replacing the silver type front grille) and a stainless trim was added to the side roof guttering. The specification again improved; standard equipment now included a rear-view dipping mirror, fasten seat belt warning light, reclining front seats (previously an option), twin reversing lights (also previously an option), cigar lighter, hazard warning lights and a driver&#x27;s exterior door mirror. A laminated windscreen, front head rests and brushed nylon seat facings were optional extras. The Toledo was finally replaced by the Dolomite 1300 and 1500 in March 1976. Total production was 119,182 cars, making it one of Triumph&#x27;s best-selling small saloon cars.

Complete knock down kits from Triumph were still being assembled by the New Zealand Motor Corporation in 1977 for the New Zealand market and registered as late as 1978. These final Toledos had some of the refinements of post-1976 Dolomites, including a silver-coloured grille and rubber strips along the side of the car. However, they retained the shorter Toledo shell.

Technical updates were as few as the cosmetic ones. In October 1971 the compression was raised from 8.5:1 to 9:1 for the 1500, raising power from net. In October 1972 the previously optional front disc brakes became standard, and in March 1975 the TC also received the higher compression and now boasted .

Performance was middle-of the-road, top speed being around (despite the speedometer on the 1500s being far more optimistic), acceleration 0 to was 17.1 s (1300) to 13.6 s (TC).

Triumph developed a Toledo &quot;TS&quot; two-door in 1973. It featured a 1500 cc twin-carburettor engine, but never entered production.

== Recall ==
In August 1973, along with its 1500 and Dolomite siblings, the Triumph Toledo was the subject of the UK&#x27;s largest vehicle recall to date. The recall affected 103,000 cars and involved the replacement of a front radius strut in the front suspension assembly, addressing a risk that the component might break and render the car impossible to steer. The manufacturers stated they had replicated the alleged defect by driving the car into a solid kerb at between 10 and 15 mph (16–24 km/h). Despite undertaking the recall, they insisted that the condition could only &quot;arise through misuse&quot;.

<doc id="1062190" wikidata="Q2036498" url="?curid=1062190" title="Triumph 1300">
<text>The Triumph 1300 is a medium/small 4-door saloon car that was made between 1965 and 1970 by Standard Triumph in Coventry, England, under the control of Leyland Motors. It was introduced at the London Motor Show in October 1965 and intended as a replacement for the popular Triumph Herald. Its body was designed by Michelotti in a style similar to the larger Triumph 2000. It was replaced by the Triumph 1500, though it was also re-engineered in the early 1970s to provide the basis for the Toledo and Dolomite ranges.

== Equipment ==
The 1300 was Leyland&#x27;s first front-wheel drive (FWD) design. Their major rival was BMC, who was at the time producing three FWD model ranges including the Mini and the best-selling Austin 1100 series; it was hoped by Leyland that some of the 1100&#x27;s phenomenal success would rub off on the new Triumph. Triumph decided to adopt a different layout to BMC however, placing the engine above the gearbox in a longitudinal configuration (but not sharing the same oil) rather than BMC&#x27;s transverse engine layout. This resulted in a tall profile for the engine/gearbox combination which limited styling options. The engine was the same 1296 cc Standard SC unit as used in the Triumph Herald 13/60. (the engine had originated in 1953 in the Standard Eight in 803 cc form) A conventional OHV four-cylinder unit, it developed with the single Stromberg CD150 carburettor (also as used in the Herald 13/60) and was mated to a 4-speed all-synchromesh gearbox. Front suspension was by double wishbone layout, attached to a shock-absorber/spring unit, and the rear suspension by semi-trailing arms and coil springs like the 2000.

==Styling==
Styling was somewhat unusual—partly dictated by the tall engine/gearbox—with a strong family resemblance to the Triumph 2000. The front was a &quot;squashed&quot; version of the 2000 with single headlamps, and the rear had an almost &quot;chopped-off&quot; look with a very short and stubby boot. The roof had a pronounced lip above the rear window. The car was available only as a four-door saloon.

==Interior==
The interior was well-appointed with full instrumentation in a wooden dashboard, wooden door cappings, adjustable steering column and comfortable seats with ventilated PVC upholstery. There was through-flow ventilation with outlets under the rear roof lip. The car was fairly roomy, and aside from a slightly baulky gearchange, easy to drive with very reasonable performance. Standard equipment was generous and included thick carpeting but no heated backlight. Although not reclining, the front seats were remarkably versatile and could be easily adjusted for height and rake. The steering column was adjustable not only up and down but back and forth as well. From a safety angle the door handles were recessed and could not be caught on clothing and the (awkward to operate) window winders were spring-loaded and similarly recessed. The instrument panel had a speedometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, ammeter and a comprehensive cluster of warning lights arranged in a &quot;pie chart&quot; formation. The rear seat had a centre armrest which could be folded up when not in use.

==1300TC==
For 1968, the 1300TC joined the basic model. The TC used the engine then fitted in the Triumph Spitfire, which featured twin SU carburetors and in this configuration provided an advertised . The compression ratio of the TC was 9.0:1, whereas the single carb engine compression was rated 8.5:1 The car was identified by discreet &quot;TC&quot; badges. Top speed was significantly higher than the 1300 at a claimed 90 mph (145 km/h)., and acceleration times were cut by 11 per cent to a 0–50 mph (80 km/h) time of 11.5 seconds. A road test a few months later significantly improved on the company&#x27;s performance claims, achieving a maximum speed of 93 mph (150 km/h) and 0–50 mph (80 km/h) time of 10.5 seconds. With the car then retailing for a recommended UK price of £909, the road test concluded that &quot;the 1300 TC costs only £41 more than the original model, and is a very good bargain indeed&quot;.

== Estate model ==
An estate version of the 1300 reached the concept stages, but was never produced due to budgetary constraints.

== Replacement ==
In August 1970, the 1300 and 1300TC were replaced by the Triumph 1500. The engine was enlarged to , providing a useful increase in torque, but a decrease in overall power and increased fuel consumption. The front end was cleaned up considerably, and the rear redesigned with longer tail, providing a useful increase in boot space. Production of the FWD Triumphs came to an end in 1973.

== Aftermath ==

In many ways, the Triumph 1300 was a failed venture for Triumph and Leyland, as management resources were focused on finding replacements for the successful but ageing Austin-Morris models. Their Triumph-badged &#x27;in-house&#x27; competitor failed to achieve anything like the sales figures of the BMC small FWD cars, though the BMC 1100 range featured several badge-engineered variants. Moreover, the front wheel drive configuration failed to realise the handling and road-holding advantages that Triumph had hoped for, and the tall profile limited other uses for the FWD drive train, such as in the Spitfire. The 1300 was well-made and sold reasonably well in the small luxury sector, but after its direct successor was quietly switched to rear wheel drive in 1973, Triumph never designed another FWD car. More significantly, from 1970 the 1300 was re-engineered as a rear-wheel drive car and went on to form the core of Triumph&#x27;s compact range as the 1300 cc Triumph Toledo (launched in 1971) and the larger engined Triumph Dolomite released in 1972.

Like all Standard-Triumph offerings, DIY servicing was simple: the oil filter could be replaced without jacking the car, the clutch plate could be replaced from inside the car. This simplicity is what made this vehicle stand out from other British made front wheel drive cars. The N/S engine configuration allowed a lot of working space around the engine. The starter was repositioned to the front of the engine and although was a two-minute job to replace, it made the car extremely noisy during startup. It takes its place in history as being the only production car made in Britain to begin life as a &quot;front&quot;-wheel drive, and end it as a &quot;rear&quot;-wheel drive. Years later, in the 2000s, MG Rover produced high-performance versions of the Rover 75 and the related MG ZT (which were originally designed as front-wheel drive) which were rear-wheel drive. However, only a small number of these were made, while all other versions of the Rover 75 and MG ZT continued to be front-wheel drive. 

The Achilles heel of the 1300 was, primarily the poorly designed suspension wishbone layout and the front stabilizers. Unfortunately, some jobs are very involved: Changing the brake discs, CV joints or front wheel bearings all involve substantial work and should be renewed together if required. engine was too heavy for this particular design and owners found it very frustrating as the rubber bushes had to be changed every few months. Triumph&#x27;s alternative engineering design answer to the E/W Mini configuration, was a catastrophic failure.

Although the FWD 1300 was something of a disappointment, the basic design went on to provide Triumph with a popular small car until the end of Dolomite production in 1980 and overall, delivered an outstanding return on their original investment.

The Triumph 1300 has a following today in the UK classic car movement, though some parts are now scarce and the number of surviving cars not especially high.

The 1300 was also assembled in Israel by the local partner of Standard-Triumph International, Autocars Co. of Tirat Carmel. However, due to the Israeli government&#x27;s policy regarding car assembly, Triumph was forced to introduce this vehicle in a 1493 cc version in early 1968, two years ahead of this engine&#x27;s introduction in the UK. In fact, it was not until another Israeli assembler, Illin Industries, had shut down operations before Triumph could assemble the 1300 in Israel. One curious design offshoot of the 1300 was the &quot;Pony&quot; jeep-like farm vehicle, later renamed &quot;Dragoon&quot;. The Pony was exclusively offered for Autocars within the joint venture contract, but very few units were actually produced in Israel, as of 1968. The same 4WD-design was used in a rally version of the Triumph 1300. The rally project enjoyed some success before the vehicle crashed and rolled in 1969. The 4WD Triumph 1300 was subsequently abandoned.

<doc id="1062194" wikidata="Q248301" url="?curid=1062194" title="Hungarian phonology">
<text>The phonology of the Hungarian language is notable for its process of vowel harmony, the frequent occurrence of geminate consonants and the presence of otherwise uncommon palatal stops.

== Consonants ==
This is the standard Hungarian consonantal system, using symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

* It is debated whether the palatal consonant pair consists of stops or affricates. They are considered affricates or stops, depending on register, by Tamás Szende, head of the department of General Linguistics at PPKE, and stops by Mária Gósy, research professor, head of the Department of Phonetics at ELTE. The reason for the different analyses is that the relative duration of the friction of (as compared to the duration of its closure) is longer than those of the stops, but shorter than those of the affricates. has the stop-like nature of having a full duration no longer than those of other (voiceless) stops such as but, considering the average closure time in relation to the friction time of the consonants, its duration structure is somewhat closer to those of the affricates.

Almost every consonant may be geminated, written by doubling a single letter grapheme: for , for , for etc., or by doubling the first letter of a grapheme cluster: for , for , etc.

The phonemes and can appear on the surface as geminates: &quot;bridzs&quot; (&#x27;bridge&#x27;). (For the list of examples and exceptions, see Hungarian dz and dzs.)

Hungarian orthography, unlike that of the surrounding Slavic languages, does not use &quot;háčky&quot; or any other consonant diacritics. Instead, the letters &quot;c, s, z&quot; are used alone (, , ) or combined in the digraphs &quot;cs, sz, zs&quot; (, , ), while &quot;y&quot; is used only in the digraphs &quot;ty, gy, ly, ny&quot; as a palatalization marker to write the sounds , , (formerly ), .

The most distinctive allophones are:
* becomes if between a voiceless obstruent and a word boundary (e.g. &quot;lopj&quot; &#x27;steal&#x27;).
* becomes e.g. between voiced obstruents, such as &quot;dobj be&quot; &#x27;throw (one/some) in&#x27;
* may become between two vowels (e.g. &quot;tehát&quot; &#x27;so&#x27;), after front vowels (e.g. &quot;ihlet&quot; &#x27;inspiration&#x27;), and word-finally after back vowels (e.g. &quot;doh&quot; &#x27;musty&#x27;) if it is not deleted (which it often is; e.g. &quot;méh&quot; &#x27;bee&#x27;, but even then, some dialects still pronounce it, e.g., ).
*: According to Gósy, it becomes (rather than ) in words such as &quot;pech, ihlet, technika&quot; (&#x27;bad luck, inspiration, technology/technique&#x27;), while it becomes postvelar fricative in words such as &quot;doh, sah, jacht, Allah, eunuch, potroh.&quot;
* becomes when geminated, in certain words: &quot;dohhal&quot; (&#x27;with blight&#x27;), &quot;peches&quot; (&#x27;unlucky&#x27;).

==Vowels==

Hungarian has seven pairs of corresponding short and long vowels. Their &quot;phonetic&quot; values do not exactly match up with each other, so represents and represents ; likewise, represents while represents . For the other pairs, the short vowels are slightly lower and more central, and the long vowels more peripheral:
* are phonetically near-close .
* has been variously described as close-mid and mid .
* and the marginal are phonetically near-open , but they may be somewhat less open in other dialects.
* is phonetically mid .
* and the marginal are phonetically open central .

The sound marked by is considered to be by Tamás Szende and by Mária Gósy. Gósy also mentions a different short that contrasts with both and , present in a few words like &quot;Svájc&quot; (&#x27;Switzerland&#x27;), &quot;svá (&#x27;schwa&#x27;), advent&quot; (&#x27;advent&#x27;), &quot;hardver&quot; (&#x27;hardware&#x27;, this usage is considered hyperforeign or simply dated), and &quot;halló&quot; (used when answering the phone; contrasting with &quot;haló&quot; &#x27;dying&#x27;, and &quot;háló&quot; &#x27;web&#x27;).

There are two more marginal sounds, namely the long as well as the long . They are used in the name of the letters &quot;E&quot; and &quot;A&quot;, which are pronounced and , respectively. The adjective &quot;fair&quot; (as &#x27;equitable&#x27;) is pronounced in Hungarian with (it may also be short, though). This sound occurs as an alternative in &quot;erre&quot; &#x27;this way&#x27; (instead of doubling the /r/), just like in &quot;arra&quot; &#x27;that way&#x27;.

Although not found in Standard Hungarian, some dialects contrast three mid vowels , , and , with the latter being written in some works, but not in the standard orthography. Thus &quot;mentek&quot; could represent four different words: &quot;mëntëk&quot; (&#x27;you all go&#x27;), &quot;mëntek&quot; (&#x27;they went&#x27;), &quot;mentëk&quot; (&#x27;I save&#x27;), and &quot;mentek&quot; (&#x27;they are exempt&#x27;). In Standard Hungarian, the first three collapse to , while the latter one is unknown, having a different form in the literary language (&quot;mentesek&quot;).

==Vowel harmony==

As in Finnish, Turkish, and Mongolian, vowel harmony plays an important part in determining the distribution of vowels in a word. Hungarian vowel harmony classifies the vowels according to front vs. back assonance and rounded vs unrounded for the front vowels. Excluding recent loanwords, Hungarian words have either only back vowels or front vowels due to these vowel harmony rules.

While , , , and are all front unrounded vowels, they are considered to be &quot;neutral vowels&quot; in Hungarian vowel harmony. Therefore, if a word contains back vowels, neutral vowels may appear alongside them. However, if only neutral vowels appear in a stem, the stem is treated as though it is of front vowel assonance and all suffixes must contain front vowels.

Vowel harmony in Hungarian is most notable when observing suffixation. Vowel harmony must be maintained throughout the entire word, meaning that most suffixes have variants. For example, the dative case marker vs. . Stems that contain back vowels affix back vowel suffixes, and stems that contain only front vowels affix front vowel suffixes. However, the front vowel stems distinguish rounded vs. unroundedness based on the last vowel in the stem. If the last vowel is front and rounded, it takes a suffix with a front rounded vowel; otherwise it follows the standard rules. While suffixes for most words have front/back vowel variants, there are not many that have rounded/unrounded variants, indicating that this is a rarer occurrence.

One is able to observe the distinction when looking at the plural affix, either (back), (front unrounded), or (front rounded).

As can be seen above, the neutral vowels are able to be in both front and back vowel assonance words with no consequence.

However, there are about fifty monosyllabic roots that only contain , , or that take a back vowel suffix instead of the front vowel suffix.

These exceptions to the rule are hypothesized to have originated from roots originally having contained a phoneme no longer present in modern Hungarian, the unrounded back vowel , or its long counterpart . It is theorized that while these vowels merged with or , less commonly or , the vowel harmony rules sensitive to the backness of the original sound remained in place. The theory finds support from etymology: related words in other languages generally have back vowels, often specifically unrounded back vowels. For example, &quot;nyíl&quot; &#x27;arrow&#x27; (plural &quot;nyíl-ak&quot;) corresponds to Komi ньыл , Southern Mansi .

==Assimilation==
The overall characteristics of the consonant assimilation in Hungarian are the following:

* Assimilation types are typically regressive, that is the last element of the cluster determines the change.
* In most cases, it works across word boundaries if the sequence of words form an &quot;accentual unity&quot;, that is there is no phonetic break between them (and they bear a common phrase stress). Typical accentual units are:
** attributes and qualified nouns, e.g. &quot;hideg tél&quot; (&#x27;cold winter&#x27;);
** adverbs and qualified attributes, e.g. &quot;nagyon káros&quot; ~ (&#x27;very harmful&#x27;);
** verbs and their complements, e.g. &quot;nagyot dob&quot; (&#x27;s/he throws long toss&#x27;), &quot;vesz belőle&quot; (&#x27;take some [of it]&#x27;).
* There are obligatory, optional and stigmatized types of assimilation.
* The palatal affricates behave like stops in assimilation processes. Therefore, in this section, they will be treated as stops, including their IPA notations and .

===Voice assimilation===
In a cluster of consonants ending in an obstruent, all obstruents change their voicing according to the last one of the sequence. The affected obstruents are the following:

* In obstruent clusters, retrograde voicing assimilation occurs, even across word boundaries:

* is unusual in that it undergoes devoicing, but does not cause voicing, e.g. &quot;hatvan&quot; (&#x27;sixty&#x27;) is pronounced not . Voicing before occurs only in south-western dialects, though it is stigmatized.
* Conversely, causes devoicing, but never undergoes voicing in consonant clusters. e.g. &quot;dohból&quot; &#x27;from (the) musty smell&#x27;.
* Other than a few foreign words, morpheme-initial does not occur (even its phonemic state is highly debated), therefore it is hard to find a real example when it induces voicing (even &quot;alapdzadzíki&quot; is forced and not used colloquially). However, the regressive voice assimilation before does occur even in nonsense sound sequences.

===Nasal place assimilation===
Nasals assimilate to the place of articulation of the following consonant (even across word boundaries):
* only precedes a velar consonant (e.g. &quot;hang&quot; , &#x27;voice&#x27;), precedes a labiodental consonant (e.g. &quot;hamvad&quot; , &#x27;smolder&#x27;), and precedes bilabial consonants.
** before labial consonants : &quot;színpad&quot; (&#x27;stage&#x27;), &quot;különb&quot; (&#x27;better than&#x27;), &quot;énmagam&quot; (&#x27;myself&#x27;);
** before labiodental consonants : &quot;különféle&quot; (&#x27;various&#x27;), &quot;hamvas&quot; (&#x27;bloomy&#x27;);
** before palatal consonants : &quot;pinty (&#x27;finch&#x27;), &quot;ángy (&#x27;wife of a close male relative&#x27;), &quot;magánnyomozó&quot; (&#x27;private detective&#x27;);
** before velar consonants : &quot;munka&quot; (&#x27;work&#x27;), &quot;angol&quot; (&#x27;English&#x27;);
* Nasal place assimilation is obligatory within the word, but optional across a word or compound boundary, e.g. &quot;szénpor&quot; ~ (&#x27;coal-dust&#x27;), &quot;nagyon káros&quot; ~ (&#x27;very harmful&#x27;), &quot;olyan más&quot; ~ (&#x27;so different&#x27;).
===Sibilant assimilation===
* Voiceless sibilants form a voiceless geminate affricate with preceding alveolar and palatal stops (&quot;d&quot; , &quot;gy&quot; , &quot;t&quot; , &quot;ty&quot; ):
** Clusters ending in &quot;sz&quot; or &quot;c&quot; give : &quot;metszet&quot; &#x27;engraving, segment&#x27;, &quot;ötödször&quot; &#x27;for the fifth time&#x27;, &quot;négyszer&quot; &#x27;four times&#x27;, &quot;füttyszó&quot; &#x27;whistle (as a signal)&#x27;; &quot;átcipel&quot; &#x27;s/he lugs (something) over&#x27;, &quot;nádcukor&quot; &#x27;cane-sugar&#x27;.
** Clusters ending in &quot;s&quot; or &quot;cs&quot; give : &quot;kétség&quot; &#x27;doubt&#x27;, &quot;fáradság&quot; &#x27;trouble&#x27;, &quot;egység&quot; &#x27;unity&#x27;, &quot;hegycsúcs&quot; &#x27;mountain-top&#x27;.
* Two sibilant fricatives form a geminate of the latter phoneme; the assimilation is regressive as usual:
** &quot;sz&quot; or &quot;z&quot; + &quot;s&quot; gives : &quot;egészség&quot; &#x27;health&#x27;, &quot;község&quot; &#x27;village, community&#x27;;
** &quot;sz&quot; or &quot;z&quot; + &quot;zs&quot; gives : &quot;vadászzsákmány&quot; &#x27;hunter&#x27;s game&#x27;; &quot;száraz zsömle&quot; &#x27;dry bread roll&#x27;;
** &quot;s&quot; or &quot;zs&quot; + &quot;sz&quot; gives : &quot;kisszerű&quot; &#x27;petty&#x27;, &quot;rozsszalma&quot; &#x27;rye straw&#x27;;
** &quot;s&quot; or &quot;zs&quot; + &quot;z&quot; gives : &quot;tilos zóna&quot; &#x27;restricted zone&#x27;, &quot;parázs zene&quot; &#x27;hot music&#x27;.
** Clusters &quot;zs+s&quot; , &quot;s+zs&quot; , &quot;z+sz&quot; and &quot;sz+z&quot; are rather the subject of the voice assimilation.
* If one of the two adjacent sibilants is an affricate, the first one changes its place of articulation, e.g. &quot;malacság&quot; , &quot;halászcsárda&quot; &#x27;Hungarian fish restaurant&#x27;. Sibilant affricate–fricative sequences like are pronounced the same as geminate affricate during normal speech.
* Sibilant assimilation can be omitted in articulated speech, e.g. to avoid homophony: &quot;rozsszalma&quot; ~ &#x27;rye straw&#x27; ≠ &quot;rossz szalma&quot; &#x27;straw of bad quality&#x27;, and &quot;rossz alma&quot; &#x27;apple of bad quality&#x27; as well.
* NB. Letter cluster &quot;szs&quot; can be read either as &quot;sz+s&quot; , e.g. &quot;egészség&quot; &#x27;health&#x27;, or as &quot;s+zs&quot; , e.g. &quot;liszteszsák&quot; &#x27;bolting-bag&#x27; depending on the actual morpheme boundary. Similarly &quot;zsz&quot; is either &quot;zs + z&quot; , e.g. &quot;varázszár&quot; &#x27;magic lock&#x27;, or &quot;z + sz&quot; , e.g. &quot;házszám&quot; &#x27;street-number&#x27;; and &quot;csz&quot;: &quot;cs + z&quot; ~ &quot;c + sz&quot; . Moreover, single digraphs may prove to be two adjacent letters on morpheme boundary, like &quot;cs&quot;: &quot;cs&quot; ~ &quot;c + s&quot; ; &quot;sz: sz&quot; ~ &quot;s + z&quot; , &quot;zs&quot;: &quot;zs&quot; ~ &quot;z + s&quot; .

===Palatal assimilation===
Combination of a &quot;palatalizable&quot; consonant and a following palatal consonant results in a palatal geminate. Palatalizable consonants are palatal ones and their non-palatal counterparts: &quot;d&quot; ~ &quot;gy&quot; , &quot;l&quot; ~ &quot;ly&quot; , &quot;n&quot; ~ &quot;ny&quot; , &quot;t&quot; ~ &quot;ty&quot; .
* Full palatal assimilation occurs when the ending palatal consonant is &quot;j&quot; : &quot;nagyja&quot; &#x27;most of it&#x27;, &quot;adja&quot; &#x27;s/he gives it&#x27;; &quot;tolja&quot; &#x27;s/he pushes it&#x27;; &quot;unja&quot; &#x27;s/he is bored with it&#x27;, &quot;hányja&quot; &#x27;s/he throws it&#x27;; &quot;látja&quot; &#x27;s/he sees it&#x27;, &quot;atyja&quot; &#x27;his/her father&#x27;. The cluster &quot;lyj&quot; is a simple orthographic variant of &quot;jj&quot; : &quot;folyjon&quot; &#x27;let it flow&#x27;.
* Partial assimilation takes place if an alveolar stop (&quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;) is followed by a palatal &quot;gy&quot; , &quot;ty&quot; : &quot;hadgyakorlat&quot; &#x27;army exercises&#x27;, &quot;nemzetgyűlés&quot; &#x27;national assembly&#x27;; &quot;vadtyúk&quot; &#x27;wild chicken&#x27;, &quot;hat tyúk&quot; &#x27;six hens&#x27;.
* Some sources report that alveolar stops change into their palatal counterparts before &quot;ny&quot; : &quot;lúdnyak&quot; &#x27;neck of a goose&#x27;, &quot;átnyúlik&quot; &#x27;it extends over&#x27;. The majority of the sources do not mention this kind of assimilation.
* When the first consonant is nasal, the partial palatal assimilation is a form of the nasal place assimilation (see above).
* The full palatal assimilation is an obligatory feature in standard Hungarian: its omission is stigmatized and it is considered as a hypercorrection of an undereducated person. Partial palatal assimilation is optional in articulated speech.
===Degemination===
Long consonants become short when preceded or followed by another consonant, e.g. &quot;folttal&quot; &#x27;by/with (a) patch&#x27;, &quot;varrtam&quot; &#x27;I sewed&#x27;.

===Intercluster elision===
The middle alveolar stops may be omitted in clusters with more than two consonants, depending on speed and articulation of speech: &quot;azt hiszem&quot; ~ &#x27;I presume/guess&#x27;, &quot;mindnyájan&quot; &#x27;one and all&#x27;, &quot;különbség&quot; ~ &#x27;difference&#x27;. In morpheme onsets like &quot;str-&quot; , middle stops tends to be more stable in educated speech, &quot;falanxstratégia&quot; ~ ~ &#x27;strategy based on phalanxes&#x27;.

===Elision of ===
* assimilates to a following (e.g. &quot;balra&quot; , &#x27;to the left&#x27;).

 also tends to be omitted between a preceding vowel and an adjacent stop or affricate in rapid speech, causing the lengthening of the vowel or diphthongization (e.g. &quot;volt&quot; &#x27;was&#x27;, &quot;polgár&quot; &#x27;citizen&#x27;). This is quite common in dialectal speech, but considered non-standard in the official language.

===Hiatus===
Standard Hungarian prefers hiatus between adjacent vowels. However some optional dissolving features can be observed:
* An optional weak glide may be pronounced within a word (or a compound element) between two adjacent vowels if one of them is &quot;i&quot; , e.g. &quot;fiaiéi&quot; ~ (&#x27;the ones of his/her sons&#x27;). This, however, is rarely transcribed.
* Adjacent identical short vowels other than &quot;a&quot; and &quot;e&quot; may be pronounced as the corresponding long vowel, e.g. &quot;zoológia&quot; ~ (&#x27;zoology&#x27;).
* Adjacent double &quot;i&quot; is always pronounced as single short in the word endings, e.g. &quot;Hawaii&quot; . This reduction is reflected in the current orthography when the adjective-forming suffix &quot;-i&quot; is added to a noun ending in &quot;i&quot;. In this case suffix &quot;-i&quot; is omitted also in writing. e.g. &quot;Lenti&quot; (a placename) + &quot;-i&quot; → &quot;lenti&quot; &#x27;of Lenti&#x27;.

==Stress==
The stress is on the first syllable of the word. The articles &quot;a&quot;, &quot;az&quot;, &quot;egy&quot;, and the particle &quot;is&quot; are usually unstressed.
