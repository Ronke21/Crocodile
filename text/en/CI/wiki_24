<text>Eugene Alan Snisky (born January 14, 1970) is an American professional wrestler and actor, better known by his ring name Gene Snitsky, who is best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment. He played college football at the University of Missouri.

==Early life==
Snitsky attended Panther Valley High School where he played football. While in high school, Snitsky played as a punter. During his senior year, he was named All-State. Upon graduating in 1988, Snitsky signed a full scholarship to the University of Missouri where he played under offensive lineman coach and future Kansas City Chiefs Head Coach Andy Reid. After playing for the Missouri Tigers, Snitsky attended training camps with the goal of playing professional football. He was on the pre-season roster in 1995 for the Birmingham Barracudas of the Canadian Football League. He eventually signed with the San Diego Chargers. During training, Snitsky re-aggravated a shoulder injury that was previously misdiagnosed from his college years. The injury effectively ended his NFL aspirations.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1997–2003)===
Snisky trained with the Allentown, Pennsylvania-based World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) and competed in the promotion under the name &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Snitsky. He won the tag-team championship along with his partner Robb Harper as the Twin Tackles, under a football gimmick. When he entered singles competition, he won the WXW Heavyweight Championship. In 2013, Snitsky was inducted into the WXW Hall of Fame.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2003–2008, 2023)===
==== Developmental territories (2003–2004) ====
Snisky had a tryout match with the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) the day after winning the WXW Championship on October 20, 2003, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania at a &quot;Raw&quot; taping. Snisky, wrestling as Gene Snitsky, was defeated by fellow WXW wrestler &quot;Smooth&quot; Tommy Suede. It was following this match that he was signed to a developmental deal and sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). Snisky wrestled in OVW as &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Mondo (a name inspired by &quot;Mean&quot; Gene Okerlund), and was presented as the kayfabe brother of Mike Mondo.

====Debut and &quot;Heat&quot; mainstay (2004–2006)====
He made his WWE debut on the September 13, 2004, edition of &quot;Raw&quot; against Kane in a no-disqualification match. As Kane, a heel at the time, prepared to injure Snitsky, he was distracted by Lita, who was (kayfabe) pregnant with Kane&#x27;s child. Snitsky used the distraction to hit Kane from behind with the chair, causing Kane to fall on Lita, and causing Lita to miscarry her unborn baby. When interviewed about the incident, he claimed &quot;it wasn&#x27;t my fault&quot; (which became his catchphrase). This facilitated a face turn for Kane and quickly established Snitsky as a full-time heel wrestler.

Snitsky, who had debuted against Kane as an apparent jobber, said years later that he was originally only supposed to make a one-night appearance, then return for OVW for more training before being called back up to the main roster on a full-time basis. The angle with Kane and Lita had gone over so well that WWE made a last-minute decision to promote him to the main roster full-time and flew him in to &quot;Raw&quot; on the company&#x27;s corporate jet.

He was then situated in a major feud with Kane, which led to a match at Taboo Tuesday. In this match, Snitsky used a steel chair and crushed Kane&#x27;s larynx. WWE used this angle as an excuse for Kane&#x27;s absence, when in reality he was going to film the WWE-produced movie &quot;See No Evil&quot;. This feud resumed at the New Year&#x27;s Revolution pay-per-view, when Kane returned and defeated Snitsky. On the January 31 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Snitsky lost a steel cage match to Kane to end the feud.

At Survivor Series, Snitsky had an encounter with a character similar to his own, Heidenreich, in which they both exchanged their views on each other – &quot;I like .. your poetry.&quot;; &quot;I .. like what you do.. to babies.&quot; — while breathing hard, both their trademark ways of talking. Snitsky was then in the main event as part of Team Triple H and facing Team Orton. During the match he was busted open by Maven before being disqualified for attacking him with a steel chair. At the 2005 Royal Rumble, the two met up again as Snitsky secretly partnered with Heidenreich, planning to interfere in Heidenreich&#x27;s casket match with The Undertaker. It was later revealed that Kane was hidden in the casket, who pounced on both Snitsky and Heidenreich. They continued their fight in the crowd, before letting the casket match continue. Later that night, Snitsky competed in the Royal Rumble match in which he eliminated Paul London, before being eliminated himself by Batista.

When his rivalry with Kane ended, Snitsky had a shot at the Intercontinental Championship, which then was held by Shelton Benjamin. Snitsky lost by disqualification after hitting Benjamin with a steel chair.

He was absent from WWE television between April and May 2005 due to a blood clot in his stomach. He returned to action on May 28, and reappeared on &quot;Raw&quot; on May 30, where he began in earnest his televised feud with house show opponent Chris Benoit. The feud concerned Benoit&#x27;s appearance at ECW One Night Stand; Snitsky was a &quot;hired gun&quot; for Eric Bischoff&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot; volunteers, brought in to try to invade the pay-per-view and ruin the ECW reunion.

Snitsky was then used by Edge and Lita to attack Kane and by Eric Bischoff as punishment to anybody that he did not like. On July 11 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Edge informed Snitsky that he knew about his female foot fetish and offered Snitsky to &quot;have a go with Lita&#x27;s feet&quot; if he&#x27;d help him in a match against Kane. His history with Lita was addressed when she thanked Snitsky for his actions nine months earlier, stating that she was better off for not having given birth to Kane&#x27;s offspring and then gave him a kiss as payment.

On the July 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Snitsky faced WWE Champion John Cena in the Lumberjack match where Chris Jericho picked all heel lumberjacks to make the odds unfair for Cena.

After a few weeks mainly wrestling on &quot;Heat&quot;, Snitsky formed a tag team with an initially reluctant Tyson Tomko. In their first team match together, they squashed the tag team of Viscera and Val Venis. The pair had some success as a tag team, becoming the number one contenders for the World Tag Team Championship at one point. They lost their shot at Big Show and Kane, both of whom Snitsky had feuded with in the past, and broke up in April 2006 when Tomko left WWE.

Following that, Snitsky turned face and formed a tag team with Goldust, defeating various teams of wrestlers on &quot;Heat&quot;, which eventually earned them an unsuccessful title shot against Spirit Squad. The team broke up when Goldust was released from WWE.

====Brand switches and departure (2007–2008)====

In 2007, Snitsky&#x27;s character underwent a drastic overhaul and was now portrayed as a psychotic madman with a grotesque appearance. To this effect, all of the hair on Snitsky&#x27;s head and face was shaved off (including his eyebrows), his teeth were colored a dark yellow, and several red marks were placed on his face. On the February 6, 2007, edition of &quot;ECW on Sci Fi&quot;, a vignette introduced the newly changed Snitsky to the viewers and announced him coming to ECW. Later during the same show, Snitsky debuted and assaulted the ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley. This re-established him as a monstrous heel, similar to Kane&#x27;s unmasked gimmick. Over the next several weeks, Snitsky would run into the ring after matches and attack various ECW superstars, including CM Punk, Hardcore Holly, Balls Mahoney, and Matt Striker.

On April 3, 2007, Snitsky faced Holly in a match, which he won. After the match, Snitsky wedged Holly&#x27;s arm in between two steel steps and repeatedly hit the steps with a steel chair, in storyline, breaking Holly&#x27;s arm. Snitsky then began a short feud with Balls Mahoney. Then, he would begin another short feud with Rob Van Dam. During this feud, Snitsky would suffer his first ECW loss when he was defeated by Van Dam by disqualification.

On the June 11 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, Snitsky was drafted from ECW back to Raw as part of the WWE Draft. Snitsky made his return to the brand on the July 9 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Super Crazy.

Snitsky continued to go undefeated on &quot;Raw&quot; throughout the summer, having pinfall victories over various wrestlers including Super Crazy, Val Venis, Rory McAllister, and Robbie McAllister.

On August 20, Snitsky competed in his first one-on-one main-event match since losing to John Cena on &quot;Raw&quot; in 2005, once again against Cena, which he lost via disqualification when Randy Orton interfered. This was Snitsky&#x27;s first loss since returning to the Raw brand. On the September 10 &quot;Raw&quot;, it was revealed that Snitsky was not Vince McMahon&#x27;s illegitimate son. Snitsky returned on the October 8 &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Val Venis, substituting for Santino Marella, who was feuding with Venis. On December 3, Snitsky was pinned by Jeff Hardy in an Intercontinental Championship match, his first pinfall loss in the year. Snitsky last appeared on WWE television on the November 24, 2008 &quot;Raw&quot;, losing an Intercontinental Championship tournament match to CM Punk. On December 11, 2008, at his request, Snitsky was released from his WWE contract.

====One night return (2023)====
On November 6, 2023, Snitsky made a cameo appearance on Raw backstage with Chelsea Green saying his famous line &quot;It Wasn&#x27;t My Fault&quot;.

===Independent circuit and first retirement (2008–2018)===
After his release, Snitsky worked in the independent circuit, mainly in World Xtreme Wrestling, where he won the WXW C4 Ultimate Heavyweight Championship on April 20, 2012. He vacated the title on November 3, 2012. On November 4, 2017, Snitsky won the Right Coast Pro Heavyweight Championship in Delaware-based promotion Right Coast Pro Wrestling. On May 19, 2018, he relinquished it due to injury. On June 22, 2018, Snitsky announced that he plans to retire from professional wrestling after working a few more shows.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2014)===
Snitsky, along with Rycklon, debuted for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on the June 25 taping of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; (which aired on July 24) as a heel, attacking Tommy Dreamer, Bully Ray and Devon, ostensibly aligning with Dixie Carter.

Snitsky and Rycklon were fired by Carter on the August 7, 2014, edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;. Earlier on the show they were in an Eight-Man Hardcore War as Team Dixie (EC3, Rhino, Rycklon and Snitsky) lost to Team Bully (Bully Ray, Devon, Tommy Dreamer and Al Snow).

=== Major League Wrestling (2023–present) ===
On May 24, 2023, it was announced by Major League Wrestling that Snitsky would be making his return to professional wrestling on July 8 at Never Say Never. He won his debut match by defeating Yoscifer El in a singles match. On September 3, 2023 at Fury Road, he faced off against Alex Kane, but in a losing effort.

==Other media==
In 2009, Gene Snitsky appeared as a biker in the music video for the song &quot;Free Your Soul&quot; by Vyrus. He also appeared as an actor in the role of a biker and a criminal on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Primetime: What Would You Do?&quot;, in February 2011. He has appeared in other episodes, including one where he played a person harassing a little person. In 2013, he was announced to play a role in the first episode of a non-profit Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fan series titled &quot;MMPR&quot; which never materialized.

Snitsky became a pitchman for Tristar Products&#x27; Power Pressure Cooker XL and has shot a series of videos for YouTube where he demonstrates how to prepare various foods in the pressure cooker. Two examples of these are a low country boil and buffalo wings.

Snitsky starred in the 2019 horror film &quot;100 Acres of Hell&quot; as Buck Severs.

==Personal life==
Snitsky lives with his wife Carolyn in Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania, where they often spend time outdoors. He has a father who served in the Air Force and a brother who served in the Army. After his release from WWE, Snitsky began running an Army surplus store in Hamburg, Pennsylvania, where he also spends time riding bike trails.

Snitsky has a fetish for women&#x27;s feet, something he is open about.

<text>Strait Out of the Box (retroactively known as &quot;Strait Out of the Box: Part 1&quot;) is the first box set album by American country music artist George Strait. It contains four albums&#x27; worth of music, dating from 1976 to 1995. It mainly consists of Strait&#x27;s singles, except for a select few that he decided to exclude. They were replaced by his choice of album cuts and several studio outtakes. It also contains his three singles recorded in the 1970s for indie label D Records, one of which, &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Go on Dying Like This&quot;, was re-recorded for Strait&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Love Is Everything&quot;.

&quot;Check Yes or No&quot; and &quot;I Know She Still Loves Me&quot; were both released from this set as singles. Respectively, they reached number 1 and number 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts.

The album was certified 8× platinum by the RIAA on July 29, 2003, indicating shipment of 2 million copies.
This made the album at the time the best-performing country music box set of all time, and it was second only to the &quot;Live 1975–85&quot; box set by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band overall. It had sold 1,525,100 copies in the United States as of October 2019.

<doc id="1051653" wikidata="Q627209" url="?curid=1051653" title="Rollerball (1975 film)">
<text>Rollerball is a 1975 dystopian science fiction sports film directed and produced by Norman Jewison. It stars James Caan, John Houseman, Maud Adams, John Beck, Moses Gunn and Ralph Richardson. The screenplay, written by William Harrison, adapted his own short story &quot;Roller Ball Murder&quot;, which had first appeared in the September 1973 issue of &quot;Esquire.&quot;

Although &quot;Rollerball&quot; had a largely American cast, a Canadian director, and was released by the American company United Artists, it was produced in London and Munich.

&quot;Rollerball&quot; was a box office success, and critical reviews were initially mixed but have warmed somewhat over time.

==Plot==
In 2018, Jonathan E. is the team captain and veteran star of the Houston Rollerball team. Mr. Bartholomew, chairman of the Energy Corporation - one of a series of corporations that now govern society - and team sponsor, offers Jonathan a lavish retirement package if Jonathan will announce his retirement during an upcoming television special detailing his career. Jonathan refuses, and requests to see his former wife Ella, who had been taken from him some years earlier by a corporate executive who wanted her for himself.

Jonathan goes to a library, where he finds that all books have been digitized and edited to suit the corporations, and are now stored on supercomputers at large protected corporate locations. Jonathan&#x27;s friend and former coach Cletus, now an Energy executive, warns him that the Executive Committee is afraid of him, though he cannot find out why.

Rollerball soon degrades into senseless violence as the rules are changed to force Jonathan out. The semi-final match between Houston and Tokyo is played with no penalties and limited substitutions in the hope Jonathan will be injured and forced out. The brutality of the match kills several players and leaves Jonathan&#x27;s best friend and teammate Moonpie in a coma, though Houston wins the game.

In a teleconference, the Executive Committee decides that the final match will be played with no penalties, no substitutions, and no time limit in the hope that Jonathan will be killed during the game. Jonathan&#x27;s popularity and longevity as a player threaten the underlying agenda of Rollerball: to demonstrate the futility of individualism.

Jonathan makes his way to Geneva to access the world&#x27;s repository of all human knowledge, a central supercomputer known as &quot;Zero,&quot; only to find its memory corrupted. Afterwards, Jonathan receives a visit from his former wife Ella, who has been sent to convince him to retire and to make it clear that the coming game will be &quot;to the death&quot;. Jonathan realizes his wife&#x27;s visit was set up by the Executives, and erases a long-cherished movie of the two of them, stating, &quot;I just wanted you on my side.&quot; Jonathan decides that despite the dangers, he will play in the championship game against New York.

The final match devolves into a brutal gladiatorial fight. Jonathan is soon the only player left on the track for Houston, while a skater and a biker remain from New York. After a violent struggle in front of Mr. Bartholomew&#x27;s box, Jonathan kills the skater and takes the ball. The biker charges, and Jonathan knocks him off the bike and pins the biker down. He raises the ball over his head, then pauses. Refusing to kill his fallen opponent, Jonathan gets to his feet and makes his way to the goal, slamming the ball home and scoring the game&#x27;s only point. Jonathan then takes a victory lap as the crowd chants his name, first softly, then slowly rising to a roar while Mr. Bartholomew hastily exits the stands.

==Cast==

==Production==

&quot;Rollerball&quot;″s arena sequences were shot at the Rudi-Sedlmayer-Halle in Munich, West Germany. This hall was selected because it was the only sports arena in the world with a near-circular profile, which the production could take over and re-dress for shooting.

The then-new BMW Headquarters and Museum buildings in Munich appear as the headquarters buildings of the Energy Corporation at Olympiapark, Munich. Scenes were also filmed at Fawley Power Station, near Southampton. The sequence where Jonathan E. visits Geneva to consult with Zero the supercomputer concerning corporate decisions uses exterior shots of the Palace of Nations.

Recognizing their contribution to the film&#x27;s many crucial action sequences, &quot;Rollerball&quot; was the first major Hollywood production to give screen credit to its stunt performers. The film was shot in 35mm with a 1.85 aspect ratio but was released in some theaters in 70mm with a 2:1 aspect ratio.

The game of Rollerball was so realistic that the cast, extras, and stunt personnel played it between takes on the set. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, Howard Cosell interviewed Norman Jewison and James Caan on &quot;ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;, showing clips from the film and with the two of them explaining the rules of the game. Audiences who saw the film so loved the action of the game that Jewison was contacted multiple times by promoters, requesting that the &quot;rights to the game&quot; be sold so that real Rollerball leagues might be formed. Jewison was outraged, as the entire point of the movie was to show the &quot;sickness and insanity of contact sports and their allure.&quot;

English pro wrestler Mark Rocco was a stuntman for the film. He used the &quot;Rollerball&quot; name as his nickname.

==Music==
Bach&#x27;s Toccata and Fugue in D minor is performed on organ by Simon Preston during the opening title sequence and again at the final scene, bookending the film. Adagio in G minor by Albinoni/Giazotto and the &quot;Largo&quot; movement from Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 are also used to establish tone, mood, and atmosphere for certain scenes in the film. The classical music was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by André Previn, who also wrote the &quot;Executive Party&quot; music for the film and the corporate anthems performed before certain matches.

==Release==
The film was released in the United States on June 25, 1975. It had its European premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on September 3, 1975, before opening to the public there the following day.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film earned $6.2 million in theatrical rentals at the box office in the United States and Canada.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67% based on reviews from 36 critics, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;In &quot;Rollerball&quot;, social commentary collides with high-speed action – and the audience is the winner.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 56 out of 100 based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Most major critics were negative about the film upon its original release. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was unimpressed:
All science-fiction can be roughly divided into two types of nightmares. In the first the world has gone through a nuclear holocaust and civilization has reverted to a neo-stone Age. In the second, of which &quot;&quot;Rollerball&quot; is an elaborate and very silly example, all of mankind&#x27;s problems have been solved but at the terrible price of individual freedom. ... The only way science-fiction of this sort makes sense is as a comment on the society for which it&#x27;s intended, and the only way &quot;Rollerball&quot; would have made sense in a satire of our national preoccupation with televised professional sports, particularly weekend football. Yet &quot;Rollerball&quot;&quot; isn&#x27;t a satire. It&#x27;s not funny at all and, not being funny, it becomes, instead, frivolous.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and called it &quot;a movie in love with itself&quot; and &quot;vapid, pretentious, and arrogant. Not even John Houseman&#x27;s fine performance as a villainous corporate director is sufficient to make &quot;Rollerball&quot; tolerable. The only way to enjoy it, I suppose, is to cheer at the rollerball game&#x27;s mayhem.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot;, wrote that it &quot;packs an emotional and intellectual wallop&quot; and that James Caan gave an &quot;excellent performance&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive, calling it &quot;a fresh, unusual and stimulating movie. In its portraying of the vast and essentially stateless multinational corporations, &quot;Rollerball&quot; plays off developments which have come since Huxley&#x27;s and Orwell&#x27;s time.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; claimed that it was “the most original, and imaginative and technically proficient peek into our future since &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey.&quot;” Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; panned &quot;Rollerball&quot; as &quot;A classic demonstration of how several millions of dollars can be unenjoyably wasted ... this glib fable seems to be aiming at a simplified version of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; without any intimations of wit or satire to carry the vague moralistic message.&quot;

James Monaco wrote that &quot;Rollerball&quot; &quot;like most paranoid fantasies offers no hope: If James Caan can&#x27;t beat the system, who can?&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film three out of four stars; it said &quot;the performances of Caan and Richardson are excellent, and the rollerball sequences are fast-paced and interesting.&quot; Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; said Caan looked &quot;unconvinced and uncomfortable&quot; as Jonathan E.

&quot;Filmink&quot; said the film &quot;launched the dystopian sports movie genre and a series of rip-offs (&quot;Death Race 2000&quot;, etc) – most of which, to be frank, were a lot more fun than &quot;Rollerball&quot;, which could have stood to be a little less important and a little trashier.&quot;

In 1977, Caan himself rated the film 8 out of 10, saying he &quot;couldn&#x27;t do much with the character.&quot;

==Video game==
In 1985, IJK Software produced a game called &quot;Rocketball&quot; for the Commodore 64 computer, with the scoring rules based on the game in the movie. In 1989, Microïds published an unofficial successor called &quot;Killerball&quot; for the Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, and MS-DOS.

In 1997, Z-Axis Games was developing an official Rollerball video game adaptation based on the film As part of MGM Interactive video game showcase lineup. The game&#x27;s promise was to recreate the action of the futuristic game played in the movie, and it was set 10 years after the events of the film in the 2098 Rollerball season, where the player would be in charge of managing their Rollerball teams around the world, made up of Rollerball players with roles such as strikers, enforcers, guard, and other players who compete using jet bikes and magnetic in-line skates. &quot;Rollerball: The Video Game&quot; was slated to be released for PlayStation, PC, and Nintendo 64 on the first quarter of 1998, but was delayed to mid-1998 and then was canceled due to the publisher, MGM Interactive, going bankrupt.

In 2004, I-play developed and published a &quot;Rollerball&quot; game for mobile phones. It is based on the 1975 film, rather than the 2002 remake of the same name.

&quot;Speedball&quot; and its sequel &quot;Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe&quot; were influenced by &quot;Rollerball&quot;, though Bitmap Brothers co-founder Mike Montgomery denies this, saying &quot;Speedball&quot;&#x27;s similarities to the film are more of a coincidence.

The developers of the 2022 game &quot;Rollerdrome&quot; cited the film as a major influence.

<doc id="1051658" wikidata="Q5668516" url="?curid=1051658" title="Harry E. Claiborne">
<text>Harry Eugene Claiborne (July 2, 1917 – January 19, 2004) was a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada from 1978 until his impeachment and removal in 1986. Appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1978, Claiborne was only the fifth person in United States history to be removed from office through impeachment by the United States Congress and the first since Halsted Ritter in 1936.

Claiborne was born in 1917 in McRae, Arkansas. He attended Ouachita Baptist University and Cumberland School of Law where he received a Bachelor of Laws before serving in the United States Army during World War II. After the war he settled in Las Vegas, Nevada, where he established himself as a flamboyant and well-known defense attorney representing many prominent people with ties to Las Vegas, including entertainers like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Judy Garland, and Carol Burnett, and mobsters like Bugsy Siegel, Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal, Joe Conforte, and Benny Binion.

Claiborne served one term as a Democratic state assemblyman and ran unsuccessfully against Howard Cannon in the 1964 Democratic primary for the United States Senate in Nevada. The two remained friends, however, and Cannon later recommended Claiborne to President Carter for an open federal district court judicial seat in 1978. He rose to Chief Judge of the United States district court in Nevada and held that position from 1980 to 1986.

Claiborne was convicted in 1984 of tax evasion and served 17 months of a two-year prison sentence before his release in 1987. In 1986 the United States House of Representatives impeached him and the United States Senate convicted him and removed him from office. His impeachment proceedings set a controversial new precedent of using a special twelve-member committee to collect and hear evidence, rather than the full Senate. He maintained that the Justice Department had a vendetta against him and improperly obtained the false testimony of brothel owner Joe Conforte, one of Claiborne&#x27;s former clients.

Claiborne was allowed to begin practicing law again in Nevada in 1987 in a decision by the Nevada Supreme Court that implicitly questioned the federal prosecution. In 2004, he killed himself with a self-inflicted gunshot wound following health battles with cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Early life and education==

Claiborne was born on July 2, 1917, in McRae, Arkansas. His father was Arthur Smith Claiborne Jr., a cotton farmer, and his mother was Minnie King Claiborne, a schoolteacher in Little Rock, Arkansas. According to Harry, the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s grand wizard once criticized Harry&#x27;s father, Arthur, for being the only white farmer in the region who was not a member of the organization. Arthur responded, &quot;I won&#x27;t join any organization whose members need to wear hoods over their faces.&quot; After later saving an immigrant farmer from a lynching, Arthur knew the KKK would return for retribution and waited at the immigrant&#x27;s farm with a shotgun. When the KKK arrived, one of their members approached a barn with a lit torch, but Arthur fired a round of buckshot into him and knocked him from his horse. According to Harry, &quot;Never again was a man lynched by the KKK in his community because they knew they would have to answer to [Arthur] Claiborne.&quot; The event had a profound impact on Harry&#x27;s worldview.

Growing up in McRae, Claiborne gained a reputation for his speaking ability. He would often accompany his grandfather to view court proceedings at the White County Courthouse in nearby Searcy, Arkansas.

Claiborne attended Ouachita Baptist University. He was determined to attend law school at Louisiana State University so he hitchhiked to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, seeking admission. At the time one only needed two years of college for admittance to law school. After he was refused admission, Claiborne hitchhiked back home to Arkansas and caught a ride with a salesman named Schneider, who told Claiborne that he was childhood friends with Judge Albert B. Neil, the chief justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Mr. Schneider gave Claiborne a letter of introduction, and after visiting Neil in person, Claiborne was granted admission to Cumberland School of Law, then part of Cumberland University in Tennessee. He graduated from Cumberland with a Bachelor of Laws in June 1941 and returned to Arkansas, where he was a clerk in the Coulter Law Firm of Little Rock (Pulaski County).

==Pre-judicial career==

In 1942 during World War II, Claiborne was admitted to practice in his home state of Arkansas, but since the war had just begun, he enlisted in the United States Army and was sent to the Santa Ana Army Air Base. He served in the military police force. He would later say that he was inspired by his father&#x27;s stand against the Ku Klux Klan and so refused to go along with the internment of Japanese Americans in camps, and was punished for doing so. Whatever happened, by 1943, Claiborne was promoted to warrant officer and transferred to what is now Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas, Nevada. His job was to investigate AWOL (absent without leave) incidents. Later, he guarded prisoners and supervised the military police who patrolled downtown Las Vegas. He was briefly stationed in New Mexico and then Massachusetts.

Claiborne was issued a train ticket home to Arkansas in 1945, but he instead opted to go to Las Vegas. Within a day of arriving, he secured a job as a patrolman for the Las Vegas Police Department. By 1947, he was admitted to the Nevada state bar and was working in the Clark County District Attorney&#x27;s office. He was later the chief deputy district attorney for Clark County (1946–1948) and served as a state assemblyman in 1948. That same year he also served as city attorney for North Las Vegas.

After entering private practice Claiborne quickly became a well-known defense attorney in Las Vegas. Claiborne not only represented many police officers in legal matters without charge, but helped establish the police protective association in Las Vegas and was instrumental in securing the passage of legislation providing for civil service status for policemen and firemen by the Nevada legislature. He was considered one of Nevada&#x27;s top defense lawyers, representing many prominent people with ties to Las Vegas. Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin hired him for casino licensing matters. Judy Garland, Carol Burnett, and one of Errol Flynn&#x27;s wives came to him for divorces. He represented several mobsters like Bugsy Siegel and Frank &quot;Lefty&quot; Rosenthal. He also represented Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Conforte, the owner of the Mustang Ranch brothel, and Benny Binion, owner of the Horseshoe Casino. All his clients, whoever they were, were advised not to fill out financial net worth statements when applying for gaming licenses; Claiborne said these could be used as evidence in possible income tax evasion prosecutions by the IRS. He said he personally would never fill one out. Claiborne was a flamboyant attorney who would frighten other lawyers by carrying in large stacks of papers that he passed off as his evidence in the case, but in reality the papers in the folders often were blank. In 1974 and 1975 Claiborne served as a special assistant to the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration during the historic hearings on Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s nomination to the vice-presidency.

==1964 United States Senate campaign==

In 1964, Claiborne launched a &quot;quixotic, albeit short-lived, campaign for Senate at the last minute on July 15.&quot; His campaign in the Democratic primary for the United States Senate was against his friend, incumbent Senator Howard Cannon. Years later Claiborne indicated he was recruited to run by party activists concerned that Cannon&#x27;s ties to Bobby Baker, the Senate secretary who was then at the center of a financial scandal, would cause the party to lose the seat. Two others entered the primary as well – Las Vegas civil rights activist James McMillan and Sparks City Councilman Bill Galt. However, Claiborne was seen as a bigger threat to Cannon due to Claiborne&#x27;s high-profile in Las Vegas and his &quot;man-on-the-street appeal&quot; that the other contenders could not match. &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; reporter Jude Wanniski wrote that Claiborne &quot;seems forceful, animated and determined – even if less organized. He bills himself as a fighter and he sounds that way. He mispronounces words here and there, and, for a lawyer, mangles the English language to an unbelievable extent. But it&#x27;s all masculine and vigorous.&quot;

Nevertheless, Claiborne&#x27;s primary campaign &quot;soon deteriorated into a piecemeal, uncoordinated exercise that almost all political analysts and journalists described as hopeless.&quot; Cannon ultimately won the nomination and received 59% of the vote. Claiborne placed third, receiving 10,807 votes compared to Galt&#x27;s 12,054 votes. On primary election night, Claiborne rushed to Cannon&#x27;s campaign headquarters to congratulate him and pledge support in the general election, proclaiming, &quot;Howard Cannon is a fine man. I know he can serve us better than his opponent.&quot; Nearly forty years later, Claiborne noted, &quot;I misjudged the Baker factor. I thought it would defeat Howard.&quot;

==Federal judicial service==

On July 25, 1978, Claiborne was nominated by President Jimmy Carter to a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Nevada vacated by Judge Bruce R. Thompson, on the recommendation of Claiborne&#x27;s former opponent, Senator Howard Cannon. During the appointment process, on August 8, 1978, a hearing was held before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary concerning his qualifications and background. At the start of that hearing, the acting chairman, Senator Dennis DeConcini, stated for the record that he had been advised that a &quot;substantial majority&quot; of the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association was of the opinion that Claiborne was &quot;well qualified&quot; for appointment to the federal bench; a minority of the Bar Association&#x27;s committee found him not qualified on the sole ground that Claiborne was, at that time, sixty-one years of age. Although not part of any official Senate proceedings, other sources note that Claiborne was unique as a federal judge, given that most federal judges had experience as Assistant United States Attorneys. He also maintained a close friendship with former client Benny Binion, a casino owner and convicted murderer; the two men frequently ate lunch together. Moreover, Claiborne was known for cashing large checks at Las Vegas casinos and had a &quot;reputation for liking whiskey and flashy women.&quot; Claiborne was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 11, 1978, received his commission the same day, and was sworn in on September 1, 1978. He served as Chief Judge from 1980 to 1986.

==Allegations of impropriety==

In April 1977, Joe Conforte – one of Claiborne&#x27;s former clients who owned a well-known Storey County, Nevada, brothel called Mustang Ranch – was arrested on 10 counts of income tax evasion and faced a minimum five years in prison and $10,000 fine. He appealed his conviction but fled the country in 1980 when he lost the appeal. Just before fleeing in December 1980, Conforte contacted a prosecutor and offered to become a federal witness against officials he said he had bribed. The most prominent name on Mr. Conforte&#x27;s list was Harry Claiborne. Conforte claimed he paid Claiborne $85,000 in bribes to give to federal appeals judges to reverse his tax conviction and quash the subpoenas of two prostitutes in a federal investigation into voter fraud.

Joseph Yablonsky, who headed the Las Vegas FBI office from 1980 to 1983, offered Conforte millions of dollars in tax breaks for his testimony against Claiborne. Gerald Swanson, who served alongside Yablonsky as director of the Internal Revenue Service in Nevada, could not verify the allegations and therefore refused to support a grand jury probe based on Conforte&#x27;s testimony. Since Yablonsky needed Swanson&#x27;s help with tax breaks for Conforte, he targeted him in a phony sting to see if he would accept bribes to reduce Conforte&#x27;s tax bill. Swanson did not take the bait and the sting was aborted with no charges, but Swanson was nevertheless placed on administrative leave in 1982 and later transferred to Dallas, where he became an assistant regional commissioner.

With Swanson neutralized, Yablonsky was able in 1983 to get the help of the IRS in returning Conforte to the United States in exchange for testimony against Claiborne. A federal grand jury heard testimony against Claiborne in Portland and Reno, where the Conforte bribes allegedly took place, before indicting Claiborne on bribery, fraud, and tax evasion on December 8, 1983. In April 1984, however, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared, primarily because Conforte&#x27;s bribery testimony did not hold up in court. Trial evidence showed that Conforte could not have been in Nevada to make one of the bribes because he was in New York renewing a passport while appealing his tax conviction. According to Swanson, &quot;Conforte perjured himself consistently at the trial. His testimony was fabricated. I don&#x27;t think there were any bribes at all. Conforte constructed the testimony to suit Yablonsky&#x27;s needs.&quot;

At Claiborne&#x27;s second trial in July 1984, prosecutors dismissed the bribery charges and proceeded only with the tax charges, which did not involve Conforte. Claiborne was ultimately convicted the next month for failing to report more than $107,000 on his 1979 and 1980 federal income tax returns, money he earned as a lawyer before his appointment by President Carter in 1978. Prosecutors alleged that the judge had hidden thousands of dollars in attorneys fees from the IRS after he was appointed to the federal bench in 1978. On August 10, 1984, Claiborne was found guilty in the U.S. District Court of Nevada for tax evasion, fined $10,000, and sentenced to two years in prison. He became the first federal judge ever convicted of crimes while on the bench. On March 16, 1986, Claiborne began serving his prison sentence in FPC Montgomery, a federal prison located on the grounds of Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. He was there for 17 months until October 1987.

Many lawyers and judges in the Nevada legal community regarded it as a case of selective prosecution. Swanson said that had Conforte not been brought in to testify against Claiborne and give him a bad name, the IRS would have resolved the judge&#x27;s tax problems through routine civil proceedings. Claiborne long maintained he was too busy on the bench to pay close attention to his tax return, noting he never even looked at the document until his accountant brought it to him. &quot;I asked how much I owed, and I wrote a check.&quot; Supporter Nevada State District Judge Michael Cherry further alleged in 2004, &quot;He was very, very fair to criminal defendants to his detriment. I think that is why the government was so interested in prosecuting him and knocking him off the bench.&quot; That the money was owed, but not paid, was generally conceded.

==Impeachment and removal==

When Claiborne entered prison on March 16, 1986, for tax evasion, he intended to return to the bench two years later and therefore did not resign his judiciary post. As a result, he continued to receive his salary of $78,700 a year. This brought considerable controversy and pressure on some in Congress to remove him. However, the United States Constitution allowed only one method for removing a federal judge – impeachment.

===U.S. House proceedings===

====Impeachment articles====

On May 22, 1986, Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R, WI) called for impeachment. On June 3, 1986, Rep. Peter Rodino (D, NJ) introduced H.Res 461 calling for impeachment of high crimes and misdemeanors. The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice. The subcommittee approved the impeachment articles on June 24, 1986.

The subcommittee version of Article IV also charged that Claiborne had violated his oath of office. But several members, particularly Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., and Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, opposed this language. Morrison argued the entire article was unnecessary and preferred to rely on only the first three articles to make clear that conviction of a felony was enough to warrant removing a judge from office. However, Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., chairman of the U.S. House Courts Subcommittee, argued strongly for inclusion of the article, saying it alleged conduct that was an impeachable offense and was premised on the fact that Claiborne had violated the canons of judicial ethics.

Ultimately the subcommittee agreed to a DeWine amendment striking language referring to the oath of office and adding language asserting that Claiborne had &quot;betrayed the trust of the people of the United States.&quot; The article was subsequently approved and adopted by the subcommittee on June 24, 1986. In drafting the impeachment articles, the Judiciary Committee tried to stick closely to the jury findings on tax evasion and to the conviction itself. Committee members wanted to avoid general charges that could give Goodman an opening for going beyond the findings of the Nevada jury.

====Moving for impeachment====

During a two-hour presentation on June 19, 1986, to Kastenmeier&#x27;s subcommittee before the panel drew up articles of impeachment, future Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman, Claiborne&#x27;s principal lawyer, repeated his allegations that Claiborne&#x27;s trial was tainted by government misconduct. But members indicated these assertions were irrelevant. Kastenmeier noted the allegations did not change the facts — that Claiborne was found by a Nevada jury to have filed false income tax returns in 1979 and 1980.

Having passed the subcommittee, the matter moved on to be considered by the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, which had last considered an impeachment in 1974, when it recommended removing President Richard Nixon from office (Nixon resigned before a House vote). Judiciary Chairman Peter Rodino, Jr., D-N.J., who presided over those Nixon proceedings, told colleagues on June 26, 1986, that judges &quot;simply cannot act in a way that violates the public trust and undermines the integrity of the judicial office. Once public confidence in the courts erodes, our tripartite system of government fails.&quot;

Whether or not tax fraud rose to the level of &quot;high crimes and misdemeanors,&quot; or whether a convicted felon could be allowed to remain on the federal bench, were not questions discussed at great length. After only a few hours of debate, the House Judiciary Committee reported the articles of impeachment.

====Impeachment vote====

On July 22, 1986, the United States House of Representatives adopted H Res 461, voting to impeach Claiborne on a 406-0 roll call. As a unanimous vote. Claiborne&#x27;s fellow Nevadans, Reps. Harry Reid, a Democrat, and Barbara Vucanovich, a Republican, also voted for impeachment.

Claiborne became the 14th federal official to be impeached by the U.S. House and the first of only three federal officials to be impeached on a unanimous roll-call vote, the others were Thomas Porteous and Walter Nixon. While his impeachment was historic, the debate and final action on July 22 was anticlimactic. No one really doubted that Claiborne would be impeached or that it would be unanimous. On August 6, 1986, the U.S. House presented articles of impeachment to the U.S. Senate.

Hamilton Fish IV, R-N.Y., the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, expressed his position saying, &quot;Judge Claiborne is more than a mere embarrassment. He is a disgrace — an affront — to the judicial office and the judicial branch he was appointed to serve.&quot; Judiciary Chairman Rodino spoke of safeguarding the judicial system, noting, &quot;If we fail to act, the confidence of the people in that system will be gravely jeopardized.&quot; Kastenmeier added that the House had &quot;a responsibility to the public. The purpose of impeachment is not to punish the individual but to protect the institution.&quot;

Following the impeachment vote, the House selected nine Judiciary Committee members, led by Rodino, to manage, or try, the case against Claiborne in the Senate. The chief House prosecutor was William J. Hughes, D-N.J., chairman of the Crime Subcommittee and a lawyer who served for more than 10 years as a New Jersey prosecutor. The other House managers were Kastenmeier; Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky.; Dan Glickman, D-Kan.; Fish; Henry Hyde, R-Ill.; Thomas Kindness, R-Ohio; and DeWine.

===Senate proceedings===

When the U.S. House formally presented the Senate with the four articles of impeachment against Claiborne on August 6, 1986, it set the stage for the first U.S. Senate impeachment trial in fifty years. House Judiciary Chairman, Rep. Rodino, was joined by eight other House managers and read each of the articles &quot;to an unusually somber Senate. About 40 senators were in their seats listening.&quot; Vice President George Bush presided over a ceremony where members of the Senate took a special oath for the impeachment trial. The only one absent was Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, who was ill.

====Senate procedures====

On July 25, 1986, the Senate Rules Committee met to draft rules for impeachment trial and on August 12, 1986, the Senate Rules Committee approved revisions of Senate impeachment rules. On August 14, 1986, the Senate established procedures for the impeachment trial, including approving S. Res. 481 providing for the use of trial committee to hear evidence. Rather than convening the entire Senate into a High Court of Impeachment, the Senate agreed that evidence in the Claiborne impeachment trial would be heard, first, by a 12-member panel created for that purpose.

Acting upon a Senate rule adopted in 1935, but never used, the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee examined evidence and heard testimony before reporting its findings to the full Senate. All previous impeachment trials had been conducted before the full Senate. The Senate ultimately decided to use the special committee because Senate leadership did not believe there was enough time for the full Senate to hear all the testimony and wanted to avoid postponing the trial to a lame-duck session or until the next Congress.

Under Senate impeachment rules, the committee could gather evidence, summon witnesses, hear testimony, and present a report to the full Senate. However, the committee could not make a recommendation on whether to convict the impeached official. All senators would then have the opportunity to review the evidence before the chamber voted to convict or acquit. The Senate&#x27;s use of a committee was controversial and some feared it gave Claiborne a basis on which to criticize the proceedings. Others defended the procedure and argued the Senate was not bound by federal courts traditions and standards.

The committee was made up of six Republicans named by Majority Leader Bob Dole and six Democrats named by Minority Leader Robert Byrd. All were lawyers. The Republicans were Orrin Hatch (Utah), Charles Mathias (Maryland), Mitch McConnell (Kentucky), Larry Pressler (South Dakota), Warren Rudman (New Hampshire), and John Warner (Virginia). Senators Hatch, Mathias, and McConnell were members of the Judiciary Committee. Rudman was a former state attorney general.

The Democrats were Jeff Bingaman (New Mexico), Dennis DeConcini (Arizona), Al Gore (Tennessee), Howell Heflin (Alabama), David Pryor (Arkansas), and Paul Sarbanes (Maryland). Heflin was a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, Bingaman was a former state attorney general, and Sarbanes had served on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974, during the impeachment process against Nixon (Nixon resigned before the House could vote to either article of impeachment).

====Special senate committee====
On September 15, 1986, the Senate Impeachment Trial Committee began seven days of hearings before television cameras in the Senate Caucus Room in the Russell Senate Office Building, the same room used by the special Watergate committee in 1973 for the investigation of President Nixon. Although Nixon&#x27;s Watergate hearings were in the legislative tradition, the Claiborne hearings resembled more of a judicial proceeding. The House managers, acting as prosecutors, were on one side of the room, and on the other side was Claiborne, escorted by federal marshals and his lawyers. Claiborne&#x27;s primary lawyer was future Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman.

The special senate committee was chaired by Sen. Charles Mathias, who tried to follow the rules of evidence and procedures used in a courtroom trial. For the first couple of days senators submitted their questions to Sen. Mathias and he put them to the witnesses. But on September 17, 1986, the full Senate quickly adopted a rule permitting each senator to ask their own questions. After seven days of testimony, on September 23, 1986, the committee finished gathering. Nearly two of the seven days were devoted to questioning Claiborne. On September 30, 1986, the Trial Committee presented its report to the Senate.

====Claiborne&#x27;s defense====

Former Sen. Howard Cannon, D-Nev., who had helped convince President Carter to appoint Claiborne in 1978 and who was advising Goodman during the impeachment action, said on July 24, 1986, that Claiborne wanted to use the Senate trial to publicize the misconduct charges. &quot;His objective is to try this matter of prosecutorial and government misconduct. He wants the opportunity to present that full-blown someplace. The only place, obviously, is before the Senate.&quot;
Claiborne told the senate panel he had been &quot;chased&quot; from the bench by ambitious federal agents and that he had been wrongly convicted for willfully filing false income tax returns. &quot;They have been pursuing me like a pack of wolves would pursue a sick caribou. I know what they have done to my family. I know what they have done to my life. I am innocent. I don&#x27;t feel innocent merely. I am innocent.&quot; Although he acknowledged his 1979 and 1980 tax returns under-reported income, he blamed his tax preparers for the &quot;brutal errors&quot; and said he was only guilty of &quot;neglecting my personal affairs terribly.&quot;

During the proceedings, senators frequently asked Claiborne how his taxes were prepared and how much he knew about tax law, noting that he ruled as a judge in tax cases. Sen. Warner and Nicholas Chabraja, special House counsel for the Claiborne trial, read many of Claiborne&#x27;s opinions involving tax cases and indicated skepticism of Claiborne&#x27;s claims that he did not know much about tax law. But Claiborne noted when he was in private practice, he never handled tax cases and never filled out his own returns. He also countered that although some of the cases he presided over as a judge may have had tax issues, they generally rested on other legal principles.

Claiborne&#x27;s 1979 tax return prepared by his accountant Joseph Wright indicated that his legal fee income for the year was $41,073.93, but the tax return only reported income of $22,332.87 from legal fees. Claiborne insisted that on April 11, 1980, he directed his secretary, Judy Ahlstrom, to send a letter to Wright correcting his fee income. Ahlstrom confirmed that she dropped the letter off at Wright&#x27;s office. However, Wright and his wife, Connie, who helped manage the office, testified they never got the letter. Claiborne alleged he remembered seeing it on Wright&#x27;s desk. To bolster the point Claiborne&#x27;s lawyer, Oscar Goodman, produced a surprise witness, Ellen Arthur, who said in an affidavit submitted on September 23, 1986, that while she was working for Wright she received an envelope from Ahlstrom containing tax papers from Claiborne. However, Arthur&#x27;s affidavit did not say that she opened the envelope nor that she saw what was in it.

For his 1980 tax returns, Claiborne stopped using Wright (whom he had used for more than 30 years) and switched to a new tax preparer named Jerry Watson, owner of Creative Tax and Business Planning, who completed the returns in pencil. Claiborne admitted he had &quot;an impression&quot; something was wrong with his 1980 return, but claimed he did not really look at it until he was indicted in 1983. He did not find any issues with Watson reducing the taxable income from the $725,000 sale of his house in 1980, nor was he surprised to see that he would get a refund of $20,927. Claiborne estimated he would still owe the government $25,000 for 1980 and he sent a check for that amount when he applied for an extension to file his 1980 return. The $25,000 was returned along with the $20,927 refund.

Senator Larry Pressler and several other senators questioned Claiborne about why he started cashing checks at Las Vegas casinos, especially checks as large as $37,000 and $42,000, and questioned that amount of cash could fit into pockets. Claiborne responded that cashing checks at casinos was a common practice in Las Vegas and that he did it because he needed cash for repairs on his new home. He denied that he used the money for gambling or carousing, noting, &quot;I think I&#x27;m about as colorful and flamboyant as a cold mashed potato sandwich.&quot;

A dramatic exchange occurred on September 22, 1986, when Chabraja sought to find a motive for Claiborne&#x27;s underreporting of taxes in 1980. After Chabraja suggested it was greed, Claiborne quickly responded that there was nothing to indicate in &quot;my whole professional life or my personal life that I have been greedy. I will tell you sir, your remark wounds me and I am sorry for that. Because I think you are a very fine lawyer, and it is regrettable that you would engage in such conduct, particularly in view of the fact that I have been a good judge.&quot; When Sen. Mitch McConnell asked Claiborne why he should not be removed from office, Claiborne responded, &quot;The biggest danger I can see to the federal court is if ever there be created a buddy relationship between the federal judiciary and the executive branch.&quot;

====Trial and conviction====

For Claiborne&#x27;s Senate trial, the Senate was arranged to resemble a courtroom with one side featuring a table with Claiborne and his lawyers, and the other side featuring the nine House managers and their special counsel, Chabraja. A speaker&#x27;s stand was between the tables for each side to make arguments.

On October 7, 1986, sitting as a Court of Impeachment, the Senate heard closing arguments, including an argument by defense that the use of a trial committee was unconstitutional. Claiborne was eager to present the witnesses that could have corroborated his defense and he and his attorneys argued that by using a special committee, the Senate had denied Claiborne his constitutional right to a full trial before the entire Senate. But both a federal district judge and an appeals court panel in Washington, D.C., determined they lacked authority to adjudicate an impeachment trial. Two hours before the final vote, Chief Justice William Rehnquist denied Claiborne&#x27;s request for a stay.

The Senators were close to a recess and were therefore in no mood to extend the trial hearings further. On October 8, 1986, then-Majority Leader Bob Dole moved to prevent Claiborne from presenting witnesses and instead call for a separate congressional investigation into those alleged abuses. The Senate agreed by a vote of 61–32. However, the separate probe never took place.

On October 9, 1986, the United States Senate voted on whether to convict Claiborne on all four articles of impeachment. During a typical senate vote, senators answer &quot;aye&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; but during the conviction hearings senators were told to stand and say &quot;guilty,&quot; &quot;not guilty,&quot; or &quot;present.&quot; Senate President Pro Tempore Strom Thurmond put the question before each roll call: &quot;Senators, how say you: Is the respondent, Harry E. Claiborne, guilty or not guilty?&quot; Even John Stennis, who had lost a leg to cancer two years earlier, pulled himself to a standing position each time his name was called.

The vote on the third article of impeachment held particular significance for the history of impeachment trials. Article 3 essentially stated that Claiborne&#x27;s conviction by a jury trial in the district court proved that he was guilty of &quot;misbehavior&quot; and &quot;high crimes.&quot; With a vote of 46 to 17 (35 voted &quot;present&quot;), Article 3 was the only article not to achieve the required two-thirds majority for conviction. In voting down this article, senators expressed concern that adoption might set a troublesome precedent: by declaring that a court conviction was automatic grounds for conviction in an impeachment trial, the reverse situation – an acquittal in a court trial – might require an automatic acquittal in an impeachment trial.

===Impeachment legacy===

The historical importance of the Claiborne case came not in the debate over his guilt or innocence, which had been decided in a court of law, but in the procedural precedents set in the impeachment trial, particularly in the first use of the Senate trial committee authorised in 1935.

After the conviction, citing this use of a Senate trial committee instead of the entire Senate, Oscar Goodman said, &quot;Harry Claiborne is no longer the fight. The fight is whether the Constitution is worth the paper it&#x27;s written on. It is a fragile document. Today it was bruised if not broken.&quot; Goodman also went on to accuse several Senators of not properly reviewing the committee transcripts.

==Life after impeachment==

Claiborne was allowed to begin practicing law again in Nevada in 1987, in a decision by the Nevada Supreme Court that implicitly questioned the federal prosecution. His attorney was future Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman. Despite his tax conviction and removal from the bench, Claiborne remained respected in the Las Vegas legal community.

Claiborne was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1990 and it later spread to his groin and spine. He had a heart attack in 1991. He treated his cancer with a combination of radiation and herbs he took three times daily. By 2003, the cancer returned to his liver, he was in considerable pain, and he had progressing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. On January 19, 2004, he killed himself in Las Vegas apparently due to his health battles. His wife, Norma Ries, said they and their 22-year-old grandson, Aaron, were in the house watching &quot;American Idol&quot; &quot;and laughing about the people who couldn&#x27;t sing. Harry said his back was hurting and he wanted to go into the den to sit down. Two minutes later my grandson and I heard a gunshot. He was in so much pain, but didn&#x27;t want to go to the hospital. He was in the hospital in June, and he told me he never wanted to go back there again.&quot;

==Personal life==

Harry Claiborne was married four times. He first married Barbara Redfield and they had three children. Claiborne later married (2nd) Lee McGuire, (3rd) Lynn O&#x27;Day, and was married for 27 years to Norma Ries.

<doc id="1051659" wikidata="Q383844" url="?curid=1051659" title="Rollerball (2002 film)">
<text>Rollerball is a 2002 science fiction sports film directed by John McTiernan. A remake of the 1975 film of the same name, based on William Harrison&#x27;s short story &quot;Roller Ball Murder&quot;, the film stars Chris Klein, Jean Reno, LL Cool J, Rebecca Romijn and Naveen Andrews.

While both versions of &quot;Rollerball&quot; use the same basic premise, the 2002 version has a much greater focus on action sequences, more muted social and political overtones than the original, and takes place in the mid-2000s rather than in a future dystopian society.

&quot;Rollerball&quot; was released on February 8, 2002. Upon its release, the film was critically panned, receiving criticism for the lack of the original&#x27;s social critique, and was a box-office bomb, grossing $25.9 million against a production budget of $70 million.

==Plot==
In 2005, the new sport of Rollerball, a violent extension of roller derby involving motorcycles and a metal ball, becomes popular in many countries. Marcus Ridley invites the talented sports fanatic Jonathan Cross to join him playing for the Zhambel Horsemen in Kazakhstan. Jonathan refuses, hoping to try out for the NHL in some months. However, after he recklessly skates through his hometown, the police start looking for Jonathan, who is forced to accept Marcus&#x27;s offer to escape them. The highly paid Marcus and Jonathan are teamed with low-paid locals, who are often severely injured in the game.

In the beginning, Jonathan, the team&#x27;s star player and the poster child of promoter Alexi Petrovich, is enamored by the high-octane sport, the popularity, sports cars, and his female teammate Aurora. The two keep their relationship a secret and refuse to put a stop to rumors that Aurora is a lesbian. During one game, one of their teammates is killed by an opponent, something that is prone to happen in a match. However, the team quickly discovers that that murder might have been planned before the game, as one of the straps of the victim&#x27;s helmet had been cut and the cameras filming the event seemed ready for the death to happen. Jonathan and Ridley eventually discover that Alexi and his assistant, Sanjay, have a vested interest in keeping the game as popular as possible, through planned gory &quot;accidents&quot; and ensuring that Jonathan and Ridley cannot quit the team and remain high-profile stars. Both the deaths and Jonathan&#x27;s talent seem to generate upticks in ratings.

Jonathan and Ridley pretend to know nothing about this situation, wanting to keep their current lifestyle, but after an &quot;accident&quot; almost kills Aurora, the two friends decide that they need to flee the country to save their lives. Their teammates, including Aurora, cannot join them, though, as they have families there. Jonathan and Marcus are followed by Alexi and several bodyguards, who attack the two before they can reach the Russian border. Jonathan is injured and Ridley has to leave him behind. Alexi and his men capture Jonathan and kill Ridley before the latter can cross the border.

Jonathan says that he will keep working for Alexi if Aurora is traded to another team, wanting to keep her away from danger. Alexi complies, secretly transferring Aurora to the opposing team for the next match. Knowing he cannot trust Jonathan anymore, Alexi tries to stage a public execution of him by removing all the rules from the upcoming Rollerball match. The match becomes more violent than ever before, and many players die. However, Jonathan, with the help of players from both teams, starts a revolution, causing the fans to see the sport for what it really is. In a fit of rage, he kills Alexi and Sanjay before reuniting with Aurora.

==Production==

Although the first draft of the script was considered by many to be very good and even superior to the original film, director John McTiernan didn&#x27;t like it because it focused more on social commentary, while he thought that the audience would like to see more of the Rollerball scenes. He had the original script completely re-written several times and made sure that it focused more on WWE-like showmanship, including crazy costumes and stunts, while changing the film&#x27;s storyline from a modern-day success story to a classic underdog story and changing the name of the main character in the film from Jonathan E. to Jonathan Cross.

The movie was filmed in about 15 weeks, between July 24 and November 2000. McTiernan&#x27;s first cut, which was over two hours long, was test screened in Las Vegas around April or May 2001, and got a very negative response from test audiences. MGM pushed the release date from May to July 13, 2001 to test the movie again, hoping that they would find the right audience for it.
Harry Knowles from &quot;Ain&#x27;t it Cool News&quot; was invited by McTiernan for a test screening of the film in Long Island sometime after the first test screening, and in his review of McTiernan&#x27;s original cut, Knowles said that the movie was bad, but was at least an unapologetic hard-R film with much nudity and some brutal violence in Rollerball scenes, but even as a workprint it was obvious how poorly the action scenes were edited, and the story was bad. &quot;The &#x27;Rollerball&#x27; edit I saw was one of the worst films I&#x27;d seen in my life. There was jeering in the theater,&quot; Knowles said. Knowles was also one of the people who read the original first draft of the script (the one that McTiernan rejected) and he said that it was an amazing script which solved all the problems of the original film.

Following the negative test screenings, MGM ordered massive re-shoots and re-edits to be done on the film in the middle of 2001. Shortly after the test screenings, MGM appointed a new head of marketing and distribution, Robert Levin, who convinced McTiernan to let go of the summer release date. This would give the studio more time to devise a better marketing strategy and allow McTiernan to do re-shoots and to re-edit the film for a PG-13 rating, in an attempt by the studio to get a wider audience to see the film. The release date was then pushed back again from August all the way to February 2002, due to all the post production work causing delays. McTiernan shot two weeks of additional footage in late 2001 to clarify certain scenes, especially the film&#x27;s ending, and also cut down the violence and all the nudity.

On orders from the studio, around 30 minutes were cut out of the original rough cut of the film and the entire ending was re-shot and changed. Some of the cuts were made because MGM thought the movie was &quot;too Asian&quot;.
In the original ending, Petrovich gets killed by Sanjay and Jonathan and Aurora fly back to the US, during which Jonathan says that he will continue playing the Rollerball game in the US, and how he is now part owner of the game.

Some of the scenes that were cut for the PG-13 rating, but were never put back even in later DVD and Blu-ray so called R rated versions of the film, include lots more blood in all the Rollerball scenes and parts like skulls getting smashed, bones getting broken, teeth flying out, a scene where Aurora is topless and walks towards Jonathan in the locker room originally didn&#x27;t have a shadow over her (this was added in post production to cover her up for the PG-13 rating), their sex scene was also longer, and so was their conversation while they are lying down in a sauna. Some of the other similar edits that were done on more graphic scenes in the film include digitally replacing blood spurts with sweat.

Some of the action scenes were also longer in the original cut and/or edited differently or re-shot, such as the opening scene in San Francisco which was partially re-shot after the original version of it was considered to be too confusing due to the editing.

The original score by Brian Transeau was also removed, purportedly because it sounded &quot;too Arabic&quot;, and was replaced with a new score by Éric Serra. Also, some of the other music was changed or removed from the first cut of the film.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 3% based on 119 reviews and an average rating of 2.55/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Removing the social critique of the original, this updated version of &quot;Rollerball&quot; is violent, confusing, and choppy. Klein makes for a bland hero.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 14 out of 100 based on reviews from 28 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B− on scale of A to F.

&quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s Trevor Johnson described it as &quot;a checklist shaped by a 15-year-old mallrat: thrashing metal track, skateboards, motorbikes, cracked heads and Rebecca Romijn with her top off&quot;. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; reviewer Roger Ebert called it &quot;an incoherent mess, a jumble of footage in search of plot, meaning, rhythm and sense&quot;. Chris Klein, the lead actor, was also a subject of criticism, with Ebert saying Klein seemed like a &quot;nice kid&quot; and was not convincing in what aspired to be a hard-edged violent film.

===Box office===
The film was a box-office flop, earning a worldwide total of $25.9 million compared to a production budget of $70 million. In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.

===Accolades===
Rebecca Romijn was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award as Worst Supporting Actress, where she lost to Madonna for her cameo in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. At the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film won the awards for Worst Director (McTiernan), Worst Remake, and Worst Female Fake Accent (Romijn-Stamos). Romijn-Stamos was also nominated for Worst Actress but lost to Madonna for &quot;Swept Away&quot;.

The creator of &quot;Rollerball&quot;, science fiction author William Harrison, said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never watched the 2002 incarnation of &quot;Rollerball&quot;, and have no interest in it.&quot;

==Controversy==
In 2013, director John McTiernan was sent to federal prison for making a false statement to an FBI investigator in February 2006 about his hiring the private investigator Anthony Pellicano to illegally wiretap Charles Roven, the producer of the film, around August 2000. McTiernan (who was released in 2014) had been in a disagreement with Roven about what type of film &quot;Rollerball&quot; should be, and had hired Pellicano to investigate Roven&#x27;s intentions and actions.

<text>Warner Bros. Television Studios, operating under the name Warner Bros. Television (abbreviated as WBTV; formerly known as Warner Bros. Television Division), is an American television production and distribution studio and the flagship studio of the Warner Bros. Television Group division of Warner Bros., a flagship studio of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Launched on March 21, 1955 by William T. Orr, it serves as a television production arm of DC Comics productions by DC Studios and, alongside Paramount Global&#x27;s CBS Studios &amp; CW Studios (the network&#x27;s recently-launched production arm), The CW, the latter that launched in 2006 and Paramount and WBD have a 12.5% ownership stake each while Nexstar Media Group owns the remaining 75%. It also serves as the distribution arm of WBD units HBO, Cartoon Network and Adult Swim.

As of 2015, it is one of the world&#x27;s two largest television production companies measured by revenue and library along with Sony Pictures Television.

As of May 2024, WBTV is producing nearly 40 scripted series for WBD’s Max, external streaming platforms, cable, and the five U.S. broadcast networks.

== History ==
=== Beginning and saturation ===
The division was started on March 21, 1955, with its first head being Jack L. Warner&#x27;s son-in-law William T. Orr. ABC had approached Warner Bros. initially with the idea of purchasing the studio&#x27;s film library (WB eventually sold the rights to the negatives of pre-1950 films and pre-1948 cartoons and shorts to Associated Artists Productions, or a.a.p., in 1956). WB formally entered television production with the premiere of its self-titled anthology series &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; on ABC. The one-hour weekly show featured rotating episodes of television series based on the WB films &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Kings Row&quot;, as well as an original series titled &quot;Cheyenne&quot; with Clint Walker. The first one-hour television western, &quot;Cheyenne&quot; became a big hit for the network and the studio with the added advantage of featuring promotions for upcoming Warner Bros. cinema releases in the show&#x27;s last ten minutes. One such segment for &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; featured Gig Young notably talking about road safety with James Dean.

With only &quot;Cheyenne&quot; being a success, WB ended the ten-minute promotions of new films and replaced &quot;Warner Bros. Presents&quot; with an anthology series titled &quot;Conflict&quot;. It was felt that &quot;Conflict&quot; was what the previous series lacked. &quot;Conflict&quot; showed the pilots for &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;.

The success of &quot;Cheyenne&quot; led WBTV to produce many series for ABC such as Westerns &quot;(Maverick&quot;, &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Colt .45&quot;, &quot;Bronco,&quot; a spin off of &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;Sugarfoot&quot;, and &quot;The Alaskans&quot;), crime dramas (&quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;Bourbon Street Beat&quot;, and &quot;Surfside 6&quot;), and other shows such as &quot;The Gallant Men&quot; and &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot; using stock footage from WB war films and gangster films respectively. The company also produced Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;Red Nightmare&quot; starring Jack Kelly for the U.S. Department of Defense that was later shown on American television on Jack Webb&#x27;s &quot;General Electric True&quot;.

All shows were made in the manner of WB&#x27;s B pictures in the 1930s and 1940s; fast-paced, much stock footage from other films, stock music from the Warners music library and contracted stars working long hours for comparatively small salaries with restrictions on their career.

During the 1960 Writers Guild of America strike, WB reused many plots from its films and other television shows under the nom de plume of &quot;W. Hermanos&quot;. This was another example of imitating Warner Bros.&#x27; B Pictures who would remake an &quot;A&quot; film and switch the setting.

Two of the most popular stars, James Garner and Clint Walker, quit over their conditions. Garner never returned to the Warners fold during this period, instead moving forward into a major theatrical film career. Successful Warners television stars found themselves in leading roles of many of the studio&#x27;s theatrical films with no increase in salary. Efrem Zimbalist Jr. was simultaneously the lead of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; briefly overlapping with a recurring role as &quot;Dandy Jim Buckley&quot; on &quot;Maverick&quot;, and also headlined several films until exhaustion forced the studio to give him a rest. Many other actors under contract to Warners at the time, who despite their work conditions, did see their stars rise over time, albeit for most only briefly, included Jack Kelly, Will Hutchins, Peter Brown, Ty Hardin, Wayde Preston, John Russell, Donald May, Rex Reason, Richard Long, Van Williams, Roger Smith, Mike Road, Anthony Eisley, Robert Conrad, Robert McQueeney, Dorothy Provine, Diane McBain and Connie Stevens. Edd Byrnes and Troy Donahue would become teen heartthrobs. Another contract player, Englishman Roger Moore (&quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;The Alaskans&quot;), was growing displeased with Warner as his contract was expiring and would relocate to Europe from Hollywood, becoming an international star on television, and eventually, in theatrical films, playing James Bond among other roles. Warners also contracted established stars such as Ray Danton, Peter Breck, Jeanne Cooper and Grant Williams. These stars often appeared as guest stars, sometimes reprising their series role in another TV series.

The stars appeared in WB cinema releases with no additional salary, with some such as Zimbalist, Walker, Garner (replacing Charlton Heston in &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot;), and Danton (replacing Robert Evans in &quot;The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond&quot;) playing the lead roles; many of the stars appeared in ensemble casts in such films as &quot;The Chapman Report&quot; and &quot;Merill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;. Some stars such as Connie Stevens, Edd Byrnes, Robert Conrad and Roger Smith made albums for Warner Bros. Records. One particular recording, a novelty tune titled &quot;Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)&quot; became a big hit for Edd Byrnes and Connie Stevens (1959). The following year, Connie Stevens had her own hit, with &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot;.

It was during this period that series, particularly Westerns like &quot;Cheyenne&quot; and &quot;Maverick&quot;, and the crime dramas like &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; and &quot;Surfside 6&quot; featured catchy theme songs that became just as much a part of the American pop culture landscape as the shows themselves. Depending on the particular series (in this case, the Westerns), William Lava or David Buttolph would compose the music, with lyrics by Stan Jones or Paul Francis Webster, among others. For the crime shows, it was up to the songwriting team of Jerry Livingston and Mack David, who also scored the themes for the sitcom &quot;Room for One More&quot;, and &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;.

In 1960, WBTV turned its attentions to younger audiences as they brought Bugs Bunny and the other WB cartoon characters to prime time, with &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;, which featured cartoons released after July 31, 1948 (which had not been sold to Associated Artists Productions), combined with newly animated introductory material. Also, that year saw the debut of &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;, which was thought to be a more benign alternative to Desilu&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. Whether or not that was actually the case, it was, in fact, much less successful.

WBTV expanded on its existing genre of Westerns and crime dramas, and in January 1962, produced its first sitcom, &quot;Room For One More&quot;. Based on the memoirs of Anna Rose, which in 1952 WB made into a movie starring Cary Grant and his then-wife Betsy Drake (the only movie that they worked together in) about a married couple with two children of their own who went on to adopt at least two more. The TV series starred Andrew Duggan and Peggy McCay as George and Anna Rose. Acting legend Mickey Rooney&#x27;s son Tim, and Ahna Capri, who would continue to do episodic TV roles and feature films (arguably, her best-known movie was &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; starring Bruce Lee) were cast as the Rose&#x27;s natural children. The show only lasted for half a season. In the fall of that year, a WWII drama &quot;The Gallant Men&quot; debuted, but lasted for only one season.

WBTV exclusively produced shows for the ABC network until 1962, when &quot;GE True&quot; premiered on CBS.

In 1964, WBTV once again tried to turn a classic film comedy of its own into a sitcom, with &quot;No Time for Sergeants&quot;. Both the sitcom and the 1958 movie were based on the 1955 Broadway play, which starred Andy Griffith (TV&#x27;s &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; also adapted the stage play for TV in 1956). The sitcom starred Sammy Jackson as Will Stockdale, a naive Georgia farm boy drafted into the military. 1965 saw the debut of &quot;F Troop&quot;, a Western spoof taking place at a U.S. Army post after the Civil War. Despite lasting only two seasons, it is still considered a classic of its type. Forrest Tucker, Larry Storch, and Ken Berry led an ensemble cast featuring military misfits, and an Indian tribe, who, among other things, forgot how to do a rain dance.

The streak of identifiable series subsided in 1963 with a halt of using stock company contract players and Jack Webb taking over WBTV and not being particularly successful. However, many series were still filmed at Warner Bros. such as &quot;F Troop&quot; and &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;

=== Later years ===
For four years, from 1967 to 1971, the company&#x27;s lone output was the existing television series &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, by 1970, several of the former talent from 20th Century-Fox Television as well as former agent writers was defected to Warner Bros., such as Paul Monash, Rod Amateau, Bill Idelson and Harvey Miller, Saul Turteltaub and Bernie Orenstein, Jerry Gardner and Dee Caruso, Hal Kanter and A.J. Carothers. By 1971, the company returned to prime-time shows after producing one show for four years. One of the first shows upon returning were the NBC shows &quot;Nichols&quot; and &quot;The Jimmy Stewart Show&quot; and the CBS show &quot;The Chicago Teddy Bears&quot;. Also that year, animation studio Filmation and Warner Bros. entered a deal to produce cartoons for film and television, with its television subsidiary having global distribution rights.

In 1975, the stars of Lynda Carter, Warner Bros. and DC Comics produced the television series &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;. National was purchased by Kinney National Company in 1967 and remained the part of the company until Kinney bought Warner Bros. in 1969. Also that year, the company secured a deal with Bill Carruthers and his production company to develop its game shows and other videotaped programming.

In 1976, the company acquired The Wolper Organization, producer of &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; and &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot;. In 1978, Stan Margulies, who produced &quot;Roots&quot;, signed a three-year exclusive contract with the studio. The following week, Warner had acquired contracts with big names like James Komack, Danny Arnold, the trio of Don Nicholl, Michael Ross and Bernie West (NRW) and the duo of Alan Blye and Bob Einstein to distribute programs worldwide.

In 1979, Warner Bros. Television produced the television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

In 1980, Phillip Saltzman and his Woodruff Productions company signed a deal with the studio.

In 1982, Aaron Spelling and his production company had struck a deal with the studio to distribute the shows. The pact would continue until 1988.

On March 25, 1986, Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System purchased Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) from Kirk Kerkorian for $1.5 billion, and renamed MGM Entertainment Company, Inc. Turner immediately sold MGM&#x27;s United Artists subsidiary back to Kerkorian for roughly $480 million. However, Turner was unable to find financing for the rest of the deal because of concerns in the financial community over the debt-load of his companies; thus, on August 26, 1986, Turner was forced to sell MGM&#x27;s production and distribution assets to UA for $300 million. The MGM lot and lab facilities were sold to Lorimar-Telepictures. Turner kept the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library, along with the Associated Artists Productions library, and the RKO Pictures films that United Artists had previously purchased. Warner Bros. Television has produced new productions based on Turner Entertainment&#x27;s properties.

On June 1, 1986, Alan Shayne has left as president of the studio after 10 years, to start out a new production company, Alan Shayne Productions, which will be affiliated in association with the studio, in order to develop four made-for-TV movies and miniseries projects, which was developed for the 1987–88 season.

Prior to the merge with Time Inc., Warner Communications acquired Lorimar-Telepictures. The acquisition completed on January 12, 1989. Lorimar Television folded into WBTV in July 1993. Telepictures later became a television production company.

In 1992, Witt/Thomas Productions signed a television contract with Warner Bros. after the previous contract with Disney was not renewed. In 1993, two Time Warner-affiliated production companies Quincy Jones Entertainment and David Salzman Entertainment had merged their companies to form Quincy Jones-David Salzman Entertainment, which was affiliated with Warner Bros. and Time Warner. Not too long after that, Lorimar Television was folded into WBTV, taking some key members with them. In 1993, Tom Arnold and Roseanne Barr via Wapello County Productions struck a deal with the studio.

In 1994, writers-producers of &quot;Friends&quot;, Kevin Bright, Martha Kauffman and David Crane, and associated with the studio since 1992 had struck its exclusive deal with the studio. In 1996, Warner Bros. Television collaborated with Universal Television to develop the series &quot;Spy Game&quot; for ABC, with Universal alumnus Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert of Renaissance Pictures, and Warner alumnus John McNamara producing the series, but it did not last long, as it only lasted one season on the air.

In 2001, Warner Bros. Television fully took over distribution of Hanna-Barbera related properties produced by Warner Bros. Animation such as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, producing a steady stream of Scooby-Doo direct-to-video films and two new series, &quot;What&#x27;s New, Scooby-Doo?&quot; (2002–2006) and &quot;Shaggy &amp; Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!&quot; (2006–2008). In 2006, Warner Bros. Television made some of its vast library of programs available for free viewing on the Internet (through sister company AOL&#x27;s IN2TV service), with &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; as its marquee offering. Some of these programs have not been seen publicly since their last syndicated release in the 1980s.

On June 11, 2012, WBTV acquired Alloy Entertainment. On June 2, 2014, Warner Bros. Television Group purchased all of Eyeworks&#x27; companies outside of the United States, rebranding as Warner Bros. International Television Production. Eyeworks USA however, will remain independent.

In 2020, Warner Bros. Television was renamed Warner Bros. Television Studios as part of WarnerMedia&#x27;s restructuring of its television divisions. The Warner Bros. Television name continues to be used on-screen, as well as the company&#x27;s trade name.

On November 30, 2022, WBTV head Channing Dungey announced that they were in talks with Amazon to make animated DC content for its streaming service Amazon Prime Video.

== Divisions ==
In addition to the main Warner Bros. Television Studios label, the company also owns and operates the following production companies in the United States:

The company has only produced one theatrically released film, &quot;The Powerpuff Girls Movie&quot;, distributed by its sister company, Warner Bros.

Warner reestablished its animation division in 1980 to produce &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;–related works, and Turner Broadcasting System (who bought MGM/UA which owned pre-1950 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;/&quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; shorts) merged with Time Warner (later called WarnerMedia) in 1996. It replaces Warner Bros. Cartoons and Warner Bros. Feature Animation; since March 2001, it also replaces Hanna-Barbera as well.

In recent years, Warner Bros. Animation has focused primarily on producing television and direct-to-video animation featuring characters Looney Tunes, Scooby-Doo, Tom and Jerry, Animaniacs, and Superman and Batman created by other properties owned by Warner Bros., including DC Comics, the MGM cartoon studio (via Turner Entertainment Co.) and Hanna-Barbera Productions.

==== Warner Bros. Kids, Young Adults and Classics ====

Warner Bros. Kids, Young Adults and Classics (KYAC; often known as Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics), formerly known as Warner Bros.

On March 4, 2019, AT&amp;T announced a major reorganization of WarnerMedia to effectively dissolve the Turner Broadcasting System division, which involved Cartoon Network, Boomerang, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, and digital media company Otter Media being transferred to Warner Bros. Entertainment. Aside from TCM and Otter – which was transferred over to WarnerMedia Entertainment on May 31, 2019, to oversee development on an upcoming over-the-top streaming service from WarnerMedia – the newly transferred properties came under a newly formed Global Kids &amp; Young Adults division.

The division was responsible for overseeing the parent company&#x27;s family, kids, animation, and young adult properties, its properties include the former Turner Broadcasting System cable television networks Cartoon Network (including the programming blocks Adult Swim, Toonami, Cartoonito, and ACME Night), Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies; and the animation studios Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios and Williams Street.

On April 7, 2020, Tom Ascheim was named president of the division, now renamed Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics, overseeing Cartoon Network, Boomerang and Adult Swim, and adding Turner Classic Movies to his oversight.

On May 11, 2022, Tom Ascheim exited as President of KYAC due to Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s leadership restructuring the organization and eliminating his role. The studios were moved under Warner Bros. Television while Kathleen Finch&#x27;s U.S. Networks Group assumed oversight over the linear networks, effectively dissolving the unit.

<text>Claude Fayette Bragdon (August 1, 1866 – 1946) was an American architect, writer, and stage designer based in Rochester, New York, up to World War I, then in New York City.

The designer of Rochester’s New York Central Railroad terminal (1909–13) and Chamber of Commerce (1915–17), as well as many other public buildings and private residences, Bragdon enjoyed a national reputation as an architect working in the progressive tradition associated with Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Along with members of the Prairie School and other regional movements, these architects developed new approaches to the planning, design, and ornamentation of buildings that embraced industrial techniques and building types while reaffirming democratic traditions threatened by the rise of urban mass society. In numerous essays and books, Bragdon argued that only an “organic architecture” based on nature could foster a democratic community in an industrial capitalist society.

==Biography==
Bragdon was born in Oberlin, Ohio. He was raised in Watertown, Oswego, Dansville and Rochester, New York, where his father worked as a newspaper editor. After working for architects in Rochester, New York City, and Buffalo, Bragdon went into practice in Rochester. His major buildings include the city&#x27;s New York Central Railroad Station, the Rochester First Universalist Church, Bevier Memorial Building, Shingleside, and the Rochester Italian Presbyterian Church, among many others. At Oswego he designed the Oswego Yacht Club. He designed an addition to the Romanta T. Miller House in 1914.

While Bragdon&#x27;s early work reflected the revival of Renaissance architecture associated with the City Beautiful, he soon became a leading participant in the arts and crafts movement, working with Harvey Ellis, Gustav Stickley, and other arts and crafts artists. Around 1900, Bragdon embraced the ideas of Louis Sullivan and began to reorient his work toward the midwestern ideal of a progressive architecture based on nature. However, his version of organic architecture reflected different social and cultural values than those of Sullivan or Bragdon&#x27;s contemporary Frank Lloyd Wright. Whereas for Sullivan and Wright a building was most organic when it expressed the individual character of its creator, Bragdon saw individualism as a hindrance to the formation of a consensual democratic culture. Accordingly, he promoted regular geometry and musical proportion as ways for architects to harmonize buildings with one another and with their urban context. From 1900 until he closed his architectural practice during World War I, Bragdon applied these principles to his buildings, and he continued to use them through the 1920s in both graphic designs and the theatrical sets he created during a second career as a New York stage designer.

Bragdon was well regarded for his ink rendering talent, his many very successful designs for both residential and institutional buildings, and his inventive geometric ornament. His most important contribution to both architectural modernism and progressive reform came in 1915 with his creation of a new ornamental vocabulary he called “projective ornament.” Projective ornament was a system for generating geometric patterns that could be adapted for use in architecture, the fine and decorative arts, and graphic design. Basing ornament on mathematical patterns abstracted from nature, Bragdon created a universal form-language to replace the variety of historical and national styles, which provided designers and clients with a vocabulary for articulating differences of class, culture, gender, nationality, and religion. By showing how his repertory of patterns could be adapted to any kind of design problem, Bragdon aimed to integrate not only architecture, art, and design, but also his divided society.

Bragdon&#x27;s ornament appeared in the Rochester Chamber of Commerce (1915–17), as well as in the design of magazines, posters, and books. It spread throughout the region through its use in a series of Festivals of Song and Light that Bragdon staged with community music reformers from 1915 to 1918 in Rochester, Buffalo, Syracuse, and New York. These nocturnal community chorus festivals incorporated ornamental lamps and decorations into massive public events that drew tens of thousands of spectator-participants. Through its role in both civic architecture and print media, projective ornament began to integrate these distinct realms into a single public sphere visually unified by geometric pattern.

In 1917, after a dispute with photography magnate George Eastman (of Eastman Kodak fame) over the design of the Rochester Chamber of Commerce Building, Bragdon&#x27;s architectural practice waned. He incorporated his own design of the hypercube in the structure of the building. He moved to New York City in 1923 and became a stage designer, and remained in New York until his death in 1946. In 1925, knowing Alfred Stieglitz and having been introduced to Margaret Lefranc (Frankel), an eighteen-year-old American studying in Paris and Berlin, Bragdon took her to Stieglitz to show her art. Bragdon and Lefranc remained friends for the remainder of his life while his influences rounded out her education. In his books on architectural theory, &quot;The Beautiful Necessity&quot; (1910), &quot;Architecture and Democracy&quot; (1918), and &quot;The Frozen Fountain&quot; (1932), he advocated a theosophical approach to building design, urging an &quot;organic&quot; Gothic style (which he thought of as reflective of the natural order) over the &quot;arranged&quot; Beaux-Arts architecture of the classical revival.

He had yet another overlapping career as an author of books on spiritual topics, including Eastern religions. These books include &quot;Old Lamps for New&quot; (1925), &quot;Delphic Woman&quot; (1925), &quot;The Eternal Poles&quot; (1931), &quot;Four Dimensional Vistas&quot; (1930), and &quot;An Introduction to Yoga&quot; (1933). His autobiography &quot;More Lives Than One&quot; (1938) alludes to both his belief in reincarnation and his varied career paths.

In 1920, he helped translate and publish P.D. Ouspensky&#x27;s &quot;Tertium Organum&quot;, for which he also wrote an introduction to the English translation.

Bragdon’s work fell out of favor in the 1930s as American architects and clients embraced International Style modernism. But it left an ongoing legacy as younger architects—in particular Buckminster Fuller, who adapted some of Bragdon’s ideas and designs—found new ways of using geometric pattern to promote architectural and social integration.

<doc id="1051669" wikidata="Q2031736" url="?curid=1051669" title="Walid Shoebat">
<text>Walid Shoebat () is a Palestinian American speaker, author and a critic of Islam. He was born in the West Bank to an American mother, and converted to Christianity from Islam. Shoebat has claimed to be an ex-PLO terrorist in a CNN television interview. He is a self-proclaimed expert on the dangers of Islam and is also a strong supporter of the State of Israel. Shoebat has also claimed that he firebombed the Israeli bank Bank Leumi; however, after thoroughly investigating this claim, reporters and officials have found no evidence of any attack on the bank in 1979.

==Early life==
According to the biography on his official website, Shoebat was born in Bethlehem, the grandson of the Mukhtar of Beit Sahour, whom Shoebat describes as an associate of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammad Amin al-Husayni. Shoebat said that he joined the Palestine Liberation Organization in his youth, and also says he was involved in an attack against an Israeli bank. There was no evidence for Shoebat&#x27;s claims when investigated by journalists.

According to Shoebat, upon his release, he continued his anti-Israeli activism until going to the United States, where he became involved with the Arab Student Organization at Loop College in Chicago. Shortly afterwards Shoebat worked as a software engineer and became a US citizen. Shoebat says he converted to Christianity in 1993.

==Career as activist, author and speaker==
In 2004 and again in 2006, Shoebat was denied entrance to Canada on security grounds due to his self-described affiliation with the Palestine Liberation Organization. He had been scheduled to speak in Ottawa at an event organized by the Simon Wiesenthal Center; Zachariah Anani spoke in Shoebat&#x27;s place.

Showbat was a frequent, if controversial, public speaker on terrorism and Islam in the 2000s.

Shoebat has been introduced as a terrorism expert on several television programs, including appearances on CNN and its sister network HLN in 2006 and 2007. However, CNN points out that Shoebat makes errors in his presentation, including his assertion that the Transportation Security Administration could have prevented the September 11 attacks, even though the TSA was not created until after the attacks.

He is the author of three self-published books.

===Books===
* &quot;Why I Left Jihad: The Root of Terrorism and the Return of Radical Islam&quot;, 2005
* &quot;Why We Want to Kill You: The Jihadist Mindset and How to Defeat it&quot;, 2007
* &quot;God&#x27;s War on Terror: Islam, Prophecy and the Bible&quot;, with Joel Richardson, 2008

==Personal views==
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, Shoebat claims that he became an active advocate against Islamism and a strong supporter of the State of Israel. Shoebat is the founder of the Walid Shoebat Foundation, an organization that claims to &quot;fight for the Jewish people&quot;. He is sometimes paid for his appearances and solicits donations for the foundation. He says he formed the foundation to educate Americans as to why the US should support Israel. Shoebat has said that he believes &quot;in a Greater Israel that includes Judea and Samaria, and by this I mean a Jewish state&quot;. He regards the Gaza Strip as Jewish by right and believes Israel should retake the territory saying, &quot;If a Jew has no right to Gaza, then he has no right to Jaffa or Haifa either.&quot; He advocates that Israel deport anyone who denies its right to exist, &quot;even if they were born there&quot;.

Shoebat gives lectures to local police departments regarding his belief that &quot;most Muslims seek to impose Sharia in the United States. To prevent this, he said in an interview, he warns officers that &#x27;you need to look at the entire pool of Muslims in a community.&#x27;&quot; According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;When Shoebat spoke to the first annual South Dakota Fusion Center Conference in Sioux Falls ... he told them to monitor Muslim student groups and local mosques and, if possible, tap their phones. &#x27;You can find out a lot of information that way,&#x27; he said.&quot;

Shoebat argues that parallels exist between radical Islam and Nazism. He says, &quot;Secular dogma like Nazism is less dangerous than Islamofascism that we see today ... because Islamofascism has a religious twist to it; it says &#x27;God the Almighty ordered you to do this&#x27; ... It is trying to grow itself in fifty-five Muslim states. So potentially, you could have a success rate of several Nazi Germanys, if these people get their way.&quot;

==Criticism==

On April 9, 2008, Shoebat responded to the earlier &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;″s report on that paper&#x27;s op-ed page. He wrote that the &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot; had been duped. According to him, the sources who disputed his own account of his upbringing (including his relatives) were themselves involved in terrorism. He said they want to see him discredited, probably because of his conversion to Christianity. He also states that reputable witnesses who could confirm the bombing operation of Bank Leumi were not interviewed.

On July 13, 2011, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; reported an investigative piece into Walid Shoebat&#x27;s claim to authority based on being a former terrorist. The report found that according to Israeli government officials, the bank that Walid Shoebat claimed to have attacked, and his own relatives, no record of his supposed terrorist history existed. Another of Shoebat&#x27;s claims, that of a two-week term in an Israeli jail, was also unsubstantiated, with Israel having no record he was ever jailed. His cousin, interviewed in the report, stated that he had never known Shoebat to have ties to any movement, and that his claims of being a former terrorist were &quot;for his own personal reasons&quot;. According to CNN, their reporters in the United States, Israel and the Palestinian territories found no evidence to support Shoebat&#x27;s claims and &quot;neither Shoebat nor his business partner provided any proof of Shoebat&#x27;s involvement in terrorism&quot;.

Omar Sacirbey&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article reports that Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American–Islamic Relations, has questioned Shoebat&#x27;s motives, saying that &quot;Ergun Caner, Shoebat, and Kamal Saleem—along with others like them—belong to an &#x27;industry&#x27; that is often perpetuated by fundamentalist Christians&quot; and that people are doing this &quot;to make money or get converts or to get some personal benefit&quot;. The article also reports that skeptics have questioned how Shoebat and others have been able to retain US citizenship if their stories of terrorist activities are true.

===Charitable organization status===

When the &quot;Post&quot; asked Shoebat whether the Walid Shoebat Foundation is a registered charity, he said that it was registered in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Attorney General&#x27;s Charitable Trusts and Organizations Section said it had no record of such a charity. When asked again, Shoebat said it was registered under a different name, but that he was not aware of the Foundation&#x27;s registered name, nor any other details, which were known only to his manager. Dr. Joel Fishman of the Allegheny County Law Library in Pennsylvania expressed doubts about Walid Shoebat Foundation&#x27;s donation process. He noted that if the money was being given to a registered charity, the charity would have to make annual reports to the state and federal government.

==Family==
He is the father of author Theodore Shoebat, known for his extreme anti-LGBT views.

<text>The Saudi Arabian National Guard (SANG), also known as the White Army, is one of the three major branches of the military forces of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The national guard is under the administrative control of the Ministry of National Guard, instead of the Ministry of Defence. It differs from the regular Saudi Arabian Army in being forged out of tribal elements loyal to the House of Saud and tasked with protecting the royal family from internal dangers such as a coup d&#x27;état.

==Organisation and roles==

The Saudi Arabian National Guard has a standing force of 125,000 troops and a tribal militia of some 28,000 Fouj (tribal levies). It serves both as a defence force against external attack and an internal security force. Its duties include protecting the Saudi ruling family, guarding against military coups, safeguarding strategic facilities and resources, and providing security for the cities of Mecca and Medina.

It reports directly to the king through the Minister of the National Guard and, unlike the army, navy and air force, is not under the control of the Ministry of Defense. The Guard&#x27;s command structure and communication network are entirely separate from those of the Ministries of Defense and the Interior.

Its personnel are drawn from tribes loyal to the king and the royal family, whose high-ranking members are always appointed its commander. It has been described as an institution that &quot;ties the tribes to the House of Saud&quot; (by Sandra Mackey). It also draws recruits from official Wahhabi religious establishment.
 It differs from the army in that its officers command units (e.g. battalions) &quot;largely made up of their own tribal cousins, which makes the leaders and their followers less susceptible to subversive ideas and outside ideologies.&quot;

According to journalist John R. Bradley, its leaders and their followers are &#x27;supposed to have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.&quot; The force was extensively reorganised and retrained by the Vinnell Corporation (using over a thousand US Vietnam War veterans) in the 1980s. The United States&#x27; support for the SANG has been delivered both through private contractors and the U.S. army&#x27;s Office of the Program Manager, Saudi Arabian National Guard Modernization Program.

==History==

The SANG was founded as the successor to the Ikhwan, the tribal army of King Abdulaziz. The Ikhwan had helped King Abdulaziz conquer the Arabian Peninsula and take it from the Hashimites in World War I. However, the Ikhwan committed many excesses and atrocities not just on the Hejazi Army but on other Arabs as well. The various tribal groups of the Ikhwan also had a tendency to go off and do their own things and thus needed to be brought under a more centralised control. The SANG acquired its moniker of the &quot;White Army&quot; during this period due to its wearing of traditional Arab dress instead of Western-style military uniforms. In 1954, the office of Jihad and Mujahidin was transformed into the modern National Guard. It was called White Army until 1963 when a British military mission reorganized it.

Training of the National Guard became the responsibility of the US Vinnell corporation in 1975. About 1,000 United States Vietnam veterans were initially recruited to serve in the long-term training program designed to convert the guard into a mobile and hard-hitting counterinsurgency force that could also reinforce the regular army if necessary. These contractors were supervised by a United States military group with the designation Office of the Program Manager—Saudi Arabian National Guard (OPM-SANG).

Extensive military infrastructure facilities have been built to ensure the comfort and well-being of national guard units. Their major cantonments were in Al-Ahsa Oasis near Al-Hufuf and the major oil installations of the Eastern Province and at Al-Qasim in the Nejd, in an area where many of the tribal elements were recruited and most training was conducted. A large new housing project for guard personnel, with associated schools, shops, and mosques, has been constructed near Riyadh, also the site of the guard&#x27;s military academy, the King Khalid Military College. Other National Guard military cities were located at At-Ta&#x27;if, Dammam, and Jeddah, while a new headquarters complex was built in Riyadh in the early 1980s.

During the 1950s and early 1960s, the regular army and the national guard were both small and of roughly equal strength. The guard suffered when the army&#x27;s expansion was given priority, but in the 1970s the decline was reversed when the guard was converted to a light mechanized force with the help of United States advisers. Initially consisting of four combined arms battalions, the active-duty component had by 1992 been enlarged to two mechanized brigades, each with four infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and engineering and signals companies. The guard&#x27;s mobility over desert terrain was assured by 1,100 Commando V-150 armoured cars. Firepower came from 105 mm and 155 mm towed howitzers, 106 mm recoilless rifles, 90mm guns and BGM-71 TOW platforms. In the 1990s, the V-150s were replaced in the mechanized battalions with over LAV-25 Family of Vehicles bought from DDGM/GD in Canada.

The second component of the national guard, made up of tribal battalions under the command of local sheikhs, was organised into four infantry brigades (called the Fowj). These men, often the sons of local chiefs or of veterans of the original Ikhwan forces, reported for duty about once a month for the purpose of receiving stipends. They were provided with Heckler &amp; Koch G3 rifles, although many had individually acquired AK-47s and other automatic weapons. They also have radios and are equipped with Toyota pickup trucks or Land Rovers. Many units are stationed along the borders of the Kingdom and have the mission to patrol the border areas. Although neither particularly well trained nor well equipped, they could be counted on to be loyal to the House of Saud if called for service. Their enrollment in the guard was largely a means to bolster the subsidies paid to local shaykhs and to retain the support of their tribes.

The national guard&#x27;s King Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade was swiftly deployed to the border area after Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and was actively engaged in the war, notably in the fighting to retake the town of Ra&#x27;s al Khafji. After the war ended, it was reported that an enlargement of the national guard to eleven or twelve active brigades was contemplated. In addition, the ageing Commandos were to be replaced by more than 1,000 eight-wheeled LAV-25s and LAV variants manufactured by General Motors in Canada. The LAVs were to be mounted with a variety of armaments, such as 25 mm autocannon, larger-calibre 90 mm guns, 120mm mortars and TOW missile launchers.

==Command==
The Saudi Arabian National Guard&#x27;s communications and chain of command maintained a separate network from regular Saudi Arabian military channels with a senior member of the royal family as its head. This structure was established by King Saud in 1956. Prior to 1956 the Guard was led by tribal sheikhs. Following the 1956 reorganization the first royal, Khalid bin Saud who was King Saud&#x27;s son, was assigned to command the Guard in July 1957. In 1959 Saad bin Saud, another son of King Saud, became the commander.

King Abdullah commanded SANG for four decades, from 1962 until 17 November 2010 when he appointed his son, Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, as the new commander. In addition, three of his sons hold high positions within the organization. SANG&#x27;s Deputy Commander was Prince Badr until 2010, who was a senior member of the Al Saud. Prince Mutaib was later arrested because of corruption and was imprisoned for a few months. Its general headquarters, located in Riyadh, directly controlled the three regional sectors and the training facilities and the King Abdulaziz Independent Mechanized Brigade of four battalions.

The three regional (eastern, central, and western) sectors each command one or more mechanized or motorized brigades, several independent Security and Military Police and logistical battalions, but also the irregular &quot;fowj&quot; battalions.

==Structure==
The SANG was restructured with the help of the Vinnell Corporation into a light mechanized force equipped with over a thousand Cadillac Gage Commando armored fighting vehicles (replaced with LAV-25s in the 1990s). Its mobile force consisted of three mechanized brigades and five motorized infantry brigades. The militia portion consists of around 24 battalions of &quot;fowj&quot;, tribal warriors on &quot;retainer&quot;.

==Brigades==
The twenty one SANG brigades include:
* King Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade (KAAMB), the second of the original mechanized brigades formed in the late 1970s with Cadillac-Gage V-150 vehicles. These were replaced in the 1990s by the more-capable LAV series of tactical vehicles. This was also the brigade that fought at the Battle of Khafji. Its reported garrison in early 1991 was Al Hofuf.
* King Faisal Light Infantry Brigade (KFB) based in Medina
* King Khalid Light Infantry Brigade&#x27;s strength is unknown
* Prince Mohammad bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud Light Infantry Brigade
* Imam Muhammad bin Saud Mechanized Brigade (IMBSMB) the first of two mechanized brigades created in the late 1970s with Cadillac-Gage V-150 vehicles. These were replaced in the 1990s by the more-capable LAV series of tactical vehicles. 
* Prince Saad bin Abdul Rahman Mechanized Brigade (PSARMB)was formed in the late 1990s and equipped with LAV series of tactical vehicles
* Prince Turki bin Abdulaziz Mechanized Brigade (PTAMB) was formed by 2006 and equipped with LAV series of tactical vehicles
* King Saud Light Infantry Brigade (KSB) based in Jeddah
* Omar bin Khattab light infantry brigade based in al-Taif

The two original motorized brigades, IMBSMB and KAAMB, had V-150 Commando armored cars, M‑102 howitzers (IMBS) and 155 mm M‑198 howitzers, plus TOW anti-tank guided missile systems in the anti-tank platoons of the line motorized companies; two in each company in the IMBS and six in the KAAB. The two brigades each had a headquarters company, four-line motorized battalions, a field artillery battalion, a support battalion, and air defense, signals, and engineers companies.

===Independent battalions===
* In addition to the battalions under the control of the three regional headquarters, SANG has four independent light infantry battalions, which appear to be dedicated to protecting facilities and installations


===Tribal militia===
The second component of the national guard is the &quot;Fowj&quot; (Arabic:فَيْج (also fayj) &quot;legman, courier; company&quot;), made up of Bedouin tribal (militia) battalions under the command of local sheikhs. These men, often the sons of local chiefs or of veterans of the original Ikhwan forces, reported for duty about once a month for the purpose of receiving stipends. They were provided with obsolete rifles, although many had individually acquired Kalashnikov assault rifles. Although neither particularly well trained nor well equipped, they could be counted on to be loyal to the House of Saud if called for service. Their enrollment in the guard is largely a means to bolster the subsidies paid to local sheikhs and to retain the support of their tribes. The Fowj is currently organized into 27 battalions with approximately 27,000 men.

==Uniforms==
Uniforms worn by personnel of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s national guard are closely patterned on the British and United States models that influenced them during their early development. The most common uniform colors are khaki or olive drab. Officers had semidress uniforms for various functions and dress uniforms for formal occasions. All personnel wear berets, and officers also have peaked caps.

When in modern uniforms personnel wear a red beret. British three color British Desert pattern DPM used throughout the Middle East, American Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU), used in Iraq and other desert regions throughout the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions. Some units still wear the American Desert Battle Dress Uniform of which a Saudi grey variant is worn by SANG security guards. 
These are being replaced by several new digital or pixelated camouflage designs with an embedded Saudi Arabian National Guard crest. National guardsmen often wear the traditional red-checkered keffiyeh Arab headdress. Tribal units often wear the thawb with crossed bandoliers.

==Equipment==

The SANG is not, by tradition, issued equipment not used by the regular military; it does not possess any tanks but has several thousand wheeled armored fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers. It possesses its own helicopters and light aircraft and all the remaining types of military hardware including artillery.

A$2.2 billion foreign military sale contract delivered 724 LAV‑II 8×8 wheeled armored personnel carriers in ten different varieties in 2001.

In December 2012, the Saudi National Guard ordered 68 French Multi-Purpose Combat Vehicle (MPCV) air-defense vehicles.
In September 2014, 24 Boeing AH-6i Little Bird light attack and reconnaissance helicopters were ordered from Boeing with deliveries to begin in 2016.

<text>CityNews is the title of news and current affairs programming on Rogers Sports &amp; Media&#x27;s Citytv network in Canada. The newscast division was founded on September 28, 1975 as CityPulse as a standalone local newscast on the network&#x27;s Toronto station owned by CHUM Limited. Through the acquisitions of the Edmonton, Winnipeg and Calgary A-Channel stations in 2004, it was relaunched under the CityNews brand on August 2, 2005 and later expanded to Montreal in 2012. The remaining Citytv stations airs the news headlines segments during each station&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; morning show.

Before the 2017–2018 relaunch of CityNews nationally, Citytv stations outside Toronto had their midday and evening news programs cancelled in 2006, and the remaining news programming on these stations (such as the nationally-broadcast &quot;CityNews International&quot;) was cancelled in early 2010.

After a soft launch in 2020 via CIWW/CJET-FM Ottawa, in June 2021 Rogers extended the &quot;CityNews&quot; branding to its news radio stations.

==&quot;CityNews&quot; Toronto==
===History===
The newscast was broadcast in Toronto as CityPulse as a pilot episode on September 28, 1975, and as a second pilot episode on September 12, 1976. The first regular episode of &quot;CityPulse&quot; aired on September 12, 1977. CITY-TV&#x27;s newscasts aired under the &quot;CityPulse&quot; title for the final time on August 1, 2005, and were rebranded as &quot;CityNews&quot; the following day. While the station claims that it was the first news show to abandon the traditional anchor desk, CBS News in the United States had done this as early as the 1950s under Edward R. Murrow. Its main innovation in television news was to have its reporters play a more participatory role in their stories. Elements of it were also taken from then-sister station ATV in the Maritimes, whose &quot;Live at 5&quot; newscast, launched in 1982, had lead anchor Dave Wright roaming around the ATV newsroom and talking with the reporters.

By the mid-1980s, the newscast&#x27;s style, pioneered by Moses Znaimer, was promoted as a &quot;format&quot; for local news shows to copy around North America. The show has been duplicated by other television stations owned by CHUM Limited and its format has been licensed to several television stations around the world, such as Citytv Barcelona and Citytv Bogotá. Other attempts to clone the format with regional changes have also been attempted; notably, two American attempts at a &quot;CityPulse&quot;-style newscast debuted within months of each other in 1993: KCOP-TV in Los Angeles with &quot;13 Real News&quot;, and KIRO-TV in Seattle with what was dubbed &quot;News Outside the Box&quot; (the latter station attempted to leverage its then-sister radio stations as well). Both attempts failed and by 1994 both stations had reverted to &quot;traditional&quot; newscasts.

Until 1987, the anchors on &quot;CityPulse&quot; sat behind an anchor desk in a dark studio with two orange-red-black striped beams and a television set between the two anchors. &quot;CityPulse at Six&quot; was anchored by Gord Martineau and Dini Petty for most of the years from 1980 to 1987. Weather presenters during that era included CHUM Radio veteran Jay Nelson, Brian Hill, Greg Rist, and David Onley. Sports anchors included Jim McKenny, Russ Salzberg, John Saunders, Debbie Van Kiekebelt, and Ann Rohmer.

&quot;CityPulse Tonight&quot;, known as &quot;CityPulse News at 10&quot; prior to 1981, was anchored by Bill Cameron, later by Gord Martineau, and then Anne Mroczkowski. In 1987, Mroczkowski moved to the supper-hour show to co-anchor with Martineau. J.D. (John) Roberts began his news anchoring career as anchor of &quot;CityPulse Tonight&quot; after several years as an entertainment reporter and MuchMusic video jockey.

On May 4, 1987, &quot;CityPulse&quot; moved into a newsroom set at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto along with the other station operations, from 99 Queen Street East. After the move, &quot;CityPulse&quot; began to move the anchors away from a central desk, positioning them around the newsroom (such as the assignment desk, equipped with police radios, banks of monitors, and perhaps the most unique feature, a map of Toronto with blinking lights indicating major highways, positioned behind a large glass wall, allowing the anchors to draw on the glass with markers to indicate the locations of stories and incidents), or walking through the newsroom.

From 1987 to 1989, Dini Petty anchored &quot;CityWide&quot; at 5:30 pm.

Hourly news update segments, akin to the &quot;24-Hour News Source&quot; format popular in the US at the time, were introduced in the early 1990s, initially to cover the Gulf War (known as &quot;Gulfwatch&quot;). The updates were refined into a regular feature after the end of the war. These were branded as &quot;CityPulse (Overnight) NewsFlashes&quot;, for shorter updates (typically a shot of the darkened newsroom, followed by shots of area traffic cameras; a ticker would display one or two headlines, sports scores, a weather forecast, and/or the time of the next update; the sounds of the newsroom and/or a police scanner would be heard underneath), or as simply &quot;CityPulse Updates&quot;, for longer updates anchored by a CityPulse reporter (often Kevin Frankish) from the assignment desk, who, in a unique twist, would operate the camera themselves via a control device. From 1998 until the 2000s, CITY produced &quot;CityLive&quot; simulcasted with its new news channel CablePulse24.
By March 2008, &quot;CityNews&quot; Toronto was struggling in the ratings, coming in third (with an average of 100,000 viewers) after CTV (326,000 viewers) and Global (126,000). On January 21, 2008, &quot;CityLive&quot; was relaunched as &quot;CityNews at 5&quot;, drawing a scant 1% share of the Toronto market at 5 p.m.

In July 2008, Rogers filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a separate 24-hour news station to be affiliated with Citytv Toronto, and to be known as CityNews (Toronto). The application was approved on December 10, 2008. The new station was in direct competition with CP24 which was launched on October 3, 2011, as CityNews Channel.

In December 2008, Citytv laid off the entire &quot;CityNews Entertainment&quot; unit. Entertainment reporters Larysa Harapyn and Liz West were released, and entertainment stories were then read by the anchors.

In September 2009, Citytv moved into its current newsroom at 33 Dundas Street East (Yonge-Dundas Square) in Downtown Toronto.

On January 19, 2010, &quot;CityNews at Noon&quot;, &quot;CityOnline&quot; and &quot;CityNews at Five&quot; were cancelled as part of layoffs and restructuring within the Citytv stations. Many long-time &quot;CityNews&quot; on-air personalities, including Anne Mroczkowski and Laura DiBattista, were let go.

Citytv Toronto reinstated the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts on Saturday and Sunday evenings on March 5, 2011, with Pam Seatle anchoring the 6 p.m. newscast, and Melanie Ng anchoring at 11 p.m. On September 5, 2011, Citytv Toronto also reinstated &quot;CityNews at Five&quot; with anchors Francis D&#x27;Souza, Tom Hayes, and Avery Haines. The following day on September 6, 2011, &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on all five of Citytv&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations expanded to three-and-a-half hours, from 5:30-9 a.m. Avery Haines then left &quot;CityNews at Five&quot; to start a segment called &quot;The Inside Story&quot; that features on Tuesdays and Thursdays on &quot;CityNews at Six&quot;.

On August 13, 2012, CITY-TV expanded its nightly 11 p.m. newscast, &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot;, from 30 minutes to one hour.

In 2015, the station changed the format of its evening newscasts, removing the in-studio anchor and having all stories presented by videojournalists on the field. The reduced cost format is designed to appeal to younger viewers with a more &quot;raw&quot; presentation, and appeal to increased trust in the reporters and their journalism.

===&quot;CityNews&quot; on CP24===
From its launch in 1998 until 2008, &quot;CityNews&quot; and local cable news channel, CP24 were a combined operation sharing the same newsroom and studio space at 299 Queen Street West. CP24 simulcasted Citytv news programs such as &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; and &quot;CityNews&quot;. CP24 also reran most &quot;CityNews&quot; programming immediately after it was done airing live. At that time, CP24 was jointly owned by CHUM Limited and Sun Media, who owned the channel until 2004.

In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia and now Bell Media) announced a bid to purchase Citytv/CP24&#x27;s parent company, CHUM Limited. A year later, the CRTC approved the sale on the condition that the Citytv stations be sold. Shortly after, the sale of Citytv stations to Rogers Communications was finalized.

For a short period, things remained the same; Citytv anchors continued to anchor and contribute to CP24 and shows were simulcast between the two channels until CTV/Rogers announced the restructuring of its employees between to two channels beginning in November 2007, such as the hiring of new CP24-only and &quot;CityNews&quot;-only personalities.

In November 2008, CP24 moved most of its operations from its original newsroom, shared with Citytv, to a new state-of-the-art newsroom on the second floor with windows facing Queen Street West and at the same time CP24 unveiled a new look to its on-screen format. CP24 continued to simulcast &quot;CityNews&quot; programming up until December 10, 2008, when CTV pulled almost all Citytv news programming with the exception of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;. That night, &quot;CTV News at Six&quot; replaced &quot;CityNews at Six&quot;, which had remained in place since the channel began broadcasting in 1998. Critics had speculated that the latter change was due to the CRTC&#x27;s approval of Citytv Toronto planning on launching CityNews Channel. One of the final ties was severed on March 26, 2009, when CP24 dropped its simulcast of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; and launched its own morning show, &quot;CP24 Breakfast&quot;.

Following the layoffs at the Citytv stations announced on January 19, 2010, CP24 extended its &quot;Live at 5&quot; broadcast from 15 minutes to 30, and also launched another half-hour newscast, &quot;Live at 5:30&quot;. The show was featured a CP24 personality that hosted both &quot;Live at 5&quot; and &quot;Live at 5:30&quot;; having interviews and updating Toronto on what is happening in the city. In addition, two other CP24 anchors would host the show, one co-hosting at 5pm and the other co-hosting at 5:30pm, bringing Toronto&#x27;s Top Stories. By July 2012, &quot;Live at 5&quot; and &quot;Live at 5:30&quot; were brought back to the regular CP24 news format and with just one anchor 5pm and one anchor for 5:30pm.

===&quot;CityNews&quot; Weather===
&quot;CityNews&quot; is the only newscast in Canada that operates its own weather monitoring stations across the Greater Toronto Area. In addition to 20 weather stations, &quot;CityNews&quot; introduced a CityNews Weather LiveEye, a mobile unit that can monitor the weather anywhere.

On June 21, 2007, &quot;CityNews&quot; launched &quot;CityNews&quot; Weather Online, a desktop program that is more convenient than accessing their website. The program includes features to alert the user when a weather watch or warning is issued.

In November 2008, &quot;CityNews&quot; launched &quot;CityNews&quot; Weather Webcast, which are video weather forecasts recorded each day by one of the weather team members.

===&quot;CityNews&quot; Webcast===
On February 14, 2007, &quot;CityNews&quot; created the &quot;CityNews&quot; Webcast, a downloadable news podcast based in Toronto. There are three Webcasts uploaded on weekdays: in the morning, presented by Kevin Frankish from &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;; in the afternoon, presented by &quot;CityNews at Six&quot; anchor Gord Martineau; and the final Webcast in the evening, presented by the anchor hosting &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot;.

===Theme music and opens===
The &quot;CityPulse&quot; newscast originally began with the instrumental version of &quot;Masterpiece&quot; by The Temptations. In 1979, it was changed to a rendition of &quot;Gonna Fly Now&quot; by Maynard Ferguson; the theme was remixed and rearranged well into the 2000s. The theme for &quot;CityPulse Tonight&quot; continued to be &quot;Masterpiece&quot; until the early 1980s. From 1985 until 1994, &quot;Pentatus&quot; by Graham Shaw was used as the theme music for &quot;CityPulse Tonight&quot;. The current theme is a custom-composed music piece.

==&quot;CityNews Channel&quot; and &quot;CityNews 24/7&quot;==

On May 30, 2011, Rogers Media announced plans to launch a digital cable specialty channel licensed as a Category B service with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission called CityNews Channel, a 24-hour news network based in Toronto that would bring together resources from a number of Rogers-owned news and media properties, including Citytv Toronto, 680 News radio, and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. The channel featured &quot;an enriched and interactive screen format,&quot; likely similar to that of Bell Media&#x27;s CP24, the channel&#x27;s main competitor.

CityNews Channel was launched on October 3, 2011, using the same news wheel format as 680News, with traffic and weather reports on the :1s, sports news at :15 and :45 and business news at :26 and :56 past the hour. The channel&#x27;s anchors were rotated depending on the time period. Rolling news programming aired weekdays from 9:30 a.m. – 5 p.m., weekends from 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. and nightly from 7–11 p.m. ET; all Citytv Toronto news programming is simulcast on the channel (including weekday morning news/talk program &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; and nightly 11 p.m. newscast &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot;, which both feature an additional half-hour seen exclusively on CityNews Channel); an audio simulcast of 680News featuring live traffic camera feeds throughout Toronto also runs from 1-5:30 a.m. weeknights and midnight – 7 a.m. weekends.

Beginning April 14, 2012, Citytv Toronto ran a simulcast of CityNews Channel&#x27;s weekend morning news programming every Saturday morning from 7–8 a.m. and Sunday mornings from 7–9 a.m. The channel abruptly ceased operations at 9 a.m. on May 30, 2013. 

CityNews Channel was revived as CityNews 24/7 in 2022, this time as a streaming channel, similar to those offered online by Global News. The channel is operated in Toronto and West versions, and carried via the CityNews digital platforms, as well as Rogers&#x27; Amazon Prime Video Channels service Citytv+.

==&quot;CityNews&quot; in other markets==
&quot;CityPulse&quot; was launched in Vancouver in 2002 when CKVU-TV was rebranded as &quot;Citytv Vancouver&quot;. With the expansion of Citytv from two to five stations in August 2005, the newscasts on all five Citytv stations were renamed &quot;CityNews&quot;.

On July 12, 2006, coincident with the announcement of CTVglobemedia&#x27;s plans to take over CHUM Limited, all prime-time &quot;CityNews&quot; programs, with the exception of those on CITY in Toronto, were immediately cancelled, with 281 CHUM employees across the country laid off. On CKAL Calgary and CKEM Edmonton, &quot;CityNews at Six&quot; and &quot;CityNews Tonight&quot; was replaced with a new half-hour newsmagazine called &quot;Your City&quot;. CHMI Winnipeg had been slated to launch its own version in January 2007 according to a news release, but it never materialized. CKVU&#x27;s newscasts were not replaced, although a noon newscast based on the &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; format called &quot;Lunch Television&quot; was launched in early 2009. City&quot;News at Noon&quot; in Calgary and Edmonton, and &quot;Lunch Television&quot; in Vancouver continued until January 19, 2010.

When the show made the transition to &quot;CityNews&quot;, it lost several features, such as the CityPulse Webtest, which had existed since the 1980s as a phone-in contest. The new format on CHMI, which had been called &quot;A-Channel News&quot; (which was later used by CTVglobemedia&#x27;s A stations, under the name &quot;A News&quot;, prior to the rebranding of the A system to CTV Two in August 2011), had lost nearly half of its audience for the 6 p.m. newscast before its cancellation.

On June 8, 2007, the CRTC approved the CTV takeover of CHUM. However, the five Citytv stations could not be sold to CTVglobemedia due to concentration of media ownership regulations. On June 11, Rogers Communications announced that it would buy the five Citytv stations from CTVglobemedia. The sale was approved on September 28 and became official on October 31, 2007. CTVglobemedia retained ownership of CP24, the 24-hour Toronto local news station that shared many programs and personalities with Toronto&#x27;s Citytv station, including &quot;CityNews&quot;.

On January 19, 2010, &quot;Your City&quot;, based in CKEM-TV Edmonton and CKAL-TV Calgary, &quot;Lunch Television&quot;, and the comedy show &quot;The CityNews List&quot; on CKVU-TV Vancouver were also cancelled. In Winnipeg, the news part of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; is called &quot;CityNews&quot;.

The Jim Pattison Group stations (CFJC-TV Kamloops, CKPG-TV Prince George, and CHAT-TV Medicine Hat) produce their own weeknight local newscasts, but do not produce their own local versions of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; nor title their newscasts under the &quot;CityNews&quot; branding. In fact, despite keeping the same on-air branding and logos used as affiliates of the E! system, they do not bear the Citytv branding. However, as part of a renewal of their affiliation agreements with Citytv on May 3, 2012, CKPG, CHAT and CJFC were to begin simulcasting the Vancouver edition of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; from CKVU-DT, starting in fall 2012 as the stations began carrying 90% of Citytv&#x27;s morning and daytime programming from the CKVU schedule grid.

Citytv Saskatchewan does not produce any &quot;CityNews&quot; newscasts or &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; as it is licensed as an educational cable channel. The newly acquired CJNT Montreal, however, began producing &quot;CityNews&quot; under the &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; banner in the fall of 2013.

On June 5, 2017, Rogers announced that it would return local early evening and late night newscasts to its Citytv owned-and-operated stations in Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg and, through an expansion of CJNT-DT&#x27;s news operations, Montreal. The hour-long newscasts – which aired at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. local time – premiered in Edmonton and Winnipeg on September 4, 2017, while the remainder of the announced markets will launch newscasts in early 2018. On July 12, 2018, it was announced that the new Calgary, Montreal, and Vancouver newscasts would premiere on September 3.

==CityNews Radio==
On December 3, 2020, at 10:00 a.m., CIWW in Ottawa (previously known as &quot;1310 News&quot;) adopted the &quot;CityNews&quot; branding, and began simulcasting on sister station CJET-FM 101.1 (formerly CKBY-FM, switching from its previous country music format as &quot;Country 101.1&quot;) while continuing to broadcast on AM 1310. (The original CKBY&#x27;s format and call letters were concurrently moved over to 92.3 FM, which previously used the CJET-FM calls.)

In June 2021, Rogers announced that it would rebrand its five other all-news and news-talk radio stations under the CityNews brand. The rebranding is to take effect on October 18, 2021. Three of the stations – CFTR 680 Toronto, CFFR 660 Calgary, and CKWX 1130 Vancouver – are co-located with Citytv stations, while a fourth – CKGL 570 Kitchener – is located in a secondary market for Citytv Toronto. The move brought the CityNews brand to Atlantic Canada, where Rogers operates CJNI-FM 95.7 Halifax but does not operate a Citytv station.

On October 26, 2023, Rogers announced it would discontinue the news/talk format on both CIWW and CJET-FM effective at 1:00 p.m. that day, with CJET returning to a country music format and the CIWW licence expected to be returned to the CRTC for cancellation.

In March 2024, as part of a rebranding of &quot;CityNews&quot; introduced that month, Rogers began to drop the &quot;CityNews&quot; branding from its radio stations in favour of &quot;NewsRadio&quot;.

==Former programs==

===&quot;CityNews International&quot;===
Soon after the cancellation of the local &quot;CityNews&quot; broadcasts in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg in 2008, a new half-hour program called &quot;CityNews International&quot; was launched. The program was produced in the Citytv Toronto studios and featured many of the same on-air personalities as the local Citytv Toronto&#x27;s &quot;CityNews&quot;. &quot;CityNews International&quot; aired at 6:30 and 11:30 p.m. in Calgary and Edmonton. In Winnipeg, it ran at 11:00 p.m., and in Vancouver at 6 and 11:35 p.m. In Toronto, Citytv aired the newscast at 11:35 p.m. &quot;CityNews International&quot; was canceled during the 2010 cuts. The title of the program remains in use on Citytv Toronto for the international news segments shown during its evening newscasts.

===&quot;Your City&quot;===
The replacement program in Calgary and Edmonton for the evening/late-evening program was a magazine type of show called &quot;Your City&quot;.

The show aired five nights a week at 6:00 p.m., with a repeat at 11:00 p.m. The format of the show consisted of a top story, a report about theatre or other cultural life, various restaurant and wine reviews and an assortment of other general interest stories.

===&quot;CityNews at Noon&quot;===
The noon newscast aired in Toronto, Calgary and Edmonton. It was hosted by Francis D&#x27;Souza and Laura DiBattista in Toronto, Asha Tomlinson in Edmonton and Aisling Slattery in Calgary.

===&quot;CityOnline&quot;===
A lunchtime half-hour talk show about Toronto news and current affairs aired weekdays at 12:30 p.m., following Toronto&#x27;s City&quot;News at Noon&quot;. The show encouraged audience participation with its phone-in format. Viewers could also e-mail and vote on a daily phone poll.

&quot;CityOnline&quot; was hosted by Kris Reyes. Previous hosts included Ann Rohmer (CP24), Tracy Moore (&quot;Cityline&quot;), and Laura DiBattista (CBC Radio).

===&quot;Lunch Television&quot;===
&quot;Lunch Television&quot; was hosted by Kyle Donaldson and Michel McDermott and aired in the Vancouver market. 

An earlier program, also titled &quot;Lunch Television&quot;, aired on the original Toronto station during the 1990s.

<text>Lolo Pass is a mountain pass northwest of Mount Hood and northeast of Zigzag, Oregon, on the Clackamas–Hood River county line. It divides the Sandy River watershed on the southwest from the Hood River watershed on the northeast.

At , it provides a much lower crossing of the Cascade Range near Mount Hood than the Oregon Route 35 Bennett Pass on the southeast side. Access from the southwest side of the pass is paved all the way to the pass, where the road changes to gravel, heading down the northeast side of the pass. Lolo Pass Road (Forest Road 18) is closed due to heavy snow each winter. The road through the pass was initially established by Native Americans, as a trading route connecting the Willamette Valley and sites at the eastern end of the Columbia River Gorge like Celilo Falls. In 1838, Daniel Lee (nephew of missionary Jason Lee) drove livestock across the pass, while traveling east to establish a new Methodist station, named Wascopam Mission. He was the first westerner known to have used the trail. The trail was then used as one of the final legs of the Oregon Trail; settlers arriving from The Dalles would often drive their livestock over the pass while their families floated down the river. The 1846 construction of the Barlow Road provided a less daunting alternate route around the south side of Mount Hood.

Lolo Pass is one of the milestones along the Pacific Crest Trail, though not a particularly low point for the region. By south of Lolo Pass, the Pacific Crest Trail drops to and much lower to the north at the Columbia River. A small campsite is located along the trail just south of the forest service road.

<doc id="1051693" wikidata="Q3645698" url="?curid=1051693" title="Lotus (genus)">
<text>Lotus, a latinization of Greek &quot;lōtos&quot; (), is a genus of flowering plants that includes most bird&#x27;s-foot trefoils (also known as bacon-and-eggs) and deervetches. Depending on the taxonomic authority, roughly between 70 and 150 species are accepted, all legumes; American species formerly placed in the genus have been transferred to other genera. &quot;Lotus&quot; species are found in the Eastern Hemisphere and adapted to a wide range of habitats.

The aquatic plant commonly known as the Indian or sacred lotus is &quot;Nelumbo nucifera&quot;, a species not closely related to &quot;Lotus&quot;.

==Description==

Most species have leaves with five leaflets; two of these are at the extreme base of the leaf, with the other three at the tip of a naked midrib. This gives the appearance of a pair of large stipules below a &quot;petiole&quot; bearing a trefoil of three leaflets; in fact, the true stipules are minute, soon falling or withering. Some species have pinnate leaves with up to 15 leaflets. The flowers are in clusters of three to ten together at the apex of a stem with some basal leafy bracts; they are pea-flower shaped, usually vivid yellow, but occasionally orange or red. The seeds develop in three or four straight, strongly diverging pods, which together make a shape reminiscent of the diverging toes of a small bird, leading to the common name &quot;bird&#x27;s-foot&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Lotus&quot; is taxonomically complex. It has at times been divided into subgenera and split into segregate genera, but with no consistent consensus. P.H. Raven in 1971 is said to have been the first to suggest that the &quot;New World&quot; (American) and &quot;Old World&quot; (African and Eurasian) species did not belong in the same genus. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2000 based on nuclear ribosomal ITS sequences confirmed this view. The Western species have been divided between the genera &quot;Hosackia&quot; s.str., &quot;Ottleya&quot;, &quot;Acmispon&quot; and &quot;Syrmatium&quot;. A 2006 study, primarily concerned with Eastern &quot;Lotus&quot; species and hence with limited sampling of the American genera, found that they were all monophyletic. The study also supported the view that &quot;Dorycnium&quot; and &quot;Tetragonolobus&quot; are not distinct from &quot;Lotus&quot; at the generic level. More species were added to the 2006 results in 2008, but did not alter the broad conclusions reached before. Clades were identified within &quot;Lotus&quot; s.str., some of which were significantly different from the sections into which the genus had been divided. However, resolution was incomplete. The results of the analysis were presented in terms of clades and complexes.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus contains many dozens of species distributed in the Eastern Hemisphere, including Africa, Europe, western, southern, and eastern Asia, and Australia and New Guinea. They are adapted to a wide range of habitats, from coastal environments to high elevations.

== Ecology ==

&quot;Lotus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species.

&quot;L. corniculatus&quot; is an invasive species in some regions of North America and Australia.

== Uses ==
Several species are cultivated for forage, including &quot;L. corniculatus&quot;, &quot;L. glaber&quot;, and &quot;L. pedunculatus&quot;. They can produce toxic cyanogenic glycosides which can be potentially toxic to livestock, but also produce tannins, which are a beneficial anti-bloating compound.

Species in this genus can fix nitrogen from the air courtesy of their root nodules, making them useful as a cover crop. The nodulating symbionts are &quot;Bradyrhizobium&quot; and &quot;Mesorhizobium&quot; bacteria. Scientific research for crop improvement and understanding the general biology of the genus is focused on &quot;L. japonicus&quot;, which is currently the subject of a full genome sequencing project, and is considered a model organism.

Some species, such as &quot;L. berthelotii&quot; from the Canary Islands, are grown as ornamental plants.

<text>Ting Kau Bridge is a long cable-stayed bridge in Hong Kong that spans from the northwest of Tsing Yi Island and Tuen Mun Road. It is near the Tsing Ma Bridge which also serves as a major connector between the Hong Kong International Airport on Lantau Island and the rest of Hong Kong. It was completed on 5 May 1998. The bridge is toll-free.

The bridge is part of Route 3, connecting the northwest New Territories with Hong Kong Island. Other major structures on the road include the Tai Lam Tunnel, the Cheung Tsing Tunnel, the Cheung Tsing Bridge and the Western Harbour Crossing. The Ting Kau Bridge carries the heaviest traffic volume of the bridges on the Lantau Link, with many container trucks travelling between mainland China and the Hong Kong container port. A chromatic study and specially designed architectural lighting are intended to set the bridge off in its surroundings.

==Design==
Ting Kau Contractors Joint Venture designed and built Ting Kau Bridge between 1995 and 1998. The joint venture consisted of lead partners Cubiertas Y Mzov (22%) and Entrecanales Y Tavora (22%), both of Spain (now both part of Acciona, S.A); Germany&#x27;s Ed. Züblin (22%); Australia&#x27;s Downer and Co (22%); and Hong Kong&#x27;s Paul Y (12%). Constructing engineers were Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner.

The design and construction cost of the bridge was HK$1.94 billion. It is one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in the world. Along with the Tsing Ma and Kap Shui Mun bridges, it is closely monitored by the Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS).

Ting Kau Bridge is the world&#x27;s first major 4-span cable-stayed bridge. This meant that the central tower had to be stabilised longitudinally, which was accomplished using the longest cable stays ever used in a bridge (). The design of this bridge contains special features such as single leg towers, which are stabilised by transverse cables like the masts of a sailboat. The Ting Kau Bridge and approach viaducts link the western New Territories and the mainland to the Lantau Fixed Crossing expressway, which connects the airport to Kowloon and Hong Kong. It meets the Lantau Fixed Crossing on Tsing Yi Island, from the Tsing Ma Bridge.

The Ting Kau Bridge and Approach Viaduct are long while the triple Tower Bridge has an overall length of . The three towers were specially designed to withstand extreme wind and typhoon conditions, and have heights of , , and , located on the Ting Kau headland, on a reclaimed island in Rambler Channel (which is wide), and on the northwest Tsing Yi shoreline, respectively. The arrangement of separate decks on both sides of the 3 towers contributes to the slender appearance of the bridge, while helping it act favourably under heavy wind and typhoon loads. Each deck carries 3 traffic lanes and a hard shoulder.

<text>The National Veterans&#x27; Inquiry was a national-level inquiry into American war crimes in Vietnam. They were held December 1–3, 1970 in Washington, DC.

==Origin==
In November 1969, after the My Lai massacre was revealed in the U.S. press, the Bertrand Russell Foundation, with antiwar activists Jeremy Rifkin and lawyer Tod Ensign, organized the Citizens Commission of Inquiry (CCI) in the United States to document American war crimes in Vietnam. The CCI, held their first inquiry in February 1970 in Annapolis, Maryland.

Further inquiries were held in Springfield, Massachusetts; Richmond, Virginia; New York City; Buffalo; Boston; Minneapolis; Los Angeles; and, Portland, Oregon. In some cities, the commissions were co-sponsored by antiwar coalitions, in others they were organized independently.

Men who had taken part in the CIA&#x27;s Phoenix Program described it as a program based on terror, torture, and assassination. Participants in the Operation Speedy Express filed confidential reports &quot;of helicopter gunships mowing down noncombatants, of airstrikes on villages, of farmers gunned down in their fields while commanders pressed relentlessly for high body counts&quot; amounting to a My Lai each month for over a year. Veterans of the operation spoke about the killing of civilians at the National Veterans&#x27; Inquiry in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="1051714" wikidata="Q870063" url="?curid=1051714" title="Hkakabo Razi">
<text>Hkakabo Razi (, ; ) is believed to be Myanmar&#x27;s highest mountain. The -tall mountain is the highest mountain in Southeast Asia as well. It is located in the northern Myanmar state of Kachin in an outlying subrange of the Greater Himalayan mountain system near the border tripoint with India (Arunachal Pradesh) and China (Tibet Autonomous Region). Its highest status has recently been challenged by -tall Gamlang Razi, located about WSW on the Chinese border.

Administratively, it lies in Dahangdan, Nogmung Township, Putao District, Kachin state.
The peak is enclosed within Khakaborazi National Park. The park is entirely mountainous and is characterized by broad-leaved evergreen tropical rain forest at low altitudes, a sub-tropical temperate zone from , then broad-leaved, semi-deciduous forest and finally needle-leaved evergreen, snow forest. Above , the highest forest zone is alpine, different from the forest not only in kind but in history and origin. Still higher, around , cold, barren, windswept terrain and permanent snow and glaciers dominate. At around , there is a large ice cap with several outlet glaciers.

==Environmental protection==
Hkakabo Razi was established as a natural reserve on January 30, 1996, and as a national park on November 10, 1998. The Khakaborazi National Park is the last stronghold for biodiversity in Myanmar. The extraordinarily rich flora and fauna, ranging from lowland tropical to alpine species still await proper research and identification. They have barely been studied, and the park remains an excellent center for field study for students of botany, geology, zoology, and geography.

A study was done by the Forest Department with the assistance of Wildlife Conservation Society of New York during 1997 and 1998. The results have been presented in ICIMOD sponsored Workshop &quot;Sub-regional Consultation on Conservation of Hkakabo Razi Mountain Ecosystems in Eastern Himalayas&quot;, held in Putao, Myanmar during 25–29 October 1999. This was followed in 2001 with an international, interdisciplinary team of scientists from the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, National Geographic Society, Harvard University, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Myanmar Forestry Ministry. On 11 September 2001, herpetologist Joseph Slowinski, team leader from California Academy of Sciences, was bitten by a venomous krait and died in the field.

In 2002–2003, P. Christiaan Klieger, an anthropologist from the California Academy of Sciences, and photographer Dong Lin retraced their previous steps and succeeded in making the first anthropological survey of the Hkakabo Razi region. On foot, they reached the northernmost village in Myanmar, Tahaundam, which is inhabited by about 200 Khampa Tibetans, including mountaineer Nyama Gyaltsen (see below).

The region will shortly be opened to the general public through eco-tourism by the Myanmar authorities. The government is collecting information for development in that regard, and many scientific expeditions have been already accepted in the region.

Only a few Westerners ever made it to Mt. Hkakabo Razi, the National Park or anywhere close to it. Captain B.E.A. Pritchard was the first Westerner to visit the Alun Dung valley, in 1913.

==Climbing history==
Takashi Ozaki (Japan, 1951 – May 14, 2011) and Nyima Gyaltsen (aka &quot;Aung Tse&quot;; Myanmar) made the first ascent in 1996. Ozaki had attempted the mountain in 1995 but turned back due to bad weather. The route to basecamp is long (four weeks) and arduous through a dense rain forest with many unbridged stream crossings. The recentness of the first ascent can also be attributed to the policy that foreigners were not allowed into the area until 1993.

In 2013, the nearby peak of Gamlang Razi was climbed and measured at using an advanced version of GPS, making it possibly the highest in Myanmar. Ozaki had confirmed Hkakabo&#x27;s height as 5881 m, but he did not yet have the GPS equipment to measure the exact height of Hkakabo Razi.

In August 2014 an all-Burmese expedition took a new route up the north face. Two team-members, Ko Aung Myint Myat and Ko Wai Yan Min Thu, reached the summit on August 31 for the second ascent of the mountain, placing a flag, plaque and Buddha image at the summit. The climbers ran out of battery power right after reaching the summit, and radio contact was lost. After they failed to return to the lower camps, a rescue operation was launched. The search for the missing climbers continued into October. It involved a helicopter crash landing, leading to the death of one pilot and an 11-day survival trek by the other pilot and the passenger mountaineer.

In November 2014, a National Geographic Society / The North Face sponsored expedition set out to measure the height of Hkakabo Razi using the same equipment as the Gamlang Razi team. The 2014 group was led by Hilaree Nelson, and also included Mark Jenkins, Cory Richards, Renan Ozturk, Emily Harrington and Taylor Rees. On November 7, 2014, Jenkins and Ozturk made the final attempt at the summit but turned back at . They estimated that the summit was an additional higher.

In August 2018 it was announced that three Myanmar mountaineers would ascend the mountain sometime that year, but for various reasons, the team postponed the climb until further notice.

<text>Wire is the seventh album by Christian rock band Third Day. It breaks from the style of the band&#x27;s previous albums to return to simple, rock and roll-driven melodies. To quote Allmusic&#x27;s review of the album, &quot;Third Day has stripped away the shine and gotten back to the grittiness of being a rock &amp; roll band.&quot; The album is largely carried by the energetic guitar riffs that pervade its songs, although the forceful lyrics also contribute significantly.

The album&#x27;s songs deal with numerous themes. &quot;Wire&quot;, the title track, is a song about the pressure to succeed in modern society. &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;I Got a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Innocent&quot;, and other tracks deal with sin, faith, and renewal from a Christian perspective. &quot;Billy Brown&quot; is a song that explores the readiness of people to follow and even idolize entertainment figures.

In November 2004, a live version of &quot;Wire&quot; was released, called &quot;Live Wire&quot; featuring a DVD and CD of songs from their tour of their latest album.

The album won 2005 Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album.

<doc id="1051719" wikidata="Q614252" url="?curid=1051719" title="Wahoo">
<text>The wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) is a scombrid fish found worldwide in tropical and subtropical seas. In Hawaii, the wahoo is known as ono. The species is sometimes called hoo in the United States. It is best known to sports, as its speed and high-quality makes it a prized and valued game fish.

==Description==
Its body is elongated and the back is an iridescent blue, while the sides are silvery with a pattern of irregular vertical blue bars. These colors fade rapidly at death. The mouth is large, and the teeth of the wahoo are razor sharp. Both the upper and lower jaws have a somewhat sharper appearance than those of king or Spanish mackerel. Specimens have been recorded at up to in length, and weighing up to . The growth of the fish can be quite quick.

==Distribution==
Wahoo have a circumtropical distribution and are found in Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Population genomic research using RAD sequencing indicates that two weakly differentiated fish stocks are in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific Oceans, likely with a considerable degree of migration and gene flow between these populations.

==Life cycle==
The eggs of the species are buoyant and the larvae are pelagic. Wahoo tend to be solitary or occur in loose-knit groups of two or three fish. Where conditions are suitable, they can be found in schools around 100 or more.

==Ecology==
Their diet is made up of other fish and squid. From a study surrounding the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), an analysis of the stomach contents of wahoo indicated that their diet consists of 84.64% native fish, 14.26% cephalopods (e.g. cuttlefish), and 1.1% crustaceans. The gender ratio of wahoo favors females over males with ratios ranging from 1:0.9 (Puerto Rico) to 3.5:1 (North Carolina), which is common for most pelagic marine species.

Most wahoo taken from waters have a trematode parasite, the giant stomach worm &quot;(Hirudinella ventricosa),&quot; living in their stomachs, but it does not appear to harm the fish.

==Fisheries==

The flesh of the wahoo is white and/or grey, delicate to dense, and highly regarded by many cuisines. The taste has been said to be similar to mackerel. This has created some demand for the wahoo as a premium-priced commercial food fish. In many areas of its range, such as Hawaii, Bermuda, and many parts of the Caribbean, local demand for the wahoo is met by artisanal commercial fishermen who take them primarily by trolling.

===Commercial===
Although local wahoo populations can be affected by heavy commercial and sport-fishing pressure, wahoo as a species is less susceptible to industrial commercial fishing than more tightly schooling and abundant species such as tuna. Wahoo are regularly taken as a bycatch in various commercial fisheries, including longline fisheries for tuna, billfish, and dolphinfish (mahi-mahi or dorado). It is also taken in tuna purse seine fisheries, especially in sets made around floating objects, which act as a focal point for a great deal of other marine life besides tuna. In 2003, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council issued a Dolphin Wahoo Fishery Management Plan for the Atlantic. The species as a whole, though, is not considered overfished.

===Recreational===
In most parts of its range, the wahoo is a highly prized sport-fishing catch. It reaches a good size, and is often available not too far from land; it is also a very good fighter on light to medium tackle. It is known in sport-fishing circles for the speed and strength of its first run. Recreational sports fishermen sometimes sell their catch.

Wahoo are most successfully fished with live bait around deep-water oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico during the winter.

<text>Rambler Channel is a body of water in Hong Kong that separates Tsing Yi Island from Tsuen Wan and Kwai Chung in the New Territories. The channel separates the two landmasses by 900 metres at its widest point. 

Historically, the channel was known as Tsing Yi Mun (青衣門) and Tsing Yi Channel (青衣海峽). The current name of the channel likely originates from HMS Rambler, one of the naval survey ships which charted the waters of this area.

The shoreline of the channel has changed rapidly in the last several decades, owing to the development of Tsuen Wan New Town and the Kwai Chung Container Port. Before extensive reclamation, Gin Drinkers Bay was located along the eastern shore of the channel, and Tsing Yi Bay was located along the western shore. Three islands (Nga Ying Chau, Pillar Island and Mong Chau) once stood in the channel as well.
==Port facilities==
* Kwai Tsing Container Terminals

==Transport==
Six road bridges and one rail bridge span the channel:
* Ting Kau Bridge, connecting Tsing Yi Island with Tuen Mun Road and Tai Lam Tunnel
* Tsing Tsuen Bridge, usually known as the Tsing Yi North Bridge
* Tsing Lai Bridge, the sole railway bridge, used by the MTR metro system
* Cheung Tsing Bridge, part of Tsing Kwai Highway (Route 3), leading to Cheung Tsing Tunnel
* Tsing Yi Bridge, usually known as the Tsing Yi South Bridge
* Kwai Tsing Bridge, usually known as the second Tsing Yi South Bridge
* Stonecutters Bridge, connecting Tsing Yi Island with Stonecutters Island

===Ferry piers===
* Tsuen Wan Ferry Pier (demolished for Tsuen Wan West station)
* Tsing Yi Ferry Pier (ferry services to this pier have ceased)

<doc id="1051728" wikidata="Q7312023" url="?curid=1051728" title="Remnants (novel series)">
<text>Remnants is a series of science fiction books co-authored by Katherine Applegate and her husband Michael Grant, writing together under the name K. A. Applegate, and published between July 2001 and September 2003.

==Plot summary==
In book one, a -long asteroid is on a collision course with Earth, which will kill the vast majority of all living things. Eighty people – mostly top scientists and their families – have been chosen to make a desperate escape in the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, a converted space ship which will use solar sails and experimental suspended animation. A chunk of the asteroid breaks off and destroys San Francisco. Some people who were not chosen to leave Earth kill some of the chosen crew so they can take their places on board the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. Others are stowaways. Most people on board are put into suspended animation, and the ship barely leaves in time, before the asteroid strikes.

In book two, most of the passengers on the &quot;Mayflower&quot; wake up and find the ship is somehow within a building. Something went wrong with the suspended animation, causing about twenty people, mostly adults, to die. The survivors, many of them now orphaned teenagers, call themselves Remnants. They discover alien races / species in the building, along with deadly parasitic worms. They must fight to learn what is going on and to survive. Eventually, Jobs realizes they are inside a colossal space craft.

In book three, the Remnants learn the space craft has an artificial intelligence called Mother, that Mother is confused, and the confusion is causing problems with the indoor environment. The Remnants must learn to communicate with and hopefully get along with the various alien races / species, in order to fix Mother.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
* Jobs: He and his parents and brother are on the Mayflower: only Jobs and his brother survive. Jobs&#x27;s poetic sense and technical knowledge combined are often useful in understanding Mother, a sentient machine. It is Jobs who discovers the remains of Earth. He chose to use the name Jobs because unlike Bill Gates or Michael Dell, Steven Jobs created a miniature revolution &quot;...in his garage.&quot; Jobs&#x27;s birth name is Sebastian Andreeson. He was the son of a prominent scientist, Jennifer Andreeson, head of astrophysics at Stanford, and Tony Andreeson, a software technician with the &quot;kind of job where nobody expects you to show up on time, or at all,&quot; and was recruited to go on the Mayflower Project. He was joined by his long-time best friend Mo&#x27;Steel. He was briefly romantically involved with a girl named Cordelia before he went aboard the Mayflower project, and the first book of Remnants deals with his longing for her to accompany him on the ship. Cordelia instead comes to an infamous death when her video link reveals to the world a chunk of The Rock obliterating San Francisco and its inhabitants, with the resulting shockwave shattering the building from which Cordelia witnesses the destruction.
* Mo&#x27;Steel: Jobs&#x27;s best friend, Mo&#x27;Steel is named for either &quot;Man of Steel&quot; or &quot;More Steel&quot; (Mo cannot remember which), since he has broken 5 of his bones. 4 of them so were broken so badly, they had been replaced with titanium composites. Mo&#x27;Steel has a love for adventure and is proud of all his broken bones and scars. Mo marries Noyze in the series&#x27; epilogue, and has 1 son Boyd, and Noyze is pregnant with another. Mo&#x27;Steel&#x27;s birth name is Romeo Gonzalez. Mo&#x27;Steel is possibly an idiot-savant; however, evidence can only be found in the second book when he converts an insane number of minutes into years.
* 2Face: Named after the comic book villain, Two-Face. She is one of 2 players battling for total control of the Remnants. 2Face seems to show feelings for Billy, but upon being stranded on Earth, she becomes paranoid to the point that she is sure Billy orchestrated the entire event. She attempts to kill Billy to stop the re-greening ritual, and Billy is forced to kill her to protect himself, but not before he gives her a vision of her dead mother so that she may die peacefully. It is hinted several times through the series that 2Face herself caused the fire that scarred her, but this is not confirmed.
* Yago: The son of the first African-American, &quot;and&quot; first female President of the United States (Janice Castleman), Yago is 2Face&#x27;s competition for control. He is highly arrogant and is assured he will eventually rise to power, caring for his own safety above all else. About halfway through the series, Yago is connected to Mother and is &quot;killed&quot; (actually, a projection of his mind is killed). The ordeal leaves Yago believing himself to be &quot;The One&quot;: A being of purity, destined to lead the Chosen (the non-mutant Remnants) and to destroy the Freaks (2Face and the mutated Remnants). Yago&#x27;s twisted religion turns many Blue Meanies with his newly discovered mutation &quot;The Touch&quot;, a sort of laying-on-hands that several Meanies crave (although it is not known exactly what The Touch&quot; really&quot; does - only that it does not work on humans). Near the end of his life Yago becomes much more likeable and not arrogant. Yago dies when his mind, inside of Tate, fades away. Yago&#x27;s birth name is Robert Castleman.
* Violet Blake: Violet is a &quot;Jane&quot; (named for Jane Austen), who for the first half of the series, prefers to be called Miss Blake. As a Jane, Violet has a distaste for technology, and a love for all forms of art and literature. Violet suffers an attack of &quot;worms&quot; in the second book, and eventually they become her mutation, enabling her to become a mass of worms that can revive the dead (to an extent). Violet and Jobs have a semi-romantic relationship, but her disgust over her mutation, and Jobs&#x27;s obsession with Earth, drive them apart. She marries the Marauder Sanchez in the end of the book. Violet&#x27;s birth name is Dallas, the place of her birth.
* Billy Weir: Billy is a true enigma. Originally a Chechen orphan, Billy was adopted by a Texan family. He was born Russian, but his father, Billy Weir Senior, aka, Big Bill, changed his name to Billy. At times it seems that Billy has infinite power, and has a strong connection with Mother. Early in the series he was carried around the computer generated world by Jobs thereby fusing friendship with Jobs that is persistent throughout the series. Long before the Mayflower, Billy dreamt of events that would unfold over five centuries later. While in hibernation, Billy did not sleep, and was awake for the five-hundred-year journey. The ordeal twisted his mind, giving him telekinesis, the power to levitate, and many other strange abilities. In the fourth book, he moves Wylson Lefkowitz-Blake&#x27;s dead body like an oversized marionette, freaking Mo&#x27;Steel out big-time. These abilities make Billy a match for Mother, to the point where they assimilate to become one. Billy dies in the re-greening ritual: it is possible he may have survived, but 2Face&#x27;s attack and the subsequent energy Billy spends to drain her life force may have contributed to his death. He is dubbed &quot;Billy Weird&quot; by many of his enemies (which amounts to anyone seeking control of the ship).
* Tate: Tate is one of the teenage survivors of the Mayflower. She is a relatively unimportant character until the seventh book, and most of the thirteenth book is about her. Tate developed a mutation called &quot;the mouth&quot;, which causes her head to grow to a monstrous size when she feels threatened, and accidentally eats Yago, Charlie, and Amelia, who continue to live inside Tate until she dies or they die a natural death. In the earlier books Tate shows feelings for Mo&#x27;Steel and tells him that he&#x27;s holding the Remnants together.
* Tamara Hoyle: A Marine who was not intended to board the Mayflower shuttle, she was trapped on board when the ship launched, and she was given the berth of a passenger who had been killed before boarding the ship. Tamara was pregnant when she was placed in her berth, and is rejuvenated with the Baby Te at her side. For the first part of the series she is mind-controlled by Te. After Te is defeated, Tamara takes a keen interest in the defense of the Remnants. She is killed by Blue Meanies on the trip back to Earth.
* The Troika: Amelia, Duncan Choate, and Charlie Langlow, are a trio of humans living in what is called &quot;The Basement&quot;, a dark area that is very much what it sounds: an area below Mother&#x27;s main deck. All of them &quot;ascend&quot; to become slime-like shapeshifters. Amelia and Charlie are assimilated into Tate, and Duncan is killed.
* D-Caf: D-Caf wasn&#x27;t supposed to be on the Mayflower. But he and his brother, Mark, stowed away on board the ship. Mark attacked Tamara and was killed by her. Jobs, who wasn&#x27;t in his hibernation booth yet, heard the commotion and subdued D-Caf, but not before D-Caf shot one of the two pilots. Ultimately, D-Caf was given the spot. When the surviving Remnants woke up, D-Caf ended up hanging out with Yago because no one else liked him. He spends the majority of the series following Yago and Anamull. When the Blue Meanies attacked, D-Caf was killed and given Violet&#x27;s worm mutation. Along with the remaining Remnants, except Tate, he was abandoned by Yago. Although he&#x27;s not mentioned in the epilogue, D-Caf survived and lived to see the new Earth.
* Kubrick: The fifteen-year-old son of one of the Mayflower&#x27;s engineers, Kubrick was skinned by Mother to look more like her creators. He is introduced in the fifth book, where he and his father find Billy and Mo&#x27;Steel in the &quot;basement&quot;. In the series, he shows definite feelings for 2Face. He is killed in the ninth book by Charlie saving 2Face&#x27;s life.
* Echo: An Alpha colony inhabitant, Echo is not genetically pure, and this shows in her blind baby. She is forced to flee the Alpha colony and seek refuge with the Marauders. Her child, Lumina, becomes one of 3 elements in the re-greening of Earth.
* Sanchez: Sanchez is the Marauder who was granted visions by the Source, which is later revealed to be Mother. After the Remnants and Marauders win against the Savagers, Sanchez receives a call from Mother telling the humans to come to the source. Through Billy, Sanchez saw what elements were needed to perform the ritual that would restore Earth. 
*Noyze: Born Jessica Polk, Noyze, the daughter of a novelist and an orthopedic surgeon, was mostly deaf until age 12, then received surgery that restored her hearing to its full capacity. Noyze and Dr Cohen were abandoned on the ship by the other Remnants and kidnapped by Blue Meanies. Noyze is the only Remnant who can communicate with the Blue Meanies.
* Newton: Hawk&#x27;s brother, the former leader of the Marauders after he&#x27;s killed by Mo&#x27;Steel. Right from the start, Newton plotted to kill Mo&#x27;Steel and become leader himself. He tried to have D-Caf poisoned by Balder and Olga to be killed by Rattler, both of which fail. Then his attempt to kill Mo&#x27;Steel was foiled by Edward. After Newton failed to steal Lumina, Newton fled; his ultimate fate is never revealed.
* Te: Initially called &quot;The Baby&quot;, Te appears first as the young child of Tamara Hoyle, who was born on the 500-year journey. After some time, however, it becomes clear that the Baby is not human, and is furthermore controlling Tamara&#x27;s mind. After absorbing the energy of several Blue Meanies, Te transforms into a Shipwright and attempts to seize control of Mother. However, Billy defeats him by joining with Mother. Te is notably the only Shipwright to appear.
* Mother: Both a computer and a ship, Mother is so highly advanced that she is self-aware, or at least is able to give the impression that she is, and experiences loneliness after her creators, the Shipwrights, abandoned her and left her alone for a six hundred years. The long years alone in space have damaged her system: she must have maintenance every 200 cycles, and has been alone for 600 (although it is not specified exactly how long a cycle is). The long years of no new input drove Mother mad, and when the Mayflower is found, she eagerly awakes the Remnants to absorb new information. Mother eventually merges with Billy. When Billy and she are disconnected, she suffers a computer virus from the Troika, and is degraded into Daughter, a simplified form of herself. Mother the Ship crashes on Earth, and becomes known as the Source to the Marauders.

===Other characters===
*Mark Melman: Mark was D-Caf&#x27;s older brother and foster father. The two of them weren&#x27;t supposed to be on the Mayflower, but they stowed away in some space suits. Mark attacked and wounded Tamara but was killed by her before she lost consciousness. 
*Jasper Willett: Colonel Jasper Willett was the Mayflower commander. When one of the Mayflower&#x27;s solar sail&#x27;s is damaged, Willett talks Jobs and Mo&#x27;Steel how to fix it. But shortly afterward, he used the gun D-Caf had used earlier to kill himself, presumably because he couldn&#x27;t live without his family. When Jobs, Mo&#x27;Steel and 2Face woke up on Mother, they found Willett&#x27;s skeleton.
*Connie Huerta: Doctor Connie Huerta was one of the Mayflower passengers who survived hibernation. Before departing, Connie offered to let Tamara take her place on the Mayflower to give her baby a chance at life; Tamara was pregnant at the time. Shortly after waking up, Jobs found Tamara with her baby, and the umbilical cord still attached. Connie died when the baby attacked her in her attempt to cut the cord.
*Errol Smith: Errol was one of the Mayflower passengers who survived hibernation. He was one of the rocket scientists who put the Mayflower together. He was one of the first of the Remnants to suggest that they&#x27;d somehow been captured as there were no signs of reentry damage. But shortly afterward, the Remnants were attacked by the Riders, who challenged Errol to a duel and killed him. 
*William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Weir: Big Bill was Billy&#x27;s adopted father. He woke up from his berth with T.R.; Big Bill being infested with worms at the time. When Jobs, Violet and Mo&#x27;Steel tried to save him, one of the worms escaped and got into Violet&#x27;s finger, prompting Jobs and Mo&#x27;Steel to cut off her finger. Ultimately Billy killed Big Bill to save him from a slow death. Big Bill reappears as projection to the Remnants as a projection by Billy while he spoke with Mother.
*Shy Hwang: Shy Hwang was 2Face&#x27;s father. Before the Rock hit, Shy was an ABC producer in Miami who blackmailed the Mayflower Project to get his family places on board and a chance at life. After Shy found his wife dead, he remained depressed for the rest of his time on board Mother. Shy was finally killed by a Blue Meanie aboard the Constitution.
*Wylson Lefkowitz-Blake: Wylson was the CEO of Microsoft who survived hibernation aboard the Mayflower. Yago appointed her leader of the Remnants; he intended to usurp her later. When Tamara demanded a sacrifice for the baby, 2Face arranged with Yago for Wylson to be fed. Wylson was saved when the node was destroyed and their current environment replaced to its default setting. During the battle on the Constitution, a massive wave threw her overboard. Mo&#x27;Steel had jumped into the water to save her and Billy, who had been thrown into the water by Tamara. Mo&#x27;Steel managed to reach Billy but was too late to help Wylson.
*Alberto Disalvo: Alberto was one of the scientists who designed the Mayflower&#x27;s solar sails. He and his son, Kubrick, woke up earlier and fell back asleep. Alberto would wake up to find his son mutated by Mother. The two met up with Mo&#x27;Steel and Billy and found one of the chairs that interfaced with Mother. Alberto sat in the chair and got his brain scrambled. Shortly afterward, Mother would kill Alberto in the Blue Meanies base.
*T.R.: Tathagata &quot;T.R.&quot; Rajagopalchari was one of the survivors aboard the Mayflower. He woke along with a worm-infested Big Bill. T.R. was silent for the majority of his part with the Remnants. When Billy enforced the Big Compromise, T.R. had him make a helicopter for him. T.R. was killed by Blue meanies who were searching for Yago. Their fired missed Edward and hit him. T.R. was the first of the Remnants to be honored with a proper burial.
*Angelique Cohen: Doctor Cohen was one of survivors on board the Mayflower. She was kidnapped by the Blue Meanies along with Noyze. Throughout her part in the series, Doctor Cohen was obsessed with finding her husband, Alan Carrington. When Noyze set off to negotiate with the Blue Meanies, they attacked them and placed a device on Doctor Cohen that looked into her memories and drove her insane. Doctor Cohen was later killed by the Blue Meanies in the attack that followed.
*Daniel Burroway: Burroway was one of the survivors on board the Mayflower who lost his entire family. He constantly fought among the other Remnants and respected no one except Wylson. Burroway was the Remnants&#x27; first casualty when they landed on Earth. He was killed by a pillar of flame.
*Anamull: Anamull was one of the younger survivors on board the Mayflower. Yago recruited Anamull as his bodyguard; Anamull spent most of the series following Yago though he secretly thought he was nuts. Yago would abandon Anamull along with the other remaining Remnants on Earth with the Riders and Blue Meanies. Anamull provoked a fight and killed two of the Meanies. He then isolated himself from the others and was able to make a fire. But he was ultimately accidentally devoured by D-Caf, who was just trying to scare him, in his worm form. 
*Rodger Dodger: Rodger Dodger was one of the younger survivors aboard the Mayflower. He wasn&#x27;t very important until he accompanied Tate and D-Caf on several Rider boards. He grew very bored of living quietly with Tate and Tamara when Billy enforced the Big Compromise. He snuck into the Violet&#x27;s house and killed himself while playing with a Rider Boomerang. Violet brought him back to life in using her concealed mutation.
*Olga: Mo&#x27;Steel&#x27;s mother, who tries to keep Mo&#x27;Steel from danger without much success, though she&#x27;s used to his dangerous antics. Olga made it her business to take care of the Remnants whenever one of them was injured. She befriended the Marauder, Aga, and the two lived together in the new Earth for a time before Aga died.
*Edward: Jobs&#x27;s six-year-old brother who gains the power to blend into his surrounding environment until he&#x27;s practically invisible. When Wylson abandons Violet, Jobs asks 2Face to look after Edward. Edward&#x27;s power proves very useful when he stops Newton from killing Mo&#x27;Steel. Edward was one of the few to survive to see the new Earth.

===List of humans===
During the escape from earth, eighty humans were on board the Mayflower. However, some diverged into other species. Of the Eighty that set out, only eight survived. 22 died on board the Mayflower, one was killed before the Mayflower set off, the two &quot;pilots&quot; were killed before the hibernation happened, and 27 died of other causes.

==Plots==
*&quot;The Mayflower Project&quot;: At the start of the first book, Jobs learns of a seventy-six mile long asteroid on a collision course with Earth. His parents then tell him of a project of eighty people being shipped off into a shuttle with solar sails and hibernation booths. Jobs, along with his best friend Mo&#x27;Steel, attempt to give a place to Jobs&#x27;s crush Cordelia, but learn from her father that she&#x27;s away in San Francisco. Cordelia later dies when a small piece of the asteroid breaks off and destroys San Francisco. Jobs, Mo&#x27;Steel and their parents all get shipped off to the Mayflower along with the rest of the eighty, who are being pursued by a mob who wants to destroy the Mayflower, as well a pair of brothers named Mark and Harlin &quot;D-Caf&quot; Melman, the former of which intends to kill the Mayflower&#x27;s crew to give him and his brother places on the Mayflower. Shortly before boarding the Mayflower, a gunman kills one of the eighty and the Mayflower takes off with Mark and D-Caf, who have stowed away in spaces suits, and unbeknownst to anyone, a pregnant marine sergeant, Tamara Hoyle. Mark attacks Tamara, but is ultimately killed by her. Jobs hears the commotion and subdues D-Caf, but not before D-Caf accidentally shoots one of the pilots. The Mayflower commander, Colonel Willett realizes that a solar sail has been damaged. While he places Tamara and D-Caf into hibernation booths, Jobs revives Mo&#x27;Steel, and the pair of them repair the sail moments before the asteroid hits Earth. The book ends with Jobs and Mo&#x27;Steel returning to their berths, but Colonel Willett takes Mark&#x27;s gun and shoots himself, and everyone falls asleep, all except for an orphan boy named Billy Weir.
*&quot;Destination Unknown&quot;: Jobs wakes up from hibernation, along with Mo&#x27;Steel and a girl named 2Face, and the three of them discover that not everyone has survived, including both Jobs&#x27;s parents, Mo&#x27;Steel&#x27;s dad and 2Face&#x27;s mom. Slowly but surely other members of the eighty wake up, including Billy, a girl named Violet Blake and her mother Wylson, the president&#x27;s son Yago, Mo&#x27;Steel&#x27;s mother, 2Face&#x27;s dad Shy Hwang, Jobs&#x27;s brother Edward and others. They soon realize that there&#x27;s no sign of reentry damage, their environment looks like two famous paintings and two of the &quot;wakers&quot; are killed; Connie Huerta by Tamara&#x27;s baby and Errol Smith at the hands of a hover-board-riding alien later named Riders. Other members of the eighty emerge, including, D-Caf, a boy named Rodger Dodger, a boy named Anamull, a girl named Tate a man named Burroway. Two others include T.R. and Big Bill Weir, Billy&#x27;s adopted father. The Remnants learn that Big Bill is infested with worms. When Violet attempts to save him, one worm gets in her finger, prompting Jobs to cut off her finger and Wylson to abandon her; Big Bill is also killed by Billy, who then blacks out. Jobs, Mo&#x27;Steel and his mother, Olga stay with Violet and witness another group of aliens entering the environment, which Jobs now realizes is a colossal ship.
*&quot;Them&quot;: While Jobs&#x27;s group stays with Violet, the main group of Remnants have found a replica of the Tower of Babel and are attacked by a group of Riders. Tamara battles one of the Riders and strangely manages to kill it. When Wylson remarks on it, Tamara replies, &quot;Everything dies, human.&quot; Meanwhile, Jobs and the others get frequently attacked by strange demons that Violet identifies as Bosch&#x27;s Final Judgement. Along the way, they encounter one of the aliens they saw entering the ship; Mo&#x27;Steel had called them Blue Meanies. They attempt to communicate with the Meanie with difficulty, but with help from Billy, they manage to get out of him that his name is Four Sacred Streams and that Mother is confused, which Jobs assumes is the Ship, and that a node must be destroyed, which is creating the environments. Back with the others, 2Face attempts to leave with Edward, having been discriminated by Yago as a freak. She returns to the others and gets attacked by the other Remnants, who decided to feed 2Face to Tamara&#x27;s baby in order for Tamara to protect them from the Riders, so 2Face bribes Yago so that Wylson will be sacrificed. But the baby doesn&#x27;t get to eat anyone when Four Sacred Streams destroys the node at the cost of his own life, saving the lives of Jobs&#x27;s group, but trapping the other Remnants in Mother&#x27;s default setting, the Riders&#x27; home territory.
*&quot;Nowhere Land&quot;: Jobs and his group reunite with their fellow Remnants, who have barely escaped an attack from the Riders. They find a large creature, that they call a Blimp, swimming through the new environment, a copper colored sea with small islands dotted around it. Using a Rider boomerang provided by D-Caf, Mo&#x27;Steel manages to get a hold on the Blimp and help the other Remnants onto the Blimp. Wylson then berates Yago in his attempt to sacrifice her to Tamara&#x27;s baby and attempts to replace him with Jobs as her new representative for the younger Remnants. 2Face intervenes, claiming that survival is more important. The following day, they&#x27;re attacked by the Riders again. Billy tries to keep the Blimp moving and several of the Remnants are lucky enough to kill some of the Riders, but they just keep coming. The Remnants hide inside the Blimp itself and escape the Riders but shortly after they leave, the Blimp dies. They swim to one of the islands and spot another one of Mother&#x27;s replicas, the U.S.S. Constitution, which they commandeer. Later on, they spot a statue infested with Blue Meanies, who are battling squid-like creatures. Having heard of Four Sacred Streams from Jobs, the Remnants attempt to make the Meanies their allies by firing the Constitution&#x27;s cannons at the statue. Instead, the Blue Meanies angrily return fire on the Remnants, killing Shy Hwang. In the confusion as the Remnants go below decks, Billy is thrown overboard by Tamara and Wylson is also thrown off by a massive wave. Mo&#x27;Steel notices the commotion and attempts to save them. Billy manages to take them to safety, but Wylson has drowned. The other Remnants meanwhile are now surrounded by Blue Meanies, completely defenseless.
*&quot;Mutation&quot;: Mo&#x27;Steel and Billy encounter two of the Remnants that they accidentally left behind when they encountered the worms, Alberto Disalvo and his son Kurbick, who has had his skin and nerves surgically removed by Mother. They group together and find a chair linked to Mother, which Alberto sits in, resulting with his mind being scrambled. Meanwhile, the Blue Meanies, who had surrounded the Remnants in the previous book, retreat when Mother creates three ships to attack them and end up attacking the U.S.S. Constitution. The Remnants are saved when Mo&#x27;Steel is made a giant by Billy and destroys the ships. Billy then decides to sit the chair and the Remnants find themselves in a new environment, Billy&#x27;s thoughts. Mo&#x27;Steel, Alberto and Kubrick meet up with the rest of the Remnants in a McDonald&#x27;s, where they are attacked by an army of female warriors, presumably from a comic book Billy read as a kid. They barely manage to escape when they&#x27;re attacked by Riders and Squids in a replica of Billy&#x27;s old school. They escape again when the environment changes to Edward Hopper&#x27;s &quot;Nighthawks&quot;. Here they meet an image of Big Bill, created by Billy to communicate with the other Remnants while he interfaces with Mother, who is experiencing sadness from being abandoned by her creators, the Shipwrights; Mother had mutated Kubrick to look more like the Shipwrights.
*&quot;Breakdown&quot;: Two other Remnants, Noyze and Doctor Cohen have been captured from the Blue Meanies, who are deciding what to do about the humans. Unbeknownst to them, Noyze, who had been deaf for part of her life, understands the sign language of the Meanies. Meanwhile, Mother offers the other Remnants to help her destroy the Blue Meanies, to which Yago willingly volunteers for. He then ends up in one of the chairs and the environment changes to an alternate version of the White House, where Mother provides Yago with a computer generated army from the Civil War. While Jobs, Violet and 2Face follow Yago to the Blue Meanie base, Mo&#x27;Steel and Kubrick meet up with Billy and find Yago in one of the chairs linked to Mother. Meanwhile, Yago&#x27;s strike force is decimated by the Blue Meanies and Jobs notices Tamara&#x27;s baby absorb one of the Blue Meanies. Kubrick is then able to remove Yago from the chair and place his father into it, but Mother kills him and Billy sends himself, Mo&#x27;Steel and Kubrick to the battlefield. With the battle over, 2Face accuses Tamara&#x27;s baby of being a Shipwright and divides the Remnants into factions to either follow her or the baby. Jobs, Mo&#x27;Steel, Violet, Kubrick, Noyze, Olga and Doctor Cohen join 2Face while the rest join the baby. The two groups depart, each with the same destination in mind, the bridge of Mother.
*&quot;Isolation&quot;: 2Face&#x27;s group is heading for the bridge of Mother, but Tamara is taking a different course. Tamara meets with the Riders and participates in the Rule of Nine, where she must duel nine Riders to the death at once. Tamara kills the first eight and kills the last one with some slight intervention by Tate. Tamara gains control of the Riders to destroy the Blue Meanies in the baby&#x27;s name and gain control of Mother. Tate returns to the others and reports her findings to the other Remnants; Tate had come with Yago&#x27;s group only to protect Tamara, realizing that the baby was controlling her. She then decides to alert Jobs and 2Face of the danger. Along with Rodger Dodger and D-Caf, who decided he wanted a break from Yago, they steal some Rider hover-boards and alert the other Remnants, who have just avoided an attack from Squids, which Billy had indicated were automatons. Tamara arrives with the Riders and attack the Blue Meanies, who have gathered at the bridge. During the battle, the baby absorbs several dead Blue Meanies and takes on the true form of a Shipwright and ascends to the bridge with Tamara, closely followed by Billy, Jobs, Mo&#x27;Steel, and Tate. Billy duels the Shipwright while at the same time uses his mind to have Mo&#x27;Steel duel Tamara. Ultimately, Billy destroys the Shipwright when Mother intervenes in his favor, freeing Tamara in the process. He then leaves the bridge with Jobs and Mo&#x27;Steel (Tate decided to stay with Tamara) and forcefully ends the battle, angering Yago, who vows to destroy Billy.
*&quot;Mother, May I?&quot;: Billy has enforced the Big Compromise, the aliens are to not attack the Remnants and in exchange the Remnants won&#x27;t alter Mother&#x27;s course. Three months later, while exploring Mother&#x27;s lab, Jobs finds what he believes may be what&#x27;s left of Earth. Knowing it will break the Big Compromise, he consults Billy, who says he can make Mother return to Earth if the Remnants so choose, and asks Jobs to search Mother&#x27;s &quot;basement&quot;, because Billy can&#x27;t sense anything in there. While Jobs takes Mo&#x27;Steel, Kubrick, Tate, Anamull, Yago, and Tamara to the basement with him, some Blue Meanies attack Violet in her Greek villa and interrogate her about Yago&#x27;s whereabouts, claiming that he&#x27;d been given a custom Blue Meanie weapon and deviating their fellows into turning against them, which attracts 2Face, Edward, and T.R. A small fight commences in which one of the Blue Meanies kills T.R. in an attempt to kill Edward. Violet, infuriated by this senseless act, changes her mind on her opposition of returning to Earth. Meanwhile, Jobs&#x27;s and his group are attacked by other Blue Meanies searching for Yago. Some are killed by Yago&#x27;s new weapon but the last one is absorbed by Amelia, one of the missing eighty that vanished from their berths on the Mayflower. She instructs Jobs to tell Billy not to alter Mother&#x27;s course. However, Billy alters Mother&#x27;s course before he and the others can deliver the message.
*&quot;No Place Like Home&quot;: The Remnants are preparing for an inevitable battle with the Blue Meanies, and possibly the Riders. To protect them, Billy constructs a massive wall that only the Remnants can open from the inside. Noyze proposes attempting to negotiate with the aliens but 2Face argues against it. Yago meanwhile, is recruiting Blue Meanies who tell him that their brethren are preparing for a raid to test the Remnants&#x27; defenses. But late one night, Noyze and Doctor Cohen sneak out to attempt to negotiate with the aliens. They encounter a Blue Meanie that knocks them out and places a device onto Doctor Cohen that allows it to see into her memories and gather all the information it needs for its fellows to attack the Remnants; the device also badly damages Doctor Cohen&#x27;s mind. Meanwhile, a man named Charlie is spotted and brought into the Remnants&#x27; territory. Olga and Violet restore him to health and Noyze returns with Doctor Cohen. The next day, the Remnants hold their own against a Rider attack but their defenses are decimated by the Blue Meanies. In the battle, it&#x27;s revealed that Charlie is one of Amelia&#x27;s two partners sent to kill Billy. He ends up attacking 2Face instead, causing an infuriated Kubrick to attack him. D-Caf is also killed in battle but Violet uses her newly revealed mutation to bring him back to life; she had the power to turn into a swarm of worms ever since waking up and had used it earlier to bring Rodger Dodger back to life after he accidentally killed himself playing with a Rider boomerang. When asked if she&#x27;s still human, she replies, &quot;Are any of us?&quot;
*&quot;Lost and Found&quot;: Kubrick and Doctor Cohen are listed as dead at the start of this book and Charlie has returned to Amelia and his other partner, Duncan. Grieved by Kubrick&#x27;s death, 2Face decides she wants Violet&#x27;s mutation so she can help her fellow Remnants. When Violet refuses, 2Face deliberately kills herself so Violet will give her the mutation; Violet refused because she had failed to save Tamara after she&#x27;d been killed by the Blue Meanies. Tate discovers she has a mutation as well when she spots Yago breaking curfew and her mouth grows big and bites him; Yago is saved only by intervention from Jobs. They arrive on Earth and find that it&#x27;s nothing but a wasteland with no water and pillars of flames, one of which kills Burroway. Yago meets with the Troika (the name Billy gave Amelia&#x27;s group) and makes a deal with them to abandon Billy on Earth and leave on Mother with him. He then sends his last Blue Meanie to spy on Jobs. The next morning, Jobs finds his newly planted tomato seed sprouting. As all the Remnants and Billy all gather around it, Yago takes off on Mother with the Troika, and unintentionally, Tate. The Remnants are left on the barren Earth along with four Blue Meanies and a pair of Riders. And unbeknownst to anyone, a girl named Echo has observed everything from an unnoticed view deck.
*&quot;Dream Storm&quot;: Having been abandoned on Earth by Yago and the Troika, Anamull starts a fight with the Blue Meanies and Riders, killing two of the Meanies and prompting the other aliens to retreat. Billy, now disconnected from Mother, falls into a coma. Echo is now formally introduced as being an Alpha, part of a human colony who survived the Rock, who strongly believe in genetic perfection and decided to allow the Remnants to die. Another group, known as the Marauders, live out in the wild and their leader, Hawk, kills the Alpha leader, Woody, and forcefully takes more than the Marauders&#x27; fair share of food. Meanwhile, Jobs and Mo&#x27;Steel take the suits from the dead Blue Meanies to explore the area. While they&#x27;re away, D-Caf accidentally eats Anamull when he loses control of the worms in his body. Jobs and Mo&#x27;Steel also get caught in a violent storm that makes them see things that can&#x27;t possibly be real; Jobs sees San Francisco and Mo&#x27;Steel sees his grandmother making bread. They return to the others and Edward reports that he&#x27;d seen some people nearby, who are some of the Marauders. Edward leads the Remnants to where he spotted them, and they stumble into the Alphas&#x27; home where Hawk and some of the Marauders attack them. Mo&#x27;Steel kills Hawk with a Rider boomerang he and the other Remnants are taken to separate rooms. Mo&#x27;Steel wakes up and a Marauder woman named Aga says he is the new leader of the Marauders. When Mo&#x27;Steel asks to see the others, he finds that Billy is missing from the group.
*&quot;Aftermath&quot;: Mo&#x27;Steel must now prove himself worthy of being leader of the Marauders by killing a Beast. He, along with the Remnants and Marauders, depart from the Alpha colony. Hawk&#x27;s brother, Newton, is angry that Mo&#x27;Steel become leader as he had intended to become leader himself; he then plots the best ways to usurp Mo&#x27;Steel. During the journey, Mo&#x27;Steel learns that some of the Marauders are mutated humans rejected by the Alphas. Some of them, like Badger and Cocker, are decent people, and Olga befriends Aga. The Marauders also have a shaman among them named Sanchez, to whom Violet is attracted to. If any person created by the Alphas had any sort of disability, they were rejected and sent to live with the Marauders. They soon arrive in the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; of Earth and the Marauders warn the Remnants of the Slizzers, which turn out to be mutated cockroaches, one of which steals and devours the child Tackie. Newton makes several attempts to take revenge on Mo&#x27;Steel. First he has Rattler attack Olga, but is killed by Mo&#x27;Steel. 2Face also sees the Marauders passing around a bag full of pellets and warns the others not to eat them. But when Mo&#x27;Steel refuses to marry Grost, Newton has Balder attempt to poison D-Caf, but Aga helps him recover. They now arrive at the lair of the Beasts, where Mo&#x27;Steel learns are mutated rats. Mo&#x27;Steel kills the leader as instructed and Newton attempts to kill him but is foiled by Edward. No sooner does Mo&#x27;Steel berate Newton, then they&#x27;re all attacked by Savagers, a group of Marauders who turned against their fellows, and have allied themselves with the two Riders.
*&quot;Survival&quot;: While the rest of the Remnants are trapped on Earth, Tate is trapped on Mother with Yago and the Troika. After gathering all the Blue Meanies and Riders for the Troika to devour, Yago attempts to feed Tate to the Troika. But Tate&#x27;s new mutation, the Mouth, overcomes her and she eats Yago, whose consciousness is still alive in Tate&#x27;s mind. Tate then falls asleep and sees a vision of the earth green again and even saw someone she knew to be Jobs&#x27;s daughter. She then wakes up and finds one of the chairs interfaced with Mother and sits in it. She learns that Mother is feeling terrible pain because Billy is no longer with her and displays feelings to Tate by taking memories out of Tate&#x27;s own mind. The Troika now emerge from cocoons and Amelia deliberately gets eaten by Tate while Duncan plants a virus into Mother, reducing her to a simple computer called Daughter. Tate also eats Charlie and has dreams of Billy merging with Mother on Earth people living on a green Earth. She along with Yago, Amelia and Charlie take control of Daughter and use her to launch Duncan into the vacuum of space. Charlie later takes over Tate&#x27;s body but is killed when Tate, Yago and Amelia drive him insane and causes him to fade away. Tate, Yago and Amelia spend sixty years of peace traveling the stars trying to find new forms of life. When Yago requests to Tate that they return to Earth, Tate refuses, unwilling to return to what&#x27;s left of Earth. Tate wakes up the next day and learns from Amelia that Yago has died of old age. Feeling responsible for Yago, Tate and Amelia come up with a plan to undo the damage of the Rock. Traveling through time and space Tate orders a rehabilitated Mother to crash into Asia where the Remnants originally landed, killing her and Amelia on impact.
*&quot;Begin Again&quot;: The Remnants and Marauders emerge victorious against the Savagers, killing the two Riders and sustaining no casualties of their own. After the battle, Sanchez informs them that he can hear the Source calling to them. Mo&#x27;Steel sends Cocker to the Alpha colony but they refuse to come. Echo, who had volunteered some of DNA to make a new human is found out to be blind, and so the Alphas imprison Echo and her baby intending to leave them to die. Lyric, Mattock and Echo&#x27;s mentor, Westie help Echo and her baby escape but Westie chooses to stay in the colony and instructs the others to leave her. They meet Cocker who takes them to the source with the others. The source is none other than Mother. Jobs, Mo&#x27;Steel, Violet, 2Face, Mattock, Newton and Sanchez enter Mother and find Tate&#x27;s skeleton and a recording she took before crashing on Earth telling the Remnants that all they need is love and to listen to Billy, who has merged with Mother. Sanchez then has a vision of a green Earth. They return from Mother and inform the others. Newton doesn&#x27;t believe that this green world is possible and intends to keep it from coming to pass. Sanchez stays inside Mother and learns from Billy that three elements are needed for a ritual to make Earth green, Mother, the Five, who were the other missing five besides the Troika, and Echo&#x27;s child, who Jobs had named Lumina. Newton attempts to steal Lumina, but is foiled by the Remnants, prompting him to flee. 2Face, convinced that Billy is setting them up to fail attempts to kill Billy, resulting with Billy killing her but giving her a vision of her mother to die peacefully. Echo then willingly agrees to risk her baby&#x27;s life and gives her to Billy. In the epilogue, the ritual has succeeded but 2Face&#x27;s attack made Billy unable to survive the regreening. Jobs has married Echo and have named their next daughter after Tate, Mo&#x27;steel has married Noyze, who have one child and another on the way, Mattock and Lyric have married and Violet marries Sanchez. They have searched for the Alphas with no luck and there&#x27;s no sign of Newton. At last, the survivors have peace.

== Notes==
* Although there are numerous references to &quot;The Ancient Enemy&quot;, it is never specified what The Ancient Enemy is: a being, a place, or something else. Several points of evidence (including Te identifying him as such) point to Billy as being The Ancient Enemy. However, at one point the Troika chant &quot;We are The Ancient Enemy&quot;. Furthermore, it is not known who or what The Ancient Enemy is the enemy of.
* The sources of the various mutations are not known. Most are described as being a result of exposure to radiation; however, even some of the characters note that this is not an adequate explanation: some are subtle, while some are extreme (compare the Troika to a lesser mutation like Edward&#x27;s chameleon-like power to change the color of his skin). Some only become apparent after a time: Tate&#x27;s mutation &quot;The Mouth&quot; is only discovered over halfway through the series. Certain characters seem to have unusual traits unrelated to the others. Examples include Kubrick, whose see-through skin is caused by Mother, and Billy, whose strange abilities (also unexplained) existed before the main events of the stories.
* The bodies of all the corpses of the Mayflower passengers vanish without explanation. Eight &quot;Missings&quot; are unaccounted for. Three become the Troika, and the others, called &quot;The Missing Five&quot; are later revealed to be, somehow, alive within Billy.
* Although the Moon, or any of the three parts it breaks into never impact Earth (Jobs and Mo watch the devastation unfold from orbit after manually releasing the Mayflower&#x27;s solar sails), the Earth that the Remnants return to has the Moon embedded in its side.
* The book series has a few references to The Beatles, with one book being called &quot;Nowhere Land&quot;, a reference to The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, and the villains of The Beatles film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; are called Blue Meanies.
* There is an explicit reference to the Grateful Dead in the series. In the book &quot;Begin Again&quot;, after Mo&#x27;Steel hears Tate&#x27;s audio log, he remarks to Jobs, &quot;What a long strange trip it&#x27;s been,&quot; which is a famous line from the Dead&#x27;s song &quot;Truckin&#x27;&quot;.
*In the summary for &quot;Nowhere Land&quot;, the Remnants are described finding a power node, a green cone buzzing with electricity, when in fact this does not happen in the book.
* Although it is hinted at in &quot;No Place Like Home&quot;, the origin of the fire that burned 2Face is never revealed.
* In &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, both Rodger Dodger and D-Caf tell of having strange nightmares while being dead, but neither of their nightmares are ever revealed.
* In &quot;The Mayflower Project&quot;, it is described that those who enter the hibernation bays must swallow the end of a long tube that goes down their throat and put a plastic mask over their faces in order for the hibernation technology to function. These apparatuses are not mentioned, however, when the survivors are waking up in &quot;Destination Unknown&quot;.

<doc id="1051729" wikidata="Q7716220" url="?curid=1051729" title="The Beaver Trilogy">
<text>The Beaver Trilogy (2001) is a documentary film directed by Trent Harris, featuring Richard LaVon Griffiths (also known as &quot;The Beaver Kid&quot; and &quot;Groovin&#x27; Gary&quot;), Sean Penn, Crispin Glover and co-starring Courtney Gains and Elizabeth Daily.

==Description==
&quot;The Beaver Trilogy&quot; combines three separate vignettes that were filmed at different times, in 1979, 1981, and 1984. The first, titled &quot;The Beaver Kid&quot;, is a short documentary about the exploits of &quot;Groovin&#x27; Gary&quot;, a performer that filmmaker Harris happened upon while filming for a Salt Lake City, Utah news station. Harris was in the parking lot of his workplace, testing out a color video video camera that the station had just acquired, when he stumbled upon Gary taking photographs of their news helicopter. Gary immediately launched into a number of celebrity impressions, including John Wayne and Sylvester Stallone.

Several weeks after they first met, Harris traveled to the small town of Beaver, Utah and filmed Gary, an Olivia Newton-John obsessive, as he staged a talent show that featured Gary dressed in full drag singing the Newton-John song &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Keep Me Waiting&quot;. Gary refers to his onstage alter-ego as &quot;Olivia Newton-Dawn&quot;.

The second installment, titled &quot;The Beaver Kid 2&quot; features Sean Penn as &quot;Groovin&#x27; Larry&quot; Huff in a dramatic interpretation of the original documentary. It incorporated some scenes from the original documentary. &quot;The Beaver Kid 2&quot; was shot on a budget of $100.

The trilogy is completed with &quot;The Orkly Kid&quot;, in which Crispin Glover reprises Penn&#x27;s role, this time referring to his onstage persona as &quot;Olivia Neutron Bomb&quot;. &quot;The Orkly Kid&quot; was shot in color film, is considerably longer in length and more professional-looking than the first two acts, and also features a number of new supporting characters and plot twists.

==Availability==
The filmmaker, Trent Harris, sells &quot;The Beaver Trilogy&quot; on DVD from his web store. As of 2007, the Salt Lake Film Society has a copy for rent which is available at the Tower Theatre.
In August 2016 a documentary about it, titled Beaver Trilogy Part IV, was made available to stream on Netflix.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
In an interview with Robert K. Elder for his book &quot;The Best Film You&#x27;ve Never Seen&quot;, director Phil Lord highlights the merits of the trilogy: &quot;To me, it felt like it was a film school education in 83 minutes. It’s a great treatise in story-telling and the different ways you can tell a story just with subtle changes.&quot;

==In other media==
===Radio===
The film was also featured in the episode &quot;Reruns&quot; of the public radio show &quot;This American Life&quot;, which first aired December 6, 2002.

==Sequel==
In 2015 a documentary about the film, called &quot;Beaver Trilogy Part IV&quot;, was released. It examined the relationship between the original film&#x27;s star Richard Griffiths and its director Trent Harris. It is narrated by Bill Hader.

Richard LaVon Griffiths, the original Groovin&#x27; Gary, died of a heart attack at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, Utah, on February 2, 2009, at age 50.

<text>Barnes is a small town in the far central south part of the Riverina and situated about north of Moama and north of Echuca.

Because of geography, it is in the sphere of influence of the adjoining state of Victoria, which explains why its railway connection goes to Victoria.

Barnes Post Office opened on 1 January 1928 and closed in 1972.

<text>The Australian state of New South Wales has an extensive network of railways, which were integral to the growth and development of the state. The vast majority of railway lines were government built and operated, but there were also several private railways, some of which operate to this day.

==Organisation==
During the 20th century, the railways have always been run by a state-owned entity, which has undergone a number of different minor name changes, including the New South Wales Railways, New South Wales Government Railways, Department of Railways. From 1972, it was part of the Public Transport Commission and from 1980, the State Rail Authority. In 1989, the SRA was split into CityRail, CountryLink and FreightCorp, the latter business being sold in 2001 to Pacific National.

Three government entities currently have responsibility for the New South Wales heavy rail lines. They are: 
*Transport Asset Holding Entity – asset owner
*Sydney Trains – infrastructure operator, maintainer, and operator of suburban train services, and
*NSW TrainLink – operator of regional train services

Since 2003, the NSW interstate, Sydney metropolitan freight, Hunter Valley coal, and country branch line networks have been run by private operators. Until January 2012, these networks were all operated by the Australian Rail Track Corporation, however control of the Country Regional (branch line) Network moved to John Holland in January 2012. In January 2022, UGL commenced a 10 year contract to operate the Country Regional Network.

==History==
New South Wales&#x27; railways date from 10 December 1831 when the Australian Agricultural Company officially opened Australia&#x27;s first railway, located at the intersection of Brown and Church Streets, Newcastle. Privately owned and operated to service the &quot;A Pit&quot; coal mine, it was a cast-iron fishbelly rail on an inclined plane as a gravitational railway.

Many proposals for routing the proposed lines were put forth, researched, surveyed and reported on. Three main routes for the Main Southern line were reported on by Mr Woore. There were three main routes researched for crossing the Blue Mountains requiring much effort just for the surveys.

The first public line was built from Sydney to Parramatta Junction (actually in Granville) and opened in 1855. The first six stations were; Sydney, Newtown, Ashfield, Burwood, Homebush, and Parramatta. The first common-carrier railway to operate in Australia, however, was the Melbourne &amp; Hobson&#x27;s Bay Railway Company, in Victoria, which opened on 12 September 1854, over a year before the Sydney–Parramatta Railway in NSW, which opened on 26 September 1855.

After two decisions to change the rail gauge, problems in raising capital and difficulties in construction, the line was opened in 1854, and lines have been built to standard gauge ever since. The Main Southern line was built in stages from Parramatta Junction to the Victorian border at Albury between 1855 and 1881 and connected to the Victorian Railways at a break-of-gauge in 1883.

The standard gauge connection from Albury to Melbourne was opened in 1962, completing the Sydney–Melbourne railway. Lines were built to connect the ports of Sydney and Newcastle to the rural interior, and the Main Western line was built from Parramatta Junction line to the north west of the state, reaching Bourke between 1860 and 1885. The Main North line was built from Newcastle to Wallangarra on the Queensland border and connecting with Queensland Railway&#x27;s line to Brisbane at a break of gauge between 1857 and 1888. Sydney and Newcastle were connected in 1889.

Much of the construction of the Main Western, Main Southern, and Main North lines were completed under the supervision of John Whitton, considered the Father of New South Wales railways, Engineer-in-Charge for the New South Wales Railways, serving between 1856 and 1899.

Construction of the shorter and single-gauge North Coast railway line between Sydney and Brisbane commenced in 1905 and was completed with the opening of the Grafton Bridge in 1932. The last main line was completed to Broken Hill in 1927, connecting with the South Australian Railways at a break of gauge. In 1970, the South Australian section was standardised, completing the Sydney–Perth standard gauge link. Meanwhile, branch lines proliferated over the settled east of the state, including the Illawarra line to Wollongong and Bomaderry completed in 1893. In 1926 work began on electrifying Sydney&#x27;s urban railways and connecting them together via new lines.

===Sydney suburban network===


The first company to start rail transport in New South Wales was the Sydney Railway Company which was incorporated on 10 October 1849 with the aim of building a railway from Sydney to Parramatta. Capital was raised, shares were sold, and a route was surveyed. The first sod was turned by Mrs Keith Stewart (daughter of the Governor) at Cleveland Paddocks (an area between the southern end of the current Sydney station and Cleveland Street) on 3 July 1850.

The original engineer appointed was Francis Webb Sheilds, an Irishman. He persuaded the New South Wales legislature to pass an Act on 27 July 1852 requiring all railways in the colony to be of gauge. This was the gauge in use in Ireland and is now referred to as broad gauge. After Sheilds resigned because of the difficulties, a Scot named James Wallace was appointed. Wallace persuaded the legislature to repeal the previous act and replace it, on 4 August 1853, with one requiring a gauge of – the current standard gauge of . (Unfortunately for Australia, the legislation requiring the broad gauge had been noted in the colonies of Victoria and South Australia and some rolling stock ordered.)

The Sydney Railway Company encountered many troubles: engineers came and went; real estate required became expensive and difficult to acquire; money, supplies and manpower ran short, partly because of a gold rush. Eventually the property of the Sydney Railway Company was transferred to the government of New South Wales on 3 September 1855.

The line opened on 26 September 1855, from Sydney to Parramatta Junction (near Granville station), with stations at Newtown, Ashfield, Burwood and Homebush. The Sydney terminal station was on the south side of Devonshire Street, just south of the current Central station. Although the vicinity was sometimes referred to as Redfern, it was not near the current Redfern station. This line is still the core line of the Sydney suburban rail system.

Sydney&#x27;s suburban rail network further developed from main line railways constructed in the 19th century, together with branches built in the late 19th and early 20th century. The existing network was electrified from 1926 at 1500 V DC under a plan by John Bradfield (in the 1920s and 1930s) and later modifications to his plan. In 1932, the Sydney Harbour Bridge was completed and the key inner city line from Central to Town Hall, Wynyard, Milsons Point and North Sydney was opened. In 1956, the Circular Quay station opened, completing the City Circle. The underground Eastern Suburbs railway was completed to Bondi Junction in 1979. In 2000, the line to Sydney Airport and Wolli Creek was opened, with the Epping to Chatswood Rail Link being opened in 2009. The most recent addition to the suburban network is the South West Rail Link, opened in 2015.

A branch line was built from Clyde to Camellia in 1888 and extended to Carlingford in 1896 by private companies. The line went bankrupt in 1896 and the Government purchased and reopened it in 1900. This line was Sydney Trains&#x27; Carlingford line which is closed and being converted to light rail.

Another branch was built from Lidcombe to Regents Park in 1912 and extended to join the Main Southern Line at Cabramatta in 1924, creating an alternative route to Liverpool.

===Main Southern line===
An extension of the line from Parramatta Junction to Liverpool was opened on the first anniversary of the Sydney–Parramatta line – 26 September 1856. It was extended to Campbelltown in 1858, Picton in 1863, Mittagong in 1867, Marulan in 1868, Goulburn in 1869, Yass Junction in 1876, Binalong in November 1876, Galong, Harden- Murrumburrah and Cootamundra in 1877, Junee in 1878, Wagga Wagga in 1879, Uranquinty, The Rock and Henty in 1880 and Albury in 1881.

Victorian Railways broad gauge line from Wodonga was extended to Albury station in 1883. The standard gauge connection from Albury to Melbourne was completed in 1962. A branch line was opened from Goulburn to Queanbeyan (1885) and Cooma (1887) and an line from Queanbeyan completed the connection to Canberra in 1914.

===Main Western line===
The Main Western line was extended from Granville to the current Parramatta station and Blacktown in 1860 and Penrith in 1863. It was built over the difficult topography of the Blue Mountains by using zig zag railways at Lapstone (opened in 1867) and Lithgow (opened in 1869). Both of these sections were replaced by deviations, using tunnels by 1913. The line was extended to Bathurst (1876), Orange (1877), Dubbo (1881), and Bourke (1885).

=== Broken Hill line ===
A section of the current main line from Sydney to Broken Hill, was built from Orange to Molong (1885), Parkes (1893), Condobolin (1898) and Trida (1919). A separate section of standard gauge line was also opened from Menindee to Broken Hill in 1919, which met the gauge Silverton Tramway at a break-of-gauge opened in 1888.

At Cockburn, the Silverton Tramway connected with the South Australian Railways system to Port Pirie and via a break of gauge at Terowie to Adelaide. The final missing link between Trida and Broken Hill was completed in 1927. In 1969 the Broken Hill – Port Pirie was standardised, completing the Sydney – Perth standard gauge link.

===Illawarra line===

The Illawarra line was opened in stages progressively southward from Sydney starting in 1884 and reaching Wollongong in 1887 and Bomaderry, near Nowra in 1893. A branch line was built from Sydenham to Belmore in 1895, Bankstown in 1909 and Regents Park in 1928, which became part of the Bankstown Line of the Sydney Trains transport network.

===Main North line===
The first section of the Main North line was built in the Hunter Valley by the New South Wales Government Railways in 1857. It was extended north to Wallangarra in various stages, reaching the Queensland border and connecting with Queensland Railway&#x27;s Southern line to Brisbane at a break-of-gauge in 1888. The final section between Strathfield and Newcastle was completed by the opening of the Hawkesbury River railway bridge in 1889.

===North Coast line===

The North Coast railway line was built between 1905 and 1932, and when completed, bypassed the Main North line and provided a quicker route up the eastern seaboard. The first part of the North Coast line was built between Casino and Grafton in 1905, as an extension of a line from Murwillumbah. It was extended from Casino to Kyogle in 1910 and South Brisbane in 1930. The section from Maitland junction to South Grafton was opened progressively between 1911 and 1922. The Clarence River at Grafton was the most difficult river to cross, and was the last section to be opened in 1932, upon completion of the Grafton Bridge.

=== Light rail ===

Light rail systems operate in Sydney and Newcastle. Some metropolitan heavy rail lines have been partially or substantially converted to light rail.

In Sydney, the Inner West Light Rail incorporates much of the former Rozelle–Darling Harbour Goods Line. Most of the Carlingford line and a portion the Sandown line, the latter leading to a depot, were incorporated into the Parramatta Light Rail. Meanwhile, the CBD and Southeast Light Rail was built anew, but much of its route mimics Sydney&#x27;s historic tram network.

The Newcastle line was truncated and part of the corridor utilised by the Newcastle Light Rail.

The Royal National Park branch, a former heavy rail line running from Loftus into the Royal National Park, is now operated by the Sydney Tramway Museum.

==Private railways==
A number of private lines were built to connect the South Maitland coalfields (discovered in 1886) with the Great Northern Railway at East Greta Junction near Maitland. By 1918 most of these had been merged into the South Maitland Railway.

A narrow gauge railway was built by South Australian Railways from Port Pirie to Broken Hill, in 1888 to serve its silver and lead mine, which was becoming the largest and richest of its kind in the world. Since the New South Wales Government would not allow the South Australia Railways to cross the border, the last was built by a private company as a tramway, the Silverton Tramway from Cockburn to Broken Hill. In 1970 the line was replaced by a standard gauge South Australia government line, completing the standard transcontinental gauge line from Sydney to Perth.

The Byron Bay Train is a passenger service in Byron Bay using a 620 class railcar converted for solar operation. It runs along a stretch of the Murwillumbah line.

A number of other private railways have been built in New South Wales to serve coal mines, steel works, notably the Port Kembla steel works, formerly operated by BHP (now BlueScope) and quarries, especially in the first half of the 20th century.

Though the networks are publicly owned, operation of services on light rail networks and Sydney Metro is contracted to private companies.

== Foreign railways ==
Because parts of New South Wales are closer to adjacent states than the state owned railway, foreign lines of different gauges have extended short distances into New South Wales.

These include:
* Silverton Tramway from South Australia to Broken Hill via Silverton – gauge
* Queensland Railways&#x27; South Coast line from Queensland to Tweed Heads – gauge. This line operated from 1903 to 1961 when the Qld Government closed the line
* Several hundred metres of gauge from the break-of-gauge station at Wallangarra, Queensland into yards in Jennings, NSW which remains in place

The Deniliquin line was the first gauge line to be extended into the state. Permission was granted to the Deniliquin &amp; Moama Railway Company by the New South Wales Government in 1874 to construct a line long line from Moama to Deniliquin, connecting with the Victorian Railways system at the Murray Bridge, near Echuca and the line was opened in 1876. This was followed in 1906 when an agreement was made between both states for the Victorian Railways Tocumwal line to be extended north into Tocumwal. Opened in 1908, both states shared construction costs for the line but the profit (or loss) would be Victoria&#x27;s.

The final stage was in 1917 when the Border Railway Commission (made up be representatives of both states) recommended favourably on the construction of four additional Victorian lines into New South Wales, culminating in the 1922 Border Railways Acts of both states. The Deniliquin &amp; Moama Railway Company was taken in 1923 at a cost of £165,000. New construction included the Balranald, Oaklands, Stony Crossing, and Lette lines. Only the Deniliquin and Oaklands lines are still open for traffic. Balranald was closed in stages from 1986 to 2008. Stony Crossing line was closed beyond the Victorian border in 1943. The Lette line was never opened. Construction, which began in 1926, reached Koorakee before further work was abandoned in 1943.

<doc id="1051772" wikidata="Q7600393" url="?curid=1051772" title="Staphylococcal enteritis">
<text>Staphylococcal enteritis is an inflammation that is usually caused by eating or drinking substances contaminated with staph enterotoxin. The toxin, not the bacterium, settles in the small intestine and causes inflammation and swelling. This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, dehydration, diarrhea and fever.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe, coccal (round shaped) bacteria that appears in grape-like clusters that can thrive in high salt and low water activity habitats. &quot;S. aureus&quot; bacteria can live on the skin which is one of the primary modes of transmission. &quot;S. aureus&quot; can cause a range of illnesses from minor skin infections to Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning enteritis.

Since humans are the primary source, cross-contamination is the most common way the microorganism is introduced into foods. Foods at high risks are those prepared in large quantities.
Staphylococcus aureus is a true food poisoning organism. It produces a heat stable enterotoxin when allowed to grow for several hours in foods such as cream-filled baked goods, poultry meat, gravies, eggs, meat salads, puddings and vegetables. The toxins may be present in dangerous amounts in foods that have no signs of spoilage, such as a bad smell, any off color, odor, or textural or flavor change.

Enteritis is the inflammation of the small intestine. It is generally caused by eating or drinking substances that are contaminated with bacteria or viruses. The bacterium and/or toxin settles in the small intestine and cause inflammation and swelling. This in turn can cause abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, fever, and dehydration. There are other types of enteritis, the types include: bacterial gastroenteritis, &quot;Campylobacter&quot; enteritis, &quot;E. coli&quot; enteritis, radiation enteritis, &quot;Salmonella&quot; enteritis and &quot;Shigella&quot; enteritis.

==Symptoms and signs==

Common symptoms of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; food poisoning include: a rapid onset which is usually 1–6 hours, nausea, explosive vomiting for up to 24 hours, abdominal cramps/pain, headache, weakness, diarrhea and usually a subnormal body temperature. Symptoms usually start one to six hours after eating and last less than 12 hours. The duration of some cases may take two or more days to fully resolve.

==Pathogenesis==
&quot;S. aureus&quot; is an enterotoxin producer. Enterotoxins are chromosomally encoded exotoxins that are produced and secreted from several bacterial organisms. It is a heat stable toxin and is resistant to digestive protease. It is the ingestion of the toxin that causes the inflammation and swelling of the intestine.

==Diagnosis==

For the detection of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; food poisoning which can lead to staphylococcal enteritis a stool culture may be required. A stool culture is used to detect the presence of disease-causing bacteria (pathogenic) and help diagnose an infection of the digestive tract. In the case of staphylococcal enteritis, it is conducted to see if the stool is positive for a pathogenic bacterium.

== Prevention ==

Staphylococcal enteritis may be avoided by using proper hygiene and sanitation with food preparation. This includes thoroughly cooking all meats. If food is to be stored longer than two hours, keep hot foods hot (over 140 °F) and cold foods cold (40 °F or under). Ensure to refrigerate leftovers promptly and store cooked food in a wide, shallow container and refrigerate as soon as possible. Sanitation is very important. Keep kitchens and food-serving areas clean and sanitized. Finally, as most staphylococcal food poisoning are the result of food handling, hand washing is critical. Food handlers should use hand sanitizers with alcohol or thorough hand washing with soap and water.

Tips for hand washing:

1. Wash hands with warm, soapy water before and after handling raw foods.
:a. First, wet your hands.
:b. Add soap to your hands.
:c. Rub both sides for at least 20 seconds.
:d. Rinse thoroughly.
:e. Air dry, or dry your hands with a clean towel or paper towel.

2. Always wash your hands after using the bathroom, after changing a baby&#x27;s diaper, after touching pets or other animals, and after sneezing or coughing

3. Properly dress or glove.

== Treatment ==
Treatment is supportive and based upon symptoms, with fluid and electrolyte replacement as the primary goal. Dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting is the most common complication. To prevent dehydration, it is important to take frequent sips of a rehydration drink (like water) or try to drink a cup of water or rehydration drink for each large, loose stool.

Dietary management of enteritis consists of starting with a clear liquid diet until vomiting and diarrhea end and then slowly introduce solid foods. It is also important to avoid foods that are high in fiber or are possibly difficult to digest.

<text>William Russ (born October 20, 1950) is an American actor and television director. He played Alan Matthews on the sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; (1993–2000) and appeared in the television series &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, the soap operas &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and the feature films &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983), &quot;Pastime&quot; (1990) and &quot;American History X&quot; (1998).

==Career==

Russ&#x27; acting first began on the New York stage before he embarked onto a television and film career. In 1977, he had his first supporting role in &quot;Death Bed: The Bed That Eats&quot;. This film would not be officially released until 2003.

During the 1980s, Russ found work in more supporting roles such as &quot;Crisis at Central High&quot; (1981), a television film also starring Academy Award winning actress Joanne Woodward, &quot;The Border&quot; (1981), &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983) as Slick Goodlin, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; (1986) and &quot;Crime Story&quot; (1986).

He continued finding work in both television and film. He also guest-starred in the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in the notable 1985 episode &quot;Evan&quot; as the title character, an ATF agent who shared a history with Don Johnson&#x27;s character, Sonny Crockett. He made fourteen appearances on the 1987–1990 crime drama &quot;Wiseguy&quot; as Roger Lococco.

Russ received critical acclaim when he starred in &quot;Pastime&quot; (1991) as Roy Dean Bream, a veteran minor league hurler who mentors a young phenomenon. The role earned him a nomination at the 1992 Independent Spirit Awards for &quot;Best Male Lead.&quot;

In 1993, he was cast as Alan Matthews on the television sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. Russ played this role until the series ended in 2000. Russ also directed several episodes of the series during the last three seasons. His other television directing credits include directing one episode of both &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; and &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;.

However, he continued performing in other series and films throughout his time on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, primarily television films. In 1998, he performed as Danny and Derek Vinyard&#x27;s father in the critically acclaimed &quot;American History X&quot;. Later, he starred in the short-lived television serial drama &quot;Mister Sterling&quot;.

In fall 2009, it was announced that Russ would be cast as the new character Tucker on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. Russ&#x27; time on the show was short, however, as it has been announced the role of Tucker was being recast with Stephen Nichols replacing Russ in the role.

Russ is the star of the comedy web series &quot;Home at Last&quot;. In the series, he portrays &quot;Bob&quot;, a homeless man who moves in with the son he abandoned at birth.

In 2014, Russ reprised his role of Alan Matthews from &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; on its spinoff &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;. In season 2, he joined the production crew, and directed one episode, being the only cast member to direct episodes of both &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; and &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;.

<text>Joseph Quincy Mitchell (July 27, 1908 – May 24, 1996) was an American writer best known for his works of creative nonfiction he published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His work primarily consists of character studies, where he used detailed portraits of people and events to highlight the commonplace of the world, especially in and around New York City.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Mitchell was born on July 27, 1908, on his maternal grandfather&#x27;s farm near Fairmont, North Carolina, and was the son of Averette Nance and Elizabeth Amanda Parker Mitchell. He had five younger siblings: Jack, Elizabeth, Linda, Harry, and Laura. Mitchell&#x27;s father, a fourth generation cotton and tobacco farmer, was a Southerner steeped in the values of the Baptist church, and he tried to instill these values into his children. As his eldest son, Averette hoped that Mitchell would someday take over the family business and continue the family&#x27;s legacy.

Mitchell&#x27;s adventurous personality as a child contradicted his father&#x27;s staunch work ethic and traditional Southern values. From a young age, Mitchell was deeply touched by nature. He loved to climb trees, and it was one of the few activities that allowed an outlet for his young imagination to develop. He also tended to escape to the swamps surrounding his father&#x27;s property as often as he could, as it allowed him to feel connected to the world around him. Mitchell stated, &quot;the water mesmerized me; everything in it interested me, still or moving, dead or alive.&quot;

=== Education ===
Mitchell left home and attended college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1925. As a journalism major, he was &quot;a solid if not superior student,&quot; and he was successful in humanities courses such as history, language, music, and literature and explored classes in nearly every subject. Aside from his studies, he began writing for the campus literary magazine and newspaper as a sports reporter. Because he had no aptitude for mathematics, he was unable to successfully finish his degree. He left college and moved to New York City in 1929.

=== Family ===
On February 27, 1932, he married Therese Jacobsen, a reporter and photographer. They remained married until her death in 1980, and had two daughters, Nora and Elizabeth.

=== Mental health ===
Joseph Mitchell suffered from depression all of his life. An unsteady relationship with his father and his lack of belonging in his two homes of North Carolina and New York left Mitchell isolated and listless for much of his life. He lived in an era of psychology that focused purely on anxiety, and doctors regarded depression as a severe side effect of existing anxiety. However, symptoms of this condition did not clearly manifest in his life until late in his career. Many of Mitchell&#x27;s coworkers, as well as his biographer, Thomas Kunkel, tell of the toll the subjects of his works had on him, specifically his greatest subject, Joe Gould. Mitchell once remarked to &quot;Washington Post&quot; writer David Streitfeld, &quot;You pick someone so close that, in fact, you are writing about yourself. Joe Gould had to leave home because he didn&#x27;t fit in, the same way I had to leave home because I didn&#x27;t fit in. Talking to Joe Gould all those years he became me in a way, if you see what I mean.&quot; Even with Joe Gould as a way to explore his own reality, Mitchell began to attract characters with similar attributes. In a feature within &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, Charles McGrath notes that &quot;the critic Stanley Edgar Hyman first pointed out that the people Mitchell wrote about more and more resembled himself: loners, depressives, nostalgists, haunters of the waterfront, cherishers of arcane information. The characters in his pieces began to share a similar voice; they all sounded a little like Mitchell.&quot;

From 1964 until his death in 1996, Mitchell would go to work at his office on a daily basis, but he never published anything further, other than the &quot;Author&#x27;s Note&quot; introducing &quot;Up in the Old Hotel.&quot; Although he struggled to publish, he did write hundreds of pages of manuscripts for several pieces, including his own memoir, which Thomas Kunkel used extensively in writing Mitchell&#x27;s biography. After he died, his colleague Roger Angell wrote:Each morning, he stepped out of the elevator with a preoccupied air, nodded wordlessly if you were just coming down the hall, and closed himself in his office. He emerged at lunchtime, always wearing his natty brown fedora (in summer, a straw one) and a tan raincoat; an hour and a half later, he reversed the process, again closing the door. Not much typing was heard from within, and people who called on Joe reported that his desktop was empty of everything but paper and pencils. When the end of the day came, he went home. Sometimes, in the evening elevator, I heard him emit a small sigh, but he never complained, never explained.While his battle with mental illness continued in the workplace, he was known by his family as a dependable and caring father and husband at home. Therese Jacobson and their children, Nora and Elizabeth, retained nothing but fond memories of their father, even though they knew he was struggling in his career.

=== Death ===
In 1995, Mitchell was diagnosed with lung cancer after he began experiencing back pain. The cancer eventually spread and metastasized in his brain. On May 24, 1996, Mitchell died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan at the age of 87. He was laid to rest in Floyd Memorial Cemetery in his hometown of Fairmont, North Carolina next to his wife. On his gravestone his daughters inscribed a quote from Shakespeare&#x27;s seventy-third sonnet, one of his favorite lines in literature: &quot;Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.&quot;

== Career ==

Mitchell came to New York City in 1929, at the age of 21, with the ambition of becoming a political reporter. He worked for such newspapers as &quot;The World&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, and the &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;, at first covering crime and then doing interviews, profiles, and character sketches. In 1931, he took a break from journalism to work on a freighter that sailed to Leningrad and brought back pulp logs to New York City. He returned to journalism later that year and continued to write for New York newspapers until he was hired by St. Clair McKelway at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1938. He remained with the magazine until his death in 1996.

His book &quot;Up in the Old Hotel&quot; collects the best of his writing for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and his earlier book &quot;My Ears Are Bent&quot; collects the best of his early journalistic writing, which he omitted from &quot;Up in the Old Hotel&quot;. Mitchell&#x27;s last book was his empathetic account of the Greenwich Village street character and self-proclaimed historian Joe Gould&#x27;s extravagantly disguised case of writer&#x27;s block, published as &quot;Joe Gould&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1964). Mitchell served on the board of directors of the Gypsy Lore Society, was one of the founders of the South Street Seaport Museum, was involved with the Friends of Cast-Iron Architecture, and served five years on the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. In August 1937, he placed third in a clam-eating tournament on Block Island by eating 84 cherrystone clams. In 2008, The Library of America selected Mitchell&#x27;s story &quot;Execution&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime. The February 11, 2013, edition of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; includes a previously unpublished portion of Mitchell&#x27;s unfinished autobiography entitled &quot;Street Life: Becoming Part of the City.&quot;

== Central themes ==

=== Character study ===
Seen throughout Joseph Mitchell&#x27;s oeuvre is his distinct focus on the underdog characters, or the laymen of NYC, and the focus on unexpected characters. For example, Mazie is a central focus for a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article bearing her name. “Mazie” first appears in the print edition of the December 21, 1940, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The piece, later published in Mitchell&#x27;s collection of essays in &quot;Up in the Old Hotel,&quot; creates and canonizes Mazie, a woman who worked in the ticket booth of The Venice theater. Mitchell&#x27;s meticulous reporting skills result in an account of Mazie complete with factual details, close observation, and direct quotations. Critics believe Mazie resembles Mitchell himself: they share an affinity for remembering small facts and giving attention to the overlooked members of society. Mazie P. Gordon is tough and blunt. Detective Kain of the Oak Street Police Station declares that Mazie “has the roughest tongue and the softest heart in the Third Precinct. In Mitchell&#x27;s profile, her life is confined to the ticket booth of the movie theater where she socializes with “bums” that come and go from the surrounding flophouses. Direct conversations detail her interactions with her community.  

Mitchell was open to taking on the challenge of profiling the female central character of Mazie. The writing process was challenging until his central character would give him “the revealing remark.” The 1938 &quot;World Telegram&quot; description of Mazie P. Gordon reveals she was known as “Miss Mazie” to the men she interacted with around the Venice Theatre. She is blonde, kind, and has exaggerated hair and makeup. Two years later, when Mitchell profiled Mazie in &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; some critics called Mitchell an anthropologist in his description. Mazie becomes more than just a blonde and kind woman, and instead is shown to be complex and strong-willed. Mitchell&#x27;s close observation of Mazie set a new standard for writers and reporters. Mitchell&#x27;s curiosity without judgement inspired writers to continue Mazie&#x27;s legacy.

The character of Mazie is popularized by the novel &quot;Saint Mazie&quot; by Jami Attenberg. She encountered “Mazie” through Mitchell&#x27;s collection of his magazine pieces, and used Mitchell&#x27;s profile to fashion Mazie into a fictional character. Ultimately, Mazie archetypes Mitchell&#x27;s distinct characteristics that intrigue readers. Much of this intrigue, for all of Mitchell&#x27;s underdog characters, comes from the access he provides into the lives of the people that the readers of the New Yorker wouldn&#x27;t normally meet. &quot;The Rivermen&quot;, for instance, would be irrelevant people to most of NYC citizens until Mitchell brings them into focus for the readers. In yet another way, &quot;Rats on the Waterfront (Thirty-Two Rats From Casablanca)&quot; tells a compelling story where the central character is not even human. Mitchell&#x27;s focus on these unlikely characters gives his nonfiction a very distinct character.

=== Time and passing ===
The term &quot;Mitchell time&quot; was coined by novelist Thomas Beller to describe the gauzy effect in Mitchell&#x27;s writings. He goes on to further describe Mitchell&#x27;s temporal dimension as a &quot;strange and twilight place where a density of historical fact and the feeling of whole eras fading from view are sharply juxtaposed with the senses of cinematic immediacy related in the present tense.&quot; Mitchell&#x27;s distinctive voice can be seen in many, if not all, of his works. The most notable example of &quot;Mitchell time&quot; is seen in the story Mr. Hunter&#x27;s Grave where the narrative tells of the overlapping of many eras occurring in one small location.

=== Landscape study ===
Joseph Mitchell was born in North Carolina, yet throughout the majority of his writing career he centered his writing around New York City and its subjects. He brought a distinct and unique style of reporting to NYC that stemmed from his Southern upbringing. Mitchell was said to have brought the ultimate Southern courtesy of accepting “people on their own terms”. Although he was a Brooklyn police reporter at first, by the time he moved to work in Harlem he began to connect with the “raffish side” of the NYC borough and it was here that his deep affection for NYC and its people started to blossom. Scholars claim that Mitchell&#x27;s 1959 collection entitled &quot;The Bottom of the Harbor&quot; is his best and most “elegiac account of New York”. It is here that Mitchell references not only the underdog characters of NYC, but also the underdog places - such as the Fulton Fish Market; a reoccurring place of study in this water based collection. For example, &quot;Dragger Captain&quot; is “the story of an old salt in the fleet out of Stonington, Connecticut, that supplies the Fulton Fish Market with flounder”. But it is once again Mitchell&#x27;s character selection in &quot;The Bottom of the Harbor&quot; that allows him to portray NYC in his signature matte style. The subjects &quot;are mainly old men, they are custodians of memory, their stories a link with the history of a city that has always been mercantile at heart.&quot; Additionally, Mitchell liked to visit the Edgewater Cemetery, which was the inspiration for one of his most famous articles - &quot;Mr. Hunter’s Grave&quot;. From North Carolina he “brought an interest in wildflowers” and these flowers “could be found most easily in overgrown cemeteries around New York City.” Mitchell managed to discover these quaint everyday places as he would often set off to work in his &quot;New Yorker&quot; office, but instead, he would carry on walking, taking in NYC and its landscape. Indeed, much of Mitchell&#x27;s work was conceived due to his enchanted meandering of NYC where he “walked the city incessantly . . . little escaped his notice” 

== Selected works ==

=== &quot;Up in the Old Hotel&quot; ===
In Joseph Mitchell&#x27;s feature &quot;Up in the Old Hotel&#x27;,&quot; Mitchell explores the Fulton Fish Market of New York, specifically Sloppy Louie&#x27;s Restaurant. He features the owner of the space, and explores the character in full before adventuring up the old elevator shaft with Louie and exploring the abandoned and sectioned-off old hotel space.

In his opening, Mitchell surveys the personality of the man he has this experience with, setting the mood for the entire piece. Louie is an Italian immigrant who worked for years in restaurants around the city until The Crash of 1929, when the property that is now his restaurant finally came into his price range. It was never the flashiest or nicest building, but it was near the market and was successful in housing a small restaurant. Louie is constantly experimenting with his dishes, making his shop the place to stop and try a new kind of fish, or other seafood. Growing up in a small Italian fishing village himself, he does not shy away from different flavors and possibilities with his fish. He&#x27;s a humble and gentlemanly man who adds an air of propriety and humility to everything he does; he works the same as any of his employees to keep his restaurant running, doing the same jobs, and always keeps a white cloth folded over his arm for the sake of class, even when he&#x27;s only running the register. He maintains relationships with his regular customers, like Mitchell, and fosters business relationships with the fishermen that bring their catches to the dock for sale at the Fulton Market.

&quot;Up in the Old Hotel&quot; isn&#x27;t just the story of Louie, or Sloppy Louie&#x27;s, but about the closed-off elevator shaft that not even Louie has ever traveled up into. This comes about over breakfast, when Louie tells Mitchell he may need to add extra tables to the second floor of his place to make up for the growing lunch crowds coming in. When Mitchell points out he has four empty floors above them, Louie explains that only the first two floors have stairs to access them, and the rest of the building is closed off. Out of pure curiosity, Mitchell agrees to be the man who will go up to the unused four floors with Louie for the first time, when the opportunity arises. The elevator shaft, the equipment, nor the space above have not been used or even really touched since it was closed off, making it a particularly risky endeavor for both of the men, and upon realizing it is safe to use, they travel up to the old hotel that hasn&#x27;t been seen by anyone in  decades.

Up on the first blocked floor, the two men find the remains of what was once a high-end hotel, finding bureaus with playing cards, hangers, mirrors, and the sign to the reading room. The environment itself is depressing to Mitchell, and he decids the leave immediately, so neither of the men bother to go to the floor above them. 

This feature by Mitchell really clings to his notions of the passage of time, and the coming change in New York, and the rest of the world.

=== &quot;Mr. Hunter&#x27;s Grave&quot; ===

&quot;Mr. Hunter&#x27;s Grave&quot; was published by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on September 22, 1956. To this day, the piece remains one of Mitchell&#x27;s biggest journalistic successes, with an array of positive reviews. &quot;Mr. Hunter&#x27;s Grave&quot; was republished in one of Mitchell&#x27;s collections, &quot;Up In The Old Hotel&quot;, which was released in 1992. The article is based on an encounter Joseph Mitchell had with an African-American man named George Hunter, who lived in Sandy Ground, a black community in Staten Island, one that is credited with being the oldest, established, free black community in the United States.

This article in particular begins with what one could consider a “typical Mitchell day” and allows for the reader to get closer to Mitchell, in a sense. One day, Mitchell wakes up, admittedly feeling stressed from his surroundings, packs a couple sandwiches, and decides to go down to Staten Island to explore the cemeteries. Mitchell walks the reader through a number of cemeteries he enjoys walking in on days like that day, which include places such as “Woodrow Methodist Church on Woodrow Road in the Woodrow community, or to the cemetery of St. Luke’s Episcopal Church on the Arthur Kill Road in the Rossville community, or to one on the Arthur Kill Road on the outskirts of Rossville” before leading the reader to The South Shore, a more rural part of Staten Island, where trees tend to dominate, and a place where some of the oldest graveyards can be found, (Mitchell). Mitchell continues his exploration of several graveyards, stopping at gravestones, studying them, reading the names off them, and moving vines and dirt from certain ones he ponders upon. Mitchell begins to grow weary, preparing to leave the graveyard off of Rossville until he notices a wildflower that catches his attention, drawn to the grave of a Rachel Dissoway, which is when Mitchell is noticed by the rector of the graveyard, Mr. Brock.

The two men discuss Mitchell&#x27;s interest in wild flowers, particularly peppergrass, which leads to Mr. Brock telling Mitchell about a cemetery in a black community off of Bloomingdale Road. Mr. Brock gives Mitchell the contact of a Mr. G. Hunter, who is the chairman of trustees of the Methodist Church in the community, Sandy Ground, where Mitchell would like to go look for peppergrass. Mitchell, using the information given to him by Mr. Brock, contacts Mr. Hunter, and sets up a time to meet the man at his house that coming Saturday morning, for him to explore Sandy Ground. 

On Saturday morning, Mitchell arrives at Mr. Hunter&#x27;s home, where he is greeted by Mr. Hunter, who at the time of his arrival is icing a cake. In the time while Mitchell is at Mr. Hunter&#x27;s home, Mitchell learns a great deal about the history of Sandy Ground. While in the kitchen, the two men discuss various things, such as the wildflower pokeweed. The older women of Sandy Ground, including Mr. Hunter&#x27;s mother, believed that its roots had healing properties, even though others generally regard them as poisonous. Following this, there&#x27;s commentary about what kind of wood Mr. Hunter&#x27;s house is built of, and talk about how much he despises flies while the two men are sitting on the porch (as well as a discussion about the history of Sandy Ground, which started due to the wanting of oysters). Following the incident with the flies, Mr. Hunter and Mitchell begin their trip to the graveyard.

On the way to the graveyard, Mitchell discusses more discussion regarding Mr. Hunter&#x27;s family and himself, including the fact that Mr. Hunter wasn&#x27;t born in the South, but his mother was; more so, his mother was a slave from Virginia, and her mother before her. After Mr. Hunter&#x27;s mother&#x27;s slavery days, she moved to Brooklyn, where she met and married his father, although after his father served a sentence, the family moved to Sandy Ground, hoping to get work by harvesting oysters. After his father&#x27;s death, Mr. Hunter&#x27;s mother married a man from Sandy Ground, who Mr. Hunter did not much care for, but goes into the history of his step family nonetheless. Mr. Hunter then goes on to discuss how he too became a drunk, and several jobs he had such as a bricklayer and a business owner, before marrying his first wife. Mr. Hunter reveals that he was married twice, and lost both his wives. He also reveals that he had a son who died. 

After this revelation, the two men enter the cemetery. They discuss different roots, some of which Mitchell is familiar with, and one he is not, until they come across a grave that Mr. Hunter says is his Uncle&#x27;s. Mr. Hunter, while Mitchell explores a little more, works on getting the vines off the gravestone, so the two men can better observe it. 
Following this, the two men stop at a number of different graves, with Mr. Hunter narrating short life stories of each individual they tend to stop at. The routine of stopping, narrating, and continuing comes to a cease upon the two men reaching Mr. Hunter&#x27;s plot, where he will actually not be buried due to a mishap, which Mr. Hunter explains clearly and emotionally, admitting it outraged him. Taking two steps further, Mr. Hunter shows Mitchell where he will be buried in all actuality, stating, “&#x27;Ah, well, (…), it won’t make any difference&#x27;” ending the article, (Mitchell).

The article, like many others acquired a level of scrutiny following the publication of a Mitchell biography written by Thomas Kunkel in 2015. Kunkel&#x27;s biography brought to light several fascinating facts about Joseph Mitchell&#x27;s life, however, some of the information opened a wormhole, specifically the revelation that certain pieces of Mitchell&#x27;s articles were fabricated and the period of time of which the events took place shortened. Many critics, it appears, were distraught, including Michael Rosenwald, a writer for the Columbia Journalism Review. Following the publication of the book, Rosenwald wrote an article entitled, “‘I Wish This Guy Hadn’t Written This Book’”. 

In this article, Rosenwald explores his own relationship with Mitchell, stating how the man influenced both himself and other generations of writers and how his favorite article by him is &quot;Mr. Hunter&#x27;s Grave&quot;, then goes into his disappointment about what was put in the Kunkel biography, stating, “For me, learning these things was like a kid discovering his favorite baseball player whacked long home runs while juicing on steroids,” showing the betrayal he felt. Rosenwald&#x27;s article includes the opinion of another well respected journalist, Gay Talese, who Rosenwald is friends with. Upon reading the biography, and hearing about it himself, Rosenwald records that Talese said something along the lines of, “&#x27;To hear that one of the guys I grew up admiring did things I don’t think I’d want to be accused of doing, it’s troubling and sad&#x27;”.

=== &quot;Dragger Captain&quot; ===
In January 1947 &quot;Dragger Captain&quot; appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in two parts. In this profile Mitchell talks to and follows 47-year-old Ellery Thompson who is captain of a dragger boat named &quot;Eleanor.&quot; The &quot;Eleanor&quot; works out of Stonington port in Connecticut. Mitchell chooses Ellery Thompson as he is “the most skillful and the most respected of the captain in the Stonington fleet”. Mitchell and Captain Thompson soon find that they have compatible personalities, allowing Mitchell to accompany Ellery during his drags. Throughout the article we gradually learn more about Ellery as a person and not just a dragger captain. Ellery&#x27;s brother, Morris, died at sea trying to combat poor sailing conditions to try and make a living. Ellery has to then drag for his own brother&#x27;s body, giving us an insight as to the reason why Ellery looks upon life “with a droll world-weariness”. 

But Ellery is also a kind and thoughtful man. For example, unlike other draggers, he keeps the best lobster he catches for himself and his crew. When the oceanographers from Yale University sail with him on the &quot;Eleanor&quot; one day a month he flies an “old Yale pennant”. The article closes with Frank, one of Ellery&#x27;s two crew mates, telling an interesting folk tale. The story is about Old Chrissy, “an old rascal of a woman that was the head of a gang of Block Island wreckers”. The gig was that Chrissy and her crew would lure ships in “with false lights, &amp; they killed the sailors &amp; the passengers, so there wouldn&#x27;t be any tales told”. On one occasion she unknowingly lures in her own son&#x27;s ship. But, she chooses to “clout him on the head. ‘A son’s a son,’ she said, ‘but a wreck’s a wreck”.

“Dragger Captain” was met with much critical acclaim. So much so, that the rights were acquired by Warner Brothers and it was rumored that they were going to “develop it for Gary Cooper”. Thompson was promised 10% of any proceeds by Mitchell. Ultimately though, nothing came of the rumors with Mitchell calling it “studio commissary gossip” and stating that “the only truth in it is that a writer has been assigned to try and work out a script on dragger finishing, using the Profile as background”.

=== &quot;Joe Gould&#x27;s Secret&quot; ===
In &quot;Joe Gould&#x27;s Secret&quot; (1965), Mitchell expanded upon two earlier &quot;New Yorker&quot; profiles, “Professor Sea Gull” (1942) and “Joe Gould’s Secret” (1964), concerning Joe Gould, an eccentric bohemian living in New York City. Following Gould&#x27;s death, Mitchell embarks on a search for the massive book Gould had long claimed to be writing, &quot;An Oral History of Our Time&quot;. Mitchell soon learns that the purportedly nine-million-word work of oral history does not exist. However, he finds that Gould is a popular and central figure within a number of New York circles. Extending Mitchell&#x27;s abiding concerns with the anti-hero and the New York landscape, &quot;Joe Gould&#x27;s Secret&quot; also captures the essence of Gould&#x27;s non-existent oral history by preserving the life and voice of Joe Gould. 

Gould&#x27;s writing is digressive and self-referential; however, Mitchell&#x27;s writing in &quot;Joe Gould’s Secret&quot; diverges from his previous works. Mitchell often speaks in first person while offering personal accounts and memories revolving around the plot. Furthermore, Gould&#x27;s nonexistent “Oral History” is an attempt to capture the voices of the plebeian class, or the anti-heroes. Mitchell&#x27;s entire work, especially &quot;Joe Gould’s Secret&quot;, captures the selfsame essence. His work often revolves around character study, in which he captures Joe Gould&#x27;s profile. Gould struggles with writing and rewriting the first few chapters of his “Oral History” because of writer&#x27;s block. Ironically, Mitchell, himself, is struggling with a degree of writer&#x27;s block in which he was unable, later in life, to continue his previous writing output.  

== Critical reception ==
Critical reviews of Mitchell&#x27;s works are almost overwhelmingly positive. Many critics have labeled Mitchell &quot;the best reporter in the country&quot; and marked him as the writer with whom &quot;any writer with aspirations in literary journalism...has to reckon with,&quot; and the writer that &quot;transform[ed] the craft of reporting into art&quot;. William Zinsser states that Mitchell serves as the &quot;primary textbook&quot; for &quot;nonfiction writers of any generation&quot;. Critics credit Mitchell&#x27;s strength as a writer to his &quot;skills as an interviewer, photographic representation of his characters and their speech, deadpan humor, and graceful, unadorned prose style&quot;. Critics also note that it is Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;respect and compassion for his subjects&quot; that allows him to explore uncomfortable themes like &quot;mortality, change, and the past&quot;. Throughout Mitchell&#x27;s career, he has been praised for his &quot;ear for dialogue and eye for detail, genuine interest in the lives of his subjects, rhythmic, simple prose&quot;.  For many critics, Mitchell serves as the model writer for &quot;generations of nonfiction writers&quot; In the latter part of Mitchell&#x27;s career, critics began to note that the tone of his writing had become &quot;increasingly nostalgic&quot; but that he retained his &quot;earthly sense of humor and obvious delight in making new discoveries about New York&quot;. One notable literary critic, Noel Perrin, notes that &quot;Mitchell described the life and even the very soul of New York as perhaps no one else ever has&quot;. Other critics question Mitchell&#x27;s legacy as a journalist because of his tendency to &quot;cross a line&quot; between fiction and nonfiction, often &quot;shaping the facts&quot; of his stories to offer &quot;the core &#x27;truth&#x27; of the story&quot; rather than &quot;its interior factuality&quot;. One critic asks, &quot;knowing [Mitchell] fabricated and embellished, how should we view his legacy?&quot;

==In popular culture==
In 2000, &quot;Joe Gould&#x27;s Secret&quot;, a feature film directed by Stanley Tucci and written by Howard A. Rodman, was released. It focuses on the relationship between Mitchell (played by Tucci) and Joe Gould (Ian Holm) during the 1940s.

Mitchell is portrayed in &quot;The Blackwell Series&quot;, an indie computer game series revolving around paranormal themes. In the second game of the series, the player encounters Mitchell during the prolonged writer&#x27;s block of his later years. In the third game of the series, the player encounters ghosts of both Mitchell and Joe Gould.

Mitchell is referenced by a Baltimore Sun editor, Gus Haynes, in the last episode of the HBO drama &quot;The Wire&quot;. Steve Earle&#x27;s song &quot;Down Here Below&quot;, from &quot;Washington Square Serenade&quot;, mentions Mitchell directly saying, “I saw Joe Mitchell&#x27;s ghost on a downtown &#x27;A&#x27; train. He just rides on forever now that the Fulton Fish Market&#x27;s shut down.&quot;

<doc id="1051806" wikidata="Q6806708" url="?curid=1051806" title="Medicine Hat (provincial electoral district)">
<text>Medicine Hat was a provincial electoral district in Alberta, Canada, mandated to return members to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1905 to 1971, and again from 1979 to 2019. The electoral district was named after the City of Medicine Hat.

==History==
The electoral district of Medicine Hat has existed in two iterations. The Medicine Hat electoral district was one of the original 25 electoral districts contested in the 1905 Alberta general election upon Alberta joining Confederation in September 1905. The district was carried over from the old Medicine Hat electoral district which returned a single member to the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1888 to 1905. The member for the Northwest Territories seat, William Finlay would be elected in the 1st Alberta general election. Upon the electoral district&#x27;s formation, it covered a large portion of rural south east Alberta. The district shrunk until it became an urban only riding surrounding the City of Medicine Hat.

The district was abolished in the 1971 electoral district re-distribution to become part of Medicine Hat-Redcliff, which was abolished in 1979 and once again became the Medicine Hat electoral district.

Under the 2004 Alberta electoral boundary re-distribution, the constituency covered the portion of the city north of the South Saskatchewan River, the Trans-Canada Highway and Carry Drive. The rest of the city and surrounding area was part of the Cypress-Medicine Hat constituency.

The 2010 electoral boundary re-distribution saw minor changes made to align the riding with new boundaries of Medicine Hat.

The Medicine Hat electoral district was dissolved in the 2017 electoral boundary re-distribution, and portions of the district would incorporate the Brooks-Medicine Hat to the North, and Cypress-Medicine Hat to the South for the 2019 Alberta general election.

===Boundary history===


===Representation history===

The provincial electoral district of Medicine Hat has a long history that goes back to 1888 under the old Medicine Hat, North-West Territories electoral district. The district was carried over when the province of Alberta was created in 1905.

The first election in 1905 saw former North-West Territories Assembly member William Finlay win the district in a hotly contested race. Finlay was re-elected in 1909 and resigned in 1910 so cabinet minister Charles Mitchell could have a seat in the Legislature.

Mitchell only held the district for one term before being defeated by Conservative Nelson Spencer in the 1913 election. Spencer&#x27;s win was considered an upset. Spencer was re-elected by acclamation under Chapter 38 of the Elections Act in 1917 for serving in the Canadian Army during World War I. He retired from the Legislature in 1921 and moved to British Columbia.

The Liberal government passed a law in 1921 that turned Medicine Hat into a two-member constituency during the 5th Legislature. The two seats were won by United Farmers candidate Peren Baker who headed the polls and William Johnston, a Dominion Labor Party candidate who finished second. Baker was confirmed to a cabinet post by acclamation in a ministerial by-election on December 9, 1921.

Johnson died in 1925, vacating his seat. The by-election saw former Speaker of the Legislature Charles Pingle win the district for the Liberal party.

The district was once again mandated to return two members in 1926. This time they were elected through Single transferable voting. Pingle stood for re-election. Baker moved to the Cypress electoral district. Liberal Pingle and Conservative J.J. Hendricks were elected in this election. This was the first - and only - election held in this district using STV. Before the next general election the vote district was re-drawn smaller and only given one member and the method of election was changed to Instant-runoff voting.

Pingle died in 1928, forcing another by-election. Liberal candidate Hector Lang retained the seat for the party. He was re-elected in 1930 and was defeated, when he ran for a third term in 1935, by Social Credit candidate John Robinson.

Robinson held the district for five terms, being re-elected in 1940, 1944, 1948 and 1952. He was appointed Minister of Industries and Labour by Premier Ernest Manning in 1948 and held that post until his death in 1953.

The by-election in 1953 saw John Robinson&#x27;s wife Elizabeth Robinson retain the seat for Social Credit. She held the district for three terms before dying in 1961.

The last by-election held in the district in 1961 saw Harry Leinweber become the third member of Social Credit to win the district. He was re-elected in 1963 and 1967 before retiring in 1971.

Medicine Hat was redistributed to include the town of Redcliff in 1971 boundary redistribution. The new riding was called Medicine Hat-Redcliff. The electoral district of Medicine Hat was re-created in 1979 containing just the city of Medicine Hat.

The first election in the new Medicine Hat district saw former Medicine Hat-Redcliff incumbent Jim Horsman won the district in a landslide winning a 10,000 vote margin over the second place candidate. He would improve on that victory winning his biggest margin in the 1982 general election finishing almost 12,000 votes ahead of second place.

===1921 by-election===

Due to laws existing in the Legislative Assembly Act a series of ministerial by-elections were needed to confirm members appointed to the Greenfield government. Seven by-elections in total were called for an election day of December 9, 1921. This was set for one week after the 1921 Canadian federal election.

The by-election writ was dropped on November 16, 1921, United Farmers incumbent Perren Baker who had been appointed as Minister of Education ran unopposed and was acclaimed at the nomination deadline held on December 2, 1921. The timing of the by-elections was deliberately chosen to coincide with the federal election to ensure that opposition candidates would be unlikely to oppose the cabinet ministers.

#William McCombs was a candidate jointly nominated by the United Farmers of Alberta and the Dominion Labor Party. The party percent change is reflected from the combined party percentages in the 1921 general election.

==Plebiscite results==

===1948 electrification lebiscite===
District results from the first province wide plebiscite on electricity regulation.
===1957 liquor plebiscite===

On October 30, 1957 a stand-alone plebiscite was held province wide in all 50 of the then current provincial electoral districts in Alberta. The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.

The plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton asked if men and woman were allowed to drink together in establishments.

Province wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Medicine Hat just barely voted in favour of the proposal with the difference between Yes and No being four votes. Voter turnout in the district was slightly below the province wide average of 46%.

Official district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957. The Social Credit government in power at the time did not considered the results binding. However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new &quot;Liquor Act&quot;.

Municipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the Plebiscite were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.

==Student vote results==

===2004===

On November 19, 2004 a student vote was conducted at participating Alberta schools to parallel the 2004 Alberta general election results. The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located.

<doc id="1051820" wikidata="Q464584" url="?curid=1051820" title="She's All That">
<text>She&#x27;s All That is a 1999 American teen romantic comedy film directed by Robert Iscove. It stars Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook, Matthew Lillard, Paul Walker, Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe, Kieran Culkin and Anna Paquin. After being dumped by his girlfriend, Zack Siler boasts he could make any girl at his high school popular. It is a modern adaptation of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; and George Cukor&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances of the lead actors, but were critical of the script. It was one of the most popular teen films of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release. It went on to earn $103 million worldwide. After featuring in the film, the song &quot;Kiss Me&quot; reached No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 weeks. A gender-swapped remake, titled &quot;He&#x27;s All That&quot;, was released on August 27, 2021, by Netflix.

== Plot ==

Zack Siler is the big man on campus at his Southern California high school. After returning from spring break, he finds out his girlfriend, Taylor, has cheated on him with a reality TV star, Brock. After Zack and Taylor&#x27;s breakup, he consoles himself by claiming that she is replaceable with any girl in the school. Zack&#x27;s friend Dean disagrees and bets Zack to turn any random girl from school into the prom queen in six weeks. He accepts, so Dean chooses Laney Boggs, an awkward and unpopular art student.

Zack attempts to befriend Laney, but she pointedly ignores his advances until he asks for her help with art. She reluctantly invites him to a small theater lounge where she will perform. Intending to deter him, Laney volunteers Zack to perform onstage. He manages to improvise a routine with his hacky sack. Laney is impressed but still rejects him when Zack attempts to charm her again.

When Zack shows up at her house, Laney reluctantly agrees to go to the beach with him and his friends, and they invite her to a party later. Laney says she&#x27;s busy, but Zack persuades her to go. He enlists his sister, Mack, to give her a makeover. At the party, Taylor, who is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, publicly humiliates her, bringing her to tears.

Laney is surprised to be nominated for prom queen, along with Taylor. Zack then goes by her house and asks about her mother, who died when Laney was young, and talks about his father, who is pressuring him to go to Dartmouth for college. Zack leans in to kiss Laney but pulls back when she jokes that it is just to get her vote for prom king.

The next day, Zack defends Laney&#x27;s brother, Simon, from bullies in the cafeteria. After a falling out with Zack, Dean asks Laney to be his prom date. Taylor is humiliated when Brock dumps her, so she cozies up to Zack. When he turns her down, she tells him that Dean has already asked Laney to the prom. When Zack confronts him, Dean reveals the bet, forcing a public confession from Zack. A furious Laney rushes from the room, refusing to speak to Zack.

Unable to reconcile with Laney, Zack takes his sister to the prom. After some persuading from her father, a disheartened Laney agrees to go with Dean. At the dance, Dean boasts of his plan to seduce Laney. Laney&#x27;s friend Jesse overhears, and he and Mack rush to warn Zack, who has taken the stage with Taylor as Prom King and Queen. Zack rushes after Laney, who has already left with Dean.

Laney returns home to find Zack is there. She explains how she avoided Dean&#x27;s advances with a fog horn. Zack confesses his true feelings, and they share a dance and kiss by the pool. Laney asks Zack about the bet, and he says mysteriously he will honor the terms. On the day of graduation he appears onstage nude except for cap and a soccer ball, getting applause from the crowd and a smile from Laney.

== Cast ==
== Production ==

=== Casting ===

The film had an ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including Kieran Culkin, Oscar winner Anna Paquin, Jodi Lyn O&#x27;Keefe, musician Usher Raymond, Gabrielle Union in her film debut, Dulé Hill, and Lil&#x27; Kim. Producer Richard N. Gladstein noted, &quot;There were other films that you could&#x27;ve seen them in, but they weren&#x27;t usually the leads in those films.&quot; According to director Robert Iscove, Miramax co-head Harvey Weinstein was very involved in script development and casting, and was able to get great actors in very small parts as a personal favor.

Iscove said Josh Hartnett was considered for the role of Zack Siler, and many actresses were considered for the role of Laney Boggs, including Mena Suvari, Leelee Sobieski, and Jordana Brewster.

Kevin Pollak said he signed up for the movie in part because he was impressed with Freddie Prinze Jr.’s performance in &quot;The House of Yes&quot; a few years earlier and was interested in working with him.

=== Writing ===

R. Lee Fleming Jr. is officially credited as the sole screenwriter for the film. In a 2002 interview, M. Night Shyamalan stated that he polished the screenplay while adapting &quot;Stuart Little&quot; and writing a spec script for &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;. This was also confirmed in the film&#x27;s audio commentary by Iscove.

In 2013, Shyamalan claimed that, rather than simply polishing Fleming&#x27;s original script, he actually ghost-wrote the film. This was disputed by Fleming. Jack Lechner (who served as Miramax&#x27;s head of development in the late 1990s) confirmed that technically both Shyamalan and Fleming contributed to the script: Fleming wrote the initial script that Miramax bought, while Shyamalan did an uncredited rewrite (doing more than &quot;a polish&quot;) that got the film green-lit. Lechner reiterated that content from both writers was included in the final cut of the film. Producer Richard N. Gladstein said that the script &quot;was pretty much done&quot; already, but that Shyamalan&#x27;s changes &quot;helped enormously with the relationship with Kevin Pollak [who played Laney&#x27;s father, Wayne]&quot;. Iscove attributed the performance art piece and the hacky sack sequence to Shyamalan. Fleming attributed the line &quot;Am I a fucking bet?&quot; to Shyamalan. Fleming included various pop culture references in his script: Laney Boggs was named after two characters played by Winona Ryder, Kim Boggs from &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; and Laney Pierce from &quot;Reality Bites&quot;; the characters Zack and Taylor were named after two of the three members of the band Hanson. Pollak constantly guessing &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; answers incorrectly is a running joke, which he previously did in the 1997 film &quot;Truth or Consequences, N.M.&quot;. The idea was in Fleming&#x27;s script but Pollak expanded and improvised his answers.

Iscove was influenced by the movies of John Hughes and was trying do something different for the &#x27;90s generation that would still resonate. He stressed the importance of the story having a heart, how Zack had to be worthy of Laney, and how Laney had to learn to be more open. The story was rewritten to better fit Prinze Jr. and make Zack a more sympathetic character with his own challenges. Iscove was well aware that it was implausible to suggest Rachael Leigh Cook was ugly, but said it was standard practice in Hollywood to cast &quot;the beautiful girl&quot; and that it requires the audience to suspend their disbelief: &quot;You either go along with it or you don&#x27;t go along with it.&quot; Comparing Laney&#x27;s transformation to that of Clark Kent into Superman, Iscove said casting the role was more about finding an actor who had the range to give the necessary performance.

=== Filming ===

Filming took place from August 6, 1998, to September 28, 1998, in various California locations. The high school scenes were shot at Torrance High School, where television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; were previously filmed.
Iscove was also a choreographer and wanted to expand and embellish the prom scenes, while also showing the Weinsteins how musical numbers could work in films. The dance scene was choreographed by Adam Shankman at the request of the film&#x27;s co-producer Jennifer Gibgot, who is Shankman&#x27;s sister. Shankman was assisted by Anne Fletcher. Shankman was concerned about the scene not tonally meshing with the rest of the film, but Iscove persisted. Test audiences did not understand why the dance scene was happening, so Bob Weinstein asked for a reshoot with Usher to link the scene. Shankman also worked with Matthew Lillard on his solo dance scenes.
Costume designer Denise Wingate said, &quot;We had no budget so we had to be really creative—everything in that prom scene was white, black, and gold, and we got it all from The Salvation Army and just completely reworked it.&quot; Having majored in psychology, Wingate tried to explore the possible reasons for the characters’ wardrobe. Wingate concluded that Laney wore clothes like armor after the death of her mother, but also wanted to express herself as an artist, resulting in a mix of vintage clothes, overalls, aprons, and various quirky t-shirts. The falafel restaurant hat was created on short notice with items picked up from a Michaels craft store. Laney&#x27;s transformation was reflected in the red dress, which demonstrated &quot;a bold statement of her dressing in a color that was so different than anything we’d seen her in before.&quot; Leigh Cook recalled &quot;feeling really self-conscious” in the scene where she first descends the stairs in the dress. There were two versions of the red dress: a stunt double dress reserved for the scene when Laney falls down in a driveway outside a party, and a second smaller dress, which left Cook holding her breath trying to get through the scene quickly.

== Soundtrack ==
The song &quot;Kiss Me&quot; was used as the main theme song. The film&#x27;s box office success helped &quot;Kiss Me&quot; to gain widespread mainstream attention and chart success. It climbed to No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 list, and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 straight weeks and No. 4 in the UK and New Zealand.

The film was released in Italy with the title &quot;Kiss Me&quot;.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 41% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;Despite its charming young leads, &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; can&#x27;t overcome its predictable, inconsistently funny script.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

It was the last movie to be reviewed by Gene Siskel before his death in February 1999. Siskel gave a positive review and wrote, &quot;Rachael Leigh Cook, as Laney, the plain Jane object of the makeover, is forced to demonstrate the biggest emotional range as a character, and she is equal to the assignment.&quot; Roger Ebert suggested: &quot;To give the movie credit, it&#x27;s as bored with the underlying plot as we are. Even the prom queen election is only a backdrop for more interesting material, as &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; explores differences in class and style, and peppers its screenplay with very funny little moments.&quot; Ebert says it &quot;is not a great movie, but it has its moments&quot;, giving it 2.5 out of 4 stars. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Cook for her performance, comparing her to Winona Ryder, saying, &quot;Unlike so many actors playing smart young people, she actually projects some intelligence along with a sly sense of comedy.&quot;

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; calls it &quot;About one idea short of being an excellent teenage romance. As it stands it&#x27;s a pleasing but routine effort.&quot; LaSalle criticized the film for running out of plot about halfway, saying the &quot;story line is stretched to the breaking point. In one instance, director Robert Iscove stops the action for a long dance sequence, set at the prom, that has nothing to do with anything.&quot; He commented the film is &quot;intermittently funny&quot; and praised Matthew Lillard&#x27;s performance, calling it the best thing in the picture.

Geoff Berkshire of &quot;Variety&quot; was critical of the lack of originality, and wrote, &quot;Suggesting that Miramax needs to put Kevin Williamson on permanent retainer if it&#x27;s going to remain in the teen-pics field, &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; notably fails to bring to comedy the insight that the Williamson-penned &quot;Scream&quot; brought so memorably to horror&quot;. Berkshire was positive about the two leads, saying &quot;appealing young actors come off as competent, nothing more, given a context that can&#x27;t be transcended.&quot; He described the direction as &quot;nothing to be ashamed of here, but nothing of any distinction, either&quot;, and noted the soundtrack as a not unexpected plus.
Jane Ganahl of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote, &quot;And once, just once, I&#x27;d love to see a teen flick that doesn&#x27;t send out a message to young girls that to be acceptable, you have to conform. I liked the artist girl much better before.&quot;

William Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; criticized the film, saying that despite a few scenes, &quot;The rest is just breezy propaganda for American high school fascism&quot;, and &quot;The most worrying thing about &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; is its message. The &#x27;ugly duckling&#x27; (specs, dungarees, art-lover) must conform (she gets a makeover and the boys notice her &quot;bobos&quot; for the first time) to fit in.&quot;

=== Box office ===
&quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; premiered on January 19, 1999 at the Mann Festival Theater in Westwood, Los Angeles. The film went into general release on January 29.

The film was released in Italy with the title &quot;Kiss Me&quot;.

The film reached No. 1 at the box office in the first week of its release, grossing $16.1 million over the Super Bowl opening weekend. It earned $63.4 million in the United States and $39.8 million at international box offices, totaling $103.2 million worldwide against a production budget between $7–10 million. Miramax spent a further $18 million on television advertising to promote the film.

=== Accolades ===
The film won eight awards, and was nominated for five others.

==Remake==

In September 2020, a gender-swapped remake of the film was announced, titled &quot;He&#x27;s All That&quot;, with Mark Waters to direct, original screenwriter R. Lee Fleming Jr. to write, and starring Addison Rae and Tanner Buchanan. That October, Myra Molloy, Madison Pettis, Peyton Meyer, Isabella Crovetti, and Annie Jacob were cast.

In December 2020, Rachael Leigh Cook joined the cast to portray Rae&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother. It has been confirmed that Cook&#x27;s character is unrelated to her original character. &quot;He&#x27;s All That&quot; was released on August 27, 2021, by Netflix.

<doc id="1051822" wikidata="Q1620408" url="?curid=1051822" title="Battle of Chesma">
<text>The naval Battle of Cheshme (also the Battle of Chesma or Chesme) took place on 5–7 July 1770 during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774) near and in Çeşme (Cheshme, Chesma, or Chesme) Bay, in the area between the western tip of Anatolia and the island of Chios, which was the site of a number of past naval battles between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. It was a part of the Orlov Revolt of 1770, a precursor to the later Greek War of Independence (1821–1829), and the first of a number of disastrous fleet battles for the Ottomans against Russia. Today it is commemorated as a Day of Military Honour in Russia.

==Prelude==
The Russo-Turkish War had begun in 1768, and Russia sent several squadrons from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea to draw Ottoman attention away from their Black Sea fleet, then only six ships of the line strong. Two Russian squadrons, commanded by Admiral Grigory Spiridov and Rear Admiral John Elphinstone, a British captain who had risen to the rank of rear admiral in Russia, combined under the overall command of General-in-Chief Count Alexei Orlov, supreme commander of the Russian Fleet, and went to look for the Ottoman fleet. Orlov&#x27;s naval adviser was Captain-Commander Greig.

On 5 July 1770, they came across it, anchored in line just north of Çeşme Bay, western Anatolia. The Ottoman fleet contained about 14 ships of the line, perhaps 6 frigates, 6 xebecs, 13 galleys and 32 small craft, with about 1,300 guns in total. About 10 of the ships of the line, of 70–100 guns, were in the Ottoman main line with a further 6 or so in the second, arranged so that they could fire through the gaps in the first line. Behind that were the frigates, xebecs, etc. The fleet was commanded by Kapudan Pasha Mandalzade Hüsameddin, in the fourth ship from the front (north end) of the line, with Hasan Pasha in the first ship, &quot;Real Mustafa&quot;, and Cafer Bey in the seventh. Two further ships of the line, probably small, had left this fleet for Mytilene the previous evening.

After settling on a plan of attack, the Russian battle line (see Table 1) sailed towards the south end of the Ottoman line and then turned north, coming alongside the Ottomans, with the tail end coming into action last (Elphinstone had wanted to approach the northern end first, then follow the wind along the Ottoman line, attacking their ships one by one – the method used by Nelson at the Battle of the Nile in 1798).

==Battle==
The Ottomans opened fire at about 11:45 a.m., followed by the Russians slightly later. Three of the Russian ships of the line had trouble staying in position; &quot;Evropa&quot; turned around and came back behind &quot;Rostislav&quot;, &quot;Tri Svyatitelya&quot; circled the second Ottoman vessel before coming back into the Russian line, being attacked in error by &quot;Tri Ierarcha&quot; as she did so, and &quot;Sviatoi Ianuarii&quot; turned around before coming back into the line.

Based on the plan proposed by G. A. Spiridov, the Russian fleet attacked the Ottoman van from a short distance (50–70 metres). Spiridov, in &quot;Sviatoi Evstafii&quot;, had a close-range battle with Hasan Pasha in &quot;Real Mustafa&quot;, before the latter was suddenly seen to be on fire. Her mainmast came down and landed on &quot;Sviatoi Evstafii&quot; deck, causing the Russian ship to blow up immediately. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Real Mustafa&quot; blew up as well — after a 2-hour battle.

According to Elphinstone, who claimed the Russians were almost useless, Spiridov and Count Feodor Orlov (brother of the commander), had left &quot;Sviatoi Evstafii&quot; before the fighting became close-range. Spiridov ended up on &quot;Tri Svyatitelya&quot;. &quot;Sviatoi Evstafii&quot;&#x27;s captain, Kruse, survived too. At about 2:00 p.m. the fighting ended, as the Ottomans cut their cables and moved south into the bay, forming themselves into a defensive line of eight ships of the line, a second line, and the rest beyond.

On 6 July, the Russians bombarded the Ottoman ships and land positions. At about 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 7 July, Orlov, acting on Spiridov&#x27;s plan, sent Samuel Greig (who transferred to &quot;Rostislav&quot;) to attack with &quot;Evropa&quot;, &quot;Rostislav&quot; and &quot;Ne Tron Menya&quot; forming a south–north line facing the Ottomans, and with &quot;Saratov&quot; in reserve, &quot;Nadezhda&quot; attacking the batteries at the eastern side of the bay entrance, &quot;Afrika&quot; attacking the batteries on the western side, and &quot;Grom&quot; near &quot;Afrika&quot;. At about 1:30 a.m. or earlier (times were about 90 minutes earlier, according to Elphinstone), fire from &quot;Grom&quot; and/or &quot;Ne tron menya&quot; caused an Ottoman ship of the line to blow up after her main topsail caught fire, and the fire quickly spread to other ships of the line. By 2:00 a.m., two Ottoman ships of the line had blown up and more were on fire, and Greig sent in three fireships (the fourth, seeing the danger, stayed out), which contributed in a small way to the burning of almost the entire Ottoman fleet: fireship commanded by Lieutenant set fire to another ship of the line and consequently the fire continued to spread among various vessels. At about 4:00 a.m., boats were sent in to save two ships of the line which were not burning, but one of these caught fire while it was being towed. The other, &quot;Semend-i Bahri&quot; 60, survived and was captured along with five galleys. Fighting ended at about 8:00 a.m. Russian casualties on 5 July were 14 killed, plus 636 killed in &quot;Sviatoi Evstafii&quot;, and about 30 wounded, and on 7 July 11 killed. Ottoman casualties were much higher. Hüsameddin, Hasan Pasha and Cafer Bey survived. Hüsameddin was removed from his position, which was given to Cafer Bey. This was the only significant fleet battle during the Russo-Turkish War.


==Significance==
The Battle of Cheshme was fought on the same day as the land Battle of Larga. It was the greatest naval defeat suffered by Ottomans since the Battle of Lepanto (1571). This battle inspired great confidence in the Russian fleet and allowed the Russians to control the Aegean Sea for some time. The defeat of the Ottoman fleet also sped up rebellions by minority groups in the Ottoman Empire, especially the Orthodox Christian nations in the Balkan peninsula, who helped the Russian army in defeating the Ottoman Empire.

After this naval victory, the Russian fleet stayed in the Aegean for the following five years. It returned to Çeşme twice more during this time to bombard it. Historians still debate the rationale for the Russian military focus on this small fort town while there were many other more strategic targets along the Aegean coast.

Due to the Ottoman defeat, fanatical Muslim groups proceeded to massacre c. 1,500 local Greeks in nearby Smyrna.

Catherine the Great commissioned four monuments to commemorate the victory: Chesma Palace and Church of Saint John at Chesme Palace in St Petersburg (1774–77), Chesma Obelisk in Gatchina (1775), and Chesma Column in Tsarskoe Selo (1778).

<doc id="1051830" wikidata="Q2745507" url="?curid=1051830" title="As-Sa'iqa">
<text>As-Sa&#x27;iqa (), officially known as Vanguard for the Popular Liberation War – Lightning Forces, () is a Palestinian Ba&#x27;athist political and military faction created by Syria. It is linked to the Palestinian branch of the Syrian-led Ba&#x27;ath Party, and is a member of the broader Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), although it is no longer active in the organization. Its Secretary-General is Dr. Mohammed Qeis.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
As-Sa&#x27;iqa was formed in September 1966 by the Syrian Ba&#x27;ath Party. It became active in December 1968, as a member of the PLO. Syria tried to build up an alternative to Yasser Arafat, who was then emerging with his Fatah faction as the primary Palestinian fedayeen leader and politician. As-Sa&#x27;iqa was initially the second-largest group within the PLO, after Fatah.

=== Al-Assad takeover and Purge of As-Sa&#x27;iqa ===
As-Sa&#x27;iqa was also used in the Ba&#x27;thist power struggle then in play in Syria, by Salah Jadid to counter the ambitions of Defence Minister Hafez al-Assad. When al-Assad seized power in the November 1970 &quot;Corrective Revolution&quot;, as-Sa&#x27;iqa was purged and its leaders replaced with al-Assad loyalists (although Jadid loyalists held on to the as-Sai&#x27;qa branch active in the Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan until mid-1971, when they were arrested). As new Secretary-General (after Mahmud al-Ma&#x27;ayta, who had succeeded Yusuf Zuayyin), al-Assad chose Zuheir Mohsen, a Palestinian Ba&#x27;thist who had come to Syria as a refugee from Jordan. He was repeatedly promoted by Syria as a candidate for the post of PLO chairman, to replace Arafat, but never gained support from other factions.

=== With and against the PLO in Lebanon ===
As-Sa&#x27;iqa was used by Syria as a proxy force in the Palestinian movement. While this has prevented as-Sa&#x27;iqa from gaining widespread popularity among Palestinians, it became an important force in the Palestinian camps in Syria, as well as in Lebanon. During the Lebanese Civil War, Syria built the movement into one of the most important Palestinian fighting units, but also forced it to join in Syrian offensives against the PLO when relations between al-Assad and Arafat soured. This led to as-Sa&#x27;iqa&#x27;s expulsion from the PLO in 1976, but it was readmitted in December the same year, after the situation had cooled down, and after Syria named this as a condition for further support for the PLO. The attacks on the PLO led to large-scale defections of Syrian-based Palestinians from the movement. As-Saiqa was also responsible for the Damour massacre in 1976 and many other mass murders.

After Muhsin&#x27;s assassination in 1979, Isam al-Qadi became the new Secretary-General. The movement remained active during the Lebanese Civil War, and again joined Syria, the Lebanese Shi&#x27;a Amal Movement and Abu Musa&#x27;s Fatah al-Intifada in attacks on the PLO during the War of the Camps in 1984–85, and for the remainder of the Civil War (which lasted until 1990). This again led to mass-defections of Palestinians from the movement (Harris quotes the Syrian-aligned Amal Movement as complaining that the Syrian-backed Palestinian forces sent to attack the PLO were &quot;Abu Musa in the Biqa&#x27;&quot; but &quot;become Abu nothing in the Shuf and Abu Ammar on arrival in Beirut&quot;), and reportedly its ranks were filled with non-Palestinian Syrian army recruits. After the end of the Civil War, the movement was nearly out of contact with the PLO mainstream, and exerted influence only in Syria and in Syrian-occupied parts of Lebanon. It kept lobbying within the PLO against the various peace proposals advanced by Arafat, and was part of the Syrian-based National Alliance that opposed Arafat.

=== As-Sai&#x27;qa today ===
After the end of the Lebanese Civil War and the 1993 signing of the Oslo Peace Agreement, as-Sai&#x27;qa has largely lost its usefulness to the Syrian government, and the state and size of the organization deteriorated. Today, it is wholly insignificant outside Syria, although it retains a presence in Lebanon (its future is uncertain after the end in 2005 of the Syrian Army&#x27;s presence in Lebanon). It is extremely weak in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, non-existent in the Golan Heights, East Jerusalem and Israel within the Green Line, and has not been active during the al-Aqsa Intifada. Its importance to Syria has lessened, both because the PLO has diminished in importance compared to the Palestinian National Authority. As-Sai&#x27;qa boycotts PNA bodies, and its representative on the PLO Executive Committee also boycotts its sessions.

Following the outbreak of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, as-Sa&#x27;iqa took up arms in support of the Syrian Ba&#x27;athist government, participating in numerous military operations such as the Southern Damascus offensive (April–May 2018), and the 2018 Southern Syria offensive. Having greatly diminished in numbers, the organization&#x27;s forces had suffered just 30 fighters killed in action by April 2018. By August 2018, As-Sa&#x27;iqa began to lay off a substantial number of its fighters, mostly because they were no longer needed and because of lack of funds.

After the fall of the Assad regime in late 2024, the Syrian transitional government demanded that all Palestinian armed groups in Syria disarm themselves, dissolve their military formations, and instead focus on political and charitable work. Representatives of the new government also raided the offices of as-Sa&#x27;iqa, PFLP-GC, and Fatah al-Intifada, confiscating documents, equipment, and weapons. The new Syrian government ultimately allowed as-Sa&#x27;iqa to continue its political activities, with the party reshuffling its leadership &quot;to strengthen the faction&#x27;s Palestinian role&quot;. On 8 February 2025, as-Sa&#x27;iqa reopened its offices in the Al-A&#x27;edeen Camp in Hama, prompting protests by locals who demanded that the party be held responsible for violations during the civil war.

== Organization and structure ==
Since 2007, Farhan Abu Hayja has been Secretary-General of as-Sa&#x27;iqa. Muhammad al-Khalifa is its representative on the PLO Executive Committee, but boycotts sessions of the PLO EC. During much of the 1970s, as-Sai&#x27;qa&#x27;s representatives in the PLO EC (Muhsin and al-Qadi) held the prestigious and sensitive post of Head of the Military Department, which reflected the military importance of the movement in those years.

Syrian backing in the 1970s gave as-Sa&#x27;iqa a military weight far greater than its political influence, which has always been small. During the Lebanese Civil War, it was often the second largest Palestinian faction in fighting strength, after Yassir Arafat&#x27;s Fatah movement.

Under the name Eagles of the Palestinian Revolution - possibly the name of the armed wing of as-Sa&#x27;iqa - the organization committed a number of international terrorist attacks. Among these was the 1979 takeover of the Egyptian embassy in Ankara, Turkey (although attributed to Fatah) and a kidnapping of Jews emigrating by train through Austria from the Soviet Union to Israel. Since the early 1990s, the organization has not committed any known attacks, and it is not listed on the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.

== Ideological profile ==
As-Sa&#x27;iqa&#x27;s political agenda is identical to that of Ba&#x27;athist Syria, i.e., Arab socialist, nationalist and strongly committed to Pan-Arab doctrine. While this reflects its Ba&#x27;thist programme, it has also used Pan-Arabism as a means of supporting the primacy of its sponsor, Syria, over the Arafat-led PLO&#x27;s claim to exclusive representation of the Palestinian people. Thus, it rejected &quot;Palestinization&quot; of the conflict with Israel, insisting on the necessary involvement of the greater Arab nation. This occasionally went to extremes, with as-Sa&#x27;iqa leaders denying the existence of a separate Palestinian people within the wider Arab nation.

The group has generally taken a hard line stance (reflecting that of Syria) on issues such as the recognition of Israel, the Oslo Accords, and other questions of Palestinian goals and political orientation. It was a member of the 1974 Rejectionist Front, despite supporting the Ten Point Programme that initially caused the PLO/Rejectionist Front split.

<text>Sir Pita Russell Sharples (born Peter Russell Sharples, 20 July 1941) is a New Zealand Māori academic and politician, who was a co-leader of the Māori Party from 2004 to 2013, and a minister outside Cabinet in the National Party-led government from 2008 to 2014. He was the member of Parliament for the Tāmaki Makaurau electorate in Auckland from 2005 to 2014. He stepped down as co-leader of the Māori Party in July 2013.

==Early life and education==
Sharples was born in Waipawa, a town in Hawke&#x27;s Bay. His mother Ruiha was of Ngāti Kahungunu, and his father Paul was a shearer and a second generation New Zealander whose family came from Bolton, United Kingdom.

He received his early education at Waipukurau District High School, but then became a boarder at Te Aute College. His four years there culminated in his becoming head boy, and he credits this time as a turning point of his life. He then attended the University of Auckland, studying education. After graduating, he remained at the university as an instructor, working at the Faculty of Education. He subsequently gained an MA (1st class) in anthropology, and later a PhD in anthropology and linguistics – both also from the University of Auckland.

== Early career ==
Sharples strongly opposed the construction of Auckland Thermal No. 1, a gas-fired power plant proposed for Te Atatū Peninsula. In 1973, the Third Labour Government of New Zealand abandoned plans for the plant after widespread opposition. During this period, Sharples was inspired to become more politically active, and soon after the scheme was abandoned he wrote a letter to Prime Minister Norman Kirk, explaining his reasons for opposing the plant.

In 1984 Sharples led the kapa haka at the pōwhiri (opening ceremony) of the &quot;Te Maori&quot; exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

==Member of Parliament==

In addition to his academic work, Sharples has long advocated a separate Māori political party. After the foreshore and seabed controversy in 2003–2004, Sharples joined forces with Tariana Turia a former minister in the Labour Party government who resigned over the issue. Turia and Sharples organised a new party based around Turia&#x27;s Te Tai Hauāuru seat which was launched on 7 July 2004 as the Māori Party with Sharples as co-leader.

In the 2005 general election Sharples contested and won the urban Auckland seat of Tamaki Makaurau displacing former Labour MP John Tamihere.

==Minister of Māori Affairs==

In the 2008 general election Sharples was re-elected with a majority of more than 7000. The National Party won more seats overall and formed a minority government with support from the Māori Party, ACT New Zealand and United Future. Sharples was appointed as Minister of Māori Affairs, although like other support party members he remained outside Cabinet.
Sharples was returned to parliament in the 2011 general election, and retained the Māori Affairs portfolio. He resigned as co-leader of the Māori Party in July 2013, and retired from Parliament at the .

==Honours and awards==
Sharples was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the Māori people, in the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. In the 2015 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a Member of Parliament and to Māori.

His other awards include:
*National Male Leader, Te Matatini, for five separate years.
*Tohunga Tū Taua, Te Whare Tū Taua o Aotearoa, 1985.
*Kaitātaki Tane Award, National Male Leader, Te Matatini, 2000.
*Tohunga Huarewa, Te Wānanga Whare Tapere o Takitimu, Massey University, 2001.
*Icon Award Whakamana Hiranga, The Arts Foundation, 2024.

<text>Mary Elsa Musselman Whitmer (August 27, 1778 – January 1856) was a Book of Mormon witness and the wife of Peter Whitmer Sr.

==Biography==
She was born Mary Elsa Musselman in Germany to Jacob and Elizabeth Musselman. She immigrated to Pennsylvania in the late-18th century, where she met and married Peter Whitmer, a farmer, also of German descent. They moved to Waterloo, New York, in 1809, and later purchased a farm in Fayette, New York. They had eight children, Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, John Whitmer, David Whitmer, Catherine Whitmer Page, Peter Whitmer Jr., Nancy Whitmer, and Elizabeth Whitmer Cowdery.

Through her son David, she and her family became acquainted with Joseph Smith around 1828. In 1829, she was caring for three boarders (Smith, Emma Hale Smith, and Oliver Cowdery) in addition to her large household while the Book of Mormon was being translated. She said that she was often overloaded with work to the extent she felt it quite a burden. During this time, the male boarders and members of her household were speaking of being shown the golden plates. One evening, when she went to milk the cows, she said that a stranger with a knapsack spoke to her, explained what was going on in her house, comforted her, then produced a bundle of plates from his knapsack, turned the leaves for her, showed her the engravings, exhorted her to faith in bearing her burden a little longer, then suddenly vanished with the plates. Whitmer always called the stranger &quot;Brother Nephi&quot;.

Whitmer was baptized a member of the Church of Christ by Oliver Cowdery in Seneca Lake, April 18, 1830.

She was excommunicated from the church with the entire Whitmer family in 1838, largely due to their dismay at the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society, as well as personal criticism from Joseph Smith. The family moved to Richmond, Missouri, the same year, and she died there in January 1856, at the age of 77.

<text>Brendan Michael Perry (born 30 June 1959) is a British singer and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work as half of the duo Dead Can Dance with Lisa Gerrard.

==Early life==
Perry was born in Whitechapel, London, England, UK, in 1959 to a mother from Cavan, Ireland, and a father from London. He was raised and schooled in the East End of London until his family moved to Auckland, New Zealand, in 1973. Having received no formal musical education, Perry began to play the guitar at St Paul&#x27;s College, the Catholic school he attended in Ponsonby. After failing to become a primary school teacher and join the civil service, Perry worked at a series of jobs until joining the Scavengers in 1977. At first Perry played bass guitar, later taking on the duties of lead vocalist when the original singer left the band. Apart from a handful of original songs, the band covered music from the Stooges, New York Dolls, and late-1960s psychedelia. After two years, having failed to secure a recording deal or live dates, the band moved to Melbourne, Australia, in November 1978 and changed its name to Marching Girls. In 1980, Perry left the Marching Girls to pursue a solo career, experimenting with tape loops, synthesis, and alternative forms of rhythm. In 1981, Perry formed Dead Can Dance with Simon Monroe and Paul Erikson (both of whom were to leave soon after they had relocated to London), and Lisa Gerrard.

==Career==
===The Scavengers and Marching Girls===
Though now primarily known for his work with Dead Can Dance, Perry&#x27;s first musical forays were in a markedly different style. In 1977, Perry was a leading member of the New Zealand punk rock band the Scavengers, working under the pseudonym of Ronnie Recent. Perry started as the band&#x27;s bass player, becoming lead vocalist after a lineup change in 1978. In 1979, the band moved to Melbourne and changed its name to the Marching Girls. Perry left the band in 1980. Perry&#x27;s work with these two bands can be found on the 1979 compilation album &quot;AK79&quot; that was re-released on CD in 1994 and on vinyl in 2020. The Scavengers released two collections of their tracks in New Zealand, in 2003 and 2014. The Scavengers are regarded as New Zealand&#x27;s equivalent of the Buzzcocks, with the Perry co-penned song &quot;Mysterex&quot; regarded as one of the country&#x27;s best and most distinctive punk-rock recordings. Marching Girls also reached the New Zealand singles charts in 1980 with &quot;True Love.&quot;

===Dead Can Dance===

Dead Can Dance were originally formed as a quartet in 1981 in Melbourne, with Perry, drummer Simon Monroe, bass player Paul Erikson, and, last to join the band, Lisa Gerrard. In 1982, Dead Can Dance moved to London leaving Simon Monroe in Australia. Peter Ulrich played drums in the band&#x27;s first demos, concerts and recordings. Paul Erikson soon left the band to fly back to Australia, leaving the band a duo. The band went on to record eight albums on the 4AD Records record label beginning with the self-titled &quot;Dead Can Dance&quot; album, which was released in February 1984.

===Solo career===
In 1999, Perry released his solo album &quot;Eye of the Hunter&quot; on 4AD Records. The album contained songs written by Perry and a cover of Tim Buckley&#x27;s song &quot;I Must Have Been Blind.&quot; Perry would eventually cover more Tim Buckley songs: &quot;Happy Time&quot;, &quot;Chase the Blues Away&quot;, &quot;Dream Letter&quot; and &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;.
Around 2001, Perry made the music for a 10-minute film (&quot;Mushin&quot;) made by Graham Wood, who designed the artwork of the box set &quot;Dead Can Dance (1981-1998)&quot; and the album &quot;Wake&quot;.

Perry announced his departure from 4AD in September 2008, and promised a new album titled &quot;Ark&quot; in early 2009. According to a reply Perry made to a comment on his Myspace blog, the new album would be very different from &quot;Eye of the Hunter&quot;, notably because it would feature rhythm machines and electric guitars. &quot;Utopia&quot;, a demo version of a song from the album, was made available on his Myspace blog. &quot;Ark&quot; was eventually released on 7 June 2010.

In March 2016 it was announced that he would collaborate with French musician Olivier Mellano and the Breton traditional band Bagad Cesson on a project titled &quot;No Land&quot;.

<doc id="1051841" wikidata="Q137679" url="?curid=1051841" title="Gertrude Atherton">
<text>Gertrude Franklin Horn Atherton (October 30, 1857 – June 14, 1948) was an American writer. Many of her novels are set in her home state of California. Her bestselling novel &quot;Black Oxen&quot; (1923) was made into a silent movie of the same name. In addition to novels, she wrote short stories, essays, and articles for magazines and newspapers on such issues as feminism, politics, and war.

==Early life==
Gertrude Franklin Horn was born on October 30, 1857, in San Francisco, California, to Thomas Ludovich Horn and his wife, the former Gertrude Franklin. Her father had become a prominent citizen in San Francisco as a tobacco merchant, although he originally hailed from Stonington, Connecticut. Her mother was from New Orleans. Her parents separated in 1860 when she was two years old, and she was raised by her maternal grandfather, Stephen Franklin, a devout Presbyterian and a relative of Benjamin Franklin. Grandfather Franklin insisted she be well read, and this influenced her greatly. She attended St. Mary&#x27;s Hall high school in Benicia, California, and, briefly, the Sayre School in Lexington, Kentucky.

Gertrude moved back to California to live with her grandfather and mother after her aunt refused to house her any longer because of her rebelliousness. There she met George H.B. Atherton, son of Faxon Atherton, who was courting her mother. He became more interested in daughter Gertrude, and after she accepted his sixth proposal, they eloped on February 15, 1876. She went to live with him and his domineering Chilean mother. Gertrude found life in the Atherton mansion in San Francisco and on their Fair Oaks estate, now Atherton, California, stultifying. As a result of her disappointment with the marriage she began to develop an independent life. Two tragedies changed her life dramatically: Her son George died of diphtheria, and her husband died at sea. She was left alone with their daughter Muriel and needed to support herself. Her mother in law agreed to raise Muriel and give her the inheritance that would have gone to George.

Atherton later told an interviewer that the books that had influenced her the most were Hippolyte Taine&#x27;s &quot;History of English Literature&quot; and the books of Herbert Spencer.

==Career==
===Nineteenth century===

Atherton&#x27;s first publication was &quot;The Randolphs of Redwood: A Romance&quot;, serialized in &quot;The Argonaut&quot; in March 1882 under the pseudonym Asmodeus. When she revealed to her family that she was the author, she was ostracized. In 1888, she left for New York, leaving Muriel with her grandmother. She traveled to London, and eventually returned to California. Atherton&#x27;s first novel, &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;, was published in 1888 under the pseudonym Frank Lin.

In 1889, Atherton went to Paris at the invitation of her sister-in-law Alejandra Rathbone (married to Major Jared Lawrence Rathbone). That year, she heard from British publisher G. Routledge and Sons that they would publish her first two books. William Sharp wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot; praising her fiction and would later invite Atherton to stay with him and his wife, Elizabeth, in South Hampstead.

In London, Atherton had the opportunity through Jane Wilde to meet her son, Oscar Wilde. She recalled in her memoir &quot;Adventures of a Novelist&quot; (1932) that she made an excuse to avoid the meeting because she thought he was physically repulsive. In an 1899 article for &quot;London&#x27;s Bookman&quot;, Atherton wrote of Wilde&#x27;s style and associated it with &quot;the decadence, the loss of virility that must follow over-civilization.&quot;

Also in London she met a young Winston Churchill, who said that he liked her novels. Soon she found out that Churchill was disappointed that she did not return the compliment—she was not aware of his writing.

Atherton returned to California in 1890 at the death of her grandfather Franklin and her mother-in-law Dominga Atherton, and she resumed care of Muriel. In 1891, while writing a weekly column for &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot;, she met Ambrose Bierce, with whom she carried on a taunting, tumultuous friendship.

When Kate Field remarked on California writers&#x27; neglect of the picturesque and romantic old Spanish life of the state, Atherton explored the history and culture of Spanish California in Monterey, San Juan Bautista, Los Angeles, San Luis Obispo, and Santa Barbara. She became a member of the Pacific Coast Women&#x27;s Press Association.

Atherton wrote &quot;The Doomswoman&quot; in 1892, and it was published in &quot;Lippincott&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot; before being published in book form in 1893. The story (set in the 1840s) focuses on Chonita Moncada y Iturbi and her love of Diego Estenega (modeled after Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo), as he dreams of modernizing California, retaining its Mexican character without sacrificing American economic vigor. Chonita is Catholic, and her faith stands in the way of Diego&#x27;s political ambitions. The dramatic climax peaks when Diego kills Chonita&#x27;s brother, Reynaldo, and she is forced to choose between her cultural loyalty or her love for Diego. The plot of the novel closely resembles that of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The book was successful with critics, some comparing it to Helen Hunt Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Ramona&quot;. Atherton was not pleased with this comparison because Jackson was not from California. However, she was satisfied when Bierce said of &quot;The Doomswoman&quot; that it was &quot;in its class... superior to any that any Californian has done&quot;.

In 1892, Atherton left for New York. There she wrote for the &quot;New York World&quot;. She also wrote letters to Bierce, confiding her loneliness, her dismay at the necessity to do freelance writing (in particular for the &quot;New York World&quot;), and her dislike of eastern literary circles. Her distaste came from their belittlement of the Western United States and its authors and the fact they did not accept Bierce&#x27;s work. While in New York, she published another California novel, &quot;Before the Gringo Came&quot; (1894).

Atherton next wrote &quot;Patience Sparhawk and Her Times, A Novel&quot; (1897), but it proved to be too controversial for publication. Its rejection encouraged her to leave for London. In 1898, John Lane of The Bodley Head agreed to publish it, but not for two years. She continued to write, writing book reviews for Oliver Fry&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and even completed a book-length version of &quot;The Randolphs of Redwood&quot; (retitled &quot;A Daughter of the Vine&quot;, 1899) while staying in Haworth. Max Pemberton asked her to write a 10,000 word essay for a series he was editing for Cassells Pocket Library, which she wrote as &quot;A Whirl Asunder&quot; (1895).

Once &quot;Patience Sparhawk and Her Times, A Novel&quot; was published, William Robertson Nicoll gave a review of it in the April 12, 1897 edition of &quot;The Bookman&quot; that said it was &quot;crude&quot; in its portrayal of a clever young woman with burning interest in life and identified it as a protest against the tame American novel. In the May 15 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the reviewer said that Atherton had &quot;incontestable&quot; ability and a &quot;very original talent&quot; while noting that the book offered a series of &quot;fleshy&quot; episodes in Patience&#x27;s life that may scare a sensitive reader. It was banned from the San Francisco Mechanics&#x27; Institute, and the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; review said it represented Atherton&#x27;s departure from her proper literary goal of treating early California themes romantically.

In 1898, Atherton completed &quot;The Californians&quot;, her first novel set in the post-Spanish era. Critics received this much more positively than &quot;Patience&quot;, and a review in &quot;The Spectator&quot; (October 1, 1898) said it &quot;was by far more convincing and attractive in delineating California manners and morals... The novel fairly establishes her claim to be considered as one of the most vivid and entertaining interpreters of the complex characters of emancipated American womanhood.&quot; The November 8 &quot;Bookman&quot; said it was her &quot;most ambitious work,&quot; which has &quot;a feeling of surety that only the consciousness of knowing one&#x27;s ground can convey.&quot;

Atherton traveled to Rouen and wrote &quot;American Wives and English Husbands&quot; (1898), set in contemporary time. In this novel, she contrasts English and American men, American and English cultures, and comments on the relationships between men and women. She also completed &quot;The Valiant Runaways&quot; (1898), an adventure novel for boys that dealt with the Spanish Mexican attempt to civilize California. In 1899, she returned to the United States.

===Twentieth century===
Atherton&#x27;s novel &quot;Senator North&quot; (1900) was based on Maine&#x27;s senator Eugene Hale. 

In a May 1904 article, &quot;Why Is American Literature Bourgeois?&quot; in the &quot;North American Review&quot;, Atherton critiqued William Dean Howells for the &quot;littleism&quot; or &quot;thin&quot; realism of his fiction. Some say that Atherton&#x27;s novel, &quot;Julia France and Her Times&quot; (1912), has a strong feminist subtext, with the titular heroine being a woman needing to earn a living wage. However, its view of gender issues is nuanced: she mentioned &quot;the happy fate of the American woman, who &#x27;had things all her own way,&#x27; and to whom man was a slave.&quot; (p. 124). She also points out that the Pankhursts&#x27; militant brand of suffragism was strongly hated &quot;by the National Union of Woman&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, and by Society in general.&quot; (p. 298).

Atherton is best remembered for her California Series, several novels and short stories dealing with the social history of California. The series includes &quot;The Splendid, Idle Forties&quot; (1902); &quot;The Conqueror&quot; (1902), which is a fictionalized biography of Alexander Hamilton; and her sensational, semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Black Oxen&quot; (1923), about an aging woman who miraculously becomes young again after glandular therapy. The novel names the areas of a woman&#x27;s power as youth and vitality, examines the social expectations surrounding them, then prompts women to avoid these conventions. The latter was adapted into the film &quot;Black Oxen&quot; in 1923. Atherton&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Mrs. Balfame&quot; (1916) was also adapted to film, as &quot;Mrs. Balfame&quot; in 1917. Atherton&#x27;s &quot;The Immortal Marriage&quot; (1927) and &quot;The Jealous Gods&quot; (1928) are historical novels set in Ancient Greece.

Atherton wrote several stories of supernatural horror, including the ghost stories &quot;Death and the Woman&quot;, and &quot;Crowned with One Crest&quot;, as well as &quot;The Foghorn&quot;, and the often anthologised &quot;The Striding Place&quot;. &quot;The Foghorn&quot;, written in 1933, is a psychological horror story that has been compared to &quot;The Yellow Wallpaper&quot;. W. Somerset Maugham called it a powerful story in a 1943 publication of his, &quot;Great Modern Reading&quot;.

==Style and themes==
Atherton was an early feminist well acquainted with the plight of women. She knew &quot;the pain of sexual repression, knew the cost of strength required to escape it (strength some women do not have to spend), knew its scars—the scars that made her wary of emotional commitment and relegated her, despite her professional triumphs and her surpassing benefit to women, to largely an observer role in human relations. She knew the full cost of the destructive battle of the sexes, and urged that it end at last with true sexual equality.&quot; Her novels often feature strong heroines who pursue independent lives, undoubtedly a reaction to her stifling married life.

Atherton was often compared to contemporary authors such as Henry James and Edith Wharton (James himself assessed Atherton&#x27;s work and said she had reduced the typical man/woman relationship to a personality clash).

Atherton presided in her last years over the San Francisco branch of PEN. As her biographer Emily Wortis Leider notes in &quot;California&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, however, &quot;under her domination it became little more than a social club that might have been called Friends of Atherton and (Senator) Phelan&quot;. A strong advocate of social reform, and the &quot;grande dame&quot; of California literature, she yet remained a strong force in the promotion of a California cultural identity. She was a personal friend of Senator James Duval Phelan and his nephew, the philanthropist Noel Sullivan, and often was a guest at Phelan&#x27;s estate, Villa Montalvo. Among her celebrity friends was travel writer Richard Halliburton, who shared her interest in artists&#x27; rights, and whose disappearance at sea she lamented. Though she could be offensively assertive with her acerbic wit, notes Gerry Max, she crusaded with dertermination for many of the key intellectual freedom issues of her day, especially those involving women&#x27;s rights, and remained, throughout a long creative life, a true friend to writers. In his autobiographical novel, Kenneth Rexroth speaks of her kindness to him and his wife when they arrived in San Francisco in the late 1920s.

Charlotte S. McClure in a &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography&quot; essay said that Atherton &quot;redefined women&#x27;s potential and presented a psychological drama of a woman&#x27;s quest for identity and for a life purpose and happiness within and beyond her procreative function&quot;. She also said that &quot;Patience Sparhawk&quot; was Atherton&#x27;s &quot;first significant novel&quot;. In an 1898 essay in &quot;Bookman&quot;, a critic stated:&quot;the amazing and memorable Patience Sparhawk may perhaps be referred to as the first foreshadowing of the good work that [Atherton] has done since. It seems to have been also generally conceded that no matter what the subject chanced to be . . . nothing from her pen would be commonplace or dull. [But] that startling performance [in Patience Sparhawk] introduced her to a different audience, one much larger and more seriously interested than she had had before.&quot;

Carl van Vechten said of Atherton in a &quot;Nation&quot; article: &quot;Usually (not always, to be sure), the work of Mrs. Wharton seems to me to be scrupulous, clever and uninspiring, while that of Mrs. Atherton is often careless, sprawling, but inspired. Mrs. Wharton, with some difficulty, it would appear, has learned to write; Mrs. Atherton was born with a facility for telling stories.&quot;

In an essay for &quot;Bookman&quot;, Frederic Taber Cooper stated that in &quot;Senator North&quot;, the character Harriet &quot;is practically a white woman but for a scarcely perceptible blueness at the base of her fingernails, this character of Harriet is perhaps the best bit of feminine analysis that Mrs. Atherton ever did.&quot;

==Political views==
Atherton was a suffragist who did not believe in the use of militancy to further the cause. In 1917 she wrote a letter to the editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot; to express her support for suffrage while voicing her opposition to militancy.

Atherton also advocated white supremacy. Atherton&#x27;s novel &quot;Senator North&quot; describes a marriage between a &quot;passing&quot; woman of mixed white and African-American ancestry and a white man, which ends in tragedy. &quot;Senator North&quot; was intended by Atherton as a warning against interracial marriages. In a 1922 &quot;The Bookman&quot; article, &quot;The Alpine School of Fiction&quot;, Atherton praised the book &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; by Madison Grant, describing it as a &quot;remarkable work, with its warning of tremendous import to civilization&quot;. Atherton claimed that American civilization had been created by the &quot;Nordic&quot; or &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; race, and that this was now threatened by an influx of &quot;Alpine&quot; and &quot;Mediterranean&quot; immigrants, who Atherton regarded as inferior to Nordics. Atherton argued that &quot;The old Nordic-American stock is being rapidly bred out by the refuse of Europe.&quot; Atherton cited works such as &quot;Main Street&quot; by Sinclair Lewis and &quot;Three Soldiers&quot; by John Dos Passos as signs of a decline in American literature brought about by the rejection of &quot;Nordic&quot; themes. Atherton&#x27;s views on race were praised by Thomas Dixon Jr., but strongly criticized by both H. L. Mencken and Horace Kallen.

Following the Russian Revolution, Atherton developed a hostility to Communism. In 1919, Atherton wrote an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, (entitled &quot;Time as a cure for Bolshevism&quot;) which condemned both the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Americans who sympathized with it. When asked by the League of American Writers which side she supported in the Spanish Civil War, she stated that she supported the Spanish Nationalists-the only author of the 418 the League surveyed who did. In the League pamphlet &quot;Writers Take Sides&quot; (collecting the authors&#x27; responses), Atherton stated that although she disliked both fascism and communism, she considered communism the greater evil and added, &quot;Although I have no love for Franco, I hope he will mop up the Communists, and send home, with tails between legs, all those gullible Americans who enlisted to save Spanish &#x27;Democracy&#x27;&quot;. Atherton attended the Democratic National Convention in 1928. In a poll carried out by the &quot;Saturday Review of Literature&quot; asking writers which Presidential candidate they endorsed in the 1940 election, Atherton was among the writers who endorsed Wendell Willkie.

==Legacy==
Atherton&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Adventures of a Novelist&quot; (New York: Horace Liveright, 1932), is an account of her life and the people she knew, including Ambrose Bierce and James Phelan. It includes historical reminiscences of San Francisco in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

She is buried in Cypress Lawn cemetery in Colma, California. In 2009, The Library of America selected Atherton&#x27;s story &quot;The Striding Place&quot; for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American Fantastic Tales.

<text>Alsask is a special service area in the Rural Municipality of Milton No. 292, in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Alsask is located west of the town of Kindersley. Highway 44 runs to the east of Alsask, and Highway 7 lies a few kilometres to the north. The community had a population of 113 in the 2021 Canadian census (a 1.8% increase from 111 in the 2016 Canadian census).

The community&#x27;s name combines the names of &quot;Al&quot;berta and &quot;Sask&quot;atchewan, although it is a misconception that it straddles the border between the two provinces. It lies approximately east of the Alberta border and while the community lies completely within Saskatchewan, the local cemetery is actually in Alberta. Alsask&#x27;s most notable landmark is one of three remaining radar domes that for many years operated as Canadian Forces Detachment Alsask as part of the Pinetree Line, operated by the Canadian Armed Forces. Southeast of the town is Alsask Lake.

== History ==

Alsask incorporated as a village November 22, 1910; two years later on November 1, 1912, it was decided the village was large enough to incorporate into a town. By 1916 the population of Alsask had reached 300.

The Great Depression in Canada hit Alsask hard, and the village struggled with maintaining its population. The town was reverted to a village on January 1, 1947.

Things began to change; in 1959 with the establishment of Royal Canadian Air Force Station Alsask, a base was established next to the town site, and by the early 1970s the population had reached over 800, though the village never reverted to town status. The base was disbanded in 1987.

Since the closure of the RCAF Station Alsask, the village population continued to decline; by 2009, the Village of Alsask was dissolved as a political entity, and a motion was accepted to join the Rural Municipality of Milton as a &quot;special service area&quot; on July 30, 2009.

===Heritage sites===
CFD Alsask became a designated heritage site in 2002. The site is the former Royal Canadian Air Force Alsask Station, a Cold War era, military base and Pinetree Line radar dome, open to public only a handful of days per year for guided tours operated by the Canadian Civil Defense Museum.&lt;civildefencemuseum.ca&gt;Military Heritage Site - Google Maps&lt;/ref&gt; Few of the original buildings remain. Most notably, the &quot;Gopher Dip&quot; indoor swimming pool as it was known during the lifespan as a military site, is still in use. During the summer months the swimming pool is well used, attracting many children and families from surrounding communities. The site also includes a bowling alley built to entertain families of the RCAF and Alsask and area residents.

The Old Alsask School operated from its opening in 1913 until 1976 when the property was taken over by the Village of Alsask. In 2002 the building was restored as a community centre and is now listed as a Municipal Heritage Property.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Alsask had a population of 113 living in 50 of its 67 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 111. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
== Health ==
Alsask was part of the Heartland Regional Health Authority which was amalgamated with the Saskatchewan Health Authority

== Climate ==
Alsask experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;). Winters are long, cold and dry, while summers are short and warm. Precipitation is low, with an annual average of , and is heavily concentrated in the warmer months. There is a weather station located about southeast of the community, adjacent to Alsask Lake.

<doc id="1051855" wikidata="Q6517982" url="?curid=1051855" title="Legends of the Hidden Temple">
<text>Legends of the Hidden Temple is an American action-adventure television game show that broadcast from 1993 to 1995 on Nickelodeon. Created by David G. Stanley, Scott A. Stone, and Stephen Brown, the program features a fictitious temple, &quot;filled with lost treasures protected by mysterious Mayan temple guards.&quot; Kirk Fogg is the show&#x27;s host, while Dee Baker is both announcer and voice of a stone head named Olmec who &quot;knows the secrets behind each of the treasures in his temple.&quot; Six teams (Red Jaguars, Blue Barracudas, Green Monkeys, Orange Iguanas, Purple Parrots, Silver Snakes) of two children (one boy and one girl) compete to retrieve one of the historical artifacts in the temple by performing physical stunts and answering questions based on history, mythology, and geography. Contestants trying out had to compete in several physical tasks, including rope climbing and running, as well as a written test. The majority of the contestants were picked from the surrounding Orlando, Florida, area.

A revival with adult contestants aired for a single season from October 2021 to January 2022 on The CW.

==Production==
&quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; was produced by Stone Stanley Productions in association with Nickelodeon and was taped at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. In 1995, &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; won a CableACE award for Best Game Show Special or Series.

&quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; began airing on Nickelodeon on September 11, 1993. The show originally aired on weekends at 6:30 p.m. In that time slot, it increased the Nielsen rating from 1.5 to 2. Due to this success, the show began airing weekdays at 5:30 p.m. starting the week of February 14, 1994. The show was renewed for a forty-episode second season in February 1994. Auditions for new episodes took place on February 26 and 27, and production occurred from March 27 through April 17. Second-season episodes began airing June 6 of that year. A forty-episode third and final season was produced from February 17 to March 12, 1995, and began airing on July 3 of that year. The show was originally conceived under the title &quot;Secrets of the Haunted House&quot; where monsters would jump out and frighten contestants while they try to complete challenges within the haunted house.

In 1996, the &quot;Orlando Business Journal&quot; reported that Nickelodeon was considering renewing &quot;Legends&quot; for a fourth season, but according to Scott Fishman, then vice president of production services at Nickelodeon, renewal was &quot;not a sure bet&quot; because Nickelodeon was considering three new game show pilots taped in Orlando. Production for the fourth season was stopped midyear before it could be released, canceling the season.

==Gameplay==

The set design of &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; was based on the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; movies, and Marianne Arneberg of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; described the program as &quot;a combination of &quot;Jeopardy&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.&quot; The set design has been described as Mayan. It included areas for different types of physical challenges: a broad but shallow pool of water (the moat), a set of steps (the Steps of Knowledge), and a large, two-and-a-half-floor vertical labyrinth (the &quot;hidden temple&quot;). At the temple&#x27;s gate was a talking Olmec head simply named Olmec (voiced by Dee Baker). Olmec narrated the stories told in the steps of knowledge and temple game challenges (although in the first season, Fogg narrated the temple game challenges). Each episode centered on a particular legend regarding an artifact (real or fictional) from around the world that found its way to the temple. Some artifacts included &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&#x27;s Headdress&quot;, &quot;The Electrified Key of Benjamin Franklin&quot;, &quot;The Jewel-Encrusted Egg of Catherine the Great&quot;, and &quot;The Broken Wing of Icarus.&quot; Olmec also serves as the basis for the logo. In addition to providing an artifact, the legend also was important to other aspects of the show: the Steps of Knowledge used questions based on the historical legend, and the theme of the temple games was also loosely based on the legend.

In each episode, six teams of two contestants began a three-round competition to determine which team earned the right to enter the temple. Each team was identified with a color and an animal, indicated on their uniform shirts: the Red Jaguars, Blue Barracudas, Green Monkeys, Orange Iguanas, Purple Parrots, and Silver Snakes.

===Round 1: The Moat===
In the first round of the show, the six teams attempted to cross a narrow swimming pool known as &quot;the moat&quot; in a prescribed manner. For example, in one episode, teams were required to swing out to a rope net in the middle of the moat, climb it, and then swim to the other side. All six teams attempted to get both members across according to the rules and push a button on a pedestal to ring a gong. The first four teams to cross the moat and ring their gongs advanced to the second round.

===Round 2: The Steps of Knowledge===
The four remaining teams stood on the topmost of the four levels of the Steps of Knowledge. Olmec began the round by telling the remaining teams the episode&#x27;s legend of the featured artifact, which became the theme for the remainder of the episode. The legend centered on an artifact that the winning team searched for in the final round. At the end of the legend, Olmec told the teams the room in which the artifact could be found. After finishing, he asked the teams a series of questions to test their memory. Each multiple-choice question had three possible answers. A team attempting to answer signaled by stomping on a buzzer on their step, causing the front of the step to illuminate (if Olmec was still in the middle of asking a question, he stopped talking immediately). A team who answered correctly moved down to the next level. If a team answered incorrectly or ran out of time (three seconds after being called upon), the other teams were given a chance to answer. The first two teams to answer three questions correctly and thereby reach the bottom level advanced to the next round.

===Round 3: The Temple Games===
The temple games featured the two remaining teams competing in three physical challenges to earn Pendants of Life which the winning team used in the final round. Several types of temple games were featured, with the episode&#x27;s legend serving as a theme for each. Most temple games lasted for a maximum of 60 seconds but some were untimed. After each challenge, the winning team received some portion of a protective Pendant of Life. The first two challenges, pitting single members from each team against one another, were worth one-half of a pendant, while the final challenge, involving both contestants on both teams, was worth a full pendant. If a temple game ended in a tie, both teams received the pendant value of that game.

The team that earned the most pendants by the end of three temple games won the right to enter the temple. If the two teams earned the same number of pendants after the three temple games, the teams played a tiebreaker to determine who advanced to the temple. The teams stood behind a tiebreaker pedestal, and Fogg (since Season 2, Olmec) asked a tiebreaker question to determine the winner. The first team to hit the buzzer on top of their gong was given the chance to answer the question. A correct answer allowed the team to go to the temple. Originally, a team that buzzed in and gave an incorrect answer or ran out of time automatically lost, allowing the other team to advance to the temple by default. However, in Seasons 2 and 3, the other team was required to answer the question correctly to go to the temple.

===Final Round: The Temple Run===
In the final round, the winning team took the Pendants of Life, the contestants earned into the temple, and attempted to retrieve the episode&#x27;s artifact and bring it back out of the temple within a three-minute time limit. The team designated one member to enter the temple first; that team member carried one of the team&#x27;s full pendants. The other team member held the remaining pendant, half pendant, or no pendant at all and stood by to enter if the first team member was taken out of the temple by a temple guard. Before starting, Olmec would explain the rooms in the temple and the necessary tasks in each room. During season 1, Fogg asked who would go first and explained about the temple guards and, if necessary, the extra half pendant. Beginning in season 2, Olmec himself explained these things.
The temple consisted of twelve rooms, each with a specific theme (e.g., the Throne Room, the King&#x27;s Storeroom, the Observatory, the Shrine of the Silver Monkey, the Heart Room, etc.). The rooms were connected to adjacent rooms by doorways, although some doors were locked, blocking a contestant&#x27;s progress into the adjacent room; the pattern of locked and unlocked doors changed from episode to episode depending both on the temple layout and the artifact&#x27;s location. The unlocked doors were closed at the start of the round, but they could be opened by completing a specific task or puzzle within each room. One room in the temple contained the themed artifact (as stated by Olmec before the Steps of Knowledge round). Three other designated rooms held temple guards (spotters in Lavish Mayan sentinel costumes). If the winning team had exactly pendants, the remaining half pendant was also placed in a room for the contestant with the half pendant to collect to make a full pendant. The extra half pendant, if needed, would either be hanging on the wall near a door or placed inside an object in a room (e.g., hidden inside a pot in the King&#x27;s Storeroom). If the first player dropped their pendant, the second player could pick it up and either throw it back to their partner or use it if needed.

A contestant who encountered a temple guard was forced to give up a full pendant to continue. However, if the first contestant was caught without a pendant in his or her possession, he or she was taken out of the temple and the second contestant entered. In either case, the temple guard who captured the contestant was out of play and did not appear again in the room where the first contestant was captured. When the second contestant entered, any doors that the first contestant opened remained open. If the second contestant was caught without a full pendant, the run ended immediately. A player could enter a room with an unencountered temple guard on their way to the artifact and not get caught, usually if the room design makes it so that the guard can only capture the player if within reach (e.g. the Dark Forest is where one of the trees &quot;could be inhabited by the spirit of a temple guard&quot; which was signaled if the tree grabbed the player, but the player had to be within reach to trigger the tree).

The team had three minutes to retrieve the artifact and leave the temple with it. If either contestant grabbed the artifact, all remaining temple guards vanished and all locked doors in the temple instantly opened, allowing the contestant to escape unhindered. For entering the temple, the team automatically won a prize. If a team member picked up the artifact, the team won a more expensive prize as well. A team that retrieved the artifact and exited the temple with it before time ran out earned the grand prize and the other two prizes. Starting with season 2, the temple had an actual gate that Olmec would lower before the round started.

===2021 revival===
The basic format remained the same as the Nickelodeon show, with the following changes:

* Each episode lasts a full hour rather than a half-hour.
* Each episode features four teams of adults, with same-gender teams allowed.
* Confessionals occur during the first three rounds.
* The first three teams to cross the moat advance to the Steps of Knowledge.
* The episode&#x27;s featured legend is now told more extensively in separate parts before each round, instead of just before the Steps of Knowledge.
* There are two temple games, each played for a full pendant, and with both teammates playing. The two teams compete head-to-head in one game, while the other is a timed challenge, with the winner of the Steps of Knowledge having the choice of which team goes first. If the teams split the first two games, Olmec asks a single tiebreaker question for the final pendant.
* Olmec reveals the location of the artifact before the Temple Run instead of the Steps of Knowledge.
* The temple consists of 11 rooms instead of 12, and the rooms are much larger than the original.
* Temple guards often appear after the contestant finishes the room&#x27;s objective, instead of right when the player enters the room.
* Teams have four minutes rather than three minutes to complete the Temple Run in a redesigned temple. The winning team receives $2,500 just for entering the temple, which is increased to $10,000 if they reach the artifact, and to $25,000 if they exit the temple before time expires.

==Reception==
Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, A.J. Jacobs listed &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; among a series of imitators of &quot;American Gladiators&quot;, describing the concept as &quot;&quot;Gladiators&quot; meets &quot;Young Indiana Jones Chronicles&quot;.&quot; Jacobs criticized the &quot;Steps of Knowledge&quot; round as filler, but concluded that &quot;kids&#x27;ll praise it to the moon.&quot; &quot;Legends&quot; won the award for best game show at the 16th Annual CableACE Awards in January 1995. The show also received nominations at the 17th and 18th Annual CableACE Awards in December 1995 and October 1996 but lost to &quot;The News Hole&quot; and &quot;Debt&quot;. Feminist author Susan Douglas, a Hampshire College professor of media and American studies, praised &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; for being a &quot;nonsexist and nonviolent&quot; show.

==Broadcast history==
New episodes of &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; began airing on Nickelodeon on September 11, 1993, and continued to air until 1995. Reruns aired on the channel for an additional four years until February 28, 1999, when the program stopped airing on Nickelodeon. However, on March 1, 1999, the show once again began airing in reruns on Nick GAS until that network became defunct on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007 (2009 on Dish). Outside of its native country, Nickelodeon also included the show in a block of Nickelodeon programming that aired in 1999 on Zee TV. In March 2009, &quot;TV Week&quot; reported that David Stanley acquired the rights to several Stone-Stanley shows which included &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot;. The assignment was recorded in the copyright office on May 2, 2008. On October 7, 2011, the show aired on TeenNick as part of its The &#x27;90s Are All That block. The show has appeared on TeenNick sporadically since that time. As of 2024, the series currently airs on Pluto TV. On March 24, 2021, the complete series was added to Paramount+.

==Television film==
In March 2016, Nickelodeon announced a TV film version of the game show was in production, with Isabela Moner, Colin Critchley, Jet Jurgensmeyer, and Daniel Cudmore starring in the film. The film was directed by Joe Menendez and written by Jonny Umansky, Zach Hyatt, and Alex J. Reid. It features elements of the original show, including Olmec, The Steps of Knowledge, and cameos from a green monkey, a red jaguar, and silver snakes, among others. Original host Kirk Fogg returned as a fictionalized version of himself and Dee Bradley Baker reprises his role as the voice of Olmec while Michael Benyaer portrays Olmec&#x27;s human form.

==Revival==
On December 16, 2019, it was announced that a revival with adult contestants would premiere in April 2020 on Quibi. Although casting for the reboot was announced on March 10, 2020, in a tweet by Quibi, movement on the production went silent and Quibi was shut down on December 1, 2020. On May 7, 2021, a new casting call for the show went out to the public, contrary to rumors that production was cancelled. On May 11, 2021, the revival was ordered at broadcast network The CW, which is part-owned by what was then known as ViacomCBS (now as Paramount), the parent company of Nickelodeon. The show is hosted by Cristela Alonzo and premiered on October 10, 2021. The basic format—with the moat crossing, Steps of Knowledge, and Temple Games leading to the Temple Run—remains the same. On July 21, 2021, it was announced that Baker would reprise his role as Olmec. Fogg made guest appearances in four episodes, serving as a mentor in one of the temple rooms. Nick Borey and Josh Siniscalco were the only two contestants to appear on the revival that also competed on the original Nickelodeon run in the 1990s as kids. On June 3, 2022, the revival was cancelled.

==Merchandise==
In 2017, Pressman released a &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; board game. It was only available for about a year, and only sold (firsthand) at Target stores. As of mid-2018, it is no longer available from Target stores or their website.

<text>Military operations other than war (MOOTW) are military operations that do not involve warfare, combat, or the threat or use of violence. They generally include peacekeeping, peacebuilding, disaster response, humanitarian aid, military engineering, law enforcement, arms control, deterrence, and multilateralism.

The phrase and acronym were coined by the United States Armed Forces in the 1990s, but it has since fallen out of use. The British Armed Forces use an alternative term called peace support operations (PSO), which essentially refers to the same thing as MOOTW. Similarly, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army also uses a similar concept called non-war military activities, which expands on MOOTW and includes a range of activities categorized as &quot;Confrontational&quot; ,&quot;Law Enforcement&quot;, &quot;Aid &amp; Rescue&quot;, or &quot;Cooperative&quot;.

Special agreements exist which facilitate fire support operations within NATO and the ABCANZ quadripartite working group. Cooperation is organized in advance with NATO standardization agreements (STANAGs) and quadripartite standardization agreements (QSTAGs). Many countries which need disaster support relief have no bilateral agreements already in place, and action may be required, based on the situation, to establish such agreements.

The United Nations (UN) recognizes the vulnerability of civilians in armed conflict. United Nations Security Council resolution 1674 (2006) on the protection of civilians in armed conflict enhances international focused attention on the protection of civilians in UN and other peace operations. The implementation of paragraph 16 anticipates that peacekeeping missions are provided with clear guidelines regarding what missions can and should do to achieve protection goals; that the protection of civilians is given priority in decisions about the use of resources; and that protection mandates are implemented.

==Overview==
MOOTW purposes may include deterring potential aggressors, protecting national interests, and supporting UN objectives.

Peacetime and conflict represent two states of the range of military operations.
* Peacetime is a state in which diplomatic, economic, informational, and military powers are employed in combination with each other to achieve national objectives.
* Conflict is a unique environment in which the military works closely with diplomatic leaders to control hostilities; and the national objective is focused on the goal of returning to peacetime conditions.

Planners are challenged to find ways to resolve or work around unique arrays of inter-related constraints (e.g. issues related to budgeting, training, and force structure). The uncertainties which are inherent or implied include the varying political aspects which are likely to affect unanticipated MOOTW.

==Australia==
The Australian Defence Force has turned attention to the study and understanding of a changing geo-strategic environment. MOOTW becomes more important where the options for traditional application of military instruments are growing more limited.

Australian participation in UN peacekeeping operations began in 1947.

===Select Australian deployments===

* 1947 UN Consular Commission to Indonesia
* 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake (&quot;Operation Sumatra Assist&quot;): Emergency relief and medical assistance.

Current Australian deployments include the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA); the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI); the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP); the UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO); the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT); the UN Mission in the Sudan (UNMIS); and the UN–African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID).

==Canada==

The curriculum of the Canadian Armed Forces&#x27;s training programs includes MOOTW. In the 20th century Canadian peacekeeping was well publicised in Canada.

===Select Canadian deployments===

* Cyprus, 1960s
* Congo, 1960s
* Afghanistan, 2001–2014

==China==

The non-traditional missions of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army have evolved as an increasingly used tool of statecraft.

The People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) established specialized forces for military operations other than war. In the 2013 Science of Military Strategy, PLA writers articulated a Non-War Military Activities (NWMA) concept based on MOOTW which emphasizes &quot;Confrontational,&quot; &quot;Law Enforcement,&quot; &quot;Aid &amp; Rescue,&quot; and &quot;Cooperative&quot; military activities as a source of military strength alongside traditional deterrence and warfighting.

===Select Chinese deployments===

* Somali pirates, 2009: Naval escort missions in waters off Somalia.

== Indonesia ==

The military in Indonesia has evolved as an apparatus for defense based on political decisions.

The Indonesian armed forces are tasked with military operations other than war, which include deterring radicalism and terrorism, securing critical infrastructure such as border controls, protecting dignitaries, providing disaster relief, and assisting the government in securing flight and maritime routes against hijacking, piracy, and trafficking.

=== Select Indonesian deployments ===
* Garuda Contingent, 1956–Present.

==Japan==

The Japan Self-Defense Forces are affected by the Constitution of Japan, Article 9 of which prohibits the use of war to resolve the country&#x27;s disputes. This affects their operations, as well as the classifications of some equipment such as the &quot;Hyūga&quot;-class helicopter destroyer, which are limited to the role of MOOTW.

===Select Japanese deployments===

* Iraq War (&quot;Operation Enduring Freedom&quot;), 2003–2009: Ground Self-Defense Forces, water purification near Basra; Air Self-Defence Forces, cargo and personnel transport; Maritime Self-Defence Forces, supply ships servicing the international flotilla.

==United Kingdom==
The prescience of Sir Julian Corbett (1854–1922) and his strategic point of view are reflected in contemporary applications of MOOTW, which extend and reinvigorate Corbettian formulations.

The evolution of British tactics in the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) illustrates lessons learned the hard way. The British developed a strategy with elements similar to MOOTW. Lieutenant General Sir Harold Briggs proposed &quot;two key goals to accomplish in order to end the insurgency—first, to protect the population, and second to isolate them from the guerrillas.&quot;

British peacekeeping troops in Bosnia in the late 1990s attended to similar objectives in a process of re-establishing &quot;normalcy.&quot;

===Selected British deployments===

* 1948–1960 Malayan Emergency.
* 1995 post-Bosnian War (&quot;Operation Deliberate Force&quot;).

==United States==

In United States military doctrine, military operations other than war include the use of military capabilities across a range of operations that fall short of war. Because of political considerations, MOOTW operations normally have more restrictive rules of engagement (ROE) than in war.

Although the MOOTW acronym is new, the concepts are not. The RAND database identifies 846 military operations other than war between 1916 and 1996 in which the US Air Force or its predecessors played a noteworthy role.

===Select American deployments===

* 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake: Emergency relief and medical assistance.
* 1990–1994 Operation Promote Liberty: Occupation and peacekeeping mission in Panama after the 1989 United States invasion of Panama.
* 1991 Operation Eastern Exit: Noncombatant evacuation operation to evacuate diplomatic staff and civilians, from the US and 29 other countries, from the US Embassy in Mogadishu, Somalia as the city plunged into near-anarchy during the Somali Civil War.
* 2001–2014 Operation Enduring Freedom: Bush Doctrine continuous operation across numerous countries, mainly Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.
* 2011 military intervention in Libya: UN-authorized no-fly zone enforcement in defense of rebel factions in Libya.

==Singapore==
The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) anticipates a continuing need for conventional military competence into the foreseeable future, but missions in which the use of minimal force is the rule rather than the exception are expected to grow in importance. Proficiency in MOOTW requires a much greater and somewhat different set of skill sets than traditional war-fighting. In this context, the SAF is developing new training programmes for small unit leaders. The process of educating and preparing a professional SAF capable of handling a wide spectrum of operations anticipates an increase in MOOTW.
 These men will need to ready to become &quot;peacekeepers, goodwill ambassadors and winners of hearts and minds.&quot;

In 1999, the Singapore contingent of UN peacekeepers in East Timor was the most extensive MOOTW mission attempted by the SAF. The commitment included three landing ship tanks (LSTs), medical teams, C-130s, military observers and logistics support.

===Select Singapore deployments===

* United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor, 1999–2002. Peacekeeping, medical assistance, logistical support.
* 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami, Aceh Province, Sumatra, Indonesia (&quot;Operation Flying Eagle&quot; or OFE): Emergency relief, medical assistance and temporary relocation of victims.

==Sweden==

===Select Swedish deployments===

* Swedish Armed Forces conducted supporting operations during the forest fires of 2014 and 2018.
* Operation Gloria, 2020–&quot;ongoing&quot;. Supporting Swedish civil authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden.

== India ==
The Indian Army is tasked with many operations other than war such as Operation Sadbhavana (Goodwill) in Jammu and Kashmir and Operation Samaritan in north-east India. Operation Sadbhavana aims to limit the alienation faced by the population and infrastructure destruction in Jammu and Kashmir in areas where the government administration has not been successful due to insurgency. Welfare initiatives include Army Goodwill Schools, educational and motivational tours, health camps, women and youth empowerment and infrastructure development.

The Indian defence forces also takes part in various UN Peacekeeping missions.

It &quot;had its beginnings in 1882 as the first settlers, mainly of Scottish origin, pushed into the area in advance of the railroad, most travelling by ox-cart from Brandon.&quot; &quot;Indian&quot; refers to Indigenous peoples in Canada. The town is known for its federally operated experimental farm and tree nursery, which has produced and distributed seedlings for shelter belts since 1901. For many years the program was run by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA).

Indian Head was incorporated as a town in 1902 and the &quot;Canadian Journal&quot; noted that the community was the largest point of initial shipment of wheat in the world. Today it is run by the Agroforestry Development Centre. Today the town &quot;has a range of professional services and tradespeople, financial institutions, and a large number of retail establishments.&quot; The CBC television sitcom &quot;Little Mosque on the Prairie&quot; was partially filmed here.

== Geography ==
Indian Head is located in the Indian Head Plain of the Aspen Parkland ecoregion on the parkland of the Qu&#x27;Appelle flood plain. The area is characterised by lush rolling grasslands, interspersed with poplar bluffs (in prairie Canadian terminology poplar groves surrounding sloughs) and open sloughs. Indian Head is located in the transition zone between the Qu&#x27;Appelle River and the corresponding Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley and the Canadian Prairies. The Indianhead Creek flows through Indian Head into the Qu&#x27;Appelle River to the north. The legal land description is section 24 – township 18 – range 13 – west of the 2nd meridian. About north of Indian Head are the Fishing Lakes which are part of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley.

== Climate ==

Indian Head has a humid continental climate, with extreme seasonal temperatures. It has warm summers and cold winters, with the average daily temperatures ranging from in January to in July. On Average, temperatures exceed 12 days per year. Typically, summer lasts from late June until late August, and the humidity is seldom uncomfortably high. Winter lasts from November to March and varies greatly in length and severity. Spring and autumn are both short and highly variable.

The highest temperature ever recorded in Indian Head was on 5 July 1937. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 1 February 1893.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Indian Head had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

In 2011, 50 percent were male and 50 per cent were female. Also in 2011, children under five accounted for approximately 6.1 per cent of the resident population of Indian Head.

According to data from 2001, more than 33.6% of the town&#x27;s residents identify themselves as Catholic; 48.9% of residents are Protestant, and 12.3% of residents do not practise a religion.
== Government ==

The town of Indian Head has a mayor as the highest ranking government official. The town also elects aldermen or councillors to form the municipal council. Currently, the mayor is Steven Cole and is serving with councillors Lisa Craigie, Alan Hubbs, Melissa Moses, Armand Palmer, Chris Simpson and Nathan Longeau. The town administrator is Cam Thauberger.

Provincially, Indian Head is within the constituency of Indian Head-Milestone served by their Member of legislative assembly, the Honourable Don McMorris. Federally, the Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle riding is represented by their Member of Parliament, Andrew Scheer.

== Infrastructure ==
Even though the provincial government Saskatchewan Air Ambulance system was not established until 1946, Indian Head did call to Charlie Skinner, a pilot in Regina in 1935. Transport was needed to get the doctor from Indian Head to Odessa to treat a critically ill patient during a time when the roads were blocked by snow. Thus began Skinner&#x27;s Air Service.

The first communication system in Saskatchewan was on the Bell Farm built in 1882 by Major Bell on ten miles (16 km) square or at Indian Head. The telecommunications system utilised barbed wire for the phone lines.

=== Transportation ===

Indian Head is served by the Canadian Pacific Railway. It is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway (Saskatchewan Highway 1) and Highway 56. It is about east of the provincial capital city of Regina and west of Winnipeg.

An Indian trail used by fur traders, and red river carts pulling settlers effects was the first path between Moosomin and Fort Ellice, Manitoba. The transcontinental CPR paralleled this trail when coming through in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

&quot;Provincial Highway 4&quot;, the precursor of the Trans–Canada Saskatchewan Highway 1, followed the surveyed grade of the transcontinental CPR between the Alberta and Manitoba border. Travel along Provincial Highway 4 before the 1940s would have been travelling on the &quot;square&quot; following the township road allowances, barbed wire fencing and rail lines. As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel, the first highway was designed on 90 degree right angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads. Two-horse then eight-horse scrapers maintained these early dirt roads.

One of the problems that came about was when the Manitoba survey met the Saskatchewan survey. The Manitoba survey allowed for road allowances placed east and west every . This system was followed west of Manitoba until just north of Indian Head. However, the Saskatchewan survey conducted in 1887, allowed for road allowances and placed roads east and west every . The two surveys needed a correction which took years to smooth out.

Agriculture is one of Saskatchewan&#x27;s main industries and taking grain to elevators was first accomplished by horse and cart, to be replaced around World War I by truck travel. Long haul trucking flourished between 1950 and 1970, and the Trans–Canada was completed across Canada by 1970. Since the 1970s, 17 times the number of grain trucks and 95 percent of goods transported now are hauled by truck across Saskatchewan.

== Education ==

The Indian Head High School hosts the Broncs athletic teams and is part of the Prairie Valley School Division No. 208 along with the Indian Head Elementary School. Indian Head Elementary School features classes Pre-Kindergarten to grade 6 with about 205 enrolled. The high school supports grades 7 to 12 with an enrollment of about 225 pupils.

The Southeast Regional College has a district campus office located in Indian Head which will support grade 12 equivalency general education development, post-secondary classes supported by the University of Regina, University of Saskatchewan, SIAST and the Certified General Accountants Association. Some post-secondary skills and career services are additionally available.

Historically there were quite a number of one-room school houses in the area of Indian Head the first, Indian Head School District #49, was established in 1886. It was followed soon after by Wide Awake School District #54. Other schools were Sunny South School District #61, Katepwe School District #116, Rose Valley School District # 191 Fair Play School District #192, Blackwood School District #241, Flen Lynn School District #333 Burnsdale School District #777, Jubilee School District #1122, Interlake School District #1565, Sunny Slope School District #1843, Squirrel Hills School District #4058, Lake Marqerite School District #1237 and Spring Coulee School.

== Museums and other points of interest ==

Charhead Ranch Farm features Charolais cattle, dairy operation and Welsh ponies on this 75-year-old farm.

The Bell Farm is amongst the top ten most endangered sites listed by the Heritage Canada Foundation. Having the silo centrally located in the round barn greatly reduced labour involved in livestock feeding and resulted in a stronger facility than the rectangular structures. It is currently undergoing re-construction and preservation.

Thirty-two hectares of federal crown land comprise the Indian Head Migratory Bird Sanctuary located south of Indian Head. The Canada Agriculture Experimental Farm Tree Nursery is a part of the sanctuary lands The Canadian Wildlife Service on its last review felt that the sanctuary should be abolished.

The Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA) and PFRA shelterbelt centre set up in 1902 features a picnic area with nature trails along with tree nursery, and flora displays. The nursery still establishes farm shelterbelts with its shipments of trees every year across Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.

Indian Head Experimental Station or Indian Head Research Farm established in 1887 provides innovative research into crops and soil types.

The Indian Head Museum features pioneer artifacts and is hosted in the 1907 fire hall. In the museum yards is a 1926 one-room school house and an 1883 Bell Farm cottage.

== Sports and recreation ==
As early as 1889, Indian Head had established its own curling rink, and in 1904 it was a provincial sport. Indian Head was one of four rinks which competed in the first curling bonspiel of the North-West Territories in 1892 playing against Calgary, Regina, and Qu&#x27;Appelle.

Indian Head established its hockey team by 1900, one of the first of a dozen or so in the North-West Territories.

After World War II, for a period of time, baseball tournaments were held in Saskatoon and Indian Head offering thousands of dollars in prize money. In the 1950s, Indian Head hosted an all-black baseball team called the Rockets; the players were Negro league players from Jacksonville, Florida. The team was extremely popular and reportedly brought thousands of people to the town to watch them play. The Rockets were inducted into the Saskatchewan Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022.

Indian Head is home to the Saskatchewan Rural Sports Hall of Fame and Museum established in 1992 which commemorates athletes from rural Saskatchewan who achieved fame in the big leagues.

In 2013, the Indian Head Broncs hosted and won the 3A 9 Man Provincial High School Football Championship, defeating the Meadow Lake Spartans 14–7.

== History ==

=== First non-aboriginal settlers ===
The first settlers were from Ontario and of Scottish origin. They moved into the district in 1882, ahead of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Bell Farm at Indian Head comprised . Such settlement was so huge and out of the ordinary that on many occasions the passenger trains would stop and let the passengers watch the harvesting operation.

=== Historical economy ===
Historically, according to the Department of Agriculture, the Indian Head district ranked highest for wheat production in the North-West Territories in 1903, 1904 and 1905. The Indian Head Experimental Station exceeded the Brandon Experimental station by seven bushels of wheat per acre for ten years. For a town of population 1,800 in 1905, it boasted twelve grain elevators which were erected along the Canadian Pacific Railway, with each elevator having the capacity to hold approximately 350,000 bushels. This location handled a higher quantity of grain in 1902 in the initiatory shipment stage than any other inland port in the world.

The North-West Rebellion in 1885 caused the farmland of the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley Farming Company to lie untended as their horses and wagons were used in the military engagement. The summer of 1886 provided a good crop as the land was allowed to collect moisture. The Indian Head Experimental Farm then followed up and said: &quot;fallowing the land is the best preparation to ensure a crop.&quot;
The Territorial Grain Growers&#x27; Association (TGGA) was formed in the winter of 1901 at Indian Head. It was a collective of farmers in the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley responding to the Sinatluta Case. In the fall of 1901 farmers were trying to ship a large harvest and they could not sell it due to a boxcar shortage. The existing elevators were not set up to hold the amount of grain that year. Farmers lost about half of a record wheat crop. William Richard Motherwell became the first president and pressed for a change to the Manitoba Act which would allow farmers access to railway cars on a first-come, first-served basis.

In the early 20th century Indian Head was the financial centre of the district and distribution point. Three banks established branches, the Opera House was erected by Mr. Osment, and The Club conducted its operations within the opera house block. The Lady Minto Hospital was erected at a cost of CA$6,000. ($6,000 is equivalent to $ in present day terms. Rationale to use US currency conversion template. $10 Canadian was equivalent to US$10 gold eagle 1851-1867. 1879-1914 the US and Canadian dollar traded again at par.&lt;/ref&gt; Rationale to use US currency conversion template. Bank of Canada notes that from 1854 to 1914 the US and Canadian dollar traded at par)&lt;/ref&gt; Streetscapes were extremely lively before the arrival of motorised automobiles, trucks and farm implements. Farmers&#x27; drives to Indian Head were extremely frequent; expeditions to Regina, the nearest city, the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley and near towns were considerably less convenient than they became once car and truck engines existed and Number 1 Highway was vastly upgraded from the 1950s onwards: trips were most easily made by the frequent trains, which carried passengers in early days until substantially replaced by road vehicles.

=== Dominion Experimental Farm ===
In 1887 the Dominion Experimental Farm was founded as one of the original research stations in Canada. Today it is still doing research and giving valuable information to farmers. Settlement began to accelerate seriously after 1900 and by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 its population had reached 1200. In 1902, the PFRA tree nursery was inaugurated and is still shipping out several million trees each year for farm shelterbelts in the three prairie provinces. &quot;The Indian Head Experimental Farm [was] responsible for the whole of the North-West Territories. The intent of the farm was to meet the needs of new settlers for reliable information on the best farming methods and practices for local conditions. Long-term studies with field crops, animal husbandry and horticulture were initiated….During the 1930s, a concerted effort against the blowing topsoil by the Indian Head Experimental Farm and [other] …stations … was effective in developing tillage methods that reduced soil erosion. The post-war years saw great changes with the introduction of selective chemicals to control insects, plant diseases and [w]eeds. Programs were set up at all stations to advise farmers on the use of these new chemicals. Nutrition and management studies at Indian Head [and other stations] have done much to improve livestock production in the province.&quot;

=== Early centre of arrival in and departure from the North-West Territories ===
In the days of the last two decades of the 19th century, Indian Head was a significant centre for people arriving in the North-West Territories by train from Ontario. It was necessary for the town to have hotel accommodation for travellers and several were on hand.

Their appearance now seems extraordinarily substantial but at the beginning of settlement of what was later to become the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta it appeared certain that the population of the eventual provinces would be substantially greater than it turned out and that the provincial capital, whatever it might be, would be vastly larger.

Indian Head streetscapes were remarkably lively in the town&#x27;s early days, when automobiles and trucks had not yet arrived and agricultural, shopping and social expeditions to town were extremely frequent compared to later days when expeditions to Regina or the Qu&#x27;Appelle Valley became significantly faster and more convenient than after World War I, when automobiles and trucks began to become common: until then, expeditions to the city generally conducted by train—with a lengthy interruption with little travel of any kind from the 1929 onset of the Great Depression until the 1945 end of World War II.

=== Philharmonic Society ===
The Philharmonic Society in Indian Head was established in the early 20th century. In 1914, A.S. Vogt (founder of the Mendelssohn Choir) claimed that Saskatchewan&#x27;s excellent choral work was one benefit of the province’s isolation and corresponding need to create its own art.

=== Churches ===
At its outset, Indian Head had substantial churches, though as elsewhere in Canada religiosity significantly declined beginning in the late 1960s. In the beginning, the denominations were principally Presbyterian, Methodist, Anglican, and Roman Catholic. 

Indian Head&#x27;s Methodist church became United Church in 1925 but as in nearby Qu&#x27;Appelle the Presbyterian church divided, with a portion of the congregation constituting a continuing separate Presbyterian church. The Indian Head and Qu&#x27;Appelle Presbyterian churches were demanding if not downright prestigious and obtained clergy of considerable talent, who on leaving proceeded to urban congregations such as First Presbyterian in Regina. Thereafter the Presbyterians shared a clergyman with the Presbyterian church in Qu&#x27;Appelle, which had withdrawn from the old Presbyterian church thereupon church union. &quot;In 1923 the Orange Benevolent Society, then a substantial service club of the Loyal Orange Lodge established the Orange Home and Orange Home Farm for children from distressed families.&quot;

The Anglican Church (until 1955 the &quot;Church of England&quot;) Diocese of Qu&#x27;Appelle was originally centred in the nearby town of Qu&#x27;Appelle, whose parish church was the pro-cathedral for southern Saskatchewan. The Hon. Edgar Dewdney was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories (sic) December 3, 1881, and it was not immediately clear that he would choose Pile-of-Bones, renamed Regina in 1882—where he had acquired land to sell for private profit—as the capital of the Territories. It had previously been thought likely that other sites would be chosen, including Prince Albert, the seat-of-government of the Territories&#x27; District of Saskatchewan, Fort Qu&#x27;Appelle and Qu&#x27;Appelle: this accounts for the Church of England&#x27;s original choice of Qu&#x27;Appelle and uncertainty as to what to choose in the alternative. Bishop&#x27;s Court, the residence of the diocesan bishop, was relocated from Qu&#x27;Appelle to Indian Head in 1895 before being further relocated to Regina. Such matters were of substantially greater interest back then and would remain so until the end of the 1960s when in Indian Head as in other Canadian cities and towns participation in religion generally began steadily decreasing. Nevertheless, St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church had &quot;[t]he first...built in the early 1900s, and the present church was completed in 1961.&quot;

<text>The Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, commonly referred to as the AA, is the oldest private school of architecture in the UK. The AA hosts exhibitions, lectures, symposia and publications.
==History==

The Architectural Association was founded in 1847 as an alternative to the practice of training young men via apprenticeship to established architects. Apprenticeships offered no guarantee of educational quality or professional standards, and the system was believed to be &quot;rife with vested interests and open to abuse, dishonesty and incompetence&quot;.

Two articled pupils, Robert Kerr (1823–1904) and Charles Gray (1827/28–1881), proposed a systematic course of training provided by the students themselves.
Following a merger with the Association of Architectural Draughtsmen, the first formal meeting under the name of the Architectural Association took place in May 1847 at Lyons Inn Hall, London. Kerr became the first president (1847–48). From 1859, the AA shared premises at 9 Conduit Street with the Royal Institute of British Architects, later (1891) renting rooms in Great Marlborough Street.
The AA School was formally established in 1890, and in 1901, it moved to the former Royal Architectural Museum in Tufton Street, Westminster. In 1917, it moved to its current location in Bedford Square, central London, and has since acquired additional London premises in John Street, a property on Morwell Street behind Bedford Square, and a site at Hooke Park in Dorset.

Historically, students of the AA have been addressed by John Ruskin and George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century, and, more recently, by Richard Rogers, Zaha Hadid, Rem Koolhaas, Denise Scott Brown, and David Chipperfield, an alumnus of the school.

===Women at the AA===
Women were first admitted as students to the AA School during World War I in 1917, almost 20 years after the RIBA had admitted its first female member, Ethel Charles, who, with her sister Bessie, had been refused entry to the AA school in 1893. Ruth Gollancz, Winifred Ryle, Irene Graves and Gillian Harrison (nee Cooke) were some of the first women to enter the AA, hitherto a solely male school.

In the post World War II period, several women architects, writers, and journalists attended courses (&quot;classes and sets&quot;) at the AA, including Su Brumwell (Susan Miller / Rogers), Eldred Evans, Margot Griffin, Zaha Hadid, Patti Hopkins, Samantha Hardingham, Sally Mackereth, Mya Anastasia Manakides, Janet Street-Porter, Carolyn Trevor, Susan Wheeler and Georgie Walton.

The position of women at the AA was highlighted and investigated during a year-long programme of celebration in 2017, &quot;AAXX&quot;, marking the centenary of the first women&#x27;s entry to the school. A book, &quot;AA Women in Architecture 1917–2017&quot;, edited by Elizabeth Darling and Lynne Walker, was published.

==Curriculum==
Courses are divided into two main areas: undergraduate programmes, leading to the AA Diploma (RIBA/ARB Part 2), and postgraduate programmes, which include specialised courses in Landscape Urbanism, Housing and Urbanism, Sustainable Environmental Design, Histories and Theories, Emergent Technologies, and Design Research Lab. Other programmes include Projective Cities, Design + Make, and Interprofessional studio. Since its foundation, the school has continued to draw its teaching staff from progressive international practices. Teaching staff are reappointed annually, allowing a continual renewal of the exploration of architectural graphics and polemical formalism.

===Independent status===
The school sits outside the state-funded university system and UCAS application system. As an independent school, the AA does not participate in university rankings.

The AA enrolls a higher proportion of students from overseas compared to other architecture schools in the UK.

==Bookshop and publications==
The AA Bookshop has a collection of architectural literature and is a platform for AA&#x27;s own publications. AA Publications has a tradition of publishing architects, artists and theorists early in their careers, as well as occasionally publishing figures who have already gained renown in other fields of expertise, such as Salman Rushdie. AA Publications produces the journal, &quot;AA Files&quot;, and the AA Book, known as the &quot;Projects Review&quot;, which annually documents the work undertaken by members of the school from Foundation to Graduate programmes. AA publications are designed and edited by the &quot;AA Print Studio&quot;, originally established in 1971 as part of the Communications Unit directed by Dennis Crompton of Archigram. The school formerly had its own independent radio station.

==Controversies==
The AA has a unique democratic structure where staff and students elect a director and a majority of the members of the governing board.

In November 2017, the AA reportedly planned to make 16 staff redundant, including the whole of its publications and exhibitions departments. Shortly before, the AA had announced it was seeking a new director, to be appointed by March 2018, following the departure of Brett Steele announced in December 2016.

The first female director of the AA was Eva Franch i Gilabert, appointed in 2018 (succeeding interim director Samantha Hardingham). Following votes of no confidence in her leadership, Franch was fired in July 2020 for &quot;failure to develop and implement a strategy and maintain the confidence of the AA School Community, which were specific failures of performance against clear objectives outlined in the original contract of employment.&quot; Her dismissal came despite support from academics who wrote an open letter talking of &quot;systemic biases&quot; against women and of sexism, and accusing the AA of using &quot;the pandemic for anti-democratic purposes&quot;. Architectural magazine &quot;Dezeen&quot; reported that tutor and alumni views indicated that the failure to investigate allegations of bullying and sexism had damaged both the AA school and the architecture profession, leaving &quot;a cloud over the school&quot;. The AA began seeking a successor to Franch in December 2021, shortlisting candidates in March 2022. In May 2022, the school announced Ingrid Schroder would be its new director from August 2022.

<text>Norman Cameron (1905–1953) was a Scottish poet, distantly related to Thomas Babington, Lord Macaulay. Between the two world wars, Cameron associated on Majorca with Robert Graves and Laura Riding. Later, as a part-time Fitzrovian, he worked closely with Dylan Thomas, Geoffrey Grigson, Ruthven Todd, Len Lye, John Aldridge RA, Alan Hodge and many others. He worked as a copywriter at J. Walter Thompson (being responsible for one classic campaign, &quot;Horlicks for night starvation&quot;) and at Ogilvy, Benson &amp; Mather.

==Life==

Born in Bombay, Cameron was the eldest of four children of a Presbyterian minister (chaplain of the Bombay Presidency) who died prematurely in 1913. Subsequently, he and his siblings returned with their mother to live in Edinburgh. For his education he went to Alton Burn Preparatory School in Nairn and Fettes College in Edinburgh, where, at only 11 years old, he was the youngest boy ever to be admitted to the main school. There he came under the influence of, and retained a friendship with, W.C. Sellar (who would later write &quot;1066 and all that&quot;).

He went on to Oriel College, Oxford, and his verse was published in &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot; from 1925 to 1928. Needing money during the Great Depression, he taught briefly in Nigeria, under the auspices of that Colonial Government&#x27;s Education Department. Then he spent time working and travelling in Continental Europe. While in Germany, during the early part of Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship, he saw an incident which shocked him all his life: starving inmates of a concentration camp being tormented by local inhabitants, who were throwing bread so that it landed only just beyond the captives&#x27; reach. As a result of this, he was utterly dismissive of all later German assertions that most people remained ignorant of what was happening within the worst of the camps.

During the war he worked in London at Broadcasting House for the Political Intelligence Department, using his fluency in French and German; in the North African Campaign, from Alexandria, he continued in the same shadowy organisation, where with Bruno Adler, he wrote radio scripts for a comedy series called &#x27;Kurt and Willy&#x27;, picked up by Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. At some time, he was parachuted into Yugoslavia as a translator in dealings with Tito, probably with the 1943 mission led by Fitzroy Maclean. For his work in the war he was awarded an MBE.

At the war&#x27;s end he worked in the British Zone of Austria (then under four power military occupation) in the British Delegation of the Allied Commission for Austria, in Vienna, based at Schönbrunn Palace. His duties there involved restarting the local newspapers. It was during this period that he met the woman who became his third wife: Austrian journalist Dr Gretl Bajardi.

A fire broke out in the couple&#x27;s flat in Queens Gate, South Kensington, in 1951; and though all his own writings were saved from the flames, his life&#x27;s collection of considerable works of reference in art and literature was completely destroyed. He told his younger brother Angus (then working in the British Army Staff in Vienna) that he was distraught, that the loss &#x27;was like losing his own soul and one which he thought, perhaps, spelt the end of his writing&#x27;.

Cameron, regarded by Dylan Thomas as his best friend, died in London of a brain haemorrhage only six months before Thomas&#x27;s own demise.

==Work==

His poetic output amounted to about 70 poems, he translated works by François Villon, Balzac (&quot;Cousin Pons&quot;), Voltaire (&quot;Candide&quot;), Benjamin Constant (&quot;Adolphe&quot;) and Rimbaud and he also translated and contributed to &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Table Talk 1941-1944&quot;, with others including Hugh Trevor-Roper.

Mostly self-taught as a writer, he was nevertheless subtly influenced by his friend Robert Graves; and for a while he became a poetic disciple of Laura Riding, but ceased close dealings with her when he was convinced that she was exercising undue influence on his own style. This breach caused considerable consternation to Laura and some loss to his own wealth – but not to his own dignity.

<doc id="1051882" wikidata="Q2782497" url="?curid=1051882" title="La Ronge">
<text>La Ronge is a northern town in the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, Canada. The town is also the namesake of the larger La Ronge population centre, the largest in northern Saskatchewan, comprising the Northern Village of Air Ronge, and the Kitsakie 156B and Lac La Ronge 156 reserves of the Lac La Ronge First Nation.

The town is located approximately north of Prince Albert and lies on the western shore of Lac la Ronge, is adjacent to Lac La Ronge Provincial Park, and is on the edge of the Canadian Shield.

== History ==
The name “La Ronge” comes from the lake itself, although the actual origin of the name is uncertain. The French verb &quot;ronger&quot; translates as “to gnaw”, with at least one explanation theorising that 17th- and 18th-century French fur traders referred to the lake as &quot;la ronge&quot; (literally, &quot;the chewed&quot;) due to the abundant beaver population along the lake’s shoreline. Undoubtedly, many of the trees along the water’s edge would have been visibly chewed, or completely gnawed to the ground and taken away by the rodents for their dam construction.

In 1782, Swiss born fur trader Jean-Étienne Waddens had a fur trade post on Lac La Ronge. In March 1782, Waddens was fatally wounded in a quarrel with his associate Peter Pond.

La Ronge began in 1904 as a fur trading post and meeting place, but with the decline of hunting and the fur market, La Ronge has diversified into other areas. Many of the Dene, Cree, and white trappers used La Ronge as their central service point. It incorporated as a northern village on 3 May 1905.
With the extension of Highway 2 from Prince Albert in 1947, La Ronge became a major tourist fishing area. The highway between La Ronge and Prince Albert expanded the community further in the 1970s after it was paved.

In the early 1950s and 1960s, the mineral resources in the La Ronge area began to be explored and developed.

La Ronge&#x27;s status changed from northern village to industrial town in 1965 and then to town on 1 November 1976 before finally becoming a northern town on 1 October 1983.

=== Wildfire evacuations ===

In May 1999, the community of La Ronge was evacuated after a fire burned through the far north of the town. The wildfire burned multiple houses before conditions pushed the fire away from the town and crews were able to extinguish it.

Once again in July 2015, La Ronge was threatened by dangerous forest fires that combined forcing approximately 7,000 people to evacuate from their homes. Many cabins and homes were burnt. The fire came within 2 km of La Ronge and burned completely around the La Ronge Airport making it difficult to fight the fire from air with smokey conditions and unreliable weather making the fight against the fires very difficult. In total there were over a hundred fires burning in Northern Saskatchewan at once which forced over 13,000 residents to flee their homes, resulting in the province&#x27;s largest evacuation ever. The fires were caused by low precipitation in the winter and summer months and also high temperatures.

== Geography ==
La Ronge is surrounded by several First Nations reserves, with the Northern Village of Air Ronge located just south of the community on Highway 2. With access to all other points north, east and west, and transportation linkage to the south, La Ronge is also the northern hub for the Saskatchewan provincial government.

=== Climate ===

According to the Köppen–Geiger and Trewartha climate classification systems, La Ronge experiences a borderline (warm-summer) humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;; Trewartha &quot;Dc&quot;)—prior to the 1991–2020 normals, it experienced a continental subarctic climate (Köppen &quot;Dfc&quot;; Trewartha &quot;Ec&quot;). Winters are long, dry and very cold while summer is short, warm and wetter. Precipitation is fairly low, with an annual average of . The highest temperature ever recorded in La Ronge was on 23 August 1929. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 15 February 1936.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, La Ronge had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
=== Population centre ===
The La Ronge population centre, the fourteenth largest population centre in the province, comprises four adjoining census subdivisions including the Northern Town of La Ronge, the Northern Village of Air Ronge and the Kitsakie 156B and Lac La Ronge 156 Indian reserves of the Lac La Ronge First Nation.

In the 2016 Census, Statistics Canada reported that the La Ronge population centre had a population of 5,671 living in 1,704 of its 1,927 total dwellings, a +6.6% change from its 2011 population of 5,318. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

The following is a population breakdown of the La Ronge population centre by census subdivision.
== Economy ==
Several mining companies, government agencies, and airlines now keep offices in La Ronge, and the local Chamber of Commerce has many other retail and service businesses amongst its members.

La Ronge Wild Rice Corporation processes freshly harvested wild rice (in August to October) from Northern Saskatchewan farmers.

Tourism also brings in many of people to the La Ronge area. In the summer time, many people visit the Lac La Ronge Provincial Park which is Saskatchewan&#x27;s largest Provincial Park.

== Sports ==

The community is also home to the La Ronge Ice Wolves ice hockey team of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, La Ronge minor hockey association and the La Ronge Crushers men&#x27;s hockey league and the La Ronge women&#x27;s hockey league. La Ronge also has a minor baseball program with many teams and age groups.

La Ronge is home to an 8 team Ladies Slopitch League - JRMCC Ladies Slopitch (slow-pitch softball). The Churchill Community High School and the Senator Myles Venne High School both have many sports programs and partake in the Saskatchewan High School Athletic Association. There are many other sports available in the community including volleyball, broomball, curling and a women&#x27;s hockey program.

== Government ==
In 2009, La Ronge elected 21-year-old councillor Thomas Sierzycki as its mayor. This established La Ronge as having one of the youngest mayors in Canada. Sierzycki stayed in office for two terms up until October 2016 when he decided not to run for a third term after a failed bid to land himself a seat as a Saskatchewan MLA with the Saskatchewan Party in the April 2016 election.

== Education ==
There are two high schools and three elementary schools in La Ronge and Air Ronge. High schools include Churchill Community High School and / Senator Myles Venne High School. Elementary schools in La Ronge and Air Ronge include Pre-cam Community School, Gordon Denny Community School, and Bells Point Elementary School.

Northlands College maintains its main campus in La Ronge and took over the Nortep / Norpac program after the Saskatchewan provincial government cut funding to the program in March 2017.

== Transportation ==

La Ronge is connected to southern Saskatchewan by Highway 2, which continues north as Highway 102. La Ronge is served by the La Ronge (Barber Field) Airport and the La Ronge Water Aerodrome.

<doc id="1051886" wikidata="Q1970440" url="?curid=1051886" title="The Blue Nile (band)">
<text>The Blue Nile were a Scottish band which originated in Glasgow. The group&#x27;s early music was built heavily on synthesizers and electronic instrumentation and percussion, although later works featured guitar more prominently. Following early championing by established artists such as Rickie Lee Jones and Peter Gabriel (the band later worked with both acts), the Blue Nile gained critical acclaim, particularly for their first two albums &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; and &quot;Hats&quot;, and some commercial success in both the UK and the US, which led to the band working with a wide range of musicians from the late 1980s onwards.

The Blue Nile&#x27;s highest chart placement came when &quot;Tinseltown in the Rain&quot; reached No. 28 in the Netherlands in 1984, their only Dutch charting song. The band has had four top 75 hits on the UK singles chart, the highest being &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, which reached No. 50 in 1991. In the United States, &quot;The Downtown Lights&quot; was their only chart entry, peaking at No. 10 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart.

The band members have also gained a reputation for their avoidance of publicity, their idiosyncratic dealings with the recording industry, and their perfectionism and slow work rate, which has resulted in the release of just four albums since the group&#x27;s formation in 1981. The group appear to have disbanded since the release of their fourth album &quot;High&quot; in 2004, although there has never been any official confirmation.

In 2006, Buchanan had a top 10 hit in the UK when he featured on Texas&#x27; song &quot;Sleep&quot;, which reached No. 6.

Paul Buchanan (born 16 April 1956, Edinburgh, Scotland) and his childhood friend Robert Bell grew up together in Glasgow. They both attended the University of Glasgow in the late 1970s, Buchanan gaining a degree in literature and medieval history, Bell a degree in mathematics. Buchanan&#x27;s civil-servant father had been a semi-professional musician and had musical instruments in the house, but it was only after he and Bell had graduated that Buchanan began to think seriously about a career in music.

Although Buchanan had grown up in the same neighbourhood as Paul Joseph &quot;PJ&quot; Moore, they only became well acquainted at university, where Moore was studying electronics, and the three friends became part of a band, first known as McIntyre (named after the John McIntyre Building, the university&#x27;s administrative offices) and then Night by Night, although Buchanan later commented that Night by Night only played &quot;twice, maybe three times&quot; in its short existence. The band struggled to retain a settled line-up and, by 1981, Buchanan, Bell and Moore were the only remaining members. They decided not to recruit anybody else, trading in a guitar for an effect pedal and borrowing an old drum machine that only played Hispanic American music rhythms. Buchanan later recalled, &quot;We went and gigged, because we needed the money, we&#x27;d do gigs where we&#x27;d do cover versions with the cassette of Latin American rhythms. And we were terrible. But we picked songs that were so completely durable and well known that people recognized them. No matter how badly we mangled them.&quot;

Renaming themselves the Blue Nile (after the title of the 1962 book by Alan Moorehead), the group managed to raise enough money to record and release its first single, &quot;I Love This Life&quot;, on their own Peppermint Records label. Only a limited number were produced, but one found its way to RSO Records via their friend and engineer Calum Malcolm. Malcolm had been a member of short-lived Edinburgh punk band The Headboys who had released their records on the RSO label, and he still had contacts with the company. RSO licensed the single for distribution, but almost as soon as the record was released RSO went bankrupt and was absorbed into the PolyGram recording company, and the single consequently disappeared.

===&quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; (1982–1984)===
Undaunted by this setback, they continued to play gigs around Glasgow, starting to write their own songs alongside the cover versions they were playing. Having no drummer and with limited musical ability, particularly in Buchanan&#x27;s guitar playing (he later admitted that &quot;we could play a little, but I was the worst by a long way&quot;), the newly formed Blue Nile adopted an atmospheric, electronic approach primarily out of pragmatism. The band also made the most of their imagination, thrift and mechanical ingenuity. Buchanan recalled, &quot;PJ had bought a tray from a waiter. It was made of zinc and it made a good noise when you hit it. We sampled it and PJ made a pad to trigger it from for £3. It was all very primitive back then — you had to hit it about two seconds before you wanted the sound to appear in the song.&quot;

The most commonly told story about the Blue Nile is that in 1983 they were approached by a local hi-fi manufacturer, Linn Products, and asked to produce a song that would showcase the Linn equipment to best effect. Linn was so pleased with the resulting record that it offered the Blue Nile a contract to make a whole album, and set up its own record label specifically to release it.

In interviews, both Buchanan and Moore have categorically denied that Linn approached the band to make a record for them, or that the record company influenced the album&#x27;s sound in any way at all, with Moore saying, &quot;It was a myth that we were a &#x27;hi-fi band signed to a hi-fi company&#x27;. We just got lucky that we&#x27;d found our way to an excellent engineer who knew the company.&quot; The engineer in question was Calum Malcolm, with whom the band had already recorded some demos in his Castlesound studio near Edinburgh. Since Malcolm was a friend of Linn&#x27;s founder Ivor Tiefenbrun, and had ties with the company, his studio was fitted out with Linn equipment. When Linn representatives visited one day and asked to hear some music to test out their new speakers, Malcolm played them the demo of &quot;Tinseltown in the Rain&quot;. Impressed, Linn offered the band a contract with the record label it was in the process of setting up. Despite the fact that the group took nine months to reply to Linn&#x27;s offer, the contract was eventually signed and its first album, &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot;, was released as Linn Records&#x27; first album in May 1984.

On its release, &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; gained widespread acclaim from music critics for its mixture of sparse, detailed electronic sounds and Buchanan&#x27;s soulful vocals, later described as a &quot;fusion of chilly technology and a pitch of confessional, romantic soul&quot;. In 1984, the band gained greater exposure in Europe, with the videos for their two singles, &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Tinseltown in the Rain&quot;, often shown on the video channel Music Box. The band&#x27;s profile began to grow, although its existence remained precarious. Buchanan commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve always found it strange that people missed the &#x27;punk&#x27; aspect of &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot;. We were living in a flat in Glasgow with no hot water. We barely knew what we were doing and that was very liberating.&quot;

===&quot;Hats&quot; (1985–1990)===
Keen to capitalise on the positive critical reception awarded to &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot;, Linn sent the band back to Castlesound studio early in 1985 to produce a quick follow-up record. However, as the band later admitted, there was no new material ready to record, and they were not happy with the songs they were producing under pressure in the studio. The lack of progress led to stress and arguments, in particular between Buchanan (who tended to ultimately get his way in disputes) and Moore (who felt like a &quot;third wheel&quot; in the band due to the fact that Buchanan and Bell did most of the songwriting). In 2022, Moore recalled that his working relationship with Buchanan had already become &quot;seriously strained&quot;, and that at one point &quot;Paul was terrified to go into the studio, because I&#x27;d be in the studio and [he thought] I was going to ruin his buzz. It was falling apart.&quot;

Matters were not helped when Virgin Records, to whom Linn had licensed the band&#x27;s records, began legal proceedings against the group and the label for not producing the new material stipulated in the licensing agreement. After two years with almost nothing to show for its efforts, the band was forced to leave the studio to make way for another band, and had to return home to Glasgow. Away from the pressures of the studio, the group overcame the writer&#x27;s block and, eventually returning to Castlesound in 1988, was able to rapidly complete a new album.

&quot;Hats&quot; was released in October 1989 to rave reviews, including a rare five-star rating from &quot;Q&quot; magazine. Warmer and smoother sounding than the first album, and exploring the highs and lows of romantic love, &quot;Hats&quot; peaked at #12 on the UK Albums Chart. It was also the group&#x27;s breakthrough record in the US, where it reached #108 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts in May 1990. All three singles released in the UK from the album made the top 75 in the UK Singles Chart.

The Blue Nile&#x27;s first live public performance after making &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; was in December 1989 on the television programme &quot;Halfway to Paradise&quot;, a Scottish-based arts magazine show broadcast on Channel 4. The band also composed and performed the theme tune for the programme, later released as a single B-side. The band played two songs with the American singer Rickie Lee Jones (who had recently befriended the band and had become one of its biggest supporters), performing her own &quot;Flying Cowboys&quot; and the Blue Nile&#x27;s &quot;Easter Parade&quot;. The duet version of &quot;Easter Parade&quot; was used as the B-side of both Jones&#x27;s 1990 single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Crying&quot;, and the 12&quot; single of &quot;Headlights on the Parade&quot;. During 1990, the Blue Nile supported Jones on her US tour (their experience in America was filmed by BBC Scotland for a documentary titled &quot;Flags and Fences&quot;), followed by a tour of the UK culminating in two homecoming gigs in September 1990 at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, becoming the first non-classical band to play at the newly opened venue.

===&quot;Peace at Last&quot; (1991–1996)===
The radio play gained by &quot;Hats&quot; in the US, in particular the single &quot;The Downtown Lights&quot;, brought the Blue Nile to the attention of several well-known US-based musicians. In 1991, the band was invited to Los Angeles to work on songs by Julian Lennon, Robbie Robertson and Michael McDonald. As a result, Buchanan moved to Los Angeles and lived there for a while, and had a relationship with the actress Rosanna Arquette between 1991 and 1993. Speaking about that period of his life Buchanan said, &quot;It really was interesting. I have to say it was lived in all earnest ... And there was much good there, I enjoyed it, I really enjoyed it ... The great thing all the time was you were constantly wanting to phone friends and say, Guess who&#x27;s in the shop? Guess who&#x27;s in the supermarket? I&#x27;m not immune to all that. In the movies—celluloid&#x27;s better than life isn&#x27;t it? It makes everything glossy. I don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s better, but it&#x27;s so glamorous, I met lots of people—it was fascinating.&quot; The band also worked on Annie Lennox&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Diva&quot;, co-writing the track &quot;The Gift&quot;. Lennox later covered &quot;The Downtown Lights&quot; (from &quot;Hats&quot;) for her second album, &quot;Medusa&quot;, released in 1995.

Having been let go by Linn and Virgin Records, the group signed a deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1992, although it later transpired that Buchanan had made the deal by himself without informing his bandmates. His explanation was that &quot;none of the others were in town at the time&quot;. The band decided that it wanted to find somewhere private to record its new album with its portable studio, and began travelling around Europe searching for suitable locations. Having spent two years looking at and dismissing locations in cities such as Venice, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, the record was finally recorded piecemeal over three locations in Paris, Dublin and Los Angeles.

In June 1996, seven years after &quot;Hats&quot;, the Blue Nile released a third album, entitled &quot;Peace at Last&quot;. It displayed a marked difference in style to the first two albums, with Buchanan&#x27;s acoustic guitar work more to the fore. Buchanan recalled that he had bought the guitar in a New York music shop, and by coincidence Robert Bell had seen the guitar earlier the same day and called Buchanan to tell him about it. A gospel choir made a brief appearance on the first single, &quot;Happiness&quot;. Despite the release of &quot;Peace at Last&quot; on a major label, critical reaction to the album was more mixed than for the band&#x27;s previous records, although sales were good, entering the UK album chart at #13.

===&quot;High&quot; (1997–2004)===
In 1997, the Blue Nile appointed a full-time manager for the first time - the experienced ex-Dire Straits manager, Ed Bicknell - who extricated the group from the deal with Warner Bros. He also attempted to persuade the band to change its recording habits, but had little success. Bicknell parted ways with the band in 2004, later saying that &quot;in terms of the modern recording world the history of the Blue Nile was the most screwed-up I had ever encountered&quot;. Following tour dates in 1996 and 1997, culminating in an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in June 1997, the Blue Nile disappeared from public view for the next seven years, apart from an appearance at a 2001 tribute concert at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin for the Irish music presenter Uaneen Fitzsimons, following her death in a car crash. A remixed version of the single &quot;Tinseltown in the Rain&quot; was used as the theme song for the BBC Scotland TV series &quot;Tinsel Town&quot;, broadcast in 2000 and 2001.

After the longest period yet between albums, the Blue Nile released &quot;High&quot; in August 2004. Part of the lengthy delay in making the record was due to Buchanan contracting a form of chronic fatigue syndrome which affected his health for two years, but as he explained on the album&#x27;s release, it was mostly a result of the band&#x27;s perfectionism taking hold once again, &quot;We recorded an album and a half and ... we realised we weren&#x27;t in love with it ... The vast majority of it we just dumped; we just put it to one side and didn&#x27;t touch it any more.&quot; The album reached number 10 on the UK Albums Chart, the highest position to date for the band. Although acoustic guitar is still present on some tracks, the overall musical sound is more reminiscent of &quot;Hats&quot;.

===The Blue Nile dissolves (2005)===
It became apparent during the recording of &quot;High&quot; that old tensions among the band members had resurfaced. Buchanan&#x27;s comments in a 2012 interview seemed to indicate that the album was finished out of a sense of duty and loyalty rather than any willingness to do so. &quot;When we eventually finished &quot;High&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it was bristling with the same joy and naivety we&#x27;d felt when we started. We&#x27;d gathered ourselves long enough to make it. It seemed to me a stoic record, to some extent a record about ourselves, though I didn&#x27;t realise that &#x27;til later. It was a collected and fairly stoic record which I was proud of and, in a sense, we just made ourselves focus. We showed up, we went into the room and worked, and whatever drift had set in we were loyal to each other and we knew we had to form the wagons into a circle.&quot;

During preparations for the tour in February 2005 following the album&#x27;s release, Buchanan and Bell realised that Moore had stopped contacting them and would not be showing up for the tour. Although there was never an official statement to clarify whether or not the Blue Nile still existed or not, this was effectively the point when the band split up, and the last time that any of the members operated under the straightforward Blue Nile banner. 

In a 2006 interview, Buchanan insisted that he had remained friends with Moore. In another interview seven years later (in 2013), he acknowledged that he and Bell had, in fact, had virtually no contact with Moore since the recording of &quot;High&quot;. Buchanan has apparently not given up hope that the three members of the Blue Nile may make more music together in the future, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t know where things stand with the other two guys ... In a way, I think it would be the right and proper thing to do but I&#x27;ll just need to wait and see. If the others say let&#x27;s do this ... Certainly, if I bump into them on a corner my hope would be that we could say: so what are you doing tomorrow?&quot; He also lamented the estrangement with Moore, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re inhibited by the Scottish male thing where you have to give the other guy space, but I love PJ and there isn&#x27;t a month goes by where I don&#x27;t think about phoning him&quot;.

For his part, Moore has stated emphatically on several occasions that he will never rejoin the band, saying in communications sent in 2010 to the band&#x27;s biographer that he was &quot;finding it healthier to put all that behind me&quot;, and in a 2013 interview his terse reply to the question of a reunion was, &quot;I think stuff happened that was simply beyond the pale. It&#x27;s a shame, but if the feeling for sitting down together really isn&#x27;t there, then continuing to do so even because you want to is pointless.&quot; In a 2022 interview with the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Moore mentioned that the three former members of The Blue Nile do occasionally encounter each other, but stated that a Blue Nile reunion was &quot;just not going to happen... It&#x27;s like a marriage. When the marriage comes to an end, neither person wants to get back together or even think about getting back together. There were three of us in this marriage and the sex was rubbish!&quot; He did, however, also state that he thought that &quot;all of us are proud of the work that we did. We poured all of ourselves into [the records]. You can&#x27;t ask much more than that.&quot;

===Post-Blue Nile activity (2006-present)===

Paul Buchanan and Robert Bell toured England and Scotland in May and June 2006, followed by Scotland and Ireland in November 2006, billed as &quot;Paul Buchanan sings the songs of the Blue Nile&quot;, refraining from simply calling themselves the Blue Nile as a mark of respect for Moore&#x27;s absence. The band consisted of Buchanan on vocals and guitar, Bell on bass guitar and keyboards, Alan Cuthbertson and Brendan Smith on keyboards, Stuart McCredie on guitar, and Liam Bradley on drums. On 14 July 2007, Buchanan and Bell played at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester as part of the Manchester International Festival. In July 2008, the band played shows at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, Somerset House in London and the Radisson Hotel in Galway.

In September 2010, a biography of the Blue Nile by the Scottish journalist Allan Brown, titled &quot;Nileism: The Strange Course of the Blue Nile&quot;, was published. Although Brown was a long-time acquaintance of Buchanan, he found Buchanan reluctant to participate, and both Bell and Moore refused Brown&#x27;s invitations for interviews or any co-operation with the book&#x27;s writing.

In May 2012, Buchanan released his first (and, to date, only) solo album, &quot;Mid Air&quot;, a collection of short, stripped-back songs mostly with just Buchanan&#x27;s voice and piano, recorded with Calum Malcolm&#x27;s son Cameron as the album&#x27;s engineer and released on Buchanan&#x27;s own Newsroom Records label. In a radio interview, Buchanan mentioned that towards the end of the recording process he had called in Robert Bell to help out on two tracks (&quot;Mid Air&quot; and &quot;My True Country&quot;) that neither he nor Cameron Malcolm were satisfied with. Bell also later remixed &quot;Buy a Motor Car&quot;, which appeared on the deluxe edition of the album released in October 2012. The album peaked at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart of 2 June 2012, and its title track, &quot;Mid Air&quot;, was used a year later in the Richard Curtis film, &quot;About Time&quot;.

In November 2012, Virgin Records released two-CD &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; versions of the band&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;A Walk Across the Rooftops&quot; and &quot;Hats&quot;. Each version had the original album remastered by engineer Calum Malcolm, along with a bonus disc of rare and previously unreleased material selected by Buchanan and Bell. A similar reissue of the third album, &quot;Peace at Last&quot;, was released on 3 March 2014.

In July 2016, Buchanan took part in the David Bowie Prom at the Royal Albert Hall. His performance of Bowie&#x27;s &quot;I Can&#x27;t Give Everything Away&quot; was praised by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

In 2019, the band&#x27;s major label albums were re-issued on vinyl, with a re-issue of &quot;High&quot; charting at number 74 in the UK charts after being released by Confetti Records on 5 June 2020 as vinyl or double CD edition.

In 2006 PJ Moore befriended Scottish composer/producer Malcolm Lindsay, eventually leading to his writing the libretto for Lindsay&#x27;s 2018 operatic score for Oscar van Heek&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Dark Water&quot;. This in turn led to the creation in 2020 of a new band, PJ Moore &amp; Co., consisting of Moore, Lindsay and singer Mike McKenzie (winner of BBC Radio Scotland’s Singer-Songwriter of the Year in 2019). On 22 September 2022, PJ Moore and Co. released their debut album, &quot;When a Good Day Comes&quot; on Mozie Records.

== Legacy ==
The band has influenced future musicians such as Duncan Sheik, who covered the song &quot;Stay&quot;, as well as Wild Beasts. 

Matty Healy, the 1975&#x27;s lead singer and primary songwriter, labeled the Blue Nile his &quot;favourite band of all time&quot; and declared &quot;Hats&quot; to be his &quot;favourite record of the &#x27;80s.&quot; Healy would describe the 1975&#x27;s 2018 song &quot;Love It If We Made It&quot; as the &quot;Blue Nile on steroids&quot; and told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that &quot;I wanted to reference &#x27;The Downtown Lights&#x27;; I didn&#x27;t want to hide away from referencing it. I wanted it to be fucking obvious to people that know.&quot; Taylor Swift, who had previously been in a relationship with Healy, referenced the band in her 2024 song &quot;Guilty as Sin?&quot; with the opening lyrics &quot;Drowning in the Blue Nile, he sent me &#x27;Downtown Lights&#x27;, I hadn&#x27;t heard it in a while.&quot; Streams for &quot;The Downtown Lights&quot; rose 1,400% in the four-day period following the release of Swift&#x27;s album. Ten days after the album&#x27;s release, the vinyl stock of all four of the Blue Nile&#x27;s albums were sold out on their website.

<text>Io (), or Jupiter I, is the innermost and second-smallest of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter. Slightly larger than Earth&#x27;s moon, Io is the fourth-largest moon in the Solar System, has the highest density of any moon, the strongest surface gravity of any moon, and the lowest amount of water by atomic ratio of any known astronomical object in the Solar System. It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after the mythological character Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus&#x27;s lovers.

With over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System. This extreme geologic activity is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within Io&#x27;s interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean moons—Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Several volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as above the surface. Io&#x27;s surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of Io&#x27;s silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller than Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth&#x27;s surface. Unlike most moons in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of water ice, Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core. Most of Io&#x27;s surface is composed of extensive plains with a frosty coating of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.

Io&#x27;s volcanism is responsible for many of its unique features. Its volcanic plumes and lava flows produce large surface changes and paint the surface in various subtle shades of yellow, red, white, black, and green, largely due to allotropes and compounds of sulfur. Numerous extensive lava flows, several more than in length, also mark the surface. The materials produced by this volcanism make up Io&#x27;s thin, patchy atmosphere, and they also greatly affect the nature and radiation levels of Jupiter&#x27;s extensive magnetosphere. Io&#x27;s volcanic ejecta also produce a large, intense plasma torus around Jupiter, creating a hostile radiation environment on and around the moon.

Io played a significant role in the development of astronomy in the 17th and 18th centuries; discovered in January 1610 by Galileo Galilei, along with the other Galilean satellites, this discovery furthered the adoption of the Copernican model of the Solar System, the development of Kepler&#x27;s laws of motion, and the first measurement of the speed of light. In 1979, the two &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft revealed Io to be a geologically active world, with numerous volcanic features, large mountains, and a young surface with no obvious impact craters. The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft performed several close flybys in the 1990s and early 2000s, obtaining data about Io&#x27;s interior structure and surface composition. These spacecraft also revealed the relationship between Io and Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere and the existence of a belt of high-energy radiation centered on Io&#x27;s orbit. Further observations have been made by &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; in 2000, &quot;New Horizons&quot; in 2007, and &quot;Juno&quot; since 2017, as well as from Earth-based telescopes and the Hubble Space Telescope.

==Nomenclature==


Although Simon Marius is not credited with the sole discovery of the Galilean satellites, his names for the moons were adopted. In his 1614 publication &quot;Mundus Iovialis anno M.DC.IX Detectus Ope Perspicilli Belgici&quot;, he proposed several alternative names for the innermost of the large moons of Jupiter, including &quot;The Mercury of Jupiter&quot; and &quot;The First of the Jovian Planets&quot;. Based on a suggestion from Johannes Kepler in October 1613, he also devised a naming scheme whereby each moon was named for a lover of the Greek god Zeus or his Roman equivalent, Jupiter. He named the innermost large moon of Jupiter after the Greek Io:

Marius&#x27;s names were not widely adopted until centuries later (mid-20th century). In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Io was generally referred to by its Roman numeral designation (a system introduced by Galileo) as &quot;&quot;, or as &quot;the first satellite of Jupiter&quot;.

The customary English pronunciation of the name is , though sometimes people attempt a more &#x27;authentic&#x27; pronunciation, . The name has two competing stems in Latin: &quot;Īō&quot; and (rarely) &quot;Īōn&quot;. The latter is the basis of the English adjectival form, &quot;Ionian.&quot;

Features on Io are named after characters and places from the Io myth, as well as deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, and thunder from various myths, and characters and places from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;: names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, the International Astronomical Union has approved 249 names for Io&#x27;s volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include &quot;patera&quot; (&#x27;saucer&#x27;; volcanic depression), &quot;fluctus&quot; (&#x27;flow&#x27;; lava flow), &quot;vallis&quot; (&#x27;valley&#x27;; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was the first sign of volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, plateaus, layered terrain, and shield volcanoes include the terms &quot;mons&quot;, &quot;mensa&quot; (&#x27;table&#x27;), &quot;planum&quot;, and &quot;tholus&quot; (&#x27;rotunda&#x27;), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term &quot;regio&quot;. Examples of named features are Prometheus, Pan Mensa, Tvashtar Paterae, and Tsũi Goab Fluctus.
==Observational history==
The first reported observation of Io was made by Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20x-power, refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low power of his telescope, so the two were recorded as a single point of light. Io and Europa were seen for the first time as separate bodies during Galileo&#x27;s observations of the Jovian system the following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Io by the IAU). The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; in March 1610. In his &quot;Mundus Jovialis&quot;, published in 1614, Simon Marius claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in 1609, one week before Galileo&#x27;s discovery. Galileo doubted this claim and dismissed the work of Marius as plagiarism. Regardless, Marius&#x27;s first recorded observation came from 29 December 1609 in the Julian calendar, which equates to 8 January 1610 in the Gregorian calendar, which Galileo used. Given that Galileo published his work before Marius, Galileo is credited with the discovery.

For the next two and a half centuries, Io remained an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers&#x27; telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler&#x27;s third law of planetary motion, and determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede. This resonance was later found to have a profound effect on the geologies of the three moons.

Improved telescope technology in the late 19th and 20th centuries allowed astronomers to resolve (that is, see as distinct objects) large-scale surface features on Io. In the 1890s, Edward E. Barnard was the first to observe variations in Io&#x27;s brightness between its equatorial and polar regions, correctly determining that this was due to differences in color and albedo between the two regions and not due to Io being egg-shaped, as proposed at the time by fellow astronomer William Pickering, or two separate objects, as initially proposed by Barnard. Later telescopic observations confirmed Io&#x27;s distinct reddish-brown polar regions and yellow-white equatorial band.

Telescopic observations in the mid-20th century began to hint at Io&#x27;s unusual nature. Spectroscopic observations suggested that Io&#x27;s surface was devoid of water ice (a substance found to be plentiful on the other Galilean satellites). The same observations suggested a surface dominated by evaporates composed of sodium salts and sulfur. Radiotelescopic observations revealed Io&#x27;s influence on the Jovian magnetosphere, as demonstrated by decametric wavelength bursts tied to the orbital period of Io.

===&quot;Pioneer&quot;===
The first spacecraft to pass by Io were the &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;11&quot; probes on 3 December 1973 and 2 December 1974, respectively. Radio tracking provided an improved estimate of Io&#x27;s mass, which, along with the best available information of its size, suggested it had the highest density of the Galilean satellites, and was composed primarily of silicate rock rather than water ice. The &quot;Pioneer&quot;s also revealed the presence of a thin atmosphere and intense radiation belts near the orbit of Io. The camera on board &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; took the only good image of the moon obtained by either spacecraft, showing its north polar region and its yellow tint. Close-up images were planned during &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;″s encounter, but those were lost because of the high-radiation environment.

===&quot;Voyager&quot;===

When the twin probes &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed by Io in 1979, their more advanced imaging systems allowed for far more detailed images. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; flew past Io on 5 March 1979 from a distance of . The images returned during the approach revealed a strange, multi-colored landscape devoid of impact craters. The highest-resolution images showed a relatively young surface punctuated by oddly shaped pits, mountains taller than Mount Everest, and features resembling volcanic lava flows.

Shortly after the encounter, &quot;Voyager&quot; navigation engineer Linda A. Morabito noticed a plume emanating from the surface in one of the images. Analysis of other &quot;Voyager 1&quot; images showed nine such plumes scattered across the surface, proving that Io was volcanically active. This conclusion was predicted in a paper published shortly before the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; encounter by Stan Peale, Patrick Cassen, and R. T. Reynolds. The authors calculated that Io&#x27;s interior must experience significant tidal heating caused by its orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede (see the &quot;Tidal heating&quot; section for a more detailed explanation of the process). Data from this flyby showed that the surface of Io is dominated by sulfur and sulfur dioxide frosts. These compounds also dominate its thin atmosphere and the torus of plasma centered on Io&#x27;s orbit (also discovered by &quot;Voyager&quot;).

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed Io on 9 July 1979 at a distance of . Though it did not approach nearly as close as &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, comparisons between images taken by the two spacecraft showed several surface changes that had occurred in the four months between the encounters. In addition, observations of Io as a crescent as &quot;Voyager 2&quot; departed the Jovian system revealed that seven of the nine plumes observed in March were still active in July 1979, with only the volcano Pele shutting down between flybys.

===&quot;Galileo&quot;===
The &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft arrived at Jupiter in 1995 after a six-year journey from Earth to follow up on the discoveries of the two &quot;Voyager&quot; probes and the ground-based observations made in the intervening years. Io&#x27;s location within one of Jupiter&#x27;s most intense radiation belts precluded a prolonged close flyby, but &quot;Galileo&quot; did pass close by shortly before entering orbit for its two-year, primary mission studying the Jovian system. Although no images were taken during the close flyby on 7 December 1995, the encounter did yield significant results, such as the discovery of a large iron core, similar to that found on the rocky planets of the inner Solar System.

Despite the lack of close-up imaging and mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries were made during &quot;Galileo&quot; primary mission. &quot;Galileo&quot; observed the effects of a major eruption at Pillan Patera and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions. Distant imaging of Io was acquired for almost every orbit during the primary mission, revealing large numbers of active volcanoes (both thermal emission from cooling magma on the surface and volcanic plumes), numerous mountains with widely varying morphologies, and several surface changes that had taken place both between the &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; eras and between &quot;Galileo&quot; orbits.

The &quot;Galileo&quot; mission was twice extended, in 1997 and 2000. During these extended missions, the probe flew by Io three times in late 1999 and early 2000, and three times in late 2001 and early 2002. Observations during these encounters revealed the geologic processes occurring at Io&#x27;s volcanoes and mountains, excluded the presence of a magnetic field, and demonstrated the extent of volcanic activity.

===&quot;Cassini&quot;===

In December 2000, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft had a distant and brief encounter with the Jovian system en route to Saturn, allowing for joint observations with &quot;Galileo&quot;. These observations revealed a new plume at Tvashtar Paterae and provided insights into Io&#x27;s aurorae.

===&quot;New Horizons&quot;===
The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, en route to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, flew by the Jovian system and Io on 28 February 2007. During the encounter, numerous distant observations of Io were obtained. These included images of a large plume at Tvashtar, providing the first detailed observations of the largest class of Ionian volcanic plume since observations of Pele&#x27;s plume in 1979. &quot;New Horizons&quot; also captured images of a volcano near &quot;Girru Patera&quot; in the early stages of an eruption, and several volcanic eruptions that have occurred since &quot;Galileo&quot;.

===&quot;Juno&quot;===

The &quot;Juno&quot; spacecraft was launched in 2011 and entered orbit around Jupiter on 5 July 2016. &quot;Juno&quot;″s mission is primarily focused on improving our understanding of Jupiter&#x27;s interior, magnetic field, aurorae, and polar atmosphere. &quot;Juno&quot;″s 54-day orbit is highly inclined and highly eccentric in order to better characterize Jupiter&#x27;s polar regions and to limit its exposure to the planet&#x27;s harsh inner radiation belts, limiting close encounters with Jupiter&#x27;s moons. The closest approach to Io during the initial, prime mission occurred in February 2020 at a distance of 195,000 kilomters. Juno&#x27;s extended mission, begun in June 2021, allowed for closer encounters with Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean satellites due to &quot;Juno&quot;″s orbital precession. After a series of increasingly closer encounters with Io in 2022 and 2023, &quot;Juno&quot; performed a pair of close flybys on 30 December 2023, and 3 February 2024, both with altitudes of 1,500 kilometers. The primary goal of these encounters were to improve our understanding of Io&#x27;s gravity field using doppler tracking and to image Io&#x27;s surface to look for surface changes since Io was last seen up-close in 2007.

During several orbits, &quot;Juno&quot; has observed Io from a distance using JunoCam, a wide-angle, visible-light camera, to look for volcanic plumes and JIRAM, a near-infrared spectrometer and imager, to monitor thermal emission from Io&#x27;s volcanoes. JIRAM near-infrared spectroscopy has so far allowed for the coarse mapping of sulfur dioxide frost across Io&#x27;s surface as well as mapping minor surface components weakly absorbing sunlight at 2.1 and 2.65 μm.

===Future missions===
There are two forthcoming missions planned for the Jovian system. The Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a planned European Space Agency mission to the Jovian system that is intended to end up in Ganymede orbit. JUICE launched in April 2023, with arrival at Jupiter planned for July 2031. JUICE will not fly by Io, but it will use its instruments, such as a narrow-angle camera, to monitor Io&#x27;s volcanic activity and measure its surface composition during the two-year Jupiter-tour phase of the mission prior to Ganymede orbit insertion. Europa Clipper is a planned NASA mission to the Jovian system focused on Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa. Like JUICE, Europa Clipper will not perform any flybys of Io, but distant volcano monitoring is likely. &quot;Europa Clipper&quot; launched in October 2024, with an arrival at Jupiter in 2030.

The &quot;Io Volcano Observer&quot; (IVO) was a proposal to NASA for a low-cost, Discovery-class mission selected for a Phase A study along with three other missions in 2020. IVO would launch in January 2029 and perform ten flybys of Io while in orbit around Jupiter beginning in the early 2030s. However, the Venus missions DAVINCI+ and VERITAS were selected in favor of those.

==Orbit and rotation==
Io orbits Jupiter at a distance of from Jupiter&#x27;s center and from its cloudtops. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, its orbit lying between those of Thebe and Europa. Including Jupiter&#x27;s inner satellites, Io is the fifth moon out from Jupiter. It takes Io about 42.5 hours (1.77 days) to complete one orbit around Jupiter (fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation). Io is in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Europa and a 4:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Ganymede, completing two orbits of Jupiter for every one orbit completed by Europa, and four orbits for every one completed by Ganymede. This resonance helps maintain Io&#x27;s orbital eccentricity (0.0041), which in turn provides the primary heating source for its geologic activity. Without this forced eccentricity, Io&#x27;s orbit would circularize through tidal dissipation, leading to a less geologically active world.

Like the other Galilean satellites and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchrony provides the definition for Io&#x27;s longitude system. Io&#x27;s prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter is known as the subjovian hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces away is known as the antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, whereas the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.

From the surface of Io, Jupiter would subtend an arc of 19.5°, making Jupiter appear 39 times the apparent diameter of Earth&#x27;s Moon.

==Interaction with Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere==

Io plays a significant role in shaping Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes, releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than twice the size it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io&#x27;s thin atmosphere at a rate of 1 tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of ionized and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. These materials originate from Io&#x27;s volcanic activity, with the material that escapes to Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field and into interplanetary space coming directly from Io&#x27;s atmosphere. These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.
Surrounding Io (at a distance of up to six Io radii from its surface) is a cloud of neutral sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and potassium atoms. These particles originate in Io&#x27;s upper atmosphere and are excited by collisions with ions in the plasma torus (discussed below) and by other processes into filling Io&#x27;s Hill sphere, which is the region where Io&#x27;s gravity is dominant over Jupiter&#x27;s. Some of this material escapes Io&#x27;s gravitational pull and goes into orbit around Jupiter. Over a 20-hour period, these particles spread out from Io to form a banana-shaped, neutral cloud that can reach as far as six Jovian radii from Io, either inside Io&#x27;s orbit and ahead of it or outside Io&#x27;s orbit and behind it. The collision process that excites these particles also occasionally provides sodium ions in the plasma torus with an electron, removing those new &quot;fast&quot; neutrals from the torus. These particles retain their velocity (70 km/s, compared to the 17 km/s orbital velocity at Io), and are thus ejected in jets leading away from Io.

Io orbits within a belt of intense radiation known as the Io plasma torus. The plasma in this doughnut-shaped ring of ionized sulfur, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine originates when neutral atoms in the &quot;cloud&quot; surrounding Io are ionized and carried along by the Jovian magnetosphere. Unlike the particles in the neutral cloud, these particles co-rotate with Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, revolving around Jupiter at 74 km/s. Like the rest of Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field, the plasma torus is tilted with respect to Jupiter&#x27;s equator (and Io&#x27;s orbital plane), so that Io is at times below and at other times above the core of the plasma torus. As noted above, these ions&#x27; higher velocity and energy levels are partly responsible for the removal of neutral atoms and molecules from Io&#x27;s atmosphere and more extended neutral clouds. The torus is composed of three sections: an outer, &quot;warm&quot; torus that resides just outside Io&#x27;s orbit; a vertically extended region known as the &quot;ribbon&quot;, composed of the neutral source region and cooling plasma, located at around Io&#x27;s distance from Jupiter; and an inner, &quot;cold&quot; torus, composed of particles that are slowly spiraling in toward Jupiter. After residing an average of 40 days in the torus, particles in the &quot;warm&quot; torus escape and are partially responsible for Jupiter&#x27;s unusually large magnetosphere, their outward pressure inflating it from within. Particles from Io, detected as variations in magnetospheric plasma, have been detected far into the long magnetotail by &quot;New Horizons&quot;. To study similar variations within the plasma torus, researchers measured the ultraviolet light it emits. Although such variations have not been definitively linked to variations in Io&#x27;s volcanic activity (the ultimate source for material in the plasma torus), this link has been established in the neutral sodium cloud.

During an encounter with Jupiter in 1992, the &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometers per second, has an average particle size of 10 μm, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by &quot;Galileo&quot; showed that these dust streams originated on Io, but exactly how these form, whether from Io&#x27;s volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.

Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field, which Io crosses, couples Io&#x27;s atmosphere and neutral cloud to Jupiter&#x27;s polar upper atmosphere by generating an electric current known as the Io flux tube. This current produces an auroral glow in Jupiter&#x27;s polar regions known as the Io footprint, as well as aurorae in Io&#x27;s atmosphere. Particles from this auroral interaction darken the Jovian polar regions at visible wavelengths. The location of Io and its auroral footprint with respect to Earth and Jupiter has a strong influence on Jovian radio emissions from our vantage point: when Io is visible, radio signals from Jupiter increase considerably. The &quot;Juno&quot; mission, currently in orbit around Jupiter, should help shed light on these processes. The Jovian magnetic field lines that do get past Io&#x27;s ionosphere also induce an electric current, which in turn creates an induced magnetic field within Io&#x27;s interior. Io&#x27;s induced magnetic field is thought to be generated within a partially molten, silicate magma ocean 50 kilometers beneath Io&#x27;s surface. Similar induced fields were found at the other Galilean satellites by &quot;Galileo&quot;, possibly generated within liquid water oceans in the interiors of those moons.

According to an international study published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in 2024, no magma ocean would exist on the satellite Io despite the large number of volcanoes and the tidal interaction with Jupiter, as historical data from the mission Galileo probe suggested. The scientists used data from two recent overflights by the Juno probe and claimed that an &quot;almost&quot; solid mantle exists beneath Io&#x27;s surface and not an ocean of magma as previously thought.

==Geology==

Io is slightly larger than Earth&#x27;s Moon. It has a mean radius of (about 5% greater than the Moon&#x27;s) and a mass of 8.9319 kg (about 21% greater than the Moon&#x27;s). It is a slight ellipsoid in shape, with its longest axis directed toward Jupiter. Among the Galilean satellites, in both mass and volume, Io ranks behind Ganymede and Callisto but ahead of Europa.

===Interior===

Composed primarily of silicate rock and iron, Io and Europa are closer in bulk composition to terrestrial planets than to other satellites in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of a mix of water ice and silicates. Io has a density of , the highest of any regular moon in the Solar System; significantly higher than the other Galilean satellites (Ganymede and Callisto in particular, whose densities are around ) and slightly higher (~5.5%) than the Moon&#x27;s and Europa&#x27;s . Models based on the &quot;Voyager&quot; and &quot;Galileo&quot; measurements of Io&#x27;s mass, radius, and quadrupole gravitational coefficients (numerical values related to how mass is distributed within an object) suggest that its interior is differentiated between a silicate-rich crust and mantle and an iron- or iron-sulfide-rich core. Io&#x27;s metallic core makes up approximately 20% of its mass. Depending on the amount of sulfur in the core, the core has a radius between if it is composed almost entirely of iron, or between for a core consisting of a mix of iron and sulfur. &quot;Galileo&quot; magnetometer failed to detect an internal, intrinsic magnetic field at Io, suggesting that the core is not convecting.

Modeling of Io&#x27;s interior composition suggests that the mantle is composed of at least 75% of the magnesium-rich mineral forsterite, and has a bulk composition similar to that of L-chondrite and LL-chondrite meteorites, with higher iron content (compared to silicon) than the Moon or Earth, but lower than Mars. To support the heat flow observed on Io, 10–20% of Io&#x27;s mantle may be molten, though regions where high-temperature volcanism has been observed may have higher melt fractions. However, re-analysis of &quot;Galileo&quot; magnetometer data in 2009 revealed the presence of an induced magnetic field at Io, requiring a magma ocean below the surface. Further analysis published in 2011 provided direct evidence of such an ocean. This layer is estimated to be 50 km thick and to make up about 10% of Io&#x27;s mantle. It is estimated that the temperature in the magma ocean reaches 1,200 °C. It is not known if the 10–20% partial melting percentage for Io&#x27;s mantle is consistent with the requirement for a significant amount of molten silicates in this possible magma ocean. The lithosphere of Io, composed of basalt and sulfur deposited by Io&#x27;s extensive volcanism, is at least thick, and likely less than thick.

===Tidal heating===

Unlike Earth and the Moon, Io&#x27;s main source of internal heat comes from tidal dissipation rather than radioactive isotope decay, the result of Io&#x27;s orbital resonance with Europa and Ganymede. Such heating is dependent on Io&#x27;s distance from Jupiter, its orbital eccentricity, the composition of its interior, and its physical state. Its Laplace resonance with Europa and Ganymede maintains Io&#x27;s eccentricity and prevents tidal dissipation within Io from circularizing its orbit. The resonant orbit also helps to maintain Io&#x27;s distance from Jupiter; otherwise tides raised on Jupiter would cause Io to slowly spiral outward from its parent planet. The tidal forces experienced by Io are about 20,000 times stronger than the tidal forces Earth experiences due to the Moon, and the vertical differences in its tidal bulge, between the times Io is at periapsis and apoapsis in its orbit, could be as much as . The friction or tidal dissipation produced in Io&#x27;s interior due to this varying tidal pull, which, without the resonant orbit, would have gone into circularizing Io&#x27;s orbit instead, creates significant tidal heating within Io&#x27;s interior, melting a significant amount of Io&#x27;s mantle and core. The amount of energy produced is up to 200 times greater than that produced solely from radioactive decay. This heat is released in the form of volcanic activity, generating its observed high heat flow (global total: 0.6 to 1.6×1014 W). Models of its orbit suggest that the amount of tidal heating within Io changes with time; however, the current amount of tidal dissipation is consistent with the observed heat flow. Models of tidal heating and convection have not found consistent planetary viscosity profiles that simultaneously match tidal energy dissipation and mantle convection of heat to the surface.

Although there is general agreement that the origin of the heat as manifested in Io&#x27;s many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler &quot;et al.&quot; (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study&#x27;s authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.

Other moons in the Solar System are also tidally heated, and they too may generate additional heat through the friction of subsurface magma or water oceans. This ability to generate heat in a subsurface ocean increases the chance of life on bodies like Europa and Enceladus.

===Surface===
Based on their experience with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in &quot;Voyager 1&quot; first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io&#x27;s surface would have given clues to Io&#x27;s age. However, they were surprised to discover that the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io&#x27;s surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io&#x27;s surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;.

====Surface composition====
Io&#x27;s colorful appearance is the result of materials deposited by its extensive volcanism, including silicates (such as orthopyroxene), sulfur, and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide frost is ubiquitous across the surface of Io, forming large regions covered in white or grey materials. Sulfur is also seen in many places across Io, forming yellow to yellow-green regions. Sulfur deposited in the mid-latitude and polar regions is often damaged by radiation, breaking up the normally stable cyclic 8-chain sulfur. This radiation damage produces Io&#x27;s red-brown polar regions.

Explosive volcanism, often taking the form of umbrella-shaped plumes, paints the surface with sulfurous and silicate materials. Plume deposits on Io are often colored red or white depending on the amount of sulfur and sulfur dioxide in the plume. Generally, plumes formed at volcanic vents from degassing lava contain a greater amount of , producing a red &quot;fan&quot; deposit, or in extreme cases, large (often reaching beyond from the central vent) red rings. A prominent example of a red-ring plume deposit is located at Pele. These red deposits consist primarily of sulfur (generally 3- and 4-chain molecular sulfur), sulfur dioxide, and perhaps sulfuryl chloride. Plumes formed at the margins of silicate lava flows (through the interaction of lava and pre-existing deposits of sulfur and sulfur dioxide) produce white or gray deposits.

Compositional mapping and Io&#x27;s high density suggest that Io contains little to no water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has the least amount of water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early in the evolution of the Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.
====Volcanism====

The tidal heating produced by Io&#x27;s forced orbital eccentricity has made it the most volcanically active world in the Solar System, with hundreds of volcanic centers and extensive lava flows. During a major eruption, lava flows tens or even hundreds of kilometers long can be produced, consisting mostly of basalt silicate lavas with either mafic or ultramafic (magnesium-rich) compositions. As a by-product of this activity, sulfur, sulfur dioxide gas and silicate pyroclastic material (like ash) are blown up to into space, producing large, umbrella-shaped plumes, painting the surrounding terrain in red, black, and white, and providing material for Io&#x27;s patchy atmosphere and Jupiter&#x27;s extensive magnetosphere.

Io&#x27;s surface is dotted with volcanic depressions known as &quot;paterae&quot; which generally have flat floors bounded by steep walls. These features resemble terrestrial calderas, but it is unknown if they are produced through collapse over an emptied lava chamber like their terrestrial cousins. One hypothesis suggests that these features are produced through the exhumation of volcanic sills, and the overlying material is either blasted out or integrated into the sill. Examples of paterae in various stages of exhumation have been mapped using &quot;Galileo&quot; images of the Chaac-Camaxtli region. Unlike similar features on Earth and Mars, these depressions generally do not lie at the peak of shield volcanoes and are normally larger, with an average diameter of , the largest being Loki Patera at . Loki is also consistently the strongest volcano on Io, contributing on average 25% of Io&#x27;s global heat output. Whatever the formation mechanism, the morphology and distribution of many paterae suggest that these features are structurally controlled, with at least half bounded by faults or mountains. These features are often the site of volcanic eruptions, either from lava flows spreading across the floors of the paterae, as at an eruption at Gish Bar Patera in 2001, or in the form of a lava lake. Lava lakes on Io either have a continuously overturning lava crust, such as at Pele, or an episodically overturning crust, such as at Loki.
Lava flows represent another major volcanic terrain on Io. Magma erupts onto the surface from vents on the floor of paterae or on the plains from fissures, producing inflated, compound lava flows similar to those seen at Kilauea in Hawaii. Images from the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft revealed that many of Io&#x27;s major lava flows, like those at Prometheus and Amirani, are produced by the build-up of small breakouts of lava flows on top of older flows. Larger outbreaks of lava have also been observed on Io. For example, the leading edge of the Prometheus flow moved between &quot;Voyager&quot; in 1979 and the first &quot;Galileo&quot; observations in 1996. A major eruption in 1997 produced more than of fresh lava and flooded the floor of the adjacent Pillan Patera.

Analysis of the &quot;Voyager&quot; images led scientists to believe that these flows were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur. However, subsequent Earth-based infrared studies and measurements from the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic compositions. This hypothesis is based on temperature measurements of Io&#x27;s &quot;hotspots&quot;, or thermal-emission locations, which suggest temperatures of at least 1,300 K and some as high as 1,600 K. Initial estimates suggesting eruption temperatures approaching 2,000 K have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to model the temperatures.
The discovery of plumes at the volcanoes Pele and Loki were the first sign that Io is geologically active. Generally, these plumes are formed when volatiles like sulfur and sulfur dioxide are ejected skyward from Io&#x27;s volcanoes at speeds reaching , creating umbrella-shaped clouds of gas and dust. Additional material that might be found in these volcanic plumes include sodium, potassium, and chlorine. These plumes appear to be formed in one of two ways. Io&#x27;s largest plumes, such as those emitted by Pele, are created when dissolved sulfur and sulfur dioxide gas are released from erupting magma at volcanic vents or lava lakes, often dragging silicate pyroclastic material with them. These plumes form red (from the short-chain sulfur) and black (from the silicate pyroclastics) deposits on the surface. Plumes formed in this manner are among the largest observed at Io, forming red rings more than in diameter. Examples of this plume type include Pele, Tvashtar, and Dazhbog. Another type of plume is produced when encroaching lava flows vaporize underlying sulfur dioxide frost, sending the sulfur skyward. This type of plume often forms bright circular deposits consisting of sulfur dioxide. These plumes are often less than tall, and are among the most long-lived plumes on Io. Examples include Prometheus, Amirani, and Masubi. The erupted sulfurous compounds are concentrated in the upper crust from a decrease in sulfur solubility at greater depths in Io&#x27;s lithosphere and can be a determinant for the eruption style of a hot spot. 
====Mountains====

Io has 100 to 150 mountains. These structures average in height and reach a maximum of at South &quot;Boösaule Montes&quot;. Mountains often appear as large (the average mountain is long), isolated structures with no apparent global tectonic patterns outlined, in contrast to the case on Earth. To support the tremendous topography observed at these mountains requires compositions consisting mostly of silicate rock, as opposed to sulfur.

Despite the extensive volcanism that gives Io its distinctive appearance, nearly all of its mountains are tectonic structures, and are not produced by volcanoes. Instead, most Ionian mountains form as the result of compressive stresses on the base of the lithosphere, which uplift and often tilt chunks of Io&#x27;s crust through thrust faulting. The compressive stresses leading to mountain formation are the result of subsidence from the continuous burial of volcanic materials. The global distribution of mountains appears to be opposite that of volcanic structures; mountains dominate areas with fewer volcanoes and vice versa. This suggests large-scale regions in Io&#x27;s lithosphere where compression (supportive of mountain formation) and extension (supportive of patera formation) dominate. Locally, however, mountains and paterae often abut one another, suggesting that magma often exploits faults formed during mountain formation to reach the surface.

Mountains on Io (generally, structures rising above the surrounding plains) have a variety of morphologies. Plateaus are most common. These structures resemble large, flat-topped mesas with rugged surfaces. Other mountains appear to be tilted crustal blocks, with a shallow slope from the formerly flat surface and a steep slope consisting of formerly sub-surface materials uplifted by compressive stresses. Both types of mountains often have steep scarps along one or more margins. Only a handful of mountains on Io appear to have a volcanic origin. These mountains resemble small shield volcanoes, with steep slopes (6–7°) near a small, central caldera and shallow slopes along their margins. These volcanic mountains are often smaller than the average mountain on Io, averaging only in height and wide. Other shield volcanoes with much shallower slopes are inferred from the morphology of several of Io&#x27;s volcanoes, where thin flows radiate out from a central patera, such as at Ra Patera.

Nearly all mountains appear to be in some stage of degradation. Large landslide deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. Scalloped margins are common among Io&#x27;s mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io&#x27;s crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.

==Atmosphere==

Io has an extremely thin atmosphere consisting mainly of sulfur dioxide (), with minor constituents including sulfur monoxide (), sodium chloride (), and atomic sulfur and oxygen. The atmosphere has significant variations in density and temperature with time of day, latitude, volcanic activity, and surface frost abundance. The maximum atmospheric pressure on Io ranges from 3.3 to 3 pascals (Pa) or 0.3 to 3 nbar, spatially seen on Io&#x27;s anti-Jupiter hemisphere and along the equator, and temporally in the early afternoon when the temperature of surface frost peaks. Localized peaks at volcanic plumes have also been seen, with pressures of 5 to 40  Pa (5 to 40 nbar). Io&#x27;s atmospheric pressure is lowest on Io&#x27;s night side, where the pressure dips to 0.1 to 1 Pa (0.0001 to 0.001 nbar). Io&#x27;s atmospheric temperature ranges from the temperature of the surface at low altitudes, where sulfur dioxide is in vapor pressure equilibrium with frost on the surface, to 1,800 K at higher altitudes where the lower atmospheric density permits heating from plasma in the Io plasma torus and from Joule heating from the Io flux tube. The low pressure limits the atmosphere&#x27;s effect on the surface, except for temporarily redistributing sulfur dioxide from frost-rich to frost-poor areas, and to expand the size of plume deposit rings when plume material re-enters the thicker dayside atmosphere.

Gas in Io&#x27;s atmosphere is stripped by Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere, escaping to either the neutral cloud that surrounds Io, or the Io plasma torus, a ring of ionized particles that shares Io&#x27;s orbit but co-rotates with the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Approximately one ton of material is removed from the atmosphere every second through this process so that it must be constantly replenished. The most dramatic source of are volcanic plumes, which pump kg of sulfur dioxide per second into Io&#x27;s atmosphere on average, though most of this condenses back onto the surface. Much of the sulfur dioxide in Io&#x27;s atmosphere is sustained by sunlight-driven sublimation of frozen on the surface. The day-side atmosphere is largely confined to within 40° of the equator, where the surface is warmest and most active volcanic plumes reside. A sublimation-driven atmosphere is also consistent with observations that Io&#x27;s atmosphere is densest over the anti-Jupiter hemisphere, where frost is most abundant, and is densest when Io is closer to the Sun. However, some contributions from volcanic plumes are required as the highest observed densities have been seen near volcanic vents. Because the density of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is tied directly to surface temperature, Io&#x27;s atmosphere partially collapses at night, or when Io is in the shadow of Jupiter (with an ~80% drop in column density). The collapse during eclipse is limited somewhat by the formation of a diffusion layer of sulfur monoxide in the lowest portion of the atmosphere, but the atmosphere pressure of Io&#x27;s nightside atmosphere is two to four orders of magnitude less than at its peak just past noon. The minor constituents of Io&#x27;s atmosphere, such as , , , and derive either from: direct volcanic outgassing; photodissociation, or chemical breakdown caused by solar ultraviolet radiation, from ; or the sputtering of surface deposits by charged particles from Jupiter&#x27;s magnetosphere.

Various researchers have proposed that the atmosphere of Io freezes onto the surface when it passes into the shadow of Jupiter. Evidence for this is a &quot;post-eclipse brightening&quot;, where the moon sometimes appears a bit brighter as if covered with frost immediately after eclipse. After about 15 minutes the brightness returns to normal, presumably because the frost has disappeared through sublimation. Besides being seen through ground-based telescopes, post-eclipse brightening was found in near-infrared wavelengths using an instrument aboard the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft. Further support for this idea came in 2013 when the Gemini Observatory was used to directly measure the collapse of Io&#x27;s atmosphere during, and its reformation after, eclipse with Jupiter.

High-resolution images of Io acquired when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, this is due to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io&#x27;s are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field near Io directly impact Io&#x27;s atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is the longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter&#x27;s tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red glows in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io&#x27;s night-side (the green glows in the same image) have also been observed.
