<text>Meiningen () is a town in the southern part of the state of Thuringia, Germany. It is located in the region of Franconia and has a population of around 26,000 (2024). Meiningen is the capital and the largest town of the Schmalkalden-Meiningen district. From 1680 to 1920, Meiningen was the capital of the Duchy (and briefly of the Free State) of Saxe-Meiningen.

Meiningen is considered the cultural, judicial and financial centre of southern Thuringia and thus hosts the state theatre, justice center, state archives, bank buildings and many museums. It is economically reliant on mechanical engineering, high-tech industry and tourism. The dialect and language of the inhabitants is East Franconian.

== History ==

=== Through the Middle Ages ===
Meiningen originated during the formation of the Frankish Empire in the 6th or 7th century, which established trade routes, river crossings and boundary markers. An intersection of two trade routes and a ford was located at the present-day southern end of the old town near the Werra river.
Meiningen was first mentioned in 982 (extract certificate: &quot;…in villis Meininga in Meiningermarca…&quot;). The village was first a crown land in the Duchy of Franconia and later a possession of the king. Around the year 1000, construction of the &quot;Stadtkirche&quot; (town church) began. It was several times expanded and rebuilt over the centuries. German Emperor Henry II donated Meiningen in 1008 to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Würzburg, and for 534 years it remained part of Würzburg. To protect their property, the Bishops of Würzburg built a moated castle (today &quot;Schloss Elisabethenburg&quot; palace) in the 11th century. In 1153, the plague raged in Meiningen, which was also granted judicial rights (the first town-charter type of rights) that year by the rulers. In 1222, Würzburg and the House of Henneberg fought for possession of Meiningen, while the town suffered extensive damage. Meiningen was first mentioned in 1230 as a &quot;Stadt&quot; (town) and was granted wide-ranging autonomy in 1344. During this time the citizens built a powerful fortification with a double wall and three moats. From 1239 to 1242 the Friars Minor of the Franciscan Order built a monastery between the castle and the Lower Gate. In 1380, a fire destroyed around a quarter of the town, including the archives of the town council. The town joined together with ten other towns of the Bishopric of Würzburg and participated in 1396-1399 in the &quot;Franconian town war&quot; against the diocese. Würzburg troops besieged Meiningen, until it capitulated in 1399. In an uprising on 10 August 1432, the citizens destroyed the castle (&quot;Würzburger Burg&quot; or &quot;Burg Meiningen&quot;). In the years 1443-1455, the town church was enlarged in the Gothic style.

=== Early modern period ===
Meiningen had about 2,000 inhabitants in 1450. At the end of the 15th century two devastating fires destroyed almost the whole town. 26 people were killed. The town church was spared from the fire. Bishop Lorenz von Bibra built a new castle from 1509 to 1511. In the town textiles, metal working and trade became more important. In 1542, Meiningen came to the Henneberg family in exchange for the administrative district (&quot;Amt&quot;) of Mainberg from the Prince-Bishop of Würzburg, Conrad von Bibra. In 1583, with the extinction of the Henneberg family, the town went to the Wettin family. The Wettin family established its seat of transitional government for the County of Henneberg in Meiningen until 1660. The town experienced a great economic boom driven by the fustian- and linen weaving, dyeing and fabric trades, which lasted until the beginning of the 17th century, resulting in faster population increase to about 5,000. For example, in 1614 234 master craftsmen produced 37,312 pieces of cloth that were traded throughout Europe. This period was ended abruptly by the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1634, when Croatian troops plundered the town. In 1641, Swedish troops besieged the town. Meiningen lost thousands of inhabitants to death or expulsion.

=== Residence of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen ===

Between 1680 and 1918, Meiningen was the capital of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen. In 1682-92, the ducal palace &quot;Schloss Elisabethenburg&quot; was built and by 1690 the Court Orchestra had been created. From 1782, the &quot;Englischer Garten&quot;, an English landscape garden was created in the town center.

In 1813, a Russian army of 70,000 soldiers and 2,300 officers under Grand Duke Alexander in his campaign against Napoleon camped in and around Meiningen. The Tsar had his quarters in the inn &quot;Zum Braune Hirsch&quot;, which also served for the entrained Prussian Army as headquarters. In 1782, Friedrich Schiller had been a guest at the inn.
One of the princesses of Saxe-Meiningen, Adelheid Louise Theresa Caroline Amelia von Sachsen-Meiningen, became the wife of the future King William IV of Great Britain in 1818. The Australian city of Adelaide is named for her.

Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, who became a great patron of the theatrical art, was born in 1826. The first Meiningen Court Theatre opened in 1831. The fairy tale collector and writer Ludwig Bechstein was an archivist in Meiningen. In 1858, the town was connected by the Werra Railway to the German railway network. In September 1874, a major fire destroyed a third of the town. The reconstruction took place in Neoclassical style with the financial help of many German and Austrian cities. In the same year, the Schweinfurt–Meiningen railway opened. A new town hall was built in 1878.

By end of the 19th century and by the beginning of the 20th century, the existence of several large banks made Meiningen an important financial centre in Germany. During these decades, the town stretched out far beyond its ancient limits. New residential areas were built, and the population grew rapidly. Many lavish buildings were built at that time. 1889, the town church was enlarged in the Gothic Revival style. A large fire destroyed the &quot;Hoftheater&quot; (court theatre) in 1908, it was rebuilt in Neoclassical style and reopened in December 1909. In 1914, the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works was built.

===After 1918===
The Duchy was abolished at the end of World War I in 1918. Meiningen then became the capital of the successor state &quot;Freistaat Saxony-Meiningen&quot;. From 1920, it was a district town in the newly created state of Thuringia. was founded in 1923. In 1927, &quot;&quot;, an airfield, was opened. In October 1931, airship LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin landed there before 100,000 spectators, followed by the airship LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II on 9 July 1939. During World War II, Meiningen was the location of a prisoner of war hospital, and several German military hospitals. The Deutsche Dienststelle was based in the &quot;Drachenbergkaserne&quot; barracks from 1943 to 1945. A heavy air raid on Meiningen on 23 February 1945, by the USAAF caused 208 deaths, destroyed 251 houses and two bridges in total, and damaged 440 buildings. Meiningen was occupied by American armed forces on 5 April 1945.

In July 1945, the town was included in the Soviet occupation zone along with the rest of Thuringia, and thus later became part of the German Democratic Republic (DDR). To accommodate workers for a microelectronics plant, the &quot;Robotron Meiningen&quot;, the new district of Jerusalem (Meiningen) was created from 1967 to 1983 in the north between Helba and Welkershausen, eventually housing around 6,000 inhabitants. Meiningen was an important center of &quot;Die Wende&quot; in southern Thuringia in 1989. Among the many events were a total of 25 demonstrations with 1,000-25,000 participants.

After German reunification in 1990, Meiningen became the district town of Schmalkalden-Meiningen. In the &quot;Dreißigacker&quot; district, new businesses and the new Meiningen Hospital were constructed. In the 1990s, there was a new construction boom in the town, with many houses being renovated and embellished. In July 1994, Chancellor of Germany Helmut Kohl visited the town, Angela Merkel did so in April 2012. The new &quot;Justizzentrum&quot; (court house) was built in 2000. In 2003, the town was connected to the &quot;Bundesautobahn 71&quot;. With the opening of the new &quot;Kammerspiele&quot; in June 2008, the town created another theater venue, underlining its national significance as a cultural town. In 2013, the new industrial area &quot;Rohrer Berg&quot; near the motorway junction Meiningen-North was created.

<text>Dio vi salvi Regina (Italian for &quot;God save you Queen&quot;) is a Corsican folk song. It is considered the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;national anthem&quot; of Corsica. It is customarily sung it at the end of concerts of Corsican folk music.

It was written as a religious song in Italy by Francis de Geronimo (later canonized) about 1675, transforming the Salve Regina into a folk-language hymn. It was adopted &quot;de facto&quot; as the national anthem of Corsica when it proclaimed independence from the Republic of Genoa at Orezza, on 30 January 1735. Traditionally, a shepherd, Salvadore Costa, is credited with converting the hymn not only to a Corsican anthem, but to a rallying symbol for Corsican independence. It was first performed at the Chapel of St. Mark (San Marco) on 25 April 1720.

The anthem requests the intercessory protection of the Virgin Mary, heartily concurred in by the independence leaders. There were a few changes, such as in the second stanza from &quot;disperati&quot; (desperate) to &quot;tribolati&quot; (troubled). The commonly used version&#x27;s last stanza was an original addition, written in the Corsican language, which makes reference to victory against enemies of Corsica, as to highlight the adopted lyrics&#x27; intended use.

<text>William Brady (born 13 February 1956) is an Irish former footballer and pundit. He found success both in England with Arsenal, where he won an FA Cup in 1979, and in Italy with Juventus, winning two Serie A titles. Brady was capped 72 times for the Republic of Ireland national team.

Brady was a talented attacking midfielder renowned for his left foot and elegant technical skills such as his high-quality passing, vision and close control, which made him an excellent playmaker.

Brady went on to manage Celtic and Brighton and Hove Albion. He was the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national football team from 2008 to 2010 and also held the post of Head of Youth Development at Arsenal from 1996 to 2013. He began his media career as a television pundit in 1990 with the BBC, before moving to RTÉ Sport in 1998. In June 2023, Brady announced that he would step down from his punditry duties with RTÉ after 25 years.

==Early life and family==
Brady was born and raised in Dublin in a footballing family, with both his great uncle Frank Brady Sr. and older brother Ray Brady winning senior international caps. Of his other brothers, Frank won the FAI Cup with Shamrock Rovers in 1968 and made two appearances in the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, while Pat played with Millwall and Queens Park Rangers. Liam attended St. Aidan&#x27;s C.B.S., leaving before his Intermediate Certificate. He alleged at the time that he had been expelled for missing a school Gaelic football match to play a schoolboy soccer international; the school denied this.

==Club career==
Brady started his career at Arsenal, moving to London to join the side on schoolboy forms in 1971, at the age of 15. He turned professional on his 17th birthday in 1973, and made his debut on 6 October 1973 against Birmingham City as a substitute for Jeff Blockley, and put in an assured performance. However his next match, in a North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Brady had a poor match, and Arsenal manager Bertie Mee decided from then on to use the young Irishman sparingly for the time being. Brady ended the 1973–74 season with 13 appearances (four of them as substitute) to his name. While at Arsenal, and particularly early in his career, Brady was nicknamed &quot;Chippy&quot;, not for his ability to chip the ball but for his fondness for fish and chips.

In 1974–75 Brady was a first-team regular at Arsenal, and shone as a rare light in a side that hovered close to relegation for a couple of seasons in the mid-1970s. With the appointment of Terry Neill as manager and the return of Don Howe as coach, Brady found his best form. His passing provided the ammunition for Arsenal&#x27;s front men such as Malcolm Macdonald and Frank Stapleton, and Arsenal reached three FA Cup finals in a row between 1978 and 1980. Arsenal won only the middle of the three, against Manchester United in the 1979 final, with Brady starting the move that ended in Alan Sunderland&#x27;s famous last-minute winner.

Brady was at the peak of his Arsenal form by now, as shown by one of his best goals for Arsenal; having dispossessed Peter Taylor he flighted a looped curled shot from the edge of the penalty area into the top corner, in a 5–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur on 23 December 1978. During this time he was voted the club&#x27;s player of the year three times, and chosen as the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year in 1979. Being from Ireland, he was the first foreign player to win the award.

He was the most talented player in what was then a promising young Arsenal side, which was looking to consistently challenge for honours such as the Division One title. Despite this, by the 1979–80 season rumour was rife that Brady would be leaving the club in search of a fresh challenge.

That season, Arsenal reached the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final (losing to Valencia on penalties), having beaten Juventus 2–1 over two legs in the semi-finals. Brady&#x27;s performance in the tie impressed the Italian giants and in the 1980 close season they signed him for just over £500,000, becoming the first foreign player to sign for the club since the Italian borders were re-opened for foreign transfers in 1980. He is remembered as one of Arsenal&#x27;s all-time greats, playing 307 matches for the Gunners, scoring 59 goals and setting up many more.

Brady spent two seasons with Juventus, wearing the number 10 shirt, and picking up two Italian Championship medals, in 1981 and 1982; Brady scored the only goal (a penalty) in the 1–0 win against Catanzaro that won the 1982 title. After the arrival of Michel Platini in summer 1982, Brady moved to Sampdoria, allowing him to take the number 10 shirt and team up with Trevor Francis. Brady moved on after two years in which Sampdoria failed to finish higher than sixth place, and went on to play for Internazionale (1984–1986). At the San Siro, Brady teamed up with Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, reaching a UEFA Cup semi-final and a third place finish domestically, but failed to win any major honours. In 1986, Brady joined Ascoli, where his career in Italy reached a sour conclusion. A year spent arguing over failed payments of wages with club president Costantino Rozzi, marked the end of what was a much celebrated chapter of his career.

Brady, at the age of 31, returned to London in March 1987, for a transfer fee of £100,000, to play for West Ham United, where he scored 10 goals in 119 games in all competitions. He was a member of the side relegated from the First Division in 1989 and played one season in the Second Division before finally retiring as a player in 1990. His last game came on 5 May 1990, a 4–0 home win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, a game in which he scored.

==International career==
Brady made his debut for Ireland on 30 October 1974, in a 3–0 win against the Soviet Union at Dalymount Park in a European Championship qualifier.
Brady has claimed his favourite international goal was that against Brazil in 1987.

Due to a suspension accrued before Euro 88 he was not eligible to play within the tournament. During qualification for Italia 90 Brady retired from the international game. As Ireland got to the World Cup for the first time ever he declared himself available to play once again. However, Jack Charlton went on to declare that only those who played in the qualifiers would make the trip to Italy.

He won 72 international caps for the Republic of Ireland with 70 within the starting line-up, scoring nine goals.

==Managerial career==
After retiring from playing in 1990, he managed Celtic between 1991 and 1993, and then Brighton &amp; Hove Albion between 1993 and 1995. Neither spell was particularly successful, and at both clubs Brady&#x27;s tenure was overshadowed by the respective clubs&#x27; financial problems. At Celtic, Brady failed to win a single trophy in his two-year tenure, which included a 5–2 defeat on aggregate by Neuchâtel Xamax in the 1991–92 UEFA Cup.

Brady had no greater success with Brighton, departing following a disagreement over the way the club was being run. He later led an unsuccessful bid by a consortium to buy the club.

He rejoined Arsenal in July 1996, as Head of Youth Development and Academy Director. Although he was linked to the manager&#x27;s post after the departure of Bruce Rioch, Brady stated he was not interested in the role and Arsène Wenger eventually took up the post. Under Brady, Arsenal&#x27;s youth sides won the 1998 FA Premier Youth League, the FA Premier Academy League U17 title in 2000 and the FA Premier Academy League U19 title in 2002. Under his watch they also lifted the 2009 and 2010 FA Premier Academy League U18 titles, together with the FA Youth Cup in 2000, 2001 and 2009.

After the sacking of Steve Staunton as Republic of Ireland manager in 2007, Brady became an assistant to new manager Giovanni Trapattoni alongside former Juventus teammate Marco Tardelli in 2008, while continuing to work as Director of the Arsenal Youth Academy. He stepped down from the Republic of Ireland post in April 2010 when his contract expired. He stated he would have gladly stayed on with Ireland were it not for his Arsenal commitments.

On 30 January 2013, Arsenal announced that Brady would leave his role as Director of the Arsenal Youth Academy in May 2014.

Brady has served as an ambassador of The Arsenal Foundation since 2017.

==Media career==

Brady first worked as a pundit for the BBC at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups before moving for the 1998 tournament to RTÉ Sport. He joined what became a long-running studio team with fellow pundits Johnny Giles and Eamon Dunphy and presenter Bill O&#x27;Herlihy. They were parodied by the &quot;Après Match&quot; sketches in which Brady was portrayed by Barry Murphy. Brady remained an RTÉ television analyst, appearing on coverage of the 2018 World Cup, UEFA Euro 2020 and 2022 World Cup.

Brady was involved in an Irish anti-drugs campaign in the early 1990s, called &quot;give drugs the boot&quot;, which encouraged young boys to play sport as a healthy pastime.

In February 2023, a documentary about his life called &quot;Liam Brady: The Irishman Abroad&quot; aired on RTÉ One.

On 19 June 2023, Brady announced that he would step down from his punditry duties with RTÉ Sport after 25 years. His final match as an analyst was the 3–0 win against Gibraltar.

<doc id="1045457" wikidata="Q208204" url="?curid=1045457" title="Finding Neverland (film)">
<text>Finding Neverland is a 2004 biographical fantasy film directed by Marc Forster and written by David Magee, based on the 1998 play &quot;The Man Who Was Peter Pan&quot; by Allan Knee. The film stars Johnny Depp, Kate Winslet, Julie Christie, Radha Mitchell, and Dustin Hoffman, with Freddie Highmore in a supporting role.

&quot;Finding Neverland&quot; was released on October 29, 2004. It was a box office success, grossing $116.8 million worldwide. The film earned seven nominations at the 77th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor for Depp, and won for Best Original Score. The film was the inspiration for the stage musical of the same name in 2012.

==Plot==
In 1903, following the dismal reception of his latest play, &quot;Little Mary&quot;, Sir James Matthew Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons (George, Jack, Peter and Michael) in Kensington Gardens. A strong friendship develops among them. Barrie proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas that he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, in particular one named after troubled young Peter Llewelyn Davies. Although Barrie sees this family as wonderful and inspirational, others question his relationship with the Llewelyn Davies family. Barrie&#x27;s wife Mary divorces and Sylvia&#x27;s mother Emma du Maurier objects to the time that he spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia weakens from an unidentified illness.

Producer Charles Frohman agrees to mount &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, despite his belief that it holds no appeal for upper class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults react to their delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success. Barrie is all set for his play, but when Peter arrives alone to the play, he goes to Sylvia&#x27;s house to check up on her, and misses the show. Peter attends the play and realizes it is really about his brothers and Barrie.

Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in the Llewelyn Davies house. At the end of the play, Peter Pan points to the back doors and implies that Sylvia should go off to Neverland. She takes the hands of her boys and slowly walks out.

The following scene takes place at Sylvia&#x27;s funeral. Barrie discovers that her will says that he and her mother should look after the boys, an arrangement agreeable to both parties. The film ends with J. M. Barrie comforting Peter on the bench in the park where they had first met.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Finding Neverland&quot; was originally scheduled to be released in autumn 2003. Universal Pictures, which owned the film rights to Barrie&#x27;s original play and was adapting it for cinema release the same year, refused to allow Miramax Films to use scenes from the play in &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; if it were released the same year. Miramax Films agreed to delay the release, in exchange for the rights to reproduce in the film scenes from the stage production. &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; opened in 2004, 100 years after Barrie&#x27;s play opened.

Richmond Theatre in Richmond upon Thames doubled as the &quot;Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre&quot;, the venue in which &quot;Peter Pan&quot; was first presented. Exterior scenes were filmed in Hyde Park, Brompton Cemetery and Kensington Gardens. According to commentary on the DVD release, the structure used as Barrie&#x27;s summer cottage was located near Kent. Interiors were filmed in the Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, and the Shepperton Studios in Surrey.

Filming occurred in various places in the United Kingdom. Production shot a short fantasy sequence at the Laredo Wild West Town in Kent. The town is featured in multiple fantasy-playing sessions set in the Wild West, when Barrie (Johnny Depp) plays with the Llewellyn Davies boys.

Dustin Hoffman had previously appeared in the title role of &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), the &quot;Peter Pan&quot; sequel film by Steven Spielberg. The screenplay for &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; had originally included a scene in which his character, the play&#x27;s sceptical producer, was to put on the Captain Hook costume and read some of his lines to point out how silly he found it. Hoffman objected to this, so the scene was rewritten for him to simply read aloud and ridicule character names from the play.

Eileen Essell, 82 years old at the time, made one of her first feature film appearances. She also followed Depp to a role in &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.

Freddie Highmore&#x27;s performance in &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; led Depp to suggest him to Tim Burton for &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, in which he played Charlie Bucket and Depp played Willy Wonka.

===Music===
==Release==
The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival. It was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, the Haifa Film Festival, the Athens Panorama European Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, the Chicago International Film Festival and the Leeds International Film Festival, before opening in the U.K. 29 October 2004.

It had a limited release in the United States 12 November 2004, and opened more widely 24 November 2004.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was budgeted at $25 million. It grossed $51,676,606 in the U.S., and $63 million in other markets, for a total worldwide box-office tally of $115,036,108.

===Critical reception===

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; has an approval rating of 83%, based on 206 reviews, with an average rating of 7.47/10. The website&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;It won&#x27;t pass muster for those looking for historical accuracy, but &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; is a warm, heartfelt drama with a charm all its own — and Johnny Depp gives a graceful performance as Peter Pan creator J.M. Barrie.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;A&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

In her review in &quot;The Times&quot;, Wendy Ide called the film &quot;charming but rather idiosyncratic&quot;, and added, &quot;A mixture of domestic drama, tragedy and exuberant fantasy, the film blends moist-eyed nostalgia with the cruel disappointments of a marriage break-up; a childlike playfulness and unpredictability with a portrait of a treacherously unforgiving and rigid Edwardian society. It could appeal to everyone from preteens to pensioners, or it could appeal to no one at all. Ultimately this unconventionality is probably one of the film&#x27;s main strengths. And if the tone veers a little haphazardly between fantasy and cold, hard reality, well, perhaps that is the most effective way of taking us into the mind of the film&#x27;s mercurial protagonist.&quot;

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it &quot;is the kind of film where even the smallest crack has been sealed. Instead of real quirks, strange habits, moments of everyday gas, gurgle and grunting, movies like this give us sumptuous production design, meticulous costumes and stories meant to leave us dewy-eyed and thoughtful, if never actually disturbed... The problem isn&#x27;t the liberties the filmmakers take with reality, but that this isn&#x27;t an engaging bowdlerization... Johnny Depp neither soars nor crashes, but moseys forward with vague purpose and actorly restraint... [he] and Ms. Winslet are pleasant to watch, as are the actors who play the Davies boys, but they haven&#x27;t been pushed to their limits.&quot;

In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle observed that the film &quot;ends so beautifully, so poignantly and so aptly that there&#x27;s a big temptation to forget that most of what precedes the ending is tiresome drivel, that Johnny Depp&#x27;s performance... is precious and uninsightful, and that almost all the movie&#x27;s magic derives directly from scenes lifted from Barrie&#x27;s play. Winslet&#x27;s no-nonsense strength is especially appreciated... Another actress would have followed Depp into the quicksand of faux-poetic self-indulgence. But Winslet is direct, grounded and heartfelt in a recognizably human way. Dustin Hoffman, as Barrie&#x27;s producer, also steers clear of Depp&#x27;s rhythms, though he has trouble deciding whether the producer is British or American.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the film 3½ stars out of 4, and called it &quot;glorious entertainment... magical, not mush&quot;. About Depp, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s too early to speculate on how [he] will grow as an actor. Based on &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, it&#x27;s not too early to call him a great one.&quot;

In the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, Steve Persall gave the film a &quot;B&quot; grade, and commented, &quot;A first viewing of &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; was tear-inducing and completely satisfying. Seeing it again was a mistake, less of my own than Forster&#x27;s, who didn&#x27;t make a movie that can sustain its magic beyond first impressions. Problems with David Magee&#x27;s screenplay that initially could be shrugged off—occasionally slow pacing, melodramatic plot twists—became glaring. With familiarity, the fantasy simply wasn&#x27;t as fanciful. It felt like growing up, and it was disappointing. On the other hand, many of the film&#x27;s qualities are too strong to falter, starting with another fascinating man-child performance by Johnny Depp as Barrie.&quot;

Carina Chocano of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the film as &quot;gently seductive, genuinely tender and often moving without being maudlin&quot;, and added, &quot;Depp and Winslet share a rare combination of airiness, earthiness and sharp, wry intelligence.&quot;

<text>Six Flags Great America is a themed amusement park located in Gurnee, Illinois, within the northern Chicago metropolitan area. The amusement park originally opened as Marriott&#x27;s Great America on May 29, 1976, as one of two theme parks built by the Marriott Corporation. Six Flags acquired the amusement park in 1984 after the theme park division was an earnings disappointment for Marriott. The sale gave Six Flags rights to the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; intellectual properties.

In 1972, the Marriott Corporation bought rural land near the Tri-State Tollway and had officially announced the theme park to the public the following year, in 1973. The new park would be built near identical to its sister park in Santa Clara, California, now named California&#x27;s Great America. Designed by architect Randall Duell, the park was designed in a &quot;Duell loop,&quot; in where the park was laid out in a full circuit circularly, as employees worked out of sight, in the middle of the park. Opening attractions and areas within the park were designed to be based around areas around North America, such as Orleans Place, a neighborhood located in the French Quarter during the 1850s and Hometown Square, a 20th-century American town. This has since expanded to twelve themed areas, such as the Wild West themed area Southwest Territory, three kids areas, with the County Fair subsection, Kidzopolis and two DC Comics themed areas, one being DC Universe.

Featuring 15 roller coasters, the park ranks fourth-most roller coasters in the world. The park’s sixteenth roller coaster, Wrath of Rakshasa, will open in 2025. Additionally, the park features an adjacent water park called Hurricane Harbor Chicago, which features 25 water slides and attractions and opened on May 28, 2005. Since 2017, over 3 million guests visited Six Flags Great America, ranking it among the top 20 amusement parks in North America for attendance. Running from April until November, the park features multiple annual events such as the Halloween events Fright Fest and Kids Boo Fest, and formerly hosted the Christmas event Holiday in the Park, which had extended the park&#x27;s operating season until January.

The park has achieved multiple milestones, records, and awards. American Eagle was one of the first record breakers for the park, becoming the tallest, fastest and longest racing wooden coaster in the world, a record that the ride still maintains. , the park&#x27;s inverted roller coaster, was the first of its kind, and was awarded the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) Landmark award in 2005. Whizzer also won the same award in 2012 for the park&#x27;s maintenance of the attraction. Shows at the park have also received critical acclaim, with recognition from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), winning &quot;Best Overall Production&quot; awards.

== History ==
=== 1970–1984: Operation under Marriott ===

==== Development and construction ====
In the early 1970s, the Marriott Corporation, owner of several restaurant chains and Marriott hotels, sought to branch further out into the tourism and vacation industry. The largest of the projects it took on was a chain of state-of-the-art theme parks, each of which would be named &quot;Marriott&#x27;s Great America&quot; and themed around American history, opening in time for the nation&#x27;s bicentennial. From the beginning, three parks were planned, as Marriott identified three underserved metropolitan areas that could support a major amusement park: Baltimore–Washington, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Chicago–Milwaukee.

The largest of these, at , was announced for Laurel, Maryland, in 1972. The proposal was canceled after fierce opposition from local residents convinced officials to deny the park permits, and the plans were moved to Manassas, Virginia, in 1973, where it faced even stronger opposition from local residents and the National Park Service. The planned opening of the flagship park was delayed repeatedly until Marriott abandoned the idea late in the decade.

Meanwhile, the plans for the other two parks proceeded more smoothly. The location in the north of the Chicago metropolitan area was chosen to bring in visitors from Milwaukee and Chicago. Marriott purchased of rural land in Gurnee straddling the Tri-State Tollway in August 1972, causing speculation in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that an amusement park was planned for the site. The Gurnee park was officially announced on January 29, 1973, along with a hotel and an industrial park. Marriott received approval from local authorities, but the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority would not approve a proposal for an interchange on the tollway leading directly into the parking lot.

The groundbreaking ceremony was held on Flag Day, June 14, 1974. Randall Duell was the leader of the design team for the park, who created two nearly identical plans for the Gurnee park and the sister park in Santa Clara, California. Duell was a veteran theme park designer and for the Great America parks he sought to create his greatest design yet. With an overarching Americana theme in mind, Marriott&#x27;s designers traveled across the country, observing styles and collecting artifacts to help inform an authentic atmosphere.

The park was broken up into six original themed areas, which are organized in a &quot;Duell loop&quot; that runs clockwise around the perimeter. The first of these was Carousel Plaza, located at the front of the park, centered around the double-decker Columbia Carousel; Hometown Square, based on early 20th century small towns of the Midwest; followed by The Great Midwest Livestock Exposition at County Fair (now just County Fair), with its early 20th century rural county fair; Yukon Territory, resembling a logging camp in the Canadian Yukon; Yankee Harbor, a 19th-century New England port inspired by Cape Cod; and finally Orleans Place, modeled after the French Quarter of New Orleans.

Each themed area had its own set of costumes for park employees, and the design of buildings, shops and restaurants were all unique to each theme. For example, the Klondike Cafe in Yukon Territory served beef dishes in large pans like those used for panning for gold. A seventh area, The Great Southwest, was planned from the beginning as a potential expansion, but was not built until 1996, when it opened as Southwest Territory.

==== Opening and operation ====
The park opened on Saturday, May 29, 1976, two months after California&#x27;s Great America. The park was an immediate success due in part to coinciding with the bicentennial. From the beginning, the park made use of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters as costumed figures to interact with the park attendees, a tradition that continues today under Six Flags ownership. At its opening in 1976, Great America featured three roller coasters, Willard&#x27;s Whizzer, Turn of the Century and The Gulf Coaster. The park had also included other flat rides throughout the park. These attractions included the elaborate double-decker Columbia Carousel, which opened as one of the tallest carousels in the world and the Sky Whirl, a unique, &quot;triple ferris wheel&quot; custom-designed for Marriott. Transportation rides included Delta Flyer and Eagle&#x27;s Flight, two one-way gondola sky car rides. In Orleans Place, attractions in the area were Orleans Orbit, (later renamed simply the &quot;Orbit&quot;), an Enterprise-type ride and Rue Le Dodge, a bumper car ride.
The park&#x27;s second season in 1977 saw the installation of several new rides. The Sky Trek Tower opened in Carousel Plaza and today is one of the few rides to still operate under its original name. Sky Trek Tower was built as and still remains, the tallest freestanding structure in Lake County, Illinois. Also added was Southern Cross, a third gondola sky car ride which offered a round trip and a much higher view than the other two, whose station replaced the removed Gulf Coaster. A few new spinning rides were added, such as Big Top, Davy Jones&#x27; Dinghies and Hay Baler. The park&#x27;s first children&#x27;s section, dubbed Fort Fun, opened in the section designated the Yukon Territory in 1978, which caused the Saskatchewan Scrambler to be relocated to Hometown Square and renamed Hometown Fun Machine. Additionally, Great America&#x27;s fourth roller coaster, Tidal Wave, was a Schwarzkopf Shuttle Loop that opened in 1978 in Yankee Harbor. The Pictorium, an IMAX theatre, opened in 1979 and claimed to have the world&#x27;s largest screen, at 64.5 by 88.25 feet (19.6 × 26.9 meters).

The Turn of the Century roller coaster closed and took on a new look in 1980. Two vertical loops were added, along with two tunnels and the &quot;new&quot; ride was re-themed and renamed Demon. The ride featured an original theme song and new hellish theme elements, some of which were removed following a backlash from those who thought that the ride&#x27;s theming was too &quot;demonic&quot;. The American Eagle, a racing wooden roller coaster, opened in 1981. The tracks share a drop of and they reach speeds of . The bottom of the first drop is built below ground level. When the American Eagle first opened, it had the longest drop and fastest speeds of any wooden roller coaster in the world. It remains the tallest, fastest and longest twin racing wooden coaster.

The Picnic Grove was added in 1982, allowing for more company outings and corporate events to take place at the growing theme park. No new rides were added that year, and several small rides were removed in the last years of Marriott ownership. Southern Cross was removed in 1983. That same year, The Edge, an Intamin first-generation freefall ride, was added to much fanfare. Bottoms Up, a Chance Trabant ride and Traffique Jam were removed at the end of the 1983 season.

The last ride Marriott added to the park was White Water Rampage in 1983, an Intamin-built rapids ride that was later renamed Roaring Rapids and remains the park&#x27;s most popular water ride. The ride was added to Orleans Place, which required the removal of small rides such as Traffique Jam. The Orleans Orbit was moved from its original Orleans Place location to Hometown Square, and became simply The Orbit. By the mid-1980s, the Marriott Corporation was disappointed with the financial performance of its theme park division, with lower profits than the company expected, in part because the third and largest of its Great America parks was never realized. As a result, Marriott decided to focus on its core businesses and began searching for buyers for its two amusement parks. While California&#x27;s Great America was sold to the city of Santa Clara, Bally Manufacturing, then the parent company of the Six Flags Corporation, offered to purchase the Gurnee park for $114.5 million. The deal was finalized on April 26, 1984, and as a result Six Flags also acquired the right to use the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters at all of its other parks.

===1984–1990: Acquisition by Six Flags===

After the sale of the park to Bally Manufacturing in 1983, Great America officially became a Six Flags park. For the upcoming 1984 season, the park was re-branded as Six Flags Great America. Regarding the acquisition of the park, Bally CEO Robert Mullane stated that it would be &quot;foolish to change anything major&quot; at the park. Less than a month after the purchase, a software failure caused a car on The Edge, a freefall ride, to be stalled at the top of the lift shaft before moving forward into its drop position. The car was stuck in this position for a short period of time before it dropped in the lift shaft, causing injuries to all three occupants. Despite many attempts to reopen The Edge with installation of anti-rollback devices by Intamin, the ride was never able to escape the stigma of its 1984 accident. The ride was removed in 1986.

In 1985, Six Flags added Z-Force to the County Fair area, a one-of-a-kind Intamin space diver roller coaster that closed in 1987 and was the only one ever manufactured. The site was later used for Iron Wolf, which opened in 1990. Z-Force was relocated to Six Flags Over Georgia as part of Six Flags&#x27; (now discontinued) Ride Rotation Program. At the end of 1991, the ride went to Six Flags Magic Mountain, where it operated as Flashback before closing in 2003, and being demolished in 2007. Power Dive was added in 1987 to take over the spot where The Edge had stood. Power Dive was an Intamin Looping Starship ride; it swung back and forth before eventually rotating a complete 360 degrees a few times.

While operating the Six Flags chain, Bally found that the excess resources demanded and high seasonal fluctuations of the theme park business made it an unnecessary burden on its core interests. In 1987, Bally sold Six Flags to Wesray Capital Corporation and a group of Six Flags managers. Several acquisitions were re-sold or closed, while Wesray moved the company&#x27;s focus from theming to major attractions. This ushered in an era of major new rides and roller coasters at Six Flags parks like Great America.

1988 saw the first of the new coasters, with the addition of the massive roller coaster Shockwave, an Arrow Dynamics mega-looper, opening in Orleans Place section of the park on June 3. Shockwave was the world&#x27;s tallest roller coaster at the time it opened and was surpassed the following year by Cedar Point&#x27;s Magnum XL-200. It also featured a record seven inversions, which was surpassed in 1995 by PortAventura Park&#x27;s Dragon Khan. When Six Flags Great Adventure&#x27;s Sarajevo Bobsled, an Intamin Bobsled roller coaster, closed in 1988, it was moved to Great America and became Rolling Thunder in 1989, also as part of the Ride Rotation Program. It was added between Demon and Whizzer, where it operated until 1996. It was then relocated to The Great Escape where it operated as Alpine Bobsled until being scrapped in 2023.

For 1990, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard constructed their first ever roller coaster with Iron Wolf, a compact steel stand-up coaster, opened on Z-Force&#x27;s former spot in County Fair. The Condor was added to Orleans Place in 1991, next to Shockwave. During the same year, the IMAX screen in the Pictorium was upgraded to allow 3D movies to be shown and fans said goodbye to Tidal Wave at the end of the season. It was relocated to Six Flags Over Georgia where it operated as Viper from 1995 to 2001, then to Kentucky Kingdom as Greezed Lightnin&#x27; from 2003 to 2009.

=== 1990s: Transition into thrill park ===
By 1990, Six Flags was on the verge of bankruptcy. Time Warner, which had held a major influence at Great America since the beginning through the licensing of its &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters, was a minority owner in the company and it purchased an additional share of the company for a controlling interest of 50 percent. The entrance of the entertainment and communications conglomerate gave the company not only a much-needed influx of new capital, but a chance for increased usage of Time Warner properties in Six Flags parks.
The first of these collaborations between Six Flags and Time Warner came in 1992, as Bolliger &amp; Mabillard constructed their first inverted roller coaster, , to replace Tidal Wave. Batman was unlike any other roller coaster at the time, as it opened as one of the first inverted roller coasters and took riders through five inversions. It was a tight fit for Yankee Harbor, but it proved so popular that lines stretched out of the ride area and across large parts of the park. The surrounding area of Yankee Harbor was re-themed after the Batman films, with The Lobster being renamed the East River Crawler, a name which it retained until it was moved to Hometown Square under its original name in 2016. Batman: The Ride was awarded landmark status by the American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) at their annual convention in 2005.

To add to the hype around Batman from the opening of Batman: The Ride and the mega-hit film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, the &quot;Batman Stunt Show&quot; opened in 1993 in a brand-new amphitheater located past Demon; which would later come to be known as the Southwest Territory Amphitheater. Six Flags and Time Warner had debuted &quot;The Batman Stunt Show&quot; at Six Flags Great Adventure the year prior, with great success. The theater would be a popular venue with several stunt shows for years to come, before being torn down for the 2016 addition of the Justice League: Battle for Metropolis dark ride.
Space Shuttle America, a motion simulator ride, was built in 1994 near Sky Trek Tower. In addition to its purpose-made titular film, Space Shuttle America was home to three other shows during its lifetime: &quot;Escape from Dino Island 2 – 3:D&quot;, &quot;Stargate – SG:3000&quot;, and &quot;Superstition&quot; during the yearly Fright Fest Event. The original Space Shuttle America film returned for the 2006 season. As of 2009, both the Space Shuttle America building and Space Shuttle themed facade have been removed.

In 1995, construction began on a new themed area for the park. The Southwest Territory was originally intended to be added to the park in 1979, with the Southern Cross ride intended to bring guests to it. The first ride built for the new area was Viper, a wooden roller coaster based on the Coney Island Cyclone and themed after a snake oil salesman. Although smaller in stature than American Eagle, this twister-style coaster features many more instances of airtime during the ride. It was built next to Rolling Thunder, which was removed later the same year to make room for the new area. The ride was relocated to The Great Escape in New York, where it operated as Alpine Bobsled until 2023.

Southwest Territory opened in 1996, with a desert theme based on the Old West. Three new rides were added: River Rocker, a pirate ship ride; Chubasco, a teacup ride; and Trail Blazer, a Zamperla Joker. The Big Top was moved in from County Fair and renamed Ricochet. Viper&#x27;s entrance, which had previously been located in Hometown Square, was moved to Southwest Territory entrance. To add to the excitement surrounding the new area, the amphitheater that has previously been home to the &quot;Batman Stunt Show&quot; was named the &quot;Southwest Territory Amphitheater&quot;, and an all-new show, the &quot;Warner Bros. Western Stunt Show&quot;, debuted. This show followed the misadventures of three outlaws as they tangled with characters from Western films such as &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; and &quot;F Troop&quot;. The Western Stunt Show ran for three seasons and was replaced in 1999 by the &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot; Stunt Show. Giant Drop, an Intamin second-generation drop tower and Dare Devil Dive, a skycoaster, were added in 1997. Giant Drop was placed on the southwest side of Southwest Territory across from the mission, and was themed to be an ore excavator in the fictional Loco Diablo Mine. Dare Devil Dive opened in County Fair.

Time Warner sold 50% of its stake in Six Flags in 1995, and in 1998, Premier Parks had its IPO and became the parent company of Six Flags Theme Parks after purchasing the remaining stake from Time Warner as well as the other 50% that had previously been sold off to holding companies. Premier Parks opted to follow the trend set by Bally&#x27;s and began acquiring more properties. Plans for expansion outside the amusement park started in the fall of 1997 with the planning of Six Flags Entertainment Village, an entertainment complex that would&#x27;ve been located across Interstate 94.

1998 saw many family-friendly additions. Yukon Territory welcomed Camp Cartoon Network, with five new rides, including Spacely&#x27;s Sprocket Rockets (a Vekoma junior roller coaster), &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;″s Mystery Machine, Yogi&#x27;s Yahoo River, Rocky Road&#x27;s Rescue Service and Bedrock Boulder Roller. Bugs Bunny Land was renamed Looney Tunes National Park and included the Looney Tooter Choo Choo Train, the Waddaview Charter, Porky&#x27;s Buzzy Beez, Petunia&#x27;s Lady Bugz, Looney Tunes Lodge Foam Ball Factory, Pepe Le Pew&#x27;s Peak and the Nature Trail. Opposition for Six Flags Entertainment Village arose in November 1998 with the citizens group Citizens United for a Residential Village of Gurnee (CURV) forming, with the concern of road congestion and rising tax prices.

Bolliger &amp; Mabillard constructed Raging Bull in 1999, a hyper-twister coaster that was added to Southwest Territory. This , , and ride was built on the former lot used by Rolling Thunder. In late October, the park had officially cancelled their Entertainment Village project.

=== 2000s: Rapid growth and expansion ===
The park celebrated its silver (25th) season in 2000. This was the last year for the Sky Whirl, as well as the Hay Baler ride. Since the removal of Sky Whirl after the 2000 season, Six Flags Great America has continued to operate without a Ferris wheel. That same year, an accident involving a guest occurred on the Cajun Cliffhanger ride, which led to its eventual removal.

In 2001, two inverted shuttle coasters were added: an Intamin impulse coaster named Vertical Velocity, stylized as V2; and Déjà Vu, a Vekoma Giant Inverted Boomerang ride to replace Sky Whirl and &quot;Hay Baler&quot;. Vertical Velocity was added to Yankee Harbor, with the swing ride Whirligig moving closer to the lift hill of Batman: The Ride to make room.

At the beginning of the 2002 season, there were no major changes to the park. The Pictorium&#x27;s original IMAX film, &quot;To Fly&quot;, was once again shown. In the summer, plans were announced to remove the Whizzer, which would offer its final rides on August 11. The announcement confirmed existing rumors. The plan to remove the coaster, which was one of only two operating Schwarzkopf Speedracers in the world, an original ride from the park&#x27;s first season and a popular family-friendly attraction, was met with outrage from the public, particularly because the intended replacement was a major thrill ride. The backlash led to Six Flags deciding on August 3 to cancel their plans to replace Whizzer, and instead elected to replace Shockwave. Power Dive was also removed, due to maintenance problems.

In 2003, Bolliger &amp; Mabillard constructed Superman: Ultimate Flight in Orleans Place, on the plot of land where Shockwave stood. It was the Midwest&#x27;s second flying roller coaster, the first being X-Flight at Geauga Lake. The layout of the ride is identical to versions of the ride at Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Over Georgia. Shockwave had partially stood in the parking lot, and for Superman, the entire landscaping of the ride area was redone. Additionally, the historic Ameri-Go-Round in County Fair was removed at the end of the 2003 season.

Mardi Gras, a new themed area and an extension of Orleans Place, was added in 2004. It was built in the area where Power Dive and Cajun Cliffhanger had stood. A spinning wild mouse coaster named Ragin&#x27; Cajun was added, along with a HUSS Top-Spin model named King Chaos, Zamperla Rockin&#x27; Tug named Jester&#x27;s Wild Ride and a Zamperla Balloon Race named Big Easy Balloons. The same year, the removed Ameri-Go-Round from County Fair was replaced by &quot;Revolution&quot;, a HUSS &quot;Frisbee&quot; ride taken from Six Flags Great Adventure. On September 17, 2004, the Six Flags Hurricane Harbor water park was officially announced. It would become the seventh Hurricane Harbor water park to open, and would be built on a parking lot behind Raging Bull and Viper. The water park would feature Bahama Mama and Bubba Tubba, Hurricane Bay, a wave pool, among other attractions. Groundbreaking began in November 2004, with grand opening on May 28, 2005.

In December 2005, stockholders approved a plan offered by Daniel Snyder of Red Zone, LLC to take over management of Six Flags, Inc., following a fierce stockholder revolt due to rising financial concerns. Snyder appointed former ESPN executive Mark Shapiro as the new CEO of Six Flags, after Kieran Burke was ousted from the company. Snyder and Shapiro&#x27;s plan of action was to move Six Flags away from Premier Parks&#x27; thrill-heavy focus and move more toward a family-friendly environment. During the 2006 season, Six Flags Great America celebrated its 30th anniversary. The classic Triple Play ride in Hometown Square was dismantled prior to the start of the season because Six Flags Over Texas had received a similar HUSS Troika that had been damaged during the hasty demolition of Six Flags AstroWorld, and so a part was needed from the Great America ride for the ride to operate. Triple Play returned for 2007.

Also in 2006, Six Flags announced it would replace its sign that sits along Interstate 94 during the off season. The sign, which had been standing since the park opened in 1976, was replaced with a smaller one featuring an LED screen. The new sign went up within a week after the old one was taken down in December 2006, and uses the old sign&#x27;s post.

2007 marked the introduction of the electronic Flash Pass virtual queue system to Six Flags parks, including Great America. For an additional fee, guests can purchase a Flash Pass and wait in line for a ride without actually standing in line. The system, themed after the DC Comics character, replaced an existing punch card system that was used at the park.

As part of the new focus on entertainment, Six Flags introduced a new stunt show, &quot;Operation SpyGirl&quot;, in the Southwest Territory Amphitheater for the 2007 season. &quot;Operation SpyGirl&quot; was an original live-action production created by Joel Surnow, co-creator of the Fox television series &quot;24&quot;. &quot;Operation SpyGirl&quot; debuted in May, and closed for the season in August. The show marked several new ventures for Six Flags, including pre-show entertainment in the waiting area, which set up the storyline that the evil archvillain Max Condor had stolen the &quot;Super Viper Rocket&quot; from the agency for which SpyGirl worksas well as a merchandise cart outside selling &quot;SpyGirl&quot; themed merchandise. &quot;Operation SpyGirl&quot; did not return in 2008. Other new shows introduced for the 2007 season were &quot;Spirit of America&quot; at the reflection pond in front of the Columbia Carousel, and &quot;Show Stoppin&#x27;&quot; in the Grand Music Hall.

The tented area in front of the American Eagle was converted into &quot;Wiggles World&quot; in 2007, a third children&#x27;s area themed after the Wiggles. Wiggles World featured five new rides, Henry&#x27;s Splash Fountain, the USS Feathersword Play Area, the Yummy Yummy Cafe and the Get Ready to Wiggle Stage show. American Eagle&#x27;s entrance was relocated to the right of the tent, utilizing part of the entrance building for the adjacent Dare Devil Dive skycoaster, to accommodate the Wiggles area.

Great America added The Dark Knight Coaster in 2008, an indoor Mack wild mouse roller coaster themed after the film and located in Orleans Place. The ride is located indoors, mostly in the dark, and has a storyline based around Batman and The Joker. The Theater Royale was converted into a queue building for the ride, which features a preshow starring Aaron Eckhart, reprising his role as Harvey Dent from the film. Additionally, Splashwater Falls closed for the 2007 season early on, and was removed in March 2008. For 2009, Six Flags replaced Déjà Vu with Buccaneer Battle, a pirate-themed boat ride in County Fair designed by Mack Rides. The ride consists of 14 eight-passenger boats navigating a channel long. During the ride, there are numerous interactive water elements that can be controlled by passersby.

=== 2010–2020: Breaking records ===
Six Flags officially emerged from bankruptcy protection on May 3, 2010, and announced plans to issue new stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Amid suspected disagreements regarding the future of the company with the board, Shapiro left the company and Al Weber Jr. was brought in as interim president and CEO. Six Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson would replace Weber and become chairman, president, and CEO on August 13, 2010. In 2010, Great America acquired the Little Dipper, a &quot;kiddie&quot; wooden roller coaster that had previously operated at Kiddieland Amusement Park in Melrose Park, a western suburb of Chicago, from 1950 until 2009. It was placed outside Bugs Bunny National Park and opened to the public on May 27, 2010. The park also introduced the &quot;Glow in the Park Parade&quot;, which was already featured at other Six Flags parks, and MagiQuest was added to the County Fair Games Gallery in place of the Wii Experience.
Space Shuttle America, the park&#x27;s motion simulator ride that had been closed for two years, was removed during the 2010 season. On May 26, 2010, Great America filed a petition with the Village of Gurnee seeking to exceed the village&#x27;s height limit. Six Flags was considering installing Chang, a roller coaster moved after the closure of Kentucky Kingdom, in place of the shuttle. However, the park confirmed it was abandoning those plans in July 2010 and that the space would instead be used for Riptide Bay, a addition to the Hurricane Harbor water park.

In late 2010, Six Flags began removing some licensed properties from concessions and attractions, with Wiggles World being renamed Kidzopolis and having Wiggles branding and theming removed for 2011. MagiQuest closed due to a lack of popularity and Great America Raceway, an original ride from 1976, was closed and removed. At the end of the 2011 season, Iron Wolf was closed and removed. It was relocated to Six Flags America, rebranded as Apocalypse, before it was converted into a floorless roller coaster and renamed Firebird in the 2019 season. For 2012, the former sites of Splashwater Falls and the Great America Raceway in County Fair were taken over by a new wing coaster from Bolliger &amp; Mabillard with 5 inversions, a 12-story drop and speeds of up to 55 mph. X-Flight was the second roller coaster of its type in North America and the fourth in the world.

The Glow in the Park parade was replaced in 2013 with IgNight – Grand Finale to the park. IgNight was held in Hometown Square, in front of the Hometown Station. Six Flags announced that 2013 would be the &quot;Season of Backwards&quot; at Great America, with Batman: The Ride, Viper and the Blue Train on American Eagle all running backwards for some part of the season. At the end of the season, &quot;Ragin&#x27; Cajun&quot; closed and was relocated to Six Flags America in 2014. For 2014, the park received Goliath, a wooden roller coaster built by Rocky Mountain Construction. The ride broke world records for the steepest drop, fastest speed and longest drop on a wooden coaster, and was built on the plot of land where Iron Wolf formerly stood. Three former kiddie rides were reinstalled in the all-new Hometown Park children&#x27;s area in 2015, located in Hometown Square. That year, the park held the &quot;40 Seasons of Thrills&quot; celebration, a festival which celebrated the park&#x27;s history.

In 2016, Great America introduced Justice League: Battle for Metropolis, a 4D interactive dark ride, alongside a new themed area: Metropolis Plaza. The area is themed after the city of Metropolis from DC Comics, and is located between Southwest Territory and County Fair. Six Flags also announced plans to add virtual reality headsets to Raging Bull by the end of that season, but Demon received the VR headsets instead, creating a new &#x27;Rage of the Gargoyles&#x27; ride experience. The Orbit, an original 1976 attraction, closed on August 6, 2016. At the end of the season, The Jester&#x27;s Wild Ride was also removed.

The Joker, an S&amp;S 4D Free Spin roller coaster, was added to Yankee Harbor for the 2017 season. The park also announced that The Orbit would not return, and East River Crawler was relocated to the former site of The Orbit and its name returned to The Lobster, the original name for the ride. For the first month of the season, VR headsets were added to Giant Drop, which became the &quot;Drop of Doom&quot;.

Mardi Gras Hangover, a fire ball attraction, was added in 2018. The attraction is a looping flat ride which at the time was the largest of its kind in the world. King Chaos closed on August 26, 2017, to make way for the new ride. On April 11, Six Flags Great America announced that Holiday in the Park would also debut at the park November 23, 2018. On April 27, the park confirmed via their official Twitter account that Pictorium would be demolished to make way for new thrills. The Pictorium was mainly used for a hypnotist show during Fright Fest and also hosted the &quot;Screams and Dreams&quot; series about the park&#x27;s history. On August 30, 2018, the park announced that Maxx Force would open in 2019 replacing the Pictorium. It is manufactured by S&amp;S Worldwide, and is an air launch roller coaster that breaks three world records and features the fastest acceleration in North America. On October 9, 2018, the Rockford Park District announced a potential lease agreement with Six Flags Great America for the park to operate Magic Waters (now Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Rockford). On December 11, 2018, the lease deal was made official and Six Flags took control of the water park on April 1, 2019.

=== 2020–present: Transformation into family park ===
In March 2020, the park announced the delay of the opening for the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was ordered to stay closed until the &quot;Phase 5&quot; of Illinois&#x27; phased re-opening plan. The attached water park re-opened to the public on July 20, 2020, with safety protocols in place, using the name Hurricane Harbor Chicago. Although the full re-opening of the park was deemed &quot;unlikely&quot; by the Lake County Health Department, the park did open with Holiday in the Park Lights, a holiday lights event, along with Holiday in the Park Lights Drive-Thru, a drive-through holiday event.

On March 22, 2021, the connected Hurricane Harbor park, now officially named Hurricane Harbor Chicago, was announced to become the 27th park in the Six Flags chain, becoming a separate park. In the following month on April 24, 2021, the park reopened at 25% capacity under Illinois order, with safety protocols in place, including a computer reservation system, mask mandates, social distancing, and thermal imaging for temperature checks. On May 13, 2021, Illinois state governor J. B. Pritzker, with the park, announced that they would be giving away 50,000 admission tickets; an estimated total value of $4,000,000, for Illinois residents that have been newly vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Expanded capacity started on May 14, 2021, with 60% capacity afterwards as part of the &quot;Bridge&quot; reopening plan. The park opened at full capacity on June 11, 2021, and all mask mandates were dropped.On March 24, 2022, the park announced DC Universe, a DC Comics themed area. The area is a re-theme of Yankee Harbor. It would feature 3 &quot;re-imagined&quot; rides, The Flash: Vertical Velocity, a re-theme of Vertical Velocity, DC Super-Villains Swing, a re-theme of Whirligig and Aquaman Splashdown, a re-theme of Yankee Clipper. Opening day of DC Universe was slated for April 15, 2022, when the park opened, but due to &quot;excessive rain and supply chain issues,&quot; the area would open later in spring. DC Universe opened on April 23, 2022.

Additionally, in 2022, the stunt show &quot;Kinetic&quot; premiered on June 25, 2022, and ended on August 7, 2022, in the Grand Music Hall. Running for 30 minutes in total, &quot;Kinetic&quot; is set in an urbanized-skate park setting and was produced and directed by entertainment manager David Major. The park had cast both local talent and entertainers from a New York entertainment group. Stunts during the show included BMX, kick scooter and trampoline acts. Along with the stunts, &quot;Kinetic&quot; also featured song and dance performances and featured multiple instances of audience interaction. &quot;Kinetic&quot; was in development since 2020, being the first summer production at the park since 2019.

In 2023, the park confirmed that Dare Devil Dive and Buccaneer Battle would be permanently closed, following removal from the park map. On August 30, 2023, the park announced that Sky Striker, a large pendulum ride, would open in 2024. At the end of the 2023 season, the park announced that Revolution and Mardi Gras Hangover would be closed permanently. Both rides were subsequently bought and relocated to Niagara Amusement Park &amp; Splash World, where they remain in storage.

On August 15, 2024, the park announced the construction of a B&amp;M Dive Coaster on the former site of Buccaneer Battle for the 2025 season called Wrath of Rakshasa. The new coaster will set records for steepest drop (96 degrees) and most inversions (five) on a dive coaster.

In early November 2024, it was announced that Six Flags Great America would receive a new kids area for the 2026 season.

==Areas and attractions==

The overall layout of Six Flags Great America has remained mostly unchanged from the original design that was created for Marriott. The park&#x27;s designer, Randall Duell, followed the pattern of his trademark &quot;Duell loop&quot;, creating a series of themed areas around a path which winds around the park circularly, allowing space for employees and maintenance workers to work out of sight of guests in the middle.

When the park opened in 1976, it had five original areas:
* Hometown Square, which resembled an American town in the 1920s.
* The Great Midwest Livestock Exposition and County Fair, which represented a county fair in the 20th century.
* Yukon Territory, representing the Klondike Gold Rush.
* Yankee Harbor, representing a New England harbor.
* Orleans Place, which represented New Orleans in the 1850s.

Six Flags Great America, in total, features twelve themed areas. From the park&#x27;s main entrance, entering into Carousel Plaza; proceeding counterclockwise, the themed areas are:
* Carousel Plaza, the entrance plaza to Six Flags Great America.
* Hometown Square, representing an American town.
* Hometown Park, a small kids area within Hometown Square featuring three original rides opening in 2015, placed near its former spot in 1976.
* County Fair, originally The Great Midwest Livestock Exposition and County Fair, now shortened to County Fair.
* Kidzopolis, a themed area for kids (formerly Wiggles World from 2007 to 2010).
* Southwest Territory, a themed area representing a Wild West town opening in 1996 (a portion was cut off into Metropolis Plaza).
* Metropolis Plaza, a DC Comics themed mini-area representing the fictional DC Comics city Metropolis, which holds Justice League: Battle for Metropolis (formerly Southwest Territory Amphitheater).
* Yukon Territory, representing the Klondike Gold Rush.
* Camp Cartoon, a cartoon-themed area for kids (formerly Camp Cartoon Network from 1990s to 2018).
* DC Universe, a DC Comics themed area (formerly Yankee Harbor from 1976 to 2021).
* Mardi Gras, formerly a section from Orleans Place, the area is themed to the Mardi Gras holiday.
* Orleans Place, a Southern themed area closely based on the French Quarter (part of the section was broken into Mardi Gras).

===Carousel Plaza===
The front entrance area to the park. In addition to the rides, there are shops and food kiosks themed to the area.
===Orleans Place===

Orleans Place is themed around New Orleans in the late 1800s, specifically the historic French Quarter. The area opened as an original area in 1976, and part of the area was later divided into Mardi Gras in 2004, connecting thematically to the area.

Rue Le Dodge is the last original ride from 1976 in the themed area. Other original attractions from the parks&#x27; opening placed in the area were removed, such as Gulf Coaster, a kids coaster placed in the area which is now occupied by Mardi Gras, which closed in 1977 due to multiple fires which plagued the ride.

Some other removed attractions would also include The Edge, which was removed in 1986, Traffique Jam and Orleans Orbit, which were both removed to make way for White Water Rampage. The latter was later moved to Hometown Square, before its removal in 2016 to make way for The Lobster, an original ride from Yankee Harbor.

===Mardi Gras===

One of the park&#x27;s newest themed areas, it opened in 2004, after being converted from part of Orleans Place. The area&#x27;s theme comes from the Mardi Gras holiday and specifically the famous celebration of the holiday in New Orleans.

When Mardi Gras opened, it featured four rides: Big Easy Balloons, a Zamperla &quot;Balloon Race&quot; attraction; King Chaos, a top spin attraction; Jester&#x27;s Wild Ride, a &quot;Rockin&#x27; Tug&quot; attraction; and Roaring Rapids, an Intamin river rapids ride which originally opened in Orleans Place in 1983.

Changes for the area started in 2016 when the park announced The Joker. The original covered bridge used for entry to the former Yankee Harbor was moved to make way for the new attraction. Additionally, Jester&#x27;s Wild Ride was removed for the attraction. The next change came the following year, in 2017, when King Chaos was announced to be closed to build Mardi Gras Hangover, an attraction in which was the tallest Larson Loop in the world, although the park claimed it was the tallest &quot;loop coaster.&quot; Mardi Gras Hangover was removed after the 2023 season.
===DC Universe===
DC Universe opened as Yankee Harbor in 1976, a 19th-century New England themed town, closely based on Cape Cod. Yankee Harbor, throughout the year, had changed more than the other original themed areas, with the removal of multiple original attractions, and a focus on more DC Comics themed rides.

The area changed in 2022, when it became DC Universe, a DC Comics themed area. The area re-used attraction names from other Six Flags parks for the re-theme of some of the original non-DC themed rides.
===Yukon Territory===
This area is themed around the famous forests and mountains in northwest Canada, with references to logging, prospecting and gold panning, specifically the Klondike Gold Rush.

Yukon Territory formerly held &quot;Bugs Bunny National Park&quot; that opened in 1998, but was fully replaced with Winner&#x27;s Circle Go Karts, an upcharge attraction, in 2012. Many buildings in the area that originally opened are now closed, and most props in the area have been removed.
====Camp Cartoon====

This is a sub-section of Yukon Territory. It was known as &quot;Camp Cartoon Network&quot; when first added in 1998. Despite the former name, the rides were themed to Hanna-Barbera properties and not Cartoon Network ones.
===Metropolis Plaza===
The smallest themed area of the park, based on DC Comics characters. It replaced the Southwest Amphitheater in 2016.
===County Fair===

&quot;The Great Midwest Livestock Exposition at County Fair&quot;, almost always known simply as County Fair, is an original themed area located in back of the park, and is the largest themed area. There are many shops, stalls and attractions set in a theme based on a rural county fair. The area also features a food court and a gallery of carnival games.

Some former attractions located in County Fair includes Ameri-Go-Round, a smaller carousel which was replaced with Revolution in 2003, Barney Oldfield Speedway, a car attraction named after American racer Barney Oldfield, which was later replaced with X-Flight, and the Sky Whirl, which was a triple-arm Ferris wheel, which was removed to make way for Déjà Vu. Both Buccaneer Battle and Dare Devil Dive were marked as permanently closed in 2023.

====Kidzopolis====

A children&#x27;s-specific area of County Fair, located in front of the American Eagle entrance. Originally known as Wiggles World, the area was added for 2007. The Wiggles theming was removed after the 2010 season.
===Hometown Square===

One of the park&#x27;s original areas, themed after a small midwestern town around the turn of the century. Guests walk through many shops and stalls and can ride many classic carnival-style rides.

Whizzer, a Schwarzkopf spiral-lift coaster, is one of the last of its kind in the world. Hometown Square includes two show venues – the Grand Music Hall, an indoor theater, which at the park&#x27;s opening, featured 1,600 seats, and the Hometown Square Stage, a stage on the Scenic Railway Station.

Attractions that once stood in Hometown Square includes Bottoms Up, a Chance Rides trabant ride which was an original ride near Demon before it was removed in 1983, and The Orbit. The Orbit was a Schwarzkopf enterprise ride which was also an original ride, originally in Orleans Place, before it was moved into Hometown Square, replacing Bottoms Up. The Orbit was removed in 2016 to make way for The Lobster, which was being moved from Yankee Harbor to make way for The Joker.
====Hometown Park====
This area is a sub-section of Hometown Square. This section previously existed from the park&#x27;s opening in 1976 until the rides were removed after the 2001 season. In 2015, three of the original rides returned as part of the park&#x27;s 40th season celebration.
===Southwest Territory===

Originally intended to be built in 1979 as The Great Southwest, the area, themed around an old Wild West town, was built in 1996. The area is outside of the park&#x27;s loop, connected to both Hometown Square and County Fair. It also had the primary connection to Hurricane Harbor Chicago prior to the parks separating admission.

===Hurricane Harbor Chicago===

Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Chicago is a water park located adjacent to Six Flags Great America that originally opened in 2005 under the Six Flags Hurricane Harbor naming. The water park features 25 water slides and attractions throughout the water park. On March 22, 2021, the water park was announced to be separately gated from the amusement park.

== Annual events ==

=== Fright Fest ===
On weekends in September and October, Six Flags Great America features its annual Halloween event &quot;Fright Fest&quot;. The event started small in the early nineties and has expanded significantly since then. During the event the park is decorated into several different &quot;Scare Zones&quot; featuring haunted houses, frightening street characters, Halloween themed shows, as well as transformed rides. Fright Fest features haunted houses, which are usually an additional fee. Some haunted houses include &quot;Condemned,&quot; a haunted house introduced in 2021, based on an underground laboratory and &quot;Bloodshed,&quot; which is based on an evil lumberjack. Some other haunted houses include Big Top Terror, Gates of Hell, the 13th Order and Manslaughter Manor. Many of the park&#x27;s rides receive special theming and operate differently than usual. Chubasco, the park&#x27;s teacup ride, is transformed into Terror Twister 2: A Turn for the Worse, in which the ride building is enclosed and a custom lighting design matched with a custom club style music mix is played. Condor, one of the park&#x27;s flat rides, is renamed during the event as The Birds and The Pit and runs a different cycle.

Fright Fest also features shows and performances throughout the park. &quot;Love at First Fright&quot; has been presented in the Grand Music Hall every year since the event&#x27;s inception and follows the story of a couple on a dare to spend the night in a cemetery who get caught up in crazy antics when several classic Halloween creatures rise from the grave. The show often plays to capacity audiences during the event, and it is known for changing the show each year to include various pop culture and newsworthy references. The show has won multiple awards from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions for Best Overall Production. Another show, &quot;The Ringmaster&#x27;s Cabaret&quot;, is described as a &quot;freak show&quot; which mixes in illusions with singing and dancing, and is also presented at the Grand Music Hall. Past shows include &quot;Susan Rosan&quot;featuring a hypnotist who performed in the event for many years until 2018, &quot;Mundaka&quot;, a show held in the former Theatre Royale and &quot;The Damsel and the Warlock&quot;, in the Snowshoe Saloon. For several years a third party called JPM Productions provided street characters and haunted house actors for the event. While the company was praised for its costumes and makeup, in 2010 Six Flags moved the entire production in-house for greater creative control.

=== Holiday in the Park ===

In 2015, Jim Reid-Anderson had teased the arrival of Holiday in the Park, a Christmas-oriented event. Anderson stated that Six Flags would &quot;see if [Holiday in the Park] makes sense&quot; at the park. A promotion for the announcement of Holiday in the Park started in April 2018, and was called the 4-1-1. On April 11, 2018, Six Flags Great America announced that it would stay open through the end of the year with an event called Holiday in the Park. The new event began on November 23, 2018, and ran weekends through December 23, 2018, and ran daily December 26 through December 31, 2018. Holiday in the Park was developed and produced by RWS Entertainment Group, creating multiple light shows throughout the park.
Starting for the 2020 season, Holiday in the Park Lights began as a replacement for the regular Holiday in the Park event. Due to Illinois&#x27; guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic at that time, rides could not operate. In 2021, though, the park re-opened indoor venues and some attractions. In addition to Holiday in the Park Lights, Six Flags also ran the Holiday in the Park Drive-Thru for both the 2020 and 2021 season, operating weekdays, while the regular Holiday in the Park Lights event ran on weekends. The park removed Holiday in the Park from their event lineup for the 2022 season, and the park closed for the rest of winter.

Holiday in the Park featured multiple shows, one of which were &quot;A Wonderland at the Grand,&quot; a holiday-themed musical held in the Grand Music Hall. During the 2020 season, the show was re-imagined as &quot;Wonderland&quot;, and was held outdoors at the Hometown Square Stage. Other shows included &quot;The Holidays Bake Me Crazy&quot;, a show based on baking for the holidays. Holiday carolers named &quot;The MistleTones&quot; also walked around the park, singing holiday songs. One of the main features were the holiday lights. The light show &quot;Kalightoscope&quot; was held at Southwest Territory (also named &quot;Kalightoscope&quot;), on both the Chubasco mission building and Giant Drop. &quot;Elegance&quot; was another light show and was shown on the Columbia Carousel. Over 2,500,000 lights were strung up each season on park buildings and trees.

== Attendance ==

=== Marriott operation ===
Under operation of the Marriott Corporation, Marriott had expected 2.5 million visitors for the 1976 season. The Marriott Corporation had also expected 25,000 to 30,000 guests to visit daily. Due to the close radius of Chicago, Illinois, Rockford, Illinois and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, it was estimated that the park could draw 6 million to 7 million guests within the area. Marriott had closely reached its attendance goal of 2.5 million guests, with 2.35 million guests in 1976 and 2.4 million guests in the following year, 1977. With the rising attendance of the amusement park, it had also affected the attendance of neighboring amusement parks, including Old Chicago, in which guest numbers plummeted and later led to the closure of the shopping mall and amusement park in 1980 after the opening of Marriott&#x27;s Great America.

=== Six Flags operation ===
Under park policy, Six Flags Great America does not release attendance figures. However, the Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) estimates attendance numbers for the amusement park.
==Records and awards==

=== Records ===
Multiple Six Flags Great America attractions broke records and first-of-its-kinds when it opened in various categories. The first of these were American Eagle, opening as the tallest, fastest and longest wooden racing roller coaster in the world when it opened in 1981. The next one was Shockwave, opening in 1988, which, at the time, was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in the world, along with breaking the world record for most inversions on a roller coaster. Batman: The Ride opened in 1992 as the first inverted roller coaster in the world, which was manufactured by Bolliger &amp; Mabillard.

Goliath claimed three Guinness World Records at its opening in 2014, as the steepest wooden roller coaster, longest drop on a wooden roller coaster and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world; retaining the latter two.

The following year, Maxx Force opened with three record breakers with having the fastest acceleration in North America from 0 to in 1.8 seconds, fastest inversion (heartline roll) in the world at and tallest double inversion in the world at .

=== Awards ===
Some of Six Flags Great America&#x27;s roller coasters have appeared on &quot;Amusement Today&quot;&#x27;s annual Golden Ticket Awards multiple times, with the ride ranking the highest on the Golden Ticket Awards being Raging Bull placing 9th in 2005. For American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE) awards, two roller coasters at Six Flags Great America have been designated as Coaster Landmark status, an award reserved for rides of significance to amusement parks. The first of these were Batman: The Ride, which was awarded the Coaster Landmark status on June 20, 2005, for its significance as the first inverted roller coaster to open to the public. The next award was given to Whizzer on August 10, 2012, for the parks preservation of the attraction. Additionally, Little Dipper was granted the ACE Coaster Classic award, an award for historic roller coasters that has been well maintained similarly to its original form.

The Fright Fest show &quot;Love at First Fright&quot; has won multiple International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) awards. In 2005, 2007 and 2008, the show won the IAAPA Big E! Award for &quot;Best Overall Production: $25,000 or less.&quot; Additionally in 2008, the show &quot;Show Stoppin&quot;&#x27; won the Big E!

In 2023, Six Flags Great America was a finalist for the IAAPA Honors Award for Best New Menu Item in 2023–2024 for their tanghulu.

== Incidents and accidents ==

There were multiple instances of incidents and accidents taking place at Six Flags Great America. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) had revealed that in two separate instances, a total of 31 guests had been injured on Whizzer in an investigation in 1980. These injuries were not reported to CPSC. During a private event rented out by U.S. Steel, Demon had stalled on a vertical loop on April 19, 1998, and had required an aerial fire apparatus to release stranded riders. A drive-by shooting occurred on August 14, 2022, injuring three people, which caused an evacuation of the entire park.

As of May 4, 2023, five people have lost their lives in reported accidents at Six Flags Great America. Three of the deaths occurring at the theme park were determined to have been caused by pre-existing medical conditions or natural causes. One theme park employee suffered fatal injuries when he fell from Splashwater Falls during the ride&#x27;s demolition in 2008 and a second employee was struck and killed by the Ragin&#x27; Cajun roller coaster the day after it first opened.

==In popular culture==
In the late 1970s, two TV specials were produced to feature the Marriott theme park in Gurnee, Illinois, both produced by WLS-TV (ABC 7 Chicago). To celebrate the opening of Marriott&#x27;s Great America (now Six Flags), &quot;Celebration At Great America&quot; first aired on July 2, 1976, and again on August 21. The special starred Steve Edwards and Sandi Freeman of WLS-TV. Celebrity Guests included Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny (and other Looney Tunes characters), Jo Anne Worley, Forrest Tucker, Jerry Stiller, Roger Perry and the Cast Members of Great America. Although in poor quality, the special can be found on YouTube.

Another special, titled &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Old,&quot; first aired on September 8, 1979, and again on April 26, 1980; hosted by actress Lisa Hartman.

In 1977, the park&#x27;s circus show, &quot;Circus Fantastic&quot;, had one of its performances broadcast on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; with Captain Kangaroo (Bob Keeshan) himself as the ringmaster and special guest star Bob Denver of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; fame. In 1994, Iron Wolf was featured in the movie &quot;Richie Rich&quot; and was showcased as a backyard coaster. On August 26, 2009, the park was featured on &quot;&quot; where host Robert Irvine creates a meal for coaster enthusiasts to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Raging Bull. In a 2013 episode of &quot;Insane Coaster Wars&quot;, the park&#x27;s B&amp;M wing coaster X-Flight was featured as a contestant against other roller coasters around the world. In that same year, the park was featured in the Hindi movie &quot;.&quot; In July 2015, BTS filmed an episode of their variety show Run BTS in the park and the members rode various rides during their time.

<text>OMA SpecWorks, previously the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), is a standards organization which develops open, international technical standards for the mobile phone industry. It is a nonprofit Non-governmental organization (NGO), not a formal government-sponsored standards organization as is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU): a forum for industry stakeholders to agree on common specifications for products and services.

==History==
The OMA was created in June 2002 as an answer to the proliferation of industry forums each dealing with a few application protocols: WAP Forum (focused on browsing and device provisioning protocols), the Wireless Village (focused on instant messaging and presence), The SyncML Initiative (focused on data synchronization), the Location Interoperability Forum, the Mobile Games Interoperability Forum, and the Mobile Wireless Internet Forum. Each of these forums had its bylaws, its decision-taking procedures, its release schedules, and in some instances there was some overlap in the specifications, causing duplication of work.

Members include traditional wireless industry players such as equipment and mobile systems manufacturers (Ericsson, ZTE, Nokia, Qualcomm, Rohde &amp; Schwarz) and mobile operators (AT&amp;T, NTT Docomo, Orange, T-Mobile, Verizon), and also software vendors (Gemalto, Mavenir and others).

In March, 2018, it merged with the IPSO Alliance to form OMA SpecWorks.

Related standards bodies include: 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

Its mission is to provide Interoperability of services across countries, operators and mobile terminals.
The OMA only standardises applicative protocols; OMA specifications are intended to work with any cellular network technologies being used to provide networking and data transport. These networking technology are specified by outside parties. In particular, OMA specifications for a given function are the same with either GSM, UMTS, or CDMA2000 networks.
Adherence to the standards is entirely voluntary; the OMA does not have a mandative role..
OMA members that own intellectual property rights (e.g. patents) on technologies that are essential to realizing a specification agree in advance to provide licenses to their technology on &quot;fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing&quot; terms to other members.
OMA is incorporated in California, United States.

== Standard specifications ==
The OMA maintains many specifications, including:
* Browsing specifications, now named &quot;Browser and Content&quot;, formerly named WAP browsing; in current version, these specifications rely essentially on XHTML Mobile Profile
* Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) specifications
* OMA DRM specifications for digital rights management
* OMA Instant Messaging and Presence Service (OMA IMPS) specification, which is a system for instant messaging on mobile phones; formerly named Wireless Village
* OMA SIMPLE IM instant messaging based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) SIMPLE
* OMA CAB Converged Address Book, a social address book service standard
* OMA CPM Converged IP Messaging, the underlying enabler for Rich Communication Services
* OMA Lock and Wipe (LAWMO) specifications for those functions
* OMA Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) OMA LWM2M specifications for machine to machine functions
* OMA Client Provisioning (OMA CP) specification for provisioning
* OMA Data Synchronization (OMA DS) specification for data synchronization using SyncML
* OMA Device Management (OMA DM) specification for mobile device management using SyncML
* OMA BCAST specification for Mobile Broadcast Services
* OMA Rich Media Environment (RME) specification
* OMA OpenCMAPI Connection Management APIs
* OMA PoC specification for Push to talk Over Cellular (PoC)
* OMA Presence SIMPLE specification for presence based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) SIMPLE
* OMA Service Environment
* FUMO Firmware update
* Secure User Plane Location Protocol (SUPL), an IP-based service for assisted GPS on handsets
* Mobile Location Protocol (MLP), an IP-based protocol for obtaining the position/location of mobile handset
* Wireless Application Protocol 1 (WAP1), 5-layer stack of protocols
* OMA LOCSIP Location in SIP/IP Core
*Software Component Management Object (SCOMO), allows a management authority to perform software management on a remote device

The OMA specifications inspired or formed the base for the following:
* NGSI-LD is an API and information model specified by ETSI based (with permission) on OMA specifications NGSI-09 and NGSI-10, extending them to provide bindings and to formally use property graphs, with node and relationship (edge) types that may play the role of labels in formerly-mentioned models &quot;and&quot; support semantic referencing by inheriting classes defined in shared ontologies.

<text>Travelers&#x27; diarrhea (TD) is a stomach and intestinal infection. TD is defined as the passage of unformed stool (one or more by some definitions, three or more by others) while traveling. It may be accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, fever, headache and bloating. Occasionally dysentery may occur. Most travelers recover within three to four days with little or no treatment. About 12% of people may have symptoms for a week.
Bacteria are responsible for more than half of cases, typically via foodborne illness and waterborne diseases. The bacteria enterotoxigenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (ETEC) are typically the most common except in Southeast Asia, where &quot;Campylobacter&quot; is more prominent. About 10 to 20 percent of cases are due to norovirus. Protozoa such as &quot;Giardia&quot; may cause longer term disease. The risk is greatest in the first two weeks of travel and among young adults. People affected are more often from the developed world.
Recommendations for prevention include eating only properly cleaned and cooked food, drinking bottled water, and frequent hand washing. The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for cholera, is of questionable use for travelers&#x27; diarrhea. Preventive antibiotics are generally discouraged. Primary treatment includes rehydration and replacing lost salts (oral rehydration therapy). Antibiotics are recommended for significant or persistent symptoms, and can be taken with loperamide to decrease diarrhea. Hospitalization is required in less than 3 percent of cases.
Estimates of the percentage of people affected range from 20 to 50 percent among travelers to the developing world. TD is particularly common among people traveling to Asia (except for Japan and Singapore), the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Central and South America. The risk is moderate in Southern Europe, and Russia. TD has been linked to later irritable bowel syndrome and Guillain–Barré syndrome. It has colloquially been known by a number of names, including &quot;Montezuma&#x27;s revenge,&quot; “mummy tummy” and &quot;Delhi belly&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
The onset of TD usually occurs within the first week of travel, but may occur at any time while traveling, and even after returning home, depending on the incubation period of the infectious agent. Bacterial TD typically begins abruptly, but &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; may incubate for seven days, and &quot;Giardia&quot; for 14 days or more, before symptoms develop. Typically, a traveler experiences four to five loose or watery bowel movements each day. Other commonly associated symptoms are abdominal cramping, bloating, fever, and malaise. Appetite may decrease significantly. Though unpleasant, most cases of TD are mild, and resolve in a few days without medical intervention.

Blood or mucus in the diarrhea, significant abdominal pain, or high fever suggests a more serious cause, such as cholera, characterized by a rapid onset of weakness and torrents of watery diarrhea with flecks of mucus (described as &quot;rice water&quot; stools). Medical care should be sought in such cases; dehydration is a serious consequence of cholera, and may trigger serious sequelae—including, in rare instances, death—as rapidly as 24 hours after onset if not addressed promptly.

==Causes==

Infectious agents are the primary cause of travelers&#x27; diarrhea. Bacterial enteropathogens cause about 80% of cases. Viruses and protozoans account for most of the rest.

The most common causative agent isolated in countries surveyed has been enterotoxigenic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (ETEC). Enteroaggregative &quot;E. coli&quot; is increasingly recognized. &quot;Shigella&quot; spp. and &quot;Salmonella&quot; spp. are other common bacterial pathogens. &quot;Campylobacter&quot;, &quot;Yersinia&quot;, &quot;Aeromonas&quot;, and &quot;Plesiomonas&quot; spp. are less frequently found. Mechanisms of action vary: some bacteria release toxins which bind to the intestinal wall and cause diarrhea; others damage the intestines themselves by their direct presence.

Brachyspira pilosicoli pathogen also appears to be responsible for many chronic intermittent watery diarrhea and is only diagnosed through colonic biopsies and microscopic discovery of a false brush border on H&amp;E or Warthin silver stain: its brush-border is stronger and longer that Brachyspira aalborgi&#x27;s brush-border. It is unfortunately often not diagnosed as coproculture does not allow growth and 16S PCR panel primers do not match Brachyspira sequences.

While viruses are associated with less than 20% of adult cases of travelers&#x27; diarrhea, they may be responsible for nearly 70% of cases in infants and children. Diarrhea due to viral agents is unaffected by antibiotic therapy, but is usually self-limited. Protozoans such as &quot;Giardia lamblia&quot;, &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; and &quot;Cyclospora cayetanensis&quot; can also cause diarrhea. Pathogens commonly implicated in travelers&#x27; diarrhea appear in the table in this section.

A subtype of travelers&#x27; diarrhea afflicting hikers and campers, sometimes known as wilderness diarrhea, may have a somewhat different frequency of distribution of pathogens.

===Risk factors===
The primary source of infection is ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water. Attack rates are similar for men and women.

The most important determinant of risk is the traveler&#x27;s destination. High-risk destinations include developing countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Among backpackers, additional risk factors include drinking untreated surface water and failure to maintain personal hygiene practices and clean cookware. Campsites often have very primitive (if any) sanitation facilities, making them potentially as dangerous as any developing country.

Although travelers&#x27; diarrhea usually resolves within three to five days (mean duration: 3.6 days), in about 20% of cases, the illness is severe enough to require bedrest, and in 10%, the illness duration exceeds one week. For those prone to serious infections, such as bacillary dysentery, amoebic dysentery, and cholera, TD can occasionally be life-threatening. Others at higher-than-average risk include young adults, immunosuppressed persons, persons with inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes, and those taking H2 blockers or antacids.

===Immunity===
Travelers often get diarrhea from eating and drinking foods and beverages that have no adverse effects on local residents. This is due to immunity that develops with constant, repeated exposure to pathogenic organisms. The extent and duration of exposure necessary to acquire immunity has not been determined; it may vary with each individual organism. A study among expatriates in Nepal suggests that immunity may take up to seven years to develop—presumably in adults who avoid deliberate pathogen exposure.
Conversely, immunity acquired by American students while living in Mexico disappeared, in one study, as quickly as eight weeks after cessation of exposure.

==Prevention==

===Sanitation===
Recommendations include avoidance of questionable foods and drinks, on the assumption that TD is fundamentally a sanitation failure, leading to bacterial contamination of drinking water and food. While the effectiveness of this strategy has been questioned, given that travelers have little or no control over sanitation in hotels and restaurants, and little evidence supports the contention that food vigilance reduces the risk of contracting TD, guidelines continue to recommend basic, common-sense precautions when making food and beverage choices:
* Maintain good hygiene and use only safe water for drinking and brushing teeth.
* Safe beverages include bottled water, bottled carbonated beverages, and water boiled or appropriately treated by the traveler (as described below). Caution should be exercised with tea, coffee, and other hot beverages that may be only heated, not boiled.
* In restaurants, insist that bottled water be unsealed in your presence; reports of locals filling empty bottles with untreated tap water and reselling them as purified water have surfaced. When in doubt, a bottled carbonated beverage is the safest choice, since it is difficult to simulate carbonation when refilling a used bottle.
* Avoid ice, which may not have been made with safe water.
* Avoid green salads, because the lettuce and other uncooked ingredients are unlikely to have been washed with safe water.
* Avoid eating raw fruits and vegetables unless cleaned and peeled personally.

If handled properly, thoroughly cooked fresh and packaged foods are usually safe. Raw or undercooked meat and seafood should be avoided. Unpasteurized milk, dairy products, mayonnaise, and pastry icing are associated with increased risk for TD, as are foods and beverages purchased from street vendors and other establishments where unhygienic conditions may be present.

===Water===
Although safe bottled water is now widely available in most remote destinations, travelers can treat their own water if necessary, or as an extra precaution.
Techniques include boiling, filtering, chemical treatment, and ultraviolet light; boiling is by far the most effective of these methods. Boiling rapidly kills all active bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. Prolonged boiling is usually unnecessary; most microorganisms are killed within seconds at water temperature above . The second-most effective method is to combine filtration and chemical disinfection. Filters eliminate most bacteria and protozoa, but not viruses. Chemical treatment with halogens—chlorine bleach, tincture of iodine, or commercial tablets—have low-to-moderate effectiveness against protozoa such as &quot;Giardia&quot;, but work well against bacteria and viruses.
UV light is effective against both viruses and cellular organisms, but only works in clear water, and it is ineffective unless manufacturer&#x27;s instructions are carefully followed for maximum water depth/distance from UV source, and for dose/exposure time. Other claimed advantages include short treatment time, elimination of the need for boiling, no taste alteration, and decreased long-term cost compared with bottled water. The effectiveness of UV devices is reduced when water is muddy or turbid; as UV is a type of light, any suspended particles create shadows that hide microorganisms from UV exposure.

===Medications===
Bismuth subsalicylate four times daily reduces rates of travelers&#x27; diarrhea. Though many travelers find a four-times-per-day regimen inconvenient, lower doses are not effective. Potential side effects include black tongue, black stools, nausea, constipation, and ringing in the ears. Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken by those with aspirin allergy, kidney disease, or gout, nor concurrently with certain antibiotics such as the quinolones, and should not be taken continuously for more than three weeks. Some countries do not recommend it due to the risk of rare but serious side effects.

A hyperimmune bovine colostrum to be taken by mouth is marketed in Australia for prevention of ETEC-induced TD. As yet, no studies show efficacy under actual travel conditions.

Though effective, antibiotics are not recommended for the prevention of TD in most situations because of the risk of allergy or adverse reactions to the antibiotics, and because intake of preventive antibiotics may decrease the effectiveness of such drugs should a serious infection develop subsequently. Antibiotics can also cause vaginal yeast infections, or overgrowth of the bacterium &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;, leading to pseudomembranous colitis and its associated severe, unrelenting diarrhea.

Antibiotics may be warranted in special situations where benefits outweigh the above risks, such as immunocompromised travelers, chronic intestinal disorders, prior history of repeated disabling bouts of TD, or scenarios in which the onset of diarrhea might prove particularly troublesome. Options for prophylactic treatment include the fluoroquinolone antibiotics (such as ciprofloxacin), azithromycin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, though the latter has proved less effective in recent years. Rifaximin may also be useful. Quinolone antibiotics may bind to metallic cations such as bismuth, and should not be taken concurrently with bismuth subsalicylate. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should not be taken by anyone with a history of sulfa allergy.

===Vaccination===
The oral cholera vaccine, while effective for prevention of cholera, is of questionable use for prevention of TD. A 2008 review found tentative evidence of benefit. A 2015 review stated it may be reasonable for those at high risk of complications from TD. Several vaccine candidates targeting ETEC or &quot;Shigella&quot; are in various stages of development.

===Probiotics===
One 2007 review found that probiotics may be safe and effective for prevention of TD, while another review found no benefit. A 2009 review confirmed that more study is needed, as the evidence to date is mixed.

==Treatment==
Most cases of TD are mild and resolve in a few days without treatment, but severe or protracted cases may result in significant fluid loss and dangerous electrolytic imbalance. Dehydration due to diarrhea can also alter the effectiveness of medicinal and contraceptive drugs. Adequate fluid intake (oral rehydration therapy) is therefore a high priority. Commercial rehydration drinks are widely available; alternatively, purified water or other clear liquids are recommended, along with salty crackers or oral rehydration salts (available in stores and pharmacies in most countries) to replenish lost electrolytes. Carbonated water or soda, left open to allow dissipation of the carbonation, is useful when nothing else is available. In severe or protracted cases, the oversight of a medical professional is advised.

===Antibiotics===
If diarrhea becomes severe (typically defined as three or more loose stools in an eight-hour period), especially if associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, fever, or blood in stools, medical treatment should be sought. Such patients may benefit from antimicrobial therapy. A 2000 literature review found that antibiotic treatment shortens the duration and severity of TD; most reported side effects were minor, or resolved on stopping the antibiotic.

The antibiotic recommended varies based upon the destination of travel. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are no longer recommended because of high levels of resistance to these agents. Antibiotics are typically given for three to five days, but single doses of azithromycin or levofloxacin have been used. Rifaximin and rifamycin are approved in the U.S. for treatment of TD caused by ETEC. If diarrhea persists despite therapy, travelers should be evaluated for bacterial strains resistant to the prescribed antibiotic, possible viral or parasitic infections, bacterial or amoebic dysentery, &quot;Giardia&quot;, helminths, or cholera.

===Antimotility agents===
Antimotility drugs such as loperamide and diphenoxylate reduce the symptoms of diarrhea by slowing transit time in the gut. They may be taken to slow the frequency of stools, but not enough to stop bowel movements completely, which delays expulsion of the causative organisms from the intestines. They should be avoided in patients with fever, bloody diarrhea, and possible inflammatory diarrhea. Adverse reactions may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hives or rash, and loss of appetite. Antimotility agents should not, as a rule, be taken by children under age two.

==Epidemiology==
An estimated 10 million people—20 to 50% of international travelers—develop TD each year. It is more common in the developing world, where rates exceed 60%, but has been reported in some form in virtually every travel destination in the world.

==Society and culture==
Moctezuma&#x27;s revenge is a colloquial term for travelers&#x27; diarrhea contracted in Mexico. The name refers to Moctezuma II (1466–1520), the Tlatoani (ruler) of the Aztec civilization who was overthrown by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in the early 16th century, thereby bringing large portions of what is now Mexico and Central America under the rule of the Spanish crown. The relevance being that Cortés and his soldiers carried the smallpox virus, to which Mexicans had never been exposed. The resulting infection reduced the population of Tenochtitlan by 40 percent in 1520 alone.

==Wilderness diarrhea==

Wilderness diarrhea, also called wilderness-acquired diarrhea (WAD) or backcountry diarrhea, refers to diarrhea among backpackers, hikers, campers and other outdoor recreationalists in wilderness or backcountry situations, either at home or abroad. It is caused by the same fecal microorganisms as other forms of travelers&#x27; diarrhea, usually bacterial or viral. Since wilderness campsites seldom provide access to sanitation facilities, the infection risk is similar to that of any developing country. Water treatment, good hygiene, and dish washing have all been shown to reduce the incidence of WAD.

<text>How to Survive a Marriage is an American soap opera that aired on the NBC television network from January 7, 1974 to April 18, 1975. The serial was created by Anne Howard Bailey, with much input from then-NBC Vice President Lin Bolen. The show&#x27;s working title was &quot;From This Moment&quot; and was an in-house NBC production.

A total of 332 episodes were produced (255 in its first season, and 77 in its final season).

==Synopsis==
Larry and his wife Christine (nicknamed &quot;Chris,&quot; played by Jennifer Harmon) soon divorced and while battling for custody of their daughter Lori, Chris entered the workforce. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1975, Chris and Larry remarried, and she then battled alcoholism.

Initially, the show featured veteran soap actress Rosemary Prinz in the role of Dr. Julie Franklin, a staunch feminist who counseled her friends on the joys of being an independent woman, only to decide that her life was truly complete by marrying a man. Prinz only agreed to stay on the show for a short time (as she had with &quot;All My Children&quot; several years earlier), and earned top billing, a three-day work week, and supposedly $1,000 an episode, which was a big salary for a soap actress to earn in the 1970s. After six months Julie left town to marry Dr. Tony DeAngelo.

Another major story centered on Fran Bachman (Fran Brill) coping with sudden widowhood. Brill received over a thousand letters of condolence from viewers.

==Ratings and cancellation==
The show did not profit from the large lead-in that the high-rated &quot;Another World&quot; provided, mostly due to its many attempts to be socially relevant, which usually took the place of traditional storytelling to which American soap viewers at the time were acclimated. &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; ran a distant third in the 3:30 p.m. timeslot, behind &quot;Match Game&quot; on CBS (then daytime TV&#x27;s highest-rated program) and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; on ABC; a move to 1:30 p.m. on January 6, 1975 after the cancellation of the original version of the famed game &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (it was done to enable &quot;Another World&quot; to expand to an hour) only brought worse ratings, as it faced two longtime favorites on the competing networks, CBS&#x27; &quot;As the World Turns&quot; which was expanded to an hour (11 months later) and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal.&quot; Despite NBC&#x27;s high hopes for&quot; How to Survive a Marriage&quot; it would only last on the air for sixteen months, ending on a Thursday (the 1:30–3:00 p.m. block on NBC was preempted the following day for a 90-minute special, &quot;First Ladies&#x27; Diaries: Rachel Jackson&quot;). The following Monday April 21, 1975 &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; expanded to an hour and assumed the vacant half hour left in NBC&#x27;s daytime schedule.

&quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; thus holds a rather dubious distinction as not only the first soap opera to become a victim of the first daytime serial, its sister NBC soap &quot;Another World,&quot; expanding to a full hour, but the second one as well, &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot; Numerous other existing serials on ABC and CBS would expand to 60 minutes daily over the next five years or so, cutting down on the number of open 30-minute timeslots available, meaning few if any serials could be launched. This was a strategy employed to minimize risks of new 30-minute shows like &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot; failing to develop an audience in a timely enough manner to suit the networks and advertisers. Several other serials had been canceled over the previous several years due to that issue, including its two predecessors, &quot;Bright Promise&quot; and &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot;. However ABC was later successful with &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot;,&quot; Loving&quot;, as well as &quot;The Edge Of Night&quot; (which moved to ABC after being cancelled by CBS to allow &quot;As The World Turns&quot; to expand to an hour in December of 1975). All three shows held their own as half hour soaps until they were eventually cancelled. However both ABC &amp; NBC aired new half hour soaps in the 90&#x27;s NBC&#x27;s show Generations lasted two years 1989- 1991 before being canceled. ABC&#x27;s Loving Spinoff the City aired from 1995-1997. Being replaced by the General Hospital spinoff Port Charles which fared better, lasting six years from 1997- 2003. CBS however was successful with &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; which is still airing today as the only remaining half-hour soap on daytime television airing 37 years.

==Cast==
Fran Brill is now best-known for her work on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, where she performed Muppet characters, including Zoe and Prairie Dawn, from 1970 to 2014.

Other cast members included Ken Kercheval (Larry Kirby #2), F. Murray Abraham (Joshua Browne), Armand Assante (Johnny McGhee), and Brad Davis (Alexander Kronos).

==Awards and nominations==
The serial won Best Sequence at the third annual &quot;Afternoon TV Writers &amp; Editors Awards&quot;, for &quot;The Death of David Bachman.&quot; Fran Brill also won an award from the &quot;Afternoon TV Writers &amp; Editors&quot; for her portrayal of Fran Bachman during the same award-winning sequence.

<doc id="1045496" wikidata="Q7144466" url="?curid=1045496" title="Patent Busting Project">
<text>The Patent Busting Project is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression. The initiative launched on April 19, 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

The EFF&#x27;s basic assumption is that many such patents are invalid due to prior art which has historically been difficult to document in software and internet fields. (Many patent owners file patents to cover seemingly trivial concepts without any intention of enforcing the patents, but rather to use as part of a larger patent portfolio in their own defense against potential future patent lawsuits.)

== Status ==

The effort began with a &quot;patent busting contest&quot; where the public was encouraged to submit proposals of the worst offenders. Of these, EFF chose the top &quot;10 Most Wanted&quot; list of patents based on patent viability, whether the patent owners intend to enforce these patents, and how much of a threat they are to potential infringers.

By April 29, 2006, EFF had announced formal challenges to two of the listed patents: Test.com&#x27;s patent on administering online tests, and Clear Channel&#x27;s patent on recording and distributing CDs of live shows.

On October 23, 2007 The United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the EFF&#x27;s request for the reexamination of NeoMedia&#x27;s patent #6,199,048. The Office also granted request for the reexamination of Hoshiko&#x27;s (Ideaflood) patent #6,687,746 that covers the automation of subdomain registration.

On February 4, 2009, The United States Patent and Trademark Office upheld NeoMedia patent #6,199,048, although with limitations imposed upon the claimed material.

== Ten Most-wanted Patents ==
*Acacia Research: Audio and video receiving and transmission system 
*Clear Channel Entertainment: System and method of creating digital recordings of live performances
*Acceris: Method and apparatus for implementing a computer network/internet telephone system
*Sheldon F. Goldberg: System and method for playing games on a network
*Ideaflood: System apparatus and method for hosting and assigning domain names on a wide area network
*Neomedia Technologies: System and method for automatic access of a remote computer over a network
*Test.com: Method for administering tests, lessons, assessments
*Nintendo: Software implementation of a handheld videogame hardware platform 
*Firepond: System that uses natural language processing to respond to customers&#x27; online inquiries by email
*Seer Systems: System and method for generating, distributing, storing and performing musical work files

===Fate===
EFF lists Acacia Research and Firepond&#x27;s patents as having been made invalid, Ideaflood and Clear Channel&#x27;s as &quot;busted&quot;, NeoMedia and Seer Systems&#x27; have been &quot;narrowed&quot;, Acceris, Test.com and Sheldon F. Goldberg&#x27;s have &quot;Reexam granted&quot;. Only Nintendo&#x27;s patent of the original ten has no status update, but more are listed. Nintendo&#x27;s patent has since expired in 2022.

<doc id="1045500" wikidata="Q5116963" url="?curid=1045500" title="Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool">
<text>The Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas is the Anglican parish church of Liverpool. The site is said to have been a place of worship since at least the 1250s. The church is situated close to the River Mersey near the Pier Head. The Chapel of St Nicholas (Patron Saint of Sailors) was built on the site of St Mary del Quay, which in 1355 was determined to be too small for the growing borough of Liverpool. It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building, and is an active parish church in the diocese of Liverpool, the archdeaconry of Liverpool and the deanery of Liverpool North. It is part of the Greater Churches Group. From 1813 to 1868 the church was the tallest building in Liverpool at 174 feet [53 m], but then surpassed by the Welsh Presbyterian Church in Toxteth.

==St Mary del Quay==
In 1207 Liverpool received its charter from King John. By the 1250s a small stone chapel known as St Mary del Quay had been built (the first place of worship on the current site of the church). It probably stood near the site of the present tower, overlooking a quay on the River Mersey. The chapel was used as the main centre of worship until 1355. A new chapel dedicated to St Mary and St Nicholas was built on land granted to the burgesses by the Duke of Lancaster. It was under construction for more than a century.

In 1361 a plague hit the town and the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry licensed the burial ground. The chapel was consecrated the following year. By the late 15th century, a north aisle, the same size as the original nave, had been added, and three chantry altars had been established. Each chantry had its own priest paid for by a wealthy patron. In 1515 a fourth chantry was built.

==Reformation and beyond==
During the English Reformation, the chantries were abolished. The building was adapted in stages to suit the form of worship found in the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. Between 1673 and 1718, the building was extended piecemeal, and galleries were built to seat the increasing population of Liverpool. A spire was added in 1746.

In 1699 Liverpool, now with a population of about 5,000 people, was created an independent parish with (unusually) two parish churches and two rectors. Our Lady and St Nicholas (the &quot;Old Church&quot; or St Nicks) and the new parish church of St Peter&#x27;s were established as the parish churches. In 1775, the parish decided to rebuild the walls of the existing church. The galleries were kept, as the congregation paid pew rents. A new roof was set atop classical columns, which rested on medieval bases. The reconstructed church had walls four feet longer than the original structure.

By the year 1865, there were 27 churches in the parish, housing around 275,000 people. Since 1916 Our Lady and St Nicholas has been the Parish Church of Liverpool. St Peter&#x27;s, which was situated in Church Street, was demolished in 1922, having served as pro-cathedral for the Anglican Diocese of Liverpool.

==Fatal accident==
Over the years, as new churches were built, the &quot;Old Church&quot; continued to serve a congregation. Members repeatedly warned officials that the spire was unsafe. On Sunday 11 February 1810, as the bells rang and people were gathering for the morning service, the spire crashed into the nave below, killing 25 people. Twenty-one were under 15 years old, and most were girls from Moorfields Charity School. The original ring of six bells, dating from 1636 to 1724, was destroyed in the disaster. An eyewitness account is found in Stonehouse&#x27;s &quot;Recollections of Old Liverpool&quot;.

Between 1811 and 1815, a new tower and lantern were built at the north side of the church. The tower was designed by Thomas Harrison of Chester. The last remains of the original chapel of St Mary del Quay, which had been used as a tavern, were demolished. Within the tower, a new ring of 12 bells was installed, cast by Dobson of Downham Market. The Tenor bell was recast by Warners in 1912.

Over the years, several small changes were made to the church for liturgical reasons. The most notable changes occurred between 1851 and 1852. The Parish Centre was built in the 1920s to accommodate community life and a church school. Apart from these changes, the church remained the same between 1815 and 1940.


==Closure and transformation of the churchyard==
The churchyard used to be surrounded by walls. From 1758 to 1772, a battery of guns stood on an area of the burial ground (now covered by road) to defend the river. Until 1767, when Georges Dock was built where the Liver Building now stands, the River Mersey reached the church garden walls at high tide. In 1849 the churchyard was closed to burials. In 1891 it was transformed into a public garden in memory of James Harrison, whose shipping company had its offices facing the churchyard until the early 21st century.

==Destruction and rebuilding of the church==
During World War II, the bells were removed for safety, but they were never rehung. Following a German air raid on 21 December 1940, the main body of the church was destroyed by fire, leaving only the parish rooms, vestries and the 19th-century tower. Rebuilding did not begin until March 1949, and the completed church, dedicated to &#x27;Our Lady and St Nicholas&#x27;, was consecrated on 18 October 1952 (the Feast of St Luke). A new ring of 12 bells was cast by John Taylor and Co. of Loughborough.

The new church was designed by architect Edward C. Butler, who introduced major changes to its design. Rather than the traditional practice of placing the altar at the east end (for the light of the rising sun and to signify the Resurrection), Butler placed it at the western end of the church.
 Unlike churches in which the pulpit is traditionally the most prominent feature, Butler emphasised the sanctuary. He excluded the galleries, which had helped seat the historically large congregations. This decision reflected the smaller contemporary congregations. The nave was designed as 46 ft (14m) taller in the new church. The positions of the organ and Refectory were changed; situated above the Narthex (entrance vestibule), they reduced the seating space within the church.

==Exterior and interior detailing==

The exterior of the church is notable for its distinctive lantern spire, which can be easily spotted from the river, despite being overshadowed by many taller buildings of the city&#x27;s business district. The nave and the sanctuary house fixed woodwork carved with the vine as the dominant motif, referencing Christ: &quot;I am the vine, you are the branches&quot;. In the southeast corner of the church is a stained glass window: Our Lady stands in glory as in &quot;Revelation&quot; and St Nicholas holds a ship. An inscription reads: &quot;For the Healing of the Nations&quot;. A war memorial for the Cunard Steamship Company, placed in the church in 1989, is in the north east corner. The church organ is by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool, and is dedicated to the memory of Charles W. Bridson, organist 1902–1949. Hanging between the nave and the sanctuary is the Rood, a figure of Christ with Our Lady and St John. The Rood is carved from the old oak bell frame from the tower.
The church was rebuilt with one chapel to the north of the sanctuary and another to the south. On the south is the chapel of St Peter, commemorating the old co-parish church of St Peter&#x27;s, which stood on Church Street. The 18th-century wooden table was once the altar there. The Sacrament is reserved here, and the chapel is used for weekday Communion services. Charred timbers from the old church were used to form the cross on the wall.

The chapel to the north was that of St George, commemorating the former, nearby church of that dedication demolished to make way for the Queen Victoria monument at the head of Castle Street. This commemoration of two historic churches was disturbed by the introduction of a new dedication for this chapel in 1993. In that year the Maritime Chapel of St Mary del Quay was dedicated as part of the celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic. It memorialises the medieval shrine. A statue of Our Lady, cast in bronze, is shown standing in the prow of a boat. The statue was created by Liverpool artist Arthur Dooley. The furnishings in the chapel are by Robin McGhie. The chapel contains a Book of Remembrance, listing the names of mariners lost at sea.

Behind the church&#x27;s high altar is an icon of the crucifixion painted by the Romanian artist Tatiana Nichita, donated in commemoration of Merseyside Police Constable Neil Doyle, who was murdered in Liverpool city centre while off-duty, and whose funeral took place at the church.

The church is linked to the famous phrase, &quot;I&#x27;ll be waiting till Dick docks&quot;, meaning &quot;I&#x27;ll be waiting a long time&quot;. This refers to the ship the &quot;Richard Donnelly&quot;, which is said to have sunk in Liverpool Bay. Another version of this phrase is used when an unlikely promise is made; &quot;I&#x27;ll repay that loan soon!&quot; &quot;Oh, yes – when Donnelly docks!&quot; implying that the action is never going to happen. A gilded copper weather vane in the form of the ship is on top of the tower of St Nicholas&#x27;. The weather vane measures 4 ft 4 (1.3m).

The vane probably survived the fall of the tower in 1810. It was renovated before re-erection; the sails are dated 1815. Historic photos show ships as weather vanes on the Bluecoat Hospital and one of the Goree warehouses. The vane was added to the church in 1746 when the spire was built on the tower. The illustration in &quot;Enfield&#x27;s History of Liverpool 1773&quot; clearly shows the ship.

Despite the traditions, no record of a Liverpool ship named &quot;Donnely&quot; or &quot;Richard Donnelly&quot; has been found. This has been confirmed by Mr Tibble, Director of the Liverpool Maritime Museum. Unfortunately for local mythology, there is some serious misunderstanding about the weather vane.

==History==

===The formation, &quot;The Used&quot;, and &quot;In Love &amp; Death&quot; (2000–2005)===
The Used formed in the summer of 2000 with Branden Steineckert, Quinn Allman, Jeph Howard, and Bert McCracken. The band began composing songs without lyrics prior to McCracken joining. They held auditions for vocalists at Howard&#x27;s residence, but were not satisfied with any of the auditions, describing them as terrible. Allman then asked McCracken if he was interested in joining the band. McCracken was impressed with their material, and after being given some music, he wrote the lyrics to what would become &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;. He returned the next day to record a demo version of the song and was then officially confirmed as the band&#x27;s vocalist. During the early days of the band, members suffered from poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse, panhandling for change in order to buy food. They decided upon the name &quot;Used&quot; after friends claimed they felt &quot;used&quot; when contact with the band members waned as they became more engrossed in the project.

They continued to write songs together and recorded a demo album in drummer Steineckert&#x27;s bedroom titled &quot;Demos from the Basement&quot;. Steineckert sent their songs to producer John Feldmann from the ska group Goldfinger. On hearing the song &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot;, Feldman flew the band to Los Angeles on his own expense and helped them find a record label. They played for various record executives, but received little interest. Eventually, after sending copies of their demo to many record companies, they began to receive offers. They decided to sign to Reprise Records the first week of January 2002 which was only 1 year after the band had formed.
In 2002, it was discovered that a Boston band had already trademarked the name &quot;Used&quot;. The band decided to add &quot;the&quot; to their name, thus becoming &quot;the Used&quot;. Their self-titled debut album, produced by John Feldmann, was released on June 25, 2002, to critical acclaim. The album featured the singles: &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot;, &quot;Buried Myself Alive&quot;, and &quot;Blue and Yellow&quot;, with all three entering the charts and the album being certified platinum. They went on to play Warped Tour, Ozzfest, and Projekt Revolution, as well as Box Car Racer&#x27;s first and only tour. During these tours, they employed a touring guitarist named Greg Bester. He was later forced to return to his home country when he couldn&#x27;t get a working visa. The band received much recognition when Bert McCracken dated Kelly Osbourne and appeared on an episode of the TV show The Osbournes titled &quot;Beauty and the Bert&quot;. In July 2003, they released a compilation CD/DVD combo package titled &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;. The CD features live, rare, previously unreleased tracks, and demo material, while the DVD features the history of the band, member bios, and part of a live concert. &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; has been certified platinum.

In 2004, lead vocalist McCracken&#x27;s ex-girlfriend died of a drug overdose while pregnant with his child. Their second studio album was thus named &quot;In Love and Death&quot;, released as a reference to the tragedy McCracken dealt with during the recording. The song &quot;Hard to Say&quot; was a reference to McCracken&#x27;s ex-girlfriend; although the song was written years earlier, its dedication was only then declared. &quot;In Love and Death&quot; received very positive reviews and spawned three singles: &quot;Take It Away&quot;, &quot;All That I&#x27;ve Got&quot; (which earned them their first MuchMusic Video Award nomination), and &quot;I Caught Fire&quot;, before being re-released in 2005. &quot;Under Pressure&quot; (a Queen and David Bowie cover song performed with My Chemical Romance) was featured as a bonus track later pressings. The album has been certified platinum. After finishing up an international tour for the album, they took about eight months off before starting to work on their next album.

===&quot;Lies for the Liars&quot;, &quot;Shallow Believer&quot;, &quot;Artwork&quot;, and &quot;Vulnerable&quot; (2006–2012)===

On September 12, 2006, the Used announced that Steineckert was no longer a member of the band. They said they felt they needed to move forward without him, and that there was a personality conflict between Steineckert and another band member. In late 2006, it was announced drummer Dan Whitesides of The New Transit Direction would replace Steineckert. Steineckert has since joined Rancid.

On February 6, 2007, they released a live album, &quot;Berth&quot;, which includes a DVD that features video of their performance at the Taste of Chaos 2005 tour in Vancouver and a CD that features it on audio. The DVD also includes a biography of the band and four music videos. The biography depicts the band after the release of &quot;Maybe Memories&quot;, leading into the creation of &quot;In Love and Death&quot;. The sale of &quot;Berth&quot; lead it to be certified as gold. They spent most of the early part of 2007 on the Taste of Chaos tour before their third album, &quot;Lies for the Liars&quot;, was released May 22, 2007. They headlined the Give It a Name festival. In June, they played the MuchMusic Video Awards for the first time ever, and received their second nomination for Best International Group Video, for &quot;The Bird and the Worm&quot;. They were scheduled to play Warped Tour in June and July, in support of their album, but were forced to cancel due to McCracken&#x27;s vocal cord surgery. After McCracken recovered, the band played the Reading and Leeds festivals in August, and went on to tour the United States in September. &quot;Lies for the Liars&quot; charted in the top five in more than seven countries, and featured the singles: &quot;The Bird and the Worm&quot; and &quot;Pretty Handsome Awkward&quot;. Although Whitesides had been chosen as the new drummer, Dean Butterworth of Good Charlotte recorded drums for the album. The six-month recording process was the longest the band had ever undertaken. &quot;Lies for the Liars&quot; generally received mixed to positive reviews. Originally, &quot;Lies for the Liars&quot; was expected to be a double-album. Nineteen songs were recorded, but they instead decided to save the songs for a future release. The album has been certified gold.
On May 19, 2008, they released &quot;Shallow Believer&quot;, an EP containing the band&#x27;s B-sides. It was only released on digital music stores and it has charted No. 14 on iTunes&#x27; Top 100 albums. They worked on &quot;Artwork&quot;, their fourth studio album, throughout 2008. They took several breaks while working on the album to headline the inaugural Get a Life Tour and the Spare the Air Festival in California. The album was produced by Panic! at the Disco&#x27;s producer Matt Squire, making this their first studio album not produced by John Feldmann. It was also their first studio album to feature Whitesides as the drummer. In &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, McCracken stated &quot;In the past, we&#x27;ve always kind of brought pop sensibility into heavy rock, but this is going to be all that much more tantalizing and brutal. Our songs are ten times messier and noisier than they&#x27;ve ever been.&quot; McCracken explained the meaning of the album, saying, &quot;This record is about coming to grips with how much you really hate yourself and knowing you can never hate yourself to the full extent, so you&#x27;re free to hate yourself as much as you want to&quot;. McCracken went on to say &quot;we [have not] been this excited about an album since our self titled back in 2002.&quot; The album released along with a DVD for the pre-order and first run of the album in stores. A cover version of &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; by Talking Heads was released on the cover compilation album &quot;Covered, A Revolution in Sound&quot;, and was also featured in &quot;&quot;. They played at The Bamboozle in May 2009. The single &quot;Blood on My Hands&quot; was released on iTunes in June, and was streamable for one day on the band&#x27;s website. On July 21, the pre-order was available. &quot;Artwork&quot; became available worldwide on August 31, 2009. The band played a major U.S. tour in October and November 2009 with supporting bands The Almost and Drive A, and another in early 2010 with Atreyu and Drive A. They later joined an arena tour supporting Three Days Grace in Canada. The band premiered the music video for the song &quot;Empty with You&quot; on December 9, 2009, via Twitter. In April 2010, they began another US tour along with Chiodos and New Medicine.

In April 2010, they cancelled their upcoming international tour dates and also began writing material for a follow-up to &quot;Artwork&quot;. Recording and officially releasing the new album was significantly delayed after leaving Reprise Records—their record label group of ten years. According to Howard, &quot;We were kind of waiting to see if we were going to do this record on Warner or not. We kind of had to wait and see what happened about that before we started recording.&quot; They founded their own record label in 2011 after parting ways with Reprise Records, a division of Warner. The label was dubbed &quot;Dental Records&quot;, and they planned to release their fifth studio album &quot;Vulnerable&quot; in February 2012 on it.

By December 2011 the release plans for &quot;Vulnerable&quot; had changed. Their first choice, &quot;Dental Records&quot;, was already taken, so the group quickly came up with a different name instead, Anger Music Group. &quot;Vulnerable&quot; was released March 26, 2012. The album&#x27;s spawned three singles; &quot;I Come Alive&quot;, &quot;Put Me Out&quot;, and &quot;Hands and Faces&quot;.

In support of &quot;Vulnerable&quot;, they embarked on a North American headlining tour in May and June 2012, and also performed on the main stage of Warped Tour 2012 in June and July 2012. In June 2012, they were forced to cancel all scheduled Canadian tour dates due to McCracken&#x27;s criminal record. McCracken said he would not be allowed entry into the country for ten years because of some &quot;teensy, eensy misdemeanors&quot;, including trespassing, from many years earlier.

===&quot;The Ocean of the Sky&quot;, &quot;Imaginary Enemy&quot;, and &quot;The Canyon&quot; (2013–2017)===

Sub City (Hopeless Records&#x27; non-profit 501(c) organization) announced on November 9, 2012, that they, with support from We Came As Romans, Crown the Empire, and Mindflow, would headline the annual nationwide charity tour will circle the US through February, showcasing some of the best bands in music today while raising funds and awareness for It Gets Better Project and the concept that we can all help play a part in making a positive impact. The band&#x27;s fifth studio album was re-issued as a two-disc set titled &quot;Vulnerable (II)&quot; on January 22, 2013. On March 11, 2013, the band released a music video for the single &quot;Hands and Faces&quot;.

In June 2013 they announced, &quot;The Ocean of the Sky&quot;, and the EP was released the following month.

In mid-January 2014, the band revealed their sixth studio album, &quot;Imaginary Enemy.&quot; It was released on April 1, 2014, through their label GAS Union. The album was greatly influenced by McCracken&#x27;s daughter.

In early February 2015, it was announced that guitarist Quinn Allman parted ways with the band for a one-year hiatus. Saosin&#x27;s guitarist Justin Shekoski became his replacement as touring member for subsequent tours from February 2015. They toured the United Kingdom in February 2015 with support from the Landscapes. On November 19, 2015, they announced that Allman amicably parted ways with the band permanently and then touring member Shekoski was welcomed as his permanent replacement. However, Allman later revealed that he had intended to return to the band for the anniversary tour, and his departure was a one-sided decision by the band which he became aware of via the band&#x27;s Facebook announcement.

The band released a live album, &quot;Live &amp; Acoustic at the Palace&quot;, in April 2016. It was recorded at a show on October 11, 2015, at the Palace in Los Angeles. It is the first release without guitarist Quinn Allman, and first to feature new guitarist Justin Shekoski. The live CD/DVD hit #11 on Billboard&#x27;s Current Album&#x27;s chart, and recorded the band&#x27;s intimate performance with a four-piece string quartet, harpist, piano player, percussion and a three-piece gospel choir. On Shekoski&#x27;s addition to the band, in an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, lead singer Bert McCracken stated Shekoski&#x27;s &quot;lust for life and passion for art is inspiring. It&#x27;s been a fire underneath The Used. It&#x27;s a new chapter of a brand new book&quot; and &quot;since Justin became a part of the Used it&#x27;s been nothing but exciting for the next step.&quot; The band members were inspired following the live recording of &quot;Live &amp; Acoustic at the Palace&quot;, and wanted to reflect the live experience in their new album. They spent all of 2016 touring Europe, North America, and Australia to celebrate their 15-year anniversary. In every city they played back to back shows in two nights, playing songs from their &quot;self titled&quot; album on the first night, and &quot;In Love and Death&quot; on the second night in their entirety. Following the success of the first leg of the tour, the band announced they will embark on a second leg of the anniversary tour.

Their seventh studio album, &quot;The Canyon&quot;, was released on October 27, 2017, with a video for the song &quot;Over and Over Again&quot; being released prior to the album. The music video was directed by Lisa Mann and included dance choreography with bright visuals. The album was produced by Ross Robinson, and was recorded using analog equipment with no click-tracks or backing vocals to achieve a raw sound. McCracken and Shekoski bonded over the loss of their loved ones, including McCracken&#x27;s friend, Traegan, and Shekoski&#x27;s late father who died from a car accident about ten years prior, with McCracken stating in an interview with the &quot;Alternative Press&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ve never had a more connected time creatively, I&#x27;ve never felt closer to peace and my understanding of peace being this aggressive selfless drive to create something, to explode into history as one, as all, not as an individual. So many, just monuments and huge moments, that when we were done, I was overwhelmed.&quot;

The album received positive reception following its release, with &quot;Alternative Press&quot; claiming the album has &quot;A vibrancy and vulnerability not felt since the Used&#x27;s 2002 self-titled debut,&quot; and stating that the band&#x27;s new guitarist Justin Shekoski &quot;has breathed new life into the songwriting.&quot; McCracken&#x27;s delivery of the lyrics coupled with Shekoski&#x27;s melodies and riffs, showed &quot;The Used have fully realized their wild imagination&quot; and critics noted &quot;this collection of songs are more compelling and moving than anything heard previously from the band.&quot; The album appears in AllMusic&#x27;s 2017 Year In Review: Favorite Punk Albums, &quot;Alternative Press&quot;&#x27;s The 40 best albums of 2017, &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;&#x27;s Album of 2017: Staff edit and &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s Albums of 2017 lists.

In October and November 2017, the group went on a headlining US tour with support from Glassjaw. The band also promoted the new album with acoustic performances at Huntington Beach, and Amoeba Music. Shekoski and McCracken were praised by Rolling Stone for their &quot;powerful acoustic performance&quot;.

===&quot;Heartwork&quot; (2018–2021)===
In January 2018, following a business dispute regarding payment after the release of &quot;The Canyon&quot; and subsequent promotional tour, Shekoski was dismissed from the band. In March 2018, they removed Justin Shekoski from their band members section on Facebook and edited him out of their promotional photos. At the end of April 2018, Joey Bradford of the band &#x27;Hell or Highwater&#x27; appeared in videos of the band practicing for upcoming tour dates. In 2019, Shekoski filed suit against The Used for royalties and damages. The dispute was resolved amicably and settled out of court.

They released a limited edition vinyl EP, &quot;Live from Maida Vale&quot;, on Record Store Day 2019. It is the first release to feature Joey Bradford on guitar.

After the release, they signed with a new record label called Big Noise Music Group. They headlined the first annual Rockstar energy drink Disrupt tour, which was intended to fill the void left by the change of concept of the Warped Tour. The band started recording the album in June and finished recording it after the Disrupt Festival tour in November. The album was produced by John Feldmann who produced most of their studio albums. The first single and music video from the upcoming album, &quot;Blow Me&quot;, was released on December 6. A second single and video &quot;Paradise Lost, a poem by John Milton&quot; was released February 7. A third single and video &quot;Cathedral Bell&quot; was released April 17. The album, &quot;Heartwork&quot;, was released on April 24, 2020. A year and a half later on September 10, 2021, the band released a deluxe version of Heartwork with 11 b-sides recorded during the session.

===&quot;Toxic Positivity&quot;, &quot;Medz&quot;, and Bert solo album (2021–present)===
The band recorded 11 songs in 11 days in October 2021 and 10 songs in 10 days in February 2023 for their next album. The single &quot;Fuck You&quot; was released on October 21, 2022. Another single, &quot;People Are Vomit&quot;, was released on February 17, 2023. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Numb&quot;, was released on April 20, 2023. &quot;Giving Up&quot; was released as the second single on May 17, 2023. The album, &quot;Toxic Positivity&quot;, was released May 19, 2023. The remaining songs from the session were released on an album called &quot;Medz&quot; on June 21, 2024.

McCracken has announced that a solo pop album of his titled &quot;Robbietheused&quot; will be released in 2024.

==Musical style and influences==
The Used&#x27;s sound has been described as a blend of &quot;feral rage&quot; and &quot;unabashed vulnerability&quot;, and has been classified as emo, post-hardcore, punk rock, screamo, alternative rock, pop-punk, hard rock, and heavy metal. The band&#x27;s early influences included Ink &amp; Dagger, Jawbox, Fugazi, Nirvana, Refused, Jimmy Eat World, Hot Water Music, Converge, and Goldfinger. In 2007, bassist Jeph Howard stated, &quot;We just don&#x27;t consider ourselves &#x27;emo&#x27; or &#x27;screamo&#x27; and we never have. We&#x27;re a rock band, that&#x27;s all we&#x27;ve ever been.&quot; However, in a 2023 interview, McCracken admitted, &quot;I used to cringe about that term ‘emo’ but I think we’ve swallowed it… We &quot;are&quot; emo.&quot;

For &quot;Artwork&quot;, McCracken described their genre as &quot;gross pop&quot;. On their fifth album &quot;Vulnerable&quot;, McCracken stated that there is a lot of hip hop influence, beats and drum and bass kind of stuff but it is also still the Used record with many soft and heavy, brutal, sharp, bright sounds and the tempos are anywhere from ultra-slow to super fast and heavy.

<text>Variable Data Intelligent Postscript Printware is an open language from Xerox that enables highest-performance output of variable-data PostScript documents. It is used by the FreeFlow VI Suite (VIPP) front end.

==Origins==
VIPP was originally called XGF and it is simply groups of PostScript dictionaries which provide macros that simplify writing of complex PostScript commands. PostScript is powerful language which allows variable data printing and personalization of the data stream with the right commands. To implement some of these features a programmer has to write a few, or sometimes many, lines of code. Xerox developed macro procedures in PostScript language dictionaries to make page control easier.

For example, to merge a graphic form with the data stream requires an understanding of PostScript commands according to the Adobe PostScript Language Reference Manual (PLRM, otherwise known as the &quot;Red book&quot;). Xerox gives you this feature through this simple command &quot;(&quot;formname&quot;) SETFORM&quot;, where &quot;formname&quot; is the name of the form accessible from the Xerox printer controller (DocuSP or FreeFlow Print Server). Several VIPP commands are identical to PostScript commands.

VIPP was originally written by couple of Xerox systems Analysts in Switzerland to enable the highest speed Postscript printers, at that time 50 pages per minute, to have the features of Xerox&#x27;s proprietary production printing languages PDL and FDL which provide simple variable data printing. Xerox Corporation adopted the idea and developed their work by putting these procedures on Sun Microsystems hosts where the Adobe interpreter also resides. Together, these modules give complete control over the printing engine and data stream.

==Operation==
VIPP can be used in four different modes: Database mode, Line mode, XML mode and Native mode. In Database mode, the programmer can quickly implement a printing solution, for example a billing application, for a delimited database file. In Line mode, an existing print application can be enhanced with form overlays, font selection, color and other features offered by modern laser printers. In XML mode, an XML file can be turned into a readable document. In all modes, VIPP offers conditional logic manipulation of the data.

For example, a multi-page bill could be printed in duplex (two-sided) mode with the first page selected from a paper tray loaded with a perforated sheet for remittance return, and the back side printed with disclosures and instructions, while subsequent pages of billing detail are printed on plain paper. The VIPP programmer might even insert an OCR or MICR line for remittance processing, complete with a check digit.

Xerox markets an Interactive Development Environment for VIPP called FreeFlow VI Designer. and FreeFlow VIPP Pro Publisher. These help a programmer code applications rapidly in VIPP. FreeFlow VIPP Pro Publisher is a plugin to the popular Adobe InDesign product enabling WYSIWYG VIPP development.

==Licensing==
VIPP is licensed to specific printer controllers running a Solaris or Microsoft Windows operating system, including some PostScript capable office devices that have non-volatile memory (such as a hard disk). VIPP is capable of being installed on any device which has a PostScript interpreter. FreeFlow Print Server (FFPS), formerly DocuSP is VIPP enabled but is limited in producing up to 200 pages until appropriately licensed.

<doc id="1045547" wikidata="Q715739" url="?curid=1045547" title="Thespesia populnea">
<text>Thespesia populnea, commonly known as the portia tree (), Pacific rosewood, Indian tulip tree, or milo, among other names, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the mallow family, Malvaceae. It is a tree found commonly on coasts around the world. Although it is confirmed to be native only to the Old World tropics, other authorities consider it to have a wider, possibly pantropical native distribution. It is thought to be an invasive species in Florida and Brazil.

==Distribution ==
&quot;Thespesia populnea&quot; is native to tropical coastlines and is adapted for oceanic dispersal and growth in island environments. It is known from both coasts of Africa, tropical Asia, northern Australia, the Pacific Islands (including Hawaii), the tropical Pacific coast of the Americas from Mexico south to Colombia, the West Indies, and Florida in the United States. Its exact native distribution has been debated, with most authorities considering it to be native only to the Old World tropics, some others such as Plants of the World Online including the Pacific Islands in its native range, and others such as the IUCN Red List and the USDA also including the tropical Americas within its native range. The IUCN only considers &quot;T. populnea&quot; to be introduced and invasive in Florida. It may also be invasive in northern Brazil.

Like the related &quot;Hibiscus tiliaceus&quot;, it was one of the main sources of bast fibers for the production of cordage and wood for Austronesian outrigger ships and carving. Though the plant seeds can survive for months on sea currents, no remains of &quot;T. populnea&quot; have been recovered from Polynesia prior to the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP), thus it is regarded by some authors as a canoe plant, deliberately carried and introduced by Austronesian voyagers in the islands they settled. However, it is still considered questionably indigenous to the Pacific islands, including Hawaii, by many other authorities. In Hawaii, it is classified as a native species and is used in habitat restoration projects for the degraded Hawaiian tropical dry forests alongside the definitively native tree species &quot;Dodonaea viscosa&quot; and &quot;Cordia subcordata&quot;.

==Description==
The Portia tree reaches a height of tall and its trunk can measure up to in diameter. It grows at elevations from sea level to in areas that receive of annual rainfall. The Portia tree is able to grow in the wide range of soil types that may be present in coastal environments, including soils derived from quartz (sand), limestone, and basalt; it favours neutral soils (pH of 6–7.4). Pollen grains are approximately 70 microns in diameter.

==Uses==
The heartwood of the Portia tree is dark reddish brown to chocolate brown and has a specific gravity of 0.55 to 0.89.

Portia tree is known as &quot;milo&quot; or &quot;miro&quot; in Polynesian languages. It is popular in Hawaii for woodworking (commonly turned into bowls) because of the range of colours expressed (tan, through yellow, to red). The trees were regarded as sacred in Polynesian culture, and were commonly planted in &quot;marae&quot; sites along with trees like &quot;Ficus&quot;, &quot;Fagraea berteroana&quot;, &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot; and &quot;Calophyllum inophyllum&quot;. Traditionally it was planted in sacred groves and used for religious sculpture throughout eastern Polynesia. In Tahiti, Milo wood is used in the making of the to&#x27;ere (slotted wooden drum), used in traditional Tahitian tribal drumming. &quot;Makoi&quot; was used for the rongorongo tablets of Easter Island. Since the advent of aluminium-hulled boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson Island to harvest &quot;miro&quot; wood. Usually they venture to Henderson only once per year, but may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios, from which they derive much of their income.

In New Ireland, Portia wood is used to make hourglass drums. In Tonga, its bark is used to treat mouth infections among infants, and its wood is used to make canoes, house parts, and artwork.

In Indonesia they are known as &quot;baru laut&quot;, &quot;baru pantai&quot; or &quot;waru lot&quot;. The Ambonese cook the leaves into a dish with vegetables.

In South Asia, it is used to make the &quot;thavil,&quot; a Carnatic musical instrument of South India. The flower of the Portia tree played a part in Sri Lanka&#x27;s independence movement, when it was sold on Remembrance Day by the Suriya-Mal Movement instead of the poppy to aid Sri Lankan ex-servicemen. The wood from the tree was used by early Tamil people to make instruments in ancient Tamilakam. It can be used for the cellulose production from the plants [Singh et al. 2019].

In some parts of the world, such as Hawaii and southern India, &quot;T. populnea&quot; is considered an important species in habitat restoration projects for coastal dry forests.

<doc id="1045552" wikidata="Q211733" url="?curid=1045552" title="Mali national football team">
<text>The Mali national football team (Bambara: &quot; Mali jamana ntolatantɔn&quot;, ) represents Mali in men&#x27;s international football and is governed by the Malian Football Federation. The team&#x27;s nickname is Les Aigles. They represent the country at tournaments organized by both FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

While Mali is a major youth football power in both Africa and the world, they have never qualified for any senior FIFA World Cup finals in history. They have qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations on 13 occasions.

Mali were suspended by FIFA on 17 March 2017 due to &#x27;government interference&#x27; with the national football association, namely dissolving its executive committee. However, the side was re-instated by FIFA on 29 April after the executive committee was re-introduced by the Malian government.

==History==
Mali reached the 1972 African Nations Cup final, but lost 3–2 to Congo. They failed to qualify for the finals again until 1994 when they reached the semi-finals, an achievement repeated in 2002, 2004, 2012 and 2013.

They played their first World Cup qualifier in the year 2000. As part of the CAF&#x27;s qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup, Mali lost in the preliminary round to Libya. Two years later, the country hosted the 2002 African Cup of Nations.

Mali&#x27;s under-23&#x27;s team managed to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece. The team coached by Cheick Kone managed to reach the quarter-finals of the Olympic tournament before losing to Italy.

In the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Mali beat Guinea-Bissau in the preliminaries. In the resulting second round, Mali finished fifth in its group. On 27 March 2005, riots broke out in Bamako after Mali lost a World Cup qualifier to Togo, 2–1 on a last minute goal.

In the 2010 African Nations Cup, Mali made football headlines for coming back from losing 4–0 with eleven minutes left to level 4–4 with Angola.

===Team kit===
== Rivalries ==

=== Tunisia ===

The rivalry between Mali and Tunisia has been evident in recent years in terms of the number of frequent matches, especially in the Africa Cup of Nations. The two teams met for the first time on 6 January 1974, during a friendly match in Bamako, which ended with a 1–0 victory for Mali. The match between the two teams in the 1994 African Cup of Nations, which was held in Tunisia, remains one of the biggest setbacks witnessed by the Tunisian national team, as Mali won the match 2–0, which led to Tunisia&#x27;s early exclusion from the tournament that was held on its soil. In recent years, the team&#x27;s matches have continued, as they met in the last three consecutive editions of the African Cup of Nations 2019, 2021 and 2023, all of which were in the group stage, where Mali won two matches and one ended in a draw. The two teams met in the third and final round of the 2022 World Cup qualification. Two round-robin matches were played. However, Tunisia qualified for the World Cup after winning the first leg in Bamako 1–0 with an own goal from defender Moussa Sissako, and a goalless draw prevailed in the return match in Radès. This was Mali&#x27;s closest chance of qualifying for the World Cup. The competition record remains with Tunisia with a slight advantage. Tunisia won 6 matches, 3 of which ended in draws, and Mali won 5 matches.

===Africa Cup of Nations===
Mali have never won the Africa Cup of Nations; their best result at the tournament was runners-up in 1972. Mali have qualified for the tournament thirteen times in total, finishing as runners-up once, third twice, and fourth three times. Prior to 2008, each time Mali qualified, they reached the knockout stage having only qualified four times before then.

===African Nations Championship===
Mali has competed in five African Nations Championship tournaments, finishing as runners-up twice.

<doc id="1045553" wikidata="Q1147928" url="?curid=1045553" title="Multinomial distribution">
<text>In probability theory, the multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution. For example, it models the probability of counts for each side of a &quot;k&quot;-sided die rolled &quot;n&quot; times. For &quot;n&quot; independent trials each of which leads to a success for exactly one of &quot;k&quot; categories, with each category having a given fixed success probability, the multinomial distribution gives the probability of any particular combination of numbers of successes for the various categories.

When &quot;k&quot; is 2 and &quot;n&quot; is 1, the multinomial distribution is the Bernoulli distribution. When &quot;k&quot; is 2 and &quot;n&quot; is bigger than 1, it is the binomial distribution. When &quot;k&quot; is bigger than 2 and &quot;n&quot; is 1, it is the categorical distribution. The term &quot;multinoulli&quot; is sometimes used for the categorical distribution to emphasize this four-way relationship (so &quot;n&quot; determines the suffix, and &quot;k&quot; the prefix).

The Bernoulli distribution models the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial. In other words, it models whether flipping a (possibly biased) coin one time will result in either a success (obtaining a head) or failure (obtaining a tail). The binomial distribution generalizes this to the number of heads from performing &quot;n&quot; independent flips (Bernoulli trials) of the same coin. The multinomial distribution models the outcome of &quot;n&quot; experiments, where the outcome of each trial has a categorical distribution, such as rolling a &quot;k&quot;-sided die &quot;n&quot; times.

Let &quot;k&quot; be a fixed finite number. Mathematically, we have &quot;k&quot; possible mutually exclusive outcomes, with corresponding probabilities &quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; independent trials. Since the &quot;k&quot; outcomes are mutually exclusive and one must occur we have &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; ≥ 0 for &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;k&quot; and formula_1. Then if the random variables &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; indicate the number of times outcome number &quot;i&quot; is observed over the &quot;n&quot; trials, the vector &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;) follows a multinomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and p, where p = (&quot;p&quot;1, ..., &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;). While the trials are independent, their outcomes &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; are dependent because they must sum to n.
== Definitions ==
===Probability mass function===
Suppose one does an experiment of extracting &quot;n&quot; balls of &quot;k&quot; different colors from a bag, replacing the extracted balls after each draw. Balls of the same color are equivalent. Denote the variable which is the number of extracted balls of color &quot;i&quot; (&quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;k&quot;) as &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, and denote as &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; the probability that a given extraction will be in color &quot;i&quot;. The probability mass function of this multinomial distribution is:

: formula_2

for non-negative integers &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;k&quot;.

The probability mass function can be expressed using the gamma function as:

:formula_3

This form shows its resemblance to the Dirichlet distribution, which is its conjugate prior.

=== Example ===

Suppose that in a three-way election for a large country, candidate A received 20% of the votes, candidate B received 30% of the votes, and candidate C received 50% of the votes. If six voters are selected randomly, what is the probability that there will be exactly one supporter for candidate A, two supporters for candidate B and three supporters for candidate C in the sample?

&quot;Note: Since we’re assuming that the voting population is large, it is reasonable and permissible to think of the probabilities as unchanging once a voter is selected for the sample. Technically speaking this is sampling without replacement, so the correct distribution is the multivariate hypergeometric distribution, but the distributions converge as the population grows large in comparison to a fixed sample size&quot;&quot;.&quot;

: formula_4

== Properties ==

=== Normalization ===

The multinomial distribution is normalized according to:

:formula_5

where the sum is over all permutations of formula_6such that formula_7.

=== Expected value and variance ===
The expected number of times the outcome &quot;i&quot; was observed over &quot;n&quot; trials is

:formula_8

The covariance matrix is as follows. Each diagonal entry is the variance of a binomially distributed random variable, and is therefore

:formula_9

The off-diagonal entries are the covariances:

:formula_10

for &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; distinct.

All covariances are negative because for fixed &quot;n&quot;, an increase in one component of a multinomial vector requires a decrease in another component.

When these expressions are combined into a matrix with &quot;i, j&quot; element formula_11 the result is a &quot;k&quot; × &quot;k&quot; positive-semidefinite covariance matrix of rank &quot;k&quot; − 1. In the special case where &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot; and where the &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot; are all equal, the covariance matrix is the centering matrix.

The entries of the corresponding correlation matrix are

:formula_12

:formula_13

Note that the number of trials &quot;n&quot; drops out of this expression.

Each of the &quot;k&quot; components separately has a binomial distribution with parameters &quot;n&quot; and &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, for the appropriate value of the subscript &quot;i&quot;.

The support of the multinomial distribution is the set

: formula_14

Its number of elements is

=== Visualization ===
==== As slices of generalized Pascal&#x27;s triangle ====
Just like one can interpret the binomial distribution as (normalized) one-dimensional (1D) slices of Pascal&#x27;s triangle, so too can one interpret the multinomial distribution as 2D (triangular) slices of Pascal&#x27;s pyramid, or 3D/4D/+ (pyramid-shaped) slices of higher-dimensional analogs of Pascal&#x27;s triangle. This reveals an interpretation of the range of the distribution: discretized equilateral &quot;pyramids&quot; in arbitrary dimension—i.e. a simplex with a grid.

==== As polynomial coefficients ====
Similarly, just like one can interpret the binomial distribution as the polynomial coefficients of formula_18 when expanded, one can interpret the multinomial distribution as the coefficients of formula_19 when expanded, noting that just the coefficients must sum up to 1.

=== Large deviation theory ===
==== Asymptotics ====

By Stirling&#x27;s formula, at the limit of formula_20, we haveformula_21where relative frequencies formula_22 in the data can be interpreted as probabilities from the empirical distribution formula_23, and formula_24 is the Kullback–Leibler divergence.

This formula can be interpreted as follows.

Consider formula_25, the space of all possible distributions over the categories formula_26. It is a simplex. After formula_27 independent samples from the categorical distribution formula_28 (which is how we construct the multinomial distribution), we obtain an empirical distribution formula_23.

By the asymptotic formula, the probability that empirical distribution formula_23 deviates from the actual distribution formula_28 decays exponentially, at a rate formula_32. The more experiments and the more different formula_23 is from formula_28, the less likely it is to see such an empirical distribution.

If formula_35 is a closed subset of formula_25, then by dividing up formula_35 into pieces, and reasoning about the growth rate of formula_38 on each piece formula_39, we obtain Sanov&#x27;s theorem, which states thatformula_40

==== Concentration at large &quot;n&quot; ====

Due to the exponential decay, at large formula_27, almost all the probability mass is concentrated in a small neighborhood of formula_28. In this small neighborhood, we can take the first nonzero term in the Taylor expansion of formula_24, to obtainformula_44This resembles the gaussian distribution, which suggests the following theorem:

Theorem. At the formula_45 limit, formula_46 converges in distribution to the chi-squared distribution formula_47.


The space of all distributions over categories formula_48 is a simplex: formula_49, and the set of all possible empirical distributions after formula_27 experiments is a subset of the simplex: formula_51. That is, it is the intersection between formula_25 and the lattice formula_53.

As formula_27 increases, most of the probability mass is concentrated in a subset of formula_55 near formula_28, and the probability distribution near formula_28 becomes well-approximated by formula_58From this, we see that the subset upon which the mass is concentrated has radius on the order of formula_59, but the points in the subset are separated by distance on the order of formula_60, so at large formula_27, the points merge into a continuum.
To convert this from a discrete probability distribution to a continuous probability density, we need to multiply by the volume occupied by each point of formula_55 in formula_25. However, by symmetry, every point occupies exactly the same volume (except a negligible set on the boundary), so we obtain a probability density formula_64, where formula_65 is a constant.

Finally, since the simplex formula_25 is not all of formula_67, but only within a formula_68-dimensional plane, we obtain the desired result.

==== Conditional concentration at large &quot;n&quot; ====
The above concentration phenomenon can be easily generalized to the case where we condition upon linear constraints. This is the theoretical justification for Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test.

Theorem. Given frequencies formula_69 observed in a dataset with formula_27 points, we impose formula_71 independent linear constraints formula_72(notice that the first constraint is simply the requirement that the empirical distributions sum to one), such that empirical formula_73 satisfy all these constraints simultaneously. Let formula_74 denote the formula_75-projection of prior distribution formula_28 on the sub-region of the simplex allowed by the linear constraints. At the formula_45 limit, sampled counts formula_78 from the multinomial distribution conditional on the linear constraints are governed by formula_79 which converges in distribution to the chi-squared distribution formula_80.

An analogous proof applies in this Diophantine problem of coupled linear equations in count variables formula_78, but this time formula_55 is the intersection of formula_53 with formula_84 and formula_85 hyperplanes, all linearly independent, so the probability density formula_86 is restricted to a formula_87-dimensional plane. In particular, expanding the KL divergence formula_88 around its minimum formula_74 (the formula_75-projection of formula_28 on formula_55) in the constrained problem ensures by the Pythagorean theorem for formula_75-divergence that any constant and linear term in the counts formula_78 vanishes from the conditional probability to multinationally sample those counts.

Notice that 
by definition, every one of formula_95 must be a rational number, 
whereas formula_96 may be chosen from any real number in formula_97 and need not satisfy the Diophantine system of equations. 
Only asymptotically as formula_98, the formula_99&#x27;s can be regarded as probabilities over formula_97.

Away from empirically observed constraints formula_101 (such as moments or prevalences) the theorem can be generalized:

Theorem.

* Given functions formula_102, such that they are continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of formula_28, and the vectors formula_104 are linearly independent;
* given sequences formula_105, such that asymptotically formula_106 for each formula_107; 
* then for the multinomial distribution conditional on constraints formula_108, we have the quantity formula_109 converging in distribution to formula_80 at the formula_45 limit.

In the case that all formula_99 are equal, the Theorem reduces to the concentration of entropies around the Maximum Entropy.

==Related distributions==
In some fields such as natural language processing, categorical and multinomial distributions are synonymous and it is common to speak of a multinomial distribution when a categorical distribution is actually meant. This stems from the fact that it is sometimes convenient to express the outcome of a categorical distribution as a &quot;1-of-k&quot; vector (a vector with one element containing a 1 and all other elements containing a 0) rather than as an integer in the range formula_113; in this form, a categorical distribution is equivalent to a multinomial distribution over a single trial.

* When &quot;k&quot; = 2, the multinomial distribution is the binomial distribution.
* Categorical distribution, the distribution of each trial; for &quot;k&quot; = 2, this is the Bernoulli distribution.
* The Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior of the multinomial in Bayesian statistics.
* Dirichlet-multinomial distribution.
* Beta-binomial distribution.
* Negative multinomial distribution
* Hardy–Weinberg principle ( a trinomial distribution with probabilities formula_114)

===Equivalence tests for multinomial distributions===
The goal of equivalence testing is to establish the agreement between a theoretical multinomial distribution and observed counting frequencies. The theoretical distribution may be a fully specified multinomial distribution or a parametric family of multinomial distributions.

Let formula_74 denote a theoretical multinomial distribution and let formula_28 be a true underlying distribution. The distributions formula_28 and formula_74 are considered equivalent if formula_119 for a distance formula_120 and a tolerance parameter formula_121. The equivalence test problem is formula_122 versus formula_123. The true underlying distribution formula_28 is unknown. Instead, the counting frequencies formula_125 are observed, where formula_27 is a sample size. An equivalence test uses formula_125 to reject formula_128. If formula_128 can be rejected then the equivalence between formula_28 and formula_74 is shown at a given significance level. The equivalence test for Euclidean distance can be found in text book of Wellek (2010). The equivalence test for the total variation distance is developed in Ostrovski (2017). The exact equivalence test for the specific cumulative distance is proposed in Frey (2009).

The distance between the true underlying distribution formula_28 and a family of the multinomial distributions formula_133 is defined by formula_134. Then the equivalence test problem is given by formula_135 and formula_136. The distance formula_137 is usually computed using numerical optimization. The tests for this case are developed recently in Ostrovski (2018).

=== Confidence intervals for the difference of two proportions ===

In the setting of a multinomial distribution, constructing confidence intervals for the difference between the proportions of observations from two events, formula_138, requires the incorporation of the negative covariance between the sample estimators formula_139 and formula_140.

Some of the literature on the subject focused on the use-case of matched-pairs binary data, which requires careful attention when translating the formulas to the general case of formula_138 for any multinomial distribution. Formulas in the current section will be generalized, while formulas in the next section will focus on the matched-pairs binary data use-case.

Wald&#x27;s standard error (SE) of the difference of proportion can be estimated using:

formula_142

For a formula_143 approximate confidence interval, the margin of error may incorporate the appropriate quantile from the standard normal distribution, as follows:

formula_144
As the sample size (formula_27) increases, the sample proportions will approximately follow a multivariate normal distribution, thanks to the multidimensional central limit theorem (and it could also be shown using the Cramér–Wold theorem). Therefore, their difference will also be approximately normal. Also, these estimators are weakly consistent and plugging them into the SE estimator makes it also weakly consistent. Hence, thanks to Slutsky&#x27;s theorem, the pivotal quantity formula_146 approximately follows the standard normal distribution. And from that, the above approximate confidence interval is directly derived.

The SE can be constructed using the calculus of the variance of the difference of two random variables:
formula_147

A modification which includes a continuity correction adds formula_148 to the margin of error as follows:

formula_149

Another alternative is to rely on a Bayesian estimator using Jeffreys prior which leads to using a dirichlet distribution, with all parameters being equal to 0.5, as a prior. The posterior will be the calculations from above, but after adding 1/2 to each of the &quot;k&quot; elements, leading to an overall increase of the sample size by formula_150. This was originally developed for a multinomial distribution with four events, and is known as &quot;wald+2&quot;, for analyzing matched pairs data (see the next section for more details).

This leads to the following SE:

formula_151
formula_152
Which can just be plugged into the original Wald formula as follows:

formula_153

== Occurrence and applications ==

=== Confidence intervals for the difference in matched-pairs binary data (using multinomial with &quot;k=4&quot;) ===

For the case of matched-pairs binary data, a common task is to build the confidence interval of the difference of the proportion of the matched events. For example, we might have a test for some disease, and we may want to check the results of it for some population at two points in time (1 and 2), to check if there was a change in the proportion of the positives for the disease during that time.

Such scenarios can be represented using a two-by-two contingency table with the number of elements that had each of the combination of events. We can use small &quot;f&quot; for sampling frequencies: formula_154, and capital &quot;F&quot; for population frequencies: formula_155. These four combinations could be modeled as coming from a multinomial distribution (with four potential outcomes). The sizes of the sample and population can be &quot;n&quot; and &quot;N&quot; respectively. And in such a case, there is an interest in building a confidence interval for the difference of proportions from the marginals of the following (sampled) contingency table:

In this case, checking the difference in marginal proportions means we are interested in using the following definitions: formula_156, formula_157.
And the difference we want to build confidence intervals for is:

formula_158

Hence, a confidence intervals for the marginal positive proportions (formula_159) is the same as building a confidence interval for the difference of the proportions from the secondary diagonal of the two-by-two contingency table (formula_160).

Calculating a p-value for such a difference is known as McNemar&#x27;s test. Building confidence interval around it can be constructed using methods described above for Confidence intervals for the difference of two proportions.

The Wald confidence intervals from the previous section can be applied to this setting, and appears in the literature using alternative notations. Specifically, the SE often presented is based on the contingency table frequencies instead of the sample proportions. For example, the Wald confidence intervals, provided above, can be written as:

formula_161

Further research in the literature has identified several shortcomings in both the Wald and the Wald with continuity correction methods, and other methods have been proposed for practical application.

One such modification includes &quot;Agresti and Min’s Wald+2&quot; (similar to some of their other works) in which each cell frequency had an extra formula_162 added to it. This leads to the &quot;Wald+2&quot; confidence intervals. In a Bayesian interpretation, this is like building the estimators taking as prior a dirichlet distribution with all parameters being equal to 0.5 (which is, in fact, the Jeffreys prior). The &quot;+2&quot; in the name &quot;wald+2&quot; can now be taken to mean that in the context of a two-by-two contingency table, which is a multinomial distribution with four possible events, then since we add 1/2 an observation to each of them, then this translates to an overall addition of 2 observations (due to the prior).

This leads to the following modified SE for the case of matched pairs data:

formula_163

Which can just be plugged into the original Wald formula as follows:

formula_164

Other modifications include &quot;Bonett and Price’s Adjusted Wald&quot;, and &quot;Newcombe’s Score&quot;.

== Computational methods ==
=== Random variate generation ===
First, reorder the parameters formula_165 such that they are sorted in descending order (this is only to speed up computation and not strictly necessary). Now, for each trial, draw an auxiliary variable &quot;X&quot; from a uniform (0, 1) distribution. The resulting outcome is the component

: formula_166

{&quot;X&quot;&quot;j&quot; = 1, &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; = 0 for &quot;k&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot; } is one observation from the multinomial distribution with formula_165 and &quot;n&quot; = 1. A sum of independent repetitions of this experiment is an observation from a multinomial distribution with &quot;n&quot; equal to the number of such repetitions.

=== Sampling using repeated conditional binomial samples ===
Given the parameters formula_168 and a total for the sample formula_27 such that formula_170, it is possible to sample sequentially for the number in an arbitrary state formula_171, by partitioning the state space into formula_172 and not-formula_172, conditioned on any prior samples already taken, repeatedly.

==== Algorithm: Sequential conditional binomial sampling ====

S = n
rho = 1
for i in [1,k-1]:
 if rho != 0:
 X[i] ~ Binom(S,p[i]/rho)
 else 
 X[i] = 0
 S = S - X[i]
 rho = rho - p[i]
X[k] = S
Heuristically, each application of the binomial sample reduces the available number to sample from and the conditional probabilities are likewise updated to ensure logical consistency.

<text>Zafirlukast is an orally administered leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used for the chronic treatment of asthma. While zafirlukast is generally well tolerated, headaches and stomach upset often occur. Some rare side effects can occur, which can be life-threatening, such as liver failure. eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis has been associated with zafirlukast, but the relationship is not thought to be causative. Overdoses of zafirlukast tend to be self-limiting.

Zafirlukast, like other LTRAs, works by inhibiting the immune system. Through its action on inflammatory cells in the lungs, zafirlukast reduces the production of inflammatory mediators that are implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. Zafirlukast is extensively hepatically metabolized by an enzyme called CYP2C9. Zafirlukast inhibits the action of CYP3A4, leading to drug-drug interactions with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Genetic differences in LTC4 synthase and CYP2C9 may predict how a person reacts to zafirlukast treatment.

Zafirlukast (brand name Accolate) was the first cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist approved in the United States. It is now approved in many other countries under other brand names.

==Medical uses==
Zafirlukast is FDA-approved for the prevention and treatment of asthma in adults and children older than 5 years old. Like other leukotriene receptor antagonists, zafirlukast is thought to be useful for the long-term treatment of asthma, but it is generally less effective than inhaled glucocorticoids as monotherapy (which are the standard of care) or long-acting beta-2 agonists in combination therapy. Notably, zafirlukast is ineffective in the event of an acute asthma attack.

===Available forms===
There are two dosage forms for zafirlukast, notable for their age-adjustments. The 20 mg tablet is for adults and children older than age 12, whereas the 10 mg tablet is for children between the ages of 5 and 12. Tablets should be stored at room temperature, out of direct sunlight, and away from sources of moisture.

Tablets are for oral administration only.

===Specific populations===
====Pediatrics====
As a general rule, leukotriene receptor antagonists like zafirlukast are more effective in children that are younger and whose asthma is less atopic. Atopy refers to a predisposition towards developing allergic conditions, including asthma, hay fever, and eczema.

====Geriatrics====
The hepatic clearance of zafirlukast is impaired in adults 65 years of age and older, resulting in a 2–3 fold increase in the maximum plasma concentration and the total area under the curve. Zafirlukast may increase the risk for infections (7.0% vs 2.9%, zafirlukast vs. placebo incidence respectively), especially lower respiratory tract infections, in older adults, though the infections noted were not severe.

====Pregnancy====
Zafirlukast is considered to be &quot;pregnancy category B.&quot; This is due, in part, to the wide safety margin of zafirlukast in animal studies investigating teratogenicity. No teratogenicity has been observed in doses up to 2000 mg/kg/day in cynomolgus monkeys, representing an equivalent 20x exposure of the maximum recommended daily oral dose in human adults. However, spontaneous abortions occurred in cynomolgus monkeys at 2000 mg/kg/day, though the dose itself was maternally toxic.

====Lactation====
There is limited research on the use of zafirlukast in women whom are breastfeeding. Based on data from the manufacturer, it is expected that 0.6% of the maternal weight-adjusted dose would reach a breastfed infant, though the effects in the infant are unknown.

====Renal impairment====
Renal impairment does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetic profile of zafirlukast.

====Hepatic impairment====
The hepatic clearance of zafirlukast is impaired by significant hepatic impairment. Cirrhosis of the liver can increase the maximum plasma concentration and the total area under the curve (a measure of drug exposure) by 50–60%.

==Contraindications==
Zafirlukast is contraindicated in people who are hypersensitive or allergic to it.

==Adverse effects==
Zafirlukast is generally well tolerated, though headache and gastrointestinal (GI) upset can occur. The incidence of headaches is between 12 and 20%, which is similar to the incidence of headaches found in patients taking placebos in the studies that led to zafirlukast&#x27;s approval. GI upset may include nausea, stomach discomfort/pain, and diarrhea. GI complaints can be lessened by taking zafirlukast with food, though this can dramatically impair the amount of drug that gets absorbed into the body (see the section on drug-food interactions below).

Other common side effects include flu-like symptoms, sleep disturbances (abnormal dreams, insomnia), hallucinations, and daytime drowsiness.

===Neuropsychiatric effects===
Neuropsychiatric side effects have been reported with the use of zafirlukast and other LTRAs. While some side effects are less severe (e.g. abnormal dreams), others are more serious (e.g. hallucinations, tremors, suicidality). These effects were discovered through post-marketing reports, as the initial trials were not designed to monitor for neuropsychiatric side effects.

===Hepatotoxicity===
Zafirlukast can also cause rare but serious side effects like acute liver injury. Zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity generally occurs within the first 2–6 months of initiating therapy, though cases have been reported up to 13 months after starting zafirlukast. Zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity is characterized by a spectrum of liver damage symptoms, including fatigue, nausea, and right upper quadrant pain followed by dark urine, jaundice and pruritus. Liver enzyme elevations are common, and the pattern usually reflects hepatocellular damage, resembling acute viral hepatitis. It is unclear how the hepatotoxicity occurs, but it may be due to a metabolic intermediate of zafirlukast since it is metabolized in the liver through the enzyme CYP2C9. When it does occur it can be fatal, and reexposure with zafirlukast may result in a worse injury. Switching zafirlukast to another medication in the same class (e.g. montelukast) or in the related class of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors can be attempted, but caution should be employed.

According to the &quot;Dear Health Care Provider&quot; letter from AstraZeneca, zafirlukast-induced hepatotoxicity has occurred predominantly in females.

===Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis===
Several cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis have been reported with the use of zafirlukast, montelukast, pranlukast, and other asthma medications. When eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis occurs, it tends to occur in people with long-standing asthma and sinus inflammation, chronic oral corticosteroid use, and the recent initiation of a new anti-asthma therapy (like zafirlukast) in conjunction with tapering the corticosteroids. While the exact etiology of the development of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis symptoms in proximity to initiating zafirlukast is unknown, it is thought that withdrawal of chronic corticosteroids &quot;unmasks&quot; the previously undetected disease. Because corticosteroid withdrawal often happens while starting a new anti-asthma medication (like zafirlukast), this explains the rare but notable association. These cases may represent misdiagnosed asthma, as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis can induce symptoms of airway obstruction that are akin to an acute asthma exacerbation. The highest overdose reported with zafirlukast is 200 mg. All overdose patients have survived. Symptoms reported included rash and upset stomach.

== Interactions ==

===Drug–drug interactions===
Zafirlukast is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450 family 3 subfamily A member 4 (CYP3A4). Zafirlukast may increase the concentration of drugs that are metabolized through CYP3A4, such as the anticoagulant medication warfarin and the antiepileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine.

===Drug-food interactions===
The oral absorption (bioavailability) of zafirlukast is decreased by 40% when it is taken with high fat or high protein meals. To avoid this interaction, zafirlukast should be taken on an empty stomach. An empty stomach is classified as an hour before, or two hours after, consuming a meal.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Zafirlukast is an antagonist of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1), a receptor found throughout the smooth muscle of the lungs, within interstitial lung macrophages (white blood cells that operate in the interstitial space of the lungs), and rarely in epithelial cells. CystLT1 is a receptor for a specific class of leukotrienes that contain the amino acid cysteine. These cysteinyl leukotrienes include leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4, all of which are produced by inflammatory cells like eosinophils, basophils, and macrophages in the lungs. Through their action on CysLT1 these leukotrienes can trigger bronchoconstriction, a state in which the bronchial passages of the lungs constrict, leading to the characteristic, reactive airway symptoms associated with bronchial asthma. The other pro-inflammatory effects of leukotrienes, such as their inhibition of mucus clearance and their stimulation of mucus secretion and edema, are thought to play a role in the characteristic symptoms of allergic rhinitis (also called hay fever). By inhibiting the action of these specific leukotrienes, zafirlukast is thought to exert an anti-inflammatory effect against leukotriene-mediated inflammatory conditions.

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
Zafirlukast is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream following oral administration, reaching peak plasma levels within 3 hours of taking the dose. The peak plasma level is the maximum concentration of zafirlukast in the blood.

====Distribution====
Zafirlukast is moderately distributed into the body&#x27;s tissues, with an apparent steady state volume of distribution of 70 liters. Zafirlukast is highly plasma protein bound, 99% bound to albumin. Albumin is the most abundant protein found in human plasma and is capable of carrying and transporting drugs (like zafirlukast) throughout the body. &quot;In vivo&quot; research indicates that zafirlukast has low blood–brain barrier penetration. The blood–brain barrier is a protective system that prevents many chemicals from entering the brain.

====Metabolism====
Zafirlukast undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism into inactive metabolites. Zafirlukast is primarily metabolized by the enzyme CYP2C9 to a hydroxylated metabolite.

====Elimination====
Zafirlukast is primarily cleared through biliary excretion at a rate of 20 liters/hour. Zafirlukast is undetectable in urine. The mean terminal half-life ranges 8–16 hours, following linear kinetics up to doses of 80 mg.

===Pharmacogenomics===
====LTC4 synthase====
Genetic polymorphisms in the LTC4 synthase promoter may predict response to zafirlukast. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A444C (the wild-type DNA base adenine, at the 444th position on the gene, is mutated; cytosine is there instead), which is associated with a severe asthma phenotype, has been shown to decrease the clinical response to zafirlukast (both when the genetic alteration was heterozygous or homozygous).

====CYP2C9====
Zafirlukast is metabolized through the hepatic enzyme CYP2C9. SNPs that decrease the function of CYP2C9 (such as CYP2C9*3 and CYP2C9*13) may decrease the hepatic clearance of zafirlukast, leading to increased exposure of zafirlukast. Notably, the CYP2C9*3 polymorphism is more commonly encountered in people of south/central Asian ancestry (10.165%) compared to people of Caucasian (7.083%), African American (1.170%), African (1.033%), middle eastern (9.312%), and east Asian (3.365%) ancestry.

==Chemistry==
===Synthesis===
Zafirlukast can be synthesized by the following method:

===Physiochemical properties===
Pure zafirlukast is described as a fine, white to pale yellow, amorphous powder. It is practically insoluble in water, slightly soluble in methanol, and freely soluble in tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, and acetone.

==History==
Zafirlukast was the first cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist approved in the United States. Zafirlukast was approved in 1996.

==Society and culture==
===Economics===
While preliminary evidence suggests that zafirlukast may reduce healthcare costs, the cost-effectiveness of using zafirlukast has not been established.

===Brand names===
==Research==
===Mechanism of action===
There is some research to suggest that zafirlukast actually acts as a partial inverse agonist at the CysLT1 receptor, though zafirlukast is still classified as an antagonist at this receptor. The possible clinical significance of this effect, if true, is unknown.

===Other indications===
There is some evidence that suggests that zafirlukast may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic urticaria (hives), whether due to a known cause such as cold-exposure or due to an unknown cause (idiopathic). A pilot study indicated that zafirlukast may be of some benefit in cystic fibrosis. In the setting of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), a disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the lungs, zafirlukast has been shown to improve lung function.

==Veterinary use==
Zafirlukast is sometimes used for the treatment of bronchial asthma in cats.

<doc id="1045561" wikidata="Q202998" url="?curid=1045561" title="Zileuton">
<text>Zileuton (trade name Zyflo) is an orally active inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, and thus inhibits leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) formation, used for the maintenance treatment of asthma. Zileuton was introduced in 1996 by Abbott Laboratories and is now marketed in two formulations by Cornerstone Therapeutics Inc. under the brand names Zyflo and Zyflo CR. The original immediate-release formulation, Zyflo, is taken four times per day. The extended-release formulation, Zyflo CR, is taken twice daily.

Although the 600 mg immediate release tablet (Zyflo) and extended release formulation of zileuton are still available (Zyflo CR), the 300 mg immediate release tablet was withdrawn from the U.S. market on February 12, 2008.

==Pharmacotherapy==

===Indications and dosing===
Zileuton is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Zileuton is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks. Therapy with zileuton can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma.

The recommended dose of Zyflo is one 600 mg tablet, four times per day. The tablets may be split in half to make them easier to swallow. The recommended dose of Zyflo CR is two 600 mg extended-release tablets twice daily, within one hour after morning and evening meals, for a daily dose of 2400 mg. Do not split Zyflo CR tablets in half.

Related compounds include montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate). These two compounds are leukotriene receptor antagonists which block the action of specific leukotrienes, while zileuton inhibits leukotriene formation.

;Research
Research on mice suggests that Zileuton used alone or in combination with imatinib may inhibit chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It has also been researched in a mouse model of dementia.

===Contraindications and warnings===
The most serious side effect of Zyflo and Zyflo CR is a potential elevation of liver enzymes (in 2% of patients). Therefore, zileuton is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease or persistent hepatic function enzymes elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal. Hepatic function should be assessed prior to initiating Zyflo CR, monthly for the first 3 months, every 2–3 months for the remainder of the first year, and periodically thereafter.

Neuropsychiatric events, including sleep disorders and behavioral changes, may occur with Zyflo and Zyflo CR. Patients should be instructed to notify their healthcare provider if neuropsychiatric events occur while using Zyflo or Zyflo CR.

Zileuton is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 and thus has three clinically important drug interactions, which include increasing theophylline, and propranolol levels. It has been shown to lower theophylline clearance significantly, doubling the AUC and prolonging half-life by nearly 25%. Because of theophylline&#x27;s relation to caffeine (both being a methylxanthine, and theophylline being a metabolite of caffeine), caffeine&#x27;s metabolism and clearance may also be reduced, but there are no drug interaction studies between zileuton and caffeine. The &quot;R&quot;-isomer of warfarin metabolism and clearance is mainly affected by zileuton, while the &quot;S&quot;-isomer is not (because of metabolism via different enzymes). This can lead to an increase in prothrombin time.

==Chemistry==
Zileuton is an active oral inhibitor of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase, which forms leukotrienes, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid from arachidonic acid. The chemical name of zileuton is (±)-1-(1-Benzo[b]thien-2-ylethyl)-l-hydroxyurea.

The molecular formula of zileuton is C11H12N2O2S with a molecular weight of 236.29. The formulation from the manufacturer is a racemic mixture of &quot;R&quot;(+) and &quot;S&quot;(-) enantiomers.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Following oral administration zileuton is rapidly absorbed with a mean time to peak blood serum concentration of 1.7 hours and an average half-life elimination of 2.5 hours. Blood plasma concentrations are proportional to dose, whereas the absolute bioavailability is unknown.

The apparent volume of distribution of zileuton is approximately 1.2 L/kg. Zileuton is 93% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to albumin, with minor binding to alpha-1-acid glycoprotein.

Elimination of zileuton is primarily through metabolites in the urine (~95%) with the feces accounting for the next largest amount (~2%). The drug is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP1A2, 2C9, and 3A4.

==Adverse effects==
The most common adverse reactions reported by patients treated with Zyflo CR were sinusitis (6.5%), nausea (5%), and pharyngolaryngeal pain (5%) vs. placebo, 4%, 1.5%, and 4% respectively.

== Interactions ==

===Drug interactions===
Zileuton is a minor substrate of CYP1A2, 2C8/9, 3A4, and a weak inhibitor of CYP 1A2. The drug has been shown to increase the serum concentration or effects of theophylline, propranolol, and warfarin, although significant increase in prothrombin time is not obvious. It is advised that the doses of each medication be monitored and/or reduced accordingly.

===Other interactions===
The avoidance of alcohol is recommended due to increased risk of CNS depression as well as an increased risk of liver toxicity. In addition, the herbal supplement St. John&#x27;s wort may decrease the serum levels of zileuton.

==Overdose/toxicology==

===Symptoms===
Human experience of acute overdose with zileuton is limited. A patient in a clinical study took between 6.6 and 9.0 grams of zileuton immediate-release tablets in a single dose. Vomiting was inducted and the patient recovered without sequelae. Zileuton is not removed by dialysis.

The oral minimum lethal doses in mice and rats were 500-4000 and 300–1000 mg/kg, respectively (providing greater than 3 and 9 times the systemic exposure (AUC) achieved at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose, respectively). In dogs, at an oral dose of 1000 mg/kg (providing in excess of 12 times the systemic exposure (AUC) achieved at the maximum recommended human daily oral dose) no deaths occurred but nephritis was reported.

===Treatment===

Should an overdose occur, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage; usual precautions should be observed to maintain the airway. A Certified Poison Control Center should be consulted for up-to-date information on management of overdose with Zyflo CR.

<doc id="1045562" wikidata="Q886847" url="?curid=1045562" title="Lincoln Almond">
<text>Lincoln Carter Almond (June 16, 1936 – January 2, 2023) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 72nd Governor of Rhode Island from 1995 to 2003. A member of the Republican Party, he was previously the United States Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 1969 to 1978 and again from 1981 until 1993.

== Early life, education and early career ==
Almond was born on June 16, 1936, in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to Thomas Clifton Almond and Elsie (Carter) Almond. He grew up in Central Falls until his family moved to Lincoln in 1947. He attended nearby Central Falls High School because there was no high school in Lincoln at the time. He graduated Bachelor of Science degree from University of Rhode Island in 1959 and earned a Juris Doctor degree from Boston University School of Law in 1961. Afterward, he started his career as a practicing attorney in Rhode Island.

Almond was appointed Town Administrator of Lincoln, Rhode Island, in January 1963 and was subsequently elected to three terms, serving in that capacity until June 1969. As town administrator, Almond undertook significant upgrades of the municipal water system and a school construction program, including a high school, to accommodate a rapidly expanding population of school children. He also was responsible for the construction of a new police station and town hall in Lincoln. After his service as town administrator, Almond served as a director and later president of the Blackstone Valley Development Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation that developed industrial parks in Lincoln, Cumberland, and Smithfield.

== Tenure as U.S. Attorney, District of Rhode Island ==

Before being elected governor, Almond served as the U.S. Attorney for the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island under Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, from 1969 to 1978, and later from 1981 to 1993. With a total of 21 years of service, Almond was one of the longest-serving U.S. Attorneys in the District of Rhode Island. While serving as U.S. Attorney, Almond emphasized enforcement in the area of organized crime, drugs, and white collar crime, including political corruption.

Almond had a number of high-profile accomplishments during his tenure. In 1970, Attorney General Elliot Richardson created an advisory committee of 15 U.S. Attorneys to advise the Attorney General. Almond served on this committee advising Attorneys General Richardson, William Saxbe, Edward Levi, and Griffin Bell on matters of resource allocation, civil and criminal priorities, and federal legislation priorities. Almond oversaw significant drug prosecutions and drug forfeitures that received national attention. During Almond&#x27;s tenure, Providence, Rhode Island, served as the base of the Patriarca crime family, leading to several high level prosecutions by the New England U.S. Attorneys, including Almond. He supervised a number of political corruption cases primarily in Providence and Pawtucket.

== Tenure as governor ==

Almond ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Congress in 1968, and he was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for governor in 1978, when he was defeated by incumbent Governor J. Joseph Garrahy.
In what was considered an upset in the 1994 Republican primary for governor, Almond marked his political comeback by defeating the heavily favored Republican candidate, U.S. Rep. Ron Machtley. He went on to defeat Democratic State Sen. Myrth York, who had scored her own upset by defeating incumbent Gov. Bruce Sundlun in the Democratic primary. He was the first governor to serve a four-year term under changes to the Rhode Island Constitution, and was the first to be bound by a two-term limit. Previous statewide terms of office were two years, with no term limits.

=== Health care ===

Health care and human services was an emphasis during the Almond administration. &quot;RIte Care&quot;, the state public health care program for children was significantly expanded during his administration, he instituted an aggressive childhood immunization program, and expanded state funded prenatal care programs, resulting in lowered rates of low-weight births. Almond greatly increased the number of state-subsidized child care slots, standards for child care providers were raised, and health care through the state also was offered to child care providers. During the Almond administration, Rhode Island was among the states with the highest percentage of its residents with health insurance coverage.

=== Education ===

In the realm of higher education, Almond advocated strongly for passage of a 2000 bond referendum that included funding for a new Newport campus of the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI). With CCRI an affordable entryway to college for many lower income students, Almond was successful in having the tuition frozen there for most of his years in office. Almond directed funds to improve the buildings and dormitories at Rhode Island College (RIC), and promoted the building of the &quot;Nazarian Performing Arts Center&quot; at RIC.

As the first University of Rhode Island (URI) graduate to be elected governor, Almond made major investments in URI, starting with the physical infrastructure, which was badly neglected. The steam plant was upgraded and several dormitories were renovated and wired for Internet access. Several academic buildings were refurbished as well. The Ryan Center, a 7,600-seat sports and event complex that was completed in 2002, is located at One Lincoln Almond Way at URI.

=== Tax policy and regulatory reforms ===

Through tax incentives and regulatory reforms, the state was able to encourage the growth of industries such as financial services, biotechnology, and the marine trades. The historic preservation tax credit signed into law by Governor Almond in 2001 led to projects, such as the rehabilitation of the Masonic Temple as a hotel in Providence. The Quonset Davisville Port and Commerce Park, was greatly expanded in terms of number of businesses and level of employment. Almond was a strong advocate to transform the existing port at Quonset into a privately owned, compact container port.

To make the state more competitive, Almond was successful in overseeing a five-year plan to reduce the state&#x27;s income tax by 10% and to begin the phase out of the tax on capital gains. There were 45 other tax reductions enacted during Almond&#x27;s time in office, including instituting one of the nation&#x27;s highest research and development and investment tax credits.

=== Capital projects and infrastructure ===

The &quot;Rhode Island Capital Plan Fund&quot;, created by Almond, allowed the state to pay for projects out of current revenues instead of seeking funds from bonds. Every part of the state has benefited from the Rhode Island Capital Plan Fund, from World War II Memorial Park in Woonsocket to the new pavilion at Misquamicut State Beach in Westerly. The Governor directed funds to many of the state&#x27;s recreational areas, including the boat ramps in East Providence and Bristol, as well as fishing industry piers at Galilee and Newport. The years of renovating the Rhode Island State House was recognized by the National Trust for Historic Preservation in 2002.

During his tenure as governor, Almond was active in planning and authorizing a number of infrastructure projects in Quonset Point, including construction of Rhode Island Route 403. Additionally, he was planning for the construction of a third track along the rail line from Quonset Point to the point in Central Falls where the line branches off toward the CSX rail yard in Worcester, Massachusetts, including the raising of bridges to accommodate container and autoracks, thus allowing a heavy freight rail connection to most of the United States. The Iway project, a major relocation of Interstate 195 (Rhode Island-Massachusetts), was designed and construction began during the Almond administration.

=== Casinos and lottery ===

Almond was a strong opponent to the expansion of gambling in the state during his eight years as governor, despite the growth of two major casinos in nearby southeastern Connecticut. He successfully fought every attempt to bring casino gambling into Rhode Island, and repeatedly urged the Rhode Island Lottery Commission not to expand video lottery terminals at existing gaming establishments in the state.

=== Environmental policy ===

In the realm of environmental issues, as a result of the 1996 &quot;North Cape&quot; barge oil spill, Almond negotiated a safe dredging plan for Narragansett Bay with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The dredging project was important to allow direct delivery of petroleum products by ship to the ports of Providence and Fall River instead of barges that pose greater environmental risk. He also came to an agreement with the Narragansett Bay Commission on a funding plan and project scope for a major project to collect and store storm water runoff in the Providence area for storage and treatment before release into Narragansett Bay. However, Almond generated controversy in the fall of 2001 due to his refusal to declare a state of emergency when the town of Pascoag&#x27;s water was contaminated with MTBE.

== Later work ==
After leaving office, Almond was appointed in 2005 by Governor Donald Carcieri to lead an investigation of practices in the Beacon Mutual Insurance Company, a workers compensation insurer created by the State of Rhode Island in 1994. The highly critical report led to substantial changes of leadership and practices within the company.

In 2006, the Rhode Island General Assembly approved a voter referendum to allow Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment to operate a casino in partnership with the Narragansett Indian Tribe. Almond led a coalition of opponents to the proposal, and despite heavy advertising expenditures by Harrah&#x27;s, the proposal was defeated.

== Personal life and death ==
Lincoln Almond and his wife Marilyn lived in Kingston, Rhode Island, and Wellfleet, Massachusetts. They had two children. Their son, Lincoln Douglas Almond, became a federal magistrate judge in Rhode Island. Almond was an Episcopalian and a member of St. George&#x27;s Church in Central Falls.

Almond died on January 2, 2023, at the age of 86.

<text>Moshe Marzouk (; or Musa Lieto Marzuk, ; born 20 December 1926 – 31 January 1955) was an Egyptian Karaite Jew, who was hanged in 1955 for his involvement in a series of bombings in Cairo codenamed &quot;Operation Suzannah&quot;.

Marzouk was born in Cairo to a Karaite family who had emigrated from Tunisia in the early 20th century, though they retained French citizenship. While working as a surgeon at the Jewish Hospital in Cairo in the early 1950s, he was recruited as a spy by Israeli military intelligence, along with other young Egyptian Jews. In 1954 the group carried out a series of bombings, targeting the post office in Alexandria, two libraries in Cairo and Alexandria, and a movie theatre. There were no casualties. These actions triggered an Israeli political crisis later known as the Lavon Affair. Marzouk and his group were caught and tried, during which time they were allegedly tortured. Marzouk was executed in a Cairo prison. His remains were brought to Jerusalem and buried on Mount Herzl.

<text>Ørland Main Air Station (Norwegian: Ørland hovedflystasjon) is situated at the mouth of the Trondheimsfjorden in Ørland Municipality in Trøndelag county in the center of Norway. Ørland is operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force and is an important air base not only for Norway, but also for NATO. The air station is the base of F-35A Lightning II, AgustaWestland AW101 search and rescue helicopters and a location for E-3A &quot;Sentry&quot; AWACS. It is also the host of many NATO exercises.

==Operations==
Air Wing 132 is stationed at the main air station. Under it are most operations at the air station, including 331 Squadron, 332 Squadron, air defence squadron, base defence battalion, maintenance- and logistics units.

Other units represented are 330 Squadron (SAR helicopters), Cyber Defence Force and Defence Logistics Organization.

Ørland is the only air station on the Scandinavian Peninsula that has ground handling equipment for the E-3A Sentry AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System). It is considered a forward operations location (FOL), but not a base for these aircraft.

There is also a detachment of four Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters from the 330 Squadron at Sola Air Station to assist any emergency at sea or in other unreachable places.

==History==

===World War II===
Ørland Main Air Station was built by the prisoners of war (mostly Serbs, Russians and Poles) exploited by the occupation forces in 1941 during the German occupation of Norway. The Germans wanted an airfield so that they could interdict the Allied convoys to Murmansk. At first, German Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors were stationed here. In June 1942, a squadron of Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot;s rebased here, later a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s and then a squadron of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters.

The Germans decided to expand the airfield and built a second runway in 1944. This was later made the main runway. The Germans then made several taxiways and started planning a third runway. However, the war ended before the plans could be completed. 7000 Germans were stationed at Ørlandet during the war, with about 10 000 prisoners of war used as the work force. This meant that, at the end of the war, the Germans left a fully armed, defended airfield with docks, infrastructure and a cannon taken from the battleship &quot;Gneisenau&quot;.

===Post war===
After the war, a Norwegian Spitfire squadron was stationed here, but in 1946 the airfield was closed. All buildings were torn down and the wood transported to northern Norway to help rebuild Finnmark which the Germans had left in ruins. After that, the airfield was used for sporadic exercises.

It wasn&#x27;t until 1950 that the government decided that the airfield should be made a permanent deployment-airfield. In 1952, a new runway had been made, and in 1954, it was expanded to handle NATO forces. It was then the airfield got today&#x27;s looks. In October 1954, Squadron 338 was rebased from Sola and remains as the only fighter force at the airfield. 
In the summer of 1958, the SAM battery was established, and in August 1970, the detachment from Squadron 330 arrived. In November 1983, the airfield was customized to handle the NATO E-3A AWACS which routinely visits from Geilenkirchen air base to sustain the surveillance chain at the NATO border.

In February 2012 a proposition was passed in Stortinget which will make Ørland the principal air base of Norway and also replacing Bodø. The decision to move the other air station Bodø to Ørland is mainly due to the retreat from Cold War-era practices and the incorporation of the new F-35 Lightning II jet fighter into the Royal Norwegian Air Force which were recently ordered by the Norwegian government from Lockheed Martin. Beginning in 2012 the air base hosted the NATO trials for its joint technological interoperability exercises.

Ørland Main Air Station has facilities and stored equipment to receive United States Marine Corps fixed-wing aircraft which are maintained under the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway.

Between February and March 2021, the US Air Force deployed strategic bombers to Ørland as part of its Bomber Task Force Europe mission. Four B-1B Lancers and 200 personnel from 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron were deployed from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas.

<text>The Stubai Valley or Stubaital () is an alpine valley in Tyrol, Austria. It is the central valley of the Stubai Alps. The river Ruetz flows through the valley.

This 35-km long valley runs in northeastern direction from the main chain of the Alps to Schönberg im Stubaital, near Innsbruck. Below Fulpmes, the villages lie on terraces above the Ruetz on either side of the river. South of Neustift im Stubaital, the largest side valley Oberbergtal joins from the west. The ÖBB operates a 16-MW hydroelectric power plant in Fulpmes.

The following five municipalities lie in the valley: Schönberg im Stubaital, Mieders, Telfes, Fulpmes and Neustift im Stubaital. Public transportation from Innsbruck into the valley is available via the Stubaital bus route or the Stubai Valley Railway, which runs from Innsbruck to Fulpmes.

At the end of the Stubaital valley the Stubai Glacier is used as a ski resort.

<text>Michael Joel Zaslow (November 1, 1942 – December 6, 1998) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as villain Roger Thorpe on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a role he played from 1971 to 1980 and again from 1989 to 1997, earning multiple nominationsand one winat the Daytime Emmy Awards.

He also appeared as a guest in two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, notably in the series&#x27; inaugural episode in which his character, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewman Darnell, is the first character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; history to be killed off.

==Life and career==
Zaslow was born in Inglewood, California. He played Dick Hart on the CBS soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; and Dr. Peter Chernak on &quot;Love Is a Many Splendored Thing&quot;. He also played David Renaldi on ABC&#x27;s &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1983 to 1986. 

Zaslow guest-starred on a number of other television shows and soap operas, including &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Man Trap,&quot; the series&#x27; September 8, 1966 premiere of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, he played Crewman Darnell, the first Starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew member to be killed off. The incident sparked the first diagnosis of the now-famous line: &quot;He&#x27;s dead, Jim,&quot; by &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew-member Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley). He also appeared as Jordan in the episode &quot;I, Mudd&quot;. He costarred in the 1977 feature film&quot; You Light Up My Life&quot;, and appeared in the 1979 sci-fi movie &quot;Meteor&quot;.

Zaslow&#x27;s Broadway theatre credits included &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, and &quot;Onward Victoria&quot;.

Zaslow was also the godfather of actor Christian Slater.

However, it was for his work as Roger Thorpe on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; that Zaslow was always best known. One of the show&#x27;s central villains of the 1970s, his first onscreen &quot;death&quot; was voted the top scene in the show&#x27;s history when the series celebrated its 50th anniversary. In the late 1980s, he returned to the show and, once again, became a central figure. Zaslow received multiple Daytime Emmy nominations (and won once) for his work in the role, and continually appeared on both critics&#x27; and fans&#x27; lists of favorite soap opera performers.

===Illness and death===
In 1997, he began to experience difficulty speaking. When it became noticeable on screen, he was placed on leave at &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. (There are conflicting stories as to whether Zaslow was then fired; there was for some time a legal action against &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and sponsor Procter &amp; Gamble, which was eventually settled.) It was some time before Zaslow was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease (it was first thought he had suffered a stroke). Zaslow did not return to &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, and his role was briefly recast before being written off. (In 2004, Zaslow&#x27;s character on &quot;Guiding Light&quot; died off-screen.)

Zaslow was hired at &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1998 to play David Renaldi again, appearing first in May of that year, his condition being written into the storyline. He made numerous appearances over the next seven months before he was too ill to continue working.

Zaslow died from a heart attack on December 6, 1998, at his New York City home. He was survived by his wife, psychologist/writer Susan Hufford; and two daughters, Helena and Marika.

His final appearance on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was televised December 1. The character of David Renaldi was soon referred to as living off-screen, with mentions of him eventually dropped.

==Legacy==
Hufford founded ZazAngels, a foundation that seeks to raise funds in order to find a cure for Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. Several of Zaslow&#x27;s &quot;Guiding Light&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; castmates, along with many Broadway-based theater luminaries, have participated in tributes that were fundraisers for ZazAngels. Hufford released a book about Zaslow and his fight with ALS, titled &quot;Not That Man Anymore&quot;. Zaslow had begun writing the book several years earlier.

Helena Zaslow died on December 28, 2004, in Connecticut at age 19, only days after completing her first semester at Wellesley College.

Hufford died from cancer on November 28, 2006.

<text>Arena (An Absurd Notion) is a concept concert video filmed during the course of Duran Duran&#x27;s 1984 Sing Blue Silver North American Tour in support of the album &quot;Seven and the Ragged Tiger&quot;.

==Background==
Instead of releasing a straight concert video, Duran Duran and director Russell Mulcahy chose to play with the origins of the band&#x27;s name (the 1968 film &quot;Barbarella&quot;), and added a storyline and surreal elements that are interwoven with footage of the band performing on stage.

The film&#x27;s villain, the evil Dr. Durand Durand (played by Milo O&#x27;Shea, reprising his role from &quot;Barbarella&quot;) has crash landed on Earth and is surprised and confused to find teenagers chanting his name. When he discovers that they are not chanting for him, but for an upstart pop group, he sets up shop beneath the concert arena and attempts to wreak havoc on the band that stole his name. Of course, he and his henchmen fail at every turn and Duran Duran continue to perform, seemingly unaware of the evil doctor&#x27;s plans.

The video also included Russell Mulcahy&#x27;s long-form video for &quot;The Wild Boys&quot;. It was meant to be a teaser for a full-length feature film of the same name, based on the 1971 novel &quot;The Wild Boys: A Book of the Dead&quot; by William S. Burroughs. However, that film was never made.

The expensive sets for the conceptual portions of &quot;Arena&quot; and &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; were built in the massive 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios. Some of the segments were also filmed at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, where free tickets were given to fans.

In addition to O&#x27;Shea, the American actress Jennifer Connelly also appears in the video, walking across an empty stage in one segment.

A picture book of the movie, &quot;Arena: The Book&quot; (), was released in 1985.

A live album, also called &quot;Arena&quot;, was released in late 1984. It featured the two singles &quot;The Wild Boys&quot; and &quot;Save a Prayer (Live)&quot;. The video for &quot;Save a Prayer (Live)&quot; is included as a DVD extra on the 2004 &quot;Arena&quot; DVD release.

The DVD for &quot;Arena&quot; was released in April 2004 and includes as an extra &quot;The Making of Arena&quot; behind the scenes documentary that was originally released as a separate videotape.

A 2-in-1 DVD set with both &quot;Arena&quot; and &quot;Sing Blue Silver&quot; has also been released by EMI.

==&quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot;==

The Oakland, California concerts that were filmed for &quot;Arena (An Absurd Notion)&quot; were also edited to form the one-hour &quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot; concert video.

&quot;As the Lights Go Down&quot; is essentially the &quot;Arena&quot; video with only the music, although the live footage for many songs was edited differently. This version was never released on any consumer video format and was only broadcast on television, first on Cinemax then later on MTV and other TV channels.

<text>The Mediterranean Games is a multi-sport event organised by the International Committee of Mediterranean Games (CIJM). It is held every four years among athletes from countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea in Africa, Asia and Europe. The first Mediterranean Games were held in 1951 in Alexandria, Egypt, while the most recent games were held in 2022 in Oran, Algeria.

== History ==

The idea was proposed at the 1948 Summer Olympics by Muhammed Taher Pasha, chairman of the Egyptian Olympic Committee and vice-president of the International Olympic Committee (I.O.C.), assisted by the Greek member of the I.O.C. Ioannis Ketseas. Separate Mediterranean sports events preceded the games. From 1947 to 1949, the Mediterranean Athletics Championships were contested, and the Mediterranean Cup football competition was held in 1949 and 1950. The first official Mediterranean Games were held in Egypt in 1951.

The Games were inaugurated in October 1951, in Alexandria, Egypt, in honour of Muhammed Taher Pasha, with contests being held in 13 sports along with the participation of 734 athletes from 10 countries. In 1955, in Barcelona, during the II Games, the set up was decided of a Supervisory and Controlling Body for the Games, a kind of Executive Committee. The decisions were finally materialized on 16 June 1961, and the said Body was named, upon a Greek notion, ICMG (International Committee for the Mediterranean Games). Twelve countries have hosted the Mediterranean Games: four from Africa: Egypt (1951), Tunisia (1967, 2001), Algeria (1975, 2022) and Morocco (1983); six from Europe: Spain (1955, 2005, 2018), Italy (1963, 1997, 2009), Turkey (1971, 2013), Yugoslavia (1979), Greece (1991) and France (1993) and two from Asia: Lebanon (1959) and Syria (1987).

The first eleven games took place one year before the Summer Olympic Games. Since 1993, games have been held the year after the Olympic Games. This transition means that the only time the Mediterranean Games were not held four years after the previous Games was in 1993, when Languedoc-Roussillon in France hosted the Games just two years after Athens. In 2018, the Mediterranean Games calendar was reset again when Tarragona hosted the Games in the mid-even year between the Summer Olympic Games (and the same year as the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Cup).

== Description ==
The Mediterranean Games, in terms of the preparation and composition of the National Delegation, are held under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee and the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC).

Athens is the permanent seat of the ICMG (regardless of who the President might be) and the committee&#x27;s General Secretary is Greek. This comes as a further tribute to Greece, highlighting its leading role with regard to the function and strengthening of the institution. Except that Greece bailed out of its 2013 Mediterranean Games commitment when the two cities of Volos and Larissa were supposed to host the 2013 edition of the Games. But because of Greece&#x27;s financial troubles, they had to give that up and the 2013 honors went instead to Turkey, with the city of Mersin rescuing the 2013 edition of the Games instead.

== Participating countries ==

At present, 26 countries participate in the games:

*Africa: Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia
*Asia: Lebanon and Syria.
*Europe: Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Kosovo, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Portugal, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain and Turkey.

Kosovo was accepted as a member of the International Committee of Mediterranean Games in October 2015 and participated for the first time in the 2018 Mediterranean Games in Tarragona, Spain. One athlete representing the Vatican City participated in an unofficial (&quot;non-scoring&quot;) manner in the women&#x27;s half marathon event at the 2022 Mediterranean Games in Oran, Algeria.

Of all the National Olympic Committees within the Olympic Movement bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Israel and Palestine have not participated in the games, nor has Great Britain who represents the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar and Akrotiri and Dhekelia.

In the case of Israel, Allen Guttman in &quot;The Games Must Go On&quot; argued that Israel&#x27;s exclusion is both antisemitic and politically motivated due to antagonism towards Israel by the participating Muslim and Arab nations. The IOC&#x27;s Avery Brundage was not supportive of Israel&#x27;s desire to compete, saying: &quot;I cannot understand why anyone wants to go where he is not wanted&quot;. The International Amateur Athletics Federation pushed the issue at the 1959 Mediterranean Games in Beirut by refusing to grant permission to hold an athletics competition unless Israel were allowed to compete. Lebanese games organizer Gabriel Gemayel conceded to this, but sidestepped the ruling by holding a parallel &quot;Lebanese Games&quot; comprising athletics events between the present nations alongside the official Mediterranean Games competitions. In September 2023, European Olympic Committees president Spyros Capralos called on the International Committee of Mediterranean Games to open a discussion about admitting both Israel and Palestine as members.

There are countries not bordering the Mediterranean Sea which nonetheless participate: Portugal, Andorra, Kosovo, San Marino, Serbia and North Macedonia. Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia were all formerly part of Yugoslavia, which competed until its breakup and dissolution.

The Hellenic Olympic Committee has suggested that nine more countries that do not satisfy geographic criteria could be allowed to participate, such as Bulgaria and Jordan. Portugal competed in the 2018 Mediterranean Games after a decision which approved Portugal as effective National Olympic Committee.

== Flag ==

The symbol of the Mediterranean Games consists of three rings representing Asia, Africa and Europe, the three continents involved in this competition. The rings dissolve in a wavy line in their lower part, as if they were immersed in the Mediterranean Sea. During the closing ceremony, the flag is transferred to the country of the city chosen to host the next Mediterranean Games.

== Hosts ==
All host cities have been coastal and all but one on the Mediterranean coast (Casablanca is on the Atlantic coast).

<text>Cape Krusenstern (Iñupiaq: &quot;Nuvua&quot; &#x27;its point&#x27;) is a cape on the northwestern coast of the U.S. state of Alaska, located near the village of Kivalina at .

It is bounded by Kotzebue Sound to the south and the Chukchi Sea to the west, and consists of a series of beach ridges and swales with numerous ponds and lakes. The entire shoreline of the cape consists of barrier bars, lagoons and spits.

Cape Krusenstern was named for the Baltic German explorer Adam Johann von Krusenstern, who explored the area under the Russian flag.

In 1978, the area was declared the Cape Krusenstern National Monument.

Cape Krusenstern in Alaska should not be confused with the Cape Krusenstern at the west end of Coronation Gulf in northern Canada.

<text>The Wright Flyer (also known as the Kitty Hawk, Flyer&quot; Ior the1903 &quot;Flyer) made the first sustained flight by a manned heavier-than-air powered and controlled aircraft on December 17, 1903. Invented and flown by brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright, it marked the beginning of the pioneer era of aviation.

The aircraft is a single-place biplane design with anhedral (drooping) wings, front double elevator (a canard) and rear double rudder. It used a gasoline engine powering two pusher propellers. Employing &quot;wing warping&quot;, it was relatively unstable and very difficult to fly.

The Wright brothers flew it four times in a location now part of the town of Kill Devil Hills, about south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The airplane flew on its fourth and final flight, but was damaged on landing, and wrecked minutes later when powerful gusts blew it over.

The aircraft never flew again but was shipped home and subsequently restored by Orville. The aircraft was initially displayed in a place of honor at the London Science Museum until 1948 when the resolution of an acrimonious priority dispute finally allowed it to be displayed in the Smithsonian. It is now exhibited in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.

==Design and construction==
The &quot;Flyer&quot; was based on the Wrights&#x27; experience testing gliders at Kitty Hawk between 1900 and 1902. Their last glider, the 1902 Glider, led directly to the design of the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;.

The Wrights built the aircraft in 1903 using spruce for straight members of the airframe (such as wing spars) and ash wood for curved components (wing ribs). The wings were designed with a 1-in-20 camber. The fabric for the wing was 100% cotton muslin called &quot;Pride of the West&quot;, a type used for women&#x27;s underwear. It had a warp of 107 threads per inch, a weft of 102, and a total thread count of 209.
Since they could not find a suitable automobile engine for the task, they commissioned their employee Charlie Taylor to build a new design from scratch, a lightweight gasoline engine, weighing , with a fuel tank. A sprocket chain drive, borrowing from bicycle technology, powered the twin propellers, which were also made by hand. In order to avoid the risk of torque effects from affecting the aircraft handling, one drive chain was crossed over so that the propellers rotated in opposite directions.
According to Taylor:
The long propellers were based on airfoil number 9 from their wind tunnel data, which provided the best &quot;gliding angle&quot; for different angles of attack. The propellers were connected to the engine by chains from the Indianapolis Chain Company, with a sprocket gear reduction of 23-to-8. Wilbur had calculated that slower turning blades generated greater thrust, and two of them were better than a single blade turning faster. Made from three laminations of spruce, the tips were covered with duck canvas, and the entire propeller painted with aluminum paint.

On November 5, 1903, the brothers tested their engine on the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; at Kitty Hawk, but before they could tune the engine, the propeller hubs came loose. The drive shafts were sent back to Dayton for repair, and returned on 20 November. A hairline crack was discovered in one of the propeller shafts. Orville returned to Dayton on 30 November to make new spring steel shafts. On December 12, the brothers installed the new shafts on the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; and tested it on their launching rail system that included a wheeled launching dolly. According to Orville:

In practice tests, they were able to achieve a propeller rpm of 351, with a thrust of , more than enough for their flyer.

The &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; was a canard biplane configuration, with a wingspan of , a camber of 1-20, a wing area of , and a length of . The right wing was longer because the engine was heavier than Orville or Wilbur. Unoccupied, the machine weighed . As with the gliders, the pilot flew lying on his stomach on the lower wing with his head toward the front of the craft in an effort to reduce drag. The pilot was left of center while the engine was right of center. He steered by moving a hip cradle in the direction he wished to fly. The cradle pulled wires to warp the wings, and simultaneously turn the rudder, for coordinated flight. The pilot operated the elevator lever with his left hand, while holding a strut with his right. The &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;″s &quot;runway&quot; was a track of 2x4s, which the brothers nicknamed the &quot;Junction Railroad&quot;. The &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; skids rested on a launching dolly, consisting of a plank, with a wheeled wooden section. The two tandem ball bearing wheels were made from bicycle hubs. A restraining wire held the plane back, while the engine was running and the propellers turning, until the pilot was ready to be released.

The &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; had three instruments on board. A Veeder engine revolution recorder measured the number of propeller turns. A stopwatch recorded the flight time, and a Richard hand anemometer, attached to the front center strut, recorded the distance covered in meters.

==Flight trials at Kitty Hawk==

Upon returning to Kitty Hawk in 1903, the Wrights completed assembly of the &quot;Flyer&quot; while practicing on the 1902 Glider from the previous season. On December 14, 1903, they felt ready for their first attempt at powered flight. With the help of men from the nearby government life-saving station, the Wrights moved the &quot;Flyer&quot; and its launching rail to the incline of a nearby sand dune, Big Kill Devil Hill, intending to make a gravity-assisted takeoff. The brothers tossed a coin to decide who would get the first chance at piloting, and Wilbur won. The airplane left the rail, but Wilbur pulled up too sharply, stalled, and came down after covering in 3 seconds, sustaining little damage.

Repairs after the abortive first flight took three days. When they were ready again on December 17, the wind was averaging more than , so the brothers laid the launching rail on level ground, pointed into the wind, near their camp. This time the wind, instead of an inclined launch, provided the necessary airspeed for takeoff. Because Wilbur had already had the first chance, Orville took his turn at the controls. His first flight lasted 12 seconds for a total distance of – shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747.

Taking turns, the Wrights made four brief, low-altitude flights that day. The flight paths were all essentially straight; turns were not attempted. Each flight ended in a bumpy and unintended landing. The last flight, by Wilbur, covered in 59 seconds, much longer than each of the three previous flights of 120, 175 and 200 feet (, and ) in 12, 12, and 15 seconds respectively. The fourth flight&#x27;s landing broke the front elevator supports, which the Wrights hoped to repair for a possible flight to Kitty Hawk village. Soon after, a heavy gust picked up the &quot;Flyer&quot; and tumbled it end over end, damaging it beyond any hope of quick repair. It was never flown again.
In 1904, the Wrights continued refining their designs and piloting techniques in order to obtain fully controlled flight. Major progress toward this goal was achieved with a new machine called the Wright Flyer II in 1904 and even more decisively in 1905 with the third, Wright Flyer III, in which Wilbur made a 39-minute, nonstop circling flight on October 5.

==Influence==
The &quot;Flyer&quot; series of aircraft were the first to achieve controlled heavier-than-air flight, but some of the mechanical techniques the Wrights used to accomplish this were not influential for the development of aviation as a whole, although their theoretical achievements were. The &quot;Flyer&quot; design depended on wing-warping controlled by a hip cradle under the pilot, and a foreplane or &quot;canard&quot; for pitch control, features which would not scale and produced a hard-to-control aircraft. The Wrights&#x27; pioneering use of &quot;roll control&quot; by twisting the wings to change wingtip angle in relation to the airstream led to the more practical use of ailerons by their imitators, such as Glenn Curtiss and Henri Farman. The Wrights&#x27; original concept of simultaneous coordinated roll and yaw control (rear rudder deflection), which they discovered in 1902, perfected in 1903–1905, and patented in 1906, represents the solution to controlled flight and is used today on virtually every fixed-wing aircraft. The Wright patent included the use of hinged rather than warped surfaces for the forward elevator and rear rudder. Other features that made the &quot;Flyer&quot; a success were highly efficient wings and propellers, which resulted from the Wrights&#x27; exacting wind tunnel tests and made the most of the marginal power delivered by their early homebuilt engines; slow flying speeds (and hence survivable accidents); and an incremental test/development approach. The future of aircraft design lay with rigid wings, ailerons and rear control surfaces. A British patent of 1868 for aileron technology had apparently been completely forgotten by the time the 20th century dawned.

After a single statement to the press in January 1904 and a failed public demonstration in May, the Wright Brothers did not publicize their efforts, and other aviators who were working on the problem of flight (notably Alberto Santos-Dumont) were thought by the press to have preceded them by many years. After their successful demonstration flight in France on August 8, 1908, they were accepted as pioneers and received extensive media coverage.

In 1909, the Wright Military &quot;Flyer&quot; became the world&#x27;s first military aircraft after successful tests on June 3, 1909. This airplane was purchased by the army but was never used in combat; it was, however, used to train some pilots. It was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1911 and is on display in the &quot;Early Flight&quot; exhibit at the National Air and Space Museum. A modified version, the Wright Model B, was produced in larger numbers by the Wright brothers and was used by the army &quot;for training pilots and conducting aerial experiments&quot; including tests of &quot;a bombsight and bomb-dropping device&quot;.

The issue of patent control was correctly seen as critical by the Wrights, and they acquired a wide American patent, intended to give them ownership of basic aerodynamic control. This was fought in both American and European courts. European designers were little affected by the litigation and continued their own development. The legal fight in the U.S. had a crushing effect on the nascent American aircraft industry, and even by the time of America&#x27;s entry into World War I, in 1917, the U.S. had &quot;only six [American made] airplanes, and fourteen trained pilots&quot;. The numbers increased substantially over the subsequent years but during the war, all of the fighter aircraft flown by Americans were designed and built in Europe.

===Stability===
The &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; was conceived as a control-canard, as the Wrights were more concerned with control than stability. It was found to be unstable and barely controllable. During flight tests near Dayton the Wrights added ballast to the nose of the aircraft to move the center of gravity forward and reduce pitch instability. The Wright Brothers did not understand the basics of pitch stability of the canard configuration. F.E.C. Culick stated, &quot;The backward state of the general theory and understanding of flight mechanics hindered them... Indeed, the most serious gap in their knowledge was probably the basic reason for their unwitting mistake in selecting their canard configuration.&quot;

According to aviation author Harry Combs, &quot;Wright designs incorporated a &#x27;balanced&#x27; forward elevator...the movable surface extending an equal distance on both sides of its hinge or pivot axis, as opposed to an &#x27;in-trail&#x27; configuration... which would have enhanced controllability in flight.&quot; Orville wrote of the elevator, which the brothers called a &quot;front rudder&quot;, &quot;I found the control of the front rudder quite difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center and thus had a tendency to turn itself when started so that the rudder was turned too far on one side and then too far on the other.&quot; Thus, these early flights suffered from overcontrol.

==After Kitty Hawk==
The Wright Brothers returned home to Dayton for Christmas after the flights of the Kitty Hawk &quot;Flyer&quot;. While they had abandoned their other gliders, they realized the historical significance of the &quot;Flyer&quot;. They shipped the heavily damaged craft back to Dayton, where it remained stored in crates behind a Wright Company shed for nine years. The Great Dayton Flood of March 1913 covered the &quot;Flyer&quot; in mud and water for 11 days.

Charlie Taylor relates in a 1948 article that the &quot;Flyer&quot; nearly got disposed of by the Wrights. In early 1912 Roy Knabenshue, the Wrights Exhibition team manager, had a conversation with Wilbur and asked Wilbur what they planned to do with the &quot;Flyer&quot;. Wilbur said they most likely will burn it, as they had the 1904 machine. According to Taylor, Knabenshue talked Wilbur out of disposing of the machine for historical purposes.

In 1910 the Wrights offered the &quot;Flyer&quot; as an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution, but the Smithsonian declined, saying it would be willing to display other aeronautical artifacts from the brothers. Wilbur died in 1912, and in 1916 Orville brought the &quot;Flyer&quot; out of storage and prepared it for display at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He replaced parts of the wing covering, the props, and the engine&#x27;s crankcase, crankshaft, and flywheel. The crankcase, crankshaft, and flywheel of the original engine had been sent to the Aero Club of America in New York for an exhibit in 1906 and were never returned to the Wrights. The replacement crankcase, crankshaft and flywheel came from the experimental engine Charlie Taylor had built in 1904 and used for testing in the bicycle shop. A replica crankcase of the &quot;Flyer&quot; is on display at the visitor center at the Wright Brothers National Memorial.

===Debate with the Smithsonian===
The Smithsonian Institution, and primarily its then-secretary Charles Walcott, refused to give credit to the Wright Brothers for the first powered, controlled flight of an aircraft. Instead, they honored the former Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Pierpont Langley, whose 1903 tests of his Aerodrome on the Potomac were not successful. Walcott was a friend of Langley and wanted to see Langley&#x27;s place in aviation history restored. In 1914, Glenn Curtiss had recently exhausted the appeal process in a patent infringement legal battle with the Wrights. Curtiss sought to prove Langley&#x27;s machine, which failed piloted tests nine days before the Wrights&#x27; successful flight in 1903, capable of controlled, piloted flight in an attempt to invalidate the Wrights&#x27; wide-sweeping patents.

The Aerodrome was removed from exhibit at the Smithsonian and prepared for flight at Keuka Lake, New York. Curtiss called the preparations &quot;restoration&quot; claiming that the only addition to the design was pontoons to support testing on the lake but critics including patent attorney Griffith Brewer called them alterations of the original design. Curtiss flew the modified &quot;Aerodrome&quot;, hopping a few feet off the surface of the lake for 5 seconds at a time.

Between 1916 and 1928, the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; was prepared and assembled for exhibition under the supervision of Orville by Wright Company mechanic Jim Jacobs several times. It was briefly exhibited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1916, the New York Aero Shows in 1917 and 1919, a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting in Dayton, Ohio in 1918, and the National Air Races in Dayton in 1924.

In 1925, Orville attempted to pressure the Smithsonian by warning that he would send the &quot;Flyer&quot; to the Science Museum in London if the Institution refused to recognize his and Wilbur&#x27;s accomplishment. The threat did not achieve its intended effect, and on January 28, 1928, Orville shipped the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; to London for display at the museum. It remained there in &quot;the place of honour&quot;, except during World War II when it was moved to an underground storage facility away, near Corsham.

In 1942, the Smithsonian Institution, under a new secretary, Charles Abbot, published a list of 35 Curtiss modifications to the &quot;Aerodrome&quot; and a retraction of its long-held claims for the craft. Abbot went on to list four regrets including the role the Institution played in supporting unsuccessful defendants in patent litigation by the Wrights, misinformation about modifications made to the Aerodrome after &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;″s first flight, and public statements attributing the &quot;first aeroplane capable of sustained free flight with a man&quot; to Secretary Langley. The entry in the 1942 Annual Report of Smithsonian Institution begins with the statement &quot;It is everywhere acknowledged that the Wright brothers were the first to make sustained flights in a heavier-than-air machine at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903&quot; and closes with a promise that &quot;Should Dr. Wright decide to deposit the plane ... it would be given the highest place of honor which it is due&quot;.

The following year, Orville, after exchanging several letters with Abbot, agreed to return the &quot;Flyer&quot; to the United States. The &quot;Flyer&quot; stayed at the Science Museum until a replica could be built, based on the original. This change of heart by the Smithsonian is also mired in controversy – the &quot;Flyer&quot; was sold to the Smithsonian under several contractual conditions, one of which reads:

On October 18, 1948, the official handover of the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; was made to Livingston L. Satterthwaite, the American Civil Air Attaché at a ceremony attended by representatives of the various flying organizations in the UK and by some British aviation pioneers such as Sir Alliott Verdon-Roe.

On November 11, 1948, the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; arrived in North America on board the &quot;Mauretania&quot; with 1,111 passengers. When the liner docked at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Paul E. Garber of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air Museum met the aircraft and took command of the proceedings, overseeing its transfer to the US Navy aircraft carrier, the USS &quot;Palau&quot;, which repatriated the aircraft by way of New York Harbor. The rest of the journey to Washington continued on flatbed truck. While in Halifax Garber met John A. D. McCurdy, at the time the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia. McCurdy as a young man had been a member of Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s team Aerial Experiment Association, which included Glenn Curtiss, and later a famous pioneer pilot. During the stay at Halifax, Garber and McCurdy reminisced about the pioneer aviation days and the Wright Brothers. McCurdy also offered Garber any assistance he needed to get the &quot;Flyer&quot; home.

===In the Smithsonian===
The &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; was put on display in the Arts and Industries Building of the Smithsonian on December 17, 1948, 45 years to the day after the aircraft&#x27;s only successful flights. (Orville did not live to see this, as he had died that January.) In 1976, it was moved to the Milestones of Flight Gallery of the new National Air and Space Museum. Since 2003 it has resided in a special exhibit in the museum titled &quot;The Wright Brothers and the Invention of the Aerial Age,&quot; in recognition of the 100th anniversary of their first flight.

====1985 restoration====

In 1981, discussion began on the need to restore the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; from the aging it sustained after many decades on display. During the ceremonies celebrating the 78th anniversary of the first flights, Mrs. Harold S. Miller (Ivonette Wright, Lorin&#x27;s daughter), one of the Wright brothers&#x27; nieces, presented the Museum with the original covering of one wing of the &quot;Flyer&quot;, which she had received in her inheritance from Orville. She expressed her wish to see the aircraft restored.

The fabric covering on the aircraft at the time, which came from the 1927 restoration, was discolored and marked with water spots. Metal fasteners holding the wing uprights together had begun to corrode, marking the nearby fabric.

Work began in 1985. The restoration was supervised by Senior Curator Robert Mikesh and assisted by Wright Brothers expert Tom Crouch. Museum director Walter J. Boyne decided to perform the restoration in full view of the public.

The wooden framework was cleaned, and corrosion on metal parts removed. The covering was the only part of the aircraft replaced. The new covering was more accurate to the original than that of the 1927 restoration. To preserve the original paint on the engine, the restorers coated it in inert wax before putting on a new coat of paint. The effects of the 1985 restoration were intended to last 75 years (to 2060) before another restoration would be required.

==Reproductions==

In 1978, 23-year-old Ken Kellett built a replica &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; in Colorado and flew it at Kitty Hawk on the 75th and 80th anniversaries of the first flight there. Construction took a year and cost $3,000.

As the 100th anniversary on December 17, 2003, approached, the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission along with other organizations opened bids for companies to recreate the original flight. The Wright Experience, led by Ken Hyde, won the bid and painstakingly recreated reproductions of the original &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;, plus many of the prototype gliders and kites and subsequent Wright aircraft. The completed &quot;Flyer&quot; reproduction was brought to Kitty Hawk and pilot Kevin Kochersberger attempted to recreate the original flight at 10:35 on December 17, 2003, on level ground near the bottom of Kill Devil Hill. Although the aircraft had previously made several successful test flights, poor weather, rain, and weak winds prevented a successful flight on the anniversary. Hyde&#x27;s reproduction is displayed at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

The Los Angeles Section of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) built a full-scale replica of the 1903 &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; between 1979 and 1993 using plans from the original &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; published by the Smithsonian Institution in 1950. Constructed in advance of the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers&#x27; first flight, the replica was intended for wind tunnel testing to provide a historically accurate aerodynamic database of the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; design. The aircraft went on display at the March Field Air Museum in Riverside, California. Numerous static display-only, nonflying reproductions are on display around the United States and across the world, making this perhaps the most reproduced single aircraft of the &quot;pioneer&quot; era in history, rivaling the number of copies – some of which are airworthy – of Louis Blériot&#x27;s cross-Channel Bleriot XI from 1909.
==Artifacts==
In 1969, portions of the original fabric and wood from the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot; traveled to the Moon and its surface in Neil Armstrong&#x27;s personal preference kit aboard the Apollo 11 Lunar Module &quot;Eagle&quot;, and then back to Earth in the Command module &quot;Columbia&quot;. 
This artifact is on display at the visitors center at the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

In 1986, separate portions of original wood and fabric, as well as a note by Orville Wright, were taken by North Carolina native astronaut Michael Smith aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; on mission STS-51-L, which was destroyed soon after liftoff. The portions of wood and fabric and Wright&#x27;s note were recovered from the wreck of the Shuttle and are on display at the North Carolina Museum of History.

A small piece of the &quot;Wright Flyer&quot;″s wing fabric is attached to a cable underneath the solar panel of the helicopter &quot;Ingenuity&quot;, which became the first vehicle to perform a controlled atmospheric flight on Mars on April 19, 2021. Before moving on for further exploration and testing, &quot;Ingenuity&quot;″s first base on Mars was named Wright Brothers Field.

<doc id="1045611" wikidata="Q3376840" url="?curid=1045611" title="Peter Rehberg">
<text>Peter Rehberg (29 June 1968 – 22 July 2021), also known as Pita, was a British-Austrian composer of electronic audio works. He was the head of Editions Mego, which he founded in 2006 as a successor to Mego.

==Early life==
Rehberg was born in Tottenham on 29 June 1968. He grew up in Hertfordshire, before relocating to Austria, his father&#x27;s country of origin.

==Career==
Rehberg became associated with Mego in the latter part of 1994. He consequently released his first single early the following year, which was also the first release in the record label&#x27;s catalogue. He followed this up with his debut album titled &quot;Seven Tons for Free&quot; in 1996, released under the name Pita. Three years later, Rehberg received Prix Ars Electronica Distinction Award for Digital Musics, alongside Christian Fennesz and the label itself.

Rehberg cooperated with various musicians such as Mika Vainio, Charlemagne Palestine and Oren Ambarchi. He produced music with Ramon Bauer starting in 1997 as Rehberg &amp; Bauer. After Mego folded in 2005, Rehberg revived the label the following year as Editions Mego. He also collaborated with Stephen O&#x27;Malley starting in 2006, releasing six drone doom albums as KTL. With Fennesz and Jim O&#x27;Rourke, he founded the project Fenn O&#x27;Berg.

Rehberg released &quot;A Bas la Culture Marchande&quot; in 2007, followed by the live collaboration &quot;Colchester&quot; (2008) and the cassette &quot;Mesmer&quot; (2010). He started an archival project in 2012 called Recollection GRM. It reissued music by the Groupe de Recherches Musicales collective, including by Pierre Schaeffer, Bernard Parmegiani, Iannis Xenakis, and Beatriz Ferreyra.

In an interview conducted in 2016, Rehberg stated that he did not want to peddle music &quot;in its own little box&quot;, which he felt was the norm at present. Describing his impression regarding timbre, he believed that &quot;dissonance and resonance have to co-exist for the other to work&quot;. François Bonnet, who collaborated with Rehberg on Recollection GRM, felt that his music came to be more dense as his career progressed. He described how it retained its &quot;radical and bold&quot; character, while becoming &quot;deeper, more ambivalent, more moving&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rehberg was in a domestic partnership with Laura Siegmund until his death. He was previously in a relationship with Isabelle Piechaczyk, with whom he had one child.

Rehberg died on 22 July 2021. He was 53, and had suffered a heart attack prior to his death.

<doc id="1045615" wikidata="Q357751" url="?curid=1045615" title="Serles">
<text>Serles (2,718 m) is a mountain of the Stubai Alps in the Austrian state of Tyrol, Austria, between the Stubai Valley and Wipptal, near the Italian border. Its nickname is &quot;Altar von Tirol&quot;, literally the &quot;Altar of Tyrol&quot;. It has several lower peaks, including Sonnenstein () to the north.

Located on the edge of long ridge traversing east from Habicht, it is a popular scrambling peak and can get very crowded in the summer. The summit provides excellent view of the Stubai Alps and Zillertal Alps.

It is accessible via the Serlesjöchl:
* from Matrei am Brenner in Wipptal via Maria Waldrast (the easiest route),
* from Fulpmes and Kampl in Stubaital via Wildeben (which is just as easy, if it was not for the extra altitude to climb).

<doc id="1045626" wikidata="Q194803" url="?curid=1045626" title="Yefet ben Ali">
<text>Yefet ben Ali () was perhaps the foremost Karaite commentator on the Bible, during the &quot;Golden Age of Karaism&quot;. He lived about 95 years, . Born in Basra in the Abbasid Caliphate (now in Iraq), he later moved to Jerusalem between 950 and 980, where he died. The Karaites distinguished him by the epithet &quot;maskil ha-Golah&quot; (teacher of the Exile).

His commentaries were written in Judeo-Arabic, and covered the entire Hebrew Bible. They were accompanied by a very literal translation of the Hebrew text, which often violated the rules of Arabic grammar. These writings influenced the rabbinical sage Abraham ibn Ezra, who quotes Yefet forty-two times in his commentary of the minor prophets.

== Approach ==
Yefet&#x27;s commentary is largely a compilation of others&#x27; views, though he also includes many original interpretations, but in general his Karaite sources are lost. Unlike his Karaite predecessors in the field of Bible exegesis, Yefet realized the importance of grammar and lexicography for the interpretation of Scripture, although he did not excel in either. The interest which his commentaries present lies chiefly in the accumulation of material for the history of the differences between traditional Judaism and the Karaites; for he enters into lengthy disputes with traditional rabbis, especially with Saadia, from whose commentaries on the Bible and polemical works, including some no longer in existence, he gives many extracts. Thus in regard to Ex. xxxv. 3 he discusses with Saadia the kindling of a fire by a non-Jew on Sabbath, a practise which the Karaites considered to be forbidden. Yefet reproaches Saadia with being unfaithful to the principles he himself had laid down for the interpretation of the Law, according to which no deductions by analogy are admissible in definite revealed precepts. On Lev. xxiii. 5 Yefet cites fragments from Saadia&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Tamyiz&quot;, a polemical work against Karaism, in which the author states that there are three sects which are divided on the question of the new moon: (1) the Rabbinites, who, except in special cases, determine it by the molad; (2) the sect of the Tiflis, which follow the molad absolutely; and (3) a sect which is guided by the first appearance of the moon.

== Exegesis ==
Yefet claims full freedom for the exegete, refusing to admit any authority for the interpretation of the Torah; and, although he sometimes uses the thirteen hermeneutic rules laid down in the &quot;Mishnah&quot;, he denies their authority: they are to be applied, he claims, only when it is not possible to explain the passage literally. Thus, notwithstanding his veneration for Anan ben David, the founder of Karaism, and for Benjamin Nahawandi, he often rejects their interpretations. He follows the Targum very closely (he is the first known Karaite commentator to do so), though he never acknowledges it as a source, and he quotes Talmudic teachings frequently, likewise without attribution. In his style and idioms also he bears a deep debt to Talmudic writings, and his interpretations are very often borrowed from the exegetical works of Saadia Gaon or the doctrines of Mutazilism.

Yefet was an adversary of the philosophico-allegorical treatment of scripture. He, however, symbolizes several Biblical narrations, as, for instance, that of the burning bush, in which he finds a representation of Jews, whom enemies can not annihilate; and he admits that the Song of Songs is an allegory.

Yefet attacked Islam with the greatest violence. For him the words of Isaiah, &quot;Ha, you ravager&quot; (Book of Isaiah 33:1), refer to Muhammad, who robbed all nations and dealt treacherously with his own people, and Isaiah 47:9 (&quot;Suddenly, in one day: / Loss of children and widowhood / Shall come upon you in full measure&quot;) to the downfall of Islam. In the following verse, he sees an allusion to the sufferings inflicted by Muslim rulers on the Jews, who are loaded with heavy taxes, compelled to wear badges, forbidden to ride on horseback, etc.

Yefet was no less bitter in his attacks on Christianity and on rabbinic Judaism, to which he refers many prophecies. Unlike his predecessors, he was not an opponent of secular science. To him the word &quot;da&#x27;at&quot; (Proverbs 1:7) denotes &quot;the knowledge&quot; of astronomy, medicine, mathematics, etc., the study of which is to be undertaken before that of theology.

== Influence ==
Yefet&#x27;s commentaries were much used by succeeding Karaite exegetes and were often quoted by Abraham Ibn Ezra. Written in Arabic, some of them were rendered into Hebrew either in full or abridged.

== Editions ==
Nearly the whole Arabic text on all the Biblical books is extant in manuscripts in European libraries (Leiden, Oxford, British Museum, London, Paris, Berlin, etc.). The parts which have been published are:

== Other works ==
He was also known for his expertise of Hebrew grammar, and for his polemics against Rabbinic Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. One of his comments about the Rabbanites, writing on his Arabic commentary on Isaiah, Yefet ben Ali digresses as follows: &quot;This section refers to the people of the Diaspora and to the best among them as well. They are at present divided into four classes :

# The Exilarchs who pretend to be the possessors of knowledge;
# The common people who neither desire wisdom nor think about it; they know no more about religion than to go to the Synagogue from Sabbath to Sabbath and to say &quot;Amen&quot; and &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot;;
# The studious among the common people, whom the Exilarchs teach them the nonsense of the Talmud, and sorcery, instead of what might profit them;
# The &quot;Maskilim&quot; (Karaite teachers) who, endowed with the knowledge of the Torah, are generous with the dissemination of their wisdom, in return for which they accept no recompense).

Before devoting himself to Biblical exegesis Yefet wrote several other works of lesser importance. Among these were:
* an epistle in rimed prose refuting the criticism on Karaism by Jacob ben Samuel, surnamed by the Karaites &quot;ha-&#x27;Iḳḳesh&quot; (= &quot;the intriguer&quot;), published by Pinsker in his &quot;Liḳḳuṭe Ḳadmoniyyot&quot;, p. 19. Yefet endeavors in this epistle to demonstrate that there is no trace of oral tradition in Scripture, and consequently the Mishnah, Talmud, and other rabbinical writings fall under the prohibition &quot;Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you&quot; (Deut. iv. 2).
* &quot;Sefer ha-Miẓwot&quot;, treating of the precepts, and containing many controversies with the Rabbinites; mentioned by Yefet in the commentaries to I Sam. xx. 27; Dan. x. 3. Some fragments of this work were found in the Library of St. Petersburg and published by A. Harkavy.
* &quot;&#x27;Iyyun Tefillah&quot;, in ten chapters, treating of all that pertains to prayer; extant in manuscript (Paris MS. No. 670).
* &quot;Kalam&quot;, perhaps a liturgical work, extant in manuscript. Levi, Yefet&#x27;s son, mentions in his &quot;Muḳaddimah&quot; to Deuteronomy another work by his father, entitled &quot;Safah Berurah&quot;, the contents of which are unknown (the supposition of Fürst that it was a grammatical treatise is considered to be erroneous).

<doc id="1045640" wikidata="Q5179260" url="?curid=1045640" title="Covering problems">
<text>In combinatorics and computer science, covering problems are computational problems that ask whether a certain combinatorial structure &#x27;covers&#x27; another, or how large the structure has to be to do that. Covering problems are minimization problems and usually integer linear programs, whose dual problems are called packing problems.

The most prominent examples of covering problems are the set cover problem, which is equivalent to the hitting set problem, and its special cases, the vertex cover problem and the edge cover problem.

Covering problems allow the covering primitives to overlap; the process of covering something with non-overlapping primitives is called decomposition.
==General linear programming formulation==
In the context of linear programming, one can think of any minimization linear program as a covering problem if the coefficients in the constraint matrix, the objective function, and right-hand side are nonnegative. More precisely, consider the following general integer linear program:

Such an integer linear program is called a covering problem if formula_1 for all formula_2 and formula_3.

Intuition: Assume having formula_4 types of object and each object of type formula_5 has an associated cost of formula_6. The number formula_7 indicates how many objects of type formula_5 we buy. If the constraints formula_9 are satisfied, it is said that &quot;formula_10 is a covering&quot; (the structures that are covered depend on the combinatorial context). Finally, an optimal solution to the above integer linear program is a covering of minimal cost.

==Kinds of covering problems==
There are various kinds of covering problems in graph theory, computational geometry and more; see :Category:Covering problems. Other stochastic related versions of the problem can be found.


=== Covering in Petri nets ===
For Petri nets, the covering problem is defined as the question if for a given marking, there exists a run of the net, such that some larger (or equal) marking can be reached. &quot;Larger&quot; means here that all components are at least as large as the ones of the given marking and at least one is properly larger.

=== Rainbow covering ===
In some covering problems, the covering should satisfy some additional requirements. In particular, in the rainbow covering problem, each of the original objects has a &quot;color&quot;, and it is required that the covering contains exactly one (or at most one) object of each color. Rainbow covering was studied e.g. for covering points by intervals:

* There is a set &quot;J&quot; of &quot;n&quot; colored intervals on the real line, and a set &quot;P&quot; of points on the real line.
* A subset &quot;Q&quot; of &quot;J&quot; is called a &quot;rainbow set&quot; if it contains at most a single interval of each color.
* A set of intervals &quot;J&quot; is called a &quot;covering&quot; of &quot;P&quot; if each point in &quot;P&quot; is contained in at least one interval of &quot;Q&quot;.
* The &quot;Rainbow covering problem&quot; is the problem of finding a rainbow set &quot;Q&quot; that is a covering of &quot;P&quot;.

The problem is NP-hard (by reduction from linear SAT).

=== Conflict-free covering ===
A more general notion is conflict-free covering. In this problem:

* There is a set &quot;O&quot; of &quot;m&quot; objects, and a conflict-graph &quot;GO&quot; on &quot;O&quot;. 
* A subset &quot;Q&quot; of &quot;O&quot; is called &quot;conflict-free&quot; if it is an independent set in &quot;GO&quot;, that is, no two objects in &quot;Q&quot; are connected by an edge in &quot;GO&quot;. 
* A rainbow set is a conflict-free set in the special case in which &quot;GO&quot; is made of disjoint cliques, where each clique represents a color.

&quot;Conflict-free set cover&quot; is the problem of finding a conflict-free subset of &quot;O&quot; that is a covering of &quot;P&quot;. Banik, Panolan, Raman, Sahlot and Saurabh prove the following for the special case in which the conflict-graph has bounded arboricity:

* If the geometric cover problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), then the conflict-free geometric cover problem is FPT.
* If the geometric cover problem admits an r-approximation algorithm, then the conflict-free geometric cover problem admits a similar approximation algorithm in FPT time.

<doc id="1045641" wikidata="Q5473329" url="?curid=1045641" title="Fosca (band)">
<text>Fosca was a British band, combining indie pop songwriting with synthpop instrumentation. Initially, the band was formed by bassist Peter Theobalds and Orlando guitarist/lyricist Dickon Edwards (later guitarist for Spearmint) plus Orlando drummer David Gray, before settling into being a vehicle for Edwards and his songs. Over the next decade, Edwards fronted several (predominantly female) lineups of the band including guitarist Charley Stone (formerly of Gay Dad and later of The Priscillas). They released a total of three studio albums between 2000-2008. The band was named after the protagonist in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Passion&quot; based upon the translation of Lawrence Venuti of the novel &quot;Fosca&quot; by Iginio Ugo Tarchetti, 1869. They received press coverage from The Independent.

== History ==
The original version of Fosca was founded in the summer of 1997 as a hard rock side project by Dickon Edwards, then concurrently the guitarist and lyricist for the Romo band Orlando, together with Orlando&#x27;s live drummer David Gray and a bass player named Peter Theobalds. Edwards recruited laddish lead vocalist Sav in what he would later describe as &quot;an experiment of the Laddish Lion lying down with the Limp-wristed Lamb.&quot;. This line-up performed five concerts between September 1997 and February 1998 - the first two predating Dickon&#x27;s final appearance with Orlando, which he left to concentrate on Fosca. The final concert featured Charley Stone as guest guitarist.

They also recorded four tracks for a putative EP, one of which, &quot;The Leopard Of Lime Street&quot; would, later in 1998, feature on a volume of the sampler album series &quot;Snakebite City&quot; on Bluefire Records. In February 1998, Dickon removed Sav from the band as he felt the singer, &quot;through not being an immediately apparent misfit, with consummate irony didn’t fit in Fosca.&quot; Initially, David Barnett, the future Suede biographer auditioned to replace Sav, however by April 1998 Theobalds and Gray had drifted away to a new band Akercocke, while Stone was otherwise committed to the band Gay Dad.

After several months of inactivity, a new version of Fosca debuted on Friday 25 September 1998 at Queeruption in London. From this point forward, Dickon himself became the frontman for the band. For the first show, the band included seven members, while the next, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1998, featured only three. In early 1999, Fosca made their first attempt at recording debut album &quot;On Earth To Make The Numbers Up&quot; at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. This was eventually aborted after the budget ran out and one track, &quot;Storytelling Johnny&quot; was accidentally wiped by the DAT recording machine. However, one track from these sessions, &quot;File Under Forsaken&quot;, would later be released as the lead track for Fosca&#x27;s debut single &quot;Nervous, London&quot; along with two additional tracks featuring Rachel Stevenson on folk-style lead vocals.

The remaining eight songs for the album were rerecorded in 2000 with a new synth-based sound not dissimilar to that of Orlando, and released, still under the title &quot;On Earth To Make The Numbers Up&quot;, and preceded by the single &quot;The Agony Without the Ecstasy&quot; on Shinkansen Recordings (an offshoot of Sarah Records who in early 1995 had released the &quot;Reproduction Is Pollution&quot; EP by Orlando under the alternative name Shelley). By this time, the band had stabilized into Dickon Edwards on vocals and guitar, Rachel Stevenson on keyboards and vocals, Alex Sharkey also on keyboards and vocals and Sheila B on cello. In 2001 the band released &quot;Supine On The Astroturf&quot; as the first single from their second album. By the time follow-up single &quot;Secret Crush On Third Trombone&quot; and the parent album &quot;Diary Of An Antibody&quot; were recorded and released in 2002, Sharkey had been replaced by Kate Dornan, formerly the editor of Orlando website &quot;Orlando Magic&quot;.

After a gap of some six years due to the collapse of Shinkansen, Fosca signed with the Swedish independent record label But Is It Art?, on which they released a live album in 2007, followed by their third studio album &quot;The Painted Side of the Rocket&quot; in Sweden on 5 March 2008. UK release on 28 April. The label also released a book of Dickon&#x27;s lyrics for Fosca and Orlando, &quot;The Portable Dickon Edwards. Lyrics and Other Alibis 1993-2008&quot;. By then, the current line-up was Dickon Edwards on vocals and guitar, Rachel Stevenson on keyboards and vocals, Kate Dornan on keyboards and vocals, Tom Edwards on guitar and former member Charley Stone returning to perform live on guitar. A further single, &quot;The Man I&#x27;m Not Today&quot; / &quot;My Diogenes Heart&quot; was released later in 2008. Dickon disbanded Fosca in March 2009, with the final concert being at Klubb Republik in Norrköping, Sweden on 14 March.

<text>The Wipp Valley () is an Alpine valley in Tyrol, Austria and in South Tyrol, Italy, running between Innsbruck and Franzensfeste. The Brenner Pass (1,374 m) at the Austro-Italian border divides it into the northern, Austrian Lower Wipp Valley (&quot;Unteres Wipptal&quot;) and the southern, Italian Upper Wipp Valley (&quot;Oberes Wipptal&quot;). The Lower Wipp Valley extends along the Sill River southward from Innsbruck, where the Sill meets the larger Inn River, up to the Brenner Pass. South of the border, the Upper Wipp Valley stretches along the Eisack River by way of Sterzing to Franzensfeste. It forms the Wipptal District of the province of South Tyrol.

The Brenner Autobahn (motorway) (A13 in Austria, A22 in Italy) passes through the valley, beginning with the Europa Bridge near Innsbruck. It is an important road connection across the Alps, forming part of the connection between Munich and Verona. The inhabitants of the Wipp Valley have been complaining for years about the volume of traffic. The Brenner railway also runs through the valley. The proposed Brenner Base Tunnel would remove all long-distance trains from the valley.

Wipptal was politically and culturally united in the County of Tyrol and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bolzano-Brixen up to the Treaty of St Germain in 1920.

<doc id="1045644" wikidata="Q11924025" url="?curid=1045644" title="Pontia gens">
<text>The gens Pontia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens rose to prominence in the time of the Republic, but the Pontii flourished under the Empire, eventually attaining the consulship. Pontius Pilatus, as prefect of Judaea, is known for his role in the execution of Jesus.

==Origin==
The Pontii were of Samnite origin, and are first mentioned in connection with the Samnite Wars, after which some of them removed to Rome. Their nomen, &quot;Pontius&quot;, is a patronymic surname derived from the Oscan praenomen &quot;Pontus&quot; or &quot;Pomptus&quot;, cognate with the Latin praenomen Quintus. Thus, &quot;Pontius&quot; is the Samnite equivalent of the Roman gentes Quinctia and Quinctilia. Alternatively, it may be connected to the Latin word (bridge) and mean &quot;bridge builder&quot;.

==Branches and cognomina==
The only surname borne by the Pontii of the Republic is &quot;Aquila&quot;, an eagle. Various cognomina are found in imperial times.

==Members==
* Pontius Cominius, a young soldier who volunteered to convey a message from the army to the senate, following the Battle of the Allia, when the Capitol was besieged by the Gauls. Floating down the river on some driftwood until he reached the Capitol, he asked that Marcus Furius Camillus, who was then in exile, be nominated dictator.
* Herennius Pontius, an aged resident of Caudium at the time of the Roman surrender in 321 BC, who advised the victorious Samnites either to release the Romans unharmed, or put them to the sword, concluding that imposing terms of peace on a conquered army would only lead the Romans to return seeking revenge.
* Gaius Pontius Herenni f., the Samnite leader who engineered the entrapment of a Roman army at the Caudine Forks in 321 BC. In Roman literary tradition, he imposed peace terms on the defeated army against his father&#x27;s advice, and was later himself captured and beheaded by the Romans in revenge, but this is thought to be ahistorical.
* Pontius, a friend of Scipio Aemilianus.
* Pontius Telesinus, a Samnite leader during the Social War, and an opponent of Sulla during the Roman civil war of 82 BC. He attempted to raise Sulla&#x27;s siege of Praeneste, but was defeated and killed at the Battle of the Colline Gate.
* Pontius Telesinus, younger brother of the Samnite leader, was besieged at Praeneste by Sulla. He attempted to arrange the escape of Marius the Younger, but finding their passage guarded, they fell by their own hands.
* Titus Pontius, a centurion mentioned by Cicero on account of his great strength. He may be the same person as the Pontius mentioned by Lucilius.
* Pontius Titinianus, a son of Quintus Titinius, who was adopted by one of the Pontii. Cicero asserts that he joined Caesar out of fear on the outbreak of the Civil War, which if correct would distinguish him from the soldier later captured by Scipio.
* Pontius, a soldier serving under Caesar, was captured by Metellus Scipio during the Civil War, and urged to go over to the side of Pompeius; but he stated that he would prefer death to betraying Caesar.
* Lucius Pontius, supported Caecilius, uncle of Pomponius Atticus, in a property dispute.
* Pontius Aquila, tribune of the plebs in 45 BC, annoyed Julius Caesar by not standing up during his triumphal procession, and afterwards became one of Caesar&#x27;s assassins. He became a legate of fellow conspirator Decimus Brutus Albinus in Cisalpine Gaul, and was slain at the Battle of Mutina against the forces of Mark Antony.
* Lucius Pontius Aquila, a at Sutrium in an undetermined period. He may be identical with the assassin of Julius Caesar.
* Pontius, a companion of Marcus Antonius, whom Cicero excoriated in his Philippics.
* Pontius, punished with castration by Publius Cerennius, after the latter discovered him in the act of adultery with his wife.
* Pontius Aufidianus, learned that his daughter&#x27;s tutor had allowed a certain Fannius Saturninus to deflower her, he put both the slave and his daughter to death.
* Pontius Lupus, a man of equestrian rank, who lost his eyesight, but continued as an advocate in the law courts.
* Pontius Pilatus, prefect of Judaea from AD 26 to 36, during the reign of Tiberius. He is today best known for the execution of Jesus.
* Pontius Fregellanus, a senator, deprived of his rank for aiding in the adulteries of Albucilla, in AD 36.
* Gaius Petronius Pontius Nigrinus, consul in AD 37, the year in which Tiberius died.
* Pontia Postumia, murdered by Octavius Sagitta, tribune of the plebs in AD 58, having broken off their engagement. Sagitta was banished to an island.
* Pontia, the wife of Petronius, who was put to death as one of the conspirators against Nero. Pontia poisoned her children, and opened her veins.
* Pontius Laelianus, mentioned in the &quot;testamentum Dasumii&quot;, perhaps the father of Marcus Pontius Laelianus, the consul of AD 145.
* Marcus Pontius Laelianus Larcius Sabinus, consul &quot;suffectus&quot; for the months of July and August, AD 145.
* Marcus Pontius (M. f.) Sabinus, consul in AD 153.
* Marcus Pontius M. f. Laelianus, consul in AD 163.
* Marcus Pontius (M. f. M. n.) Varanus Sabinus, perhaps the son of Marcus Pontius Sabinus, consul in AD 153.
* Pontius Proculus Pontianus, consul in AD 238.
* Pontius, a deacon of the early Church at Carthage, was the friend and companion of Cyprian. He authored a work on the life and martyrdom of Cyprian, which was much praised by Jerome, but it is not clear whether the &quot;Vita et Passione Sancti Cypriani&quot; that has survived is the original text.
* Mericius Pontius Anicius Paulinus, bishop of Nola from AD 409 until his death in 431. He authored a number of letters and some poems that are still extant, some lost religious tracts, and apparently the &quot;Passio Sancti Genesii&quot;, or &quot;Passion of Saint Genesius&quot;.

<text>Skankin&#x27; Pickle was an American ska punk band formed in San Jose, California that was active from 1989 to 1997.

==Biography==
Skankin&#x27; Pickle first formed in December 1988, made up of students from Westmont High School and Los Gatos High School. The band, consisting of bassist and vocalist Mike Mattingly, saxophonist and vocalist Mike Park, guitarist and vocalist Lynette Knackstedt, and Drummer Chhuck Phelps, played its first show on April 28, 1989. The group recruited trombonist Lars Nylander several months later, then continued as a five-piece until the addition of second trombonist Gerry Lundquist in early 1990.

In 1991, Park formed Dill Records, based out of San Jose, California, to release Skankin&#x27; Pickle&#x27;s material, beginning with their debut album, the half-live, half-studio &quot;Skafunkrastapunk&quot;. Dill Records would later go on to release early material by Mu330, Slapstick, The Rudiments and Less Than Jake. Throughout their career, Skankin&#x27; Pickle adhered to a strict independent ethic, performing only all-ages shows, $5–$7 cover charges and selling their CDs for no more than $8 (Park would carry this DIY ethos over to his future bands and record labels).

Skankin&#x27; Pickle toured full-time throughout the early 1990s, playing shows with such acts as Bad Manners, The Skatalites, Mustard Plug, Sublime, Let&#x27;s Go Bowling, Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Rancid, The Queers, Primus, Mr. Bungle, Bad Religion and Green Day. The band strove to make their live shows as energetic and entertaining as possible, with the members dancing manically about the stage and engaging in such antics as baton-twirling and onstage wrestling matches. In 1994, &quot;SF Weekly&quot; voted Skankin&#x27; Pickle as one of the best unsigned bands in the Bay Area.

The band released their final studio album, &quot;The Green Album&quot;, on Dr. Strange Records in 1996, a collection of cover songs and newly recorded versions of previously unreleased tracks. Shortly after its release, Mike Park chose to leave the band (news of which he announced in the album&#x27;s liner notes), being replaced by Mike Liu of the Santa Clara ska punk band Janitors Against Apartheid. The group went through more member changes in the following months until only Knackstedt and Nylander remained from the &quot;classic&quot; line-up, though continued to perform as Skankin&#x27; Pickle for their final tour in Europe in June 1997. Following this tour, the title of Skankin&#x27; Pickle was retired as the current line-up (featuring former members of Monkey and The Rudiments) continued touring, re-inventing themselves as the ska punk/pop punk band the 78 RPM&#x27;s.

===Post Skankin&#x27; Pickle===
Knackstedt and Nylander continued playing in the 78 RPM&#x27;s, recording two albums before disbanding in 2003. Following his departure, Mike Park founded his own independent record label Asian Man Records and later went on to form the ska punk bands The Chinkees and The Bruce Lee Band before branching out as a solo acoustic artist. Gerry Lundquist became a member of the St. Louis ska punk ensemble Mu330 in 1996 and Jay Vance formed the robot-themed rock band Captured! by Robots.

Mike Mattingly created former band Neosoreskin and the Deviled Egg Heads Music label. He currently performs solo shows and continues to write, record and release albums under the name Tingly, including the acoustic album Beautiful View.

On December 7, 2007, Lynette Knackstedt died in San Francisco from a drug overdose. On April 19, 2008, a benefit show was staged in her memory at 924 Gilman Street, featuring a number of local bands and headlined by Mike Park. The evening concluded with Park and Lundquist joining Monkey on stage and performing Skankin&#x27; Pickle songs. The benefit concert raised a net profit of nearly $2,000, which was donated to the Ohlhoff Recovery Programs, a Bay Area rehabilitation foundation.

On November 20, 2010, Park, Lundquist and Nylander, backed by the band Monkey, performed at the San Francisco stop of the &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; live tour, playing a cover of the Marcia Griffiths/Bad Manners song &quot;Feel Like Jumping&quot;.

==Musical style==
Skankin&#x27; Pickle was unique for their unconventional melding of various genres: though primarily recognized and categorized as ska punk, the group frequently utilized elements of traditional ska, punk, funk, hardcore punk, rock, metal, reggae, rap, hip-hop, speed metal and polka into their music. Though after the departure of front man Mike Mattingly, Mike Park was generally regarded as the front man, songwriting responsibilities were evenly distributed throughout the band; lead vocals were usually split between Park, Knackstedt, Nylander and Mattingly/Miller, though the remainder of the members had sung lead on at least one recording.

Lyrically, the band also showcased diversity, ranging from silly, comedy-oriented songs (&quot;Fakin&#x27; Jamaican&quot;) to serious and sociopolitical (&quot;Racist World&quot;), promoting racial equality and unity, often touching upon then-current events such as David Duke&#x27;s 1992 presidential campaign (&quot;David Duke is Running For President&quot;) and the racial controversy surrounding Ice Cube&#x27;s album &quot;Death Certificate&quot; (&quot;Ice Cube, Korea Wants A Word With You&quot;). Most of the latter songs were written by Park, who would continue to write about themes of anti-racism in The Chinkees, The B. Lee Band and his solo work.

==References in other bands&#x27; work==
On Alkaline Trio&#x27;s Halloween at the Metro DVD, Matt Skiba references Skankin&#x27; Pickle while playing &quot;Goodbye Forever&quot;:
&quot;Remember last April when we saw Skankin&#x27; Pickle; Somehow the singer showed the Fireside exactly how I feel&quot;

Canadian punkers Fucked Up have a diss track about fellow Canadian rock band Billy Talent in which they reference Skankin&#x27; Pickle twice - a nod to Billy Talent&#x27;s previous ska punk incarnation known as Pezz.

On Sublime&#x27;s rarities box set &quot;Everything Under the Sun&quot;, front-man Bradley Nowell mentions Skankin&#x27; Pickle in an interview with WBCN Boston (Disc 2, Track 12):
WBCN - &quot;...so, welcome to town. Playing TT&#x27;s tonight, in Cambridge...&quot;
Nowell - &quot;With Sprung Monkey.&quot;
WBCN - &quot;With Sprung Monkey?&quot;
Nowell - &quot;I mean Skankin&#x27; Pickle. I&#x27;m sorry, I always confuse the two.&quot;
WBCN - &quot;Heh, heh, heh... It&#x27;s easy to do...&quot;
Nowell - &quot;Skankin&#x27; Pickle is way better than Sprung Monkey...&quot;

<text>Pinus merkusii, the Merkus pine or Sumatran pine, is a pine native to the Malesia region of southeast Asia, and the only one that occurs naturally south of the equator.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus merkusii&quot; is a medium-sized to large tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is orange-red, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, and thin and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in pairs, very slender, long and less than thick, green to yellowish green.

The cones are narrow conic, long and broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy red-brown. They open to 4–5 cm broad at maturity to release the seeds. The seeds are long, with a wing, and are wind-dispersed.

=== Related species ===
&quot;Pinus merkusii&quot; is closely related to the Tenasserim pine (&quot;P. latteri&quot;), which occurs farther north in southeast Asia from Myanmar to Vietnam; some botanists treat the two as conspecific (under the name &quot;P. merkusii&quot;, which was described first), but &quot;P. latteri&quot; differs in longer () and stouter (over 1 mm thick) leaves and larger cones with thicker scales, the cones often remaining closed for some time after maturity. It is also related to the group of Mediterranean pines including Aleppo pine and Turkish pine, which share many features with it.

==Distribution==
It can be found mainly in Indonesia in the mountains of northern Sumatra, and with two outlying populations in central Sumatra on Mount Kerinci and Mount Talang, and in the Philippines on Mindoro and in the Zambales Mountains on western Luzon. Isolated populations of &quot;Pinus merkusii&quot; can be found in Mainland Southeast Asia, such as Kirirom National Park, on the Cardamom Mountains in Cambodia and Bidoup Núi Bà National Park on the Đà Lạt Plateau in Vietnam.

The population in central Sumatra, between 1° 40&#x27; and 2° 06&#x27; S latitude, is the only natural occurrence of any member of the Pinaceae south of the Equator. It generally occurs at moderate altitudes, mostly , but occasionally as low as and up to .

<doc id="1045669" wikidata="Q20682774" url="?curid=1045669" title="Sound-on-film">
<text>Sound-on-film is a class of sound film processes where the sound accompanying a picture is recorded on photographic film, usually, but not always, the same strip of film carrying the picture. Sound-on-film processes can either record an analog sound track or digital sound track, and may record the signal either optically or magnetically. Earlier technologies were sound-on-disc, meaning the film&#x27;s soundtrack would be on a separate phonograph record.

==History==
Sound on film can be dated back to the early 1880s, when Charles E. Fritts filed a patent claiming the idea. In 1923 a patent was filed by E. E. Ries, for a variable density soundtrack recording, which was submitted to the SMPE (now SMPTE), which used the mercury vapor lamp as a modulating device to create a variable-density soundtrack. Later, Case Laboratories and Lee De Forest attempted to commercialize this process, when they developed an Aeolite glow lamp, which was deployed at Movietone Newsreel at the Roxy Theatre in 1927. In 1928, Fox Film purchased Case Laboratories and produced its first talking film &quot;In Old Arizona&quot; using the Aeolite system. The variable-density sound system was popular until the mid-1940s.

Opposite with variable-density, in the early 1920s, variable-area sound recording was first experimented on by the General Electric Company, and later was applied by RCA which refined GE&#x27;s technology. After the mid-1940s, variable-area system superseded the variable-density system, and became the major analog sound-on-film system until modern day.

==Analog sound-on-film recording==
The most prevalent current method of recording analogue sound on a film print is by stereo variable-area (SVA) recording, a technique first used in the mid-1970s as Dolby Stereo. A two-channel audio signal is recorded as a pair of lines running parallel with the film&#x27;s direction of travel through the projector&#x27;s screen. The lines change area (grow broader or narrower) depending on the magnitude of the signal. The projector shines light from a small lamp, called an exciter, through a perpendicular slit onto the film. The image on the small slice of exposed track modulates the intensity of the light, which is collected by a photosensitive element: a photocell, a photodiode or CCD.

In the early years of the 21st century distributors changed to using cyan dye optical soundtracks on color stocks, eliminating the need for a separate and difficult to control black-and-white emulsion on the soundtrack portion of the film. Because traditional incandescent exciter lamps produce copious amounts of infra-red light, and cyan tracks do not absorb infra-red light, this change required theaters to replace the incandescent exciter lamp with a complementary colored red LED or laser. These LED or laser exciters are backwards-compatible with older tracks.

Earlier processes, used on 70 mm film prints and special presentations of 35 mm film prints, recorded sound magnetically on ferric oxide tracks bonded to the film print, outside the sprocket holes. 16 mm and Super 8 formats sometimes used a similar magnetic track on the camera film, bonded to one side of the film on which the sprocket holes had not been punched (&quot;single perforated&quot;) for the purpose. Film of this form is no longer manufactured, but single-perforated film without the magnetic track (allowing an optical sound track) or, in the case of 16 mm, utilising the soundtrack area for a wider picture (Super 16 format) is readily available.

== Digital sound-on-film formats ==
Three different digital soundtrack systems for 35 mm cinema release prints were introduced during the 1990s. They are: Dolby Digital, which is stored between the perforations on the sound side; SDDS, stored in two redundant strips along the outside edges (beyond the perforations); and DTS, in which sound data is stored on separate compact discs synchronized by a timecode track on the film just to the right of the analog soundtrack and left of the frame (sound-on-disc). Because these soundtrack systems appear on different parts of the print, one movie can contain all of them, allowing broad distribution without regard for the sound system installed at individual theatres.

==Sound-on-film formats==
Almost all sound formats used with motion-picture film have been sound-on-film formats, including:

===Optical analog formats===
* Fox/Western Electric (Westrex) Movietone, are variable-density formats of sound film. (No longer used, but still playable on modern 35 mm projectors.)
* Tri-Ergon, another variable-density format prevalent in Germany and Europe until the 1940s. The US patent rights of this Berlin based company were bought by William Fox in 1926, leading to a patent war with the US film industry lasting until 1935. Tri-Ergon amalgamated with a number of other German competitors from 1928 to form the Dutch-controlled Tobis Film syndicate in 1930, licensing the system to UFA GmbH as UFA-Klang.
* RCA Photophone, a variable-area format since the late 1920s—now universally used for optical analog soundtracks. Since the late 1970s usually with a Dolby encoding matrix.

====Encoding matrices====
* Dolby Stereo (SVA)
* Dolby SR
* Ultra Stereo

===Optical digital formats===
* Dolby Digital
* Sony Dynamic Digital Sound

===Obsolete formats===
* Cinema Digital Sound, an optical format which was the first commercial digital sound format, used between 1990 and 1992
* Fantasound. This was a system developed by RCA and Disney Studios with a multi-channel soundtrack recorded on a separate strip of film from the picture. It was used for the initial release of Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940)
* Phonofilm, patented by Lee De Forest in 1919, defunct by 1929

<text>General elections were held in Denmark on 8 September 1987. The Social Democratic Party remained the largest in the Folketing with 54 of the 179 seats. The Conservative People&#x27;s Party-led coalition government lost its majority, but since the parties on the left did not have a majority to form their own government, the incumbent government was able to continue as a minority coalition government. Voter turnout was 87% in Denmark proper, 69% in the Faroe Islands and 45% in Greenland.

<doc id="1045689" wikidata="Q572996" url="?curid=1045689" title="Second Summer of Love">
<text>The Second Summer of Love was a late-1980s social phenomenon in the United Kingdom which saw the rise of acid house music and unlicensed rave parties. Although primarily referring to the summer of 1988, it lasted into the summer of 1989, when electronic dance music and the prevalence of the drug MDMA fuelled an explosion in youth culture culminating in mass free parties and the era of the rave. The music of this era fused dance beats with a psychedelic, 1960s flavour, and the dance culture drew parallels with the hedonism and freedom of the 1967 Summer of Love in San Francisco. The smiley logo is synonymous with this period in the UK.

==History==
The Second Summer of Love began in 1988 in UK, and rose from the house music British nightclubs dating from 1987 to 1988 Shoom (run by Danny Rampling) and Future (organised by Paul Oakenfold), Trip (run by Nicky Holloway), Slam (DJs) and The Haçienda (run by Mike Pickering and Graeme Park). It was particularly associated with the sudden increase in independent gatherings outdoors in fields and in disused warehouses as well as with the new underground club scene, which had often become called raves. Beyond those held around London, events sprung up in areas such as Blackburn and Nottingham, before spreading across all the UK, with very large numbers of distinct gatherings held weekly by late summer of 1988. There were both illegal and legal gatherings in terms of adherence to event planning laws.

While the prime musical point of convergence throughout the phenomenon was house music at first mostly imported from the US underground nightlife centres Chicago, Detroit and New York, another basis for the scene was focused upon enabling people to open up to other genres of music. This was typically music seen as not very commercial for the time, including music of the hippie eras and some folk derived music.

Five DJs associated with the early British house music scene reported they were inspired to start these events after holidaying on Ibiza in the summer of 1987 with their friend Johnny Walker. Ibiza was where acid house music first became popular in Europe and the after-hours nature of the club scene emerged.
In the early stages of the Second Summer of Love, the events and parties were often held in empty warehouses across the UK and were essentially illegal. Vague flyers around towns and cities advertised events and information travelled by word of mouth (as well as the newly popular mobile pager) between clubbers who were obliged to party incognito. Increasingly huge parties started to be put on around the M25 orbital of London by promoters including “Biology” (Jarvis Sandy, Micky Jump &amp; Tarquin de Meza), “Energy” (Jeremy Taylor &amp; Tin Tin Chambers), “Genesis (Andrew Pritchard, Wayne Anthony &amp; Keith Brooks), “Sunrise/Back to the Future” (Tony Colston Hayter &amp; Dave Roberts) and “Weekend World” (Tarquin de Meza). In London, events were put on by Raindance, and at Labrynth/Four Aces.

The symbol of the time became a smiley face after the London crowd picked up the design when it was posted on one of the flyers from the third Shoom party. Revellers would soon become adorned in smiley t-shirts and badges.

Water and Lucozade were a common feature because of the dehydrating effects of marathon dancing due to MDMA use. Clubgoers wore baggy clothing to combat the heat inside the clubs, and staff handed out ice pops.

===Music===
Acid house and hip house was typical of the Second Summer of Love. Acid house was characterised by the &quot;squelching&quot; bass produced by the Roland TB-303 and loud repetitive beats. It originated in Chicago and took on new qualities when it came to Europe. Songs from the period include &quot;French Kiss&quot; by Lil Louis, &quot;On &amp; On&quot; by Jesse Saunders, &quot;Mystery of Love&quot; by Fingers Inc., &quot;Love Can&#x27;t Turn Around&quot; by Farley &quot;Jackmaster&quot; Funk and Saunders (featuring Darryl Pandy), &quot;I&#x27;ve Lost Control&quot; by Sleezy D, and &quot;Your Only Friend&quot; by Phuture. Hip house would become a popular cross-over of a rap and house music, with tracks such as &quot;Turn Up The Bass&quot; by Tyree Cooper, &quot;Who&#x27;s In the House&quot; by the Beatmasters, &quot;Let It Roll&quot; by Doug Lazy, and &quot;That&#x27;s How I&#x27;m Living&quot; by Tony Scott.

===Radio===
The raves and music were promoted by pirate radio stations, including Kiss FM, Sunrise and Centreforce.

===Drug use===
Ecstasy was the drug of choice during the time. LSD was still present, just not as prominently. Mark Moore, of group S&#x27;Express, said: &quot;It definitely took ecstasy to change things. People would take their first ecstasy and it was almost as if they were born again.&quot; Violence was uncommon due to the feelings of euphoria, love and empathy caused by ecstasy. Ecstasy use in raves is often linked to the reduction in football hooliganism at the time. The drug also increased the enjoyment of the music and encouraged dancing. Nicky Holloway, a DJ from the time, said: &quot;The ecstasy and music came together. It was all part of the package. ... That may sound a little sad, but there&#x27;s no way acid house would have taken off the way it did without ecstasy.&quot;

===Media attention===
British news media and tabloids devoted an increasing amount of coverage to the hedonistic scene, focusing increasingly on its association with club drugs. Early positive reports such as running articles on the &quot;acid house&quot; fashion would soon become sensationalist negative coverage. The moral panic of the press began in late 1988, when &quot;The Sun&quot;, which only days earlier on 12 October had promoted acid house as &quot;cool and groovy&quot; while running an offer on acid smiley face t-shirts, abruptly turned on the scene. On 19 October &quot;The Sun&quot; ran with the headline &quot;Evils of Ecstasy,&quot; linking the acid house scene with the newly popular and relatively unknown drug. On 24 June 1989, the newspaper ran its infamous &quot;Spaced Out!&quot; headline after a Sunrise party.

<doc id="1045705" wikidata="Q383260" url="?curid=1045705" title="Influenza vaccine">
<text>Influenza vaccines, colloquially known as flu shots or the flu jab, are vaccines that protect against infection by influenza viruses. New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. Vaccination against influenza began in the 1930s, with large-scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945.
Both the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend yearly vaccination for nearly all people over the age of six months, especially those at high risk, and the influenza vaccine is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high-risk groups, particularly pregnant women, the elderly, children between six months and five years, and those with certain health problems.
The vaccines are generally safe, including for people who have severe egg allergies. A common side effect is soreness near the site of injection. Fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in &quot;inactive&quot; and &quot;weakened&quot; viral forms. The live, weakened vaccine is generally not recommended in pregnant women, children less than two years old, adults older than 50, or people with a weakened immune system. Depending on the type it can be injected into a muscle (intramuscular), sprayed into the nose (intranasal), or injected into the middle layer of the skin (intradermal). The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons.

Vaccines are used in both humans and non-humans. The human vaccine is meant unless specifically identified as a veterinary, poultry, or livestock vaccine.

===Origins and development===
During the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, &quot;Pharmacists tried everything they knew, everything they had ever heard of, from the ancient art of bleeding patients, to administering oxygen, to developing new vaccines and serums (chiefly against what we call &quot;Hemophilus influenzae&quot;a name derived from the fact that it was originally considered the etiological agentand several types of pneumococci). Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.&quot;

In 1931, viral growth in embryonated hens&#x27; eggs was reported by Ernest William Goodpasture and colleagues at Vanderbilt University. The work was extended to the growth of influenza virus by several workers, including Thomas Francis, Jonas Salk, Wilson Smith, and Macfarlane Burnet, leading to the first experimental influenza vaccines. In the 1940s, the US military developed the first approved inactivated vaccines for influenza, which were used during World War II. Hens&#x27; eggs continued to be used to produce virus used in influenza vaccines, but manufacturers made improvements in the purity of the virus by developing improved processes to remove egg proteins and to reduce systemic reactivity of the vaccine. In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved influenza vaccines made by growing virus in cell cultures, and influenza vaccines made from recombinant proteins were approved in 2013.

===Acceptance===
The egg-based technology for producing influenza vaccine was created in the 1950s. In the US swine flu scare of 1976, President Gerald Ford was confronted with a potential swine flu pandemic. The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. Meanwhile, maximum military containment efforts succeeded unexpectedly in confining the new strain to the single army base where it had originated. On that base, several soldiers fell severely ill, but only one died. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of 25 over normal annual levels as well as 400 excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, demonstrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976. The 2009 H1N1 &quot;swine flu&quot; outbreak resulted in the rapid approval of pandemic influenza vaccines. Pandemrix was quickly modified to target the circulating strain and by late 2010, 70 million people had received a dose. Eight years later, the BMJ gained access to early vaccine pharmacovigilance reports compiled by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) during the pandemic, which the BMJ reported indicated death was 5.39 fold more likely with Pandemrix &quot;vs&quot; the other pandemic vaccines. However, more thorough and robust later analyses did not establish any increase of fatalities or most other serious adverse effects, with a possible rare exception for narcolepsy.

===Quadrivalent vaccines ===
A quadrivalent flu vaccine administered by nasal mist was approved by the FDA in March 2012. Fluarix Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in December 2012.

In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of quadrivalent influenza vaccines.

Starting with the 2018–2019 influenza season most of the regular-dose egg-based flu shots and all the recombinant and cell-grown flu vaccines in the United States are quadrivalent. In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent.

In November 2019, the FDA approved Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent for use in the United States starting with the 2020–2021 influenza season.

In February 2020, the FDA approved Fluad Quadrivalent for use in the United States. In July 2020, the FDA approved both Fluad and Fluad Quadrivalent for use in the United States for the 2020–2021 influenza season.

The B/Yamagata lineage of influenza B, one of the four lineages targeted by quadrivalent vaccines, might have become extinct in 2020/2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic measures, and there have been no naturally occurring cases confirmed since March 2020. In 2023, the World Health Organization concluded that protection against the Yamagata lineage was no longer necessary in the seasonal flu vaccine, so future vaccines are recommended to be trivalent instead of quadrivalent. For the 2024–2025 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, the FDA recommends removing B/Yamagata from all influenza vaccines.

==Medical uses==
The influenza vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease caused by influenza virus subtypes A and type B contained in the vaccine.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The flu vaccine can also reduce the severity of the flu if a person contracts a strain that the vaccine did not contain. It takes about two weeks following vaccination for protective antibodies to form.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that flu vaccination was effective 67percent of the time; the populations that benefited the most were HIV-positive adults aged 18 to 55 (76percent), healthy adults aged 18 to 46 (approximately 70percent), and healthy children aged six months to 24 months (66percent). The influenza vaccine also appears to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15–45%.

===Effectiveness===
A vaccine is assessed by its &quot;efficacy&quot; – the extent to which it reduces the risk of disease under controlled conditions – and its &quot;effectiveness&quot; – the observed reduction in risk after the vaccine is put into use. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. Studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. However, in most years (16 of the 19 years before 2007), the flu vaccine strains have been a good match for the circulating strains, and even a mismatched vaccine can often provide cross-protection. The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise.

The effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccines varies significantly, with an estimated average efficacy of 50–60% against symptomatic disease, depending on vaccine strain, age, prior immunity, and immune function, so vaccinated people can still contract influenza. The effectiveness of flu vaccines is considered to be suboptimal, particularly among the elderly, but vaccination is still beneficial in reducing the mortality rate and hospitalization rate due to influenza as well as duration of hospitalization. Vaccination of school-age children has shown to provide indirect protection for other age groups. LAIVs are recommended for children based on superior efficacy, especially for children under 6, and greater immunity against non-vaccine strains when compared to inactivated vaccines.

From 2012 to 2015 in New Zealand, vaccine effectiveness against admission to an intensive care unit was 82%. Effectiveness against hospitalized influenza illness in the 2019–2020 United States flu season was 41% overall and 54% in people aged 65 years or older. One review found 31% effectiveness against death among adults.

Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offers consistent year-on-year protection against influenza. There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. , the CDC recommends a yearly vaccine as most studies demonstrate overall effectiveness of annual influenza vaccination.

There is not enough evidence to establish significant differences in the effectiveness of different influenza vaccine types, but there are high-dose or adjuvanted products that induce a stronger immune response in the elderly.

According to a 2016 study by faculty at the University of New South Wales, getting a flu shot was as effective or better at preventing a heart attack than even quitting smoking.

A 2024 CDC study found that the 2024 flu vaccine reduced the risk of hospitalization from the flu by 35% in the Southern Hemisphere. The research, conducted across five countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay—showed the vaccine was less effective than the one used in the previous season.

===Children===
In April 2002, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) encouraged that children 6 to 23 months of age be vaccinated annually against influenza. In 2010, ACIP recommended annual influenza vaccination for those 6 months of age and older. The CDC recommends that everyone except infants under the age of six months should receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccination campaigns usually focus special attention on people who are at high risk of serious complications if they catch the flu, such as pregnant women, children under 59 months, the elderly, and people with chronic illnesses or weakened immune systems, as well as those to whom they are exposed, such as health care workers.

As the death rate is also high among infants who catch influenza, the CDC and the WHO recommend that household contacts and caregivers of infants be vaccinated to reduce the risk of passing an influenza infection to the infant.

In children, the vaccine appears to decrease the risk of influenza and possibly influenza-like illness. In children under the age of two data are limited. During the 2017–18 flu season, the CDC director indicated that 85 percent of the children who died &quot;likely will not have been vaccinated&quot;.

In the United States, , the CDC recommend that children aged six through 35 months may receive either 0.25milliliters or 0.5milliliters per dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent. There is no preference for one or the other dose volume of Fluzone Quadrivalent for that age group. All persons 36 months of age and older should receive 0.5 milliliters per dose of Fluzone Quadrivalent. , Afluria Quadrivalent is licensed for children six months of age and older in the United States. Children six months through 35 months of age should receive 0.25milliliters for each dose of Afluria Quadrivalent. All persons 36 months of age and older should receive 0.5milliliters per dose of Afluria Quadrivalent. , Afluria Tetra is licensed for adults and children five years of age and older in Canada.

In 2014, the Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) published a review of influenza vaccination in healthy 5–18-year-olds, and in 2015, published a review of the use of pediatric Fluad in children 6–72 months of age. In one study, conducted in a tertiary referral center, the rate of influenza vaccination in children was only 31%. Higher rates were found among immuno-suppressed pediatric patients (46%) and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (50%).

===Adults===
In unvaccinated adults, 16% get symptoms similar to the flu, while about 10% of vaccinated adults do. Vaccination decreased confirmed cases of influenza from about 2.4% to 1.1%. No effect on hospitalization was found.

In working adults, a review by the Cochrane Collaboration found that vaccination resulted in a modest decrease in both influenza symptoms and working days lost, without affecting transmission or influenza-related complications. In healthy working adults, influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, though such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons.

In health care workers, a 2006 review found a net benefit. Of the eighteen studies in this review, only two also assessed the relationship of patient mortality relative to staff influenza vaccine uptake; both found that higher rates of healthcare worker vaccination correlated with reduced patient deaths. A 2014 review found benefits to patients when health care workers were immunized, as supported by moderate evidence based in part on the observed reduction in all-cause deaths in patients whose health care workers were given immunization compared with comparison patients where the workers were not offered the vaccine.

===Elderly===
Evidence for an effect in adults over 65 is unclear. Systematic reviews examining both randomized controlled and case–control studies found a lack of high-quality evidence. Reviews of case-control studies found effects against laboratory-confirmed influenza, pneumonia, and death among the community-dwelling elderly.

The group most vulnerable to non-pandemic flu, the elderly, benefits least from the vaccine. There are multiple reasons behind this steep decline in vaccine efficacy, the most common of which are the declining immunological function and frailty associated with advanced age. In a non-pandemic year, a person in the United States aged 50–64 is nearly ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than a younger person, and a person over 65 is more than ten times more likely to die an influenza-associated death than the 50–64 age group.

There is a high-dose flu vaccine specifically formulated to provide a stronger immune response. Available evidence indicates that vaccinating the elderly with the high-dose vaccine leads to a stronger immune response against influenza than the regular-dose vaccine.

A flu vaccine containing an adjuvant was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2015, for use by adults aged 65 years of age and older. The vaccine is marketed as Fluad in the US and was first available in the 2016–2017 flu season. The vaccine contains the MF59C.1 adjuvant which is an oil-in-water emulsion of squalene oil. It is the first adjuvanted seasonal flu vaccine marketed in the United States. It is not clear if there is a significant benefit for the elderly to use a flu vaccine containing the MF59C.1 adjuvant. Per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines, Fluad can be used as an alternative to other influenza vaccines approved for people 65 years and older.

Vaccinating healthcare workers who work with elderly people is recommended in many countries, with the goal of reducing influenza outbreaks in this vulnerable population. While there is no conclusive evidence from randomized clinical trials that vaccinating health care workers helps protect elderly people from influenza, there is tentative evidence of benefit.

Fluad Quad was approved for use in Australia in September 2019, Fluad Quadrivalent was approved for use in the United States in February 2020, and Fluad Tetra was authorized for use in the European Union in May 2020.

===Pregnancy===
As well as protecting mother and child from the effects of an influenza infection, the immunization of pregnant women tends to increase their chances of experiencing a successful full-term pregnancy.

The trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine is protective in pregnant women infected with HIV.

==Safety==
===Side effects===
Common side effects of vaccination include local injection-site reactions and cold-like symptoms. Fever, malaise, and myalgia are less common. Flu vaccines are contraindicated for people who have experienced a severe allergic reaction in response to a flu vaccine or to any component of the vaccine. LAIVs are not given to children or adolescents with severe immunodeficiency or to those who are using salicylate treatments because of the risk of developing Reye syndrome. LAIVs are also not recommended for children under the age of 2, pregnant women, and adults with immunosuppression. Inactivated flu vaccines cannot cause influenza and are regarded as safe during pregnancy.

While side effects of the flu vaccine may occur, they are usually minor, including soreness, redness, swelling around the point of injection, headache, fever, nausea, or fatigue. Side effects of a nasal spray vaccine may include runny nose, wheezing, sore throat, cough, or vomiting.

In some people, a flu vaccine may cause serious side effects, including an allergic reaction, but this is rare. Furthermore, the common side effects and risks are mild and temporary when compared to the risks and severe health effects of the annual influenza epidemic.

Contrary to a common misconception, flu shots cannot cause people to get the flu.

===Guillain–Barré syndrome===
Although Guillain–Barré syndrome had been feared as a complication of vaccination, the CDC states that most studies on modern influenza vaccines have seen no link with Guillain–Barré. Infection with influenza virus itself increases both the risk of death (up to one in ten thousand) and the risk of developing Guillain–Barré syndrome to a far higher level than the highest level of suspected vaccine involvement (approximately ten times higher by 2009 estimates).

Although one review gives an incidence of about one case of Guillain–Barré per million vaccinations, a large study in China, covering close to a hundred million doses of vaccine against the 2009 H1N1 &quot;swine&quot; flu found only eleven cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome, (0.1 per million doses) total incidence in persons vaccinated, actually lower than the normal rate of the disease in China, and no other notable side effects.

===Egg allergy===
Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg-based techniques, influenza vaccines are nonetheless still recommended as safe for people with egg allergies, even if severe, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with egg allergies. Studies examining the safety of influenza vaccines in people with severe egg allergies found that anaphylaxis was very rare, occurring in 1.3 cases per million doses given.

Monitoring for symptoms from vaccination is recommended in those with more severe symptoms. A study of nearly 800 children with egg allergy, including over 250 with previous anaphylactic reactions, had zero systemic allergic reactions when given the live attenuated flu vaccine.

Vaccines produced using other technologies, notably recombinant vaccines and those based on cell culture rather than egg protein, started to become available in 2012 in the US, and later in Europe and Australia.

===Other===
Several studies have identified an increased incidence of narcolepsy among recipients of the pandemic H1N1 influenza AS03-adjuvanted vaccine; efforts to identify a mechanism for this suggest that narcolepsy is autoimmune, and that the AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine may mimic hypocretin, serving as a trigger.

Some injection-based flu vaccines intended for adults in the United States contain thiomersal (also known as thimerosal), a mercury-based preservative. Despite some controversy in the media, the World Health Organization&#x27;s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has concluded that there is no evidence of toxicity from thiomersal in vaccines and no reason on grounds of safety to change to more-expensive single-dose administration.

Exercising before the influenza vaccine is not thought to be harmful but there is no evidence of a beneficial effect either.

==Types==


Seasonal flu vaccines are available either as:
* a trivalent or quadrivalent injection, which contains the inactivated form of the virus. This is usually an intramuscular injection, though subcutaneous and intradermal routes can also be protective.
* a nasal spray of live attenuated influenza vaccine, which contains the live but attenuated (weakened) form of the virus.

Injected vaccines induce protection based on an immune response to the antigens present on the inactivated virus, while the nasal spray works by establishing short-term infection in the nasal passages.

==Annual reformulation==

Each year, three influenza strains are chosen for inclusion in the forthcoming year&#x27;s seasonal flu vaccination by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System of the World Health Organization (WHO). The recommendation for trivalent vaccine comprises two strains of Influenza A (one each of A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and one strain of influenza B (B/Victoria), together representing strains thought most likely to cause significant human suffering in the coming season. Starting in 2012, WHO has also recommended a second influenza B strain (B/Yamagata) for use in quadrivalent vaccines; this was discontinued in 2024.

:&quot;The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network was established in 1952 (renamed &quot;Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System&quot; in 2011). The network comprises four WHO Collaborating Centres (WHO CCs) and 112 institutions in 83 countries, which are recognized by WHO as WHO National Influenza Centres (NICs). These NICs collect specimens in their country and perform primary virus isolation and preliminary antigenic characterization. They ship newly isolated strains to WHO CCs for high-level antigenic and genetic analysis, the result of which forms the basis for WHO recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccine for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere each year.&quot;

Formal WHO recommendations were first issued in 1973. Beginning in 1999 there have been two recommendations per year: one for the northern hemisphere and the other for the southern hemisphere.

Due to the widespread use of non-pharmaceutical interventions at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the B/Yamagata influenza lineage has not been isolated since March 2020 and may have been eradicated. Starting with the 2024 Southern Hemisphere influenza season, the WHO and other regulatory bodies have removed B/Yamagata from influenza vaccine recommendations.

==Recommendations==
Various public health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), recommend that yearly influenza vaccination be routinely offered, particularly to people at risk of complications of influenza and those individuals who live with or care for high-risk individuals, including:
* people aged 50 years of age or older
* people with chronic lung diseases, including asthma
* people with chronic heart diseases
* people with chronic liver diseases
* people with chronic kidney diseases
* people who have had their spleen removed or whose spleen is not working properly
* people who are immunocompromised
* residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities
* health care workers (both to prevent sickness and to prevent spread to their patients)
* children and adolescents (aged 6 months through 18 years) who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection
* American Indians/Alaska Natives
* people who are extremely obese (body mass index ≥40 for adults)

The flu vaccine is contraindicated for those under six months of age and those with severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine.

===World Health Organization===
, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends seasonal influenza vaccination for:

&quot;First priority:&quot;
* Pregnant women

&quot;Second priority (in no particular order):&quot;
* Children aged 6–59 months
* Elderly
* Individuals with specific chronic medical conditions
* Health-care workers

===Canada===
The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), the group that advises the Public Health Agency of Canada, recommends that everyone over six months of age be encouraged to receive annual influenza vaccination and that children between the age of six months and 24 months, and their household contacts, should be considered a high priority for the flu vaccine.
Particularly:
* People at high risk of influenza-related complications or hospitalization, including people who are morbidly obese, healthy pregnant women, children aged 6–59 months, the elderly, aboriginals, and people with one of an itemized list of chronic health conditions
* People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk, including household contacts and healthcare workers
* People who provide essential community services
* Certain poultry workers

Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was not available in Canada for the 2019–2020 season.

===European Union===
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommends vaccinating the elderly as a priority, with a secondary priority for people with chronic medical conditions and health care workers.

The influenza vaccination strategy is generally that of protecting vulnerable people, rather than limiting influenza circulation or eliminating human influenza sickness. This is in contrast with the high herd immunity strategies for other infectious diseases such as polio and measles. This is also due in part to the financial and logistics burden associated with the need of an annual injection.

===United Kingdom===
The National Health Service in the United Kingdom provides flu vaccination to:
* people who are aged 65 or over
* people who have certain long-term health conditions
* people who are pregnant
* people who live in a care home
* people who are the main carer for an older or disabled person, or receive a carer&#x27;s allowance
* people who live with someone who has a weakened immune system.

This vaccination is available free of charge to people in these groups. People outside these groups aged between 18 and 65 years of age can also receive private flu vaccination for a small fee from pharmacies and some private surgeries.

===United States===
In the United States routine influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged six months and over. It takes up to two weeks after vaccination for sufficient antibodies to develop in the body. The CDC recommends vaccination before the end of October, although it considers getting a vaccine in December or even later to be still beneficial. The U.S. military also requires a flu shot annually for its active and reserve servicemembers.

According to the CDC, the live attenuated virus (LAIV4) (which comes in the form of nasal spray in the US) should be avoided by some groups.

Within its blanket recommendation for general vaccination in the United States, the CDC, which began recommending the influenza vaccine to healthcare workers in 1981, emphasizes to clinicians the special urgency of vaccination for members of certain vulnerable groups, and their caregivers:
: Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of serious influenza complications or people who live with or care for people at higher risk for serious complications. In 2009, a new high-dose formulation of the standard influenza vaccine was approved. The Fluzone High Dose is specifically for people 65 and older; the difference is that it has four times the antigen dose of the standard Fluzone.

The US government requires hospitals to report worker vaccination rates. Some US states and hundreds of US hospitals require healthcare workers to either get vaccinations or wear masks during flu season. These requirements occasionally engender union lawsuits on narrow collective bargaining grounds, but proponents note that courts have generally endorsed forced vaccination laws affecting the general population during disease outbreaks.

Vaccination against influenza is especially considered important for members of high-risk groups who would be likely to have complications from influenza, for example pregnant women and children and teenagers from six months to 18 years of age who are receiving aspirin- or salicylate-containing medications and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection;
* In raising the upper age limit to 18 years, the aim is to reduce both the time children and parents lose from visits to pediatricians and missing school and the need for antibiotics for complications
* An added benefit expected from the vaccination of children is a reduction in the number of influenza cases among parents and other household members, and of possible spread to the general community.

The CDC indicated that live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also called the nasal spray vaccine, was not recommended for the 2016–2017 flu season in the United States.

Furthermore, the CDC recommends that healthcare personnel who care for severely immunocompromised persons receive injections (TIV or QIV) rather than LAIV.

===Australia===
The Australian Government recommends seasonal flu vaccination for everyone over the age of six months. Australia uses inactivated vaccines. Until 2021, the egg-based vaccine has been the only one available (and continues to be the only free one), but from March 2021 a new cell-based vaccine is available for those who wish to pay for it, and it is expected that this one will become the standard by 2026.
The standard flu vaccine is free for the following people:
* children aged six months to five years;
* people aged 65 years and over;
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged six months and over;
* pregnant women; and
* anyone over six months of age with medical conditions such as severe asthma, lung disease or heart disease, low immunity, or diabetes that can lead to complications from influenza.

==Uptake==
===At risk groups===
Uptake of flu vaccination, both seasonally and during pandemics, is often low. Systematic reviews of pandemic flu vaccination uptake have identified several personal factors that may influence uptake, including gender (higher uptake in men), ethnicity (higher in people from ethnic minorities), and having a chronic illness. Beliefs in the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine are also important.

Several measures are useful to increase rates of vaccination in those over sixty including patient reminders using leaflets and letters, postcard reminders, client outreach programs, vaccine home visits, group vaccinations, free vaccinations, physician payment, physician reminders, and encouraging physician competition.

===Health care workers===
Frontline healthcare workers are often recommended to get seasonal and any pandemic flu vaccinations. For example, in the UK all healthcare workers involved in patient care are recommended to receive the seasonal flu vaccine, and were also recommended to be vaccinated against the H1N1/09 (later renamed A(H1N1)pdm09) swine flu virus during the 2009 pandemic. However, uptake is often low. During the 2009 pandemic, low uptake by healthcare workers was seen in countries including the UK, Italy, Greece, and Hong Kong.

In a 2010 survey of United States healthcare workers, 63.5% reported that they received the flu vaccine during the 2010–11 season, an increase from 61.9% reported the previous season. US Health professionals with direct patient contact had higher vaccination uptake, such as physicians and dentists (84.2%) and nurse practitioners (82.6%).

The main reason to vaccinate health care workers is to prevent staff from spreading flu to their patients and to reduce staff absence at a time of high service demand, but the reasons health care workers state for their decisions to accept or decline vaccination may more often be to do with perceived personal benefits.

In Victoria (Australia) public hospitals, rates of healthcare worker vaccination in 2005 ranged from 34% for non-clinical staff to 42% for laboratory staff. One of the reasons for rejecting vaccines was concern over adverse reactions; in one study, 31% of resident physicians at a teaching hospital incorrectly believed Australian vaccines could cause influenza.

==Manufacturing==
Research continues into the idea of a &quot;universal&quot; influenza vaccine that would not require tailoring to a particular strain, but would be effective against a broad variety of influenza viruses. No vaccine candidates had been announced by November 2007, but , there are several universal vaccines candidates, in pre-clinical development and in clinical trials.

In a 2007 report, the global capacity of approximately 826 million seasonal influenza vaccine doses (inactivated and live) was double the production of 413 million doses. In an aggressive scenario of producing pandemic influenza vaccines by 2013, only 2.8 billion courses could be produced in a six-month time frame. If all high- and upper-middle-income countries sought vaccines for their entire populations in a pandemic, nearly two billion courses would be required. If China pursued this goal as well, more than three billion courses would be required to serve these populations. Vaccine research and development is ongoing to identify novel vaccine approaches that could produce much greater quantities of vaccine at a price that is affordable to the global population.

===Egg-based===
Most flu vaccines are grown by vaccine manufacturers in fertilized chicken eggs. In the Northern hemisphere, the manufacturing process begins following the announcement (typically in February) of the WHO recommended strains for the winter flu season. Three strains (representing an H1N1, an H3N2, and a B strain) of flu are selected and chicken eggs are inoculated separately. These monovalent harvests are then combined to make the trivalent vaccine.

, both the conventional injection and the nasal spray are manufactured using chicken eggs. The European Union also approved Optaflu, a vaccine produced by Novartis using vats of animal cells. This technique is expected to be more scalable and avoid problems with eggs, such as allergic reactions and incompatibility with strains that affect avians like chickens.

Influenza vaccines are produced in pathogen-free eggs that are eleven or twelve days old. The top of the egg is disinfected by wiping it with alcohol and then the egg is candled to identify a non-veinous area in the allantoic cavity where a small hole is poked to serve as a pressure release. A second hole is made at the top of the egg, where the influenza virus is injected in the allantoic cavity, past the chorioallantoic membrane. The two holes are then sealed with melted paraffin and the inoculated eggs are incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees Celsius. During the incubation time, the virus replicates and newly replicated viruses are released into the allantoic fluid

After the 48-hour incubation period, the top of the egg is cracked and ten milliliters of allantoic fluid is removed, from which about fifteen micrograms of the flu vaccine can be obtained. At this point, the viruses have been weakened or killed and the viral antigen is purified and placed inside vials, syringes, or nasal sprayers. Up to 3 eggs are needed to produce one dose of a trivalent vaccine, and an estimated 600 million eggs are produced each year for flu vaccine production.

===Other methods of manufacture===

Methods of vaccine generation that bypass the need for eggs include the construction of influenza virus-like particles (VLP). VLP resemble viruses, but there is no need for inactivation, as they do not include viral coding elements, but merely present antigens in a similar manner to a virion. Some methods of producing VLP include cultures of &quot;Spodoptera frugiperda&quot; Sf9 insect cells and plant-based vaccine production (e.g., production in &quot;Nicotiana benthamiana&quot;). There is evidence that some VLPs elicit antibodies that recognize a broader panel of antigenically distinct viral isolates compared to other vaccines in the hemagglutination-inhibition assay (HIA).

A gene-based DNA vaccine, used to prime the immune system after boosting with an inactivated H5N1 vaccine, underwent clinical trials in 2011.

In November 2012, Novartis received FDA approval for the first cell-culture vaccine. In 2013, the recombinant influenza vaccine, Flublok, was approved for use in the United States.

On September 17, 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorization for Supemtek, a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (recombinant, prepared in cell culture). The applicant for this medicinal product is Sanofi Pasteur. Supemtek was authorized for medical use in the European Union in November 2020.

Australia authorized its first cell-based vaccine in March 2021, based on an &quot;eternal cell line&quot; of a dog kidney. Because of the way it is produced, it produces better-matched vaccines (to the flu strains).

=== Vaccine manufacturing countries ===
According to the WHO, , countries where influenza vaccine is produced include:

In addition, Kazakhstan, Serbia, and Thailand had facilities in the final stages of establishing production.

==Cost-effectiveness==
The cost-effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination has been widely evaluated for different groups and in different settings. In the elderly (over 65), the majority of published studies have found that vaccination is cost-saving, with the cost savings associated with influenza vaccination (e.g. prevented health care visits) outweighing the cost of vaccination. In older adults (aged 50–64 years), several published studies have found that influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective, however, the results of these studies were often found to be dependent on key assumptions used in the economic evaluations. The uncertainty in influenza cost-effectiveness models can partially be explained by the complexities involved in estimating the disease burden, as well as the seasonal variability in the circulating strains and the match of the vaccine. In healthy working adults (aged 18–49 years), a 2012 review found that vaccination was generally not cost-saving, with the suitability for funding being dependent on the willingness to pay to obtain the associated health benefits. In children, the majority of studies have found that influenza vaccination was cost-effective, however many of the studies included (indirect) productivity gains, which may not be given the same weight in all settings. Several studies have attempted to predict the cost-effectiveness of interventions (including pre-pandemic vaccination) to help protect against a future pandemic, however estimating the cost-effectiveness has been complicated by uncertainty as to the severity of a potential future pandemic and the efficacy of measures against it.

==Research==
Influenza research includes molecular virology, molecular evolution, pathogenesis, host immune responses, genomics, and epidemiology. These help in developing influenza countermeasures such as vaccines, therapies, and diagnostic tools. Improved influenza countermeasures require basic research on how viruses enter cells, replicate, mutate, evolve into new strains, and induce an immune response. The Influenza Genome Sequencing Project is creating a library of influenza sequences that will help researchers&#x27; understanding of what makes one strain more lethal than another, what genetic determinants most affect immunogenicity, and how the virus evolves.

A different approach uses Internet content to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign. More specifically, researchers have used data from Twitter and Microsoft&#x27;s Bing search engine and proposed a statistical framework that, after a series of operations, maps this information to estimates of the influenza-like illness reduction percentage in areas where vaccinations have been performed. The method has been used to quantify the impact of two flu vaccination programmes in England (2013/14 and 2014/15), where school-age children were administered a live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Notably, the impact estimates were in accordance with estimations from Public Health England based on traditional syndromic surveillance endpoints.

===Rapid response to pandemic flu===
The rapid development, production, and distribution of pandemic influenza vaccines could potentially save millions of lives during an influenza pandemic. Due to the short time frame between the identification of a pandemic strain and the need for vaccination, researchers are looking at novel technologies for vaccine production that could provide better &quot;real-time&quot; access and be produced more affordably, thereby increasing access for people living in low- and moderate-income countries, where an influenza pandemic may likely originate, such as live attenuated (egg-based or cell-based) technology and recombinant technologies (proteins and virus-like particles). , more than seventy known clinical trials have been completed or are ongoing for pandemic influenza vaccines. In September 2009, the FDA approved four vaccines against the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus (the 2009 pandemic strain), and expected the initial vaccine lots to be available within the following month.

In January 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Audenz as a vaccine for the H5N1 flu virus. Audenz is a vaccine indicated for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine. Audenz is approved for use in persons six months of age and older at increased risk of exposure to the influenza A virus H5N1 subtype contained in the vaccine.

Zoonotic influenza vaccine Seqirus is authorized for use in the European Union. It is an H5N8 vaccine that is intended to provide acquired immunity against H5 subtype influenza A viruses.

===Universal flu vaccines===

A universal influenza vaccine that would not have to be designed and made for each flu season in each hemisphere would stabilize the supply, avoid errors in predicting the season&#x27;s variants, and protect against the escape of the circulating strains by mutation. Such a vaccine has been the subject of research for decades.

One approach is to use broadly neutralizing antibodies that, unlike the annual seasonal vaccines used over the first decades of the 21st century that provoke the body to generate an immune response, instead provide a component of the immune response itself. The first neutralizing antibodies were identified in 1993, via experimentation. It was found that the flu neutralizing antibodies bound to the stalk of the Hemagglutinin protein. Antibodies that could bind to the head of those proteins were identified. The highly conserved M2 proton channel was proposed as a potential target for broadly neutralizing antibodies.

The challenges for researchers are to identify single antibodies that could neutralize many subtypes of the virus so that they could be useful in any season, and that target conserved domains that are resistant to antigenic drift.

Another approach is to take the conserved domains identified from these projects, and to deliver groups of these antigens to provoke an immune response; various approaches with different antigens, presented in different ways (as fusion proteins, mounted on virus-like particles, on non-pathogenic viruses, as DNA, and others), are under development.

Efforts have also been undertaken to develop universal vaccines that specifically activate a T-cell response, based on clinical data showing that people with a strong, early T-cell response have better outcomes when infected with influenza and because T-cells respond to conserved epitopes. The challenge for developers is that these epitopes are on internal protein domains that are only mildly immunogenic.

Along with the rest of the vaccine field, people working on universal vaccines have experimented with vaccine adjuvants to improve the ability of their vaccines to create a sufficiently powerful and enduring immune response.

===Oral influenza vaccine===
As of 2019, an oral flu vaccine was in clinical research. The oral vaccine candidate is based on an adenovirus type5 vector modified to remove genes needed for replication, with an added gene that expresses a small double-stranded RNA hairpin molecule as an adjuvant. In 2020, a phaseII human trial of the pill form of the vaccine showed that it was well tolerated and provided similar immunity to a licensed injectable vaccine.

===Possible Pleiotropic Effects===
Recent observational studies and clinical trials suggest nonspecific effects of influenza vaccination, known as pleiotropic effects, with broader impact beyond protecting against influenza infection. A meta-analysis of 9001 randomized trial participants found that influenza vaccination was associated with a 34% lower risk of major adverse cardiovasular events when compared to placebo. This risk reduction size is comparable to the cardioprotective effects seen with other guideline-recommended cardiovascular medications, including statins. Protection against stroke of all etiologies has also been suggested in a large population-based retrospective cohort study of 4 million adults in Canada. There may also be protective effects against the development of type 1 diabetes and cancer-related mortality, which are active areas of investigation.

=== COVID-19 ===
An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS28/9/2021&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research indicates that influenza vaccination does not prevent COVID-19, but may reduce the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection.

=== Criticism ===
Tom Jefferson, who has led Cochrane Collaboration reviews of flu vaccines, has called clinical evidence concerning flu vaccines &quot;rubbish&quot; and has therefore declared them to be ineffective; he has called for placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials, which most in the field hold as unethical. His views on the efficacy of flu vaccines are rejected by medical institutions including the CDC and the National Institutes of Health, and by key figures in the field like Anthony Fauci.

Michael Osterholm, who led the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy 2012 review on flu vaccines, recommended getting the vaccine but criticized its promotion, saying, &quot;We have overpromoted and overhyped this vaccine... it does not protect as promoted. It&#x27;s all a sales job: it&#x27;s all public relations.&quot;

==Veterinary use==
Veterinary influenza vaccination aims to achieve the following four objectives:
# Protection from clinical disease
# Protection from infection with virulent virus
# Protection from virus excretion
# Serological differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (so-called DIVA principle).

===Horses===
Horses with horse flu can run a fever, have a dry hacking cough, have a runny nose, and become depressed and reluctant to eat or drink for several days but usually recover in two to three weeks. &quot;Vaccination schedules generally require a primary course of two doses, 3–6 weeks apart, followed by boosters at 6–12 month intervals. It is generally recognized that in many cases such schedules may not maintain protective levels of antibody and more frequent administration is advised in high-risk situations.&quot;

It is a common requirement at shows in the United Kingdom that horses be vaccinated against equine flu and a vaccination card must be produced; the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) requires vaccination every six months.

===Poultry===
It is possible to vaccinate poultry against specific strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Vaccination should be combined with other control measures such as infection monitoring, early detection, and biosecurity.

===Pigs===
Swine influenza vaccines are extensively used in pig farming in Europe and North America. Most swine flu vaccines include an H1N1 and an H3N2 strain.

Swine influenza has been recognized as a major problem since the outbreak in 1976. Evolution of the virus has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the problem when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection. Customised (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are made and used in the more difficult cases. The vaccine manufacturer Novartis claims that the H3N2 strain (first identified in 1998) has brought major losses to pig farmers. Abortion storms are a common sign and sows stop eating for a few days and run a high fever. The mortality rate can be as high as fifteen percent.

===Dogs===
In 2004, influenza A virus subtype H3N8 was discovered to cause canine influenza. Because of the lack of previous exposure to this virus, dogs have no natural immunity to this virus. However, a vaccine was found in 2004.

<text>Pinus latteri, or Tenasserim pine, is a pine native to Mainland Southeast Asia.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus latteri&quot; is a medium-sized to large tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is orange-red, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk, and thin and flaky in the upper crown. The leaves (&#x27;needles&#x27;) are in pairs, moderately slender, long and just over thick, green to yellowish green. The cones are narrow conic, long and 4 cm broad at the base when closed, green at first, ripening glossy red-brown. They open to 6–8 cm broad, often some time after maturity or following heating by forest fires, to release the seeds. The seeds are long, with a wing, and are wind-dispersed.

===Related species===
&quot;Pinus latteri&quot; is closely related to Sumatran pine (&quot;Pinus merkusii&quot;), which occurs further south in Southeast Asia in Sumatra and the Philippines; some botanists treat the two as conspecific (under the name &quot;P. merkusii&quot;, which was described first), but the Sumatran pine differs in shorter (15–20 cm) and slenderer (under 1 mm thick) leaves, smaller cones with thinner scales, the cones opening at maturity, and seeds only half the weight. It is also related to the group of Mediterranean pines including Aleppo pine and Turkish pine, which share many features with it.

==Distribution and habitat==
It grows in the mountains of southeastern Burma, northern Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Guangxi Province and Hainan island of China.

It generally occurs at moderate elevations, mostly from , but occasionally as low as and up to . The tree is named after the Tenasserim Hills between Myanmar and Thailand.

<text>The black robin or Chatham Island robin (Moriori: &#x27;, ; Petroica traversi&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is an endangered bird from the Chatham Islands off the east coast of New Zealand. It is closely related to the South Island robin (&quot;P. australis&quot;). It was first described by Walter Buller in 1872. The binomial commemorates the New Zealand botanist Henry H. Travers (1844–1928). Unlike its mainland counterparts, its flight capacity is somewhat reduced. Evolution in the absence of mammalian predators made it vulnerable to introduced species, such as cats and rats, and it became extinct on the main island of the Chatham group before 1871, being restricted to Little Mangere Island thereafter.

==Discovery and taxonomy==
The first mention of the black robin in science was at a presentation given by William Travers at the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1871. He presented the findings of his son, Henry Travers, who had visited the Chatham Islands to investigate their fauna. Although Henry Travers&#x27; notes on his visit were published the following year, it was the publication of Walter Buller a month later that is considered the species&#x27; official description.

In 1905 it was believed to be completely vanished: &quot;...the so-called black Tit or black Robin, &quot;Miro traversi&quot;, have fallen victims to man and his satellites.&quot; 

==Description==
The black robin is a small, sparrow-sized bird measuring . Its plumage is almost entirely brownish-black, with a black bill and brownish-black yellow-soled feet.

Females are usually slightly smaller than males. Male songs are a simple phrase of 5 to 7 notes. Its call is a high-pitched single note. Their eyes are dark brown. Black robins moult between December and March.

==Habitat==

Black robins live in low-altitude scrub forest remnants. They are entirely insectivorous, feeding on the forest floor or on low branches, and preferring to nest in hollow trees and tree stumps. To shelter from the strong winds and rough seas around the islands, they frequent the lower branches of the forest, or in flat areas with deep litter layers. They prefer woody vegetation under the canopies of trees such as akeake.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Black robins are territorial. Males will patrol and defend their areas. Females have been known to chase away other females. They make short flights from branch to branch and do not fly long distances.

===Diet and feeding===
Black robins forage in the leaf litter on the ground for grubs, cockroaches, wētā, and worms. Black robins will hunt for food during the day and night and have good night vision.

===Breeding===
Black robins will generally start to breed at two years of age. The female robin will make the nest, and while she lays and incubates the eggs, the male will feed the female for a rest.

Eggs are laid between early October and late December. A second clutch may be laid if the first is unsuccessful. The clutch size varies from one to three eggs, but two is typical. Eggs are creamy in colour with purple splotches. When the eggs are laid, the female will sit on them to keep them warm until they hatch, after about 18 days. Then both parents will help to feed the chicks. Young robins stay in the nest for about 23 days after hatching, but even after leaving the nest the parents will continue to feed them until they are about 65 days old. This period of parental care is longer than would normally be expected for a bird of this size. After leaving the nest, chicks often spend the first day or two on the ground learning to use their wings, and here they are exposed to predators.

===Life expectancy===
Survivorship between 1980 and 1991 indicates a mean life expectancy of four years. &quot;Old Blue&quot;, the sole breeding female in 1980, lived for over 14 years. Some black robins can live from 6 to 13 years.

==Conservation and distribution==
There are now around 300 black robins (in 2021), but in 1980 only five survived on Little Mangere Island. They were saved from extinction by Don Merton and his Wildlife Service team, and by &quot;Old Blue&quot;, the last remaining fertile female. The remaining birds were moved to Mangere Island. The team increased the annual output of Old Blue (and later other females) by removing the first clutch every year and placing the eggs in the nest of the Chatham race of the tomtit, a technique known as cross-fostering. The tomtits raised the first brood, and the black robins, having lost their eggs, relaid and raised another brood.

Many females laid eggs on the rims of nests where the eggs could not survive without help. Human conservationists pushed the eggs back into the nests where they were incubated and hatched successfully. The maladaptive gene causing this behaviour spread until over 50% of females laid rim eggs. Humans stopped pushing eggs back in time to prevent the gene spreading to all birds which could have made the birds dependent on humans indefinitely. After human intervention stopped, rim laying became less frequent, but 9% of birds still laid rim eggs as of 2011. Conservationists have faced some criticism that they may inadvertently do harm, if they allow organisms with deleterious traits to survive and perpetuate what is maladaptive.

All of the surviving black robins are descended from &quot;Old Blue&quot;, giving little genetic variation among the population and creating the most extreme population bottleneck possible. However, this does not seem to have caused inbreeding problems, leading to speculation that the species has passed through several such population reductions in its evolutionary past, and has lost any alleles that could cause deleterious inbreeding effects. It was generally assumed that the minimum viable population protecting from inbreeding depression was around 50 individuals, but this is now known to be an inexact average, with the actual numbers being below 10 in rapidly reproducing small-island species, such as the black robin, to several hundred in long-lived continental species with a wide distribution (such as elephants or tigers).

Nest predation by introduced common starlings is the most common cause of nesting failure for black robins on Rangatira Island, with almost 21% of nests failing due to starlings. Incidents of failure caused by starlings are more common when black robins nest in cavities compared to open nests.

The species is still vulnerable, but now numbers around 300 individuals in populations on Mangere Island and South East Island. Ongoing restoration of habitat and eradication of introduced predators is being undertaken, so that the population of this and other endangered Chatham endemics can be spread to several populations, decreasing the risk of extinction by natural disasters or similar stochastic events. Attempts made to establish another population in a fenced covenant on Pitt Island have failed so far.

<text>Italo house (often simply referred to as &quot;Italian&quot; or &quot;Italian house&quot; in the UK) is a form of house music originating in Italy. Typically popular in Italy, Britain, and United States since the late 1980s, it fuses house music and Italo disco. The genre&#x27;s main musical characteristic is its use of predominantly electronic piano chords in a more lyrical form than classic Chicago house records. The best known example is Black Box&#x27;s &quot;Ride on Time&quot;, but the genre became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s for the uplifting and anthemic tunes against the background of indie-dance.

==History==
&quot;Italo-house&quot; as it became known in the early 1990s was a happy, euphoric sound; pioneered essentially by the production stable of Gianfranco Bortolotti, whose alter egos included Cappella, R.A.F., East Side Beat, and the 49ers. Records produced in Italy dominated the UK dance charts of 1990/91 with tunes including Asha&#x27;s &quot;JJ Tribute&quot; (lead vocals by Joyce Chung), DJ H&#x27;s &quot;Think About&quot;, Last Rhythm&#x27;s &quot;Last Rhythm&quot;, and Jinny&#x27;s &quot;Keep Warm&quot; signifying the uplifting, happy vibe. Artists such as K-Klass, Bassheads, and Felix built on the Italian piano sound to create uplifting tunes still played out today, although the pioneers of the sound such as DJ Sasha have long since left the happy vibe of piano house to concentrate on other styles.

<text>Connie and Carla is a 2004 American comedy film directed by Michael Lembeck and starring Nia Vardalos, Toni Collette, and David Duchovny. The screenplay was written by Vardalos.

The film was shot in Vancouver and featured a number of local drag queens, including Joan-E, Justine Tyme, Carlotta Gurl, Devana Demille, Seemore Illusion, and Vivian Von BrokenHymen.

==Plot==
Connie and Carla are two performers whose lifelong friendship and co-obsession with musical theater have brought nothing but career dead ends. Despite this, they continue their optimism, hosting a variety act at an airport lounge. After accidentally witnessing a mafia hit in Chicago, they go on the run, landing in Los Angeles. After being fired from a beauty salon, they pose as drag queens and audition to host a drag revue at a gay club called &quot;The Handlebar.&quot;

Because they sing their own songs (a rarity for queens), they are hired, and their variety show (at first titled &quot;What a Drag (Pun Intended!)&quot; and later re-titled &quot;Connie and Carla and the Belles of the Balls&quot; after they add a few friends to the act) becomes a hit.

Things are going smoothly but they make a pact not to let men interfere with their life. This causes conflict when Connie falls for Jeff, the straight brother of Robert, one of their drag queen friends. As the show gets bigger, they convince the club owner, Stanley, to convert it into a full dinner theater, and eventually their popularity threatens to expose them.

On the official opening night of the dinner theater, the mob killers catch up with them. With the help of their drag queen friends, and to great applause from the audience (who think it is part of their act), Connie and Carla take them down.

They ultimately confess their real identities to the audience and are accepted for who they are. Connie reveals herself to Jeff, who arrives after the chaos. He accepts her and becomes her boyfriend.

<text>Roshi (November 20, 1911 - December 14, 1992) was a master of the end-blown Japanese bamboo flute. He studied Rinzai Zen, attaining the title of .

Born as Tanaka Masaru, he was also known as Tanaka Fumon, Itcho Fumon, Watazumi Fumon, and Watazumi Shuso.

Watazumi played unlacquered instruments that he referred to as hotchiku, in contrast with the modern shakuhachi, stressing that to truly understand nature and oneself, one had to use an instrument of the most raw and natural origin. From this grew what he called &quot;Watazumidō&quot; &quot;Way of Watazumi&quot;.

In addition to hotchiku, Watazumi used the jō for exercise, invigoration, and training.

==Quotations==
* &quot;It&#x27;s fine that you are all deep into music. But there&#x27;s something deeper and if you would go deeper, if you go to the source of where the music is being made, you&#x27;ll find something even more interesting. At the source, everyone&#x27;s individual music is made. If you ask what the deep place is, it&#x27;s your own life and it&#x27;s knowing your own life, that own way that you live.&quot;
* &quot;When you hear some music or hear some sound, if for some reason you like it very well; the reason is that sound is in balance or in harmony with your pulse. And so making a sound, you try to make various different sounds that imitate various different sounds of the universe, but what you are finally making is your own sound, the sound of yourself.&quot;
* &quot;He who blows Ro 10 minutes every day can become a master.&quot;

<text>Benjamin L. &quot;Ben&quot; Abruzzo (June 9, 1930 – February 11, 1985) was an American balloonist and businessman who helped make Albuquerque, New Mexico, into an international ballooning center. He was part of the balloon crews that made the first Atlantic Ocean crossing by balloon in the Double Eagle II and the first Pacific Ocean crossing by balloon in the Double Eagle V.


==Life==
Abruzzo was born in Rockford, Illinois. He graduated from the University of Illinois with a BS in business administration in 1952 and commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Air Force. Abruzzo was stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico; adopting New Mexico as his home state after leaving military service in 1954. After working at Sandia Corporation, he became chairman and president of Alvarado Realty Company and started working with the local ski resort. Abruzzo became chairman and president of Sandia Peak Ski Company, Sandia Peak Tram Company, and Sandia Peak Utility Company. He also developed the Sandia Heights subdivision of homes around the base of the Sandia Tram.  

==Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta==
Abruzzo took an interest in hot air ballooning in the early 1970s. In 1972, Abruzzo and other local balloon pilots held the first Albuquerque balloon fiesta with just thirteen balloons launching from a shopping mall parking lot. The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is now the largest ballooning event of its kind in the world, with over 600 balloons participating each October.

==Double Eagle==

In 1977 Abruzzo and fellow balloonist Maxie Anderson decided to attempt a crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in a helium filled gas balloon named the &quot;Double Eagle&quot;. The balloon was named in honor of Charles Lindbergh, who in 1927 was the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a small single engined aircraft alone. The flight of the &quot;Double Eagle&quot; occurred fifty years after Lindbergh&#x27;s feat, and was the eleventh recorded attempt to make the crossing, which had been an open challenge in ballooning for more than a century. The balloon launched from Marshfield, Massachusetts on September 9. After being blown off course by stormy weather, the team was forced to ditch three miles off the coast of Iceland on September 12, hours after taking off. Abruzzo suffered exposure and frostbite during the flight and was forced to abandon the attempt.

==Double Eagle II==
The Abruzzo and Anderson team, this time with Larry Newman, made a second attempt in the &quot;Double Eagle II&quot; in 1978. The team took off from Presque Isle, Maine on August 11 and made a successful landing in Miserey, France six days later. ABC Sports aired a short form documentary special about the flight hosted by Bob Beatty entitled &quot;The Spirit of &#x27;78: The Flight of DOUBLE EAGLE II&quot;. For their efforts, the team was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1979. Later that year, Abruzzo and Anderson piloted together to win the first since WWII International Gordon Bennett Race in the balloon “Double Eagle III”. The Bennett race was suspended in 1939 due to hostilities, not resuming until 1979, with official Gordon Bennett Cup (ballooning) restart in 1983.

==Double Eagle V==
Abruzzo was also on the &quot;Double Eagle V&quot; team. The &quot;Double Eagle V&quot; was the first team to cross the Pacific Ocean in a gas balloon in November 1981. This flight also set a record for longest trip by a team in a balloon.

==Death and legacy==
Ben Abruzzo died on 11 February 1985 when the Cessna 421 he was piloting crashed near Albuquerque. Abruzzo&#x27;s wife and four others also died in the crash. Abruzzo&#x27;s son, Richard Abruzzo, was also a noted balloonist. He too died in an aviation accident.

Creating a foundation, the Abruzzo and Anderson families partnered with the City of Albuquerque and constructed the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum next to the launch field of the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. The World&#x27;s most photographed event, Fiesta is held the second week of every October.

Abruzzo had partnered with Robert Nordhaus, a retired lawyer and father of Nobel Prize-winning economist William Nordhaus, to purchase the La Madera Ski Area, now known as Sandia Peak Ski Area, from the Albuquerque Ski Club in 1958. Together, they oversaw many improvements to the resort. Two entities at the resort are named for his famous balloon: a ski run, &quot;Double Eagle II&quot;; and the ski lodge, Double Eagle II Day Lodge.

<doc id="1045731" wikidata="Q795321" url="?curid=1045731" title="B83 nuclear bomb">
<text>The B83 is a variable-yield thermonuclear gravity bomb developed by the United States in the late 1970s that entered service in 1983. With a maximum yield of , it has been the most powerful nuclear weapon in the United States nuclear arsenal since October 25, 2011 after retirement of the B53. It was designed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

==History==
The B83 was based partly on the earlier B77 program, which was terminated because of cost overruns. The B77 was designed with an active altitude control and lifting parachute system for supersonic low-altitude delivery from the B-1A bomber. Likely B77 nuclear component test firings were attributed to the Operation Anvil series in 1975 and 1976, specifically the &quot;Cheese&quot; test shots in Anvil:
* Anvil Kasseri – 28 October 1975, (B77/B83 full yield)
* Anvil Muenster – 3 January 1976, 
* Anvil Fontina – 12 February 1976, 
* Anvil Colby – 14 May 1976, 
The B83 nuclear components have been attributed as the same as the earlier B77.

The B83 replaced several earlier weapons, including the B28, B43, and to some extent the ultra-high-yield B53. It was the first U.S. nuclear weapon designed from the start to avoid accidental detonation, with the use of &quot;insensitive explosives&quot; in the trigger lens system. Its layout is similar to that of the smaller B61, with the warhead mounted in the forward part of the weapon to make the bomb nose-heavy. It was intended for high-speed carriage (up to Mach 2.0) and delivery at high or low altitude. For the latter role, it is equipped with a parachute retardation system, with a Kevlar ribbon parachute capable of rapid deceleration. It can be employed in free-fall, retarded, contact, and laydown modes, for air-burst or ground-burst detonation. Security features include next-generation permissive action link (PAL) and a command disablement system (CDS), rendering the weapon tactically useless without a nuclear yield.

The B83 was test fired in the Grenadier Tierra nuclear weapon test on 15 December 1984, at a reduced yield of 80 kilotonnes due to the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.

With the dismantling of the last B53 bomb in 2011, the B83 became the highest yield nuclear weapon in the U.S. arsenal. In 2022, the Biden administration announced plans to retire the B83. The B61-13 is planned to replace the B83. Although its yield is lower at , it incorporates guidance features of the B61-12 for better accuracy while being more powerful than that version to strike harder and large-area targets.

==Design==
The bomb is long, with a diameter of . The actual nuclear explosive package, judging from published drawings, occupies some in the forward part of the bomb case. The bomb weighs approximately . The location of the lifting lugs shows that the greater part of the total mass is contained in the nuclear explosive. 

The bomb has a variable yield: the destructive power is adjustable from somewhere in the low kiloton range up to a maximum of , some 80 times the explosive power of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The weapon is protected by a Category &quot;D&quot; Permissive Action Link (PAL) that prevents the enabling or detonation of the weapon without proper authorization.

About 650 B83s were built, and the weapon remains in service as part of the United States &quot;Enduring Stockpile&quot;.

==Aircraft capable of carrying the B83== 
The following aircraft are certified for carrying the B83 bomb:

*F-16 Fighting Falcon 
*F-15E Strike Eagle
*B-52 Stratofortress (formerly)
*B-1B Lancer (formerly)
*B-2 Spirit

Nuclear capability has been removed from the B-1B, mostly attributed to START I &amp; START II, and the B-52 no longer carries gravity nuclear bombs.

==Novel uses==
The B83 is one of the weapons considered for use in the &quot;Nuclear Bunker Buster&quot; project, which for a time was known as the Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, or RNEP. While most efforts have focused on the smaller B61-11 nuclear bomb, Los Alamos National Laboratory was also analyzing the use of the B83 in this role.

The physics package contained within the B83 has been studied for use in asteroid impact avoidance strategies against any seriously threatening near earth asteroids. Six such warheads, configured for the maximum , would be deployed by maneuvering space vehicles to &quot;knock&quot; an asteroid off course, should it pose a risk to the Earth.

<text>James Joseph Norton (born July 19, 1968) is an American comedian, radio personality, actor, author, and television and podcast host. Norton has been the co-host of the podcast &quot;UFC Unfiltered&quot; with Matt Serra since 2016, and the host of &quot;Jim Norton Can&#x27;t Save You&quot; since January 2025. He is well-known for co-hosting morning radio shows &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot;, &quot;Opie with Jim Norton&quot;, and &quot;Jim Norton &amp; Sam Roberts&quot; on SiriusXM Radio from 2004 until 2025, and &quot;The Chip Chipperson Podcast&quot; (Chip being one of Norton&#x27;s on-air characters) from 2017 until 2023.

He gained initial prominence as third mic on the radio show &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot;, with Gregg &quot;Opie&quot; Hughes and Anthony Cumia, from 2001 to 2014.

After becoming a stand-up comedian in 1990, Norton spent his early years developing his act. His appearances on &quot;The Louie Show&quot; caught the attention of comedian Andrew Dice Clay in 1997, who chose Norton to open for him for his shows. In 2000, Norton made his debut on &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; and joined the show as a third mic in 2001 which increased his national exposure. He went on to have a recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Lucky Louie&quot; and featured as a regular panellist on &quot;Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn&quot;. Since he joined SiriusXM with &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; in 2004, Norton hosted &quot;Opie with Jim Norton&quot; from 2014 to 2016, and &quot;The Jim Norton Advice Show&quot;.

Since 2003, Norton has released four comedy albums and seven comedy specials, including three on Epix and one on Netflix. In 2014, Norton hosted &quot;The Jim Norton Show&quot;, a talk show on Vice. He has written two books: &quot;Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch&quot; and &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot;.

==Early life==
James Joseph Norton was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He is of Irish descent. His mother was a librarian and his father was a former US Marine and army reservist who later worked as a driver for the US postal service. Norton grew up in North Brunswick, New Jersey with his sister Tracy.

Norton attended North Brunswick High School, from which he dropped out in his senior year. During this time, at age 13, Norton started to drink heavily, &quot;mostly vodka and grain alcohol&quot; because it got him drunk quicker. &quot;That feeling of discomfort that was always there, wasn&#x27;t there when I drank. It was just a way of feeling comfortable ... I was horribly insecure, horribly shy, always feeling ugly and weak.&quot; At 16, Norton started to cut himself with a razor blade in an attempt at &quot;attention-seeking ... It was &quot;notice me!&quot; crap. I was 16, 17, and drunk. I never did that stuff sober.&quot; He then missed some schooling, including his graduation from high school, after his alarmed parents sent him to a rehab facility in Princeton, New Jersey for one month, where he continued to sneak in alcohol but changed his thinking and completed the course at 18. When he was away, his class had voted him as class clown. Norton had his last drink at New Year&#x27;s Eve 1985 going into 1986, and has been alcohol and drug free since. Norton&#x27;s addictive personality began to direct towards sex after he got sober.

After being sober for around three years, Norton obtained his GED and attended Middlesex County College with the aim of pursuing a Juris Doctor degree and becoming a lawyer, but quit after one month. He earned a B grade in English and failing grades in Problems and Statistics, Science, and Western Civilization. At 18, he took up work in a copper company, operating a forklift to unload boxed tubes of copper from trucks, which he remembered as being &quot;awful.&quot; He was fired from the job at age 23. Norton collected unemployment benefits for several years, pretending to look for work while doing sets in local comedy venues, before he decided to pursue comedy full-time.

==Career==
===Stand-up===
Norton wished to pursue a career as a stand-up comedian when he was 12. He took an interest to comedy after his mother brought home comedy albums from work, and names Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Woody Allen, and Robert Klein as his influences. Norton performed his first stand-up routine in April 1990 at an open mic night at Varsity, a pub in Sayreville, New Jersey, when he was 21. He later described his performance as &quot;awful.&quot; Norton credited Pat Gaynor for putting him on stage that night, and Ward and John Magnuson of Rascals comedy club as being &quot;instrumental&quot; in his early development. Following his debut, Norton spent five years working on his stand-up traveling to New York, New Jersey, Boston, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Florida with comedians Jim Florentine and Bob Levy, who were coming up at the same time. Norton developed an act based on self-deprecating humor, which came naturally to him and gained encouragement when other comedians told him they enjoyed it. Around ten years into stand-up, Norton felt he had found his voice and felt comfortable enough on stage.

Norton had a breakthrough in 1997 after comedian Andrew Dice Clay noticed his appearance on &quot;The Louie Show&quot; and asked him to be his opening act on his tours when his original pick cancelled at the last minute. The two first met at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles where Norton was doing his first gig at the venue, and learned Clay wished to go on stage after him. Norton went on to open for Clay in the course of the following three years, playing large venues including Madison Square Garden in New York City in 2000.

The absence of &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; from the airwaves between August 2002 and October 2004 encouraged Norton to write and develop his stand-up act. Soon after the show&#x27;s cancellation, he underwent his Yellow Discipline Tour. In 2003, he had assembled a new 45-minute set and assembled his first comedy album, &quot;Yellow Discipline&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Trinkets I Own Made from Gorilla Hands&quot;, in April 2005. Soon after, Norton filmed his first half-hour HBO comedy special as part of the network&#x27;s &quot;One Night Stand&quot; series, at NYU&#x27;s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts after his manager informed him of the chance to perform a showcase in the New York City area. In 2004, Norton was voted best comedian and breakthrough performer of the year on Cringe Humor. Following his return to radio in 2004, Norton began a weekday routine of doing radio in the morning and performing short sets in a New York City comedy club, mostly the Comedy Cellar, in the evening to work on new material. From 2006 to 2008, Norton featured on every show of the annual Opie and Anthony&#x27;s Traveling Virus Comedy Tour. In 2008, Norton hosted a four-part show on HBO titled &quot;Down and Dirty with Jim Norton&quot; that featured Lemmy as its musical director. He had Amy Schumer be his opening act in her early career.

Norton had a productive start in the 2010s, writing and releasing three hour long specials in three and a half years. He released his first, &quot;Please Be Offended&quot; on the television channel Epix in June 2012, and features Ozzy Osbourne sitting on a toilet introducing Norton. He chose the network as they allowed him complete creative freedom and were willing to promote his product. Norton followed it with &quot;American Degenerate&quot;, his second for Epix, which aired in August 2013 before it was released on Netflix that November. In April 2015, Norton released his fourth Epix special, &quot;Contextually Inadequate&quot;. Within three months of its release, Norton was touring with a new hour of material. In the following year, Norton described his career as &quot;stagnant... there&#x27;s nothing happening.&quot;

In 2017, Norton&#x27;s special &quot;A Mouthful of Shame&quot; debuted on Netflix. He promoted it with the 31-date Mouthful of Shame Tour, his first nationwide theatre tour as headliner, throughout 2016. The special includes an opening with Robert De Niro spanking Norton&#x27;s bare bottom. Later in 2017, Norton embarked on his first stand-up tour of Europe. He signed with WME to pitch ideas for his own series on Netflix. He appeared in Season 2, Episode 1 of the Netflix standup comedy series &quot;The Degenerates,&quot; released on December 31, 2019.

===Radio===

In early 2001, Norton was hired as the third mic on the &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; radio show on WNEW in New York City, with hosts Gregg &quot;Opie&quot; Hughes and Anthony Cumia. He resisted calling himself a &quot;host&quot; of the show as he believes his strongest performances were when he was &quot;an outsider looking in.&quot; He first appeared on the show in 2000 with Clay during his time opening for him on tour and became a regular guest and sat in on some shows. In November 2000, Norton was arrested with comedian Lewis Black and show producer Rick Del Gado during their live reports on board the Teen Voyeur Bus, a transparent bus of topless women driving around the city. It so happened that the bus&#x27; route was also the route that President Bill Clinton was taking that day, but the show was not informed of the news. Norton spent the night in jail. In August 2002, the show was cancelled following the controversial Sex for Sam 3 segment and remained off the air for two years. Norton returned to the radio with Hughes and Cumia on XM Satellite Radio, an uncensored satellite radio service, in October 2004. Cumia said Norton contributed a &quot;dark and perverse&quot; side to the show.

In October 2008, Norton was sued by New York City attorney Roy Den Hollander over his treatment during a phone interview on &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot;. In August 2009, &quot;The New York Post&quot; reported that Hollander was willing to drop his suit if Norton would also drop his motion to have Hollander sanctioned for filing a baseless claim, as well as being forced to pay Norton&#x27;s legal fees.

On December 2, 2009, Norton had an on-air argument with Jesse Ventura about the September 11 attacks and measures against illegal immigration. Ventura was arguing against what Norton claimed was the Border Patrol practice of stopping individuals and asking them to produce ID deep within US borders, claiming that such actions were unconstitutional. At some point, when Norton disagreed with him on this, Ventura suggested that Norton did not believe in the Constitution to which Norton strongly objected. Soon after, as the argument became more heated, Ventura walked off the air and the two exchanged explicit comments towards each other.
In May 2010, &quot;The Jim Norton Show&quot; premiered on the Raw Dog Comedy channel on SiriusXM. The show featured Norton as the host with other comedians plus clips of live stand-up.

After Cumia was fired from SiriusXM in July 2014, Hughes and Norton continued to broadcast and became the hosts of &quot;Opie with Jim Norton&quot;, during which time the channel was renamed Opie Radio. Norton quickly missed working with Cumia, disliked the title of the re-branded program, and felt that he had not taken over the vacant spot left by Cumia, but rather was a voice on a show hosted by Hughes. The show ended in September 2016. During this time, Norton also hosted a weekly advice show on SiriusXM named &quot;The Jim Norton Advice Show&quot;.

In October 2016, Norton became the host of &quot;Jim Norton &amp; Sam Roberts&quot; with former &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; intern and producer Sam Roberts. Norton also hosted a nightly one-hour playlist segment on Ozzy&#x27;s Boneyard, a channel on SiriusXM, named Obsessed that aired some of Norton&#x27;s favorite tracks. In January 2025, Norton revealed that he and SiriusXM had parted ways after failing to come to terms on a contract renewal, ending his tenure with SiriusXM after more than 20 years.

===Podcasting===
In mid-2016, Norton ended an online crowdfunding campaign via Indiegogo for the production of &quot;The Chip Chipperson Show&quot;, an animated web series based on the same titled character that he does on the radio. He started the character as a way of hassling his girlfriend. He had received many requests to have the concept animated, and launched the project to have five full episodes made by Big Hug Productions. Norton voiced the character in the series that also featured his other characters, including Uncle Paul Harghis, Jelly, Edgar Mellencamp, and Ted Scheckler. The fund raised over $61,000 from 724 donators.

In May 2016, Norton became the co-host of &quot;UFC Unfiltered&quot;, the first Ultimate Fighting Championship audio podcast, with former fighter Matt Serra. The pair record two episodes each week. The first episode launched on June 21, 2016, and has since run for over 550 episodes. Norton then launched his own weekly audio and video podcast based on his Chip Chipperson character, on the Riotcast network. &quot;The Chip Chipperson Podacast&quot; launched on April 9, 2017. In May 2020, Norton debuted the &quot;Doug Bellcast&quot;, a new podcast based on his new character, Doug Bell.

===Television===
In 1997, Norton appeared on &quot;The Louie Show&quot; starring Louie Anderson. From 2002 to 2004, Norton was a regular performer on the comedy series &quot;Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn&quot;. He then lost his place on the second season of &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; in 2004 because of a contractual obligation to film pilot episodes for MTV which he had secured following the success of his &quot;One Night Stand&quot; special. The two pilots were &quot;Camp Cool&quot;, filmed in Cancun for &quot;MTV Spring Break&quot;, also starring Al Shearer about helping men meet women, and &quot;Stupid Bets&quot;. His manager advised him not to compete in &quot;Last Comic Standing&quot; as it was a reality show, but he agreed as he was depressed and frustrated with the uncertainty of his career as &quot;Opie and Anthony&quot; had been cancelled. Norton had a contract with Viacom during this time.

In September 2004, Norton made his first appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and appeared twice more by mid-2006. He has appeared many times since, including as a correspondent named &quot;The Uninvited Guest.&quot; In April 2005, Norton starred in a pilot episode for Louis C.K.&#x27;s HBO sitcom &quot;Lucky Louie&quot;, playing as Louie&#x27;s friend Rich. He landed the role after the series was picked up by the network and aired through 2006. In 2007, Norton co-hosted the AVN Awards with Jessica Drake. In June 2008, Norton appeared in several episodes of &quot;The Gong Show with Dave Attell&quot; as one of the celebrity judges. Since mid-2007, Norton has been a regular guest on &quot;Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld&quot; on Fox News which he later credited as a contributor in boosting turnouts to his comedy shows. In 2010, Norton guest-hosted &quot;Red Eye&quot;. Starting in 2010, Norton began appearing in Louis C.K.&#x27;s FX sitcom &quot;Louie&quot;. In 2010, Norton&#x27;s role in &quot;Bored to Death&quot; was tailored by its creator Jonathan Ames, a fan of his. In 2013, Norton said he had pitched a television show about a sex addict radio show host, but it was not picked up.

In July 2014, Norton debuted his four-episode talk show, &quot;The Jim Norton Show&quot;, on Vice a first for the network. The show featured opening monologues, pre-recorded bits, and guest interviews including co-host Bailey Jay, comedians Dave Attell, Whitney Cummings, and Gilbert Gottfried; and Mike Tyson, Dana White, and &quot;Freeway&quot; Rick Ross. Norton had assistance with the writing from comedians Kurt Metzger and Jesse Joyce. Vice had expressed an interest in filming more episodes, but Norton became unsure because he wasn&#x27;t paid for the first season
. Looking back on the project, Norton was pleased with its outcome and entered talks with regard to continuing the format with other networks. In 2015, Norton starred in an episode of Quinn&#x27;s parody television series &quot;Cop Show&quot;. In April 2016, Norton revealed that he had shot two pilot episodes for a potential comedy series on the AMC channel. Though it was not picked up, the show was reworked into a discussion program where he hosts a panel who talk about a single subject for thirty minutes.

===Books===
In early 2007, Norton announced the near completion of his first book, a collection of stories of his life with anecdotes from his childhood and his comedy career. &quot;Happy Endings: The Tales of a Meaty-Breasted Zilch&quot; was released on July 10, 2007. It reached No. 4 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction, and entered the Amazon.com Top 10 for books the day it was released, peaking at No. 7.

Norton released his second book, &quot;I Hate Your Guts&quot;, on November 4, 2008. It reached No. 13 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list under hardcover non-fiction. He criticizes people in the book, including Al Sharpton, Keith Olbermann, and Steve Martin, which includes a rant that Norton later regretted and has since apologized for to Martin.

===Film===
In 2002, Norton appeared on the short film &quot;Crooks&quot;, a straight to video release about postal workers stealing stamps. Norton has had various cameo appearances such as in the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and the 2008 film &quot;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&quot;. He has also appeared in the films &quot;Furry Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Cop Out&quot;, and &quot;Special Correspondents&quot;. Norton recalled around 2003 being a time when his acting career had gained some momentum.

In 2016, Norton landed a role in &quot;From Nowhere&quot;, a critically acclaimed independent film about three teenagers from the Bronx. This was followed by an appearance in &quot;Pitching Tents&quot;. Norton had a pivotal role in the 2008 film &quot;Courting Condi&quot;, counseling Devin Ratray on how to win the heart of Condoleezza Rice.

Norton starred in the crime film &quot;The Irishman&quot; as a young Don Rickles who tells jokes to a crowd with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci present. He landed the part without an audition, and De Niro requested that Norton perform his own material after using jokes from Rickles&#x27;s act from the 1970s.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Norton bought an apartment on the Upper West Side of New York City. He is a longtime fan of Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, and Kiss and is a close family friend of Osbourne and his wife Sharon. Norton is a supporter of prostitution and transgender people.

On the October 23, 2023, episode of radio show &quot;Jim Norton &amp; Sam Roberts&quot;, Norton announced that he had married a Norwegian, transgender male-to-female webcam model named Nikki.

<doc id="1045736" wikidata="Q1258299" url="?curid=1045736" title="Thirty Tyrants (Roman)">
<text>The Thirty Tyrants (Latin: &quot;Tyranni Triginta&quot;) were a series of thirty rulers who appear in the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, as having ostensibly been pretenders to the throne of the Roman Empire during the reign of the emperor Gallienus.

Given the notorious unreliability of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, the veracity of this list is debatable. There is a scholarly consensus that the author deliberately inflated the number of pretenders in order to parallel the Thirty Tyrants of Athens.

The &quot;Historia&quot; actually gives 32 names. The author, who wrote under the name of Trebellius Pollio, places the last two during the reigns of Maximinus Thrax and Claudius II respectively, leaving thirty alleged pretenders during the reign of Gallienus.

The following list gives the Thirty Tyrants as depicted by the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, along with notes contrasting the Historia Augusta&#x27;s claims with their actual historical positions:

==Table==
Notwithstanding the author&#x27;s pretensions regarding the time during which these persons aspired to the throne, this list includes:
*two women and six youths who never claimed imperial dignity
*seven men who either certainly or probably never claimed imperial dignity
*three probably and two possibly fictitious persons
*two pretenders admittedly not contemporary with Gallienus
*three pretenders not contemporary with Gallienus

Leaving nine pretenders roughly contemporary with Gallienus. According to David Magie (the editor of the Loeb Classical Library edition of the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;), at least some of these men issued coins.

<doc id="1045744" wikidata="Q2600764" url="?curid=1045744" title="Variable yield">
<text>Variable yield, or dial-a-yield, is an option available on most modern nuclear weapons. It allows the operator to specify a weapon&#x27;s yield, or explosive power, allowing a single design to be used in different situations. For example, the Mod-10 B61 bomb had selectable explosive yields of 0.3, 5, 10 or 80 kilotons, depending on how the ground crew set a dial inside the casing when it was loaded onto an aircraft.

==Technology==
Variable yield technology has existed since at least the late 1950s. Examples of variable yield weapons include the B61 nuclear bomb family, B83, B43, W80, W85, and WE177A warheads.

Most modern nuclear weapons are Teller–Ulam design type thermonuclear weapons, with a fission &quot;primary&quot; stage and a fusion &quot;secondary stage&quot; that is collapsed by the energy from the primary. These offer at least three methods to vary yield:

* Varying primary yield by boosting with fusion, using small amounts of deuterium / tritium (DT) gas inside the primary fission bomb to increase its yield by supplying additional neutrons from DT fusion at the beginning of the fission process. Typically, the gas is injected a few seconds before detonation and the amount used can be presete.g., zero, 25%, 50%, or all of the gas.
* Changing the primary yield by varying the timing or use of external neutron initiators (ENIs). These are small particle accelerators that cause a brief fusion reaction by accelerating deuterium into a tritium target (or potentially vice versa), producing a short pulse of energetic neutrons. Precise timing of the ENI pulse as the nuclear primary&#x27;s pit is collapsing can significantly affect yield, and the rate of neutron injection can also be controlled.
* Shutting down the thermonuclear secondary, either by firing the primary at low enough yield that it does not compress the secondary sufficiently to ignite, or by blocking energy transport inside the warhead briefly as the primary is firing using shutters or a similar mechanism. If the primary&#x27;s energy starts to disperse through the radiation case before being focused on the secondary then the secondary will likely never detonate.

All current British nuclear warheads incorporate variable yield technology as standard.

==Popular Culture==
A dial-a-yield device is featured in the plot of the thriller novel &quot;Diablo Mesa&quot;.

<text>Mākara Peak Mountain Bike Park () is a mountain biking and walking park in Wellington, New Zealand.

== History ==
Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park opened in 1998. In 1998 the Wellington City Council set aside 200 hectares of retired farmland in Karori southwest of Wellington, New Zealand, for a mountain bike park. Development of it began almost immediately with volunteer work parties planting trees, removing pest animals and digging new tracks.

By 2014 the park had grown to 250 hectares with over 40 kilometres of hand-built single track and over 35,000 native seedlings planted. Pests such as goats, sheep, and possums had been dramatically reduced with volunteers maintaining possum traps and bait stations and mustelid traps, allowing new vegetation to flourish. Wellington City Council used the poison brodifacoum for possum control; 1080 was not used.

A 72-metre swing bridge was added to the mountain bike park in 2017 after a successful donation campaign raised over $35,000.

Tracks continue to be created and upgraded; a 2–3 year work plan began in 2020 to add more tracks in the north of the park.

== Operations ==
Mākara Peak Mountain Bike Park covers 250 hectares and has 40 kilometres of mountain biking trails. It also includes a skills area, which was renovated in 2020 to focus on jumps.

The park is free to use and open to both cyclists and pedestrians. Approximately 30% of its users are pedestrians.

The Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park was visited by 8% of the Wellington population in 2003 according to research carried out by the Wellington City Council. It has received a recreation award from the New Zealand Recreation Association and two conservation awards from the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

The park is jointly managed by the Wellington City Council and Makara Peak Mountain Bike Park Supporters Inc.

<doc id="1045754" wikidata="Q1066045" url="?curid=1045754" title="Charles Seeger">
<text>Charles Louis Seeger Jr. (December 14, 1886 – February 7, 1979) was an American musicologist, composer, teacher, and folklorist. He was the husband of the composer Ruth Crawford Seeger, father of the American folk singers Pete Seeger (1919–2014), Peggy Seeger (b. 1935), and Mike Seeger (1933–2009); and brother of the World War I poet Alan Seeger (1888–1916) and children&#x27;s author and educator Elizabeth Seeger (1889-1973).

==Life and career==
Seeger was born in Mexico City, Mexico, to American parents Elsie Simmons (née Adams) and Charles Louis Seeger. During the 1890s, the family lived in Staten Island, New York. Seeger graduated from Harvard College in 1908, then studied in Cologne, Germany and conducted with the Cologne Opera. Upon discovering a hearing impairment, he left Europe to take a position as Professor of Music at the University of California at Berkeley, where he taught from 1912 to 1916 before being dismissed for his public opposition to U.S. entry into World War I. His brother Alan Seeger was killed in action on July 4, 1916, while serving as a member of the French Foreign Legion. Charles Seeger then taught at The Juilliard School (originally the Institute of Musical Art) in New York from 1921 to 1933 and the New School for Social Research from 1931 to 1935.

Among Seeger&#x27;s many specific interests were prescriptive and descriptive music writing and determining the definition of what is meant by singing style.

Along with composer Henry Cowell, ethnomusicologist George Herzog, Helen Heffron Roberts and Dorothy Lawton of the New York Public Library, Seeger was a founding member of the American Society for Comparative Musicology in 1933, the parent organization of the American Library of Musicology (ALM). Seeger envisioned the short-lived ALM as a publisher of music-related resources, but it ceased to exist by 1936.

In 1936, he was in Washington, DC, working as a technical advisor to the Music Unit of the Special Skills Division of the Resettlement Administration (later renamed the Farm Security Administration). From 1957 to 1961, he taught at the University of California Los Angeles. From 1961 to 1971 he was a research professor at the Institute of Ethnomusicology at UCLA. In 1949–50 he was visiting professor of the Theory of Music in the School of Music at Yale University. From 1935 to 1953 he held positions in the federal government&#x27;s Resettlement Administration, Works Projects Administration (WPA), and Pan American Union, including serving as an administrator for the WPA&#x27;s Federal Music Project, for which his wife also worked, from 1938 to 1940.

Seeger died on February 7, 1979, in Bridgewater, Connecticut. He was buried at the Springfield Cemetery in Springfield, Massachusetts along with his second wife.

==Family==
His first wife was Constance de Clyver Edson, a classical violinist and teacher; they divorced in 1927. They had three sons, Charles III (1912–2002), who was an astronomer, John (1914–2010), an educator, and Pete (1919–2014), a folk singer.

His second wife was the composer and musician Ruth Crawford Seeger (née Ruth Porter Crawford). With her he had four children: Mike Seeger (1933–2009), Peggy Seeger (b. 1935), Barbara Seeger and Penny Seeger (1943-1993). His grandson, Anthony Seeger (b. 1945), is an anthropologist and professor of ethnomusicology at the University of California Los Angeles.
==Contributions==
He is known, among other reasons, for his formulation of dissonant counterpoint. According to the ethnomusicologist Bruno Nettl, &quot;Seeger played a unique and central role in tying musicology to other disciplines and domains of culture. This collection shows him to be truly a musical &#x27;man for all seasons,&#x27; for what comes across most is the many-sidedness of the man.&quot;

<text>Gowanus ( ) is a neighborhood in the northwestern portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, within the area once known as South Brooklyn. The neighborhood is part of Brooklyn Community District 6. Gowanus is bounded by Wyckoff Street on the north, Fourth Avenue on the east, the Gowanus Expressway to the south, and Bond Street to the west.

==History==
In 1636, Gowanus Bay – named after Gauwane (Gouwane, &quot;the sleeper&quot;), a Canarsee Indian – was the site of the first settlement by Dutch farmers in what is now Brooklyn. The ponds of Gowanus meadowlands served to drive early settlers&#x27; tide-powered gristmills which were situated along the Gowanus Creek. During the American Revolutionary War, Gowanus was the scene of fighting in the Battle of Long Island and American soldiers positioned themselves in Gowanus Heights (now Park Slope), where they had full view of the British ships as they made landfall in the Bay.
In the 1860s, the Gowanus Creek was turned into the Gowanus Canal, and the area became a hub for manufacturing and shipping. As a result of the industry along the canal and the establishment of a combined sewer system that dumped waste water directly into a designated outflow at the head of the canal, the neighborhood came to be defined by the polluted canal. After World War II, the decline of shipping at the port of Red Hook and of manufacturing around New York City prompted large industry to leave and changed the vibrancy of industry in Gowanus. In the late 1940s, the neighborhood became the site of several NYCHA housing projects, which were built in part to house returning WWII veterans.

The water and much of the land along the banks of the Gowanus Canal have been severely polluted by combined sewer outflows (CSOs) along the canal designed to relieve sewage and storm water when the sewer treatment plant is overwhelmed, as well as by decades of industrial use and extensive coal gas manufacturing during the late 19th century. The Gowanus Canal was also an alleged Mafia dumping ground. Even so, in the early 1980s, alongside the canal, an old 19th-century munitions factory at 230 3rd Street in Gowanus became the site of the massive Gowanus Memorial Artyard, whose remains are still visible. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency designated the Gowanus Canal a Superfund site, allocating $506 million for the cleanup of decades of industrial pollution and sewage contamination. The completion date for the cleanup is set for 2022.

==21st century==

The area is zoned for light to mid-level manufacturing. In the first decade of the 21st century, residential developers were hindered by the industrial zoning and the problems of the sewage overflow through the canal water, but there have been rumors of rezoning by the New York City Department of City Planning. Many residents and community groups have expressed concern over the sewage overflow that the rezoning could possibly create. From 20132016, the City Planning Department, community groups, business owners, developers, arts organizations, and neighborhood residents participated in a &quot;community planning process&quot; called Bridging Gowanus intended to inform neighborhood rezoning processes with the intention of creating a land-use framework for the neighborhood.
Many &quot;coworking&quot; spaces were formed in Gowanus in the 2010s. More restaurants, bars, and art galleries moved to the neighborhood, and new real estate became available.

On the New York City Subway, the on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and the on the IND Culver Line run through Gowanus. Bike routes cross the canal on the Union Street, 3rd Street and 9th Street bridges. The elevated Gowanus Expressway runs through the southern edge of the neighborhood, crossing the canal at Hamilton Avenue. The Carroll Street Bridge, built in 1889, is the oldest of the four remaining retractable bridges in the country.

<doc id="1045757" wikidata="Q7505706" url="?curid=1045757" title="Shuttle by United">
<text>Shuttle by United was an &quot;airline within an airline&quot; operated as a subsidiary of United Airlines from 1994 to 2001 along the West Coast of the United States. It operated from San Francisco International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. Shuttle&#x27;s fleet consisted of Boeing 737-300s and 737-500s. The service was eventually renamed United Shuttle before it was shut down by United and its aircraft returned to mainline service with the airline.

==Operations==
The recession of the early 1990s and the expansion of low-cost carriers and other effects of deregulation pressured the major airlines to reduce costs and fares. In July 1994, United Airlines concluded an ESOP agreement with its pilot (ALPA) and machinists (IAM) unions whereby employees would take ownership of 55% of the airline in exchange for reduced wages (4.88 billion reduction for 5.5 years) and benefits for new employees. Disliked CEO Stephen Wolf was summarily removed (with a 75 million severance package) and a new management team, Jerry Greenwald and John Edwardson took the reins at United. The new &quot;Team&quot; began a spending spree. In their first year, they replaced all of United&#x27;s ground equipment. Eating up nearly all of the United&#x27;s ESOP tax advantage for 1994–1995. Feeling financially flush, management moved to organize the lowest scales into a new &quot;airline within an airline&quot; dubbed &quot;U-2&quot;.

&quot;U-2&quot; designed to replicate some of the cost and operational advantages of regional competitors such as Southwest Airlines. All 58 of its aircraft were of a single type, the Boeing 737. Hot meals were eliminated, aircraft turn-around times were reduced to less than 20 minutes and OAK replaced SFO as &quot;U-2&#x27;s&quot; new hub. The fare structure was reduced and simplified to lure passengers, with revenue stabilized by increasing frequency of service, over time, United was able to regain 80% of its market share that it had lost to Southwest.

At the same time, &quot;U-2&quot; would remain legally part of United Airlines, with access to its Apollo Computer Reservation System. In the beginning, &quot;U-2&quot; experimented with un-assigned seating (window-middle-aisle boarding). Not until near the end of the &quot;U-2&quot; did passengers again enjoy preassigned seating, could transfer seamlessly to and from &quot;mainline&quot; service, and accumulate miles in United&#x27;s MileagePlus frequent flyer program. In this respect, it resembled competitors&#x27; first generation &quot;airline within an airline&quot; divisions such as Continental Lite, Delta Express, and US Airways&#x27; MetroJet.

Development and testing for &quot;U-2&quot;, began in May 1993 at United&#x27;s Headquarters in Chicago, IL. On October 1, 1994, the first &quot;Shuttle by United&quot; flight departed out of SFO to LAX. SFO Fire Trucks created a &quot;water-arch&quot; for the aircraft to taxi through. Using Oakland, CA as their new hub, United&#x27;s, &quot;Shuttle by United&quot; offered flights to Los Angeles, Burbank and Ontario for as little as $19 one-way. Within nearly three years it had expanded to 20 cities and comprised 5% of United&#x27;s total capacity. In February 1996, Rono Dutta, United&#x27;s Senior Vice President of Planning, decided to return its successful &quot;Shuttle by United&quot; to a &quot;hub and spoke&quot; feeder to United&#x27;s Domestic and International flights which departed primarily from LAX and SFO on the West Coast. It didn&#x27;t take long for the Shuttle&#x27;s schedule and reputation to collapse. SFO replaced OAK as the Shuttle&#x27;s hub. Unlike OAK, when inclement weather hit SFO, arrival traffic was cut in half. This decision alone by Rono Dutta, became the straw that broke the Shuttle&#x27;s back. Profits tumbled, in 1995, United lost $47 million on $3.22 billion in revenue. In 1999, United established a second base in Terminal 8 of Los Angeles International Airport, United&#x27;s newest hub, by which time it also served as a feeder operation for United&#x27;s transcontinental and international services. In the late 1999 its name was changed to United Shuttle. United slowly converted the &quot;Shuttle&quot; to a hub and spoke feeder airline for its mainline and international flights. Rescheduling Shuttle flights to meld with mainline and international flights was the demise of the Shuttle. Prices started increasing and quick turnarounds disappeared.

With demand for travel to the San Francisco Bay Area heavy during the Dot-com bubble, Shuttle was profitable and United regained 80% of the market share that they had lost to Southwest Airlines in the early 1990s. Rono Dutta&#x27;s decision to return the Shuttle to a hub feeder airline meant the demise of the Shuttle. Cloud cover at SFO reduced arrival traffic by 50%. These frequent delays, exacerbated by Shuttle&#x27;s high frequency schedule and less than adequate staffing, meant the eventual demise of the Shuttle. In 2000 two out of three flights between SFO and LAX were delayed or canceled.

When air travel declined following the September 11 attacks in 2001 it became evident that cost savings had not materialized to justify the Shuttle, it was folded back into the mainline United operation and in 2007, its Boeing 737 aircraft were eventually repainted.

In December 2002 United declared bankruptcy and hinted at a revival of the Shuttle. Instead it created a leisure destination carrier called Ted, part of a second generation of &quot;airline within an airline&quot; services along with Delta Air Lines&#x27; Song and Air Canada Tango. Ted ceased operations in early 2009 and its fleet was folded back into United&#x27;s.

<doc id="1045761" wikidata="Q11013475" url="?curid=1045761" title="Minnesota nice">
<text>Minnesota nice is a cultural stereotype applied to the behavior of people from the U.S. state of Minnesota, implying residents are unusually courteous, reserved, and mild-mannered compared to people from other states. The phrase also implies polite friendliness, an aversion to open confrontation, a tendency toward understatement, a disinclination to make a direct fuss or stand out, apparent emotional restraint, and self-deprecation. It is sometimes associated with passive-aggression.

== Social norms ==

Playwright and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that &quot;Minnesota nice&quot; is not so much about being &quot;nice&quot; but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the social order, and keeping people (including non-natives of the state) in their place. He relates these social norms to the literary work of Danish-Norwegian novelist Aksel Sandemose, the fictional Law of Jante, and more generally, Scandinavian culture. Garrison Keillor&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; discusses &quot;Wobegonics&quot;, the supposed language of Minnesotans, which includes &quot;no confrontational verbs or statements of strong personal preference&quot;.

== Examples ==
The generosity of state citizens has been commented on; the heavily reported influenza vaccine shortage of late 2004 did not strike the state as hard as elsewhere since many people willingly gave up injections for others. The concept has also received some support from the academic community; a national study by Peter Rentfrow, Samuel D. Gosling, and Jeff Potter done in 2008 found that Minnesota was the second most agreeable and fifth most extraverted state in the nation, traits associated with &quot;nice&quot;.

The tradition of social progressivism in Minnesota politics has been linked to the Minnesota Nice culture. Tim Walz, Governor of Minnesota and the Democratic vice presidential nominee in the 2024 United States presidential election, has been described this way, along with other Minnesotan politicians such as Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, Paul Wellstone, and Amy Klobuchar.

Since the 1960s and 1970s and continuing into the present, Minnesota has been a leading state in refugee resettlement, which can be linked to the traditions of progressivism and generosity associated with Minnesota nice. Various groups, especially Hmong from Laos and Somalis, as well as large numbers of Vietnamese, Burmese, Ethiopians, Laotians, Tibetans, and Liberians, have found homes in the state, particularly in the Twin Cities. Since 2002, Minnesota has harbored the largest population of Somalis in North America.

Minnesota nice was an influence on the Coen brothers movie &quot;Fargo&quot;, set in both Minnesota and neighboring North Dakota. A 2003 documentary about the making of the movie was entitled &quot;Minnesota Nice&quot;.

== Criticism ==

History professor Annette Atkins suggests that the concept is a marketing myth, emerging from the work of Howard Mohr and Garrison Keillor in the 1980s. These authors may have created the myth in order to make Minnesota distinctive from neighboring states like Iowa.

Journalist and Minnesota native Michele Norris argued the phrase had acquired &quot;undertones of irony and despair&quot; following the 2020 murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

<text>The Riverina ()
is an agricultural region of south-western New South Wales, Australia. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia. Bordered on the south by the state of Victoria and on the east by the Great Dividing Range, the Riverina covers those areas of New South Wales in the Murray and Murrumbidgee drainage zones to their confluence in the west.

Home to Aboriginal groups including the Wiradjuri people for over 40,000 years, the Riverina was colonised by Europeans in the mid-19th century as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys has led to the introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.

Major population and service centres in the Riverina include the cities of Wagga Wagga, Leeton, Griffith and Albury. Wagga Wagga is home to a campus of Charles Sturt University and two major Australian Defence Force establishments. La Trobe University has a campus in Albury–Wodonga, located just across the state border in Wodonga, Victoria.

== Geography ==
=== Government agencies and other bodies ===
The delineation of the Riverina region varies by government agency or body. Common official boundaries include the Australian Bureau of Statistics&#x27; Statistical Area Level 4 Riverina region, Australian Electoral Commission&#x27;s Federal Election Boundary called Riverina, Natural Resource Management Regions Riverina region, Regional Development Australia&#x27;s Riverina region and Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia&#x27;s Riverina region.

=== Common usage ===
In common usage the Riverina generally comprises the agricultural and pastoral areas of New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range and in the drainage basin of the snow-fed Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. The northern boundary beyond the Riverina is determined by the Lachlan River catchment area and is referred to as the Central West. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina borders the state of Victoria. West of the confluence of the Murray and Murrumbidgee is the beginning of the more arid Far West region.

In general, the Riverina is an alluvial plain formed by deposition carried from the Great Dividing Range by streams between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago. The terrain includes rolling hills to the east but then becomes flatter to the west with most of that plain reaching less than above sea level. The western Riverina consists largely of featureless saltbush plain.

=== Landform and hydrology ===

The geology of the Riverina comprises several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina is presumed to be a continuation of the Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more saline grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more saline.

The Riverina is drained by the large Murray-Darling Basin. Rivers and streams in the Riverina generally flow east to west. As well as the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, other streams include Billabong Creek and the Edward River, an anabranch of the Murray. Much of the water carried by these streams is diverted. In 2001–2002, 52% of the Murray and Murrumbidgee water runoff was diverted, 77% of which was used for irrigation.

=== Climate ===
The Bureau of Meteorology classifies the Riverina in the &quot;Hot Dry Zone (with cooler winters)&quot; climatic zone. Places in this zone can be very hot in the summer months while in the winter, nights can be considerably cold with cool to mild days. Mean daily maximum temperatures in the Riverina range from in January and in July in Wagga Wagga to in January and in July in Hillston. Under the Köppen climate classification, the region predominantly falls in the hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) zone, although areas in the southwest of the region would feature the semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;) climate and those in the east would have a humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) climate, though still with Mediterranean climate tendencies when it comes to the rainfall pattern.

Rainfall levels in the Riverina are generally low with the median annual rainfall over most of the region between , rising to between on the eastern fringe. Because the region is situated on the upwind side of the Great Dividing Range, winter would receive the most rainfall in the year, with areas in the southern Riverina (around Albury), having the wettest winters, while in the north rainfall patterns are fairly consistent throughout the year. Corowa, in the south eastern Riverina has an average rainfall of per year while mean annual rainfall at Hay is . Drought in 2006 saw the lowest ever recorded rainfall in towns such as Lockhart, Tarcutta and Narrandera.

Despite the very low elevation compared to other regions of the state known for colder winters, snow has been recorded on multiple occasions in Albury and Wagga Wagga, and on 24 July 1936 a flurry of snow was reported in Hay, which at just above sea level would make it the lowest altitude that snow has ever been observed to in New South Wales. In Narrandera it last snowed in June 1908, July 1901 and August 1899. The most recent occurrence of snow in the Riverina proper was at Junee in August 2019 – excluding the mountainous parts of the South West Slopes.

=== Riverina bioregion ===

One method of classification of boundaries for the Riverina is the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia that defines the bioregion as an area comprising , with biogeographic sub-regions covering each of the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, Murray Fans, Victorian Riverina, Robinvale Plains and Murray Scroll Belt.

The NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service has divided New South Wales into 17 distinct bioregions. Bioregions are quite large areas of land that capture a geophysical pattern which is linked to fauna and flora ecosystems. The Riverina bioregion is an area of land that comprises part of the larger Riverina area but also extends into Victoria. It has been defined by the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service as extending from Ivanhoe in the Murray Darling Depression Bioregion south to Bendigo, and from Narrandera in the east to Balranald in the west. 74.03% of the bioregion is in New South Wales, the remainder in Victoria.

In another mapping the World Wildlife Fund has made this area part of the larger Southeast Australia temperate savanna ecoregion that covers the western plains of New South Wales.

River channels in the region support River Red Gum (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;) and River Cooba (&quot;Acacia stenophylla&quot;) communities. Nearby higher areas contain Black Box (&quot;Eucalyptus largiflorens&quot;) woodlands and a salt-tolerant grass, saltbush and daisy understorey. Yellow Box (&quot;Eucalyptus melliodora&quot;) and Grey Box (&quot;Eucalyptus microcarpa&quot;) occur along with Cypress Pine (&quot;Callitris glaucophylla&quot;) on areas rarely subjected to flooding. The area away from the rivers often consists of treeless plains, consisting of various saltbush (&quot;Atriplex&quot;) species, Cotton Bush (&quot;Maireana aphylla&quot;) and varieties of &quot;Danthonia&quot; and &quot;Austrostipa&quot; native grasslands.

Significant mammals endemic to forests in the bioregion include various species of glider, such as Sugar Gliders (&quot;Petaurus breviceps&quot;), Feathertail Gliders (&quot;Acrobates pygmaeus&quot;) and Squirrel Gliders (&quot;Petaurus norfolcensis&quot;) as well as Koalas (&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;) A wide variety of birdlife makes its home in wetlands in the Riverina, including many migratory species. Competition from introduced species and the effect of clearing, grazing and pasture improvement has led to a decline in the diversity of native flora and fauna in the area.

== History ==
Aboriginal people are thought to have inhabited the Riverina for at least 40,000 years. The Wiradjuri people were the original inhabitants of much of south western New South Wales including much of the Riverina region along the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers. Other groups living along the Murrumbidgee included the Nari-Nari on the western plains where the town of Hay, the Muthi-Muthi along the Lowbidgee, Gurendji and the Yida-Yida of Oxley. Along both sides of the Murray River lived the Yorta Yorta people inhabiting the area of the Riverina as far east as the present day city of Albury and as far north as the Finley and Deniliquin districts. The Murray was also home to other groups such as the Bangerang, Baraba-Baraba, Wemba-Wemba, Wadi-Wadi, Dadi-Dadi and Paarkantji communities.

The rivers played a leading role in the lifestyle of the Aboriginal people, acting as a source of food and a means of communication and trade. Murray cod and shellfish were gathered for food and bark canoes were used for travel along the rivers. Scars on many trees alongside the rivers are evidence of this extensive use of canoes. In the summer it is likely that the Bangerang and Wiradjuri joined the Monaro groups in the Bogong moth feasts in the alpine country to the east.

=== Exploration and pastoral settlement ===
The first European explorer in the Riverina was John Oxley in 1817 following the Lachlan River to what is now the town of Booligal. Oxley was followed by Charles Sturt, who followed the Murrumbidgee downstream to Lake Alexandrina in South Australia between 1828 and 1831 and Major Thomas Mitchell in 1836 on his way to the Wimmera and the Western District.

Pastoral settlement followed soon after, with grazing runs established along the Murray and Murrumbidgee as far west as Hay by 1839. At the time, the area was known as the Murrumbidgee District. &quot;Cocketgedong&quot; Station, between Jerilderie and Urana, was established in the 1840s by Messrs Brock &amp; Hardie. A map, dated 1864, held by the State Library of Victoria shows them still in possession. At that time, there was little fencing and the sheep were brought back to camps each night by the shepherds. The camps named on the map include Stockyard Camp, Mick&#x27;s Hill Camp, Columba Camp, The Gums Camp, Coonong Camp, and Sydney Gate Camp. Messrs Watt &amp; Thomson, the owners of an adjoining property, &quot;North Urana&quot;, subsequently purchased &quot;Cocketgedong&quot; from Brock &amp; Hardie, giving them a total area of approximately 65,000 acres. In 1904 D &amp; W Gibb, Wool Brokers in Melbourne, purchased &quot;Cocketgedong&quot; which comprised 45,000 acres freehold and approximately 20,000 acres Crown Leasehold. After World War I, the leasehold was resumed for Soldier Settlement blocks, leaving &quot;Cocketgedong&quot; with 36,000 acres and &quot;North Urana&quot; 9000 acres divided by several holdings. The latter part was sold in the early 1950s, leaving the approximate area originally taken up by Brock &amp; Hardie, held by the D &amp; W Gibb Estate. The Woolshed constructed in 1910 consisted of 20 stands, although by 1970 when it was demolished after a new Woolshed was constructed, only 10 stands were being used. The Estate of D &amp; W Gibb sold &quot;Cocketgedong in 1972. Moulamein, in the western Riverina, appears to make legitimate claims as the oldest town in the Riverina, and indeed to being older than Melbourne. The settlers often came into conflict with the indigenous inhabitants. In the Narrandera district, a battle took place between settlers and the local Narrungderra clan at a location now known as Massacre Island, reportedly leaving only one survivor.

Cattle raising was the major industry in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners taking part in the Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.
In the 1860s and 1870s, German settlers from the Barossa Valley travelled upstream to settle in the eastern Riverina. Because of their religious distinctiveness as Lutherans, they preferred to form clustered German settlements. In 1867 and 1868 several land parcels were taken up in the Jindera area. 56 German farmers, in 1869, took six weeks to travel six hundred miles in covered wagons to establish the town of Walla Walla.
Nearby Holbrook was originally named Germantown after these settlers until changing its name in 1914 as a result of tensions caused by World War I.

The name &quot;Riverine&quot;, coined from the Entre Ríos Province (between two rivers) in Argentina, South America, was in use as early as 1857: a long letter under the caption &quot;Riverine Colony&quot; appeared in the Albury &quot;Border Post&quot; of 24 January that year. The name was coined by Dunmore Lang who translated it from the Spanish.

Dunmore Lang was also involved with the short-lived Riverina secession movement which was active in the 1860s. The movement was inspired by the success of the Victorian and Queensland secession movements and motivated by a desire to draw more public funds to the region and maintain the favourable land tenure the &quot;squatter&quot; pastoralists enjoyed. With the movement strongest in Deniliquin and Albury, Dunmore Lang, squatter and parliamentarian Gideon Lang (unrelated) and other influential pastoralists joined with local newspaper editors, George Mott and David Jones in the campaign. This culminated in presenting petitions to the Governor of New South Wales, Sir John Young and the Colonial Secretary, Edward Cardwell. Soon after the movement fell apart due to the differences between the squatters on one side and the small farmers and townspeople on the other causing its objectives to become obscured by other associated issues such as inter-colonial tariffs and rail links.

=== Riverboats and railways ===
From 1853, the Riverina was linked to markets through a series of riverboats along the Murray and Murrumbidgee to the river ports of Mannum and Goolwa in South Australia and from 1864, to Echuca connected by rail to Melbourne. Riverboats reached as far upstream as Gundagai and Albury and towns such as Darlington Point, Narrandera and Moulamein became important river ports. The riverboat era peaked in the twenty years from 1870 to 1890, declining with the coming of the railway and finally ending with the disruption to the workforce caused by World War I.

From Melbourne, broad gauge railway lines opened to Deniliquin in 1876 and west to Moulamein and Balranald in 1926. The Moulamein–Balranald section closed in the 1980s. The North East line reached Wodonga in 1873, and was connected to Albury at a break-of-gauge in 1883, and the Melbourne-Shepparton line was extended to Tocumwal in 1908.

The number of cross border railways expanded with the passing of the 1922 Border Railways Act, with the Benalla – Yarrawonga branch line extended to Oaklands in 1938, both lines meeting standard gauge lines that were subsequently closed. Victorian Railways commenced construction of a railway from Robinvale to Koorakee and Lette in New South Wales in 1924 (the Lette railway line), but this railway was never completed. The Murray River bridge between Robinvale and Euston was instead converted to a road bridge, which will be demolished when the new road bridge currently under construction is completed. The Stony Crossing railway line was built from Kerang to Murrabit in 1924 and Stony Crossing (originally called Poonboon) in 1928 under an agreement with New South Wales. No passenger services were carried on the section beyond Murrabit after 1932 and it was closed about 1943.
Standard gauge rail services from Sydney came with the extension of the Main Southern line to Cootamundra and Junee in 1878 and the construction of the Murrumbidgee River Railway Bridge in 1881 allowed the line to be extended past Wagga Wagga to Henty and Albury later that year. A branch line was constructed to Temora in 1893 and extended to Barellan in 1908, Griffith in 1916 and Hillston in 1923. Further south, a branch line was completed from Junee to Narrandera in 1881 and extended to Hay by 1882. Another branch pushed south from Narrandera toward the Victorian border reaching Jerilderie in 1884 and the Murray at Tocumwal in 1898.

=== Bushrangers ===
Transport links assisted the development of the Riverina economy, at the same time areas of the region found themselves under threat from robbery and murder by various bushrangers. Between 1862 and 1865, the eastern Riverina between Wagga Wagga and Albury saw the depredations of Dan &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Morgan. Having previously been convicted of armed robbery, Morgan came to the attention to authorities in the Riverina when he bailed up a police magistrate, Henry Baylis, near Urana in 1863. In 1864, Morgan bailed up Round Hill station, a large sheep farm near Morven, killing a station hand. Later that year, the bushranger shot dead a policeman in cold blood near Tumbarumba. The reward placed on his head reached £1,000 before, in April 1865, he was shot dead near Wangaratta, Victoria.
The infamous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly, made possibly his most daring raid in the Riverina, at Jerilderie in 1879. After riding overland from north east Victoria, Kelly and his gang in a brazen move captured two local policemen and stole their uniforms. Impersonating the police, they then proceeded to rob the Bank of New South Wales and held the town captive for several days. While in Jerilderie, he sought to have his manifesto published, the famous Jerilderie letter, a rambling 8,000-word condemnation of the colonial administration in Victoria and specifically the treatment of the Irish. Being unable to find the local newspaper editor, he left the letter with a member of the bank staff and returned to Victoria £2,000 richer.

=== Riverina and federation ===

The close geographic and cultural ties between the Riverina and northern Victoria, combined with continuing frustration with inter colonial tariffs, made the Riverina a fertile area for ideas for uniting the various colonies in an Australian federation. This would see the southern Riverina in particular take a leading role in bringing about federation.

Prior to federation, the various Australian colonies could, and often did, charge tariffs on goods from the other colonies, ostensibly for the protection of their domestic manufacturing industries, mainly based in the larger cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. For a border community such as the southern Riverina, these tariffs were a sore burden, making goods purchased from Melbourne, the closest large city, more expensive and reducing the competitiveness of these towns supplying the Melbourne and Adelaide markets. In addition, crossing the border on the Murray River was a tiresome experience as each border crossing had customs posts inspecting goods and luggage to ensure all duty was paid and to reduce smuggling, a popular activity. Another item of concern was the lack of adequate river crossings. Along the Riverina the Murray was—and remains—part of New South Wales, who had no interest in assisting border residents to access goods and services in Victoria that may otherwise have been sourced from Sydney.

In the early 1890s, for mainly patriotic reasons, the Australian Natives&#x27; Association helped establish the Federation League, a society dedicated to the creation of a federal nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border. One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures to pass an act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on 1 January 1901.

=== Irrigation and closer settlement ===
Large scale irrigation commenced with the establishment of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) in 1912 which diverted water from the Murrumbidgee River near Narrandera. The River Murray Waters Agreement of 1915 allowed 26 weirs to be constructed with locks to provide permanent riverboat access to Echuca. When riverboat transport was no longer significant, the weirs supported irrigation. Irrigation in the region continued to develop with the construction of the Hume Dam between 1919 and 1931, the Burrinjuck Dam built in 1928 and Blowering Dam built in 1968.

Development and promotion of the MIA led to large scale settlement on land described by Oxley 100 years earlier as &quot;country which, for barrenness and desolation, can I think, have no equal.&quot; Settlers came from a diverse range of backgrounds and nationalities. In particular, the Italian community prospered in the Area, owning nearly half of all the farms around Griffith by 1954.
Later, further irrigation was developed for areas in the Murray valley starting with the Wakool Irrigation District in 1932, then the Deniboota and Denimein Irrigation Districts in 1938, the Berriquin Irrigation District in 1939 and the Tullakool Irrigation Area in 1942. The Coleambally Irrigation Area, established in 1968, was the last of the major government-sponsored irrigation developments in New South Wales.

== Agriculture ==
The high soil fertility and abundance of water in the Riverina floodplain has made the Riverina region one of the most productive farming regions in Australia with rice, wheat, maize, canola, citrus and wine grapes being grown in the area. The Riverina contains many irrigation schemes including the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. are under irrigation in the region.

For the first few decades following the 1830s, European pastoral activity focused in the main on cattle production but by the 1860s sheep were the predominant stock.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the region&#x27;s agricultural and horticultural production was worth more than A$1 billion. The region produces:
* over 25% of the state&#x27;s fruit and vegetables
* 90% of NSW citrus products
* 80% of NSW wine/grape production
* livestock feedlots, sales and processing facilities
* nearly 20% of all NSW crop production and two-thirds of its total value.

In 1991–92 sheep and lamb numbers in the region were close to seven million and there were 500,000 meat cattle.
The Riverina is also a significant almond growing region.

=== Wool ===
Much of the dryland areas of the Riverina contain large sheep stations, producing medium class wool. The Peppin Merino sheep was first bred in the area around Wanganella. As many as 70 percent of today&#x27;s Australian Merinos are said to be directly descended from the Peppin-developed sheep. The Riverina is home to many Merino studs and the saltbush plains are regarded as one of Australia&#x27;s best wool growing regions.

=== Rice ===
The Riverina produces the vast majority of rice grown in Australia, particularly in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA), but also around the Finley, Coleambally and Deniliquin areas. The first commercial rice crops in the Riverina were grown in the Leeton and Yanco district in 1924, expanding to Wakool during World War II, the Denimein and Deniboota Irrigation Areas in the 1950s and Coleambally and Finley in the 1960s. In recent years, rice is also grown in the Hay, Carrathool and Hillston areas.

Historically, well over one million tonnes of Australian rice has been produced each year and exported to over 70 countries, generating A$500 million in export income and supporting 63 towns in the Riverina and northern Victoria. More recently, drought has drastically reduced this quantity to less than 30,000 tonnes with resultant economic effects. Recent rains however will see this volume increase. The headquarters of Ricegrowers Limited, who trade under the SunRice name, is located in Leeton, Australia&#x27;s rice capital. Major rice mills are located in Leeton, Coleambally and the largest rice mill in the southern hemisphere in Deniliquin.

=== Wine ===
The area generally known as &quot;the Riverina&quot; is broader than the area legally defined as the Riverina wine region Australian Geographical Indication (AGI) as registered in the Register of Protected GIs. The Riverina GI is centred on Griffith and is roughly circular with towns on the boundary including Mossgiel, Condobolin, Temora, Junee, Culcairn, Berrigan, Finley, Deniliquin and Moulamein. It does not extend as far south as the Murray River.

The Riverina region is one of the most prosperous grape growing regions in Australia (particularly in Griffith), along with the Barossa Valley in South Australia. The region grows 55% of wine grapes in New South Wales and 15% of the total grape production within Australia and 80% of wine/grape production of New South Wales; the region is Australia&#x27;s largest producer of wine. Over 50% of the Riverina&#x27;s wine production is exported. As a producer of specialist wine grapes, its wine style of international importance is Botrytised Semillon and the outstanding speciality made from these grapes is a &quot;sauternes-style&quot; dessert wine.

Irrigation made it possible to grow grapes for wine. The first grapes were planted at Hanwood in the spring of 1913 by John McWilliam and his eldest son Jack who had come to the district from their winery in Junee. Irrigation was by carting of water until the irrigation channels were opened a few months later. The first grapes were picked in 1916 and sent to Junee for processing. Penfolds established its winery in the region in 1919.

== Cities, towns and settlements ==

At the 2016 census, the population of the Riverina (ABS SA4 Region) was 155,934, 5.4% of whom were indigenous and 18.4% born outside Australia. In common usage the Riverina often includes parts of the Murray SA4 region, as of 2016 the population of Murray was 115,803, 3.4% of the population were indigenous and 17.7% were born outside of Australia.

The Riverina includes two cities; Wagga Wagga and Griffith. Other large towns include Leeton, Finley, Deniliquin, Cootamundra, West Wyalong, Narrandera, Junee and Temora. Wagga Wagga is the largest inland city in New South Wales with an estimated resident population of 56,675 people in 2019 and serves as an important employment, educational, cultural, social and entertainment centre for surrounding towns throughout the Riverina. Wagga Wagga&#x27;s facilities are of metropolitan standards with shopping, cafes, recreational facilities and nightlife present within the city. The two largest centres in population in the region after Wagga Wagga are Griffith and Leeton and they provide advanced services to the outlying farming regions.

Parts of the Riverina experienced substantial population growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s; in the five-year period between 1996 and 2001, Griffith&#x27;s population increased by 10.8%. Until recently Wagga Wagga&#x27;s population was declining slowly and ageing with strong growth in age groups 40 and over. This has now changed and Wagga Wagga has become one of Australia&#x27;s leading examples of the &quot;sponge&quot; city phenomenon, attracting residents from smaller towns in the Riverina such as Urana. In the year ended 30 June 2006, the population of Wagga Wagga grew by 1.3%, driven by its role as the regional centre for the Riverina and its hosting of a campus of Charles Sturt University and Australian Defence Force bases.

The Local Government Area of Temora experienced a population decline in the early 2000s, dropping from 6288 people in 2001 to a low of 5936 in 2009. Since then the LGA has grown steadily. As of 2019 the estimated resident population of Temora has now expanded to 6307 people.

== Politics ==
The Riverina is politically conservative and leans towards the National Party on both the federal and state level.

The Riverina is represented at the federal level in two divisions of the Australian House of Representatives, the Division of Riverina, covering the Murrumbidgee valley; and the Division of Farrer, the area along the Murray River. As of the 2019 Federal Election, Riverina is held by the National Party and Farrer by the Liberal Party, who, in coalition, are the governing parties. At the state level, the electoral districts of Albury, Cootamundra, Murray and Wagga Wagga cover the Riverina region.

There are a range of local government authorities in the region, ranging from the cities of Wagga Wagga and Griffith; to the municipalities of Edward River, Federation, Cootamundra-Gundagai, Murray River, Murrumbidgee and Snowy Valleys; and the shires of Balranald, Berrigan, Carrathool, Coolamon, Greater Hume, Hay, Junee, Leeton, Lockhart, Narrandera, Bland and Temora. These councils are arranged into Regional Organisations of Councils (ROC)s: Riverina and Murray ROC and Riverina Eastern ROC.

== Health ==
In 2015, 33.1% of the region&#x27;s population was obese, somewhat higher than the national average.

== Facilities and services ==
Higher education in the Riverina is provided by Charles Sturt University (CSU), with campuses serving the Riverina in Albury and Wagga Wagga. The university was established in 1989 with the amalgamation of the Albury and Wagga Wagga campuses of the Riverina-Murray Institute of Higher Education with the Mitchell College of Advanced Education in Bathurst. CSU provides specialist services to the Riverina in areas such as viticulture and winemaking.

Other educational facilities in the region include TAFE NSW, providing technical and vocational training at a number of campuses throughout the region including in West Wyalong, Cootamundra, Griffith, Hay, Leeton, Narrandera, Tumut, Temora, and Wagga Wagga. Most larger centres have public high schools and most smaller centres are serviced by a public primary school.

The health service in the Riverina is administered by Murrumbidgee Local Health District. Base Hospitals are located at Albury, Wagga Wagga and Griffith while Deniliquin, Hillston, Henty and Narrandera among others are home to regional hospitals.
Situated between the large cities of Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, the Riverina is a transportation hub. Major transportation links in the region include the Hume Highway, Newell Highway and Sturt Highway; all part of the Australian National Highway. Other highways include the Riverina Highway, Cobb Highway, Olympic Highway, Kidman Way, Irrigation Way and Burley Griffin Way.

NSW TrainLink rail services from Sydney to Griffith and Melbourne serve the Riverina with connecting buses reaching smaller communities. V/Line provide services linking Griffith, Deniliquin and the towns along the Murray with public transport access to Melbourne.

The Riverina is host to two major Australian Defence Force training facilities. The Army Recruit Training Centre is located at Kapooka, south west of Wagga Wagga and RAAF Base Wagga is the home of the RAAF Ground Training Wing base. These bases along with a Royal Australian Navy Defence Communications Station play an integral role in the local economy.

== Sports ==
The Riverina is well known for the quality and range of its sports activity and many famous sportsmen and women have hailed from the Riverina. These include:
* Tennis champions Margaret Court and Evonne Goolagong Cawley
* Cricketers Mark Taylor, Geoff Lawson and Michael Slater
* Rugby league players Peter Sterling and Laurie Daley and the Mortimer brothers: Chris Mortimer, Peter Mortimer and Steve Mortimer
* Australian rules footballers Haydn Bunton Senior, Paul Kelly, Brett Kirk, Shane Crawford, Wayne Carey 
* Soccer players Archie Thompson and Joshua Kennedy.
* Jockeys Arthur &quot;Scobie&quot; Breasley and Roy Higgins.
* Basketball great Lauren Jackson.

The &quot;Wagga Effect&quot; is a term that has been used frequently in the Australian media to describe the disproportionately large number of elite sportsmen and women that originate from the town. It is speculated that the phenomenon may arise in rural areas where the population is large enough to sustain the presence of a large number of sporting codes, but small enough to ensure that talented individuals are exposed to adult-level competition at an earlier age.
Unusually for New South Wales, Australian rules football is quite popular in the Southern Riverina as it is south of the Barassi Line, and there are many clubs and leagues in the district, including the Riverina Football League, Farrer Football League, Hume Football League, Northern Riverina Football League and Coreen &amp; District Football League. In addition, many clubs along the border play in Victorian leagues such as the Ovens &amp; Murray Football League, Murray Football League, Picola &amp; District Football League and the Golden Rivers Football League.

In the northern part of the Riverina, Rugby league and Rugby Union are both strong, with rugby league being the most popular sport. Rugby League competitions in the district include Group 9 (Wagga Wagga and districts), Group 17 (Hillston and districts) and Group 20 (Griffith and districts). Teams from Corowa and Albury play in the Goulburn Murray Rugby League. Rugby Union in the district is run by the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union, with clubs from Albury, Wagga Wagga, Cootamundra, Temora and Hay as well as many others competing in the Southern Inland Rugby Union.

Other popular sports in the Riverina include cycling, bowls, cricket, netball, tennis and horse racing. The Riverina is home to many racecourses and picnic race meetings are held regularly at places such as Corowa, Berrigan, Carrathool, Tumut and Lockhart.

== Culture ==

The Riverina was the setting for some of Australia&#x27;s great artistic and literary works of the 19th and early 20th century. Most of these works reflected the rural lifestyle and agricultural pursuits common in the Riverina at that time and projected an image of Australia and Australians that would later change rapidly.

The writer Joseph Furphy worked as a bullocky for 10 years in the area around Hay from 1872. Later, using the pen name Tom Collins, Furphy wrote &quot;Such Is Life&quot; set in the Riverina during the drought and depression of the 1890s and drawing on his experiences as a bullocky. Although a slow seller, the novel was described as &quot;fitted to become an Australian classic&quot; by A.G. Stephens, the literary critic of The Bulletin.

Published in 1921, &quot;Around the Boree Log and Other Verses&quot; was written by Patrick Joseph Hartigan, under the pen name John O&#x27;Brien. A Roman Catholic priest, after early stints at Thurgoona and Berrigan, in 1917 Hartigan was appointed as the parish priest of Narrandera where he stayed until 1944. His poems recorded the everyday lives and mateship of the people of the Riverina. His friend and well-known poet C. J. Dennis hailed them in The Bulletin as in &#x27;the direct Lawson-Paterson line mainly—unaffected talk about Australians, much as they would naturally talk about themselves&#x27;. &quot;Around the Boree Log&quot; ran to five editions and 18,000 copies by 1926.

The artist and key member of the Heidelberg School, Tom Roberts spent some time on a sheep station near Brocklesby prior to and during the painting of his most celebrated artwork, &quot;Shearing the Rams&quot;. The painting was criticised in its time for the depiction of strong manual labour rather than the common &quot;high art&quot; themes of the day. It is seen now as reflecting Australia&#x27;s largest industry at the time and the work of ordinary Australians. The painting is now in the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria.
&quot;Scots of the Riverina&quot;, a poem written by one of Australia&#x27;s most renowned writers, Henry Lawson, is set in Gundagai. The poem describes a father&#x27;s anger at his son&#x27;s desertion at harvest time and later his grief when the son dies in battle in World War I. &quot;Hay and Hell and Booligal&quot;, written by Banjo Paterson, is a humorous take on life on the flat western Riverina plan.

Today, major cultural institutions in the Riverina include the Museum of the Riverina, the Riverina Theatre Company and the Wagga Wagga Art Gallery, all located in the regional centre of Wagga Wagga with outreach to the smaller towns. Many regional towns including Hay, Deniliquin and Gundagai house museums of significant regional interest. The HotHouse Theatre group, based in Albury takes live theatre to small towns throughout the Riverina. The tiny town of Morundah holds an annual night at the opera, hosting performances by OzOpera and the Victorian Opera. Popular music groups from the Riverina include one of Australia&#x27;s most distinctive and popular bands of the &#x27;90s and 2000s, Spiderbait who come from the southern Riverina town of Finley. The Riverina is currently home to two major regional LQBTQIA+ festivals, the Hay Mardi Gras established in 2018 and the Wagga Mardi Gras established in 2019.

<text>George IV&#x27;s visit to Scotland in 1822 was the first visit of a reigning monarch to Scotland in nearly two centuries, the last being by Charles II for his Scottish coronation in 1651. Government ministers had pressed the King to bring forward a proposed visit to Scotland, to divert him from diplomatic intrigue at the Congress of Verona.

The visit increased the king&#x27;s popularity in Scotland, turning some subjects away from the rebellious radicalism of the time. However, it was Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s organisation of the visit, with the inclusion of tartan pageantry, that was to have a lasting influence, by elevating the tartan kilt to become part of Scotland&#x27;s national identity.

==Background==
After nearly a decade of ruling as prince regent, George IV acceded to the throne and his coronation on 19 July 1821, was celebrated by splendid pageantry, much of it invented for the occasion. He was obese and was widely unpopular, with many offended by his treatment of his wife, Caroline of Brunswick. He had also been struggling to manipulate the government, which was seen as a corrupt oligarchy by Radicals whose increasing unrest following the revolutions which shook America and France culminated in the &quot;Radical War&quot; of 1820 in Scotland and terrified the gentry. He was invited to attend the Congress of Verona, but government ministers wanting to keep Parliamentary control of foreign affairs pressed him to bring forward a proposed visit to Scotland which it was hoped would calm unrest. Suffering from painful illness and pushed by opposing factions of diplomats and ministers, the King remained indecisive, but preparations went ahead in the hope of his agreement.

Walter Scott was the author of the novel &quot;Waverley&quot; which popularised a romantic image of the Scottish Highlands. In 1815 this led to his being invited to dine with George, who was then the Prince Regent. By 1822 Scott had become a baronet, and was well acquainted with both Highland and Lowland nobility.

Kilts and tartans were used for army uniforms but were no longer ordinary Highland wear, having been proscribed in the wake of the Jacobite Risings by the Dress Act. The &quot;small&quot; kilt as worn today was a relatively recent innovation in the Highlands, having been introduced around the 1720s and later adopted as dress uniform by the army, but the romance of the &quot;ancient&quot; belted plaid still appealed to those wanting to preserve the Highland identity. Soon after the Act&#x27;s repeal in 1782, Highland aristocrats set up Highland Societies in Edinburgh and other centres including London and Aberdeen. These were landowners&#x27; clubs with aims including &quot;Improvements&quot; (the Highland Clearances) and promoting &quot;the general use of the ancient Highland dress&quot; by obliging members to wear this when attending meetings. Numerous less exclusive associations including the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, of which Scott was enthusiastic chairman, had membership including many lowlanders as well as chieftains of impeccable Highland ancestry, and also promoted a Highland culture with all attending meetings and dances wearing &quot;the garb of old Gaul&quot;.

==Preparations==

When his advice was sought, Sir Walter Scott seized the opportunity to invent a splendid pageant wherein ancient Scotland would be reborn, and the king parodied in cartoons as a fat debaucher would be seen as &quot;a portly handsome man looking and moving every inch a King&quot;. George would be presented as a new Jacobite king, with the logic that he was by bloodline as much a Stuart as Bonnie Prince Charlie had been, and would win the affections of the Scots away from radical reform. A small committee was set up, with Scott&#x27;s principal assistant being his friend Major General David Stewart of Garth who had made himself the undisputed authority on Highlanders with his &quot;Sketches&quot;.

George had been persuaded by Scott that he was not only a Stuart prince, but also a Jacobite Highlander, and could rightly and properly swathe himself in &quot;the Garb of Old Gaul [sic]&quot;, so in July 1822 the King placed his order with George Hunter &amp; Co., outfitters of Tokenhouse Yard, London and Princes Street, Edinburgh, for £1,354 18s (a sum equivalent to £ today) worth of highland outfit in bright red Royal Tartan, later known as Royal Stuart, complete with gold chains and assorted weaponry including dirk, sword and pistols.

Scott brought the Highland societies and the Clan chieftains into arranging for a plaided pageantry. Garth now drilled the younger members of the Celtic Society into four companies as honour guards. Their mix of lowlanders and highlanders had already offended Alexander Ranaldson MacDonell of Glengarry, who was quick to demand that his Society of True Highlanders be given precedence, but his attempts to take over were generally disregarded. Some chieftains took the event as a chance to show impressive forces and thus disprove allegations about the Highland Clearances, but the decimation of their tenantry rather undermined this. James Loch acting for the 19th Countess of Sutherland solved the problem of finding kilts by borrowing army uniforms from the Sutherland Highlanders.

For the management of all events, Scott took the advice of his friend the young actor-manager William Henry Murray whose talents at theatrical scenery and costume were put to good use in creating the settings and the &quot;revived ancient dresses&quot; for the pageants he arranged. Holyrood Palace had to be readied for state occasions, but was not in fit condition as a royal residence and arrangements were made for the king to stay at Dalkeith House, 7 miles (11 km) from Edinburgh.

There was widespread concern about procedure and etiquette, not least amongst the touchy Highland chiefs (notably Glengarry), which Scott met by producing a shilling booklet entitled &quot;HINTS addressed to the INHABITANTS OF EDINBURGH AND OTHERS in prospect of HIS MAJESTY&#x27;S VISIT. By an old citizen&quot;, which gave an outline of planned events with detailed advice on behaviour and clothing. All gentlemen of the city were expected to attend public appearances in a uniform blue coat, white waistcoat and white or nankeen (yellowish) cotton trousers, and a low-crowned dark hat decorated with a cockade in the form a white St. Andrew&#x27;s saltire on a blue background. Similarly detailed guidance was given for those fortunate enough to attend functions or levees, with gentlemen to wear a full dress suit, as well as a description of the dress of the Highland chiefs and their &quot;tail&quot; of followers who were expected to &quot;add greatly to the variety, gracefulness and appropriate splendour of the scene&quot;.

The exception was the &quot;Grand Ball&quot; held by the peers of Scotland to entertain the king: Scott&#x27;s &quot;Hints&quot; called this a &quot;Highland Ball&quot;, reminded readers that the king had ordered a kilt and set the condition that, unless in uniform, &quot;no Gentleman is to be allowed to appear in any thing but the ancient Highland costume&quot;. At this, lowland gentlemen suddenly embarked on a desperate search for Highland ancestry (however remote) and a suitable tartan kilt from the Edinburgh tailors, who responded inventively. This can be seen as the pivotal event when what had been thought of as the primitive dress of mountain thieves became the national dress of the whole of Scotland.

According to some sources, the catering contract was won by Ebenezer Scroggie, who would become the posthumous inspiration for Charles Dickens&#x27; character Ebenezer Scrooge in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. However, there is no evidence that Ebenezer Scroggie ever existed, and the story might be part of a &quot;probable Dickens hoax&quot;.

==The visit==
The first of Scott&#x27;s pageants took place on the King&#x27;s 60th birthday, on Monday 12 August 1822. In procession, the Midlothian Yeomanry and companies of Highlanders escorted coaches carrying the Regalia of Scotland and dignitaries from the Castle to Holyrood Palace. The procession assembled on The Mound before going up to the Castle, and within minutes of setting off was halted by the arrival on horseback of a flamboyantly dressed Glengarry who announced that it was his rightful place to ride at the head of the procession. After a pause, a Captain Ewan MacDougall persuaded the hot-tempered Glengarry to go away. Watched by packed crowds, the procession formally received the regalia then returned down to The Mound and went down it to Princes Street and on by Calton Hill to Holyroodhouse.

The King&#x27;s ship the &quot;Royal George&quot; arrived in the Firth of Forth about noon on Wednesday 14 August, but his landing was postponed due to torrential rain. Despite the rain, Sir Walter Scott was rowed out to see the King, who exclaimed, &quot;What! Sir Walter Scott! The man in Scotland I most wish to see!&quot; After a drink of whisky, Scott presented the King with a jewel designed and embroidered by the ladies of Edinburgh, in the form of a silver St Andrews cross embroidered with pearls on blue velvet with a belt of gold a diamond buckle and magnificent Scottish pearl surmounted by the imperial crown picked out in brilliants, rubies, emeralds and topaz. Inscribed on the cross was &quot;Righ Albainn gu brath&quot; (Long live the King of Scotland).

On Thursday 15 August, the King in naval uniform arrived in sunshine at the quayside of The Shore, Leith and stepped ashore onto a red carpet strewn with flowers to greet the waiting crowds, and the High Constabulary of the Port of Leith (Leith High Constables). After fifteen minutes of the ritual salutations traditional in a royal entry he got in his carriage. A quiet pause was rudely interrupted by Glengarry on horseback galloping up beside the King, sweeping off his bonnet and loudly announcing &quot;Your Majesty is welcome to Scotland!&quot;. The King, in good humour, bowed graciously at this unplanned intrusion as his carriage moved off. A procession including lowland regiments and Highland clan regiments with pipe bands escorted the King&#x27;s open carriage the 3 miles (5 km) up to Edinburgh past cheering Scots crowding every possible viewpoint eager to show a welcome to their monarch. At a theatrical &quot;medieval&quot; gateway the King was presented with the keys to the city and &quot;the hearts and persons&quot; of its people.

Much of the pageantry for the visit would be medieval rather than Highland, but the exotic outfits of the &quot;gathering of the Gael&quot; were to attract most attention. The next day was one that the King spent away from the public at Dalkeith. Edinburgh was full of visitors for the occasion, and that evening they walked round enjoying &quot;illuminations&quot; with illustrated tributes hung on public buildings, businesses and houses, &quot;Everywhere crowded to excess, but in civility and quiet&quot;, before being escorted to their rest around midnight by bands of boys carrying flaming torches to light their way.

On Saturday afternoon, 17 August, the King attended a short levee at Holyrood Palace, where the great and good queued to be greeted by George in his Highland outfit complete with pink pantaloons to conceal his bloated legs, described as &quot;buff coloured trowsers like &quot;flesh&quot; to &quot;imitate&quot; his &quot;Royal knees&quot;&quot;. When someone complained that the kilt had been too short for modesty, Lady Hamilton-Dalrymple wittily responded &quot;Since he is to be among us for so short a time, the more we see of him the better.&quot;

The King would not be seen again by the public until Monday afternoon when a medium-sized crowd caught a brief glimpse of him as he went into Holyroodhouse to hear long repetitive addresses from the Church of Scotland, the Scottish Episcopal Church, universities, burghs, counties and &quot;the Highland Society&quot;, and give his short formal responses.

The &quot;King&#x27;s Drawing Room&quot; on Tuesday 20 August was attended by 457 ladies, and custom required that he kiss each one on the cheek. This brief occasion took him away from Dalkeith House for two hours, and the presentation of the ladies lasted from 2.15 to 3.30. In the rush some ladies received no &quot;buss&quot; on the cheek, or in their nervousness scarcely felt the kiss at all. All were dressed in rich gowns with sweeping trains, and most had coloured ostrich plumes above their elaborately curled hair. The King was courteous and smiling, and paid particular attention to &quot;the lady on whose account so many Highlanders went down to Elgin two years ago&quot; when election passions led to Lady Anne Margaret Grant, daughter of the late Sir James Grant, 8th Baronet, and her sisters who had also supported the Tories, being besieged by a &quot;democratic mob&quot; of Whig supporting townsfolk until a rescue party of her clansmen was &quot;summoned by the fiery cross&quot; and released them without coming to blows. The story of &quot;The Raid to Elgin&quot; had amused the king, and he remarked &quot;Truly she is an object fit to raise the chivalry of a clan&quot;, echoing Scott&#x27;s romanticism. He spent the next day at Dalkeith, and that evening Scott dined with him.
Heavy rain returned on Thursday 22 August as a &quot;Grand Procession&quot; went from Holyrood to Edinburgh Castle. The procession and the King&#x27;s closed carriage went up the Royal Mile flanked by colourful bunting and densely packed cheering crowds obscured by their umbrellas. At the castle, the king climbed out onto the battlements of the Half Moon Battery to wave his cocked hat to continuing &quot;huzzas&quot; from the crowd for fifteen minutes, reportedly saying &quot;Good God! What a fine sight. I had no conception there was such a fine scene in the world; and to find it in my own dominions; and the people are as beautiful and as extraordinary as the scene.&quot; and &quot;Rain? I feel no rain. Never mind, I must cheer the people.&quot; He had not been used to this kind of reception.

On Friday, 23 August, a review of 3,000 volunteer cavalrymen was held on Portobello sands. The king was also to honour the Clans including a contingent from the Celtic Society of Edinburgh. Though disappointingly his review ended before reaching them, the Highlanders took part in the &quot;Grand March Past&quot; then were cheered by the crowds as they marched back to Edinburgh. That evening, George appeared at the Peers&#x27; &quot;Grand Ball&quot; wearing a field marshal&#x27;s uniform as earlier in the day rather than the anticipated kilt. The Peers’ Ball was a formal occasion with court dress worn predominantly, though some gentlemen chose either Highland attire or military uniform. The ladies were mostly in white dresses. The Ball started with the anthem as soon as the King entered the Ballroom, followed by a reel and then a country dance. Lady Anne Scott together with her sister Isabel, daughters of the 4th Duke of Buccleuch, &quot;danced the reels famously’’. Another reel was performed at the bottom of the ballroom by a set consisted of two older gentlemen, one of whom was a Highlander, and both &quot;jumped and capered so and made all sorts of such strange antics&quot; which &quot;his Majesty seems to witness with much pleasure.&quot; The music was played by the Assembly Rooms band led by Nathaniel Gow. The performance of the reels gave the King the most delight. More dancing took place in the Second Ballroom where fashionable at the time European dances were performed such as Quadrilles and Waltzes. Contemporaries complained that the Assembly Rooms were too hot and crowded for dancing and described the Ball as being &quot;not in fact a dancing Ball&quot;. The Assembly Rooms had been theatrically transformed by William Henry Murray, and the occasion was hailed as a triumph for him.

Saturday morning was marked by a small ceremony and procession including a Clan MacGregor Regalia Guard, as the Honours of Scotland were returned from Holyroodhouse up the Royal Mile to the Castle. That evening the King attended a tumultuous civic banquet in the great Hall of Parliament House which Murray had splendidly decorated.

Next day the King went in state to the Presbyterian Church of Scotland Sunday service at St. Giles&#x27; Cathedral. On the Monday he made a private visit to the Holyrood Palace apartments of his ancestor Mary, Queen of Scots, then in the evening attended the &quot;Caledonian Hunt Ball&quot; in a Guards uniform. For the Caledonian Hunt Society Ball, the male members of the Society wore specially prepared uniforms. &quot;The dresses of the ladies were more varied and fanciful than at the Peers’ Ball. Blue was much worn; and, as on the previous occasion, there was a great profusion of feathers.&quot; The King arrived about 9:30 pm, entering the Ballroom with something like a candle-lit procession. The King was excited by the reels and strathspeys. Once more his wish was met, that while he was in Scotland all music would be &quot;purely national and characteristic&quot;. The dancing again commenced with a reel; which took place in the circle that surrounded the space in front of the throne. In this space two reels at a time were danced without any stop, all the while the King stayed, which was two hours. Mudie wrote that &quot;the first reel danced was to the air of Brechin Castle. His Majesty was particularly pleased with the second set and clapped his hands in token of his approbation. A number of quadrilles were danced in the second ballroom. About half an hour after his Majesty retired, country dances commenced, which were kept up with great spirit, by the more vigorous of the company, until nearly seven o’clock in the morning.&quot;

On the Tuesday, 27 August, George made his last and least formal public appearance, showing his evident pleasure at a theatre performance of Scott&#x27;s &quot;Rob Roy&quot; adapted and produced by William Henry Murray.

George&#x27;s visit closed on Thursday 29 August with a brief visit to Hopetoun House 12 miles (19 km) west of Edinburgh. Elaborate arrangements had been made and crowds waited for him in the rain. On departing Hopetoun House, The King conferred the honour of knighthood on Captain Adam Ferguson, Deputy keeper of the Scottish regalia, and Henry Raeburn, the selected representative of Scotlands fine arts. He then joined his ship at nearby South Queensferry and departed.

==Outcome==
While the only kilted appearance the King had made was ruthlessly caricatured, creating a memorable image of &quot;our fat friend&quot; being hoisted onto a horse, the effect of the event wryly described as &quot;one and twenty daft days&quot; was an increase in goodwill and a new-found Scottish national identity uniting Highlander and Lowlander in sharing the iconic symbolism of kilts and tartans. The pride of the clan chieftains in their heritage was reinvigorated, but there was no check in the progress of the Highland Clearances.

Additionally, the next Duke of Rothesay, Prince Albert Edward, was the first heir apparent to make use of that title since the Union of the Crowns. The use of that title in Scotland has continued ever since.

Following their service providing personal bodyguards during the visit, the King appointed the Royal Company of Archers as the Sovereign&#x27;s Bodyguard in Scotland.

<text>Jamia Millia Islamia is a public and research university located in Delhi, India. Originally established at Aligarh, United Provinces (present-day Uttar Pradesh, India) during the British Raj in 1920, it moved to its current location in Okhla in 1935. It was given the deemed status by the University Grants Commission in 1962. Jamia Millia Islamia became a central university by an act of the Indian parliament which was passed on 26 December 1988.

The university was founded by Muhammad Iqbal, Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Mahmud Hasan Deobandi, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Abdul Majeed Khwaja, Zakir Hussain, Mahatma Gandhi and Maulana Azad. Its foundation stone was laid by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi, the leader of Silk Letter Movement and the first student of Darul Uloom Deoband along with his fellow Mohammed Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, and Abdul Majid Khwaja.

Jauhar served as its first vice-chancellor from 1920 to 1923, and Khan served as the first chancellor from 1920 to 1927. On 26 May 2017, Najma Heptulla became 11th Chancellor of the university, and Najma Akhtar became the first woman to hold the post of Vice Chancellor in April 2019 and served until 12 November 2023.

==History==

Jamia Millia Islamia was established in Aligarh on 29 October 1920 by nationalist leaders and students of Aligarh Muslim University.

Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, and Abdul Majeed Khwaja were the founding members and it was established mainly in response to the demand of these fellows of the Aligarh Muslim University for a new National Muslim University which would be free from government influence as they felt that the administration of Aligarh Muslim University was of pro-British stance.

===Foundation===
The founding members included Muhammad Ali Jauhar, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari. The foundation stone was laid by Mahmud Hasan Deobandi, an Islamic scholar and activist of the Indian independence movement. He was invited to preside over the foundational ceremony of the university in Aligarh. His speech was prepared and read aloud by his student Shabbir Ahmad Usmani. Its subsequent makers included Abdul Majeed Khwaja, Abid Hussain, Mohammad Mujeeb and Zakir Hussain.

The foundation committee of Jamia included Kifayatullah Dehlawi, Hussain Ahmad Madani, Syed Sulaiman Nadwi, Abdul Haq, Abdul Bari Firangi Mahali, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, Sanaullah Amritsari, Muhammad Iqbal, Syed Mahmud, and Saifuddin Kitchlew.

It was conceived as a national institution that would offer progressive education and an emphasis on Indian nationalism to students from all communities, particularly Muslims. Hussain described “the movement of Jamia Millia Islamia as a struggle for education and cultural renaissance that aims to prepare a blueprint for Indian Muslims which may focus on Islam but simultaneously evolve a national culture for common Indian.” The emergence of Jamia was supported by Mahatma Gandhi, who felt that Jamia Millia Islamia could shape lives of students on the basis of a shared culture and worldview, so Gandhi sent his youngest son Devdas Gandhi to teach Hindi in Jamia.

In 1925, Jamia Millia Islamia moved from Aligarh to Karol Bagh, New Delhi. On 1 March 1935, the foundation stone for a school building was laid at Okhla, then a nondescript village in the southern outskirts of Delhi. In 1936, all institutions of Jamia Millia Islamia except Jamia Press, the Maktaba, and the library moved to the new campus.
The University Grants Commission gave Jamia Millia Islamia the deemed status in 1962. Subsequently, on 26 December 1988, it attained the status of a central university through an act of the Indian parliament.

In 2006, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia paid a visit to the university and donated ₹130 crore(US$30 million) for the construction of a library and a research center.

On 15 December 2019, police entered the campus on the pretext of trying to catch the mob that destroyed public peace outside the university campus. Many students sustained injuries because of the police brutality and it sparked protests in several other universities.
