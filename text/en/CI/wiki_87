<text>Agriculture in the Soviet Union was mostly collectivized, with some limited cultivation of private plots. It is often viewed as one of the more inefficient sectors of the economy of the Soviet Union. A number of food taxes (prodrazverstka, prodnalog, and others) were introduced in the early Soviet period despite the Decree on Land that immediately followed the October Revolution. The forced collectivization and class war against (vaguely defined) &quot;kulaks&quot; under Stalinism greatly disrupted farm output in the 1920s and 1930s, contributing to the Soviet famine of 1932–33 (most especially the Holodomor in Ukraine). A system of state and collective farms, known as sovkhozes and kolkhozes, respectively, placed the rural population in a system intended to be unprecedentedly productive and fair but which turned out to be chronically inefficient and lacking in fairness. Under the administrations of Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Mikhail Gorbachev, many reforms (such as Khrushchev&#x27;s Virgin Lands Campaign) were enacted as attempts to defray the inefficiencies of the Stalinist agricultural system. However, Marxist–Leninist ideology did not allow for any substantial amount of market mechanism to coexist alongside central planning, so the private plot fraction of Soviet agriculture, which was its most productive, remained confined to a limited role. Throughout its later decades the Soviet Union never stopped using substantial portions of the precious metals mined each year in Siberia to pay for grain imports, which has been taken by various authors as an economic indicator showing that the country&#x27;s agriculture was never as successful as it ought to have been. The real numbers, however, were treated as state secrets at the time, so accurate analysis of the sector&#x27;s performance was limited outside the USSR and nearly impossible to assemble within its borders. However, Soviet citizens as consumers were familiar with the fact that foods, especially meats, were often noticeably scarce, to the point that not lack of money so much as lack of things to buy with it was the limiting factor in their standard of living.

Despite immense land resources, extensive farm machinery and agrochemical industries, and a large rural workforce, Soviet agriculture was relatively unproductive. Output was hampered in many areas by the climate and poor worker productivity. However, Soviet farm performance was not uniformly bad. Organized on a large scale and relatively highly mechanized, its state and collective agriculture made the Soviet Union one of the world&#x27;s leading producers of cereals, although bad harvests (as in 1972 and 1975) necessitated imports and slowed the economy. The 1976–1980 five-year plan shifted resources to agriculture, and 1978 saw a record harvest. Conditions were best in the temperate chernozem (black earth) belt stretching from Ukraine through southern Russia into the east, spanning the extreme southern portions of Siberia. In addition to cereals, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, and flax were also major crops. Such performance showed that underlying potential was not lacking, which was not surprising as the agriculture in the Russian Empire was traditionally amongst the highest producing in the world, although rural social conditions since the October Revolution were hardly improved. Grains were mostly produced by the sovkhozes and kolkhozes, but vegetables and herbs often came from private plots.

== History ==

Leon Trotsky and the Opposition bloc had advocated a programme of industrialization which also proposed agricultural cooperatives and the formation of collective farms on a voluntary basis. According to Fitzpatrick, the scholarly consensus was that Stalin appropriated the position of the Left Opposition on such matters as industrialisation and collectivisation. Other scholars have argued that the economic programme of Trotsky differed from the forced policy of collectivisation implemented by Stalin after 1928 due to the levels of brutality associated with its enforcement.

During the Russian Civil War, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s experience as political chief of various regions, carrying out the dictates of war communism, involved extracting grain from peasants, including extraction at gunpoint from those who were not supportive of the Bolshevik (Red) side of the war (such as Whites and Greens). After a grain crisis during 1928, Stalin established the USSR&#x27;s system of state and collective farms when he moved to replace the New Economic Policy (NEP) with collective farming, which grouped peasants into collective farms (&quot;kolkhozy&quot;) and state farms (&quot;sovkhozy&quot;). These collective farms allowed for faster mechanization, and indeed, this period saw widespread use of farming machinery for the first time in many parts of the USSR, and a rapid recovery of agricultural outputs, which had been damaged by the Russian Civil War. Both grain production, and the number of farm animals rose above pre-civil war levels by early 1931, before major famine undermined these initially good results.

At the same time, individual farming and khutirs were liquidated through class discrimination identifying such elements as kulaks. In Soviet propaganda, kulaks were portrayed as counter-revolutionaries and organizers of anti-Soviet protests and terrorist acts. In Ukraine the Turkic name &quot;korkulu&quot; was adopted, which meant &quot;dangerous&quot;. The word itself is foreign to Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedia, struggle with kulaks in Ukraine was taking place more intensely than anywhere else in the Soviet Union.

Coincidentally with the start of First &quot;pyatiletka&quot; (5 year plan), a new commissariat of the Soviet Union was created, better known as &quot;Narkomzem&quot; (People&#x27;s Commissariat of Land Cultivation) led by Yakov Yakovlev. After the speech on collectivization that Stalin gave to the Communist Academy, there were no specific instructions on how exactly it had to be implemented, except for liquidation of kulaks as a class. Stalin&#x27;s revolution was one of the factors which led to the severe Soviet famine of 1932–33, better known in Ukraine as the Holodomor. Official Soviet sources blamed the famine on counterrevolutionary efforts by the kulaks, though there is little evidence for this claim. Another contributing factor to the famine suggested by some historians, was poor weather conditions and poor harvests. The famine started in Ukraine in the winter of 1931 and despite the lack of any official reports the news spread by word of mouth rapidly. During that time restrictions on rail travel were set by authorities. Only next year in 1932-33 the famine spread outside of Ukraine to agricultural regions of Russia and Kazakhstan, while the &quot;news blackout continued&quot;. The famine led to the introduction of the internal passport system, due to the unmanageable flow of migrants to the cities. The famine finally ended in 1933, after a successful harvest. Collectivization continued. During the second five-year plan Stalin came up with another famous slogan in 1935: &quot;Life has become better, life has become more cheerful.&quot; Rationing was lifted. In 1936, due to a poor harvest, fears of another famine led to famously long breadlines. However, no such famine occurred, and these fears proved largely unfounded.

During the second five-year plan, under the policy of &quot;cultural revolution&quot; , the Soviet authorities established fines that were collected from farmers. Citing Siegelbaum&#x27;s &quot;Stakhanovism&quot; in her book &quot;Everyday Stalinism&quot;, Fitzpatrick wrote: &quot;...in a district in the Voronezh Region, one rural soviet chairman imposed fines on kolkhoz members totaling 60,000 rubles in 1935 and 1936: &quot;He imposed the fines on any pretext and at his own discretion - for not showing up for work, for not attending literacy classes, for &#x27;impolite language&#x27;, for not having dogs tied up... Kolkhoznik M. A. Gorshkov was fined 25 rubles for the fact that &#x27;in his hut the floors were not washed&#x27;&quot;.

=== Khrushchev Era 1955-1963 ===
Nikita Khrushchev was a top expert on agricultural policies and looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs. Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors. By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest. In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques. Especially after his visit to the United States in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology.

Khrushchev became a hyper-enthusiastic crusader to grow corn (maize). He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of hectares to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands. More than 1.5 million people went to Kazakhstan, the Volga Region, Siberia, and the Ural Mountains. In 1955, Khrushchev advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. The delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn seed salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to visit Garst&#x27;s large farm. The Iowan visited the Soviet Union, where he became friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR of seed corn. Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides. This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later complained that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and &quot;as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I&quot;.

Khrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines such as combines and tractors but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the &quot;kolkhozes&quot; and &quot;sovkhozes&quot; (state farms). After a successful test involving MTS which served one large &quot;kolkhoz&quot; each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed. Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and &quot;kolkhozes&quot; were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines. MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to &quot;kolkhozes&quot; and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators. The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many &quot;kolkhozes&quot;. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations. Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the &quot;kolkhozes&quot; now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.

In the 1940s Stalin put Trofim Lysenko in charge of agricultural research, with his crackpot ideas that flouted modern genetics science. Lysenko maintained his influence under Khrushchev, and helped block the adoption of American techniques. In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in the production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials kept Khrushchev happy with unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by farmers who slaughtered their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.
In June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter, by 25–30%. This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk (Rostov Region), this discontent escalated to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military. According to Soviet official accounts, 22 people were killed and 87 wounded. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev&#x27;s reputation in the West.

Drought struck the Soviet Union in 1963; the harvest of of grain was down from a peak of in 1958. The shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from Khrushchev. Reluctant to purchase food in the West, but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, Khrushchev exhausted the nation&#x27;s hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs.

==Agricultural labour==

Stalin&#x27;s campaign of forced collectivization relied on propiska to keep farmers tied to the land. The collectivization was a major factor explaining the sector&#x27;s poor performance. It has been referred to as a form of &quot;neo-serfdom&quot;, in which the Communist bureaucracy replaced the former landowners. In the new state and collective farms, outside directives failed to take local growing conditions into account, and peasants were often required to supply much of their produce for nominal payment.

Also, interference in the day-to-day affairs of peasant life often bred resentment and worker alienation across the countryside. The human toll was very large, with millions, perhaps as many as 5.3 million, dying from famine due largely to collectivisation, and much livestock was slaughtered by the peasants for their own consumption. In the collective and state farms, low labor productivity was a consequence for the entire Soviet period. As in other economic sectors, the government promoted Stakhanovism as a means to improve labor productivity. This system was thrilling to a few workers who had both the talent and the vanity to make everyone else&#x27;s performance look bad, but it was generally regarded as dispiriting and a form of apple polishing by most workers, especially in the later decades of the union, when socialist idealism had become moribund among the rank-and-file. It also tended to be destructive of the state&#x27;s capital equipment, which was thrashed and soon trashed instead of being well maintained.

The &quot;sovkhozy&quot; tended to emphasize larger scale production than the &quot;kolkhozy&quot; and had the ability to specialize in certain crops. The government tended to supply them with better machinery and fertilizers, not least because Soviet ideology held them to be a higher step on the scale of socialist transition. Machine and tractor stations were established with the &quot;lower form&quot; of socialist farm, the kolkhoz, mainly in mind, because they were at first not trusted with ownership of their own capital equipment (too &quot;capitalist&quot;) as well as not trusted to know how to use it well without close instruction. Labor productivity (and in turn incomes) tended to be greater on the &quot;sovkhozy&quot;. Workers in state farms received wages and social benefits, whereas those on the collective farms tended to receive a portion of the net income of their farm, based, in part, on the success of the harvest and their individual contribution.

Although accounting for a small share of cultivated area, private plots produced a substantial share of the country&#x27;s meat, milk, eggs, and vegetables.

The private plots were also an important source of income for rural households. In 1977, families of kolkhoz members obtained 72% of their meat, 76% of their eggs and most of their potatoes from private holdings. Surplus products, as well as surplus livestock, were sold to &quot;kolkhozy&quot; and &quot;sovkhozy&quot; and also to state consumer cooperatives. Statistics may actually under-represent the total contribution of private plots to Soviet agriculture. The only time when private plots were completely banned was during collectivization, when famine took millions of lives.

== Efficiency or inefficiency of collective farming ==
The theme that the Soviet Union was not getting good enough results out of its farming sector, and that the top leadership needed to take significant actions to correct this, was a theme that permeated Soviet economics for the entire lifespan of the union. In the 1920s through 1940s, the first variation on the subject was that counter-revolutionary subversive wrecking need to be ferreted out and violently repressed. In the late 1950s through 1970s, the focus shifted to lack of technocratic finesse, with the idea that smarter technocratic management would fix things. By the 1980s, the final variation of the theme was a bifurcation between people who wanted to substantially shake up the nomenklatura system and those who wanted to double down on its ossification.

After Stalin died and a troika belatedly emerged, Georgy Malenkov proposed agricultural reforms. But in 1957, Nikita Khrushchev achieved a purge of that troika and began proposing his reforms, of which the Virgin Lands Campaign is the most famous. During and after Khrushchev&#x27;s premiership, Alexei Kosygin wanted to reorganize Soviet agriculture instead of increasing investments. He claimed that the main reason for inefficiency in the sector could be blamed on the sector&#x27;s infrastructure. Once he became the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, he was able to direct the 1965 Soviet economic reform.

The theory behind collectivization included not only that it would be socialist instead of capitalist but also that it would replace the small-scale unmechanized and inefficient farms that were then commonplace in the Soviet Union with large-scale mechanized farms that would produce food far more efficiently. Lenin saw private farming as a source of capitalist mentalities and hoped to replace farms with either &quot;sovkhozy&quot; which would make the farmers &quot;proletarian&quot; workers or &quot;kolkhozy&quot; which would at least be collective. However, most observers say that despite isolated successes, collective farms and sovkhozes were inefficient, the agricultural sector being weak throughout the history of the Soviet Union.

Hedrick Smith wrote in &quot;The Russians&quot; (1976) that, according to Soviet statistics, one fourth of the value of agricultural production in 1973 was produced on the private plots peasants were allowed (2% of the whole arable land). In the 1980s, 3% of the land was in private plots which produced more than a quarter of the total agricultural output. i.e. private plots produced somewhere around 1600% and 1100% as much as common ownership plots in 1973 and 1980. Soviet figures claimed that the Soviets produced 20–25% as much as the U.S. per farmer in the 1980s.

This was despite the fact that the Soviet Union had invested enormously to agriculture. Production costs were very high and the USSR had widespread food shortages even though the country had a large share of the best agricultural soil in the world and a high land/population ratio.

The claims of inefficiency have been criticized by Neo-Marxist Economist Joseph E. Medley. Statistics based on value rather than volume of production may give one view of reality, as public-sector food was heavily subsidized and sold at much lower prices than private-sector produce. Also, the 2–3% of arable land allotted as private plots does not include the large area allocated to the peasants as pasturage for their private livestock; combined with land used to produce grain for fodder, the pasture and the individual plots total almost 20% of all Soviet farmland. Private farming may also be relatively inefficient, taking roughly 40% of all agricultural labor to produce only 26% of all output by value. Another problem is these criticisms tend to discuss only a small number of consumer products and do not take into account the fact that the &quot;kolkhozy&quot; and &quot;sovkhozy&quot; produced mainly grain, cotton, flax, forage, seed, and other non-consumer goods with a relatively low value per unit area. This economist admits to some inefficiency in Soviet agriculture, but claims that the failure reported by most Western experts was a myth. He believes the above criticisms to be ideological and emphasizes &quot;the possibility that socialized agriculture may be able to make valuable contributions to improving human welfare&quot;.

==In popular culture==

Soviet culture presented an agro-Romantic view of country life.
After the fall of Soviet Union, it has been recreated tongue-in-cheek in the albums and videos of the Moldovan group &quot;Zdob şi Zdub&quot;.

==Research==
The Tsar&#x27;s Petrovskaya Agricultural Academy was taken over during the Revolution and renamed the Moscow Agricultural Institute. (Today known as the Russian State Agrarian University – Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy.) One of its graduates was Nikolai Vavilov, who would go on to contribute greatly - albeit controversially during Stalin&#x27;s rule. Vavilov was greatly disliked by Lysenko but after his death was recognised as a hero to Soviet agricultural research and indeed to agricultural science worldwide.

Under Supreme Soviet legislation the experimental plots/fields of agricultural research and agricultural educational institutions were inviolable, not to be seized and repurposed even by state agencies. Exceptions could be made rarely and only by the USSR or Republic governments themselves.

<text>Peter Miller Dawkins (born March 8, 1938) is an American business executive and former college football player, hockey player, military officer, and political candidate. Dawkins attended the United States Military Academy, where he played as a halfback for the Army Cadets football team from 1956 to 1958. As a senior in 1958 he won the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award, and was named as a consensus All-American. After graduating from the Military Academy in 1959, he studied at the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. Dawkins served as an officer in the United States Army until he retired in 1983 with the rank of brigadier general. He received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member and Supreme Allied Commander Europe, General Bernard W. Rogers, USA in 1983. He was a Republican candidate for United States Senate in 1988. Dawkins has held executive positions with Lehman Brothers, Bain &amp; Company, Primerica, and Citigroup.

He is the only person in history to have held the titles of Brigade Commander, Football Team Captain, Class President, Star Man (top 5% of the class), Heisman Trophy winner, and Rhodes Scholar. He is often regarded as the most decorated cadet in the history of the United States Military Academy.

Following Johnny Lujack&#x27;s death on July 25, 2023, Dawkins is the oldest surviving winner of the Heisman Trophy. He is the lone survivor among the first 27 recipients (1935–1961).

==Early life, education and athletic career==

At age 11, Dawkins was successfully treated for polio with aggressive physical therapy. After earning a scholarship, Dawkins entered Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. There he was an all-league quarterback, and captain of the baseball team. He graduated from Cranbrook in 1955.

Accepted by Yale University, Dawkins chose instead to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. He earned high honors, serving as First Captain, president of his class, captain of the football team, and a &quot;Star Man&quot; in the top five percent of his class academically. A cadet is considered outstanding if he attains one of these positions. Dawkins was the only cadet in history to hold all four at once. He was featured in &quot;Life Magazine&quot; and &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Even before his graduation, many predicted he would make general and perhaps even be Army Chief of Staff. Dawkins began his playing career at West Point under head football coach Earl Blaik as a fourth string quarterback before being cut from the position. Later playing as a halfback during his junior and senior season, Dawkins saw great success and eventually won the Heisman Trophy and the Maxwell Award and was a consensus All-America selection in 1958. Dawkins was also an assistant captain for the hockey team. At Oxford, he won three Blues in rugby union and is credited with popularizing the overarm throw (originally called the &quot;Yankee torpedo pass&quot;) into the lineout.

Dawkins graduated with a BSc from the Military Academy in 1959 with a very high class standing, and was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship. He earned a BA at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1962 in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (promoted to an MA in 1968, per tradition) and later earned a Master of Public Affairs in 1970 and a PhD in 1977 from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University with the dissertation &quot;The United States Army and the &quot;Other&quot; War in Vietnam: A Study of the Complexity of Implementing Organizational Change&quot;.

==Military career==

After being commissioned from the academy and completing his tenure as a Rhodes Scholar, Dawkins finished Infantry School and Ranger School before being posted for duty in the 82nd Airborne Division. He received two Bronze Stars for Valor for his service in Vietnam and held commands in the 7th Infantry Division and 101st Airborne. From 1971 to 1972, Dawkins, while a lieutenant colonel, was the commander of the 1st Battalion 23rd Infantry, 2nd Infantry Division, Camp Hovey, Korea. In addition to being an instructor at the academy, he was a White House Fellow in the 1973–74 class. During that time, he was chosen to work on a task force, charged with changing the U.S. Army into an all-volunteer force. During the mid-1970s Colonel Dawkins was brigade commander of the 3rd ( &quot;Golden Brigade&quot;) of the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina that included the 1st and 2nd 505th and 1/508th battalions. In the late 1970s he was 3rd Brigade Commander (War Eagle Brigade, which included the 1/503, 2/503, and 3/187 Infantry Battalions) of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) at Fort Campbell with the rank of colonel. After serving as the Brigade Commander he became the Chief of Staff for the 101st Airborne Division and was subsequently promoted to brigadier general. In 1966 Dawkins appeared in uniform on the cover of &quot;Life Magazine&quot; and participated in a segment of the U.S. Army &quot;Big Picture&quot; film series, &quot;A Nation Builds Under Fire.&quot; This was a short documentary reviewing United States progress in South Vietnam, narrated by actor John Wayne.

==Business career==
At the conclusion of his 24-year career in the Army, Dawkins retired with the rank of brigadier general in 1983. Following his retirement from the Army, Dawkins took up a position as a partner in the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, later becoming vice-chairman of Bain &amp; Company. In 1991, he moved on to become chairman and CEO of Primerica. Dawkins was a senior partner at Flintlock Capital Asset Management and is currently a senior advisor for Virtu Financial.

==Political career==

Sometime before April 1987, Dawkins established residence in Rumson, New Jersey. He ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican against New Jersey&#x27;s incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator, Frank Lautenberg, in 1988. The race was notable for the negative tone that emerged from both sides and for Lautenberg&#x27;s criticism of Dawkins&#x27;s lack of roots in the state. Dawkins lost in the general election by an eight-point margin.

<text>The Rosses (officially known by its Irish language name, &quot;Na Rosa&quot;; in the genitive case &quot;Na Rosann&quot;) is a traditional &#x27;district&#x27; in the west of County Donegal in Ulster, the northern province in Ireland. The Rosses has a population of over 7,000 centred on the town of Dungloe, which acts as the educational, shopping and civic centre for the area. Defined by physical boundaries in the form of rivers, as well as history and language use, the area has a distinctive identity, separate from the rest of County Donegal. The extensive district lies between the parish and district of Gweedore to the north and the town of Glenties to the south. A large part of the Rosses is in the &quot;Gaeltacht&quot;, which means that Irish is the spoken language. The Rosses, Cloughaneely and Gweedore, known locally as &quot;the three parishes&quot;, with 16,000 Irish speakers, together form a social and cultural region different from the rest of the county, with Gweedore serving as the main centre for socialising and industry. Gaeltacht an Láir is another Irish-speaking area.

==Irish language==
The following is a list of electoral divisions in the area with the percentage that speak Irish:

# An Clochán Liath (1,785) (15%)
# Anagaire (2,138) (55%)
# Arainn Mhor (529) (62%)
# Inis Mhic an Doirn (1,410) (9%)
# An Duchoraidh (78) (34%)
# Leitir Mhic an Bhaird (650) (19%)
# An Machaire (615) (15%)
# Cro Bheithe (170) (60%)

==Culture==

Once a predominantly Irish-speaking area, over recent generations English has become increasingly common. Irish is still used extensively in some areas including parts of the island of Arranmore, the townland of Ranafast and the village of Annagry. In some areas, like the hills around Dungloe, around Loughanure and in pockets of Doochary and Lettermacaward, the Irish language is predominant.

The area fields a number of sports teams, both in soccer and Gaelic football. Keadue Rovers from the lower Rosses have traditionally been the area&#x27;s strongest soccer team, and there are also teams in Arranmore (Arranmore United F.C.) and in Maghery (Strand Rovers F.C.). An Clochán Liath have traditionally been the strongest in Gaelic football, winning seven County Championships between 1930 and 1958. There are also teams in Mullaghderg (Naomh Muire), and in Lettermacaward (Na Rossa).

There is a strong tradition of songwriting in the area, Seán McBride (1906–1996) from Cruit Island wrote the popular song &quot;The Homes of Donegal&quot;.

There are connections between the people of the Rosses and Scotland, Glasgow in particular, due to the economic need for emigration in the past and the strong ties forged over the generations as a result. Many people from the Rosses, in common with people from other parts of County Donegal, have also settled in the City of Derry, especially since the late 1840s.
==Geography==
The area is bounded by the River Gweebarra to the south, the Gweedore River (known locally as the Crolly River) to the north, the Derryveagh Mountains and the Gweebarra River (Doochary Bridge) to the east and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The name comes from &quot;Ros&quot;, the Irish word for headland. The area presents a rocky barren landscape, studded with a myriad of lakes and inlets of the sea. Lakes include Lough Anure, Lough Craghy, Dunglow Lough and Lough Meela.

==Transport==
The Rosses boasts Donegal&#x27;s only airport at Carrickfinn. Various coach companies serve the area.

==History==
The Rosses has been inhabited since time immemorial, and the ancient church of St Crona in Termon near Dungloe has been dated to the 6th century AD. It was the site of a monastery founded by St. Crona, a cousin of the Royal Saint called Columcille, founder of the monastic settlement at Iona, and was the centre of the parish of Templecrone.

In the 16th century, a number of ships from the Spanish Armada sank off or landed off its coast.

==Economy==
Historically the Rosses has relied heavily on hospitality, tourism and the fishing industry as the mainstays of its economy. The area has its own indigenous supermarket chain called The Cope which has been quite successful. There is very little manufacturing industry in the Rosses apart from a few companies located in Dungloe.
==Tourism==
The area claims a large proportion of Donegal&#x27;s tourist income, due to its renowned scenery and its many festivals, including the Mary From Dungloe International Festival. There is a very strong tradition of marching bands emanating from the region; the area boasts many All-Ireland championship bands in all grades and disciplines.

<text>Gargnano () is a town and (municipality) in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It is situated on the western shore of Lake Garda. The municipal territory includes the artificial Valvestino Lake, created in 1962.

==History==
The name of the village appears for the first time in a document of 937 as Garniano, perhaps derived from the Latin stem &quot;Garenius&quot;. Passages of the Roman historian Titus Livius and inscriptions on headstones testify to the presence of Etruscans, Celts, Cenomani and Romans.

From 1350 to 1426 the territory of Gargnano was a dominion of the Visconti of Milan, later a dominion of the Republic of Venice.

In 1866 Gargnano was bombarded by the Austrian navy during the fighting on Lake Garda which formed part of the Third Italian War of Independence.

* Erika Blanc, actress
* Cesare Lievi, theatre director, poet and dramatist
* Benito Mussolini, during the Italian Social Republic (the Republic of Saló) lived in the Villa delle Orsoline (Villa Feltrinelli)

<doc id="1074358" wikidata="Q385543" url="?curid=1074358" title="Communist Party of the Netherlands">
<text>The Communist Party of the Netherlands (, , CPN) was a communist party in the Netherlands. The party was founded in 1909 as the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and merged with the Pacifist Socialist Party, the Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party in 1991, forming the GroenLinks. Members opposed to the merger founded the New Communist Party of the Netherlands.

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1907, Jan Ceton, Willem van Ravesteyn, and David Wijnkoop of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (SDAP) founded &#x27; (&quot;The Tribune&quot;), a magazine in which they criticized the party leadership. They maintained orthodox Marxist views and expected a proletarian revolution. They opposed the leadership of the SDAP, who were more oriented towards more a revisionist ideology and a parliamentary and reformist political strategy. At a party congress in Deventer held on 14 February 1909, SDAP leaders demanded that they stop publishing &quot;De Tribune&quot; or be expelled from the party. Wijnkoop and Ceton refused; they and their supporters, including the poet Herman Gorter and the mathematician Gerrit Mannoury, left to form a new party. This was the first such split in a Western European socialist party, although others followed. There had already been a split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and between the Bulgarian Workers&#x27; Social Democratic Party and the &quot;Tesnjaki&quot; (&quot;Narrowist&quot;) group. On 14 March 1909 the dissenters founded the new Social Democratic Party (SDP). They had a membership of around 400 spread across different cities: Amsterdam (160), Rotterdam (65), The Hague (45), Leiden (56), Utrecht (25), Bussum (15).

===1909–1922===
In the 1910s, the SDAP paid much attention to attacking the newly formed SDP. The mobilization for World War I, which the SDAP supported and the SDP opposed, further strengthened the differences between the parties. In the 1917 general election the SDP was still unable to win any seats. In May 1918, the left wing founded the journal &quot;De Internationale&quot;, uniting four opposition groups within the SDP, with groups in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague plus the Zimmerwald Left Propaganda Union. This group did not favour the parliamentarianism of the majority.

The Russian Revolution fractured most European parties between their revolutionary and reformist factions; this had already happened in the Netherlands, but it profoundly changed the SDP. Previously a party of orthodox Marxist intellectuals with little working class support, the SDP saw an influx of members coming from the free socialist organisations, primarily the NAS.

The SDP entered the election again in July 1918, winning two seats that were occupied by Willem van Ravesteyn and Wijnkoop; Wijnkoop assumed the leadership of the party. The SDP formed a revolutionary parliamentary party with the League of Christian Socialists and the Socialist Party, both of which had one seat. In 1921, Willy Kruyt, the MP for the League of Christian Socialists, joined the SDP while the MP for the Socialist Party left the revolutionary parliamentary party.

As the German Revolution (and the related Brussels Soldiers&#x27; Council) developed across the borders in November 1918, the Netherlands was also affected by strikes and mutinies. On 10 November, the SDP called for the formation of soldiers&#x27; and workers councils with a view to forming a popular government. A week later at their Leiden Congress, the party name was changed to Communist Party Holland (CPH), to stress its identification with the workers councils. The following year, on 10 April 1919 the CPH joined the Comintern, which helped transform the party from a mix of anarchists, syndicalists and orthodox Marxists into a tightly-knit Leninist community.

In 1920, prominent left communists Gorter and Pannekoek left the party to form the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of the Netherlands which advocated council communism. In the 1922 general election the CPH retained its two seats. One of its unsuccessful candidates that year, Tan Malaka, was the first subject of the colonial Dutch East Indies to run for office in the Netherlands.

===1922–1945===
Before the 1925 general election, Wijnkoop was replaced as party leader by Louis de Visser under the pressure of the Comintern; this was the cause of heavy internal division within the party. Jacques de Kadt had already left the party in 1924 to help set up The League of Communist Struggle &amp; Propaganda Clubs. In the background of several of these divisions was the conflict in the Soviet Union between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Wijnkoop, Henk Sneevliet (a prominent international communist and an ally of Trotsky), and other prominent members, were expelled from the party. Sneevliet founded the Revolutionary Socialist Union, which later became the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP). In 1926, the entire Rotterdam branch was expelled. These expellees joined Wijnkoop to form a separate Communist Party of Holland-Central Committee. All three, the RSP, the CPH-central committee and the old CPH (which ran under the name &quot;CPH – Dutch section of the Communist International&quot;), contested the 1929 general election and both CPHs won one seat each, whilst the RSP failed to win any. In 1930, the CPHs were forced to merge by the Comintern.

After the mutiny on the Zeven Provinciën in the same year, the independence of the Dutch Indies became an important theme at the 1933 general election. The party performed particularly well at this election, doubling its seats to four. Among those elected was the Indonesian nationalist Rustam Effendi, the first subject from the Dutch Indies to enter parliament. At the 1937 general election, the party was able to retain its seats.

On 15 May 1940, immediately after the German occupation, the party decided to organize an underground movement. In July 1940, the Nazi occupation force banned the CPN; the party continued illegally. In 1940, together with the much smaller anti-Stalinist communist Revolutionary Socialist Party, the only pre-war organisation that had protested against the anti-Semitic measures by the German occupiers, it founded a resistance movement called &quot;Raad van Verzet&quot; (&quot;Resistance Council&quot;). It published a resistance newspaper called &quot;De Waarheid&quot; (The Truth). Both took part in the February strike in 1941, the largest act of resistance in the Netherlands.

===1945–1963===

After the war, the party was led by Paul de Groot, who had a strong grip on the party&#x27;s organization. In 1945 the CPN was offered one ministry in the Schermerhorn–Drees cabinet, mainly because of the CPN&#x27;s role in the Dutch Resistance. The CPN refused, demanding a second ministry. In the 1946 general election, the CPN received nearly 11% of the vote and won 10 seats in the House of Representatives. The CPN also won seats in the Senate for the first time. This electoral success was linked to the role of the CPN in the resistance.

The following period was characterized by decreasing popularity for communism, the rise of internal divisions, and the methodical isolation of the CPN by other parties.

With the rise of the Cold War, the party began to lose popularity. The 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état tainted the reputation of Communism. In the 1948 general election, the party lost two seats. In 1949, a group of Frisian Communists were removed from the party ranks; they founded the Socialist Union, but they were unable to play a significant role in Dutch politics. In the 1952 general election, the party lost two additional seats. In 1956, the CPN lost votes again; however, because of the expansion of parliament it won an additional seat. The party supported the Russian intervention against the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. After the invasion, the party office, in Felix Meritis in Amsterdam, was attacked by opponents of the invasion.

Meanwhile, internal dissent against the strict leadership of De Groot was rising. In 1958, the &quot;Bruggroep&quot; (&quot;Bridge group&quot;) left the CPN in a conflict over the role of the Communist &quot;Eenheidsvakcentrale&quot; (&quot;Unity Trade Union&quot;). Leaders of the &quot;Bruggroep&quot; were prominent Resistance figures like Gerben Wagenaar and Henk Gortzak. The General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) claimed to be behind the split, while the CPN leadership claimed that the dissenters were agents working for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The &quot;Bruggroep&quot; founded a new party, the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (SWP). In 1957, the Pacifist Socialist Party was founded. The PSP united former members of the CPN, including members of the Socialist Union, and the Labour Party (PvdA), and other left-wing independents. In the following 1959 general election the CPN lost all but three seats, while the PSP won two seats, and the SWP was unable to win any seats. Many SWP members, like Gortzak, later joined the PSP.

In the 1940s and 1950s, the CPN was methodically isolated by other parties. Civil servants were forbidden to become members of the CPN and it was not allowed separate time on public radio or television. The party&#x27;s unequivocal support for decolonization of the Dutch East Indies isolated the party in parliament. Because of its anti-NATO and European Economic Community stances the party was blocked from the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Nuclear Energy committees in parliament. The AIVD kept close tabs on the party. All other parties in parliament were deeply anti-communist, especially the social democratic PvdA.

In the 1963 general election the party gained one seat. The developing students&#x27; movement was an important impetus for the party. In 1964, the international conflict between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the USSR also split the CPN. A group called Communist Unity Movement of the Netherlands (Marxist–Leninist) left the CPN in that year. They went through several intense splits based on ideological and personal conflicts. In 1971 one of the small groups formed the Socialist Party, which became a successful political party from the mid-1990s. The CPN took a rather ambiguous stance in the conflict between the USSR and the PRC.

===1967–1989===
Before the 1967 general election De Groot was replaced by Marcus Bakker. De Groot was made an honorary member of the CPN. The party won another seat, making the total five. The CPN condemned the Soviet intervention against the Prague Spring. In 1971 yet another seat was added, and in 1972 the party had seven seats. The 1977 general election saw a conflict between the social democrat Joop den Uyl and the Christian democrat Dries van Agt. Many CPN sympathizers voted for the social democratic PvdA and the CPN lost all but two seats. In 1978, under pressure from new young members, De Groot lost his honorary membership. In the 1981 general election, the placement of American nuclear weapons is a major issue. The CPN, which prominently led one of the campaigning groups, The Committee against the N-bomb, was rewarded with another seat.

In the 1982 elections, the party got its first mayor in the Communist stronghold of Beerta. Before the general election of the same year Marcus Bakker stepped down in favour of Ina Brouwer. With her a new generation of younger, often female MPs entered politics. She was able to keep the three seats. The CPN tried to renew its political program, emphasizing New Left issues like feminism and gay rights. In reaction to this working class-oriented members founded the Horizontal Council of Communists (called so because they were members from different local branches, breaking the vertical organization of democratic centralism). The group tried to pressure the CPN into returning to its Old Left course. In 1983 they left the party and formed the League of Communists in the Netherlands (VCN,&quot;Verbond van Communisten In Nederland&quot;). In 1986, both the CPN and VCN contested the elections. Neither won a seat in the House of Representatives. The CPN still had two senators. As one of the last acts of the party, the party leadership attended the festivities surrounding 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic.

===Dissolution===
In 1989, the party merged with three other small left-wing parties, namely the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP), the left-wing Christian Political Party of Radicals (PPR) and the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party (EVP) to form the GroenLinks. In 1991, the party officially disbanded; the VCN was joined by other former members of the CPN, who left because they disagreed with the new course, and founded the New Communist Party of the Netherlands (NCPN), which still exists today.

There is no influence left of the old Marxist wing of the CPN in GroenLinks. The &quot;new&quot; generation has been very prominent: Ina Brouwer led the party in the 1994 general election and one of the party&#x27;s senators Jos van der Lans was a member of the CPN. The former party chair who was very influential in the formulation of the new liberal course, Herman Meijer, was one of the gay rights activists who joined the CPN in the 1970s.

===Name===
The CPN changed its name two times. It was founded as Sociaal-Democratische Partij (Social-Democratic party; SDP). It followers were commonly known as &quot;Tribunists&quot; after their main organ. After the Russian Revolution the term social-democracy became linked to the reformist socialists, while the term communist was linked to Leninist revolutionary socialism. All sections of the Comintern were obliged to adopt the name &#x27;Communist Party&#x27;. In 1919 the party changed its name to Communistische Partij Holland (Communist Party Holland; CPH). The name implied that the CPH was the Dutch section of the worldwide Communist International. In 1935 the party changed its name to Communistische Partij van Nederland (Communist Party of the Netherlands; CPN), to express its allegiance to the Netherlands and Dutch institutions.

==Ideology and issues==
===Ideological development===
The SDP was founded as an orthodox Marxist party advocating an economic and social revolution that would overthrow the capitalist economic and political system, in favour for a socialist dictatorship of the proletariat, which would in turn evolve into a classless, communist society. They broke away from the SDAP, when the reformist leadership blocked their publication of an autonomous journal.

After the Russian Revolution, the party adopted the name Communist. With the departure of the left-wing grouped around &quot;De Internationale&quot;, the party adopted Marxism–Leninism, the official ideology of the USSR and the Comintern. This advocated the overthrow of the state by a vanguard party, which would lead the country towards socialism. The party remained faithful to the USSR&#x27;s version of Marxism–Leninism during the 1920s, when Trotsky&#x27;s interpretation became an important ideological competitor of Joseph Stalin&#x27;s. This led to a split when a group around a prominent ally of Trotsky, Henk Sneevliet, left the party to form the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP).

In the 1960s, the party did not choose sides in the conflict between the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the USSR. Nevertheless, a Maoist group, called the Communist Unity Movement of the Netherlands split from the Party. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Party began to move away from its Marxist/Leninist roots and began embrace a more libertarian and Eurocommunist programme with a strong emphasis on feminism.

===Social policy===
The Communist Party has always been an advocate of the interests of the working class as shown by their advocacy of higher wages and lower prices. They also campaigned for work conditions in factories should be improved, that child labour should be banned completely, that the work day should be regulated and that laws against striking should be repealed.

The CPN advocated a strong role of the state in the economy. They believed the state should supply cheap housing, free and neutral education and health care insurance. They felt that important industries should be nationalized in the short term and in the long term the entire economy should be planned, that taxation should be progressive and that those without jobs should receive benefits.

===Foreign policy===
The communist movement emerged from other strands of the workers movement because of their vigorous opposition to World War I. After 1918, the recognition of the USSR and the independence of Indonesia became important issues. During World War II the party was active in the resistance movement. After the war, its foreign policy was explicitly anti-West German and pro-USSR. It favoured Soviet interventions in Czechoslovakia and Hungary and sought Dutch recognition of East Germany. It opposed Dutch membership of NATO and the European Economic Community. In the 1970s and 1980s its policy became more critical of the USA, supporting the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam in the Vietnam War. It played an important role in the popular opposition against the placement of nuclear weapons in the Netherlands.

===Domestic issues===
The party also emphasised the radical democratisation of the Dutch political system. It opposed monarchy. It sought to abolish the Council of State and the Senate. A referendum and trial by jury should be implemented. Citizens should appoint civil servants.

In the 1970s and 1980s the party began to embrace New Left issues like the fight for women&#x27;s and gay rights.

==Representation==
===House of Representatives===
=== Senate ===
===Municipal and provincial government===
Although the CPN was particularly strong in several provinces, especially Groningen, it never cooperated in any provincial executive.

The party supplied only one mayor, namely Hanneke Jagersma in the CPN stronghold of Beerta. In the late 1940s, the CPN participated in several municipal executives but after the USSR&#x27;s intervention in Hungary, these all fell. In the 1950s the party got an absolute majority in the municipal council of Finsterwolde the municipality was consequently put under control of the national government. In the 1980s the party again started to cooperate in local executives.

The following table shows the results of the provincial election of 1962 by province. It shows the areas where the CPN was strong, namely North Holland and to a lesser extent Groningen and South Holland. The party was very weak in rural and Catholic Limburg and Brabant.

==Electorate==
The support for the SDP, which was founded before the introduction of universal suffrage, was strong among left-wing intellectuals and educated working class circles. This was mainly limited to Amsterdam and Rotterdam. With the introduction of universal suffrage, the SDP, and later CPH began to branch out to the poorest circles of the working classes. In the Zaanstreek, around Zaandam and the port cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam the party was especially strong. After the Second World War, the CPN branched out to the poor rural province of Groningen and other poor rural areas like West Friesland. In some Groningen municipalities like Finsterwolde, Beerta, the party won near absolute majorities. In these municipalities, which now form Reiderland the refounded CPN, NCPN still performs particularly well. In the 1950s the general support for the CPN weakened with the rise of Cold War. In the 1960s and 1970s the CPN began to gain support form students. In the 1980s the party lost its working class support.

==Organization==

===Organizational structure===
The party was organized on the principle of democratic centralism. The party&#x27;s board was the highest organ of the party, it decided the order of candidates on election lists for the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament, had the final say over the party program and had the ability to expel members. It was elected by the party&#x27;s Congress. The party saw its political unity and strong discipline as conditions for its ideological zeal.

Between 1946 and 1980, the party&#x27;s headquarters was in Felix Meritis in Amsterdam.

===Linked and pillarized organisations===
The party had a small, but strong communist pillar around it. Important organizations were the communist trade union, the Rode Vakcentrale (Red Trade Union) before 1940 and the Eenheidsvakcentrale (Unity Trade Union) between 1945 and 1960, and the party&#x27;s paper, &quot;De Tribune&quot; (the Tribune) before 1940 and &quot;De Waarheid&quot; (The Truth), which was founded as a resistance paper and named after its Soviet counterpart after 1940. The party&#x27;s youth organization was the formally independent General Dutch Youth League. The party&#x27;s scientific organization was the Instituut voor Politiek en Sociaal Onderzoek (Institute for Political and Social Research) which published &quot;Politiek en Cultuur&quot; (Politics and Culture). The CPN had its own publisher called Pegasus.

===International organisations===
Since 1918, the party was a member of the Third International, first in the form of the Comintern, and after 1947 in the Cominform.

===Relationships to other parties===
For a long time the communists were methodically isolated, partially because of its revolutionary ideology and partially because of the antagonistic style of its politics. The communists used this style to prevent its electorate from moving to its competitors.

The relationship between the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (before World War II) and the Labour Party (PvdA, after World War II) was always troublesome. The SDP split from the SDAP over ideological differences, orthodox Marxist, revolutionary politics versus revisionist and reformist politics. The social democrats saw the communists as insignificant while the communists taunted the social democrats by calling them &quot;servants to capitalism&quot; and &quot;social fascists&quot;. During the Cold War, the PvdA embraced Atlanticism, NATO and the alliance with the United States, while the CPN advocated stronger links with the USSR. The PvdA had the strongest anti-communists in its ranks. During the 1970s when a more radicalized PvdA advocated a large progressive coalition, they still excluded the CPN.

The relationship between left-wing splinter groups and the communists was notoriously bad. The CPH ignored the Revolutionary Socialist Party during its four-year term in the 1930s. The Pacifist Socialist Party, which was partially composed of those expelled from the CPN, was denounced as a party of agents of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The CPN methodically voted against proposals of the PSP, even when they supported them. In the 1980s the PSP and the CPN grew closer as they both campaigned against nuclear armament and both began to embrace New Left and libertarian politics. In 1984 they formed a common list for the European Election together with the green Political Party of Radicals (PPR) and the Greens. In the 1989 the CPN, PSP and PPR were joined by the left-wing Christian Evangelical People&#x27;s Party in the formation of the GroenLinks.

Relationships with the other parties whether liberal or Christian democratic were very poor.

==International comparison==
The CPN is one of the few communist parties to be formed before the Russian Revolution. It lies between the Northern European communist parties, like the Communist Party of Sweden and the Southern European communist parties, like the Italian Communist Party. Like its Italian counterparts, and unlike its Swedish counterparts it was methodically isolated in parliament. Like its Swedish counterparts, but unlike its Italian counterparts, it gained around 5% of the vote. Like its Italian counterpart it was closely linked to Moscow until the 1960s. In the 1970s, it became involved in New Left politics, like its Swedish counterpart.

<text>Ghedi (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. It received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on November 24, 2001.

Ghedi is known for a base of the Italian Air Force, Ghedi Air Base. It was also the site of the Palazzo Orsini, now demolished, a c.1515 doorway from which survives in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Ghedi experiences a four-season humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;).
== History ==
The town has been founded during the Early Middle Ages by the Longobards, as a small village defended by a fortified enclosure. This area is called &quot;Castle of Ghedi&quot;, in which arose the ancient Early Christian church, some small shacks and, since the High Middle Ages, the town hall. During the 14th century, the construction of structures outside the walls began and were formed four suburbs: &quot;Bazzina&quot;, &quot;Gazzolo&quot;, &quot;Borgonuovo&quot; and &quot;Malborgo&quot;.

The town, due to its location and its citadel, soon gained much strategic importance and, on August 15, 1453, it was the theater for the Battle of Ghedi, between Republic of Venice and Duchy of Milan. During this century, in the town opened a Franciscan convent (1465). In 1498, Venice granted in fief the town to Niccolò Orsini, count of Pitigliano and of Nola and commander of the Venetian army, which commanded to erect &quot;Palazzo Orsini&quot; and to place a funeral monument in the convent&#x27;s church.

Due to the development of increasingly powerful weapons, during the 16th century, Ghedi and its castle lost their strategic importance, and the town began to decline. During the 18th century, &quot;Palazzo Orsini&quot;, in state of decay, collapsed; its access portal was bought by the Victoria and Albert Museum of London, where it is still located. In the same century, the Niccolò Orsini&#x27;s funeral monument was bought by Santa Giulia Museum, where it is still located.

During the 20th century, Ghedi experienced economic growth, favored by construction of the Train Station (1893) and of the Ghedi Air Base (1909). In this period, the &quot;Cotonificio del Mella&quot; cotton mill opened with around 500 workers and became the largest factory in the town.

<doc id="1074373" wikidata="Q6144915" url="?curid=1074373" title="USS Flying Fish (SS-229)">
<text>USS &quot;Flying Fish&quot; (SS/AGSS-229), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first submarine and second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the flying fish. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; is credited with having sunk a total of 58,306 tons of Japanese shipping and received 12 battle stars for World War II service.

==Construction and commissioning==
The keel of &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was laid down on 6 December 1940 by the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 9 July 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy K. Kimmel, wife of Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was commissioned 10 December 1941, Lieutenant Commander Glynn &quot;Donc&quot; Donaho in command.

==December 1941–May 1942==
After shakedown training, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; transited the Panama Canal and departed Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone on 17 April 1942 bound for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. During her voyage, a United States Army Air Forces plane mistook her for a Japanese submarine and dropped depth charges on her, but she submerged and avoided damage. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 May 1942.

==First war patrol - Battle of Midway==
On 17 May 1942, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was ordered out to patrol west of Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, which was threatened by an expected Japanese attack. During the Battle of Midway of 3–7 June 1942, she and her sisters fanned out to scout and screen the atoll, at which she refitted from 9 to 11 June. Continuing her first full war patrol, she searched major shipping lanes in the seas around Japan and scored a hit on a Japanese destroyer off Formosa during the night of 3 July 1942. She returned to Midway to refit on 25 July 1942.

== Second war patrol, August – September 1942 ==
On 15 August 1942, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; departed on her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area north of Truk. On 28 August, only three days after arriving on station, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sighted the masts of a Japanese battleship (now known to be &quot;Yamato&quot;), guarded by two destroyers and air cover. She launched four torpedoes at this prime target, and two hits were detected by sonar. Immediately the counterattack began, and as &quot;Flying Fish&quot; prepared to launch torpedoes at one of the destroyers, rapidly closing to starboard, her commanding officer was blinded by a geyser of water thrown up by a bomb. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; went deep for cover. A barrage of 36 depth charges followed. When &quot;Flying Fish&quot; daringly came up to periscope depth 2 hours later, she found the two destroyers still searching, aided by two harbor submarine chasers and five aircraft. A great cloud of black smoke hung over the scene, persisting through the remaining hours of daylight. As &quot;Flying Fish&quot; upped periscope again a little later, a float plane dropped bombs directly astern, and the alert destroyers closed in. A salvo of torpedoes at one of the destroyers missed, and &quot;Flying Fish&quot; went deep again to endure another depth charging. Surfacing after dark, she once more attracted the enemy through excessive smoke from one of her engines, and again she was forced down by depth charges. Early in the morning of 29 August, she at last cleared the area to surface and charge her batteries. Possibly the torpedo explosions were premature; Japanese records show no warships lost on 28 August 1942.

Unshaken by this long day of attack, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; closed on Truk once more 2 September 1942, and attacked a 400-ton patrol vessel, only to see the torpedoes fail to explode upon hitting the target. The patrol ship ran down the torpedo tracks and began a depth charge attack, the second salvo of which damaged &quot;Flying Fish&quot; considerably. A second patrol ship came out to join the search; &quot;Flying Fish&quot; successfully evaded both opponents and cleared the area. Determinedly, she returned to the scene late the next night, and finding a single patrol vessel, sank her with two torpedoes just after midnight early on 4 September. Two hours later a second patrol craft came out, and as &quot;Flying Fish&quot; launched a stern shot, the Japanese ship opened fire, then swerved to avoid the torpedo. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; dived for safety, enduring seven depth charge runs by the patrol vessel. Two destroyers joined the patrol craft, and all three kept the submarine under attack for five hours. At last able to get clear, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 15 September.

== Third and fourth war patrols, October 1942 – February 1943 ==
&quot;Flying Fish&quot; cleared Pearl Harbor 27 October, headed for her patrol area south of the Marshall Islands. Three times on this third patrol she launched bold attacks on Japanese task forces, only to suffer the frustration of poor torpedo performance, or to score hits causing damage which postwar evaluation could not confirm. She arrived at Brisbane for refit on 16 December 1942.

On 6 January 1943, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; started her fourth war patrol, a reconnaissance of the Marianas. Along with gaining much valuable intelligence, she damaged the Japanese troop transport &quot;Tokai Maru&quot; (8359 tons) in Apra harbor, Guam, on 26 January, hit the Japanese troop transport &quot;Nagizan Maru&quot; (4391 tons) in Tinian&#x27;s Sunharon Roadstead 6 February, and sank the freighter &quot;Hyuga Maru&quot; (994 tons) in the presence of patrolling aircraft and surface escorts 16 February. She returned to Pearl Harbor 28 February.

== Crew casualties in Honolulu, 9 March 1943 ==
On 9 March 1943, three crewmen of the &quot;Flying Fish&quot; - Lyman Darol Williams, Leonard Mathis Sturms, and Harley Albert Kearney died after drinking wood alcohol at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki during their rest and recreation in Honolulu, Hawaii. The three seamen were the only casualties the crew of &quot;Flying Fish&quot; suffered during World War II.

== Fifth war patrol, March 1943 – May 1943 ==
&quot;Flying Fish&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor 24 March for her fifth war patrol, this one to the coast of Honshū, where the submarine was battered by foul weather. On 12 April, she closed the northern coast to make a daring attack on the cargo vessel Sapporo Maru No.12 (2865 tons) which she sank, again in the presence of scout planes and armed trawlers. Moving north to Hokkaidō, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; damaged a large freighter on 13 April, and two days later torpedoed the inter-island transport ship Seiryu Maru (1904 tons) which beached itself in a mass of flames. Continuing her bold inshore attacks, on 19 April &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sank the Japanese army cargo ship Amaho Maru (2774 tons), and in the Tsugaru Strait on 24 April, sent cargo ship Kasuga Maru (1374 tons) the bottom. On 1 May a small inter-island freighter was sunk, but an alert enemy antisubmarine group shook &quot;Flying Fish&quot; considerably before she could clear the area. She returned to Midway from this highly successful patrol 11 May.

== Sixth war patrol, June – July 1943 ==
After five grueling patrols Lieutenant Commander Donaho turned command over to Captain Frank T. Watkins. On her sixth patrol (2 June – 27 July), &quot;Flying Fish&quot; patrolled in the Volcano Islands and off Taiwan. Her first attacks, two against the same convoy, resulted in unconfirmed damage, but off Taiwan on 2 July, she blasted the stern off of the merchant passenger/troop transport &quot;Canton Maru&quot; (2822 tons) watching it sink. While Pearl Harbor-bound from her patrol area, she made a two-day chase for a fast convoy, but was forced by her dwindling fuel supply to break off the hunt. On 11 July she destroyed the sailing vessel Japanese guard boat &quot;Takatori Maru No.8&quot; (51 tons) with gunfire, leaving it aflame from stem to stern.

== Seventh war patrol, October – November 1943 ==
After a major overhaul at Pearl Harbor from 27 July to 4 October 1943, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sailed on her seventh war patrol, again with her original skipper , bound for the Palaus. Her first attack, 18 October, scored at least one hit on Japanese aircraft carrier Chūyō. A two-day tracking of a well-escorted convoy from 26 – 28 October resulted in the sinking of troop transport ship Nanman Maru (6550 tons), on 27 October and the damaging of two merchantmen before &quot;Flying Fish&quot; ran out of torpedoes. She arrived at Midway 6 November.

== Eighth, ninth, and tenth war patrols, November 1943 – July 1944 ==
&quot;Flying Fish&quot;&#x27;s eighth war patrol, the first to be commanded by Lieutenant Commander R. D. Risser, between Taiwan and the China coast from 30 November 1943 to 28 January 1944, found her sinking the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Ginyo Maru&quot; (8613 tons) laden with 6880 tons of maize, 600 tons of rice, 50 tons of beans, and 195 passengers on 16 December, taking 66 crewmen, 3 IJN gunners, and 118 passengers to the bottom, and fleet tanker Kyuei Maru (10,171 tons – entering service on 6 September 1943.) from convoy Hi-27 on 27 December. Her refit and retraining between patrols were held once more at Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Flying Fish&quot; sailed for her ninth war patrol 22 February for the waters off Iwo Jima. On 12 March, she sent the merchantman &quot;Taijin Maru&quot; (1924 tons) to the bottom, then closed the Okinawa shore and attacked a convoy in the early morning darkness of 16 March. The passenger/cargo ship &quot;Anzan Maru&quot; (5493 tons) was sunk and the tanker &quot;Teikon Maru&quot; (ex-German &quot;Winnetou&quot;), was damaged in this attack. Pressing on with her chase for six hours in the hope of finishing off the tanker, the submarine was detected and held down by aircraft and destroyers while the tanker escaped. On the afternoon of 31 March, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was attacked by a Japanese submarine, whose torpedoes she skillfully evaded. Bound for Majuro at the close of her patrol, on April Fool&#x27;s Day 1944, the submarine torpedoed and sank the freighter &quot;Minami Maru&quot; (2398 tons – formally the Norwegian &quot;Solviken&quot;). at Kitadaitōjima. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; closed out her patrol and arrived at Majuro 11 April 1944.

Clearing Majuro harbor 4 May, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; sailed for her tenth war patrol, coordinated with the assault on the Marianas scheduled to open the next month. First she covered shipping lanes between Ulithi, Yap, and Palau, coming under severe attack after one of her torpedoes exploded just outside the tubes on the night of 24 – 25 May when she was detected while attacking a four-ship convoy. At dawn, however, she had got back into position to sink the Japanese troop transport &quot;Taito Maru&quot; (4466 tons) loaded with 5,300 aviation gasoline cans, 2,500m3 of arms and 500-tons of cement, and the passenger/cargo ship &quot;Osaka Maru&quot; (3740 tons). The &quot;Osaka Maru&quot; was also out of Saipan bound for Palau in the same convoy, carrying 824 passengers and materials for the war effort. 97 passengers and all of the cargo went down with the ship.

Along with other American submarines, she then headed to take up a patrol station between the Palaus and San Bernardino Strait, from which she could scout any movement by the enemy fleet out of its base at Tawi in the Sulus while the Marines were landed on Saipan. On 15 June, the day of the invasion, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; spotted a Japanese carrier force emerging from San Bernardino Strait bound eastward. Her prompt report of this movement enabled a sister submarine, , to sink the carrier &quot;Shōkaku&quot; four days later while American carrier aircraft broke the back of Japanese naval aviation in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; remained on her scouting station until 23 June, then sailed for Manus and Brisbane, arriving there 5 July.

== Eleventh war patrol, October – November 1944 ==
On 1 August 1944, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was escorted out to sea from Brisbane, Australia, to begin her eleventh war patrol, this one taking her to Davao Gulf, the coast of Celebes, and along the shipping lanes from the Philippines to Halmahera. She departed Brisbane in the company with the submarine , which was to share a patrol area with her. On 8 August, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; and &quot;Flounder&quot; arrived in the Admiralty Islands and moored alongside the submarine tender to take on fuel. As &quot;Flying Fish&quot; proceeded to her patrol area on 9 August 1944, the U.S. Navy destroyer depth-charged her after she submerged to a depth of as &quot;Cogswell&quot; approached and did not respond to &quot;Cogswell&quot;&#x27;s sonar recognition signals. &quot;Cogswell&quot; set her depth charges to explode at and halted her attack after &quot;Flying Fish&quot; responded to the recognition signals. &quot;Flying Fish&quot; suffered no damage.

&quot;Flying Fish&quot; arrived in her patrol area off Manado, Celebes, on 14 August 1944 &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was held down much of the time by Japanese aircraft. After refueling at Mios Woendi from 29 August to 1 September 1944, she closed Celebes, where on 7 September she detected a concealed Japanese airstrip. Her report led to the airfield&#x27;s bombardment by Allied aircraft 11 days later. Through the remainder of her patrol she served on lifeguard duty for air strikes on Celebes. She concluded her patrol with her arrival at Midway on 18 October 1944.

== October 1944–May 1945==
&quot;Flying Fish&quot; departed Midway and proceeded to San Francisco, California, where she was equipped with naval mine detection and clearance equipment to enable her to penetrate the Sea of Japan. After testing her new gear she proceeded to Guam, which she reached on 18 May 1945.

== Twelfth war patrol, May – July 1945 ==
At Guam, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; joined a submarine task group for her 12th war patrol. She departed on 29 May 1945 for the heavily mined Tsushima Strait, entering the Sea of Japan 7 June. Then each of the task group&#x27;s submarines headed for her own assigned area, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; setting course north for the coast of Korea. On 10–11 June, in separate attacks, she sank two cargo ships, &quot;Taga Maru&quot; (2,220 tons) on the 10th and &quot;Meisei Maru&quot; (3,095 tons) on the 11th, taking aboard one survivor. Five days later she sank ten small craft with gunfire and forced two others to beach themselves. She completed her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 4 July 1945. Hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945.

== Post-World War II service ==

&quot;Flying Fish&quot; returned to Naval Submarine Base New London on 21 September 1945 to become flagship of Commander, Submarine Force, United States Atlantic Fleet (). During the next eight years, from her base at New London, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; conducted United States Naval Reserve training cruises in Long Island Sound and Block Island Sound, exercised off the Virginia Capes, trained men of foreign navies, joined in major operations in the Caribbean, and cruised to Canadian ports. She was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-229, on 29 November 1950.

On 11 January 1951, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; completed her duty as flagship and began to serve the Underwater Sound Laboratory in sonar experiments, notably testing a passive GHG sonar salvaged from the former German heavy cruiser in a large array surrounding her conning tower. On 29 February 1952, at 10:53, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; became the first American submarine to make 5,000 dives. On board for the event was a distinguished party headed by United States Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
Placed in commission in reserve on 31 December 1953, &quot;Flying Fish&quot; was decommissioned at New London on 28 May 1954 and was sold for scrapping 1 May 1959.

==Honors and awards==
Of &quot;Flying Fish&quot;&#x27;s twelve war patrols, all save the 11th were designated as &quot;successful&quot;. She is credited with having sunk a total of 58,306 tons of enemy shipping. She received 12 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Ansty is a village and civil parish in the Rugby Borough of Warwickshire, England, about northeast of Coventry city centre and 7 miles (13 km) south of Hinckley. Ansty is on the B4065, which used to be the main road between Coventry and Hinckley. The junction between the M6 and M69 motorways and A46 road is southwest of the village. The parish had a population of 299 at the 2021 Census.

The northern section of the Oxford Canal, once a major coal-carrying network and now a popular leisure resource, passes through the village. Ansty has been cited as &quot;the most boater-hostile village on the canals&quot; because of the huge number of &quot;no mooring&quot; signs.

==History==
The Domesday Book of 1086 mentions &quot;Anestie&quot; as part of the hundred of Brinklow. The main landowner was Lady Godiva. Ansty was part of the County of the City of Coventry from 1451 until that county was dissolved in 1842.

The Church of England parish church of Saint James has a 13th-century chancel. The arcade between the nave and north aisle is 14th century. Sir George Gilbert Scott rebuilt the rest of the church in 1856.

Ansty Hall, just outside the village, was built in 1678 for Richard Taylor, who had been on the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War. The house is arranged in seven bays and built of brick with stone quoins and pediment. It is now the Ansty Hall Hotel.

A cottage industry of weaving developed in the parish from early in the 18th century. This grew into a substantial ribbon-making trade early in the 19th century, but declined in the 1830s.

James Brindley completed the section of the Oxford Canal through Ansty in 1771. In November 1963 a high embankment on the towpath side gave way, spilling 10,000 tons of sand and clay onto adjoining land.

RAF Ansty, a Royal Air Force training base, operated nearby between 1936 and 1953. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, Armstrong Siddeley Motors had its development plant for gas turbines and aircraft rocket motors as well as the Gamma rocket motors used in the Black Knight and Black Arrow launchers. The plant is now the Ansty engineering works of Rolls-Royce. In 2013, Rolls-Royce announced the closure of the military part of the plant. The civil part of the plant remains unaffected.

In 2012, Ansty erected its first War Memorial, a black obelisk, after the hard work of local villagers headed by Chief Petty Officer Dean Bateman.

In 2017 London Electric Vehicle Company (part of the Geely Group) established a major production facility for EV taxis and vans 1.5 miles south of the village at Ansty Park (separated by the M6 motorway).

==Amenities==
Ansty has a gastropub restaurant, The Rose and Castle just beside the canal and The Ansty Club on Grove Road. There is also The Ansty Golf Club which is open to none members.

<text>Dietrich &quot;Dieter&quot; Wisliceny (13 January 1911 – 4 May 1948) was a member of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and one of the deputies of Adolf Eichmann, helping to organise and coordinate the large-scale deportations of the Jews across Europe during the Holocaust.

==Life==

Dieter was born in 1911 as the son of the lord of the manor (&quot;Rittergut Regulowken&quot;) Erich Wisliceny (d. 1928) and his wife Wally, née Paul, in East Prussia. In 1919, after losing the estate, the family moved to Silesia. 

After graduating from Gymnasium in Breslau, Wisliceny began studying theology in 1930 at the University of Breslau, but dropped out after one semester. 

On 1 October 1931, Wisliceny became a member of the NSDAP and of a formation of the SA. In 1934, he switched from the SA to the SS and became a member of the SD. Wisliceny eventually rose to the rank of &quot;SS-Hauptsturmführer&quot; (captain) in 1940; he worked in the Reich Security Head Office Referat IV B4 under Adolf Eichmann. 

During implementation of the Final Solution, his task was the ghettoization and liquidation of several important Jewish communities in Nazi-occupied Europe, including those of Greece, Hungary and Slovakia. Wisliceny also re-introduced the yellow star in occupied countries; the yellow star being used to distinguish Jews from non-Jews. 

Wisliceny was an important witness at the Nuremberg trials. His testimony would later prove important in the successful prosecution of Eichmann for his complicity in the Holocaust in Israel in 1961.

==Death==
Wisliceny was extradited to Czechoslovakia, where he was tried and hanged for war crimes in 1948.

==Awards and decorations (excerpt)==
* Honour Chevron for the Old Guard 
* Honour Sword of the Reichsführers-SS
* Danzig Cross, 2nd Class 
* NSDAP Long Service Award in Bronze (10 years) 
* SS Long Service Award, 3rd Grade (8 years) in 1942

<text>The Union of Needletrades, Industrial, and Textile Employees (UNITE, often stylized UNITE!) was a labor union in the United States clothing industry from 1995-2004. 

==History==
===UNITE-ILGWU/ACTWU Merger===
UNITE was formed in 1995 as a merger between the International Ladies&#x27; Garment Workers&#x27; Union (ILGWU) and the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU).

UNITE&#x27;s core industries were textile and apparel manufacturing, distribution, and retailing, but they also had locals involved in industrial laundry, and manufacturing in other industries.

Jay Mazur served as president of UNITE from its inception until his retirement in 2001. Bruce Raynor was later elected president, where he served until the HERE merger.

===UNITE HERE Merger===
In 2004, UNITE announced that it would merge with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union (HERE) to form UNITE HERE. In 2009 most of the apparel and laundry workers in UNITE HERE broke away to form a separate union known as Workers United, which affiliated with the Service Employees International Union.

<text>Iseo (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy, on the south shore of Lake Iseo. It is bounded by the communes of Provaglio d&#x27;Iseo, Sulzano, Polaveno and Paratico.

It has the first monument ever built of Giuseppe Garibaldi, erected in 1883.

==Main sights==
* Oldofredi Castle, built between the end of the 11th century and the beginning of the 12th century, on the site of the &quot;Torrazzo&quot;, a rock at the edge of the city. It is one of the best preserved fortified complexes of early medieval military history. This fortress has square corner towers, screened by quadrangular crossbars on an inclined base. It was named after the Ghibelline Oldofredi family from Iseo. The large tower of the southern wing is the eldest part. It has a square base of 10 metres, a height of 12 metres. Its walls are 2 metres thick. The castle was set afire by the troops of Frederick Barbarossa during his Italian war in the mid-12th century. It was restored by Giacomo Oldofredi in 1161. During the 13th and 14th century, a rectangular castle was added to the fortified building. The castle was then surrounded by a deep moat, carved out of the solid rock. In the 14th century the castle belonged to the Scaliger family of Verona. The castle lost much of its importance when the political control of the Republic of Venice became stronger. It was then bought by the Celeri family. Its upkeep became so expensive that in 1586 the castle was transformed into a monastery for Franciscan friars. The frescoes on some walls of the building date from the 17th-18th centuries. The friars were forced to leave the building in 1797 during the Napoleonic occupation. It became a private property and changed into a block of flats (some are still inhabited) and a spinning mill. The building was bought by the municipality of Iseo and restored in the 1960s. It is now used as a public library, a war museum and can be used for civil wedding services.
* Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Snow (Santuario Madonna della Neve) was built on the remains of the ancient church of St. Stephen, for popular devotion during the plague. On 15 April 1655 the foundation stone was laid for a new sanctuary after the miraculous healing of a man who crawled on all fours and suddenly could walk normally. He ascribed it his prayer to the fresco of the Holy Family in an aedicule on the wall surrounding the ancient church.

* Pieve di St. Andrea. It is believed that the church was founded in the 6th century by Bishop San Vigilio on the site of a Roman temple. It was subsequently reconstructed in the 12th century in Lombard style. Over the centuries the parish church was renovated several times. At the beginning of the 19th century Rodolfo Vantini renovated the interior in neo-classical style. The church is characterised by an unusual Romanesque bell tower incorporated into the centre of the façade. The church is so ornate and is regularly used for weddings. It is just a couple of minutes walk to the lake shore and also Garibaldi square, with the Garibaldi monument and &quot;Vantini&quot; Palace, the Town Hall. On the right-hand side of the portal there is a 14th-century Gothic arch by Giacomo Oldofredi. Inside there are frescoes by Angelo Inganni and one &quot;St Michael Archangel&quot; by Francesco Hayez. In the presbytery there are frescoes by Ponziano Loverini and Giuseppe Teosa.
*Garibaldi square, with the Garibaldi monument and &quot;Vantini Palace&quot;, the Town Hall.

<text>Barry Commoner (May 28, 1917 – September 30, 2012) was an American cellular biologist, college professor, and politician. He was a leading ecologist and among the founders of the modern environmental movement. He was the director of the Center for Biology of Natural Systems and its Critical Genetics Project. He ran as the Citizens Party candidate in the 1980 U.S. presidential election. His work studying the radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing led to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963.

== Early life ==
Commoner was born in Brooklyn, New York, on May 28, 1917, the son of Jewish immigrants from Russia. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in zoology from Columbia University in 1937 and his master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees from Harvard University in 1938 and 1941, respectively.

== Career in academia ==
After serving as a lieutenant in the US Navy during World War II, Commoner moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and he became an associate editor for &quot;Science Illustrated&quot; from 1946 to 1947. He became a professor of plant physiology at Washington University in St. Louis in 1947 and taught there for 34 years. During this period, in 1966, he founded the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems to study &quot;the science of the total environment&quot;. Commoner was on the founding editorial board of the &quot;Journal of Theoretical Biology&quot; in 1961.

In the late 1950s, Commoner became known for his opposition to nuclear weapons testing, becoming part of the team which conducted the Baby Tooth Survey, demonstrating the presence of Strontium 90 in children&#x27;s teeth as a direct result of nuclear fallout. In 1958, he helped found the Greater St. Louis Committee on Nuclear Information. Shortly thereafter, he established &quot;Nuclear Information&quot;, a mimeographed newsletter published in his office, which later went on to become &quot;Environment&quot; magazine. Commoner went on to write several books about the negative ecological effects of atmospheric (i.e., above-ground) nuclear testing. In 1970, he received the International Humanist Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union.

== Environmental books ==
===&quot;The Closing Circle&quot;===

In his 1971 bestselling book &quot;The Closing Circle&quot;, Commoner suggested that the US economy should be restructured to conform to the unbending laws of ecology. For example, he argued that polluting products (like detergents or synthetic textiles) should be replaced with natural products (like soap or cotton and wool). This book was one of the first to bring the idea of sustainability to a mass audience. Commoner suggested a left-wing, eco-socialist response to the limits to growth thesis, postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures. He had a long-running debate with Paul R. Ehrlich, author of &quot;The Population Bomb&quot; and his followers, arguing that they were too focused on overpopulation as the source of environmental problems, and that their proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because the cost would fall disproportionately on the poor. He believed that technological, and above all, social, development would lead to a natural decrease in both population growth and environmental damage.

One of Commoner&#x27;s lasting legacies is his four laws of ecology, as written in &quot;The Closing Circle&quot; in 1971. The four laws are:

# &quot;Everything is connected to everything else&quot;. There is one ecosphere for all living organisms and what affects one, affects all.
# &quot;Everything must go somewhere&quot;. There is no &quot;waste&quot; in nature and there is no &quot;away&quot; to which things can be thrown.
# &quot;Nature knows best&quot;. Humankind has fashioned technology to improve upon nature, but such change in a natural system is, says Commoner, &quot;likely to be detrimental to that system&quot;
# &quot;There is no such thing as a free lunch&quot;. Exploitation of nature will inevitably involve the conversion of resources from useful to useless forms.

===&quot;The Poverty of Power&quot;===
Commoner published another bestseller in 1976, &quot;The Poverty of Power&quot;. In that book, he addressed the &quot;three e&#x27;s&quot; that were plaguing the United States in the 1970s, the three e&#x27;s being the environment, energy, and the economy. &quot;First there was the threat to environmental survival; then there was the apparent shortage of energy; and now there is the unexpected decline of the economy.&quot; He argued that the three issues were interconnected: the industries that used the most energy had the highest negative impact on the environment. The focus on non-renewable resources as sources of energy meant that those resources were growing scarce, thus pushing up the price of energy and hurting the economy. Towards the book&#x27;s end, Commoner suggested that the problem of the three e&#x27;s is caused by the capitalistic system and can only be solved by replacing it with some sort of socialism.

===&quot;Making Peace with the Planet&quot;===
In 1990, Commoner published &quot;Making Peace With the Planet&quot;, an analysis of the ongoing environmental crisis in which he argues that the way we produce goods needs to be reconstrued.

==Poverty and population==
Commoner examined the relationship between poverty and population growth, disagreeing with the way that relationship is often formulated. He argued that rapid population growth of the developing world is the result of it not having adequate living standards, observing that it is poverty that &quot;initiates the rise in population&quot; before leveling off, not the other way around. Developing countries were introduced to the living standards of developed nations, but were never able to fully adopt them, thus preventing these countries from advancing and thereby decreasing the rate of their population growth.

Commoner maintained that developing countries are still &quot;forgotten&quot; to colonialism. These developing countries were, and economically remain, &quot;colonies of more developed countries&quot;. Because Western nations introduced infrastructure developments such as roads, communications, engineering, and agricultural and medical services as a significant part of their exploitation of the developing nations&#x27; labor force and natural resources, the first step towards a &quot;demographic transition&quot; was met, but other stages were not achieved because the wealth created in developing countries was &quot;shipped out&quot;, so to speak, to the colonizer nations, enabling the latter to achieve the more advanced &quot;levels of demographic transition&quot;, while the colonies continued on without achieving the second stage, which is population balancing.

&quot;Thus colonialism involves a kind of demographic parasitism: the second population-balancing phase of the demographic transition in the advanced country is fed by suppression of that same phase in the colony&quot;.
&quot;As the wealth of the exploited nations was diverted to the more powerful ones, their power, and with it their capacity to exploit increased. The gap between the wealth of nations grew, as the rich were fed by the poor&quot;. This exploitation of resources extracted from developing nations, aside from its legality, led to an unforeseen problem: rapid population growth. The demographer, Nathan Keyfitz, concluded that, &quot;the growth of industrial capitalism in the Western nations during the period 1800–1950 resulted in the development of a one-billion excess in the world population, largely in the tropics&quot;.

This is evident in the study of India and contraceptives, in which family planning failed to reduce the birth rate because people felt that &quot;in order to advance their economic situation&quot;, children were an economic necessity. The studies show that &quot;population control in a country like India depends on the economically motivated desire to limit fertility&quot;.

Commoner&#x27;s solution is that wealthier nations need to help exploited or colonized countries develop and &quot;achieve the level of welfare&quot; that developed nations have. This is the only path to a balanced population in these developing countries. Commoner states that the only remedy for the world population crisis, which is the outcome of the abuse of poor nations by rich ones, is &quot;returning to the poor countries enough of the wealth taken from them to give their peoples both the reason and the resources voluntarily to limit their own fertility&quot;.

His conclusion is that poverty is the main cause of the population crisis. If the reason behind overpopulation in poor nations is the exploitation by rich nations made rich by that very exploitation, then the only way to end it is to &quot;redistribute [the wealth], among nations and within them&quot;.

== 2000 Dioxin Arctic study ==
In September 2000, a study published by the North American Commission on Environmental Cooperation, led by Commoner, found that Inuit women in the Arctic in Nunavut, Canada were found to have high levels of dioxin in their breast milk. The study tracked the origin of the dioxins using computer models from the sources that produced it and found that the dioxin pollution in the Arctic originated from the United States. Out of 44,000 sources of dioxin polluters in the United States, they found that only 19 were contributing to greater than a third of the dioxin pollution in Nunavut. Out of these 19, Harrisburg&#x27;s incinerator was found to be the top source of dioxin pollution.
 He was a recipient of the 2002 Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage.

== Influence ==
&quot;Time&quot; magazine introduced a section on the environment in their February 1970 issue, featuring articles on the &quot;environmental crisis&quot;, and a quote from Richard Nixon&#x27;s State of the Union address, calling it, &quot;The great question of the &#x27;70s&quot;. Nixon said, &quot;Shall we surrender to our surroundings or shall we make our peace with nature and begin to make reparations for the damage we have done to our air, to our land and to our water?&quot;

The magazine called Commoner, the &quot;Paul Revere of ecology&quot; for his work on the threats to life from the environmental consequences of fallout from nuclear tests and other pollutants of the water, soil, and air. &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; cover represented a &quot;call to arms&quot;, to mobilize public opinion by appeals to conscience. The following month, the first Earth Day took place, which saw 20 million Americans demonstrating peacefully in favor of environmental reform, accompanied by several events held at university campuses across the US. The publications of Commoner are also considered influential in the decision of the Nixon administration in the following June to announce the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Clean Air Act of 1970.

== Environmental activism ==
In 1969, Commoner was one of the founders of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment, an independent citizens environmental advocacy organization. His early guidance for this nonprofit led to multiple lawsuits that were won to protect the environment.

In 1980, Commoner founded the Citizens Party to serve as a vehicle for his ecological message, and he ran for president of the United States in the 1980 US election. His vice presidential running mate was La Donna Harris, the Native-American wife of Fred Harris, a former Democratic senator from Oklahoma, although she was replaced on the ballot in Ohio by Wretha Hanson. His candidacy for president on the Citizens Party ticket won 233,052 votes (0.27 percent of the total).

After his presidential bid, Commoner returned to New York City and moved the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems to Queens College. He stepped down from that post in 2000. At the time of his death, Commoner was a senior scientist at Queens College.

== Personal life ==
After serving in World War II, Commoner married the former Gloria Gordon, a St. Louis psychologist. They had two children, Frederic and Lucy Commoner, and one granddaughter. Following a divorce, in 1980 he married Lisa Feiner, whom he had met in the course of her work as a public-TV producer.

== Death and legacy ==
Commoner died on September 30, 2012, in Manhattan, New York.

He was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.

In 2014, the Center for Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College was renamed The Barry Commoner Center for Health and the Environment.

<text>Peter Grimes, Op. 33, is an opera in three acts by Benjamin Britten, with a libretto by Montagu Slater based on the section &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, in George Crabbe&#x27;s long narrative poem &quot;The Borough&quot;. The &quot;borough&quot; of the opera is a fictional small town that bears some resemblance to Crabbe&#x27;s – and later Britten&#x27;s – home of Aldeburgh, Suffolk, on England&#x27;s east coast.

The work was conceived while Britten was living in the US in the early years of the Second World War and completed when he returned to Britain in 1943. It was first performed at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in London on 7 June 1945, conducted by Reginald Goodall, and was a critical and popular success. It is still widely performed, both in Britain and internationally, and has become part of the standard repertoire. Among the tenors who have performed the title role in the opera house, or on record, or both are Britten&#x27;s partner Peter Pears, who sang the part at the premiere, and Allan Clayton, Ben Heppner, Anthony Rolfe Johnson, Jonas Kaufmann, Philip Langridge, Stuart Skelton, Set Svanholm and Jon Vickers.

&quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot;, consisting of purely orchestral music from the opera, were published separately and are frequently performed as an orchestral suite. Another interlude, a passacaglia, was published separately and is also often performed, either together with the &quot;Sea Interludes&quot; or by itself.

==Background==
===US: 1941–1943===
In the early years of the Second World War, Benjamin Britten and his partner Peter Pears were living in the US. Britten&#x27;s compositions from his years there include the song cycle &quot;Les Illuminations&quot; (1940), the &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot; (1940) and his operetta, &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot; (1941). 
In 1941 Britten came across a transcript in the BBC&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Listener&quot; of a talk by E.M.Forster about the 18th-century Suffolk poet George Crabbe. It began, &quot;To talk about Crabbe is to talk about England&quot;. Britten was filled with nostalgic feelings about his native Suffolk. Pears found a copy of Crabbe&#x27;s works in a second-hand bookshop and Britten read the poem &quot;The Borough&quot;, which contained the tragic story of the Aldeburgh fisherman Peter Grimes. He said later, &quot;In a flash I realised two things: that I must write an opera, and where I belonged&quot;. He and Pears began sketching an operatic scenario drawing on &quot;The Borough&quot;. 

From the outset the characters and story of the libretto were only loosely based on Crabbe&#x27;s work. The Grimes of Crabbe&#x27;s poem is an outright bully, &quot;untouched by pity, unstung by remorse and uncorrected by shame&quot;. Three of his apprentices in succession have died before he is summoned to the Town Hall to account for his conduct, after which he is forbidden to employ another. He works alone until the ghosts of his victims begin to terrorise him and he sinks into madness and dies in bed. In Crabbe&#x27;s poem, Ellen Orford&#x27;s tale is completely separate from Grimes&#x27;s and they are not mentioned as meeting each other. The Rector, Swallow, and the proprietress of the Boar inn, &quot;Auntie&quot;, and her nieces derive from other sections of &quot;The Borough&quot;, but other characters in the opera, including Balstrode, Boles and Ned Keene, are not in Crabbe&#x27;s original.

While Britten and Pears were waiting for a passage back to England, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky asked the composer why he had not written an opera. Britten explained that doing so would necessitate putting all other work aside, which he could not afford to do. Koussevitzky arranged for the commissioning of the opera by the musical foundation he had recently set up. The fee was $1,000, and the opera was to be dedicated to the memory of Koussevitzky&#x27;s wife, who had recently died. Britten approached his friend the writer Christopher Isherwood, inviting him to write the libretto. Pleading pressure of work and some reservations about the effectiveness of the subject, Isherwood declined.

===London: 1943–1945===
During the voyage back to England, Pears continued to work on the scenario of the opera while Britten composed &quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot; and &quot;Hymn to St Cecilia&quot;. The story, and Grimes&#x27;s character, underwent substantial changes in the early stages of drafting. For a long time during the gestation of the work Britten conceived Grimes as a baritone role. Pears persuaded Britten to play down any emotional tie Grimes might feel to the apprentice, and play up his position as an outsider in an intolerant society. At first, Britten had Grimes murdering his apprentices rather than being at worst negligent. For some time the dénouement had Grimes on the marshes, going mad and dying there. An episode with smugglers was dropped and several characters were gradually eliminated as work progressed on the story. By the time Britten and Pears returned home in April 1943 the shape of the work was not greatly different from the final version, and to turn the scenario into a libretto Britten recruited an old friend, the writer Montagu Slater.
Slater was a journalist, novelist and playwright. Before the war Britten had composed incidental music for two short verse-plays of his. Eric Crozier, who worked closely with Britten, comments that the whole of the original text of the libretto – &quot;apart from six quatrains by Crabbe and the small phrase &#x27;Grimes is at his exercise&#x27;&quot; – is Slater&#x27;s work. He abandoned Crabbe&#x27;s rhyming couplets and allowed his text &quot;to reflect the diverse speech-rhythms of the individual Borough characters&quot;:

In Crozier&#x27;s view, Slater&#x27;s &quot;short interjectory sentences&quot; in the recitatives and the &quot;more expansive phrases&quot; of the arias are ideal for musical setting. In Slater&#x27;s hands the character of Grimes was further developed. In Pears&#x27;s words, Grimes is &quot;neither a hero nor a villain&quot;, but &quot;an ordinary, weak person who, being at odds with the society in which he finds himself, tries to overcome it and, in doing so, offends against the conventional code, is classed by society as a criminal, and destroyed as such. There are plenty of Grimeses around still, I think!&quot;

Discussions between composer and librettist, revisions and corrections took nearly eighteen months. In January 1944 Britten started writing the music and just over a year later it was complete. The premiere had been planned for Koussevitzky&#x27;s Tanglewood Festival, but the festival had been suspended for the duration of the war, and Koussevitzky waived his contractual rights and gave his blessing to Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera to stage the first performances, saying that the opera – which he thought the greatest since &quot;Carmen&quot; – belonged not to him but to the world.

Tyrone Guthrie, the general administrator of the Sadler&#x27;s Wells company, appointed his assistant Eric Crozier to stage the piece, and the latter, together with Britten, made adjustments to the libretto during rehearsals when Slater&#x27;s text proved unsuitable for singability or clarity. Slater resented this, and insisted on publishing his original version in 1946, as &quot;Peter Grimes and Other Poems&quot;. Crozier brought in Kenneth Green to design the costumes and sets, the latter being naturalistic and based on Aldeburgh.

==Performance history==
===Premiere===
Sadler&#x27;s Wells had been closed during the war, and the premiere of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;, on 7 June 1945, marked the reopening of the theatre. When Joan Cross, director of the company, announced the plan to reopen the house with &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; − herself and Pears in the leading roles − there were complaints from company members about supposed favouritism and the &quot;&quot; of Britten&#x27;s score. Yet when &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; opened it was hailed by public and critics; its box-office takings matched or exceeded those for &quot;La bohème&quot; and &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;, which were being staged concurrently by the company.

===Later London productions===
Sadler&#x27;s Wells and its successor, English National Opera, staged new productions in 1963, 1990 and 2009. Grimes was played by, respectively, Ronald Dowd, Philip Langridge and Stuart Skelton; the conductors were Charles Mackerras, David Atherton and Edward Gardner.

&quot;Peter Grimes&quot; was staged at the Royal Opera House in 1947, in a production by Guthrie, conducted by Karl Rankl, with Pears, Cross and Edith Coates reprising their roles from the Sadler&#x27;s Wells premiere. There have been four new productions at Covent Garden since then, directed by John Cranko (1953), Elijah Moshinsky (1975), Willy Decker (2004, a co-production with the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie, Brussels) and Deborah Warner (2022, a co-production with the Teatro Real, Madrid, the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera, Rome, and the Opéra National de Paris). The conductors were, respectively, Goodall, Colin Davis, Antonio Pappano and Mark Elder, and the title role was sung by Pears, Jon Vickers, Ben Heppner and Allan Clayton. In revivals of the earlier productions, Grimes was played by tenors including Richard Lewis, Richard Cassilly, Robert Tear, Langridge, and Anthony Rolfe Johnson.

===Regional British productions===
Productions by other British opera companies include Colin Graham&#x27;s 1968 staging for Scottish Opera, conducted by Alexander Gibson with Nigel Douglas as Grimes; Glyndebourne Festival&#x27;s first production of the work in 1992, directed by Trevor Nunn and conducted by Andrew Davis and, in revivals, Franz Welser-Most and Mark Wigglesworth; a 1999 version by Welsh National Opera, directed by Peter Stein and conducted by Carlo Rizzi with John Daszak as Grimes; and Opera North&#x27;s 2006 production, directed by Phyllida Lloyd and conducted by Richard Farnes with Jeffrey Lloyd-Roberts as Grimes. In the summer of 2013, to mark the centenary of Britten&#x27;s birth, the Aldeburgh Festival staged its first performance of &quot;Peter Grimes&quot;. It was played in its natural setting on the beach at Aldeburgh. Steuart Bedford conducted, and Alan Oke sang Grimes.

===American productions===
The American premiere of the work was given in August 1946 at Tanglewood, conducted by Koussevitzky&#x27;s protégé Leonard Bernstein, with William Horne in the title role. The Metropolitan Opera first staged the piece in 1948 with Frederick Jagel as Grimes. The house staged a new production in 1967, directed by Guthrie and conducted by Colin Davis, with Vickers as Grimes. A subsequent production, by John Doyle, was presented in 2008, conducted by Donald Runnicles, with Anthony Dean Griffey in the title role.

===Continental Europe===
One of the first productions of the work outside Britain was at the Royal Swedish Opera in March 1946, conducted by Herbert Sandberg, with Set Svanholm as Grimes. Productions in Basel, Antwerp and Zurich followed within weeks. The opera was given in Paris at the Opéra in 1981 directed by Moshinsky and conducted by John Pritchard, with Vickers in the title role and a largely Franco-British cast. A production by Graham Vick was staged at the Opéra Bastille in 2001, conducted by James Conlon, with Heppner as Grimes. A production by Richard Jones at La Scala, Milan in 2012 was conducted by Robin Ticciati, with John Graham-Hall as Grimes. In addition to the co-productions, above, between the Royal Opera and the Monnaie in Brussels, the Teatro Real in Madrid, the Teatro dell&#x27;Opera in Rome, and the Paris Opéra, productions included two in 2022: at the Vienna State Opera in a production directed by Christine Mielitz and conducted by Simone Young, with Jonas Kaufmann as Grimes, Lise Davidsen as Ellen Orford and Bryn Terfel as Balstrode; and the Bavarian State Opera in a production by Stefan Herheim, conducted by Gardner, with Skelton as Grimes, Rachel Willis-Sørensen as Ellen and Iain Paterson as Balstrode.

==Synopsis==
===Prologue===

A Suffolk coastal village, &quot;towards 1830&quot;.

Peter Grimes is questioned at an inquest over the death at sea of his apprentice. The townsfolk make it clear that they think Grimes is guilty and deserves punishment. The coroner, Mr Swallow, determines the boy&#x27;s death to be accidental so Grimes avoids a criminal trial. The Coroner advises Grimes not to get another apprentice – a proposal against which Grimes vigorously protests. As the court is cleared, Ellen Orford, the schoolmistress whom Grimes wishes to marry as soon as he gains the Borough&#x27;s respect, attempts to comfort Grimes as he rages against what he sees as the community&#x27;s unwillingness to give him a true second chance.

===Act 1===

The same, some days later

After the first orchestral Interlude (titled, in the &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; concert version, &quot;Dawn&quot;), the chorus, who constitute &quot;the Borough&quot;, sing of their weary daily round and their relationship with the sea and the seasons. Grimes calls for help to haul his boat ashore, but is shunned by most of the community. Belatedly, retired skipper Balstrode and the apothecary, Ned Keene, assist Grimes by turning the capstan. Keene tells Grimes that he has found him a new apprentice (named John) from the workhouse. Nobody will volunteer to fetch the boy, until Ellen offers (&quot;Let her among you without fault...&quot;).

As a storm approaches, most of the community – after securing windows and equipment – take shelter in the pub. Grimes stays out, and alone with Balstrode confesses his ambitions: to make his fortune with a &quot;good catch&quot;, buy a good home and marry Ellen Orford. Balstrode suggests &quot;without your booty [Ellen] will have you now&quot;, only to provoke Grimes&#x27;s furious &quot;No, not for pity!&quot; Balstrode abandons Grimes to the storm, as the latter ruminates &quot;What harbour shelters peace?&quot; The storm then breaks with a vengeance (second orchestral Interlude).

In the pub, tensions are rising due both to the storm and to the fiery Methodist fisherman, Bob Boles, getting increasingly drunk and lecherous after the pub&#x27;s main attraction, the two &quot;nieces&quot;. Grimes suddenly enters (&quot;Now the Great Bear and Pleiades...&quot;), and his wild appearance unites almost the entire community in their fear and mistrust of his &quot;temper&quot;. Ned Keene saves the situation by starting a round (&quot;Old Joe has gone fishing&quot;). Just as the round reaches a climax, Ellen arrives with the apprentice, both drenched. Grimes immediately sets off with the apprentice to his hut, despite the terrible storm.

===Act 2===

The same, some weeks later

On a sunny Sunday morning (the Third Orchestral Interlude), while most Borough townspeople are at church, Ellen talks with John the apprentice. She is horrified to find a bruise on his neck. When she confronts Grimes about it, he brusquely dismisses it as an accident. Growing angry at her concern and interference, he strikes her and runs off with the boy. This does not go unseen: first Keene, Auntie, and Bob Boles, then the chorus comment on what has happened, the latter developing into a mob which sets off to investigate at Grimes&#x27;s fisherman&#x27;s hut. As they march off, Ellen, Auntie, and the nieces sing despairingly of the town&#x27;s menfolk. The Fourth Orchestral Interlude (Passacaglia) follows as the scene changes. 

At the hut, Grimes impatiently demands John change out of his Sunday clothes and into fisherman&#x27;s gear. Though it is a Sunday he hastily prepares to set out to fish as he has seen a large school of herring. Grimes becomes lost in his memories of his previous apprentice, reliving the boy&#x27;s death of thirst. When he hears the mob of townspeople approaching, he quickly snaps back to reality. He is angry and defiant, stirred by a paranoid belief that John has been gossiping with Ellen, so provoking the anger of the town against him. He warns John to be careful as they climb down the cliff to the boat, but in their haste the boy slips to his death below. When the mob reaches the hut, Grimes and the apprentice are not to be found, so they disperse, curious and suspicious.

===Act 3===

The same, two days later, night in the Borough (&quot;Moonlight&quot; in the &quot;Sea Interludes&quot;).

At a town dance, Mrs Sedley tries to convince the authorities that Grimes is a murderer. Ellen and Captain Balstrode confide in each other: Grimes has disappeared, and Balstrode has discovered a jersey washed ashore. Ellen recognises it as one she had knitted for John. Mrs Sedley overhears this and, with the knowledge that Grimes has returned, whips up another vigilante mob. Singing &quot;Him who despises us we&#x27;ll destroy&quot;, the villagers march off in search of Grimes. (The sixth interlude, not included in the concert version of the &quot;Sea Interludes&quot;, covers the change of scene.)

While the townspeople can be heard off-stage hunting for him, Grimes appears onstage singing a monologue, interspersed by cries from the mob and by a mournful fog horn (a solo tuba). The death of his second apprentice has shattered Grimes who sounds panicked, distracted and unfocused. Ellen and Balstrode discover him before the furious townspeople get there, and the sea captain advises Grimes that the best thing he can do is sail out to sea and drown himself by scuppering his boat. Silently, Grimes walks out. The next morning life in the Borough begins as usual as if nothing has happened, though there is a report from the coastguard of a boat seen sinking far off the coast. This is dismissed by Auntie as &quot;one of these rum-ours&quot;.

==&quot;Sea Interludes&quot;==
To cover the scene changes during the opera Britten wrote six orchestral interludes. Five of them have been published separately. The &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot;, Op 33a, is a suite of about 17 minutes&#x27; duration, comprising the first, third, fifth and second interludes from the opera, with the titles &quot;Dawn&quot;, &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot;. The fourth interlude, a passacaglia, has been published separately as Op 33b, and is sometimes appended to the &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; in concert and recordings. Britten conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the first performance of the suite at the Cheltenham Festival, a week after the opera&#x27;s premiere; the London premiere was at the Proms, in August 1945, and the five interludes were conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham in October 1945.

==Critical reception==
===First productions===
In &quot;The Observer&quot;, William Glock rated the first act less convincing than the other two, but found the opera as a whole &quot;a most thrilling work&quot;, displaying Britten&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot;. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;&#x27;s critic, William McNaught, considered the music &quot;full of vivid suggestion and action, sometimes rising to a kind of white-hot poetry&quot;, but thought the libretto insufficiently &quot;operatic&quot; – &quot;overloaded with scrappy and not always telling incident&quot;. &quot;The Scotsman&#x27;s&quot; critic took a different view, calling the work &quot;that rare thing – a piece of perfect collaboration between librettist and composer&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Times&quot; found the use of a single spoken line for Balstrode at a key point intrusive in an otherwise through-composed score, but praised Britten&#x27;s &quot;effortless originality&quot; and &quot;orchestral music of diabolical cunning&quot;.

After the American premiere, the critic Douglas Watt opened his review &quot;&quot;Peter Grimes&quot; has greatness&quot;, and called the work &quot;an opera for our time, brilliantly conceived and executed&quot;, with the &quot;breathtaking pleasure&quot; of the music matched by &quot;the strong and lovely libretto&quot;, though he predicted that if an impresario succeeded in staging the piece on Broadway &quot;it will be met with much intolerance and displeasure by audiences unprepared for its surprising magnificences&quot;. In &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Cyrus Durgin praised the young Bernstein for bringing out &quot;the drive and dissonance of an opera which is far from &#x27;tuneful&#x27; in the conventional sense&quot; and rated the work &quot;a step forward for opera in this country, and anywhere for that matter&quot;.

===Later assessments===
&quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; describes &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; as &quot;a powerful allegory of homosexual oppression&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called it one of &quot;the true operatic masterpieces of the 20th century&quot;; the composer&#x27;s own contemporary (1948) summation of the work was &quot;a subject very close to my heart – the struggle of the individual against the masses. The more vicious the society, the more vicious the individual&quot;. In a 1963 analysis of the opera in &quot;Music &amp; Letters&quot;, J. W. Garbutt contended that Britten&#x27;s &quot;inventive genius&quot; and the richness of the score led the listener to suspend disbelief, but that Slater&#x27;s libretto failed to reconcile the violent and the visionary in Grimes&#x27;s character and conduct. In a retrospective consideration of the opera in 1972, Peter Garvie argued in &quot;Tempo&quot; that although it had seemed uniquely new when it first appeared, it was in fact &quot;a great but final reincarnation of more or less traditional opera&quot;, and that it holds no promise of redemption for the characters, unlike Britten&#x27;s later operas.

In &quot;The University of Toronto Quarterly&quot; in 2005, Allan Hepburn considered the various views of previous commentators on the extent to which homosexuality is relevant to the plot of the opera. He notes that in Peter Conrad&#x27;s analysis, &quot;Grimes the boy-killer is the homosexual outcast, looking to Ellen Orford to effect his redemption, even his cure&quot;, and that for Philip Brett Britten&#x27;s operas are &quot;preoccupied with the social experience of homosexuality&quot;, but Hepburn concludes that Grimes can be seen in several different ways:
In 2020 Rupert Christiansen wrote that &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; can be labelled a &quot;folk&quot; opera, to the extent that:

Christiansen also remarks on &quot;the sharp, Dickensian characterisations&quot; of the various inhabitants of the Borough, showing the composer&#x27;s exceptional gift for setting the English language to music.

<text>Thành Thái (, ; 14 March 1879 – 20 March 1954) born Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Lân (阮福寶嶙), was the son of Vietnamese Emperor Dục Đức and Empress Dowager Từ Minh. He reigned as emperor for 18 years, from 1889 to 1907. Thành Thái was one of the three &quot;patriotic emperors&quot; in Vietnamese history, along with Hàm Nghi and Duy Tân (his son), for their actions and views against French colonial rule in Vietnam.

==Biography==
=== Early life===
While the emperor Tự Đức was alive, Prince Quang Thái was placed under house arrest with his family for having connections with those who opposed him. When the emperor Đồng Khánh died, however, the French colonial authorities and the high-ranking mandarins decided that Quang Thái was the ideal successor and enthroned him as the new Vietnamese emperor, Emperor Thành Thái.

At the age of 10, Thành Thái was recognized as being very intelligent and was already realizing that the French were keeping watch over him through palace spies. Whereas Đồng Khánh had tried to be friendly with the French, Emperor Thành Thái took a course of passive-resistance. Although he refrained from outright rebellion (which would have been political suicide), he made his feelings clear in other ways, symbolic gestures and biting remarks. He was also a man of the people, and a monarch who cared deeply for his country. The emperor would often slip out of the Forbidden City dressed in the clothes of a commoner to talk with his people directly and see how they were being affected by government policies.

===Opposing French authority===
To show that he was friendly with Western civilization, Thành Thái was the first Vietnamese monarch to cut his hair in the French style and learn to drive a car. He encouraged French-style education, but maintained bitter feelings over their control of his country. He also supported numerous building projects and took an interest in the everyday lives of his subjects. When traveling among his people, he would hold impromptu &quot;town hall meetings&quot; where the Emperor sat on a mat with his subjects in a circle around him, discussing the issues of the day and hearing their point of view.
Slowly, as the emperor began to realize how thoroughly his palace had been infiltrated with French spies, he had to feign insanity to escape their constant scrutiny. With his enemies believing he was a harmless lunatic, Thành Thái was able to push more forcefully for Vietnamese autonomy while waiting for the right time to overthrow the French colonial rule. He was on his way to join a resistance movement in China when he was arrested by French forces who declared him insane and forced the Emperor to abdicate.

In 1907, his son was installed as Emperor Duy Tân. Thành Thái was exiled first to Vũng Tàu in South Vietnam and when Duy Tân rebelled against the French they were both exiled to Réunion Island in 1916.

Unlike Hàm Nghi, the lives of Thành Thái and Duy Tân were tough. They even had no money to pay for rent. In 1925, Emperor Khải Định knew his situation and sent 1,000 piastres to him. Khải Định later occasionally gave him money.

He never gave up hope for the liberation of his country. In May 1947, he was allowed to return home, but was kept under house arrest in Vũng Tàu. He died in Saigon on 24 March 1954 and was buried on the grounds of An Lang (Tomb of Duc Duc) in an old commune, Hương Thủy district, Thừa Thiên Huế Province, at the age of 75.

There are now roads in Vietnam named in his honour.

<text>Louis Jay Pearlman (June 19, 1954 – August 19, 2016) was an American music manager and scam artist. He was the person behind many successful 1990s boy bands, having formed and funded the Backstreet Boys. After their massive success, he then developed NSYNC. 

In 2006, he was accused of running one of the largest and longest-running Ponzi schemes in United States history, leaving more than $300 million in debts. After attempting to evade capture, Pearlman was apprehended in Bali, Indonesia in June 2007. He pled guilty to conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during bankruptcy proceedings. In 2008, Pearlman was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He died in federal custody in 2016.

==Early life==
Lou Pearlman was born and raised in Queens, New York, the only child of Jewish parents Hy Pearlman, who ran a dry cleaning business, and Reenie Pearlman, a school lunchroom aide. He was a first cousin of the musician Art Garfunkel.

Pearlman&#x27;s home at Mitchell Gardens Apartments was located across from Flushing Airport, where he and childhood friend Alan Gross would watch blimps take off and land. According to his autobiography, &quot;Bands, Brands, &amp; Billions&quot;, it was during this period that he used his position on his school newspaper to earn credentials and get his first ride in a blimp. This is disputed by Gross, who claims he was the school reporter, and allowed Pearlman to tag along.

Garfunkel&#x27;s fame and wealth helped inspire Pearlman&#x27;s own interest in the music business. As a teenager he managed a band, but when success in music proved elusive, he turned his attention to aviation. During his first year as a student at Queens College, Pearlman wrote a business plan for a class project based on the idea of a helicopter taxi service in New York City. By the late 1970s, he had launched the business based on his business plan, starting with one helicopter. He persuaded German businessman Theodor Wüllenkemper, a Luftwaffe veteran, to train him on blimps and subsequently spent some time at Wüllenkemper&#x27;s facilities in West Germany learning about the airships.

==Suspicions of insurance fraud and pump and dump==
Returning to the U.S., Pearlman formed Airship Enterprises Ltd, which leased a blimp to Jordache before actually owning one. He used the funds from Jordache to construct a blimp, which promptly crashed. The two parties sued each other, and seven years later Pearlman was awarded $2.5 million in damages.

On the advice of a friend, Pearlman started a new company, Airship International, taking it public to raise the $3 million he needed to purchase a blimp, falsely claiming that he had a partnership with Wüllenkemper. He leased the blimp to McDonald&#x27;s for advertising.

Pearlman then relocated Airship International to Orlando, Florida, in July 1991, where he signed MetLife and SeaWorld as clients for his blimps.

Airship International suffered when one of its clients left and three of the aircraft crashed. The company&#x27;s stock, which had once been pumped up to $6 a share, dropped to a price of three cents a share, and the company was shut down.

After he took the company public in 1985, Pearlman became personally and professionally close to Jerome Rosen, a partner at small-cap trading firm Norbay Securities. Based in Bayside, Queens, and frequently in trouble with regulators, Norbay actively traded Airship stock. This sent Airship&#x27;s stock price consistently higher, enabling Pearlman to sell hundreds of thousands of shares and warrants at ever-higher prices. However, Airship was reporting little revenue, cash flow or net income. In return for keeping his penny stock liquid, Pearlman allegedly paid Rosen handsome commissions, according to a mutual friend, that reached into &#x27;the tens of thousands of dollars&#x27; per trade.

==Entertainment industry career==
Pearlman became fascinated with the success of the New Kids on the Block, who had made hundreds of millions of dollars in record, tour and merchandise sales. He started Trans Continental Records in early 1992 with the intent of mimicking their boy band business model. The record label&#x27;s first band, the Backstreet Boys, consisted of five unknown performers selected by Pearlman in a $3 million talent search.

Management duties were assigned to a former New Kids on the Block manager, Johnny Wright, and his wife Donna. The Backstreet Boys became the best-selling boy band of all time, with record sales of 130 million, hitting gold, platinum, and diamond in 45 countries. Pearlman and the Wrights were then introduced to NSYNC, which was formed by Chris Kirkpatrick. Pearlman and the Wrights funded and managed NSYNC in a very similar fashion, selling over 70 million records globally.

With these two major successes under his belt, Pearlman had become a music mogul. Other boy bands managed by Pearlman were O-Town (created during the ABC–MTV reality television series &quot;Making the Band&quot;), LFO, Take 5, Natural, Marshall Dyllon (co-created with country music artist Kenny Rogers) and US5, as well as the girl groups Solid HarmoniE and Innosense, co-managed with Lynn Harless (the mother of NSYNC band member Justin Timberlake). Other artists on the Trans Continental label included Aaron Carter, Jordan Knight, Smilez &amp; Southstar and C-Note. 

Pearlman also owned the Church Street Station entertainment complex in Orlando, including a recording studio he called Trans Continental Studios, and a dance studio near Disney World named O-Town.

In 2002, Pearlman and Wes Smith co-wrote &quot;Bands, Brands and Billions: My Top 10 Rules for Making Any Business Go Platinum.&quot;

===Band lawsuits===
With the exceptions of US5 and Marshall Dyllon, all of the musical acts that worked with Pearlman sued him in federal court for misrepresentation and fraud. All cases against Pearlman either have been won by those who have brought lawsuits against him or have been settled out of court.

The members of Backstreet Boys were the first to file a lawsuit against Pearlman, feeling that their contract—under which Pearlman collected as both manager and producer—was unfair, because Pearlman was also paid as a sixth member of the Backstreet Boys (i.e., one-sixth of the band&#x27;s own income). The band&#x27;s dissatisfaction began when member Brian Littrell hired a lawyer to determine why the group had received only $300,000 for all of their work while Pearlman and his record label had made millions. Fellow boy band NSYNC was having similar issues with Pearlman, and its members soon followed suit.

At the age of 14, Aaron Carter filed a lawsuit in 2002 that accused Pearlman and Trans Continental of cheating him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars and of racketeering in a deliberate pattern of criminal activity. This suit was later settled out of court.

===Talent scouting scam scandal===
In September 2002, Pearlman purchased Mark Tolner&#x27;s internet-based talent company, Options Talent Group (formerly Emodel and Studio 58), which would subsequently go through several names, including Trans Continental Talent (TCT), Wilhelmina Talent Scouting, Web Style Network (WSN), Fashion Rock, and Talent Rock. Regardless of the name, all incarnations were based on the business model used by Emodel founder Ayman &quot;Alec&quot; Difrawi, himself a convicted con artist, who played a principal role in running Options/TCT/WSN and setting up Fashion Rock. The companies received unfavorable press attention, ranging from questions about their business practices to outright declarations that they were scams. After Hotjobs and Monster.com pulled over a thousand of the company&#x27;s job ads from their boards, they were further advertised on the Difrawi-founded &quot;Industry Magazine&quot; website.

The Better Business Bureau&#x27;s opinion about Options/TCT/WSN was negative, citing a &quot;pattern of complaints concerning misrepresentation in selling practices&quot;. The New York State Consumer Protection Board issued an alert, naming it the largest example they had found of a photo mill scam. California Department of Industrial Relations &quot;Division of Labor Standards Enforcement&quot;, also called &quot;California Labor Commissioner&#x27;s Office&quot; declared Options/TCT/WSN in violation of California law, and several state agencies were reported to be investigating the company. In Florida, around 2,000 complaints were filed with the then-Attorney General Charlie Crist and the BBB, and an investigation was started by Assistant Attorney General Dowd. However, as the newly appointed Assistant AG MacGregor was unable to find &quot;any substantial violations&quot;, no charges were filed. Further complicating matters was the fact that the company had since declared bankruptcy, &quot;leaving no deep pockets from which to collect damages.&quot;

By June 2004, Fashion Rock, LLC had filed a civil suit for defamation against some who had criticized Pearlman&#x27;s talent businesses. The case was dismissed and closed in 2006. One of the accused, a Canadian consumer-fraud expert Les Henderson, successfully pursued a libel lawsuit against Pearlman, Tolner, El-Difrawi and several others.

Fashion Rock, LLC lived on until February 2, 2007, when its assets were sold in Pearlman&#x27;s bankruptcy proceeding. Difrawi continued filing lawsuits that were all and was most recently running Expand, Inc. dba Softrock.org aka Employer Network, from the same address as former TCT.

== Ponzi scheme ==
In 2006, investigators discovered Pearlman had perpetrated what was then thought to be the longest-running Ponzi scheme in American history and had defrauded investors out of more than $1 billion, out of which $300 million is still missing. For more than 20 years, Pearlman had enticed individuals and banks to invest in Trans Continental Airlines Inc., TransCon Records, and both companies&#x27; parent, Trans Continental International Inc. All three companies existed only on paper—at least until Lou Pearlman&#x27;s boy bands took off and TransCon Records was profiting from signed acts. After the success of the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, he turned the groups and their fame into the engine that further expands his Ponzi scheme. Pearlman used falsified Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, AIG and Lloyd&#x27;s of London documents to win investors&#x27; confidence in his program titled Employee Investment Savings Account, and he used fake financial statements created by the fictitious accounting firm Cohen and Siegel to secure bank loans.

===Investigation and arrest===
In February 2007, Florida regulators announced that Pearlman&#x27;s Trans Continental Savings Program was indeed a massive fraud, and the state took possession of the company. Most of the at least $95 million which had been collected from investors was gone. Orange County Circuit Judge Renee Roche ordered Pearlman and two of his associates, Robert Fischetti and Michael Crudelle, to bring back to the United States &quot;any assets taken abroad which were derived from illegal transactions.&quot;

Following a flight from officials, Pearlman had been seen in Orlando in late January 2007, and in early February in Germany, including an appearance on German television on February 1. Reportedly he was seen in Russia, Belarus, Israel, Spain, Panama, and Brazil. In early February, an attorney in Florida received a letter from Pearlman sent from Bali. Pearlman was arrested in Indonesia on June 14, 2007, after being spotted by a tourist couple from Germany.
He was living in a tourist hotel in Nusa Dua in Bali. Pearlman was indicted by a federal grand jury on June 27, 2007. Specifically, he was charged with conspiracy, money laundering, and filing false bankruptcy.

===Conviction and sentencing===
After his conviction and five days before his sentencing in May 2008, Pearlman requested a telephone and an Internet connection two days a week to continue to promote bands. Federal judge G. Kendall Sharp of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida rejected the request.

On May 21, 2008 Sharp sentenced Pearlman to 25 years in prison on charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding. Pearlman could reduce his prison time by one month for every million dollars he helped a bankruptcy trustee recover. He also ordered individual investors to be paid before institutions in distributing any eventual assets.

===Bankruptcy===
Pearlman and his companies were forced into involuntary bankruptcy in March 2007. Trustees and lenders intended to auction off Pearlman&#x27;s assets and personal belongings, including a mansion full of well-known works of art and priceless memorabilia. They quickly discovered the art and memorabilia was mostly fake. What could be sold was auctioned through eBay and a traditional bankruptcy auction house.

Church Street Station, a historic train station in downtown Orlando which Pearlman had purchased in 2002, was sold at a bankruptcy auction in April 2007 for $34 million. Several of Pearlman&#x27;s belongings, including his college degrees, were purchased by &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; journalist and film critic Nathan Rabin during the eBay auction.

==Cronin claim==
In a 2009 interview with Howard Stern, Rich Cronin, the former lead singer of LFO, said that he had only received a fraction of the money owed to him from record sales. Cronin also claimed that Pearlman had &quot;wanted to bang everyone&quot; and had attempted to seduce him multiple times. Those claims were never confirmed.

Fellow LFO band member Brad Fischetti, however, continued to refer to Pearlman as a friend, and expressed sadness at the news of his arrest, imprisonment, and death. 

Nick Carter, when asked if the claim was true, suggested that bitterness might be a motivating factor for the claim.

In an interview conducted by the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, former NSYNC member Lance Bass, when asked about the claim, stated that Pearlman had never behaved inappropriately with them.

==Death==
In 2008, Pearlman began his prison sentence with a projected release date of March 24, 2029. However, he suffered a stroke in 2010 while incarcerated. He was diagnosed with an infection of a heart valve. Pearlman had surgery to replace a heart valve a few weeks before his death. The prison took him to a hospital where he was scheduled for another surgery. 

Pearlman died while still in custody at the Federal Correctional Institution in Miami, Florida, on August 19, 2016. He was buried ten days later on August 29, in his family’s burial area. He was 62 years old.

== Documentaries ==
Pearlman was featured in the third season of &quot;American Greed&quot; in the episode called &quot;Boy Band Mogul&quot; in 2009.

The documentary &quot;The Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story&quot;, produced by Lance Bass; member of Pearlman&#x27;s boy band &quot;NSYNC&quot;, premiered at SXSW on March 13, 2019. It was released on YouTube Premium in April 2019.

On December 13, 2019, Pearlman was the subject of an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot; titled &quot;The Hitman: From Pop to Prison&quot;.

On July 24, 2024, Pearlman&#x27;s story was featured on Netflix&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Dirty Pop: The Boy Band Scam&quot;.

Bryan Burrough, interviewed for the episode, noted of this last that he had not expected to hear about sexual improprieties, and ascribed the lack of willingness to come forward about them to Pearlman&#x27;s repeated usage of the tactic of veiled threats to intimidate those who would have otherwise done so.</text><links>

<doc id="1074427" wikidata="Q5641738" url="?curid=1074427" title="Half Past Human">
<text>Half Past Human is a fixup science fiction novel by American author T. J. Bass, published in 1971. Two short stories were combined and fleshed out to form this novel: &quot;Half Past Human&quot;, first published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in December 1969, and &quot;G.I.T.A.R.&quot;, first published in &quot;If&quot; in November and December 1970. The novel belongs to the Hive series, which also includes &quot;The Godwhale&quot;.

Bass&#x27; Hive series of stories are replete with obvious and not-so-obvious references to nomenclature commonly used in pathology, including eponymic puns (note a male character&#x27;s observation of a female character&#x27;s attractive &quot;Howell-Jolly body&quot;).

&quot;Half Past Human&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1971.

==Plot summary==

Bass&#x27; future Earth is an environment in which the sum of the biota serves as its food chain. Human science has created the four-toed Nebish, a pallid, short-lived and highly programmable humanoid who has had the elements that do not facilitate an underground Hive existence (aggression, curiosity, etc.) bred out of it. The five-toed humans (called buckeyes) wander the biofarms that keep the trillions of Earth&#x27;s Nebish population fed. All vertebrates other than man and rat are extinct, so meat comes from other humans (and the occasional rat). The conflict between the Hives and the roving bands of five-toed original Humans, who are reduced to savagery and hunted like vermin by Hive Security, forms the backdrop of this novel.

The story begins as Old Man Moon and his dog Dan wander the fields. They are genetic experiments with their biological clocks stopped. They encounter Toothpick, a companion cyber from the days when technology was more advanced before the hive decline. Toothpick urges Moon to pick him up, but Moon does not like cybers—they work for the Hive. Toothpick promises food and when he makes good on his promise that an electrical storm will short circuit the agromecks from reporting his pilfering of the gardens, Moon considers Toothpick&#x27;s offer of companionship. Toothpick explains he is a companion cyber, and when he promises new teeth for Moon and Dan, Moon agrees and the three set off on Toothpick&#x27;s unstated mission.

Something strange is happening, as the primitive buckeyes are showing signs of a purpose whose goal is unclear and probably dangerous to the balance of the Hive. There seems to be a third party stirring the pot, campaigning in a relentlessly successful battle with the computer minds that keep this &quot;brave new world&quot; in balance. Agendas beyond the ken of their protagonists begin to come into play, and an epic battle between the Four- and the Five-toed is looming.

<doc id="1074435" wikidata="Q540891" url="?curid=1074435" title="Nielsen Holdings">
<text>Nielsen Holdings plc (or Nielsen) is an American media audience measurement firm. Nielsen operates in over 100 countries and employs approximately 15,000 people worldwide.

For most of its history, the company was known for its two subsidiaries, Nielsen Media Research, which was responsible for TV ratings, and AC Nielsen, which was responsible for consumer shopping trends and box-office data. Nielsen Media Research later evolved into Global Media division and the AC Nielsen later evolved into Global Connect division. The company later decided to retain its Global Media division and divested the Global Connect division (NielsenIQ, the former AC Nielsen) to private equity firm Advent International in March 2021.

The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and used to be a component of the S&amp;P 500.

==History==
===Formation===
Nielsen was founded in 1923 by Arthur C. Nielsen, Sr., who invented an approach to measuring competitive sales results that made the concept of &quot;market share&quot; a practical management tool. The holding company was originally incorporated in the Netherlands and later was purchased on May 24, 2006, by a consortium of private equity firms.

===Merger and listing===
In January 2011, Nielsen consummated an initial public offering of common stock and, subsequently, started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;NLSN&quot;. On August 31, 2015, Nielsen N.V., a Dutch public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, merged with Nielsen Holdings plc, by way of a cross-border merger under the European Cross-Border Merger Directive, with Nielsen Holdings plc being the surviving company. The merger effectively changed the place of incorporation of Nielsen&#x27;s publicly traded parent holding company from the Netherlands to England and Wales, with no changes made to the business being conducted by Nielsen prior to the merger.

=== 2021 split and 2022 buyout ===
On March 5, 2021, Nielsen Holdings announced the completion of sale of Global Connect business (known as NielsenIQ, the former AC Nielsen) to private equity firm Advent International. This transaction effectively turned Nielsen into a pure-play media audience measurement and analytics firm.

In March 2022, Nielsen announced that it had accepted a $16 billion offer from a group of private equity investors led by Elliott Investment Management subsidiary Evergreen Coast Capital Corp., and Brookfield Business Partners. The Nielsen board of directors had turned down an initial $9 billion offer from the investment consortium. The transaction was completed in October 2022.

==Company information==

Nielsen is a global, independent measurement and data company for media business. With a presence in more than 100 countries and services covering more than 90% of the globe&#x27;s GDP and population, Nielsen provides clients with data about what consumers watch (programming, advertising) on a global and local basis and how those choices intersect.

The company&#x27;s operations span developing and emerging markets worldwide, in more than 100 countries. According to SEC records, on February 26, 2015, Nielsen N.V., announced that its board of directors unanimously approved a proposal that resulted in a change in the company&#x27;s legal domicile, from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom. Upon approval, the company became incorporated under English law and was registered as a public limited company to be named Nielsen Holdings PLC.

Up to 2022, James Attwood Jr. was Nielsen&#x27;s non-executive chairman, who succeeded Dave Calhoun as Executive Chairman in January 2016. Prior to joining Nielsen as CEO in 2006, Dave Calhoun served as Vice Chairman of the General Electric Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Infrastructure, the largest of six GE business units. He served as Nielsen CEO from 2006 to 2014, when he was succeeded by Mitch Barns. Barns joined Nielsen in 1997, and has held various roles in Europe, Asia, and North America leading major parts of the business.

On December 3, 2018, David Kenny was named CEO of Nielsen, succeeding Mitch Barns.

In September 2023, Karthik Rao was named CEO of Nielsen, succeeding David Kenny who became Executive Chairman. 

While the Nielsen brand is most often associated with television ratings, those TV rating services comprise approximately one-quarter of the company&#x27;s business and revenues. After substantial work to simplify the company over the last several years and divestment of NielsenIQ in 2021, Nielsen Holdings aligns its business into media audience measurement and analytics.

==Company history==
===Arthur C. Nielsen and the invention of &quot;Market Share&quot;===
Arthur C. Nielsen founded the AC Nielsen Company in August 1923 with the idea of selling engineering performance surveys. It was the first company to offer market research. The company expanded its business in 1932 by creating a retail index that tracked the flow of food and drug purchases. This was the first retail measurement of its kind and for the first time allowed a company to determine its &quot;share&quot; of the market—the origination of the concept of &quot;market share&quot; Arthur C. Nielsen is credited with coining this business term.

===Radio and television===
In 1936, Arthur C. Nielsen acquired the Audimeter, which measured which radio stations a radio had been tuned to during the day. After tinkering with the device for a few years, the company created a national radio rating service in 1942. The company collected information on which stations radios were tuned to in one thousand homes. Then, this survey data was sold to manufacturers who were interested in the popularity of programs and demographic information about listeners for advertising purposes. This was the birth of audience measurement that would become the most well-known part of Nielsen&#x27;s business when applied to television. Today, these are commonly referred to as &quot;Nielsen ratings&quot;.

The company began measuring television audiences in 1950, at a time when the medium was just getting off the ground. Just as with radio, a sampling of homes across the U.S. was used to develop ratings. This information was collected on a device that was attached to a television that recorded what was being watched. In 1953, the company began sending out diaries to a smaller sample of homes (&quot;Nielsen families&quot;) within the survey to have them record what they had watched. This data was put together with information from the devices. This combination of data allowed the company to statistically estimate the number of Americans watching TV and the demographic breakdown of viewers. This became an important tool for advertisers and networks.

In the 1980s, the company launched a new measurement device known as the &quot;people meter&quot;. The device resembles a remote control with buttons for each individual family member and extras for guests. Viewers push a button to signify when they are in the room and push it again when they leave, even if the TV is still on. This form of measurement was intended to provide a more accurate picture of who was watching and when.

In July 2008, Nielsen released the first in a series of quarterly reports, detailing video and TV usage across the &#x27;three screens&#x27; – Television, Internet and Mobile devices. The A2/M2 Three Screen Report also includes trends in timeshifted viewing behavior and its relationship to online video viewing, a demographic breakdown of mobile video viewers and DVR penetration.

On September 30, 2016, Nielsen made its Digital Content Ratings available in full syndication for clients.

On September 9, 2016, Nielsen announced that it would retire its paper TV diaries by mid-2017 and provide all electronic measurement in its local television ratings.

===Private equity===
Nielsen was acquired by the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Company in 1984. In 1996, D&amp;B divided the company into two separate companies: Nielsen Media Research, which was responsible for TV ratings, and AC Nielsen, which was responsible for consumer shopping trends and box-office data. In 1999, Nielsen Media Research was acquired by the Dutch publishing company VNU (Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen). VNU later acquired AC Nielsen and recombined the two businesses in 2001. In between, VNU sold off its newspaper properties to Wegener and its consumer magazines to Sanoma. The company&#x27;s publishing arm also owned several publications including &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

In 1997, VNU acquired the directory publishing business of ITT Sheraton (ITT World Directories) for $2.1 billion; the business was renamed VNU World Directories.

<doc id="1074436" wikidata="Q3489496" url="?curid=1074436" title="List of Cape Canaveral and Merritt Island launch sites">
<text>Cape Canaveral and adjacent Merritt Island on Florida&#x27;s Atlantic coast are home to the USA&#x27;s Eastern Range, the most active rocket range and spaceport in the country. The Eastern Range hosts two groundside operators: the military Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and the civilian Kennedy Space Center. Between them are dozens of launch pads, with several currently in active service and more in planning for activation.

==Kennedy Space Center==
Kennedy Space Center, operated by NASA, has two launch complexes on Merritt Island comprising four pads—two active, one under lease, and one inactive. From 1967 to 1975, it was the site of 13 Saturn V launches, three crewed Skylab flights and the Apollo–Soyuz; all Space Shuttle flights from 1981 to 2011, and one Ares 1-X flight in 2009. Since 2017, SpaceX uses Launch Complex 39A to launch their launch vehicles.

==Cape Canaveral Space Force Station==
Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS), operated by Space Launch Delta 45 of the U.S. Space Force, was the site of all U.S. crewed launches before Apollo 8, as well as many other early Department of Defense (DoD) and NASA launches. For the DoD, it plays a secondary role to Vandenberg SFB in California, but is the launch site for many NASA uncrewed space probes, as those spacecraft are typically launched on United States Space Force launchers. Much of the support activity for CCSFS occurs at Patrick Space Force Base to the south, its reporting base.

Active launch vehicles are in bold. Active non-rocket uses are in &quot;italics&quot;.

<text>Burberry Group plc is a British luxury fashion house established in 1856 by Thomas Burberry and headquartered in London, England. It designs and distributes ready to wear, including trench coats, leather accessories, and footwear. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
===Early years===

====19th century====
Burberry was founded in 1856 when 21-year-old Thomas Burberry, a former draper&#x27;s apprentice, opened his own store in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England. By 1870, the business had established itself by focusing on the development of outdoors attire. In 1879, Burberry introduced gabardine to his brand, a hardwearing, water-resistant yet breathable fabric, in which the yarn is waterproofed before weaving. In 1891, Burberry opened a shop in the Haymarket, London.

====20th century====

In 1901, the Burberry Equestrian Knight logo was developed containing the Latin word &quot;Prorsum&quot;, meaning &quot;forwards&quot;, and it was registered as a trademark in 1909. In 1911, the company became the outfitters for Roald Amundsen, the first man to reach the South Pole, and Ernest Shackleton, who led a 1914 expedition to cross Antarctica. A Burberry gabardine jacket was worn by George Mallory on his attempt on Mount Everest in 1924.

Adapted to meet the needs of military personnel, the &quot;trench coat&quot; was born during the First World War; it was worn by British officers in the trenches. After the war, it became popular with civilians.
The Burberry check has been in use since at least the 1920s, primarily as a lining in its trench coats. The celebrity motorcycling sisters Betty and Nancy Debenham wore their trench coats for travelling and racing in the 1920s and recommended the garment in their 1928 book &quot;Motor-Cycling for Women&quot;. Burberry also specially designed aviation garments. They outfitted Mrs Victor Bruce for her 1930 round the world flight and her one woman flight to Japan. She wore a reversible coat with waterproof gabardine outside for flying and with a tweed inner side which could be turned outside to create a smart look for disembarking under the glare of the publicity her exploits attracted. In 1937, A. E. Clouston and Betty Kirby-Green broke the world record for the fastest return flight from London to Cape Town in &quot;The Burberry&quot; airplane that was sponsored by the brand. Burberry was an independent family-controlled company until 1955, when Great Universal Stores (GUS) assumed ownership.

==== Influences and rise to prominence ====
During the 1970s and 1980s, Burberry signed agreements with worldwide manufacturers to produce goods complementary to the existing British collection, such as suits, trousers, shirts, sportswear and accessories, for men, women, and children. These products, designed under the strict control of headquarters in London, were produced and distributed through independent retail stores worldwide as well as through the Burberry stores, and contributed to the growth of the brand in sales and profits through to the late 90s, although the full extent of sales was not apparent in the parent company accounts since much was done through licensed agreements. The company had signed Lord Lichfield as photographer, Lord (Leonard) Wolfson was Chairman and Stanley Peacock OBE Managing Director. In 1997, GUS director Victor Barnett became chairman of Burberry, hiring Rose Marie Bravo to execute a corporate reorganization and restoration of the brand as a luxury fashion house. Barnett led the company up to its successful IPO in 2001.

===21st century===
In May 2001, Christopher Bailey joined Burberry as creative director. Bailey was the chief creative officer from 2014, as well as chief executive (CEO) from 2014 until November 2017. Bailey stepped down as chief creative officer in March 2018 and had departed the brand completely by the end of 2018.

Between 2001 and 2005, Burberry became associated with &quot;chav&quot; and football hooligan culture. This change in the brand reputation was attributed to lower priced products, the proliferation of counterfeit goods adopting Burberry&#x27;s trademark check pattern, and adoption by celebrities prominently identified with &quot;chav&quot; culture. The association with football hooliganism led to the wearing of Burberry check garments being banned at some venues.

Burberry Group plc was initially floated on the London Stock Exchange in July 2002. GUS divested its remaining interest in Burberry in December 2005. In 2005, Sanyo-shokai was the Burberry ready-to-wear licence holder in Japan, with retail value of €435 million.

In 2006, Rose Marie Bravo, who as chief executive had led Burberry to mass market success through licensing, retired. She was replaced by another American, Angela Ahrendts, who joined from Liz Claiborne in January 2006, and took up the position of CEO on 1 July 2006. Ahrendts and Bailey successfully turned around the then chav-like reputation that the brand had acquired at the end of Bravo&#x27;s tenure and the cheapening effect of the brand&#x27;s omnipresence, by removing the brand&#x27;s check-pattern from all but 10% of the company&#x27;s products, taking the fragrance and beauty product licenses back in-house and buying out the Spanish franchise that was worth 20% of group revenues.
Burberry first sold online in the US, then in the UK in October 2006, and in the rest of the EU in 2007.

====2010s====
It was reported in 2012 that Ahrendts was the highest paid CEO in the UK, making £16.9m.

In October 2013, it was announced that Ahrendts would take up the position of Senior Vice President of retail and online at Apple, Inc. from April 2014, and would be replaced as CEO by Bailey. During her tenure, sales increased to over £2 billion, and the market capitalization more than tripled to £7 billion. Burberry promotes its British origins; as of July 2012, Burberry maintained two production facilities in Great Britain, one in Castleford producing raincoats, and one in Keighley. In spring 2014, Bailey became CEO of Burberry and retained the role of chief creative officer. His basic salary was £1.1m, with total compensation of up to £10m a year depending on sales targets being met.

In July 2016, it was announced that Celine boss Marco Gobbetti would become CEO of Burberry plc, while Bailey became the Creative Director with the title of President. In 2016, the label launched its &quot;Mr Burberry&quot; fragrance.
In early May 2017, the store announced it was moving 300 employees from London to Leeds. In July 2017, Gobbetti replaced Bailey as CEO. In March 2018, Burberry named Riccardo Tisci, creative director at Givenchy from 2005 to 2017, as the brand&#x27;s chief creative officer. He said: &quot;I am honoured and delighted to be joining Burberry as its new chief creative officer and reuniting with Marco Gobbetti. I have an enormous respect for Burberry&#x27;s British heritage and global appeal and I am excited about the potential of this exceptional brand.&quot;

A few months later, Tisci presented a new logo and monogram for the brand, designed by the English graphic designer Peter Saville.
In April 2018, it was announced that Sir John Peace would be stepping down as chairman of the board and would be replaced by as chairman by Gerry Murphy. Murphy said: &quot;Burberry is a unique British brand that I have admired for a long time and I am looking forward to working with Marco Gobbetti and the Board to guide the company through its next phase of growth.&quot;

Murphy had been CEO of Kingfisher plc, as well as being current chairman of Tate and Lyle and Blackstone Group International Partners LLP. Peace&#x27;s departure marked a change in leadership for the group, with Gobetti and Ahrends having left in the previous years.

In May 2018, it was reported that Burberry had filed a lawsuit against Target Corporation, claiming that Target had copied its check print designs and was seeking an amount of $2 million, in addition to its legal costs.

In July 2018, it was reported that in the previous five years Burberry had destroyed unsold clothes, accessories, and perfume worth over £90m in order to protect its brand and prevent the items being stolen or sold cheaply. While a representative of Greenpeace criticised the decision, Burberry claimed that the energy generated from burning its products was captured, making it environmentally friendly. According to Burberry&#x27;s annual report, by the end of the financial year 2018, the company had destroyed goods worth £28.6m, an increase on the £26.9m from its financial year 2017. In September 2018, Burberry reported that it would stop the practice of burning unsold goods, with immediate effect. Burberry also announced it would stop using real fur in its products, and would phase out existing fur items.

In February 2019, Burberry apologized for showcasing a hoodie with a noose around the neck in its show at the London Fashion Week. Burberry said it had removed the item from its collection, after criticism from one of its own models led to an online backlash.

====2020s====

In February 2020 Burberry was forced to close 24 of its 64 Chinese mainland stores because of the COVID-19 pandemic. By July 2020, the company announced it would cut 500 jobs worldwide, including 150 in its UK head offices, in an effort to save £55 million following a reduction in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, Burberry announced that it would become a &quot;climate positive&quot; company by 2040. The fashion brand also announced that it would commit to a new target to reduce supply chain emissions (i.e. assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organisation) by 46% by 2030, an increase from an earlier pledge of a 30% reduction. In March 2021, Burberry was the first luxury brand to be targeted in China as part of the backlash regarding sanctions against the alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Brand ambassador and Actress Zhou Dongyu terminated her contract with Burberry.

In April 2022, after the departure of Marco Gobbetti, the Versace boss Jonathan Akeroyd took over Burberry as the next chief executive in a deal including a £6m golden hello to cover the loss of bonus and share awards for leaving his previous position.

In July, 2022, Burberry announced Thai artist Vachirawit Chivaaree as their first Global Brand Ambassador from the South Asia-Pacific Region.

Later in 2022, the company&#x27;s chief operating and financial officer announced a ban on the use of exotic skins—such as alligator and snake—in its collections. In September 2022, Burberry announced designer Daniel Lee, former creative director of Bottega Veneta, as Riccardo Tisci&#x27;s replacement as the company&#x27;s chief creative officer.

In February 2023 a new logo and branding was introduced: this brought back the Equestrian Knight logo. The advertising campaign features British models and musicians Shygirl, Liberty Ross and Skepta.

In April 2023, rapper Kano fronted a Burberry marketing campaign introduced by Lee in February 2023. The &quot;new direction&quot; was phrased as &quot;&quot;a modern take on British luxury&quot;.&quot; 

In October 2023, Burberry collaborated with Vestiaire Collective on a new circular style project. This partnership would allow customers to exchange their second-hand Burberry clothing and handbags for a Burberry gift card, which they could reinvest in the brand, with the aim of promoting resale and reducing clothing waste.

Research by the social democratic party in the European Parliament, the Sheffield Hallam University and other groups accused Burberry in 2023 of using Uyghur forced labour camps provided by the Sunrise Manufacture Group Co. for production of clothing.

In July 2024, the company announced a profit warning and the departure of its chief executive Jonathan Akeroyd, to be replaced by Joshua Schulman. The company also reported significant sales declines across its markets in the first quarter, with store sales dropping 23% in the Americas and Asia Pacific, and 16% in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa. The company&#x27;s shares fell 15% following the announcement, and it suspended dividend payments. Burberry also revealed plans for job cuts, primarily in its UK corporate office.
In November 2024, Burberry launched a £40 million cost-cutting program, aiming to stabilize the brand and refocus on its core outerwear and iconic trench coats. As part of the turnaround, Burberry planned to cut £40 million annually, with £25 million expected in the 2025 financial year. Though the company refrained from specifying job cuts, it confirmed it was streamlining office teams. Schulman also introduced a new outerwear campaign and appointed new managers in key divisions. Burberry&#x27;s shares rose 16% following the announcement, as investors responded positively to the plan.

== In popular culture ==

On 30 November 2022, in an episode of All Elite Wrestling&#x27;s (AEW) &quot;Dynamite&quot;, the reigning champion Maxwell Jacob Friedman (&#x27;MJF&#x27;), who had won the title at Full Gear on 19 November, discarded the standard AEW World Championship belt, calling it trash, and unveiled his own custom version, which he dubbed the &quot;Big Burberry Belt&quot;, or Triple-B for short. It featured the exact same design as the standard belt; however, the leather strap was brown and fashioned in Burberry&#x27;s trademark check pattern to match MJF&#x27;s signature Burberry scarf.

On 29 March 2023, a Burberry tote was used in an episode from &quot;Succession&quot;. Google searches for Burberry and the &quot;Burberry tote bag&quot; rose by more than 310% after the episode aired.

<doc id="1074448" wikidata="Q1147606" url="?curid=1074448" title="Beijing dialect">
<text>The Beijing dialect (), also known as Pekingese and Beijingese, is the prestige dialect of Mandarin spoken in the urban area of Beijing, China. It is the phonological basis of Standard Chinese, the official language in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and one of the official languages of Singapore and the Republic of China. Despite the similarity to Standard Chinese, it is characterized by some &quot;iconic&quot; differences, including the addition of a final rhotic to some words (e.g. ). During the Ming, southern dialectal influences were also introduced into the dialect.

== History ==

===Status as prestige dialect===
As the political and cultural capital of China, Beijing has held much historical significance as a city, and its speech has held sway as a lingua franca. Being officially selected to form the basis of the phonology of Standard Mandarin has further contributed to its status as a prestige dialect, or sometimes &quot;the&quot; prestige dialect of Chinese.

Other scholars have referred to it as the &quot;elite Beijing accent.&quot;

Until at least the late 18th century, the standard language of the Chinese elite had been the Nanjing dialect, despite political power having already been located in Beijing. Through the nineteenth century, evidence from Western dictionaries suggests that a shift occurred in the court from a Nanjing-based standard to a more local Beijing-based one.

During the Qing dynasty it was used alongside the Manchu language as the official court language.

The establishment of phonology of Standard Chinese dates from a 1913 decision by the Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation, which took the Beijing dialect as its base but retained a lot of phonology from other varieties of Mandarin, resulting in the Old National Pronunciation. This was overturned in 1926, resulting in the &quot;pronunciation of the educated natives of Beijing&quot; officially adopted as the basis for the phonology of Standard Chinese (Guoyu) in 1926.

In 1955, the People&#x27;s Republic of China declared that Standard Chinese was to be &quot;modeled on the pronunciation of Beijing, draws on Northern Chinese as its base dialect, and receives its syntactic norms from exemplary works of vernacular literature&quot;.

The Beijing dialect has been described as carrying a lot of &quot;cultural heft.&quot; According to Zhang Shifang, professor at Beijing Language and Culture University,&quot;As China&#x27;s ancient and modern capital, Beijing and thus its linguistic culture as well are representative of our entire nation&#x27;s civilization... For Beijing people themselves, the Beijing dialect is an important symbol of identity.&quot;

Some argue that Cantonese is the &quot;only dialect which has attained a level of prestige that rivals that of the standard national language.&quot;

The dialect has been described as &quot;the official language of the entertainment industry&quot;, making it also the &quot;showbiz accent.&quot;

Even within Beijing the dialect varies. Those north of the Forbidden City spoke with a more &quot;refined&quot; accent than the poorer people, craftsmen, and performers of the south.

=== Younger generation ===
Some fear that the vernacular Beijing dialect will disappear. According to a 2010 study by Beijing Union University, 49% of young Beijingers born after 1980 prefer to speak standard Mandarin rather than the Beijing dialect. According to a UN report, nearly 100 Chinese dialects, especially those spoken by the 55 ethnic minorities in China, are endangered.

==Mutual intelligibility==
The Beijing dialect is generally mutually intelligible with other Mandarin dialects, including Standard Chinese. However it is not intelligible with other Sino-Tibetan languages or even other Chinese languages including Cantonese, Hokkien, and Wu Chinese.

The Dungan language is a Sinitic language derived from Mandarin spoken throughout Central Asia, particularly in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Speakers like Dungan poet and scholar Iasyr Shivaza and others have reported that Chinese who speak the Beijing dialect could understand Dungan, but Dungans could not understand Beijing Mandarin.

==Phonology==
In fundamental structure, the phonology of the Beijing dialect and Standard Chinese are almost identical. In part, this is because the pronunciation of Standard Chinese was based on Beijing pronunciation. However, the Beijing dialect also has vernacular readings of characters which are not only different, but have initial and final combinations that are not present in Standard Chinese, such as , , , , and .

Other differences exist, including the proliferation of rhotic vowels. All rhotic vowels are the result of the use of the , a noun suffix, except for a few words pronounced that do not have this suffix. In Standard Chinese, these also occur but much less often than they appear in the Beijing dialect. This phenomenon is known as , or rhotacization, as is considered one of the iconic characteristics of Beijing Mandarin.

When /w/ occurs in syllable-initial position, many speakers use [ʋ] before vowels other than [o] as in , and [u] as in , e.g. .

When occurs before a glide or vowel it is often eliminated along with any following glides so is pronounced and as .

Sibilant initials differ significantly between Standard Chinese and the Beijing dialect. The initials are pronounced as in Beijing. are pronounced as by some female speakers, a feature known as .

Moreover, the Beijing dialect has a few phonetic reductions that are usually considered too &quot;colloquial&quot; for use in Standard Chinese. These are often dependent on which syllables are stressed and unstressed. For example, in fast speech, initial consonants go through lenition if they are in an unstressed syllable: pinyin] before become , so can sound like ; can sound like , resulting in a &quot;swallowing of consonants&quot;, or .

 become , so can sound like ; pinyin go through voicing to become ; intervocalic also lose aspiration and can be voiced, sounding identical to ; similar changes also occur on other consonants.

 is voiced and relaxed in intervocalic positions, resulting in [ʋ].

Affricates are elided into fricatives when not word initial, such as becoming 

Some of these changes yield syllables that violate the syllable structure of Standard Chinese, such as Street, which locals pronounce as .

The literary tones of the Beijing dialect tend to be more exaggerated than Standard Chinese. In Standard Chinese, the four tones are high flat, high rising, low dipping, and falling; in the Beijing dialect, the first two tones are higher, the third one dips more prominently, and the fourth one falls more. However, toneless syllables are incredibly common in the vernacular Beijing dialect and the third tone is realized as a low tone instead of a dipping tone, known as a &quot;half third tone&quot;.

===Influence on Manchu===

The Chinese Northern Mandarin dialect spoken in Beijing had a major impact on the phonology of the dialect of Manchu spoken in Beijing, and since Manchu phonology was transcribed into Chinese and European sources based on the sinified pronunciation of Manchus from Beijing, the original authentic Manchu pronunciation is unknown to scholars.

The Manchus that lived in Beijing were influenced by the Beijing dialect insofar as pronouncing Manchu sounds was hard for them, and they pronounced Manchu according to Chinese phonetics. In contrast, the Manchus of Aigun, Heilongjiang could both pronounce Manchu sounds properly and mimic the sinified pronunciation of Manchus in Beijing. This was because they learned the Beijing pronunciation from either studying in Beijing or from officials sent to Aigun from Beijing. They could also tell them apart, using the Chinese influenced pronunciation of Beijing to demonstrate that they were better educated and had &quot;superior stature&quot; in society.

=== Influence on Mongolian ===

A substantial proportion of the loanwords in Mongolian are derived from Chinese, with the oldest layer of loanwords in Written Mongolian being Chinese in origin. Much of Mongolian spoken in Inner Mongolia has been affected by Mandarin; lexical influence is claimed to be strong in Khorchin Mongolian, whilst there have been claims of phonetic influence from Mandarin Chinese in the Kharchin variety of Mongolian. The aspirated bilabial stop /pʰ/ and the labial approximant /w/ are phonemes only found in loanwords from Chinese and Tibetan, evident in their limited distribution in Mongolian. Substantial diglossia can also be observed in Inner Mongolia.

==Vocabulary==
The Beijing dialect typically uses many words that are considered slang, and therefore occur much less or not at all in Standard Chinese. Speakers not native to Beijing may have trouble understanding many or most of these. Many of such slang words employ the rhotic suffix &quot;-r&quot;, which is known as erhua. Examples include:

* (referring to manner or attribute)
* , usually followed by if used as an imperative, usually used when rejecting a favor or politeness from close friends
* 
* 
* 
* , equivalent to Standard Chinese 
* , especially things to do
* , often used in place of .
* , often used in place of .

Some Beijing phrases may be somewhat disseminated outside Beijing:
* , now used outside Beijing
* , heard often on public transportation, from Classical Chinese
* , equivalent to Standard Chinese or 
* , a stronger version of Standard Chinese and believed to derive from 

Note that some of the slang are considered to be , that are carry-overs from an older generation and are no longer used amongst more educated speakers, for example:
* , similar to , which is more often used by the younger generation

Others may be viewed as neologisms used among younger speakers and in &quot;trendier&quot; circles:
* ) when describing a person
* , used in basketball
* , with a negative connotation

=== Manchu and Mongol loanwords ===
The dialect also contains both Manchu and Mongol loanwords:
* , from Middle Mongolian &#x27;water well&#x27; (cf. modern Mongolian ) or &#x27;passage&#x27; (modern Mongolian ), possibly with influence from Chinese and .
* , from Middle Mongolian &#x27;post station&#x27; (cf. modern Mongolian &#x27;guide&#x27;).
* , from Manchu 

==Grammar==
There are syntactic differences between Standard Mandarin and the Beijing dialect. Both southern Chinese and southern Mandarin syntactic features were incorporated into Standard Mandarin, while the Beijing dialect retains features of northern Mandarin. The Beijing dialect also uses colloquial expressions differently.

There is a conditional loss of the classifier under certain circumstances after the numeral , usually pronounced as with the second tone, as if undergoing tone sandhi with the classifier after it.

In general, Standard Chinese is influenced by Classical Chinese, which makes it more condense and concise. The Beijing dialect can therefore seem more longwinded; but this is sometime balanced by the generally faster speaking rate and phonetic reductions of colloquial Beijing speech.

<text>The Bayamón Central University—or Universidad Central de Bayamón (UCB) in Spanish—is a private, Catholic university in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. Its predecessor began in 1961 by the Dominican Order as a community college of the Catholic University of Puerto Rico (today known as the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico). Universidad Católica de Bayamón was incorporated in 1964.

The university became autonomous on September 1, 1970, and is currently accredited by the Council of Higher Education of Puerto Rico, the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, and by the Congregation for Catholic Education.

In October 1982 a multi-use sports complex inaugurated and was dedicated in honor of Rafael Pont Flores and it bears his name.

In October 2019, US federal funds were earmarked for the university.

<doc id="1074464" wikidata="Q7981136" url="?curid=1074464" title="Well test">
<text>In hydrology, a well test is conducted to evaluate the amount of water that can be pumped from a particular water well. More specifically, a well test will allow prediction of the maximum rate at which water can be pumped from a well, and the distance that the water level in the well will fall for a given pumping rate and duration of pumping. 

Well testing differs from aquifer testing in that the behaviour of the well is primarily of concern in the former, while the characteristics of the aquifer (the geological formation or unit that supplies water to the well) are quantified in the latter.

When water is pumped from a well the water level in the well falls. This fall is called drawdown. The amount of water that can be pumped is limited by the drawdown produced. Typically, drawdown also increases with the length of time that the pumping continues.

== Well losses vs. aquifer losses ==
The components of observed drawdown in a pumping well were first described by Jacob (1947), and the test was refined independently by Hantush (1964) and Bierschenk (1963) as consisting of two related components,
:formula_1,

where s is drawdown (units of length e.g., m), formula_2 is the pumping rate (units of volume flowrate e.g., m³/day), formula_3 is the aquifer loss coefficient (which increases with time — as predicted by the Theis solution) and formula_4 is the well loss coefficient (which is constant for a given flow rate).

The first term of the equation (formula_5) describes the linear component of the drawdown; i.e., the part in which doubling the pumping rate doubles the drawdown.

The second term (formula_6) describes what is often called the &#x27;well losses&#x27;; the non-linear component of the drawdown. To quantify this it is necessary to pump the well at several different flow rates (commonly called &quot;steps&quot;). Rorabaugh (1953) added to this analysis by making the exponent an arbitrary power (usually between 1.5 and 3.5). 

To analyze this equation, both sides are divided by the discharge rate (formula_2), leaving formula_8 on the left side, which is commonly referred to as &quot;specific drawdown&quot;. The right hand side of the equation becomes that of a straight line. Plotting the specific drawdown after a set amount of time (formula_9) since the beginning of each step of the test (since drawdown will continue to increase with time) versus pumping rate should produce a straight line.
:formula_10

Fitting a straight line through the observed data, the slope of the best fit line will be formula_4 (well losses) and the intercept of this line with formula_12 will be formula_3 (aquifer losses). This process is fitting an idealized model to real world data, and seeing what parameters in the model make it fit reality best. The assumption is then made that these fitted parameters best represent reality (given the assumptions that went into the model are true).

The relationship above is for fully penetrating wells in confined aquifers (the same assumptions used in the Theis solution for determining aquifer characteristics in an aquifer test).

== Well efficiency ==
Often the &quot;well efficiency&quot; is determined from this sort of test, this is a percentage indicating the fraction of total observed drawdown in a pumping well which is due to aquifer losses (as opposed to being due to flow through the well screen and inside the borehole). A perfectly efficient well, with perfect well screen and where the water flows inside the well in a frictionless manner would have 100% efficiency. Unfortunately well efficiency is hard to compare between wells because it depends on the characteristics of the aquifer too (the same amount of well losses compared to a more transmissive aquifer would give a lower efficiency).

==Specific capacity==
Specific capacity is a quantity that which a water well can produce per unit of drawdown. It is normally obtained from a step drawdown test. Specific capacity is expressed as:
:formula_14
where
:formula_15 is the specific capacity ([L2T−1]; m²/day or USgal/day/ft)
:formula_2 is the pumping rate ([L3T−1]; m³/day or USgal/day), and
:formula_17 is the drawdown ([L]; m or ft)
The specific capacity of a well is also a function of the pumping rate it is determined at. Due to non-linear well losses the specific capacity will decrease with higher pumping rates. This complication makes the absolute value of specific capacity of little use; though it is useful for comparing the efficiency of the same well through time (e.g., to see if the well requires rehabilitation).

<text>Chantilly ( , ; Picard: &quot;Cantily&quot;) is a commune in the Oise department in the Valley of the Nonette in the Hauts-de-France region of Northern France. Surrounded by Chantilly Forest, the town of 10,863 inhabitants (2017) falls within the metropolitan area of Paris. It lies 38.4 km (23.9 miles) north-northeast of the centre of Paris and together with six neighbouring communes forms an urban area of 37,254 inhabitants (2018).

Intimately tied to the House of Montmorency in the 15th to 17th centuries, the Château de Chantilly was home to the Princes of Condé, cousins of the Kings of France, from the 17th to the 19th centuries. It now houses the Musée Condé. Chantilly is also known for its horse racing track, Chantilly Racecourse, where prestigious races are held for the Prix du Jockey Club and Prix de Diane. Chantilly and the surrounding communities are home to the largest racehorse-training community in France.

Chantilly is also home to the Living Museum of the Horse, with stables built by the Princes of Condé. It is considered one of the more important tourist destinations in the Paris area. Chantilly gave its name to Chantilly cream and to Chantilly lace. The city was the base for the England national football team during the Euro 2016 Championship.

==Geography==
Chantilly lies in the Parisian basin, at the south end of the region of Hauts-de-France and the north end of the Paris metropolitan area. It belongs to the historic region of Valois. Chantilly lies 39 km (25 miles) southwest of Beauvais, 79 km (50 miles) south of Amiens and 38 km (24 miles) north of Paris.

Saint-Maximin lies to the north, Vineuil-Saint-Firmin to the northeast, Avilly-Saint-Léonard to the east, Pontarmé and Orry-la-Ville to the south-east, Coye-la-Forêt to the south, Lamorlaye to the southwest and Gouvieux to the west.

Chantilly is the centre of an urban area that includes the communes of Avilly-Saint-Léonard, Boran-sur-Oise, Coye-la-Forêt, Gouvieux, Lamorlaye and Vineuil-Saint-Firmin. It is the third-largest urban area in the Oise and the seventh-largest in Hauts-de-France. It has no large businesses or heavy industry and 40% of the population works in Île-de-France.

=== Topography ===

Chantilly straddles the junction of the Paris Basin and the western County of Valois, of which the Nonette River is a boundary. The site of the town was originally a clearing or meadowland, sometimes called a lawn or &quot;pelouse&quot;, which is mostly occupied today by the racecourse. The remaining open space between the town and the racecourse is always referred to as the &quot;little lawn&quot;. The highest point in the area, 112 meters (378&#x27;), is at Bois Lorris, in Lamorlaye. The lowest elevation is 35 metres (115&#x27;), at the Canardière on the banks of the Nonette in Gouvieux.

The commune sits on a Lutetian sedimentary limestone plateau covered by Chantilly Forest. Sand created by wind and erosion covers this chalky plateau.

This stone has also been used for building in parts of the region, and still is today in the adjoining commune of Saint-Maximin. It was also used for building in Chantilly itself during the 18th century, when a quarry on the current site of the racecourse produced stone for the court officials&#x27; housing and the stables. In the following century the quarry was used to grow mushrooms, then as an air raid shelter during World War II. It now belongs to the Chantilly Estate and is periodically open to the public.

Another geological feature is alluvial accumulations in the river valleys, which have allowed, in the case of the Nonette, the development of community gardens in the locality known as the Canardière.

=== Hydrology and water supply ===

The town is bounded at its southern edge by the Thève, a 33 km (20 mile) long tributary of the Oise River. At this point that valley contains the Commelles ponds, created in the 13th century by the monks of Chaalis Abbey to stock fish.

The river Nonette runs through the town itself. This 44 km (27 mile) long river is also part of the watershed of the Oise and is channeled into canals throughout the municipality. In fact, the creation of the château gardens by André Le Nôtre required the complete transformation of the waterway starting in 1663. The riverbed was moved a hundred meters (yards) north to create the 2.5 km (1½ mile) long Grand Canal that runs in front of the château. The old riverbed became the 800 metre (½ mile) long Canal Saint-Jean, named after a 16th-century chapel demolished when the gardens were created. The Canardière, beneath the actual viaduct, was channeled and cleaned up at this time also.

The Canal de la Machine, perpendicular to the other two and nearly 300 meters (yards) long, brought water to the Pavilon du Manse, which fed it to the garden ponds and waterfalls in the western gardens, since disappeared, sending it to a reservoir once located on the lawn. Part of this reservoir still exists near the racecourse, but it no longer contains water. Some of this hydrologic work was used to feed factories in the valley. The gardens that remain were watered by a completely different system based on an aqueduct coming from the area around Senlis.

In the 18th century a mineral water source was discovered in the valley and a garden pavilion was built between 1725 and 1728 to allow the public to come drink from it. This was a separate source from the source of ferruginous water, called Chantilly water, discovered at La Chausée in Gouvieux, and bottled and carbonated there from 1882 into the 20th century.

Also in the 18th century, a supply of drinking water was created by diverting water from the reservoir. In 1823, the last prince of Condé had eighteen fountains installed for the use of residents. In 1895 these were replaced with a supply from a water treatment plant in the neighboring village of Lamorlaye. This brought in water from Chantilly, Lamorlaye and Boran-sur-Oise then distributed the treated water through two water towers on the Mont de Pô in Gouvieux. This water supply has been managed by the private company Lyonnaise des eaux since 1928.

The sewer system was installed in 1878, but initially limited to the area around rue d&#x27;Aumale, the Condé Hospice and the rue de Paris, now known as the avenue du Maréchal Joffre. It was extended to the entire town in 1910 through a state subsidy financed by a tax on racetrack bets. A sewage treatment plant was built in 1969 at La Canardière, then moved to Gouvieux in 2006. This 22 km (14 mile) network is administered by a regional agency, the syndicat intercommunal pour le traitement des eaux de la vallée de la Nonette (SICTEUV), which covers Apremont, Avilly-Saint-Léonard, Chantilly, Gouvieux et Vineuil-Saint-Firmin.

==History==
===Before the city===

No traces of habitation from the prehistoric or Iron Age eras have ever been found in Chantilly. A Roman-era grave site was however found on the banks of the Nonette, and Gallo-Roman roads have been discovered in Chantilly Forest. Merovingian tombs from the seventh century were found in the 17th and 19th centuries not far from the Faisanderie.

Around 1223 Guy IV of Senlis agreed with the prior of Saint-Leu-d&#x27;Esserent that first referred to &quot;Terra cantiliaci&quot;. He was the royal grand bouteiller, a hereditary position in charge of the king&#x27;s vineyards, and became the first lord of Chantilly, which at the time was little more than a rock in the middle of a swampy area. A strong house was mentioned in the area in a 1227 document. In 1282 an act of the Parliament of Paris mentions Chantilly Forest. A 1358 document mentions the destruction of the château in the Grande Jacquerie. It was rebuilt by Pierre d&#x27;Orgemont and completed in 1394. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War Anglo-Burgundian forces laid siege to the château and Jacqueline de Paynel, widow of Pierre II d&#x27;Orgemont, who died at the battle of Agincourt, as well as of Jean de Fayel, was forced to surrender it. In return, the lives of those in the château were spared, but the surrounding villages were laid to waste.

The city began as just a few hamlets scattered outside the château. At the beginning of the 16th century, there were four:
* Les Grandes Fontaines, near the foot of the current rue des Fontaines,
* Les Petites Fontaines, also called Normandie, the foot of the current quai de la Canardière and rue de la Machine,
* Les Aigles, near today&#x27;s racetrack, which owes its name to the labourers who lived there in the late Middle Ages. It disappeared completely during the French Wars of Religion. 
* Quinquempoix, the largest and closest to the château.
In this period, Quinquempoix began to see an extension of the château&#x27;s functions. It was home to a chapel devoted to Saint Germain mentioned as early as 1219, which disappeared in the 17th century with the extension of the château&#x27;s gardens. Several houses were built in Quinquempoix to accommodate the prince&#x27;s court officials. Also, the hôtel de Beauvais, built in 1539, lodged the master of the hunt of constable (connétable) Anne de Montmorency. The hôtel de Quinquempoix, built around 1553, housed the constable&#x27;s equerry.

In 1515, Anne&#x27;s father, Guillaume de Montmorency, had obtained a papal bull that gave him the right to have mass said and all the sacraments performed in the chapel of the château, which was one of the first steps toward autonomy from the surrounding parishes.

===New parish to modern times===
In 1673, Louis II de Bourbon, the Prince of Condé known as the &quot;Grand Condé&quot;, built a new road called rue Gouvieux, which is now the rue du Connétable. The land ceded by the château on both sides of this road formed the nucleus of the new town, as guesthouses, workshops for the artisans of the château, and lodgings for servants sprang up. This embryonic town was divided between the parish of Gouvieux in the diocese of Beauvais and the parish of Saint-Léonard in the diocese of Senlis.
Louis expressed a wish in his will for a parish church near the château. Henri Jules de Bourbon-Condé fulfilled his father&#x27;s wish in 1692 by building the church of Notre-Dame and creating a new parish under the Bishop of Senlis, superseding all existing parishes. Chantilly was thus established as autonomous.
His grandson, Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, can be called the founder of the city, since he drew up the first city plans. He brought planning to the town design and renamed the rue Gouvieux the Grande Rue. After he built the Great Stables in 1721, he created a development in 1727 and sold lots for housing to court officials, holders of hereditary positions at the court of the Condés. The architectural standards for this housing were drawn by Jean Aubert, architect of the Great Stables. This housing was built between 1730 and 1733. In 1723, the Hospice de la Charité was built at the end of the Grande Rue.

In the second half of the 18th century the princes furthered economic activity. Lace had been produced in the town since the 17th century but now reached its apogee. Porcelain manufacture began in 1726 and was established in the rue de la Machine in 1730. Industrial buildings were built in 1780 at the end of the Grand Canal, to take advantage of the power provided by the waterfall.

===The beginnings of the commune===

During the French Revolution, Chantilly became a commune whose which boundaries matched those of the parish. The first mayor was the administrator of the estate, André-Joseph Antheaume de Surval. The other city council members were recruited from among the château officials. The Condés were among the first to flee abroad, just days after the fall of the Bastille, on 17 July 1789. The estate was sequestered on 13 June 1792 following the law on émigrés and subsequently subdivided and sold.
The first section was sold between 1793 and 1795 – the old kitchen garden, the water garden and the last land available along today&#x27;s rue du Connétable and around the petite pelouse, as well as the town houses that belonged to the Prince. Much of the land in this first section never came back to the estate. The rest of the land was divided into lots in 1798 and sold over time.

When the Reign of Terror began, the mayor was run out, on 15 August 1793; he was replaced by a Jacobin. The château was transformed into a prison from 1793 to 1794, designated for suspects from the Department of Oise. Sold as a national asset in 1799, the chateau was transformed into a stone quarry by a pair of entrepreneurs. Only the &quot;little château&quot; was preserved. The Great Stables were requisitioned by the army and used in turn by the , the 1er dragons or 1st Dragoons from 1803 to 1806 then the 1er régiment de chevau-légers lanciers polonais, or 1st Light Artillery Polish Lancers, from 1808 to 1814.
A number of industrialists took advantage of the sale of Condé assets to further develop their business activities. In 1792, the porcelain manufacturing enterprise turned its hand to ceramics under the hand of its new English owner, Christophe Potter. A copper laminating factory was established in the industrial buildings on the canal in 1801, and opened a mill in 1807. It employed as many as 600 people and brought prosperity back to the commune. Using the new English techniques, it diversified in cloth, particularly in calico manufacture and laundering. It began to decline in 1814 then lost its monopoly and failed in 1822.

In 1815, prince Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé came back to the area for good. He retrieved part of his family&#x27;s former estate and bought back the rest. His son, , had fountains installed in 1823 as well as many of the street lamps in 1827.

===Thomas Muir connection===

The Scottish political reformer Thomas Muir had been banished to Botany Bay for 14 years for the crime of sedition in 1793. He managed to escape having only spent 13 months there. An adventurous journey followed that eventually brought Muir as a citizen of France to Paris.

Muir became in time the principal intermediary between the French Directory and the various republican refugees in Paris. He was aware that his movements were under scrutiny by British Prime Minister William Pitt&#x27;s agents. In his last known communication with the Directory, in October 1798, he requested permission to leave Paris for somewhere less conspicuous, where his crucial negotiations with the Scottish emissaries could be conducted in safety.

Sometime in the middle of November 1798, Muir moved incognito to Chantilly. On 26 January 1799, he died there, suddenly and alone, with only a small child for company. So tight had his security been that not even local officials knew of his presence or identity. No identifying documents or papers were found on his person and his name was discovered only when the postman remembered delivering newspapers to him addressed to &#x27;Citoyen Thomas Muir&#x27;. Several days later, when the news of Muir&#x27;s death reached Paris, a brief obituary notice was inserted in Le Moniteur Universel saying that he had died from a recurrence of his old wounds.

===A 19th-century vacation and leisure destination===
Chantilly was also in the 19th century a playground for aristocrats and artists, as well as home to an English community with ties to horse racing. The first horse races were run in 1834 on the lawn area known as the pelouse, and the 1840s saw an influx of bettors of all social classes, especially from Paris. The success of the horse races was primarily due to the opening of the train station in 1859. Later, a public station allowed the arrival of up to 20,000 bettors and visitors on race days. A track and permanent seating were gradually added to form the racecourse in use today. Attendance records began to be kept just before World War I; 40,000 people attended the prix du Jockey Club in 1912.

During the Franco-Prussian War, Chantilly was occupied by the Prussian army for almost a year. The Grand Duke of Mecklenburg, head of the 18th Army Corps, occupied the chateau along with his general staff. His troops requisitioned the Great Stables, the racecourse stables, which had been evacuated, and some privately owned residences as well.

A racing economy grew up around the racecourse, with many stables devoted to training thoroughbred horses. Urban development grew up around these racing activities with new neighbourhoods such as the Bois Saint-Denis exclusively devoted to the activity. There were two trainers and seventeen hands in the 1846 and thirty trainers and 309 nands in 1896. Many in the racing community were British—76% of the jockeys, lads and trainers in 1911—and the British were such a presence in the area that an Anglican chapel was built around 1870.

At the same time, Chantilly was becoming a vacation destination with many aristocrats, members of the &quot;haute bourgeoisie&quot; and artists moving to the area and building villas and chateaux in the surrounding communes, such as the Rothschild family in Gouvieux, for example. Luxury hotels were also built, such as the Hôtel du Grand Condé in 1908. Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale, last lord of the town, encouraged the development of the racecourse and of the town as well as the arrival of the English.

Between 1876 and 1882, the Duke had the château rebuilt and used it to house one of the most beautiful art collections of the time. By receiving high society in his palace, such as Empress Elizabeth of Austria, known as Sissi, and the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovitch of Russia, he contributed to the growth of the town. When the château was opened to the public in 1898 after it was willed to the Institute of France, it drew even more tourists to the town—more than 100,000 in the first six months.

Naturally such a profusion of wealth also provoked some greed. On the morning of 25 March 1912, the Bonnot Gang robbed the Société Générale de Chantilly and killed two employees before they fled. This was soon before they broke up and Jules Bonnot died in a shootout with police. The groups was notorious for using an automobile to get away and for the coverage provoked by a Jules Bonnot&#x27;s appearance, brandishing a Browning automatic, at the office of &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot; to complain about its coverage of their activities.

===Chantilly in World War I===
The German Army entered Chantilly on 3 September 1914 but did not stay, leaving the next day. The château was occupied but there was no real destruction, unlike the neighboring towns of Creil and Senlis, Oise, where there were fires and considerable destruction. French soldiers did not come back until 9 September. After the First Battle of the Marne, General Joseph Joffre installed his headquarters in Chantilly because of the easy access it offered to Paris by rail. The Grand Quartier-Général, or HQ, took over the hôtel du Grand Condé on 29 November 1914 with 450 officers and 800 clerks and soldiers. Joffre for his part lodged at the Villa Poiret about a hundred yards away.

Joffre held the conference of Chantilly from 6 to 8 December 1915 to makes battle plans with his Allied counterparts and to coordinate military offensives for 1916. General Headquarters moved to Beauvais in December 1916, and Chantilly became home to hospitals for soldiers wounded on the front, one in the hôtel Lovenjou, the other in the Egler Pavilion. One of the three camouflage workshops of the French First Engineers Regiment opened in 1917 in custom-built barracks on the &quot;petite pelouse&quot; near the racetrack. Up to 1200 women were hired, as well as 200 German prisoners of war and 200 workers from Annam in French Indo-China (then a French protectorate). They painted canvases which the army used to mask artillery and troop movements from view.

The town grew in 1928 with the annexation of the Bois Saint-Denis from Gouvieux. In 1930 a monument was put up to Maréchal Joffre on the avenue which now bears his name.

===World War II===
The Wehrmacht entered the city on 13 September 1940, and occupied it. They used the Great Stables as a veterinary hospital for the horses they brought in from Germany, by some estimates the city was home to as many as 400 German horses during the war. The military command took over the hôtel du Grand Condé. Following the assassination of a collaborator, the parish priest, Abbot Charpentier, who authored a 1943 anti-Nazi sermon, was arrested along with several French Resistance fighters he had supported. He was deported to the Mauthausen camp, where he died 7 August 1944. The viaduct at La Canardière was bombed by Allied forces on 30 May 1944, and the town was liberated by American tanks on 31 August 1944. The American 8th Air Force in turn installed itself at the hôtel du Grand Condé.

===Post-war Chantilly===
Since the war, the city has developed new neighborhoods on the north side of town. Some hotels and villas at the center of town became residences; some stables were torn down to allow housing to be built. As this new housing was built, a new population moved in who mostly work in the Paris area, while the town lost almost all of its remaining industrial base when the Guilleminot factories shut down in 1992.

=== Château de Chantilly ===

The château de Chantilly was built for the House of Montmorency, then was home to the Condés and finally to the Duke of Aumale, fifth son of Louis-Philippe. He willed it to the Institute of France. Le château has two parts: the &quot;Petit Château&quot; and the &quot;Château Neuf&quot;. The first was built in 1560 by the architect Jean Bullant for the constable Anne de Montmorency. The interior decoration goes back to the 18th century for the larger apartments, and was carried out by Jean Aubert, Jean-Baptiste Huet, and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. The smaller apartments redone in the 19th century are on the ground floor. The &quot;Château Neuf&quot; was built by architect Honoré Daumet between 1876 and 1882 on the site of the portion of the older building destroyed at the beginning of the 19th century. It contains paint galleries, libraries and the chapel. A gallery, built by architecte Félix Duban in the 1840s, links the two buildings. The château is surrounded by a 115-hectare (285 acre) park which includes 25 hectares (62 acres) of water gardens. The parks includes large formal gardens designed by André Le Nôtre, the Anglo-Chinese garden installed between 1772 and 1774 in the center of which is the Hameau de Chantilly, the English garden installed in 1817 around the temple of Venus on the western side and, near the forest, the La Cabotière and de Sylvie parks. The entire estate was designated a historic monument by the decrees of 24 October and December 1988.

===Musée Condé===
The Condé Museum in the château has one of the oldest collections of historic art in France and its collection of paintings is only surpassed in France by the Musée du Louvre. The museum also contains a collection of 1,300 manuscripts including the daybook &quot;Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry&quot;. As a condition of its bequest to the Institut de France by the Duke of Aumale, the collection&#x27;s presentation cannot be modified nor can it be loaned out, so it is a permanent fixture of Chantilly.

===The Great Stables===
The &quot;Grandes Écuries&quot;, which contain the Living Museum of the Horse, are among the most-visited horse-racing sites in the world. They were built between 1719 and 1740 by Jean Aubert. They are 186 meters (610&#x27;) long with a central dome 38 meters (125&#x27;) high, and could accommodate 240 horses and 500 dogs for the daily rides to hunt. Dressage demonstrations or re-enactments are held daily in the quarry. Horse shows are regularly held beneath the dome.

===Porte Saint-Denis===
The porte Saint-Denis is part of an unfinished pavilion originally intended to provide symmetry with the current entrance of the Great Stables, on the other side of the open-air stables. When the Duke of Bourbon died in 1740, only this portion remained unfinished when construction stopped. This pavilion was to mark the entrance to the burgeoning city. Its name came from the old land holdings of the Abbey of Saint-Denis, which was once very close to the château.

== Urban development ==

As a city, Chantilly is less than 250 years old. The oldest part is the rue du Connétable, which began in 1727 as a planned allotment called &quot;the officials&#x27; housing&quot;, allocated from part of the château estate. These buildings are now numbered 25 through 67 on the rue du Connétable. The rest of the neighborhood was sold to the end of the main street, where the Condé hospice stood before the French Revolution.

After 1799, the town spread over the old footprint of the château gardens, with street names recalling the different gardens and sometimes following their old paths. The rue des Potagers, rue de la Faisanderie, and rue des Cascades are examples of this, i.e. Vegetable Street, Pheasantry Street and Waterfall Street. Street numbers here begin from the château rather than from the place Omer Vallon as in other neighborhoods. Development took the form of town houses, small 19th century buildings and other villas surrounded by gardens. Traces also exist of old stables dating from the beginnings of the racehorse community at the start of the 19th century.

Along the avenue du maréchal Joffre development was tied to the Paris road and the arrival of the railway. The station is at the end of the avenue. Here small buildings and villas built in the 19th and 20th century reflect the residential nature the town took on in this period. The area has become progressively more built up as villas and their gardens were replaced with private residences and master houses were transformed into multi-family dwellings.

Chantilly has three outer neighborhoods:

The Bois Saint-Denis lies south of town, between the Paris road and the railway. This neighborhood grew out of the construction of stables, which got further and further from the center of town as land became more scarce. Forest parcels belonging to the Duke of Aumale began to be developed in 1890. While this neighborhood was originally within Gouvieux, it became part of Chantilly in 1928. It was then composed of brick stables, trainer residences and lodgings for the lads and jockeys. For a long time it was almost entirely devoted to racing, but over time, beginning in the 1960s, many stables were demolished or transformed into apartment buildings or housing subdivisions. Building codes now specifically protect this heritage and these racing activities.

The Verdun area is at the site of the old train station for the racetrack. (see the article on the Gare de Chantilly – Gouvieux in the French Wikipedia), and lies between the railway and the forest. When the old station closed around 1950, the land was used for apartment buildings, originally limited to railway workers. Much of it still belongs to the SNCF. The city&#x27;s two high schools are nearby.

North of town neighborhoods lie on terraces overlooking the Nonette. These are made up of public housing (le quartier Lefébure), small subdivisions and privately owned multifamily residences (résidence Sylvie, résidence du Coq Chantant or du Castel) built during the 1960s and 1970s. These neighborhoods have developed their own school and church as well as other amenities used by the city as a whole, such as open space and a stadium.
An intermediate area between the north end of town and the downtown area contains green zones such as the Grand Canal, the Saint-Jean canal and lying between them, in the meadow of the Grand Canal, the community gardens in the area known as La Canardière. The few buildings in this area are tied to Chantilly&#x27;s old industrial base, such as the François Richard-Lenoir factory and the old Guilleminot factory and its outbuildings.

There are no specific protections for historic buildings or neighborhood preservation, nor is there a historic district such as in Senlis, but the town has local development codes and urban development plans. Much of the land (69%) in Chantilly is forest, so taking the racecourse into account the city only manages about 25% of its land, much of it around the historic monuments and therefore subject to architectural constraints.

==Economy==
The economy of Chantilly has always been intimately associated with the French aristocracy. The most important economic activity, even today, is horse racing, which sprang up in the area due to the nobles who lived nearby. The other major economic center is on tourism.

Slightly more than half of the local population participates in the labor market, and when residents younger than fifteen and older than 64 are excluded the figure rises to 80%. Much of the active workforce, 41%, is employed outside of the Oise, almost all of them in Île-de-France, either in Paris proper or in the area around the Charles de Gaulle Airport. This proportion has been gradually increasing over time. Approximately 7,000 commuters travel into Île-de-France every day.

There are no large employers in Chantilly or its immediate environs. The largest is the Lycee Jean Rostand, followed by the city itself and the information technology company EDI. None has more than 250 employees. On 1 January 2007, the city had 801 business, 193 of them retail. The unemployment rate at the most recent census was 8.4% vs 10.7% for the Oise as a whole. For labor market purposes Chantilly is considered part of the Sud-Oise, which, along with Amiens, is the largest labor pool in Picardy.

===Horse racing===
Chantilly is the largest center of horse training activities in France, with 2,633 horses, 2,620 of them thoroughbreds, lodged in approximately a hundred training stables. This represents 70% of the race horses in Paris. The next closest, at Maisons-Laffitte, only has about 800. About two thousand area residents are directly or indirectly employed in this field.

Given the real estate crunch inside city limits, nowadays stables can only be found in the Bois St-Denis neighborhood, where there are thirty, which specialise in gallop. Fifty-four others, also specializing in gallop, can be found in Lamorlaye, Gouvieux, Coye-la-Forêt and to a lesser extent at Avilly-Saint-Léonard. Fifty-nine jockeys live in Chantilly and 109 in the rest of the municipal area.

Trainers in the area include Criquette Head-Maarek, Freddy Head, Pascal Bary, André Fabre, Marcel Rolland, Élie Lellouche, Nicolas Clément, Alain de Royer-Dupré and those attached to the stables of Karim Aga Khan IV. Jockeys in the area include Dominique Bœuf, Christophe-Patrice Lemaire, Olivier Peslier, Thierry Thuilliez and Thierry Jarnet.

====France Galop====
The stables affiliated with France Galop use a number of installations that the organisation manages and maintains. 60 permanent and 30 seasonal employees work at these installations, which encompass 1,900 hectares (7¼ sq. mi.). Among these installations is the des Aigles track at Gouvieux as well as others at Lamorlaye and Coye-la-Forêt, which has thirty-odd trainers working in a 60-hectare (150 acre) facility, as well as the 15-hectare (40 acre) track at Avilly-Saint-Léonard. France Galop also manages 47 kilometres (30 miles) of trails covering 1,500 hectares (5¾ sq. mi.) in Chantilly Forest, which are strictly limited to horses at certain times of day.

In all, the organisation manages 120 hectares (300 acres) of grass, 120 kilometres (75 miles) of sand trail and one dirt trail used 365 days a year regardless of the weather, which translates to 33,000 gallops a year including 2,000 at the racecourse alone.

====Equine businesses====

A number of professionals and businesses specializing in racehorses have grown up in the Chantilly area. Two prominent horse transportation companies are based in Lamorlaye and Gouvieux respectively. Three veterinarians within the municipal boundaries specialize in horses, and another five in the adjacent communes. Chantilly has one farrier and there are another four nearby. Similarly, there is one saddler and another seven based outside town. Chantilly has two racehorse dealers; another five are based in the surrounding area.

A horse-racing school, AFASEC&#x27;s &quot;The Windmill&quot; is based in Gouvieux and provides instruction to 185 jockeys and trainees, many of whom are housed in a facility in Chantilly proper. Finally, there are plans to build a biomass plant that will use the manure generated by the stables.

====Racecourse====

The racecourse hosts 25 meets and 197 races every year, including the prestigious Prix du Jockey Club and Prix de Diane. It is one of six Parisian racecourses managed by France Galop, although it is owned by the Institut de France.

When it was threatened with closing, 24 million euros were raised to modernize it by a public interest group that included the mayor&#x27;s office, France Galop, the Institute of France, the Communauté de communes de l&#x27;aire cantilienne (CCAC), an intergovernmental commission of Chantilly-area governments, the Oise council, the Picary regional council, and Prince Karim Aga Khan. Work was completed in 2007 and included a new ring, repairs and modernization of the stands, a scale and a new parking area. It now receives 40,000 visitors a year.

===Tourism===

Tourism in Chantilly centers on the Domaine de Chantilly, which owns the chateau and associated lands. The chateau itself had roughly a quarter million visitors in 2007, while the Living Museum of the Horse drew 149,000. The other big tourist draw is Chantilly Forest, which received as many as four million visits yearly. This makes it the 7th most-visited forest in the Paris region. Most of the visitors are day excursionists. Unlike Versailles and Fontainebleau, foreign tourists account for only 15% of the traffic, which can at peak times reach 20,000 simultaneous visitors to the various Domaine properties. Every year an international show jumping competition, the Chantilly Jumping, which is part of the Global Champions Tour, is held in 2 arenas in the middle of the racecourse.

Chantilly lies within the Parc naturel régional Oise-Pays de France. The medieval city of Senlis and its cathedral, the abbeys of Chaalis, Moncel, and Royaumont, and the priory at Saint-Leu-d&#x27;Esserent are nearby. Natural attractions include the forests of Halatte and Ermenonville, and Parc Jean-Jacques-Rousseau in Ermenonville. Nearby theme parks like La Mer de sable and Parc Astérix also draw visitors to the area.

In 2005, due to difficulties the Institute of France was experiencing with the management of the domain, the more important elements of the domain were taken over by a non-profit corporation created and supported financially by the Aga Khan, charged with economic development, restoration and the development of tourism.

Business tourism is another important factor. Proximity to Paris and to the Charles de Gaulle airport combine with the high quality of local hotel properties make it a prime conference destination. More than two thousand are held there every year. Chantilly and its immediate vicinity have three four-star hotels:

* the Dolce in Vineuil-Saint-Firmin
* the Montvillargenne in Gouvieux
* the Mont-Royal a little further away at La Chapelle-en-Serval

There are also four three-star hotels. A conference center run by the Capgemini corporation is also located in the immediate vicinity, in Gouvieux. Another four-star hotel is being built in the Rue du Connétable near the Jeu de Paume, with an additional luxury residence planned for Avilly-Saint-Léonard.

===Chantilly Arts and Elegance Richard Mille===
The automobile elegance contest of Chantilly Arts &amp; Elegance Richard Mille takes place in the castle, similar to the Concorso d&#x27;Eleganza Villa d&#x27;Este in Italy, Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance in California and Amelia Island Concours d&#x27;Elegance in Florida.

==Communication and transportation==

===Roads===
The old king&#x27;s road that once connected Pierrefitte-sur-Seine to Dunkirk by way of Amiens bisects Chantilly from north to south. Formerly known as route nationale 16 this road has been renamed departmental road 1016. Trucks are not illegal on this road, but signs to the north and south of town suggest taking the A1 or A16 instead. The D924a connects to the Flanders road, the old route nationale 17, at La Chapelle-en-Serval. The D924 runs to Senlis. Trucks are banned on both of these roads, which connect to the A1. The speed limit on D924a is 70 km/h (45 mph) for its entire length through the commune, since it passes through Chantilly Forest, which has many deer crossings.

===Rail and public transportation===

The Chantilly-Gouvieux train station was put into service in 1859 on the Paris–Lille railway. It is served by the SNCF via the TER Hauts-de-France network. Express trains reach Paris-Nord in 22 minutes and Creil in seven.

The station is also served by line D of the Île-de-France RER. In 2006, 920,000 trips took place between Chantilly and Paris-Nord.

A small public bus network, (DUC), links the Lefébure neighborhood to Bois-St-Denis by way of the train station. A branch goes past the château and the Saint-Pierre cemetery. Passengers ride for free.

===Airports and airport access===
Chantilly is 30 km (19 miles) from Charles de Gaulle Airport and 54 km (34 miles) from the Beauvais-Tillé Airport. There is no direct route to either by public transportation.

An airfield named aérodrome de la Vidamée-Chantilly was opened in 1910 in Courteuil and served as a military air base during World War I. It has since disappeared. Another airfield, known as terrain de Chantilly-Les Aigles, was created during World War II by requisitioning the Les Aigles horse training center in Gouvieux. It was occupied during the Battle of France by the chase group I/1 from the Étampes-Mondésir air base.

=== Trails ===

Two hiking trails cross the commune. The GR 11 circles the greater Paris area and runs between Senlis and Saint Maximin. It cuts through the parc de Sylvie on the château grounds, goes through the Porte Saint-Denis and descends to the Saint-Jean canal, running alongside it until it cuts across the neighborhood known as Coq chantant (Crowing Rooster). The GR 12, which runs from Paris to Amsterdam, goes from Senlis through the south end of town towards the Commelles ponds, then reaches Coye-la-Forêt. The GR 1, known as Tour de Paris, runs along the southeastern edge of town on the south bank of the Commelles ponds.

Chantilly Forest is criss-crossed with many paths, which are barred to pedestrians between 6 am and 1 pm, to allow horses to be trained. Chantilly finished a network of bike paths in June 2008 which allow access by bike to Gouvieux, Vineuil-Saint-Firmin et Avilly-Saint-Léonard.

* The Château de Chantilly
* The Chantilly Racecourse

== International relations ==
Chantilly is twinned with:
* Watermael-Boitsfort, Belgium
* Überlingen, Germany
* Epsom and Ewell, UK

== Climate ==
The climate in Val-d&#x27;Oise is comparable to that of the northern part of Île-de-France; it has been described as falling somewhere between the oceanic climate of Brest on the coast and the continental climate of Strasbourg. Rainfall is relatively light and with moderately heavy rainfall in spring and early summer, then again in the autumn, which is typical of oceanic climates, but storms are of the continental variety.

<text>Rose Amy Fyleman (6 March, 1877–1 August, 1957) was an English writer and poet, noted for her works on the fairy folk, for children. Her poem &quot;There are fairies at the bottom of our garden&quot; was set to music by English composer Liza Lehmann. Her carol &quot;Lift your hidden faces&quot;, set to a French carol tune, was included in the Anglican hymnal &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; (1925), The Oxford Book of Carols (1928) as well as in the Hutterian Brotherhood&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Light&quot; (1977).

==Life and works==

Rose Fyleman was born in Nottingham on 6 March 1877, the third child of John Feilmann and his wife, Emilie, née Loewenstein, who was of Russian extraction. Her father was in the lace trade, and his Jewish family originated in 1860 from Jever in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, currently Lower Saxony, Germany.

As a young girl, Fyleman was educated at a private school, and at the age of nine first saw one of her compositions published in a local paper. Although she entered University College, Nottingham, she failed in the intermediate and was thus unable to pursue her ambition of becoming a schoolteacher. Despite this, Fyleman had a good singing voice, and therefore decided to study music. She studied singing in Paris, Berlin and finally at the Royal College of Music in London, where she received her diploma as associate of the Royal College of Music. She returned to Nottingham shortly afterward, where she taught signing and helped in her sister&#x27;s school. Along with other members of her family, she anglicised the spelling of her name at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

When she was forty, Fyleman sent her verses to &quot;Punch&quot; magazine and her first publication &quot;There are Fairies at the Bottom of Our Garden&quot; appeared in May 1917. The immense response from publishers prompted Fyleman to submit several other fairy poems. Her verses enjoyed tremendous success among readers and her first collection &quot;Fairies and Chimneys&quot; (1918) was reprinted more than twenty times over the next decade. During the 1920s and early 1930s Rose Fyleman published multiple verse collections, wrote drama for children, and for two years, edited the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;. Fyleman was also a skilled linguist who translated books from German, French and Italian, including the Bibi children&#x27;s stories of Danish writer Karin Michaëlis.

Rose Fyleman was one of the most successful children&#x27;s writers of her generation and she saw much of her earlier poetry become proverbial. She died at a nursing home in St. Albans, Hertfordshire on 1 August 1957.

==Poem about Winnipeg==

In December 1929, Rose Fyleman was invited to Winnipeg, Canada, as the guest speaker at a couple of women&#x27;s clubs. She was staying at the Fort Garry Hotel, near the Manitoba Parliament Building on Broadway Ave. One evening, Rose and the president of one of the clubs decided to take a stroll to the parliament building, so that Rose could view the statue of Queen Victoria, located on its front lawn. It was such a beautiful winter evening that when they got back to the hotel, Rose was inspired to write a poem entitled &quot;Winnipeg at Christmas.&quot; The poem appeared in print soon after—on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1930—in the British magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. This poem is familiar to many inhabitants of Winnipeg, who were first exposed to it in school, and is often cited during the Christmas season. Fred Penner, a children&#x27;s entertainer from Winnipeg, included it on his 1990 recording for Christmas, entitled &quot;The Season.&quot; In 2018 The Winnipeg Singers, a choir from Winnipeg, commissioned composer Michael A. McKay to write a choral setting of the poem and premiered it in their 2018 Christmas concert, &quot;In Winnipeg It&#x27;s Christmas&quot;.

<doc id="1074512" wikidata="Q5574688" url="?curid=1074512" title="Go (verb)">
<text>The verb go is an irregular verb in the English language (see English irregular verbs). It has a wide range of uses; its basic meaning is &quot;to move from one place to another&quot;. Apart from the copular verb &quot;be&quot;, the verb &quot;go&quot; is the only English verb to have a suppletive past tense, namely &quot;went&quot;.

==Principal parts==

The principal parts of &quot;go&quot; are &quot;go, went, gone&quot;. In other respects, the modern English verb conjugates regularly. The irregularity of the principal parts is due to their disparate origin in definitely two and possibly three distinct Indo-European roots.

Unlike every other English verb except &quot;be&quot;, the preterite (simple past tense) of &quot;go&quot; is not etymologically related to its infinitive. Instead, the preterite of &quot;go&quot;, &quot;went&quot;, descends from a variant of the preterite of &quot;wend&quot;, the descendant of Old English &quot;wendan&quot; and Middle English &quot;wenden&quot;. Old English &quot;wendan&quot; (modern &quot;wend&quot;) and &quot;gān&quot; (mod. &quot;go&quot;) shared semantic similarities. The similarities are evident in the sentence &quot;I&#x27;m wending my way home&quot;, which is equivalent to &quot;I&#x27;m going home&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Go&quot; descends from Middle English &quot;gon&quot;, &quot;goon&quot;, from Old English &quot;gān&quot;, from Proto-Germanic *&quot;gāną&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *&quot;ǵʰēh₁&quot;- &#x27;to go, leave&#x27;. Cognates in the Germanic languages include West Frisian &quot;gean&quot;, Dutch &quot;gaan&quot;, Low German &quot;gahn&quot;, German &quot;gehen&quot;, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish &quot;gå&quot;, Crimean Gothic &quot;geen&quot;.

===Origin of &quot;ēode&quot;===
Old English did not use any variation of &quot;went&quot; for the general preterite of &quot;go&quot;; instead, the word &quot;ēode&quot; (variant &quot;ġeēode&quot;) was used, which lingered on as the now obsolete &quot;yede&quot;, &quot;yode&quot; and &quot;yead&quot;. 

Old English &quot;ēode&quot; &#x27;he went&#x27; (plural &quot;ēodon&quot;) is made up of a defective preterite base &quot;ēo&quot;- and the weak dental suffix -&quot;de&quot; common in most modern English past tense forms (cf. &quot;ache&quot; : &quot;ached&quot;). The base &quot;ēo&quot;- and its Gothic counterpart &quot;iddja&quot; (pl. &quot;iddjedun&quot;) show the following development:
* PIE perfect singular *&quot;&quot; (singular) → Proto-Germanic *&quot;ijō-dē&quot; → *&quot;eōdæ&quot; → &quot;ēode&quot;
* PIE perfect plural *&#x27; (plural) → *&quot;jejj&quot;- (Holtzmann&#x27;s law) → *&quot;jijj-&quot; (i-mutation) → Proto-Germanic *&quot;ijjēdun&quot;- → Gothic &quot;iddjēdun&quot;.

Both forms are derived from the PIE root *&#x27; (late *&#x27;) based on close matches with past tense forms of Sanskrit &quot;yā́ti&quot; &#x27;he goes, travels&#x27; (cf. imperfect &quot;áyāt&quot;, perfect &quot;yayáu&quot;, and aorist &quot;áyāsam&quot;). The root is regarded as an iterative-intensive derivative of the more common *&#x27; &#x27;to go&#x27; (present *&#x27;). One reflex of *&quot;&quot; is Latin &quot;īre&quot; &#x27;to go&#x27; (present &quot;eō&quot; &#x27;I go&#x27;) which gave many English words such as amb&quot;ition&quot;, ex&quot;it&quot;, intro&quot;it&quot;, issue, preter&quot;ite&quot;, and so forth. It is also found in the Slavic languages as &quot;iti&quot; and similar forms.

===Development of a new preterite===
In Middle English, &quot;ēode&quot; evolved into &quot;ȝede&quot;, &quot;yede&quot;, and &quot;yode&quot;. By the 15th century in southern England, &quot;wende&quot; (&quot;wend&quot;) had become synonymous with &quot;go&quot;, but its infinitive and present tense forms had ceased to be in frequent use. This was also true of the various &quot;ēode&quot;-derived preterites of &quot;go&quot;, thus a variant preterite of &quot;wend&quot; absorbed the function. After &quot;went&quot; became established as the preterite of &quot;go&quot;, &quot;wend&quot; took on a new preterite, &quot;wended&quot;. In Northern English and Scots, &quot;yede&quot; was &quot;gaed&quot;, regularly formed by suffixing &quot;-ed&quot; to a variant of &quot;go&quot;. Due to the influence of the region, southern English forms constitute the standard language of England, and so &quot;went&quot; is the standard English preterite. Spencer used &quot;yede&quot; to mean &quot;go&quot; with &quot;yode&quot; as its preterite form but as dialect.

===Origin of &quot;went&quot;===
&quot;Went&quot;, the modern past tense of &quot;go&quot;, was originally the preterite form of Middle English &quot;wenden&quot; &#x27;to turn, direct; depart&#x27; (modern English &quot;wend&quot;), from Old English &quot;wendan&quot; (past &quot;wende&quot;, &quot;ġewend&quot;), itself from Proto-Germanic *&quot;wandijaną&quot; &#x27;to turn&#x27; (transitive). Cognates include West Frisian &quot;weine&quot;, Dutch, Low German, German &quot;wenden&quot;, Yiddish ווענדן (&quot;vendn&quot;), Swedish &quot;vända&quot;, Danish, Norwegian &quot;vende&quot;, and Gothic &quot;wandjan&quot;. The original forms of the ME past tense were &quot;wende&quot;, &quot;wended&quot; (our modern form), and past participle &quot;wend&quot;, but variant &quot;wente&quot; developed from about 1200. By &quot;ca&quot;. 1500, &quot;wended&quot; had prevailed in the transitive senses, whereas &quot;wente&quot;, restricted to intransitive senses, rivalled and replaced &quot;go&quot;&#x27;s older past tense, &quot;yede&quot;/&quot;yode&quot;. 

Proto-Germanic *&quot;wandijaną&quot; is a causative derivative of *&quot;windaną&quot; &#x27;to wind, wrap&#x27;, from which the modern English verb &quot;wind&quot; developed. Cognates include West Frisian &quot;wine&quot;, Dutch, Low German, German &quot;winden&quot;, Swedish &quot;vinda&quot;, Danish and Norwegian &quot;vinde&quot;, and Gothic -&quot;windan&quot; (in &quot;biwindan&quot; &#x27;to wind around, wrap&#x27;). PGmc *&quot;windaną&quot; comes from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot; &#x27;to wind, twist&#x27;, which also gave Umbrian pre&quot;uenda&quot; &#x27;turn!&#x27; (imperative), Tocharian A/B &quot;wänt&quot;/&quot;wänträ&quot; &#x27;covers, envelops&#x27;, Greek (Hesychius) &quot;áthras&quot; &#x27;wagon&#x27;, Armenian &quot;gind&quot; &#x27;ring&#x27;, and Sanskrit &quot;vandhúra&quot; &#x27;carriage framework&#x27;.

===Summary of the main Proto-Indo-European roots===
&quot;Go&quot; is historically derived from at least three Proto-Indo-European roots: *&quot;ǵʰēh₁&quot;, the source of &quot;go&quot; and &quot;gone&quot; (← ME &quot;gon&quot;, &quot;ygon&quot; ← OE &quot;ġegān&quot;); *&quot;h₁ei&quot;, the source of &quot;ēode&quot;; and *&quot;u̯endʰ&quot;, the source of &quot;went&quot; as well as &quot;wend&quot; and &quot;wind&quot;. Only two roots are continually used in their modern English reflexes &quot;go&quot;/&quot;gone&quot; and &quot;went&quot;.

==Suppletion in other Germanic languages==
The Dutch, Low German, German, and Scandinavian verbs cognate to &quot;go&quot;, e.g. Dutch &quot;gaan&quot;, Low German &quot;gahn&quot;, German &quot;gehen&quot;, and Danish/Norwegian/Swedish &quot;gå&quot;, also have suppletive past forms, namely the preterite &quot;ging&quot; of Dutch and German, &quot;güng&quot; of Low German, &quot;gick&quot; (from the same source) of Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, and the past participle &quot;gegangen&quot; of German. These forms are relics from earlier, more widespread words that meant &#x27;to walk, go&#x27; and which survive sporadically in Scots &quot;gang&quot;, East Frisian &quot;gunge&quot;, and Icelandic &quot;ganga&quot;. Some obsolete cognates include Middle Low German, Middle High German &quot;gangen&quot;, early modern Swedish &quot;gånga&quot;, and Gothic &quot;gaggan&quot;. These are reflexes of Proto-Germanic *&quot;ganganą&quot;, from Proto-Indo-European *&quot;&quot; &#x27;to step&#x27;, which also gave Lithuanian &quot;žeñgti&quot; &#x27;to stride&#x27;, Greek &quot;kochōnē&quot; &#x27;perineum&#x27;, Avestan &quot;zanga&quot; &#x27;ankle&#x27;, and Sanskrit &quot;jáṁhas&quot; &#x27;step&#x27;, &quot;jaṅghā&quot; &#x27;shank&#x27;.

Therefore, the case of English &quot;go&quot; is not unique among the Germanic languages, and it would appear that most have in a like manner reproduced equivalent suppletive conjugations for their words for &#x27;to go&#x27;, suggesting a cyclical change patterned after the state of affairs in Proto-Germanic.

==Phrasal forms==
The verb may be combined with various prepositions to form phrasal verbs such as &quot;go around&quot; and &quot;go off&quot;.

The verb &quot;go&quot; is used to form the &quot;going to&quot; future, in sentences like &quot;I&#x27;m going to finish my work today.&quot;

==Perfect forms==
In perfect forms of the verb (&quot;have gone&quot;, &quot;had gone&quot;, etc.) the past participle &quot;gone&quot; is often replaced by that of &quot;be&quot;, namely been. For example:
*He&#x27;s been to the shops. (He went and came back)
*He&#x27;s gone to the shops. (He&#x27;s there now)

For details of this usage, see &quot;have been&quot;.

<text>Stavros Xarchakos, Greek: Σταύρος Ξαρχάκος (born 14 March 1939) is a Greek composer and conductor.

Stavros Xarchakos was born in Athens, where he studied at the Athens Conservatoire. He has family origins from the Mani Peninsula. He emerged in the Greek music scene around 1963, composing music for the theatre and cinema. Among his collaborators was lyricist Lefteris Papadopoulos and singer Nikos Xylouris.

In 1967 he went to Paris to study with Nadia Boulanger. He stayed in Paris for four years, and then studied with David Diamond at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. He served as director of the National Orchestra of Greek Music.

He was later involved in politics and was elected Member of the Greek Parliament twice, before becoming a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2000 to 2004. He was again a candidate for the European Parliament with New Democracy, in the elections of 25 May 2014, but was not elected.

== Early life and education ==

Stavros Xarchakos was born on March 14, 1939, in the centre of Athens, where he lives to this day. He comes from Laconian Mani. Growing up in a neighbourhood of the capital, where the arts flourished, he came into contact with folk and rebetiko songs, but also with the European music, broadcast on the radio, while he was strongly influenced by church music. He also received musical inspiration from his grandmother, who played the guitar and sang along with arias from operas and cantadas. From an early age he showed an interest in music and attended cello and piano lessons.

In 1958 he was admitted to the Athens Conservatory, where his first studies in music took place. In 1968, while he was at a very productive moment in his career, wishing to develop his music and broaden his knowledge, he decided to study music and composition in Paris, as a student of the leading French musicologist and pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, until 1973.

In 1978, wishing to study the technique of classical music and immerse himself in harmony, composition and orchestra conducting, he decided to continue his studies at the Juilliard School in New York, at the urging of Leonard Bernstein, with whom he corresponded, after he was brought into contact with him by Kimon Friar, an internationally renowned academic and translator of the work of Nikos Kazantzakis. At the Juilliard School he studied alongside David Diamond for three years. He was taught score analysis under Bernstein for two years and conducted many concerts. An example is the concert held in New York, in which he conducted the city&#x27;s Symphony Orchestra.

== Career ==

At the beginning of his career, he distinguished himself as a composer of film and theatre music. His album production begins in 1963 and includes more than 45 records, music for 21 films and 15 television productions.

In 1961 he composed music for Jane Arden&#x27;s play &quot;The Party&quot;. In 1963, at the age of 24, he took over the music composition for the emblematic film &quot;Ta Kokkina Fanaria&quot;, directed by Vassilis Georgiadis. The film received rave reviews and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1964 and was suggested for nomination for the Palme d&#x27;Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The same-titled album was released that year and was enriched with new songs. A little later he composed music for the film &quot;Lola&quot; directed by Dinos Dimopoulos. Among the musical themes and songs of the film, &quot;Hathike to Feggari&quot; stood out, performed by Vicky Moscholiou.

In 1964, he composed the music for the songs included in a series of documentaries entitled &quot;Melina&#x27;s Greece&quot;, which were created by the American television network ABC to promote Greece. Melina Merkouri, performed the songs &quot;Ti echei kai klaiei to paidi&quot; and &quot;Na me thymasai” with lyrics by Eftychia Papagiannopoulou and Vangelis Goufas, respectively.

In 1965 he composed the music for the film &quot;Monterna Stachtopouta (Modern Cinderella)&quot; written and directed by Alekos Sakellariou, while the following year for the film &quot;Diplopenies&quot; directed by Giorgos Scalenakis. The second film features the songs &quot;Matia Vourkomena&quot;, &quot;Stou Othona ta chronia&quot; and &quot;Me ti kardia (Farewell)&quot;, in lyrics by Nikos Gatsos, performed by the actor Dimitris Papamichail. The film was presented at the San Sebastián festival and the Cannes Film Festival under the title &quot;The Syrtaki&quot; and travelled to Japan, England and France. The album was released the following year in an English version, with Grigoris Bithikotsis, Vicky Moscholiou and Stamatis Kokota as performers. In 1966, the album &quot;I Ellas choris syntrimia&quot; was released, which includes his and Theodorakis songs. His music had accompanied the documentary of the same title by Angelos Lambros.

In 1968 he composed the music for the film &quot;Koritsia ston Ilio&quot;, directed by Vasilis Georgiadis, which won four awards at the Thessaloniki Film Festival,
including best music, while in 1969 the movie was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1968, his first work on the rebetiko song titled &quot;Markos o daskalos mas&quot; was released, which includes twelve songs by Markos Vamvakaris, from his own perspective.

In 1972, the film was presented in Japan. He also composed five of the songs included in Nana Mouschouri&#x27;s album &quot;Spiti mou Spitaki mou&quot;, with lyrics by Nikos Gatsos. In the same year, he composed the music for the film &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, the well-known ancient comedy of Aristophanes. In 1973, he composed the music for the TV series &quot;Oi emporoi ton ethnon&quot;, based on the same-titled novel by Alexandros Papadiamantis. There, the memorable song &quot;Itane mia fora&quot; performed by Nikos Xylouris is heard for the first time.

In 1973, he also composed the music for the theatrical performance &quot;To megalo mas tsirko&quot;, by Iakovos Campanellis, a satirical look back at the modern history of the country. The play became a vehicle for expressing the protest of the Greek citizens against the dictatorial regime and the actors were persecuted. After the restoration of democracy, he composed the music for the song &quot;Proskynima&quot; which was added to the performance to honour the victims of the Polytechnic University. In 1966, together with Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis, they fought for the abolition of art censorship, which had been imposed by the dictatorial regime. He and the performer Nikos Xylouris, used to sing at the Polytechnic University supporting the anti-dictatorship struggle of the students.

In 1974, the album &quot;Nyn kai aei&quot; was released, performed by Viki Moscholiou and Nikos Dimitratos, as well as the album &quot;Syllogi&quot; performed by Nikos Xylouris. In 1976 he composed the music for the play &quot;O peirasmos&quot; by Grigoris Xenopoulos, with the album of the same title released the following year with the protagonist of the play, Aliki Vougiouklakis, as the performer.

Also, driven by his love and interest in classical music, in addition to folk and art music, he has composed works for a symphony orchestra, among which stand out the symphonic poem of 1969 &quot;Kyra-Panagia&quot;, the &quot;Piano Concerto&quot; of 1971, &quot;Endopsis&quot; of 1979 for baritone and orchestra, in poetry by Giorgos Seferis, the suite for orchestra of 1982 &quot;Anamniseis&quot;.

Returning from his studies in New York in 1983, he composed the music for the film &quot;To Rebetiko&quot;, directed by Kostas Ferris. The lyrics of the songs were written by Nikos Gatsos. The film won four awards at the Thessaloniki Film Festival, including the special music award. The film won the Silver Bear award at the 34th Berlin Film Festival, while at the same time it was distinguished at the Valencia and Alexandria Film Festivals. In the same year he composed the music for the BBC television series &quot;The dark side of the Sun&quot;, filmed in Rhodes, while in 1986 he composed the music for the film &quot;Sweet Country&quot;, directed by Michalis Kakogiannis, which deals with the events of the dictatorship in Chile.

In 1986, his song &quot;Ta traina pou fygan&quot; was performed by the Greek mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa, to be included in the album released internationally entitled &quot;Songs my country taught me&quot;. His collaboration with Mpaltsa includes concerts in major theatres of the world in Austria, Japan, the US and Germany.

In 1988, a concert was held at the &quot;Pallas&quot; theatre in which Giorgos Dalaras and Dimitra Galani performed, while an album was released the same year under the title &quot;Synaulia&quot;. In 1989 he joined Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis on stage at the Olympic Stadium. He conducted the orchestra for a large part of the concert, with Mikis Theodorakis performing popular songs.

In 1989 he was elected a municipal councillor in the Municipality of Athens and served as deputy mayor for Cultural Affairs. He was also elected as a Member of Parliament in Athens from 1989 to 1990, when he resigned.

In 1991, the album &quot;To kata Markon&quot; was released with lyrics by Nikos Gatsos and performance by Giorgos Dalaras. In 1994 he collaborated again with Nana Mouschouri, composing the music for the album &quot;Agapi einai Zoi&quot;, for which lyrics were written by Nikos Gatsos and Manos Hadjidakis. In that year, he composed the music and took over the theatre direction for the play &quot;Aman - Amen&quot;, which presents the history of the Rebetiko song. He was also awarded as Doctor of Fine Arts at Adelphi University of New York.

In 1995 he took over the artistic direction of the State Orchestra of Hellenic Music (KOEM) which he conducted in many concerts, nationally and internationally. In 1996 he composed the music for the lyrical tragedy LLanto por Ignacio Sanchez Mejias (Funeral Song for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias), based on the same-titled poem of Federico Garcia Lorca, which was directed by Pierre Jourdan and presented at the Imperial Theatre of Compiegne.

In 1996, he also held a concert at the Berlin Opera with the participation of Dimitra Galani and KOEM, while in 1998, in collaboration with the Gennadeion Library of Athens, he presented the performance &quot;Ode Poreias – Ode for Journey&quot;, conducting KOEM at Carnegie Hall of New York. In 1999, he conducted the musical performance &quot;Magikes Nychtes&quot;, which took place at the Herodes Atticus Conservatory. As a tribute to the fifteen years since the death of Vassilis Tsitsanis, 25 top songs were presented, in his own orchestrations.

In 1999, the &quot;Requiem – Night and Light&quot; concert was held, co-produced by Greece, France and Belgium, under the light of the full moon, and under the rock of Meteora, Thessaly. The performance was inspired by the unfinished &quot;Requiem&quot; as composed by Mozart.

In 2000, conducting the State Orchestra of Greek Music, he held a tribute concert at the Herodes Atticus Conservatory, for the 75th anniversary of Mikis Theodorakis birth, in which the composer was present. At the same year he presented the opera &quot;Le visiter&quot;, while the

From 2000 to 2004 he was elected and served as a Greek Member of the European Parliament. During his term of office, he focused his interest on culture and education issues, making speeches and submitting relevant proposals and suggestions, within the framework of his institutional role. From 2000 to 2002 he was a substitute member of the Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sports Committee, while from 2002 to 2004 a regular member of the same Committee. Among other things, he was a regular member of the Development &amp; Cooperation and Reports Committees.

In 2004, he composed the emblematic music, which was heard at the opening ceremony of the 28th Summer Olympic Games in Athens, &quot;To zeibekiko tou Dia&quot;, by which he travelled Greek music all over the world. At the same time, he composed the music for the ancient tragedy &quot;Troades&quot; by Euripides, directed by Diagoras Chronopoulos. The premiere of the film took place in the ancient theatre of Epidaurus and from there it travelled to Turkey, where it was presented for the first time in the ancient theatre of Troy. From 2005 to 2006 he was the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Hellenic Cultural Foundation.

In 2006, he orchestrated the album &quot;Erimia&quot; by Mikis Theodorakis with lyrics by Lefteris Papadopoulos, with performers Maria Farandouri and Manolis Mitsias. In 2008, he conducted the KOEM in a concert with the mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa at the Athens Concert Hall, the proceeds of which were allocated to the charity &quot;I Agapi&quot;. In 2009, he presented his opera &quot;Syrano and Roxani&quot; at the National Opera, in a co-production with the Compiagne Imperial Theatre of France.

With a continuous presence at the Conservatory of Herodes Atticus, which constitutes a place of indescribable value and beauty for the world&#x27;s cultural heritage, he has created and performed unforgettable evenings celebrating music. In 2009, it was the place where his partnership with Agnes Baltsa was repeated with the concert entitled &quot;The songs of my homeland&quot;. In 2011 he presented songs by Hadjidakis, Theodorakis and his own, allocating the proceeds to the charity organization &quot;together for the child&quot;. Also, in 2013, as part of a tribute to Melina Merkouris, he held a concert, in the second part of the show, presenting songs performed by the great Greek actress. In 2014, a retrospective of his musical career took place, through the show &quot;Mana mou Hellas&quot;.

A landmark is the concert held at Carnegie Hall in New York in 2014 entitled &quot;Greece for a Lifetime&quot; in which a nine-member folk orchestra participated, while Stamatis Kokotas and Iro Saia sang. In 2015, he composed
music for the poem by Yiannis Ritsos &quot;I sonata tou Selinofotos&quot; and held a performance at the Herodes Atticus Conservatory, in which the songs were performed by the famous Greek singer Marinella.

As part of his charity action, in 2016, he held a grand concert, with the aim of collecting food, in which he presented top songs of his musical career, in the packed Panathinaikos Stadium (Kallimarmaro). His songs were performed by renowned Greek singers.

He presented three major concerts in Cyprus in 2017, while in 2018, he held an opening concert at the international Oud artistic festival in Jerusalem. In 2019, he held a concert in Safra Square in Jerusalem, which was attended mainly by Israeli citizens, who love Greek music.

In 2018, the President of Israel awarded him at a ceremony which was held at the Ambassador&#x27;s residence in Athens, for his valuable contribution and promotion of the development of Israel&#x27;s and Greece&#x27;s cultural bonds and relations. At the same year, he was awarded as an honorary Doctor of the Department of Digital Media and Communication of Technological Institute of Western Macedonia, while in 2019 he was honoured in the same way by the Department of Music of the Faculty of Philosophy of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

In 2020, he held the concert &quot;5 popular forms in an intensely erotic way&quot;, at the Herodes Atticus Conservatory, in the context of which songs from the works of Hadjidakis, Theodorakis, Tsitsanis, Vamvakaris and his own were presented. In 2021, on the occasion of the celebration of the 200 years since the liberation of Greece, he prepared and presented at the Conservatory a concert entitled &quot;Thelei areti kai tolmi ... to tragoudi&quot;, paraphrasing the words of the Greek poet Andreas Kalvos. In 2022, a tribute concert to Nikos Xylouris was held, while this year two performances will be presented at the Conservatory, as part of the Athens and Epidaurus festival, during which he will enlist the power of songs which &quot;point the way, are allies in the fight for a better life and banish fear&quot;, as he states.

His presence is intense and in a creative way and mood, he approaches Greek music by preparing performances, which are presented throughout the country, at festivals, archaeological monuments, emblematic theatres and places of historical value and importance. Through their conduct, he wishes to promote Greek songs and musical tradition and to contribute to their evolvement.

He has orchestrated many of his own songs, especially when they are going to be presented in concerts and performances, as well as other leading composers’ music in order to approach songs from his own perspective, bring out their identity and scope and breathe new life into them.

Xarchakos, Manos Hatzidakis, and Mikis Theodorakis are considered the trio of leading Greek composers who created and established the &quot;artistic folk&quot; song, enriching its repertoire with popular songs and orchestral works.

==Music==

While he mainly composed in the style of Greek popular music, Laïka, Xarchakos also composed in the classical music genre.

His music has been recorded to 42 albums, has been used in 21 movies and for 15 TV productions. Internationally he is known as the composer for the &quot;Rembetiko&quot; film score, composing the music for the Werner Herzog film &quot;Signs Of Life&quot;, and composing the music for the 1983 BBC TV mini series, &quot;The Dark Side of the Sun&quot;.

<text>Przybysław Dyjamentowski (1694–1774) was a notable Polish documents forger and writer. In his lifetime he prepared several &quot;ancient&quot; chronicles, diplomas and genealogies for sale. 

Dyjamentowski&#x27;s forgeries were not always recognised as such, although they are now regarded as entirely pseudohistorical, and have at times been influential, even in the twenty-first century among a minority of Polish nationalists.

==Prokosz Chronicle==
One of Dyjamentowski&#x27;s best known works is the , also known as the &quot;Slavic-Sarmatian Chronicle&quot;, which gained much popularity as one of the earliest mentions of Poland (dated to 936). The forged chronicle was first published in 1825 by . The chronicle was supposed to stretch back the existence of Poland as an independent nation by a few generations beyond the accepted start of the Piast dynasty and support a connection between mediaeval Poles and ancient Sarmatians and peoples of East India.

<doc id="1074532" wikidata="Q8074296" url="?curid=1074532" title="Zora Cross">
<text>Zora Bernice May Cross (18 May 1890 – 22 January 1964) was an Australian poet, best-selling novelist and journalist.

==Life==
Cross was born on 18 May 1890 at Eagle Farm, Brisbane, to Sydney-born accountant Ernest William Cross and Mary Louisa Eliza Ann Cross. Cross published and was known for her serialised novels, books of poems and children&#x27;s verse and inherited her love for literature from both her parents. She was educated at Ipswich Girls&#x27; Grammar School, Burwood Public School, Sydney Girls&#x27; High School and then Sydney Teachers&#x27; College from 1909 to 1910. As a child Cross was a prolific contributor to the Children&#x27;s Corner in the &quot;Australian Town and Country Journal&quot;, where she attracted the attention of the editor Ethel Turner, who became a significant friend and mentor throughout Cross&#x27;s writing career.

Cross combined her teaching career with writing and acting, including tours with Cherry Abraham&#x27;s Comedy Costume Company in Queensland and with J. C. Williamson&#x27;s theatre company. On 11 March 1911, she married fellow actor Stuart Smith but later refused to live with him. The marriage was dissolved on 10 September 1922. In September 1914 she gave birth to a son, Normand (later known as Teddy), at Lauriston Private Hospital, Mosman, but no father was listed on the birth certificate. She taught for three years and then worked as a journalist for &quot;The Boomerang&quot;, and subsequently as a freelance writer.

By this time Cross had formed a lasting relationship with the writer David McKee Wright, whom she married in 1923. They lived in the Blue Mountains village of Glenbrook where they had two daughters, Davidina and Maeve (known as April).

Cross Street in the Canberra suburb of Cook is named in her honour.

== Work ==
In 1916 Cross submitted her first novel, on an Aboriginal theme but the publisher refused to publish this work. That same year a book of poems, &quot;A Song of Mother Love,&quot; was published.

In 1917 Cross published &quot;Songs of Love and Life&quot;, some of which had already appeared in &quot;The Bulletin&quot;, which was highly influential in Australian culture and politics until after the First World War, and was then noted for its nationalist, pro-labour, and pro-republican writing. This book and her book of similar poems, &quot;The Lilt of Life&quot; in 1918, both published by Angus &amp; Robertson, were an expression of her love for David McKee Wright. &quot;Songs of Love and Life&quot; attracted widespread attention because of its erotic content and sold out in three days.

In 1918 Cross wrote the children&#x27;s verse &quot;The City of Riddle-mee-ree&quot; (1918), illustrated by Olive Crane, and then the more sombre &quot;Elegy on an Australian Schoolboy&quot; (1921), in memory of her 19-year-old soldier brother, John Skyring Cross.

Her 1924 book &quot;Daughters of the Seven Mile&quot; illustrated her awareness of developing social and economic stresses in Australia.

Cross wrote on subjects controversial at the time such as sex, childbirth, Aboriginal communities and the effects of war on women who are left behind.

As &quot;Bernice May&quot;, &quot;Rosa Carmen&quot; and &quot;Daisy M.&quot;, Cross contributed regularly in the 1930s to the &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Mirror&quot;. As Bernice May she wrote a significant series of interviews with contemporary Australian women writers.

In later years she drew on a lifetime interest in Ancient Rome and Julius Caesar. Her novel &quot;The Victor&quot; was serialised in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in 1933 and received favourable reviews.

Throughout her life Zora supported herself and her children by acting, teaching and as a freelance journalist. The Commonwealth Literary Fund, (precursor to the Australia Council for the Arts) prompted by the Fellowship of Australian Writers, awarded her a pension.

<text>Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky (Самуил Соломонович Котелянский) (February 28, 1880 – January 21, 1955) was a Ukrainian translator of Russian literature into English. He made the transition from his origins in a small Jewish &quot;shtetl&quot; to distinction in the rarefied world of English letters. Although he was not a creative writer himself, he befriended, corresponded with, helped publish, and otherwise served as intermediary between some of the most prominent people in English literary life in the early twentieth century.

==Biography==
Koteliansky was born in the small Jewish &quot;shtetl&quot; (town) of Ostropol in the Volhynian Governorate of the Russian Empire (today in Khmelnytskyi Oblast, western Ukraine), where his first language almost certainly was Yiddish. The name Koteliansky, according to his biographer Galya Diment, most likely comes from a small town near Ostropol called Kotelianka. He was educated and attended university in Russia.

By 1911, financed by his mother, Beila, he had moved to London, where he became a great friend of D.H. Lawrence, and Leonard and Virginia Woolf. He also adored the short-story writer Katherine Mansfield. Although his romantic affection for her was not reciprocated, the two maintained a close relationship in person and in letters until her early death in 1923. His friendship with her was also documented in a painting by Beatrice Elvery, Lady Glenavy.

He was business manager of &quot;The Adelphi&quot;, a prominent literary journal that published works of Lawrence, Mansfield, the young Dylan Thomas, and many other leading lights of early- and mid-twentieth-century English letters after its founding in 1923. But Koteliansky eventually broke with the journal&#x27;s founder (and Katherine Mansfield&#x27;s husband) John Middleton Murry. He was an early translator into English (often with the collaboration of Leonard or Virginia Woolf) of works of Russian authors, such as Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Rozanov, and he helped those authors achieve prominence in the English-speaking world.

Koteliansky (&#x27;Kot&#x27;) was a close friend of the artist Mark Gertler, and they corresponded extensively from 1914 until Gertler&#x27;s death in 1939.

<text>Nebulium was a proposed element found in astronomical observation of a nebula by William Huggins in 1864. The strong green emission lines of the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula, discovered using spectroscopy, led to the postulation that an as yet unknown element was responsible for this emission. In 1927, Ira Sprague Bowen showed that the lines are emitted by doubly ionized oxygen (new style O; old style O), and no new element was necessary to explain them.

==History==

William Hyde Wollaston in 1802 and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1814 described the dark lines within the solar spectrum. Later, Gustav Kirchhoff explained the lines by atomic absorption or emission, which allowed the lines to be used for the identification of chemical elements.

In the early days of telescopic astronomy, the word nebula was used to describe any fuzzy patch of light that did not look like a star. Many of these, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra that looked like stellar spectra, and these turned out to be galaxies. Others, such as the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula, had very different spectra. When William Huggins looked at the Cat&#x27;s Eye, he found no continuous spectrum like that seen in the Sun, but just a few strong emission lines. The two green lines at 495.9 nm and 500.7 nm were the strongest. These lines did not correspond to any known elements on Earth. The fact that helium had been identified by the emission lines in the Sun in 1868, and had then also been found on Earth in 1895, encouraged astronomers to suggest that the lines were due to a new element. The name &quot;nebulium&quot; (occasionally &quot;nebulum&quot; or &quot;nephelium&quot;) was first mentioned by Margaret Lindsay Huggins in a short communication in 1898, although it is stated that her husband occasionally used the term before. 

In 1911, John William Nicholson theorized that all known elements consisted of four protoelements, one of which was Nebulium.
The development of the periodic table by Dimitri Mendeleev and the determination of the atomic numbers by Henry Moseley in 1913 left nearly no room for a new element. In 1914 French astronomers were able to determine the atomic weight of nebulium. A measured value of 2.74 for the lines near 372 nm and a slightly lower value for the 500.7 nm line seemed to indicate that two elements were responsible for the spectrum.

Ira Sprague Bowen was working on UV spectroscopy and on the calculation of spectra of the light elements of the periodic table when he became aware of the green lines discovered by Huggins. With this knowledge he was able to suggest that the green lines might be forbidden transitions. They were shown as due to doubly ionized oxygen at extremely low density, rather than the hypothetical nebulium. As Henry Norris Russell put it, &quot;Nebulium has vanished into thin air.&quot; Nebulae are typically extremely rarefied, much less dense than the hardest vacuums produced on Earth. In these conditions, lines can form which are suppressed at normal densities. These lines are known as forbidden lines, and are the strongest lines in most nebular spectra.

<text>Coronium was the name of a suggested chemical element, hypothesised in the 19th century. The name, inspired by the solar corona, was given by Gruenwald in 1887. A new atomic thin green line in the solar corona was then considered to be emitted by a new element unlike anything else seen under laboratory conditions. It was later determined to be emitted by iron (Fe13+), so highly ionized that it was at that time impossible to produce in a laboratory.

== Solar spectroscopy ==
During the total solar eclipse of 7 August 1869, a green emission line of wavelength 530.3 nm was independently observed by Charles Augustus Young (1834–1908) and William Harkness (1837–1903) in the coronal spectrum. Since this line did not correspond to that of any known material, it was proposed that it was due to an unknown element, provisionally named &quot;coronium&quot;.

The supposed element was discovered also in the gases given off by Mount Vesuvius in 1898 by a team of Italian chemists led by . 

In 1902, over thirty years after his famous predictions of new elements based on his periodic table, and shortly after the discovery of various noble gases, the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev hypothesized that there existed two noble gases of atomic weight less than hydrogen. The first, which he called &quot;element x&quot; or &quot;newtonium&quot;, was his attempt at a chemical explanation of the luminiferous aether. He argued that it had an atomic weight of 0.14. The second, which he called &quot;element y&quot; or coronium, was his attempt to explain the green emission lines from the Sun. He argued that it had an atomic weight of 0.4.

It was not until the 1930s that Walter Grotrian and Bengt Edlén discovered that the spectral line at 530.3 nm was due to highly ionized iron (Fe13+); other unusual lines in the coronal spectrum were also caused by highly charged ions, such as nickel, the high ionization being due to the extreme temperature of the solar corona. The line at 530.3 nm had previously been misclassified as iron line number 1474.

<doc id="1074544" wikidata="Q5500410" url="?curid=1074544" title="Freedmen's Aid Society">
<text>The Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Society was founded in 1859 during the American Civil War by the American Missionary Association (AMA), a group supported chiefly by the Congregational, Presbyterian and Methodist churches in the North. It organized a supply of teachers from the North and provided housing for them, to set up and teach in schools in the South for freedmen and their children. The AMA founded a total of more than 500 schools and colleges for freedmen in the South after the war, so that freedmen could be educated as teachers, nurses and other professionals.

The work of the Society accelerated with the end of the war and the beginning of the Reconstruction era. Education for freedmen was seen as a top priority among both blacks and whites. The Society was supported by a variety of religious groups and denominations, and it began work in the South three months after organizing. By the end of the first year, it had recruited 52 instructors. The teachers instructed more than 5,000 students in 59 schools. The schools were open to men, women, and children in the South. By the turn of the century, blacks had raised their rate of literacy by an amazing amount; it was a major success story since the end of the war. By then the Democratic-dominated state legislatures had imposed racial segregation and were underfunding black schools and other facilities.

Leadership and control of the Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Society has been attributed to both the Congregational and the Methodist Episcopal churches. The Methodist version of the Society&#x27;s history states that it was founded in 1866. It was &quot;directed by a Board of Managers who were elected by the (Methodist) General Conference.&quot; In 1920 it was reorganized and renamed the Board of Education for Negroes, and in 1939 absorbed into the Board of Education of the Methodist Church.

<text>B. H. Carroll Theological Institute is an accredited Christian Baptist institution in Irving, Texas with multiple sources of funding and a self-perpetuating board of governors. It is named after Benajah Harvey Carroll and teaches Baptist principles and practices. It operates in cooperation primarily with Baptist churches, and also cooperates with other Great Commission Christians. The institution offers classes in both conventional classroom settings and by innovative means. It trains students in &quot;“teaching churches” located in multiple Texas cities, as well as through interactive lessons taught over the Internet&quot;, with 20 such &quot;teaching churches&quot; in operation throughout Texas as of November 2006. The school plans to focus on the use of distance education to make it easier for students to obtain theological education. As of 2006, the school&#x27;s second year of operation, B. H. Carroll Theological Institute had 300 students taking courses and an additional 300 students auditing courses. Bruce Corley was Carroll&#x27;s first president; Gene Wilkes is Carroll&#x27;s second president.

In January 2007, the institute was certified to grant degrees by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and was later exempted from such certification through a ruling of the Texas State Supreme Court. In late February 2012, B. H. Carroll Theological Institute received accreditation status from the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE). Carroll is listed among Institutions and Programs accredited by recognized U.S. Accrediting Organizations by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation(CHEA). In 2017, Carroll received accreditation as a member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS).

==History==

The institute&#x27;s founding chancellor is Russell H. Dilday, a former president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary of the Southern Baptist Convention. Dilday was fired from Southwestern in March 1994 by what had become majority conservative-leaning board of trustees during the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence.

Dilday wrote of a &#x27;lively renaissance of Baptist theological education at the edge of a new millennium&#x27; prior to the launch of the institute. At the 2006 installation of the institute&#x27;s president and first administrators, Dilday indicated that &#x27;the time is right for such a school as the Carroll Institute.&#x27;

The four inaugural faculty members at Carroll all formerly taught at Southwestern. including Corley, who was a professor of New Testament and Greek and the Dean of the School of Theology there. Corley was awarded both a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Doctor of Theology (Th. D.) from Southwestern. The institute&#x27;s representatives express no competition existing between the residential-model of education exemplified by Southwestern and their own non-residential model. In a guest post for the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion Southwest Region NABPR-SW blog, Corley suggests schools like the Institute can help &#x27;bridge the gap between where the seminaries are and what their publics need.&#x27;

Corley stepped down as president in October, 2013; Dr. Gene Wilkes of Legacy Church of Plano, Texas, was elected as Carroll&#x27;s 2nd President in October 2013 and was inaugurated in February 2014.
With both Baylor and Southwestern&#x27;s historic links to the man, some contention developed over the adoption of the name of B.H. Carroll by the institute, as Carroll was the founding president of Southwestern Seminary. Writing long before the controversy, Leon McBeth testifies to the importance of Benajah Harvey Carroll&#x27;s legacy to Baylor University and Southern Seminary as well as to modern Baptist history, describing the man as &#x27;the John Wayne of Texas Baptists.&#x27;

After headquartering in Arlington, Texas for several years, the Institute moved to its &quot;first permanent location&quot; in Irving beginning in May 2015.

==Academics and Accreditation==
According to the Carroll Institute&#x27;s website, &quot;the institute is a graduate-level community of faith and learning dedicated to equipping men and women called to serve Christ in the diverse and global ministries of His church&quot;. Carroll applied for accreditation with the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) and was accredited by ATS in 2017. Previously, Carroll applied for accreditation with the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE)in 2010, and was accredited by the Association in 2012. Prior to this step, the institute was granted a Certificate of Authority to offer master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees by state of Texas&#x27;Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) in 2007. With its THECB certification, the school began offering programs leading to a Master of Divinity degree with major in Christian Ministry, Master of Music degree with major in Christian Ministry or a Master of Arts degree with majors in Theology, Education, and Music. When THECB ceased regulating degree-granting religious institutions in 2008, Carroll was granted exemption from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

==Library==
The institute&#x27;s library received a donation of nearly 5,000 volumes from Eddie Belle Newport, widow of John Newport, longtime academic vice president at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. An additional 500 volumes were donated by Lois Hendricks, widow of longtime theology professor William Hendricks. In addition to its print materials, the Carroll webpage discusses a &#x27;NexLearn Online Library&#x27; consisting of electronic resources available to students via their online classroom environment.

<text>Albizu University is a private university with its main campus in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a branch campus in Miami, Florida, and an additional instructional location in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. It focuses on psychology, health, education, and human services.

==History==
The university&#x27;s history began in 1966, when a Puerto Rican psychologist and educator, Carlos Albizu Miranda, founded the Instituto Psicológico de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology) in response to the need for culturally sensitive professional training in the area of clinical psychology. At the time, there were no graduate programs in clinical psychology in Puerto Rico. The University of Puerto Rico and the Normal School (later known as the College of Education) included psychology as part of the core curricula as early as 1903—but only for undergraduate studies that were heavily based on the American higher education system and its standards. Graduate-level degrees in psychology could only be obtained through schools in the United States.

By the early 1960s, little had changed, with mental health professionals being trained abroad and then returning to their home country with the challenge of adapting what they had learned in the United States to fit the socio-cultural realities of a Hispanic community. Albizu-Miranda himself received his training at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, and incurred the same difficulties of incorporating what he had learned into the culture of the island upon returning home to Puerto Rico.

What had changed, though, was the social climate of the island. Between 1947 and the late 1960s, Puerto Rico saw major industrialization that transformed the island from a rural agrarian to an urban industrial society. With this, came the establishment of social classes, modern capitalism, and economic consumption—along with confusion and insecurity that led to issues such as violence and drug use. By the 1960s, the population had grown to nearly three million people, with only five clinical psychologists on the island to support the growing need for social services. In an effort to meet the public&#x27;s demands, the government established what were known as “assistant psychologists.” These assistant psychologists for the most part had had little training and were not equipped to serve what was becoming an increasingly complex population. By 1964, Albizu-Miranda had begun envisioning a Puerto Rican-based graduate program that would address the need for multicultural professional training in psychology on the island, along with the need for greater numbers of clinically trained psychologists to serve the growing population.

Between 1964 and 1966, Albizu-Miranda held multiple meetings with the chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico to discuss the development of a graduate program in psychology. After two years of fruitless efforts, Albizu-Miranda decided to turn away from the state university and establish a self-governing and independent institution. On August 1, 1966, he incorporated the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology and welcomed the institute&#x27;s inaugural academic year in 1967–1968.

Recognizing a parallel need for multicultural training in clinical psychology in Southern Florida, which has a large Hispanic population, Albizu-Miranda opened the Miami Institute of Psychology in Miami, Florida, in 1980. In January 2000, the two main campuses were merged under the shared name Carlos Albizu University in honor of their founder.

==Campuses==
Albizu University has its main campus in San Juan, Puerto Rico; a branch campus in Miami, Florida; and an extension of the San Juan Campus in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.

Each campus includes a clinic that offers mental health and speech and language services to the surrounding community while providing a practical training site for students.

=== San Juan Campus ===

Located in the heart of Puerto Rico&#x27;s capital city, the San Juan Campus set a precedent as the first independent professional school of psychology in North America. Originally called the Puerto Rico Institute of Psychology, Albizu-Miranda modeled the university after institutes of psychology in Europe where practice and internship coexisted. Now, over 50 years since its founding, the San Juan Campus has over 1,600 students and has expanded to include an on-campus training clinic.

==== Student body ====
At the San Juan Campus, enrolled students for Fall 2019 included 483 undergraduates and 1,145 in graduate programs and postgraduate certificate programs. 93% of the students are from Puerto Rico and 7% are from other parts of the United States and its territories.

==== Albizu Clinic ====
The Albizu Clinic, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the university, provides mental health services to children, adolescents, and adults in San Juan and surrounding communities. The clinic also serves as a practicum and internship site for Albizu University graduate students. The Albizu Clinic Internship Training Program in Clinical Psychology is exclusively offered to Albizu students in the Psy.D. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology programs.

The Albizu Clinic also provides speech and language services for children and adults in the areas of autism, dysphagia, motor-speech disorders, neurological impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, and developmental disorders. Graduate students from the university&#x27;s M.S. in Speech and Language Pathology program work closely with licensed and certified pathologists.

===Miami Campus===

Located in the Miami, Florida, metropolitan area, the Miami Campus offers an array of undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs in the fields of psychology, education, speech and language, English for speakers of other languages (ESOL), criminal justice, and human services.

==== Goodman Psychological Services Center ====
Founded in 1980, the Goodman Psychological Services Center is a private, nonprofit mental health center, sponsored by Albizu University, that provides services to children, adolescents, and adults in South Florida. The Goodman Center also functions as a practicum site for Albizu psychology and speech/language programs and for a doctorate in clinical psychology internship program accredited by the American Psychological Association.

Since its inception, the Goodman Center has provided care to nearly 15,000 people from communities that are typically underserved due to factors such as financial hardship, limited or no insurance coverage, and lack of proficiency in the English language. In addition, the Goodman Center is contracted by the Miami-Dade County Public Schools to conduct psychoeducational evaluations and receives referrals from community agencies and other sources. Services are provided in both English and Spanish.

=== Mayagüez University Center ===

In January 2015, Albizu opened an extension location in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. Under the jurisdiction of the San Juan Campus, the location was created to provide academic offerings and clinical services to the western region of Puerto Rico. Known as the Mayagüez University Center, the facility offers undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs in psychology and speech and language pathology. With an on-site clinic, the center also offers students clinical practice while providing health services to the community.

The Mayagüez University Center is located in the city of Mayagüez.

==== Student body ====
At the Mayagüez University Center, enrolled students for Fall 2019 included 80 undergraduates and 359 in graduate programs and postgraduate certificate programs. 95% of the students are from Puerto Rico, and 5% are from other parts of the United States and its territories.

==== Albizu Clinic ====
The Albizu Clinic at the Mayagüez University Center provides mental health and speech and language services to children, adolescents, and adults in the surrounding community. The clinic also serves as a practicum and internship site for Albizu graduate students.

<text>Thomas Louis Berger (July 20, 1924 – July 13, 2014) was an American novelist. Probably best known for his picaresque novel &quot;Little Big Man&quot; and the subsequent film by Arthur Penn, Berger explored and manipulated many genres of fiction throughout his career, including the crime novel, the hard-boiled detective story, science fiction, the utopian novel, plus re-workings of classical mythology, Arthurian legend, and the survival adventure.

Berger&#x27;s biting wit led many reviewers to refer to him as a satirist or &quot;comic&quot; novelist, descriptions he preferred to reject. His admirers often bemoaned that his talent and achievement were underappreciated, in view of his versatility across many forms of fiction, his precise use of language, and his probing intelligence.

==Biography==
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Thomas Berger grew up in the nearby community of Lockland. He interrupted his college career to enlist in the United States Army in 1943. Berger served in Europe during World War II and was stationed with a medical unit in the first U.S. Occupation Forces in Berlin, experiences which later provided him with background for his first novel, &quot;Crazy in Berlin&quot;, published in 1958. On his return, he studied at the University of Cincinnati, receiving a B.A. in 1948. He then pursued graduate work in English at Columbia University, leaving his thesis unfinished to enroll in the writer&#x27;s workshop at the New School for Social Research. Here Berger met and married an artist, Jeanne Redpath, in 1950. He supported himself during this time by working as a librarian at the Rand School of Social Science, and was briefly on staff at the &quot;New York Times Index&quot;. Berger later became a copy editor at &quot;Popular Science Monthly&quot;, and performed freelance editing during the early years of his writing career.

Eventually, Berger was able to devote himself to writing full-time, particularly after the notoriety gained by his third book, &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, in 1964. Although he would occasionally put his hand to a short story, play, or non-fiction article (including a stint as film critic for &quot;Esquire&quot;), Berger preferred the long narrative form of the novel, and produced a steady run of critically acclaimed books throughout his career. In 1984 his book &quot;The Feud&quot; was nominated by the Pulitzer committee for fiction for the Pulitzer Prize, but the Pulitzer board overrode their recommendation and instead chose William Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Ironweed&quot;.

In 1974, Berger was a writer in residence at the University of Kansas, and a distinguished visiting professor at Southampton College in 1975–1976. He lectured at Yale University in 1981 and 1982, and was a Regents&#x27; Lecturer at the University of California, Davis, in 1982. A collection of his papers is available at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.

Berger resided in New York City from 1948 to 1953, and lived the next twelve years in a town on the Hudson River. In subsequent years, he lived in London, Malibu, California, New York City again, Long Island, and then Mount Desert Island in Maine, before once more returning to the banks of the Hudson. He died on July 13, 2014, seven days before his 90th birthday.

==Awards and honors==
Berger received a Dial fellowship in 1962. In 1965, he received a Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Award, National Institute of Arts and Letters, and a Western Heritage Award, both for &quot;Little Big Man&quot;. &quot;Reinhart&#x27;s Women&quot; won Berger an Ohioana Book Award, and he was a 1984 Pulitzer Prize finalist for &quot;The Feud&quot;. Long Island University awarded Berger a Litt. D. in 1986.

==Adaptations==
Berger may be best known for &quot;Little Big Man&quot;, the movie made from his 1964 novel. Released in 1970, it was directed by Arthur Penn, and starred Dustin Hoffman and Faye Dunaway. &quot;Neighbors&quot;, with John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd and Cathy Moriarty, was released in 1981. Bill D&#x27;Elia produced and directed a film adaptation of &quot;The Feud&quot; in 1989. A film version of the 1992 novel &quot;Meeting Evil&quot;, starring Samuel L. Jackson and Luke Wilson, was filmed in 2011, and was released to theaters in the United States in May 2012.

His play &quot;Other People&quot; was produced at the Berkshire Theatre Festival in 1970. Berger&#x27;s radio play &quot;At the Dentist&#x27;s&quot; was broadcast by Vermont Public Radio in 1981.

<text>Robert Indiana (born Robert Clark; September 13, 1928 – May 19, 2018) was an American artist associated with the pop art movement.

Indiana is mostly known for his iconic image LOVE which was first created in 1964 in the form of a card. Indiana sent these cards to several friends and acquaintances in the art world. In 1965, Robert Indiana was invited to propose an artwork to be featured on the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s annual Christmas card. Indiana submitted several 12” square oil on canvas variations based on his LOVE image. The museum selected the most intense color combination in red, blue, and green. It became one of the most popular cards the museum has ever offered. Indiana continued to develop his LOVE series, and in 1966, worked with Marian Goodman of Multiples, Inc. to make his first LOVE sculpture in aluminum. In 1970, Indiana completed his first monumental LOVE sculpture in Cor-Ten steel which is in the collection of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

Indiana has also been a focal point of the LGBTQ rights movement after it was disclosed that his famous LOVE artwork was the result of the breakup between him and artist Ellsworth Kelly, who notably, inspired Indiana&#x27;s style of work. 

In addition to being a painter and sculptor, Indiana made posters and prints and also designed stage sets and costumes for the Virgil Thompson and Gertrude Stein opera &quot;The Mother of Us All.&quot; Indiana&#x27;s artwork has been featured in numerous exhibitions around the world and is included in the permanent collections of many major museums including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

==Biography==
Robert Indiana was born Robert Clark in New Castle, Indiana, and was adopted as an infant by Earl Clark and Carmen Watters. After his parents divorced, he relocated to Indianapolis to live with his father so he could attend Arsenal Technical High School (1942–1946), from which he graduated as valedictorian of his class.

After serving for three years in the United States Army Air Forces, Indiana studied at the Art Institute of Chicago (1949–1953), the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine (summer 1953) and Edinburgh University and Edinburgh College of Art (1953–1954). He returned to the United States in 1954 and settled in New York City.

In New York, Indiana&#x27;s romantic partner Ellsworth Kelly, whom he met in 1956, helped him find a loft on Coenties Slip. On Coenties Slip Kelly introduced Indiana to neighboring artists like Jack Youngerman, Agnes Martin and Cy Twombly, with whom he shared his studio for a time. It was around this time when Indiana and Kelly established their romantic relationship. Kelly would go on to become a mentor for Indiana, and later convince him to make the shift to the hard edge style that quickly became a fan favorite. 

An interview with Indiana later in life reveals that Indiana only saw himself as equal with Kelly. Although Indiana claims to be inspired by his homefront, The Slip, and Life Magazine, his biggest inspiration of all was Kelly. 

In 1958 he changed his surname to Indiana. His career took off in the early 1960s after Alfred H. Barr Jr., bought &quot;The American Dream, I&quot; for the Museum of Modern Art.

In 1964, Indiana moved from Coenties Slip to a five-story building at Spring Street and the Bowery. In the summer of 1969, he visited &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer Elliot Elisofon on the Island of Vinalhaven and began renting the upstairs of the 100 year old Victorian-style Odd Fellows Hall named &quot;The Star of Hope&quot; in the island town of Vinalhaven, Maine. Indiana was drawn to the Odd Fellows insignia which consists of three interlocking links. &quot;The three links of course are truth and friendship, and the important link in the middle just happens to be love.  So I think I was fated to end my life in an Odd Fellows Lodge — Robert Indiana&quot;Half a century earlier, Marsden Hartley had made his escape to the same island. Indiana discovered a great affinity to Marsden Hartley to whom he pays homage in a series of work in the late 1980s. When Elisofon died in 1973, Indiana bought the lodge for $10,000 from his estate. He moved in full-time when he lost his lease on the Bowery in 1978.

During this same year, Indiana created his most famous piece of art, LOVE, which was created in response to his breakup with Kelly, although this was not disclosed until several years later. This specific piece incorporated three colours, red, green, and blue, the most prominent colours in Kelly&#x27;s work. However, this piece brought Indiana a lot of unwanted attention. Eventually, Indiana started to fade out of the public spotlight. It is speculated that the attention from LOVE became too much. 

Indiana grew reclusive in his final years. He died on May 19, 2018, at his home in Vinalhaven, Maine, of respiratory failure at the age of 89. One day before his death, a lawsuit was filed over claims that his caretaker had isolated him from family and friends, and was marketing unauthorized reproductions of his works.

==Work==
Indiana&#x27;s complex and multilayered work explores the power of language, American identity, and personal history, and often consists of striking, simple and direct words. Drawing on the vocabulary of vernacular highway signs and roadside entertainments, Indiana created a body of work that appears bold and energetic. His best known examples include short words like EAT, DIE, HUG, ERR, and LOVE.

In his EAT series, the word blares in paint or light bulbs against a neutral background. In a major career milestone, the architect Philip Johnson commissioned an &quot;EAT&quot; sign for the New York State Pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The sign was turned off one day after the opening of the fair because visitors believed it to mark a restaurant. Andy Warhol&#x27;s contribution to the fair was also removed that day.

Indiana&#x27;s series of monumental sculptures can be seen across the globe, including &quot;LOVE, Imperial LOVE, LOVE Wall, AHAVA, AMOR, and ONE Through ZERO (The Ten Numbers).&quot;  Indiana&#x27;s own hard-edged painterly aesthetic paved the way for the later sculptural editions which would translate this into three dimensions. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, Indiana created his series of Peace Paintings which were exhibited at the Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York in 2004.

Between 1989 and 1994, Indiana painted a series of 18 canvases inspired by the shapes and numbers in the &quot;War Motif&quot; paintings that Marsden Hartley did in Berlin between 1913 and 1915.

Indiana was also a theatrical set and costume designer; he designed Santa Fe Opera&#x27;s 1976 production of Virgil Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Mother of Us All&quot;, based on the life of suffragist Susan B. Anthony. He was the star of Andy Warhol&#x27;s film &quot;Eat&quot; (1964), which is a 45-minute film of Indiana eating a mushroom. Warhol also made the brief silent film &quot;Bob Indiana Etc.&quot; (4 minutes, 1963), a portrait of the artist with appearances by Wynn Chamberlain and John Giorno.

Indiana&#x27;s series of monumental sculptures of the digits zero through to nine, &quot;ONE Through ZERO (The Ten Numbers)&quot; has been displayed in several cities since its 1980 creation.

===LOVE===
Although most famously known for his hard edge artworks, Indiana&#x27;s work originally focused less on hard edge until he was introduced to Ellsworth Kelly in 1956. Kelly quickly convinced Indiana to move into 25 Coenties Slip, better known as The Slip, where several other artists would later follow including Kelly himself. Other artists like Agnes Martin, Lenore Tawney, Ann Wilson, and Jack Youngerman soon followed. Living at the slip largely influenced Indiana&#x27;s art, although it would be Ellsworth Kelly who suggested later on to Indiana to make the large shift into hard edge. 

Although known for several art pieces, Indiana&#x27;s best known image is the word love in upper-case letters, arranged in a square with its trademarked tilted letter &quot;O&quot;. The iconography first appeared in a series of poems originally written in 1958, in which Indiana stacked LO and VE on top of one another. The first paintings addressing the subject of love were &quot;4-Star Love&quot; (1961) and &quot;Love Is God&quot; (1964).

What many are unaware of is that Indiana&#x27;s famous LOVE had evolved from a romantic relationship with his inspiration, Kelly. According to art historian Susan Elizabeth Ryan wrote that in 1964 LOVE had been a &quot;more explicit four-letter word — beginning with F, and with a second letter, a U, intriguingly tilted to the right.&quot; Indiana and Kelly had been in a rocky relationship and Indiana had been working on word paintings. She adds &quot;The two men were in the habit of exchanging postcard-size sketches, with Mr. Kelly laying down fields of color and Mr. Indiana adding large words atop the abstractions.&quot; The 1950&#x27;s were a critical time for Indiana and his art. Not only did he change his name to avoid confusion with other artists, but Indiana also fell in love with Kelly. This whirlwind romance resulted in Indiana moving into The Slip, as mentioned previously. Not only that, but Indiana&#x27;s style drastically changed. Indiana claimed that Kelly introduced him to hard edge saying, &quot;This was my first head-on contact with painting of any geometric, or clean hard-edge style.&quot; However, after the two artists broke up in 1964 the cruder original artwork was changed by Indiana to the famous stacked LOVE.

Indiana&#x27;s red, blue, and green &quot;LOVE&quot; painting was then selected to appear on the Museum of Modern Art’s annual Christmas card in 1965. In an interview Robert Indiana said &quot;It was the most profitable Christmas card the museum ever published.&quot;

Indiana said he was inspired to use these colors because his father used to work at a Phillips 66 gas station whose colors were green and red. Robert Indiana described the original colors as &quot;the red and green of that sign against the blue Hoosier sky&quot;. Still it is believed the colors were inspired also by the painting &quot;Red Blue Green&quot; (1963) of Ellsworth Kelly, his former partner.

The colours that dominate Indiana&#x27;s love painting (red, blue, and green) are also the most prominent colours featured in Kelly&#x27;s work. In this case, Indiana&#x27;s work became more than just an art piece, but rather an ode to his former lover as well. As said by journalist Jonathon Jones, [LOVE] &quot;is a sad love poem, perhaps even an angry one. Yet it instantly became a beacon of idealism, optimism, youth and revolt,&quot; although information regarding Indiana and Kelly&#x27;s relationship was not publicly announced until 2013. 

Indiana said, &quot;Ellsworth Kelly introduced me to Hard-Edge and was a great influence on my work, and is responsible for my being here&quot;.

The first serigraph/silk screen of LOVE was printed as part of an exhibition poster for Stable Gallery in 1966 on the occasion of Indiana&#x27;s show dedicated to his LOVE series .

In 1973, the United States Postal Service commissioned a stamp design by Indiana and released the eight-cent LOVE stamp in advance of Valentine&#x27;s Day. Unveiled in a ceremony at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the stamp became so popular that 425 million were printed over the next two years.

====Hebrew version====
In 1977, he created a Hebrew LOVE with the four-letter word Ahava (אהבה &quot;love&quot; in Hebrew) using Cor-Ten steel, for the Israel Museum Art Garden in Jerusalem.

====Variation for Google====
For Valentine&#x27;s Day 2011, Google paid homage to Indiana&#x27;s LOVE, which was displayed in place of the search engine site&#x27;s normal logo.

==Exhibitions==
In 1962, Eleanor Ward&#x27;s Stable Gallery hosted Robert Indiana&#x27;s first New York solo exhibition. Indiana&#x27;s work has been represented by Paul Kasmin Gallery in New York City, Waddington Custot in London and Galerie Gmurzynska in Europe.

From July 4 – September 14, 2008, Indiana&#x27;s work was the subject of the grand multiple-location exhibition &quot;Robert Indiana a Milano&quot;; the main exhibition took place at the Padiglione d’Arte Contemporanea (Pavilion of Contemporary Art), and other works were displayed in public piazzas in Milan.

In 2013, the Whitney Museum of American Art mounted a retrospective of his work entitled &quot;Robert Indiana: Beyond LOVE&quot;, this exhibition traveled to the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio, Texas.

The first retrospective of Indiana&#x27;s sculptures in the United Kingdom, spanning 60 years of the artist&#x27;s career, opened at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park on March 12, 2022, and ran until January 2023.  

==Appearances of his work in popular culture==
Millions of television viewers saw an orange, brown, and white version of &quot;Five&quot;, one of Indiana&#x27;s 1965 Numbers series, featured in an episode of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; during the 1971–1972 season, in which Rhoda Morgenstern redecorates Lou Grant&#x27;s dated living room. Lou, evidently not a fan of pop art, complains to Mary, &quot;I bet she went through four other paintings before choosing this one!&quot;

In 2014, ESPN released &quot;MECCA: The Floor That Made Milwaukee Famous&quot;, a short film in its &quot;30 for 30&quot; series of sports documentaries. It chronicles how Indiana&#x27;s floor at the MECCA was saved from being sold for scrap.

==Collections==

<doc id="1074597" wikidata="Q2543966" url="?curid=1074597" title="Raised fist">
<text>The raised fist, or the clenched fist, is a long-standing image of mixed meaning, often a symbol of solidarity, especially with a political movement. It is a common symbol representing a wide range of political ideologies, most notably socialism, communism, anarchism, and trade unionism, and can also be used as a salute expressing unity, strength, or resistance.

==History==
The origin of the raised fist as either a symbol or gesture is unclear. Its use in trade unionism, anarchism, and the labor movement had begun by the 1910s. William &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood, a founding member of the Industrial Workers of the World, used the metaphor of a fist as something greater than the sum of its parts during a speech at the 1913 Paterson silk strike. Journalist and socialist activist John Reed described hearing a similar description from a participant in the strike. A large raised fist rising from a crowd of striking workers was used to promote a mass strike in Budapest in 1912. In the United States, clenched fist was described by the magazine Mother Earth as &quot;symbolical of the social revolution&quot; in 1914.

The use of the fist as a salute by communists and antifascists is first evidenced in 1924, when it was adopted for the Communist Party of Germany&#x27;s Roter Frontkämpferbund (&quot;Alliance of Red Front-Fighters&quot;). In reaction, the Nazi Party adopted the well-known Roman salute two years later. The gesture of the raised fist was apparently known in the United States as well, and is seen in a photograph from a May Day march in New York City in 1936. It is perhaps best known in this era from its use during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939, as a greeting by the Republican faction, and known as the &quot;Popular Front salute&quot; or the &quot;anti-fascist salute&quot;.

The graphic symbol was popularised in 1948 by Taller de Gráfica Popular, a print shop in Mexico that used art to advance revolutionary social causes. Its use spread through the United States in the 1960s after artist and activist Frank Cieciorka produced a simplified version for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee: this version was subsequently used by Students for a Democratic Society and the Black Power movement.

The raised right fist was frequently used in posters produced during the May 1968 revolt in France, such as &quot;La Lutte continue&quot;, depicting a factory chimney topped with a clenched fist.

A raised right fist icon appears prominently as a feminist symbol on the covers of two major books by Robin Morgan, &quot;Sisterhood is Powerful&quot;, published in 1970, and &quot;Sisterhood Is Forever&quot;, in 2003. The symbol had been popularised in the feminist movement during the Miss America protest in 1968 which Morgan co-organised.

A raised fist incorporates the outline of the state of Wisconsin, as designed in 2011, for union protests against the state rescinding collective bargaining.

==Logo==
The raised fist logo generally carries the same symbolism as a hand gesture. It was an important symbol of workers rights and labor movements, as well as specific labor actions, such as strikes, boycotts, and walk-outs.

Notable examples include the fist and rose, a white fist holding a red rose, used by the Socialist International and some socialist or social democratic parties, such as the French Socialist Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party. The fist can represent ethnic solidarity, such as in the Black Power fist of Black nationalism and the Black Panther Party, a Black Marxist group in the 1960s, or the White Power fist of White nationalism. A Black fist logo was also adopted by the northern soul music subculture. Loyalists in Northern Ireland occasionally use a red clenched fist on murals depicting the Red Hand of Ulster, which is also featured on the flag of Ulster. Irish republicans, on the other hand, have been seen displaying raised fists.

The image gallery shows how a raised fist is used in visual communication. Combined with another graphic element, a raised fist is used to convey polysemous gestures and opposing forces. Depending on the elements combined, the meaning of the gesture changes in tone and intention. For example, a hammer and sickle combined with a raised right fist is part of communist symbolism, while the same right fist combined with a Venus symbol represents Feminism, and combined with a book, it represents some librarians who oppose digital rights management. The Gonzo fist emblem, characterized by two thumbs and four fingers holding a peyote button, was originally used in Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s 1970 campaign for sheriff of Aspen, Colorado. It has become a symbol of Thompson and gonzo journalism as a whole.

The Unicode character for the raised fist is .

==Salute==
Different movements sometimes use different terms to describe the raised fist salute: amongst communists and socialists, raised right fist is sometimes called the red salute, whereas in the United States it is widely known as the Black Power salute due to use by many African-American activists. The Rotfrontkämpferbund paramilitary organization of Communist Party of Germany used the right hand fist salute as early as 1924. By this time, the Soviet Union had already established the use of a traditional Russian military salute. During the Spanish Civil War, it was sometimes known as the anti-fascist salute. A letter from the Spanish Civil War stated: &quot;...the raised fist which greets you in Salud is not just a gesture—it means life and liberty being fought for and a greeting of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world.&quot;

At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, medal winners John Carlos and Tommie Smith gave the raised fist salute during the American national anthem as a sign of black power, and as a protest on behalf of the Olympic Project for Human Rights. They were banned from further Olympic activities by the IOC, as the rules then in place prohibited any political statements at the Olympics. The event was one of the most overtly political statements in the history of the modern Olympic Games. Tommie Smith stated in his autobiography, &quot;Silent Gesture&quot;, that the salute was not a Black Power salute, but in fact a human rights salute.

Nelson Mandela also used the clenched right fist salute upon his release from Victor Verster Prison in 1990.

The raised right fist is used by officials in People&#x27;s Republic of China when being sworn into office.

Psychologist Oliver James has suggested that the appeal of the salute is that it allows the individual to indicate that they &quot;intend to meet malevolent, massive institutional force with force of (their) own&quot;, and that they are bound in struggle with others against common oppression.

<doc id="1074602" wikidata="Q644152" url="?curid=1074602" title="Finlandia">
<text>Finlandia, Op. 26, is a tone poem by the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius. It was written in 1899 and revised in 1900. The piece was composed for the Press Celebrations of 1899, a covert protest against increasing censorship from the Russian Empire, and was the last of seven pieces performed as an accompaniment to a tableau depicting episodes from Finnish history. The premiere was on 2 July 1900 in Helsinki with the Helsinki Philharmonic Society conducted by Robert Kajanus. A typical performance takes between and 9 minutes depending on how it is performed.

In order to avoid Russian censorship, &quot;Finlandia&quot; had to be performed under alternative names at various musical concerts. Titles under which the piece masqueraded were numerous and often confusing—famous examples include &quot;Happy Feelings at the awakening of Finnish Spring,&quot; and &quot;A Scandinavian Choral March.&quot; According to Finland&#x27;s tourism website, &quot;While Finland was still a Grand Duchy under Russia performances within the empire had to take place under the covert title of &#x27;Impromptu&#x27;.&quot;

Most of the piece is taken up with rousing and turbulent music, evoking the national struggle of the Finnish people. Towards the end, a calm comes over the orchestra, and the serene and melodic &quot;Finlandia Hymn&quot; is heard. Often incorrectly cited as a traditional folk melody, the Hymn section is Sibelius&#x27; own creation.

Although he initially composed it for orchestra, in 1900 Sibelius arranged the work for solo piano.

Sibelius later reworked the &quot;Finlandia Hymn&quot; into a stand-alone piece. This hymn, with words written in 1941 by Veikko Antero Koskenniemi, is one of the most important national songs of Finland. It has been repeatedly suggested to be the official national anthem of Finland. Today, during modern performances of the full-length &quot;Finlandia&quot;, a choir is sometimes involved, singing the Finnish lyrics with the hymn section.

With different words, it is also sung as a Christian hymn (&quot;I Sought The Lord, And Afterward I Knew&quot;; &quot;Be Still, My Soul&quot;, &quot;When Memory Fades,&quot; &quot;I Then Shall Live&quot;, &quot;Hail, Festal Day&quot;, in Italian evangelical churches: Veglia al mattino), and was the national anthem of the short-lived African state of Biafra (&quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;). In Wales the tune is used for Lewis Valentine&#x27;s patriotic hymn &quot;Gweddi Dros Gymru (A Prayer for Wales)&quot;.

==Instrumentation==
The tone poem is scored for large orchestra, consisting of the following:

;Woodwinds: 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 B clarinets, 2 bassoons 
;Brass: 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba
;Percussion: timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle
;Strings: 1st violins, 2nd violins, violas, cellos, double basses

== Press Celebrations Music ==
As with the &quot;Karelia Suite&quot;, the original &quot;Press Celebrations Music&quot; suite was never originally released under Sibelius&#x27; supervision, but after almost 99 years with the sheet music untouched, the suite was reconstructed and released on two different CDs, the first one by the Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra in 1998, conducted by Tuomas Ollila, and the second by the Lahti Symphony Orchestra in 2000, conducted by Osmo Vänskä.

The last two movements of the suite were reworked to become &quot;Finlandia&quot;.

The original movements are as follows.
*&quot;Preludium:&quot; &quot;Andante (ma non troppo)&quot;
*&quot;Tableau 1:&quot; &quot;The Song of &quot;
*&quot;Tableau 2:&quot; &quot;The Finns are Baptized by Bishop Henry&quot;
*&quot;Tableau 3:&quot; &quot;Scene from Duke Johan&#x27;s Court&quot;
*&quot;Tableau 4:&quot; &quot;The Finns in the Thirty Years&#x27; War&quot;
*&quot;Tableau 5:&quot; &quot;The Great Hostility&quot;
*&quot;Tableau 6:&quot; &quot;Finland Awakes&quot;

<doc id="1074604" wikidata="Q1368117" url="?curid=1074604" title="Parallel motion linkage">
<text>In kinematics, the parallel motion linkage is a six-bar mechanical linkage invented by the Scottish engineer James Watt in 1784 for the double-acting Watt steam engine. It allows a rod moving practically straight up and down to transmit motion to a beam moving in an arc, without putting significant sideways strain on the rod.

==Description==

In previous engines built by Newcomen and Watt, the piston pulled one end of the walking beam downwards during the power stroke using a chain, and the weight of the pump pulled the other end of the beam downwards during the recovery stroke using a second chain, the alternating forces producing the rocking motion of the beam. In Watt&#x27;s new double-acting engine, the piston produced power on both the upward and downward strokes, so a chain could not be used to transmit the force to the beam. Watt designed the parallel motion to transmit force in both directions whilst keeping the piston rod very close to vertical. He called it &quot;parallel motion&quot; because both the piston and the pump rod were required to move vertically, parallel to one another. 

In a letter to his son in 1808 describing how he arrived at the design, James Watt wrote &quot;I am more proud of the parallel motion than of any other invention I have ever made.&quot; The sketch he included actually shows what is now known as Watt&#x27;s linkage which was a linkage described in Watt&#x27;s 1784 patent but it was immediately superseded by the parallel motion.

The parallel motion differed from Watt&#x27;s linkage by having an additional pantograph linkage incorporated in the design. This did not affect the fundamental principle but it allowed the engine room to be smaller because the linkage was more compact.

The Newcomen engine&#x27;s piston was propelled downward by the atmospheric pressure. Watt&#x27;s device allowed live steam to be used for direct work on both sides of the piston, thus almost doubling the power, and also delivering the power more evenly through the cycle, an advantage when converting the reciprocating motion to rotary motion (whether through a crank or through a Sun and planet gear system).

==Principle of operation==

See the diagram on the right. is the journal (bearing) of the walking beam , which rocks up and down about . is the piston, which is required to move vertically but not horizontally. The heart of the design is the four-bar linkage consisting of , and and the base link is , both joints on the framework of the engine. As the beam rocks, point (which is drawn to aid this explanation, but is not a marked point on the machine itself) describes an elongated figure-eight (more precisely, a lemniscate of Bernoulli) in mid-air. Since the motion of the walking beam is constrained to a small angle, describes only a short section of the figure-eight, which is quite close to a vertical straight line. The figure-eight is symmetrical as long as arms and are equal in length, and straightest when the ratio of to matches that of to . If the stroke length (that is, the maximum travel of ) is , then the straight section is longest when is around and is .

It would have been possible to connect directly to the piston rod (the &quot;Watt&#x27;s linkage&quot; design), but this would have made the machine an awkward shape, with a long way from the end of the walking beam. To avoid this, Watt added the parallelogram linkage to form a pantograph. This guarantees that always lies on a straight line between and , and therefore that the motion of is a magnified version of the motion of . is therefore the point to which the piston rod is attached. The addition of the pantograph made the mechanism shorter and so the building containing the engine could be smaller.

As already noted, the path of is not a perfect straight line, but merely an approximation. Watt&#x27;s design produced a deviation of about one part in 4000 from a straight line. Later, in the 19th century, perfect straight-line linkages were invented, beginning with the Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage of 1864.

<text>The Episcopal Divinity School (EDS) is an unaccredited theological school in New York City. Established to train people for ordination in the American Episcopal Church, the seminary eventually began training students from other denominations. The school currently does not enroll any seminarians, and states that it is currently &quot;exploring multiple models for theological education.&quot; 

For most of its history, EDS was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 2018 to 2023, it was affiliated with Union Theological Seminary in New York City. 

EDS and its predecessors established a reputation for progressive teaching and action on issues of civil rights and social justice. Its faculty and students were directly involved in many of the social controversies surrounding the Episcopal Church in the latter half of the 20th century and at the start of the 21st. From 1930 to 1964, three out of the four presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church were alumni of EDS&#x27; predecessor Episcopal Theological School: James De Wolf Perry, Henry Knox Sherrill, and Arthur Lichtenberger. 

==History==

=== Predecessors ===
The Episcopal Divinity School (EDS) was founded in 1974 by combining the Episcopal Theological School (ETS) and the Philadelphia Divinity School (PDS). ETS&#x27;s first dean was John Seely Stone, a former PDS lecturer.

==== Philadelphia Divinity School ====
The Philadelphia Divinity School was founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1857 as the Divinity School of the Protestant Episcopal Church by Alonzo Potter, Bishop of Pennsylvania.

==== Episcopal Theological School ====
The Episcopal Theological School was founded in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1867 by Boston businessman Benjamin Tyler Reed. Although ETS&#x27; first dean, John Seely Stone, was part of the evangelical wing of the Anglican church, the school developed into a stronghold of the Broad Church movement and welcomed liberal and progressive views. It was &quot;the first Episcopal theological seminary to welcome modern biblical scholarship,&quot; and in 1924 its faculty asked its alumni priests to accommodate congregants who did not believe in the virgin birth. In 1941, ETS became the first Episcopal seminary to appoint a female full-time faculty member (Adelaide Teague Case).

According to one alumnus, the school&#x27;s reputation for theological progressivism was so strong that &quot;candidates for the Episcopal ministry who did not have independent financial means avoided the Cambridge seminary lest they become so infected with its social heresies that they could not hold suburban pulpits.&quot; In 1919, ETS offered its deanship to alumnus C. L. Slattery, who declined the position; nine years later, a committee led by now-Bishop Slattery published a revision to the Book of Common Prayer which made &quot;far-reaching, and in some instances radical,&quot; changes to both language and theology, decisively moving away from the concept of total depravity.

The founders chose Cambridge, Massachusetts for its proximity to Harvard University. ETS provided an Anglican alternative to Harvard&#x27;s divinity school and Memorial Church, both of which were predominantly Unitarian at the time. ETS students were allowed to cross-register in Harvard courses and to use the divinity school library. After retiring from ETS, Henry Washburn served as the director of Harvard Memorial Church from 1940 to 1950.

=== Merger and creation of EDS ===
PDS and ETS merged in 1974. Both institutions were facing bankruptcy at the time. Merging the two institutions and consolidating operations on ETS&#x27;s Cambridge campus allowed the schools to save money while combining their financial endowments. PDS sold its five-acre campus to the University of Pennsylvania, and the PDS campus currently hosts an elementary school assisted by the University of Pennsylvania.

The unified EDS granted degrees until 2017. As an independent seminary, EDS offered Master of Divinity (M.Div.), Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS), and Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) degree programs, as well as a certificate in Anglican studies program. It inherited ETS&#x27;s relationship with Harvard Divinity School, which included cross-registration. It was a member of the Boston Theological Institute, a consortium of seminaries and divinity schools that share library and academic resources and allow cross-registration for courses.

In 2008, EDS sold seven of its thirteen buildings to Lesley University for $33.5 million to help pay off outstanding debts. The two institutions agreed to share part of the remaining EDS campus, offer cross-registration, and pool resources.

Beginning in 2011, EDS allowed members of the Metropolitan Community Church to train at EDS for ordination in their church, receiving specific instruction on their church&#x27;s polity. 

===Affiliation with Union Theological Seminary and move to New York===
In the 21st century, EDS was impacted by broader forces (primarily declining enrollment) affecting many Episcopal seminaries. For example, from 2022 to 2024, the General Theological Seminary leased its New York City campus to Vanderbilt University, refocused its course offerings on primarily-online masters&#x27; programs, and agreed to an arrangement with deeper-pocketed Virginia Theological Seminary under which VTS&#x27; president took over GTS.

Over time, EDS increasingly relied on its endowment to cover operating deficits. From 2011 to 2016, the endowment declined from $70.2 million to $53 million. The school warned that the endowment would eventually become unable to cover future deficits.

In 2016, the school&#x27;s board of trustees decided that the school would cease granting degrees after the end of the 2016–17 academic year. At the time, the school had four full-time faculty and 35 full-time enrolled students. The school issued a statement explaining that &quot;[e]nding unsustainable spending is a matter of social justice.&quot; 

After several months of evaluating how it could continue to support the school&#x27;s mission of theological education, the board of trustees decided to sell its Cambridge campus and to affiliate EDS with Union Theological Seminary (UTS) in New York City. Through this arrangement, Episcopal seminarians would enroll at UTS in the &quot;EDS at Union Anglican Studies Program,&quot; earn a M.Div. from UTS, and fulfill requirements for ordination in the Episcopal Church. The institutions signed an 11-year affiliation agreement, starting in 2018. As of December 2022, EDS-at-UTS educated 21 students. 

As part of the move from Cambridge, EDS terminated its employment contracts with all faculty and staff, and provided them with severance packages. In 2018, Lesley University exercised its right of first refusal to purchase the remainder of the EDS campus. 

=== Independent, non-degree-granting institution ===
On March 31, 2023, Union and EDS announced that they were discontinuing their formal affiliation after 5 years, less than halfway into the initial term of the agreement. EDS discontinued its degree-granting programs. M.Div. students in the EDS-at-UTS program transitioned into the UTS Anglican Studies Program. In the meantime, EDS has relocated to temporary offices at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. It offers some programming in New York and online.

EDS is currently &quot;exploring multiple models for theological education.&quot; It states that it &quot;seeks collaborative opportunities to prepare and equip clergy and lay people for transformative and diverse leadership roles.&quot;

In August 2024, Lydia Kelsey Bucklin was appointed as EDS&#x27; new president and dean, with a directive to &quot;develop and implement a strategic and operational plan&quot; for the school. Although EDS currently does not educate any students, its financial endowment stood at $77.3 million as of April 30, 2024, which includes the sale price of the Cambridge campus.

==Social issues==

PDS and ETS had both attempted to insulate themselves from affiliations with partisan factions within the church. Where other seminaries that existed or would come to exist within the Episcopal Church often affiliated themselves with either the high church or low church movements, PDS and ETS focused on broad social and academic matters rather than issues of churchmanship as such. This may affiliate them with broad church movements, although neither institution explicitly identified themselves as such. EDS has continued in that tradition.

PDS, ETS and EDS have all been known for their focus on pastoral action around progressive social issues. 

===African-American education===
From its inception, PDS admitted and trained African-American students, which was not done anywhere else in the world. The Episcopal Church itself, originally as the Church of England under the Bishop of London in British colonies in North America, had early seen several attempts from within at including African-American and indigenous American peoples in the full life of the church; the first person to be baptized in the Church of England in North America was a Native American person. Social values, particularly with the rise of racial slavery in North America, meant that there were considerable obstacles to such practices, and debates over whether it was right to baptize African-American slaves were controversial. Clergy who baptized slaves were often expelled from their parishes by the wealthy vestries which held their contracts. The church was largely controlled by affluent whites and despite rare actions by clergy, African-American slaves and ex-slaves were largely excluded from participation in the life of the church.

In 1968, ETS hired its first African-American professor, Robert Avon Bennett.

===Education and ordination of women===
In the 1880s, PDS begin training women as deaconesses. In 1929 women were first admitted at PDS in small numbers to theological education programs designed for those preparing to teach religion in colleges.

ETS became the first Episcopal seminary to hire a woman, in 1941, to its full-time faculty.

In 1974, after the formation of EDS, 11 women known as the Philadelphia Eleven were &quot;irregularly&quot; ordained to the priesthood of the Episcopal Church. Several EDS faculty members took part in the ordination and two of the new priests, Carter Heyward and Suzanne Hiatt, were employed as EDS faculty. The affiliation of EDS with this ordination would cause many bishops to refuse to send their postulants for ordination to EDS to receive a theological education. EDS retained a reputation for controversy stemming from this incident even after the Episcopal Church as a whole voted to ordain women to the priesthood in 1976. EDS quickly became the first Episcopal seminary to have women teaching in all fields of study.

===Civil rights===
In 1956, Bishop Henry Knox Sherrill, who graduated from ETS in 1914, spoke out at a press conference on September 18, 1956, in favor of racial integration for the whole church. He said, “integration in the whole church is inevitable; it is fundamental to the heart of the Gospel.”

In 1964, members of the ETS community marched in Boston to protest the racially motivated Birmingham church bombings. In the following year, ETS students and faculty traveled to Alabama to take part in the Selma to Montgomery marches. Several students sought to return to Alabama after the Selma marches to continue to work for racial integration in that state. Jonathan Myrick Daniels, one of those students, was shot and killed outside a store in Hayneville, Alabama, while trying to protect a young African-American woman, Ruby Sales, from a gunman. Sales would go on to attend ETS herself and work for civil rights, founding an inner-city mission dedicated to Daniels who is remembered as a martyr of the Episcopal Church and is remembered regularly at EDS.

===LGBT rights===

In the 1960s, ETS students who were suspected of being homosexual were dismissed, but as church and social opinion began to slowly turn in favor of tolerance of homosexuals, EDS would become a leading center of studies on LGBT issues within the Episcopal Church and the wider Anglican Communion. In 1974, ethics professor William Hayden McCallum came out as a gay man to the school community. Associate professor and priest Carter Heyward came out as a lesbian to the church in a nationwide publication in 1979. By the 1980s, EDS permitted same-sex couples to live in campus housing as it did heterosexual couples previously. In 1995, when St. John&#x27;s Memorial Chapel was opened to marriage services by Dean William Rankin, both heterosexual marriages and same-sex unions were permitted, contrary to the trend in the Episcopal Church at the time. In 1999, the school&#x27;s then dean, Steven Charleston, was the author of the Cambridge Accord, an attempt to reach consensus over the human rights of homosexual people, notwithstanding differences within the Anglican Communion over the moral status of homosexual acts. In 2009, Katherine Hancock Ragsdale became the Dean of EDS, the first openly lesbian person to be dean of an Episcopal seminary. However, in 2015, she indicated she would not seek an extension to her term as Dean – which expired at the end of June – after disputes with faculty regarding changes to the residential seminary model.

<doc id="1074611" wikidata="Q1112688" url="?curid=1074611" title="Commodore 64 software">
<text>The Commodore 64 amassed a large software library of nearly 10,000 commercial titles, covering most genres from games to business applications, and many others.

==Applications, utility, and business software==
While the 1541 disk drive&#x27;s slow performance made the Commodore 64 mostly unsuitable as a business computer, it was still widely used for many important tasks, including computer graphics creation, desktop publishing, and word processing. &quot;Info 64&quot;, the first magazine produced with desktop publishing tools, was created on and dedicated to the Commodore platform.

The best known art package was perhaps KoalaPainter, primarily because of its own custom graphics tablet user interface - the KoalaPad. Another popular drawing program for the C64 was Doodle!. A Commodore 64 version of The Print Shop existed, allowing users to generate signs and banners with a printer. &quot;The Newsroom&quot; was a desktop publishing suite. Light pens and CAD drawing software were also commercially produced, such as the Inkwell Light Pen and related tools.

There were many prepackaged word processors available for the Commodore 64, such as PaperClip and Vizawrite, but a popular DIY program was SpeedScript, which was available as a type-in program from &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;.

The Multiplan spreadsheet application from Microsoft was ported to the Commodore 64, where it competed against established packages such as Calc Result. The first Lotus 1-2-3-like integrated software package for the 64 was Viza Software&#x27;s Vizastar. A complete office suite arrived in the form of British made Mini Office II. In Germany and Scandinavia, many popular application programs were published by German company Data Becker. The typical C64 spreadsheet could store 64 columns and 255 rows, or 16,000 cells, but only 5-10% of them could be used at any one time, due to RAM limitations.

Serious Commodore 64 business users, however, were drawn to GEOS. Due to its speed, ease of use, and full suite of office applications and utility software, GEOS provided a work environment similar to that of an early Apple Macintosh. Arguably the best office applications appeared on GEOS because it was graphically advanced and not limited by the Commodore 64&#x27;s screen area of 40-columns. Being a fully-fledged OS, GEOS brought the arrival of many add-on fonts, accessories, and applications. It also supported most Commodore 64 peripherals and models of third-party printers. KoalaPad and light pen users could use GEOS too, which greatly increased the amount of clip art available for the platform. GEOS proved very popular because of low price for the necessary hardware (and of course the capability of the OS). This was due in part to the aggressive pricing of the Commodore 64 as a games machine and home computer (With rebates, the C64 was going for as little as US$100 at the time). This was in comparison to a typical PC for US$2000 (which required MS-DOS, and another $99 for Windows 1.0) or the venerable Mac 512K Enhanced also $2000.

There were numerous sound-editing tools for the Commodore 64. Commodore released music-composition software which included a keyboard overlay suited for early model Commodore 64s. Software titles such as the Music Construction Set were available for users to compose music with notes; however, the tools which maximized the C64&#x27;s sonic capability were demoscene music tools or pure assembly language. MIDI expansion cartridges and speech-synthesizing hardware was also available for more serious musicians. The Prophet64 cartridge was recently released and features a suite of GUI-style applications for sequencing music, drum and rhythm synthesis, MIDI DIN-sync, and taking advantage of the SID chip in other ways, effectively turning the C64 into a true musical instrument that anyone can use. There was also software which could be used to make the Commodore 64 speak, the best-known being SAM.

* KoalaPainter is an early paint program. It uses two screens. The first displays a menu and the second is the picture that is being worked on. The program is controlled either by a joystick or with a KoalaPad graphics tablet (that was also sold by Koala).
* &quot;Magic Desk&quot; is an application by Commodore that resembles a real typewriter but contains basic editing functions.
* Multiplan is a text-based spreadsheet application written by Microsoft.
* &quot;Vizawrite&quot; is another text-based word processor for the C64, but it looks more like the professional word processors of the early 80s.
* GEOS was a graphical user interface, first released in 1987. It was a small revolution at its time because until then GUIs, other than Apple II Desktop/MouseDesk, were available mostly for the much more powerful 16-bit machines.
* &quot;geoPaint&quot; is a paint program for GEOS. Despite its lower resolution it had all the capabilities of other GUI-based drawing programs of its time.
* &quot;geoWrite&quot; is a word processor for GEOS. It had a GUI and supported many different styles and fonts with the WYSIWYG principle, unlike the other word processors on the C64.
* UIFLI (Underlay Interlace Flexible Line Interpreter) is a graphics mode on the Commodore 64 invented by DeeKay and Crossbow of Crest in 1995.

==Games==



By 1985, games were estimated to make up 60 to 70% of Commodore 64 software. Due in part to its advanced sound and graphic hardware, and to the quality and quantity of games written for it, the C64 became better known as a gaming and home entertainment platform than as a serious business computer. Its large installed user base encouraged commercial companies to flood the market with game software, even up until Commodore&#x27;s demise in 1994. In total over 23,000 unique game titles exist for the Commodore 64.

&quot;International Soccer&quot; was Commodore&#x27;s best first-party game; otherwise &quot;the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity&quot;, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated in 1984. The company did not publish many other games for the C64, instead releasing game cartridges primarily from the failed MAX Machine for the C64. Commodore included an &quot;Ultimax&quot; mode in the Commodore 64&#x27;s hardware, which allowed the computer to emulate a MAX machine for this purpose.

However, aside from the initial Commodore cartridges, very few cartridge-based games were released for the Commodore. Most third-party game cartridges came from Llamasoft, Activision, and Atarisoft, however some of these games found their way into disk and tape versions too. Only later, when the failed C64GS console was produced, did cartridges make a brief comeback, including the production of a few more cartridge-only games. Crackers managed to port these games to disk later on.

While the 1541 floppy disk drive quickly became universal in the US, in Europe it was common for prepackaged commercial game software to either come on floppy disk or cassette-tape format, and sometimes both. Cassette-based games were usually cheaper than their disk-based counterparts; however, due to the Datasette&#x27;s lack of speed and random access, many large games (such as role-playing video games) were never made for the cassette format. Despite this, a great deal of software was published only on the cassette format in Europe, including many &quot;budget&quot; games produced by companies like Mastertronic, Firebird, and Codemasters which were released on cassette only and sold for a fraction of the price of full-price commercial software.
Whilst many commercial software companies produced prepackaged game software, an abundant supply of free software was also available. What is noticeable from the Commodore 64&#x27;s game catalog is that a rather large selection of all C64 games were programmed non-commercially by average Commodore 64 users, with editors included in some games, e.g. Boulder Dash Construction Kit, &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot;, &quot;SEUCK&quot;, &quot;The Quill&quot;, GameMaker. Given the accessibility of BASIC on the Commodore 64, many BASIC games were created and also ported from other computer platforms and modified for the Commodore 64. In addition, many games exist that were released as Type-in programs from numerous magazines, especially European Commodore magazines. Many books and magazines were published containing listings for games, and public-domain software was developed and released from both BBS systems and public domain libraries such as &quot;Binary Zone&quot; in the UK.

There were many classic must-have games produced on the Commodore 64, perhaps too many to mention, including versions of classic video games. Of particular note, the smash hit &quot;Impossible Mission&quot; produced by Epyx was originally designed for the Commodore 64. Epyx&#x27;s multievent games (&quot;Summer Games&quot;, &quot;Winter Games&quot;, &quot;World Games&quot;, and &quot;California Games&quot;) were very popular, as well as perhaps the first driving game with split-screen dynamics, &quot;Pitstop II&quot;. Most of these games eventually made an appearance on the Commodore DTV joystick unit many years later.
Other hit games such as &quot;Boulder Dash&quot;, &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Elite&quot; were all given Commodore 64 versions. Cassette users may remember titles such as &quot;Master of Magic&quot;, &quot;Rocketball&quot;, &quot;One Man and His Droid&quot;, and &quot;Spellbound&quot; on Mastertronic&#x27;s budget labels. Other notable titles on the Commodore 64 include the &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; role-playing game series. Hewson/Graftgold were responsible for several well-received C64 titles including &quot;Paradroid&quot; and &quot;Uridium&quot;—made famous for their metallic bas-relief styled graphic effects and addictive gameplay. System 3 produced &quot;The Last Ninja&quot; action adventure series originally on the C64. &quot;Armalyte&quot;, a groundbreaking shoot &#x27;em up title from Thalamus Ltd, and &quot;Turrican I &amp; II&quot; are among some of the highest rated games for the Commodore 64 (according to &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, which awarded &quot;Gold Medals&quot; to these games).

Notable game designers for the Commodore 64 are: Paul Norman, Danielle Barry, Andrew Braybrook, Stephen Landrum, Tim and Chris Stamper, Jeff Minter and Tony Gibson just to name a few.

During the final mainstream commercial years of the Commodore 64, Issue 38 of &quot;Commodore Format&quot; magazine in November 1993 awarded the only 100% rating ever given to a Commodore 64 game in any major Commodore 64 publication. As no game had ever received such a high rating before, and as the commercial Commodore 64 scene was winding down in the mid-1990s, the awarding of 100% was seen as somewhat controversial. The game, titled &quot;Mayhem in Monsterland&quot;, was developed to exploit a multitude of programming tricks and quirks in the Commodore 64&#x27;s hardware to the maximum. The impressive use of non-standard colors and scrolling resulted in perhaps the most graphically stunning game ever produced for the Commodore 64. The gameplay itself is similar to that of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog.&quot;

Whilst mainstream commercial activity for games no longer exists for the C64, many enthusiasts and hobbyists still write games for the platform. In addition, a few small publishers still sell game software.

Commodore 64 games continue to inspire developers and gamers on modern platforms such as iOS with many games being produced using similar styles of game-play mechanics to those from the Commodore 64 era.

==Type-ins, bulletin boards, and disk magazines==
Besides prepackaged commercial software, the C64, like the VIC before it, had a large library of type-in programs. Numerous computer magazines offered type-in programs, usually written in BASIC or assembly language or a combination of the two. Because of its immense popularity, many general-purpose magazines that supported other computers offered C64 type-ins (&quot;Compute!&quot; was one of these), and at its peak, there were many magazines in North America (&quot;Ahoy!&quot;, &quot;Commodore Magazine&quot;, &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, &quot;Power/Play&quot;, &quot;RUN&quot; and &quot;Transactor &quot;) dedicated to Commodore computers exclusively. These magazines sometimes had disk companion subscriptions available at extra cost with the programs stored on disk to avoid the need to type them in. The disk magazine &quot;Loadstar&quot; offered fairly elaborate ready-to-run programs, music, and graphics. Books of type-ins were also common, especially in the machine&#x27;s early days. There were also many books publishing type-ins for the C-64, sometimes programs that had originally appeared in one of the magazines, but books containing original software were also available.

A large library of public domain and freeware programs, distributed by online services such as Q-Link and CompuServe, BBSs, and user groups also emerged. Commodore also maintained an archive of public domain software, which it offered for sale on diskette. Despite limited RAM and disk capacity, the Commodore 64 was a popular platform for BBS hosting. Some of the most popular installations included the highly optimized and fast Blue Board program, and the Color64 BBS System, which allowed the use of color PETSCII graphics. Many BBS sysops used high-capacity floppy drives like the SFD-1001 or hard drives such as the Lt. Kernal.

==Software cracking==
The C64 software market had widespread problems with copyright infringement. There were many kinds of copy protection systems, employed on both cassette and floppy disk, to prevent the unauthorized copying of commercial Commodore 64 software. Practically all of them were worked around or defeated by crackers and warez groups. The popularity of this activity has been attributed to the large Commodore 64 user base.

Many BBSs offered cracked commercial software, sometimes requiring special access and usually requiring users to maintain an upload/download ratio. A large number of warez groups existed, including Fairlight, which continued to exist more than a decade after the C64&#x27;s demise. Some members of these groups turned to telephone phreaking and credit card or calling card fraud to make long-distance calls, either to download new titles not yet available locally or to upload newly cracked titles released by the group.

Not all Commodore 64 users had modems, however. For these people, many warez group &quot;swappers&quot; maintained contacts throughout the world. These contacts would usually mass-mail cracked floppy disks through the postal service. Also, sneakernets existed at schools and businesses all over the world, as friends and colleagues would trade (and usually later copy) their software collections. At a time before the Internet was widespread, this was the only way for many users to amass huge software libraries. Also, and particularly in Europe, groups of people would hold copy-parties explicitly to copy software, usually irrespective of software licence.

Several popular utilities were sold that contained custom routines to defeat most copy-protection schemes in commercial software. (Fast Hack&#x27;em—probably the most popular example—was itself widely redistributed.) Pirates Toolbox was another popular set of tools for copying disks and removing copy protection. Tapes could be copied with special software, but often it was simply done by dubbing the cassette in a dual-deck tape recorder or by relying on an Action Replay cartridge to freeze the program in memory and save to cassette. Cracked games could often be copied manually without any special tools. In Europe, some hardware devices, colloquially known as &quot;black boxes&quot;, were available under the counter; these connected two C1530 tape decks together at the C64&#x27;s connection point, permitting a copy to be made whilst loading a game. This overcame the difficulties in direct dubbing of later games using the high-speed loaders that were developed to overcome the very long load times.

==BASIC==
Like most computers from the late 1970s and 1980s, the Commodore 64 came with a version of the BASIC programming language. It was used for both writing software and for performing the duties of an operating system such as loading software and formatting disks.

The onboard BASIC programming language offered no easy way to tap the machine&#x27;s advanced graphics and sound capabilities. Accessing these associated memory addresses to make use of the advanced features required using the PEEK and POKE commands, third-party BASIC extensions, such as Simons&#x27; BASIC, or to program in assembly language. Commodore had a better implementation of BASIC but chose to ship the C64 with the same BASIC 2.0 used in the VIC-20 to minimize cost. This, however, did not stop countless people making thousands of programs in the BASIC V2 language, and teaching people their first steps in computer programming.

==Music==

The MOS Technology 6581 SID is the sound chip for the C64, for which many music software programs were written. One musical software tool for the C64 was &quot;Kawasaki Synthesizer&quot;, created in 1983.

==Development tools==
Aside from games and office applications such as word processors, spreadsheets, and database programs, the C64 was well equipped with development tools from Commodore as well as third-party vendors. Various assembler solutions were available; the &quot;MIKRO&quot; assembler came in ROM cartridge form and integrated seamlessly with the standard BASIC screen editor. The PAL Assembler by Brad Templeton was also popular. Several companies sold BASIC compilers, C compilers and Pascal compilers, and a subset of Ada, to mention but a few popular languages available for the machine.

The likely most popular entertainment oriented development suite was the &quot;Shoot-&#x27;Em-Up Construction Kit&quot;, affectionately known as SEUCK. SEUCK allowed those non-skilled in programming to create original, professional-looking shooting games. Garry Kitchen&#x27;s GameMaker and Arcade Game Construction Kit also allowed non-programmers to create simple games with little effort. Text adventure game tools included &quot;The Quill&quot; and Graphic Adventure Creator development suites. The &quot;Pinball Construction Set&quot; gave users a pinball machine to design.

==Modern-day development tools==
Software development on the Commodore 64 never really stopped. There are many tools available today, including IDEs such as CBM prg Studio, Relaunch64, and WUDSN IDE, which is a plug-in for the open source Eclipse IDE. Along with small C compilers such as cc65, there are many assemblers and cross assemblers to be used on modern day PCs:

* Turbo Assembler
* Kick Assembler by Mads Nielsen
* acme
* ca65 (which is part of cc65.)
* c64asm

C64List by Jeff Hoag is both a cross assembler and cross-platform BASIC editor/tokenizer that allows developers to write mixed BASIC/assembly programs in a text file on a PC and compile it into a single .prg file that can be executed on an actual C64 or emulator.

Tools such as PuCrunch, an LZ77 data and executable self extracting compression program, are also available released under GNU LGPL. Sprite editors like Sprite Pad allow you to design C64 Sprites and animations using Windows. GoatTracker allows you to write music using modern OSs and uses the ReSID engine.

Using CodeNet it is possible to transfer and execute programs to a C64 via a TCP/IP network cable from a PC. Although this does require an Ethernet adapter on the C64 such as Individual Computers RR-Net or an appropriate version of the 1541 Ultimate.

==Retrocomputing efforts==
The magnetic tapes and disks upon which home computer software was stored are decaying at an alarming rate. In order to preserve game software and information, efforts are underway to copy from these degrading media onto fresh media which will help ensure a long life for the software and make it available for emulation and archiving. In addition, there are other efforts to archive Commodore 64 documentation, software manuals, magazine articles, and other nostalgia (such as software packaging artwork, game screenshots, and Commodore 64 TV commercials). Commodore 64 game software has been remarkably well documented and preserved - a considerable feat when taking the amount of software available for the platform into consideration.

The GameBase 64 &quot;(GB64)&quot; organization has an online database of game information, which at version 7 holds information for 21,000 unique game titles. The current version of GameBase is v18 and has a database of nearly 29,000 titles. The database is still growing as new information comes to light.
Besides the online database a downloadable offline version exists. Using one of the frontends GameBase (Windows only) or jGameBase (platform independent) you can conveniently browse the database entries and directly start them in an emulator.
The GoodGB64 variant of Cowering&#x27;s Good Tools allows users to audit their C64 game collections using the GameBase64 database.

There are tools available to transfer original 1541 floppy discs to or from the PC. The Star Commander is a DOS-based tool, cbm4linux is a Linux tool, and cbm4win is a Windows tool to transfer data from an original floppy drive to the PC, or vice versa, using a simple X-cable. There are also tools available, 64HDD, to allow your C64 to directly load D64 software stored on your PC using the same cables. The Individual Computers Catweasel allows PC users to use their own floppy drive to read C64 disks.

In addition, there is now a growing number of emulators available, which allow the use of an emulated C64 on modern computing hardware. These include VICE, which is free and runs on most modern as well as some older platforms; CCS64, which is available for Windows and is written by Per Håkan Sundell; and Power64, which has versions for Mac OS X and OS 9. It is also possible to play Commodore 64 games online using your browser through emulators written in Javascript.

Also the Quantum Link service has been reconstructed as Quantum Link Reloaded. It can be accessed with a real Commodore 64, or through the VICE emulator.

Special hardware has also been designed to aid the conservation of software, such as the IDE64 cartridge, which allows the user to connect a modern PC IDE ATA hard drive or a CompactFlash flashcard directly to the machine, giving the possibility to copy software onto the hard drive and use it from there, preventing wear on a decades-old floppy disk.

Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console service offers Commodore 64 games for download on the Wii console in North America and Europe.

<text>Frome St Quintin is a village in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated approximately northwest of the county town Dorchester. It is sited on an outcrop of greensand near the head of the Frome valley, among chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. Dorset County Council&#x27;s latest (2013) estimate of the parish population is 150. There are naturally occurring springs in the area and the first habitation is likely to have been during the Roman era. The parish church dates from the 13th century. Just over west of the village and in Cattistock parish is Chantmarle, a 15th-century manor house with later additions.

<text>Harvard Divinity School (HDS) is one of the constituent schools of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The school&#x27;s mission is to educate its students either in the academic study of religion or for leadership roles in religion, government, and service. It also caters to students from other Harvard schools that are interested in the former field. HDS is among a small group of university-based, non-denominational divinity schools in the United States.

==History==

Harvard College was founded in 1636 as a Puritan/Congregationalist institution and trained ministers for many years. The separate institution of the Divinity School dates from 1816, when it was established as the first non-denominational divinity school in the United States. (Princeton Theological Seminary had been founded as a Presbyterian institution in 1812. Andover Theological Seminary was founded in 1807 by orthodox Calvinists who fled Harvard College after it appointed liberal theologian Henry Ware to the Hollis Professorship of Divinity in 1805.)

During its first century, Harvard Divinity School was unofficially associated with American Unitarianism.
===Harvard Divinity School and Unitarianism===
Throughout the 18th century, Enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among Congregationalist ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.

When the Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and the president of Harvard Joseph Willard died a year later, in 1804, the overseer of the college Jedidiah Morse demanded that orthodox men be elected.

Nevertheless, after much struggle, the Unitarian Henry Ware was elected in 1805, which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional, Calvinist ideas at Harvard to the dominance of liberal, Arminian ideas (defined by traditionalists as Unitarian ideas). The appointment of Ware, with the election of the liberal Samuel Webber to the presidency of Harvard two years later, led Jedidiah Morse and other conservatives to found the Andover Theological Seminary as an orthodox alternative to the Harvard Divinity School.

===Today===
Today, students and faculty come from a variety of religious backgrounds: Christian (all denominations), Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and others. Its academic programs attempt to balance theology and religious studies—that is, the &quot;believer&#x27;s&quot; perspective on religion with the &quot;secular&quot; perspective on religion. This is in contrast to many other divinity schools where one or the other is given primacy (Yale Divinity School, for example, emphasizes its theological program, while the majority of students at the University of Chicago Divinity School enroll in its &quot;religious studies&quot; master of arts program).

==Buildings==

===Divinity Hall===

Divinity Hall, dedicated in 1826, was the first Harvard building built outside Harvard Yard. It contains classrooms, faculty and staff offices, and Divinity Chapel, also called Emerson Chapel, where Ralph Waldo Emerson gave the Divinity School Address in 1838.

===Swartz Hall (formerly Andover Hall)===

Completed in 1911 at a cost of $300,000, Andover Hall was designed by Allen and Collens, a firm that focused largely on neo-medieval and ecclesiastical designs, and is the only building at Harvard built in the Collegiate Gothic style of architecture.

Andover Hall was commissioned by Andover Theological Seminary, which, by 1906, saw its enrollment slide and entered an affiliation with the Divinity School in 1908. The Hall contained a chapel, library, dorms, and seminar and lecture rooms. Today, the building still contains a chapel and some classrooms, but it also holds many administrative and faculty offices.

On May 1, 2019, the building&#x27;s name was changed to Swartz Hall in honor of philanthropists Susan Shallcross Swartz and James R. Swartz.

===Jewett House===
Jewett House, constructed in 1913, is named for its first occupant, James Richard Jewett, a Harvard University professor of Arabic from 1914 to 1933. Jewett&#x27;s son had donated the house to Harvard for the use of the Divinity School, but it was instead used by Harvard University Press. In 1956, the house was renovated to serve as the home of the Harvard Divinity School&#x27;s dean.

===Carriage House===
The Carriage House of Jewett House is now the home for the Women&#x27;s Studies in Religion Program. In the past, it served as a home or office for a series of Divinity School faculty and staff, including the family of Brita and former dean Krister Stendahl, who lived in the Carriage House in the 1960s.

===Library===
Previously housed in Andover Hall, the library moved into its own two-story granite building, designed by Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson and Abbott in 1960. In September 2001, the library completed an $11.5-million renovation that added two stories, enhanced its technology facilities and study areas, and improved its information systems.

===Center for the Study of World Religions building===
Constructed in 1960, the Center for the Study of World Religions building was designed by the Catalonian architect Josep Lluis Sert, then dean of Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Design, for what was his first Harvard commission.

===Rockefeller Hall===

Rockefeller Hall, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes in 1970, featured seminar rooms and a refectory on the ground floor and student housing above. A 2008 renovation by VSBA/Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates, Inc. transformed the upper floors into staff offices, modernized access and created the fourth LEED Gold building at Harvard.

==Academics==
===Degrees===
Harvard Divinity School is accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS) and approved by ATS to grant the following degrees:

*master of theological studies (MTS)
*master of divinity (MDiv)
*master of religion and public life (MRPL)
*master of theology (ThM)
In April 2014, the faculty of HDS voted to suspend admission to its doctor of theology (Th.D.) program, although students already enrolled in the ThD program were allowed to complete their degrees. Instead, doctoral students pursue doctor of philosophy (PhD) degrees under the auspices of the Committee on the Study of Religion, which is made up of 50% Arts and Sciences and 50% Divinity faculty members and housed in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. While many PhD students in the GSAS take courses at HDS, and both HDS and FAS characterize the PhD as a joint program, PhD students are formally enrolled in the GSAS and not HDS; only the GSAS at Harvard may award the PhD.

===Curriculum===
Candidates for the MTS choose among 18 areas of academic focus:

* African and African American Religious Studies
* Buddhist Studies
* Comparative Studies
* East Asian Religions
* Hebrew Bible / Old Testament
* Hindu Studies
* History of Christianity
* Islamic Studies
* Jewish Studies
* New Testament and Early Christianity
* Philosophy of Religion
* Religions of the Americas
* Religion, Ethics, and Politics
* Religion, Literature, and Culture
* Religion and the Social Sciences
* South Asian Religious Studies
* Theology
* Women, Gender, Sexuality, and Religion
Candidates for the MDiv are required to take at least twelve courses in scriptural interpretation and histories, theologies, and practices. Those 12 courses must include:
* Three courses in the theories, methods, and practices of scriptural interpretation
* Six courses in the histories, theologies, and practices of religious traditions
* No more than nine courses in the same religious tradition, or listed in no religious tradition(s)
* At least six courses addressing one or more religious tradition(s); of those six, only three may be in the same tradition

===Harvard Divinity School Library (previously Andover-Harvard Theological Library)===

Library support for the study of religion at Harvard predates the establishment of the Divinity School; almost three-fourths of the 400 volumes that John Harvard gave to Harvard College in 1638 were theological in nature. Books on religion made up a third to a half of the college&#x27;s holdings until the Divinity School was established in 1816 and duplicates from the College Library were combined with new purchases to form the beginnings of a specialized library for the school. In 1911, Harvard Divinity School and Andover Theological Seminary formed a partnership and agreed to house their collections together in a common library; when the educational partnership of the schools was dissolved in 1926, Andover Seminary&#x27;s deposits remained in the library under the terms of a continuing agreement. The library&#x27;s name changed from &quot;Andover-Harvard Theological Library&quot; to &quot;Harvard Divinity School Library&quot; in 2021.

The library&#x27;s collections include all religious traditions in order to support the many approaches to the study of religion at Harvard Divinity School. Its historical collection strengths include Protestant Christianity, Unitarian Universalism, and biblical studies. Additional areas of collecting emphasis since the second half of the twentieth century include women&#x27;s studies in religion, the relation of religion to ethnicity and to LGBTQ studies, the ecumenical movement, interreligious communication, and religion and peace-making. Similarly, the rare book collection has strengths in early Protestant Christianity, Unitarian Universalism and related “nonconforming” traditions, and biblical studies. Notable special collections include the papers of Unitarian preacher and theologian William Ellery Channing, theologians Paul Tillich and H. Richard Niebuhr, and New Testament scholar Caspar René Gregory.

Harvard Divinity School Library is part of Harvard Library, whose resources are available to all faculty, staff, and students at HDS. Harvard Library&#x27;s collection has over six million digitized items, 20 million print volumes, 400 million manuscripts, one million maps, tens of millions of digital images, and rare and special collections. Harvard Library collects collaboratively with peer institutions and facilitates international open access, multiplying researchers’ access to materials.

The HDS Library also participates in the Boston Theological Interreligious Consortium (BTI) library program, which extends borrowing privileges to HDS students and faculty at libraries of other BTI schools.

====Center for the Study of World Religions====

Founded in 1960 after an anonymous donation in 1957, the Center for the Study of World Religions at Harvard Divinity School is a residential community of academic fellows, graduate students, and visiting professors of many world religious traditions. The center focuses on the understanding of religions globally through its research, publications, funding, and public programs. It welcomes scholars and practitioners and highlights the intellectual and historical dimensions of religious dialogue.

The center sponsors a diverse range of educative programs, ranging from public lectures to colloquia and reading groups, student-initiated projects, and &quot;religion in the news&quot; lunches on topics of public interest. The center&#x27;s meditation room is open to all members of the Harvard community.

Directors of the CSWR have included Robert H. L. Slater (1958–64), Wilfred Cantwell Smith (1954–73), John B. Carman (1973–89), Lawrence E. Sullivan (1990–2003), Donald K. Swearer (2004–10), and Francis X. Clooney (2010–17). , its director is Charles Stang, a scholar of ancient Christianity, focusing especially on Eastern varieties of late antique Christianity.

====Women&#x27;s Studies in Religion Program====
The Women&#x27;s Studies in Religion Program (WSRP) at Harvard Divinity School was founded in 1973 as a response to student requests to include women&#x27;s perspectives in the sources, methods, and subject matter of the HDS curriculum. The program brings five postdoctoral scholars to HDS as visiting faculty each year. Each research associate works on a book-length research project related to religion and gender and teaches a course related to their research. Since its founding, the program has supported more than 200 scholars from institutions of higher learning in the United States and around the world.

Directors of the Women&#x27;s Studies in Religion Program include Brinton Lykes (1973–77), Constance Buchanan (1977–97), and Ann D. Braude (1998–present).

===Past===

====Program in Religion and Secondary Education====
The Program in Religion and Secondary Education (PRSE) was a teacher education program that prepared students to teach about religion in public schools from a non-sectarian perspective. It began in 1972 as a two-year pilot project known as the &quot;Secondary School Teaching Certificate Option,&quot; and by 1983, it had evolved into a collaboration between Harvard Divinity School and the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Students in the master of theological studies or master of divinity degree programs integrated their work in religion with courses on education and public policy to understand the relationship between religion and education and to advance religious literacy within their fields of licensure. The program stopped admitting new students in the 2009–10 academic year, although students who were already in the PRSE were able to finish their degrees in normal fashion.

====Summer Leadership Institute====
The Summer Leadership Institute (SLI) was a two-week training program that sought to establish theological instruction and grounding for individuals engaged in community and economic development. It was offered by Harvard Divinity School from 1998 to 2008.

The program of study was divided into four modules: Theology, Ethics, and Public Policy; Organizational Development and Management; Housing and Community Development; and Finance and Economic Development. Participants also developed individual plans of action, on a case-study model, applicable to the local work in their communities. It was a full-time residential program, holding classes five days a week, with an emphasis on faith-based case studies of corporations and communities.

More than 450 participants completed the program. About 50 people were selected each year from around the United States and internationally to participate in lectures, seminars, and field visits with faculty from across Harvard and other recognized experts.

Directors of the program were Preston N. Williams (1998–2008) and Charles Gilchrist Adams (2008–09).

<text>Xtra-vision was a video, film and music retailer that operated across the island of Ireland. Founded in 1979, it had 200 shops at its peak before running into financial difficulties, changing ownership a number of times, and ultimately closing in 2021.

== History ==
Xtra-vision was founded by Richard Murphy in 1979. At its peak, it operated over 200 shops across both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Murphy later went on to form Chartbusters in 1993.

Xtra-vision went into financial difficulties in the early 1990s after aggressive expansion of their retail network caused a massive increase in their stock price on the Irish Stock Exchange, without sufficient liquidity to continue the network expansion, and their books having overestimated the value of their video stock in shops . The company entered examinership and its finances were turned around by businessman Peter O&#x27;Grady Walshe in 1993. The company was bought by a venture capital consortium in 1994, with O&#x27;Grady Walshe as managing director. In 1996, the company was sold to US giant Blockbuster.
The chain was run by Blockbuster from 1996. The chain never rebranded in Ireland, citing market research that the Xtra-vision name was better known and more respected than Blockbuster across the island. The few Xtra-vision shops outside Ireland — those in Manchester, London and New Hampshire, were rebranded to Blockbuster after the takeover.

The company had an exclusive deal meaning that any movie with funding from the Irish Film Board would initially be provided for rental and sale solely through their network.

In August 2009, Blockbuster sold its Irish operations to Birchhall Investments. In May 2011, the company went into examinership but successfully exited in August.
On 29 April 2013, the company announced that it was to enter receivership with Luke Charleton and Colin Farquharson, of Ernst &amp; Young. On 7 May 2013, the receivers announced that 20 shops would close throughout Ireland with a loss of up to 120 jobs. These outlets were closed due to trading losses because of fall in revenue. Xtra-vision was sold to Hilco Capital Ireland in June 2013 for an undisclosed sum.

On 30 August 2013, Hilco announced that 26 Xtra-Vision shops would be dual-branded as HMV/Xtra-Vision).

On 27 January 2016, the High Court appointed a provisional liquidator to Xtra-Vision after the company became insolvent and unable to pay their debts, with most of the 580 jobs expected to be lost.
The company thereafter operated as an online business, selling movies, video games and electronics, and also operated vending machines (branded as Xtra-Vision Xpress) for renting movies and video games in SuperValu supermarkets, petrol stations and shopping centres. New movies were added every Friday. The customer selected the item they wished to rent and paid by debit/credit card. No subscription was required, but an e-mail address had to be provided if a receipt was desired. The item had to be returned by 8pm on the return date (between 1-3 nights depending on amount of discs rented). If not returned, the fee was €1.50 daily, up to a maximum of 10 days (€15). After 10 days, the disc was the customer&#x27;s to keep.

On 7 July 2021, Xtra-Vision Xpress was placed into voluntary liquidation and the business was closed.

On the 15th of May 2024 Reuben May bought the xtra-vision brand and was granted a trademark on Oct 31st 2024. Plans are now in the works to create a new business model for the once iconic xtra-vision brand and launch Irelands first dedicated Esports gaming lounge in early 2025

== Xbox One release controversy ==
When the Xbox One was released in November 2013, Xtra-vision gained negative media attention due to their policy of forcing customers who had pre-ordered the console to purchase an additional game in order to get their console. After media attention and backlash on social media websites, Ireland&#x27;s National Consumer Agency launched an investigation into Xtra-vision&#x27;s practices. Xtra-vision reversed this policy, and announced that refunds were available for those who had purchased an additional game with their pre-ordered console.

<text>The Fiji national rugby union team represents Fiji in men&#x27;s international rugby union. Fiji competed in the Pacific Tri-Nations and now competes in its successor tournament Pacific Nations Cup. Fiji also regularly plays test matches during the June and November test windows. They have beaten the major rugby playing sides of Wales, Scotland, Australia, France, Italy, Argentina and England. The only major sides Fiji are yet to beat are New Zealand, South Africa and Ireland.

The &quot;Flying Fijians&quot; as they are nicknamed compete every four years at the Rugby World Cup. Their best performances were the 1987, 2007 and 2023 tournaments when they defeated Argentina, Wales and Australia respectively to reach the quarterfinals.

Fiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport. There are approximately 80,000 registered players from a total population of around 950,000. One obstacle for Fiji is simply getting their rugby players to play for the national team, as many have contracts in Europe or with Super Rugby teams where the money is far more rewarding. The repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies.

The cibi (pronounced ) war dance is performed by the Fiji rugby team before each Test match. It has been used on the rugby field since 1939, though its origins date back to the country&#x27;s warring times with its Pacific neighbours.

==History==
===Early years===
Rugby was first played in Fiji by European and Fijian soldiers of the Native Constabulary at Ba, on Viti Levu Island in 1884. In 1913 a Union was founded for the European settlers.

In December 1913, the All Blacks, who had been touring so very successfully in California, were on their way back to New Zealand. The Fiji RFU arranged a game with them at Albert Park, the first representative match to be played in the colony. The Fiji team were Europeans. The All Blacks won 67–3; Fiji&#x27;s points came from a try scored by their captain and coach, PJ Sheehan. By 1914 a &#x27;native competition&#x27; was started and in 1915 a Fiji Native Union was begun and became affiliated to the Fiji RFU.

===Inter-war period===

Fiji played their first international against Western Samoa in Apia, Samoa on 18 August 1924. Fiji&#x27;s 20-man squad came exclusively from the five registered native clubs of the time. The match was played at 7 am to allow the Samoans time to get to work afterwards and was played on a pitch with a large tree on the halfway line. Fiji wore black and won 6–0 despite playing barefoot. The return match was won 9–3 by Samoa to draw the series. The first-ever Fiji test team continued their overseas adventure with a nine-match tour of Tonga. Though Fiji lost the first test played in Nukualofa 9–6, they were not to lose again, taking the second test 14–3 then drawing the decider 0–0. They won all six of the matches against non-test opposition.

Auckland University College were the first overseas side to visit Fiji in 1926, The Kiwi students played the Fiji Europeans and finished the three-match series with a win, loss and draw. Tonga also visited Fiji that year and for the first time Fiji played in their present strip of white jersey, palm tree badge and black shorts. The three match series finished level with Tonga winning the first test 9–6; Fiji winning the second 14–3 and the final game a 0–0 draw.

During the 1927 season, a General Meeting was called for the purpose of arranging a return visit to New Zealand at the invitation of Auckland University. Some 30 players expressed their willingness to make the trip, but after all arrangements had been made, there were insufficient players available so management cancelled the trip, much to the regret of Auckland.
Between 1924 and 1938 Fiji and Tonga played three test series every alternate year. During this period this was the only representative rugby union that Fiji played. Matches between the two Pacific nations were hard fought; many have claimed that the ancient feuding wars between the Islanders were transplanted onto the rugby field. Troubles during the third Test of Fiji&#x27;s 1928 tour to Tonga forced the game to be abandoned with Tonga losing 11–8.
The first New Zealand Māori team to visit Fiji came in 1938. Fijians played in boots for the first time but there was still a tendency to take off boots during the match and throw them to the touch-line. On the five-match tour, the Māori beat Fiji 2nd XV and Fiji Europeans before playing a three match series. The first test ended in a 3–3 draw, the second an 11–5 win for the Fijians and the Māori won the final test 6–3 to square the series.
In 1939 Fiji toured New Zealand for the first time. Fiji&#x27;s captain for that tour, Ratu Sir George Cakobau, decided that his side should have a war dance to rival the haka. He approached Ratu Bola, the high chief of the warrior clan of Navusaradave in Bau, who taught them the cibi which has been Fiji&#x27;s pre-match ritual ever since. With many players still preferring to play barefoot, the Fijians played with a care-free spirit and created history by becoming the first team to go through a full tour of New Zealand unbeaten, winning seven and drawing one, a record that stands to this day. They played and beat the Māori again 14–4.

===Post-war era===

Fiji successfully toured New Zealand again in 1951. They beat the New Zealand Māori 21–14. Fiji&#x27;s first tour of Australia helped the Australian Rugby Union recover from the brink of bankruptcy in 1952. The Test series was drawn 1–1 in front of record crowds. Australia won the first test 15–9 but the Fijians took the second with a 17–15 win.

A second tour of Australia took place in 1954 and again drew record crowds. Again Australia won the first test but only by 22–19. The test series was drawn 1–1 after Fiji won the second test 18–16. The same year Fiji played host to Western Samoa. Fiji toured New Zealand again in 1957 and beat the Māori 36–13 in Dunedin and 17–8 in Wellington, then defeated a strong Auckland team 38–17.
In 1964 Fiji toured Europe for the first time, they played five memorable games in Wales, culminating in a classic encounter in Cardiff that was talked about for years. Wales won 28–22 but conceded six tries for just the second time in their history. In 1970 a rampant Fijian side destroyed the Barbarians 29–9 at Gosforth. A last-minute try saw New Zealand safely through 14–13 over Fiji in Suva in 1974.

In August 1977 the British Lions made a stopover in Fiji on the way home from their tour of New Zealand. Fiji beat them 25–21 at Buckhurst Park, Suva. In 1982 Fiji beat Vancouver XV to begin a 15-match winning streak through to 1984.

===Modern era===
Fiji played their first full test against Wales in Cardiff in 1985, the home pack dominating in a 40–3 win with two tries to Phil Davies. Fiji were also heavily beaten by Llanelli and Cardiff, but lost by just one point in their test with Ireland.

Wales visited Suva the following year, where captain Dai Pickering&#x27;s summer tour was to a premature end when he suffered concussion. Richard Moriarty took over and saw his side&#x27;s 13–0 lead cut to a single point before Wales pulled away for a 15–22 win.

In 1987 Fiji made the quarter-final of the Rugby World Cup and seemed close to beating France according to the match referee, at one point even leading 4-3, but were eventually ground down by the French 31-16. 
In 1991 Rugby World Cup Fiji lost all three of its matches and finished bottom of its pool. Wales&#x27; third test win over Fiji came in Suva in 1994. The tourists fielded a weakened line-up to allow all their squad a game, but they were good enough to run out 23–8 victors.

Fiji had a troubled tour of Wales and Ireland in 1995, losing six of nine games with defeat to Neath, Cardiff and Pontypridd. However, they managed to run Wales close at the Arms Park, losing only 15–19. They failed to qualify for the 1995 World Cup having lost to Tonga and Western Samoa.

Fiji rebuilt ahead of the 1999 World Cup, new coach Brad Johnstone instilling discipline and determination into their set-piece play. They made a winning start by beating Canada and Namibia and again seemed about to beat France in Toulouse when things went wrong. A controversial refereeing performance from Paddy O&#x27;Brien was felt to have cost them a win over France, Fiji losing 28–19. They did make the quarter-final play-off but lost 45–24 to the combative games; England at Twickenham. Soon after the tournament Johnstone departed for Italy.

In 2001 Fiji were crowned Pacific Rim champions, defeating Samoa 28–17 in the final in Tokyo. Fiji&#x27;s played Wales again at the Millennium Stadium in November 2002. Two tries and 21 points from the boot of Stephen Jones helped the home side to a comfortable 58–14 win.

Fiji began their 2003 Rugby World Cup qualifying campaign in June 2002 when the three leading Pacific Island nations faced each other in a round robin in the second round of the Oceania zone qualifiers. The Fijians started with defeats of Samoa and Tonga, but their loss to Samoa on home soil meant that they had to beat Tonga by more than 20 points to finish top of the pool. This they duly did with a 47–20 win in Nadi. At the World Cup they beat Japan 41–13 and narrowly survived a scare against the US Eagles winning 19–18. However a 20–22 loss against Scotland and an 18–61 beating by France saw them finish third in their pool and fail to qualify for the knock-out stage.

Results since have been mixed for Fiji. Although they have traditionally been the strongest of the Pacific Nations, they were beaten 29–27 by New Zealand Maori in 2004 and went down 91–0 by the All Blacks. In July 2005, five Fiji internationals were banned from playing international rugby for the rest of the year following a drunken brawl in Japan after a Pacific Five Nations match.

Their 2007 season started off as one of Fiji&#x27;s worst seasons. They had a very inexperienced team and lost to both pacific rivals Tonga and Samoa, and suffered heavy defeats to Australia and the Junior All Blacks. The only win for Fiji at the 2007 &quot;Pacific 6 Nations&quot; was against Japan, however they did manage an unexpected 14–14 draw against Australia A. With most of Fiji&#x27;s more experienced players back in the team Fiji slowly improved in the 2007 world cup to qualify for the quarter finals for the first time in 20 years.

===2007 Rugby World Cup===

Fiji were placed in Pool B of the 2007 Rugby World Cup along with Wales, Canada, Japan and Australia. After beating Japan and Canada in close matches, Fiji rested several key players against Australia for the crucial game against Wales. Australia defeated Fiji by 55–12. Fiji&#x27;s fate in the tournament came down to a &quot;winner advances&quot; game against Wales which Fiji won 38–34 and qualified for the quarter-finals for the second time. Former Wallaby great Michael Lynagh described the see-sawing match as one of the best matches &quot;of all time&quot;. Fiji lost their quarter final match against South Africa, however their above expectations performance in the tournament resulted in them moving up to 9th in the world rankings – their highest ever position at the time. Shannon Fraser and Gregg Mumm from Australia acted as assistant coaches for the period leading up to the world cup and were accredited for much of the Fijians side&#x27;s success.

===2011 Rugby World Cup===

Fiji was placed in Pool D of the 2011 Rugby World Cup along with South Africa, Wales, Samoa and Namibia. Fiji won their first match against Namibia with 49–25. But it could not manage to repeat 2007 World Cup performance. They lost to South Africa, Wales and Samoa with huge margins. Final scores were 3–49 against South Africa, 7–27 against Samoa &amp; 0–66 against Wales.

===2023 Rugby World Cup===
Fiji was placed in Pool C of the 2023 Rugby World Cup along with Georgia, Australia, Wales and Portugal. Fiji played against Wales in their opening match and ultimately lost to Wales with 32-26. The match was highly controversial due to the decisions of referee Matthew Carley, whose decisions attracted many complaints from Fijian fans, former rugby players and former Fiji 7s coach Ben Ryan, this was due to his decision to not give Wales a yellow card on multiple warnings after multiple penalties in their red zone and giving Fiji a yellow card after one offense in the red zone. Fiji then played against Australia on the 18th of September and it was a historic match for the team as Fiji beat Australia 15-22 and this was Fiji&#x27;s first ever victory over Australia since 1954.

==Wins against Tier 1 nations==
Fiji have recorded 18 wins against tier 1 opposition. In addition, Fiji drew with Australia 3-3 on 1 July 1961 at the Olympic Park Stadium, Melbourne, Australia, as well as 16-16 with Wales on 19 November 2010 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, Wales.







==Record==

===World Cup record===

===Pacific Nations Cup===
Fiji previously competed in the Pacific Tri-Nations winning 9 tournaments. The Pacific Nations Cup replaced the Tri-Nations tournament in 2006. Fiji have won seven tournaments. 
==Kit history==
Fiji traditionally plays with a home kit consisting of a white shirt, black shorts and black and white hooped socks. The away kit traditionally used to be a white and black hooped shirt with white shorts and hooped socks, although since KooGa&#x27;s tenure as supplier, colours such as light blue or black were used. Since 2010, some jerseys started to have patterns similar to those found on the masi cloths on the jersey designs.

<doc id="1074621" wikidata="Q497638" url="?curid=1074621" title="Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer">
<text>Unico Wilhelm, Count van Wassenaer Obdam (30 October 1692 – 9 November 1766) was a Dutch nobleman who was a diplomat as well as a composer. He reorganized the Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Order. His most important surviving compositions are the &quot;Concerti Armonici&quot;, which until 1980 had been misattributed to the Italian composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi (1710–1736) and to Carlo Ricciotti (1681–1756).

==Early years==

Van Wassenaer was born into a distinguished family of wealth, power and accomplishment—the House of Wassenaer. His grandfather, Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, was supreme commander of the confederate Dutch navy, and was killed in battle in 1665 in the Second Anglo-Dutch War; his father, Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam (younger), served as a general of the army in the War of the Spanish Succession, but ruined his military reputation in 1703 in the Battle of Ekeren, and spent the rest of his career as a diplomat.

Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer was born in the family castle of Twickel, near Delden, on 30 October 1692, the son of Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam (1645–1714) and Adriana Sophia Raesfelt (died 1694). He grew up in the Hague, where he was taught to play the harpsichord and violin. In 1707-09 he stayed with his father and three sisters in Düsseldorf at the court of Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. The strong Italian influences at the court had a major influence on his musical development.
On 18 September 1710 Unico Wilhelm was admitted to the University of Leiden to study law.
In December 1711 he interrupted his studies to go to Frankfurt for the coronation of the Emperor Charles VI.
In June 1713, after completing his studies, he returned to Düsseldorf where his father and sisters had settled.
He may have accompanied Arent van Wassenaer Duyvenvoorde on a visit to Britain in 1715–16. 
He made a grand tour of France and Italy in 1717–18.

In 1723 Unico Wilhelm married Dodonea Lucia van Goslinga (the daughter of Sicco van Goslinga), with whom he had three children.

==Official positions==

Unico Wilhelm had inherited the estate of Twickel from his father in 1714 and three years later was admitted as a knight of Overijssel.
He lived in this region from 1719 to 1724, when he accepted a position in Holland. 
His older brother Johan Hendrik found him a position as water manager of the Rhineland (1723), counsel to the Admiralty (1724) and governor of the Dutch East India Company (1734). These jobs kept him in and around the Hague. After his brother died in 1745 he moved into the Van Wassenaer house in the Kneuterdijk.
A year later he was admitted into the Dutch knighthood. Unico Wilhelm continued to spend part of his time at Twickel, and in 1726 he had maps made of this property and the rest of his inheritance.

In 1744 Unico Wilhelm was sent on a diplomatic mission to the French court, and in the autumn of 1744 and again in 1745 he was sent to the court of Clemens August, Elector of Cologne. In 1746 he went again to France, and finally in 1746–47 to Breda for further discussions with the French. 
Although clearly intelligent, Unico Wilhelm was not a natural diplomat.
Unico Wilhelm was a commander of the Bailiwick of Utrecht of the Teutonic Order. 
He was made coadjutor in 1753, and introduced administrative and managerial innovations. In 1761 he was made Commander of the order.
He died in The Hague on November 9, 1766.

==Music==

While based at the Hague between 1725 and 1740, Unico Wilhelm wrote the six &quot;Concerti Armonici&quot;.
The &quot;Concerti armonici&quot;, published anonymously in 1740, were printed in London in 1755 as compositions by the violinist and impresario Carlo Ricciotti (c. 1681–1756). It has since been established that these were the work of Unico Wilhelm. There is no evidence that Ricciotti wrote any music. 
The concerti were dedicated to Wilhelm&#x27;s friend, Count Willem Bentinck. The slow movements of the concerti have expressive beauty.

The Polish composer Franciszek Lessel (1780–1838) asserted incorrectly that the &quot;concertos&quot; were written by Pergolesi. Since the style of the &quot;concertos&quot; is Italian, laid out in typical Roman fashion with four parts for violin and consisting of four parts instead of the Venetian three, they are comparable to works by Pietro Locatelli.

However, in 1979–1980 a manuscript of the six &quot;concerti&quot; was found in the archives of Twickel Castle (the castle where Van Wassenaer was born) labeled &quot;Concerti Armonici.&quot; Although the handwriting was not by Van Wassenaer, the manuscript did have an introduction in his hand, reading: &quot;Partition de mes concerts gravez par le Sr. Ricciotti&quot;. Because of the research done by the Dutch musicologist Albert Dunning, there can be no doubt that the &quot;concerti&quot; were, in fact, written by Van Wassenaer.

Dunning quotes the composer&#x27;s Foreword in full--

&quot;Score of my concertos, engraved by Signor Ricciotti. These concertos were composed at different times between 1725 and 1740. When they were ready, I took them along to the musical gathering organized in The Hague by Mr Bentinck, myself and some foreign gentlemen.

Ricciotti played the first violin. Afterwards I allowed him to make a copy of the concertos. When all six were ready, he asked permission to have them engraved. Upon my refusal he enlisted the aid of Mr Bentinck, to whose strong representations I finally acquiesced, on condition that my name did not appear anywhere on the copy and that he put his name to it, as he did. Mr Bentinck wanted to dedicate them to me; I refused absolutely, after which he told Ricciotti to dedicate them to him. In this way these concertos were published against my wishes.

Some of them are tolerable, some middling, others wretched. Had they not been published, I would perhaps have corrected the mistakes in them, but other business has left me no leisure to amuse myself with them, and I would have caused their editor offence.&quot;

&quot;Concerto Armonico&quot; No. 2 in B flat Major (Allegro moderato) was among the works that formed the basis for Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Pulcinella&quot;, Tarantella, based on works considered at the time to be by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi.

Apart from &quot;Concerti Armonici&quot;, three sonatas for recorder and continuo were also discovered in the early 1990s.

<text>Willard Richards (June 24, 1804 – March 11, 1854) was an early leader in the Latter Day Saint movement. He served as second counselor to church president Brigham Young in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1847 until his death.

==Early life==
Willard Richards was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, to Joseph Richards and Rhoda Howe on June 24, 1804. He was the youngest of eleven children. At the age of four, he injured his head in a fall and was left with some residual muscle tremor and paralysis.

As a child, Richards was very inquisitive and would ask questions and read constantly. This was especially the case during the six months the local congregational minister resided in his parents&#x27; household. Because of his tendency to ask questions as to why things were the way they were, he was denied admission to the local congregational church.

As the injury limited his physical activity, he focused his attention on education and obtained a teacher&#x27;s certificate at age sixteen. He taught school in Chatham, New York, and in Lanesborough, Massachusetts. In 1823, he moved to Naussau, New York.

Richards pursued additional studies in physical mechanics and science, and studied the clarinet. At age 27, he became an itinerant lecturer, traveling throughout New England giving lectures on various scientific subjects.

At the age of thirty, after the death of his sister Susan, Richards decided to become a medical doctor. He studied at the Thomson Infirmary in Boston, focusing on medication and herbal preparations. He then settled in Holliston, Massachusetts, where he practiced medicine.

In 1836, Richards was introduced to the newly published Book of Mormon by his cousins, Joseph and Brigham Young. Richards read the book twice within ten days and soon made preparations to move to Kirtland, Ohio, to join the Church of the Latter Day Saints; a bout of &quot;palsy&quot;, however, prevented him from traveling until a year later. Richards was baptized on December 31, 1836, by Brigham Young and ordained an elder on March 6, 1837.

==Early church service==
Shortly following his ordination as an elder, Richards was called on a brief three-month mission to the Eastern United States. Immediately upon his return, he was called on a more extended mission to Great Britain. This put him among the first missionaries of the LDS Church to go to Britain. Richards served a total of four years on his mission to Britain. He helped with the &quot;Millennial Star&quot;&#x27;s publication.

With his high level of education, Richards was often counseled by Heber C. Kimball to focus on the basic tenets of the gospel. Richards was the moving force behind establishing the first branch of the church in Manchester, England. He was appointed first counselor to the president of the European Mission, Joseph Fielding.

==Marriage and family==
Richards married Jennetta Richards on September 24, 1838, while on a four-year mission to England. Their first child, named Heber John, was born on July 17, 1839, but died of smallpox just five months later in October. They had two surviving children, a son, also named Heber John, born in Manchester, England, in 1840, and a daughter, Rhoda Ann Jennetta, born in 1843 in Nauvoo, Illinois. Jennetta Richards was in poor health, and after traveling across the Atlantic Ocean in April 1841, Richards took her to live with his siblings in Richmond, Massachusetts, while he went on to Nauvoo, Illinois.

Richards was a close confidant of Joseph Smith, and became a practitioner of polygamy. There is indication that his first plural wife was 26-year-old Nancy Marinda Johnson Hyde, who was already married to Orson Hyde (Hyde was away on a mission at the time). Richards returned to Richmond and retrieved his wife Jennetta, arriving back in Nauvoo on November 21, 1842.

On January 18, 1843, Richards married sixteen-year-old Sarah Longstroth and fourteen-year-old Nanny Longstroth, who were sisters. Joseph Smith officiated the wedding. Richards married eleven wives in total.

Willard and Jennetta Richards were sealed on May 29, 1843, and were among the first couples to be sealed. After struggling with illness all her life, Jennetta died on July 9, 1845, at age twenty-seven.

==Apostle==
Richards was ordained an apostle on April 14, 1840, by Brigham Young. In 1841, he moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, to be with the body of the church. He was in Warsaw, Illinois, from September to December and did not take up residence in Nauvoo until December 1841. He was in Warsaw on a missionary assignment to found and supervise a settlement of church members there.

Richards was a member of the Nauvoo City Council from 1841 to 1843. He also was a member of the Masonic lodge at Nauvoo. In 1843 he was made recorder of the Nauvoo Municipal Court.

He became Joseph Smith&#x27;s private secretary in December 1841, when he was also made recorder of the Nauvoo Temple. In December 1842, Richards was called to be the Church Historian and Recorder, a position he held until his death. In these two capacities, Richards maintained Smith&#x27;s schedule and recorded most of his activities. As church historian, he subsequently wrote a total of 1,884 pages on the history of Smith. This work was later incorporated into &quot;The History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, edited by B. H. Roberts.

In July 1842, Richards went on a short mission to New England. In 1844, Richards was made the recorder of the Council of 50.

On May 4, 1842, Richards was one of nine men to whom Smith presented the endowment.

Richards was incarcerated in Carthage Jail with Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, and John Taylor on June 27, 1844, when the jail was attacked by a mob and the Smiths were murdered. Taylor was shot four times and severely injured, but survived the attack. Richards was unhurt and so supervised the removal of the bodies of Taylor and the Smiths. Over a year prior to the attack, Joseph Smith had told Richards that &quot;the time would come that the balls would fly around him like hail, and he should see his friends fall on the right and on the left, but that there should not be a hole in his garment.&quot; His first-hand account of the event was published in the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;.

Richards, his cousin Brigham Young, and other church elders left Nauvoo in February 1846, spending the remainder of the year at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. This first group entered into the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. They then went back to Winter Quarters, arriving on August 21, 1847, to gather the families for the Mormon Exodus of 1848.

==First Presidency==
Richards was called as Second Counselor to Brigham Young in the First Presidency on December 27, 1847, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. After moving to Utah, Richards was involved in establishing the &quot;Deseret News&quot;, serving as its first Editor-in-Chief.

In the provisional state of Deseret, Richards served as both secretary and president of the council. Once Utah was organized as a territory, he served as its secretary. He was also postmaster of Salt Lake City.

==Death and legacy==
Richards died in Salt Lake City on March 11, 1854, and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. He was 49 years old. He was described as &quot;calm and even minded&quot; despite his physical challenges.

<text>Louis Edward Caldera (born April 1, 1956) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who served as the director of the White House Military Office from January to May 2009, as the 17th United States Secretary of the Army from July 1998 to January 2001 and as a California State Assemblyman from January 1992 to January 1997.

==Family and education==
The son of Mexican immigrants Soledad and Benjamin Caldera, Caldera was born on April 1, 1956, in El Paso, Texas. His family left Texas for California when he was 4 years old, living briefly in public housing in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles before moving to the suburb of Whittier. Caldera graduated from Monte Vista High School in 1974. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1978 from the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, then served on active duty from 1978 to 1983, mostly at Fort Dix, New Jersey. He went on to enroll at Harvard University and in 1987, earned a joint J.D./M.B.A. degree from Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School respectively.

While studying at Harvard, he met his wife, Eva Orlebeke Caldera; together they have three daughters - Allegra, Sophia, and Camille, all of whom are Harvard undergraduates.

==Law career==
After graduating from Harvard, Caldera practiced law from 1987 to 1990 at O&#x27;Melveny &amp; Myers, then from 1990 to 1991 at Buchalter, Nemer, Fields and Younger. From 1991 to 1992 he was a Deputy Counsel for Los Angeles County.

==California State Assembly==
Caldera served as a California State Assemblyman from 1992 to 1997, representing the nearly 400,000 residents of California&#x27;s 46th State Assembly district, which is located in and around downtown Los Angeles. As an Assemblyman, he served as chairman of the Banking and Finance Committee, the Revenue and Taxation Committee, and the Budget Committee.

==Secretary of the Army==
Before finishing his third term in the Assembly, Caldera resigned to begin serving as managing director and chief operating officer for President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Corporation for National and Community Service (1997–1998), a domestic volunteer program.

On May 22, 1998, Clinton announced Caldera as his selection for Secretary of the Army. On July 2, 1998, Caldera was sworn in as the 17th Secretary of the Army by Secretary of Defense William Cohen.

==Other positions==
He went on to serve as Vice Chancellor for University Advancement in the California State University System, the largest four-year university system in the country.

Caldera became the 18th president of the University of New Mexico (UNM) in August 2003, and left that position in January 2006. Caldera&#x27;s selection was controversial, considering there was a lack of faculty approval prior to his official selection. The UNM General Faculty took a vote on the appointment of Caldera, and 78% voted against his appointment. Many students pointed out that he did not have a PhD, and would be in a position of overseeing PhD candidates. Still, others chose to point out that Caldera had more than a few conflicts of interest as a former Secretary of the Army and as a member of several corporate boards.

Caldera&#x27;s contract with the University granted him an appointment as a tenured member of the University of New Mexico School of Law faculty, despite never having taught a law school course prior to his appointment.

Caldera served on the board of directors of IndyMac Bank from 2002 until its failure, and subsequent seizure by the government, in July 2008.

Caldera served on the board of directors for Southwest Airlines until he submitted his resignation, effective January 15, 2009, in connection with his selection to serve as director of the White House Military Office.

In June 2010 Caldera was appointed to the role of Vice President of Programs for the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, a non-profit organization that has awarded 1,200 scholarships totaling more than $60 million to high-achieving low-income students, and has given more than $46 million in grants to nonprofit organizations that have similar missions. Caldera left the Cooke Foundation in March 2012.

Caldera is now President of &quot;Caldera Associates&quot;, where he &quot;provide(s) consulting services to for-profit and non-profit clients in the national security, education, philanthropic and human services delivery sectors&quot;.

Louis Caldera is a Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Law and a Senior Affiliate in the Program on Law and Government at American University Washington College of Law (WCL). Prior to joining WCL, Caldera taught courses in Legislation and Legislative Process, Election Law/Law of Democracy, State and Local Advocacy, and Corporate Governance at Loyola Law School, The University of New Mexico, and The George Washington University.

== Aircraft photo mission controversy ==

During his tenure as director of the White House Military Office, Caldera approved a mission conducted on April 27, 2009, where a Boeing VC-25 (a Boeing 747 military variant that is denominated Air Force One when the president of the United States is aboard), followed by an F-16 military fighter jet, performed low-altitude fly-overs of New York City and New Jersey. The mission &quot;was set up to create an iconic shot of Air Force One, similar to one that was taken in recent years over the Grand Canyon.&quot;

While the FAA and select local authorities were given some degree of notification in advance, many other officials and the general public were not. The fly-over of the lower Manhattan financial district created a panic. Many feared it was another terrorist attack like the one that destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, or an aborted attack attempt, because of the F-16 following the presidential plane. This led scores of people to leave their desks and large office buildings to be evacuated in a speedy but impromptu fashion.

New York City police stated that &quot;federal authorities&quot; told them not to disclose information about the fly-over to the public in advance. President Obama was also not informed beforehand. Like New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, President Obama only learned of the incident after the disturbance it caused was already being reported by journalists, bloggers, websites and news outlets.

The incident brought intense scrutiny and numerous highly critical comments directed at Caldera. White House officials said President Obama was fuming mad and did not see the need for a new Air Force One publicity photo anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Associated Press/Google&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Bloomberg condemned the low flyover and the failure to provide public notice, saying he himself had not been adequately notified, that he was &quot;furious&quot;, and that it showed &quot;poor judgment&quot;. Senator John McCain stated the flyover photo op was &quot;a fundamentally unsound exercise in military judgment and may have constituted an inappropriate use of Department of Defense resources.&quot; The cost of setting up the flyover photo was reportedly $328,835. Observers noted that an expense like this would have been incurred whether or not the photo shoot had been carried out. VC-25 flying time requirements dictate the need for regular training flights. Had the flyover not been ordered, a similar expense would have been incurred in the normal course of VC-25 flight training.

After meeting with White House officials Caldera issued a public apology for the incident, stating: &quot;&quot;Last week, I approved a mission over New York. I take responsibility for that decision. While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey, it&#x27;s clear that the mission created confusion and disruption. I apologize and take responsibility for any distress that flight caused&quot;.&quot;

Following an investigation into how the decision to conduct the flight had been reached, directed by Deputy White House Chief of Staff Jim Messina, Caldera announced his resignation on May 8, 2009, effective May 22, 2009. Notable in the investigation is Caldera&#x27;s explanation of why he did not read an email from his Deputy Director, George Mulligan: &quot;During our interview, the Director (Caldera) also offered another explanation for his failure to read the email. When he returned from Mexico, he was suffering from severe muscle spasms in his back. Doctors prescribed pain medications, he had difficulty walking around the office, and he went home early a couple days.&quot;

<doc id="1074629" wikidata="Q1134659" url="?curid=1074629" title="Tonga national rugby union team">
<text>The Tonga national rugby union team () represents the Tonga Rugby Union in men&#x27;s international rugby union. The team is nicknamed &quot;ʻIkale Tahi (Sea Eagles)&quot;. Like their Polynesian neighbours, the Tongans start their matches with a traditional challenge – the Sipi Tau. They are members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) along with Fiji and Samoa. The Ikale Tahi achieved a historic 19–14 victory over France in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, but having lost to New Zealand and Canada, were unable to achieve what would have been their first-ever presence at the quarter-finals.

==History==
Rugby was brought to the region in the early 20th century by sailors and missionaries, and the Tonga Rugby Football Union was formed in late 1923. Tonga beat Fiji 9–6 in their first test in 1924 played in the capital Nukualofa. However, Tonga lost the second test 14–3 and drew the decider 0–0.

Between 1924 and 1938 Tonga and Fiji played three test series every alternate year. Matches between the two Pacific nations were hard fought; many have claimed that the ancient feuding wars between the Islanders were transplanted onto the rugby field. Troubles during the third Test of Fiji&#x27;s 1928 tour to Tonga forced the game to be abandoned with Tonga leading 11–8. In 1954 Tonga played host to a touring Western Samoa.

Tonga beat New Zealand Maori in 1969, but had to wait until 1973 before they played their second test match, a 30–12 defeat against Australia in Sydney. They got their revenge when they beat Australia in Ballymore, Brisbane 16–11, scoring four tries to two in June 1973. The following year they traveled to the Arms Park for a non-cap international against Wales, a game that ended in a 26–7 defeat.

The first Tongan tour to Great Britain was in 1974, when they played 10 games, including those in Wales against East Wales, Llanelli, North Wales, Newport, West Wales and a Wales XV. The only tour victory was by 18–13 in the opener against East Wales. The &#x27;tests&#x27; were lost by 44–8 to a Scotland XV and by 26–7 to the Wales XV.

They remained a little-known quantity in Europe until 1986, when Wales embarked on a tour of Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa. Early in the game against Tonga, Welsh flanker Mark Brown was knocked over by three Tongan forwards, leading to a mass brawl involving the entire team except Malcolm Dacey and Mark Titley. Robert Jones describes the event in his book &quot;Raising The Dragon&quot; as &quot;the worst brawl I have ever seen on a rugby field.&quot; At the post-match dinner Jonathan Davies was asked to give a few words in Welsh and as the hosts politely applauded he described them as &quot;the dirtiest team I have ever played against&quot;

Tonga were drawn to play Wales again in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. The previous meeting, plus the decision to rest some of the leading players, led to a poor Welsh performance though they managed to win 29–16. Tonga lost its other two games to Ireland (32–9) and Canada (37–4).

They failed to qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. In 1994 they won the South Pacific championship on try count and so qualified for the Super 10, in which they finished bottom of their pool with only one point.

They qualified for the 1995 World Cup ahead of Fiji on points difference. Tonga managed only two victories in the next two World Cups, against the 29–11 Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 1995 and Italy in 1999. The win over the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire brought tragedy when Ivorian winger Max Brito was left paralyzed.

June 1999 brought a 20–16 defeat of France in Nukualofa over a touring France but in 2000 they were defeated 102–0 (including 15 tries) by New Zealand.

After losing their first four matches to Fiji and Samoa, Tonga finished third in the Oceania qualifying group. As a result, they had to play home and away matches against Papua New Guinea, which they won 47–14 and 84–12, followed by a play-off against South Korea, who finished as runners-up in the Asian section. Tonga thrashed them 75–0 and 119–0.

At the 2003 Rugby World Cup Tonga lost all their games and finished bottom of their pool. Although they kept Wales to 20–27, they were again thrashed by New Zealand 91–7.

In 2007 Tonga participated in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, winning two of their pool matches and nearly defeating the eventual champions, South Africa, before losing 30–25.

Tonga achieved one of the most unexpected victories in Rugby World Cup history with their 19–14 win over France in the 2011 World Cup.

On 24 November 2012, Tonga beat Scotland, at Pittodrie Stadium, 21–15 for their first victory over a traditional rugby power on a European pitch.

==Sipi Tau==

Like several Pacific rugby nations, Tonga has a pre-game war dance, called the Sipi Tau. It is a form of the Kailao, which was originally a war dance that was imported to Tonga from Wallis Island. It is usually performed at both public and private ceremonies.

During the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia, in Tonga&#x27;s match against the All Blacks, the All Blacks began their traditional haka, and then Tonga answered to the haka through the sipi tau whilst the All Blacks were performing, bringing the teams within metres of one another just prior to kick-off.

==Wins against Tier 1 nations==
Tonga have recorded six wins against tier 1 opposition.

Tonga usually wears a home kit consisting of a red shirt, white shorts and red socks and an away kit with the reversed colours. In the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Tonga wore an all-red home kit. Since 2007, Tongan traditional designs, similar to the ones found on the tapa cloths, were incorporated on the jersey design.

Kit manufacturers:

* Tonga wore Samurai Sportswear kits in the matches against Maori All Blacks and Japan in 2008
* Tonga wore kits manufactured by the local brand Aoniu in the 2008 end-of-year international tours.

<doc id="1074631" wikidata="Q511733" url="?curid=1074631" title="Common Security and Defence Policy">
<text>The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is the European Union&#x27;s (EU) course of action in the fields of defence and crisis management, and a main component of the EU&#x27;s Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

The CSDP involves the deployment of military or civilian missions to preserve peace, prevent conflict and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Military missions are carried out by EU forces established with secondments from the member states&#x27; armed forces. The CSDP also entails collective self-defence amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 26 of the 27 national armed forces pursue structural integration. The CSDP structure – headed by the Union&#x27;s High Representative (HR/VP), Kaja Kallas, and sometimes referred to as the European Defence Union (EDU) in relation to its prospective development as the EU&#x27;s defence arm – comprises:

*the European Commission&#x27;s Defence Industry Directorate-General
*the External Action Service&#x27;s (EEAS) Crisis Management and Planning Directorate (CMPD) and permanent Operation Headquarters (OHQs) for command and control (C2) at the military/civilian strategic level, i.e. the MPCC and CPCC.
*a number of Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) preparatory bodies – such as the Military Committee (EUMC)
*four agencies, including the Defence Agency (EDA).

The EU command and control structures are much smaller than the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#x27;s (NATO) Command Structure (NCS), which has been established for territorial defence. It has been agreed that NATO&#x27;s Allied Command Operations (ACO) may be used for the conduct of the EU&#x27;s missions. The MPCC, established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, is the EU&#x27;s first permanent military OHQ. In parallel, the European Defence Fund (EDF, established in 2017) marks the first time the EU budget is used to finance multinational defence projects.

Decisions relating to the CSDP are proposed by the High Representative, adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council, generally requiring unanimity, to be then implemented by the High Representative.

==History==

The post-war period saw several short-lived or ill-fated initiatives for European defence integration intended to protect against potential Soviet or German aggression: The Western Union (WU, also referred to as the Brussels Treaty Organisation, BTO) and the proposed European Defence Community (EDC) were respectively cannibalised by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and rejected by the French Parliament. The largely dormant Western European Union (WEU) succeeded the WU&#x27;s remainder in 1955.

In 1970 the European Political Cooperation (EPC) brought about the European Communities&#x27; (EC) initial foreign policy coordination. Opposition to the addition of security and defence matters to the EPC led to the reactivation of the WEU in 1984 by its member states, which were also EC member states.

European defence integration gained momentum soon after the end of the Cold War, partly as a result of the EC&#x27;s failure to prevent the Yugoslav Wars. In 1992, the WEU was given new tasks, and the following year the Treaty of Maastricht founded the EU and replaced the EPC with the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) pillar. In 1996 NATO agreed to let the WEU develop a so-called European Security and Defence Identity (ESDI). The 1998 St. Malo declaration signalled that the traditionally hesitant United Kingdom was prepared to provide the EU with autonomous defence structures. This facilitated the transformation of the ESDI into the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) in 1999, when it was transferred to the EU. In 2003 the EU deployed its first CSDP missions, and adopted the European Security Strategy identifying common threats and objectives. In 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced the present name, CSDP, while establishing the EEAS, the mutual defence clause and enabling a subset of member states to pursue defence integration within PESCO. In 2011 the WEU, whose tasks had been transferred to the EU, was dissolved. In 2016 a new security strategy was introduced, which along with the Russian annexation of Crimea, the British withdrawal from the EU and the election of Donald Trump as US president have given the CSDP a new impetus.

===Deployments===
The first deployment of European troops under the ESDP, following the 1999 declaration of intent, was in March 2003 in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia). Operation Concordia used NATO assets and was considered a success and replaced by a smaller police mission, EUPOL Proxima, later that year. Since then, there have been other small police, justice and monitoring missions. As well as in the Republic of Macedonia, the EU has maintained its deployment of peacekeepers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of Operation Althea.

Between May and September 2003 EU troops were deployed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during &quot;Operation Artemis&quot; under a mandate given by UN Security Council Resolution 1484 which aimed to prevent further atrocities and violence in the Ituri Conflict and put the DRC&#x27;s peace process back on track. This laid out the &quot;framework nation&quot; system to be used in future deployments. The EU returned to the DRC during July–November 2006 with EUFOR RD Congo, which supported the UN mission there during the country&#x27;s elections.

Geographically, EU missions outside the Balkans and the DRC have taken place in Georgia, Indonesia, Sudan, Palestine, and Ukraine–Moldova. There is also a judicial mission in Iraq (EUJUST Lex). On 28 January 2008, the EU deployed its largest and most multi-national mission to Africa, EUFOR Tchad/RCA. The UN-mandated mission involves troops from 25 EU states (19 in the field) deployed in areas of eastern Chad and the north-eastern Central African Republic in order to improve security in those regions. EUFOR Tchad/RCA reached full operation capability in mid-September 2008, and handed over security duties to the UN (MINURCAT mission) in mid-March 2009.

The EU launched its first maritime CSDP operation on 12 December 2008 (Operation Atalanta). The concept of the European Union Naval Force (EU NAVFOR) was created on the back of this operation, which is still successfully combatting piracy off the coast of Somalia almost a decade later. A second such intervention was launched in 2015 to tackle migration problems in the southern Mediterranean (EUNAVFOR Med), working under the name Operation SOPHIA.

Most of the CSDP missions deployed so far are mandated to support security sector reforms (SSR) in host-states. One of the core principles of CSDP support to SSR is local ownership. The EU Council defines ownership as &quot;the appropriation by the local authorities of the commonly agreed objectives and principles&quot;. Despite EU&#x27;s strong rhetorical attachment to the local ownership principle, research shows that CSDP missions continue to be an externally driven, top-down and supply-driven endeavour, resulting often in the low degree of local participation.

==Structure==

The CSDP involves military or civilian missions being deployed to preserve peace, prevent conflict and strengthen international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter. Military missions are carried out by EU forces established with contributions from the member states&#x27; armed forces. The CSDP also entails collective self-defence amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 26 of the 27 national armed forces pursue structural integration. The CSDP structure, headed by the Union&#x27;s High Representative (HR/VP), Kaja Kallas, comprises:
*the Defence Industry Directorate-General of the European Commission
*relevant sections of the External Action Service (EEAS) — including the Military Staff (EUMS) with its so-called Military Planning and Conduct Capability (MPCC)
*a number of Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) preparatory bodies – such as the Military Committee (EUMC)
*four agencies, including the European Defence Agency (EDA).

While the EU has a command and control (C2) structure, it has no standing permanent military structure along the lines of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#x27;s (NATO) Allied Command Operations (ACO), although it has been agreed that ACO resources may be used for the conduct of the EU&#x27;s CSDP missions. The MPCC, established in 2017 and to be strengthened in 2020, does however represent the EU&#x27;s first step in developing a permanent military headquarters. In parallel, the newly established European Defence Fund (EDF) marks the first time the EU budget is used to finance multinational defence projects. The CSDP structure is sometimes referred to as the European Defence Union (EDU), especially in relation to its prospective development as the EU&#x27;s defence arm.

Decisions relating to the CSDP are proposed by the HR/VP, adopted by the FAC, generally requiring unanimity, and then implemented by the HR/VP.

==Strategy==

The European Union Global Strategy (EUGS) is the updated doctrine of the EU to improve the effectiveness of the CSDP, including the defence and security of the members states, the protection of civilians, cooperation between the member states&#x27; armed forces, management of immigration, crises etc. Adopted on 28 June 2016, it replaces the European Security Strategy of 2003. The EUGS is complemented by a document titled &quot;Implementation Plan on Security and Defense&quot; (IPSD).
Deterrence theory is applied to deter aggressors as one of the core mandates of Common Security and Defence Policy, yet lacks credibility due to insufficient resources.

==Forces==

A new Action Plan on military mobility and cyber resilience was released 10 November 2022.

===National===

The CSDP is implemented using civilian and military contributions from member states&#x27; armed forces, which also are obliged to collective self-defence based on Treaty on European Union (TEU).

Five EU states host nuclear weapons: France has its own nuclear programmes, while Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands host US nuclear weapons as part of NATO&#x27;s nuclear sharing policy. Combined, the EU possesses 300 warheads, and hosts between 90 and 130 US warheads. Italy hosts 70-90 B61 nuclear bombs, while Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands 10-20 each one. The EU has the third largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, after the United States and Russia.

====Expenditure and personnel====
The following table presents the military expenditures of the members of the European Union in euros (€). The combined military expenditure of the member states amounted to €223.4 billion in 2018. This represents 1.4% of European Union GDP. European military expenditure includes spending on joint projects such as the Eurofighter Typhoon and joint procurement of equipment. The European Union&#x27;s combined active military forces in 2016 totaled 1,410,626 personnel.

In a speech in 2012, Swedish General Håkan Syrén criticised the spending levels of European Union countries, saying that in the future those countries&#x27; military capability will decrease, creating &quot;critical shortfalls&quot;.

Guide to table:
* All figure entries in the table below are provided by the European Defence Agency for the year 2017, except for Germany&#x27;s personnel figure, which is for 2016. Figures from other sources are not included.
* The &quot;operations &amp; maintenance expenditure&quot; category may in some circumstances also include finances on-top of the nations defence budget.
* The categories &quot;troops prepared for deployed operations&quot; and &quot;troops prepared for deployed and sustained operation&quot; only include land force personnel.

====Naval forces====


The combined component strength of the naval forces of member states is some 514 commissioned warships. Of those in service, 4 are fleet carriers. The EU also has 4 amphibious assault ships and 20 amphibious support ships in service. Of the EU&#x27;s 49 submarines, 10 are nuclear-powered submarines while 39 are conventional attack submarines.

Operation Atalanta (formally European Union Naval Force Somalia) is the first ever (and still ongoing) naval operation of the European Union. It is part of a larger global action by the EU in the Horn of Africa to deal with the Somali crisis. As of January 2011, twenty-three EU nations participate in the operation.

France and Italy have blue-water navies.

Guide to table:
* Ceremonial vessels, research vessels, supply vessels, training vessels, and icebreakers are not included.
* The table only counts warships that are commissioned (or equivalent) and active.
* Surface vessels displacing less than 200 tonnes are not included, regardless of other characteristics.
* The &quot;amphibious support ship&quot; category includes amphibious transport docks and dock landing ships, and tank landing ships.
* Frigates over 6,000 tonnes are classified as destroyers.
* The &quot;patrol vessel&quot; category includes missile boats.
* The &quot;anti-mine ship&quot; category includes mine countermeasures vessels, minesweepers and minehunters.
* Generally, total tonnage of ships is more important than total number of ships, as it gives a better indication of capability.

====Land forces====

Combined, the member states of the European Union maintain large numbers of various land-based military vehicles and weaponry.

Guide to table:
* The table is not exhaustive and primarily includes vehicles and EU-NATO member countries under the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE treaty). Unless otherwise specified.
* The CFE treaty only includes vehicles stationed within Europe, vehicles overseas on operations are not counted.
* The &quot;main battle tank&quot; category also includes tank destroyers (such as the Italian B1 Centauro) or any self-propelled armoured fighting vehicle, capable of heavy firepower. According to the CFE treaty.
* The &quot;armoured fighting vehicle&quot; category includes any armoured vehicle primarily designed to transport infantry and equipped with an automatic cannon of at least 20 mm calibre. According to the CFE treaty.
* The &quot;artillery&quot; category includes self-propelled or towed howitzers and mortars of 100 mm calibre and above. Other types of artillery are not included regardless of characteristics. According to the CFE treaty.
* The &quot;attack helicopter&quot; category includes any rotary wing aircraft armed and equipped to engage targets or equipped to perform other military functions (such as the Apache or the Wildcat). According to the CFE treaty.
* The &quot;military logistics vehicle&quot; category includes logistics trucks of 4-tonne, 8-tonne, 14-tonne or larger, purposely designed for military tasking. Not under CFE treaty.

====Air forces====
The air forces of EU member states operate a wide range of military systems and hardware. This is primarily due to the independent requirements of each member state and also the national defence industries of some member states. However such programmes like the Eurofighter Typhoon and Eurocopter Tiger have seen many European nations design, build and operate a single weapons platform. 60% of overall combat fleet was developed and manufactured by member states, 32% are US-origin, but some of these were assembled in Europe, while remaining 8% are soviet-made aircraft. As of 2014, it is estimated that the European Union had around 2,000 serviceable combat aircraft (fighter aircraft and ground-attack aircraft).

The EUs air-lift capabilities are evolving with the future introduction of the Airbus A400M (another example of EU defence cooperation). The A400M is a tactical airlifter with strategic capabilities. Around 140 are initially expected to be operated by 5 member states (Luxembourg, France, Germany, Spain and Belgium).

Guide to tables:
* The tables are sourced from figures provided by Flight International for the year 2020.
* Aircraft are grouped into three main types (indicated by colours): red&lt;/span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt; for combat aircraft, green&lt;/span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt; for aerial refueling aircraft, and yellow&lt;/span style=&quot;color:#f3f781&quot;&gt; for strategic and tactical transport aircraft.
* The two &quot;other&quot; columns include additional aircraft according to their type sorted by colour (i.e. the &quot;other&quot; category in red includes combat aircraft, while the &quot;other&quot; category in grey includes both aerial refueling and transport aircraft). This was done because it was not feasible allocate every aircraft type its own column.
* Other aircraft such as trainers, helicopters, UAVs and reconnaissance or surveillance aircraft are not included in the below tables or figures.

====Established at Union level====

The Helsinki Headline Goal Catalogue is a listing of rapid reaction forces composed of 60,000 troops managed by the European Union, but under control of the countries who deliver troops for it.

Forces introduced at Union level include:
*The battle groups (BG) adhere to the CSDP, and are based on contributions from a coalition of member states. Each of the eighteen Battlegroups consists of a battalion-sized force (1,500 troops) reinforced with combat support elements. The groups rotate actively, so that two are ready for deployment at all times. The forces are under the direct control of the Council of the European Union. The Battlegroups reached full operational capacity on 1 January 2007, although, as of January 2013 they are yet to see any military action. They are based on existing &quot;ad hoc&quot; missions that the European Union (EU) has undertaken and has been described by some as a new &quot;standing army&quot; for Europe. The troops and equipment are drawn from the EU member states under a &quot;lead nation&quot;. In 2004, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the plans and emphasised the value and importance of the Battlegroups in helping the UN deal with troublespots.
*The Medical Command (EMC) is a planned medical command centre in support of EU missions, formed as part of the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). The EMC will provide the EU with a permanent medical capability to support operations abroad, including medical resources and a rapidly deployable medical task force. The EMC will also provide medical evacuation facilities, triage and resuscitation, treatment and holding of patients until they can be returned to duty, and emergency dental treatment. It will also contribute to harmonising medical standards, certification and legal (civil) framework conditions.
*The Force Crisis Response Operation Core (EUFOR CROC) is a flagship defence project under development as part of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). EURFOR CROC will contribute to the creation of a &quot;full spectrum force package&quot; to speed up provision of military forces and the EU&#x27;s crisis management capabilities. Rather than creating a standing force, the project involves creating a concrete catalogue of military force elements that would speed up the establishment of a force when the EU decides to launch an operation. It is land-focused and aims to generate a force of 60,000 troops from the contributing states alone. While it does not establish any form of &quot;European army&quot;, it foresees an deployable, interoperable force under a single command. Germany is the lead country for the project, but the French are heavily involved and it is tied to President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s proposal to create a standing intervention force. The French see it as an example of what PESCO is about.

====Provided through Article 42.3 TEU====
This section presents an incomplete list of forces and bodies established intergovernmentally amongst a subset of member states. These organisations will deploy forces based on the collective agreement of their member states. They are typically technically listed as being able to be deployed under the auspices of NATO, the United Nations, the European Union (EU) through Article 42.3 of TEU, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, or any other international entity.

However, with the exception of the Eurocorps, very few have actually been deployed for any real military operation, and none under the CSDP at any point in its history.

Land Forces:
*The Eurocorps is an army corps of approximately 1,000 soldiers stationed in Strasbourg, France. Based in the French city of Strasbourg, the corps is the nucleus of the Franco-German Brigade.
*The I. German/Dutch Corps is a multinational formation consisting of units from the Dutch and German armies. Due to its role as a NATO High Readiness Forces Headquarters, soldiers from other NATO member states, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom amongst others, are also stationed at Münster.
* The Multinational Corps Northeast, a Danish-German-Polish multinational corps
* The European Gendarmerie Force, an intervention force with militarised police functions which specializes in crisis management.

Aerial:
*The European Air Transport Command exercises operational control of the majority of the aerial refueling capabilities and military transport fleets of its participating nations. Located at Eindhoven Airbase in the Netherlands, the command also bears a limited responsibility for exercises, aircrew training and the harmonisation of relevant national air transport regulations. The command was established in 2010 to provide a more efficient management of the participating nations&#x27; assets and resources in this field.

Naval:
*The European Maritime Force (EUROMARFOR or EMF) is a non-standing, military force that may carry out naval, air and amphibious operations, with an activation time of 5 days after an order is received. The force was formed in 1995 to fulfill missions defined in the Petersberg Declaration, such as sea control, humanitarian missions, peacekeeping operations, crisis response operations, and peace enforcement.

==Participation, relationship with NATO==

Out of the 27 EU member states, 23 are also members of NATO. Another four NATO members are EU applicants—Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Turkey. Two others—Iceland and Norway—have opted to remain outside of the EU, however participate in the EU&#x27;s single market. The memberships of the EU and NATO are distinct, and some EU member states are traditionally neutral on defence issues. Several EU member states were formerly members of the Warsaw Pact. Denmark had an opt-out from the CSDP, however voted in a referendum in 2022 to begin to participate in the policy area.
The Berlin Plus agreement is the short title of a comprehensive package of agreements made between NATO and the EU on 16 December 2002. These agreements were based on conclusions of NATO&#x27;s 1999 Washington summit, sometimes referred to as the &quot;CJTF mechanism&quot;, and allowed the EU to draw on some of NATO&#x27;s military assets in its own peacekeeping operations.


==EUCAP Somalia==
The EUCAP Somalia is an example of an unarmed, non-executive, civilian Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) Mission. aimed at strengthening maritime security capacities, police sector, as well as promoting the Rule of Law in Somalia. It provides strategic level advice, mentoring and training, on issues ranging from coast guard and police functions to police-prosecution cooperation and the drafting of laws. Initially launched as EUCAP Nestor in 2012, the mission was reconfigured to focus on Somalia, thus renamed by the Council of the European Union, EUCAP Somalia in 2016.

In December 2024, the Council of European Union extended the Mission’s mandate to February 2027.

The most prominent goals of the Mission are to help Somalia to generate well trained police forces in line with the Somali Transition Plan, contribute to secure one of the EU’s vital maritime trade routes, and assist to draft and implement sound legislative frameworks, including accountability systems. 

=== Background ===
The mission was established in response to the persistent challenges posed by maritime insecurity in the Western Indian Ocean, particularly piracy, illegal fishing, human trafficking, and arms smuggling. These issues severely impacted both the security and economic stability of Somalia and the surrounding region. Somalia’s extensive coastline (the longest in mainland Africa) was unprotected for years due to the collapse of the government in the early 1990s. Piracy flourished in the absence of effective maritime governance, leading to international efforts to assist the country in reclaiming control over its waters. EUCAP Somalia emerged as part of these efforts, complementing other international missions such as Operation Atalanta and EUTM Somalia.

=== Mandates ===

==== From 2012 to 2016 ====
EUCAP Nestor&#x27;s mandate is divided into two objectives: strengthening the maritime capacities of the beneficiary countries (excluding Somalia) and training a coastal police force and judges in Somalia, the primary aim being to get the countries in the region to work together to strengthen action at sea. EUCAP Nestor operates in five countries: Djibouti, Kenya, Seychelles, Somalia (Puntland/Somaliland) and Tanzania. This is why it is relatively large in terms of staff numbers, with almost 200 people spread across the different countries. These experts provide legal, strategic and operational advice on maritime safety.

==== From 2016 to 2021 ====
When the name was changed in December 2016, so too was the mandate. EUCAP Somalia will drop its regional ambitions and focus solely on Somalia, and more specifically on the Coast Guard, with a view to strengthening ‘Somali maritime law enforcement capabilities’. The mandate is not limited to piracy, but covers any criminal activity or offence committed on the coast or in the sea.

==== From 2021 to 2024 ====
In December 2020, the Council of the European Union extended EUCAP&#x27;s mandate until 31 December 2024. From 2021 onwards, the mission will also be helping Somalia to strengthen its police capabilities, in particular by developing the Federal Darwish police force and reinforcing the INTERPOL National Central Bureau in Mogadishu. The EU&#x27;s budget for the period 2023-2024 allocated is 81 million €.

Current mandate from 2025 to 2027

In December 2024, the Council of European Union extended the Mission’s mandate to February 2027. EUCAP Somalia is tasked to advise, train, and equip the Somali Police Force and to support the development of a legal framework for Somalia’s internal security architecture. The mission’s work also includes providing monitoring support to regional maritime police forces, including the Somaliland and Puntland Maritime Police Forces, to bolster maritime law enforcement and security. The Mission’s budget for its current mandate is €110 million and total staff of 169 members.

=== Three pillars of EUCAP Somalia ===

# Support the development of Somali Police Forces by enhancing their capabilities through advising, training and equipping Somali Police Forces in line with the Somali Security Sector Development Plan, ensuring the police are better prepared to maintain security and stability across the country.
# Strengthen Maritime Police Capacities in and around the three main Somali ports (Mogadishu, Berbera and Bossaso) by providing capacity building on coast guard functions.
# Promote the rule of law by working with Somali authorities to enhance accountability within the police force and across the criminal justice chain. This includes supporting the development of legal frameworks necessary for the effective functioning of law enforcement, and security actors in both land and maritime domains, fostering governance and accountability.

=== Achievements ===
Since its reconfiguration in 2016, EUCAP Somalia has made significant strides in enhancing Somalia’s maritime security capabilities. Recent achievements include improving the Somali Police Force&#x27;s (SPF) command, control, and communication capabilities, as well as enhancing their ability to manage security incidents in Mogadishu. EUCAP has deployed a specialized multinational team to support the SPF&#x27;s Maritime Police Unit and has played a key role in the development of Somaliland’s Coast Guard, conducting joint exercises with EUNAVFOR Operation ATALANTA. The mission also trained and equipped the Puntland Maritime Police Force, enhancing their capacity to enforce maritime law. Additionally, EUCAP has supported the Somali Attorney General’s Maritime Crimes Unit by providing training in internal procedures and investigations and launching an internship program for young lawyers. Despite the progress, Somalia continues to face challenges in maritime governance due to political instability and resource limitations, but EUCAP remains committed to addressing these issues with Somali authorities and international partners.

<text>Wczele is a Polish coat of arms. It was used by several szlachta families in the times of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==

This coat of arms was passed down from the Silesian Bernard Pretficz (Bernard Pretwicz, Pretwic). He was born in 1500 and was one of the few Silesians to have an elevated position under the Polish King. He became a Polish National Hero due to his success in driving the Tartars (Crimean Muslims) out of Poland, and what is now Ukraine. This is the Prittwitz coat of arms. The story is that his ancestor was taken by a North African King. The King told him that if he was able to beat his daughter in chess he would be set free, if he lost he would be killed. The Prittwitz won and was told that he could take the life of the King&#x27;s daughter. Instead he cut off her arms so that she could no longer play chess (in other variants of this story, he simply hit her in the head with the chess board so hard that it broke, „Wczele” is similar to Polish „w czoło”, meaning „in the forehead”)

<doc id="1074647" wikidata="Q1321785" url="?curid=1074647" title="Phoenix (manga)">
<text>is an unfinished manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka. Tezuka considered &quot;Phoenix&quot; his &quot;life&#x27;s work&quot;; it consists of 12 parts, each of which tells a separate, self-contained story and takes place in a different era. The plots go back and forth from the remote future to prehistoric times. The story was never completed, having been cut short by Tezuka&#x27;s death in 1989.

Several of the stories have been adapted into anime and a live-action film, along with a musical production by the Takarazuka Revue. As of 2008, the entire manga series is available in English-language translations.

==Overview==
&quot;Phoenix&quot; is about reincarnation. Each story generally involves a search for immortality, embodied by the blood of the eponymous bird of fire, which, as drawn by Tezuka, resembles the &quot;Fenghuang&quot;. The blood is believed to grant eternal life, but immortality in &quot;Phoenix&quot; is either unobtainable or a terrible curse, whereas Buddhist-style reincarnation is presented as the natural path of life. The stories spring back and forth through time; the first, &quot;Dawn&quot;, takes place in ancient times, and the second, &quot;Future&quot;, takes place in the far future. Subsequent stories alternate between the past and future, allowing Tezuka to explore his themes in both historical and science fiction settings. Throughout the stories there are various recurring characters, some from Tezuka&#x27;s famous star system. A character named Saruta appears repeatedly, for example, in the form of various ancestors and descendants, all of whom endure harsh trials in their respective eras.

Tezuka began work on a preliminary version of &quot;Phoenix&quot; in 1954, and the series continued in various forms until his death in 1989. As it progresses, the stories seemed to be converging on the present day. Due to Tezuka dying before the manga&#x27;s completion, it is not known how this would have played out. Scholar and translator Frederik L. Schodt, who knew Tezuka in life, wrote that he fantasized about a secret ending, &quot;waiting in a safe somewhere to be revealed posthumously&quot;. This was not the case, and Tezuka&#x27;s final intentions with &quot;Phoenix&quot; remain unknown; its episodic nature leaves each volume highly accessible nonetheless. Many of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; stories feature an intensely experimental layout and visual design. For example, &quot;Universe&quot; tells the story of four spacefarers who are forced to leave their spaceship in separate escape pods. The panels of the story are organized such that each character has his own vertical or horizontal tier on the page, emphasizing the astronauts&#x27; isolation; the tiers combine and separate as characters join and split up. In an astonishing sequence after one character&#x27;s death, he is represented for a number of pages by a series of empty black panels.

Tezuka was said to have been influenced to create the series after listening to the music of Igor Stravinsky. He also told that he created the image of Phoenix as he was impressed by the Firebird in director Ivan Ivanov-Vano&#x27;s animation film &quot;Konyok Gorbunok&quot; (Soyuzmultfilm studio).

==Arcs==
After several aborted attempts at a first chapter in the 1950s published in the magazines &quot;Manga Shōnen and Shōjo Club&quot;, Tezuka began &quot;Dawn&quot; in 1967, serialized in &quot;COM&quot;. The serialization of &quot;Phoenix&quot; would continue throughout his career, moving to &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot; after &quot;COM&quot;&#x27;s closure in the mid-70s. The final volume, &quot;Sun&quot;, was serialized in &quot;The Wild Age&quot;.
:The first volume, originally serialized in 1967. This story takes place in 240–70 AD, in the era of Queen Himiko of the Yamatai. Using her army, led by feudal general Sarutahiko, to invade the Kumaso, she seeks the Phoenix and eternal youth.

:The second volume, originally serialized in 1967–68. In &quot;Phoenix&quot;″s chronology, this is the final story chronologically, taking place near the end of mankind. In 3404, the world has become super-modernized, but humanity has reached its peak and shows decline. A young man named Masato Yamanobe is living with his girlfriend, Tamami, a shapeshifting alien. Pursued by Masato&#x27;s boss, Rock, they eventually take shelter at the isolated base of mad scientist Dr. Saruta, who attempts to preserve life on Earth with the assistance of his robot, Robita. Eventually, nuclear war breaks out.
:The third volume, originally serialized in 1968–69. This story takes place in 320–50 (Kofun period), and is based on the &quot;Yamato-takeru-no-mikoto&quot; legend. The decadent king of Yamato is trying to have his own version of Japan&#x27;s history written. Meanwhile, a &quot;barbarian&quot; tribe, the Kumaso, is writing an unbiased history. The king of Yamato sends his youngest son, Oguna, to murder the barbarian chief, Takeru. On his journey, Oguna encounters the Phoenix.
:The fourth volume, originally serialized in 1969; also known as &quot;Space&quot;. The story takes place in 2577 AD, where four astronauts must escape their ruined spaceship in escape pods. The survivors eventually crash into a mysterious planet. Among them is Saruta, who contends with Makimura for the heart of their female companion, Nana. On this strange planet, they eventually meet the Phoenix.
:The fifth volume, originally serialized in 1969–1970. The story occurs in 720–752 AD, the period in which the Daibutsu of Tōdai-ji was built during the Nara period. One-eyed and one-armed young man Gao, an ancestor of Saruta, turns into a murderous bandit when he is rejected by his village. He attacks a sculptor, Akanemaru, and the two men&#x27;s paths diverge, but their fates remain linked. Akanemaru becomes obsessed with the Phoenix to the point that he loses sight of his original dreams, while Gao eventually finds a state of grace despite his continuing hardships. &quot;Karma&quot; is widely considered the masterpiece of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; series. MSX and Famicom video games, both developed by Konami, were based on this volume.
:The sixth volume, originally serialized in 1970–1971. The story takes place in 2482–3344 AD. In an age of robotics, technology and science, young Leon dies in a car accident. He is returned to life by scientific surgery, but his now mostly-artificial brain makes him see living things – including humans – as distorted clay figures, while he sees machines and robots as beauties. Leon falls in love with a worker robot, Chihiro, whom he sees as a beautiful girl, and would fight for this forbidden love. A side plot features the robot Robita, who previously appeared in &quot;Future&quot;.
:Serialized in &quot;COM&quot;, 1971. Published in English by Viz as an appendix to the second volume of &quot;Civil War&quot; (&quot;Turbulent Times&quot;). Based on the story of the Hagoromo.
:Published in &quot;Manga Shōnen (Asahi Sononorama)&quot;, 1976–1978. A science fiction epic about the rise and fall of civilization on the deceptively named desert planet of Eden and one boy&#x27;s universe-spanning search for the planet of his ancestors: Earth. Features numerous cameos from other Science fiction-based Phoenix stories, including the shapeshifting alien &quot;Moopies&quot; first seen in &quot;Future&quot;, Makimura from &quot;Universe&quot; and an early model of the Chihiro robot from &quot;Resurrection&quot;. Black Jack also made an appearance here, under a different name.
:Published in &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot;, 1978–1980. The story is about a woodcutter named Benta and his childhood sweetheart, Obu, who are separated and caught up in the events of the Genpei War. Various historical figures, such as Taira no Kiyomori, appear as major and minor characters. Although the character of Gao (from &quot;Ho-ō&quot;) appears as a 400-year-old hermit and thus links &quot;Ranse-hen&quot; to the rest of the series, this particular arc stands out for its much more naturalistic approach, with next to no fantasy elements in it (except for those used for comedic effect, such as telephones in the 12th century). The Viz (English) edition is entitled &quot;Civil War&quot; and is split into two volumes, with &quot;Robe of Feathers&quot; included as an appendix to the second volume.
:Published in &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot;, 1980. A TV producer who attempts to procure human clones to use in a &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot;-style reality TV program learns the error of his ways when he is mistaken for a clone himself. This episode is notable for only featuring the Phoenix in flashbacks and also for introducing her half-human daughter who does not appear again after this episode.
:Published in &quot;Manga Shōnen&quot;, 1981. The story of a female Buddhist nun (bhikkhuni) who is imprisoned in a time-warp by the Phoenix as punishment for her sins along with her faithful retainer and is forced to become a healer treating the victims of wars from all over time and space including humans, youkai and various extraterrestrials. This chapter was loosely based on the Hyakki Yakō emakimono by the famous Japanese artist Tosa Mitsunobu (although in the context of the story it&#x27;s the complete opposite).
:Published in &quot;The Wild Age&quot;, 1986–88. This is the longest story, and was the final volume completed before Tezuka&#x27;s death. It centers on Harima, a young Korean soldier from the Baekje Kingdom whose head is replaced with that of a wolf by Tang dynasty soldiers following the defeat of the joint Baekje-Yamato force at the Battle of Baekgang. He then escapes to Japan where he becomes the feudal lord Inugami and becomes caught in the middle of the Jinshin War, as well as joining a greater battle between supernatural forces and time-travelling to a bleak future world ruled by a theocracy that claimed to have captured the Phoenix. This chapter stands in stark contrast to the earlier historical Phoenix stories, which tended to de-mythologize the mythical characters therein, for instance in &quot;Dawn&quot;, many Shinto gods are portrayed as mere humans. In this chapter, however, a wide variety of mythical creatures are shown fighting against Bodhisattva.

==Publication==
===English edition===
&quot;Phoenix&quot; is currently published in English by Viz Communications. Although the second volume was initially published by the now defunct Pulp manga anthology in a larger edition, in 2002, Viz took over the rest of the manga series, and re-released the second volume. Frederik Schodt, Jared Cook, Shinji Sakamoto, and Midori Ueda, members of a Tokyo group called &quot;Dadakai&quot;, had already translated the first five volumes of the series around 1977/78, but after handing these translation to Tezuka Productions, they collected dust for nearly twenty-five years. Finally, Schodt and Cook finished translating the rest of the series and Viz published the entire series in English, starting in 2002 and completing it in March 2008. It has been criticized for being a dumbing-down, including overlapping artwork with unnecessary new narration, and altering character names (such as Sarutahiko to Saruta) to make their reincarnations more obvious to the reader. However, Tezuka was known to update his manga every few years, so the U.S. version could reflect the last known edition of the series.

The Viz editions are released &quot;flipped&quot; (the original right-to-left orientation is reversed for easier reading in English). Some of the shorter stories have been consolidated into one book (based on the Japanese publication), and &quot;Troubled Times&quot; has been split across two; this resulted in each Viz book having a similar page count. While many of the actual Viz books are out of print, they became available again through digital purchase on Kindle. Viz later offered the digital version of &quot;Phoenix&quot; manga in 2014.

==Adaptations==
===Live-action film===
A live-action film entitled &quot;Phoenix&quot;, based on the &quot;Dawn&quot; storyline, directed by Kon Ichikawa and including some animated sequences directed by Tezuka, was released in 1978. The cast included Tomisaburo Wakayama and Tatsuya Nakadai. It was released in the United States on VHS by Video Action under the cover title &quot;The Phoenix (Hinotori)&quot; in 1982, using a subtitled print, letterboxed only in the split-screen sequence. To date, the film is available on DVD only in Spain, where it is titled &quot;Fénix&quot;. The film included a brief appearance by Astro Boy, substituting for another character to illustrate his attempts to get on a horse. The score was co-composed by Michel Legrand and Jun Fukamachi.

===Anime===
Most volumes of &quot;Phoenix&quot; were adapted into anime. The best-known feature film, &quot;Phoenix 2772&quot;, loosely adapts elements from various &quot;Phoenix&quot; volumes and other Tezuka works into a complete whole cloth scenario. A second animated feature, &quot;Phoenix: Karma Chapter&quot; was released on December 20, 1986, and was later succeeded by two sequel OVAs, &quot;Yamato Chapter&quot; and &quot;Space Chapter&quot;, in 1987.

A 13-episode anime television series aired in 2004 in Japan, and was released in English in October 2007 by Anime Works. The anime premiered in Jamaica on CVM Television in June 2017. A short film by the same staff as the TV series, &quot;Phoenix: Robe of Feathers&quot;, was released on July 17, 2004.

Dōgo Onsen hot spring bathhouse released a three-episode net anime collaboration with &quot;Phoenix&quot; in 2019–2020.

A four-episode anime ONA adaptation by Studio 4°C, titled &quot;Phoenix: Eden17&quot;, premiered worldwide on Disney+ (U.S. on Hulu) on September 13, 2023. It was directed by Shōjirō Nishimi, with character designs and animations handled by Tatsuzou Nishida, Eiko Tanaka serving as producer, and Katsunari Mano and Saku Konohana writing the series&#x27; scripts. A film version with a different ending, &quot;Phoenix: Reminiscence of Flower&quot;, premiered in Japanese theaters on November 3 of the same year.

===Video games===
In 1987, Konami adapted the &quot;Karma&quot; arc to the MSX2 computer and the Famicom game console. Despite being based on the same material, they are completely different games (a vertical shoot &#x27;em up and a horizontal platformer, respectively) produced by separate teams.

The Phoenix also made a cameo appearance in the 2003 &quot;Astro Boy&quot; series and 2004 &quot;Astro Boy: Omega Factor&quot; game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance, along with a number of other Tezuka characters.

* &quot;Hi no Tori Hououhen&quot; (1987, MSX2)
* &quot;Hi no Tori Hououhen: Gaou no Bouken&quot; (1987, Famicom)
* &quot;Black Jack Hinotorihen&quot; (2006, Nintendo DS)
* &quot;DS de Yomu Series: Tezuka Osamu Hi no Tori 1&quot; (2008, Nintendo DS)
* &quot;DS de Yomu Series: Tezuka Osamu Hi no Tori 2&quot; (2008, Nintendo DS)
* &quot;DS de Yomu Series: Tezuka Osamu Hi no Tori 3&quot; (2008, Nintendo DS)

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Phoenix&quot; is considered one of the greatest manga of all time, and is often ranked as one of Tezuka&#x27;s greatest manga. In 2006, &quot;Phoenix&quot; ranked 1st in the Japan Media Arts Festival&#x27;s special &#x27;professionals&#x27; ranking (consisting of critics, editors, people working in the industry, etc.) for the greatest manga of all time, which it held to mark its 10th anniversary. In a 2009 poll held by Asahi Shimbun for &#x27;Greatest Shōwa Manga&#x27;, &quot;Phoenix&quot; ranked 12th, the 3rd highest Tezuka manga behind &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Black Jack&quot;.

Mangaka Naoki Urasawa has spoken about how the first time he read &quot;Phoenix&quot; he was shocked that a work of this quality existed, and that since reading it, he has never been as significantly impacted by anything since, so much so that he would mark it as the moment he became an adult. Comic magazine editor Martin Skidmore called it a &#x27;real contender for comics’ greatest work of any kind&#x27;. The Japan Times has referred to it as &#x27;Japanese pop culture at its zenith&#x27;, stating that it draws critical comparisons to &#x27;everything from Shakespearean tragedy to early Walt Disney&#x27;. In an interview, mangaka Hitoshi Iwaaki named it among his favorite manga. In her book &quot;&#x27;The Art of Osamu Tezuka: God of Manga&quot;&#x27;, Helen McCarthy says it has &#x27;a strong claim to be considered a contemporary equivalent of Wagner’s Ring cycle&#x27;. IGN, in their review of Vol. 10, stated &#x27;You&#x27;ve read &quot;nothing&quot; like this, and it&#x27;s doubtful you ever will again.&#x27;

The titular Phoenix is considered an icon of manga, and a sculpture of the character is featured as a prominent permanent exhibition in the Kyoto International Manga Museum. A statute of the Phoenix is also featured outside the Osamu Tezuka Manga Museum.

The Resurrection arc of &quot;Phoenix&quot; inspired the lyrical theme of the 2018 song &quot;M.D.O.&quot; by heavy metal band Lovebites. In celebration of what would have been Tezuka&#x27;s 90th birthday, Evil Line Records released the compilation album &quot;New Gene, Inspired from Phoenix&quot; on October 30, 2019. It features songs inspired by &quot;Phoenix&quot; written and performed by various artists, including Glim Spanky, Kizuna AI, Tavito Nanao and Naotarō Moriyama.

<text>Frome Vauchurch is a parish in the county of Dorset in southern England, situated approximately northwest of the county town Dorchester. It includes the hamlets of Frome Vauchurch, Higher Frome Vauchurch, Lower Frome Vauchurch and Tollerford. Frome Vauchurch is sited in the Frome valley amongst the chalk hills of the Dorset Downs. The parish is adjacent to the village of Maiden Newton, with which the parish&#x27;s hamlets are virtually contiguous. Dorset County Council&#x27;s latest (2013) estimate of the parish population is 160.

The Frome Valley Trail and the Mackmillan Way long-distance trails pass through the parish.

Frome Vauchurch was the home of the writers Sylvia Townsend Warner and Valentine Ackland. They moved into a house called Riversdale beside the River Frome in 1937, which they first rented and later bought.

The Parish Church of St Francis is originally 12th century but was substantially rebuilt in the 17th century and restored in c.1879, and is a Grade II* listed building.

<text>Logistello is a computer program that plays the game Othello, also known as Reversi. Logistello was written by Michael Buro and is regarded as a strong player, having beaten the human world champion Takeshi Murakami six games to none in 1997 — the best Othello programs are now much stronger than any human player. Logistello&#x27;s evaluation function is based on disc patterns and features over a million numerical parameters which were tuned using linear regression.
