<text>Journey to the Far Side of the Sun (also known as Doppelgänger) is a 1969 British science fiction film directed by Robert Parrish and starring Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring, Loni von Friedl and Patrick Wymark. It was written by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and Donald James, and produced by the Andersons for Century 21.

Set in the year 2069, the film concerns a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a newly discovered planet which lies directly opposite Earth on the far side of the Sun. The mission ends in disaster and the death of one of the astronauts, following which his colleague realises that the planet is a mirror image of Earth in every detail, with a parallel and duplicate timeline.

The film was the first major live-action production by the Andersons, known for their puppet television programmes such as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. Having originally conceived the story as a television play, they were encouraged by their employer Lew Grade to pitch the project as a feature film to Jay Kanter of Universal Pictures. Though underwhelmed by the script, Kanter greenlit the film after the Andersons hired Parrish as director. The film was shot between July and October 1968 at Pinewood Studios and on location in England and Portugal. As filming progressed, the working relationship between Parrish and the Andersons became strained. Meanwhile, creative disagreements between Gerry Anderson and business partner John Read, the director of photography, led to Read&#x27;s resignation from Century 21. In an effort to distinguish the film from their puppet productions, the Andersons wrote adult themes into the script, although cuts were required for the film to be awarded an A certificate by the British Board of Film Censors.

The film premiered in August 1969 in the United States and October 1969 in the United Kingdom. It performed poorly at the box office during its initial theatrical run but has since garnered a cult following. The film has received mixed reviews from critics; while the special effects and production design have been praised, some commentators have judged the parallel Earth premise to be clichéd and uninspired. Various plot devices and imagery have been viewed as pastiches of other science fiction films, such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). Several members of the cast went on to appear in &quot;UFO&quot;, the Andersons&#x27; first live-action TV series, which also re-used many of the film&#x27;s props.

==Plot==
In 2069, the European Space Exploration Council&#x27;s (EUROSEC) &quot;Sun Probe&quot; discovers a planet in the same orbital path as Earth on the far side of the Sun. The findings are transmitted to a power in the East by double agent Dr Hassler. Tracing the messages to Hassler&#x27;s laboratory, Security Chief Mark Neuman corners the scientist and kills him.

EUROSEC director Jason Webb convinces NASA representative David Poulson that the West must send a crewed mission to the planet before Hassler&#x27;s allies in the East. NASA astronaut Colonel Glenn Ross and EUROSEC astrophysicist Dr John Kane are assigned to the mission. After undergoing training at the EUROSEC Space Centre in Portugal, Ross and Kane blast off in the spacecraft &quot;Phoenix&quot;. They are put into an artificial hibernation for the outbound journey, with &quot;Heart-Lung-Kidney&quot; machines maintaining their vital functions. Three weeks later, &quot;Phoenix&quot; reaches the planet and Ross and Kane are revived. Scans for life prove inconclusive, so the astronauts decide to make a surface landing in their auxiliary craft, &quot;Dove&quot;. During its descent, &quot;Dove&quot; is damaged in a thunderstorm and crashes in a mountain range, seriously injuring Kane. The astronauts are picked up by a human rescue team, who tell Ross they have landed near Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. It appears that Ross and Kane have returned to Earth, and they are flown back to the Space Centre.

Neuman and EUROSEC official Lise Hartman question Ross, who denies that he aborted the mission. Later, Kane dies of his injuries. Ross discovers that people are now driving on the wrong side of the road and that he can no longer read printed text because it is all backwards. He comes to the realisation that he is indeed on the unknown planet, a Counter-Earth where every detail is a &quot;mirror image&quot; of his Earth. Ross&#x27;s wife Sharon refuses to accept his claims, but Webb is convinced when Ross demonstrates his ease in reading reflected text and Kane&#x27;s &quot;post mortem&quot; examination reveals that his internal organs are on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of his body. Ross theorises that the two Earths are parallel and that his counterpart from this world is experiencing similar events on his Earth. Webb proposes that Ross retrieve the flight recorder from the orbiting &quot;Phoenix&quot; and return home.

EUROSEC builds a new &quot;Dove&quot; designed to be compatible with the reversed technologies of &quot;Phoenix&quot;. Modifications include reverse-polarisation of the electrical circuits. Ross blasts off in the spacecraft, which he has named &quot;Doppelganger&quot;, and attempts to dock with &quot;Phoenix&quot;. However, the electrical systems malfunction, crippling the spacecraft, causing it to fall back towards the Space Centre. EUROSEC are unable to correct the fault and &quot;Doppelganger&quot; crashes into a parked spacecraft, killing Ross and starting a chain reaction that destroys much of the Space Centre. All records of Ross&#x27;s presence on the Counter-Earth are lost in the disaster.

Years later, former EUROSEC director Jason Webb, now confined to a wheelchair and in a much diminished mental state, is admitted to a nursing home. He sees his reflection in a mirror. He rolls forward quickly, trying to touch his doppelganger, but crashes into the mirror and dies.

==Production==
In 1967, producer Jay Kanter arrived in London to set up a European office for Universal Pictures. Kanter was open to funding promising film ideas, so Lew Grade, the Andersons&#x27; employer and financial backer, set up a meeting for Gerry Anderson to pitch a story about a hypothetical &quot;mirror&quot; Earth. On the inspiration for the film, Anderson said: &quot;I thought, rather naively, what if there was another planet on the other side of the Sun, orbiting at exactly the same speed and the same size as Earth? That idea then developed into the planet being a replicated Earth and that&#x27;s how it ended up, a mirrored planet&quot;.

The earliest version of the script was written by Tony Williamson. At one point it ran to 194 pages, enough for a three-hour film. The Andersons had conceived the story as a one-hour drama for Associated Television, but Sylvia thought the premise &quot;too good for a television play&quot; and suggested making it as a feature film instead. John Read, the Andersons&#x27; business partner, proposed the title &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;. According to Gerry, the term &quot;means &#x27;a copy of oneself&#x27;, and the legend goes that if you meet your doppelganger, it is the point of your death. Following that legend, clearly, I had to steer the film so that I could end it illustrating the meaning of that word&quot;. Responding to claims that the tone was overly &quot;dark&quot;, Anderson said that he wanted the film to have an interesting premise.

Kanter was dissatisfied with the Williamson script, so the Andersons&#x27; began to re-write it themselves and brought in Donald James as a co-writer to improve the characterisation. The revisions included substantial changes to the parts set on the mirror Earth, essentially causing the characters of Ross and Kane to switch roles. In the original script, Ross was blinded in the &quot;Dove&quot; crash, while Kane survived but was declared insane. A structural defect in &quot;Doppelganger&quot; caused it to burn up in the atmosphere with Kane inside, and the film ended with Kane&#x27;s wife, the Rosses and Webb attending his funeral.

Despite James&#x27;s efforts, Kanter remained unenthusiastic. However, he agreed to finance the film provided that the Andersons chose a &quot;bankable&quot; director who met with his approval. Gerry&#x27;s first choice was David Lane, who had directed Century 21&#x27;s puppet films &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot; (1966) and &quot;Thunderbird 6&quot; (1968), but Kanter wanted an experienced mainstream director. After weeks of searching, in June 1968 the Andersons hired Robert Parrish, who had co-directed &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967). According to Gerry, Parrish &quot;told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us. Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up and we were in business&quot;. Anderson said that while the negative critical response to &quot;Casino Royale&quot; raised questions about Parrish&#x27;s ability, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot; could not have been made without him: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a question of, &#x27;Will we get on with him?&#x27; or, &#x27;Is he the right man?&#x27; He was a name director, so we signed him up immediately&quot;.

===Casting===
Leading the cast was Roy Thinnes as Colonel Glenn Ross of NASA. Thinnes was cast on the basis of his starring role in &quot;The Invaders&quot; and his resemblance to Paul Newman. In the Andersons&#x27; script, Ross&#x27;s first name was Stewart and he was the first person on Mars. In a 2008 interview, Thinnes said of the film: &quot;I thought [it] was an interesting premise, although now we know that there isn&#x27;t another planet on the other side of the Sun, through our space exploration and telescopic abilities. But at that time it was conceivable, and it could have been scary&quot;. To reflect the script&#x27;s characterisation of Ross as a heavy smoker, Thinnes went through numerous packets of cigarettes over the course of the production, to the detriment of his health. In September 1969, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that the actor would demand a non-smoking clause for his next film: &quot;He smokes about two packets a day, but the perpetual lighting up of new cigarettes for continuity purposes was too much&quot;.

Ian Hendry was cast as Dr John Kane, a British astrophysicist and head of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; project. In his biography, Anderson recalled that Hendry &quot;was always drinking&quot; and was visibly intoxicated during the filming of the &quot;Dove&quot; crash sequence: &quot;... he was pissed as a newt, and it was as much as he could do to stagger away. Despite all that, it looked exactly as it was supposed to on screen.&quot; In the original script, Kane&#x27;s first name was Philip and he had a wife called Susan. Scenes deleted from the finished film showed the character pursuing a romance with EUROSEC official Lise Hartman, played by Loni von Friedl, whom the Andersons cast in Berlin.

Ross&#x27;s wife Sharon was played by Lynn Loring. The role had first gone to either Gayle Hunnicutt or Tisha Sterling, but the original actress quit early in the production after falling ill. This led to the casting of Loring, Thinnes&#x27; then wife and a star of TV series &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; An earlier version of the script had the character appear in a nude scene, written into the film to distinguish it from the Andersons&#x27; previous productions. In a 1968 interview in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Gerry expressed a desire to change the public&#x27;s perception of Century 21, saying that his company had been &quot;typecast as makers of children&#x27;s films&quot;. On rumours that the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) would give the film an X certificate for mature content, he stated that it was Century 21&#x27;s desire to &quot;work with live artists doing subjects unsuitable for children&quot;. The finished film replaced the nude scene with milder shots showing Sharon stepping into and out of a shower. A subplot concerns the Rosses&#x27; attempts to conceive a child and Glenn&#x27;s discovery that Sharon has been taking birth control pills. The original script described Sharon as the daughter of a United States senator and had her begin an affair with EUROSEC public relations officer Carlo Monetti. In the finished film, this character, played by Franco De Rosa, is renamed Paulo Landi and appears only briefly; the affair is implied in one scene but not explored further. In a deleted scene, Glenn finds Paolo and Sharon in bed together at the Rosses&#x27; villa and throws them both into a swimming pool.

Patrick Wymark played Jason Webb, the director of EUROSEC. Wymark was cast for his performance as antiheroic businessman John Wilder in the TV dramas &quot;The Plane Makers&quot; and &quot;The Power Game&quot;, which were liked by the Andersons. Publicity material described the character as &quot;John Wilder (2069 model)&quot;. According to Gerry, Wymark&#x27;s heavy drinking caused him to slur his lines: in one scene, the actor &quot;had to list these explanations ... and on take after take he couldn&#x27;t remember that &#x27;two&#x27; followed &#x27;one&#x27;. We had to do it over and over again&quot;. Anderson&#x27;s biographers, Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, consider Wymark&#x27;s portrayal of Webb to be the film&#x27;s standout performance. The original script described Webb as a former Minister of Technology who is romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby (Norma Ronald, who had played Wilder&#x27;s secretary in &quot;The Plane Makers&quot; and &quot;The Power Game&quot;). This subplot was one of several that were cut to avoid an X certificate.

The supporting cast included George Sewell, Philip Madoc and Ed Bishop, who respectively played EUROSEC operations chief Mark Neuman (Mark Hallam in the original script), Dr Pontini, and NASA representative David Poulson. Sewell and Madoc had both appeared in &quot;The Power Game&quot;. Poulson was to have been played by Peter Dyneley, but the producers thought that he bore a strong resemblance to Wymark and re-cast the role, concerned that scenes with Dyneley and Wymark would cause audiences to confuse the characters of Poulson and Webb.

===Filming===


Filming began on 1 July 1968 at Pinewood Studios and ended on 16 October. The exterior of the EUROSEC Headquarters was represented by Neptune House in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire (now part of BBC Elstree Centre), while Heatherden Hall appeared as the old Jason Webb&#x27;s nursing home. In September, the crew travelled to Albufeira in Portugal for location shooting. Shortly after their arrival, Marcelo Caetano succeeded the incapacitated António de Oliveira Salazar as Prime Minister of Portugal. Parrish was concerned that this political instability might hold up the shoot, so reduced the filming schedule from one month to two weeks.

To create an illusion of a mirror Earth, the crew reversed the film negatives using a process called &quot;flop-over&quot;. This technique spared the production considerable time and money building specially &quot;reversed&quot; props and sets and organising road closures to film cars driving on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the road. However, it meant that scenes set on the Counter-Earth required careful planning and rehearsal with the cast and crew. It also resulted in a number of continuity errors: for example, the &quot;Heart-Lung-Kidney&quot; machines aboard &quot;Phoenix&quot; are first shown connected to Ross and Kane&#x27;s left wrists, then their right.

The crew had difficulty creating a scene in which the EUROSEC board hold an international videoconference on high-resolution viewing monitors. Due to the high cost of colour TV at the time of production and the need to avoid black and white to reflect the film&#x27;s futuristic setting, instead of using real viewing monitors the crew cut screen-sized gaps in a wall and positioned the actors playing the conference delegates behind them. Silver paper was added to reflect the studio lights and simulate a high-resolution image, with altered eyelines creating the illusion that each delegate is looking into a camera. Archer and Hearn praise this scene as an example of how Anderson &quot;proved once again that his productions were ahead of their time&quot;.

As filming progressed, Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson said that Kanter was brought in more than once to mediate between them: &quot;[Sylvia and I] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both desperately wanted to be in the big time&quot;. At one point, Parrish refused to film a number of scenes, saying that he would only end up deleting them. According to Anderson, when he reminded Parrish of his contractual obligations, the director loudly announced to the cast and crew: &quot;Hell, you heard the producer. If I don&#x27;t shoot these scenes which I don&#x27;t really want, don&#x27;t need and will cut out anyway, I&#x27;ll be in breach of contract. So what we&#x27;ll do is shoot those scenes next!&quot; In his biography, Anderson stated that his one regret about the film &quot;[was] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place&quot;. Sylvia described Parrish&#x27;s direction as &quot;uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him&quot;.

Parrish also clashed with Thinnes over the actor&#x27;s refusal to have his hair cut a certain way for the scenes set on the Counter-Earth. Thinnes, whose hair had already been repeatedly styled, later decided that this was merely Parrish&#x27;s way of asserting authority, having received a letter from a friend warning him that Thinnes could be difficult to work with. Gerry Anderson said that his own relationship with Thinnes was awkward, but that he liked the actor&#x27;s performance.

Other scenes led to disagreements within Century 21. For a scene depicting Lise Hartman (Loni von Friedl) taking a shower, cinematographer John Read did the lighting in silhouette as instructed by Parrish. Gerry Anderson, who had intended the scene to show Friedl nude, demanded a reshoot, insisting that Read honour his obligations not only to Parrish as director, but also to the producers. According to Sylvia, &quot;Gerry was very keen to show that he was part of the &#x27;Swinging Sixties&#x27; and felt that seeing a detailed nude shot – as he visualised it – was more &#x27;with it&#x27; than the more subdued version&quot;.

Another dispute arose when Read filmed shots of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; spacecraft model using a hand-held camera. In his biography, Anderson recalled: &quot;I knew enough about space travel to know that in a vacuum a spacecraft will travel as straight as a die ... [Parrish] told me that people were not familiar with space travel and therefore they would expect to see this kind of movement&quot;. Read refused to reshoot the scenes, stating that Parrish&#x27;s instructions took precedence over Anderson&#x27;s. He resigned from both the production and Century 21 at the request of the Andersons and Reg Hill, his fellow company directors. Anderson elaborated: &quot;Clearly, John was in a difficult position. I do now understand how he must have felt, but in my heart I feel he couldn&#x27;t play a double role&quot;.

===Design and effects===
The film&#x27;s special effects were produced at Century 21 Studios on the Slough Trading Estate under the direction of Derek Meddings. More than 200 effects shots were filmed. The design of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; spacecraft was based on the Saturn V rocket. During filming, the scale model unexpectedly caught fire and had to be completely rebuilt. For realism, the launch sequence was shot in the studios&#x27; car park against the actual sky.

Century 21 built a full-sized &quot;Dove&quot; module prop in Slough. However, it could not be used for the film due to an agreement between Pinewood Studios and the National Association of Theatrical Television and Kine Employees, which stated that all Pinewood film props were to be made in-house. The prop was destroyed, and although the Pinewood carpenters built a replacement, Anderson considered it inferior to the original.

Meddings also oversaw the construction of several futuristic land vehicles operated by EUROSEC. These included three six-wheeled utility vehicles, which were built from Mini Moke chassis by a Feltham-based company, and three cars modelled on Ford Zephyr Zodiacs. Fitted with dummy gull-wing doors, the adapted Fords were constructed by Alan Mann Racing under the supervision of Len Bailey.

Commenting on the film&#x27;s effects, Martin Anderson of Den of Geek describes the &quot;Phoenix&quot; command module as &quot;beautifully ergonomic without losing too much NASA-ness&quot; and the &quot;Dove&quot; lander as &quot;a beautiful fusion of JPL gloss with classic lines&quot;. He regards the &quot;Phoenix&quot; launch as Meddings&#x27; finest work prior to &quot;Moonraker&quot; (1979). Archer and Hearn describe the sequence as &quot;one of the most spectacular&quot; of its kind produced by Century 21.

===Music and titles===
Composer Barry Gray, who wrote the music for all of Century 21&#x27;s productions, said that his score for this film was his favourite. The score was recorded over three studio sessions held between 27 and 29 March 1969. The first session used a 55-member orchestra, the second 44, and the third 28. The sequence showing Ross and Kane&#x27;s journey to the Counter-Earth was accompanied by a piece titled &quot;Sleeping Astronauts&quot;, featuring an ondes Martenot played by French ondiste Sylvette Allart. Archer and Hearn describe this piece as &quot;one of the most enchanting&quot; ever written by Gray, adding that the soundtrack as a whole evoked a &quot;traditional Hollywood feel&quot; which contrasted with the film&#x27;s futuristic setting.

The title sequence, set inside Dr Hassler&#x27;s laboratory, was accompanied by a spy theme. This was inspired by the character&#x27;s undercover activities, which he performs using an artificial eye containing a micro-camera. Archer and Hearn regard this as a stylistic imitation of &quot;James Bond&quot; films.

==Release==
The completed film failed to impress either Universal or UK distributor The Rank Organisation. Rank delayed the film&#x27;s release by over a year. On 26 March 1969, the BBFC passed the film with an A certificate, which allowed children under 11 to see the film provided that they were accompanied by a parent or guardian. To secure this rating, cuts to shots of contraceptive pills were required. Rank enquired whether the film could be cut further to secure a U certificate, removing the need for parental supervision; the BBFC rejected the idea, stating that this would cause the film to lose all narrative sense.

The film was distributed by Rank in Europe and Universal in the US and Australia. While Rank kept the original title, Universal, judging that non-Europeans would be less familiar with the term &quot;doppelganger&quot;, renamed the film &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot;the title by which it is now more commonly known. Simon Archer and Stan Nicholls argue that while this title gives a clearer explanation of the plot, it lacks the &quot;intrigue and even poetic quality of ″&quot;Doppelgänger&quot;″&quot;.

After premiering in the US on 27 August 1969, the film had its UK debut on 8 October at the Odeon Cinema on Kensington High Street. It went on general release on 26 October, paired with &quot;Death of a Gunfighter&quot; to create a double feature. The film ran for less than a week in Odeon venues. A second round of US screenings began in Detroit on 1 November. Overall, the film performed poorly at the box office.

Two original 35 mm prints of the film are known to exist. One is kept by the British Film Institute; the other by Fanderson, the official Anderson fan club. While original prints give top billing to Ian Hendry, Universal&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the...&quot; format credits Thinnes first. Some British prints feature an alternative version of the final scene with a short voice-over from Ross, repeating a line of dialogue the character says to Webb earlier in the film: &quot;Jason, we were right. There are definitely two identical planets.&quot;

The film had its British TV premiere on 7 December 1974 on Granada Television. Some TV broadcasts of the film have shown an incorrectly flopped picture. This originated from a mistake made in the 1980s when an original print was being transferred to videotape: a telecine operator who was unfamiliar with the film believed that the Counter-Earth scenes had been flopped in error, so made a second flop to reverse it. This de-flopped picture, which became the standard for all TV showings, makes it appear that the Ross of the Counter-Earth has landed on the &quot;normal&quot; Earth.

===Home media===
Previously available on LaserDisc, the film was released on Region 1 DVD in 1998 and both Region 1 and 2 DVD (digitally remastered) in 2008. Prior to the 2008 release, the BBFC re-classified the film PG for &quot;mild violence and language&quot;.

Blu-ray versions followed in 2015. The US Blu-ray release was by Universal Entertainment. The Australian release by Madman Entertainment features a transfer of Fanderson&#x27;s original film print, an exclusive audio commentary by Gerry Anderson, and a double-sided sleeve, which enables the Blu-ray case to be stored under either of the film&#x27;s titles.

==Reception==
Since its original release, the film has had a mixed response from critics. Simon Archer and Stan Nicholls consider it a cult film. The film has a 40% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

===Contemporary reviews===
Rating the film &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; described the theme as &quot;more abstruse&quot; than that a of a typical science fiction feature. It added: &quot;the intricacies are insufficiently clarified, and Robert Parrish&#x27;s direction is so leaden-footed, that despite the explosive finale the film as a whole is simply dull.&quot; The film was also negatively received by the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, which called it &quot;corny&quot;, as well as by David Robinson of &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Margaret Hinxman of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Times&quot;, critic John Russell Taylor praised it as &quot;quite ingenious&quot; but suggested that the title and pre-release publicity gave away too much of the plot.

In the US, Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;never really gets off the ground&quot; and &quot;remains a little too civilised and restrained for its own good.&quot; He praised the &quot;crispness&quot; of certain dialogue, along with the visual style and Parrish&#x27;s direction, but argued that the story deserved &quot;a larger movie, at least one with more stratospheric sweep and suspense&quot;. Judith Crist of &quot;New York&quot; magazine described &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; as &quot;a science fiction film that comes up with a fascinating premise three-quarters of the way along and does nothing with it.&quot; She commended the film for being &quot;nicely gadget-ridden&quot;, as well as raising questions about the conflict between science and politics, but criticised the editing. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine considered the plot confusing, equating the &quot;Dove&quot; crash to the quality of the writing: &quot;Astronauts take a pill to induce a three-week sleep during their flight. Thereafter the script falls to pieces in as many parts as their craft.&quot;

While &quot;The Miami News&quot; and the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; regarded the film as better than average for its genre, &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; dismissed it as &quot;a churned out science fiction yarn ... Let&#x27;s hope there&#x27;s only one movie like this one&quot;, and ranked it among the worst films of the year. The &quot;Gazette&quot; added that while the film gets worse towards the end, &quot;until then it&#x27;s a reasonably diverting futuristic melodrama.&quot; A review in the &quot;Southeast Missourian&quot; stated that &quot;in today&#x27;s space terminology [the film] almost rates as science – and pure reportage through film. Still, it evolves as a fascinating motion-picture entertainment.&quot; In 1975, Jeff Rovin called &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; &quot;confusing but colourful&quot; and praised its &quot;superb&quot; effects.

===Retrospective reviews===
Gary Gerani, co-writer of &quot;Pumpkinhead&quot;, ranks &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; 81st in his book &quot;Top 100 Sci-Fi Movies&quot;, calling the film &quot;enigmatic&quot; and a &quot;fine example of speculative fantasy in the late &#x27;60s&quot;. He praises Thinnes&#x27; and Wymark&#x27;s performances, as well as the characterisation, the film&#x27;s secondary themes (such as adultery, infertility and corruption) and the &quot;Fourth of July-style&quot; special effects. Sylvia Anderson suggested that American audiences, who were less familiar with Century 21&#x27;s puppet productions than their British counterparts, were more enthusiastic about the film. She explained: &quot;It was all too easy to compare our real actors with our puppet characters and descriptions such as &#x27;wooden&#x27;, &#x27;expressionless&#x27;, &#x27;no strings attached&#x27; and &#x27;puppet-like&#x27; were cheap shots some of the UK critics could not resist ... Typecasting is the lazy man&#x27;s friend, and boy, were we typecast in Britain&quot;. In 1992, she said of the film: &quot;I saw it on TV a couple of years ago and I was very pleased with it. I thought it came over quite well&quot;. To Chris Bentley, the film is a &quot;stylish and thought-provoking science fiction thriller&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; magazine gives the film two stars out of four, calling it a &quot;strange little film&quot; with an &quot;overwritten script&quot;. Glenn Erickson of DVD Talk considers &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; a &quot;good&quot; film but writes that it &quot;takes an okay premise but does next to nothing with it. We see 100 minutes of bad drama and good special effects, and then the script opts for frustration and meaningless mystery&quot;. He criticises the cinematography, comparing it to that of &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; in the sense that the characters &quot;stand and talk a lot&quot;, while defining the script as &quot;at least 60 per cent hardware-talk and exposition ... How people move about – airplane, parachute, centrifuge – is more important than what they&#x27;re doing&quot;. In a review for Den of Geek, Martin Anderson praises the direction and effects but states that the film&#x27;s &quot;robust and prosaic&quot; dialogue sits &quot;ill-at-ease with the metaphysical ponderings&quot;. He criticises some of the editing, noting that many of the effects shots have &quot;that &#x27;Hornby&#x27; factor, slowing up the narrative unnecessarily&quot;. He rates the film three stars out of five, summing it up as &quot;an interesting journey with many rewards&quot;.

The Film4 website gives the film two-and-a-half stars out of five, summing it up as &quot;an occasionally interesting failure&quot;. The review praises the effects and costume design but judges the subplots about Hassler&#x27;s treachery and the Rosses&#x27; marital problems to be unnecessary distractions from the main story. It also questions the originality of the premise and the depth of the writing: &quot;Anderson&#x27;s has to be the cheapest alternate Earth ever. Whereas audiences might expect a world where the Roman Empire never fell or the Nazis won World War II, here the shocking discovery is that people write backwards. That&#x27;s it&quot;. A similar view is expressed by Gary Westfahl, who describes the setting as &quot;the most boring and unimaginative alien world imaginable&quot;.

Reviewing the film for &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; in 2021, Robert Hanks called the story &quot;compellingly weird&quot; even if &quot;the pacing is dreadful [...] the dialogue wince-making [and] the science utterly implausible.&quot; He also noted the film&#x27;s inclusion of various &quot;Anderson obsessions&quot; like &quot;huge supranational organisations, spies with bizarre gadgets, futuristic cars, and odd close-ups of hands performing intricate tasks&quot;, adding that it was &quot;perhaps a shame Parrish didn&#x27;t imprint himself more firmly on the material&quot;.

===Interpretation===
Archer and Nicholls suggest as possible causes of the film&#x27;s box office failure its &quot;quirky, offbeat nature&quot; and waning public interest in space exploration after Apollo 11. The topic of the Moon landing dominated a contemporary review in the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot;, which found similarities in the plot of &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot;: &quot;... the spacemen find a few bugs in their &#x27;LM&#x27; and crash on the planet. And do they ever have their hands full in getting back to Earth!&quot; Suggesting that the performances are hampered by an excess of technical dialogue, the review concluded: &quot;... the makers of this space exploiter may get lots of mileage at the box office, but Neil, Buzz and Mike did it better on TV.&quot;

It has also been suggested that &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, both released the year before, set a high standard for &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; and other films to follow. Erickson argues that &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; is inferior to &quot;2001&quot; for presenting a &quot;working future&quot; that is still dominated by commercialism. Comparing the visual style to that of &quot;2001&quot;, he notes similar use of &quot;psychedelic&quot; images and close-ups of human eyes but calls such imitation &quot;fluff without any deeper meaning&quot;. Film4&#x27;s review describes the final scene featuring the elderly Webb as &quot;hell-bent on recreating the enigmatic finale of &quot;2001&quot; by using a mirror, a wheelchair and a tartan blanket.&quot; Rovin argues that the effects &quot;[occasionally] outshine&quot; &quot;2001&quot;″s&quot;, adding that it &quot;attempts to kindle a profundity similar to that of [&quot;2001&quot;] in its abstract philosophising about the dichotomy of dual worlds, but fails with a combination of meat-and-potatoes science fiction and quasi-profound themes.&quot; He argues that &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; is &quot;neither a kid&#x27;s film nor a cult film&quot; but rules that &quot;the elements that comprise the finished effort are more than individually successful.&quot;

Martin Anderson compares &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; to other science fiction films like &quot;Solaris&quot;, identifying a &quot;lyrical&quot; tone to the dialogue. However, he concedes that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t bear comparison with Kubrick or Tarkovsky&quot;, the directors of &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Solaris&quot;. Douglas Pratt and the Institute of Contemporary Arts compare the film to &quot;The Parallel&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; which sees an astronaut returning to Earth only to find it mysteriously changed, and realising that he has ended up in a parallel universe. S. T. Joshi likens the film&#x27;s theme of duplication to the premise of &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;, in which a race of extraterrestrials called the Pod People abduct humans and replace them with alien doubles.

===Legacy===
Despite the film&#x27;s failure, Grade gave the Andersons further commissions with live actors. The first of these was the TV series &quot;UFO&quot;, which began airing in 1970. &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; is considered a precursor to &quot;UFO&quot; and has also been described as a &quot;trial run&quot; for the follow-up series, &quot;&quot;. Most of the cast went on to appear in &quot;UFO&quot;, notably Ed Bishop as the protagonist Colonel Ed Straker and George Sewell as his deputy, Colonel Alec Freeman. Many of the film&#x27;s costumes, shooting locations and musical tracks were also re-used, along with props including the &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Dove&quot; miniatures and the EUROSEC ground vehicles. Neptune House appeared as the exterior of Harlington-Straker Film Studios, where SHADO, the organisation headed by Straker, is based. The recycled music included the tracks &quot;Sleeping Astronauts&quot; and &quot;Strange Planet&quot;, the latter accompanying the series&#x27; end credits. Additionally, &quot;UFO&quot;″s opening titles imitated the teleprinter shots which formed the basis of the film&#x27;s title sequence.

A retrospective by IGN argues that the presentation of politics and economics in &quot;Journey to the Far Side of the Sun&quot; goes against the conventions of 1960s science fiction. This is reflected in &quot;UFO&quot;, whose characters &quot;were constantly having to deal with the pressures of having to show progress under the scrutiny of accountants and elected officials, much the same way NASA was starting to in the US&quot;. On the links between the film and &quot;UFO&quot;, Martin Anderson makes another connection to Kubrick: &quot;... the most interesting common ground between the two projects remains the bleak ending(s) and the slight flirtation with the acid-induced imagery and of &quot;2001&quot;&quot;.

<text>Paul Joshua &quot;Sonny&quot; Sandoval (born May 16, 1974) is an American musician, rapper, singer, and songwriter. He is best known as the co-founder and lead vocalist of Christian nu metal band P.O.D.

==Biography==

Sandoval was born in San Diego, California. to a Chamorro-Hawaiian mother and a Mexican-Italian father. When he was eighteen, Sandoval&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with leukemia. During her illness, Sandoval was greatly influenced by his mother&#x27;s faith as a devout Christian.

==Career==

=== P.O.D. ===
Sandoval is best known as co-founder and the lead vocalist of the metal band P.O.D. Over the course of their career, the band has received three Grammy Award nominations, contributed to numerous motion picture soundtracks and toured internationally. They have sold over 12 million records worldwide. With their third studio album, &quot;The Fundamental Elements of Southtown&quot;, P.O.D. achieved their initial mainstream success; the album was certified platinum by the RIAA in 2000.

===The Whosoevers===
Since 2008, Sandoval has been part of an outreach group, The Whosoevers, with Ryan Ries, Lacey Sturm, of Flyleaf, and Brian Welch, guitarist for the nu metal band Korn.

=== Other work ===
Sandoval appeared in Project 86&#x27;s self-titled album in the song &quot;Six Sirens&quot;. In 2004, he contributed to two tracks on Anastacia&#x27;s self titled album, &quot;Seasons Change&quot; and &quot;I Do&quot;. He has been named number 63 in &quot;Hit Parader&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time in 2006.

Sandoval will publish his autobiography &quot;Son of Southtown&quot; on February 25th, 2025.

=== Legacy ===
In 2023, the City of San Diego declared June 23 to be &quot;Sonny Sandoval Day,&quot; meant to honor the vocalist.

==Personal life==

=== Family ===
He and his wife Shannon married in 1996, and have two daughters, Nevaeh and Marley, and a son, Justice. Sandoval is widely credited with the sudden popularity of the name Nevaeh, which, as he revealed on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;, is &quot;heaven&quot; spelled backwards. He resides in San Diego.

===Appearance===
For most of P.O.D.&#x27;s career, Sandoval was well known for his dreadlocks (which, by the release of the video for &quot;Going in Blind&quot;, reached his waist). At the time of the release of P.O.D.&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;When Angels &amp; Serpents Dance&quot;, he cut them off, but has since regrown them.

<text>&quot;Danke Schoen&quot; ( , ) is a pop song of German origin, whose title translates to English as &quot;Thank you very much&quot;. Bert Kaempfert, who composed the melody, recorded it as an instrumental, in 1959 and later in 1962, under the title &quot;Candlelight Cafe&quot;. Kurt Schwabach wrote the German lyrics. The song gained international fame in 1963 when singer Wayne Newton recorded an American version, with English lyrics by Milt Gabler. The song achieved renewed popularity when it was featured in the 1986 American comedy film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, lip-synced by the main character, Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick).

==Newton&#x27;s version==
Wayne Newton&#x27;s first version was released when he was 21 years old. The song was originally intended for singer Bobby Darin as a follow-up to his hit single &quot;18 Yellow Roses&quot; in the spring of 1963, but after seeing Newton perform at the Copacabana, Darin decided to give the song to Newton and transposed the key of the recording to fit Newton&#x27;s voice. It has been featured in many television commercials and motion pictures, such as &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;, &quot;Vegas Vacation&quot;, &quot;Fools Rush In&quot; as well as the French-American comedy &quot;Crime Spree&quot;. In 2015 it was used in a television commercial for Bank of America, and in 2017 in a trailer for the video game &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot;. In 2016 the song was used in a series of commercials for Australian insurer AAMI. The Newton version peaked at No. 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s pop chart, and No. 3 on its easy listening chart.
In the song, Newton pronounces the words as &quot;dunke shane&quot;, rather than &quot;danke schön&quot;, and it has been postulated that this is a regional accent variation that may have been prevalent in communities of German immigrants to the USA.

<text>Blood Work is a 2002 American mystery thriller film starring, produced, and directed by Clint Eastwood. It co-stars Jeff Daniels, Wanda De Jesús, and Anjelica Huston. The story is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Michael Connelly.

Eastwood won the Future Film Festival Digital Award at the Venice Film Festival for his work on the film.

==Plot==
FBI Special Agent Terrell &quot;Terry&quot; McCaleb, a veteran criminal profiler, leads a joint FBI-LAPD task force to capture the &quot;Code Killer&quot;, a serial murderer who leaves taunting messages for McCaleb. While addressing reporters at the latest crime scene, McCaleb sees what he believes to be the killer in the crowd and pursues him only to suffer a near-fatal heart attack.

Two years later, the now retired McCaleb lives out of his fishing boat, &quot;Following Sea&quot;, on the Long Beach bay, having received a heart transplant. He is approached by waitress Graciella Rivers; her sister, Gloria, was murdered during a robbery and she asks him to solve the case. He discovers that the heart transplanted into him was Gloria&#x27;s. Struggling with survivor&#x27;s guilt, McCaleb agrees to help her.

Against the advice of his physician, McCaleb conducts an illegal investigation into Gloria&#x27;s death, aided by his alcoholic neighbor Jasper &quot;Buddy&quot; Noone and a former colleague, LASD Detective Jaye Winston. He discovers that the killer committed a previous murder and identifies two potential suspects, both of whom wind up dead. Eventually, he realizes that the Code Killer is responsible, and pieces together that he and Noone are one and the same. Buddy confesses that he killed Gloria to ensure that McCaleb would be saved.

Declaring his intention to &quot;resume the game&quot; between them, Buddy reveals that he has kidnapped Graciella and her nephew, Gloria&#x27;s son Raymond. McCaleb forces him to reveal that they are trapped on a wrecked Coast Guard cutter in the bay. He rescues them and shoots Buddy before Graciella holds his head underwater to get revenge for her sister. With his past behind him, McCaleb starts a relationship with Graciella and takes her and Raymond out on his boat.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;Blood Work&quot; was filmed in spring 2002 in Los Angeles and Long Beach, California, in 38 days.

==Reception==
&quot;Blood Work&quot; received mixed reviews. &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; shows a score of 52%, calling it &quot;a routine, but competently made thriller marred by lethargic pacing.&quot; However, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote while it was similar to many Eastwood films, &quot;there is something comforting in seeing this old warhorse trot gamely out of the gate for yet another run on familiar turf.&quot;

The film was not a box office success, grossing $31.8 million worldwide on a budget of $50 million.

<text>Bruck an der Leitha (; &quot;Bridge on the Leitha&quot;) is a town in the Austrian state of Lower Austria on the border of Burgenland, marked by the Leitha river. In 2018 it had a population of around 8,000.

== History ==
In and around Bruck parts of neolithic tools were found, which makes it likely that there was a settlement there at that time. In Roman time, there was the crossing of two major roads, one of them being the Amber Road, the other a link to the Via Militaris. The important Roman army camp Carnuntum was located only ten miles northeast of Bruck at the Amber Road. In Bruck a Roman fortification is said to have been at the place of &quot;Schloss Prugg&quot; (castle of Duke Harrach), of which one part still is named &quot;Roman Tower&quot; (though being built in the Middle Ages).

After the end of the Roman Empire, the first traces of new settlement date from around 900. Graves from this time show Hungarian and later Francian/Bavarian influence. In 1074 the settlement is first documented as &quot;Aschirichesprucca&quot; and elevated to the status of a city in 1239. During the 13th century Bruck was rebuilt according to a rectangular street-scheme north-east of the old settlement.

Though quite strongly fortified since, Bruck never played an important role in a military conflict. In the long period of wars with the Turkish Empire the fortifications were already outdated, so Bruck did not even try to resist Turkish troops when they approached Vienna in 1529 and 1683 (Siege of Vienna). Therefore, Bruck was not destroyed (unlike other towns like Hainburg).

After this period, Bruck prospered and became an important center of wine production and trade. In the Napoleonic Wars Bruck was a center of maneuvers for the Austrian army, which it remained during the 19th century. In 1867 an important permanent military base was erected. After the end of World War I in 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up. Most of Bruck belonged to Austria, but the military base and the main railway station was situated on the Hungarian side of the border (this part of Bruck is called Bruckneudorf).

This border, symbolised by the river Leitha, separated the Austrian Empire from the Kingdom of Hungary (Cisleithania and Transleithania). 

In 1921, when the western parts of Hungary were integrated to Austrian territory under the name of &quot;Burgenland&quot;, Bruck remained divided between the provinces of Lower Austria and Burgenland. Bruck an der Leitha became the capital of the same-named district. Despite the important military base neighbouring Bruck, the town was not much affected by World War II. Today, Bruck has about 7300 inhabitants and still is the administrative center of the district. Important sights are the city walls from the 13th century, the Baroque church and the old castle, Schloss Prugg, of the Dukes of Harrach.

Today, the town is prospering in the energy department. It has nearby a large wind farm (possibly 60MW), which generates all the electricity for the town. In fact, the wind farm produces more energy than the town
consumes, so the town profits off it through energy sales.

<text>Scooby-Doo (also known as Scooby-Doo: The Movie) is a 2002 American mystery adventure comedy horror film produced by Mosaic Media Group and based on the long-running animated franchise. The first installment in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; live-action film series, the film was directed by Raja Gosnell from a screenplay by James Gunn, and stars Freddie Prinze Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, Matthew Lillard, Linda Cardellini and Rowan Atkinson. Neil Fanning provides the voice of the titular character. The plot revolves around Mystery Incorporated, a group of four young adults and a talking Great Dane who solve mysteries, who reunite after a two-year disbandment to investigate a mystery at a popular horror-themed tropical island resort.

Filmed in and around Queensland, Australia, on a budget of $84 million, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Pictures on June 14, 2002, and grossed $275 million worldwide. Reggae artist Shaggy and rock group MxPx performed different versions of the &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; theme song. The Scooby-Doo Spooky Coaster, a ride based on the film, was built at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, in 2002. The film received generally negative reviews from critics. A sequel, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, was released on March 26, 2004.

== Plot ==
After Mystery, Inc. solves the mystery of the Luna Ghost at a toy factory, long-brewing friction between Fred Jones, the self-obsessed glory hog, Daphne Blake, who has become tired of being the damsel in distress, and Velma Dinkley, from whom Fred regularly steals credit for her plans, causes the gang to break into a heated argument. Subsequently, they disband, abandoning a dismayed Scooby-Doo and Shaggy Rogers, and leaving them to care for the gang&#x27;s van, the Mystery Machine.

Two years later, they are all invited to solve a mystery on a horror-themed tropical resort named &quot;Spooky Island&quot; at the behest of owner Emile Mondavarious, who believes the guests have fallen under a demonic curse. While Shaggy and Scooby hope this will bring the gang back together, Velma, Fred, and Daphne each intend to solve the mystery on their own. Velma attends a ritualistic performance given by actor N&#x27;Goo Tuana and his henchman, famous luchador Zarkos. N&#x27;Goo claims ancient demons once ruled the island, but have been plotting revenge ever since they were displaced by the resort. Meanwhile, Shaggy falls for a girl named Mary Jane, who is allergic to dogs, distancing himself from Scooby in the process.

The gang are led separately to the resort&#x27;s haunted house ride, and they decide to get along for the time being; they split up and search for clues. Fred and Velma discover a film that educates inhuman creatures about human culture, while Daphne finds a pyramid-shaped artifact called the &quot;Daemon Ritus&quot;. Later, at the resort&#x27;s hotel, Fred, Velma, and Mondavarious are kidnapped and possessed by the island&#x27;s demons. Mary Jane calls the Coast Guard for help, but the radio operators have been possessed. The next day, after Scooby tries and fails to tell Shaggy that Mary Jane is secretly possessed by a demon, the two have a falling-out that results in Scooby-Doo going missing as well; Zarkos steals back the Daemon Ritus from Daphne, who is also captured and possessed.

Shaggy searches for his friends underground and finds a vat of protoplasm containing the souls of all those possessed. He frees the souls of Daphne, Fred, and Velma, who quickly discover that sunlight destroys the demons. A local voodoo priest informs the gang the demons are to perform their &quot;Darpokalypse&quot; Ritual, which will see them rule the world for ten thousand years if a pure soul is sacrificed in the Daemon Ritus. The gang realizes that the pure soul is that of Scooby, whom Mondavarious was ultimately after. Finally realizing their mistake, Fred, Daphne, and Velma put aside their differences for good and team up with Shaggy to save Scooby and the world.

The gang infiltrates the ritual, where Mondavarious is foiled in sacrificing Scooby&#x27;s soul by Shaggy. Mondavarious turns out to be a robot controlled by Scooby&#x27;s estranged nephew Scrappy-Doo, who has been plotting revenge on the gang for being abandoned long ago due to his increasingly power-hungry and egomaniacal nature. Absorbing the tourists&#x27; souls, Scrappy transforms into a giant monster and tries to kill the gang. Daphne knocks Zarkos into the vat, tipping it over and returning most of the other souls to their bodies, then reflects sunlight through a skull-shaped disco ball, killing the released demons. Shaggy frees the rest of the souls, reversing Scrappy&#x27;s transformation in the process, and finds the real Mondavarious, having been captured and replaced by Scrappy. Scrappy and his henchmen are arrested, and Mystery, Inc. reunites.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Producer Charles Roven began developing a live-action treatment of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; in 1994. By the end of the decade, the combined popularity of &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, along with the addition of the script and updated digital animation, led Warner Bros. to fast track production of the film. Mike Myers was reported to be co-writing the screenplay with Jay Kogan in July 1998, and was later on board to play Shaggy as well. In October 2000, the film was officially given the green light. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Raja Gosnell had been hired to direct the film.

The film was shot on location in and around Queensland, Australia. Production was started on February 12, 2001, at the Warner Bros. Movie World theme park, with over 400 cast and crew also taking over Tangalooma Island Resort for six weeks to film all the scenes set on Spooky Island. Production wrapped in June 2001. The film was originally set to have a much darker tone, essentially poking fun at the original series, much like &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, and was set for a PG-13 rating. Shaggy was set to be a stoner, and there were many marijuana references.

Several rumors about these aspects in the original cartoon series were passed around by fans of the original and were to be incorporated into the live-action film. In March 2001, one month into filming, the first official cast picture was released.

According to Sarah Michelle Gellar, after the cast had signed on there was a change, and the film became more family-friendly, though some of the original adult jokes are still in the film. They are also included in deleted scenes on the home media releases. Gellar said her character and Linda Cardellini&#x27;s shared an onscreen kiss that did not make the final film. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t just, like, for fun,&quot; she said, explaining it took place in the body-switching scene. &quot;Initially in the soul-swapping scene, Velma and Daphne couldn&#x27;t seem to get their souls back together in the woods. And so the way they found was to kiss, and the souls went back into proper alignment.&quot;

In 2017, the 15th anniversary of the release of the film, James Gunn, the film&#x27;s screenwriter, revealed in a Facebook post that there was an R-rated cut of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and that CGI was used to remove cleavage of the female cast members.

=== Casting ===
Actors Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sarah Michelle Gellar, who both previously worked together in &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997) and portray Fred and Daphne, are romantically involved in both the film and reality. This film marks the first time in the franchise&#x27;s history where the characters are portrayed as a couple. The pair married shortly after the film was released. Prinze said of his character, &quot;[He] always showed more arrogance than everyone else. So in the movie, I took the opportunity to make him as narcissistic and self-loving as possible.&quot;

Jim Carrey was originally attached to play Shaggy, while Mike Myers also expressed interest in the role. Lochlyn Munro also auditioned for the role. The role was eventually given to Matthew Lillard. When asked about watching several cartoons before playing Shaggy, Lillard responded, &quot;Everything I could get my hands on. If I ever have to see another episode of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;, it will be way too soon.&quot; Lillard would continue voicing Shaggy in the rest of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; media starting in 2010, at the request of the character&#x27;s original voice actor Casey Kasem, who had stepped down due to health issues; he would also poke fun at this appearance in the following year&#x27;s &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot;, where an animated Shaggy and Scooby voice their grievances over Lillard&#x27;s portrayal during a lunch in the Warner Bros. studio cafeteria and threaten him to portray the character better in the sequel.

Isla Fisher grew up watching &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; in Australia, and said that the &quot;best part of making this movie was being part of an institution, something that has been in people&#x27;s childhoods and is something that means a lot to a lot of people.&quot; Linda Cardellini was also a fan of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography began on February 13, 2001, and wrapped on June 1, 2001. Filming took place throughout Queensland, Australia. Spooky Island was filmed on Tangalooma Island resort in Moreton Island.

=== Soundtrack ===

The film&#x27;s score was composed by David Newman. A soundtrack was released on June 4, 2002, by Atlantic Records. It peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 49 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

== Distribution ==
=== Marketing ===

 On November 16, 2001, the first trailer of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; was released in theaters with the opening of &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot;. A second trailer debuted with the release of &quot;Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Showtime&quot; on March 15, 2002.

A video game based upon the film was released for Game Boy Advance shortly before the film was released. The game is played in third-person point of view and has multiple puzzle games and mini-games. The game&#x27;s structure was similar to a board game. Metacritic rated it 64/100 based on five reviews, which they labeled as &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Meanwhile, Dairy Queen began promoting the film with kids meal toys, frozen cakes and a limited edition Mystery Crunch Blizzard flavor.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on October 11, 2002. The release included deleted scenes, among them an alternate opening animated in the style of the original television series. It was later released on Blu-ray on January 16, 2007. Said Blu-ray was given a double feature pack with its sequel, &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot;, on November 9, 2010.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; debuted with $19.2 million on its opening day and $54.1 million over the weekend from 3,447 theaters, averaging about $15,711 per venue and ranking No. 1 at the box office above &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. At the time, it had the second-highest June opening weekend, behind &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;. During its theatrical run, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; also competed against another family-oriented film, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. The film closed on October 31, 2002, with a final gross of $153 million in the United States and Canada. It made an additional $122 million in other territories, bringing the total worldwide gross to $275.7 million, making it the fifteenth most successful film worldwide of 2002. The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 12, 2002, and topped the country&#x27;s box office for the next two weekends, before being dethroned by &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Scooby Doo&quot; received mostly negative reviews upon release. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 32% based on 147 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Though Lillard is uncannily spot-on as Shaggy, &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; is a tired live-action update, filled with lame jokes.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 35 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one out of four stars, stating that the film &quot;exists in a closed universe, and the rest of us are aliens. The Internet was invented so that you can find someone else&#x27;s review of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. Start surfing.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said, &quot;Get out your pooper-scoopers. &quot;Doo&quot; happens June 14th, warn the ads for &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. And they say there&#x27;s no truth in Hollywood.&quot; Chris Hewitt of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film two out of five stars.

Robin Rauzi of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s half-hour cartoons ever were.&quot; Although Jay Boyar of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; said that children who liked the animated version of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; will &quot;probably like&quot; the film, he urged parents to &quot;know that the violence is a bit harder-edged than in the cartoon version&quot;. He would later go on to say that adults who remember the cartoon version &quot;may get caught up in what Scooby would call the &#x27;rostalgia&#x27;&quot;, but said that &quot;adults who do not fondly recall the Scooby-Doo cartoons are strongly advised to steer clear.&quot; Robert K. Elder of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film 2 and 1/2 stars out of 4 and wrote, &quot;Screenwriter James Gunn gets it mostly right, remaining fiercely faithful to Mystery Inc. mythology, from integrating Scooby&#x27;s annoying nephew Scrappy-Doo to Velma&#x27;s penchant for yelling &#x27;jinkees!&#x27; Unlike the lead balloon adaptation &#x27;Josie and the Pussycats,&#x27; &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; knows when to take itself seriously and when to laugh at itself -- even if its audience isn&#x27;t laughing along at every gag.&quot;

Conversely, Hank Struever of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; gave the film a positive review, stating that &quot;You don&#x27;t want to love this, but you will. Although &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; falls far short of becoming the &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; of Generations X, Y and Z, it is hard to resist in its charms.&quot; Meanwhile, Lillard&#x27;s performance was universally praised.

=== Accolades ===
Gellar won the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy. Prinze was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor (Razzie), but he lost to Hayden Christensen for &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. It was also nominated for another Razzie, Most Flatulent Teen-Targeted Movie, but lost against &quot;&quot;. It won the Kids&#x27; Choice Award for Favorite Fart in a Movie.

=== Legacy ===
Following the retirement of Casey Kasem as the voice of Shaggy, Lillard became the official voice of the character beginning with &quot;Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated&quot;. In the same series, Cardellini voiced the supporting character Hot Dog Water opposite Velma. 

The film and its sequel have developed a cult following since their release, mainly among enthusiasts of James Gunn&#x27;s later work.

== Other media ==
=== Sequel ===
A sequel, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, was released in 2004. A third film was planned, but canceled after the poor critical and financial results of the second.

=== Prequels ===
In 2009 and 2010, two telefilm Prequels, &quot;Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster&quot;, aired on Cartoon Network. In 2018, a direct-to-video film titled &quot;Daphne &amp; Velma&quot;, with no connection to the previous &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; films, was released.

<text>Stanley Lawrence Crouch (December 14, 1945 – September 16, 2020) was an American poet, music and cultural critic, syndicated columnist, novelist, and biographer. He was known for his jazz criticism and his 2000 novel &quot;Don&#x27;t the Moon Look Lonesome?&quot;

== Biography ==
Stanley Lawrence Crouch was born in Los Angeles, the son of James and Emma Bea (Ford) Crouch. He was raised by his mother. In Ken Burns&#x27; 2005 television documentary &quot;Unforgivable Blackness&quot;, Crouch said that his father was a &quot;criminal&quot; and that he once met the boxer Jack Johnson. As a child he was a voracious reader, having read the complete works of Ernest Hemingway, Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and many of the other classics of American literature by the time he finished high school. His mother told him of the experiences of her youth in east Texas and the black culture of the southern midwest, including the Kansas City jazz scene. He became an enthusiast for jazz in both the aesthetic and historical senses. He graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in Los Angeles in 1963. After high school, he attended junior colleges and became active in the civil rights movement, working for the Student Nonviolent Co-ordinating Committee. He was also involved in artistic and educational projects centered on the African-American community of Los Angeles, soon gaining recognition for his poetry. In 1968, he became poet-in-residence at Pitzer College, then taught theatre and literature at Pomona College until 1975. The Watts riots were a pivotal event in his early development as a thinker on racial issues. A quote from the rioting, &quot;Ain&#x27;t no ambulances for no nigguhs tonight&quot;, was used as a title for a polemical speech that advocated black nationalist ideas, released as a recording in 1969; it was also used for a 1972 collection of his poems.

Crouch was then active as a jazz drummer. Together with David Murray, he formed the group Black Music Infinity. In 1975, he sought to further his endeavors with a move from California to New York City, where he shared a loft with Murray above an East Village club called the Tin Palace. He was a drummer for Murray and with other musicians of the underground New York loft jazz scene. While working as a drummer, Crouch conducted the booking for an avant-garde jazz series at the club, as well as organizing occasional concert events at the Ladies&#x27; Fort. By his own admission he was not a good drummer, saying &quot;The problem was that I couldn&#x27;t really play. Since I was doing this avant-garde stuff, I didn&#x27;t have to be all that good, but I was a real knucklehead.&quot;

Crouch befriended Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray, who influenced his thinking in a direction less centered on race. He stated with regard to Murray&#x27;s influence, &quot;I saw how important it is to free yourself from ideology. When you look at things solely in terms of race or class, you miss what is really going on.&quot; He made a final, public break with black nationalist ideology in 1979, in an exchange with Amiri Baraka in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;. He was also emerging as a public critic of recent cultural and artistic trends that he saw as empty, phony, or corrupt. His targets included the fusion and avant-garde movements in jazz (including his own participation in the latter) and literature that he saw as hiding their lack of merit behind racial posturing. As a writer for the &quot;Voice&quot; from 1980 to 1988, he was known for his blunt criticisms of his targets and tendency to excoriate their participants. It was during this period that he became a friend and intellectual mentor to Wynton Marsalis, and an advocate of the neotraditionalist movement that he saw as reviving the core values of jazz. In 1987, he became an artistic consultant for the Jazz at Lincoln Center program, joined by Marsalis, who later became artistic director, in 1991.

After his stint at the &quot;Voice&quot;, Crouch published &quot;Notes of a Hanging Judge: Essays and Reviews, 1979–1989&quot;, which was selected by &quot;The Encyclopædia Britannica Yearbook&quot; as the best book of essays published in 1990. That was followed by receipt of a Whiting Award in 1991, and a MacArthur Foundation &quot;genius&quot; grant and the Jean Stein Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1993.

Crouch continued to be an active author, producing works of fiction and nonfiction, articles for periodicals and newspaper columns. He was a columnist for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and a syndicated columnist. He also participated as a source in documentaries and as a guest in televised discussions. During the 2000s he was a featured commentator on &quot;Ken Burns&#x27; Jazz&quot; (2001) and &quot;Unforgivable Blackness&quot; (2005), on the life of the boxer Jack Johnson. He also published the novel &quot;Don&#x27;t The Moon Look Lonesome?&quot; (2000), a collection of his reviews and writings on jazz, &quot;Considering Genius&quot; (2007), and a biography of the jazz musician Charlie Parker, &quot;Kansas City Lightning&quot; (2013). His posthumous collection &quot;Victory Is Assured&quot; (2022) was edited by Glenn Mott.

Crouch became less of a public figure due to declining health during his last decade. He died on September 16, 2020, at Calvary Hospital in New York City. The cause of death was a &quot;long, unspecified illness,&quot; though he also struggled with a bout of COVID-19 in the spring. He was 74.

Crouch&#x27;s personal and professional papers are held by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library.

== Personal life ==
Crouch lived in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn.

==Opinions==
As a political thinker, Crouch was initially drawn to, then became disillusioned with, the Black Power movement of the late 1960s. His critiques of his former co-thinkers, whom he refers to as a &quot;lost generation&quot;, are collected in &quot;Notes of a Hanging Judge: Essays and Reviews, 1979–1989&quot; and &quot;The All-American Skin Game, or, The Decoy of Race: The Long and the Short of It, 1990–1994&quot;. He identified the embrace of racial essentialism among African-American leaders and intellectuals as a diversion from issues more central to the betterment of African Americans and society as a whole. In the 1990s, he upset many political thinkers when he declared himself a &quot;radical pragmatist&quot;. He explained, &quot;I affirm whatever I think has the best chance of working, of being both inspirational and unsentimental, of reasoning across the categories of false division and beyond the decoy of race&quot;.

In his syndicated column for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Crouch frequently criticized prominent African Americans. Crouch was critical of, among others: Alex Haley, the author of &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; and &quot;&quot;; community leader Al Sharpton; filmmaker Spike Lee; scholar Cornel West, and poet and playwright Amiri Baraka.

Crouch was also a fierce critic of gangsta rap music, asserting that it promotes violence, criminal lifestyles, and degrading attitudes toward women. With this viewpoint, he defended Bill Cosby&#x27;s &quot;Pound Cake Speech&quot; and praised a women&#x27;s group at Spelman College for speaking out against rap music. With regard to rapper Tupac Shakur he wrote, &quot;what dredged-up scum you are willing to pay for is what scum you get, on or off stage.&quot;

From the late 1970s, Crouch was critical of forms of jazz that diverge from what he regarded as its essential core values, similar to the opinions of Albert Murray on the same topic. In jazz critic Alex Henderson&#x27;s assessment, Crouch was a &quot;rigid jazz purist&quot; and &quot;a blistering critic of avant-garde jazz and fusion&quot;. Crouch commented: &quot;We should laugh at those who make artistic claims for fusion.&quot;

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot; Robert Boynton wrote: &quot;Enthusiastic, combative, and never averse to attention, Crouch has a virtually insatiable appetite for controversy.&quot; Boynton also observed: &quot;Few cultural critics have a vision as eclectic and intriguing as Stanley Crouch&#x27;s. Fewer still actually fight to prove their points.&quot; Crouch was fired from &quot;JazzTimes&quot; following his controversial article &quot;Putting the White Man in Charge&quot; in which he stated that, since the 1960s, &quot;white musicians who can play are too frequently elevated far beyond their abilities in order to allow white writers to make themselves feel more comfortable about being in the role of evaluating an art from which they feel substantially alienated.&quot;

==Association with Wynton Marsalis and Ken Burns==
Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis called Crouch &quot;my best friend in the world&quot; and &quot;mentor&quot;. The two met after Marsalis, at the age of 17, settled in New York City to attend the Juilliard School. The two shared a close relationship, Crouch having written liner notes for Marsalis&#x27; albums since his debut album in 1982.

When Marsalis served as &quot;Senior Creative Consultant&quot; for Ken Burns&#x27; 2001 documentary &quot;Jazz&quot;, Crouch served on the film&#x27;s advisory board and appears extensively. Some jazz critics and aficionados cited the participation of Marsalis and Crouch specifically as reasons for what they believed to be the film&#x27;s undue focus on traditional and straight-ahead jazz.

After &quot;Jazz&quot;, Crouch appeared in other Burns films, including the DVD for the 2002 remastered version of &quot;The Civil War&quot; and the 2004 documentary &quot;Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson&quot;.

==Awards, honors, distinctions==
*In 2004, Crouch was invited to a panel of judges for the PEN/Newman&#x27;s Own Award, a $25,000 award designed to protect speech as it applies to the written word.
*In 2005, he was selected as one of the inaugural fellows by the Fletcher Foundation, which awards annual fellowships to people working on issues of race and civil rights and directed by Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. of Harvard University.
*In 2005, Crouch was named Man Of The Year by Patrick Lynch of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York for being &quot;as bold in his support for New York City police officers as he is in his condemnation of the city’s “cheapskate” attitude in compensating the men and women who risk their lives every day to keep New York City safe and civil&quot;, which awards annual awards to men who perform acts of political allyship towards policing as a construct and has been presided over by Patrick J. Lynch since 1999.
*Crouch served as president of the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation from 2009 on.
*In 2016, Crouch was awarded the Windham–Campbell Literature Prize (nonfiction).

<text>Apollo abort modes were procedures by which the nominal launch of an Apollo spacecraft, either the Saturn IB or Saturn V rocket, could be terminated. The abort of the flight allowed for the rescue of the crew if the rocket failed catastrophically. Depending on how far the flight had progressed, different procedure or modes would be used. In the history of the Apollo Program, none of the abort modes were ever used on any of the fifteen crewed Apollo spacecraft flights.

Houston&#x27;s announcements of the current abort mode and the spacecraft commander&#x27;s acknowledgements were among the few things said on the radio link during the first minutes of flight.

If the rocket failed during the first phases of the flight, the Emergency Detection System (EDS) would automatically give the command to abort. The reason is that life-threatening situations can develop too fast for humans to discuss and react to. In the later, less violent phases of the ascent, the EDS was turned off and an abort would have to be initiated manually.

==Overview==

Of the five abort modes, the modes up to three (III) are variations of jettisoning the entire rocket followed by an immediate landing in the sea (splashdown). Mode four (IV) and the Saturn V-specific modes are variations of jettisoning only the failing rocket stage, using the other stages to continue into Earth orbit. Once there, a backup Earth-orbit mission could be performed so that the flight was not entirely in vain. In all cases, the Command Module (CM) with the astronauts performs a splashdown by: 
* Dumping the hypergolic fuel overboard since the toxic substance would be an unnecessary risk to recovery personnel.
* If high enough, deploying high-speed parachutes (drogue parachute).
* Jettisoning the drogues and deploying the main parachutes.
* Splashing down in the sea and waiting for recovery team to arrive

== Pad abort ==
If the rocket failed in the last five minutes before launch, the CM and the launch escape system (LES, see figure) would separate from the remainder of the rocket below with the LES propelling itself and the CM beneath it upward and eastward to the sea using a small solid-fueled motor (the launch escape motor) at the top of the tower on the launch escape system. The launch escape tower would then be jettisoned in anticipation of the parachute deployment and the CM would splash down. (Preparation for a pad abort is seen in Apollo video footage: five minutes before launch, the umbilical arm connecting to the CM retracts and swings clear of the rocket. It does so because the swing arm must be out of the way in case the EDS decides to abort.)

Two tests of the LES were conducted:

*Pad Abort Test-1: Launch Escape System (LES) abort test from launch pad with Apollo Boilerplate BP-6.
*Pad Abort Test-2: LES pad abort test of near Block-I CM with Apollo Boilerplate B-23A.

== Mode I ==
An abort using the LES, this abort mode could be conducted from launch until the LES was jettisoned 30 seconds after the ignition of the second stage.

=== Mode IA (one alpha) ===
During the first 42 seconds of flight for the Saturn V or 60 seconds of the flight for the Saturn IB, the rocket is still relatively upright and an abort is much like a pad abort, lasting up to . During the abort, the main pitch control motors move the CM out of the flight path of the possibly exploding rocket. At 14 seconds into the abort, the LES is jettisoned in the lead up to the splashdown.

=== Mode IB (one bravo) ===
From to 30.5 km (100,000 ft), the rocket is tilted eastwards far enough that firing the pitch control motor is unnecessary. After the LES main motor moves the CM away from the rocket, the tower would deploy canards (small wings at the tip). They would force the CM-LES combination to pitch over with the CM bottom forward (blunt-end forward or BEF attitude.) This was necessary because the parachutes stowed at the CM top were only designed to be deployed in a downwind direction.

=== Mode IC (one charlie) ===
From 30.5 km (100,000 ft) until the LES is jettisoned, pitching the CM-LES combination over into the CM-forward position would still be necessary, but in the now thin air the canards are useless. Instead, the small engines of the CM&#x27;s reaction control system (RCS) would do the job. During One-Charlie, the first staging occurs, that is the jettisoning of the spent first stage and ignition of the second stage. One-Charlie ceases about 30 seconds after the staging when the LES is jettisoned, at an altitude of about 90 km (295,000 ft or 55 miles).

== Mode II ==
With the LES jettisoned, the Command/Service Module (CSM) would separate as a whole from the rocket and use its large engine and RCS engines to move clear of the rocket and align itself. The CM would then separate from the Service Module (SM) and splash down.

== Mode III ==
A Mode III type abort would be used when a Mode II type would risk the spacecraft coming down over land, or landing in the cold water of the North Atlantic. The CSM would separate from the rocket in the same manner as a Mode II abort, but would additionally use the SPS engine to make either a posigrade burn (&quot;Mode IIIA&quot;) or retrograde burn (&quot;Mode IIIB&quot;) to land in a specific area on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Mode III was only available as a primary abort mode for 10–15 seconds during a Saturn IB launch and was only used as a backup abort mode for Saturn V launches, in case of an abort requiring the immediate landing of the spacecraft.

== Mode IV ==
Mode IV was an abort mode that occurred during the S-IVB burn. Should the S-IVB fail, the Service Module engine can place the CSM into Earth orbit to perform an Earth-orbit mission.

== Mode V ==
A Mode V abort was only planned for use during the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project launch. In the event of an early S-IVB shutdown, the CSM RCS thrusters would be used to insert the entire stack (including the docking adapter) into orbit. The time window for a Mode V abort was only 1.5 seconds before nominal S-IVB cutoff.

== Saturn V specific abort modes ==
During orbital abort phases (S-IVB to COI, S-IVB to orbit and Mode IV), modes II and III were available as backup modes in the event of further problems.

The EDS was enabled for the pad abort (beginning 5 minutes prior to launch) through abort mode IB phases. Beginning in mode IC, the EDS was switched off and aborts would have had to be commanded manually.

=== S-IVB to COI ===
(&quot;Saturn IV-B (NASA&#x27;s designation for the Saturn V&#x27;s third stage burn) To Contingency Orbit Insertion&quot;) In case of a failure of the S-II second stage, the stage would be jettisoned, and the rocket is high and fast enough that the S-IVB third stage, followed by the Service Module (SM) engine, has enough propellant to place the spacecraft in Earth orbit. There would not be enough propellant to perform trans-lunar injection, so only an Earth-orbit mission would be performed.

=== S-IVB to Orbit ===
The failing S-II would again be jettisoned, but Earth orbit insertion is now possible by the S-IVB alone. Other than not using the SM engine, this is identical to an S-IVB to COI abort.

<text>&quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot; (&quot;&#x27;&quot; or &quot;&#x27;&quot;) is a popular song. The original text was written by (1791–1877).
The present tune was composed by shortly after World War II. The work is often mistaken for a German folk song, but it is an original composition. Möller&#x27;s sister Edith conducted a small amateur children&#x27;s and youth choir in the district of Schaumburg, Lower Saxony, Germany, internationally named Obernkirchen Children&#x27;s Choir, in Germany named . She adapted Sigismund&#x27;s words for her choir.

In 1953, a BBC radio broadcast of the choir&#x27;s winning performance at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod turned the song into an instant hit. On 22 January 1954 the song entered the UK singles chart and stayed on the chart—only a Top 12 at the time—for 26 non-consecutive weeks, peaking at Number 2 (for five consecutive weeks). Another version by the British vocal ensemble The Stargazers reached number 12 in April of 1954.

The amateur choir, many of whose original members were war orphans, turned into an international phenomenon in the following years. The group performed on many international tours under the name Obernkirchen Children&#x27;s Choir and recorded several albums. They made two appearances on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (29 November 1964 and 11 December 1966).

Die Isarspatzen, Herbert Beckh und das Tanzorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks Munich have recorded a German version of the song &quot;Der fröhliche Wanderer&quot;. Electrola released that recording in 1955 as catalog number EG 8082.

The song&#x27;s German lyrics have been translated into several languages, and it has since become a choir classic. The first adaptation into another language was done by a Belgian woman, Andrée Mazy, who translated it into Dutch-Flemish and French. Since in Dutch folk songs &quot;valderi-valdera&quot; (pronounced &quot;falderi-faldera&quot;) is more common than the German &quot;falleri-fallera&quot;, she used the Dutch model in both versions. When Antonia Ridge was writing the English lyrics, she became acquainted with the French version of the song, with &quot;valderi-valdera&quot;, pronounced with a true soft /v/ instead of the voiceless /f/, and used it in the English version mainly for euphonic reasons (less military sounding). During WWII, a more military version of the song became immensely popular with the German paratroopers. Although Friedrich-Wilhelm Möller reportedly composed &quot;&quot; shortly after World War II, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1993 historical drama film, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, set during the war, contains a scene in which a group is singing the tune, mixed with another German folk song, in a nightclub during that war.

Milton Delugg wrote an arrangement and is sometimes incorrectly credited as the composer of the song. A number of English-language sources credit Edith Möller and Florenz Siegesmund with writing the words, the implication being (apparently) that they were written at the same time as the tune. However, the German sources all credit the original words to either Friedrich Sigismund, F. Sigismund, or Florenz Friedrich Sigismund and give the dates as either 1788–1857 or early 19th century. All German sources agree that the words to the popular version were adapted by Edith Möller.

The song also became the unofficial anthem of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Montreal Expos (since relocated to become the Washington Nationals).

&quot;The Happy Wanderer&quot; was selected as the winner of Trinidad&#x27;s 1955 Road March title, awarded to the song which was most played by steelbands during that year&#x27;s Trinidad and Tobago Carnival season. It was the only time a non-calypso song had been awarded this honour.

<text>Jale was a Canadian alternative rock band from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Contemporaries of Sloan and The Super Friendz, they formed in 1992 and was part of the Halifax Pop Explosion scene in the 1990s. They released three records as a band (the albums &quot;Dreamcake&quot; and &quot;So Wound&quot; and the EP &quot;Closed&quot;) before disbanding in 1996.

==Career==
Jale was formed by four art school students in 1992. The guitarist Jennifer Pierce had earlier sung backing vocals on the album &quot;Smeared&quot; by Sloan. The other founders were Alyson MacLeod (drums), Laura Stein (bass guitar) and Eve Hartling (guitar). The band&#x27;s name was formed from the first letters of the members&#x27; first names.

Jale was one of the first two Canadian bands (with Eric&#x27;s Trip) to be signed to Seattle record label Sub Pop, at a time when the music industry turned their attention to the East Coast following the success of Seattle&#x27;s grunge music. Their debut album, &quot;Dreamcake&quot;, was released by Sub Pop in 1994. Two music videos were made, &quot;Promise (Jimmybeam Majestic Version)&quot;, directed by Tyran George, and &quot;Not Happy&quot;.

In the summer of 1995, the band released the &quot;Closed&quot; EP on local label Murderecords. Music videos were released for the songs &quot;Double Edge&quot;, &quot;Long Way Home&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot;. The EP would be the last record featuring drummer Alyson MacLeod, who left Jale to join The Hardship Post. Mike Belitsky of the alt-country band The Sadies replaced MacLeod as drummer.

In November 1995, Jale regrouped to record their second and final album, &quot;So Wound&quot;, in Chicago. The band released a music video for the single &quot;All Ready&quot;. &quot;So Wound&quot; was a consciously more power pop album than &quot;Dreamcake&quot; and received critical praise. However, Sub Pop pulled support for the album while the band was on tour. Only a few months after the release of &quot;So Wound&quot;, Jale disbanded.

Pierce, Stein and Belitsky continued as The Vees. They toured Canada twice and released an EP, &quot;The Vees&quot;, on the Halifax label Murderecords in 1997. The band stopped performing the following year. Pierce, Stein and Belitsky resurfaced in 2000 as Chappaquiddick Skyline, a side project of the Massachusetts-based Pernice Brothers, and released an album, Chappaquiddick Skyline. Stein and Belitsky later appeared on the Pernice Brothers&#x27; albums &quot;The World Won&#x27;t End&quot; (2001) and &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; (2003). Stein and Pierce are also listed as vocalists on &quot;Who Will You Believe&quot; (2024). 

All members of the band worked on photography and graphic design of posters, album artwork and art direction for music videos. Hartling was nominated for a Juno award in 1997 for her design of &quot;So Wound&quot;. She continued to paint, and after exhibiting her work in group shows in Halifax over several years, had her first solo show in 2005. Hartling lives and works in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Stein went on to become a graphic designer, first in New York City, balancing design and touring as keyboardist with Pernice Brothers. She later joined Sid Lee, a creative services firm, at their Toronto office. She is now CCO at Bruce Mau Design in Toronto.

In December 2024, Pierce released a six song EP, &quot;Unsuitable,&quot; as Jenny &amp; the Tide. Released on Bandcamp, the EP showcases the exceptional talent of a group of Haligonian musicians.

<text>Paul Avrich (August 4, 1931 – February 16, 2006) was an American historian specializing in the 19th and early 20th-century anarchist movement in Russia and the United States. He taught at Queens College, City University of New York, for his entire career, from 1961 to his retirement as distinguished professor of history in 1999. He wrote ten books, mostly about anarchism, including topics such as the 1886 Haymarket Riot, the 1921 Sacco and Vanzetti case, the 1921 Kronstadt naval base rebellion, and an oral history of the movement in the United States.

As an ally of the movement&#x27;s major figures, he sought to challenge the portrayal of anarchists as amoral and violent, and collected papers from these figures that he donated as a 20,000-item collection to the Library of Congress.

== Early and personal life ==
Paul Avrich was born August 4, 1931, in Brooklyn to parents of Jewish and Ukrainian heritage from Odessa. His parents – Rose (née Zapol) Avrich and Murray Avrich – were a Yiddish theater actress and a dress manufacturer, respectively. In the early 1950s, he served in the Korean War with the U.S. Air Force. Avrich completed his undergraduate studies at Cornell University in 1952, and his graduate studies at Columbia University in 1961. His doctoral dissertation addressed the labor movement in the Russian Revolution. Avrich was among the first American exchange students to study in the Soviet Union when it opened during the Khrushchev Thaw. Anarchists he met through his research into the anarchist Yiddish newspaper &quot;Freie Arbeiter Stimme&quot; sparked his interest in the movement. He later named his cats after Mikhail Bakunin and Piotr Kropotkin. Avrich was married and had two daughters and a sister.

== Career ==
As a teacher and historian of the anarchist movement, Avrich had sympathy and affection for the cause and became a trusted colleague of its major figures. Accordingly, he sought to communicate to his students an affection and solidarity for anarchists &quot;as people, rather than as militants&quot; and challenged the perception of anarchists as amoral and violent. He wanted his work to resurrect the thought of marginalized anarchists, whom he saw as &quot;pioneers of social justice&quot; worth revisiting in the revival of libertarianism following the Vietnam War and second-wave feminism.

Avrich joined Queens College as a Russian history instructor in 1961, where he remained for the duration of his career, though he also was a member of the City University of New York Graduate Center faculty. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Russian history in 1967 and a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship in 1972. When named a distinguished professor of history in 1982, his announcement quoted him: &quot;Every good person deep down is an anarchist.&quot; He retired in 1999. Avrich collected books, photos, and papers from key anarchists and donated a 20,000-item collection to the Library of Congress. He died on February 16, 2006, in Manhattan&#x27;s Mount Sinai Hospital from complications due to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

His Soviet research and documents on the suppressed Kronstadt insurrection led to several books on anarchists in the Russian revolution, including &quot;Kronstadt, 1921&quot;. He interviewed Soviet exiles in New York, where he first met members of the &quot;Freie Arbeiter Stimme&quot;. Avrich then moved to major figures in American anarchism and published a book in 1980 on the Ferrer Schools inspired by Francisco Ferrer. His 1984 book on the Haymarket Riot won the Philip Taft Labor History Book Award, and his 1991 book on Sacco and Vanzetti presented the pair as revolutionaries rather than philosophical anarchists. Avrich&#x27;s last book, in 1995, compiled 30 years of interviews across the anarchist movement. Several of his works were nominated for Pulitzer Prizes.

<doc id="1072105" wikidata="Q2300729" url="?curid=1072105" title="Warmachine">
<text>Warmachine is a tabletop steampunk wargame originally produced by Privateer Press but currently under the ownership of Steamforged Games.

The game is played with white metal, plastic, and resin miniatures representing military characters from the Iron Kingdoms setting. Battles are fought between warcasters from rival nations, the large steam-powered warjacks that the warcasters control, and troops consisting of humans and fantasy races.

&quot;Warmachine&quot; has been the recipient of the 2003 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy Miniatures Rules and Best Fantasy Miniatures Series. In 2005 &quot;Warmachine&quot; won Game of the Year at Origins and Gamers Choice for Best Miniatures.

A compatible companion game involving the savage factions named &quot;Hordes&quot; was released in 2006. The Hordes branding has since been retired with the launch of the MKIV edition.

In 2024 Steamforged Games announced, that they have bought the IP of Warmachine and the Iron Kingdoms.

== Overview ==
&quot;Warmachine&quot;″s most distinctive feature is the inclusion of Warcasters and Warjacks (the war machines from which the game derives its name). Warjacks, or &#x27;jacks&#x27; for short, are techno-steam powered constructs designed for waging war. They are, in general, powered by a coal-burning steam engine and guided by an arcane supercomputer-like &quot;brain&quot; called a cortex. Heavily armored and often carrying oversized weaponry, &#x27;jacks fill a role similar to traditional military armor such as tanks and artillery. They are several times more durable and powerful than normal troops, but are far more costly.

Warcasters are the pivotal characters of the game. They are powerful generals and spellcasters who have learned to control warjacks as well as serve multiple other roles. In addition to guiding the warjacks&#x27; destructive power, they are the army commanders, potent combatants, and powerful spellcasters. Each has a special feat that can be used once per battle; their effects range from subtle to explosive and can be enough to alter the tide of battle.

In addition to warcasters and warjacks, armies can field supporting infantry troops of many varieties, powerful machines of war called battle engines, durable structures that support their infantry troops, and even more massive versions of warjacks known as colossals. Some are infantry or gunners, while others have more specialized roles, from warjack repairmen to &quot;journeyman&quot; warcasters—novice versions of the models that command armies. Most of these troops come in groups and move in formations, but there are also independent characters called solos.

In the first major expansion, &quot;Warmachine: Wrath&quot;, battle engines were introduced. Battle engines are huge mechanical constructs that are not warjacks and thus do not require focus. Each faction has one battle engine available at the moment.

The second major expansion, &quot;Warmachine: Colossals&quot;, gave each faction towering warjacks known as Colossals. Taking a role similar to a battleship, each Colossal is heavily armed and capable of dealing and receiving large amounts of damage. Their powerful presence is balanced by their high cost to include them in an army, making the loss of a Colossal during the course of a game a heavy loss of resources.

The third major expansion, &quot;Warmachine: Vengeance&quot;, added new Epic versions of older warlords, as well as new units, solos and warjacks. The new journeyman warcasters introduced with the video game &quot;Warmachine: Tactics&quot; (see below) were also added.

Most recently, through the CID or Community Integrated Development process, a new model type has been added called structures. These immobile models often deploy far ahead of normal forces, but may not change positions throughout the game, and provide a powerful, if situational, bonus to your army. Stationed atop the largest base size in the game, these massive buildings can be seen from anywhere on the battlefield, making them tempting targets, but often powerful fortifications.

In June 2024, it was announced that Steamforged Games had acquired the Iron Kingdoms brand, which includes Warmachine and related other titles.

== Gameplay ==

The overall gameplay is supposed to encourage aggression rather than defensive tactics, such as sitting behind fortifications. This was referred to among players and the game&#x27;s developers as &#x27;Page 5&#x27; in previous versions of the game, however in the &quot;Mark 3&quot; rules, the company has pushed into a more balanced direction with regards to both aggressive versus controlling strategies, and the previous performative masculine rhetoric.

&quot;Warmachine&quot; is similar to many other miniature wargames in that each army consists of several units, each of which acts during a turn. Individual units move, attack, and may perform other actions such as repairing a warjack or using a feat. The primary mechanic unique to &quot;Warmachine&quot; is the use of focus points. Each warcaster receives a certain number of focus points each turn, which represents that warcaster&#x27;s power. At the beginning of the turn, focus may be spent to pay for ongoing abilities and allocated between the warlord and &#x27;jacks in the caster&#x27;s battlegroup within their &quot;Control Area&quot; or sphere of influence - a distance based on the &#x27;caster&#x27;s focus stat. Focus allows warjacks to become more accurate and powerful by &quot;boosting&quot; their attacks, and to perform special actions called &quot;Power Attacks&quot; such as slamming a model across the battlefield with their heft or throwing an enemy model at another model. Additionally warcasters can use focus to cast spells performing all manner of arcane effects from attacks, to movement bonuses, to offensive/defensive enhancements. Good focus management can often be the difference between winning and losing. The warcaster is the single most important model on either side in the game. If a player&#x27;s warcaster is killed, they lose the game, no matter how many casualties, or how much damage, they have inflicted on the enemy.

== Releases ==

The first book, &quot;Warmachine: Prime&quot;, was originally released in 2003, with a revised edition, &quot;Warmachine: Prime Remix&quot;, released in early 2007. All of the subsequent books have been expansions of &quot;Prime&quot;. Each expansion usually introduces new warcasters, warjacks, units, and solos, as well as new model subtypes – such as cavalry units – that add new strategies and complexities to each faction. With the release of Mk II, all previous books models have been folded into the new &quot;Forces of Warmachine&quot; series.

===Mark I Warmachine===
:*&quot;Warmachine: Prime&quot; – 2003
:*&quot;Warmachine: Escalation&quot; – 2004
:*&quot;Warmachine: Apotheosis&quot; – 2005
:*&quot;Warmachine: Superiority&quot; – 2006
:*&quot;Warmachine: Prime Remix&quot; – 2007
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Pirates of the Broken Coast&quot; – 2007
:*&quot;Warmachine: Legends&quot; – 2008

Mk II is a complete reworking of the game, with every model available changed and/or recosted, alongside the changes to the rules set. The cards for all models from the Mk I line are also available for purchase as Faction Decks as of January 2010, as is a new template set.

===Mark II Warmachine===
:*&quot;Warmachine: Prime Mk II&quot; – January 2010
:*&quot;Warmachine: Wrath&quot; – June 2011
:*&quot;Warmachine: Colossals&quot; – July 2012
:*&quot;Warmachine: Vengeance&quot; – March 2014
:*&quot;Warmachine: Reckoning&quot; – June 2015

*&quot;Forces of Warmachine&quot; is the name of a series of expansions that each focus on a themed army, as opposed to having additions to all of the factions.
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Retribution of Scyrah&quot; – 2009
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Cygnar&quot; – February 2010
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Khador&quot; – March 2010
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Protectorate of Menoth&quot; – April 2010
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Cryx&quot; – June 2010
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Mercenaries&quot; – July 2010
:*&quot;Forces of Warmachine: Convergence of Cyriss&quot; – July 2013

Mark III (referred to as &quot;All New War&quot; by Privateer Press) is another reworking of the game. As with MK II all models and point levels of army lists have been updated. &quot;Privateer Press&quot; has begun the Community Integrated Development or CID process to involve players in the development of errata, new releases, and theme forces as a quality control mechanism in what they are calling a &quot;continuous development&quot; goal. The idea of this process is to avoid new version releases following Mark 3. As a result, all model cards and the base rules set are available on the Privateer Press website.

===Mark III Warmachine===
:*&quot;Warmachine: Prime Mk III&quot; – June 2016

In July 2017 new faction was released: Grymkin (limited release, not limited edition). This was first step to prepare to the next global event.

In July 2018 the next limited release faction appeared—the Crucible Guard.

In October 2019 new global campaign started, forming new alliances to resist invading new faction of daemons—Infernals.

In December 2019 a new Twitter account @HengeholdScroll started to report what was going on the battlefield, revealing character motivations and relations.

===WARMACHINE: MKIV===

In July 2022, WARMACHINE: MKIV was announced. Support for this edition began in January 2023. MKIV introduced a roughly 10 year time jump, which saw many existing factions and characters change drastically. All pre-MKIV models are now out of print from the publisher. 

The out of print Legacy armies have received updated rules, and all models can be played in the new edition. The rules for the game are provided for free through the Warmachine app. 

The new WARMACHINE: MKIV armies are Cygnar Storm Legion, Khador Winter Korps, Dusk House Kallyss, Orgoth Sea Raiders, Southern Kriels Brineblood Marauders, and Khymaera Shadowflame Shard. New models are mostly made with 3D printing technology.

==&quot;Warmachine: Tactics&quot;==

On August 14, 2009, Privateer Press announced they were in the beginning stages of development for a &quot;Warmachine&quot; video game. The contract is with WhiteMoon Dreams, a small Los Angeles based video games company. WhiteMoon Dreams is an indie game developer with programmers with experience working on hit titles such as the &quot;Fallout&quot; series, &quot;Myth 3&quot;, &quot;Flower&quot;, the &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; series, and the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series.

On July 10, 2013, Privateer Press launched a Kickstarter project to aid development of this game now titled &quot;Warmachine: Tactics&quot;, ultimately raising a total of $1,578,950.

On July 9, 2014, the game was released on Steam under the Early Access program, meaning that people can buy and play the game while it is still in development and enjoy updates as they are released.

The developers had initially aimed for a full release in August 2014, but by that date the game remained in early access, with only the online multiplayer available and the game still not having fully implemented all the models to be included in the full general release. By early November 2014 all models to be included in the full release were available for use in online multiplayer, with the full 21 mission single player campaign released at the end of the same month.

== &quot;Grind&quot;==

&quot;Grind&quot; is an arena sports/combat board game published by Privateer Press in 2009 set the Warmachine universe in which each player tries to maneuver a giant spiked ball into their opponent&#x27;s goal using warjacks. It was designed by Duncan Huffman, Doug Seacat, Jason Soles, Rob Stoddard, and Matt Wilson. Each player customizes each steamjack&#x27;s weaponry, and then places all five steamjacks anywhere on their side of the board. Like ice hockey, the object is to hit the grinder ball into the opposition goal while bodychecking opposition figurines out of the way.

<doc id="1072124" wikidata="Q1539356" url="?curid=1072124" title="Gorget">
<text>A gorget ( ; from the French &quot;&quot; meaning &#x27;throat&#x27;) was a band of linen wrapped around a woman&#x27;s neck and head in the medieval period or the lower part of a simple chaperon hood. The term later described a steel or leather collar to protect the throat, a set of pieces of plate armour, or a single piece of plate armour hanging from the neck and covering the throat and chest. Later, particularly from the 18th century, the gorget became primarily ornamental, serving as a symbolic accessory on military uniforms, a use which has survived in some armies (see below).

The term may also be used for other things such as items of jewellery worn around the throat region in several societies, for example wide thin gold collars found in prehistoric Ireland dating to the Bronze Age.

==As part of armour==

In the High Middle Ages, when mail was the primary form of metal body armour used in Western Europe, the mail coif protected the neck and lower face. In this period, the term &quot;gorget&quot; seemingly referred to textile (padded) protection for the neck, often worn over mail. As more plate armour appeared to supplement mail during the 14th century, the bascinet helmet incorporated a mail curtain called the aventail which protected the lower face, neck and shoulders. A separate mail collar called a &quot;pisan&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; was sometimes worn under the aventail as additional protection. Towards the end of the 14th century, threats including the increased penetrating power of the lance when paired with a lance rest on the breastplate made more rigid forms of neck protection desirable. One solution was a standing collar plate separate from the helmet that could be worn over the aventail, with enough space between the collar and helmet that a man-at-arms could turn his head inside it. In the early 15th century, such collar plates were integrated into the helmet itself to form the great bascinet. Other forms of helmet such as the sallet which did not protect the lower face and throat with plate were paired with a separate bevor, and the armet was often fitted with a wrapper that included gorget lames protecting the throat. The mail standard was still worn under such bevors and wrappers, since the plates did not cover the back or sides of the neck.

At the beginning of the 16th century, the gorget reached its full development as a component of plate armour. Unlike previous gorget plates and bevors which sat over the cuirass and also required a separate mail collar to fully protect the neck, the developed gorget was worn under the cuirass and was intended to cover a larger area of the neck, nape, shoulders and upper chest, from which the edges of the backplate and breastplate had receded. The gorget served as an anchor point for the pauldrons, which either had holes in them to engage pins projecting from the gorget, or straps which could be buckled to the gorget. The neck was protected by a high collar of articulated , and the entire gorget was divided into front and back pieces which were hinged at the side so that the gorget could be put on and taken off. Some helmets had additional neck lames which overlapped the gorget, while others formed a tight seal with the rim of the gorget to eliminate any gaps.

By the 17th century there appeared a form of gorget with a low, unarticulated collar and larger front and back plates which covered more of the upper chest and back. In addition to being worn under the breast &amp; backplates, as evidenced by at least two contemporary engravings, they were also commonly worn over civilian clothing or a buff coat. Some gorgets of this period were &quot;parade&quot; pieces that were beautifully etched, gilded, engraved, chased, embossed or enameled at great expense. Gradually the gorget grew smaller and more symbolic, becoming a single crescent shape worn on a chain which suspended the gorget ever lower on the chest, so that the gorget no longer protected the throat in normal wear.

The Japanese (samurai) form of the &quot;gorget&quot;, called a nodowa, was either fastened by itself around the neck or came as an integral part of the face defence or &quot;men yoroi&quot;. It consisted of several lames made of lacquered leather or iron, each of which either consisted of one piece or of scales laced together in horizontal rows. The lames were articulated vertically, overlapping bottom to top, by another set of silk laces.

==As part of military uniforms==

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, crescent-shaped gorgets of silver or silver gilt were worn by officers, mainly infantry, in most European armies, as a badge of rank and an indication that they were on duty. These last vestiges of armour were much smaller (usually about in width) than their Medieval predecessors and were suspended by cords, chains or ribbons. In the British service they carried the Royal coat of arms until 1796 and thereafter the Royal Cypher. During the reign of Napoleon I, the French ones carried often a design with the imperial eagle, the regimental number, a hunting horn or a flaming grenade, but non-regulation designs were not uncommon. 
Gorgets ceased to be worn by British army officers in 1830 and by their French counterparts 20 years later. They were still worn to a limited extent in the Imperial German Army until 1914, as a special distinction by officers of the Prussian Gardes du Corps and the 2nd Cuirassiers &quot;Queen&quot;. Officers of the Spanish infantry continued to wear gorgets with the cypher of King Alfonso XIII in full dress, until the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1931. Mexican Federal army officers also wore the gorget with the badge of their branch as part of their parade uniform until 1947.

The gorget was revived as a uniform accessory in Nazi Germany, seeing widespread use within the German military and Nazi party organisations, mainly units with a police function and their flag bearers. During World War II, it continued to be used by &quot;Feldgendarmerie&quot; (military field police), who wore metal gorgets as emblems of authority. German police gorgets of this period typically took the form of flat metal crescents with ornamental designs that were suspended by a chain worn around the neck. These designs and lettering were painted with illuminating paint.

The Prussian-influenced Chilean army uses the German style metal gorget in parades and in the uniform of their Military Police.

===In Sweden===
As early as 1688, regulations were provided for the wearing of gorgets by Swedish army officers. For those of captain&#x27;s rank the gorget was gilt with the king&#x27;s monogram under a crown in blue enamel, while more junior officers wore silver-plated gorgets with the initials in gold.

The gorget was discontinued as a rank insignia for Swedish officers in the Swedish Armed Forces in 1792, when epaulettes were introduced. The gorget was revived in 1799, when the Officer of the day was given the privilege of wearing a gorget which featured the Swedish lesser coat of arms. It has since been a part of the officer&#x27;s uniform (when he or she functions as &quot;Officer of the day&quot;) a custom which continues.

===In Norway and Finland===
The same use of the gorget also continues in Norway and Finland, worn by officers or corporals responsible for guard changes and &quot;Inspecting Officers&quot; (officer of the day). The officer of the day of a company (Finnish: &quot;päivystäjä&quot;) is usually a non-commissioned officer (or even a private), who guards the entrance and is responsible for security within company quarters.

===Gorget patches===
The scarlet patches still worn on each side of the collar of the tunics of British Army general officers and senior officers are called &quot;gorget patches&quot; in reference to this article of armour. There were two types - the first, red with a crimson centre stripe, were for Colonels and Brigadiers, and red with a gold centre stripe for General Officers. Today, they signify an officer of the General Staff, to which all British officers are appointed on reaching the rank of Colonel. With limited exceptions such as senior officers of the Army Medical and Dental Corps, the historic colour differentials are no longer worn in the British service.

However, the historic colours are still used in the gorget patches of the Canadian Army. Air officers in the Indian and Sri Lankan air forces also wear gorget patches with one to five stars depending on their seniority.

RAF officer cadets wear white gorget patches on their service dress and mess dress uniforms. Very similar collar patches are worn by British army officer cadets at Sandhurst on the standup collars of their dark-blue &quot;Number One&quot; dress uniforms. These features of modern uniforms are a residual survival from the earlier practice of suspending the actual gorgets from ribbons attached to buttons on both collars of the uniform. Such buttons were often mounted on a patch of coloured cloth or gold embroidery.

==Cultural and decorative uses==
Gorgets made of shell, as well as stone and copper, have been found at archaeological sites of various ages associated with mound building cultures of Eastern North America, going back thousands of years.

Gorget stones are polished pieces of stones that were worn by Native Americans on the neck or chest as a decoration, ornament, or talisman.
The British Empire awarded gorgets to chiefs of American Indian tribes, both as tokens of goodwill, and as a badge of their high status. Those being awarded a gorget were known as gorget captains Gorgets were also awarded to African chiefs.

In colonial Australia, gorgets were given to Aboriginal people by government officials and pastoralists as insignia of high rank or reward for services to the settler community. Frequently inscribed with the word &quot;King&quot; along with the name of the tribal group to which the recipient belonged (despite the absence of this kind of rank among indigenous Australians), the &quot;breastplates&quot;, as they came to be known, were highly regarded by those who received them.

==Modern versions==
 Recent advances in protective armour have led to the functional gorget being reintroduced into the US Army and Marine Improved Outer Tactical Vest and Modular Tactical Vest systems respectively.

==Other uses==
The state flag of South Carolina features a crescent in the upper left quadrant which now resembles a crescent moon, but which some oral traditions have suggested may have once represented a gorget. The state flag derives from a flag designed by Colonel William Moultrie in 1775 with a blue ground and crescent based on the uniforms of the Second South Carolina Regiment, who wore a crescent with the tips pointing up on their hats. Through the 19th century, the crescent on the state flag also appeared with the tips pointing up, and it was not until the 20th century that it was turned on its side to resemble a crescent moon. The mystery of its original meaning is still unresolved, and the crescent as it appears on the modern state flag is normally interpreted as a moon.

The term also refers to a patch of coloured feathers found on the throat or upper breast of some species of birds.

<doc id="1072144" wikidata="Q1465090" url="?curid=1072144" title="Grothendieck universe">
<text>In mathematics, a Grothendieck universe is a set &quot;U&quot; with the following properties:

# If &quot;x&quot; is an element of &quot;U&quot; and if &quot;y&quot; is an element of &quot;x&quot;, then &quot;y&quot; is also an element of &quot;U&quot;. (&quot;U&quot; is a transitive set.)
# If &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are both elements of &quot;U&quot;, then formula_1 is an element of &quot;U&quot;.
# If &quot;x&quot; is an element of &quot;U&quot;, then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), the power set of &quot;x&quot;, is also an element of &quot;U&quot;.
# If formula_2 is a family of elements of &quot;U&quot;, and if is an element of &quot;U&quot;, then the union formula_3 is an element of &quot;U&quot;.

A Grothendieck universe is meant to provide a set in which all of mathematics can be performed. (In fact, uncountable Grothendieck universes provide models of set theory with the natural ∈-relation, natural powerset operation etc.). Elements of a Grothendieck universe are sometimes called small sets. The idea of universes is due to Alexander Grothendieck, who used them as a way of avoiding proper classes in algebraic geometry. Grothendieck’s original proposal was to add the following axiom of universes to the usual axioms of set theory: For every set formula_4, there exists a universe formula_5 that contains formula_4, i.e., formula_7.

The existence of a nontrivial Grothendieck universe goes beyond the usual axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory; in particular it would imply the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals.
Tarski–Grothendieck set theory is an axiomatic treatment of set theory, used in some automatic proof systems, in which every set belongs to a Grothendieck universe.
The concept of a Grothendieck universe can also be defined in a topos.

==Properties==
As an example, we will prove an easy proposition.

:Proposition. If formula_8 and formula_9, then formula_10.
:Proof. formula_11 because formula_9. formula_13 because formula_8, so formula_10.

It is similarly easy to prove that any Grothendieck universe &quot;U&quot; contains:
* All singletons of each of its elements,
* All products of all families of elements of &quot;U&quot; indexed by an element of &quot;U&quot;,
* All disjoint unions of all families of elements of &quot;U&quot; indexed by an element of &quot;U&quot;,
* All intersections of all families of elements of &quot;U&quot; indexed by an element of &quot;U&quot;,
* All functions between any two elements of &quot;U&quot;, and
* All subsets of &quot;U&quot; whose cardinal is an element of &quot;U&quot;.

In particular, it follows from the last axiom that if &quot;U&quot; is non-empty, it must contain all of its finite subsets and a subset of each finite cardinality. One can also prove immediately from the definitions that the intersection of any class of universes is a universe.

== Grothendieck universes and inaccessible cardinals ==
There are two simple examples of Grothendieck universes:
* The empty set, and
* The set of all hereditarily finite sets formula_16.
Other examples are more difficult to construct. Loosely speaking, this is because Grothendieck universes are equivalent to strongly inaccessible cardinals. More formally, the following two axioms are equivalent:

: (U) For each set &quot;x&quot;, there exists a Grothendieck universe &quot;U&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;.
: (C) For each cardinal κ, there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal λ that is strictly larger than κ.

To prove this fact, we introduce the function c(&quot;U&quot;). Define:
:formula_17
where by |&quot;x&quot;| we mean the cardinality of &quot;x&quot;. Then for any universe &quot;U&quot;, c(&quot;U&quot;) is either zero or strongly inaccessible. Assuming it is non-zero, it is a strong limit cardinal because the power set of any element of &quot;U&quot; is an element of &quot;U&quot; and every element of &quot;U&quot; is a subset of &quot;U&quot;. To see that it is regular, suppose that &quot;c&quot;&quot;λ&quot; is a collection of cardinals indexed by , where the cardinality of and of each &quot;cλ&quot; is less than c(&quot;U&quot;). Then, by the definition of c(&quot;U&quot;), and each &quot;c&quot;&quot;λ&quot; can be replaced by an element of &quot;U&quot;. The union of elements of &quot;U&quot; indexed by an element of &quot;U&quot; is an element of &quot;U&quot;, so the sum of the &quot;c&quot;&quot;λ&quot; has the cardinality of an element of &quot;U&quot;, hence is less than c(&quot;U&quot;). By invoking the axiom of foundation, that no set is contained in itself, it can be shown that c(&quot;U&quot;) equals |&quot;U&quot;|; when the axiom of foundation is not assumed, there are counterexamples (we may take for example U to be the set of all finite sets of finite sets etc. of the sets xα where the index α is any real number, and &quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot;} for each &quot;α&quot;. Then &quot;U&quot; has the cardinality of the continuum, but all of its members have finite cardinality and so formula_18 ; see Bourbaki&#x27;s article for more details).

Let be a strongly inaccessible cardinal. Say that a set &quot;S&quot; is strictly of type if for any sequence . (&quot;S&quot; itself corresponds to the empty sequence.) Then the set of all sets strictly of type is a Grothendieck universe of cardinality . The proof of this fact is long, so for details, we again refer to Bourbaki&#x27;s article, listed in the references.

To show that the large cardinal axiom (C) implies the universe axiom (U), choose a set &quot;x&quot;. Let &quot;x&quot;0 = &quot;x&quot;, and for each &quot;n&quot;, let formula_19 be the union of the elements of &quot;xn&quot;. Let &quot;y&quot; = formula_20. By (C), there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal such that . Let be the universe of the previous paragraph. &quot;x&quot; is strictly of type κ, so . To show that the universe axiom (U) implies the large cardinal axiom (C), choose a cardinal . is a set, so it is an element of a Grothendieck universe &quot;U&quot;. The cardinality of &quot;U&quot; is strongly inaccessible and strictly larger than that of .

In fact, any Grothendieck universe is of the form for some . This gives another form of the equivalence between Grothendieck universes and strongly inaccessible cardinals:

:For any Grothendieck universe &quot;U&quot;, |&quot;U&quot;| is either zero, formula_21, or a strongly inaccessible cardinal. And if is zero, formula_21, or a strongly inaccessible cardinal, then there is a Grothendieck universe . Furthermore, , and .

Since the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), the existence of universes other than the empty set and formula_16 cannot be proved from ZFC either. However, strongly inaccessible cardinals are on the lower end of the list of large cardinals; thus, most set theories that use large cardinals (such as &quot;ZFC plus there is a measurable cardinal&quot;, &quot;ZFC plus there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals&quot;) will prove that Grothendieck universes exist.

<doc id="1072149" wikidata="Q79536" url="?curid=1072149" title="Google Desktop">
<text>Google Desktop was a computer program with desktop search capabilities, created by Google for Linux, Apple Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows systems. It allowed text searches of a user&#x27;s email messages, computer files, music, photos, chats, web pages viewed, and the ability to display &quot;Google Gadgets&quot; on the user&#x27;s desktop in a sidebar.

In September 2011, Google announced it would discontinue a number of its products, including Google Desktop. The reason given was that &quot;In the last few years, there’s been a huge shift from local to cloud-based storage and computing, as well as the integration of search and gadget functionality into most modern operating systems. People now have instant access to their data, whether online or offline. As this was the goal of Google Desktop, the product will be discontinued.&quot;

==Features==
As of January 2008, Google Desktop featured the following functionality:

===Sidebar===
A prominent feature of the Google Desktop is the Sidebar, which holds several common Gadgets and resides off to one side of the desktop. The Sidebar is available on the Windows and Linux versions of Google Desktop. The Sidebar comes pre-installed with the following gadgets:
* Email – a panel which lets one view their own Gmail messages.
* Scratch Pad – here the user can store notes; they are saved automatically
* Photos – displays a slideshow of photos from the &quot;My Pictures&quot; folder (address can be changed)
* News – shows the latest headlines from Google News, and how long ago they were written. The News panel is personalized depending on the type of news that users read.
* Weather – shows the current weather for a location specified by the user.
* Web Clips – shows updated content from RSS and Atom web feeds.
* Google Talk – If Google Talk is installed, double clicking the window title will dock it to the user&#x27;s sidebar.

Like the Windows Taskbar, the Google Desktop sidebar can be set to Auto-Hide mode, where it will only appear once the user moves the mouse cursor towards the side where it resides. If not on auto-hide, by default the sidebar will always take up about 1/6 – 1/9 of the screen (depending on the screen resolution), and other windows are forced to resize. However, the sidebar can be resized to take less space, and users can disable the &quot;always on top&quot; feature in the options. With the auto-hide feature on, the sidebar temporarily overlaps maximized windows.

Another feature that comes with the Sidebar is alerts. When the Sidebar is minimized, new email and news can be displayed on a pop-up window above the Windows Taskbar.

===Quick Find===

When searching in the sidebar, deskbar or floating deskbar, Google Desktop displays a &quot;Quick Find&quot; window. This window is filled with six (by default) of the most relevant results from the user&#x27;s computer. These results update as the user types, and allows use without having to open another browser window.

===Deskbars===
Deskbars are boxes which enable searching directly from the desktop. Web results will open in a browser window, and selected computer results will be displayed in the &quot;Quick Find&quot; box (see above). A Deskbar can either be a fixed deskbar, which sits in the Windows Taskbar, or a Floating Deskbar, which may be positioned anywhere on the desktop.

===Email indexing===
Google Desktop includes plugins that allow indexing and searching the contents of local Microsoft Outlook, IBM Lotus Notes, and Mozilla Thunderbird email databases, outside of the client applications&#x27; built-in search functions. For Lotus Notes, only local databases are indexed for searching. Google Desktop&#x27;s email indexing feature is also integrated with Google&#x27;s web-based email service, Gmail; it can index and search the email messages in Gmail accounts.

===Gadgets and plug-ins===
Desktop gadgets are interactive mini-applications that can be placed anywhere on the user&#x27;s desktop – or docked in the Sidebar – to show new email, weather, photos, and personalized news. Google offers a gallery of pre-built gadgets for download on the official website. For developers, Google offers an SDK and an official blog for anyone who wants to write gadgets or plug-ins for Google Desktop. An automated system creates a developer hierarchy called the &quot;Google Desktop Hall of Fame&quot;, where programmers can advance based on their gadgets&#x27; number and popularity.

The SDK also allows third-party applications to make use of the search facilities provided by Google Desktop Search. For example, the file manager Directory Opus offers integrated Google Desktop Search support.

===Results list: title meta data===
Even though other desktop search programs can search files meta data, Google Desktop (for Windows) is the only one that uses the &quot;title&quot; tag for its results lists of all files (On Linux it shows the meta-data of HTML files, but not PDF files). Other programs use the file names for their results lists.
The use of the &quot;title&quot; tag gives a significantly better user experience, since metadata titles (when present) are written in ordinary language, while file names are less communicative.
When the title meta data is missing from a file, Google Desktop reverts to use its filename.

==Release history==
Google Desktop was originally developed to bring Google search technology to the desktop. Google Desktop received much attention because it may allow reverse engineering of Google&#x27;s proprietary search algorithm.

A centrally administered version, which integrates the user experience with the vendor&#x27;s appliance, exists as well. Google Desktop was officially discontinued on September 14, 2011.

;Microsoft Windows

*The first release of Google Desktop Search was released as a beta version on October 14, 2004.
*Version 2 was released as a beta version on August 22, 2005. The new feature that distinguishes Desktop 2 from Desktop is the addition of Sidebar, a panel that displays personalized information, which can be placed on either side of the Windows desktop and can display real-time news, e-mail, photos, stocks, and weather, among others. Sidebar includes a search box that can search just the PC or Google&#x27;s other search types (like Web, Images, News, Groups.) Google Desktop 2 graduated from beta on November 3, 2005. New features include a sidebar plug-in for Google Maps and more plug-in developer support.
*Google Desktop 3 Beta was released on February 9, 2006. It includes support for searching multiple computers on a network. Google Desktop 3 graduated from beta on March 14, 2006. Notable in this version is the quick search box, which appears anywhere on the desktop after pressing &quot;control&quot; twice.

==Criticisms==

===Security===
In February 2007, Yair Amit, of Watchfire, found a series of vulnerabilities in Google Desktop that could allow a malicious individual to achieve not only remote, persistent access to sensitive data, but in some cases full system control as well. The significant impact and the ease of exploitation forced Google to change some of Google Desktop&#x27;s logic in Google Desktop version 5.

===Privacy===

Many privacy and civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have concerns that personal information on people&#x27;s computers could readily be copied from users&#x27; hard drives.

Google Desktop version 3 contains certain features that raise serious security and privacy concerns. Specifically, the &quot;share across computers&quot; feature, which introduces the ability to search content from desktop to desktop, greatly increases the risk to users&#x27; privacy. If Google Desktop V.3 is set to allow &quot;Search Across Computers&quot;, files on an indexed computer are copied to Google&#x27;s servers. The potential for information stored on their computers to be accessed by others if they enable this feature of Google Desktop v. 3 on their computers should be seriously considered. The EFF advises against using this feature. Also, those who have confidential data on their work or home computers should not enable this feature. There are privacy laws and company policies that could be violated through the installation of this feature, specifically, SB 1386, HIPAA, FERPA, GLBA and Sarbanes-Oxley.

Other more far reaching concerns arise around the packaging and end user license agreement – specifically the level of intrusion on the local machine and the disclaimers that users implicitly agree to future changes in the license agreement without actually being able to see them immediately.

===Outlook indexing===
There had been some issues with Microsoft Outlook indexing. Deleted email listings were not removed and required re-installing Google Desktop for any new archived mail to be listed. Several versions have been released to patch the Outlook indexing.

During the first half of 2009, a large number of Google Desktop users reported that the product stopped indexing suddenly, when the index file reached approximately 4GB in size. A full uninstall (including manually deleting the indexes) and then reinstall would fix the problem temporarily, but the problem would recur when the index file reached 4GB again. The problem has been resolved as of Google Desktop Search version 5.9. Currently, Google Desktop does not index email or contacts in Outlook 2010.

===Thunderbird indexing===
By default, Google Desktop does not index email in Thunderbird 3.

<doc id="1072150" wikidata="Q1264653" url="?curid=1072150" title="Thought Police">
<text>In the dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949), by George Orwell, the Thought Police (&quot;Thinkpol&quot; in Newspeak) are the secret police of the superstate of Oceania, who discover and punish &quot;thoughtcrime&quot; (personal and political thoughts unapproved by Ingsoc&#x27;s régime). Using criminal psychology and omnipresent surveillance (via informers, telescreens, cameras, and microphones) the Thinkpol monitor the citizens of Oceania and arrest all those who have committed &quot;thoughtcrime&quot; in challenge to the &quot;status quo&quot; authority of the Party and of the régime of Big Brother.

Orwell&#x27;s concept of &quot;policing thought&quot; derived from the intellectual self-honesty shown by a person&#x27;s &quot;power of facing unpleasant facts&quot;; thus, criticising the dominant ideology of British society often placed Orwell in conflict with ideologues, people advocating &quot;smelly little orthodoxies&quot;.

==In &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;==
In the year 1984, the government of Oceania, dominated by the Inner Party, uses the Newspeak language – a heavily simplified version of English – to control the speech, actions, and thought of the population, by defining &quot;unapproved thoughts&quot; as &quot;thoughtcrime&quot;; for such actions, the &quot;Thinkpol&quot; arrest Winston Smith, the protagonist of the story, and Julia, his lover, as enemies of the state. In conversation with Winston, O&#x27;Brien, a member of the Inner Party and a covert Thinkpol officer, reveals that the Thinkpol conduct false flag operations, such as by pretending to be members of the Brotherhood in order to lure out and arrest &quot;thought criminals&quot;. 

As an &quot;agent provocateur&quot;, O&#x27;Brien gives Winston a copy of the forbidden book, &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&quot;, by Emmanuel Goldstein the enemy of the state of Oceania; yet the factual reality of The Brotherhood in Oceania remains uncertain, because O&#x27;Brien refuses to tell Winston whether or not the Brotherhood truly exists. The book explains that “Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought Police,” as the Thinkpol is the only apparatus that must function effectively for the Party to retain control. There is a telescreen in the quarters of every Inner-party and Outer-party citizen, by which the Thinkpol audio-visually police their behaviour for unorthodox opinions, and to spy visible indications of the mental stresses manifested by a person struggling with &quot;ownlife&quot;, such as words spoken whilst asleep. The Thinkpol also spy upon and eliminate intelligent people, such as the lexicographer Syme, who is rendered an &quot;unperson&quot; despite his fierce loyalty to the Party and to Big Brother.

To eliminate possible martyrs, men and women of whom popular memory might provoke anti–Party resistance, thought-criminals are taken to the &quot;Miniluv&quot; (Ministry of Love), where the Thinkpol break them with conversation, degradation (moral and physical), and torture in Room 101. In breaking prisoners, the Thinkpol coerce their sincere acceptance of the Ingsoc worldview and to love Big Brother without reservation. Afterward, the Thinkpol release the politically rehabilitated prisoners to the social mainstream of Oceania. If the released thought-criminals are found to have committed more &quot;thoughtcrimes&quot;, the Thinkpol re-arrest them for further interrogation and torture, and eventual execution that concludes with cremation into an &quot;unperson&quot;.

Moreover, every member of the Inner Party and of the Outer Party who ever knew, was acquainted with, or knew of any &quot;unperson&quot; must forget them, lest they commit the &quot;thoughtcrime&quot; of remembering an &quot;unperson&quot;. Such &quot;crimestop&quot;, ideological self-discipline, of not thinking independently, indicates the cultural success of the Newspeak language as a means of social control. Moreover, the Minitrue (Ministry of Truth) destroy all records of unpersons. The Thinkpol usually do not interfere with the lives of the Proles, the working classes of Oceania, but do deploy &quot;agents provocateur&quot; to operate amongst them, by planting rumours to entrap and identify and eliminate any Prole who shows intelligence and the capacity for independent thought, which might lead to rebellion against the cultural hegemony of the Party.

==In other usages==

In the early twentieth century, before the publication of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, the Empire of Japan (1868–1947), in 1911, established the &quot;Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu&quot; (&#x27;Special Higher Police&#x27;), a political police force also known as &quot;Shisō Keisatsu&quot;, the Thought Police, who investigated and controlled native political groups whose ideologies were considered a threat to the public order of the countries colonised by Japan. In contemporary usage, the term &quot;Thought Police&quot; and variants thereof often refers to the actual or perceived enforcement of ideological orthodoxy in the political life of a society. In North Korea, the Ministry of State Security (&quot;MSS&quot;) was established by the Kim dynasty in 1973 and was known by its nickname as (North Korea&#x27;s Thought Police), where thoughts in the DPRK are controlled not just the Songbun caste system, but by the WPK.

<doc id="1072153" wikidata="Q7131032" url="?curid=1072153" title="Panhellenic Liberation Movement">
<text>The Panhellenic Liberation Movement (), also known by its acronym PAK (ΠΑΚ), was one of the many anti-dictatorial movement organisations that campaigned against the 1967–1974 military regime of Greece. It was established in 1968 in Sweden by the exiled Andreas Papandreou.

==History==
PAK toured the world rallying opposition to the military regime and aiming to create awareness about the political situation in Greece. Its campaign in Sweden was particularly successful. On February 28, 1968, Papandreou gave a famous speech at the Club of Greek Immigrants (Σύλλογος Ελλήνων Μεταναστών). Later on, a manifesto was published, entitled “A text-book and the Internal Political Net.” The leader of the PAK in Greece was Giannis Alevras.

Its campaign in Sweden was particularly successful. PAK was also highly critical of the alleged dependence of Greece on foreign powers, namely the USA. Its stated aim was the realization of “radical changes” with the aim of the “socialist transformation of Greece”.
PAK issued the monthly newsletter &quot;PAK News&quot;, the purpose of which was informing the readers about its political actions, giving updates about the trial of the PAK members and reproducing speeches and articles by Andreas Papandreou. It was issued in both Greek and English.

In May 1971, 8 young men who were alleged to be members of PAK were arrested for making and planting bombs in Athens.

On February 24, 1972 Andreas Papandreou spoke at the &quot;Symposium on Imperialism&quot; about the future PAK is fighting for, he stated &quot;I am committed to the Panhellenic Liberation Movement until freedom comes to Greece. When it does we will build a socialist society in which human rights are respected and citizens have the right to participate in key decisions.&quot;On April 23, 1972 the 5th anniversary of the Greek junta, Papandreou and other members of PAK participated in a large rally/protest in New York City protesting the regime, among the speakers at the rally was economist and political activist Daniel Ellsberg, Melina Merkouri, Eleni Kazantzaki and Giorgos Vournas. Statements of solidarity by Carlo Levi, senator George McGovern and Vassos Lyssarides were read. Barbara Dane performed songs by Mikis Theodorakis.

Furthermore, PAK’ s stated aim was to become the centre of democratic resistance in Greece. It not only wished for the withdrawal of the Colonel dictatorship, but it also supported a “free, progressive and nationally free” Greece. It claimed that “it would not accept any compromise in any phase of its struggle and that it would fight for a total democratic victory.”

After the fall of the junta, many PAK members became prominent members in Papandreou&#x27;s Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) party.

<text>Charles Joseph Sylvanus Apps (January 18, 1915 – December 24, 1998), was a Canadian professional ice hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs from 1936 to 1948, an Olympic pole vaulter and a Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament in Ontario. In 2017 Apps was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

==Athletic career==

Apps was a strong athlete, six feet tall, weighing 185 pounds, and won the gold medal at the 1934 British Empire Games in the pole vault competition. Two years later he represented Canada at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany, where he placed sixth in the pole vault event. After watching him play football at McMaster University (where Apps was majoring in Economics), Conn Smythe signed Apps to play hockey with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Apps played centre position with the Toronto Maple Leafs for his entire professional hockey career. His jersey number was 10. He was the winner of the first Calder Memorial Trophy in 1937, and the 1942 Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. Apps served as the Maple Leafs captain during the first National Hockey League All-Star Game October 13, 1947, at Maple Leaf Gardens. He also played for an all-star team competing in Montreal on October 29, 1939, to raise money for Babe Siebert&#x27;s family.

Apps was in the prime of his career when he joined the Canadian Army during World War II at the end of the 1943 season. He served two years until the war was over, whereupon he returned to captain the Leafs, winning 2 more Stanley Cups in 1947 and 1948.

Apps contemplated retirement following the 1947 Stanley Cup win, but returned in order to reach the 200 career goals milestone. With 196 career goals heading into the final weekend of the regular season, Apps scored 5 goals in the two weekend games to surpass his goal. Despite scoring 53 points in 55 games and setting a career high in goals, Apps retired from the NHL at the age of 33 and took a marketing job with the Simpson&#x27;s department store. At the same time, he also served as the Ontario Athletic Commissioner.

==Politics==
While still playing hockey, Apps ran for parliament in the 1940 federal election. He was a candidate in the riding of Brant for the National Government Party but lost to incumbent George Wood of the Liberals by 138 votes.

Apps was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1963 to 1975. He represented the riding of Kingston from 1963 to 1967 and Kingston and the Islands from 1967 to 1975. He served as the Minister of Correctional Services from 1971 to 1974.

==Death==
On December 24, 1998, Apps died from a heart attack and was buried in Mountview Cemetery in Cambridge, Ontario. After his death, the Maple Leafs honoured his jersey number and George Armstrong&#x27;s number, who both wore the number 10. Their numbers were not retired, as the Maple Leafs had a policy of only retiring numbers for players &quot;who have made a significant contribution to the Toronto Maple Leaf Hockey Club and have experienced a career-ending incident while a member of the Maple Leaf team&quot;. However, this policy was changed for the Maple Leafs&#x27; centennial season, with Apps&#x27; number, along with 15 others, officially being retired on October 15, 2016.

==Legacy==
Apps was known for his athleticism, character, skating and play-making abilities (alongside a scoring touch, six times reaching the 20 goal plateau). He has been praised by Maple Leafs alumni, authors, historians and even competitors. Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe called Apps the greatest player in franchise history, with teammate Howie Meeker noting his strong, consistent play. Ted Kennedy often spoke of his character. Jack Adams, famous for his managerial roles with the Detroit Red Wings, stated that Apps was the greatest centre he had ever seen. Boston Bruins legend Milt Schmidt called Apps the greatest player he ever played against, as did Ted Lindsay in relation to the centre position and gentlemanly characteristics.

In 1975, he was elected to Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame and two years later Apps was made a Member of the Order of Canada.

Several institutions are named for him, including the &quot;Syl and Molly Apps Research Centre&quot; in Kingston, Ontario, and the &quot;Syl Apps Youth Centre&quot; in Oakville, Ontario. The sports arena in his home town of Paris is named the &quot;Syl Apps Community Centre&quot;.

In 1997, Syl Apps was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. Unveiled by the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame on January 13, 1998, the Syl Apps Award is emblematic of Ontario&#x27;s Athlete of the Year.

In 2001, Canada Post included Apps in a series of NHL All-Star 47-cent postage stamps.

The National Hockey League itself listed Apps as one of the 100 Greatest Players to ever play in the league as part of the league&#x27;s centennial celebrations in 2017.

==Family==
Apps and wife Mary Josephine had five children, Joanne, Robert, Carol, Janet and son Syl Apps Jr. (the latter also played in the NHL). His granddaughter (and daughter of Syl Jr.) Gillian Apps won the gold medal in the 2006 Winter Olympics, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and the 2014 Winter Olympics for Canada&#x27;s women&#x27;s ice hockey team, and his grandson Syl Apps III was a college hockey star at Princeton University and played four years in the minor leagues. His grandson Darren Barber won a gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics in the men&#x27;s 8 in rowing. Barber is now a family doctor in Peterborough, Ontario.
Another cousin, whose grandparents had settled in Manitoba, was Murray Dryden; his sons Dave Dryden and Ken Dryden were NHL Goalkeepers.

<doc id="1072173" wikidata="Q407553" url="?curid=1072173" title="Glycosaminoglycan">
<text>Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) or mucopolysaccharides are long, linear polysaccharides consisting of repeating disaccharide units (i.e. two-sugar units). The repeating two-sugar unit consists of a uronic sugar and an amino sugar, except in the case of the sulfated glycosaminoglycan keratan, where, in place of the uronic sugar there is a galactose unit. GAGs are found in vertebrates, invertebrates and bacteria.
Because GAGs are highly polar molecules and attract water; the body uses them as lubricants or shock absorbers.

Mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of metabolic disorders in which abnormal accumulations of glycosaminoglycans occur due to enzyme deficiencies.

==Production==
Glycosaminoglycans vary greatly in molecular mass, disaccharide structure, and sulfation. This is because GAG synthesis is not template driven, as are proteins or nucleic acids, but constantly altered by processing enzymes.

GAGs are classified into four groups, based on their core disaccharide structures:
# Heparin/heparan sulfate (HSGAGs)
# Chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CSGAGs) which along with HSGAGs are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, where protein cores, made in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, are post-translationally modified via O-linked glycosylation by glycosyltransferases, thus forming proteoglycans.
# Keratan sulfate which may modify core proteins through N-linked glycosylation or O-linked glycosylation of the proteoglycan
# Hyaluronic acid (also known as hyaluronan), which is synthesized by integral membrane synthases, which immediately secrete the dynamically elongated disaccharide chain.

===HSGAG and CSGAG===
HSGAG and CSGAG modified proteoglycans first begin with a consensus Ser-Gly/Ala-X-Gly motif in the core protein. Construction of a tetrasaccharide linker that consists of -GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-(Ser)-, where xylosyltransferase, β4-galactosyl transferase (GalTI),β3-galactosyl transferase (GalT-II), and β3-GlcA transferase (GlcAT-I) transfer the four monosaccharides, begins synthesis of the GAG modified protein. The first modification of the tetrasaccharide linker determines whether the HSGAGs or CSGAGs will be added. Addition of a GlcNAc promotes the addition of HSGAGs while addition of GalNAc to the tetrasaccharide linker promotes CSGAG development. GlcNAcT-I transfers GlcNAc to the tetrasaccahride linker, which is distinct from glycosyltransferase GlcNAcT-II, the enzyme that is utilized to build HSGAGs. EXTL2 and EXTL3, two genes in the EXT tumor suppressor family, have been shown to have GlcNAcT-I activity. Conversely, GalNAc is transferred to the linker by the enzyme GalNAcT to initiate synthesis of CSGAGs, an enzyme which may or may not have distinct activity compared to the GalNAc transferase activity of chondroitin synthase.

With regard to HSGAGs, a multimeric enzyme encoded by EXT1 and EXT2 of the EXT family of genes, transfers both GlcNAc and GlcA for HSGAG chain elongation. While elongating, the HSGAG is dynamically modified, first by N-deacetylase, N-sulfotransferase (NDST1), which is a bifunctional enzyme that cleaves the N-acetyl group from GlcNAc and subsequently sulfates the N-position. Next, C-5 uronyl epimerase coverts d-GlcA to l-IdoA followed by 2-&quot;O&quot; sulfation of the uronic acid sugar by 2-&quot;O&quot; sulfotransferase (Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase). Finally, the 6-&quot;O&quot; and 3-&quot;O&quot; positions of GlcNAc moities are sulfated by 6-&quot;O&quot; (Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase) and 3-O (3-OST) sulfotransferases.

Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, which comprise CSGAGs, are differentiated from each other by the presence of GlcA and IdoA epimers respectively. Similar to the production of HSGAGs, C-5 uronyl epimerase converts d-GlcA to l-IdoA to synthesize dermatan sulfate. Three sulfation events of the CSGAG chains occur: 4-&quot;O&quot; and/or 6-&quot;O&quot; sulfation of GalNAc and 2-&quot;O&quot; sulfation of uronic acid. Four isoforms of the 4-&quot;O&quot; GalNAc sulfotransferases (C4ST-1, C4ST-2, C4ST-3, and D4ST-1) and three isoforms of the GalNAc 6-&quot;O&quot; sulfotransferases (C6ST, C6ST-2, and GalNAc4S-6ST) are responsible for the sulfation of GalNAc.

===Keratan sulfate types===
Unlike HSGAGs and CSGAGs, the third class of GAGs, those belonging to keratan sulfate types, are driven towards biosynthesis through particular protein sequence motifs. For example, in the cornea and cartilage, the keratan sulfate domain of aggrecan consists of a series of tandemly repeated hexapeptides with a consensus sequence of E(E/L)PFPS. Additionally, for three other keratan sulfated proteoglycans, lumican, keratocan, and mimecan (OGN), the consensus sequence NX(T/S) along with protein secondary structure was determined to be involved in &quot;N&quot;-linked oligosaccharide extension with keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfate elongation begins at the nonreducing ends of three linkage oligosaccharides, which define the three classes of keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfate I (KSI) is &quot;N&quot; -linked via a high mannose type precursor oligosaccharide. Keratan sulfate II (KSII) and keratan sulfate III (KSIII) are &quot;O&quot;-linked, with KSII linkages identical to that of mucin core structure, and KSIII linked to a 2-&quot;O&quot; mannose. Elongation of the keratan sulfate polymer occurs through the glycosyltransferase addition of Gal and GlcNAc. Galactose addition occurs primarily through the β-1,4-galactosyltransferase enzyme (β4Gal-T1) while the enzymes responsible for β-3-Nacetylglucosamine have not been clearly identified. Finally, sulfation of the polymer occurs at the 6-position of both sugar residues. The enzyme KS-Gal6ST (CHST1) transfers sulfate groups to galactose while N-acetylglucosaminyl-6-sulfotransferase (GlcNAc6ST) (CHST2) transfers sulfate groups to terminal GlcNAc in keratan sulfate.

===Hyaluronic acid class===

The fourth class of GAG, hyaluronic acid (HA), is not sulfated and is synthesized by three transmembrane synthase proteins HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3. HA, a linear polysaccharide, is composed of repeating disaccharide units of →4)GlcAβ(1→3)GlcNAcβ(1→ and has a very high molecular mass, ranging from 105 to 107 Da. Each HAS enzyme is capable of transglycosylation when supplied with UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc. HAS2 is responsible for very large hyaluronic acid polymers, while smaller sizes of HA are synthesized by HAS1 and HAS3. While each HAS isoform catalyzes the same biosynthetic reaction, each HAS isoform is independently active. HAS isoforms have also been shown to have differing &quot;K&quot;m values for UDP-GlcA and UDPGlcNAc. It is believed that through differences in enzyme activity and expression, the wide spectrum of biological functions mediated by HA can be regulated, such as its involvement with neural stem cell regulation in the subgranular zone of the brain.

== Pharmacodynamics ==

;HSGAGs: Endogenous heparin is localized and stored in secretory granules of mast cells. Histamine that is present within the granules is protonated (H2A2+) at pH within granules (5.2–6.0), thus it is believed that heparin, which is highly negatively charged, functions to electrostatically retain and store histamine. In the clinic, heparin is administered as an anticoagulant and is also the first line choice for thromboembolic diseases. Heparan sulfate (HS) has numerous biological activities and functions, including cell adhesion, regulation of cell growth and proliferation, developmental processes, cell surface binding of lipoprotein lipase and other proteins, angiogenesis, viral invasion, and tumor metastasis.

CSGAGs interact with heparin binding proteins, specifically dermatan sulfate interactions with fibroblast growth factor FGF-2 and FGF-7 have been implicated in cellular proliferation and wound repair while interactions with hepatic growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) activate the HGF/SF signaling pathway (c-Met) through its receptor. CSGAGs are important in providing support and adhesiveness in bone, skin, and cartilage. Other biological functions for which CSGAGs are known to play critical functions in include inhibition of axonal growth and regeneration in CNS development, roles in brain development, neuritogenic activity, and pathogen infection.

;Keratan sulfates:One of the main functions of the third class of GAGs, keratan sulfates, is the maintenance of tissue hydration. Keratan sulfates are in the bone, cartilage, and the cornea of the eye. Within the normal cornea, dermatan sulfate is fully hydrated whereas keratan sulfate is only partially hydrated suggesting that keratan sulfate may behave as a dynamically controlled buffer for hydration. In disease states such as macular corneal dystrophy, in which GAGs levels such as KS are altered, loss of hydration within the corneal stroma is believed to be the cause of corneal haze, thus supporting the long-held hypothesis that corneal transparency is dependent on proper levels of keratan sulfate. Keratan sulfate GAGs are found in many other tissues besides the cornea, where they are known to regulate macrophage adhesion, form barriers to neurite growth, regulate embryo implantation in the endometrial uterine lining during menstrual cycles, and affect the motility of corneal endothelial cells. In summary, KS plays an anti-adhesive role, which suggests very important functions of KS in cell motility and attachment as well as other potential biological processes.

Dermatan sulfates

Dermatan sulfates function in the skin, tendons, blood vessels, and heart valves.

;Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic acid is a major component of synovial tissues and fluid, as well as the ground substance of other connective tissues. Hyaluronic acid binds cells together, lubricates joints, and helps maintain the shape of the eyeballs. The viscoelasticity of hyaluronic acid makes it ideal for lubricating joints and surfaces that move along each other, such as cartilage. A solution of hyaluronic acid under low shear stress has a much higher viscosity than while under high shear stress. Hyaluronidase, an enzyme produced by white blood cells, sperms cells, and some bacteria, breaks apart the hyaluronic acid, causing the solution to become more liquid.
:&quot;In vivo&quot;, hyaluronic acid forms randomly kinked coils that entangle to form a hyaluronan network, slowing diffusion and forming a diffusion barrier that regulates transport of substances between cells. For example, hyaluronan helps partition plasma proteins between vascular and extravascular spaces, which affects solubility of macromolecules in the interstitium, changes chemical equilibria, and stabilizes the structure of collagen fibers.
:Other functions include matrix interactions with hyaluronan binding proteins such as hyaluronectin, glial hyaluronan binding protein, brain enriched hyaluronan binding protein, collagen VI, TSG-6, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor. Cell surface interactions involving hyaluronan are its well-known coupling with CD44, which may be related to tumor progression, and also with RHAMM (Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor), which has been implicated in developmental processes, tumor metastasis, and pathological reparative processes.
:Fibroblasts, mesothelial cells, and certain types of stem cells surround themselves in a pericellular &quot;coat&quot;, part of which is constructed from hyaluronan, in order to shield themselves from bacteria, red blood cells, or other matrix molecules. For example, in regard to stem cells, hyaluronan, along with chondroitin sulfate, helps to form the stem cell niche. Stem cells are protected from the effects of growth factors by a shield of hyaluronan and minimally sulfated chondroitin sulfate. During progenitor division, the daughter cell moves outside of this pericellular shield where it can then be influenced by growth factors to differentiate even further.

==Classification==
Members of the glycosaminoglycan family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid unit they contain (e.g. glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine).

They also vary in the geometry of the glycosidic linkage.

Examples of GAGs include:

<text>CHEX-DT (channel 12) is a television station in Peterborough, Ontario, Canada, part of the Global Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Corus Entertainment, the station maintains studios on Monaghan Road (near Rose Avenue) in the southern portion of Peterborough, and its transmitter is located on Television Hill, just outside the city.

== History ==
The station signed on the air on March 26, 1955, as an independently owned affiliate of CBC Television; its inaugural broadcast was a National Hockey League game. CHEX was founded by a media partnership that already published &quot;The Peterborough Examiner&quot; newspaper and owned radio station CHEX (now CKRU). The partnership included politician Rupert Davies, who was also involved in a similar arrangement in Kingston that established CKWS-TV. The Davies family sold its media interests to Power Corporation of Canada in 1976. On April 13, 2000, the station was acquired by Canadian media conglomerate Corus Entertainment.

On May 20, 2015, Corus and Bell Media announced an agreement whereby its three CBC stations would leave the public network (after 60 years in the case of CHEX) and &quot;affiliate&quot; with CTV. The affiliation switch took effect on August 31, 2015. Most TV service providers serving the region already carry CBLT, and any that did not would have to add a CBC affiliate such as CBLT to their basic services in order to comply with Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations. 

Legally, CHEX&#x27;s relationship with CTV was described as a &quot;program supply agreement&quot;, and not as an &quot;affiliation&quot; (a term with specific legal implications under CRTC rules), as Corus maintained editorial control over the stations&#x27; programming and the ability to sell local advertising, and did not delegate responsibility for CTV programs aired by the station to Bell Media. The switch was approved by the CRTC on August 27, 2015, dismissing objections by Rogers Media (who argued that the change was an &quot;affiliation&quot; and thus required CRTC consent to implement, and was not in the public interest because it created duplicate sources of CTV programming), and by a resident who complained that because he only received television over the air, he would lose his ability to receive CBC Television as a result of the disaffiliation.

Following the expiration of CHEX&#x27;s three-year deal with CTV, the station became a Global owned-and-operated station (O&amp;O) and rebranded itself as Global Peterborough on August 27, 2018; the CHEX branding was retained for the station&#x27;s newscasts.

== News operation ==
Local newscasts, branded as &quot;CHEX News&quot;, air weekdays from 6 to 9 a.m. and at noon, and nightly at 6 and 11 p.m.

In September 2016, CHEX began to replace CTV News programming with Global News programs, moving its late-night newscast to 11 p.m. to replace the &quot;CTV National News&quot; (the vacant timeslot at 11:30 p.m. was replaced with &quot;ET Canada&quot;), and adding an airing of &quot;Global National&quot;. On October 24, 2016, CHEX premiered a local morning newscast known as &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, which was patterned after the program of the same name aired by CIII-DT and the &quot;Global News Morning&quot; format used in other markets.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CHEX-TV began offering a high definition feed on Cogeco Cable in the Peterborough area in November 2010. The station switched its over-the-air signal from analogue to digital on May 9, 2013.

The CRTC has not listed Peterborough as one of its mandatory markets for analogue television shutdown and digital conversion, and as a result CHEX-TV was not required to convert to digital transmissions on the transition date of August 31, 2011.

===Transmitters===
In 1965, CHEX-TV was authorized to add a rebroadcast transmitter at Bancroft, Ontario on channel 2 as CHEX-TV-1, but it moved to channel 4 in 1973 to make room for a new Global transmitter (CIII-TV-2). In the late 1960s to early 1970s, a new rebroadcast transmitter was added in Minden to operate on channel 10 as CHEX-TV-2, later changed to channel 7. The Minden rebroadcaster was deleted during the 1980s. In 1992, a new rebroadcast transmitter was added to serve Oshawa and areas on channel 22, as CHEX-TV-2.

<text>CBEFT was the Radio-Canada owned-and-operated television station serving Franco-Ontarians in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. Previously licensed as a standalone television station, it later operated as a semi-satellite of Toronto station CBLFT-DT. It broadcast an analogue signal on UHF channel 35 from a transmitter near Concession Road 12 in Essex.

Owned by the Société Radio-Canada arm of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, it was a sister to CBC Television outlet CBET-DT and operated master control facilities at that station&#x27;s studios on Riverside Drive West and Crawford Avenue (near the Detroit River) in downtown Windsor.

On cable, CBEFT was seen on Cogeco Windsor channel 12. It was not seen on the Detroit-area systems, such as Comcast Detroit nor Bright House Livonia. The station broadcast at 144 kW with a directional antenna, relatively low for a full-powered analogue station on the UHF band. It could be picked up to some degree in the Detroit area, as far west as Washtenaw and Lenawee counties and as far south as Sandusky and Port Clinton, Ohio.

==History==

===CBEFT as originating station===
The station first aired on Channel 78 in 1976, making it Canada&#x27;s second-highest-numbered UHF station following the launch of CITY-TV in 1972 on Channel 79. Originally, it was a full-time satellite of Radio-Canada flagship CBFT in Montreal.

CBEFT was the first non-English TV station to sign-on in the Detroit-Windsor market — it would be later joined by Spanish-language SIN affiliate W66BV (channel 19, now WUDL-LD) in 1983. During that period, and again from 2004 to 2009, the Detroit/Windsor market was the only market in the United States or Canada with terrestrial stations in both Spanish and French; the Spanish station during the latter period was Univision affiliate WUDT-CA on channel 23. After WUDT switched to the English-language Daystar Television Network in August 2009, CBEFT again became the sole terrestrial non-English station in the market.

CBEFT offered the full Radio-Canada line-up, except for some American series; this is because Windsor is reckoned as part of the Detroit market for the purposes of programming rights. Also, most Montreal Expos baseball games were not seen on CBEFT, as Windsor is part of Detroit Tigers territory.

CBEFT moved to channel 54 on September 29, 1982, when TV channels above 69 were removed from the TV spectrum.

===CBEFT as rebroadcaster===
From the mid-1980s at the earliest, it was a semi-satellite of CBLFT in Toronto as part of the Ontario-Outaouais network. In 1991, as part of cost-cutting measures at the CBC, CBEFT&#x27;s licence, along with all other Radio-Canada transmitters in Ontario, was merged with that of CBOFT in Ottawa. However, CBEFT, along with CBLFT&#x27;s other former repeaters, carried the split-feed newscast for the rest of Ontario that was produced at CBOFT.

On April 28, 2010, the CRTC relicensed CBLFT as a standalone station, which would again produce a separate newscast for the province of Ontario outside of CBOFT&#x27;s primary market. At the same time, CBEFT was relicensed as a rebroadcaster of CBLFT. In recent years, CBEFT relayed CBLFT off a satellite link, which would get disrupted under severe weather conditions, which would cause its equipment to display an error message.

===Demise===
CBEFT was forced to move again to UHF 35 when channels 52–69 were removed from the television spectrum on August 31, 2011; the new channel was granted when other nearby stations that broadcast on channel 35 in analog - WDCQ-TV in Bad Axe, Michigan; WGVU-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan; WSEE-TV in Erie, Pennsylvania; and WLIO in Lima, Ohio - moved to new digital frequencies. CBEFT occupied analogue UHF 35 for less than a year before going permanently dark, as by 2011, the CBC had made clear that it had no plans to convert any non-originating stations in mandatory transition markets to digital. On August 16, 2011, the CRTC granted a one-year temporary extension to continue operation of 22 repeaters in mandatory markets, including CBEFT, in analogue until August 31, 2012.

On July 31, 2012, CBC and Radio-Canada decommissioned their entire network of re-transmitters nationwide, shutting down all 620 analogue signals permanently as a cost-cutting measure. The network abandoned its over-the-air viewers in every market in which it did not operate broadcast studios, regardless of whether the markets were required to convert to digital television.

No CBC or Radio-Canada television re-transmitters were converted to digital. CBC did convert CBEFT&#x27;s English language sister station CBET to digital, as it is an originating station.

On June 8, 2012, local Windsor NDP MPs Brian Masse and Joe Comartin asked CBC president Hubert Lacroix to reconsider shutting down CBEFT, recommending instead to install digital multiplexing equipment and carry CBEFT on a digital subchannel of sister station CBET-DT. This was also supported by Windsor City Council. CBC was not willing to implement digital subchannels to restore programming in Windsor or any other market in which one of the two languages was formerly provided by a re-broadcast transmitter. Current CRTC regulations permit subchannels, but require they be licensed separately.

On July 17, 2012, the CRTC approved the CBC&#x27;s plans to close down all repeaters, including CBEFT, by August 1, 2012. Their licenses were revoked at CBC&#x27;s request. As CBC retained valuable cable television slots in all communities which it had abandoned over-the-air, the network claims that only a minority of viewers have completely lost the signal.

Following CBEFT&#x27;s closure on August 1, 2012, the corresponding cable slot on Cogeco and other area systems was assigned to CBLFT.

<text>The Wien is a river that flows through the capital of Austria, Vienna.

==Geography==
The river Wien is long, of which are within the city. Its drainage basin covers an area of , both in the city and in the neighbouring Vienna Woods. Its source lies in the western Vienna Woods near Rekawinkel and its mouth at the eastern end of the city centre of Vienna, next to the Urania, where it flows into the Donaukanal (&quot;Danube Canal&quot;), a branch of the Danube.

The Wien is subject to huge variations in flow. In its headwaters in the Vienna Woods, the soil is underlain by sandstone. Because of this, during heavy rain the soil quickly saturates, resulting in substantial runoff. Thus, the flow of the Wien can quickly increase from a creek-like to in the heaviest rains or during the spring snowmelt in the Vienna Woods, a ratio of over 1:2000.

==The Wien River and the city of Vienna==
Within the city limits, the river bed consists almost entirely of concrete, which was installed between 1895 and 1899 in order to stop the devastating floods, sometimes accompanied by cholera, which the river had regularly caused before that time. At the same time, the Stadtbahn (&quot;city railway&quot;) was built, which makes use of the concrete river bed and is only separated from the river by a wall. It is now part of the Vienna U-Bahn system.

Along the course of the river, the Naschmarkt and the Theater an der Wien can be found. Much of the river is covered over in the city, particularly in front of Schönbrunn Palace, in the Meidling and Naschmarkt neighbourhoods and around Karlsplatz near the city centre.

The River Gate was built in the years 1903 to 1906 and was opened to the general public on 15 November 1906. The gate forms one of the most beautiful Jugendstil scenes to be found in the city of Vienna.

In 2013, the City of Vienna approved plans to build three terraces along the river valley. Each terrace (or &quot;zone&quot;) will cover a total area of . The first terrace was expected to be completed by 2015.

===Cycling and walking beside the Wien===

For safety reasons, cycling or walking in the concrete bed of the Wien is officially prohibited. A continually controversial topic is whether to build cycle paths and footpaths next to the water. Proponents believe the water flow can be safely regulated, while opponents do not believe this is possible. In 2005, a short segment was opened to the public, near Hütteldorf railway station. It features an audible and visual alarm system to warn users to leave the path if flooding is imminent. Extensions to this path have been proposed, but continue to receive much opposition. The path is open from March to October.

==Nomenclature==
In German, the river is colloquially called the &quot;&quot;. Since English uses the name &quot;Vienna&quot; for what in German is called &quot;&quot;, in English the river is sometimes called the &quot;Vienna River&quot;.

<doc id="1072201" wikidata="Q4597579" url="?curid=1072201" title="Gwen Guthrie">
<text>Gwendolyn Guthrie (July 9, 1950 – February 3, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter and pianist who also sang backing vocals for Aretha Franklin, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder, Peter Tosh, The Limit and Madonna, among others, and who wrote songs made famous by Ben E. King, Angela Bofill and Roberta Flack. Guthrie is well known for her 1986 anthem &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Goin&#x27; On but the Rent,&quot; and for her 1986 cover of the song &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You.&quot;

==Background==
Guthrie was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey. In school, she studied classical music, and her father began teaching her piano when she was eight years old. 
==Career==
===1970s===
By the early 1970s, Guthrie had joined vocal groups such as the Ebonettes and the Matchmakers, while working as an elementary school teacher. She also sang in the group “East Coast”, alongside Cameo singer Larry Blackmon. She was a backup singer on Aretha Franklin&#x27;s 1974 single &quot;I&#x27;m in Love&quot;.

Guthrie soon began moonlighting as a singer of commercial jingles, sometimes with her friend Valerie Simpson of Ashford &amp; Simpson fame. A song-writing partnership with then-boyfriend, trombonist/bassist Haras Fyre (professionally known as &quot;Patrick Grant&quot;) resulted in Ben E. King&#x27;s comeback single &quot;Supernatural Thing,&quot; an R&amp;B #1 (#5 pop) hit in 1975, and the follow-up, &quot;Do It In the Name of Love (#4 R&amp;B). They also wrote &quot;This Time I&#x27;ll Be Sweeter&quot; for Angela Bofill, which was later covered by numerous artists. Together they wrote seven tracks on Sister Sledge&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Circle of Love&quot;. &quot;Cross My Heart&quot;, &quot;Protect Our Love&quot;, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t You Go Through No Changes on Me&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Miss Him Now&quot;, &quot;Pain Reliever&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Much Better Off Loving Me&quot;, and &quot;Fireman&quot;. She also wrote Roberta Flack&#x27;s &quot;God Don&#x27;t Like Ugly&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1981 she sang a duet of Mitchell and Harris&#x27;s &quot;Nothing But Love&quot; with Peter Tosh on his album &quot;Wanted Dread and Alive.&quot;

As Guthrie&#x27;s solo career developed, she worked extensively with Sly and Robbie on dub-influenced club cuts and began racking up dance hits. She was dubbed &quot;The First Lady of the Paradise Garage,&quot; as several of her songs became anthems at that venue, helped by the frequent and dynamic performances she gave there. She soon teamed musically with famed Paradise Garage DJ Larry Levan and recorded her first major landmark hit &quot;Padlock&quot; in 1983 with the Compass Point All Stars in Nassau, Bahamas, which became a club and radio hit two years later. She also sang backup on Madonna&#x27;s 1982 debut album.&quot;

Guthrie recorded the single &quot;Hopscotch&quot;. Along with &quot;Bad Lady&quot; by Stone City Band and &quot;It&#x27;s You I Love (So in Love)&quot; by Pamela Nivens and Skip to My Lou&quot; by Finis Henderson III, it was one of the mentioned black contemporary Up and Coming singles in the 11 June issue of &quot;Cash Box&quot;. 

In 1984 Guthrie was featured on the club hit &quot;Say Yeah&quot; with the group The Limit featuring Dutch producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The track reached number 17 in the UK singles chart. Guthrie was also executive producer and singer on the minor hit &quot;Naughty Times&quot; by Cutty also released in 1984 on Hudson River Records.

Guthrie is probably best known for her 1986 dance anthem &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Goin&#x27; on But the Rent&quot;, a self-written and produced track that garnered some controversy for its materialistic lyrics such as: &quot;You&#x27;ve got to have a j-o-b if you want to be with me/No romance without finance.&quot;
&quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27; Goin&#x27; on But the Rent&quot; was later sampled by numerous dance and hip hop artists, notably by Foxy Brown in her 1998 song &quot;JOB&quot; featuring Mýa, and by Utah Saints for the original version of their hit &quot;What Can You Do for Me.&quot; The song is referenced in the Eddie Murphy monologue &quot;No Romance without Finance&quot; in his &quot;Eddie Murphy Raw&quot; comedy special. Guthrie also had a hit in 1986 with a cover of &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You,&quot; which reached number twenty-five on the UK Singles Chart the same year.

Her 1988 single &quot;Can&#x27;t Love You Tonight&quot; boldly addressed AIDS at a time when the disease was a rather taboo subject. Guthrie was an ally of the gay community, and of people with AIDS. Proceeds from the single went to the AIDS Coalition.

===1990s===
Other club hits by Guthrie include the Compass Point All Stars-produced &quot;Seventh Heaven,&quot; &quot;Peanut Butter,&quot; and &quot;Peek-a-Boo.&quot; &quot;Padlock&quot; was later covered by M People, who included it on their 1995 album &quot;Bizarre Fruit&quot;, featuring vocalist Heather Small. 

===Death===
Guthrie died of uterine cancer on February 3, 1999, at the age of 48, and was interred at Fairmount Cemetery in Newark, New Jersey.

<doc id="1072213" wikidata="Q3550861" url="?curid=1072213" title="Agricultural lime">
<text>Agricultural lime, also called aglime, agricultural limestone, garden lime or liming, is a soil additive made from pulverized limestone or chalk. The primary active component is calcium carbonate. Additional chemicals vary depending on the mineral source and may include calcium oxide. Unlike the types of lime called quicklime (calcium oxide) and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), powdered limestone does not require lime burning in a lime kiln; it only requires milling. All of these types of lime are sometimes used as soil conditioners, with a common theme of providing a base to correct acidity, but lime for farm fields today is often crushed limestone. Historically, liming of farm fields in centuries past was often done with burnt lime; the difference is at least partially explained by the fact that affordable mass-production-scale fine milling of stone and ore relies on technologies developed since the mid-19th century.

Some effects of agricultural lime on soil are:
* it increases the pH of acidic soil, reducing soil acidity and increasing alkalinity
* it provides a source of calcium for plants
* it improves water penetration for acidic soils
* it improves the uptake of major plant nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) of plants growing on acid soils.

Other forms of lime have common applications in agriculture and gardening, including dolomitic lime and hydrated lime. Dolomitic lime may be used as a soil input to provide similar effects as agricultural lime, while supplying magnesium in addition to calcium. In livestock farming, hydrated lime can be used as a disinfectant measure, producing a dry and alkaline environment in which bacteria do not readily multiply. In horticultural farming it can be used as an insect repellent, without causing harm to the pest or plant.

Spinner-style lime spreaders are generally used to spread agricultural lime on fields.

Agricultural lime is injected into coal burners at power plants to reduce the pollutants such as NO2 and SO2 from the emissions.

==Determining the need for agricultural lime==

Lime can improve crop yield and the root system of plants and grass where soils are acidic. It does this by making the soil more basic, allowing the plants to absorb more nutrients. Lime is not a fertilizer but can be used in combination with fertilizers.

Soils become acidic in several ways. Locations that have high rainfall levels become acidic through leaching. Land used for crop and livestock purposes loses minerals over time by crop removal and becomes acidic. The application of modern chemical fertilizers is a major contributor to soil acid by the process in which the plant nutrients react in the soil.

Aglime can also benefit soils where the land is used for breeding and raising foraging animals. Bone growth is key to a young animal&#x27;s development, and bones are composed primarily of calcium and phosphorus. Young mammals get their needed calcium through milk, which has calcium as one of its major components. Dairymen frequently apply aglime because it increases milk production.

The best way to determine if the soil is acidic or deficient in calcium or magnesium is with a soil test which a university can provide with an agricultural education department for under $30.00 for United States residents. Farmers typically become interested in soil testing when they notice a decrease in crop response to applied fertilizer.

&quot;Corrected lime potential&quot; is used in soil testing laboratories to indicate whether lime is required.

==Quality==

The quality of agricultural limestone is determined by the chemical makeup of the limestone and how finely the stone is ground. To aid the farmer in determining the relative value of competing agricultural liming materials, the agricultural extension services of several universities use two rating systems. Calcium Carbonate Equivalent (CCE) and the Effective Calcium Carbonate Equivalent (ECCE) give a numeric value to the effectiveness of different liming materials.

The CCE compares the chemistry of a particular quarry&#x27;s stone with the neutralizing power of pure calcium carbonate. Because each molecule of magnesium carbonate is lighter than calcium carbonate, limestones containing magnesium carbonate (dolomite) can have a CCE greater than 100 percent.

Because the acids in soil are relatively weak, agricultural limestones must be ground to a small particle size to be effective. The extension service of different states rate the effectiveness of stone size particles slightly differently. They all agree, however, that the smaller the particle size the more effective the stone is at reacting in the soil. Measuring the size of particles is based on the size of a mesh that the limestone would pass through. The mesh size is the number of wires per inch. Stone retained on an 8 mesh will be about the size of BB pellets. Material passing a 60 mesh screen will have the appearance of face powder. Particles larger than 8 mesh are of little or no value, particles between 8 mesh and 60 mesh are somewhat effective and particles smaller than 60 mesh are 100 percent effective.

By combining the chemistry of a particular product (CCE) and its particle size the Effective Calcium Carbonate Equivalent (ECCE) is determined. The ECCE is percentage comparison of a particular agricultural limestone with pure calcium carbonate with all particles smaller than 60 mesh. Typically the aglime materials in commercial use will have ECCE ranging from 45 percent to 110 percent.

==Brazil&#x27;s case==

Brazil&#x27;s vast inland cerrado region was regarded as unfit for farming before the 1960s because the soil was too acidic and poor in nutrients, according to Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman Borlaug, an American plant scientist referred to as the father of the Green Revolution. However, from the 1960s, vast quantities of lime (pulverised chalk or limestone) were poured into the soil to reduce acidity. The effort continued, and in the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tonnes of lime were spread on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tonnes in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tonnes of lime per hectare. As a result, Brazil has become the world&#x27;s second biggest soybean exporter, and thanks to the boom in animal feed production, Brazil is now the biggest exporter of beef and poultry in the world.

== Effect on prehistoric mobility studies ==
A 2019 study demonstrated that agricultural lime affects strontium-based mobility studies, which attempt to identify where individual prehistoric people lived. Agricultural lime has a significant effect in areas with calcium-poor soils. In a systematic study of a river system in Denmark, the Karup River, more than half of the strontium in the river&#x27;s catchment area was found to come from runoff of agricultural lime, and not from the surrounding natural environment. Such introduction of agricultural lime has resulted in researchers wrongly concluding that certain prehistoric individuals originated far abroad from their burial sites, because strontium isotopic results measured in their remains and personal effects were compared to burial sites contaminated by agricultural lime.

<doc id="1072223" wikidata="Q633140" url="?curid=1072223" title="Compliance (physiology)">
<text>Compliance is the ability of a hollow organ (vessel) to distend and increase volume with increasing transmural pressure or the tendency of a hollow organ to resist recoil toward its original dimensions on application of a distending or compressing force. The reciprocal of compliance is elastance, a measure of the tendency of a hollow organ to recoil toward its original dimensions upon removal of a distending or compressing force.

==Blood vessels==
The terms elastance and compliance are of particular significance in cardiovascular physiology and respiratory physiology. In compliance, an increase in volume occurs in a vessel when the pressure in that vessel is increased. The tendency of the arteries and veins to stretch in response to pressure has a large effect on perfusion and blood pressure. This physically means that blood vessels with a higher compliance deform easier than lower compliance blood vessels under the same pressure and volume conditions. 
Venous compliance is approximately 30 times larger than arterial compliance. 
Compliance is calculated using the following equation, where formula_1 is the change in volume (mL), and formula_2 is the change in pressure (mmHg): 
:formula_3

Physiologic compliance is generally in agreement with the above and adds &quot;formula_4&quot; as a common academic physiologic measurement of both pulmonary and cardiac tissues. Adaptation of equations initially applied to rubber and latex allow modeling of the dynamics of pulmonary and cardiac tissue compliance.
Veins have a much higher compliance than arteries (largely due to their thinner walls.) Veins which are abnormally compliant can be associated with edema. Pressure stockings are sometimes used to externally reduce compliance, and thus keep blood from pooling in the legs.

 Vasodilation and vasoconstriction are complex phenomena; they are functions not merely of the fluid mechanics of pressure and tissue elasticity but also of active homeostatic regulation with hormones and cell signaling, in which the body produces endogenous vasodilators and vasoconstrictors to modify its vessels&#x27; compliance. For example, the muscle tone of the smooth muscle tissue of the tunica media can be adjusted by the renin–angiotensin system. In patients whose endogenous homeostatic regulation is not working well, dozens of pharmaceutical drugs that are also vasoactive can be added. The response of vessels to such vasoactive substances is called vasoactivity (or sometimes vasoreactivity). Vasoactivity can vary between persons because of genetic and epigenetic differences, and it can be impaired by pathosis and by age. This makes the topic of haemodynamic response (including vascular compliance and vascular resistance) a matter of medical and pharmacologic complexity beyond mere hydraulic considerations (which are complex enough by themselves).

The relationship between vascular compliance, pressure, and flow rate is:formula_5

===Arterial compliance===

The classic definition by MP Spencer and AB Denison of compliance (formula_6) is the change in arterial blood volume (formula_1) due to a given change in arterial blood pressure (formula_2). They wrote this in the &quot;Handbook of Physiology&quot; in 1963 in work entitled &quot;Pulsatile Flow in the Vascular System&quot;. So, formula_9.

Arterial compliance is an index of the elasticity of large arteries such as the thoracic aorta. Arterial compliance is an important cardiovascular risk factor. Compliance diminishes with age and menopause. Arterial compliance is measured by ultrasound as a pressure (carotid artery) and volume (outflow into aorta) relationship.

Compliance, in simple terms, is the degree to which a container experiences pressure or force without disruption. It is used as an indication of arterial stiffness. An increase in the age and also in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is accompanied with decrease on arterial compliance.

Endothelial dysfunction results in reduced compliance (increased arterial stiffness), especially in the smaller arteries. This is characteristic of patients with hypertension. However, it may be seen in normotensive patients (with normal blood pressure) before the appearance of clinical hypertension. Reduced arterial compliance is also seen in patients with diabetes and also in smokers. It is actually a part of a vicious cycle that further elevates blood pressure, aggravates atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and leads to increased cardiovascular risk. Arterial compliance can be measured by several techniques. Most of them are invasive and are not clinically appropriate. Pulse contour analysis is a non-invasive method that allows easy measurement of arterial elasticity to identify patients at risk for cardiovascular events.

<doc id="1072231" wikidata="Q7727535" url="?curid=1072231" title="The CooCoo Nut Grove">
<text>The CooCoo Nut Grove is a 1936 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short animated film, set in the famed Cocoanut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. This is a caricature cartoon, with recreations of celebrities from the time. The cartoon was directed by Friz Freleng, with animation by Robert McKimson and Sandy Walker, caricature design by T. Hee, and musical score by Carl Stalling. The short was released on November 28, 1936.

==Plot==
The short opens with a scene of a full moon reflecting on water lined with palm trees. &quot;Thru&#x27; the Courtesy of Love&quot; (Scholl/Jerome) plays during the opening scene. The camera pans to the Coo-Coonut Grove, &#x27;Dine and Dance with the Stars&#x27;, reflecting the Cocoanut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel, where many Academy Award shows were held in the 1930s/40s. The camera pans to a star lined hall, with various caricatures of Hollywood stars from the 1930s. Noticeable are Fred Astaire in the lower right corner, Bette Davis (left side, 2nd table from the bottom), Lionel Barrymore (right side, 3rd from the bottom) and Jean Harlow, 2nd table from the bottom.

Master of Ceremonies Ben Birdie (bandleader Ben Bernie, voiced by Tedd Pierce) is accosted by Walter Windpipe (Walter Winchell, voiced by Danny Webb), and proceeds to blow Windpipe out of the tuba from which he has emerged. At the time of this short&#x27;s creation, Winchell and Bernie were engaged in a mock feud. The short then proceeds to showcase many Hollywood stars in the form of Ralph Barton-esque caricatures, starting with Hugh Herbert, W.C Fields as a hog (voiced by Tedd Pierce), speaking with Katharine Hepburn (represented as an aloof mare, named &quot;Miss Heartburn&quot;), Ned Sparks (voiced by Dave Barry) stating &quot;I go everywhere, I do everything, and I never have any fun&#x27;. Following this, the camera pans up the tree to where Lupe Vélez and husband Johnny Weissmuller, dressed as Tarzan, are sharing a small table. Weissmuller proceeds to give Tarzan&#x27;s signature call.

The camera cuts back to Birdie, who comments on the arrival of &#x27;profile of profilers&#x27;, John Barrymore, who walks to his table keeping his head positioned in order to display his &#x27;perfect profile&#x27;. A woman wearing a purple hat and a yellow dress designed with a pattern of purple flowers runs by, with her face away from the camera. She is being chased by Harpo Marx, one of the Marx Brothers, who is drawn as a bird honking a horn. A traffic light and a stop sign pop from his hat and he skids to a stop. He revs up and gets moving again when a traffic light and a go sign pop from the hat. All of this is done without Harpo saying a word, as befits his act. Birdie suggests the club members start dancing, all depicted as birds, get up and dance. Many of the male birds are wearing turtlenecks and smoking. A blonde bird with a large black hat dances with an old turtle, the bird being Mae West (voiced by Verna Deane), the turtle George Arliss. Laurel and Hardy appear as a pig (Hardy) and a monkey (Laurel), watching the dancing.

There is then a shot of the caricatures at their tables. Clockwise from the top we see Laurel and Hardy, John Barrymore, still facing profile, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable (with his ears prominently shown, a joke on his large ears), W. C. Fields, and Katharine Hepburn. The lights dim, and Edna May Oliver takes the centre of the room, dancing to &quot;&quot;The Lady in Red&quot;, with a spotlight shining on her. Gable claps his ears instead of his hands. The camera flips between Oliver, and Gary Cooper. Three monkeys comment on Cooper, a reference to the three old women in &quot;Mr. Deeds Goes to Town&quot;, before the camera turns to Oliver one last time. She leaves, and a &#x27;curtain&#x27;, which is actually five diapers pinned to a clothesline, rises to reveal the Dionne quintuplets (voiced by Bernice Hansen), who sing a song. The quintuplets finish their number, and we see Vélez and Weissmuller, atop their tree, applauding. A mouse runs by, scaring Weissmuller enough that he faints. An annoyed Vélez adopts his signature Tarzan scream, takes him under one arm, grabs a vine and swings away through the treetops. The woman in the yellow dress is once again chased by Harpo Marx, though this time he catches her. She turns to face the camera, and is revealed to be Groucho Marx. Harpo runs away and the screen fades to black.

The screen then opens with drops of water falling to the ground, as we hear a singer performing a sad song. The camera pans up to a woman in a black dress, perched on a piano, weeping as she sings a torch song, &quot;The Little Things You Used To Do&quot;. This woman is Helen Morgan (voiced by Verna Deane). A very tearful Wallace Beery squeezes a banana onto a knife and consumes the fruit while continuing to shed tears. The camera shows Morgan crying again, before switching to Harpo and his river of tears. Actors Edward G. Robinson (in green, on the left) and George Raft (in red, on the right), continue with their &#x27;tough guy&#x27; persona before giving up, bursting into sobs and embracing each other.

The closing shots have Morgan on the piano, while the Marx Brothers, Hepburn, Fields, Beery, Laurel and Hardy, et alia float away on their tables, the CooCoo Nut Grove flooded with tears. Arliss as a turtle paddles away with oars. Ben Birdie closes the cartoon with his signature &#x27;cheerio, pip-pip, and good night&#x27;.

==Production notes==
*The title is sometimes mislabeled as The Coo-Coo Nut Groove. This cartoon was followed by &quot;The Woods Are Full Of Cuckoos&quot; (1937) and &quot;Have You Got Any Castles?&quot; (1938), both parodying Hollywood personalities.
*The 1935 song “Rhythm Steps” by Herbie Kay and his orchestra is heard after the Ben Bernie caricature says, “Now we’ll indulge in a bit of the light fantastical, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.”
*T. Hee, the cartoonist hired for this picture, was hired by to do caricatures after Frank Tashlin (or Tash) saw his drawings in the Examiner (particularly of Clark Gable and Greta Garbo). Taking the opening at Warner Brothers, he was then selected by Isadore &#x27;Friz&#x27; Freleng to work on the &#x27;CooCoo Nut Grove&#x27;. Hee was then so sought after he left Warner Bros to work for Disney, notably in &quot;Mother Goose Goes Hollywood&quot;.

<doc id="1072232" wikidata="Q4776140" url="?curid=1072232" title="Antonga Black Hawk">
<text>Antonga, or Black Hawk (born c. 1830; died September 26, 1870), was a nineteenth-century war chief of the Timpanogos tribe in what is the present-day state of Utah. He led the Timpanogos against Mormon settlers and gained alliances with Paiute and Navajo bands in the territory against them during what became known as the Black Hawk War in Utah (1865–1872). Although Black Hawk made peace in 1867, other bands continued raiding until the US intervened with about 200 troops in 1872. Black Hawk died in 1870 from a gunshot wound he received while trying to rescue a fallen warrior, White Horse, at Gravely Ford Richfield, Utah, June 10, 1866. The wound never healed and complications set in.

The names &quot;Black Hawk&quot; and &quot;Antonga&quot; by which he was known are not Ute Indian names. &quot;Black Hawk&quot; was a name that Brigham Young, in jest, called the Ute leader. Young&#x27;s term became the name by which he is now most commonly known. There were some three or more Indians the whites referred to as Black Hawk in Utah history. It is reminiscent of Chief Black Hawk of the Sauk and Meskwaki peoples and the Black Hawk War of 1832 in Illinois, where the Mormons had migrated from.

To the Mexicans he was known as &quot;Antonga&quot;, also not a Ute name. The Timpanogos had long established trade relations with the Mexicans. Utah&#x27;s Black Hawk was the son of Chief Sanpitch; in the &quot;Dominguez Escalante Journal: Their Expedition Through Colorado Utah Arizona and New Mexico in 1776&quot;, Escalante describes having come in contact with aboriginal peoples who were Snake-Shoshoni who called themselves &quot;Timpanogostzis&quot;, an Aztecan-Shoshonian word meaning &quot;People of the Rock water carriers&quot; (referring to rock salt), whose leader was Turunianchi. Turunianchi had a son named Munch.

Munch was the father of Sanpitch, Wakara, Arropeen, Tabby, Ammon, Sowiette, and Grospeen, who occupied a land that is now known as Utah. Dominguez named Mount Timpanogos, Timpanogos River (Provo River), Timpanogos Lake (Utah Lake) and Timpanogos Valley (Utah Valley) in honor of these people, an honor that remains to this day. Government maps that predate Mormon settlement support this fact. Then in 1824, explorer Etienne Provost entered what is now Utah and reported having come in contact with a Snake-Shoshone tribe (Timpanogos) living along the Timpanogos River (Provo River) and Timpanogos Lake. Provo City derives its name from this early explorer.

==History==
In 1847 the first Mormon pioneers arrived in the territory, where indigenous peoples had lived for thousands of years. Historic tribes included the Timpanogos, Paiute and Navajo. In 1865 Black Hawk and the Timpanogos started raiding the livestock and goods of the steadily encroaching settlers. The white population had dramatically increased to about 50,000 at a time when the Timpanogos population is estimated to have been 15,000 to 20,000. Epidemics of measles and smallpox had caused many deaths among the Timpanogos, as they had no immunity to the new diseases; the rate of tuberculosis (TB) was high because of the weakened condition of the people. Mormon farming of domesticated crops and animals had altered the environment, driving off the game which was the Timpanogos&#x27; main source of food. By 1865 hundreds of Timpanogos were starving. .

When Chief &quot;Wah-Kara&quot; died unexpectedly in 1855, his brother Arapeen succeeded him and, when Chief Arapeen too died in 1860, his son Jake &quot;Arropeen&quot; (also known as &quot;Yene-wood&quot;) became chief by succession. In 1865 the Mormons and Utes were negotiating to reach some sort of agreement at Manti; discussions ended when &quot;Arropeen&quot; was pulled from his horse by the settler John Lowry, who was believed to be drunk at the time. Dishonored before his people, Chief &quot;Arropeen&quot; considered the incident a grave insult in a 30-year history of encroachment and depredations against the Ute people. Retaliating for the insult, that day Black Hawk raided some settlers for cattle and soon his forces killed five men. He was then about 35 years old. This marked the start of what the Mormons later named &quot;The Black Hawk War&quot;.

The Black Hawk War in Utah began in 1865 and ended in 1872. It was a three-part war, involving 16 tribes of the Timpanogos, and allied bands of Paiute and Navajo, who declared war against the Mormon settlers. For years the US government ignored requests for aid from the Mormons, as many Federal leaders wanted to displace the LDS Church from its dominance of settlers in Utah. Mormon settlers fought to maintain control of what they called &quot;Zion&quot;, long the traditional territory of the Ute people.

The 21st-century Utah historian John Alton Peterson describes Black Hawk as having

remarkable vision and capacity. Given the circumstances under which he operated, he put together an imposing war machine and masterminded a sophisticated strategy that suggest he had a keen grasp of the economic, political, and geographic contexts in which he operated. Comparable to Cochise, Sitting Bull and Geronimo, Black Hawk fostered an extraordinary pan-regional movement that enabled him to operate in an enormous section of country and establish a three-face war. Black Hawk worked to establish a barrier to white expansion and actually succeeded in collapsing the line of Mormon settlement, causing scores of villages in over a half dozen counties to be abandoned. For almost a decade the tide of white expansion in Utah came to a dead stop and in most of the territory actually receded. Like other defenders of Indian rights, though, Black Hawk found he could not hold his position, and his efforts eventually crumbled.

Ute history notes that Black Hawk made peace with the &quot;pale-faces&quot; in 1867. He visited every white village from Cedar City to Payson to plead with the settlers to try to make peace. Without his leadership, the conflict was reduced, but raids continued until US forces intervened in 1872. Black Hawk died in 1870, before the end of the war, of tuberculosis.

The Black Hawk War was not a single incident, but a series of raids and small-scale conflicts. More than 150 engagements took place over a seven-year period throughout Utah territory and the conflict spilled over into Colorado, Idaho, and Wyoming. Although migration had slowed during the war years, soon tens of thousands of Mormon pioneers entered the area again, at the rate of 3,000 a month.. By contrast, in 1909 an official government census showed that the Ute population had declined to just 2,400..

<text>Spira is the fictional world of the Square role-playing video games &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot;. Spira is the first &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; world to feature consistent, all-encompassing spiritual and mythological influences within the planet&#x27;s civilizations and their inhabitants&#x27; daily lives. The world of Spira itself is different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, being much more closely modeled on a setting influenced by the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan, most notably with respect to its vegetation, topography and architecture.

The creation of Spira includes distinct ethnic minorities including a portrayal of the fictional Al Bhed language that is prevalent throughout the game&#x27;s dialogue. The backstory and concept behind the dark religious themes of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; were a central theme to the story and their ultimate resolution was well received. The popularity of the &quot;Eternal Calm&quot; video served as the impetus of Square Enix to do &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; to make their first direct sequel in video game form and depict the evolution of Spiran society after religious and political upheaval results in new factions and instability in the world. Spira and its inhabiting characters have been featured in several other Square Enix works including &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and its prequel &quot;Dissidia 012&quot;, three games within the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series and &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;.

There have been numerous academic essays on the game&#x27;s presentation, narrative and localization aspects. Washburn writes that mastering the game comes with the mastering of the cultural knowledge of Spira to unlock skills and abilities. O&#x27;Hagan writes on the localization of the games that impact the game experience, detailing alterations to the script and dialogue with modifications, additions and omissions. Another aspect was that the presentation of Spira without an overworld view can be considered a pioneer in 3D role-playing game maps.

== Concept and creation ==
In speaking about the inspiration behind Spira, producer Yoshinori Kitase recounted that players had found fault with the science fiction atmosphere of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;VIII&quot;, instead desiring a &quot;simple fantasy world&quot;. To Kitase, the word &quot;fantasy&quot; did not indicate a purely medieval European setting, so he intentionally set out with the objective of redefining the stereotype held in players&#x27; minds. Nomura identified the South Pacific, Thailand, and Japan as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly in regard to the geographic locations of Besaid and Kilika. Yusuke Naora, the art director, noted that during the concept stage many people on the project were interested in Asian themes including Nojima and Kitase. For Zanarkand, the Tajik city of Samarkand has been cited as an inspiration.

Nomura said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games most notably in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.

Koji Sugimoto, main programmer for characters, said that the complexities of the PlayStation 2 hardware made mastering it difficult, but more rewarding because the details on Yuna&#x27;s sleeves to the depiction of shine and shadow could be rendered more realistically. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was the first game that allowed for 3-D model rendering of backgrounds that increased the presentation, including small details like grass blowing in the wind and cloud movement. Takayoshi Nakazato decided to abandon the typical world map concept for a more realistic depiction. &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s spatial presentation of Spira is tied to progression, with a player&#x27;s progress being marked through the panoramic introduction and depiction of the area upon first entry. Chiharu Minekawa, the supervising sound editor, commented that the transition in sound from one environment to the next was done seamlessly in order to mimic the natural surroundings of these environments as the player moved through them.

The decision to create &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; came after fan response to the &quot;Eternal Calm&quot; in the International Edition of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; which depicted events two years following Yuna&#x27;s final battle. The dark religious theme of the first game was concluded and the cultural changes were explored as the people of Spira focus on fashion that &quot;reflects their state of mind&quot;. Toriyama believes the most important element incorporated into &quot;X-2&quot; was the &quot;peaceful world of Spira achieved in &quot;X&quot; and unification of characters&#x27; state of mind&quot;. Kitase identified &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s theme as &quot;independence from the ties of law and customs&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot;″s theme is about &quot;the changes that occurred from the chaos after gaining that independence&quot;.

For &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; many pop culture references were used, including &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; and with the transformation of the dress spheres being a reference to the magical girl genre of anime.

=== Remastering ===
Square Enix chose to update &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot;″s graphics for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented that he wanted to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues off-screen, so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.

== Setting ==
===Geography===

The main landmass of Spira is surrounded by small islands, including: Besaid, a tropical town serving as the origin of Yuna&#x27;s pilgrimage; Kilika, a larger island featuring dense jungles and numerous conflicts during the games; and the desert island of Bikanel, which is also the location of the Al Bhed&#x27;s headquarters — &quot;Home&quot;. The ruins of Baaj Temple are on an island to the south of the Spira mainland; this is where Tidus begins his journey in Spira.

The mainland of Spira is where the bulk of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; takes place. The southernmost location of the mainland, Luca, is a large city home to Spira&#x27;s pastime, Blitzball. North of Luca is the mountainous area of Djose, which features a Yevonite temple. Connecting Luca and Djose are several roads: the Mi&#x27;ihen Highroad, a historical path that features Chocobos for transportation; the Mushroom Rock Road, home of the failed operation to defeat Sin; and Djose Highroad, a rocky path that forks north into the Moonflow and east to Djose Temple.

The Moonflow is a large river running through the heart of Spira, featuring shoopuf rides, ancient ruins, and a high density of pyreflies. A path from the Moonflow leads to Guadosalam, home of the Guado race and the gateway to the . North of Guadosalam are the Thunder Plains, which are the site of a never-ending thunderstorm made safe by lightning rods calibrated by the Al Bhed. The Thunder Plains lead into Macalania, a sparkling forest complemented by a frozen lake and a Yevonite temple.

Bevelle, the spiritual center of the Yevon religion, lies on a thin strip of land slightly north of Macalania. The city is built as a series of layers, with the headquarters of Yevon located at the top. The Via Purifico, located beneath Bevelle, serves as an oubliette for outcasts. Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains that have been the site of numerous battles in Spira&#x27;s history; the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt. Gagazet, home of the Ronsos. Lastly, the sacred city of Zanarkand is on the northern tip of the Spiran mainland, reduced to ruins by Sin one thousand years before the events of &quot;FFX&quot;.

&quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; features several changes to the locations of Spira. The Djose Temple, abandoned by a faltering Yevon after &quot;X&quot;, becomes the headquarters of the Machine Faction; likewise, the Youth League sets up their headquarters at the site of the failed operation on the Mushroom Rock Road. Bevelle remains the capital of the New Yevon faction, although the game introduces a large, technological area hidden beneath the city. Several new enterprises have been started, including a new pastime in Luca called Sphere Break; a group of entertainers at the Moonflow; a tourist service at the Zanarkand Ruins; and machina transportation in favor of Chocobos on the Mi&#x27;ihen Highroad. Lastly, the death of the Aeons at the end of &quot;X&quot; causes the Macalania forest and lake to melt, sinking the former Yevon temple and destroying the forest&#x27;s life. &quot;X-2&quot; also introduces floating ruins atop Mt. Gagazet and previously unexplored caverns throughout Spira.

=== Creatures and races ===

Although it is predominantly populated by humanoids, Spira features a variety of races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca. The Al Bhed is a unique ethnic group which plays an important role in the storyline and world of the games with distinctive green eyes with spiral-shaped pupils. The culture and conflicts of the Al Bhed permeate the games. The main character Rikku is Al Bhed, and Yuna is part Al Bhed on her mother&#x27;s side and assistance in gaining through a cast of supporting Al Bhed character&#x27;s, prevalent in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. With the collapse of the teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end of &quot;X&quot;, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time of &quot;X-2&quot;, though it is still present.

The Al Bhed speak their own &quot;language&quot; which is really just a substitution cipher of Japanese (English in the English localization of the game), a system of transposing certain letters for others; however, within the game world, it is intended to be an actual language. The original Japanese version of the cipher uses the syllable-based kana system of writing where each symbol represents a combination of &quot;consonant + vowel&quot; or simply a vowel. Certain keywords are not translated into Al Bhed in the game, to give the impression of use of loanwords compared to modern foreign languages. Most keywords are proper nouns, but some common nouns also are not translated, such as &quot;fiend&quot; (e.g. &quot;Y fiend! Eh risyh teckieca!&quot; [A &quot;fiend&quot;! In human disguise!]). Alexander Smith decided to &quot;map common phonemes in English to common phonemes in Welsh&quot; and gave preference to Welsh pronunciations, but had to work with new diphthongs to maintain consistency in the Al Bhed language.

Several other races are found throughout Spira, including the Guado, the Hypello, and the Ronso races. The Guado are an arboreal humanoid race with long limbs and fingers, pale skin, and wild, tangled hair. The Guado are the keepers of the entryway to the Farplane, where the dead are sent and have the unique ability to &quot;smell the deceased&quot; and other abilities related to pyreflies. The Ronso are a race of horned, blue-furred, lion-like humanoids who live on Mt. Gagazet, which they consider sacred and guard fiercely. Ronso are tall and formidable warriors with a strong sense of honor and loyalty. A subplot of &quot;FFX&quot; involves Kimahri Ronso&#x27;s conflict with his social status that results in his leadership of the Ronso in &quot;X-2&quot;. The Hypello are a docile, amphibious race with blue skin and live primarily in and around the area of the Moonflow. Though extremely quick and agile swimmers, they are the only race in Spira that does not participate in Blitzball tournaments. The male Hypello are all voiced by John DeMita.

Spira also features various animal species and fictional species, such as the gigantic shoopuf and the chocobo that are used primarily for transport purposes. Most other unusual creatures encountered in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; are &quot;fiends&quot;, monsters created from the restless dead by Pyreflies to devour the living. Aeons and the unsent are also forms created by pyreflies. Sin, the bringer of destruction, is a powerful fiend that is made of high-density pyreflies; it can control gravitation forces to replenish its strength and even fly. Sin&#x27;s high concentration of pyreflies affect the pyreflies present in the bodies of those present, and is known as &quot;Sin&#x27;s toxin&quot;. Despite the Final Summoning being able to destroy Sin itself, the central core of Sin, which is an entity known as Yu Yevon, would survive. From this, Sin is &quot;reborn&quot; after a time.

===Fictional history===
Spira&#x27;s history centers around an ancient war a thousand years prior to the start of the game between Bevelle and Zanarkand, the latter&#x27;s ruler deeming his city&#x27;s eventual demise and reserve to preserve its memory. Yevon&#x27;s people became the fayth to create this manifestation and Yevon made himself the core of a powerful monster known as Sin to protect it, though the process destroyed his mind as he continuously maintains Sin&#x27;s summoning as the creature is compelled to destroy. Through the machinations of Yevon&#x27;s daughter Yunalesca, Bevelle established a religious faith built on atonement and sacrifice to conceal the spiral of death that runs throughout Spira&#x27;s history. This process involves Yunalesca teaching a summoner a ritual known as &quot;the Final Summoning&quot;, which would give Spira a brief reprieve from Sin&#x27;s terror in a period known the . However, the Final Summoning is based on a strong bond, and requires a summoner to turn their guardian into the Fayth of a Final Aeon whose summoning kills the summoner who is memorialized as a high summoner. Though the Final Aeon can destroy Sin, it would become a new vessel of Yu Yevon and turned into a new Sin.

A thousand years following the establishment of the Yevon Order, Spira became a rustic land, almost completely devoid of large cities and higher civilization. Due to the actions of Sin, and the Yevon ban on machina, few territories reached larger than hamlet size, as they were destroyed by Sin and their populations decimated before they were able to develop. The only cities left larger than small villages were Luca, which houses the only blitzball stadium in Spira, and Bevelle, the center of the temples of Yevon. Yuna and her guardians break the cycle and bring about the &quot;Eternal Calm&quot;.

As a result of the events in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, in &quot;X-2&quot; the teachings of Yevon were deemed invalid after the order&#x27;s secrets were exposed while the Al Bhed accepted by the Spirans with association with machina no longer sacrilegious. Spirans in general had a positive outlook with the onset of the Eternal Calm. New political groups fought for power, two being the Youth League, the New Yevon Party, while Machine Faction seeks to salvage machina. Yuna ultimately restores peace and saves Spira a second time with multiple endings based on the player&#x27;s performance.

=== Mythos ===
In the world of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and its sequel, many supernatural elements influence events in the fictional world of Spira, defining the life of the planet&#x27;s inhabitants. Magic, spiritual energy, and the power of memories are heavily intertwined, and their effects manifest in a number of situations, including sporting events, religious practices, technology, and even in some of the native wildlife of the planet. The most popular pastime is Blitzball. The depiction of Sin as an &quot;existence that agonizes the world&quot; and as a &quot;disaster with form&quot; plays an important role in Spira&#x27;s everyday life throughout the game. In &quot;X-2&quot;, the population of Spira pursues additional leisures including attending concerts and a coin-collecting fad called Sphere Break.

In Spira, when a person dies suddenly and unexpectedly, his or her life force, manifested as pyreflies, must be released from the body and sent to the Farplane, the final resting place of departed souls. If the sending is not performed, the body&#x27;s spirit may remain trapped in the physical plane and take on the form of a fiend. A spirit of the dead may resist the transformation into a fiend, even when not sent and remain among the living, they are &quot;unsent&quot;. The unsent play a prominent role in the storyline and mythos, including the playable character Auron and other characters including Maester Jyscal Guado, Shuyin, and Lady Yunalesca.

==== Pyreflies ====
Pyreflies are a mysterious, naturally occurring phenomenon that heavily influence the events of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot;, as well as the world of Spira at large. Heavily prevalent throughout Spira, these &quot;bundles of life energy&quot; are closely associated with death and other spiritual events and entities by the people of Spira. At high concentrations, Pyreflies are capable of recording memories, sights and sounds. Pyreflies are also associated with many commonplace technological innovations including sphere-shaped recording devices and large, suspended spherical conglomerations of congealed water (called &quot;sphere pools&quot;) that serve as the playing field for blitzball games. The pyreflies are also a source of raw energy to empower the giant machina, Vegnagun. Shinra of the Gullwings suggests that the life energy flowing through Spira on the Farplane could possibly be harnessed for the purpose of supplying electricity to a city. In interviews published in the &quot;Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania&quot; guidebooks, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima and producer Yoshinori Kitase revealed that &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot; share a plot-related connection, in which the Shin-ra corporation in &quot;VII&quot; is founded on another planet after about one thousand years, after space travel became possible, by descendants of Shinra of the Gullwings in &quot;X-2&quot;. This connection was conceived only after &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was already finished and realized in &quot;X-2&quot; riding on the success of the original game and is not reflected in the gameplay or storylines of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; or &quot;X&quot;.

==== Religion ====
Religion is an important part of life for many of the peoples of Spira, with a large majority of the population describing themselves as &quot;Yevonites&quot;. Though by the end of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; some people had begun to question them, nevertheless the teachings of Yevon were millennium-old and heavily influential. The Yevonite clergy taught that Sin was a divine punishment set upon the people for their pride in the use of machines. As a result, the temples forbade the use of modern technology, and promoted a culture of atonement for past sins in the hopes of appeasing Sin.

While the Yevon church forbids most machina including weapons, their capital Bevelle retains machina to ensure its dominance. The Al Bhed are seen as dangerous to the Yevon clergy because they use machina and pose a threat to the church&#x27;s uncontested control of Spira. The church retains its power by role in using the Final Summoning which results in the sacrifice of the summoner and her guardian to prevent its secrets from being divulged. Though Yevon set up Operation Mi&#x27;ihen to instill further loyalty to the teachings by making the Crusaders use machina that would never win against Sin. By the end of &quot;FFX&quot;, the Yevon religion was effectively disbanded once evidence of its corruption was discovered, and its remaining priests volunteered the truth. Half a year later, the moral teachings of Yevon were revitalized in the form of the New Yevon Party, later led in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; by Praetor Baralai. Although technically a splinter group of Yevon, the New Yevon party was not a religion, but a simple philosophy, their motto and position on Spira&#x27;s advancement being &quot;One thing at a time&quot;.

In &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; the is an important song. Its fictional history started as a song of defiance turned scripture and has numerous variations that is played throughout the game throughout Yuna&#x27;s journey, primarily as the music of the temples. Though the Hymn&#x27;s words apparently have no discernible meaning within the context of Spira, the lyricist and scenario writer, Kazushige Nojima, composed a small puzzle with the lyrics, using Japanese syllables. When properly deciphered, they form sentences that translates thus: &quot;Pray to Yu Yevon. Dream, fayth. Forever and ever, grant us prosperity&quot;. The hymn was composed and arranged by Nobuo Uematsu and Masashi Hamauzu.

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s negative depiction of organized religion has been compared to the Catholic Church and the corruptibility of organized religion in general with the ultimate battle against a god. Stark writes that the game is a thesis on religion and the final battle with Yu Yevon offers a discourse on how to defeat it, by &quot;let[ting] it die a slow death, murder it with sheer force, or utilize one&#x27;s knowledge of the (game) world to give it no power to stand on&quot;. &quot;The Game Theorists&quot; add additional concepts, going further as to cite &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; as &quot;anti-religion&quot;.

==== Aeons and fayth ====
The are humans who willingly give up their lives to have their souls sealed in statues and commune with summoners with whom they have established a mental link. This link grants a summoner access to a fayth&#x27;s dreams and enables him or her to physically realize those dreams as , powerful creatures which may be employed to aid the summoner in battle or in a time of special need. During the events of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, the fayth of the aeon Bahamut serves as the chosen representative of the fayth as a collective. The fayth aids High Summoner Yuna and her guardians in bringing the spiral of death to an end, which results in their own passing. In &quot;X-2&quot;, the fayth return in their aeon forms, this time having been overcome by the despair and malice of Shuyin, rendering them his unwilling puppets of chaos. Yuna and her allies free both the fayth and Shuyin from the darkness that has consumed them. Ten aeons are identified in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;: Valefor, Ifrit, Shiva, Ixion, Bahamut, Anima, Yojimbo and the three Magus Sisters. The game builds on mythological figures through the inclusion of the aeons, such as the Arabic Ifrit, the Hindu deity Shiva and even the Jungian figure Anima and the demon Valefor. Wilder wrote on the Jungian analysis of Anima and tied Square Enix&#x27;s depiction of the Aeon as both a representation of Seymour&#x27;s corruption. Wilder analyzes the chained and blinded depiction of the figure that is Seymour&#x27;s mother and tying the form to her bound to servitude to Seymour in his descent into madness.

==== Militant factions ====
The Crusaders (formerly known as the &quot;Crimson Blades&quot;) were a loosely-knit army that existed to protect towns and temples from Sin. The group was founded by Lord Mi&#x27;ihen, who made a journey to Bevelle 800 years ago to calm the maesters&#x27; fears that he was assembling an army to conquer them. Mi&#x27;ihen managed to win their trust, and the Crimson Blades were thereafter inducted into the Yevon clergy as the Crusaders. The road Mi&#x27;ihen had walked was renamed the &quot;Mi&#x27;ihen Highroad&quot; in his honor. Unlike guardians, Crusaders are directly related to the temples. No non-Yevonite is permitted to serve as a Crusader, although there are unofficial chapters composed entirely of people who have been excommunicated. All of the Crusaders were excommunicated, however, when they set up Operation Mi&#x27;ihen, a joint Crusader-Al Bhed attempt to destroy Sin with a giant machina weapon. The operation failed and the Crusaders were largely eradicated in the process. A group known as the Crimson Squad was also formed around Operation Mi&#x27;ihen. Three candidates survived the final exercise; Baralai, Nooj and Gippal, all of whom would eventually lead one of the three political factions during the events of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;.

== Appearances ==
Spira is the world of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot;, but elements of its world and characters have been included in other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; media. For &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy&quot; and its prequel &quot;Dissidia 012&quot; the characters Tidus, Yuna, Jecht and an area known as were featured. The Dreams&#x27; End shares similarities to the final area of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; complete with a large replica of Jecht&#x27;s sword in the center. Tidus and Wakka are supporting characters in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and its follow-ups &quot;Chain of Memories&quot; and &quot;Coded&quot;. Auron makes an appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; as a supporting team member and &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;″s main cast of Yuna, Rikku and Paine appear also make an appearance as supporting characters. Tidus, Auron and Yuna are also playable characters in &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;.

== Analysis ==
In &quot;Imagined History, Fading Memory: Mastering Narrative in Final Fantasy X&quot;, Washburn writes that &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; &quot;makes the relationship of memory, history, and the struggle for control of knowledge a central element of both its gameplay and its narrative&quot;. Washburn gives a synopsis of the game&#x27;s alternate history and describes Spira&#x27;s development as &quot;evok[ing] a number of culturally vital discourses in Japan that the designers of the game drew on: the modernist aesthetics of evanescence, the loss of faith and belief in a society where technology and religion clash, the desire for a dream realm of memories as the source of an alternative history, and the nostalgic desire for the sublime experience of the annihilation of the past and the completion of history&quot;. Washburn uses &quot;FFX&quot; and the analysis of its narrative to make the case for academic study of the medium and counter the critical views held by detractors like Espen Aarseth, summarizing that &quot;the ability to complete the game requires mastering not only the instrumental controls needed to acquire and perfect game skills but also the narrative itself, the cultural knowledge of Spira that facilitates the acquisition of skills and abilities&quot;. In &quot;Languages Of Navigation Within Computer Games&quot; Flynn asserts that &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s navigation is a representative and symbolic language, writing that &quot;[a]lthough &quot;FFX&quot; establishes itself through the opening cut scene as narrative based, it becomes clear that a poetic and mythic experience of space rather than a cinematic sense of space is in operation&quot;.

The localization process of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;X-2&quot; was analyzed as a case study by Mangiron and O&#x27;Hagan to highlight the liberties of localization. Technical limitations include localizing over a thousand weapons with unique names that must be conveyed in 15 characters yet have no English equivalent as in the case of that became &quot;Painkiller&quot; in English. Other cases include the addition of accents as in the case of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;″s O&#x27;aka, a merchant, who speaks Cockney despite no accent being present in Japanese. Also included were references to Lollapalooza and humorous references to speech, with Rikku&#x27;s verb conjugation of a noun having been modified for English audiences. Other differences like Sano&#x27;s name being changed to Ormi for the English version, with Mangiron and O&#x27;Hagan noting a possible issue with the Spanish meaning of &quot;Sano&quot; as &quot;healthy&quot; in stark contradiction to Ormi&#x27;s obese appearance. Mangiron and O&#x27;Hagan conclude that these changes and contextualisation by addition result in transcreation instead of just translation. Using the games as a case study, Mangiron and O&#x27;Hagan highlight that the freedom to modify, omit or add content results in the traditional concept of fidelity being discarded to maintain the &quot;game experience&quot;.

In the Marie Curie Euroconference on the Challenges of Multidimensional Translation, Minako O&#x27;Hagan expanded on the localization issue including the extreme rewrite of &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;″s theme song &quot;1000 words&quot; and the &quot;International Edition&quot;, saying that in-game dialogues were produced fresh to match the dubbed American version, instead of using the original Japanese script. O&#x27;Hagan noted a point of contention raised by fans were Yuna&#x27;s final words to Tidus in &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; as &quot;Thank you&quot; (Arigato) being translated in English as &quot;I love you&quot;; this translation would extend to the European release and the voice dialogue would be in English. Other academic publications refer to the localization process of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; including Hevian and Marco.

&quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;″s depiction of Spira set a new standard with the traversing of real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map, making the portrayal of Spira a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.

<doc id="1072236" wikidata="Q1816633" url="?curid=1072236" title="Unit operation">
<text>In chemical engineering and related fields, a unit operation is a basic step in a process. Unit operations involve a physical change or chemical transformation such as separation, crystallization, evaporation, filtration, polymerization, isomerization, and other reactions. For example, in milk processing, the following unit operations are involved: homogenization, pasteurization, and packaging. These unit operations are connected to create the overall process. A process may require many unit operations to obtain the desired product from the starting materials, or feedstocks.

==History==
Historically, the different chemical industries were regarded as different industrial processes and with different principles. Arthur Dehon Little developed the concept of &quot;unit operations&quot; to explain industrial chemistry processes in 1916. In 1923, William H. Walker, Warren K. Lewis and William H. McAdams wrote the book &quot;The Principles of Chemical Engineering&quot; and explained that the variety of chemical industries have processes which follow the same physical laws. They summed up these similar processes into unit operations. Each unit operation follows the same physical laws and may be used in all relevant chemical industries. For instance, the same engineering is required to design a mixer for either napalm or porridge, even if the use, market or manufacturers are very different. The unit operations form the fundamental principles of chemical engineering.

==Chemical engineering==
Chemical engineering unit operations consist of five classes:
#Fluid flow processes, including fluids transportation, filtration, and solids fluidization.
#Heat transfer processes, including evaporation and heat exchange.
#Mass transfer processes, including gas absorption, distillation, extraction, adsorption, and drying.
#Thermodynamic processes, including gas liquefaction, and refrigeration.
#Mechanical processes, including solids transportation, crushing and pulverization, and screening and sieving.

Chemical engineering unit operations also fall in the following categories which involve elements from more than one class:
* Combination (mixing)
* Separation (distillation, crystallization)
* Reaction (chemical reaction)

Furthermore, there are some unit operations which combine even these categories, such as reactive distillation and stirred tank reactors. A &quot;pure&quot; unit operation is a physical transport process, while a mixed chemical/physical process requires modeling both the physical transport, such as diffusion, &quot;and&quot; the chemical reaction. This is usually necessary for designing catalytic reactions, and is considered a separate discipline, termed chemical reaction engineering.

Chemical engineering unit operations and chemical engineering unit processing form the main principles of all kinds of chemical industries and are the foundation of designs of chemical plants, factories, and equipment used.

In general, unit operations are designed by writing down the balances for the transported quantity for each elementary component (which may be infinitesimal) in the form of equations, and solving the equations for the design parameters, then selecting an optimal solution out of the several possible and then designing the physical equipment. For instance, distillation in a plate column is analyzed by writing down the mass balances for each plate, wherein the known vapor-liquid equilibrium and efficiency, drip out and drip in comprise the total mass flows, with a sub-flow for each component. Combining a stack of these gives the system of equations for the whole column. There is a range of solutions, because a higher reflux ratio enables fewer plates, and vice versa. The engineer must then find the optimal solution with respect to acceptable volume holdup, column height and cost of construction.

<doc id="1072241" wikidata="Q549578" url="?curid=1072241" title="Us Weekly">
<text>Us Weekly is an American weekly celebrity and entertainment magazine based in New York City. &quot;Us Weekly&quot; was founded in 1977 by The New York Times Company, which sold it in 1980. It was acquired by Wenner Media in 1986, and sold to American Media Inc. in 2017. Shortly afterward, then editor James Heidenry stepped down, and was replaced by Jennifer Peros. The chief content officer of American Media, Dylan Howard, oversees the publication.

&quot;Us Weekly&quot; covers topics ranging from celebrity relationships to the latest trends in fashion, beauty, and entertainment. As of 2017, its paid circulation averaged to more than 1.95 million copies weekly and total readership of more than 50 million consumers.

The magazine currently features a sharply different style from its original 1977–2000 format. Originally a monthly industry news and review magazine along the lines of &quot;Premiere&quot; or &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, it switched format in 2000 to its current themes of celebrity news and style.

The web site Usmagazine.com was launched in fall 2006. In addition to features from the magazine, the site has a breaking celebrity news blog, exclusive photos, red carpet galleries from premieres and events, plus games, videos, quizzes and polls.

== History ==
Us was launched as a fortnightly publication in 1977 by the New York Times Company. The magazine lost money before turning its first profit in 1980. It was sold later that year to Macfadden Media. It was acquired by Jann Wenner in 1985 and is a part of Wenner Media LLC, which also publishes &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot;. In 1991, &quot;Us&quot; became a monthly publication.

In 1999, the company announced plans to shift the &quot;Us&quot; publication schedule from monthly to weekly. The shift coincided with a change in style from industry news and reviews to a celebrity-focused news magazine. The move was a response to several market forces, including the success of Time, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;People&quot; magazines. Wenner expressed his intention to keep &quot;Us&quot; &quot;celebrity-friendly&quot; in contrast with the more gossipy character of its competitors. He told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;We will be nice to celebrities. A lot of my friends are in the entertainment business.&quot; The publication focuses on celebrity fashion as well as Hollywood gossip. Kelli Delaney, current New York designer for Members Only, formerly served as fashion director of the publication (1992–95). The change took effect in March 2000.

In February 2001, Wenner partnered with The Walt Disney Company. Bonnie Fuller worked as editor-in-chief of the publication from 2002 to 2003. She redesigned the title, creating the modern celebrity newsweekly. She created such signature sections as &quot;Stars Are Just Like Us.&quot; In July 2003, Janice Min took over as editor in chief with Victoria Lasdon Rose as publisher, and Michael Steele as executive editor. Steele took over for Min in 2009. Melanie Bromley served as the magazine&#x27;s West Coast bureau chief from 2007 to 2012.

In August 2006, Wenner Media re-acquired Disney&#x27;s 50 percent stake, making the publication once again fully owned and operated by Wenner Media. In 2017, the publication was sold to American Media, Inc.

== In the media ==
In a July 2006 &quot;Variety&quot; article, Janice Min, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; editor-in-chief, cited &quot;People&quot; for the increase in cost to publishers of celebrity photos:
In a June 2007 &quot;New York&quot; article, Tina Brown was asked, &quot;Do you actually read the tabloids?&quot;
From a May 2007 &quot;New York Post&quot; article profiling New York&#x27;s 50 Most Powerful Women,
Of her front cover appearance in November 1997, Courtney Love remarked,
The magazine was criticized for allegedly biased coverage of the 2008 Republican National Convention. The September 5, 2008, issue featured Alaska Governor Sarah Palin on the cover with the headline &quot;Babies, Lies &amp; Scandal&quot;, while the June 19, 2008, issue featured U.S. Senator from Illinois Barack Obama and wife Michelle Obama with the headline &quot;Why Barack Loves Her&quot;. Senior Editor Bradley Jacobs claimed that the &quot;lies&quot; on the cover referred to unspecified &quot;liberal bloggers&quot; who had speculated on the parentage of Governor Palin&#x27;s child, not to the governor herself. However, nothing on the cover indicated &quot;liberal bloggers&quot; were the alleged liars. It was reported that the magazine had lost over 10,000 subscribers. Since then it was reported that &quot;Us Weekly&quot; sent e-mails to each of those subscribers, apologizing for the cover, and promised to send them five free copies of the magazine.

In 2009, &quot;Us Weekly&quot; partnered with Involver to become the first media company to sell sponsorships on their Facebook Page.

<doc id="1072242" wikidata="Q13512302" url="?curid=1072242" title="ICE Advertisements">
<text>iCE Advertisements (or more commonly and accurately simply &quot;iCE&quot;) is a digital art group founded in Canada by Many Axe (later Frozen Tormentor) in 1991. Although the expanded title is rarely ever used, iCE is an acronym for &quot;Insane Creators Enterprise&quot;. iCE, along with ACiD Productions, was one of the most prominent and critically successful groups on the underground computer artscene.

==History==
The group originally specialized in the creation of ANSI artwork for BBSes and MCGA graphics. During the BBS-era, their biggest competitor was ACiD Productions.

The ANSI artscene was in a continual state of flux, with intense rivalry between artists and groups. In addition, ANSI artists tended to switch loyalties often, moving from group to group. Groups would merge and restructure, or completely disband, but iCE was generally viewed by artscene regulars as one of the more stable groups. iCE was known to have particularly effective artistic leadership, and benefited from early artscene leaders such as Tempus Thales.

iCE, like their peers in the artscene, released artwork on a monthly basis in the form of an artpack. iCE released their first monthly artpack, referred to as an &quot;iCEpack&quot;, in August 1992.

During the transition between BBS to the Internet, interest in iCE began to wane somewhat during the late 1990s. This was quickly reversed after the introduction of their well received Tiles collaborative art project in December 2000.

In 2006 iCE branched out into collaborative art, photography and digital art with members worldwide. Although iCE has continued to release monthly galleries of art, they abandoned the traditional artpack format after the release of their July 2002 artpack (dated August 6, 2002) in favor of an online presentation via their website.

<text>Penang Sign Language () was developed in Malaysia by deaf children, outside the classroom, when oralism was predominant. It is now mainly used by older people, although many younger people can understand it.

==History==

Penang Sign Language began when the first school for the deaf, Federation School for the Deaf (FSD), was established by Lady Templer, the wife of the British High Commissioner in Malaya, in 1954. Deaf students went to FSD, to learn oral skills, not sign language. However, the students would sign by themselves in the dormitory of FSD every night. 

In the 1960s, Tan Yap went to Gallaudet University in Washington, D.C. to learn deaf culture and sign language. He brought an ASL book back with him to Malaysia. But Tan Yap&#x27;s suggestions were rejected by the Government. 

An American, Professor Frances Parsons, travelled around the world in 1976 in order to introduce Total Communication and Sign Language to poor schools for the deaf, in order to better prepare them for education. In the same year, Frances Parsons went to Kuala Lumpur to meet with Mahathir Mohamad, the Minister of Education. After a 45-minute discussion, Mahathir agreed with Parsons&#x27;s suggestions and theory. In the next few days, Mahathir announced new legislation that obliged schools in Malaysia to teach Total Communication and Sign Language. As a result, BIM (Bahasa Isyarat Malaysia) or MSL (Malaysian Sign Language) became similar to American Sign Language after 1976.

<doc id="1072256" wikidata="Q106646268" url="?curid=1072256" title="Benveniste affair">
<text>The Benveniste affair () was a major international controversy in 1988, when Jacques Benveniste published a paper in the prestigious scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; describing the action of very high dilutions of anti-IgE antibody on the degranulation of human basophils, findings that seemed to support the concept of homeopathy. As a condition for publication, &quot;Nature&quot; asked for the results to be replicated by independent laboratories. The controversial paper published in &quot;Nature&quot; was eventually co-authored by four laboratories worldwide, in Canada, Italy, Israel, and France.

After the article was published, a follow-up investigation was set up by a team including physicist and &quot;Nature&quot; editor John Maddox, illusionist and well-known skeptic James Randi, as well as fraud expert Walter W. Stewart, who had recently raised suspicion of the work of Nobel laureate David Baltimore. With the cooperation of Benveniste&#x27;s own team, the group failed to replicate the original results, and subsequent investigations did not support Benveniste&#x27;s findings. Benveniste refused to retract his controversial article, and he explained (notably in letters to &quot;Nature&quot;) that the protocol used in these investigations was not identical to his own. However, his reputation was damaged, so he began to fund his research himself, as his external sources of funding were withdrawn. In 1997, he founded the company DigiBio to &quot;develop and commercialise applications of Digital Biology&quot;.

== &quot;Nature&quot; publication and investigation ==
Jacques Benveniste, a French immunologist, published a paper in the prestigious scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; describing the action of very high dilutions of anti-IgE antibody on the degranulation of human basophils. Biologists were puzzled by Benveniste&#x27;s results, as only molecules of water, and no molecules of the original antibody remained in these high dilutions. Benveniste concluded that the configuration of molecules in water was biologically active; a journalist coined the term water memory for this hypothesis. Much later, in the 1990s, Benveniste also asserted that this &quot;memory&quot; could be digitized, transmitted, and reinserted into another sample of water, which would then contain the same active qualities as the first sample.

=== Unusual disclaimer ===
Following replication, the article was then published in &quot;Nature&quot;, which printed an editorial titled &quot;When to believe the unbelievable&quot; in the same issue of the journal and attached the following disclaimer to the article: &quot;Editorial reservation: Readers of this article may share the incredulity of the many referees. ... There is no physical basis for such an activity. ... &quot;Nature&quot; has therefore arranged for independent investigators to observe repetitions of the experiments.&quot; The last time such a disclaimer had been added was in 1974 to an article on Uri Geller.

=== Critical investigation ===
A week after publication of the article, &quot;Nature&quot; sent a team of three investigators to Benveniste&#x27;s lab to attempt to replicate his results under controlled conditions. The team consisted of &quot;Nature&quot; editor and physicist Sir John Maddox, American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter W. Stewart, and skeptic and former magician James Randi.

The team pored over the laboratory&#x27;s records and oversaw seven attempts to replicate Benveniste&#x27;s study. Three of the first four attempts turned out somewhat favorable to Benveniste; however, the &quot;Nature&quot; team was not satisfied with the rigor of the methodology. Benveniste invited them to design a double blind procedure, which they did, and conducted three more attempts. The samples were randomized, and Randi wrapped the codes which identified the samples in tinfoil before fixing it on to the ceiling with adhesive tape. Before fully revealing the results, the team asked if there were any complaints about the procedure, but none were brought up. These stricter attempts turned out negative for Benveniste. In response to Benveniste&#x27;s refusal to withdraw his claims, the team published in the July 1988 edition of &quot;Nature&quot;. Since multiple readings of the samples were closer than statistically expected for the non-double blind tests, the team argued that unintentional bias was the culprit.

In the same issue of the journal &quot;Nature&quot;, and in subsequent commentary, Benveniste denied all the claims and stated that such &quot;Salem witchhunts or McCarthy-like prosecutions will kill science.&quot;

=== &quot;After Dark&quot; ===

On 3 September 1988 Channel 4 broadcast an &quot;After Dark&quot; television discussion featuring Benveniste, James Randi and Walter W. Stewart among others (including Jonathan Miller), reviewed the following week by Sean French in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;.

== Attempts to replicate Benveniste&#x27;s results ==

=== Academy of Sciences ===
In 1991, Benveniste found the French Academy of Sciences willing to publish his latest results, obtained under the supervision of Alfred Spira, a statistician, in its weekly &quot;Proceedings&quot;. Eric Fottorino writing in &quot;Le Monde&quot; relates how the remorseful Academy of Science noticed that an earlier edition contained a study critical of the memory of water. Seizing on this opportunity, the Academy ordered the printing to stop and the already printed copies destroyed, so that it could print a revised edition, in which Benveniste&#x27;s article was labeled a mere &quot;right of reply&quot;—downgraded from the status of an article. The study is a replication of early high dilution experiments, in collaboration with Inserm U292.

Although the new findings fell substantially short of confirming the patterns previously claimed by Benveniste, writer Yves Lignon quotes study co-author and statistician Alfred Spira, who said that &quot;the transmission of information persisted at high dilution&quot;, and acknowledged that a &quot;weakness in the experimental procedure was possible&quot;.

=== Ovelgonne et al. ===

A group of Dutch researchers reported their failure to duplicate the results in &quot;Experientia&quot; in 1992:

=== Hirst et al. ===

A group of English researchers reported another failure to duplicate the results in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1993:

However, Benveniste in a 1994 letter to &quot;Nature&quot; argued that the study neglected to faithfully follow his methods. The study has also been criticized on the grounds that its results were more favourable to Benveniste&#x27;s claims than the study authors acknowledged in their conclusion.

=== Josephson and the APS ===

After the &quot;Nature&quot; controversy, Benveniste gained the public support of Brian Josephson, a Nobel laureate physicist with a reputation for openness to paranormal claims. Experiments continued along the same basic lines, culminating with a 1997 paper claiming the effect could be transmitted over phone lines. This was followed by two additional papers in 1999 and another, in the controversial non-peer reviewed &quot;Medical Hypotheses&quot;, on remote-transmission in 2000 by which time it was claimed that it could also be sent over the Internet.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported in 1999 that, in response to skepticism from physicist Robert Park, Josephson had challenged the American Physical Society (APS) to oversee a replication by Benveniste. This challenge was to be &quot;a randomized double-blind test&quot;, of his claimed ability to transfer the characteristics of homeopathically altered solutions over the Internet:

The APS accepted the challenge and offered to cover the costs of the test. When he heard of this, Randi offered to throw in the long-standing $1 million prize for any positive demonstration of the paranormal, to which Benveniste replied: &quot;Fine to us&quot; in his &quot;DigiBio NewsLetter&quot;. Randi later noted that Benveniste and Josephson did not follow up on their challenge, mocking their silence on the topic as if they were missing persons.

=== Ennis et al. ===

An article published in &quot;Inflammation Research&quot; in 2004 brought new media attention to the issue with this claim:

Following up on a study they had published in 1999 in the same journal, the researchers concluded that an effect did exist. Some of the researchers had not been involved in homeopathic research before, while others had, such as former Benveniste collaborator Philippe Belon, research director at the homeopathic company Boiron. It was Madeleine Ennis who received the most attention in the media. Ennis led the activities at the British lab, with other labs in Europe, running a variation of Benveniste&#x27;s water memory experiments. Ennis states that she began the research as a skeptic, but concluded that the &quot;results compel me to suspend my disbelief and start searching for rational explanations for our findings.&quot;

=== BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; ===

In 2002 BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; broadcast its failed attempt to win James Randi&#x27;s $1 million prize to prove that a highly diluted substance could still have an effect. Prominent spokespersons on both sides of the debate were interviewed, including Benveniste.

A report was published in 2005 on the prestigious journal of statistics &quot;Significance&quot; by the statistician Martin Bland, professor at the University of York.

=== Further study ===

With the support of Brian Josephson, the experiments continued, culminating in a 1997 paper claiming a water memory effect could be transmitted over phone lines. This culminated in two additional papers in 1999 and another on remote-transmission in 2000.

Intrigued by Benveniste&#x27;s claims that biological interactions could be digitized, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) asked Wayne Jonas, homeopath and then director of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, to organize an attempt at independently replicating the claimed results. An independent test of the 2000 remote-transmission experiment was carried out in the US by a team funded by the US Department of Defense. Using the same experimental devices and setup as the Benveniste team, they failed to find any effect when running the experiment. Several positive results were noted, but only when a particular one of Benveniste&#x27;s researchers was running the equipment. Benveniste admitted to having noticed this himself, and offered a variety of reasons to explain what appeared to be another example of experimenter effect. The experiment is also notable for the way it attempted to avoid the confrontational nature of the earlier Maddox test.
The study implemented &quot;A social and communication management process that was capable of dealing with conflicting interpersonal dynamics among vested parties in the research effort.&quot; One of Benveniste&#x27;s machines was used, and, in the design and pilot project phase in 2001, Benveniste and other members of his DigiBio lab participated as consultants. Interviews at the time indicated study participants were satisfied with the way the study was being conducted. In the end, the authors reported in &quot;The FASEB Journal&quot; in 2006 that &quot;Our team found no replicable effects from digital signals&quot;.

== INSERM ==

The July 1989 edition of &quot;Nature&quot; reported that INSERM placed Benveniste on probation following a routine evaluation of his lab. Although INSERM found that his laboratory activities overall were exemplary, it expressed severe discomfort with his high dilution studies, and criticized him for &quot;an insufficiently critical analysis of the results he reported, the cavalier character of the interpretations he made of them, and the abusive use of his scientific authority &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; his informing of the public&quot;.

<text>The Waipori River is a river in Otago in the South Island of New Zealand. Rising in the Lammerlaw Range, it flows southeast for before joining the Taieri River near Henley, southwest of Dunedin of which it is officially the southernmost border.

The upper reaches of the Waipori flow through rough hill country, much of it covered by the Berwick Forest. An artificial lake, Lake Mahinerangi is formed on the river behind a small hydroelectric station at Waipori Falls, which was built in 1880 to provide power for the city of Dunedin. Much of this area is within the Waipori Falls Scenic Reserve.

The lower reaches of the river pass through an area of wetlands around Lakes Waihola and Waipori, both of which drain into the river. This area is a habitat for many species of wading birds. The Sinclair Wetlands reserve is located in this area.

The name Waipori comes from Māori words meaning &quot;dark water&quot;.

<text>Leonard Marion Bahr (May 12, 1905 – July 25, 1990) was an American portrait painter, muralist, illustrator and educator. He worked for many years as a painting professor at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).

==Personal life==
Leonard Marion Bahr was born on May 12, 1905, in Maryland.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSA dob/dod&quot;&gt;Painters: Leonard Marion Bahr. Maryland at a Glance. Maryland State Archives. Retrieved January 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Florence E. Riefle, who had been a student at Maryland Institute (now Maryland Institute College of Art), in 1934 and they had three children, Beth, Leonard, and Mary. Leonard died July 25, 1990.

==Artist==
Bahr created realistic landscape paintings, still lifes and portraits.
===Portraits and paintings with people===
In 1930, Leonard started his professional painting career while still a student, beginning with two portraits of Baltimore&#x27;s Mayor Preston. He made portraits of Bishop Noble C. Powell, various doctors and administrators at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and other prominent individuals. The State of Maryland commissioned him to replicate the historical portrait, by John Wollaston, of Daniel Carroll, which is now located on the first floor of the Maryland State House.

Bahr made a painting of his brother, Maurice, at work underneath a Ford Model T automobile. Within the &quot;rough grained&quot; wood frame was a painting made of gray, black and dark brown oil paint. After the initial exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art, it traveled in a labor and art tour across the United States.

===Biblical themes===
A Christian, Bahr painted Biblical themes, including &quot;Christ in War&quot; (1964) and an altar painting of Christ at Gethsemane for Our Savior&#x27;s Evangelical Lutheran Church in Lansdowne, Maryland. He made an illustrated book of his drawings depicting the 23rd Psalm of David that was published in 1933.

===Murals===

Bahr painted murals for the Public Works of Art Project (1933–34). In 1934 he made the mural of Mary Caroll (Polly) Caton, daughter of lawyer, statesman and Contintental Congress representative Charles Carroll. The mural entitled &quot;Arrival of Mary Carroll Caton at Castle Thunder&quot; was made for the Catonsville High School library. In it, she arrived at the Caton Manor Estate, which was her father&#x27;s gift to her when she married Richard Caton. It is &quot;presumedly&quot; her husband who greeted her as she exited the carriage. The high school was renovated in the 1960s and the mural was lost in the process. The same year, he made &quot;Slaves Rolling Hogsheads of Tobacco Down a Road&quot; for the school&#x27;s library. In it, slaves are rolling casks of tobacco to Elkridge Landing on Rolling Road. Historically slaves rolled the tobacco hogsheads from farms to the Elkridge Landing seaport on the Patapsco River where they would be shipped. A preliminary drawing for the library murals is held at the Smithsonian. He made two more murals for the Baltimore Municipal Aquarium at Druid Hill Park.

===World War II===
His service as Lt. Commander in the Navy during World War II, included illustrating Navy life for various military magazines.

===Other information===
In April 1933, Bahr exhibited at the first annual exhibition of the Maryland Painters, Sculptors and Printmakers at the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Leonard served on art boards and juries and exhibited his work widely, winning many prizes for his artistic eye. Articles about him or his works were published in &quot;American Artist&quot;, &quot;The Appalachian South&quot;, &quot;Gardens Houses and People&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun Magazine&quot;, and the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot;.

Maryland photographer Emily Hayden took a series of photographs of Bahr painting outdoors, which are in the Maryland Historical Society archives. In December 1980 and January 1981, Maryland Institute College of Art held a retrospective of his fifty years as a painter. In the 1980s he was filmed for a video entitled &quot;A Painter&#x27;s Portrait.&quot;

==Educator==
Bahr taught beginning and advanced painting classes at the Maryland Institute College of Art for more than 50 years, beginning when he was an undergraduate. He taught day and night classes on the weekdays and Saturdays for much of his career. In 1980, he retired with honors for service. Two years later, he was still teaching one painting class in the fall and spring semesters. Bahr also gave private lessons.

==Collections==
Leonard&#x27;s history and artworks have been published and are in private and public collections, including the Academy Art Museum in Easton, Maryland; University of Arizona; the Peabody Conservatory of Music; the Baltimore Museum of Art; the Corcoran Gallery of Art; and the Elkridge Heritage Society.

<text>The Bathurst 1000 (known for sponsorship reasons as the [[Repco]] Bathurst 1000) is a touring car race held annually on the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. It is currently run as part of the Supercars Championship, the most recent incarnation of the Australian Touring Car Championship. In 1987 it was a round of the World Touring Car Championship. The Bathurst 1000 is colloquially known as &quot;The Great Race&quot; among motorsport fans and media. The race originated with the 1960 Armstrong 500 with a 500 mile race distance at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit; it was relocated to Bathurst in 1963 also with the 500 mile distance and has continued there every year since, extending to a 1,000 kilometer race in 1973. The race was traditionally run on the New South Wales Labour-Day long weekend in early October. Since 2001, the race has been run on the weekend following the long weekend, generally the second weekend of October.

Race winners are presented with the &quot;Peter Brock Trophy&quot;, introduced at the 2006 race after the sudden death of Peter Brock in an accident. Brock was the most successful driver in the race&#x27;s history, winning the event nine times. He was also known as one of the most popular and fan-friendly drivers during his long career, and was given the moniker &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; for these reasons.

==Mount Panorama==
The Mount Panorama Circuit was first used on 16 April 1938 for the Australian Tourist Trophy meeting for motorcycles, followed two days later by the Australian Grand Prix for cars. The track uses temporarily-closed-public roads and is known for the elevation between its highest and lowest points. The first turn, Hell Corner, is a ninety-degree left-hander. Mountain Straight, a gentle climb where cars reach speeds of , leads into Griffin&#x27;s Bend, an off-camber right-hander that leads into The Cutting, a sharp left-hander with a steep incline. A complex corner called Reid Park comes next, where a number of drivers have spun after not short shifting at the apex. The course continues down to Sulman Park and McPhillamy Park. Drivers are unable to see the descending road and enter Skyline and the first of The Esses at before The Dipper, one of the most famous corners in Australian motorsport. Cars then negotiate Forrest&#x27;s Elbow before powering down Conrod Straight, the fastest section of the track where cars can reach . The Chase is a long sweeping chicane where cars are on the rev limiter turning at 300 km/h before a large braking zone to exit at . Murray&#x27;s is the 23rd and final turn, and also the slowest part of the circuit, before cars return to the start-finish straight. The start-finish straight features an offset start, with the finish line towards the back of the starting grid closer to Murray&#x27;s Corner.

Spectator areas have spread along the track over the decades, but there are several private properties bordering the track; spectators are therefore unable to access every trackside vantage point. Spectator vantage points have also become less intimate to the track over recent years because of debris fencing and increased run-off dimensions installed to meet upgraded international FIA standards.

==Categories and marques==
During its history, the race has been conducted for production saloon cars, Group E Series Production Touring Cars, Group C Touring Cars, Group A Touring Cars, Group 3A Touring Cars, Super Touring, and currently Supercars. Until 1995 more than one class competed in each event. In its early years, the Bathurst 500/1000 was generally a stand-alone event, occasionally becoming a round of a national series such as the Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, but never part of the most significant touring car series in Australia, the Australian Touring Car Championship. Since 1999, the race has been run exclusively as a championship-points round of the Supercars category. In 1999 and 2000, it was the final round of the championship and on both occasions decided the championship winner. The race was once again the final round of the season in 2020, with the re-organised season having been cut short because of the COVID-19 pandemic, though the championship had already been decided on points.

Many marques — including Morris, Jaguar, Nissan, BMW and Volvo — have competed in and won the event in Bathurst. However, the race is best known for the presence of the traditional rivals of Australian motorsport, Ford and Holden, which have won all but six races. Owing to the magnitude of the Ford-versus-Holden rivalry, for the Bathurst 1000 races from 1995 to 2012 the rules of Group 3A and later V8 Supercars mandated that only Ford Falcons and Holden Commodores were allowed to compete. In 2013, V8 Supercars&#x27; rules changed and other marques began to enter the race, including the return of past winners Nissan. Holden has the most overall victories at 34, followed by Ford with 21; Nissan is the only other multiple winner with 2 wins.

==Race history==

===Phillip Island===

Originally known as the Armstrong 500, the race was first held on 20 November 1960 at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit in Phillip Island, Victoria, over a distance. The organisers, the Light Car Club of Australia, claimed the race was &#x27;the world&#x27;s premier production saloon car race&#x27;. The intention was to determine which cars, across five classes based on engine capacity, had the best combination of performance and reliability. It was also a showcase for the Armstrong company&#x27;s shock absorbers and related products. Entry was limited to standard, unmodified production saloons built or assembled in Australia. All cars had to complete the first 100 miles without stopping for fuel, oil, or a driver change. Any mechanical problems in that time had to be resolved unassisted by the driver, using only the tools that came with the car. There was no official outright winner, only class winners. Frank Coad and John Roxburgh, in a Vauxhall Cresta, were the first to complete the 500-mile race distance. It was the only Vauxhall in the field of 45 cars including N.S.U.s, Simcas, Peugeots, Morris, Austins, Fords and Standard Vanguards.

The race was held twice more at Phillip Island. In 1961 Bob Jane and Harry Firth, sharing an Australian assembled Mercedes-Benz 220 SE, were the first drivers to complete the 167 laps. They were over a lap ahead of the Studebaker Lark driven by David McKay and Brian Foley, which in turn was a lap clear of the Vauxhall Velox of Frank Coad and John Roxburgh. Class wins were achieved by Studebaker, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot and Renault. In 1962 the class structure changed to one based on price. Jane and Firth switched to a Ford Falcon and once again completed the 500 miles first. Class honours went to Studebaker, Ford, Renault and Volkswagen.

In those days the Phillip Island track was surfaced with a &quot;cold mix&quot; bitumen which could not stand up to the pounding of dozens of race cars going flat out for 500 miles. The track surface broke up and became unsafe during races.

===Early years in Bathurst===
In 1963 the Armstrong 500 moved to the Mount Panorama Circuit at Bathurst in New South Wales. The Bathurst 500 was organised and promoted by a consortium of the Seven Network, the Australian Racing Drivers Club (ARDC), and Bathurst Regional Council; this arrangement continued until 1998. Its popularity grew rapidly, chiefly because it became a means for car manufacturers to showcase their products: the race cars had to be identical to those on the showroom floor. The first years on the Mount Panorama circuit were dominated by swift and agile small cars, such as the Ford Cortina and Mini Cooper. Although the class structure was retained — with many &quot;races within the race&quot; — the emphasis on achieving first outright increased. In 1963, Bob Jane and Harry Firth again triumphed, this time in a Cortina GT. In 1964 the pair drove competing Cortina GTs; Jane won with George Reynolds as co-driver. Barry &#x27;Bo&#x27; Seton was second with Herb Taylor. Harry Firth was third with John Reaburn.

The Confederation of Australian Motor Sport introduced new Group E Series Production Touring Car regulations in 1965 but the Armstrong 500 continued with its own regulations.

1965 brought victory for the first overt &quot;Bathurst Special&quot;, the Cortina GT 500. Bo Seton and Midge Bosworth completed the 130 laps first. Bruce McPhee and Barry Mulholland were second in an identical car. Third outright and first in Class C were Brian Foley and Peter Manton in a Morris Cooper S. The Geoghegan brothers, Ian and Leo, famously drove the race wearing business suits supplied by McDowells.

In 1966 and 1967 an Irish tobacco company sponsored the race, which became known as the &quot;Gallaher 500&quot;. 1966 was the last four-cylinder victory for more than two decades. Rauno Aaltonen and Bob Holden drove their Mini Cooper S to a hard-fought win against stiff competition mainly comprising other Coopers. Mini Coopers filled the first nine places in Class C and outright. Class D was won by a Chrysler VC Valiant V8 that completed 124 laps. Class A was won by the Nissan Factory backed Datsun 1300 of Moto Kitamo and Kunimitsu Takahashi. Class B was taken out by an 1100cc version of the Mini Cooper.

1967 rule changes mandated a minimum number of pit-stops to negate the advantage economical smaller cars had of requiring fewer stops. This change favoured the larger, thirstier Fords and Holdens. The Minis handled the corners well and could, theoretically, run the entire race on a single tank of petrol, but the larger-engined cars were faster in a straight line. Ford&#x27;s development of the 289 cubic inch V8 Ford Falcon GT signalled the end of small cars as outright contenders. 1967 was also the first year that starting grid positions were allocated according to practice lap times rather than by class groupings. This was also the first year that an official trophy was awarded to the first team to cover the 500 miles.

The 1967 victory of the XR Falcon GT over the smaller Alfa Romeo 1600 GTVs and Mini Coopers surprised many pundits as the Falcon GT was unproven. The highly regarded, and more expensive, Alfa GTV had been seen as the emerging force in touring cars. However, the Falcon GT&#x27;s V8 power was well suited to the Mount Panorama circuit, particularly on the long straights. Thus was forged the adage that &quot;there is no substitute for cubic inches&quot;, which became synonymous with racing at Bathurst. Initially the Geoghegan brothers&#x27; Falcon was awarded victory but some hours later Harry Firth and Fred Gibson were declared winners. During the race the Geoghegan car had entered the pit area through the rear access lane off Mountain Straight and erroneously accumulated an extra lap on the ARDC timing board. Third place in Class D fell to the venerable Studebaker Lark of Warren Weldon and John Hall. Class E was won by Doug Chivas and Max Stewart in an Alfa GTV. Classes B and C were won by variants of the Mini, and Class A was won by a Datsun 1000 piloted by John Roxburgh and Doug Whiteford.

The popularity of the race grew rapidly during the 1960s. Most Australian manufacturers and assemblers became heavily involved. A good result in the long and tough race added credibility to the car and its brand, especially in terms of performance, durability and reliability. An outright or class victory was a significant opportunity to increase sales and market share. It was during this period that the famous Holden–Ford–Chrysler rivalry originated. The production-car battle between the &quot;Big Three&quot; was fought at Bathurst. This rivalry spawned Australia&#x27;s most famous muscle cars, reverentially known as &quot;Bathurst Specials&quot;. Ford&#x27;s Falcon GT and later GT-HO, Holden&#x27;s Monaro and Torana, and Chrysler&#x27;s Pacer and Charger models were the result of constant development of race-worthy cars that the general public could buy.

In 1968, sponsorship changed again and the race became known as the Hardie-Ferodo 500. It was also the year that advertising was first allowed to be displayed on the cars. In response to Ford&#x27;s 1967 Bathurst victory, Holden entered the Monaro GTS 327. This was a coupe based on the HK model four-door Kingswood family sedan. Engineered as an affordable personal luxury car with the ability to win Bathurst, it had a 327 cubic inch Chevrolet V8 (as the &quot;GTS 327&quot; name implies). This engine enabled the Monaro GTS 327 to outperform the updated, yet smaller-engined, 302 cubic inch Falcon GTs and win in 1968. This was Holden&#x27;s first Bathurst 500 win.

The 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 saw the first of the Ford Falcon GT-HOs. This Phase One GT-HO Bathurst special Falcon was powered by a 351 cubic inch V8 sourced from Ford America. Its &#x27;HO&#x27; specification included upgraded suspension components such as front and rear stabiliser bars. At Bathurst it was fitted with race tyres. Holden upgraded the GTS 327 Monaro to the GTS 350, which included better race-style handling and a more powerful Chevrolet V8 engine of 350 cubic inches. The new GTS 350 Monaro, in the hands of Colin Bond and Tony Roberts, was able to hold out Ford to claim the second victory for Holden. In 1969 there was a multi-car accident on lap one. After the first 10 cars passed through The Esses, contact between two Falcons caused one to roll over. Several cars coming around the blind corner crashed into the stationary car. The track was almost blocked with wreckage but expert flag marshalling enabled the cars to pass through in single file until the debris was cleared. The race was a disaster for Ford as many Falcon tyres failed because of the speed and weight of the Falcons. Ford even a ran a post-race advertising campaign using the slogan &quot;we were a little deflated&quot;.

The 1969 race also saw the début of Peter Brock. Brock and Bond were drivers for the semi-official Holden Dealer Team (HDT), which had been formed earlier in the year to counter the official Ford Special Vehicles division that was churning out ever-evolving GT-HO Falcons. The &quot;Old Fox&quot;, Harry Firth, who had been in charge of the Ford racing effort until he was abruptly replaced by an American, Al Turner, took charge of the HDT.

1970 saw a change of strategy as Holden chose to race the smaller Torana GTR XU-1 rather than the Monaro. The XU-1 was a special &quot;Bathurst&quot; version of the six-cylinder LC Torana. As the embryonic HQ Holden required too much development to be competitive, Holden created an alternative to the V8 muscle car. The XU-1 was more agile, cheaper and more economical. Triple carburettors on the &quot;Red&quot; motor provided an excellent power-to-weight ratio. The XU-1 was easier on brakes and tyres, thereby minimizing the number of required pit stops. However, Ford refined the GT-HO to Phase Two specification with an even more powerful and better-breathing 351 V8. With tyres that were able to endure the power and torque, the GT-HO reinforced the adage that &quot;there is no substitute for cubic inches&quot;. Allan Moffat&#x27;s GT-HO received the chequered flag followed by Bruce McPhee&#x27;s identical car. The Torana could not compensate for the power advantage that the Falcons had on the Bathurst straights.

Rule changes for 1970 enabled a single driver to complete the entire race distance. To reduce the chances of another first lap calamity the starting grid was changed from 2-3-2 to a staggered 2-2-2 formation. This meant that the back markers had to start the race from around the corner on Conrod Straight. The race continued to be run to unique regulations which were more restrictive than those which were applied to Series Production racing.

1971 was another Ford victory with Moffat at the wheel. It was won by the ultimate GT-HO, the XY-model Falcon GT-HO Phase Three. This featured upgrades to engine power and aerodynamics, which made it one of the world&#x27;s fastest four-door mass-produced production cars. Chrysler replaced its Pacers with its new two-door, the Charger. This was powered by a in-line HEMI six-cylinder engine with triple Weber carburettors. However, by noon on race day, Moffat was far enough in front to pit without losing the lead. Moffat completed the 500 miles first, followed by other GT-HOs in second and third places and filling six of the top seven places. Class wins were achieved by Mazda 1300, Datsun 1600, Mazda RX-2, Torana XU1 and Falcon GT-HO.

1972 saw controversy, following a media-driven &quot;Supercar Scare&quot;, which had accumulated enough political momentum to force Holden to postpone introduction of a V8 Torana for two years. Ford abandoned the XA-based Phase Four GT-HO Falcon. Chrysler also followed by not going ahead with a competition version of its V8-powered Charger. Adding to that, the 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500 was the first Bathurst 500 to be run in wet weather. Allan Moffat was unable to withstand the immense pressure placed on him by Brock in his XU-1. The Torana proved more than a match in the atrocious conditions. After being challenged by Brock&#x27;s furiously driven XU-1, Moffat was unable to exploit the V8&#x27;s power advantage and spun early in the race. He also incurred two one-minute penalties for starting the engine while refuelling. Brock, meanwhile, was able to hold off the Phase Three GT-HO of John French and the E49 Charger of Doug Chivas to win the 1972 race, thus temporarily refuting the &quot;no substitute for cubic inches&quot; adage. Brock had pushed the car to its limits in a spectacular display of car control. It was a significant victory for a number of reasons, the first of Brock&#x27;s nine Bathurst wins which later led to him being nicknamed the &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Peter Perfect&quot;. Brock&#x27;s win also signalled the first Bathurst victory for a six-cylinder engined car, an achievement that would not be repeated until 1991 when the Nissan Skyline GT-R &quot;Godzilla&quot; took the chequered flag. It was also the birth of the Torana legend as this uniquely Australian performance car went on to become one of Australia&#x27;s most successful touring cars, due in part to numerical supremacy on the track and the withdrawal of Ford and Chrysler from motor racing later in the seventies.

1972 was also the last year that drivers were permitted to drive without co-drivers.

The 1972 race was a round of the 1972 Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship, which was open to Group E Series Production Touring Cars.

===Group C Era===
The race was extended from 500 miles to 1000 kilometres in 1973. The increased pace of the cars had resulted in the 500-mile race distance being achieved earlier each year, and since Australia had converted to the metric system the increased distance was considered more appropriate than 800 km for an endurance race. To reduce the threat to public safety, homologation rules were relaxed to permit certain modifications to the race cars. Ostensibly this removed the need to build batches of high speed road cars and improved the durability of the actual race cars. The Group E Series Production Touring Car regulations, which had applied to the 1972 race, were replaced by the new Group C Touring Car regulations for 1973. Upgrades were allowed to seats, lubrication systems, camshafts, carburettors, suspension, brakes and wheel rim sizes. These changes advantaged the better-resourced teams, as a great deal of testing was now needed to optimize the performance of the race cars. Factory teams had the best access to improved components that were often not readily available to private competitors.

In 1973 Holden campaigned upgraded XU-1s. Privateers entered improved Chargers. Ford unleashed its new XA model &quot;hard top&quot; coupe Ford Falcon GT which had been pioneered by John Goss. While not designated as a GT-HO, race-prepared Hardtop GTs incorporated most of the stillborn Phase Four&#x27;s components, including the four-bolt 351 V8 engine. The 1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 started at 9:30 am. When the flag dropped the &quot;no substitute for cubic inches&quot; ethic prevailed as the Goss Falcon hardtop powered away from pole position. At the end of lap one Fords held the first four places with Toranas fifth, six and seventh. The highest placed Charger was in eighth position. Brock inherited the lead when the Fords started pitting for fuel. Brock and co-driver Chivas had contrived a good lead when a miscalculation caused the Torana to run out of fuel at the top of the Mountain. Intending to perform one less pit stop than the Ford teams, HDT team manager Harry Firth had instructed Chivas to &quot;Get Max Laps&quot; via a hand-held sign. The XU-1 coasted down Conrod Straight and came to a halt just before the entrance to the Pits. Chivas pushed the XU-1 up hill along pit lane. His pit crew could not lend assistance as this would have resulted in disqualification. By the time the XU-1 was refueled, Moffat was well in front. Brock set off in heroic pursuit of Moffat&#x27;s Falcon GT but the XU-1 suffered a deflating tyre. Moffat claimed another Falcon victory, his third in only four years. Co-driven by Ian (Pete) Geoghegan, the winning Ford was the only Falcon classified as a finisher. 1973 was the last competitive appearance for Chrysler, with the marque disappearing from the Group C category almost entirely. Class wins were achieved by a Datsun 1200, an Alfa GTV, a Mazda RX2 and, of course, the Falcon GT. At the end of the year Ford Australia gave the Falcon GT race cars to their drivers and withdrew from racing.

During the 1974 Australian Touring Car Championship the Torana GTR XU-1 was gradually superseded by the wider bodied SL/R 5000. The Holden Bathurst contingent for this year included 13 SL/R 5000s, 7 XU-1s and one HQ Monaro GTS. Ford was represented in the outright category by three Falcon Hardtop headed by Moffat&#x27;s Brut 33 XB Falcon Hardtop GT. He was supported by John Goss and Kevin Bartlett in an XA Hardtop and Murray Carter in another XB Falcon Hardtop. The V8 Toranas ran away at the start of the 1974 race and Holden victory seemed assured. By lap 11 Brock had already lapped 7 of the outright Class D cars. On lap 12 Moffat pitted and lost several laps as a new coil was fitted. By lap 20 the HDT Toranas of Brock and Bond were over a minute in front of Goss in the only competitive Falcon. By lap 85 the two HDT Toranas were four laps clear of the field. Around the 90 lap mark rain started to fall at the top of the mountain. The HDT Toranas soon pitted for wet weather tyres after which the Bond Torana started smoking from an oil leak. The car was eventually black flagged. While the mechanics were trying to fix the problem Brock pitted with a broken piston caused by a failed oil pump. Bond returned to the track but lost more time with a spin. Despite determined driving from Jim Richards and Wayne Negus, the Goss/Bartlett car was able to gain a slight lead as the Torana challenge faded amidst oil smoke and torrential rain. Bartlett completed the 163 laps in first place. The only other car on the same lap was the Forbes/Negus SL/R 5000. The smaller classes were won by a Morris Cooper S, an Alfa GTV and a Mazda RX3. Car number 34, a lone Morris Marina, finished 6th in Class C having completed 125 laps.

Holden&#x27;s 308 cubic inch V8-powered Toranas scored Bathurst victories in 1975, 1976, 1978 and 1979 in L34 and A9X configuration. Ford&#x27;s 351 XC Falcon famously finished first and second in 1977. On the final lap, the two Moffat Ford Dealers entries of Allan Moffat and Colin Bond ran in formation down Conrod Straight, with the helicopter footage of the formation becoming one of the most famous images in Bathurst 1000 history. This was Moffat&#x27;s last Bathurst 1000 victory. Group C carried over into the 1980s. Holden and Ford were the only manufacturers to win under these regulations, despite facing increased imported competition, notably from the Mazda RX-7 that was campaigned effectively by Moffat and Kevin Bartlett&#x27;s 350 V8-powered Chevrolet Camaro. The turbo-powered Nissan Bluebird piloted by George Fury also threatened the V8 &#x27;Big Bangers&#x27; and signalled a sign of things to come during the Group A era. Peter Brock cemented his reputation as the driver to beat during this period, including achieving two Bathurst hat-tricks with the Marlboro-sponsored HDT. In 1978 and 1979 he and Jim Richards drove an A9X Torana to victory, while in 1980 the pair won in a VC Commodore. His second hat trick consisted of victories in 1982, 1983 and 1984, this time partnering with Larry Perkins in a VH Commodore for the first two years and in a VK Commodore in the third. In 1983, John Harvey also shared the win with Brock and Perkins. Dick Johnson was the only winner for Ford during the 1980s under Group C, with a victory in 1981 whilst at the wheel of the XD Falcon. It was a famous win, coming twelve months after writing his car off in an incident with a rock in 1980. It also followed a large public fundraising campaign to provide him with the finances to build a new car, which eventually raised AU$144,000, half of which came from Ford Australia itself. Group C was replaced by the International Group A Touring car rules in 1985, with selected cars preparing for this change and competing in a separate &quot;Group A&quot; class in 1984.
===Group A Era===
From 1985 to 1992, the Bathurst 1000 was run to international Group A regulations. Imported turbocharged cars, initially Ford Sierra RS Cosworths and then Nissan Skyline GT-Rs, achieved dominance during this period while Holden Commodores managed to claim three hard-fought wins. The JPS Team BMW run 635 CSis and M3s were also highly competitive during this era. Group A enabled Australian teams to develop cars that could be raced overseas. Locally built cars were driven in Europe by Allan Grice, Peter Brock, John Harvey, Allan Moffat, Dick Johnson and John Bowe. Tom Walkinshaw also briefly campaigned VL Commodores in Europe.

Holden-based race teams continued development of the 308 cubic inch V8-powered Commodore. The HDT and the later Holden Racing Team (HRT) were at the forefront of Commodore development. With almost no support from Ford Australia, Group A Ford Falcons never eventuated. Dick Johnson Racing switched to a 1983 Zakspeed-developed Ford Mustang GT formerly raced in Europe by German ace Klaus Ludwig. Johnson and co-driver Larry Perkins were very competitive in the agile Mustang but it lacked top-end power. Ford teams went on to adopt the more powerful, though less reliable, Ford Sierra Turbo Cosworth. These were available race-ready from Europe and were campaigned by many teams including Allan Moffat Racing, Dick Johnson Racing and eventually a team run by Holden stalwart Peter Brock.

1985 was the first year that the Bathurst 1000 was run under Group A rules. The race was dominated by Tom Walkinshaw Racing&#x27;s three-car Jaguar XJ-S team, the big V12-powered Jaguars having a clear power and speed advantage over the still-developing Australian Group A teams and cars. 1974 winner John Goss and West German driver Armin Hahne claimed Jaguar&#x27;s only Bathurst 1000 win. The following year, 1986, the Holden VK Commodore SS Group A of privateer racer Allan Grice and Graeme Bailey took the honours. Grice had honed his skills in Europe, competing alongside compatriot Commodore driver Peter Brock and his newly recruited HDT teammate, Allan Moffat.

1986 saw the race&#x27;s first fatality. Sydney driver Mike Burgmann died when his VK Commodore hit the concrete base of the bridge over Conrod Straight at . Consequent to Burgmann&#x27;s death the circuit was altered prior to the 1987 race by the incorporation of &quot;The Chase&quot; two-thirds of the way down Conrod Straight. This complex added 41 metres to the length of the track and was designed to reduce the approach speed to Murray&#x27;s Corner by approximately . As a result of &quot;The Chase&quot;, lap times around the circuit increased by approximately 4–5 seconds (based on times in comparable cars from the 1986 and 1987 races).

In 1987, the Bathurst 1000 became a round of the shortlived World Touring Car Championship, resulting in European teams racing against local Australian teams in the 1000. The resulting culture clash caused considerable angst between officials and team management. Since the start of Group A in Australia, CAMS local scrutineers diligently applied the Group A regulations as written. The global organising body FISA, a subsidiary of the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), allowed more liberal, negotiated interpretations &quot;back home&quot;. Some European teams, most prominently the Ford Europe–backed Eggenberger Motorsport, ran questionable vehicles. With the race complete, it was still unclear as to who was the legitimate winner. Eggenberger&#x27;s cars finished first and second on the road but were disqualified months later due to bodywork irregularities. The race win was therefore awarded to third-placed Peter Brock, who drove two of his Holden VL Commodore SS Group A cars during the race. Brock broke his &#x27;05&#x27; HDT Commodore early in the event so he and co-driver David Parsons took over the team&#x27;s second car, the #10 Commodore of Peter McLeod, to cross the line third behind the two Sierras. It was to be Brock&#x27;s ninth and final Bathurst 1000 win.

Local Sierra teams dominated and won the next two Bathurst 1000s. 1988 saw Tony Longhurst and Tomas Mezera win in their Frank Gardner–prepared RS500. In the 1989 race, Peter Brock claimed his record-setting 6th pole at Bathurst, his first in anything but a Holden. Dick Johnson and John Bowe won a hard-fought race ahead of Allan Moffat Racing&#x27;s all-German combination of Klaus Niedzwiedz and Frank Biela.

In 1990 the Sierras again proved strong, but the HRT Commodore of Allan Grice and Win Percy prevailed. Their Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV was able to set a fast pace early in the race which the Sierras could match but not sustain due to reliability issues, mostly with tyre wear. The HRT claimed a popular Bathurst victory for Holden after three seasons of Sierra domination.

A fierce new opponent was waiting in the wings. Nissan and team manager Fred Gibson had campaigned Skylines in Australian competition for a few years. For the 1990 race, they debuted the R32 four-wheel drive, four wheel steer, twin turbo Nissan Skyline GT-R. Though initially sufferring from problems related to complexity and reliability, the GT-R went on to dominate Group A racing worldwide. Gibson&#x27;s lead drivers, Jim Richards and Mark Skaife, easily won the 1991 Bathurst 1000; Skaife had set a sensational time of 2:12.63 in the Top 10 Runoff for pole, 2/10th faster than George Fury&#x27;s Group C 1984 pole time on the shorter pre-Chase circuit. Richards and Skaife repeated the win in controversial circumstances in 1992. The car gained the nickname &#x27;Godzilla&#x27;. With four-wheel drive, four-wheel steer, and a powerful turbo 2.6-litre six-cylinder engine producing around , the Skyline&#x27;s superior handling and power output was unmatched by the rear-wheel-drive Sierras and Commodores. In an attempt to achieve parity between the makes, weight penalties (140 kg) and turbo-restricting pop-off valves were applied to the Nissan. With the pop-off valves in place, the Nissans were reported to now be only producing around , though team boss Fred Gibson would (in later years) confess that the Winfield-sponsored cars were actually producing around after his team had managed to fool CAMS officials during the year.

The Skyline&#x27;s 1992 victory was particularly controversial. The parochial Bathurst crowd, and touring-car fans in general, had been conditioned to view the Bathurst 1000 as a perpetual struggle between Holden and Ford. Although the Group A racing Commodores and Sierras were far removed from road-going examples, the Nissans were seen as being unfairly advantaged and received considerable negative comment in the build-up to the race. Late in the 1992 race, severe rainstorms swept the track, causing several accidents as dry-weather tyres caused extreme aquaplaning. During the ensuing mayhem the leading Skyline of Jim Richards and Mark Skaife slid into two wrecked cars. Simultaneously officials red-flagged the race due to the perilous condition of the wet track. The surviving cars were marshalled in single file on Pit Straight. Regulations decreed that, as the leaders had completed more than 75% of race distance, the race was not to be restarted.

Under these regulations, red-flag race results were based on positions held at the end of the last completed lap as there was no official record of the lap not completed. As Richards had been leading the race on that lap, his team was declared the winner. This was an unpopular decision with some race fans, many of whom could not understand how a wrecked Nissan could beat a perfectly healthy Sierra that had passed it on the track. As the rain clouds dissipated many unhappy campers loudly voiced their opinions. Race winners Mark Skaife and Jim Richards were challenged by a rowdy, confused and alcohol-fuelled crowd. On the winners&#x27; podium the normally affable Richards responded to the boos of the crowd with, &quot;this is bloody disgraceful&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;re a pack of arseholes&quot; during the nationally televised trophy presentation.

===Group 3A and Super Touring===
Group A as an international formula faded away in the late 1980s. The Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) had planned to replace Group A at the end of 1991. This was postponed to the end of 1992 owing to the inability of FISA to specify a new International formula. As any new regulations were unlikely to suit large-engined cars, CAMS created a uniquely Australian touring car formula for 1993, Group 3A. This iteration evolved into the current Supercars category. Entry became limited to V8-powered Ford Falcons and Holden Commodores (with, in 1993 only, the exception of weight-limited normally aspirated Group A cars like the BMW M3s of LoGaMo Racing).

The new regulations created a separate class for 2-litre cars, based on the British Touring Car Championship&#x27;s (BTCC) regulations of the time. This class excluded turbochargers and four wheel drive, effectively ending the Nissan&#x27;s GT-R&#x27;s eligibility. In response Nissan withdrew from Australian motorsport. The two classes of touring cars competed in the same races for two championships in 1993. The 1993 Tooheys 1000 was won by Larry Perkins and Gregg Hansford after a race-long duel with the Mark Skaife/Jim Richards Commodore VP. The winner of the 2-litre class was the John Cotter/Peter Doulman BMW M3 which had reverted to 2 litres capacity.

In the 1994 season, the 2-litre Super Touring championship was run separately from the ATCC, though both categories ran as two classes at Bathurst. The 1994 Tooheys 1000 was won by the EB Falcon of Dick Johnson and John Bowe. The top-placed 2-litre car was the works BMW of Paul Morris and Altfrid Heger which finished 10th outright, six laps behind Johnson and Bowe. In 1995, owing to fears about the growing speed difference between the V8s and the 2-litre cars, the Bathurst 1000 became a one-class race for the first time. Just 32 Ford and Holden V8s faced the starter in what was, at the time, the smallest grid in the history of the race. The 1995 champions were Larry Perkins and Russell Ingall in a Holden VR Commodore, followed by Alan Jones and Allan Grice in an EF Falcon. 1996 saw Craig Lowndes and Greg Murphy, in a VR Commodore, cross the finish line ahead of the EF Falcon of Dick Johnson and John Bowe. Tony Longhurst and Steven Ellery were third in another EF Falcon.

===A race divided===
In 1996, the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA) (who had held the rights to market the ATCC since 1994) signed a deal with US sports agent Mark McCormack&#x27;s International Management Group (IMG) to market the ATCC, which they renamed to V8 Supercars. The new joint venture company (AVESCO) signed a TV deal for 1997 with Network Ten, which included expanded coverage of the championship. This was not an issue for the ATCC races, but for the Bathurst 1000, which was organized and promoted by a consortium that included Channel 7, it was a major issue. Channel 7 had televised the race since 1963 and had a contract that was binding into the 21st century. Seven was not prepared to drop the race, while AVESCO required a Bathurst race for Ten to broadcast. A similar dispute affected the V8 Supercars Challenge support races at the Australian Grand Prix; at various times different networks held the V8 Supercars and Formula One broadcast rights.

There was no resolution to the dispute, and AVESCO announced that V8 Supercars would not compete in the traditional Bathurst 1000 held on the October long weekend in 1997. TOCA Australia was invited to fill the void with a 2-litre Super Touring field, featuring a number of British Touring Car Championship drivers and teams, including Alain Menu, John Cleland and Rickard Rydell, joining Australian Super Touring Championship regulars. This 1997 race was won by Paul Morris and Craig Baird in a BMW 320i, but they were later disqualified as Baird had exceeded the mandated time limit for a continuous solo driving period. The race was awarded to their BMW Motorsport Australia teammates David and Geoff Brabham. This event format continued for 1998 with the addition of a field of cars from the New Zealand Touring Car Championship, which ran to Schedule S regulations with a 2.5-litre engine limit, as well as Group E production cars. Alongside Rickard Rydell, Jim Richards won his sixth Bathurst 1000 in a Volvo S40 run by Tom Walkinshaw Racing, with his son Steven second in a Nissan Primera run by British team Team Dynamics.

As well as these races for two-litre cars, separate five-litre (V8 Supercars) races were held in 1997 and 1998, known as the &quot;Australian 1000 Classic&quot;. Having received backlash after announcing they would not race at Bathurst, AVESCO hastily made a deal with the Bathurst Regional Council for the use of the circuit. The 1997 Primus 1000 Classic, as it was known, was held two weeks after the traditional race, while the 1998 FAI 1000 was held in mid-November. The 1997 race saw Larry Perkins and Russell Ingall repeat their 1995 triumph, ahead of the father and son combination of Jim and Steven Richards. In 1998, Steven Richards did one better, winning the race with Jason Bright for Stone Brothers Racing. Their Ford EL Falcon was badly damaged in a practice crash and required lengthy repairs before the race.

Both the Super Touring and V8 Supercar races claimed to be the legitimate Bathurst 1000. The V8 Supercars&#x27; case was that they were the truly Australian class of racing and, through contractual binding, had the &quot;star&quot; Australian drivers. The Super Touring claim to legitimacy was based on it being held on the traditional date by the ARDC who had run the event every year since 1963. Each of the four races in 1997 and 1998 are considered as legitimate Bathurst 1000s in the record books.

=== V8 Supercars era ===
For 1999, the Super Touring event devolved into a 300-kilometre race for mixed V8s, which was won by Peter Brock&#x27;s step-son James Brock, and a 500-kilometre race for Super Touring won by Paul Morris. This would be the last major Super Touring race at Bathurst, the last organised by the ARDC and the last held on the traditional Labour Day holiday weekend. The demise of Super Touring and the ARDC event allowed V8 Supercars and IMG to take over the promotion and organisation of the Bathurst 1000 brand from that year onwards. From 1999 onwards, the race also counted for championship points for the first time, taking a position as the final round on the calendar.

In 2000, the 1000-kilometre race remained in November because the Sydney Olympics blocked out sport in October. When the long weekend again became available in 2001, the National Rugby League shifted its Grand Final to that Sunday, denying the Bathurst 1000 a return to its traditional weekend. The race moved to the weekend following the long weekend from 2001 onwards, and to an earlier spot in the championship calendar. The start of this new era was dominated by Holden, which won every Bathurst 1000 from 1999 to 2005. In 1999, Steven Richards repeated his 1998 triumph, winning with Greg Murphy in their Gibson Motorsport Holden VT Commodore. Richards became the first driver to win consecutively in a Ford and a Holden. This was also the first win for Gibson Motorsport since their wins with Nissan in 1991 and 1992. Garth Tander and Jason Bargwanna became Bathurst champions in 2000 with Garry Rogers Motorsport.

In 2001, Mark Skaife, driving for the Holden Racing Team, teamed with 1988 winner Tony Longhurst to win the Bathurst 1000 in a Holden VX Commodore. Despite late cooling problems from plastic bags in the air intake, Skaife and HRT again won the Bathurst 1000 in 2002, this time teamed with Jim Richards. Ten years after being heckled off the podium after winning in 1992, this time Richards jokingly said that the crowd was &quot;a lovely bunch of people&quot;. Greg Murphy received the biggest time penalty (five minutes) in Bathurst history because of a pit-lane infringement; his car was released prematurely, rupturing a refuelling hose and spilling fuel in the pit box.

In the Top 10 Shootout in 2003, Greg Murphy drove what became known as the &quot;Lap of the Gods&quot; for a record-setting Mount Panorama Circuit time of 2:06.8594. Murphy went on to win the Bathurst 1000 with Rick Kelly in 2003 and 2004 for K-Mart Racing. Rick Kelly became the race&#x27;s youngest winner in 2003 at the age of 20. Rick&#x27;s brother Todd Kelly won the 2005 race on his birthday with Mark Skaife for HRT.

In 2006, Craig Lowndes and Jamie Whincup won the first race for Ford in eight years, driving for Triple Eight Race Engineering. They were also the first winners of the &quot;Peter Brock Trophy&quot; (following the passing of Peter Brock the previous month). Lowndes and Whincup then won the next two races to achieve the first three-peat since Brock and Larry Perkins won the Bathurst 1000 from 1982 to 1984 (the 1983 win was also shared with John Harvey). Holden achieved four straight wins from 2009 to 2012. The 2009 race was won by the HRT&#x27;s Garth Tander and Will Davison. 2009 was the first Bathurst 1000 using the E85 fuel blend; increased fuel consumption resulted in more pit stops. 2010 saw another win for Lowndes and Triple Eight, this time with Mark Skaife, their fifth and sixth wins respectively. In 2011, Nick Percat partnered with Garth Tander to become the first rookie to win the Bathurst 1000 since Jacky Ickx in 1977, with Tander barely holding off Lowndes in a close finish.

Ahead of new regulations for 2013, the Triple Eight Holden VE Commodore of Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell won in 2012 just 0.31 seconds ahead of David Reynolds and Dean Canto. The closest non-formation finish was set just the year before when Tander and Percat lifted the trophy 0.29 seconds ahead of Lowndes and Skaife.

The 2013 season saw manufacturers other than Ford and Holden enter the Bathurst 1000 for the first time since 1998, under the New Generation V8 Supercar (originally known as Car of the Future) regulations that were introduced that year. Nissan returned with four Nissan Altimas run by Kelly Racing. Mercedes-Benz returned through Australian GT Championship team Erebus Motorsport with its three Mercedes-Benz E63 AMGs. From 2013, the event became part of the newly formed Pirtek Enduro Cup within the Supercars season, along with the series&#x27; other two-driver races, the Sandown 500 and Gold Coast 600. The 2013 race itself was a close finish between Ford&#x27;s factory team drivers from Ford Performance Racing, Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards, and Triple Eight Race Engineering&#x27;s Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell. In 2013 the 1000 km was completed in the record time of six hours, eleven minutes and twenty-seven seconds. This was Ford&#x27;s first victory since 2008. It was also the first time since 1977 that an overtly Ford factory backed car triumphed.

The 2014 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 saw Volvo return for the first time since 1998, with Garry Rogers Motorsport entering two Volvo S60s. Between the 2013 and 2014 races, the track was resurfaced. This new track surface resulted in a marked reduction of lap times, and during free practice many of the drivers recorded times that were under the existing practice lap record. As with the early Phillip Island races, some of this new surface started to break up early in the race, particularly at Griffin&#x27;s Bend. Many drivers were caught off guard and ran into the tyre wall due to the debris on the track.

With 100 laps remaining, the officials suspended the race with a red flag, only the third red flag at the race after 1981 and 1992. The cars were then lined up on pit straight, and controversy ensued as teams exploited the regulations and performed repairs on the cars. Once the track repairs were finished the race resumed in single file under the safety car. Racing soon recommenced, but competition was further interrupted by a number of safety-car periods. The race was run to its full distance and finished in the early evening, with Ford Performance Racing drivers Chaz Mostert and Paul Morris taking victory on the final lap, after the lead car of Jamie Whincup and Paul Dumbrell ran low on fuel. Morris and Mostert had started the race from last position after being excluded from qualifying.

In 2015, Chaz Mostert experienced a major reversal of fortunes, with a heavy qualifying crash leaving him with a fractured femur and wrist, and ruling his car out for the weekend. The incident also injured several marshals. On Sunday, after a mid-race rain shower, Craig Lowndes and Steven Richards eventually prevailed for their sixth and fourth wins of the Bathurst 1000 respectively. It was Lowndes&#x27; thirteenth podium at the event, an all-time record.

===Supercars Championship era===
The 2016 race, the first under the renamed Supercars Championship banner, featured 91 green laps to start the race, followed by a dramatic and safety-car–filled conclusion to proceedings. Most notably, there was a late-race incident between Garth Tander and Scott McLaughlin, retiring the former&#x27;s car, which occurred as Triple Eight&#x27;s Jamie Whincup attempted to redress a clash between himself and McLaughlin at the Chase. Whincup received a fifteen-second time penalty; despite taking the chequered flag first, he was classified 11th. This allowed the Tekno Autosports entry of Will Davison and Jonathon Webb to take victory, just over one tenth of a second ahead of the Triple Eight entry of Shane van Gisbergen and Alexandre Prémat. Following the finish, Triple Eight announced they were appealing the penalty, regarding the appropriateness of a time penalty for such an offence. The appeal, held by the Supercars National Court of Appeal in the County Court of Victoria, was dismissed in a hearing nine days after the race.

The 2017 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 saw another victory for an independent team with Erebus Motorsport prevailing in mostly wet conditions with David Reynolds and Luke Youlden behind the wheel. Erebus also joined Tekno as the only teams to win both the Bathurst 12 Hour and the Bathurst 1000. David Reynolds and Luke Youlden continued their form into the 2018 edition, taking pole and leading the majority of the race until Reynolds suffered from leg cramps late in the race, allowing the 2015-winning combination of Craig Lowndes and Steven Richards to take the lead and the eventual victory, Lowndes&#x27; seventh event win and Richards&#x27; fifth.
The 2019 race only featured one safety car in the first 101 laps, but the final 60 laps featured seven, eventually resulting in a one-lap sprint to the chequered flag. Scott McLaughlin, driving with Alexandre Prémat, held on to win from the Triple Eight entry of Shane van Gisbergen and Garth Tander; this was the first Bathurst 1000 win for the Ford Mustang nameplate, the first for Dick Johnson Racing since Team Penske took a stake in the team in 2014, and the first for DJR since 1994. However, the race results remained provisional for a week until a hearing was held into DJR Team Penske&#x27;s instructions to team-mate Fabian Coulthard during an earlier safety car. The instructions over team radio resulted in Coulthard slowing the field after a safety car was called, which allowed McLaughlin and Jamie Whincup to pit without losing any positions. Despite already being given a drive-through penalty during the race, after the hearing Coulthard was further relegated to the last finisher and the team was docked 300 Teams&#x27; Championship points and fined AU$250,000 with $100,000 of the fine suspended. As it could not be proven that the instructions were intended to advantage McLaughlin and Prémat, their race win remained. One month after the race, an investigation into McLaughlin&#x27;s qualifying engine found a breach, resulting in a further fine, loss of his pole position and qualifying lap record and demotion to last place on the grid for the 2019 Sandown 500.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 race was held a week later than usual and with a limited number of fans, capped at 4,000 daily. In what was the final event for a factory-backed Holden team before the brand&#x27;s retirement, the race was won by Shane van Gisbergen and Garth Tander, the latter&#x27;s fourth Bathurst 1000 win. For the first time since 2000, the event was the final round of the championship, but Scott McLaughlin had already secured an unassailable lead at the penultimate event.

==Famous winners==
The most successful driver at Bathurst is Peter Brock, whose nine victories (1972, 1975, 1978–80, 1982–84 and 1987) earned him the nickname &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;.
For this reason, rock band Midnight Oil would also play their song, &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; or the TV station broadcasting the race would play the song. Ironically, the song has nothing to do with race.

Bob Jane won the race four times in succession from 1961 to 1964. Jane&#x27;s racing exploits assisted in the creation of his automotive businesses, originally with automotive vehicle dealerships, then later more prominently with a national chain of tyre retailers, Bob Jane T-Marts. The company became a title sponsor of the race between 2002 and 2004. Three of Jane&#x27;s wins were with Harry Firth, who went on to win a fourth race in 1967 and also was a team manager for the 1969 and 1972 Holden Dealer Team victories.

New Zealand&#x27;s Jim Richards won the race seven times (1978–80, 1991–92, 1998 and 2002) and also holds the record for the most starts (35) at this event. Richards&#x27; son Steven is also a five-time winner (1998, 1999, 2013, 2015 and 2018). The two other multiple winners from New Zealand are Greg Murphy, who has won the race four times (1996, 1999, 2003 and 2004), and Shane van Gisbergen three time winner in 2020, 2022 and 2023.

Craig Lowndes, who was a protégé of Brock, and has followed his path in terms of success and popularity, has won the race seven times. He has won three Bathurst races in a Falcon (2006–08) and four in a Commodore (1996, 2010, 2015 and 2018), and also holds the record for most Bathurst podiums, with fourteen.

Larry Perkins is the equal fourth most successful driver at Bathurst, with six victories (1982–84, 1993, 1995 and 1997). Like Jim Richards, Perkins achieved three of his victories as co-drivers with Brock in consecutive years in the Holden Dealer Team era.

Mark Skaife has also won six times. His first won in 1991 with a Nissan Skyline GT-R, then again in 1992 with the same car, and in 2001, 2002, 2005 and 2010 in a Holden Commodore.

Garth Tander is a five-time winner, all in Holdens.

Jamie Whincup, the driver with the most championship titles in ATCC/Supercars history, is a four-time winner of the race. His first three wins were with Craig Lowndes, with his fourth coming in 2012 with Paul Dumbrell.

Canadian-born Allan Moffat is Ford&#x27;s most successful Bathurst driver, winning the race four times (1970, 1971, 1973 and 1977). The 1977 race saw Moffat and teammate Colin Bond cross the finish line side by side after opening up an indomitable lead in the early laps.

Dick Johnson first rose to fame during the 1980 race when his privately entered Ford Falcon hit a rock that had fallen (or been pushed; the topic is still debated) onto the track. Thanks to public donations of over A$70,000 – and a matching donation from Ford – Johnson was able to rebuild his car and win the Bathurst race the following year. He went on to win twice more, in 1989 and 1994.

==Deaths==
In the over fifty-year history of the event, three drivers have died whilst competing in the Bathurst 1000.

In 1986, Sydney accountant and privateer entrant Mike Burgmann became the first fatality in the race&#x27;s history when his car, a Holden VK Commodore SS Group A, travelling at , struck the tyre barrier at the base of the Armor All Bridge (then sponsored by John Player Special) on the high-speed straight known as Conrod Straight. &quot;The Chase&quot;, a large three-corner chicane added in 1987 to the straight, was dedicated to Burgmann with a plaque embedded in the concrete barriers.

In 1992, Formula One World Champion Denny Hulme, after complaining of blurred vision, suffered a heart attack at the wheel of his BMW M3 Evolution whilst travelling along Conrod Straight. After veering into the wall on the left side of the track, his car came to a relatively controlled stop on the opposite side of the course. When marshals reached the scene, Hulme was unconscious and he was pronounced dead at Bathurst Hospital after suffering a second heart attack.

In 1994, Melbourne privateer entrant Don Watson died during practice. His car, a Holden VP Commodore, had a mechanical failure and went straight ahead at the entry to The Chase, hitting a barrier at almost .

Additionally, the 2006 event was marred by the death of New Zealand driver Mark Porter in a Development V8 Supercar Series support race on the Friday of the meeting. Porter had been scheduled to compete in the 1000 as a driver for the Brad Jones Racing team.

==Peter Brock Trophy==
Peter Brock died weeks before the 2006 race in an accident during the Targa West rally in Western Australia. Following this, Supercars announced that from 2006 onwards, the drivers in the Bathurst 1000 would be racing to win the &quot;Peter Brock Trophy&quot;. The 2006 event also honoured Brock with special tributes; including the front row of the starting grid being left vacant, all cars bearing an &#x27;05&#x27; number sticker made famous by Brock, and a champions&#x27; lap of honour featuring Brock&#x27;s past co-drivers parading in cars that Brock won Bathurst with.

The trophy, manufactured by Hardy Brothers, is inscribed with the words &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;, a long-time nickname of Brock&#x27;s. It weighs and stands tall. Craig Lowndes, a long time mentee of Brock, has won the trophy a record six times since its inception.

<text>The Brown&#x27;s Chicken massacre was a mass murder that occurred on January 8, 1993, in Palatine, Illinois, when two robbers shot and killed seven employees at a Brown&#x27;s Chicken fast-food restaurant.

The case remained unsolved for nearly nine years, until one of the assailants was implicated by his girlfriend in 2002. Police used DNA samples from the murder scene to match one of the suspects, Juan Luna. Luna was put on trial in 2007, found guilty of seven counts of first degree murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. James Degorski, the other assailant, was found guilty in 2009 on all seven counts of first degree murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

==Incident==
On January 8, 1993, seven people were shot and killed at the Brown&#x27;s Chicken &amp; Pasta at 168 West Northwest Highway in Palatine. The victims included the owners, 50-year-old Richard E. Ehlenfeldt and 49-year-old Lynn A. Ehlenfeldt (&quot;née&quot; Wiese), and five employees: 46-year-old Guadalupe Maldonado, 16-year-old Michael C. Castro, 17-year-old Rico L. Solis, 32-year-old Thomas Mennes, and 31-year-old Marcus Nellsen; Castro and Solis were Palatine High School students working there part-time. All victims had been killed in two walk-in freezers. Lynn Ehlenfeldt also had her throat slashed before being shot. The assailants stole between $1,800 and $1,900 from the restaurant, .

Two of the Ehlenfeldts&#x27; daughters were scheduled to be at the restaurant that night, but were not present at the time of the killing. A third daughter, Jennifer, was later elected to the Wisconsin Senate.

Michael Castro&#x27;s parents called the police a couple hours after closing time. Later, Guadalupe Maldonado&#x27;s wife also called the police, concerned that her husband did not return home from work and that his car was still in the apparently closed Brown&#x27;s Chicken parking lot. When officers arrived at the building, they spotted the rear employees&#x27; door open. Inside, they found the seven bodies, some face-down, some face-up, in a cooler and in a walk-in refrigerator. When Palatine police found the bodies, it was more than 5½ hours after the 9 p.m. closing.

==Perpetrators==
In March 2002, more than nine years after the murders, Anne Lockett came forward and implicated her former boyfriend, James Degorski, and his associate, Juan Luna, in the crime. Degorski and Luna had been childhood friends and attended William Fremd High School together. Luna, then aged 18, was a former employee of the restaurant. In April 2002, the Palatine Police Department matched a DNA sample from Luna to a sample of saliva from a piece of partially eaten chicken found in the garbage during the crime scene investigation.

The chicken was kept in a freezer for most of the time since the crime. Testimony at trial indicated it was not frozen for several days after discovery, and was allowed to thaw several times for examination and testing, in the hope of an eventual match via increasingly sophisticated testing methods not available in 1993.

The Palatine Police Department took the two suspects into custody on May 16, 2002. Luna confessed to the crime during an interrogation, though his lawyers later claimed that he was coerced to do so through police brutality and had his family, who were Mexican nationals, threatened with deportation. Degorski also confessed and an audio recording of it played during his trial, although his lawyers similarly contended that the confession was obtained under duress. Both men subsequently went to trial.

On May 10, 2007, Juan Luna was found guilty of all seven counts of murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole on May 17. The state sought the death penalty, which was available at the time, but the jury&#x27;s vote of eleven-to-one in favor of the death penalty fell short of the required unanimity to impose it. In 2019, an action was filed by the U.S. government to revoke Luna&#x27;s naturalized citizenship, which he had obtained in the time between the murders and his arrest.

On September 29, 2009, James Degorski was found guilty of all seven counts of murder, largely on the testimony of his former girlfriend Anne Lockett and another woman, Eileen Bakalla, who both stated that Degorski separately confessed to them. Luna had also implicated Degorski during his own confession in 2002. On October 20, 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. All but two of the jurors voted for the death penalty.

In March 2014, a jury awarded James Degorski $451,000 in compensation and punitive damages after being beaten by a Sheriff&#x27;s deputy in Cook County Jail in May 2002. He suffered facial fractures that required surgery. The deputy was eventually dismissed.

Degorski appealed the verdict in 2016 and 2022, claiming that Luna had been the sole perpetrator and again calling Lockett&#x27;s testimony uncredible due to her record for psychiatric issues and past drug addiction. In 2016, Degorski also presented a sworn statement by fellow inmate Richard Bilik, whom Lockett had been dating during their own relationship, who alleged that Lockett had repeatedly asked him about the Brown&#x27;s Chicken murders, after which Des Plaines and Palantine police took him in for questioning; Bilik had been serving a 15 year sentence for arson since 2012. The appeals were denied both times in court.

== Aftermath ==

The incident had an adverse effect on the entire Brown&#x27;s Chicken franchise. Sales at all restaurants dropped 35 percent within months of the incident, and the company eventually had to close 100 restaurants in the Chicago area.

The building was razed in April 2001, after briefly housing a dry cleaning establishment and then standing vacant for many years. A Chase Bank branch office was constructed at the former Brown&#x27;s location.

Luna and Degorski are imprisoned at the Stateville Correctional Center.

<text>Shingo Takatsu (高津 臣吾, &quot;Takatsu Shingo&quot;) (born November 25, 1968) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher and manager. He had a short stint with the Chicago White Sox where he was the closer for two seasons until struggles closing games ultimately led to his demotion to the minors. Despite being demoted in the summer of 2005, he received a World Series ring with the White Sox. He was signed by the New York Mets during the season, and he pitched in nine games for New York. After the 2005 season, he returned to the Nippon Professional Baseball.

He is known by the nickname &quot;Mr. Zero&quot; because he did not give up a single run in 11 Japan Series games. In the 2004 season, his entrance in home games was accompanied by a video montage and a loud gong.

Shingo Takatsu, like many Japanese pitchers, has incorporated pauses into his pitching mechanics in order to throw off batters&#x27; timing. His arm angle varies from sidearm to submarine.

==Biography==

Takatsu was a fan of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp during his childhood, and grew up wanting to play for the team. He attended Hiroshima Kogyo High School, and his team advanced to the Koshien tournament twice in his senior year. However, Takatsu was the backup pitcher, and never pitched in the tournament. He continued pitching for Asia University (Japan), but was the backup throughout his college years.

Takatsu was drafted by the Yakult Swallows in the third round of the 1990 draft. He won only 6 games in his first two years as a starter, but became the team&#x27;s closer in 1993, after marking his first save on May 2. He made 20 saves that year, contributing to his team&#x27;s championship.

In 1994, Takatsu led the league in saves (19), and saved over 20 games in each of 1995 and 1996. In 1997, he blew several saves at the beginning of the season, and was demoted to relief duty for the rest of 1997 and 1998. He returned to his closing role in 1999, and led the league in saves (30) for the second time in his career. He repeated his performance in 2001, making 37 saves as his team won the championship again. In 2003, he passed Kazuhiro Sasaki in career saves, and led the league in saves for the fourth time in his career.

In 2004, he signed with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent, and marked a 2.31 ERA in 56 games, along with 19 saves. His first major league appearance came against Hideki Matsui, whom he had faced numerous times in the Japanese Central League. Matsui&#x27;s first home run in Japan had come off Takatsu in the same game in which Takatsu recorded his first career save. Takatsu finished second in AL Rookie of the Year voting behind Bobby Crosby. Takatsu did not pitch well the next season, and was demoted to the minors, and cut in August. He signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets, and made his way up to the majors, but was dropped at the end of the season.

Takatsu returned to his old team, the Yakult Swallows, in 2006. He was a reliever early in the season, but was given the closing job after injuries to Hirotoshi Ishii and Masao Kida. On October 7, 2006, he saved his 300th game (combined number from the majors and Japan). The only other Japanese player to have made 300 saves is former Seattle Mariners closer Kazuhiro Sasaki.

He has saved 8 games in 11 Japanese championship series games (the all-time record), and has not allowed a single run in those 11 games.

In 2008, Takatsu attempted to return to U.S. baseball and signed a minor league deal, with an invitation to spring training, with the Chicago Cubs of the MLB. However, he was released midway through spring training.

Takatsu was signed to the Seoul-based, Woori Heroes on June 13, 2008. He recorded his first save on June 29, 2008, becoming the first pitcher to get saves in Nippon Professional Baseball, Major League Baseball, and Korea Baseball Organization. But he was released from Heroes in December 2008.

On June 15, 2009, he signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball.

In January 2010, Takatsu joined Sinon Bulls of CPBL in Taiwan. He becomes the first Japanese professional player to have played in NPB, MLB, KBO, and CPBL. On November 26, 2010, he announced on his blog that Sinon will not renew the contract.

In 2020, he became the manager of the Yakult Swallows, replacing Junji Ogawa.

In 2022, he was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Pitching style==
Takatsu throws from the sidearm, and relies on three types of sinkers to mix up opponents. His fastball falls in the mid 80 mph range, and his sinkers have different speeds. Two fall in the 66-70 mph range (Takatsu pitches these with a screwball mechanics, and these pitches sometimes are described as a changeup), while the other can reach 80 mph. He occasionally throws a curve as well. When Takatsu first arrived in the major leagues, commentators called his sinkers changeups, since they were so slow compared to conventional sinkers. He is one of the few closers that does not throw a good fastball or a hard breaking pitch, relying on good control to make batters hit themselves into outs.

<doc id="1072300" wikidata="Q2464695" url="?curid=1072300" title="List of districts of Arunachal Pradesh">
<text>, the Indian state Arunachal Pradesh comprised 27 districts, not including Itanagar capital complex, with more districts proposed. Most of the districts are inhabited by various tribal groups. The latest and presently valid official map of districts of Arunachal Pradesh, after the most recent new districts were last announced on 30 August 2018, is in the external links.

== Itanagar capital complex ==
 is administered by its own Deputy Commissioner, and contains the three circles of Itanagar, Naharlagun, and Banderdewa. In January 2013 the Arunachal Pradesh government approved in principle the creation of a &quot;Capital district&quot;. The capital complex is currently treated as its own district by some government departments, the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises for example, and the Arunachal Pradesh State portal in particular. But the Arunachal Pradesh reorganization of district Act of 1980 with the latest amendments from 2024 does not list Itanagar capital complex as a district.

It comprises the administrative circles of Raga (which will be the district HQ), Kumporijo and Dollungmukh circles from Lower Subansiri District. The administrative circles taken from Upper Subansiri District will be Gepen Circle, Puchigeko Circle, Daporijo Sadar which falls under 25 Raga Constituency including Ligu and Liruk demarcation from Sigen Subansiri confluence in Single Administrative Unit.

** Vijaynagar district (Arunachal) (HQ- Vijoynagar): includes Namdapha National Park &amp; Tiger Reserve.
** Diyun district (HQ- Diyun): between Namsai district HQ and Miao.
** Jairampur district (HQ- Jairampur): southwest of Diyun, on border with Assam.
** Nampong district (HQ- Nampong): near Pangsau Pass on border with Myanmar on NH-3155 Ledo Road (Stilwell Road).
** Rima district (HQ- Miao): from existing Changlang district was proposed in 2017 entail8ng existing subdivisions of Diyun, Bordumsa, Kharsang, Jairampur, Nampong, Rima-Putak (Tikhak), Miao, and Vijoynagar from the &quot;Changlang district&quot;. However, it was unanimously opposed by the Changlang People&#x27;s Forum in the same month.
* From existing Tirap district (HQ: Khonsa):
** Borduria district (HQ- Borduria): Borduria lies 10 km north of Tirap district headquarter Khonsa.

<text>Colitis is swelling or inflammation of the large intestine (colon). Colitis may be acute and self-limited or long-term. It broadly fits into the category of digestive diseases.

In a medical context, the label &quot;colitis&quot; (without qualification) is used if:
* The cause of the inflammation in the colon is undetermined; for example, &quot;colitis&quot; may be applied to &quot;Crohn&#x27;s disease&quot; at a time when the diagnosis is unknown, or
* The context is clear; for example, an individual with ulcerative colitis is talking about their disease with a physician who knows the diagnosis.

==Signs and symptoms==
The signs and symptoms of colitis are quite variable and dependent on the cause of the given colitis and factors that modify its course and severity.

Common symptoms of colitis may include: mild to severe abdominal pains and tenderness (depending on the stage of the disease), persistent hemorrhagic diarrhea with pus either present or absent in the stools, fecal incontinence, flatulence, fatigue, loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss.

More severe symptoms may include: shortness of breath, a fast or irregular heartbeat and fever.

Other less common or rare non-specific symptoms that may accompany colitis include: arthritis, mouth ulcers, painful, red and swollen skin and irritated, bloodshot eyes.

Signs seen on colonoscopy include: colonic mucosal erythema (redness of the colon&#x27;s inner surface), ulcerations and hemorrhage.

==Diagnosis==
Symptoms suggestive of colitis are worked-up by obtaining the medical history, a physical examination and laboratory tests (CBC, electrolytes, stool culture and sensitivity, stool ova and parasites et cetera). Additional tests may include medical imaging (e.g. abdominal computed tomography, abdominal X-rays) and an examination with a camera inserted into the rectum (sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy).

An important investigation in the assessment of colitis is biopsy for histopathology. A very small piece of tissue (usually about 2mm) is removed from the bowel mucosa during endoscopy and examined under the microscope by a histopathologist. A biopsy report generally does not state the diagnosis, but should state any presence of chronic colitis, give an indication of disease activity, as well as state the presence of any epithelial damage (erosions and ulcerations).

Histopathology findings generally associated with chronic colitis include:

Other findings include basal plasmacytosis and mucin depletion.
Histopathology findings generally associated with active colitis include:
==Types==
There are many types of colitis. They are usually classified by the cause.

Types of colitis include:


===Autoimmune===
* Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) – a group of chronic colitides.
** Ulcerative colitis (UC) – a chronic colitis that affects the large intestine.
** Crohn&#x27;s disease (CD) – another type of IBD that often leads to colitis.

===Unknown===
* Microscopic colitis – a colitis diagnosed by microscopic examination of colonic tissue; macroscopically (&quot;to the eye&quot;) it appears normal.
** Lymphocytic colitis
** Collagenous colitis

===Treatment-caused===
* Diversion colitis
* Chemical colitis
* Chemotherapy-induced colitis
* Radiation colitis
* Checkpoint inhibitor induced colitis

===Vascular disease===
* Ischemic colitis

===Infectious===

* Infectious colitis

A subtype of infectious colitis is &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; colitis, which is informally abbreviated as &quot;C-diff colitis&quot;. It classically forms and is often referred to as pseudomembranous colitis, which is its (nonspecific) histomorphologic description.

Enterohemorrhagic colitis may be caused by Shiga toxin in &quot;Shigella dysenteriae&quot; or &quot;Shigatoxigenic group&quot; of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (STEC), which includes serotype O157:H7 and other enterohemorrhagic &quot;E. coli&quot;.

Parasitic infections, like those caused by &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, can also cause colitis.

===Unclassifiable colitides===
&quot;Indeterminate colitis&quot; is the classification for colitis that has features of both &quot;Crohn&#x27;s disease&quot; and &quot;ulcerative colitis&quot;. Indeterminate colitis&#x27; behaviour is usually closer to ulcerative colitis than Crohn&#x27;s disease.

==Treatment==
Treatment for this condition can include medications such as steroids and dietary changes.  In some instances, hospitalization and surgery may be required.

Moreover, several studies recently have found significant relationship between colitis and dairy allergy (including: cow milk, UHT cow milk and casein), suggesting some patients may benefit from an elimination diet.

=== Microbiome modification ===
The use of oral probiotic supplements to modify the composition and behavior of the microbiome has been considered as a possible therapy for both induction and maintenance of remission in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease and ulcerative colitis. A Cochrane review in 2020 did not find clear evidence of improved remission likelihood, nor lower adverse events, in people with Crohn&#x27;s disease, following probiotic treatment.

For ulcerative colitis, there is low-certainty evidence that probiotic supplements may increase the probability of clinical remission. People receiving probiotics were 73% more likely to experience disease remission and over 2x as likely to report improvement in symptoms compared to those receiving a placebo, with no clear difference in minor or serious adverse effects. Although there was no clear evidence of greater remission when probiotic supplements were compared with 5‐aminosalicylic acid treatment as a monotherapy, the likelihood of remission was 22% higher if probiotics were used in combination with 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy. Whereas in people who are already in remission, it is unclear whether probiotics help to prevent future relapse, either as a monotherapy or combination therapy.

== Research ==
One study reported successfully treating experimental colitis in mice with mesenchymal stem cells.

Additional research was conducted by Huang &quot;et al.&quot; that analyzed specific genes and biological markers that are associated with the risk of colon cancer development in patients with colitis. The results showed a correlation between certain biomarkers and the development of disease.

Colitis is common in parts of the world where helminthic colonisation is rare, and uncommon in those areas where most people carry worms. Infections with helminths may alter the autoimmune response that causes the disease. Early trials of &quot;Trichuris suis&quot; ova (TSO) showed promising results when used in people with IBD but later trials failed at Phase 2, and most were eventually discontinued. However, the phase 2 trials had used a different formulation of TSO from the one that had been used in the earlier studies that had shown positive outcomes.

<text>Chester Leo &quot;Chet&quot; Helms (August 2, 1942 – June 25, 2005), often called the father of San Francisco&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Summer of Love,&quot; was a music promoter and a counterculture figure in San Francisco during its hippie period in the mid- to-late 1960s.

Helms was the founder and manager of Big Brother and the Holding Company and recruited Janis Joplin as its lead singer. He was a producer and organizer, helping to stage free concerts and other cultural events at Golden Gate Park, the backdrop of San Francisco&#x27;s Summer of Love in 1967, as well as at other venues, including the Avalon Ballroom.

He was the first producer of psychedelic light-show concerts at the Fillmore and the Avalon Ballroom and was instrumental in helping to develop bands that had the distinctive San Francisco Sound. Helms died June 25, 2005, of complications of a stroke. He was 62.

==Childhood==
Chester Leo Helms was born in Santa Maria, California, the eldest of three sons. His parents were Chester and Novella Helms. Helms&#x27; father, a manager at a local sugar beet mill, died when his oldest child was nine. Chet&#x27;s mother, Novella, took the boys and their terminally ill father to Texas where her family, the Dearmore family resided. After Chet&#x27;s father passed away his mother studied to become a school teacher and took the boys to the Ozarks in southwest Missouri and taught school in a two-room schoolhouse. She taught four grades in one room and the other four grades were taught by another teacher in the other room.

Helms spent the rest of his youth in Missouri and Texas, where he learned to organize events by helping to stage benefits for civil-rights groups. He enrolled at the University of Texas and became part of the music scene there, a scene that included a very young and inexperienced Janis Joplin. Soon he dropped out of school and, inspired by the Beat Generation writers, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg traveled across America in search of freedom and inspiration. He set off wearing shoulder-length hair, a beard and rimless glasses hitchhiking across the country. He ended up in San Francisco in 1962.

Later he returned to Austin with his best friend at the time, Peter Haigh, to visit his friend Janis Joplin. He thought she could make it as a singer in San Francisco. After a week of partying, they persuaded Janis to drop out of school and hitchhike back to San Francisco with them. Later he would bring her to the attention of Big Brother and the Holding Company.

==Arrival in San Francisco==
After arriving in San Francisco in 1962, he scrounged a living in various ways, including selling marijuana, an occupation that caused him to go to a boardinghouse at 1090 Page Street. The house was in Haight-Ashbury, then a rundown, low-rent neighborhood. Having met many musicians in his trade, and appreciating the vibrant music scene in San Francisco, he instinctively recognized the need for a forum for musicians to play music together. When he saw the large basement at Page Street, he began arranging jam sessions for the local bands and musicians. Helms, an astute organizer, made those sessions popular and started charging an admission fee of 50 cents. His career as a rock concert promoter began. Big Brother and the Holding Company formed and Helms functioned as their informal manager. He teamed up Janis Joplin with Big Brother for music sessions in the Haight-Ashbury basement.

==Family Dog Productions==
===Founding===
In February 1966 he formed a loose connection with Family Dog Productions at 2111 Pine Street, a hippie commune, which hosted dances and events.

Helms was the ideal person to help this group organize their presentations and he moved into the Family Dog house. Their first formal production was a concert at Longshoremen&#x27;s Hall.

In February 1966, Helms formally founded Family Dog Productions to begin promoting concerts at The Fillmore Auditorium, alternating weekends with another young promoter, Bill Graham. Helms was instrumental in introducing Bill Graham to the nascent music scene in the Haight Asbury District of S.F. Helms was nurturing when Graham caught wind of the excitement Helms was creating and promoting. As the concerts became more popular, inevitable &quot;conflicts&quot; arose between the two promoters. Chet&#x27;s style was &quot;easy-going, mellow, soft-tempered until pushed.&quot; Graham&#x27;s style was more driven. Within a few months Helms secured the permits necessary to host events at the Avalon Ballroom, an old dancehall at 1268 Sutter Street, on the corner of Sutter and Van Ness. Big Brother and the Holding Company debuted there in June 1966. Later Helms would get them the appearance that made them famous, the Monterey Pop Festival, where Albert Grossman spotted Joplin and offered her a contract.

===Family Dog concerts===
In the context of the Avalon&#x27;s &quot;anti-business model&quot; and loose ambience, Helms&#x27; Family Dog held a series of concerts between April 1966 and November 1968, featuring a mix of artists, including rock, blues, soul, Indian, and rock and roll. They included:

Helms presented top blues performers including Country Joe and The Fish; Howlin&#x27; Wolf; Bo Diddley; Muddy Waters; Little Walter; Buddy Guy; Junior Wells; the Paul Butterfield Blues Band; Buddy Miles; James Cotton Blues Band; John Mayall; Big Mama Thornton; Albert Collins; Steve Miller; Son House; Mike Bloomfield; Elvin Bishop; Blues Project, with Al Kooper; John Hammond; Charlie Musselwhite; Siegel-Schwall Band; rock bands like The Doors; Buffalo Springfield; the Byrds; Bill Haley &amp; His Comets; The Kinks;The Edwin Hawkins Singers; the Animals&#x27; Eric Burdon &amp; War; The Mothers of Invention; Lovin&#x27; Spoonful; The Carlos Santana Blues Band; Sir Douglas Quintet; the Soul Survivors; the Fugs; Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears; The Association; Shorty Featuring Georgie Fame; Grateful Dead; Iron Butterfly; the Youngbloods, with Jesse Colin Young; Vanilla Fudge; Steppenwolf; Poco; Love, with Arthur Lee; sarode-player and Indian music teacher, Ali Akbar Khan; Sandy Bull; Blue Cheer; the Leaves; New Riders of the Purple Sage; Barry McGuire; Flamin&#x27; Groovies; the Loading Zone; It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day; Joy of Cooking; the Grass Roots; the Sons of Adam; Sons of Champlin; Captain Beefheart; the Electric Flag; Velvet Underground; Pacific Gas and Electric; Moby Grape; the Sopwith Camel; 13th Floor Elevators; The Charlatans; Allmen Joy (see Wings West Concrete Pools Perth); Mother Earth; Southern Comfort; The Ace of Cups; Tyrannosaurus Rex; Cleanliness and Godliness Skiffle Band; Flying Burrito Brothers; Congress of Love; Notes From the Underground; Chrome Circus; Initial Shock; Oxford Circle; Daily Flash; Electric Train; Sparrow; the Orchestra; Hourglass; Kaleidoscope; Mt. Rushmore; Other Half; Phoenix; Lothar &amp; the Hand People; Commander Cody; Cleveland Wrecking Company; The Rhythm Dukes; A.B. Skhy; Frumious Bandersnatch; Eighth Penny Matter; Jimmerfield Legend; South Side Sound; Super Ball; Solid Muldoon; Box Top; and jazz artists Sun Ra and San Francisco&#x27;s own John Handy; Charles Lloyd; the Jerry Hahn Brotherhood; and folksters Joan Baez; Dave Van Ronk; Jim Kweskin Jug Band; Taj Mahal; Tim Buckley and Flatt &amp; Scruggs.

===Family Dog speakers/Poets/Heroes of the Hour===
Sometimes Helms cast the music promoter role aside and the Family Dog would feature speakers, including Alan Watts, Dr. Timothy Leary, Stephen Gaskin, poet Allen Ginsberg, and other counterculture gurus. Helms is linked in San Francisco lore with Bill Graham, the Diggers, Emmett Grogan, Ken Kesey, Jack Kerouac, Gary Snyder, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael McClure, Neal Cassady, Kenneth Rexroth, Ralph J. Gleason, and others.

=== The Family Dog Denver ===
In 1967, Helms and budding rock promotor Barry Fey agreed to open a Family Dog Productions concert dance hall in Denver, Colorado. They called it The Family Dog Denver, and brought in acts like The Doors, the Grateful Dead, Van Morrison, Jefferson Airplane, Buffalo Springfield, Chuck Berry, and many others. The San Francisco psychedelic poster artists were commissioned by Helms to do posters for the shows. Little has been known about the venue until the 2021 release of the documentary, &quot;The Tale of the Dog,&quot; which unearthed the story through interviews with the venue staff, bands, posters artists, attendees and Denver police, detailing the full history and lasting impact of &quot;The Dog&quot; for the first time.

===Artwork and posters===
To promote their concerts in both San Francisco and Denver, Family Dog published a series of innovative psychedelic posters, handbills and other ephemera, created by a group of prominent young San Francisco artists including Wes Wilson, Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse (Mouse Studios), Rick Griffin, Steve Renick and Victor Moscoso. Often printed using intensely colored fluorescent inks, they typically featured a mixture of found images and specially drawn artwork. The posters of Griffin, Mouse and Kelly, in particular, were known for the intricate and highly stylized hand-lettering in which the concert details were written out, which sometimes took considerable time and effort to decipher. Original Avalon posters are now collector&#x27;s items. In a slide show published with the obituary at the time of Wilson&#x27;s death in 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; included an apparent portrait watercolor of Helms—a book in the foreground has Helms&#x27; full name on it.

Helms was also involved in joint productions/promotions at the Fillmore, Longshoreman&#x27;s Hall, and Haight Street&#x27;s Straight Theater (not all formal Family Dog Dance-Concerts).

==Style as promoter==
While Graham was an aggressive businessman and professional promoter, Helms presented a philosophical and intellectual business approach. He was the visionary along with Boots Houghston. He related easily to the San Francisco hippie subculture since, in essence, he was one of them. It was not the money he was after, that was the by-product of artistic talent; it was the creative unity of new emerging music sounds that enriched Helms and the community he was talking to, which spread worldwide. The San Francisco Chronicle called Helms &quot;a towering figure in the 1960s Bay Area music scene.&quot;

Helms embraced music for music&#x27;s sake and the Beat-hipster-generation-turned-hippie philosophy. While the war raged in Vietnam and the nation coped with racial clashes and assassinations, the anti-war, anti-establishment youth thrived in the throes of a social revolution. Meanwhile, Helms was cranking out bands and musicians espousing the same lifestyle as this new audience, while giving the very distinct impression that he was indifferent to money and commercial success.

His benign image could be deceptive. According to Jay Ferguson of Spirit, Graham would negotiate shrewdly and frequently offer a lower fee to a band than Helms, but when the concert was over, he would pay the band in full; Helms did not always do likewise. Some of the more serious bands (those not subsidized by trust funds) came to prefer Graham&#x27;s hard-nosed, businesslike approach. Graham did covertly help Helms financially at various times during the 1970s, keeping San Francisco in the fore as the West Coast Music mecca.

The core San Francisco rock bands, Jefferson Airplane, Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Country Joe and the Fish, and Quicksilver Messenger Service (including pre-Dino Valenti), would play for both Graham&#x27;s concerts at the Fillmore Auditorium, and the Family Dog at Helms&#x27; Avalon dances.

Helms&#x27; shows were always more relaxed and offered a pleasant alternative to Bill Graham Presents dances, at a more reasonable admission, and with more room for the stoned, arm-waving type of solo dancing that personified the era.

==Janis Joplin==
To concertgoers, Helms&#x27; contributions to the music world, like introducing a singer he knew in Texas, Janis Joplin, to the San Francisco music scene, were not always well publicized, but witnessing the final product of Joplin, with her powerful performances, was a spectacle. First introduced as a new bandmember of Big Brother, she brought what the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Big Brother did not seem at that point to have – a lead singer to match Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s Marty Balin and Signe Toly Anderson.

With Joplin as the lead singer, Helms became the group&#x27;s manager and introduced them on stage when they made their crucial appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, a performance that marked Joplin&#x27;s elevation to national prominence.

==Evolution==
Bill Graham Presents shows evolved more into high-power, professional lineups of better-known headline bands that made him known as the can-do guy that he was, while Helms, although managing to produce top-flight bands, still showcased bands that tended to be hipper and local. Helms didn&#x27;t seem to have the need to hire zealous uniformed security guards, so teenagers found it easier to sneak into his dances. Helms ultimately allowed free admission after midnight. The San Francisco Family Dog dances later re-emerged in a new location, the Family Dog on the Great Highway at the edge of the Western World (its exaggerated sometimes heard full title) which opened in the summer of 69. It was the former Ocean Beach Pavilion Ballroom turned slot car track that was right next door to the old skating rink and &quot;Bull Pup Enchiladas&quot; at Playland, Ocean Beach, at 660 The Great Highway in San Francisco&#x27;s Richmond district.

In his career Helms used other locations like ventures in Denver, Portland, and joint productions/promotions at the Fillmore, Longshoreman&#x27;s Hall, and Haight Street&#x27;s Straight Theater (not all formal Family Dog Dance-Concerts), etc.

==Later years==
Helms left the concert business in 1970, except for managing a few later events: Tribal Stomp at Berkeley&#x27;s Greek Theater (1978), Tribal Stomp II at the Monterey County Fairgrounds (1979), a concert series at San Francisco&#x27;s Maritime Hall in 1995 under the Family Dog name, and a 30th Anniversary celebration of the Summer of Love in Golden Gate Park (1997), a free event attended by 60,000 people.

Helms became an accomplished art dealer, selling American and European paintings and sculpture at his Atelier Doré art gallery on Bush Street in San Francisco, from 1980 until 2004. After suffering a mild stroke he died within days, on June 25, 2005. Helms is memorialized in a &quot;bright niche decorated with photographs and memorabilia&quot; at the Neptune Society Columbarium.
==Fundraiser and tribute concert==
On July 24, 2005, a fundraiser and tribute concert to Chet was held at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco. The show was organized by Dawn Holliday (Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival organizer), Roger McNamee (who put together a collection of posters from major bay area artists) and Pete Sears who was responsible for finding and organizing the musicians. Kathy Peck of the H.E.A.R. foundation organized the online auction. 
Pete Sears had been talking with Chet while he was sick in the hospital and offered to help get together a benefit to take care of some pressing bills Chet was concerned about. Chet wholeheartedly gave the benefit his blessing. The concert details were well underway and most artists in place when Chet died. They decided to carry on with the fundraiser anyway and turned the concert into a tribute to Chet. The show sold out in just a few days, leaving many lined up outside unable to get in. But the concert obtained its primary goal which was to raise funds to pay off Chet&#x27;s bills...all money raised was given to Chet&#x27;s brother John. The concert was highly successful and featured such artists as: T Bone Burnett, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, David Nelson, Country Joe McDonald, Leigh Stephens, Bobby Vega, Joli Valenti &amp; Friends, and the Flying Other Brothers.

==Chet Helms Memorial==
On October 30, 2005, San Francisco celebrated Helms&#x27; life with a free nine-hour Sunday rock concert in Golden Gate Park, named the &quot;Tribal Stomp&quot; attended by tens of thousands, and featuring a full lineup of bands, including the old core San Francisco rock bands, and others including: The Turtles, Canned Heat, Dan Hicks (singer), the Charlatans, Country Joe McDonald, Barry Melton, Blue Cheer, Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s Paul Kantner, &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&#x27;&quot;s David LaFlamme, Quicksilver Gold (derived from Quicksilver Messenger Service), Lee Michaels, Lydia Pense Cold Blood, Pete Sears, Nick Gravenites (Electric Flag), Harvey Mandel, Jorge Santana, Narada Michael Walden, Merl Saunders, Moby Grape Jerry Miller, and Wavy Gravy (from Ken Kesey&#x27;s &quot;Merry Pranksters&quot; fame).

<text>The March Against Fear was a major 1966 demonstration in the Civil Rights Movement in the South. Activist James Meredith launched the event on June 5, 1966, intending to make a solitary walk from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi via the Mississippi Delta, starting at Memphis&#x27;s Peabody Hotel and proceeding to the Mississippi state line, then continuing through, respectively, the Mississippi cities of Hernando, Grenada, Greenwood, Indianola, Belzoni, Yazoo City, and Canton before arriving at Jackson&#x27;s City Hall. The total distance marched was approximately 270 miles over a period of 21 days. The goal was to counter the continuing racism in the Mississippi Delta after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the previous two years and to encourage African Americans in the state to register to vote. He invited only individual black men to join him and did not want it to be a large media event dominated by major civil rights organizations.

On the second day of his walk, June 6, 1966, Meredith was shot and wounded by James Aubrey Norvell, a white sniper, and was hospitalized for treatment. Thornton Davi Johnson suggests that Meredith was a target for such rituals of attack because he had made highly publicized challenges to Mississippi&#x27;s racial order, and had framed his walk as a confident repudiation of custom.

Major civil rights organizations rallied to the cause, vowing to carry on the march in Meredith&#x27;s name through the Mississippi Delta and to the state capital. The state committed to protecting the marchers. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) took part, with Deacons for Defense and Justice from Louisiana providing armed protection. The different groups and leaders struggled over tactics and goals, but also cooperated in community organizing and voter registration. They registered more than 4,000 African Americans for voting in counties along the way. Some people marched for a short time, others stayed through all the events; some national leaders took part in intermittent fashion, as they already had commitments in other cities. In addition, labor leader Walter Reuther, along with his wife May, had traveled from Chicago to march and brought 10 buses full of union supporters.

During the latter days of the march, Stokely Carmichael, the new chairman of SNCC, introduced the idea of Black Power to a broad audience. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. participated and continued to attract admiring crowds; his leadership and reputation brought numerous people out to see him, inspiring some to join the march. As the march headed south, the number of participants grew. Finally, an estimated 15,000 marchers, mostly black, entered the capital of Jackson on June 26, making it the largest civil rights march in the history of the state. The march served as a catalyst for continued community organizing and political growth over the following years among African Americans in the state. They have maintained a high rate of voting and participation in politics since then.

==History==
Disappointed by the slow pace of change following passage of civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965, James Meredith, noted for being the first African American to enroll at the University of Mississippi, decided to make a solo &#x27;March Against Fear&#x27; from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi, the state capital. He wanted to highlight continuing racial oppression in the Mississippi Delta, the heart of the black population in the state, during the 220-mile journey. Meredith wanted only black men on the march, and did not want a major media event featuring white participants.

On the second day of the march, a white sniper, later identified as James Aubrey Norvell, stepped out of a wooded area next to the road, shouted, &quot;I only want Meredith&quot;, and shot Meredith three times with a 16-gauge shotgun loaded with birdshot shells. Meredith was wounded and fell to the road. People rushed to get an ambulance and took him to the hospital. Although he was not severely injured, Meredith was unable to continue the march as planned as he was hospitalized in Memphis to recover from his injuries. Norvell was later apprehended in Desoto County; he confessed to shooting Meredith and was sentenced the same day to five years in prison.

When they learned of the shooting, other civil rights leaders, including SCLC&#x27;s Martin Luther King Jr., Allen Johnson, SNCC&#x27;s Stokely Carmichael, Cleveland Sellers and Floyd McKissick, and Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), as well as the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) and other civil rights organizations, decided to continue the march in Meredith&#x27;s name. The NAACP were originally involved but Roy Wilkins pulled out on learning that the armed Deacons for Defense and Justice were going to be protecting the march. Ordinary people, both black and white, came from across the South and all parts of the country to participate. The marchers slept on the ground outside or in large tents, and were fed mainly by local black communities. A press truck preceded them and the march was covered by national media. Along the way, members of the different civil rights groups argued and collaborated, struggling to achieve their sometimes overlapping and differing goals.

SNCC and MFDP worked to expand community organizing and achieve voter registration by reaching out to the black communities in the Delta. In most places, few blacks had registered to vote since passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, as they were still oppressed by fear and social and economic intimidation in the Jim Crow society. Along the way, the different civil rights groups struggled to reconcile their goals and to enhance the meaning of the march to promote black freedoms. It grew slowly and was embraced by black communities along the way, and by some sympathetic whites. Other whites expressed hostility, jeering and threatening, driving close to marchers. Although overt violence was generally limited, marchers from out of state were shocked and horrified by the virulence of hate expressed in some communities, particularly Philadelphia, where three civil rights workers had been murdered in 1964 and Canton.

Governor Paul Johnson, Jr. of Mississippi vowed to protect the marchers if they obeyed the law, but relations between the Highway State Police and marchers were sometimes tense. In some localities, mayors and local officials worked to keep relations peaceful. Local black communities and their churches provided food, housing and places of rest to marchers. They generally camped along the way, after returning to Memphis at the end of the first days.

On the early evening of Thursday, June 16, 1966, when the marchers arrived in Greenwood, Mississippi, and tried to set up camp at Stone Street Negro Elementary School, Carmichael was arrested for trespassing on public property. He was held for several hours by police before rejoining the marchers at a local park, where they had set up camp and were beginning a night-time rally. According to civil rights historian David Garrow, an angry Carmichael took the speaker&#x27;s platform, delivering his famous &quot;Black Power&quot; speech, arguing that blacks had to build their own political and economic power to attain independence. He used this opportunity to gain a national audience through the media to hear his speech.

King, who had flown to Chicago on Wednesday to help organize the Open Housing Movement marches in the city, returned to Mississippi on Friday. He found that some of the Civil Rights Movements&#x27; internal divisions between the old guard and new guard had gone public. Marchers called out SNCC&#x27;s &quot;Black Power&quot; slogan, as well as SCLC&#x27;s &quot;Freedom Now!&quot;

In Canton, Mississippi, on June 23, after marchers tried to erect tents on the grounds of McNeal Elementary School, they were pressed and tear-gassed by the Mississippi Highway Patrol, which was joined by other police agencies. This contradicted the governor&#x27;s commitment to protect them. Leaders felt the violence took place because President Lyndon B. Johnson had not offered federal forces to protect them following the violence in Philadelphia. Before that, while relations were often tense, the police had mostly respected the marchers. Several marchers were wounded in the Canton attack, one severely. Human Rights Medical Committee members conducted a house-to-house search that night looking for wounded marchers. The marchers sought refuge at Holy Child Jesus Catholic mission. There the Franciscan sisters extended their help and hospitality to the marchers, especially to the wounded. The following night the marchers returned to stay on the grounds of McNeal School without incident, as they did not attempt to erect tents.

After a short hospital treatment, Meredith was released. He planned to rejoin the march, then withdrew for a time, as he had not intended it to be such a large media event. He rejoined the March on June 25, the day before it arrived in Jackson and walked in the front line next to Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders.

The march stopped at Tougaloo College, a historically black college, before entering Jackson. Marchers could rest and get food and showers. Many more people joined the march at that point; national leaders returned to it from commitments in other parts of the country. The growing crowd was entertained by James Brown, Dick Gregory, Sammy Davis Jr., Burt Lancaster and Marlon Brando.

The next day, June 26, marchers entered the city of Jackson from several different streams and were estimated to number 15,000 strong, the largest civil rights march in Mississippi history. They were warmly welcomed in the black neighborhoods and by some whites. However, many whites jeered and threatened the marchers; others simply stayed indoors. The Highway Police and other forces were out in number, as the city and state had vowed to protect the marchers after the attacks in Philadelphia and Canton. As a result of negotiations with authorities, the marchers gathered at the back of the state capitol to hear speeches, sing protest and celebration songs, and celebrate their achievements.

In total, the march expressed &quot;both the depths of black grievances and the height of black possibilities,&quot; and it had to do with &quot;oppressed people controlling their own destiny.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==
*The march &quot;defied Jim Crow&#x27;s culture of intimidation&quot; by the very act of blacks asserting themselves through the different communities, celebrating their identities, and organizing.
*In the counties along the route, 4,077 African Americans registered to vote, many for the first time. Federal examiners registered 1,422 and county clerks did the rest.
*Later black veterans of the Mississippi Movement noted that the march had longstanding political and cultural effects, serving to galvanize community organizing among blacks in the state.
*In 1967 Jack R. Thornell won the annual Pulitzer Prize for Photography for his photograph of James Meredith struggling on the road in Mississippi after being shot.

<text>Bicas is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Minas Gerais. its population is estimated to be 14,554 inhabitants.

== History ==

Initially a breakpoint for salesmen in the 18th century, Bicas obtained its independence from the city of Guarará in 1923. It was an attraction point for Italian immigrants and other nationalities.

Until the 1970s, Bicas had a full-working train station and an active RFFSA (the extinct state railroad company) branch for repairing wagons. The entire structure was dismantled and today the train station exists only as a historic site. Currently, Bicas has an economy based on commerce, agriculture and farming.

Annual Farming Expositions, with bull-riding and rodeos, cattle commerce and local products - typically in the last week of July of every year - are a tradition of several cities in Zona da Mata, and the Farming Exposition of Bicas is one of the most famous, attracting thousands of tourists from several parts of the country.

<doc id="1072324" wikidata="Q1474513" url="?curid=1072324" title="Electromagnetic interference">
<text>Electromagnetic interference (EMI), also called radio-frequency interference (RFI) when in the radio frequency spectrum, is a disturbance generated by an external source that affects an electrical circuit by electromagnetic induction, electrostatic coupling, or conduction. The disturbance may degrade the performance of the circuit or even stop it from functioning. In the case of a data path, these effects can range from an increase in error rate to a total loss of the data. Both human-made and natural sources generate changing electrical currents and voltages that can cause EMI: ignition systems, cellular network of mobile phones, lightning, solar flares, and auroras (northern/southern lights). EMI frequently affects AM radios. It can also affect mobile phones, FM radios, and televisions, as well as observations for radio astronomy and atmospheric science.

EMI can be used intentionally for radio jamming, as in electronic warfare.



== History ==
Since the earliest days of radio communications, the negative effects of interference from both intentional and unintentional transmissions have been felt and the need to manage the radio frequency spectrum became apparent.

In 1933, a meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in Paris recommended the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) be set up to deal with the emerging problem of EMI. CISPR subsequently produced technical publications covering measurement and test techniques and recommended emission and immunity limits. These have evolved over the decades and form the basis of much of the world&#x27;s EMC regulations today.

In 1979, legal limits were imposed on electromagnetic emissions from all digital equipment by the FCC in the US in response to the increased number of digital systems that were interfering with wired and radio communications. Test methods and limits were based on CISPR publications, although similar limits were already enforced in parts of Europe.

In the mid 1980s, the European Union member states adopted a number of &quot;new approach&quot; directives with the intention of standardizing technical requirements for products so that they do not become a barrier to trade within the EC. One of these was the EMC Directive (89/336/EC) and it applies to all equipment placed on the market or taken into service. Its scope covers all apparatus &quot;liable to cause electromagnetic disturbance or the performance of which is liable to be affected by such disturbance&quot;.

This was the first time there was a legal requirement on immunity, as well as emissions on apparatus intended for the general population. Although there may be additional costs involved for some products to give them a known level of immunity, it increases their perceived quality as they are able to co-exist with apparatus in the active EM environment of modern times and with fewer problems.

Many countries now have similar requirements for products to meet some level of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulation.

== Types ==

Electromagnetic interference divides into several categories according to the source and signal characteristics.

The origin of interference, often called &quot;noise&quot; in this context, can be human-made (artificial) or natural.

Continuous, or continuous wave (CW), interference arises where the source continuously emits at a given range of frequencies. This type is naturally divided into sub-categories according to frequency range, and as a whole is sometimes referred to as &quot;DC to daylight&quot;. One common classification is into narrowband and broadband, according to the spread of the frequency range.

* Audio frequency, from very low frequencies up to around 20 kHz. Frequencies up to 100 kHz may sometimes be classified as audio. Sources include:
** Mains hum from: power supply units, nearby power supply wiring, transmission lines and substations.
** Audio processing equipment, such as audio power amplifiers and loudspeakers.
** Demodulation of a high-frequency carrier wave such as an FM radio transmission.
* Radio frequency interference (RFI), from typically 20 kHz to an upper limit which constantly increases as technology pushes it higher. Sources include:
** Wireless and radio frequency transmissions
** Television and radio receivers
** Industrial, scientific and medical equipment (ISM)
** Digital processing circuitry such as microcontrollers
**Switched-mode power supplies (SMPS)
* Broadband noise may be spread across parts of either or both frequency ranges, with no particular frequency accentuated. Sources include:
** Solar activity
** Continuously operating spark gaps such as arc welders
** CDMA (spread-spectrum) mobile telephony

An electromagnetic pulse (EMP), sometimes called a transient disturbance, arises where the source emits a short-duration pulse of energy. The energy is usually broadband by nature, although it often excites a relatively narrow-band &quot;damped sine wave&quot; response in the victim.

Sources divide broadly into isolated and repetitive events.

Sources of isolated EMP events include:

* Switching action of electrical circuitry, including inductive loads such as relays, solenoids, or electric motors.
* Power line surges/pulses
* Electrostatic discharge (ESD), as a result of two charged objects coming into close proximity or contact.
* Lightning electromagnetic pulse (LEMP), although typically a short series of pulses.
* Nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP), as a result of a nuclear explosion. A variant of this is the high altitude EMP (HEMP) nuclear weapon, designed to create the pulse as its primary destructive effect.
* Non-nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NNEMP) weapons.

Sources of repetitive EMP events, sometimes as regular &quot;pulse trains&quot;, include:

* Electric motors
* Electrical ignition systems, such as in gasoline engines.
* Continual switching actions of digital electronic circuitry.

Conducted electromagnetic interference is caused by the physical contact of the conductors as opposed to radiated EMI, which is caused by induction (without physical contact of the conductors). Electromagnetic disturbances in the EM field of a conductor will no longer be confined to the surface of the conductor and will radiate away from it. This persists in all conductors and mutual inductance between two radiated electromagnetic fields will result in EMI.

=== Coupling mechanisms ===
Some of the technical terms which are employed can be used with differing meanings. Some phenomena may be referred to by various different terms. These terms are used here in a widely accepted way, which is consistent with other articles in the encyclopedia.

The basic arrangement of noise emitter or source, coupling path and victim, receptor or sink is shown in the figure below. Source and victim are usually electronic hardware devices, though the source may be a natural phenomenon such as a lightning strike, electrostatic discharge (ESD) or, in one famous case, the Big Bang at the origin of the Universe.

There are four basic coupling mechanisms: conductive, capacitive, magnetic or inductive, and radiative. Any coupling path can be broken down into one or more of these coupling mechanisms working together. For example the lower path in the diagram involves inductive, conductive and capacitive modes.

Conductive coupling occurs when the coupling path between the source and victim is formed by direct electrical contact with a conducting body, for example a transmission line, wire, cable, PCB trace or metal enclosure. Conducted noise is also characterised by the way it appears on different conductors:

* Common-mode coupling: noise appears in phase (in the same direction) on two conductors.
* Differential-mode coupling: noise appears out of phase (in opposite directions) on two conductors.

Inductive coupling occurs where the source and victim are separated by a short distance (typically less than a wavelength). Strictly, &quot;Inductive coupling&quot; can be of two kinds, electrical induction and magnetic induction. It is common to refer to electrical induction as &quot;capacitive coupling&quot;, and to magnetic induction as &quot;inductive coupling&quot;.

Capacitive coupling occurs when a varying electrical field exists between two adjacent conductors typically less than a wavelength apart, inducing a change in voltage on the receiving conductor.

Inductive coupling or magnetic coupling occurs when a varying magnetic field exists between two parallel conductors typically less than a wavelength apart, inducing a change in voltage along the receiving conductor.

Radiative coupling or electromagnetic coupling occurs when source and victim are separated by a large distance, typically more than a wavelength. Source and victim act as radio antennas: the source emits or radiates an electromagnetic wave which propagates across the space in between and is picked up or received by the victim.

==ITU definition==
Interference with the meaning of &quot;electromagnetic interference&quot;, also &quot;radio-frequency interference&quot; (&quot;EMI&quot; or &quot;RFI&quot;) is according to &quot;Article 1.166&quot; of the International Telecommunication Union″s (ITU) Radio Regulations (RR) defined as &quot;The effect of unwanted energy due to one or a combination of emissions, radiations, or inductions upon reception in a radiocommunication system, manifested by any performance degradation, misinterpretation, or loss of information which could be extracted in the absence of such unwanted energy&quot;.

This is also a definition used by the frequency administration to provide frequency assignments and assignment of frequency channels to radio stations or systems, as well as to analyze electromagnetic compatibility between radiocommunication services.

In accordance with ITU RR (article 1) variations of interference are classified as follows:
* permissible interference (RR 1.167)
* accepted interference (RR 1.168)
* harmful interference (RR 1.169)

==Conducted interference==

Conducted EMI is caused by the physical contact of the conductors as opposed to radiated EMI which is caused by induction (without physical contact of the conductors).

For lower frequencies, EMI is caused by conduction and, for higher frequencies, by radiation.

EMI through the ground wire is also very common in an electrical facility.

== Susceptibilities of different radio technologies ==

Interference tends to be more troublesome with older radio technologies such as analogue amplitude modulation, which have no way of distinguishing unwanted in-band signals from the intended signal, and the omnidirectional antennas used with broadcast systems. Newer radio systems incorporate several improvements that enhance the selectivity. In digital radio systems, such as Wi-Fi, error-correction techniques can be used. Spread-spectrum and frequency-hopping techniques can be used with both analogue and digital signalling to improve resistance to interference. A highly directional receiver, such as a parabolic antenna or a diversity receiver, can be used to select one signal in space to the exclusion of others.

The most extreme example of digital spread-spectrum signalling to date is ultra-wideband (UWB), which proposes the use of large sections of the radio spectrum at low amplitudes to transmit high-bandwidth digital data. UWB, if used exclusively, would enable very efficient use of the spectrum, but users of non-UWB technology are not yet prepared to share the spectrum with the new system because of the interference it would cause to their receivers (the regulatory implications of UWB are discussed in the ultra-wideband article).

== Interference to consumer devices ==
In the United States, the 1982 Public Law 97-259 allowed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the susceptibility of consumer electronic equipment.

Potential sources of RFI and EMI include: various types of transmitters, doorbell transformers, toaster ovens, electric blankets, ultrasonic pest control devices, electric bug zappers, heating pads, and touch controlled lamps. Multiple CRT computer monitors or televisions sitting too close to one another can sometimes cause a &quot;shimmy&quot; effect in each other, due to the electromagnetic nature of their picture tubes, especially when one of their de-gaussing coils is activated.

Electromagnetic interference at 2.4 GHz may be caused by 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n wireless devices, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors and cordless telephones, video senders, and microwave ovens.

Switching loads (inductive, capacitive, and resistive), such as electric motors, transformers, heaters, lamps, ballast, power supplies, etc., all cause electromagnetic interference especially at currents above 2 A. The usual method used for suppressing EMI is by connecting a snubber network, a resistor in series with a capacitor, across a pair of contacts. While this may offer modest EMI reduction at very low currents, snubbers do not work at currents over 2 A with electromechanical contacts.

Another method for suppressing EMI is the use of ferrite core noise suppressors (or ferrite beads), which are inexpensive and which clip on to the power lead of the offending device or the compromised device.

Switched-mode power supplies can be a source of EMI, but have become less of a problem as design techniques have improved, such as integrated power factor correction.

Most countries have legal requirements that mandate electromagnetic compatibility: electronic and electrical hardware must still work correctly when subjected to certain amounts of EMI, and should not emit EMI, which could interfere with other equipment (such as radios).

Radio frequency signal quality has declined throughout the 21st century by roughly one decibel per year as the spectrum becomes increasingly crowded. This has inflicted a Red Queen&#x27;s race on the mobile phone industry as companies have been forced to put up more cellular towers (at new frequencies) that then cause more interference thereby requiring more investment by the providers and frequent upgrades of mobile phones to match.

== Standards ==

The International Special Committee for Radio Interference or CISPR (French acronym for &quot;Comité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques&quot;), which is a committee of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) sets international standards for radiated and conducted electromagnetic interference. These are civilian standards for domestic, commercial, industrial and automotive sectors. These standards form the basis of other national or regional standards, most notably the European Norms (EN) written by CENELEC (European committee for electrotechnical standardisation). US organizations include the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the US Military (MILSTD).

== EMI in integrated circuits ==
Integrated circuits are often a source of EMI, but they must usually couple their energy to larger objects such as heatsinks, circuit board planes and cables to radiate significantly.

On integrated circuits, important means of reducing EMI are: the use of bypass or decoupling capacitors on each active device (connected across the power supply, as close to the device as possible), rise time control of high-speed signals using series resistors, and IC power supply pin filtering. Shielding is usually a last resort after other techniques have failed, because of the added expense of shielding components such as conductive gaskets.

The efficiency of the radiation depends on the height above the ground plane or power plane (at RF, one is as good as the other) and the length of the conductor in relation to the wavelength of the signal component (fundamental frequency, harmonic or transient such as overshoot, undershoot or ringing). At lower frequencies, such as 133 MHz, radiation is almost exclusively via I/O cables; RF noise gets onto the power planes and is coupled to the line drivers via the VCC and GND pins. The RF is then coupled to the cable through the line driver as common-mode noise. Since the noise is common-mode, shielding has very little effect, even with differential pairs. The RF energy is capacitively coupled from the signal pair to the shield and the shield itself does the radiating. One cure for this is to use a braid-breaker or choke to reduce the common-mode signal.

At higher frequencies, usually above 500 MHz, traces get electrically longer and higher above the plane. Two techniques are used at these frequencies: wave shaping with series resistors and embedding the traces between the two planes. If all these measures still leave too much EMI, shielding such as RF gaskets and copper or conductive tape can be used. Most digital equipment is designed with metal or conductive-coated plastic cases.

===RF immunity and testing===
Any unshielded semiconductor (e.g. an integrated circuit) will tend to act as a detector for those radio signals commonly found in the domestic environment (e.g. mobile phones). Such a detector can demodulate the high frequency mobile phone carrier (e.g., GSM850 and GSM1900, GSM900 and GSM1800) and produce low-frequency (e.g., 217 Hz) demodulated signals. This demodulation manifests itself as unwanted audible buzz in audio appliances such as microphone amplifier, speaker amplifier, car radio, telephones etc. Adding onboard EMI filters or special layout techniques can help in bypassing EMI or improving RF immunity.
Some ICs are designed (e.g., LMV831-LMV834, MAX9724) to have integrated RF filters or a special design that helps reduce any demodulation of high-frequency carrier.

Designers often need to carry out special tests for RF immunity of parts to be used in a system. These tests are often done in an anechoic chamber with a controlled RF environment where the test vectors produce a RF field similar to that produced in an actual environment.

== RFI in radio astronomy ==
Interference in radio astronomy, where it is commonly referred to as radio-frequency interference (RFI), is any source of transmission that is within the observed frequency band other than the celestial sources themselves. Because transmitters on and around the Earth can be many times stronger than the astronomical signal of interest, RFI is a major concern for performing radio astronomy. Natural sources of interference, such as lightning and the Sun, are also often referred to as RFI.

Some of the frequency bands that are very important for radio astronomy, such as the 21-cm HI line at 1420 MHz, are protected by regulation. However, modern radio-astronomical observatories such as VLA, LOFAR, and ALMA have a very large bandwidth over which they can observe. Because of the limited spectral space at radio frequencies, these frequency bands cannot be completely allocated to radio astronomy; for example, redshifted images of the 21-cm line from the reionization epoch can overlap with the FM broadcast band (88–108 MHz), and therefore radio telescopes need to deal with RFI in this bandwidth.

Techniques to deal with RFI range from filters in hardware to advanced algorithms in software. One way to deal with strong transmitters is to filter out the frequency of the source completely. This is for example the case for the LOFAR observatory, which filters out the FM radio stations between 90 and 110 MHz. It is important to remove such strong sources of interference as soon as possible, because they might &quot;saturate&quot; the highly sensitive receivers (amplifiers and analogue-to-digital converters), which means that the received signal is stronger than the receiver can handle. However, filtering out a frequency band implies that these frequencies can never be observed with the instrument.

A common technique to deal with RFI within the observed frequency bandwidth, is to employ RFI detection in software. Such software can find samples in time, frequency or time-frequency space that are contaminated by an interfering source. These samples are subsequently ignored in further analysis of the observed data. This process is often referred to as &quot;data flagging&quot;. Because most transmitters have a small bandwidth and are not continuously present such as lightning or citizens&#x27; band (CB) radio devices, most of the data remains available for the astronomical analysis. However, data flagging can not solve issues with continuous broad-band transmitters, such as windmills, digital video or digital audio transmitters.

Another way to manage RFI is to establish a radio quiet zone (RQZ). RQZ is a well-defined area surrounding receivers that has special regulations to reduce RFI in favor of radio astronomy observations within the zone. The regulations may include special management of spectrum and power flux or power flux-density limitations. The controls within the zone may cover elements other than radio transmitters or radio devices. These include aircraft controls and control of unintentional radiators such as industrial, scientific and medical devices, vehicles, and power lines. The first RQZ for radio astronomy is United States National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ), established in 1958.

== RFI on environmental monitoring ==
Prior to the introduction of Wi-Fi, one of the biggest applications of 5 GHz band was the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar. The decision to use 5 GHz spectrum for Wi-Fi was finalized at the World Radiocommunication Conference in 2003; however, meteorological authorities were not involved in the process. The subsequent lax implementation and misconfiguration of DFS had caused significant disruption in weather radar operations in a number of countries around the world. In Hungary, the weather radar system was declared non-operational for more than a month. Due to the severity of interference, South African weather services ended up abandoning C band operation, switching their radar network to S band.

Transmissions on adjacent bands to those used by passive remote sensing, such as weather satellites, have caused interference, sometimes significant. There is concern that adoption of insufficiently regulated 5G could produce major interference issues. Significant interference can impair numerical weather prediction performance and incur negative economic and public safety impacts. These concerns led US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in February 2019 to urge the FCC to cancel a proposed spectrum auction, which was rejected.

<doc id="1072325" wikidata="Q5691670" url="?curid=1072325" title="Hearing the shape of a drum">
<text>To hear the shape of a drum is to infer information about the shape of the drumhead from the sound it makes, i.e., from the list of overtones, via the use of mathematical theory.

&quot;Can One Hear the Shape of a Drum?&quot; is the title of a 1966 article by Mark Kac in the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; which made the question famous, though this particular phrasing originates with Lipman Bers. Similar questions can be traced back all the way to physicist Arthur Schuster in 1882. For his paper, Kac was given the Lester R. Ford Award in 1967 and the Chauvenet Prize in 1968.

The frequencies at which a drumhead can vibrate depend on its shape. The Helmholtz equation calculates the frequencies if the shape is known. These frequencies are the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in the space. A central question is whether the shape can be predicted if the frequencies are known; for example, whether a Reuleaux triangle can be recognized in this way. Kac admitted that he did not know whether it was possible for two different shapes to yield the same set of frequencies. The question of whether the frequencies determine the shape was finally answered in the negative in the early 1990s by Carolyn S. Gordon, David Webb and Scott A. Wolpert.

==Formal statement==

More formally, the drum is conceived as an elastic membrane whose boundary is clamped. It is represented as a domain &quot;D&quot; in the plane. Denote by &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot; the Dirichlet eigenvalues for &quot;D&quot;: that is, the eigenvalues of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian:

:formula_1

Two domains are said to be isospectral (or homophonic) if they have the same eigenvalues. The term &quot;homophonic&quot; is justified because the Dirichlet eigenvalues are precisely the fundamental tones that the drum is capable of producing: they appear naturally as Fourier coefficients in the solution wave equation with clamped boundary.

Therefore, the question may be reformulated as: what can be inferred on &quot;D&quot; if one knows only the values of &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot;? Or, more specifically: are there two distinct domains that are isospectral?

Related problems can be formulated for the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian on domains in higher dimensions or on Riemannian manifolds, as well as for other elliptic differential operators such as the Cauchy–Riemann operator or Dirac operator. Other boundary conditions besides the Dirichlet condition, such as the Neumann boundary condition, can be imposed. See spectral geometry and isospectral as related articles.

==The answer==

In 1964, John Milnor observed that a theorem on lattices due to Ernst Witt implied the existence of a pair of 16-dimensional flat tori that have the same eigenvalues but different shapes. However, the problem in two dimensions remained open until 1992, when Carolyn Gordon, David Webb, and Scott Wolpert constructed, based on the Sunada method, a pair of regions in the plane that have different shapes but identical eigenvalues. The regions are concave polygons. The proof that both regions have the same eigenvalues uses the symmetries of the Laplacian. This idea has been generalized by Buser, Conway, Doyle, and Semmler who constructed numerous similar examples. So, the answer to Kac&#x27;s question is: for many shapes, one cannot hear the shape of the drum &quot;completely&quot;. However, some information can be inferred.

On the other hand, Steve Zelditch proved that the answer to Kac&#x27;s question is positive if one imposes restrictions to certain convex planar regions with analytic boundary. It is not known whether two non-convex analytic domains can have the same eigenvalues. It is known that the set of domains isospectral with a given one is compact in the C∞ topology. Moreover, the sphere (for instance) is spectrally rigid, by Cheng&#x27;s eigenvalue comparison theorem. It is also known, by a result of Osgood, Phillips, and Sarnak that the moduli space of Riemann surfaces of a given genus does not admit a continuous isospectral flow through any point, and is compact in the Fréchet–Schwartz topology.

==Weyl&#x27;s formula==

Weyl&#x27;s formula states that one can infer the area &quot;A&quot; of the drum by counting how rapidly the &quot;λ&quot;&quot;n&quot; grow. We define &quot;N&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) to be the number of eigenvalues smaller than &quot;R&quot; and we get

: formula_2

where &quot;d&quot; is the dimension, and formula_3 is the volume of the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional unit ball. Weyl also conjectured that the next term in the approximation below would give the perimeter of &quot;D&quot;. In other words, if &quot;L&quot; denotes the length of the perimeter (or the surface area in higher dimension), then one should have

: formula_4

For a smooth boundary, this was proved by Victor Ivrii in 1980. The manifold is also not allowed to have a two-parameter family of periodic geodesics, such as a sphere would have.

==The Weyl–Berry conjecture==
For non-smooth boundaries, Michael Berry conjectured in 1979 that the correction should be of the order of

: formula_5

where &quot;D&quot; is the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary. This was disproved by J. Brossard and R. A. Carmona, who then suggested that one should replace the Hausdorff dimension with the upper box dimension. In the plane, this was proved if the boundary has dimension 1 (1993), but mostly disproved for higher dimensions (1996); both results are by Lapidus and Pomerance.

<doc id="1072327" wikidata="Q910491" url="?curid=1072327" title="Lawrence, New Zealand">
<text>Lawrence is a small town in Otago, in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. It is located on State Highway 8, the main route from Dunedin to the inland towns of Queenstown and Alexandra. It lies 35 kilometres to the northwest of Milton, 11 kilometres northwest of Waitahuna, and close to the Tuapeka River, a tributary of the Clutha.

== History ==
The discovery of gold at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully by Gabriel Read in May 1861 led to the Otago gold rush with the population of the gold field rising from almost nothing to around 11,500 within a year, twice that of Dunedin at the time. Gabriel’s Gully was quickly dotted with tents and workings, stores and government “buildings”.

By December 1861, there were some 14,000 people on the Tuapeka goldfield and it continued to climb and by February 1864 was around 24,000. Around a third of these miners were English, a significant proportion were Irish, while some were European, with others of Chinese origin. The ground under the makeshift township site, was also gold rich. Gradually, the commercial and administrative services for the what became known as the Tuapeka fields were concentrated on non-gold bearing ground away at the entrance to the Gully. 
A new town was surveyed in 1862 by Robert Grigor and named Tuapeka with sections in the town auctioned on 5 November 1862. By 1864 most people had shifted from the canvas town across the stream to which quickly became the focal point for Otago&#x27;s goldfield with a bank, hotels, ironmongers, drapers, a watchmaker, bookmaker, newsagent, and various other stores. The town became a municipality in 1866 and was renamed Lawrence in honour of Sir Henry Lawrence, hero of the Lucknow military campaign of 1857. 
The development of large scale sluicing in the area in the 1870s caused flooding of the low lying areas of the town, which forced government buildings, churches and schools to relocate up the hill to Colonsay Street, while Peel Street became the business street.
In mid-1862, it is estimated that twice as many people lived around the banks of the Tuapeka River as did in Dunedin itself. By 1870 the settlement of Chinese miners just outside the town had 300 residents. 
The Black Horse Brewery, was established in the town in 1866. It closed in 1923.
The tune to New Zealand&#x27;s national anthem was composed in Lawrence by John J. Woods, a Lawrence school teacher.
In 1877, a branch line railway was built from the Main South Line to Lawrence, and the town remained the terminus of the line until an extension was built in 1910. Although originally known as the Lawrence Branch, this line ultimately became known as the Roxburgh Branch. The railway closed in 1968 and the town&#x27;s station has subsequently been demolished, but some relics still remain, including the goods shed.

In 1978, two lions named Sultan and Sonia escaped from a circus in Lawrence. The circus&#x27; tranquilliser guns had accidentally been left behind in another town so they could not be shot with tranquillizer darts. They were eventually shot by police but not before one of them had scratched a seven-year-old boy across the face. The lions were stuffed and are now on display at Otago Museum.

In 2011, Lawrence became the first town in New Zealand to offer town-wide free Wi-Fi internet.

The Lawrence Rugby Football Club is based in the township.

Lawrence&#x27;s sister city is Jacksonville, Oregon.

Tuapeka, which also includes Beaumont and Waitahuna, covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Tuapeka had a population of 1,155 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 78 people (7.2%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 24 people (−2.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 513 households, comprising 576 males and 576 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.0 males per female. The median age was 46.6 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 219 people (19.0%) aged under 15 years, 129 (11.2%) aged 15 to 29, 588 (50.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 219 (19.0%) aged 65 or older.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 474 (50.6%) people were employed full-time, 177 (18.9%) were part-time, and 21 (2.2%) were unemployed.

== Attractions / Amenities ==
=== Holy Trinity Anglican church ===
Moves to establish the first Anglican Church in Lawrence were made in December 1866, but it was not until February 1868 that the first clergyman Rev. H.W. Martin from Victoria, Australia, was appointed.
Initially the Anglicans held their services in the Methodist Church before constructing the original church at 9 Whitehaven Street constructed of timber, plainly-detailed, with Gothic elements complete with a small belfry at the gable end. It was opened by Bishop-Elect Samuel Nevill in May 1871. The first permanent vicar was the Reverend George P. Beaumont who had arrived in the district in 1870 and remained in that role for another 30 years.
A freestanding wooden Gothic-styled belltower was built in the late 1890s beside the church. It was retained when the original church was demolished to make way for the current brick church, which was designed by Invercargill based architect E. R. Wilson.

Its foundation stone was laid in March 1925 and it was consecrated in August of that same year by Bishop Isaac Richards, a previous vicar of the parish.
The belltower was restored and rededicated by Bishop Peter Mann in June 1980. It was granted Heritage New Zealand historic place category 2 status in 2005.

The regular congregation was down to less than 10 people, by the time the church held its last service in January 2015. With a ratable value of $90,000 it was sold in 2016 for use as a holiday home.

=== Lawrence Methodist church ===
The first services for Methodists in the district were provided by the Reverend Isaac Harding of Dunedin towards the end of 1862 in two canvas churches, one in Munro’s Gully, and another in Gabriel’s Gully. Eventually these were replaced by a permanent church at Gabriel’s Gully in 1870.
In Lawrence itself a Methodist church was constructed of brick on Colonsay Street and opened free of debt in 1865. Unfortunately it was then discovered that due to a surveying error part of the building had been constructed on Catholic land. It was used for eight years and then pulled down. Meanwhile a new site was obtained on the corner of Whitehaven Street, where a by wooden church which cost £320 was constructed. It was officially opened on 14 September 1873, by the Rev. C. W. Rigg.

=== Lawrence Presbyterian church ===
The first Presbyterian services were held in the district in open air at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully in July 1861 by layman John Gillies. By 1864 with the support of local congregation and the organisation of a soiree, enough money (including a donation of £50 from Gabriel Read) was raised to allow for the erection of a wooden church building at 7 Colonsay Street. The church&#x27;s first permanent minister was the Reverend Dr James Copland.

By the mid-1880s it was decided to replace the existing church with a new church on the same section of land. The new building which was opened in September 1886 by D. M. Stuart of Knox Church in Dunedin was designed by Dunedin architect R.A. Lawson. The original church building remained on site and was used as a Sunday School. The new church was constructed of red brick on stone foundations and featured crenellations above the entrance. It was the first church in Otago to have an organ. Up until then a precentor had been used to lead the congregation. Over time the brick exterior was plastered, the spire and pinnacles were removed and a shorter belfry created.

Due to a declining congregation the church was sold around 1994 to a private owner who intended to use it as a holiday home.

In 1998 a fire started by an arson attack severely damaged the building. The building languished for a period, with much local concern expressed about its condition. In 2002 the building was purchased by Jo and Mike Romanes bought the church in 2002, who then spent the next six years, stabilizing the building, installing a new roof and floor before converting it into boutique accommodation.

The building was granted Heritage New Zealand historic place category 2 status in 2004.

=== St Patrick’s Church (Roman Catholic)===
While Otago was established as a Presbyterian settlement the discovery of gold, resulted in miners of all nationalities and creeds emigrating to the province, among them a large number of Irish Catholics.
To service their spiritual need, Father Delphin Moreau began visiting the goldfields from Dunedin, from the first weeks of the gold rush. Up until Cobb &amp; Co’s established their coach service to the goldfields in October 1861 Moreau’s made his visits to Tuapeka on foot, holding Mass there once a month. By 1862 he was travelling to and holding Mass every alternate Sunday in a tent in Gabriel’s Gully. In October 1863 a section on the corner of Colonsay and Lancaster Streets house a church and school was donated by local businessman John Donovan. In 1864 Father Joseph Eccuyer was made the first priest permanently resident in Lawrence. A corrugated iron church named St Gabriel’s was erected on the site and blessed in November 1864 by Bishop Viard. It was the first Catholic church in Otago.

By the end of May 1871 Father William Larkin had been appointed Parish priest to Tuapeka and he was able to organize the construction of the large wooden Gothic church-school of St Patrick’s which opened on 17 March 1872, across the road from the now superseded St Gabriel’s. During Larkin’s tenure calls intensified for a separate church, distinct from St Patrick’s as it was felt that the existing building was essentially a school rather than a church.
A building fund for a new church was initiated in 1880 and noted architect, Francis Petre, was selected to design the church, issuing tenders for its construction in November 1890 on the site of the former St Gabriels on the corner of 12 Colonsay Street and Lancaster Street. The contract was awarded on 7 December 1890 to Dunedin based Daniel W. Woods, who had submitted a price of £3000.

By the time the foundation stone was laid by Bishop Patrick Moran on 17 March 1891 the walls were at almost at their full height. The completed brick Gothic church with a belfry of Oamaru stone with seating for about 600 worshippers was officially opened by Bishop Moran on 6 January 1892. The six bay nave of the brick church is long by wide while the transept was long by wide.
A convent for the Dominican nuns, was later constructed directly to the south of the Church and opened on Sunday 3 February 1893. In 1902, a Presbytery was constructed to the east, adjacent to the church.
To protect the decaying bricks and mortar the church was roughcast in 1926. By the 1990s the church needed significant repairs, which were undertaken in 1995. 
The Presbytery is still owned by the Church, but is now rental accommodation.

<doc id="1072340" wikidata="Q1678499" url="?curid=1072340" title="Wildflower Triathlon">
<text>The Wildflower Triathlon was a triathlon (swim-bike-run race) held at Lake San Antonio in Central California from 1983 to 2019, the first winner being Dean &quot;The Machine&quot; Harper. It was held the first weekend in May each year.

The original course was expanded to the standardized half-Ironman distance (1.2 mi / 56 mi / 13.1 mi) in the late 1980s, and was often referred to as simply the &quot;long course&quot;. Two more races were subsequently been added to the event: an Olympic-distance (1.5 km / 40 km / 10 km) race and a short or &quot;sprint&quot; mountain-bike triathlon (0.25 mi / 9.7 mi / 2 mi).

Known for a particularly hilly and grueling course, it was one of the largest triathlon events in the world, with 7,500 athletes and 30,000 spectators attending each year at its peak. Traditionally it was associated with a Wildflower festival, though in later years the festival had been eclipsed by the increasingly large athletic event. A drastic drop in lake level in 2014 led to a modified course and lower attendance. Shortly after the 2015 event, the Monterey County Board of Supervisors announced it would close Lake San Antonio due to low water levels. The event was canceled in 2017 and 2019. It was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2023 it was announced that a new triathlon not associated with the previous Wildflower Triathlon would be held at the site. Wildflower organizers have announced their plans to bring back the race in May 2025.

==Events==

===Long course===

====Distances====
1.2 m Swim, 56 m Bike, 13.1 m Run

====Swim course====
The swim course began at the Lynch Ramp. The race started in waves, with the professional men, the professional women, age group men, age group women, and relay teams. Swimmers swam in a clockwise direction on a rectangular course. There were course marker buoys and lifeguards on kayaks lining the course. Swimmers exited the water, went up the ramp, through the timing area and into the transition area.

====Bike course====
The course was long and was considered relatively difficult. Triathletes left the transition area to the north and made a quick left through the finish line chute. Athletes followed the road down Shoreline Drive to the beach area and as it turned right up &quot;Beach Hill&quot;, a steep climb. The course proceeded onto San Antonio Drive and out of the park onto Interlake Road past the first checkpoint at mile six. Bicyclists would proceed on Interlake Road over rolling hills before turning onto Jolon Road (19 miles). Triathletes would have small rolling hills along Jolon Road from mile 26 to 42. At mile 42, they followed Nacimiento left up &quot;Nasty Grade&quot;, a nearly five-mile grade which climbs from bottom to top of &quot;Heart Rate Hill.&quot; At the top of the hill they went back onto Interlake Road and then at the point made a right turn onto San Antonio Drive and headed back to the park. Finally, they descended Lynch Hill for the last descent.

====Run course====
The run course was 60% trails and 40% roads. Triathletes would depart the transition area to the southwest and climb the Lynch Ramp stairs. Once on the trail below the resort store lawn athletes crossed the bridge and proceed down the beach access road through &quot;Beach City.&quot; At the base of &quot;Beach Hill&quot; athletes continued straight off of the road and on to the trails along the shoreline until the Harris Creek campgrounds. After this, they followed the paved road as it turned right past the launch ramp for a short climb up the hill. At mile 3 they turned left onto the backcountry trails. The trail followed the creek to Long Valley with two steep hills to climb out the other side at . Triathletes proceeded back into the park alongside the road on trails and fire roads through Redondo Vista Campgrounds, the TNT campsite area, and the overflow camping area. At mile 9, the course returned to the roads, making a right turn at San Antonio Drive. Triathletes proceeded up the road and down the hill to the PowerBar turn-around point and at mile 10, then ran back up the hill and proceeded back on San Antonio Drive. Finally, athletes headed down Lynch Hill towards the finish chute and finish line.

===Olympic Distance===

====Distances====
1.5k Swim, 40k Bike, 10k Run

====Swim course====
The 1.5k (.93 mile) swim course began at the Lynch Ramp. There were more than 20 wave starts at 5-minute intervals beginning with collegiate men and women, age group men and women, Team in Training men and women, and relay teams. Swimmers would swim in a clockwise direction on the triangular course. The course would have sailboats, clearly marked, at the corners and there would be course marker buoys and lifeguards on long boards every 100 yards. The swimmers would exit the water, go through the timing area, up the ramp and into the transition area.

====Bike course====
The bike course was 40K (24.8 miles) long and was considered relatively difficult. Cyclist would leave the transition area to the north and proceed directly up &quot;Lynch Hill.&quot; On San Antonio Drive athletes headed out of the park and onto Interlake Road. On Interlake Road, triathletes proceeded over rolling hills to the turn-around point at mile 12.4. Triathletes would return to the park on the same roads. As they re-entered the park, riders turned left and headed down Lynch Hill and back to the transition area.

====Run course====
The 10k (6.2 mile) run course was a combination of road and trails through campgrounds and challenging hills. Triathletes would depart the transition area to the southwest, and climb the Lynch Ramp stairs. Then they turned left on the trail below the resort store lawn. They crossed the bridge and proceeded down the beach access road through &quot;Beach City.&quot; At the base of &quot;Beach Hill,&quot; they continued straight off of the road and on to the trails along the shoreline. They followed the trails through Harris Creek campgrounds, and proceeded past the launch ramp parking lot and onto Lake San Antonio Drive. They turned right up San Antonio Drive and at the Beach Hill intersection triathletes left the road for trails and followed the fire access trail back to Lynch intersection. Finally, triathletes returned to the road and turned right down Lynch Hill to the finish chute and the finish line.

===Mountain Bike Sprint Triathlon===

====Distances====
0.25m Swim, 9.7m Bike, 2 mi Run.

===Sprint Distance Triathlon===

====Distances====
0.25 Swim, 20k Bike, 5k Run.

In 2018, Wildflower added trail run events at 5K and 10K distances.

===Stand-Up Paddleboard===
Added to the event for 2018, Wildflower featured stand-up paddleboarding events as an alternative to the original long-run, Olympic, and sprint distance events.

====Distances====
2 &amp; 6 miles.

==Course closures==
The AVIA Wildflower Triathlons Festival established course closures for each portion of the triathlon. These closures were based upon the start time of the last individual age group wave and were for the safety of participants and volunteers.

*Run: 5:25 PM (male), 5:45 PM (female) (8:20 after the start of the last individual age group wave)

====Olympic course====

*Swim: 11:20 AM (male), 12:05 PM (female) (1:20 after the start of the last individual age group wave)
*Bike: 1:50 PM (male), 2:35 PM (female) (3:50 after the start of the last individual age group wave)
*Run: 3:20 PM (male), 4:05 PM (female) (5:20 after the start of the last individual age group wave)

====Mountain bike course====

There were no course closures for the mountain bike event.

== Course records ==
The current course records are held by Terenzo Bozzone and Heather Jackson. In 2006, Bozzone completed the half-Ironman distance in 3 hours, 53 minutes and 43 seconds, while Jackson posted a time of 4 hours, 26 minutes and 29 seconds in 2012.

==Corporate sponsorship==
The triathlon is owned and operated by See &amp; Be Productions. It was previously sponsored by Avia and was known as the &quot;Avia Wildflower Triathlons&quot; until 2013. Jamba Juice was also a title sponsor of the event in the early 2000&#x27;s.

<text>Place and route (also called PnR or P&amp;R) is a stage in the design of printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, and field-programmable gate arrays. As implied by the name, it is composed of two steps, placement and routing. The first step, placement, involves deciding where to place all electronic components, circuitry, and logic elements in a generally limited amount of space. This is followed by routing, which decides the exact design of all the wires needed to connect the placed components. This step must implement all the desired connections while following the rules and limitations of the manufacturing process.

Place and route is used in several contexts:
* Printed circuit boards, during which components are graphically placed on the board and the wires drawn between them
* Integrated circuits, during which a layout of a larger block of the circuit or the whole circuit is created from layouts of smaller sub-blocks
* FPGAs, during which logic elements are placed and interconnected on the grid of the FPGA

These processes are similar at a high level, but the actual details are very different. With the large sizes of modern designs, this operation is usually performed by electronic design automation (EDA) tools.

In all these contexts, the final result when placing and routing is finished is the &quot;layout&quot;, a geometric description of the location and rotation of each part, and the exact path of each wire connecting them.

Occasionally some people call the entire place-and-route process &quot;layout&quot;.

==Printed circuit board==
The design of a printed circuit board comes after the creation of a schematic and generation of a netlist. The generated netlist is then read into a layout tool and associated with the footprints of the devices from a library. Placing and routing the devices can now start.

Placing and routing is generally done in two steps. Placing the components comes first, then routing the connections between the components. The placement of components is not absolute during the routing phase, as it may still be changed by moving and rotating, especially with designs using more complex components such as FPGAs or microprocessors. Their large number of signals, and their signal integrity needs may require optimization of the placement.

The resulting design is then output in RS-274X Gerber format to load in the computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system of the manufacturer. In contrast to an IC layout, where the entire finished layout is stored in one graphics file, different files and formats are needed for PCB manufacture. The fabrication data consists of a set of Gerber files, a drill file, and a pick-and-place file containing the location and alignment of the devices generated for automated placement of the devices in the assembly process.

==Field-programmable gate array==
The process of placing and routing for an FPGA is generally not performed by a person, but uses a tool provided by the FPGA Vendor or another software manufacturer. The need for software tools is because of the complexity of the circuitry within the FPGA and the function the designer wishes to perform. FPGA designs are described using logic diagrams containing digital logic and hardware description languages such as VHDL and Verilog. These will then be put through an automated place-and-route procedure to generate a pinout, which will be used to interface with the parts outside of the FPGA.

==Integrated circuits==
The IC place-and-route stage typically starts with one or more schematics, HDL files, or pre-routed IP cores, or some combination of all three. It produces an IC layout that is automatically converted to a mask work in the standard GDS II or the OASIS format.

== History ==
The final layout of early ICs and PCBs was stored as a tape-out of Rubylith on transparent film.

Gradually, electronic design automation automated more and more of the place-and-route work. At first, it merely sped up the process of making many small edits without spending a lot of time peeling up and sticking down the tape. Later design rule checking sped up the process of checking for the most common sorts of errors. Later auto routers speed up the process of routing.

Some people hope that further improvements in autoplacers and autorouters will eventually produce good layouts without any human manual intervention. Further automation leads to the idea of a silicon compiler.

<text>Planet Hollywood International Inc. (stylized as planet Hollywood, planet Hollywood observatory and ph) is a themed restaurant chain inspired by the popular portrayal of Hollywood. The company is owned by Earl Enterprises corporation. Earl Enterprises was founded by Robert Earl.

It was launched in New York City on October 22, 1991, with the backing of Hollywood stars Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actors recruited were paid for their appearances and endorsements through an employee stock ownership plan. Further celebrity endorsement included actors Whoopi Goldberg, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Don Johnson, Cindy Crawford, Melanie Griffith, Tom Arnold, Wesley Snipes, and Danny Glover; director John Hughes; and comedian Roseanne Barr.

At its &#x27;90s peak, Planet Hollywood operated more than 60 worldwide locations. After financial problems, the company filed for bankruptcy in October 1999. Restructuring plan left the company with 35 locations in 2001 and their numbers continued to decline. As of November 2024, there are three restaurants and four hotels operating.

==Background==
Robert Earl had a history of opening theme-restaurants first in Britain (1970s) and in Orlando, Florida. In 1987, he sold this restaurant group (President Entertainments; 70 restaurants) to a larger company, Pleasurama PLC. For Pleasurama, Earl acquired control of Hard Rock Cafe International (eastern rights company) from co-founder Isaac Tigrett then in 1989 named as chief executive of the company. At the end of 1989, Mecca Leisure acquired Pleasurama. Mecca was then purchased by the Rank Organisation in 1990. While expanding Hard Rock Cafe from seven to 20 locations over the next two years, Earl met Bryan Kestner, with whom he had a shared vision of music, movies, and sports transcending language and other barriers.

==History==
Planet Hollywood was opened in late 1991 in New York City, at the base of two adjacent office buildings at 130 and 140 West 57th Street. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg were some of the actors who became investors/promoters. By the next year, three more locations were opened: London, southern California, and Chicago. In 1993, the company opened two new locations, Washington, D.C., and Cancun, Mexico, while arranging leases for five new locations. Each new unit, opening with a gala event, generated nearly $15 million revenue in their first operational year.

With its success, the company continued its aggressive expansion plan in 1994 while turning its attention to developing more theme-restaurant concepts, one of which was the Official All Star Café, a sports version of Planet Hollywood. Given permission, they started recruiting professional sports figures and planning its stadium and home cuisine menu and planning its merchandise.

The brand&#x27;s highest-grossing location unit was opened in Las Vegas in 1994 with double the usual seating to 500. This was followed later in the year by another 500-seater at Walt Disney World.

With expansion operating smoothly, Earl started working on other area of growth in 1995. Construction on the All Star Café&#x27;s first location in New York City began in August 1995 near the Planet Hollywood and opened on December 18, 1995. Development was started on a Marvel Comics-based restaurant concept and on a &quot;Planet Hollywood Squares&quot; television game show with King World and Roseanne Barr&#x27;s production company based on the Hollywood Squares. With the success of the merchandise, stand alone retail stores, Planet Hollywood Superstores were opened around 1996.

===Public corporation===
As of the May 1998 IPO circular, the celebrities were only minor holders of stock with Earl and Barish owning 57.2 percent and a 24.2 percent stake owned by Ong Beng Seng. In April 1996, Planet Hollywood went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $18 a share. The company&#x27;s share price reached an all-time high of $32 on the first day of trading; by 1999, it was down to less than $1. The company has gone bankrupt twice. In addition to going public, the company had MBNA issue Planet Hollywood VISA credit cards that gave cardholders priority restaurant seating. Planet Hollywood International and ITT Corporation formed a joint venture for Planet Hollywood casinos. The corporation and Marvel Entertainment Group agreed to launch the Marvel Mania comic book character-based restaurant concept. The company also had started to develop Chefs of the World concept, which would feature a &quot;&#x27;star-studded&#x27; culinary staff&quot;.

The company planned to expand by 30 to 40 percent each year in annual revenue and the number of restaurant locations. Additional competitors also started up, including Country Star chain, Harley-Davidson Café, Robert De Niro&#x27;s Tribeca Grill and Thunder Roadhouse. Some speculated that the company had thinned its resources too much, and, with the trend of novelty location visits dropping, store revenue would continue to drop.

In September 1997, Planet Hollywood International Inc. announced its Cool Planet Cafe ice-cream shop chain which would open 10 locations in 1998. ITT Corporation and Planet Hollywood were in discussion early September 1997 for a Planet Hollywood hotel near Times Square. The corporation then formed on September 24, 1997, a joint venture for an Official All Star Hotel.

In the fourth quarter of 1997, the company recorded a $40 million loss. Too much focus on diversification showed that the original chain was neglected with mediocre food, high menu prices and below average service. In early November 1998, Barish resigned as board chairman while retaining his board director post and filing to sell some of his company&#x27;s stock. Earl replaced him as chairman. Barish was replaced by William Baumhauer as president. The franchise in Cape Town, South Africa, had a bomb attack in August 1998. $244 million in losses were recorded in 1998.

The first Marvel Mania opened in January 1998 near Universal Studios Hollywood. With MTV Networks, Planet Hollywood opened its first Sound Republic in London in mid-1998. In July 1999, the company started its Planet Movies by AMC. In August 1998, the first Cool Planet Cafe opened in Santa Monica, California.

In March 1999, Barish resigned as board director and sold shares that week. At a May 1999, shareholder&#x27;s annual meeting, the company indicated that a delayed-payment agreement was in negotiation and that they were renovating some and are considering closing other outlets.

Causing little change on the company&#x27;s net profit/loss line, Baumhauer resigned in June 1999, with the company having $359 million in debt on the books to return to his previous employer, Unique Casual Restaurants. By July 1999, Planet Hollywood had sold its Orlando HQ for cash and leased it back for 15 years. On October 12, 1999, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in an attempt to reorganize. They closed or sold poorly performing Planet Hollywood restaurants and Official All Star Cafes. It moved to focus to its original theme concept, stopping operation of Planet Movies by AMC and sold its Sound Republic units.

Schwarzenegger severed his financial ties with the business in January 2000. Planet Hollywood exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 9, 2000, with the approval of its reorganization plan. New celebrities were sought out for their restaurants while renewing relationships with early recruits. The plan included capital and debt restructuring including a cash infusion plus new products and improvements to decor and the menu. Planet&#x27;s first website was launched with entertainment news and chat rooms. Earl, Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal and Ong Beng Seng had led restructuring plan which left the company with 35 locations, 25 of which were franchised.
Barred due to its bankruptcy, Planet Hollywood International had relisted in May 2000 on the NASDAQ.
In September 2000, the Official All Star Cafe in Times Square was closed with the Planet Hollywood taking over its 600-seat location. While this All Star location was profitable, Planet Hollywood was more profitable. The company was also coming out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

In October 2001, Planet Hollywood International filed again for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Blaming the economic slowdown from the September 11 attacks, the company had $135 million in debt.

In July 2010, Earl hired a CEO and president, David Crabtree, for Planet Hollywood and its parent company from Westgate Resorts. Planet Hollywood Resorts International, LLC signed on Wyndham Hotel Group to develop franchises for Planet Hollywood Resorts in September 2010.

In April 2022, Planet Hollywood announced plans to offer more than 60,000 of its memorabilia, including photographs and movie posters, as NFTs under MetaHollywood.

In May 2023, the Planet Hollywood Restaurant located in the Forum Shops at Caesars, was permanently closed. The restaurant had been located at the Forum Shops for 29 years. Planet Hollywood opened its original Forum Shops location in July 1994, and subsequently moved to the Forum Shops’ third floor terrace level in 2012. The Cafe Hollywood at Planet Hollywood hotel-casino remains open. 

===Buca di Beppo===
In September 2008, Planet Hollywood International Inc. acquired Buca, Inc., the owner of the Buca di Beppo national restaurant chain.

In August 1998, the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town, South Africa, was the target of a terrorist bombing killing two people. The perpetrators of the bombing stated it was in retaliation for American air-raids conducted in Sudan and Afghanistan.

<doc id="1072372" wikidata="Q1477295" url="?curid=1072372" title="Remote access service">
<text>A remote access service (RAS) is any combination of hardware and software to enable the remote access tools or information that typically reside on a network of IT devices.

A remote access service connects a client to a host computer, known as a remote access server. The most common approach to this service is remote control of a computer by using another device which needs internet or any other network connection.

The connection steps: User dials into a PC at the office. Then the office PC logs into a file server where the needed information is stored. The remote PC takes control of the office PC&#x27;s monitor and keyboard, allowing the remote user to view and manipulate information, execute commands, and exchange files.

Many computer manufacturers and large businesses&#x27; help desks use this service widely for technical troubleshooting of their customers&#x27; problems. Therefore you can find various professional first-party, third-party, open source, and freeware remote desktop applications. Which some of those are cross-platform across various versions of Windows, macOS, UNIX, and Linux. Remote desktop programs may include LogMeIn or TeamViewer. 

To use RAS from a remote node, a RAS client program is needed, or any PPP client software. Most remote control programs work with RAS. PPP is a set of industry standard framing and authentication protocols that enable remote access.

Microsoft Remote Access Server (RAS) is the predecessor to Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Server (RRAS). RRAS is a Microsoft Windows Server feature that allows Microsoft Windows clients to remotely access a Microsoft Windows network.

== History ==
The term was originally coined by Microsoft when referring to their built-in Windows NT remote access tools. RAS is a service provided by Windows NT which allows most of the services which would be available on a network to be accessed over a modem link. The service includes support for dialup and logon, presents the same network interface as the normal network drivers (albeit slightly slower). RAS works with several major network protocols, including TCP/IP, IPX, and NBF. It is not necessary to run Windows NT on the client—there are client versions for other Windows operating systems. RAS enables users to log into an NT-based LAN using a modem, X.25 connection or WAN link.

Starting in the mid-1990s, several manufacturers such as U.S. Robotics produced &quot;modem terminal servers&quot;. Instead of having RS-232 ports, these would directly incorporate an analog modem. These devices were commonly used by Internet service providers to allow consumer dial-up. Modern versions interface to an ISDN PRI instead of having analog modem ports.

Remote access services are now commonly used for online technical support for personal computers. The first instance of this was in 1987 in the United Kingdom, provided by a company called Jade Technologies. This used the MS-DOS based program called PC Anywhere to directly link into MS-DOS and early Windows-based PCs. The company had been providing RAS support for Unix based corporate systems since 1985.
