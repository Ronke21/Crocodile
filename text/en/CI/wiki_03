<text>RAIKO (, literally &quot;thunder drum&quot;) is a Japanese satellite which was built and operated by Tohoku and Wakayama Universities. A two-unit CubeSat, RAIKO was deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) on 4 October 2012, having been launched on 21 July 2012.

RAIKO was launched aboard the Kounotori 3 (HTV-3) spacecraft, atop an H-IIB launch vehicle flying from pad LC-Y2 of the Yoshinobu Launch Complex at the Tanegashima Space Center. The launch occurred at 02:06:18 UTC on 21 July 2012. Four other CubeSats were launched with RAIKO; WE WISH, FITSAT-1, TechEdSat-1 and F-1. The five CubeSats was delivered to the International Space Station for deployment. CubeSats were deployed from Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) &quot;Kibō&quot; via the J-SSOD system on 4 October 2012.

Named after a Japanese god of thunder, RAIKO is a spacecraft, which was used for technology demonstration. It carries a camera with a fish-eye lens for Earth imaging, a prototype star tracker, a deployable membrane to slow the satellite, lowering its orbit, a photographic system to measure the satellite&#x27;s movement relative to the International Space Station, and a Ku-band antenna for communications and Doppler ranging experiments.

WE WISH, RAIKO, FITSat 1, F-1, and TechEdSat-1 travelled to orbit aboard Kounotori 3 (HTV-3).

<text>Bush flying refers to aircraft operations carried out in the bush. Bush flying involves operations in rough terrain where there are often no prepared landing strips or runways, frequently necessitating that bush planes be equipped with abnormally large tires, skis, skids or any other equipment necessary for unpaved runway operation. It is the only viable way of delivering people and supplies into more difficult to reach, remote locations.

==Etymology==
This term &quot;bush&quot; has been used since the 19th century to describe remote wilderness area beyond clearings and settlements hence &quot;bush flying&quot; denotes flight operations carried out in such remote regions. In Australia, in particular, bush refers to areas that might be called forest or wilderness in other countries.

==Purpose==

Bush flying is the primary and sometimes the only method of access across Northern Canada, Western Canada, Alaska, the Australian Outback and many other parts of the world.

==History==
In Canada, the first real use of bush flying was for exploration and development, while in Alaska, transportation was the main purpose. Later, bush flying became important during rescue operations. Bush pilots are needed in rescue operations and are important for many different reasons.

===Canada===
After the 1918 Armistice with Germany, Ellwood Wilson, a Canadian forester employed by the Laurentide Company in Quebec, realized that airplanes could be used to spot forest fires and to map forested areas. In early 1919, after Wilson discovered that the U.S. Navy was giving Canada several war-surplus Curtiss HS-2L flying boats, he asked to borrow two. He then hired Captain Stuart Graham to fly the planes. Graham and his engineer, Walter Kahre, then flew the first HS-2L to Lac-à-la-Tortue on 4 June 1919, arriving on 8 June 1919. The flight had covered 645 miles, the longest cross-country flight executed in Canada at the time. He then delivered the other HS-2L to Lac-à-la-Tortue.

Equipped with the aircraft, the first bush flights occurred when fire patrol and aerial photography began in the summer of 1919 in the St. Maurice River valley. Graham and Kahre continued this service for two more seasons, but it became so expensive that the Laurentide Company underwrote the operation. In response, it was split into a separate company called Laurentide Air Services Ltd. with Wilson as president and former Royal Naval Air Service instructor and barnstormer William Roy Maxwell as vice president. These were the first bush flights in Eastern Canada.

In Western Canada, after Wilfrid May was discharged from the Royal Naval Air Service and moved to Edmonton, a Montreal businessman offered the city of Edmonton a Curtiss JN-4 after he found success in the city&#x27;s real estate. Mayor Joe Clarke and city council accepted the gift, prompting May to ask to rent the plane. City council and May agreed to a price of CA$25. May and his brother Court May completed the necessary paperwork and raised the required capital to form May Airplanes Ltd. George Gorman, a pilot, and Peter Derbyshire, a mechanic, joined the first commercial bush operations in Canada.

May then asked the publisher of the &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot; to fly copies of the paper to Wetaskiwin, south of Edmonton. He accepted and the next day, Gorman and Derbyshire flew the newspapers along with 2 sacks of advertising circulars, following the rail line to the city, announcing the service to communities along the way.

Bush flying in Canada is commemorated by the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario as well as two National Film Board of Canada documentary films, &quot;Bush Pilot: Reflections on a Canadian Myth&quot; (1980) and &quot;Bush Pilot - Into the Wild Blue Yonder&quot; (2000).

=== Alaska ===

Alaska&#x27;s first bush pilot was Carl Ben Eielson, a North Dakota farm boy of Scandinavian descent who flew during World War I. After the war, he moved to Alaska as a mathematics and science teacher in Fairbanks. However, he soon persuaded several citizens to help him acquire a Curtiss JN-4, flying passengers to nearby settlements. He then asked the postal operator for an airmail contract. The post office accepted the proposal and in 1924, Eielson received a de Havilland 4 that would be used to make eight mail runs to McGrath, away, before his contract was terminated after the third accident.

Noel Wien made the first successful bush flight to Livengood, Alaska on 19 Aug. 1924. This flight demonstrated that the trip in support of mining operations could be made in under an hour, when the dog sled trail would take several days in winter. Wien made 34 flights that first summer in support of the approximately 250 men located at the camp, providing supplies and services.

A woman by the name of Celia M. Hunter became one of the first to serve as a flight attendant for flights to both Nome, and Kotzebue in the year 1947. These were the first tourist trips to be accomplished by flying in the Alaskan bush.

==Aircraft used==
Bush flying involves operations in rough terrain, necessitating bush planes to be equipped with tundra tires, floats, or skis. A bush plane should have good short take-off and landing capabilities. A typical bush plane will usually have high mounted wings on top of its fuselage to ensure adequate ground clearance from obstacles. They will normally have conventional &quot;tail-dragger&quot; landing gear as they offer lower drag and weight than tricycle landing gear, and is more suited to rough surfaces. The greater upward angle of the taildragger configuration gives the propeller more ground clearance allowing it to avoid striking the ground, which would cause damage. Most types can be equipped with wheels, skis or floats, to operate from dry ground, snow, ice and protected waterways. Some commonly seen bushplanes include:

*The Grumman G-21 Goose amphibian, whose combination of both a flying boat hull and wheeled undercarriage endowed it with considerable versatility.

*The De Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver designed and built in Canada in 1946 is widely used throughout Canada and Alaska.

*The De Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter (also from Canada) was widely used throughout the Canadian and Alaskan bush. The aircraft which began its service in 1952 was supplemented by a later twin engine version, the Twin Otter that remains in widespread service.

*The Cessna 185 Skywagon is a popular light aircraft widely used in the bush.

*The Noorduyn Norseman served intensely as a bush plane in its native Canada, and with the US military, equipped either with ski or floats or fixed-wheel landing gear

*The Piper PA-18 Super Cub is a two-seat airplane developed in 1949 and is fitted with a variety of engines of different sizes. The aircraft is capable of carrying a single passenger.
*The Quest Kodiak is a high-wing, unpressurized, single-engined turboprop with fixed tricycle landing gear. Developed in 1999, passenger seats are track-mounted and removable, it has access doors for the pilots and the aft clamshell door, with automatic steps, allows cargo loading or eight passengers boarding. and is suitable for STOL operations from unimproved airfields.

<text>The Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne et Contemporain de Strasbourg (MAMCS, Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art) is an art museum in Strasbourg, France, which was founded in 1973 and opened in its own building in November 1998.

One of the largest of its kind in France, the museum houses extensive collections of paintings, sculpture, graphic arts, multimedia and design from the period between 1870 (Impressionism) and today, as well as a wide range of pieces in its photographic library. It owns a total of 18,400 works. Numerous exhibitions are organized annually, showing either the works of a particular artist or a retrospective of an artistic genre. The art library of the municipal museums (&quot;Bibliothèque d&#x27;art des musées municipaux&quot;), the art book shop of the municipal museums (&quot;Librairie d&#x27;art des musées municipaux&quot;) and a multi-purpose auditorium for conferences, films and concerts are also found in the same building. The spacious roof terrace accommodates a museum cafe.

== Building ==
The municipal collection of modern and contemporary art of the city of Strasbourg has been constantly enlarged and enriched since 1871 and the founding of the &quot;Reichsland&quot; Alsace-Lorraine. There had already been plans to erect an independent museum since the 1960s.

The building was constructed on the left bank of the river Ill from 1995 until 1998. It was designed by the Parisian architect Adrien Fainsilber, who had already designed the Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie in the French capital. The exhibition and usable floor space open out on both sides of a central glass covered walk, which is conceived in cathedral-like dimensions, with an interior length of 104 meters and an interior height of 22 meters. A horse sculpture (4 meters high), &quot;Hortus conclusus&quot;, by the Italian artist Mimmo Paladino is placed on the museum&#x27;s roof. The building is located at the edge of the old quarter of the city (Petite France), in front of the administrative center of the department (École nationale d&#x27;administration) and near the architecturally important baroque weir Barrage Vauban and the medieval tower bridge Ponts couverts. It is also served by its own tramway stop on the Strasbourg tramway (&quot;Musée d&#x27;Art moderne&quot;, line B).

== Collections ==
As of 11 October 2024, the museum&#x27;s collections comprised 18,416 works in total, among which 1,817 paintings, 5,529 drawings, 905 sculptures, 4,219 prints and 3,674 photographs. Among famous artists, it comprises 435 works by Gustave Doré, 161 works by Max Klinger, 60 works by Jean Arp, 38 works by Victor Brauner, 29 works by Sophie Taeuber-Arp, 22 by Vassily Kandinsky, 10 by César Domela, 7 by Theo van Doesburg and several by Käthe Kollwitz, Max Ernst, František Kupka; besides works by slightly less celebrated artists like Lou Albert-Lasard (2,004 works), François-Rupert Carabin (775 works), Marcelle Cahn (368 works), Lothar von Seebach (321 works), Jean-Désiré Ringel d&#x27;Illzach (250 works), etc. A further accent is set by contemporary German painters (Markus Lüpertz, Eugen Schönebeck, Georg Baselitz, Jörg Immendorff, A. R. Penck, Albert Oehlen, Daniel Richter, Jonathan Meese, Thomas Scheibitz, Wolf Vostell etc.), who give a representative glimpse of an art genre which is otherwise rarely seen in France, especially on this scale.

The Musée d’Art Moderne et Contemporain de Strasbourg also owns the first cubist painting ever purchased by a public French collection, &quot;Still Life&quot; (1911) by Georges Braque, acquired in 1923, as well as the first painting by Dante Gabriel Rossetti purchased by a public French collection, &quot;Joan of Arc Kissing the Sword of Deliverance&quot; (1863), acquired in 1996 (now displayed in the Musée des Beaux-Arts).

The collection of Alsatian artists is also important, in terms of their number and at least their regional value, representing such genres as Art Nouveau, Expressionism and New Realism: Charles Spindler, René Beeh, Jean-Désiré Ringel d&#x27;Illzach, Henri Beecke, Luc Hueber, Martin Hubrecht and Camille Claus.

The photographic library of the museum has several thousand photographs, from the origin of photography up until today, including works of Nadar, Eugène Atget, Eadweard Muybridge, Étienne-Jules Marey, August Sander, Willy Maywald, Josef Sudek, Robert Mapplethorpe, Duane Michals and Jan Saudek. Regional photography is also acknowledged.

The artistic video collection has works of Bill Viola, Nam June Paik, Woody Vasulka, Olaf Breuning and many others.

=== Looted art and restitution ===
In 1999 a French court ordered that the museum restitute to a Jewish family a work by Gustav Klimt (Die Erfülling) looted by the Nazis during World War II. Museum officials argued that they knew nothing about its wartime past. The Klimt had been owned by Karl Grunwald, an Austrian art dealer and was confiscated in 1940 when the Nazis invaded France and sold at public auction in 1943. The non-profit Friends of Strasbourg Museums bought the painting in 1959 for a low price and donated it to the museum. The family sued the city of Strasbourg, and the case that took 13 years to resolve. It was formally restituted in 2000.

<doc id="1043397" wikidata="Q155808" url="?curid=1043397" title="Mainit">
<text>Mainit, officially the Municipality of Mainit (Surigaonon: Lungsod nan Mainit; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Surigao del Norte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 28,019 people.

It is situated on the north shore of Lake Mainit in the north-eastern part of Mindanao. The word &quot;mainit&quot; literally means &quot;hot&quot;. The other local term for &quot;mainit&quot; is &quot;mapaso.&quot; Mainit is home to a hot spring, the Mapaso Wellness Resort frequented by locals and visitors from nearby towns and provinces. It is regarded that Mainit got its name from this hot sulfuric spring.

==History==
The first inhabitants of Mainit settled near Lake Mainit in what is now barangay San Isidro (formerly called &quot;Daang Lungsod&quot; or &quot;Old Town&quot;). It was believed that the constant harassment of pirates forced the original settlers to move to the present town site.

Mainit was established as a Barrio in 1904 under the Municipality of Placer. In 1906, it was transferred under the jurisdiction and reclassified as a Municipality of the Province of Agusan del Norte (owing to its proximity to the border of Surigao del Norte and Agusan del Norte). However, after six months, Mainit was returned to the Province of Surigao del Norte and its status was reverted to being a barangay of Placer. Mainit was finally reclassified into a separate municipality in Jan. 1, 1931 by virtue of Executive Order 290 dated December 27, 1930, signed by Governor-General Dwight F. Davis.

Two of Mainit&#x27;s barangays were made into full-fledged municipalities: Tubod in 1958 and Alegria in 1968. Mainit currently has 21 Barangays.

Mainit got its name from the hot sulfuric spring which flows to the river the “Mapaso Hot Spring”. Mapaso literally is “hot”.

==Geography==

===Barangays===
Mainit is politically subdivided into 21 Barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

<doc id="1043398" wikidata="Q3831016" url="?curid=1043398" title="Let It Roll (Little Feat album)">
<text>Let It Roll is the eighth studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1988. Eight of the ten songs on the album were co-written by new band member Craig Fuller, the founding member of Pure Prairie League. Fuller also takes most lead vocals. The album attained RIAA certified gold status on February 14, 1989. It is the first Little Feat studio album without Lowell George, after his death in 1979 and is one of their most successful albums, sparking a comeback by the band. The first single, &quot;Hate to Lose Your Lovin&#x27;&quot;, earned the band their first #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

== Reception ==
Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, said:

What&#x27;s surprising about &quot;Let It Roll&quot; is not just that it works, but that it works smashingly. It sounds as if the group picked up after &quot;The Last Record Album&quot;, deciding to return to the sound of &quot;Feats Don&#x27;t Fail Me Now&quot;. True, the songwriting might not have the idiosyncratic genius of George, but it&#x27;s strong, catchy and memorable, from the fine singles &quot;Hate to Lose Your Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Let it Roll&quot; to album tracks. More importantly, the band sounds lively and playful - Little Feat hasn&#x27;t sounded this good in the studio since Feats, so it&#x27;s easy to see why the members wanted to regroup. Yes, George is missed - it&#x27;s hard not to miss such a gifted songwriter and musician - but &quot;Let It Roll&quot; isn&#x27;t disrespectful of his memory, it keeps his music alive, which is the greatest compliment it can be paid.

<text>The ACBA Midour, Midour 2 and Midour 3 are a series of glider tugs manufactured by the Aéro Club du Bas Armagnac in France, and named after the Midou River.

==Design and development==
The Midour is a double-seat, low-wing monoplane of conventional configuration, fitted with a fixed, tricycle undercarriage. Developed in the workshop of the ACBA using the wings of a Robin DR400, the Midour first flew in 1993 and four additional examples to the original design have been built, along with two modified versions.

Although the Midour is sometimes equipped with only a single seat, a passenger can be carried behind the pilot, to assist in the release of gliders being towed.

==Variants==
;ACBA-7 Midour
:Original version with Lycoming O-360 engine; five built.

;ACBA-8 Midour 2
:Improved version with entirely new wing design. One built.

;ACBA Midour 3
:Optimised, quieted version of Midour 2 with new fuselage and canopy, designed to be especially quiet due to noise pollution concerns. One built.

<doc id="1043414" wikidata="Q5544454" url="?curid=1043414" title="George Shannon (explorer)">
<text>George Shannon (c. 1785–1836), the youngest member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition (not counting the infant Jean Baptiste Charbonneau), was born in Pennsylvania of Irish ancestry. He joined the Corps of Discovery in August 1803, as one of the three men (and Seaman) from Pittsburgh recruited by Lewis as he was waiting for the completion of the voyage&#x27;s vessels in the city.

On August 26, 1804, he was sent to retrieve two pack horses; he was separated from the party for sixteen days and nearly starved, as he went without food for twelve days except for some grapes and rabbits. At first he thought he was behind the expedition, so he sped up thinking he could catch up. Then, getting hungry, he went downstream to look for a trading party he could stay with.

Shannon got lost again August 6, 1805, when the expedition was at the Three Forks. He was dispatched up a fork the party had named Wisdom (the middle fork was named Jefferson and the placid fork, Philanthropy). He rejoined the party after three days by backtracking to the forks and following the trail of the others.

In 1807 he was with a party led by Nathaniel Pryor that was attempting to return the Mandan chief Sheheke to his people. He was wounded in an encounter with the Arikaras and lost a leg; he would eventually receive a government pension.

In 1810 he assisted in Nicholas Biddle&#x27;s history of the expedition. Later, Clark asked him to join a fur trading enterprise, but Shannon chose to study law instead. By 1818 he had a law practice in Lexington, Kentucky with Thomas T. Barr, a former Transylvania University trustee and Kentucky state legislator. That year, his assets included $700, one cow, and two enslaved people. By 1822, he owned his home, one horse, three cows, $2480, and six enslaved people.

Later, ran for senator from Missouri. He was buried in Palmyra, Missouri.

His brothers were Congressman Thomas Shannon (Ohio politician) and Ohio/Kansas Governor[s]Wilson Shannon

==Legacy==
George Shannon is the namesake of Shannon County, Missouri.

In 2001, a number of northeastern Nebraska communities formed Shannon Trail Promoters, with the goal of increasing tourism in the forthcoming bicentennial year of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The organization commissioned thirteen wooden chainsaw sculptures of Shannon, which were placed in participating communities along a Shannon Trail. Sixteen wayside markers recounting aspects of Shannon&#x27;s career were also placed along the trail, which runs through the region in which Shannon is thought to have wandered during his 1804 separation from the expedition. In keeping with Shannon&#x27;s claim to fame, a scavenger hunt was held, with tourists urged to &quot;Find Private Shannon&quot; by visiting all sixteen markers. The organization continues to stage Shannon-themed events.

In 2007, when a new bridge was under construction to carry U.S. Highway 81 across the Missouri River from Cedar County, Nebraska to Yankton, South Dakota, one of the names proposed for it was the Private Shannon Bridge. In an online poll, the name was selected by a plurality of those responding, garnering 26% of the votes. However, the Yankton-based committee responsible for naming the bridge elected to call it the Yankton Discovery Bridge, a choice that did not sit well with Nebraskans. The &quot;Yankton&quot; was eventually dropped from the name, and the bridge is now known as the Discovery Bridge.

Shannon is the subject of the poet Campbell McGrath&#x27;s 2009 work &quot;Shannon: A Poem of the Lewis and Clark Expedition&quot;. Shannon has been featured elsewhere in literature, film and television including Ken Burn&#x27;s Lewis and Clark where he was voiced by Tim Clark, Leon Martell&#x27;s Bea[u]tiful in the Extreme where he was portrayed by Andrew David James. He is also the central character in the historical fiction book &quot;My Travels with Capts. Lewis &amp; Clark, by George Shannon&quot; written by Kate McMullan. McMullan, a descendant of Shannon&#x27;s, based the work on his actual journals.

George Shannon was one of the &quot;9 men from Kentucky&quot;. He was lost for 16 days.

<doc id="1043434" wikidata="Q7314267" url="?curid=1043434" title="Representing the Mambo">
<text>Representing the Mambo is the ninth studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1990. It peaked at No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was supported by a North American tour. &quot;Texas Twister&quot; and &quot;Rad Gumbo&quot; were released as singles.

==Production==
The majority of the album was recorded at Skywalker Ranch, following a week&#x27;s worth of work in Los Angeles. The album cover art is by Neon Park. Craig Fuller, Bill Payne, and Paul Barrère sing on &quot;Representing the Mambo&quot;.

&quot;Those Feat&#x27;ll Steer Ya Wrong Sometimes&quot; is about a band member failing to get out of a speeding ticket. &quot;Teenage Warrior&quot; is about gang warfare in Los Angeles.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;one or two tunes sound interesting (the album has a Steely Dan-like studio polish to it), but nothing holds up to even cursory scrutiny.&quot; The &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; opined that &quot;though the band still packs a tremendous one-two punch with its rich mix of country rock and blues, the crackle that marked &quot;Let it Roll&quot;, as well as previous releases, is nowhere to be found.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised &quot;the evocative, cinematic title cut.&quot;

The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; noted that &quot;there are hints of the post-psychedelic country-rock of Little Feat&#x27;s infancy, which usually rings stale.&quot; The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; determined that &quot;some of the new album treads closely to standard rock-radio fare.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; deemed &quot;Representing the Mambo&quot; &quot;a more full-tilt slice of Southern rock-a-boogie funk.&quot;

<text>In communications, flood control is a feature of many communication protocols designed to prevent overwhelming of a destination receiver. Such controls can be implemented either in software or in hardware, and will often request that the message be resent after the receiver has finished processing. 

Internet forums often use a flood control mechanism to prevent too many messages from being posted at once, either to prevent spamming or denial-of-service attacks. Internet Relay Chat servers will often quit users performing IRC floods with an &quot;Excess Flood&quot; message.

<text>Shake Me Up is the tenth studio album by the American rock band Little Feat, released in 1991 (see 1991 in music). It was the last album they recorded with frontman Craig Fuller. It is also their only album to feature no lead vocals from keyboardist Bill Payne.

Among the album&#x27;s contributors were Bonnie Bramlett (now Sheridan) who had last featured with the group on &quot;Dixie Chicken&quot; in 1973 and Valerie Carter who had worked closely with the group&#x27;s founder Lowell George in his latter years. Another backing vocalist, Shaun Murphy, got to sing lead on a line of &quot;Spider&#x27;s Blues (Might Need It Sometime)&quot;. Murphy would join the group in Craig Fuller&#x27;s place after he left in 1993.

The album cover art is by Neon Park - the last cover that he provided the group before his death from ALS in 1993.

<doc id="1043455" wikidata="Q2957125" url="?curid=1043455" title="Lytton, British Columbia">
<text>Lytton is a village of about 250 residents in southern British Columbia, Canada, on the east side of the Fraser River and primarily the south side of the Thompson River, where it flows southwesterly into the Fraser. The community includes the Village of Lytton and the surrounding community of the Lytton First Nation, whose name for the place is Camchin, also spelled &quot;Kumsheen&quot; (&quot;river meeting&quot;).

During heat waves, Lytton is often the hottest spot in Canada despite its location north of 50°N in latitude. In three consecutive days of June 2021, it broke the all-time record for Canada&#x27;s highest temperature, ending at on June 29. This is the highest temperature ever recorded north of 45°N and higher than the all-time records for Europe and South America. The next day (June 30), a wildfire swept through the valley, destroying the majority of the town.

The Lytton area has been inhabited by the First Nations people for over 10,000 years. It was one of the earliest locations settled by immigrants in the Southern Interior of British Columbia. The town was founded during the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–59, when it was known as &quot;The Forks.&quot;

==History==
The people of the Nlakaʼpamux First Nation lived on the site before the town of Lytton was founded. Lytton was on the route of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858. The same year, it was named after Edward Bulwer-Lytton, the British Colonial Secretary and a novelist. For many years, Lytton was a stop on major transportation routes, namely, the River Trail beginning in 1858, Cariboo Wagon Road in 1862, the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s, the Cariboo Highway in the 1920s, and the Trans Canada Highway in the 1950s. The town is much less important since the construction of the Coquihalla Highway in 1987, which uses a more direct route to the BC Interior.

In 2015, Lytton was featured on the CBC television show &quot;Still Standing&quot; with host Jonny Harris.

===2021 wildfire and destruction===

On June 30, 2021, the day after Lytton set a Canadian all-time high temperature record of , a wildfire swept through the community, destroying most structures. All villagers were ordered to evacuate. Local MP Brad Vis said 90% of the village burned down. Two people died.

In the year since the fire, only a quarter of the properties were cleared of ash and debris. There was incessant wrangling between local residents who wanted to restore buildings and power immediately, and the local council who wanted fire-prevention standards in place. Coupled with inadequate insurance payouts and local record-breaking floods, residents were running out of time to restore the village. They were further hampered when another wildfire took out six residences across the river in July 2022.

==Name origin==
Novelist Edward Bulwer-Lytton was a friend and contemporary of Charles Dickens and was one of the pioneers of the historical novel, exemplified by his most popular work, &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;. He is best remembered today for the opening line to the novel &quot;Paul Clifford&quot;, which begins &quot;It was a dark and stormy night...&quot; and is considered by some to be the worst opening sentence in the English language. Bulwer-Lytton is also responsible for sayings such as &quot;The pen is mightier than the sword&quot; from his play &quot;Richelieu&quot;. Though he was a popular author in the 19th century, fewer people today are aware of his prodigious body of literature, which spans many genres. In the 21st century, he may be better known as the namesake for the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest (BLFC), sponsored annually by the English Department at San Jose State University, which challenges entrants &quot;to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels.&quot;

In 1858, Governor James Douglas named the town after Bulwer-Lytton &quot;as a merited compliment and mark of respect.&quot; Bulwer-Lytton served as Colonial Secretary. As governor of the then-colony, Douglas would have reported to him.

===Lord Lytton literary debate===
On August 30, 2008, the Village of Lytton invited Henry Lytton Cobbold, the great-great-great-grandson of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, to defend the great man&#x27;s honour by debating Professor Scott Rice, the sponsor of the BLFC, on the literary and political legacies of his great ancestor. The debate received wide media coverage including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, CBC&#x27;s &quot;As It Happens&quot;, and many local and regional media outlets. The debate was moderated by Mike McArdell of Global TV. Lytton Cobbold provided a spirited and crowd-inspiring defence of his ancestor, and despite a factual and well-researched presentation by Rice, Lytton Cobbold emerged as the crowd favourite by a wide margin. In the end, Rice begrudgingly admitted to an admiration of Bulwer-Lytton. This event was held as part of the Village of Lytton&#x27;s BC150 celebrations, which marked the 150th anniversary of the date that the community received its name, in addition to the province-wide celebration of the establishment of the original Colony of British Columbia on August 2, 1858.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Lytton had a population of 210 living in 104 of its 118 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 249. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Another 1,700 people in the immediate area live in rural areas and on reserves of the neighbouring six Nlaka&#x27;pamux communities.

802 members out of 1,970 registered members of the Lytton First Nation live on reserves immediately adjacent to the municipality.

==Climate==
Lytton experiences an inland hot-summer mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa)&quot;, using the -3 °C isotherm, or a dry-summer continental climate (&quot;Dsa&quot;), using the 0 °C isotherm. During summer heat waves, Lytton is often the hottest spot in Canada, despite its location north of 50°N in latitude. Because of the dry summer air and a relatively low elevation of , summer afternoon shade temperatures frequently reach and occasionally top . Lytton holds the record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Canada with a record high of on June 29 of the 2021 Western North America heat wave. This occurred after having already broken records multiple times during the previous days of that heat wave. This is the world&#x27;s highest temperature ever recorded north of the 45th parallel. The previous record was 121 °F (49.4 °C) in Steele, North Dakota on July 6, 1936. Lytton has recorded a higher temperature than all but 4 U.S. states, with only Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Nevada ever recording higher temperatures. Lytton has also recorded higher temperatures than all of Europe and South America have ever recorded.

Before the 2021 heat wave occurred, Lytton, along with the nearby community of Lillooet, shared the second-highest temperature ever recorded in Canada. On July 16 and 17, 1941, the temperature reached a then-record on both days in both communities. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Lytton was on January 18, 1950. While reporting on the new records in 2021, Global News noted that the official Environment and Climate Change Canada weather station is located in the shade and is about cooler than the rest of the village. Hot summer temperatures are made more tolerable by low humidity. The heat can be intense under usually clear skies and sunlight, or by the valley&#x27;s radiant slopes. Forest fires are not uncommon during the summer.

Lytton&#x27;s climate is also characterised by relatively short and mild winters (although average monthly temperatures in December and January are just below freezing), with Pacific maritime influence during the winter ensuring thick cloud cover much of the time. Cold snaps originating from arctic outflow occur from time to time, but tend to be short-lived, and mountains to the north usually block extreme cold from penetrating the Fraser Canyon.

Lytton receives of annual precipitation on average, making it much drier than communities to the south but certainly wetter than some of the driest spots in the BC interior, such as Ashcroft, Kamloops, Spences Bridge, and Osoyoos. It has the driest summers in the interior of British Columbia and one of the driest summers of all places in Canada. Maximum precipitation occurs in the cooler months, with late autumn and early winter constituting the wettest time of the year.

==Vegetation==
Open coniferous forests of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine dominate the slopes around Lytton. Some black cottonwood is scattered among the conifers. Bunchgrass dominates the forest floor. Non-native trees cultivated in Lytton include black locust and Manitoba Maple.
==Transportation==

Lytton lies on the Trans-Canada Highway as well as both the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways. The Canadian National Railway crosses both the Fraser and Thompson Rivers on two large steel bridges at Lytton. Via the Trans-Canada, Lytton is approximately from the city of Vancouver, north of Hope, and south of Cache Creek and Ashcroft.

Highway 12 runs north from Lytton to Lillooet, connecting there to Highway 99, which leads southwest to Pemberton and Whistler and beyond to Vancouver, and northeast to its terminus at Lower Hat Creek (Carquile) at a junction with Highway 97 just north of Cache Creek.

The Lytton Ferry, a free reaction ferry, crosses the Fraser River at Lytton. On the river&#x27;s west side are Indian reserve communities of the Lytton First Nation and the Stein Valley Nlaka&#x27;pamux Heritage Park via trails from the confluence of the Stein River with the Fraser. From the ferry, a route known as the West Side Road leads through the Nesikep and Texas Creek areas to Lillooet and BC Highway 99; the route south from the ferry is much more difficult but leads to North Bend-Boston Bar. When the ferry is out of service because of ice or low water levels on the Fraser River, pedestrian access is available via a walkway on the Canadian National Railway bridge crossing the river.

Via Rail&#x27;s Canadian and the Rocky Mountaineer pass through Lytton but do not make any stops. Via Rail&#x27;s closest stops are Ashcroft, to the north, and North Bend/Boston Bar, to the south.

The single main employer in the village produced forestry products and was forced to close because of market uncertainties in 2007.

Lytton is the self-proclaimed &quot;River Rafting Capital of Canada&quot; with Kumsheen Rafting Resort now the largest employer in the area. A provincial campsite, Skihist Provincial Park, adjacent to the Trans-Canada Highway six kilometres north of the village, has space for tenting as well as RVs and enjoys one of the few views available of Skihist Mountain, the highest summit of the Lillooet Ranges, across the Fraser to the west of Lytton. The privately run Jade Springs Restaurant, also east of the village on the Trans-Canada, burned down in the fire of June 2021.

<text>The medullary cavity (&quot;medulla&quot;, innermost part) is the central cavity of bone shafts where red bone marrow and/or yellow bone marrow (adipose tissue) is stored; hence, the medullary cavity is also known as the marrow cavity. 

Located in the main shaft of a long bone (diaphysis) (consisting mostly of compact bone), the medullary cavity has walls composed of spongy bone (cancellous bone) and is lined with a thin, vascular membrane (endosteum).

This area is involved in the formation of red blood cells and white blood cells, and the calcium supply for bird eggshells. The area has been detected in fossil bones despite the fossilization process.

Intramedullary is a medical term meaning the inside of a bone. Examples include intramedullary rods used to treat bone fractures in orthopedic surgery and intramedullary tumors occurring in some forms of cancer or benign tumors such as an enchondroma.

<doc id="1043466" wikidata="Q597077" url="?curid=1043466" title="Canton of Baden">
<text>The Canton of Baden () was a canton of the Helvetic Republic (a Napoleonic-era precursor of modern-day Switzerland). Its capital was the town of Baden.

==Formation==
The canton was created in 1798 from the merger of the County of Baden with the Freie Ämter (free bailiwicks) and Kelleramt, all of which had until then been condominiums (&quot;gemeine Herrschaften&quot;) of the Old Swiss Confederation.

The canton was divided into five districts — Baden, Bremgarten, Muri, Sarmenstorf and Zurzach. The canton, like the others of the Helvetic Republic, was administered by a governor () and an administrative chamber (), a vice-governor () in each district, as well as agents in the municipalities. In 1799, there were 45,982 residents, though the Jewish population was not counted in the census.

==Dissolution==

Since the majority of Roman Catholic, conservative population were indifferent to the new state, officials and politicians had to be imported from neighboring cantons. The canton was divided and some municipalities sought affiliations with other cantons: the Lutheran congregations in the Limmattal wanted to affiliate with Zürich, the &quot;Amt&quot; of Hitzkirch with Lucerne, and the upper Freiamt with Zug or Schwyz.

The canton was not politically viable, notably due to its lack of an economic base; in both 1801 (Constitution of Malmaison) and 1802 (Second Helvetic Constitution), it was decided to merge the canton into Aargau, but the move was not completed. Napoleon Bonaparte signed the Act of Mediation on 19 February 1803 and, in the process, the canton of Baden was dissolved and united with the cantons of Aargau and Fricktal, forming the contemporary canton of Aargau.

Some parts of the canton of Baden at this point were transferred to other cantons: the &quot;Amt&quot; of Hitzkirch to Lucerne, whilst Hüttikon, Oetwil an der Limmat, Dietikon and Schlieren went to Zürich. In return, Lucerne&#x27;s &quot;Amt&quot; of Merenschwand was transferred to Aargau (district of Muri).

==Contemporary districts==
The former canton can still be identified with the contemporary Aargau districts of Zurzach, Baden, Bremgarten and Muri (albeit with the gains and losses in 1803 as detailed above).

<doc id="1043480" wikidata="Q7084740" url="?curid=1043480" title="Old Plank Road">
<text>The Old Plank Road is a plank road in Imperial County, California, that was built in 1915 as an east–west route over the Algodones Dunes. It effectively connected the extreme lower section of Southern California to Arizona and provided the last link in a commercial route between San Diego and Yuma.

==History==

Following Los Angeles&#x27; winning the right to be the western terminus of the transcontinental railroad, San Diego&#x27;s civic leaders proposed the Plank Road to ensure their city became the hub of Southern California&#x27;s road network rather than Los Angeles.

Among those promoters was businessman and road builder &quot;Colonel&quot; Ed Fletcher who accepted a challenge from the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; to run a road race in October 1912 to determine the best route between Southern California and Phoenix. A reporter with the paper was given a 24-hour head start in Los Angeles; Fletcher would proceed from San Diego. Fletcher elected to traverse the constantly shifting sand dunes using a team of horses to pull his automobile through the sand, and won the race in a seemingly impossible 19.5 hours.

Buoyed by the success of the race and with the backing of local newspapers, Fletcher raised the money to pay for 13,000 planks shipped from San Diego to Holtville, California. The first planks were laid on February 14, 1915, with the help of both volunteers and paid labor. The roadbed consisted of two parallel plank tracks, each 25 inches/63.5 cm wide, spiked to wooden crosspieces laid underneath. The total length of the Plank Road was 6.5 miles/10.4 km. Work ended nearly two months later on April 4.

Though traffic and maintenance crews who cleared the wooden road with mule-drawn scrapers soon took its toll on the planking, the road was considered a success. In June 1915, the California State Highway Commission assumed responsibility for the Plank Road as part of the road system linking Southern California with Arizona.

A second, more sophisticated Plank Road was commissioned in 1916. The new roadway consisted of prefabricated wooden sections laid to a width of 8 feet/2.4 m with double-width turnouts every 1000 feet/305 m. The sections were shipped to the work site via horse-drawn wagon from their assembly point in nearby Ogilby, and then lowered into place using a crane.

For the next ten years, work crews struggled against the elements to keep the Plank Road open. The cost and difficulty of the maintenance coupled with improved road technology — not to mention the incredibly rough ride the planks created and the fact that the road was only wide enough for a single vehicle — meant that the days of the Plank Road were numbered.

A new, 20-foot/6-meter-wide road with an asphaltic concrete surface constructed on top of a built-up sand embankment replaced the Old Plank Road upon its opening on August 12, 1926. The same roadway later became displaced by U.S. Route 80, itself since displaced by Interstate 8.

Today, only fragments of the Plank Road remain. They are protected under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. The fragments are both a California Historical Landmark and eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Remnants of the Plank Road may be seen at the west end of Grays Well Road, a frontage road south of I-8. A monument to the Plank Road and interpretive display lie approximately three miles/5.4 km west of the Sand Hills interchange. The monument&#x27;s largest feature is a 1500-foot/457-meter-long replica of the road created in the early 1970s out of existing fragments.

==California Historical Landmark==
California Historical Landmark number 845 reads:

:&quot;NO. 845 PLANK ROAD - This unique plank road, seven miles long, was the only means early motorists had of crossing the treacherous Imperial sand dunes. The 8-by-12-foot sections were moved with a team of horses whenever the shifting sands covered portions of the road. Double sections were placed at intervals to permit vehicles to pass&quot;

<doc id="1043481" wikidata="Q466386" url="?curid=1043481" title="Mary Travers">
<text>Mary Allin Travers (November 9, 1936 – September 16, 2009) was an American singer-songwriter who found fame as a member of the 1960s folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, along with Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey. Travers grew up amid the burgeoning folk scene in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village, and she released five solo albums. She sang in the contralto range.

==Early life and education==
Mary Travers was born in 1936 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Robert Travers and Virginia Coigney, journalists and active organizers of The Newspaper Guild, a trade union. In 1938, when Robert&#x27;s employer, &quot;The Herald-Post&quot;, closed, the family moved to Greenwich Village in New York City.

Mary attended the progressive Little Red School House, where she met musical icons like Pete Seeger and Paul Robeson. Robeson sang her lullabies. Travers left school in the 11th grade to become a member of the Song Swappers folk group.

==Singing career==

The Song Swappers sang backup for Pete Seeger on four reissue albums in 1955, when Folkways Records reissued a collection of Seeger&#x27;s pro-union folk songs, &quot;Talking Union&quot;. Travers regarded her singing as a hobby (she worked full-time as a dental technician) and was shy about it, but was encouraged by fellow musicians. She also was in the cast of the Broadway show &quot;The Next President&quot;.

The group Peter, Paul and Mary was formed in 1961, and was an immediate success. They shared a manager, Albert Grossman, with Bob Dylan. Their success with Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot; helped propel Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Freewheelin&#x27;&quot; album into the U.S. Top 30 four months after its release.

Peter, Paul and Mary broke up in 1970, shortly after having their biggest UK hit, singer-songwriter John Denver&#x27;s ballad &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane&quot; (originally titled &quot;Babe I Hate To Go&quot;) (UK No. 2, February 1970). The song, which reached the top of both the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Cash Box&quot; charts in December 1969, was the group&#x27;s only number one hit.

Travers subsequently pursued a solo career and recorded five albums: &quot;Mary&quot; (1971), &quot;Morning Glory&quot; (1972), &quot;All My Choices&quot; (1973), &quot;Circles&quot; (1974) and &quot;It&#x27;s in Everyone of Us&quot; (1978). The group reunited for one night in June 1972 to take part in a special fundraising concert at Madison Square Garden for presidential candidate Sen. George McGovern.

Peter, Paul and Mary re-formed in 1978, toured extensively, and issued many new albums until Travers&#x27; death. BBC television recorded their performance at the Southport Theatre in 1983. The group was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Personal life==
Travers was married four times. Her first brief union, to John Filler, produced her older daughter, Erika, in 1960. In 1963, she married Barry Feinstein, a prominent freelance photographer of musicians and celebrities. Her younger daughter, Alicia, was born in 1966, and the couple divorced the following year. In the 1970s, she was married to Gerald Taylor, publisher of &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. After the end of her marriage to Taylor, Travers had a relationship with lawyer Richard Ben-Veniste for several years while raising her daughters in New York. In 1991 she married restaurateur Ethan Robbins and lived with him in the small town of Redding, Connecticut for the remainder of her life.

==Illness and death==
In 2004, Travers was diagnosed with leukemia. A bone marrow transplant in 2005 induced a temporary remission, but she died on September 16, 2009, at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut, from complications related to the marrow transplant and other treatments.

==Legacy==

A memorial service for Travers was held on November 9, 2009, at Riverside Church In New York City. The four-hour service, on what would have been her 73rd birthday, was attended by a capacity crowd. Two of the many reflections shared at the service speak to the impact of Mary Travers&#x27;s work and the significance of her legacy. Feminist Gloria Steinem commented that with her poise and conviction as a performer, Ms. Travers &quot;seemed to us to be a free woman, and that helped us to be free.&quot; Folk singer and co-founder of the Newport Folk Festival, Theodore Bikel, mused on her roles as political activist and glamorous pop-music touchstone: “There were other people besides Mary who taught us that dissent was right and dissent was just,” he said. “But only Mary taught us that dissent was also beautiful.”

<text>EF Eridani (abbreviated EF Eri, sometimes incorrectly referred to as EF Eridanus) is a variable star of the type known as polars, AM Herculis stars, or magnetic cataclysmic variable stars. Historically it has varied between apparent magnitudes 14.5 and 17.3, although since 1995 it has generally remained at the lower limit. The star system consists of a white dwarf with a substellar-mass former star in orbit.

==EF Eridani B==
The substellar mass in orbit around the white dwarf is a star that lost all of its gas to the white dwarf. What remains is an object with a mass of 0.05 solar masses (), or about 53 Jupiter masses (), which is too small to continue fusion, and does not have the composition of a super-Jupiter, brown dwarf, or white dwarf. There is no category for such a stellar remnant.

It is theorized that 500 million years ago, the white dwarf started to cannibalize its partner, when they were separated by 7 million km. As it lost mass, the regular star spiraled inward. Today, they are separated by a mere 700,000 km for an orbital period of . The orbit is expected to continue to shrink due to gravitational radiation.

<doc id="1043490" wikidata="Q230779" url="?curid=1043490" title="Annabeth Gish">
<text>Anne Elizabeth &quot;Annabeth&quot; Gish (born March 13, 1971) is an American actress. She played roles in the films &quot;Shag&quot;, &quot;Hiding Out&quot;, &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;, &quot;SLC Punk!&quot;, &quot;The Last Supper&quot; and &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;. On television, she played Special Agent Monica Reyes on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Elizabeth Bartlet Westin on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, Diane Gould on &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;, Eileen Caffee on &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, Sarah Gunning on Midnight Mass, Charlotte Millwright on &quot;The Bridge&quot; and Sheriff Althea Jarry on the seventh and final season of &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Gish was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the daughter of Judy and Robert Gish. When she was two, her family moved to Cedar Falls, Iowa, where she grew up with her brother, Tim, and her sister, Robin. Her father was an English professor at the University of Northern Iowa; her mother was an elementary school teacher.

Gish went to Northern University High School in Cedar Falls, where she graduated in 1989. She attended Duke University, where she was a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and focused her energies on the drama program, film studies and women&#x27;s studies. She graduated in 1993, earning a B.A. in English.

==Career==
Gish&#x27;s first starring role was in the 1986 teen film &quot;Desert Bloom&quot;. In 1987, she starred in the film &quot;Hiding Out&quot; with Jon Cryer. She played Kat, the sister of Julia Roberts&#x27; character, in 1988&#x27;s &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot;. In 1989, Gish&#x27;s first major TV film role was in &quot;When He&#x27;s Not a Stranger&quot; as rape victim Lyn McKenna. Gish portrayed Anne Hampton, the doomed second wife of Rhett Butler, in 1994 in the TV mini series &quot;Scarlett&quot;. She starred in the 1989 comedy &quot;Shag&quot;, starring Bridget Fonda, Phoebe Cates, Page Hannah, Jeff Yagher and Scott Coffey.

In 1994&#x27;s &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, starring Kevin Costner, she played Urilla Sutherland, Wyatt&#x27;s childhood sweetheart and eventual wife. The next year, she appeared in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot; as Julie Nixon. In 1996, Gish played the girlfriend Tracey in &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot;. In 1997, Gish received her first starring role in a movie, portraying Susan Sparks opposite Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in the movie adaptation of DC Comics superhero &quot;Steel&quot;. In 1997, she starred in the TV movie &quot;True Women&quot; as Euphemia Ashby alongside Dana Delany and Angelina Jolie. In 1998, Gish starred in &quot;SLC Punk!&quot; as a head shop owner named Trish.

In 2001, Gish joined the cast of &quot;The X-Files&quot; as Special Agent Monica Reyes after series star David Duchovny announced his intention to leave the show. During the eighth and ninth seasons, Gish and fellow newcomer Robert Patrick became the show&#x27;s principal characters and it was presumed that the two could carry on the show even after Gillian Anderson left. While it is generally agreed their performances were good, ratings continued to drop with the departure of Duchovny and his dynamic partnership with Anderson; the ninth season of &quot;The X-Files&quot; became the show&#x27;s last until 2016.

She guest-starred on &quot;The West Wing&quot; playing Elizabeth Bartlet Westin, eldest daughter of President Josiah Bartlet (Martin Sheen), first appearing in 2003. In 2006, Gish played the role of Julia in the independent movie &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; and co-starred in &quot;Candles on Bay Street&quot; alongside Eion Bailey and Alicia Silverstone. The same year she landed a lead role in the Showtime drama &quot;Brotherhood&quot; as Eileen Caffee, and appeared in 29 of the 33 episodes in the series&#x27; three-season run.

Gish played Jo Noonan in the A&amp;E TV miniseries &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s Bag of Bones&quot; in 2011. Also in 2011, she played the role of Anne Sullivan, a mysterious therapist in &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;. In 2012, she made a guest appearance in twelfth season of the CBS crime drama &quot;&quot;. The same year she co-starred on the ABC drama pilot &quot;Americana&quot; as the mother of Ashley Greene&#x27;s character. However, the pilot was not picked up.

From 2013 to 2014, Gish was part of the main cast in the FX series &quot;The Bridge&quot;, in which she played Charlotte Millwright, a widow who discovers that her recently deceased husband had secrets on both sides of the US–Mexican border. She had a guest-starring role on &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; as Lt. Althea Jarry of the San Joaquin County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, in 2014. The following summer, it was announced Gish would return as Monica Reyes in the upcoming &quot;The X-Files&quot; revival, appearing in episode 6 of season 10, and reprising her role in the eleventh season. She co-starred with Kate Bosworth, Thomas Jane and Dash Mihok in the 2016 thriller film &quot;Before I Wake&quot;.

Gish appeared as drug lord Alice Sands in three episodes of the TNT series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot;, in 2016. Two years later she had a recurring role as the caretaker Mrs. Dudley in the Netflix series &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, based loosely off of Shirley Jackson&#x27;s novel of the same name. In 2021 she again teamed up with Mike Flanagan in the Netflix horror series, &quot;Midnight Mass&quot;.

==Humanitarian efforts==
Gish is a supporter of CARE International and, more recently, of Students Rebuild and One Million Bones. On behalf of these organizations, she filmed a short public service announcement video in April 2012. She is on the board of non-profit organization The Unusual Suspects Theatre Company.

==Personal life==
Despite persistent reports, Gish is not related to the early silent film actress sisters Lillian and Dorothy Gish. When Gish first became interested in acting, she wrote a letter to Lillian Gish, who replied by encouraging Annabeth to stay away from the business. Lillian wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s too much talent and not enough work in the movies!&quot;

Gish started dating &quot;The X-Files&quot; stunt man Wade Allen in December 2001. They married in October 2003 and have two children.

<doc id="1043493" wikidata="Q31976" url="?curid=1043493" title="Bruno Nettl">
<text>Bruno Nettl (March 14, 1930 – January 15, 2020) was an American ethnomusicologist and academic of Czech birth. A central figure of ethnomusicology, he was among the discipline&#x27;s most influential scholars. Nettl&#x27;s research interests varied widely; he wrote on music of the Blackfoot people, Iran, Southern India and particularly the scope and methods of ethnomusicology as a discipline. His lengthy teaching-career centered on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where his many students included Stephen Blum and Philip V. Bohlman.

==Early life and education==
Bruno Nettl was born on March 14, 1930 in Prague, then in Czechoslovakia, to a musical family. His father was (1889–1972), a well-known musicologist who researched Mozart as well as the connections between Czech, German and Jewish musical traditions. Among the elder Nettl&#x27;s work was the &quot;Handbuch der Musikgeschichte&quot; (1930) with Guido Adler, and the &quot;Beethoven Encyclopedia&quot; (1956). His mother, Gertrude (née Hutter) Nettl (1905–1952), was both a pianist and piano teacher. Bruno played violin in his youth, at one point in an orchestra under Kurt Weill. He also studied piano and took part in Dalcroze eurhythmics classes taught by his mother. Two childhood events galvanized an early interest in the study of music: at age six he heard his father&#x27;s student discuss his upcoming trip to India, saying &quot;much of the music [there is] improvised&quot;; later that year, his father captivated him with the &quot;Musiques de Oriente anthology&quot; compiled by Erich von Hornbostel, including music from across Asia.

The Nettl family, of Jewish descent, fled Europe in 1939 amid Nazi Germany&#x27;s occupation of Czechoslovakia. Nettl and his parents settled in the Princeton, New Jersey, US, while other family members fled worldwide; numerous Nettl relatives died during the Holocaust. His father taught at Princeton&#x27;s Westminster Choir College, and the family became American citizens in 1945. After attending high school in Princeton, the family moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where Nettl attended the Indiana University Bloomington (IU). From IU he would receive a Bachelor of Arts (1950), Master of Arts (1951) and PhD (1953), all in musicology. The latter PhD was in musicology, for which his thesis concerned the music of the Blackfeet people, under the advisement of George Herzog. This dissertation &quot;marked the first ever doctorate in the nascent field of ethnomusicology&quot;. He later received a second Masters in library science from University of Michigan.

==Career==
===Institutions and organizations===
Nettl&#x27;s career centered around the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where he a founded an ethnomusicology deprtment and taught from 1964 to 2011. He was gradually appointed higer positions at UIUC: Associate Professor of Music in 1964, Professor of Music and Anthropology in 1967, and Professor Emeritus of Music and Anthropology in 1992. Nettl rose UIUC&#x27;s ethnomusicology deparment to national eminence, with 6 full-time professors. His own course teachings included topics on folk music, improvisation, world music and the musics of the Czech Republic, Native Americans, and the Middle East. Although Nettl retired in 1992, he continued part-time teaching until 2011.

President of the Society for Ethnomusicology from 1969 to 1971, he held honorary doctorates from the University of Illinois, Carleton College, Kenyon College, and the University of Chicago. He was a recipient of the Fumio Koizumi Prize for ethnomusicology, and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music holds the Bruno Nettl Papers (1966–1988), which consists of administrative and personal correspondence while Nettl was a professor and head of the Musicology Division for the University of Illinois School of Music. Nettl received the first Taichi Traditional Music Award in 2012 from the China Conservatory of Music, and was named the 2014 Charles Homer Haskins Prize Lecturer by the American Council of Learned Societies.

===Scholarship===
Active principally in the field of ethnomusicology, Nettl&#x27;s scholarship covered many diverse musical traditions throughout the world. The musicologist Patricia Shehan Campbell described him as &quot;probably the field&#x27;s most prolific writer&quot;. By the reckoning of ethnomusicologist David McDonald, Nettl&#x27;s &quot;œuvre&quot; included at least 36 books and 137 articles. His research ranged from the music of Iran to music of South India and the music of Central Europe to the traditions of North America, particularly the music of the Native Americans. Other interests include folk music, improvisation in general, Slavic music urban musical cultures and the history and definition of ethnomusicology as a discipline. Nettl himself cited Blackfeet, Iranian, and Southern Indian music as his fields of expertise, having done fieldwork with all three cultures. He authored the article on music for &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;.

Native American music was the focus of Nettl&#x27;s early career, a typical subject for American ethnomusicologists of the mid-20th century. He did field research in Montana on the Blackfeet people&#x27;s music for his 1953 PhD dissertation; It was republished in 1954. Nettl applied the &quot;Kulturkreis&quot; anthropological theory to the topic, but later reflected on its faults: &quot;The idea was: each tribe had one musical style, and I would ignore other kinds of music in their repertory. No one cares much about this style of analysis now, but several people did follow up on my example and [...] I don’t think it works&quot;. Over three decades later Nettl published &quot;Blackfoot Musical Thought: Comparative Perspectives&quot; (1989).

Nettl&#x27;s research included the music of the Middle East, particularly that of Iran/Persia. He lived in the capital Tehran during the late 1960s and early 1970s, working alongside performers of Persian traditional music. This led to a 1972 monograph on the performance practice of Persian music, co-authored with Béla Foltin. For half a year, Nettl also did fieldwork in what is now Chennai, southern India.

McDonald remarked that Nettl&#x27;s &quot;most important research contributions, however, involved historicizing the discipline [of ethnomusicology] from its early origins to the present day.&quot; Nettl&#x27;s &quot;The Study of Ethnomusicology: Twenty-Nine Issues and Concepts&quot; (1983), later revised to &quot;Thirty-One Issues and Concepts&quot; (2005), is &quot;considered a classic in the field&quot;. He authored other surveys, such as the &quot;Theory and Method in Ethnomusicology&quot; (1964) and edited &quot;Comparative Musicology and Anthropology of Music&quot; (1991), alongside his student Philip V. Bohlman. From 1961–1965 and 1998–2002, Nettl edited the &quot;Ethnomusicology&quot; journal, also serving on an AMS advisory board for both American music publications, and the &quot;Garland Encyclopedia of World Music&quot;, as well as advising for the Detroit Monographs in Musicology and Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology.

==Legacy==
Nettl was a central figure in ethnomusicology. Musicologist Jeffrey Sposato, a colleague of Nettl, remarked that &quot;to describe Bruno as a giant in the field of ethnomusicology hardly does him justice. His work was seminal in establishing the discipline in the United States, both through his research and via the army of ethnomusicologists he has trained over the years&quot;. Several of Nettl&#x27;s students became important music scholars, Samuel Araujo, Carol Babiracki, Gérard Béhague, Virginia Danielson, Victoria Lindsay Levine, Ali Jihad Racy, Melinda Russell, Margaret Sarkissian, Stephen Slawek, Ted Solis, Christopher Waterman, and notably, Stephen Blum and Philip V. Bohlman.

Michael Beckerman concluded that &quot;Partially as a result of Bruno&#x27;s influence, Ethnomusicology has always been among the least pretentious fields in the humanities and social sciences, because after all, if one of the founders and leaders of the field is more interested in what is being studied than how he appears studying it, such a thing filters down to younger scholars&quot;.

==Personal life==
Nettl met his wife, the artist Wanda Maria White, while he was a student at Indiana University and the couple married in 1952. The couple founded an annual ethnomusicology lecture series aimed at a &quot;general academic audience&quot; in 2000: The Bruno and Wanda Nettl Distinguished Lecture in Ethnomusicology. They had two children, Rebecca and Gloria. His daughters continued living in Champaign in their adulthood.

Outside of music, Nettl enjoyed spending time with family, attending concerts, playing casual poker, baking and solving &quot;The New York Times&quot; crossword. He frequently wrote comedic verses for close friends and family; they were collected and published in the anthology &quot;Perverse at Eighty&quot; (2010), which included drawings by his daughter Gloria. He continued to publish prolifically until his death on January 15, 2020 in Urbana, Illinois, US.

<doc id="1043494" wikidata="Q1300162" url="?curid=1043494" title="Academic honor code">
<text>An academic honor code or honor system in the United States is a set of rules or ethical principles governing an academic community based on ideals that define what constitutes honorable behaviour within that community. The use of an honor code depends on the notion that people (at least within the community) can be trusted to act honorably. Those who are in violation of the honor code can be subject to various sanctions, including expulsion from the institution. or in other words, honor code is like a pledge taken by students to the effect that they will uphold academic integrity and ethical behavior and will not engage in any kind of cheating, stealing, and misrepresentation. One of the first such codes was created at the College of William &amp; Mary in the early 18th Century.

==US military service academies==

Presently, some of the most notable and most stringent honor codes exist at the Federal Service Academies and Senior Military Colleges.

The military academy honor codes not only govern the cadets and midshipmen&#x27;s lives at the academies but also are deemed essential to the development of military officers who are worthy of the public trust. As such, the codes are not limited merely to academic situations or to conduct on campus; cadets and midshipmen are expected to live by the codes&#x27; ethical standards at all times. The codes are as old as the academies themselves and simply state that cadets and midshipmen do not lie, cheat or steal, nor tolerate those who do. A single-sanction Honor Code, in which any offense results in expulsion regardless of severity, exists at Virginia Military Institute, which features a &quot;drum out&quot; ceremony which is still carried out upon a cadet&#x27;s dismissal. Outside of the military, Washington and Lee University has a single sanction code.

At three of the service academies and at Virginia Military Institute, anyone who learns of an honor code violation is required to report it. Failure to do so is considered &quot;toleration,&quot; which itself violates the code. That also holds true at schools with combined cadet and traditional student programs, such as Norwich University, Texas A&amp;M, and The Citadel, whose honor codes specifically provide that all students, both cadets and civilians, do not &quot;tolerate those who do.&quot; It is notable that the three Senior Military Colleges have two honor codes, one for cadets and one for civilians, whether on-campus or through distance online programs, etc. The Honor Concept of the Brigade of Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy allows the observer of an honor violation to confront the accused without formally reporting. It was found that it was more constructive at developing the honor of midshipmen. A non-toleration clause, on the other hand, is believed to make enemies of classmates. Additionally, it is thought that one&#x27;s true honor, if other than utmost, was not able to be formally remediated when hidden from public view. Under the academies&#x27; honor codes, violators can face severe punishment, up to being forwarded for expulsion by the Secretary of the Army, Navy, or Air Force.

Stringent honor codes, however, are not limited to military institutions. The all-male Hampden–Sydney College is reputed for an honor code system on a par with military systems, which extends to all student activities both on and off campus (off-campus violations can be prosecuted), and also like the military system, it considers tolerance of a violation itself a violation. Like the Naval Academy, however, those who witness a violation are encouraged to confront the violator and convince them to turn themselves in before resorting to reporting the violation. Another school with a very strict honor code is Brigham Young University. The university not only mandates honest behavior but also incorporates various aspects of Mormon religious law: drinking, smoking, drug use, premarital sex and same-sex relationships are all banned. Also, the code includes standards for dress and grooming. Men must be clean-shaven, and men and women cannot wear short shorts or other revealing clothing.

<doc id="1043506" wikidata="Q4603877" url="?curid=1043506" title="2004–2008 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens">
<text>The 2004–2008 volcanic activity of Mount St. Helens in Washington, United States has been documented as a continuous eruption in the form of gradual extrusion of magma. Starting in October 2004 and ceasing in January 2008, a new lava dome was built up. The new dome did not rise above the rim of the crater created by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

==2004 activity==
On September 23, 2004, around 2:00 a.m. PDT, Mount St. Helens experienced an earthquake swarm, with about 200 small (less than magnitude 1) earthquakes occurring less than one-half mile (one kilometer) below the 1980s lava dome. Activity increased, and on September 26, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network issued a &quot;notice of volcanic unrest&quot;, stating that a &quot;hazardous event&quot; was possible, and the U.S. Forest Service closed the mountain to all climbing. They also closed some trails in the area, due to the risk of debris flows from the possible melting of the Crater Glacier in the volcanic crater.

Seismic activity continued to accelerate following the USGS advisory, with earthquakes approaching magnitude 2.5 occurring at a rate of about four per minute on September 29, prompting the USGS and Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network to issue a second advisory, increasing the &quot;alert level&quot; to the second of three levels, and warn of an increased likelihood of a steam explosion or eruption from the lava dome within the next few days. Such an event was expected to be relatively small and not pose a threat to regions beyond the immediate area of the mountain. However, the intensities and occurrences of the earthquakes continued to rise. The largest earthquake recorded was a magnitude 3.3.

At 12:02p.m. PDT on October 1, 2004, the mountain erupted a plume of steam and volcanic ash about 9,700 feet (about 3 kilometers) into the air (according to pilot reports), from a vent in the then-unnamed Crater Glacier just southwest of the lava dome. The resulting ash plume was reported to have drifted south to Vancouver, Washington, Northern California and Wood Village, Oregon, dusting cars with a fine layer of black, sooty ash.

Mount St. Helens vented another plume of steam the next day at 12:14p.m. PDT, which was stronger than the previous steam release. A low-frequency harmonic tremor followed the steam release, which led seismologists to raise the &quot;alert level&quot; to the third of three levels, indicating a potential threat to life and property. Accordingly, the Johnston Ridge Observatory overlooking Mount St. Helens was evacuated; television media established their bases at Castle Lake Viewpoint about away, while tourists moved to various locations for several miles along State Route 504.

On October 3, low-frequency harmonic tremor activity began at around 3:00a.m. PDT and lasted for up to 90 minutes, which may have indicated the movement of magma beneath the mountain. The tremors were followed by a steam release at around 10:40a.m.

Mount St. Helens&#x27; eruptive activity continued over the following days, with steam releases occurring on October 4 at 9:47 a.m., 2:12p.m., and at 5:40p.m.; then again on the morning of October 5 at around 9:03a.m., with an ash plume that dusted Randle, Morton, and Packwood, Washington, towns on or near U.S. Route 12 about from the volcano. Between steam releases, elevated seismic activity on the mountain continued with the strongest tremors remaining near magnitude 3.0.

On October 6, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that the alert level was being lowered, saying &quot;We no longer think that an eruption is imminent in the sense of minutes or hours.&quot;

Magma reached the surface of the volcano around October 11, resulting in the building of a new lava dome on the existing dome&#x27;s south side. Dome building continued, with the USGS reporting in early November 2004 that magma was being extruded at a rate of 7 to 10 cubic meters per second. Had magma continued to extrude at this rate uninterrupted, the crater would have been completely filled and Mount St. Helens would have regained its former height in about eleven years. The Mount St. Helens VolcanoCam located at Johnston Ridge was able to view the new dome especially at night when the glow of new magma was visible via the camera&#x27;s infrared capabilities.

Included in the new dome was a feature dubbed the &quot;Whaleback&quot; (named such because of its close resemblance to the back of a whale), which was a lava spine, a long shaft of solidified magma being extruded by pressure of magma underneath it. This feature was very hot but fragile. The edges of it began crumbling rapidly, forming loose material around the new dome. The rate of crumbling soon matched the rate of growth, with the size of the whaleback remaining fairly constant.

==2005 activity==
On February 1, 2005, the new lava dome on Mount Saint Helens measured in elevation. This brought its elevation to above the 1980 crater floor, approximately above the surface of the Crater Glacier, and below the highest point of the volcano. The whaleback feature measured approximately in length and in width. The diameter of the new dome was about , and it contained about 50 million cubic yards (40 million cubic meters) of material. The total amount of glacier lost by this date was estimated to be 5–10%, but the flow of water from the crater was almost unchanged because the porous nature of the floor of the crater caused the water to be absorbed quickly.

Mount St. Helens experienced major activity again on March 8, 2005, at about 5:30p.m. PST, when a plume of steam and presumably ash was witnessed emerging from the volcano, accompanied by a tremor that measured about magnitude 2.5. The plume was visible from the metropolitan areas of Seattle, Washington, to Salem, Oregon, but only lasted for about 20–30 minutes. Ash was reported falling from the sky in Yakima, Washington, and surrounding areas. This activity was not considered a large eruption but merely a minor release of pressure consistent with the nature of dome building. Scientists believed it was triggered by a partial collapse of the lava dome. There was no increase in quake activity before the volcanic event.

By May 5, 2005, the highest point on the new dome was , below the highest point of the volcano. It contained approximately of material. Growth of the new dome continued steadily, and small earthquakes continued to be observed every few minutes. The whaleback feature disintegrated steadily but continued to be extruded as solidified lava pushed upward from below.

On July 2, 2005, the tip of the whaleback feature broke off, causing a rockfall that sent ash and dust several hundred meters into the air.

== 2006 activity ==
Following the collapse of the dome and whaleback, a new feature, termed the &quot;slab&quot;, began growing. Approximately the size of a football field, the large, cooled volcanic rock was being forced upward as quickly as per day, though the top part of the slab would usually collapse on a daily basis, under its own weight.

On July 21, 2006, the crater rim was reopened to hikers.

On December 19, 2006, an eruption sent a steam plume billowing over Washington.

== 2008 activity ==

After a relatively quiet 2007, on January 16, 2008, USGS geologist John S. Pallister spotted steam seeping from the lava dome in Mount St. Helens&#x27; crater. At approximately the same time, the Pacific Northwest Seismograph Network recorded a magnitude 2.9 earthquake, followed by a small tremor that lasted for nearly ninety minutes, and a magnitude 2.7 earthquake. But by the end of January, the lava dome growth had stopped. On July 10, 2008, it was determined that the eruption that began in 2004 had ended, after 5 months of inactivity.

<text>Robert William Geoffrey Gray (born 23 February 1945) is an Australian poet, freelance writer, and critic. He has been described as &quot;an Imagist without a rival in the English-speaking world&quot; and &quot;one of the contemporary masters of poetry in English&quot;.

==Biography==
Gray was born in Port Macquarie, grew up in Coffs Harbour and was educated in a country town on the north coast of New South Wales. He trained there as a journalist, and since then has worked in Sydney after settling in the 1970s as an editor, advertising copywriter, reviewer and buyer for bookshops. His first book of poems, &quot;Creekwater Journal&quot;, was published in 1973.

As a poet Gray is most notable for his keen visual imagery and intensely observed landscapes, known as a very skilful imagist. Les Murray has said about Gray, &quot;[he] has an eye, and the verbal felicity which must accompany such an eye. He can use an epithet and image to perfection and catch a whole world of sensory understanding in a word or a phrase.&quot; His wide reading in and experience of East Asian cultures and their varieties of Zen Buddhism is clear in many of the themes and forms he chooses to work in, including, for example haiku-style free verse works, nature style poetry, as well as discursive and narrative style poems, such as &quot;Diptych,&quot; (1984). Gray&#x27;s essentially Australian response to nature is reinforced by what he sees as a commonsensical Eastern view of man as within nature rather than an agent removable from, and capable of controlling nature. Martin Langford has written that Gray&#x27;s poetry captures the Australian ambivalence towards their own landscapes. &quot;No-one captures better that dual sense of our fascination with the physical world, and our dismay at its indifference.&quot; 
Gray has been a writer-in-residence at Meiji University in Tokyo and at several schools and universities throughout Australia including Geelong College in 1982. From February–March 2012, Gray lectured at Campion College in New South Wales.

He has won numerous awards including the Adelaide Arts Festival award and the New South Wales and Victorian Premiers&#x27; awards for poetry. In 1990 he received the Patrick White Award.

With Geoffrey Lehmann, he edited two anthologies, &quot;The Younger Australian Poets&quot; and &quot;Australian Poetry in the Twentieth Century&quot;, and he is the editor of &quot;Selected Poems&quot; by Shaw Neilson, and &quot;Drawn from Life&quot;, the journals of the painter John Olsen. 2008 saw the much anticipated publication of his memoir, &quot;The Land I Came Through Last&quot;.

In 2012 his collected poems was published under the title &quot;Cumulus&quot;. As with each of his poetic publications, it includes all that Gray wishes to preserve of his earlier poetry and many newer poems.

<doc id="1043547" wikidata="Q1053483" url="?curid=1043547" title="Colonne di San Lorenzo">
<text>The Colonne di San Lorenzo or Columns of San Lorenzo is a group of ancient Roman ruins, located in front of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in central Milan, region of Lombardy, northern Italy.

==History==
The colonnade, consisting mainly of 16 tall Corinthian columns in a row, now fronts an open square. In the 4th century, the columns were moved here, after removal from a likely 2nd century pagan temple or public bath house structure. South of the columns, one of the medieval gates still has some Roman marble decoration in place. In the 16th century, in preparations for a celebratory entrance into Milan of the monarch King Philip II of Spain, it was proposed to raze the colonnade to widen the route; Ferrante Gonzaga declined the suggestion.

Up until 1935, the space between the church and columns was entirely occupied by old houses abutting onto the façade of the church itself. Indeed, the church complex was fully surrounded by old houses. Despite the plans to conserve this ancient urban fabric, the renovations led to the demolition of the old houses and the isolation of the monument on the front side. Following bombing during World War II, the church complex became isolated also on the rear side, where the fenced Basilicas Park now stands, allowing popular views of the Basilica.

<text>South Gippsland Freeway is a short freeway linking Dandenong in Melbourne&#x27;s south–east to other south–eastern destinations, including the Mornington Peninsula and the Gippsland region. The freeway bears the designation M420.

==Route==
South Gippsland Freeway starts at the interchange with Monash Freeway in Endeavour Hills and runs south as a four-lane, dual-carriageway route, under the Princes Highway at Eumemmering, over the Pakenham railway line, then along the western border Hampton Park until it ends at the interchange with the South Gippsland and Western Port Highways in Lynbrook.

The standard travel time on the South Gippsland Freeway is 4 minutes (city-bound) and 3 minutes (Lynbrook-bound). The usual peak period travel time, is between 6–8 minutes. However, in times of extreme congestion or roadworks, including being residual due to an incident, the travel time can well exceed 10 minutes.

==History==
Plans for a &quot;Mulgrave By-pass Road and Eumemmerring By-pass Road&quot; had been made as far back as 1966, between Warrigal Road in Chadstone and Princes Highway at Eumemmerring. The freeway began as an overflow from construction of Mulgrave Freeway (now Monash Freeway) in 1970, where the freeway entered a sweeping turn south, crossed Eumemmerring Creek in Doveton and officially terminated at Princes Highway in Eumemmerring: this section opened in 1972 as Eumemmering Freeway, and was later renamed South Gippsland Freeway in April 1974. The freeway was extended 2.5 kilometres further south to terminate at the original alignment of the South Gippsland Highway where it met Pound Road in 1976.

The last extension 3.5 kilometres south connected Pound Road to Lyndhurst, where Lyndhurst Road (renamed Dandenong-Hastings Road not long afterwards) met the South Gippsland Highway. The highway&#x27;s old alignment was duplicated and upgraded into the new stretch of the freeway, and a new dual-carriageway alignment of the South Gippsland Highway was constructed approximately a kilometre to the freeway&#x27;s west. Pound Road was extended a few hundred metres west across a new bridge over the freeway, with Dandenong-bound ramps. Lyndhurst Interchange, where the freeway and the old and new alignments of the South Gippsland Highway met, was reconstructed to allow traffic to head south via an overpass above the realigned South Gippsland Highway to Dandenong-Hastings Road.

Extensions to the Mulgrave Freeway – renamed the South Eastern Arterial in 1988, subsuming the section between Doveton and Eumemmering – also resulted in heavier use of the South Gippsland Freeway. The bridge over Lyndhurst Interchange was duplicated with little fanfare in the late 1998s, leading to increased use of the road, mostly to semi-trailers and heavy freight to get to the docks in the Westernport district (Dandenong-Hastings Road was yet again renamed the Western Port Highway to reflect this and was eventually duplicated). Traffic levels dropped substantially when the Hallam bypass opened in 2003; the South Gippsland Freeway was extended back to its original terminus in Doveton at a new junction with the Monash Freeway.

In 2010, the Pound Road half-diamond interchange was substantially upgraded with a new four-lane carriageway being constructed over the freeway, the addition of traffic lights to the on-ramp intersection, and ramp metering signals. These works were completed late 2011.

In recent years, the freeway has become very busy, carrying high volumes of traffic off the South Gippsland Highway, Western Port Highway and the Pound Road and Princes Highway on-ramps. The freeway attracts all these vehicles, a large proportion of which are freight (hence two ramp metering sites inbound have a priority lane), due to the Monash Freeway which connects to it, being the major south-east freeway leading to Melbourne City. It is also the only freeway (or non-tollway, such as EastLink) to the city. It has led to slow or heavy traffic (inbound) during the morning peak and gets even more congested when the Monash Freeway is already heavy. Outbound is not so bad, although when very heavy traffic comes off the Monash Freeway (outbound), it can cause a bottleneck near and around the Princes Highway interchange, so a ramp signal site was installed to meter out traffic and reduce flow breakdown.

So, as part of the major 2007 M1 (Monash-CityLink-WestGate) Upgrade; which included widening to more lanes, updates to safety, electronic drive time signs and associated arterial road real-time information signs and a freeway management system with ramp metering (key component).
The freeway was also upgraded to include a Freeway Management System, from its start at the South Gippsland Highway interchange to the Monash Freeway junction. It added Ramp Metering signals to the South Gippsland Freeway / Pound Road / Princes Hwy (inbound) on-ramps (the outbound on-ramp already had an existing metering site). With this, it also included electronic real-time information signs on the three inbound on-ramps, showing travel times and flow conditions downstream from that respective location to either destinations on the Monash Freeway and/or South Gippsland Freeway. Therefore, it also included installation of hundreds of new in-road sensors on the freeway with associated access point poles, data stations and CCTV cameras. It is completely integrated with the M1 Monash Freeway.

===Timeline of development===
*1972: Mulgrave and Eumemmerring Freeways, total from Princes Highway, Eumemmerring to Stud Road, Dandenong North, opened by the Governor of Victoria Sir Rohan Delacombe, 21 November 1972, total cost A$6.8 million.
*1976: South Gippsland Freeway, dual carriageways completed between Princes Highway and Pound Road, Hampton Park, as well as the southbound carriageway to Dandenong-Hastings Road, opened 6 December 1976 at a cost of $12 million.
*1977/78: Northbound carriageway from Pound Road to Dandenong-Hastings Road completed.
*2011: Pound Road interchange reconstruction, opened late 2011.

===Road classification===
The freeway was signed Freeway Route 81 upon its opening in 1972, until its replacement with National Route 1 in 1988 (with a portion of it renamed to the South Eastern Arterial) until the Princes Highway in Eumemmering, and the remaining stretch between Eumemmering and Lyndhurst Interchange allocated Metropolitan Route 65. With Victoria&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in the late 1990s this was replaced by routes M1 and M420 respectively. When the Hallam bypass opened and route M1 reallocated along it in 2003, route M420 was officially extended north to the new junction with the Monash Freeway.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared South Gippsland Freeway (Freeway #1310) from Monash Freeway at Doveton to Western Port Highway in Lynbrook.

<text>The Kentucky Revised Statute 177.020(1) provides that the Department of Highways, a part of the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet, is responsible for the establishment and classification of a State Primary Road System which includes the state primary routes, interstate highways, parkways and toll roads, state secondary routes, rural secondary routes and supplemental roads. These routes are listed below.

== History ==

Kentucky began a numbered route system in the 1920s. Originally numbered so that odd numbers ran from north to south, increasing to the west and even numbers ran east to west, increasing to the south, this pattern was only followed for KY 1 through KY 100. Routes numbered KY 101 and higher are in sequential order as designated by the Department of Highways.

An exception to the pattern for highways numbered 1 through 100 is New Circle Road, a circular bypass around Lexington that is also numbered as KY 4. KY 4 was previously located elsewhere.

<doc id="1043551" wikidata="Q7902830" url="?curid=1043551" title="Utility (patentability requirement)">
<text>In United States patent law, utility is a patentability requirement. As provided by , an invention is &quot;useful&quot; if it provides some identifiable benefit and is capable of use and &quot;useless&quot; otherwise. The majority of inventions are usually not challenged as lacking utility, but the doctrine prevents the patenting of fantastic or hypothetical devices such as perpetual motion machines.

The patent examiners guidelines require that a patent application expresses a specific, credible, and substantial utility. Rejection by an examiner usually requires documentary evidence establishing a &quot;prima facie&quot; showing that there is no specific, substantial, and credible utility.

The main reason for having the utility requirement is to prevent issuing patents on things which are speculative and may block useful inventions in the future. In a pharmaceutical context, the utility problem usually arises when there is a patent claim on a new drug, but the patent disclosure does not specify (or does not prove) what disease this drug treats. Notably, a full FDA approval of the drug is not required before a patent application is filed. It suffices to demonstrate that this drug candidate passes some established in vitro test (see below). 

One commentator explained in 1853 the rationale against &quot;useless inventions&quot; as:

A patent for a useless invention is thought by some to be void at common law by others by force of the Statute of Monopolies which renders void grants of privileges which tend to the hurt of trade or are generally inconvenient. Now if a monopoly were allowed in a useless invention other persons would be prevented from improving it or turning it to any account whatever so that combinations of utility might be impeded. It would stand in the way of real inventors and hence be mischievous to the public generally.
European patent law and Patent Cooperation Treaty instead of &quot;utility&quot; use the term industrial applicability. Although it serves a similar purpose as the US &quot;utility&quot; and patentable subject matter requirements, it is more narrow in practice.

== Utility criteria ==
In considering the requirement of utility for patents, there are three main factors to review: operability of the invention, a beneficial use of the invention, and practical use of the invention.

===Operability===
The importance of operability as a requirement of claims is disputed.

Janice Mueller claims that an inoperable invention may fail to satisfy the enablement requirement under 35 U.S.C. § 112 because &quot;an inventor cannot properly describe how to use an inoperable invention...&quot; However, as authority Ms. Mueller&#x27;s textbook cites to another textbook, Landis on Mechanics of Patent Claim Drafting, which itself cites section 2173.05(l) in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure. Section 2173.05(l) has not been part of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure since the 1990s. The most recent pronouncement of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure is 2107.01:

Situations where an invention is found to be &quot;inoperative&quot; and therefore lacking in utility are rare, and rejections maintained solely on this ground by a Federal court even rarer. In many of these cases, the utility asserted by the applicant was thought to be &quot;incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art, or factually misleading&quot; when initially considered by the Office. ... Other cases suggest that on initial evaluation, the Office considered the asserted utility to be inconsistent with known scientific principles or &quot;speculative at best&quot; as to whether attributes of the invention necessary to impart the asserted utility were actually present in the invention. ... However cast, the underlying finding by the court in these cases was that, based on the factual record of the case, it was clear that the invention could not and did not work as the inventor claimed it did. Indeed, the use of many labels to describe a single problem (e.g., a false assertion regarding utility) has led to some of the confusion that exists today with regard to a rejection based on the &quot;utility&quot; requirement.

===Beneficial utility===
Beneficial utility became established as a requirement in United States patent law in 1817 as a result of &quot;Lowell v. Lewis&quot; (1 Mason. 182; 1 Robb, Pat. Cas. 131 Circuit Court, D. Massachusetts. May Term. 1817.). The utility criterion established by this case is, as Justice Joseph Story wrote in the Court&#x27;s decision, that, to be patentable, an invention must be &quot;useful&quot; and must &quot;not be frivolous or injurious to the well-being, good policy, or sound morals of society&quot;. In spite of this ruling however, patents continued to be granted for devices that could be deemed immoral (e.g. gambling devices, see, e.g., Brewer v. Lichtenstein and &quot;Ex parte Murphy&quot;) or deceitful (see, &quot;Juicy Whip, Inc. v. Orange Bang, Inc.&quot; (dealing with a juice dispenser that arguably deceived the public into believing that the liquid seen in the attached reservoir was that which was being dispensed)). In &quot;Juicy Whip&quot;, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit put an end to the requirement: &quot;Congress never intended that the patent laws should displace the police powers of the States, meaning by that term those powers by which the health, good order, peace and general welfare of the community are promoted…we find no basis in section 101 to hold that inventions can be ruled unpatentable for lack of utility simply because they have the capacity to fool some members of the public.&quot;(Juicy Whip Inc. v. Orange Bang Inc., 185 F.3d 1364, 1367–68, 51 USPQ2d 1700, 1702-03 (Fed. Cir. 1999), see also Manual of Patent Examining Procedure 706.03(a)(II))

===Practical utility===
The last utility category is practical or specific utility. According to Mueller, &quot;to be patentable an invention must have some real-world use.&quot; The utility threshold is relatively easy to satisfy for mechanical, electrical, or novelty inventions, because the purpose of the utility requirement is to ensure that the invention works on some minimal level. However, the practical or specific utility requirement for patentability may be more difficult to satisfy for chemical or biological inventions, because of the level of uncertainty in these fields. The United States Supreme Court in &quot;Brenner v. Manson&quot; (in 1966) held that a novel process for making a known steroid did not satisfy the utility requirement, because the patent applicants did not show that the steroid served any practical function. The Court ruled, &quot;... a process patent in the chemical field, which has not been developed and pointed to the degree of specific utility, creates a monopoly of knowledge which should be granted only if clearly commanded by the statute.&quot; Practical or specific utility is the requirement for an invention to have a particular purpose.

==History and development==
The very first US Patent Act of 1790 required patentable inventions to be &quot;sufficiently useful and important&quot;. An 1817 case &quot;Lowell v. Lewis&quot; (Circuit Court, D. Massachusetts) proclaimed that: &quot;the word &quot;useful,&quot; therefore, is incorporated into the [Patent] act in contradistinction to mischievous or immoral.&quot; This very broad definition survived well into the Twentieth Century. It was the basis for the &quot;beneficial utility&quot; doctrine, which excludes from patentability anything immoral or deceitful. 
However, in the 1970&#x27;s after cases establishing patentability of a slot machine in 1977, and drink machines with decorative reservoirs that did not contain the drink actually dispensed, the United States Patent and Trademark Office and federal courts no longer consider beneficial utility nor the deceitful or immoral qualities of inventions. 

However, it is not only &quot;mischievous or immoral&quot; inventions, that fase the utility challenge. Oftentimes new chemicals, which are known to be useful as a class, but have not demonstrated a &quot;specific, substantial and credible utility&quot; are denied a patent. The landmark decision in this area is 1966 Brenner v. Manson. In this case, the SCOTUS concluded that a new steroid was not &quot;useful&quot; in the meaning of the patent law, because it had no defined use at the time of the application. &quot;A patent is not a hunting license,&quot; the Court stated. It is &quot;not a reward for the search, but compensation for [the search&#x27;s] successful conclusion.&quot; This standard for utility cannot be met until a &quot;specific benefit exists in currently available form.&quot; 

On the same day as Brenner v. Manson, the Court decided two other cases In re Kirk and In re Joly. These cases denied patentability to chemical intermediates for products, which had no known use.

In 1955 United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in &quot;In re Brana &quot;clarified, that &quot;utility&quot; requirement for pharmaceutical inventions does not require formal approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Instead an in vitro proof of efficacy, using a known test is sufficient. 

In 1995, the USPTO published new utility guidelines, which eliminated the &quot;substantial&quot;, but retained “specific” and “credible” requirements. In the case of a process of making chemicals, the utility of the process can be established only if a product of this process has a utility. Thus, a process resulting only in products, which have no known use, is not patentable.

Another landmark decision related to utility of biological inventions was 2005 case In re Fisher. It denied patentability of express sequence tags (which are “tiny portion[s] of an entire gene that can be used to help identify unknown genes and to map their positions within a genome”), because their only known use at the time of patent application was as a research tool.

The utility of invention must be demonstrated in the patent application itself. Post application activities cannot be used to prove utility.

==Burden of proof during prosecution==
During patent prosecution, the disclosed utility is presumed valid. The patent office bears the burden to disprove utility. The standard the USPTO uses is whether it is more likely than not that it would lack utility from the perspective of a person having ordinary skill in the art. If the examiner shows evidence that the invention is not useful, the burden shifts to the applicant to prove utility. The applicant can then submit additional data to support a finding of utility. The invention must possess utility at the time of application.

<doc id="1043554" wikidata="Q3077968" url="?curid=1043554" title="Fort Ontario">
<text>Fort Ontario is an American historic bastion fort situated by the City of Oswego in Oswego County, New York. It is owned by the state of New York and operated as a museum known as Fort Ontario State Historic Site. Fort Ontario is located on the east side of the Oswego River on high ground overlooking Lake Ontario.

==18th century==

Fort Ontario was one of several forts erected by the British to protect the area around the east end of Lake Ontario. The original Fort Ontario was erected in 1755, during the French and Indian War, in order to bolster defenses already in place at Fort Oswego on the opposite side of the river. At that time its name was the &quot;Fort of the Six Nations,&quot; but the fort was destroyed by French forces during the Battle of Fort Oswego in 1756 and rebuilt by British forces in 1759.

At the conclusion of Pontiac&#x27;s War, Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25, 1766.

During the American Revolutionary War, a detachment from the 3rd New York Regiment destroyed the fort in July, 1778, after the British abandoned it. The British returned and rebuilt the fort in 1782. There was an aborted attack on the fort by Colonel Marinus Willet in 1783. The British held the fort after the war was over until 1796 after the signing of Jay&#x27;s Treaty.

==19th century==
The fort was attacked and destroyed by British forces during the War of 1812 in the year 1814. After a period of disuse, new construction was undertaken in part because of tensions with Great Britain as well as to check smuggling activities between Canada and the United States.

During the American Civil War the new construction began at the fort because of fear of British help from Canada to the Confederacy. After the American Civil War it held Company F, 42nd Infantry which consisted of wounded soldiers from the war that had reenlisted in the U.S. Army. Although the fort remained a military base, the fort itself fell into ruin, since funds were used to create more modern quarters outside the fort.

==20th century==
When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, the fort was repurposed as a military hospital, known as General Hospital No. 5. The facility was used to train medical personnel before they were posted to France.

In 1921, the fort again became an infantry base, initially the 28th Infantry Regiment and in 1933, the 2nd Brigade of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division called Fort Ontario home until the brigade was deactivated on June 1, 1940. During this period, some of the historic buildings inside the fort were restored and a golf course was laid out on the grassy ramparts.

In 1940, the fort was refurbished as an induction center for new conscripts with 60 new buildings for 3,000 men, but it was used instead as a base for several National Guard anti-aircraft units. As America entered World War II, Fort Ontario was repurposed again as a training center for African American 
military police. 

Later in the war, the fort was home to 982 Jewish refugees, from August 1944 to February 1946. The Fort Ontario Emergency Refugee Shelter was the only attempt by the United States to shelter Jewish refugees during the war. After the end of the war the refugees were kept in internment because of disagreements concerning whether or not to allow them to become United States citizens. In January 1946, the decision was made to allow them to become citizens, and by February all of the Jewish refugees were allowed to leave Fort Ontario.

== Current use ==
Although closed by the U.S. Army after World War II, some of the buildings at Fort Ontario are still used for training by the Army Reserve.

The restored fort is open to the public as a state historic site. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. In 2010, Fort Ontario was one of the state-funded historical sites named by Governor David Paterson as being potentially unfunded because of the budget crisis faced by New York State. In response, many of the citizens of Oswego and students of the State University of New York at Oswego have joined together in support of the historical site.

The Safe Haven Holocaust Refugee Shelter Museum operates in a building south of the fort.

==Description==

The present fortifications are built on a pentagonal plan with five bastions, similar to the layout of Fort Jackson, Louisiana. It was designed for heavy cannon mounted &quot;en barbette&quot; (i.e. in the open firing over the parapet), but howitzers were mounted in casemates built into the ramparts of the bastions. The stone-faced scarp walls of the bastions were also pierced with loopholes for rifle fire, which are of varying design, reflecting the preferences of the different engineers overseeing the construction. Originally, a ravelin protected the side of the fort facing Lake Ontario and mounted further heavy guns.

The current layout of the fort includes Officer Quarters #1, the Powder Magazine, the Enlisted Men&#x27;s Barracks, the Storehouse, and Officer Quarters #2. There are also two guardhouses by the entrance of the tunnel to the main entrance.

<doc id="1043557" wikidata="Q1185084" url="?curid=1043557" title="Novelty (patent)">
<text>Novelty is one of the patentability requirements for a patent claim, whose purpose is to prevent issuing patents on known things, i.e. to prevent public knowledge from being taken away from the public domain.

An invention is anticipated (i.e. not new) and therefore not patentable if it was known to the public before the priority date of the patent application. Although the concept of &quot;novelty&quot; in patent law appears simple and self-explanatory, this view is very far from reality. Some of the most contentious questions of novelty comprise:

# inventor&#x27;s own prior disclosures (only a few countries provide a grace period, most notably, 1 year in the US);
# new uses of known things, such as pharmaceuticals;
# a broader question of (2) is inherent anticipation;
# patenting things, which are newly discovered in (or isolated from) nature (see Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.) This question overlaps with patentable subject matter.

==Definition==
Novelty is requirement for a patent claim to be patentable. In contrast, if an invention was known to the public before filing a patent application, or before its date of priority, if the priority of an earlier patent application is claimed, the invention is not considered new and therefore not patentable.

To assess the novelty of an invention, a search through what is called the prior art is usually performed, the term &quot;art&quot; referring to the relevant technical field. A prior art search is generally performed with a view to proving that the invention is &quot;not new&quot; or old. No search can possibly cover every single publication or use on earth, and therefore cannot prove that an invention is &quot;new&quot;. A prior art search may for instance be performed using a keyword search of large patent databases, scientific papers and publications, and on any web search engine. However, it is impossible to guarantee the novelty of an invention, even once a patent has been granted, since some little known publication may have disclosed the claimed invention.

==Rationale==

A patent grants an inventor a legally enforceable monopoly over their invention. This means that others can be legally restrained from exploiting the invention. It is not the intention of the patent system to deny anyone what they have been free to do before someone claims an invention. For example, one cannot patent the wheel, as that would exclude others from doing what they had previously been free to do. The legal test is that the invention must be something new, i.e. it must possess &quot;novelty&quot;. The invention of the wheel is not new, because the wheel already forms part of the prior art.

==Specific concepts==

===Inventor&#x27;s own disclosures===
In some countries, such as the Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Russia, United States, a grace period exists for protecting an inventor or their successor in title from authorised or unauthorised disclosure of the invention before the filing date. That is, if the inventor or the successor in title publishes the invention, an application can still be validly filed which will be considered novel despite the publication, provided that the filing is made during the grace period following the publication. The grace period is usually 6 or 12 months. In China, the grace period is 6 months. In Russia, the grace period is 6 months (Civil Code part IV, article 1350 (3)). In US, the grace period is 12 months (&quot;Leahy-Smith America Invents Act&quot;)

In other countries, such as in EPO members, any act that makes an invention available to the public, no matter where in the world, before the filing date or priority date has the effect of barring the invention from being patented. Examples of acts that can make an invention available to the public are written publications, sales, public oral disclosures and public demonstrations or use.

The grace period should not be confused with the priority year defined by Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. The priority year starts when the first filing in a contracting state of the Paris Convention is made, while the grace period starts from the pre-filing publication.

Local novelty only regards publications, uses or sales that have taken place within that jurisdiction to be novelty destroying.

===Novelty in a discovery of a product of nature===

Another controversial issue in novelty analysis is whether a discovery and isolation of a product of nature should be patentable. In 1911, Billings Learned Hand, who had been only 2 years in his position as a judge, &quot;had made an uninformed mistake in Parke-Davis v. Mulford&quot; by pronouncing that naturally occurring adrenaline can be patented in its pure form. This judicial tradition, allowing patenting of isolated natural products in the US, continued for over 100 years. Another notable example of it was &quot;In re Bergstrom&quot;, where a court reversed the Patent Office’s refusal to patent on prostaglandins. In &quot;Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.&quot; (1991) and &quot;Schering Corp. v. Amgen Inc&quot; (2000), courts confirmed patentability of recombinant DNA molecules, which encode known proteins.

The practice of patenting isolated products of nature came to an end only in 2013, when the SCOTUS decided in &quot;Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.&quot; that an isolated product of Nature (a DNA sequence in that case) does not deserve a composition-of-matter claim. At the same time, the Court decided that complementary DNA, which is produced by reverse transcription of messenger RNA and does not contain introns, can be patentable. It is worth noting, that the denial of patentability in this case was not based on novelty, but rather on subject matter eligibility.

===Anticipation===
Anticipation refers to advance use or disclosure of an otherwise-patentable invention, thereby undermining its novelty. The United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords referred to &quot;anticipation&quot; as &quot;convenient&quot; terminology to cover &quot;that part of the state of art which is inconsistent with the invention being new&quot;. Anticipation and infringement are two sides of the same coin:
that which anticipates earlier in time would infringe later in time.

===Point of novelty===
Point of novelty is a term used in patent law to distinguish those elements or limitations in a patent claim that are conventional or known from those elements or limitations that are novel, i.e. not conventional or known. That part of the invention may also be termed its &quot;point of departure from the prior art&quot;. The term is also applied to a patentability test – the point of novelty test – which determines patentability (usually, obviousness) by considering the point(s) of novelty after dissecting out the conventional part.

In a Jepson claim, the conventional parts of the claim elements are placed in a preamble, such as &quot;In a grease gun comprising a cylinder enclosing a piston longitudinally movable in said cylinder, said cylinder having a nozzle at a distal end thereof&quot;, which is followed by a transitional phrase such as &quot;the improvement comprising&quot;, which is followed by a recitation of the element or elements constituting the point of novelty, such as &quot;said nozzle having a fluted opening at a distal end thereof&quot;.

A conceptual problem may arise in applying the point of novelty method of analysis when the elements at the point of novelty cooperate or co-act with the conventional elements or part of them in a novel way. The novel co-action is properly considered part of the point of novelty of the invention and should therefore properly be recited &quot;after&quot; the transitional phrase.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit formerly used the point of novelty test for design patents as the basis of a patent infringement analysis, but the court recently abandoned that test in &quot;Egyptian Goddess, Inc. v. Swisa, Inc.&quot; The Federal Circuit has at times criticized use of the point of novelty test in obviousness analysis, but the Supreme Court has continued to use a point of novelty test for obviousness. In &quot;Parker v. Flook&quot; the Supreme Court analyzed patent-eligibility (statutory subject matter) under a point of novelty test, citing &quot;Neilson v. Harford&quot; and &quot;O&#x27;Reilly v. Morse&quot; as authority, but in &quot;Diamond v. Diehr&quot;, the Court used the opposite approach. Then in &quot;Mayo v. Prometheus&quot; and &quot;Alice v. CLS Bank&quot; the Supreme Court went back to the test of the &quot;Flook&quot; case.

Present-day American patent law still acknowledges that some parts of a patent claim may constitute &quot;insignificant post-solution activity&quot;. This is regarded as a kind of &quot;point of novelty&quot; approach, disallowed under present (Federal Circuit) patent law. To combat infringement, truly &quot;insignificant&quot; elements are routinely kept out of patent claims. The purpose of the patent-eligibility doctrine concerning insignificant post-solution activity, however, is that adding such limitations to a claim does not involve adding an &quot;inventive concept&quot; to the otherwise ineligible underlying idea.

The &quot;contribution approach&quot; in European patent law is similar to the American &quot;point of novelty&quot; approach. It is supposed to be invalid, but it is still being applied under various guises in order to avoid counter-intuitive results.

==Jurisdictions==

=== Canada ===

In Canada, the requirements for novelty are codified under section 28.2 of the Patent Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. P-4):
The section does not restrict disclosure to prior patents, giving a broad description of what includes prior disclosure; so long as the subject-matter was disclosed “in such manner that the subject-matter became available to the public”, the subject-matter is barred from being patented. This may include prior patents, publications or the invention itself being put on display. Disclosures in a private document, such as an internal memo that is not available to the public, do not count.

There is an eight-pronged test to determine whether anticipation occurs in Canada. The prior art must:
#give an exact prior description; 
#give directions which will inevitably result in something within the claims; 
#give clear and unmistakable directions; 
#give information which for the purpose of practical utility is equal to that given by the subject patent; 
#convey information so that a person grappling with the same problem must be able to say &quot;that gives me what I wish&quot;; 
#give information to a person of ordinary knowledge so that he must at once perceive the invention; 
#in the absence of explicit directions, teach an &quot;inevitable result&quot; which &quot;can only be proved by experiments&quot;; and 
#satisfy all these tests in a single document without making a mosaic.
The current test now requires that only 1 of the 8 tests be fulfilled in order to find anticipation.

=== European Patent Convention===

Under the European Patent Convention (EPC), European patents shall be granted for inventions which, among other things, are new. The central legal provision governing the novelty under the EPC is .

=== United States ===

In the United States the four most common ways in which an inventor will be barred under Section 102 are: 

# by making the invention known or allowing the public to use the invention; or
# having the invention published in a fixed medium (such as in a patent, patent application, or journal article); or
# if the invention was previously invented in the U.S. by another, who has not abandoned, suppressed, or concealed the invention, or
# if the invention was described in a patent application filed by another, where the application later issues as a US patent.

In U.S. patent law, a claim lacks novelty, and &quot;anticipation&quot; occurs when one prior art reference or event discloses all the features of a claim and enables one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the invention. The term &quot;features&quot; in this context refers to the elements of art of the claim or its &quot;limitations&quot; as explained in the all elements rule.

A prior art reference must not only disclose every feature of a claim, but must also disclose the features arranged or combined in the same way as the claim.

<text>Thomas Knoll is an American software engineer who created Adobe Photoshop. He initiated the development of image processing routines in 1988. After Knoll created the first core routines, he showed them to his brother, John Knoll, who worked at Industrial Light and Magic. John liked what he saw, suggested new features, and encouraged Tom to bundle them into a package with a graphical user interface. In 1988, John sold the distribution license for Photoshop to Adobe Systems and later on March 31, 1995, he sold the rights to the program to Adobe for $34.5 million.

Thomas Knoll was the lead developer until version CS4, and currently contributes to work on the Camera Raw plug-in to process raw images from cameras.

Knoll was born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and graduated from the University of Michigan.

His last name also graces an elementary school in Ann Arbor, Michigan founded by his wife in 1995 called Summers-Knoll School.

In 2016 Thomas (alongside with his brother John) were inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

At the 2019 Oscars, Thomas and his brother John were awarded a Scientific and Engineering Award for the original architecture, design and development of Photoshop.

<doc id="1043565" wikidata="Q7144533" url="?curid=1043565" title="Patentability">
<text>Within the context of a national or multilateral body of law, an invention is patentable if it meets the relevant legal conditions to be granted a patent. By extension, patentability also refers to the substantive conditions that must be met for a patent to be held valid.

== Requirements ==
The patent laws usually require that, for an invention to be patentable, it must be:
* Patentable subject matter, i.e., a kind of subject-matter eligible for patent protection (also called &quot;statutory patentable subject-matter&quot;)
* Novel (i.e. at least some aspect of it must be new)
* Non-obvious (in United States patent law) or involve an inventive step (in European patent law and under the Patent Cooperation Treaty)
* Useful (in U.S. patent law) or be susceptible of industrial application (in European patent law)

Usually the term &quot;patentability&quot; only refers to the four aforementioned &quot;substantive&quot; conditions, and does not refer to formal conditions such as the &quot;sufficiency of disclosure&quot;, the &quot;unity of invention&quot; or the &quot;best mode requirement&quot;.

Judging patentability is one aspect of the official examination of a patent application performed by a patent examiner and may be tested in post-grant patent litigation.

Prior to filing a patent application, inventors sometimes obtain a patentability opinion from a patent agent or patent attorney regarding whether an invention satisfies the substantive conditions of patentability.

== Opposition and reexamination ==

Many national and regional patent offices provide procedures for reconsidering whether or not a given patent is valid after grant. Under the European Patent Convention, any person can file an opposition provided they act promptly after the patent is granted. In the United States, members of the public can initiate reexamination proceedings. Japan provides similar options. In India, the Patent Act provides for a dual opposition system i.e. pre-grant opposition as well as post grant opposition. While a pre-grant opposition may be filed by any person, the post grant opposition may only be filed by a person interested in the field of invention.

Members of the public can also initiate lawsuits in the courts of various nations to have patents declared invalid.

United Kingdom patents can be reviewed by way of a non-binding opinion issued by the Patent Office, or by formal applications for revocation before the Patent Office or the Court. If the patent survives a revocation action, this fact is noted for future reference by way of a Certificate of contested validity.

== Infringement ==

The fact that an invention is patentable or even patented does not necessarily mean that use of the invention would not also infringe another patent. The first patent in a given area might include a broad claim covering a general inventive concept if there is at that point no relevant prior art. Later, a specific implementation of that concept might be patentable if it is not disclosed in the earlier patent (or any intervening prior art), but nevertheless still falls within the scope of the earlier claim (covering the general concept). This means that the later inventor must obtain a license from the earlier inventor to be able to exploit their invention. At the same time, the earlier inventor might want to obtain a license from the later inventor, particularly if the later invention represents a significant improvement in the implementation of the original broad concept. In this case, the two enter into a cross license.

Thomas Edison&#x27;s thin carbon filament light bulb was a patentable improvement over the earlier patented Woodward and Evans thick carbon filament light bulb. Thomas Edison bought the Woodward patent for $5,000 US before he began his development work so that Woodward would not be able to later sue him for patent infringement after Edison became commercially successful.

== National laws ==
=== United States ===

Under United States patent law, inventorship is also regarded as a patentability criterion. It is a constitutional requirement, since the language of the US Constitution authorizes &quot;the exclusive Right to their ... Discoveries&quot; to Inventors only. The most significant implication of this requirement, which makes the US practice different from all other countries, is the fact that only actual people-inventors (and not their employer) can apply for a US patent. For this reason, patent applications filed via the Patent Cooperation Treaty often have two sets of applicants: the physical individuals for the US, and the legal entity (employer) for all other countries.

The requirement to list actual human inventors was further confirmed by case law: &quot;Inventorship is indeed relevant to patentability under 35 U.S.C. § 102(f), and patents have in the past been held unenforceable for failure to correctly name inventors in cases where the named inventors acted in bad faith or with deceptive intent.&quot;

Another difference between the practices of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and other patent offices is the requirements for non-obviousness and for inventive step. Although both requirements have the same purpose to prevent patent issuance for routine improvements/modifications (rather than for true inventions), the practical analyses of these criteria are based on different rules and sometimes result in different outcomes (see Inventive step and non-obviousness for more details).

Details on patentability in the U.S. can be found in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure or MPEP. This is published by the USPTO and is the reference manual used by both patent examiners and patent agents/attorneys. Chapter 2100, in particular, gives a comprehensive overview of the standards for patentability, a discussion of the related case law, and guidance on how to overcome an examiner&#x27;s rejection of a given set of claims.

In the United States, the patent grant is presumptive, e.g. a patent shall issue unless the patent statutes preclude the grant. In other words, the burden is on the Patent Office to prove why a patent should not be granted. Once a patent issues, it is presumed valid and a court may declare it invalid only on the basis of clear and convincing evidence.

=== Europe ===
Terminology in Europe, within the member states of the European Patent Organisation, is slightly different from U.S. terminology. While in the U.S. all patent applications are considered to cover inventions automatically, in Europe a patent application is first submitted to a test whether it covers an invention at all: the first out of four tests of (the other three being novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability). So an &quot;invention&quot; in European legal terminology is similar to &quot;patentable subject-matter&quot; in the American system. Articles 52-57 of the European Patent Convention are concerned with patentability.

=== India ===
Under the Indian Patent Act (1970), &quot;inventions&quot; are defined as a new product or process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application. Thus the patentability criteria largely involves novelty, inventive step and industrial application or usability of the invention. In addition, section 3 of the Patent Act, 1970, also provides a list of non-patentable inventions for e.g. inventions that are frivolous or contrary to well established to natural laws.

== Quotes ==

:&quot;[The question whether there is a patentable invention] is as fugitive, impalpable, wayward, and vague a phantom as exists in the whole paraphernalia of legal concepts. It involves, or it should involve, as complete a reconstruction of the art that preceded it as is possible. The test of invention is the originality of the discovery, and discovery depends upon the mental act of conceiving the new combination, for substantially every invention is only a combination. Nothing is more illusory, as nothing is more common, than to assume that this can be measured objectively by the magnitude of the physical readjustments required. Courts never tire, or at least in earlier times they never did, of expatiating upon the freshness of insight which observes a little, but fruitful, change which had theretofore escaped detection by those engaged in the field. When all is said, we are called upon imaginatively to project this act of discovery against a hypostatized average practitioner, acquainted with all that has been published and all that has been publicly sold. If there be an issue more troublesome, or more apt for litigation than this, we are not aware of it. (...)&quot;
::- US Judge Learned Hand in &quot;Harries v. Air King Prod. Co.&quot;, 183 F.2d 158, 162 (2d Cir. 1950).

<doc id="1043580" wikidata="Q1195290" url="?curid=1043580" title="Korokke">
<text>Korokke (; ) is a Japanese deep-fried &quot;yōshoku&quot; dish originally related to a French dish, the croquette. Korokke is made by mixing cooked chopped meat, seafood, or vegetables with mashed potato or white sauce, usually shaped like a flat patty, rolling it in wheat flour, eggs, and Japanese-style breadcrumbs, then deep-frying this until brown on the outside.

== History ==

In 1887, the French croquette was introduced to Japan. It is thought that the &quot;korokke&quot; using mashed potatoes was invented because dairy processing technology had not been popularized in Japan at that time. The first mention of a &quot;kuroketto&quot; appears in cookery books from the Meiji era.

&quot;Korokke&quot; can be found in almost every supermarket and convenience store in Japan and enjoyed for its taste and its low cost.

&quot;Korokke&quot; became associated with typhoons in the 2000s, after a user on 2channel said they were eating some to prepare for an approaching typhoon, beginning a tradition that persisted on Japanese social media.

== Varieties ==

There are numerous types of &quot;korokke&quot; depending on the main ingredient or the ingredient mixed and they are generally named &quot;(ingredient) korokke&quot;. 
* Potato &quot;korokke&quot; - &quot;korokke&quot; made using potatoes 
* Meat &quot;korokke - korokke&quot; made with ground meat and potatoes. If made with meat only, it is menchi-katsu. 
* Tuna &quot;korokke - korokke&quot; with tuna
* &quot;Yasai&quot; (vegetable) &quot;korokke&quot; - &quot;korokke&quot; with mixed vegetables
* Curry &quot;korokke&quot; - curry-flavored &quot;korokke&quot;
* &quot;Kabocha&quot; (pumpkin) &quot;korokke&quot; - &quot;korokke&quot; made using pumpkins
* Okara &quot;korokke&quot; - &quot;korokke&quot; made using okara 
* Cream &quot;korokke&quot; - &quot;korokke&quot; made with white sauce
* &quot;Guratan korokke&quot; - &quot;korokke&quot; with white sauce and macaroni 
&quot;Korokke&quot; are sometimes sold wrapped in paper. They may also be used as a topping for other dishes. When sandwiched between two slices of bread, they are called &quot;korokke pan&quot; (pan being &#x27;bread&#x27; in Japanese), or &quot;korokke sando&quot; (&#x27;sandwich&#x27;). &quot;Gurakoro&quot; is a product introduced by the Japanese McDonald&#x27;s which is made by sandwiching &quot;guratan korokke.&quot;

== In other foods ==
&quot;Korokke&quot; is often eaten as part of a meal, such as in bento or curry.

<text>The Aceair AERIKS 200 is a Swiss sports plane of highly unusual design. It is being marketed in kitplane form. The AERIKS 200 has a highly streamlined, bullet-shaped fuselage, with a T-tail and large ventral fin, pusher propeller, and canard. The pilot and passenger are seated in tandem. Development aircraft used a fixed undercarriage, but Aceair was planning to offer a version with retractable landing gear.

==Status==
Aceair ceased operation in 2004, and with it the Aeriks 200 project was cancelled. This was principally due to Diamond Engines cancelling the manufacture of the rotary engine the 200 was based around.
Some assets of the company were purchased by a pair of entrepreneurs, and so the Aeriks 200 may eventually see commercial launch someday.

<doc id="1043595" wikidata="Q467204" url="?curid=1043595" title="Days of Future Past">
<text>&quot;Days of Future Past&quot; is a storyline in the Marvel Comics comic book &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; issues #141–142, published in 1981. It deals with a dystopian future in which mutants are incarcerated in internment camps. An adult Kate Pryde transfers her mind into her younger self, the present-day Kitty Pryde, who brings the X-Men to prevent a fatal moment in history that triggers anti-mutant hysteria.

The storyline was produced during the franchise&#x27;s rise to popularity under the writer/artist team of Chris Claremont, John Byrne and Terry Austin. The dark future seen in the story has been revisited numerous times, and was the basis for the 2014 film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, wherein Wolverine is sent back in time. In 2001, fans voted the first issue of this storyline as the 25th greatest Marvel comic.

The &quot;Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005&quot; gave the numerical designation for the original &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline as Earth-811 in the Marvel Multiverse.

==Plot==
The storyline alternates between the present year of 1980 and the future year of 2013. In the future, Sentinels rule a dystopian United States, and mutants are hunted and placed in internment camps. Having conquered North America and hunted all mutants and other superhumans, the Sentinels are turning their attention to the rest of the world. On the eve of a feared nuclear holocaust, the few remaining X-Men, while making a desperate attempt to stop the Sentinels, send Kitty Pryde&#x27;s mind backward through time, to possess the body of her younger-self and to prevent a pivotal event in mutant–human history and the cause of these events: the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly along with Charles Xavier and Moira MacTaggert by Mystique&#x27;s newly reassembled Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.

Working with the present-day X-Men, Kitty Pryde&#x27;s future-self succeeds in her mission and is pulled back to her own time, while her present-day-self is returned with no memory of any interim. The world of 2013 is not shown again in this story arc; the present-day X-Men are left to ponder whether their future dystopia has been averted or simply delayed.

==Background and creation==
John Byrne devised the plot for &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, since he wanted to do a story featuring the Sentinels and his collaborator Chris Claremont had no interest in coming up with one. Years later, Byrne said, he realized that he had unconsciously lifted the &quot;spine&quot; of the plot from the 1972 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Day of the Daleks&quot;.

==Sequels==

Though Byrne had intended &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; to be a completely self-contained story, with the future world seen in the story no longer existing even as an alternate timeline following the conclusion, a number of stories have revisited this future and even acted as outright sequels.

Rachel Summers, a character seen in the future segments of &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, later travels through time to the present day and joins the X-Men. A supervillain, Ahab, follows her to the present in the &quot;Days of Future Present&quot; crossover. In this story, Ahab kidnaps the children Franklin Richards (son of Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman and, in the future timeline, Rachel&#x27;s lover) and Nathan Summers (son of Cyclops and Madelyne Pryor) but is defeated by the X-Men, X-Factor, the New Mutants and the Fantastic Four.

Rachel joins the European mutant team Excalibur, whose series twice revisited the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline. The first time was in a story by Alan Davis entitled &quot;Days of Future Yet To Come&quot;, in which a time-traveling Excalibur and several Marvel UK heroes overthrow the Sentinel rulers of future America. This storyline also reveals that Excalibur&#x27;s robotic &quot;mascot&quot; Widget had been possessed by the spirit of the future Kitty Pryde.

A similar but distinct reality is seen in a vision by her teammate Captain Britain. This story, &quot;Days of Future Tense&quot;, reveals the final fate of that timeline&#x27;s Excalibur team.

A prelude to &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; was produced in a three-part mini-series entitled &quot;Wolverine: Days of Future Past&quot;. This three-issue mini dealt with ramifications between the catalyst for the creation of the alternative future up until the main storyline in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; 141–142. The prelude explains why Logan leaves for Canada and why Magneto is in a wheelchair in the main two issue story.

Another view of this reality was presented in the second issue of &quot;Hulk: Broken Worlds&quot;. A short story, &quot;Out of Time&quot;, examines the life of Bruce Banner (the Hulk) in a Sentinel prison camp.

The miniseries &quot;Days of Future Past: Doomsday&quot; looks at what happened to other characters as this world fell apart, such as Spider-Man being beaten to death in an anti-mutant riot or General Ross and the Avengers resigning from the government in protest at what they were being asked to do.

==Secret Wars (2015)==
A sequel based on the original storyline written by Marguerite Bennett, &quot;Years of Future Past&quot;, was released in June 2015, featuring the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; timeline depicted in the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline. The setting on Battleworld is called the Sentinel Territories. Major characters in the series include Christina Pryde and Cameron, the children of Kate Pryde and Colossus.

==In other media==
===Television===

* The &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; storyline was adapted in the &quot;X-Men&quot; animated series. The storyline concepts were combined with another alternative future story—that of Bishop and the idea of a traitor within the ranks of the X-Men, though Mystique is still responsible for Senator Kelly&#x27;s assassination. Bishop plays the role of Kitty Pryde in the adaptation—albeit traveling completely back in time instead of just projecting his mind into his past self—while the &#x27;traitor&#x27; is &#x27;revealed&#x27; to be Gambit, with the X-Men&#x27;s interference revealing that Mystique had killed Senator Kelly while in the guise of Gambit, to try and frame the X-Men.

* The series &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; has a similar storyline, in which Professor X is in a coma for 20 years, and awakens to find that the mutants are imprisoned by the Sentinels. He telepathically connects with the X-Men of the past to try to prevent that future from happening. By the end of the first season, the Sentinel-dominated future was averted. However, a future based on &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; appeared in its place. The series stopped production before the second season revolving around this could be made.

* A Days of Future Past incarnation appeared in &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot; episode &quot;Days, Nights, and Weekends of Future Past&quot;.

* A Madland level based on &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; appears in the &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; episode &quot;Game Over&quot;. Mutant Arcade designs the level under the basis of Sentinels being used to destroy mutants. The scenario features a shot of Wolverine being blasted by a Sentinel in an homage to the cover of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; No. 142.

* &quot;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&quot; features a five-part episode entitled &quot;Days of Future Smash&quot;, which consists of the Hulk chasing the Leader throughout numerous events of time and space. The episode&#x27;s title is a reference to &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;.

* A future resembling that in Days of Future Past can be briefly glimpsed in the &quot;Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur&quot; episode &quot;Skip This Ad...olescence&quot;, as Moon Girl is accidentally sent to her future body by her time traveling app. The scene itself homages the cover of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #141. Executive producer Steve Loter later hinted on his Twitter account that the scene foreshadowed elements from the series&#x27; planned storyline.

===Film===
&quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; is a sequel to &quot;First Class&quot;. Numerous actors from the franchise returned, including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Anna Paquin, Elliot Page, Shawn Ashmore, Daniel Cudmore, Nicholas Hoult, Jennifer Lawrence, and Lucas Till. Newcomers Peter Dinklage, Omar Sy, Adan Canto, Fan Bingbing, Booboo Stewart and Evan Peters were also signed to play Bolivar Trask, Bishop, Sunspot, Blink, Warpath and Quicksilver, respectively. Although Wolverine is the one who is actually sent backward in time to his &quot;younger&quot; body, director Bryan Singer described Pryde as the prime facilitator and it is Pryde&#x27;s phasing ability that enables time travel to happen. In this film, the catalyst for the Sentinel-dominated future was Mystique&#x27;s assassination of Bolivar Trask and her subsequent capture, with analysis of her DNA allowing humanity to devise Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power. After Shadowcat learns how to use her abilities to &#x27;phase&#x27; someone into their past self, Xavier and Magneto decide to have her send someone back in time to the year 1973 to prevent Mystique from killing Trask, with Wolverine being selected as he is the only one who can survive the process due to his regenerative healing factor. Upon arriving in 1973, Wolverine locates the past versions of Xavier, Hank McCoy, and Magneto and convinces them to help him prevent their extinction. Although Magneto nearly jeopardizes the plan when he tries to kill Mystique and takes control of the Sentinels as part of his own plan to save the mutant race, Xavier is able to convince Mystique to spare Trask, resulting in her being publicly shown defending President Richard Nixon from Magneto. As a result, Mystique is hailed as a hero, the Sentinel program is scrapped, and Trask is arrested for selling his designs to foreign nations. The film ends with Wolverine waking up in a revised, idyllic future in which the war with the Sentinels never happened and all of the X-Men are still alive.

===Video games===
&quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; has a &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;-inspired stage serving as an alternative to the standard Metro City stage, with an &quot;Apprehended&quot;/&quot;Slain&quot; poster similar to the famous one, featuring characters from both Marvel and Capcom that starred in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes&quot;, but did not return for the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; games. Taking the place of the playable Wolverine is Mega Man.

To coincide with the release of the film, GlitchSoft, a mobile app developer, released &quot;The Uncanny X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot; for iOS and Android devices. The game is a side-scrolling 2-D action adventure, with a storyline closer to the original comic book, than the one portrayed in the film. Initially players will be able to control Wolverine, and as they advance further in the game, they will be able to choose between Kitty Pryde, Colossus, Scarlet Witch and Cyclops, with Storm, Polaris and Magneto announced as additional characters, each one with different powers and abilities, which is upgradable as the player progress in the game, by obtaining experience points.

The ending of the &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; video game is set in a not so distant future in which Wolverine (in an X-Men costume) breaks free from captivity by Bolivar Trask to discover Sentinels have taken over the world.

Stern Pinball released &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; in 2024. This pinball machine was designed by Jack Danger. The plot of the game follows the story line of Days of future past by having the player jump between time in past and future. There is a giant sentinel head in the game that&#x27;s used as a bash toy to simulate battling the sentinel army. Artwork for the game was inspired by the designs of the X-Men animated series and recreated by artist Zombie Yetti.

===Novel===
A novelization of the comic version of &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; by Alex Irvine was released in May 2014 by Marvel Comics that tied into the release of the film, &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;. It essentially follows the plot of the original comic storyline, but with two particular changes to the events set in the future: Magneto survives the escape of the Sentinel camp and hides until his powers are restored to the point that he can annihilate the remaining Sentinels, and Kitty is conscious in the body of her future self rather than remaining comatose until she is returned to her own time.

==In popular culture==
In &quot;Genesis&quot;, the first episode of the television series &quot;Heroes&quot;, the character of Hiro Nakamura cites Kitty&#x27;s traveling through time as teaching him about the concepts of time travel. Hiro states that the comic taught him that time is a circle, even though it actually insinuated that time branched. The episode &quot;Five Years Gone&quot; was a further homage to the story, featuring Hiro and his friend Ando travelling into a future where New York has been destroyed and people with abilities are being hunted, forcing them to travel back into the past to prevent the original explosion.

==Collected editions==
* &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; (TPB) collects &quot;X-Men&quot; #138–141, &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #142–143 and &quot;X-Men Annual&quot; No. 4

<doc id="1043596" wikidata="Q5585159" url="?curid=1043596" title="Gordon Gibson Jr">
<text>Gordon Fulerton Gibson (August 23, 1937 – November 10, 2023), often referred to as Gordon Gibson Jr., was a Canadian author, political columnist, and politician in British Columbia. He was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1974 to 1979, and served as the leader of the BC Liberal Party between 1975 and 1979. He was the son of Gordon Gibson Sr., who was a prominent businessman and Liberal Party politician in British Columbia in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Education==
Gibson received a BA (honours) in mathematics and physics at the University of British Columbia and an MBA from Harvard Business School, and he did research work at the London School of Economics.

==Political career==

=== Aide to Arthur Laing and Pierre Trudeau ===
Gibson worked for Arthur Laing, the federal Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources and the senior cabinet minister from British Columbia in the Pearson Ministry, from 1963 to 1968. He became executive assistant to Justice Minister and leadership contender Pierre Trudeau in 1968 on the suggestion of Marc Lalonde, then an advisor in Pearson&#x27;s Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO) and later Principal Secretary to Trudeau, and joined PMO upon Trudeau&#x27;s appointment as Prime Minister. He was known to be one of few who could get Trudeau to consider western Canada perspectives on issue. 

=== Unsuccessful bids for the House of Commons ===
Gibson contested his first election in the 1972 federal election, running as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver South to succeed his former boss Laing, but lost to Progressive Conservative candidate John Fraser by 3,000 votes.

After a stint as a provincial legislator and party leader, Gibson ran again for a seat in the federal House of Commons, in the riding of North Vancouver—Burnaby. He was defeated in both the 1979 and 1980 federal elections by Progressive Conservative candidate Chuck Cook by less than 1,500 votes on each attempt.

=== BC Liberal MLA and Leadership ===
In 1974, Gibson ran in a provincial by-election as a BC Liberal in the riding of North Vancouver-Capilano upon the resignation of incumbent Liberal MLA David Maurice Brousson. During BC Liberals&#x27; long period of wilderness between the collapsed of the Liberal-PC Coalition in 1952 and its 2001 return to government, North Vancouver was one of the very rare spot where it had residual electoral strength. Gibson&#x27;s father and party leader Ray Perrault held the duo seat between 1960 and 1966. Brousson won three elections with comfortable margin. However with the continual declined of both the BC Liberals and Progressive Conservatives as centrist options, Gibson won the seat with a margin of only 57 votes out of 15,222 valid ballots, a margin smaller than the number of rejected ballots. 

Three months before 1975 election, three Liberal MLAs, including former leader Pat McGeer and future lieutenant governor Garde Gardom, defected to the Social Credit Party, leaving Gibson and party leader David Anderson as the only two Liberals in the legislature. Anderson declined to be renominated to the leadership, and Gibson was approached to lead the party into the election. Just over a month before the election call on September 28, Gibson was acclaimed as leader, again following the footstep of his former boss Authur Laing. Given the party&#x27;s disarray, voters abandoned the party en masse. For the first time in the province&#x27;s history Liberals received less than 10% of the popular vote. That election saw former leader Anderson going down in defeat, and Surrey Mayor Bill Vander Zalm, who Anderson defeated in the 1972 leadership contest, securing his first victory at the provincial level and immediately elevated to cabinet, commencing his long march toward the Premier&#x27;s chair. As the only Liberal in the legislature, Gibson remained party leader until 1979, when he resigned to seek a federal seat again.
=== Bid to reclaim leadership ===
Gibson attempted to return to politics as a candidate in a contest colloquially referred to as the &quot;Battle of the Three Gordons&quot;, the 1993 B.C. Liberal leadership challenge to incumbent leader Gordon Wilson after an extramarital affair between him and caucus member Judi Tyabji came to light. Gibson&#x27;s campaign was dealt a fatal blow just over a month before the vote, when Vancouver Mayor Gordon Campbell&#x27;s supporters mobilized and successfully secured approval, by a single vote out of close to 700 cast, for a proposal to change the leadership election process from one where all electoral districts would have equal weight, to one where all member votes are counted with equal weight. Campbell was already seen as the front runner prior to that change, but a Gibson win remained a possibility given the broad respect he commanded among long-time members across the province. The amendment made Campbell&#x27;s lead prohibitive given the large number of members recruited in Vancouver the political machine he headed as mayor, as evident by the swollen membership roll of 15,000. Campbell easily defeated Gibson on the first ballot by a margin of 63% to 24%, with incumbent leader Wilson securing only 8%. Campbell was the only BC Liberals leader elected where all votes are count equal. The party soon reverted back to a system where with equal weights for all electoral districts.

==Post-political career==
Gibson largely stayed out of partisan politics after the 1993 leadership bid, even when his immediate family members played prominent roles in the federal Liberal Party or the Vancouver municipal party Non-Partisan Association. He called himself non-partisan in a 2018 column, and have remained active and visible through public policy commentary throughout his retirement years.

Gibson was a senior fellow in Canadian Studies at the Fraser Institute and has written several books on Canadian federalism and governance. Following the 2001 British Columbia provincial election, he was hired by the government to make recommendations on the structure and mandate of the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform. His report was substantially adopted. He also wrote extensively and critically about the Indian Act and first nation reserve system it created, calling it &quot;both a fortress and a prison&quot; and was critical about the policies guiding ongoing modern treaties negotiations.

His columns appeared frequently in the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot;, the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

== Personal ==
Gibson was first married to Valerie Gauthier, with who he had three children before their divorce. 

His second marriage was with Kilby Tobin, with whom he had two daughters. Kilby died in 2009.

He was married to Jane Baynham at this death. Gibson died on November 10, 2023, at the age of 86. Suffering from heart failure from early 2023, he opted for medical assistance in dying.

==Honours==
In May 2008, Gibson was awarded the Order of British Columbia.

<doc id="1043598" wikidata="Q552964" url="?curid=1043598" title="Socialist emulation">
<text>Socialist competition or socialist emulation (, &quot;sotsialisticheskoye sorevnovanie&quot;, or , &quot;sotssorevnovanie&quot;) was a form of competition between state enterprises and between individuals practiced in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern bloc states.

== Competition vs. emulation ==

The first variant is a literal translation of the Russian term, commonly used by Western authors. The second form is an official Soviet translation of the term, intended to put distance from the &quot;capitalist competition&quot;, which in its turn was translated as , &quot;kapitalisticheskaya konkurenciya&quot;. Implied was that &quot;capitalist competition&quot; only profited those that won, while &quot;socialist emulation&quot; benefited all involved.

The race between teams and team members for overperforming the five-year plans led to increasingly unrealistic targets, which could only be satisfied with cheating, double accounting, hoarding of resources, and &quot;shturmovshchina&quot; (last-minute cramming)—which, in the long term, led to a collapse of the supply chain in the economy. In 1987, Soviet economist Nikolai Shmelov estimated that out of 450 billion roubles worth of inventories of raw materials and parts, around 170 billion was kept as surplus, with the sole purpose of securing the successful completion of plans.

== Organization ==

Socialist emulation was nominally voluntary everywhere where people worked or served: in industry, in agriculture, in offices, institutions, schools, hospitals, army, etc. With the natural exception of the armed forces, committees of the trade unions were in charge of managing the socialist emulation.

An important component of socialist emulation was &quot;socialist self-obligations&quot; (). Whilst the production plan was the major benchmark, employees and work collectives were supposed to put forth &quot;socialist self-obligations&quot; and even &quot;enhanced socialist self-obligations&quot; () beyond the plan, both either as a collective or individually.

Deadlines for tallying up the results of a socialist emulation were usually set at major socialist and communist holidays or notable dates, like the birthday of Vladimir Lenin or the anniversary of the October Revolution.

Winners were awarded both materially and morally. Material awards were money, goods, or perks specific to socialist systems, such as tickets to resorts, authorizations for a trip abroad, right to obtain a dwelling, or a car outside the main queue, etc. Moral awards were honorary diplomas, honorary badges, and/or putting winners&#x27; portraits on the &quot;Board of Honor&quot; (); work collectives were awarded with the &quot;Transferable Red Banner of the Socialist Emulation Winner&quot; (). More prestigious was the nomination to state orders and medals for services rendered by individuals and by state enterprises.

== History ==

Vladimir Lenin was the originator and promoter of the idea of socialist emulation as a means for organising &quot;the majority of working people into a field of labour in which they can display their abilities, develop the capacities, and reveal those talents&quot;. His milestone article was &quot;How to organize the emulation?&quot; (&quot;&quot;), in which among the important goal of the emulation was discovery of persons with organizational and management skills, to replace tsarist-era specialists. Also, he was the first to set &quot;socialist emulation&quot; against &quot;capitalist competition&quot;. Lenin&#x27;s article however repeatedly highlights the need for strictest &quot;accounting and control&quot; (Russian: &quot;учёт и контроль&quot;) at all levels for the socialist society, postulating mutual &quot;accounting and control&quot; between all layers of the government and supply chain.

Later, Joseph Stalin wrote in his streamlined style:

:&quot;Principles of (capitalist) competition: defeat and death of ones and victory and dominance of the others.&quot;
:&quot;Principles of socialist emulation: friendly assistance to lagging ones by the leading ones in order to achieve a common rise.&quot; ...etc.

While criteria of socialist emulation were easy to set, understand, and quantify in production areas, it was not so in non-production areas: medicine, education, work of clerks, etc., where significant formalism took place and among the criteria a significant weight was attributed to &quot;social activism&quot;, not related to the work done. Social activism, among other actions, meant:

* Participating in all CPSU and Komsomol activities
* Recruitment of future CPSU members in their workplaces or hometowns
* Election campaigns for deputies for the Union and Republican Supreme Soviets and Soviets of People&#x27;s Deputies
* Active work during national holidays

Attempt to add a &quot;moral&quot; aspect to daily work was a common feature among 20th century socialist governments, with &quot;Arbeitskult&quot; (&quot;work cult&quot;) in Germany, which &quot;stressed the patriotic potential of labour, comparing industrial work with the task of a soldier defending the Fatherland&quot; and &quot;Yan’an heroes&quot; in Maoist China.

<text>Eirik Vandvik (1904–1953) was professor in literature at the University of Oslo. Vandvik was one of the major interpreters of the ancient Greek and Latin literature, and saw it as his purpose to make these works available to Norwegian literati.

Vandvik interpreted major works like &quot;Greek tragedy&quot; - a collection of tragedies and the &quot;Iliad&quot;. He wrote in &quot;nynorsk&quot;. He was instrumental in gathering material for a dictionary of medieval Latin in Norway.

<text>The bird genus Eremophila comprises the two horned larks.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The current genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;eremos&quot;, &quot;desert&quot;, and &quot;phileo&quot;, &quot;to love&quot;.

===Extant species===
===Extinct species===
There is at least one fossil species included in this genus:

* †&quot;Eremophila orkhonensis&quot; (late Pliocene of Central Asia, synonym = &quot;Pliocalcarius orkhonensis&quot;)
* †&quot;Eremophila prealpestris&quot; (late Pliocene of Varshets, Bulgaria)

==Description==
Unlike most other larks, these are distinctive looking species with striking head and face patterns, black and white in Temminck&#x27;s lark and black and yellow in most horned larks. In the summer males of both species have black &quot;horns&quot;, which give these larks their alternative names.

==Distribution and habitat==
These are larks of open country which nest on the ground. The migratory horned lark breeds across much of northern North America, Europe and Asia and in the mountains of Europe. Temminck&#x27;s lark is mainly a resident breeding species across much of north Africa, through northern Arabia to western Iraq.

<doc id="1043613" wikidata="Q2822961" url="?curid=1043613" title="Aces High Cuby">
<text>The Aces High Cuby is a family of Canadian single engine, high wing, strut-braced, light sports planes with conventional landing gear that was marketed for homebuilding by Aces High Light Aircraft of London, Ontario.

The aircraft design was available in two versions, the single-seat Cuby I and side-by-side two-seat Cuby II. Aces High went out of business in the 1990s and the kits are no longer available.

==Development==
The Cuby fuselage is constructed from welded 4130 steel tubing, covered with aircraft fabric. The wings are built around an aluminum spar and D-cell and also fabric-covered. The conventional landing gear includes bungee-suspended main wheels and a steerable tail wheel.

The controls are conventional three-axis, with no flaps fitted to the wing. The aircraft were available as kits or as completed aircraft and were designed to look and fly similarly to a Piper J-3 Cub. The kit price for the Cuby I was US$11,350, including the propeller and Rotax 277 engine.

The Cuby II features a wide cabin and a large baggage compartment behind the side-by-side seats. The aircraft was certified and put into production in Hungary for sale in Europe. In North America the Cuby II was sold for US$15,662.76, complete with propeller, Rotax 503 powerplant, paint and fabric in 1988. Available options included folding wings, floats and an agricultural spray kit.

Reviewer Ken Armstrong, flying the Cuby II prototype with the single carburetor version of the Rotax 503 said:

==Variants==
;Cuby I
:Single seat, standard engine Rotax 277, qualified as a US FAR 103 &quot;Ultralight Vehicle&quot; with an empty weight of and as Canadian basic ultra-light, advanced ultra-light or amateur-built aircraft
;Cuby II
:Two seat, standard engine Rotax 503, qualified as a US amateur-built and Canadian basic ultra-light, advanced ultra-light or amateur-built aircraft. More than 200 completed and flying.

<doc id="1043614" wikidata="Q356828" url="?curid=1043614" title="Edwin Torres (judge)">
<text>Edwin Torres (born January 7, 1931) is a former New York State Supreme Court judge and author of Puerto Rican descent, who wrote the 1975 novel &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;. His book was the basis for the 1993 movie of the same name, starring Al Pacino, and for the 1979 book &quot;After Hours,&quot; the sequel to &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;.

==Early years==
Both of Torres&#x27;s parents emigrated from Jayuya, Puerto Rico, and settled in the barrio in Manhattan&#x27;s Spanish Harlem, where Torres was born. Growing up in poverty, Torres graduated from Stuyvesant High School. From there he attended City College of the City University of New York, followed by the Brooklyn Law School.

==Legal career==
In 1958, Torres was admitted to the New York State Bar. In 1959, as an assistant district attorney, Torres participated in the prosecution of Sal &quot;the Capeman&quot; Agron. Shortly thereafter he became a criminal defense attorney.

In 1977, Torres was appointed to the New York State Criminal Court. In 1980 he was selected to the State Supreme Court, where he served as a justice in the Twelfth Judicial District in New York City. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over felony cases, and Torres presided over a number of high-profile murder cases.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Torres “one of the city’s most experienced and sternest judges and a man known for a crackling eloquence both in and out of the courtroom.” A famous exchange involved his telling a convicted murderer, “Sucker, your parole officer ain’t been born yet.”

In the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Semi-Professional,&quot; the Judge Raoul Sabatelli character is said to have been inspired by Judge Torres.

He retired from the bench in 2008 and since then has served on the New York State Athletic Commission.

==Writer of fiction==
Torres&#x27; tough upbringing in Manhattan and his work in the criminal justice system enabled him to create realistic crime fiction characters and plots. Richie Narvaez called him &quot;the Granddaddy—&quot;¡El Abuelo!&quot;—of Latino crime fiction in the U.S. For a brief while in the 1970s, Torres picked up the mantle of Chester Himes and Miguel Piñero, keeping the door cracked open for crime fiction writers who happen to be ethnically diverse. Without Torres we might not have gotten Ernesto Quiñonez&#x27; &quot;Bodega Dreams&quot;, Carolina Garcia-Aguilera&#x27;s Lupe Solano series, or even Walter Mosley&#x27;s &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;.&quot;

Torres wrote &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; in 1975 and its sequel &quot;After Hours&quot; in 1979; both novels follow the exploits of Carlito Brigante, a fictional Puerto Rican drug kingpin and hustler who ends up doing time in Sing-Sing and struggles to go &quot;straight&quot; after his release. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; praised &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way:&quot; &quot;It is in the grisly tradition of &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, &quot;The Jones Men&quot;, and &quot;The Friends of Eddie Coyle&quot;, and it is the equal of any of them.&quot;

Another novel, &quot;Q &amp; A&quot; (1977), portrays the investigation of a decorated New York City police lieutenant suspected of corruption.
Of the book, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted, &quot;Judge Torres infuses these nearly current events with so much life and style that you can almost smell the musty air of 100 Centre Street.&quot;

===Film adaptations===
A film adaptation of &quot;Q &amp; A&quot; was released in 1990, directed by Sidney Lumet, and it starred Nick Nolte and Armand Assante. &quot;After Hours&quot; was filmed in 1993, but used the title &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; to avoid being confused with Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1985 film &quot;After Hours&quot;. The film starred Al Pacino and Sean Penn, under the direction of Brian De Palma. The novel &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; was filmed in 2005 and released under the title &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power&quot;.

<text>Predeterminism is the philosophy that all events of history, past, present and future, have been already decided or are already known (by God, fate, or some other force), including human actions.

Predeterminism is closely related to determinism. The concept of predeterminism is often argued by invoking causal determinism, implying that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to infinity. In the case of predeterminism, this chain of events has been pre-established, and human actions cannot interfere with the outcomes of this pre-established chain. Predeterminism can be used to mean such pre-established causal determinism, in which case it is categorised as a specific type of determinism. It can also be used interchangeably with causal determinism—in the context of its capacity to determine future events. Despite this, predeterminism is often considered as independent of causal determinism. The term predeterminism is also frequently used in the context of biology and heredity, in which case it represents a form of biological determinism.

==Definitional difficulties==
Predeterminism is difficult to discuss because its simple definition can logically lead to a variety of similar, complex (and, perhaps, better defined) concepts in metaphysics, theology, and the philosophy of free will. The term &quot;predeterminism&quot; suggests not just a determining of all events, but the prior and deliberately conscious determining of all events (therefore done, presumably, by a conscious being). Due to this, predeterminism and the similar term determinism are easily and often confused or associated with ideas ranging, for instance, from the physicalist (and often scientific) notion of &quot;causal determinism&quot; to even the theological (and often religious) notion of &quot;predestination&quot;.

A secular example to try to illustrate predeterminism is that a fetus&#x27;s future physical, emotional, and other personal characteristics as a matured human being may be considered &quot;predetermined&quot; by heredity, i.e. derived from a chain of events going back long before their eventual birth. However, one of the difficulties with defining predeterminism using this example is that the word &quot;predetermine&quot; necessarily implies a conscious being &quot;doing&quot; the determining ahead of time. With regards to predetermined heredity, a conscious being (perhaps a genetic scientist) is presumed to be the one speculating on what the fetus&#x27;s personal characteristics will turn out to be, for example, based on looking at the genomes of the fetus and its ancestors. If there were not this conscious entity, the scientist, then one could say merely that the fetus&#x27;s characteristics are &quot;determined&quot; by heredity, rather than &quot;pre&quot;determined. Predeterminism necessarily implies, at the very least, a passive but all-knowing observer, if not an active planner, designer, or manipulator (of the fetus&#x27;s personal characteristics). This basic scientific idea of hereditary determination, though, already fulfills the definition of causal determinism, a metaphysical concept.

While determinism usually refers to a naturalistically explainable causality of events, predeterminism seems by definition to suggest a person or a &quot;someone&quot; who is controlling or planning the causality of events &quot;before&quot; they occur and who then perhaps resides beyond the natural, causal universe. This creates a definitional conflict because predeterminism, by this understanding, logically leads to a belief in the existence of a conscious being who must determine &quot;all&quot; actions and events in advance and who, possessing such seeming omnipotence, almost certainly operates outside of the laws of nature. This conscious entity is probably, then, a being who is omnipotent as well as presumably supernatural and omniscient. The definitional confusion here is that there is already a name for this very concept: &quot;predestination&quot;. Predestination asserts that a supremely powerful being has, in advance, fixed all events and outcomes in the universe; it is a famous doctrine of the Calvinists in Christian theology.

Likewise, the doctrine of fatalism already explicitly attributes all events and outcomes to the will of a (vaguer) higher power such as fate or destiny. Furthermore, in philosophic debates about the compatibility of free will and determinism, some argue that &quot;predeterminism&quot; back to the origin of the universe is simply what philosophers mean by the more common term &quot;determinism.&quot; Others have suggested that the term &quot;self-determination&quot; be used to describe actions as merely &quot;determined&quot; by an agent&#x27;s reasons, motives, and desires.

When various interpretation of the word &quot;predeterminism&quot; can be defined even better by other terms, such as the aforementioned determinism, predestination, or fatalism, then the definition of predeterminism itself appears awkward, unclear, and perhaps even worthless in terms of practical or philosophic discussion.

==R. E. Hobart==

R. E. Hobart is the pseudonym of Dickinson S. Miller, a student of William James who was later one of James&#x27; closest personal friends and for some years a colleague in the Harvard philosophy department. Hobart (Miller) criticized the core idea of James&#x27; &quot;The Will to Believe&quot;, namely that it was acceptable to hold religious faith in the absence of evidence for or against that faith. James referred to Miller as &quot;my most penetrating critic and intimate enemy.&quot;

Nearly 25 years after James&#x27; death, R. E. Hobart published a short article in &quot;Mind&quot; in 1934 that is considered one of the definitive statements of determinism and compatibilism. It was entitled &quot;Free Will as Involving Determination and Inconceivable Without It&quot;.

Hobart&#x27;s compatibilism was similar to earlier landmark positions by Thomas Hobbes and David Hume, as refined in the 19th-century compatibilist views of John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, and F. H. Bradley. But unlike them Hobart explicitly did not endorse &quot;strict&quot; logical or physical determinism, and he explicitly did endorse the existence of alternative possibilities, which can depend on absolute chance.

He was writing just a few years after the discovery of quantum mechanics and indeterminacy, and also makes passing mention of the ancient &quot;swerve&quot; of the atoms espoused by Epicurus:

&#x27;I am not maintaining that determinism is true...it is not here affirmed that there are no small exceptions, no slight undetermined swervings, no ingredient of absolute chance.&#x27;

&#x27;&quot;We say,&quot; I can will this or I can will that, whichever I choose&quot;. Two courses of action present themselves to my mind. I think of their consequences, I look on this picture and on that, one of them commends itself more than the other, and I will an act that brings it about. I knew that I could choose either. That means that I had the power to choose either.&#x27;

Hobart supports the existence of alternative possibilities for action and the capability to do otherwise.

And he clearly prefers &quot;determination&quot; to &quot;determinism.&quot; Hobart&#x27;s article is frequently misquoted as &quot;Free Will as Involving Determinism.&quot;

==Philippa Foot==

Philippa Foot is one who misquoted Hobart&#x27;s title, but who had the same misgivings about determinism.

In 1957 she wrote an article in The Philosophical Review entitled &quot;Free Will As Involving Determinism.&quot;

Nevertheless, she criticized arguments that free will requires indeterminism, and in particular the idea that one could not be held responsible for &quot;chance&quot; actions chosen for no particular reason.

Her article begins with the observation that determinism has become widely accepted as compatible with free will.

&quot;The idea that free will can be reconciled with the strictest determinism is now very widely accepted. To say that a man acted freely is, it is often suggested, to say that he was not constrained, or that he could have done otherwise if he had chosen, or something else of that kind; and since these things could be true even if his action was determined it seems that there could be room for free will even within a universe completely subject to causal laws.&quot;

Foot doubted that the ordinary language meaning of saying our actions are &quot;determined&quot; by motives has the same meaning as strict physical determinism, which assumes a causal law that determines every event in the future of the universe.

She notes that our normal use of &quot;determined&quot; does not imply universal determinism.

&quot;For instance, an action said to be determined by the desires of the man who does it is not necessarily an action for which there is supposed to be a sufficient condition. In saying that it is determined by his desires we may mean merely that he is doing something that he wants to do, or that he is doing it for the sake of something else that he wants. There is nothing in this to suggest determinism in Russell&#x27;s sense.&quot;

Foot cited Bertrand Russell&#x27;s view of causal determinism:

&quot;The law of universal causation . . . may be enunciated as follows:...given the state of the whole universe...every previous and subsequent event can theoretically be determined.&quot;

<text>Biomedicine (also referred to as Western medicine, mainstream medicine or conventional medicine) is a branch of medical science that applies biological and physiological principles to clinical practice. Biomedicine stresses standardized, evidence-based treatment validated through biological research, with treatment administered via formally trained doctors, nurses, and other such licensed practitioners.

Biomedicine also can relate to many other categories in health and biological related fields. It has been the dominant system of medicine in the Western world for more than a century.

It includes many biomedical disciplines and areas of specialty that typically contain the &quot;bio-&quot; prefix such as molecular biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, cell biology, embryology, nanobiotechnology, biological engineering, laboratory medical biology, cytogenetics, genetics, gene therapy, bioinformatics, biostatistics, systems biology, neuroscience, microbiology, virology, immunology, parasitology, physiology, pathology, anatomy, toxicology, and many others that generally concern life sciences as applied to medicine.

==Overview==
Biomedicine is the cornerstone of modern health care and laboratory diagnostics. It concerns a wide range of scientific and technological approaches: from in vitro diagnostics to in vitro fertilisation, from the molecular mechanisms of cystic fibrosis to the population dynamics of the HIV virus, from the understanding of molecular interactions to the study of carcinogenesis, from a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to gene therapy.

Biomedicine is based on molecular biology and combines all issues of developing molecular medicine into large-scale structural and functional relationships of the human genome, transcriptome, proteome, physiome and metabolome with the particular point of view of devising new technologies for prediction, diagnosis and therapy.

Biomedicine involves the study of (patho-) physiological processes with methods from biology and physiology. Approaches range from understanding molecular interactions to the study of the consequences at the in vivo level. These processes are studied with the particular point of view of devising new strategies for diagnosis and therapy.

Depending on the severity of the disease, biomedicine pinpoints a problem within a patient and fixes the problem through medical intervention. Medicine focuses on curing diseases rather than improving one&#x27;s health.

In social sciences biomedicine is described somewhat differently. Through an anthropological lens biomedicine extends beyond the realm of biology and scientific facts; it is a socio-cultural system which collectively represents reality. While biomedicine is traditionally thought to have no bias due to the evidence-based practices, Gaines &amp; Davis-Floyd (2004) highlight that biomedicine itself has a cultural basis and this is because biomedicine reflects the norms and values of its creators.

== Molecular biology ==

Molecular biology is the process of synthesis and regulation of a cell&#x27;s DNA, RNA, and protein. Molecular biology consists of different techniques including Polymerase chain reaction, Gel electrophoresis, and macromolecule blotting to manipulate DNA.

Polymerase chain reaction is done by placing a mixture of the desired DNA, DNA polymerase, primers, and nucleotide bases into a machine. The machine heats up and cools down at various temperatures to break the hydrogen bonds binding the DNA and allows the nucleotide bases to be added onto the two DNA templates after it has been separated.

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to identify similar DNA between two unknown samples of DNA. This process is done by first preparing an agarose gel. This jelly-like sheet will have wells for DNA to be poured into. An electric current is applied so that the DNA, which is negatively charged due to its phosphate groups is attracted to the positive electrode. Different rows of DNA will move at different speeds because some DNA pieces are larger than others. Thus if two DNA samples show a similar pattern on the gel electrophoresis, one can tell that these DNA samples match.

Macromolecule blotting is a process performed after gel electrophoresis. An alkaline solution is prepared in a container. A sponge is placed into the solution and an agarose gel is placed on top of the sponge. Next, nitrocellulose paper is placed on top of the agarose gel and a paper towels are added on top of the nitrocellulose paper to apply pressure. The alkaline solution is drawn upwards towards the paper towel. During this process, the DNA denatures in the alkaline solution and is carried upwards to the nitrocellulose paper. The paper is then placed into a plastic bag and filled with a solution full of the DNA fragments, called the probe, found in the desired sample of DNA. The probes anneal to the complementary DNA of the bands already found on the nitrocellulose sample. Afterwards, probes are washed off and the only ones present are the ones that have annealed to complementary DNA on the paper. Next the paper is stuck onto an x ray film. The radioactivity of the probes creates black bands on the film, called an autoradiograph. As a result, only similar patterns of DNA to that of the probe are present on the film. This allows us the compare similar DNA sequences of multiple DNA samples. The overall process results in a precise reading of similarities in both similar and different DNA sample.

== Biochemistry ==

Biochemistry is the science of the chemical processes which takes place within living organisms. Living organisms need essential elements to survive, among which are carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, calcium, and phosphorus. These elements make up the four macromolecules that living organisms need to survive: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.

Carbohydrates, made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, are energy-storing molecules. The simplest carbohydrate is glucose, CHO, is used in cellular respiration to produce ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which supplies cells with energy.

Proteins are chains of amino acids that function, among other things, to contract skeletal muscle, as catalysts, as transport molecules, and as storage molecules. Protein catalysts can facilitate biochemical processes by lowering the activation energy of a reaction. Hemoglobins are also proteins, carrying oxygen to an organism&#x27;s cells.

Lipids, also known as fats, are small molecules derived from biochemical subunits from either the ketoacyl or isoprene groups. Creating eight distinct categories: fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides (derived from condensation of ketoacyl subunits); and sterol lipids and prenol lipids (derived from condensation of isoprene subunits). Their primary purpose is to store energy over the long term. Due to their unique structure, lipids provide more than twice the amount of energy that carbohydrates do. Lipids can also be used as insulation. Moreover, lipids can be used in hormone production to maintain a healthy hormonal balance and provide structure to cell membranes.

Nucleic acids are a key component of DNA, the main genetic information-storing substance, found oftentimes in the cell nucleus, and controls the metabolic processes of the cell. DNA consists of two complementary antiparallel strands consisting of varying patterns of nucleotides. RNA is a single strand of DNA, which is transcribed from DNA and used for DNA translation, which is the process for making proteins out of RNA sequences.

<text>Friedrich Boie (4 June 1789 – 3 March 1870) was a German entomologist, herpetologist, ornithologist, and lawyer. He was born at Meldorf in Holstein and died at Kiel. Friedrich Boie was the brother of Heinrich Boie.

In 1860, Friedrich Boie was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

Friedrich Boie was the author of &quot;Bemerkungen über Merrem&#x27;s Versuch eines Systems der Amphibien&quot; (&quot;Isis von Oken&quot; 1827) and &quot;Auszüge aus dem System der Ornithologie&quot; (&quot;Isis von Oken&quot; 1844). 

Friedrich Boie was the author of several new species and new genera of birds including the hummingbird genus &quot;Glaucis&quot;, the swallow genus &quot;Progne&quot;, the cuckooshrike genus &quot;Pericrocotus&quot;, the passerine genus &quot;Lipaugus&quot;, the owl genus &quot;Athene&quot;, and the cuckoo genus &quot;Chrysococcyx&quot;. Also, he and his brother Heinrich, working together, described about 50 new species of reptiles.

A species of Indian gecko, &quot;Cnemaspis boiei&quot;, is named in honor of Friedrich Boie or his brother Heinrich Boie.

<text>Los Algodones (English: &quot;The cottons&quot;) is a town and borough in the municipality of Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. Located on the United States-Mexico border to the north and east, Los Algodones is south of Andrade, California, and close to five miles west of downtown Yuma, Arizona. It reported a population of 5,474 in the 2010 Mexican census. Los Algodones is popularly referred to as &quot;Molar City&quot; due to hundreds of dentists that cater to Americans seeking affordable dental care outside of the United States.

==Etymology==

The Spanish-language name &quot;Los Algodones&quot; translates into English as &quot;the cotton plants&quot;. The origin of the name is unknown.

==Geography==
Los Algodones is the northernmost town in Mexico, and at its northeastern tip is the northernmost point in the state of Baja California, and in Latin America. Because of its unique location, it is possible to travel due north, south, east or west from Los Algodones and intersect with the US border.

From the U.S., Los Algodones is most easily reached via Interstate 8 and south a short distance (3.33 Km / 2.07 mi) along State Route 186/Andrade Road to the international border at Andrade, California. From Andrade, visitors park their vehicles and walk across the border, or drive across.

The town is at an elevation of 110 feet/33.5 m above mean sea level.

===Climate===


==Economy==

Situated near the borders of both southeastern California and southwestern Arizona, Los Algodones has become a popular tourist attraction in recent years due in part to inexpensive shopping and restaurants as well as inexpensive medical care and prescription medicines. The warm, dry climate of the area attracts a number of older tourists from across the United States and Canada who settle during the winter in the nearby towns of Yuma, Arizona, and Winterhaven, California. Organized day trips from the Coachella Valley are popular among seniors as well.

===Healthcare===
The popularity of both inexpensive prescriptions and medical care catering to Canadian and U.S. senior citizens has prompted a veritable explosion of pharmacies, opticians and dental offices since the 1980s. They have largely displaced many of the open-air shops and restaurants immediately across the border, and have effectively shifted the town&#x27;s focus from tourism to medicine. Los Algodones has approximately 600 dentists who service uninsured Canadian and American health tourists who save 40 to 60 percent on dental services. Nevertheless, a number of shops and restaurants remain, and Los Algodones capitalizes on the tourist trade with frequent &quot;fiestas&quot; throughout the year, most notably around the Christmas season.

==Transportation==
Transportes Miguel Siga, a private bus company, provides service between Mexicali and Los Algodones. Yuma County Area Transit provides service from Andrade to Yuma.

<doc id="1043642" wikidata="Q3759468" url="?curid=1043642" title="General Computer Corporation">
<text>General Computer Corporation (GCC), later GCC Technologies, was an American hardware and software company formed in 1981 by Doug Macrae, John Tylko, and Kevin Curran. The company began as a video game developer and created the arcade games &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; (1982) in-house for Bally MIDWAY and &quot;Food Fight&quot; (1983) as well as designing the hardware for the Atari 7800 console and many of its games. In 1984 the company pivoted to developing home computer peripherals, such as the HyperDrive hard drive for the Macintosh 128K, and printers. GCC was disestablished in 2015.

==History==

GCC started out making mod-kits for arcade video games. &quot;Super Missile Attack&quot; was sold as an enhancement board to Atari, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Missile Command&quot;. Atari sued, but ultimately dropped the suit and hired GCC to develop game (and stop making enhancement boards for Atari&#x27;s games without permission). They created an enhancement kit for &quot;Pac-Man&quot; called &quot;Crazy Otto&quot; which they sold to Midway, who in turn sold it as the sequel &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;; they also developed &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot;, that game&#x27;s successor.

Under Atari, Inc., GCC made the original arcade games &quot;Food Fight&quot;, &quot;Quantum&quot;, and the unreleased &quot;Nightmare&quot;; developed the Atari 2600 versions of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Centipede&quot;; produced over half of the Atari 5200 cartridges; and developed the chip design for the Atari 7800, plus the first round of cartridges for that system.

===Peripherals===
In 1984, the company changed direction to make peripherals for Macintosh computers: the HyperDrive (the Mac&#x27;s first internal hard drive), the WideWriter 360 large format inkjet printer, and the Personal Laser Printer (the first QuickDraw laser printer). Prior to closing, the company focused exclusively on laser printers.

HyperDrive was unusual because the original Macintosh did not have any internal interfaces for hard disks. It was attached directly to the CPU, and ran about seven times faster than Apple&#x27;s &quot;Hard Disk 20&quot;, an external hard disk that attached to the floppy disk port.

The HyperDrive was considered an elite upgrade at the time, though it was hobbled by Apple&#x27;s Macintosh File System, which had been designed to manage 400K floppy disks; as with other early Macintosh hard disks, the user had to segment the drive such that it appeared to be two or more partitions, called Drawers.

The second issue of &quot;MacTech&quot; magazine, in January 1985, included a letter that summed up the excitement:

In 1986 the company shipped the &quot;HyperDrive 2000&quot;, a 20MB internal hard disk that also included a Motorola 68881 floating-point unit, but the speed advantage of the HyperDrive had been negated on the new Macintosh Plus computers by Apple&#x27;s inclusion of an external SCSI port. General Computer responded with the &quot;HyperDrive FX-20&quot; external SCSI hard disk, but drowned in a sea of competitors that offered fast large hard disks.

General Computer changed its name to GCC Technologies and relocated to Burlington, Massachusetts. They continued to sell laser printers until 2015, at which point the company was disestablished.

<text>In fireworks, a burst charge (usually black powder) is a pyrotechnic mixture placed in a shell which is ignited when the shell reaches the desired height in order to create an explosion and spread the stars. Burst charge compositions are usually coated onto rice hulls or other low-density fillers, which increases the rate of combustion.

In artillery and Naval artillery the burst charge or bursting charge is ignited by a primer at the base of the shell.

<doc id="1043648" wikidata="Q7796670" url="?curid=1043648" title="Thorp T-211">
<text>The T-211 is a light aircraft designed in the US by John Thorp in 1945. It is a low-wing monoplane of conventional layout with a fixed tricycle undercarriage and a sliding canopy. John Thorp developed the Sky Scooter with lessons learned from developing the Lockheed Little Dipper project in 1944. It bears some family resemblance to the Piper Cherokee, a design that Thorp later significantly contributed to.

==Development==

Thorp constructed eight prototypes, had the design certified by the FAA but was unable to find a foothold in the Cessna-dominated post-war US market. The original prototypes were powered by a 65 hp Lycoming engine. Novel features of the Sky Skooter include an all-movable horizontal stabilizer and externally ribbed wings and tailplane. The wings were corrugated to impart stiffness, each wing needing only three internal ribs. This feature simplified construction, reduced the number of rivets (and weight), and helped control the spanwise flow of air over the wings. The T-211 was developed with a 90-horsepower Continental upgrade in 1953. The project was therefore shelved until the homebuilding boom saw the rights to the aircraft acquired first by Adams Industries and then by Thorp Aero in the 1970s, the latter firm building five examples as the Thorp Arrow or T-211 Aero Sport built in Sturgis Kentucky, but only sold overseas or to part 141 operations due to current liability laws. The kits were then manufactured by AD Aerospace in the United Kingdom and Venture Light Aircraft in the United States.

IndUS Aviation began production of the T-211 according to the guidelines of Light Sport Aircraft in the mid-2000s. The Thorp T-211 was the first US-designed Special Light Sport Aircraft to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration. The light-sport version uses the Jabiru 3300 engine, while the type certified version uses a Continental O-200 engine and is equipped for both VFR and IFR flying.

In 2010, the aircraft was also back in production as a kit aircraft by AD Aerospace of Manchester, United Kingdom. This model is powered by a four-cylinder Continental O-200 or a six-cylinder Jabiru 3300 powerplant.

<text>A financial system is a system that allows the exchange of funds between financial market participants such as lenders, investors, and borrowers. Financial systems operate at national and global levels. Financial institutions consist of complex, closely related services, markets, and institutions intended to provide an efficient and regular linkage between investors and borrowers.

In other words, financial systems can be known wherever there exists the exchange of a financial medium (money) while there is a reallocation of funds into needy areas (financial markets, business firms, banks) to utilize the potential of ideal money and place it in use to get benefits out of it. This whole mechanism is known as a financial system.

Money, credit, and finance are used as media of exchange in financial systems. They serve as a medium of known value for which goods and services can be exchanged as an alternative to bartering. A modern financial system may include banks (public sector or private sector), financial markets, financial instruments, and financial services. Financial systems allow funds to be allocated, invested, or moved between economic sectors, and they enable individuals and companies to share the associated risks.

==The components of a financial system==

There are mainly four components of the financial system:

# Financial markets - the market place where buyers and sellers interact with each other and participate in the trading of bonds, shares and other assets are called financial markets.
# Financial instruments - the products which are traded in the financial markets are called financial instruments. Based on different requirements and credit seekers, the securities in the market also differ from each others.
# Financial institutions - financial institutions are acting as a mediator between the investors and borrowers. They provide financial services for members and clients. It is also termed as financial intermediaries because they act as middlemen between the savers and borrowers. The investor&#x27;s savings are mobilized either directly or indirectly via the financial markets. They offer services to organisations who want to raise funds from markets and take care of financial assets (deposits, securities, loan, etc). 
# Financial services - services provided by assets management and liabilities management companies. They help to get the required funds and also make sure that they are efficiently invested. (eg. banking services, insurance services and investment services)

== Banks ==

Banks are financial intermediaries that lend money to borrowers to generate revenue and accept deposits . They are typically regulated heavily, as they provide market stability and consumer protection. Banks include:
*Public banks
*Commercial banks
*Central banks 
*Cooperative banks
*State-managed cooperative banks
*State-managed land development banks

=== Non-bank financial system===
Non-bank financial systems facilitate financial services like investment, risk pooling, and market brokering. They generally do not have full banking licenses. Non-bank financial system include:
* Finance and loan companies

=== Financial markets ===

Financial markets are markets in which securities, commodities, and fungible items are traded at prices representing supply and demand. The term &quot;market&quot; typically means the institution of aggregate exchanges of possible buyers and sellers of such items.

==== Primary markets ====
The primary market (or initial market) generally refers to new issues of stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. The primary market is divided in two segment, the money market and the capital market.

==== Secondary markets ====
The secondary market refers to transactions in financial instruments that were previously issued.

=== Financial instruments ===
Financial instruments are tradable financial assets of any kind. They include money, evidence of ownership interest in an entity, and contracts.

==== Derivative instruments ====
A derivative instrument is a contract that derives its value from one or more underlying entities (including an asset, index, or interest rate).

===Financial services===
Financial services are offered by a large number of businesses that encompass the finance industry. These include credit unions, banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, stock brokerages, and investment funds.

<doc id="1043651" wikidata="Q482055" url="?curid=1043651" title="Acton, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Acton is a suburb of Canberra, ACT, Australia. Acton covers an area west of the CBD, bordered by Black Mountain to the west and Lake Burley Griffin in the south. The Australian National University campus covers most of the suburb, though also located in Acton is the National Film and Sound Archive, a branch of the CSIRO and the National Museum of Australia.

At the Acton had a population of 2,848 people, mostly students living at the Australian National University.

==History==
Acton was inhabited by Aboriginal Australian groups for thousands of years before European occupation. Part of this history is documented by the ANU Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Trail. Sullivans Creek, which flows through Acton, provided a culturally significant source of food and resources for Aboriginal people. According to historian Bill Gammage, part of the area now used as the South Oval was purposely deforested by Aboriginal people, to form a grassland area that may have been used for hunting kangaroos, camping, or as an area to await smoke signals from nearby. Scarred trees in Acton suggest that their bark provided a valuable resource.

The suburb is named in recognition of one of the region&#x27;s original homesteads &#x27;Acton&#x27; which was sited near the present-day National Museum at the end of Liversidge Street.

With the establishment of the Federal Capital in 1911, territory administrators erected a temporary workers camp in the vicinity of &#x27;Acton Homestead&#x27;, since demolished, to house staff coordinating the development of the National Capital. The chief Surveyor Scrivener occupied Acton Homestead at an early stage during his survey of the capital site. The Bachelors&#x27; Quarters above Lennox Crossing, now renamed Lennox House, became the city&#x27;s first guest house.

The alignment of Liversidge Street and Lennox Crossing follows the original line of the pre-1911 road towards the major ford across the Molonglo River. A low bridge and causeway was erected in 1911, at the site of the original river ford in an area subsequently inundated by Lake Burley Griffin.

The Acton Tunnel was built below a hill in the suburb between 1976 and 1979 as part on an extension of Parkes Way.

In 2011 a proposal was launched to build the Australia Forum, a major convention centre complex, on the lake shoreline in Acton.

==Demographics==
In the , the population of Acton was 2,848. In 2011, 56.9% of the population was foreign-born, the highest for any Canberra suburb.

==Geology==

The southern part of Acton has a complicated arrangement of sediments that include the Pittman Formation greywacke and the black-coloured Acton Shale Member from the Ordovician age. Then from the Silurian age there is mudstone, State Circle Shale, and Camp Hill Sandstone. Some limestone is found near the National Museum of Australia.

Calcareous shales from the Canberra Formation are overlain by Quaternary alluvium on the north. This rock is the limestone of the original title of Canberra, &quot;Limestone Plains&quot;. Tertiary-age pebbly gravels are left from when the Molonglo river was at a higher level.

<text>Leuna is a town in Saxony-Anhalt, eastern Germany, south of Merseburg and Halle, on the river Saale.

The town is known for the &quot;Leunawerke&quot;, at 13 km2 one of the biggest chemical industrial complexes in Germany, where a very wide range of chemicals and plastics is produced.

In 1960, Leuna&#x27;s population was nearly 10,000, but after reunification high unemployment rates and poor living conditions, including pollution from nearby industries, caused significant outward migration. Before the 31 December 2009 incorporation of ten neighbouring municipalities, its population had declined to 6,670.

==Geography==
The town Leuna consists of Leuna proper and the following 10 &quot;Ortschaften&quot; or municipal divisions:

*Friedensdorf
*Günthersdorf
*Horburg-Maßlau
*Kötschlitz
*Kötzschau
*Kreypau
*Rodden
*Spergau
*Zöschen
*Zweimen
== Economy ==

Leuna&#x27;s industrial site stretches over 13 km², making it one of the largest chemical industry sites in Germany in terms of geographical area. At the beginning of the 21st century, a wide range of chemical products and plastics are made there. A pilot plant to produce isobutylene from vegetal stock is being built by the French company Global Bioenergies and should start during 2016.

<doc id="1043681" wikidata="Q392892" url="?curid=1043681" title="Pinfire cartridge">
<text>The pin-fire (or pinfire) is an obsolete type of metallic cartridge used in firearms, where the priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin that protrudes radially from above the base of the cartridge. Invented by Frenchman Casimir Lefaucheux in 1832, but not patented until 1835, it was one of the earliest practical designs of a metallic cartridge to hasten the loading and firing process of a firearm. Its history is closely associated with the development of the breechloader, which would eventually replace all muzzle-loading firearms.

The cartridge featured a small pin that, when struck, would ignite the priming compound and initiate the firing process. Despite initial resistance, especially from British gun users, the pinfire cartridge gained popularity following the Great Exhibition of 1851. Its advantages included easier and faster loading than percussion weapons, and it was more likely to fire reliably when wet. However, with the introduction of reliable rimfire and centerfire cartridges, which were quicker to load and safer, the pinfire cartridge became obsolete. Today, enthusiasts of vintage weaponry often create pinfire cartridges from modern materials for use in antique firearms.

==History==

The Swiss gun maker Samuel Joannes Pauly patented the first breechloading cartridge in 1812. This was for use in a shotgun with fixed barrels which was loaded by lifting a breech block on the top. French gun maker Henri Roux attempted to improve this cartridge in the 1820s but a constantly primed cartridge was felt by many to be too dangerous and many breechloading guns reverted to using an unprimed cartridge. This was fired by a separate percussion cap which was used on the still dominant muzzle-loading guns.

Casimir Lefaucheux of Paris decided in 1832 to patent a breechloader where the barrel hinged downwards to reveal the breech ends. These still used a separate percussion cap. Though used before this, (as seen in surviving pinfire shotshells that lists the names of early gun makers he signed contracts with in 1833 and 1834,) in 1835 he was granted an addition to the 1832 patent for a new type of cartridge in which the cartridge&#x27;s priming compound is ignited by striking a small pin which protrudes radially from just above the base of the cartridge. These pins fitted into a small groove cut in the top of each barrel-end and made it easy to see if the gun was loaded. The interior side of the chamber served as an anvil so that the cap won&#x27;t move, which was a problem in some early cartridge designs at the time. The cartridge used metal bases (often brass) with paper tubes which were usually loaded by the shooter or his staff but were not entirely gas-tight. This reduced the force of the charge and allowed powder residue and gas to escape.

The pinfire cartridge was greatly improved by the 1846 patent (number 1963) by Benjamin Houllier of Paris which introduced a base wad and effectively made the cartridge gas-tight which greatly improved the performance. They were cheap and clean shooting. These improved pinfire guns grew in popularity in France and some were imported by British gun makers to overwhelming indifference on the part of the gun users there. They were prejudiced technically against a gun that &#x27;broke&#x27; in the middle, despite the much vaunted benefits of breechloading. They owned muzzle-loaders of exquisite perfection, considered themselves the best engineers in the world (inventing the Industrial Revolution), and had a poor view of the French - the old enemy and an unreliable ally.

It was not until the Great Exhibition of 1851 was held in London that breechloading guns were taken more seriously by British and American gun makers in particular. The display of a Lefaucheux breechloading gun inspired English apprentice gunmaker Edwin Charles Hodges (1831–1925) to make an improved copy and persuade leading London gun maker Joseph Lang that this was the gun of the future. Lang was universally credited to be the first established British gunmaker to produce pinfires in any numbers. His first weapon of this new type was produced in 1853. Other British gun makers including Lancaster, Blanch and Reilly were similarly inspired by French originals and improved pinfire breechloaders became the new type of gun which by 1857–1858 every fashionable British prince and titled gentleman wanted to have. EC Hodges continued to make a good living as a specialist independent maker of breechloading actions commissioned by leading gunmakers such as Boss, Lancaster, Egg, Grant, Atkin, Rigby, Dickson, Purdey, Woodward, Army and Navy, and many others.

After Casimir&#x27;s death in 1852, his son Eugene continued to market the pinfire design with great success. It became increasingly popular in Europe and large numbers of rifles, shotguns, and revolvers (often called Lefaucheux guns after their inventor whoever the maker was), were manufactured from the mid-1850s until the late 1890s. They were quicker and easier to load than percussion weapons with loose black powder, percussion caps and bullet; and they were also much more likely to fire reliably when wet. Pinfire cartridges were available in a large number of sizes for various types of weapon.

While pinfire rifles and shotguns began to decline in use from the early 1860s onward, after the introduction of mass-produced centerfire rifle and shotgun cartridges, pinfire revolvers in particular became very successful and widespread, being adopted by the armies of France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and others. They were also widely used during the American Civil War, although sometimes despised because of their low-power compared to more common percussion revolvers made by gun manufacturers such as Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson. Some navies also adopted them for &quot;sea service&quot;, these examples were often being made out of brass which is largely unaffected by the corrosion, caused by the salt in a maritime environment.

Pinfire became obsolete once reliable rimfire and centerfire cartridges became available because without a pin which needed aligning in the slot in the chamber wall they were quicker to load. They were also safer because they had no protruding pin which could cause the ammunition to accidentally detonate during rough handling, particularly of loose ammunition.

Although pinfire revolver, rifle, and shotgun cartridges are technically obsolete, as pinfire guns have not been made in large numbers since the early 20th century, enthusiasts of vintage weaponry often make pinfire cartridges from modern materials and shoot their old guns. Some modern novelty miniature pinfire pistols are manufactured in calibers as small as 2 to 3 millimeters (.0787 to .118 inches) in diameter. Although not practical weapons, they use pinfire ammunition because the caliber is too small for centerfire or rimfire. Antique pinfire firearms and cartridges are available on the collector market and modern reloading kits exist which contain specialized cartridges which can be hand loaded, though the process is far more complex than loading rimfire or centerfire cartridges.

<text>Richard Louis Proenneke (; May 4, 1916 – April 20, 2003) was an American self-educated naturalist, conservationist, writer, and wildlife photographer who, from the age of about 51, lived alone for nearly thirty years (1968–1998) in the mountains of Alaska in a log cabin that he constructed by hand near the shore of Twin Lakes. Proenneke hunted, fished, raised and gathered much of his own food, and also had supplies flown in occasionally. He documented his activities in journals and on film, and also recorded valuable meteorological and natural data. The journals and film were later used by others to write books and produce documentaries about his time in the wilderness.

Proenneke bequeathed his cabin to the National Park Service upon his death and it was included in the National Register of Historic Places four years later. The cabin is a popular attraction of Lake Clark National Park.

==Early life==
Proenneke&#x27;s father, William Christian Proenneke (1880–1972), served in World War I, and made his living as a house painter, carpenter and well driller. His mother, Laura (née Bonn) (1884–1966) was a homemaker and gardener. His parents married in December 1909 and had three daughters and four sons: Robert, Helen, Lorene, Richard (Dick), Florence, Paul, and Raymond (Jake). The year of Proenneke&#x27;s birth is often given as 1917, but social security and census records note Richard Louis Proenneke was born in Primrose, Harrison Township, Lee County, Iowa, on May 4, 1916.

Proenneke completed primary school in Primrose, but left high school after two years because he did not enjoy it. Until 1939, he worked in proximity to Primrose driving tractors, working with farm equipment, and doing typical chores Iowa family farms required at the time. He also admired motorcycles and obtained a Harley Davidson as a teen.

==Naval career==
Proenneke enlisted in the United States Navy the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor and served as a carpenter. He spent almost two years at Pearl Harbor and was later stationed in San Francisco waiting for a new ship assignment. After hiking on a mountain near San Francisco he contracted rheumatic fever and was hospitalized at Norco Naval Hospital for six months. During his convalescence the war ended and he was given a medical discharge from the Navy in 1945. According to one of his biographers and friend, Sam Keith, the illness was very revealing for Proenneke, who decided to devote the rest of his life to the strength and health of his body.

==Later career==

Following his discharge from the Navy, Proenneke went to school to become a diesel mechanic. The combination of his high intelligence, adaptability, and strong work ethic helped him become a skilled technician. Though adept at his trade, Proenneke eventually yielded to his love of nature and moved to Oregon to work at a sheep ranch. He moved to Shuyak Island, Alaska, in 1950.

For several years, he worked as a heavy equipment operator and repairman on the Naval Air Station at Kodiak. Proenneke spent the next several years working throughout Alaska as both a salmon fisherman and diesel technician. He worked for the Fish and Wildlife Service at King Salmon on the Alaska Peninsula. His skills as a technician were well-known and sought after, and he was able to save for retirement.

==Twin Lakes cabin==
On May 21, 1968, Proenneke arrived at his new place of retirement at Twin Lakes. Beforehand, he made arrangements to use a cabin on Upper Twin Lake owned by retired Navy Captain Spike Carrithers and his wife Hope of Kodiak (in whose care he had left his camper). This cabin was well-situated on the lake and close to the site that Proenneke chose for the construction of his own cabin.

Proenneke&#x27;s cabin is handmade and is notable for its fine craftsmanship as a result of his carpentry and woodworking skills; he also made 8mm films covering its construction. Most of the structure and the furnishings are made from materials in and around the site, from the gravel taken from the lake bed to create the cabin&#x27;s base, to the trees he selected, cut down, and then hand-cut with interlocking joints to create the walls and roof rafter framing. The fireplace and flue were made from stones he dug from around the site and mortared in place to create the chimney and hearth. He used metal containers for food storage: one-gallon cans were cut into basin shapes and buried below the frost line. This ensured that fruit and perishables could be stored for prolonged periods in the cool earth yet still be accessible when the winter months froze the ground above them. Proenneke&#x27;s friend, bush pilot and missionary Leon Reid &quot;Babe&quot; Alsworth, returned periodically by seaplane or ski-plane to bring mail, food and orders that Proenneke placed through him to Sears.

Proenneke remained at Twin Lakes for the next sixteen months, after which he briefly went home to visit relatives and secure more supplies. He returned to Twin Lakes the following spring and remained there for most of the next thirty years, traveling to the contiguous United States only occasionally to visit his family. He made a film record of his solitary life, which was later re-edited and made into the documentary &quot;Alone in the Wilderness&quot;. In 2011 a sequel was produced after enough footage for at least two more programs was discovered. &quot;Alone in the Wilderness: Part 2&quot; premiered on December 2, 2011.

Proenneke&#x27;s cabin was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. The site is a popular attraction for many who want to personally experience parts of Proenneke&#x27;s life and values.

==Death and legacy==
In 1999, at age 83, Proenneke left his cabin and moved to Hemet, California, where he lived the remainder of his life with his brother Raymond &quot;Jake&quot; Proenneke. He died of a stroke on April 20, 2003, at the age of 86. He willed his cabin to the National Park Service, and it remains a popular visitor attraction in the still-remote Twin Lakes region of Lake Clark National Park.

Sam Keith, who came to know Proenneke at the Kodiak Naval Station and went on numerous hunting and fishing trips with him, suggested that Proenneke&#x27;s journals might be the basis for a good book. In 1973, Keith published the book &quot;One Man&#x27;s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey&quot;, based on Proenneke&#x27;s journals and photography. Proenneke however alleged that Keith had &quot;changed some things&quot; to embellish the story, such as writing that Proenneke had assumed a role as King of Bears and wielded power over them. After years in print it was reissued in a new format in 1999, winning that year&#x27;s National Outdoor Book Award (NOBA). A hardcover &quot;commemorative edition&quot;, celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of when Proenneke first broke ground and made his way in the Alaskan wilds in 1968 was published by Alaska Northwest Books in 2018. In 2003, some of the copyrighted text from the book and some of Proenneke&#x27;s film were used with permission in the documentary &quot;Alone in the Wilderness&quot;, which began appearing on U.S. Public Television. It follows Proenneke&#x27;s life as he builds the cabin from the surrounding natural resources and includes his film footage and narration of wildlife, weather, and the natural scenery while he goes about his daily routine over the course of the winter months.

In 2005, the National Park Service and the Alaska Natural History Association published &quot;More Readings From One Man&#x27;s Wilderness&quot;, another volume of Proenneke&#x27;s journal entries. The book, edited by John Branson, a longtime Lake Clark National Park employee and friend of Proenneke, covers the years when the park was established. Proenneke had a very close relationship with the Park Service, assisting them in filming sensitive areas and notifying them if poachers were in the area.

&quot;The Early Years: The Journals of Richard L. Proenneke 1967–1973&quot; was published by Alaska Geographic in 2010. As with &quot;More Readings From One Man&#x27;s Wilderness&quot;, the volume is edited by John Branson. This collection of journals covers Proennekes&#x27; first years at Twin Lakes, including the construction of his cabin and cache. The journal entries overlap those in Sam Keith&#x27;s edited collection of some of Proenneke&#x27;s journals, &quot;One Man&#x27;s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey.&quot; But unlike that book—in which Keith frequently modified Proenneke&#x27;s writing style—&quot;The Early Years&quot; presents Proenneke&#x27;s journals with minimal or no modification.

In 2017, a Richard Proenneke museum exhibit was opened at the Donnellson Public Library in Donnellson, Iowa, near Proenneke&#x27;s hometown of Primrose. The exhibit features a replica of Proenneke&#x27;s cabin, some of his writings, and other artifacts.

In 2016 and 2018, respectively, &quot;A life in Full Stride: The Journals of Richard L. Proenneke 1981-1985&quot; and &quot;Your Life here is an Inspiration: The Journals of Richard L. Proenneke 1986–1991&quot; were published. In 2020, the fifth and final collection of Proenneke&#x27;s journals, &quot;Reaching the End of the Trail: The Journals of Richard L. Proenneke 1992–2000&quot; was published. These three final collections were published by the Friends of Donnellson Public Library, The Richard Proenneke Museum, and were edited by John Branson.

<text>Lefktra (, ) is a village in the regional unit of Boeotia, Greece, and a part of the municipality of Thebes. Before 1915, its name was &quot;Parapoungia&quot; (). Lefktra is located in the foothills of Mount Kithairon at 353 meters average elevation. The population of Lefktra is 779 people (2021 census). Thebes is sixteen kilometers away and Athens 70 km away, via the old national road. There are bus lines from Thebes to Lefktra and vice versa daily, and from Athens to Lefktra at the weekends. Residents&#x27; main occupations are agriculture and stockbreeding. Livadostra and Koromili beaches are ten minutes away by car.

Between 1912 and 1997 Lefktra was an independent community (an independent municipality after 1989). In 1997, at the Kapodistrias reform, it was merged into the municipality Plataies, along with the communities Melissochori, Loutoufi and Kaparelli. In 2010, at the Kallikratis reform, Plataies was merged into the municipality of Thebes.

==Etymology==
Lefktra is named after the ancient village of Leuctra (, ) in ancient Boeotia, seven miles southwest of Thebes.

==Defeat of Sparta==
The Battle of Leuctra (371 BC) was fought in the vicinity of ancient Leuctra, in which the Thebans under Epaminondas defeated the Spartans, ending the Spartan hegemony. Following their victory, the Thebans became a new power within the Hellenic world, until the rise of Macedonia. 
The base of Theban Tropaion (Trophy) tower, erected at the battle site circa 371BC..

<doc id="1043701" wikidata="Q1520176" url="?curid=1043701" title="Unani medicine">
<text>Unani or Yunani medicine (Urdu: &quot;tibb yūnānī&quot;) is Perso-Arabic traditional medicine as practiced in Muslim culture in South Asia and modern day Central Asia. Unani medicine is pseudoscientific. 

The term &quot;Yūnānī&quot; means &#x27;Greek&#x27;, referring to the fact that the Perso-Arabic system of medicine was based on the teachings of the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen.

The Hellenistic origin of Unani medicine is still visible in its being based on the classical four humours: phlegm (), blood (&quot;dam&quot;), yellow bile (&quot;ṣafrā&quot;) and black bile (&quot;saudā&quot;&#x27;), but it has also been influenced by Indian and Chinese traditional systems.

==History==

Arab and Persian elaborations upon the Greek system of medicine by figures like Ibn Sina and al-Razi influenced the early development of Unani.

Unani medicine interacted with Indian Buddhist medicine at the time of Alexander&#x27;s invasion of India. There was a great exchange of knowledge at that time which is visible from the similarity of the basic conceptual frames of the two systems. The medical tradition of medieval Islam was introduced to India by the 12th century with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and it took its own course of development during the Mughal Empire, influenced by Indian medical teachings of Sushruta and Charaka. Alauddin Khalji (d. 1316) had several eminent physicians (Hakims) at his royal courts. This royal patronage led to the development of Unani in India, and also the creation of Unani literature.

==Education and recognition==

=== India ===
There are several Indian universities devoted to Unani medicine, in addition to universities that teach traditional Indian medical practices in general. Undergraduate degrees awarded for completing an Unani program include the Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery, Bachelor of Unani Tib and Surgery, and Bachelor of Unani Medicine with Modern Medicine and Surgery degrees. A small number of universities offer post-graduate degrees in Unani medicine.

The Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), a statutory body established in 1971 under the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), monitors higher education in areas of Indian medicine including Ayurveda, Unani, and other traditional medical systems. Another subdivision of AYUSH, the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), aids and co-ordinates scientific research in the Unani system of medicine through a network of 22 nationwide research institutes and units.

To fight biopiracy and unethical patents, the Government of India set up the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library in 2001 as repository of formulations used in Indian traditional medicine, including 98,700 Unani formulations.

=== Pakistan ===
In 1990, the total number of &quot;hakims&quot; or &quot;tabibs&quot; (practitioners of Unani medicine) in Pakistan was 51,883. The government of Pakistan&#x27;s National Council for Tibb (NCT) is responsible for developing the curriculum of Unani courses and registering practitioners of the medicine. Various private foundations devote themselves to the research and production of Unani medicines, including the Hamdard Foundation, which also runs an Unani research institution. The Qarshi Foundation runs a similar institution, Qarshi University. The programs are accredited by Higher Education Commission, Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, and the Pakistan Pharmacy Council.

==Criticism and safety issues==
Some medicines traditionally used by Unani practitioners are known to be poisonous.

The Indian Journal of Pharmacology notes:
* According to WHO, &quot;Pharmacovigilance activities are done to monitor detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of any obnoxious adverse reactions to drugs at therapeutic concentration that is used or is intended to be used to modify or explore physiological system or pathological states for the benefit of recipient.&quot;
* These drugs may be any substance or product including herbs, minerals, etc. for animals and human beings and can even be that prescribed by practitioners of Unani or Ayurvedic system of medicine. In recent days, awareness has been created related to safety and adverse drug reaction monitoring of herbal drugs including Unani drugs.
* The Indian Medical Association describes Unani, Ayurvedic, Siddha practitioners who practice medicine without having right qualifications and prescribing allopathic medicines as quacks.

<text>Capgemini Engineering (previously known as &quot;Altran Technologies, SA&quot;) is a global innovation and engineering consulting firm founded in 1982 in France by Alexis Kniazeff and Hubert Martigny.

Altran Technologies operated primarily in high technology and innovation industries, which accounted for nearly 75% of its turnover. Administrative and information consultancy accounted for 20% of its turnover with strategy and management consulting making up the rest. The firm is active in most engineering domains, particularly electronics and IT technology.

In 2018, Altran generated €2.916 billion in revenues and employed over 46,693 people around the world. Altran was acquired by Capgemini in 2019 and was renamed as &quot;Capgemini Engineering&quot; on 8 April 2021 due to its merge with Capgemini&#x27;s Engineering and R&amp;D services.

== History ==

=== 1980s ===
In 1982, Alexis Kniazeff and Hubert Martigny, ex-consultants of Peat Marwick (today known as KPMG), founded CGS Informatique, which would later become Altran. By 1985, the firm counted a staff of 50 engineers.

The company expanded through small business units that would later generally range from 10 to 200 employees. Business units operated semi-independently and were given the autonomy to choose their own growth strategy and investment programs while still getting assistance from central management. This allowed business units to give each other support and share ideas. Managers’ compensation was decided based on the units’ performance.

One of Altran&#x27;s first major projects was developing the on-board communications network in 1987 for France&#x27;s high-speed TGV trains that allowed French lines to be connected to other European rail lines.

In 1987, the company was listed on the Secondary Market of the Paris Stock Exchange. By 1989, Altran&#x27;s sales had neared the equivalent of 48 million euros. That same year, Altran bought Ségur Informatique, an aeronautics simulation and modeling company. The number of the company&#x27;s employees grew to approximately 1,000 by 1990, as well as its range of expertise, moving into the transportation, telecommunications, and energy sectors, with a strong information technology component.

=== 1990s ===
In the early 1990s the company adopted a new business model. While much of the company&#x27;s work during the previous decade had been performed in-house, at the beginning of the 1990s the company developed a new operational concept, that of a temp agency for the high-technology sector. The firm&#x27;s staff started to work directly with its clients&#x27; projects, adding their specialized expertise to projects. By the end of the decade, the company had more than 50 subsidiaries in France, and had taken the lead of that market&#x27;s technology consulting sector. The company was helped by the long-lasting recession affecting France and much of Europe at the beginning of the decade, as companies began outsourcing parts of their research and development operations. Altran was also expanding by acquisition, buying up a number of similar consultancies in France, such as the 1992 acquisition of GERPI, based in Rennes. By the end of that year, Altran&#x27;s revenues had reached 76.5 million euros.

With the elimination of border controls within the European Community in 1992, the company&#x27;s clients began operations in other European countries. At first Altran turned to foreign partnerships in order to accommodate its clients. Yet this approach quickly proved unsatisfactory, and Altran put into place an aggressive acquisition plan in order to establish its own foreign operations.

Altran targeted the Benelux countries, the first to lower their trade barriers, acquiring a Belgian company in 1992. By the end of the decade, the firm&#x27;s network in these countries&#x27; markets was composed of 12 companies and 1,000 consultants. When an acquisition took place, Altran kept on existing management and in general the acquired firms retained their names. The acquisition policy was based on paying an initial fee for an acquisition, then on subsequent annual payments based on the acquired unit&#x27;s performance.

In 1992, Altran created Altran Conseil to work in the automobile equipment, nuclear and consumer electronic industries.

Altran&#x27;s operations in Spain began with the acquisition in 1993 of SDB España, a leading telecommunications consultant in that country, and later grew with the acquisitions of STE Consulting, Norma Consulting, Insert Sistemas, Strategy Consultors, Inad, Siev and Consultrans. Spain remained one of the company&#x27;s top three markets into the new century, becoming a group of nine companies and more than 2,000 consultants operating under the Altran brand.

By 1995, Altran&#x27;s sales had topped 155 million euros, and its total number of employees had grown to nearly 2,400 (mostly engineers). The company recognized that the majority of engineers lacked a background in management, thus a training program called IMA (Institut pour le management Altran) was launched capable of training 200 candidates per year.

In 1995 the company invested in the United Kingdom and acquired High Integrity Systems, a consulting firm focused on assisting companies that were transitioning into new-generation computer and network systems, and DCE Consultants, which operated from offices in Oxford and Manchester.

In 1997, Altran also acquired Praxis Critical Systems, founded in Bath in 1983 to provide software and safety-engineering services. In order to supplement the activities of its acquisitions, the company also opened new subsidiary offices, such as Altran Technologies UK, a multi-disciplinary and cross-industry engineering consultancy.

In the second half of the 1990s the company was acquiring an average of 15 companies per year. Italy became a target for growth in 1996, when Altran established subsidiary Altran Italy, before making its first acquisition in that country in 1997.
In 1998, Altran added four new Italian acquisitions, EKAR, RSI Sistemi, CCS and Pool. In 1999, the company added an office in Turin as well as two new companies, ASP and O&amp;I.

Germany was also a primary target for Altran during this period, starting with the 1997 establishment of Altran Technologies GmbH and the acquisition of Europspace Technische Entwicklungen, a company that had been formed in 1993 and specialized in aeronautics. In 1998, the company added consulting group Berata and, the following year, Askon Consulting joined the group, which then expanded with a second component, Askon Beratung.

Other European countries joined the Altran network in the late 1990s as well, including Portugal and Luxembourg in 1998 and Austria in 1999. In 1998, Altran deployed a telecommunications network in Portugal. By the end of 1999, the company&#x27;s sales had climbed to EUR 614 million; significantly, international sales already accounted for more than one-third of the company&#x27;s total revenues.

Similar progress was made in Switzerland, a market Altran entered in 1997 with the purchase of D1B2. The Berate Germany purchase brought Altran that company&#x27;s Swiss office as well in 1998; that same year, Altran launched its own Swiss startup, Altran Technologies Switzerland. In 1999, the company added three new Swiss companies, , Innovatica, and Cerri.

Significant projects during the decade included the design of the Météor autopilot system for the first automated subway line for the Paris Metro (Line 14) and the attitude control system for the European Space Agency&#x27;s Ariane 5 rocket.

=== Early 21st century ===
In 2000, the company&#x27;s Italian branch expanded to 10 subsidiaries with the opening of offices in Lombardy and Lazio and the acquisition of CEDATI. Also in 2000, Altran&#x27;s presence in Switzerland grew with two new subsidiaries (Infolearn and De Simone &amp; Osswald). In Germany, Altran acquired I&amp;K Beratung. The United States became a primary target for the company&#x27;s expansion with the acquisition of a company that was renamed Altran Corporation.

Altran began building its operations in South America as well, especially in Brazil. By the end of 2001, Altran&#x27;s revenues had jumped to more than 1.2 billion euros, while its ranks of consultants now topped 15,000.

Altran become involved in a couple of new PR initiatives at the beginning of the decade, including a partnership with the Renault F1 racing team and a commitment to the Solar Impulse project with the goal of circumnavigating the Earth powered by only solar power.

In 2002, Askon Beratung was spun off from Askon consulting as a separate, independently operating company within Altran, and the company&#x27;s Swiss network had added a new component with the purchase of Sigma. This year a full-scale entry into the United States was made. After providing $56 million to back a management buyout of the European, Asian, and Latin American operations of bankrupt Arthur D. Little (the US-based consulting firm founded in 1886), Altran itself acquired the Arthur D. Little brand and trademark. This acquisition was seen as an important step in achieving the company&#x27;s next growth target. Sales grew to 2 billion euros by 2003 and the company had more than 40,000 engineers by 2005.

In 2004, Altran established operations in Asia and created Altran Pr[i]me, a consulting outfit specialized in large-scale innovation projects.

On 29 December 2006, all subsidiaries based in Ile de France were merged under the name of Altran Technologies SA, a technology consultant, which was organized into four business lines (as well as brand names):
* Altran TEM: Telecommunications, Electronics and Multimedia.
* Altran AIT: Automobiles, Infrastructure and Transportation.
* Altran Eilis: Energy, Industry and Life Science.
* Altran ASD: Aeronautics, Space and Defence.
In 2009, Altran launched its Altran Research program. The program is centered around three main themes: designing tools, research and proof-of-concepts, and research on how to organize and improve practices.

In 2012, as part its Performance Plan 2012, PSA Peugeot Citroën chose Altran as its strategic partner.

In early 2013, Altran group finalised the acquisition of 100% of IndustrieHansa, an engineering and consulting group based in Germany, placing it among the top five in the market of Technical Consultancy, Innovation, Research and Development.

Altran continued to acquire innovation consultancies in other countries as part of its expansion strategy. In February 2015, it acquired Nspyre, a Dutch R&amp;D and high-technology firm. In July 2015, it bought SiConTech, an Indian engineering company specializing in semiconductors.

Altran&#x27;s revenues reached €1.945 billion in 2015. At that time, it had over 25,000 employees operating in over 20 countries.

In November 2015, Dominique Cerutti announced his five-year strategic plan, &quot;Altran 2020. Ignition.&quot; The plan aimed for the firm to reach 3 billion euros in revenue in five years and a big increase in profitability.

In December 2015, Altran announced the acquisition of Tessella, in analytical and data science consulting.

In 2016, the company acquired two other American companies: Synapse, specializing in the development of innovative products, and Lohika, a software engineering firm. This transatlantic expansion is one of the principal approaches to development supported by Altran in the Ignition 2020 strategic plan.

Additionally, Altran announced in October 2016 the acquisition of two automobile industry companies: Swell, an engineering services and research and development firm based in the Czech Republic, as well as Benteler Engineering, a German firm specializing in conception and engineering services. Dominique Cerutti is noted for establishing several strategic partnerships, notably with Divergent, an American holding that integrates 3D printing in the automobile production process, and the Chinese digital mapping holding EMG ().

22 December 2016 Acquisition: Altran acquires Pricol Technologies, an India-based engineering firm.

In July and September 2017, Altran finalized two acquisitions: Information Risk Management, and GlobalEdge. The acquisition of IRM enabled Altran to enhance its presence and offers in the domain of cyber security. The buying of GlobalEdge, an Indian software product engineering firm, aimed at helping Altran to develop its presence in India as well as in the US, where Global Edge has an office in California.

In November 2017, the company also acquired Aricent, a global digital design and engineering company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The $2.0 billion transaction enabled the company to become the global leader in engineering and R&amp;D services, completing its &quot;Altran 2020. Ignition&quot; strategic plan as early as 2018. The acquisition was completed on 22 March 2018, bringing the overall turnover of the new structure close to €3 billion.

On 28 June 2018, Altran announced the plan &quot;The High Road, Altran 2022&quot;. This plan aimed for a 14.5% margin and a 4 billion euros turnover in 2022 by betting on technological breakthroughs.

=== Takeover by Capgemini ===
On 1 April 2020, Capgemini&#x27;s friendly takeover bid for Altran was finalized. Capgemini reached the squeeze-out threshold of 90% of Altran&#x27;s capital, which was delisted from stock markets on 15 April 2020.

<text>Robert Ernest Vernède (1875 – 9 April 1917) was an English poet and writer, now remembered as a war poet.

He was born in London, and educated at St Paul&#x27;s School (where he was a friend of G. K. Chesterton and E. C. Bentley), and at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. After graduating, he wrote novels and short stories.

He enlisted with the British Army as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Batt. Rifle Brigade in 1914, at the start of World War I, although over the maximum age of service. He served in France, where he was wounded in 1916 in the Battle of the Somme. He was received at Somerville Hospital in Oxford. He returned to the front, but died after being wounded by machine gun fire while leading an advance at Havrincourt. He was buried at Le Bucquiere Communal Cemetery Extension.

Chesterton wrote an appreciation of Vernède for the school magazine, describing his death as &quot;so heavy a loss for those of us who loved him&quot; and called it &quot;an addition or completion to that shining company of poets whose patriotism turned them into soldiers, and gave them a life and death more worthy of legend&quot;.

His &quot;War Poems, And Other Verses&quot; was published in 1917 by William Heinemann.

<text>The Battle of Trippstadt was a relatively minor French military action in 1794 during the War of the First Coalition. The clash between the French Republican forces and the armies of Prussia and Habsburg Austria was fought over several days (13 to 17 July) in the lower Vosges Mountains in the German states west of the Rhine River. Fighting occurred across a wide front and included action in Kaiserslautern, Trippstadt, Schänzel and Neustadt and along the banks of the Speyerbach River.

The battle is also sometimes referred to as the Battle of Vosges, but most documented historical reports, including French- and German-language studies, refer to it as the Battle of Trippstadt. Some studies also mention Platzberg, but few studies call the action the Battle of Vosges.

==Introduction==
During the first two years of the War of the First Coalition, the north-eastern frontier of France bordering the Holy Roman Empire along the Upper Rhine served as invasion route for the enemies of France.

In 1792, the Duke of Brunswick entered France through the north-eastern frontier in his attempt to support and rescue Louis XVI. In 1793, coalition forces including the Prussians and the Habsburg Austrians attempted to capture French fortresses along the Rhine and attacked the French defensive entrenchments along the Lauter River. By the summer of 1794, conflict in this theater of the war had reached a stalemate with armies facing each other in the Palatinate Forest of the lower Vosges Mountains.

At that time, the French Army of the Rhine, commanded by Claude Michaud, occupied a defensive position along the Queich River while the French Army of the Moselle commanded by René Moreaux occupied a defensive position along the Saar River.

Directly across from the “Moselle” to the north at Trippstadt were the Prussians commanded by Field Marshall Wichard Mollendorf. And directly across from the “Rhin” stretching from the Vosges Mountains east to the Rhine River were the Austrians commanded by Friedrich Wilhelm von Hohenlohe-Kirchberg and Prussians commanded by Prince Hohenlohe.

Given this standstill during the summer of 1794, the French armies were ordered to attack the armies of the coalition to prevent the Habsburg Austrians from sending reinforcements to the critical northern front in the Austrian Netherlands.

==Battle==
On 17 June 1794, General Michaud held a council of war with the chief officers of the “Rhin” to discuss plans for an offensive. Generals Moreaux and Ambert of the “Moselle” were also in attendance, as the anticipated action was slated to be a joint attack by both French armies.

Disagreement as to the best offensive punch ensued, and the council ultimately decided to attempt a plan favoured by General Desaix with the cavalry leading the attack on the enemy’s left by means of the Rhine flood plain.

On 2 July Michaud launched the agreed upon attack. On the extreme right, Desaix successfully pushed back the left wing of the coalition forces. Across the other fronts, however, the French armies were halted and then reversed through counterattacks by Prince Baden that inflicted approximately 1,000 casualties. This left Desaix’s division exposed and isolated. Ultimately, Desaix withdrew and at the end of the day, there was no substantial change in the positions that French armies held at the start of hostilities.

At Michaud’s next council of war, new plans were made to attack the coalition lines stretching from Kaiserslautern in the mountains, south to Trippstadt, down to the Rhine flood plain at Neustadt and along the Speyerbach River. In this offensive, the cavalry would be used at the outset only to hold the enemy in the front of the French armies while infantry units from both the “Moselle” and the “Rhin” confronted the enemy in the mountains.

On 13 July Michaud launched the second French offensive. In the center of the battle, French General Alexandre-Camille Taponier&#x27;s division attacked the Prussian camp at Trippstadt. The attack was held off for an entire day, but overnight the Prussians pulled back to a position closer to Kaiserslautern. On the left, the French advance divided the coalition lines preventing the Austrians from supporting the Prussians. On Taponier’s right, French General Laurent de Gouvion Saint-Cyr captured Johanniskreuz. Further to the right the Prussians held Schänzel against an attack from the west but were forced to retreat to Neustadt when the French attacked from the south via Albersweiler and Ramberg. Prussian General Theodore von Pfau was killed during the fighting at Schänzel.

General Michaud planned to continue the battle and attack the Prussians at Kaiserslautern on 16 July but overnight the evening before Hohenlohe retreated out of the mountains to Frankenthal on the Rhine. On 17 July Saint-Cyr advanced forward and the French occupied Kaiserslautern.

==Aftermath==
This victory gave the French control of the mountain passes across the lower Vosges, but in the end, the battle was all for naught. Later in July, Michaud was ordered to move west to attack Trier near Luxembourg. In mid-September the Prussians attacked the weakened French forces in the north-eastern frontier and reoccupied Kaiserslautern. The French returned and the fighting continued until the Austrians abandoned the Netherlands and withdrew to the Rhine at Coblenz. With their northern flank now dangerously exposed, the coalition armies in the Upper Rhine withdrew east to the fortified city of Mainz.

<text>The 1986 [[American League Championship Series]] was a best-of-seven semifinal series in Major League Baseball&#x27;s 1986 postseason between the Boston Red Sox and the California Angels for the right to advance to the 1986 World Series to face the winner of the 1986 National League Championship Series. The Red Sox came in with a 95–66 record and the AL East division title, while the Angels went 92–70 during the regular season to win the AL West.

==Summary==

===Boston Red Sox vs. California Angels===
The Eastern division champion held home field advantage for the third consecutive year in the ALCS. Between 1969-84, the home field advantage alternated between the West in odd-numbered years and the East in even-numbered years. In 1987, that alternation resumed and continued through 1993.

==Game summaries==

===Game 1===
Tuesday, October 7, 1986, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
Angels left fielder Brian Downing went 2-for-5 with four RBI and Mike Witt pitched a five-hit complete game, allowing just one run in the sixth on Marty Barrett&#x27;s RBI single after a two-out walk and single. After getting two outs, Red Sox starter Roger Clemens walked two in the second before Ruppert Jones&#x27;s RBI single, Wally Joyner&#x27;s RBI double, and Downing&#x27;s two-run single put the Angels up 4–0. Gary Pettis&#x27;s RBI single with two on extended their lead to 5–0, the run unearned due to shortstop Spike Owen&#x27;s throwing error to first on Bob Boone&#x27;s ground-ball. In the eighth, Dick Schofield singled with one out, stole second and scored on Boone&#x27;s single. After a Pettis single, Joe Sambito relieved Clemens and allowed a two-out walk to load the bases, then Downing&#x27;s two-run single capped the game&#x27;s scoring at 8–1 as the Angels took a 1–0 series lead.

===Game 2===
Wednesday, October 8, 1986, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
The next day, the tables were turned. The Red Sox struck first in the bottom of the first when Wade Boggs hit a leadoff triple off Kirk McCaskill and scored on Marty Barrett&#x27;s double. Barrett&#x27;s bases-loaded RBI single next inning made it 2–0 Red Sox, but Bill Buckner hit into an inning-ending double play to limit the damage. Dick Schofield&#x27;s bases-loaded single in the fourth cut the Red Sox&#x27;s lead to 2–1, but Bruce Hurst retired the next two batters to keep them in front. Next inning, Wally Joyner&#x27;s home run tied the game, but in the bottom half, Dwight Evans&#x27;s RBI double with two on put the Red Sox ahead for good, 3–2. Boston padded their lead in the seventh. An error, single and walk loaded the bases with one out before another error on Evans&#x27;s ground ball allowed one run to score and keep the bases loaded, then a third error on Rich Gedman&#x27;s force out allowed two more runs to score. Next inning, Buckner&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on first and third off Gary Lucas made it 7–2 Red Sox before Jim Rice&#x27;s home run off Doug Corbett capped the game&#x27;s scoring at 9–2. Hurst pitched a complete game as the Red Sox tied the series 1–1 heading to California. 

===Game 3===
Friday, October 10, 1986, at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California
In Game 3, the Red Sox struck first in the second on Rich Gedman&#x27;s RBI single with two on off John Candelaria, but after pitching five shutout innings, Oil Can Boyd allowed a game-tying RBI single to Reggie Jackson in the sixth. Dick Schofield&#x27;s two-out home run in the seventh put the Angels up 2–1. After Bob Boone singled, Gary Pettis&#x27;s two-run home run extended their lead to 4–1. The Red Sox scored two runs in the eighth on Donnie Moore&#x27;s balk with runners on second and third and Gedman&#x27;s RBI single, but the Angels padded their lead in the bottom half on Ruppert Jones&#x27;s sacrifice fly off Calvin Schiraldi. Moore pitched a scoreless ninth as the Angels went up 2–1 in the series with a 5–3 win. During the game, scoring on Reggie Jackson&#x27;s single, Wally Joyner suffered an opened staph infection, which would sideline him for the rest of the series.

===Game 4===
Saturday, October 11, 1986, at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California
Roger Clemens, the Game 1 loser for the Red Sox, started Game 4, and was solid for most of the game. Boston put up a run in the sixth on Bill Buckner&#x27;s RBI double with two on off Don Sutton. In the eighth, Spike Owen hit a leadoff single off Vern Ruhle, moved to third on a groundout and wild pitch, then scored on Marty Barrett&#x27;s single. Chuck Finley relieved Ruhle and a passed ball and error on Buckner&#x27;s ground ball allowed Barrett to score to make it 3–0 Red Sox. Another error and walk off Doug Corbett loaded the bases, but Rich Gedman hit into a forceout to end the inning. In the bottom of the ninth, Doug DeCinces led off with a home run. After the next batter grounded out, Dick Schofield and Bob Boone singled. After coming within two outs of a complete game, Clemens was removed, and Boone was replaced with a pinch runner. Gary Pettis, batting next, doubled to score Schofield. Ruppert Jones was intentionally walked to load the bases, a fatal mistake, as two batters later, Brian Downing was hit by a pitch, bringing in the tying run.

Angels relief pitcher Doug Corbett pitched a perfect tenth and eleventh innings, and California broke through in the bottom of the 11th.innings Jerry Narron scored on Bobby Grich&#x27;s one-out single off Calvin Schiraldi, giving California a 4–3 win and a 3–1 series lead.

===Game 5===
Sunday, October 12, 1986, at Anaheim Stadium in Anaheim, California
Heading into Game 5, California looked set to earn their first trip to a World Series. Rich Gedman&#x27;s two-run home run in the second put the Red Sox up 2–0, but Bob Boone&#x27;s home run off Bruce Hurst in the third cut the lead to 2–1. Bobby Grich, the previous night&#x27;s hero, hit a two-run home run to give the Halos a 3–2 lead in the sixth inning; Red Sox center fielder Dave Henderson had tried to leap at the wall to catch Grich&#x27;s long fly ball, but ended up deflecting it over the fence. The Angels added to their lead in the seventh inning off Bob Stanley on Rob Wilfong&#x27;s RBI double with two on and Brian Downing&#x27;s bases-loaded sacrifice fly.

In the ninth, Mike Witt allowed a leadoff single to Bill Buckner but struck out Jim Rice, putting him two outs away from his second complete game victory of the series. The next batter, Don Baylor, hit a two-strike, two-run home run to pull the Red Sox within one run. After retiring the next batter, Witt was replaced. Gary Lucas was brought in to face catcher Rich Gedman who had been 3 for 3 in the game against Witt, including a double and a home run. Lucas, on the other hand, had a history of striking Gedman out. But with his very first pitch, Lucas hit Gedman, and was replaced by Donnie Moore. The Angels closer brought his team within one strike of its first AL pennant, but Henderson caught hold of a Moore forkball and launched a home run into the left field stands, stunning the hometown crowd and greatly redeeming himself for his earlier miscue. Boston had taken a 6–5 lead.

The lead would not last, however, as in the bottom of the ninth, Bob Boone singled off Stanley, and Ruppert Jones pinch-ran for him. Gary Pettis sacrificed Jones to second, and Wilfong singled him home off Joe Sambito, tying the game. Dick Schofield then singled, sending Wilfong to third, and Downing was intentionally walked to load the bases with only one out. All of Boston&#x27;s top-half heroics would have been washed away with a mere sacrifice fly at this point. But instead, Doug DeCinces only managed to hit a short fly ball to right field. Grich&#x27;s subsequent line-out to pitcher Steve Crawford ended the inning.

The teams settled down and the tenth inning was again scoreless, but the Red Sox loaded the bases in the top of the 11th off Donnie Moore on a hit-by-pitch and two singles for Henderson. He hit a sacrifice fly, scoring Baylor with the go-ahead run. Calvin Schiraldi then retired the Halos in order in the bottom of the 11th, completing a shocking comeback and sending the series back to Boston.

===Game 6===
Tuesday, October 14, 1986, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
Still reeling from their Game 5 loss, the Angels struck first in the top of the first off Oil Can Boyd on back-to-back two-out RBI doubles by Reggie Jackson and Doug DeCinces after a one-out walk, but the Red Sox tied the game in the bottom of the inning off Kirk McCaskill without a hit. With runners on second and third and one out via two walks and a groundout, a passed ball and Jim Rice&#x27;s groundout scored both runners. In the third, after back-to-back leadoff singles, Marty Barrett&#x27;s RBI double put the Red Sox up 3–2, then Bill Buckner&#x27;s RBI single extended their lead to 4–2. After a forceout at home, Don Baylor&#x27;s two-run single (aided by first baseman Bobby Grich&#x27;s throwing error) and Dwight Evans&#x27;s RBI single made it 7–2 Red Sox. Dave Henderson&#x27;s bases-loaded groundout off Doug Corbett in the fifth made it 8–2 Red Sox. Brian Downing hit a home run in the top of the seventh off Boyd, but in the bottom of the inning, Spike Owen&#x27;s two-run triple off Corbett after a single and walk made it 10–3 Red Sox. The Angels got a run in the eighth off Bob Stanley on shortstop Owen&#x27;s throwing error on Rob Wilfong with Dick Schofield at second, but could not score again as the Red Sox&#x27;s 10–4 win forced a deciding Game 7.

===Game 7===
Wednesday, October 15, 1986, at Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts
In Game 7, the Red Sox loaded the bases in the second off John Candelaria with no outs on an error, single and walk. Rich Gedman&#x27;s groundout scored a run and after an intentional walk reloaded the bases, Wade Boggs&#x27;s two-run single made it 3–0 Red Sox. In the fourth Dave Henderson reached third on an error, then scored on Spike Owen&#x27;s single. After a two-out walk, Jim Rice&#x27;s three-run home run made it 7–0 Red Sox, all runs unearned. Dwight Evans&#x27;s home run in the seventh off Don Sutton made it 8–0 Red Sox. The Angels scored their only run of the game on Doug DeCinces&#x27;s RBI single off Calvin Schiraldi, the run charged to starter Roger Clemens. Schiraldi pitched two innings to close as the Red Sox advanced to the World Series with an 8–1 win after trailing the series three games to one. It was their first pennant in 11 years.

1986 ALCS (4–3): Boston Red Sox over California Angels
==Aftermath==
By virtue of winning the ALCS, the Red Sox advanced to the 1986 World Series, where they faced the New York Mets, with memorable results. Like the Angels in the ALCS, the Red Sox found themselves one strike away from winning the World Series, yet could not hold the lead. Taking a 5–3 lead into the bottom of the tenth inning of Game 6, the Red Sox gave up three runs, culminating in an infamous ground ball through the legs of Bill Buckner to hand the Mets a 6–5 victory. The Mets would go on to win Game 7 and the Series.

As for the Angels, Donnie Moore was regarded the goat of the series for giving up Henderson&#x27;s home run in Game 5, and then his game-winning sacrifice fly two innings later. Moore was blasted by the sports media, as well as the fans. He sank into depression and alcoholism over the next two years, and committed suicide on July 18, 1989, just one year after his MLB career ended.

The 1986 ALCS was Reggie Jackson’s last playoff series. He retired the following season in 1987, playing for the team that originally drafted him, the Oakland Athletics. Nicknamed Mr. October, Jackson always seemed to elevate his game during the biggest stage. He finished his career hitting .278/.358/.527 with 18 home runs in 77 career games in the postseason, which was highlighted by two World Series MVPs in 1973 and 1977.

1986 was also Gene Mauch&#x27;s last chance at winning a pennant. In his 26 years as manager, his name became linked with coming up just short, coming three times within a single victory of reaching a World Series. In 1964, his Philadelphia Phillies suffered a dramatic collapse during the final two weeks of the season. The &quot;Phold of &#x27;64&quot;, as it became known, was one of the most infamous collapses in baseball history. Mauch won two division titles in his managerial career (both with the Angels) and three NL Manager of the Year Awards. Many of his fellow managers considered him the most insightful and tactical manager in his day, including Alvin Dark; although one of the important reasons his teams never reached the highest heights was that &quot;he didn&#x27;t understand pitching&quot;, according to Dark. Mauch retired in 1987 with 3,942 games managed and 1,902 games won, by far the winningest manager to have never won a league pennant.

In retrospect, most people consider the 1986 postseason to be one of the best (if not the best) postseasons of all time, as it not only was exciting but also made up for a lackluster regular season, in which the Red Sox, Angels, Mets, and Houston Astros all won their divisions handily.

In 2002, the Angels would finally have their moment(s) of glory. They would win the American League Wild Card, as well as their Division Series (dethroning the four-time defending A.L. champion N.Y. Yankees in four games), their first pennant (over Minnesota in five games), and their first World Series title (over San Francisco in seven games).

In 2004, the Angels and Red Sox met in the American League Division Series with the Red Sox sweeping the series. The Red Sox would eventually go on to defeat the New York Yankees for their first pennant since 1986 and also win their first World Series title since against the St. Louis Cardinals.

In 2007, the Angels and Red Sox met again in the ALDS. The Red Sox again swept the series, continuing their domination of the Halos in the postseason. From Game 4 of the 1986 ALCS until Game 3 of the 2008 ALDS, the Angels lost 11 straight playoff games against the Red Sox, who won all four playoff meetings against them in that span. The Red Sox would win the 2008 ALDS three games to one despite losing eight of nine regular season games against the Angels. In 2009, the Angels finally broke through and defeated the Red Sox in a sweep of the ALDS.

<text>Jack Levine (January 3, 1915November 8, 2010) was an American Social Realist painter and printmaker best known for his satires on modern life, political corruption, and biblical narratives. Levine is considered one of the key artists of the Boston Expressionist movement.

==Early life and education==

Jack Levine was the eighth child born to Samuel and Mary Levine, Lithuanian Jewish immigrants. He grew up in the South End of Boston, where he observed a street life composed of European immigrants and a prevalence of poverty and societal ills, subjects which would inform his work. His mother encouraged him to draw and stored his art materials in the family kitchen. On visits to his father&#x27;s shoe store, he was given brown wrapping paper on which he would draw. Subjects of his childhood drawings included mature subjects such as National Guardsmen patrolling the streets in military attire during the Boston Police strike of 1919.

Levine&#x27;s first formal artistic education was studying with artist and art educator Harold K. Zimmerman at the Jewish Welfare Center in Roxbury from 1924 to 1931. Another one of Zimmerman&#x27;s young art students was Hyman Bloom. From 1929 to 1933, Levine and Bloom studied with Denman Ross at Harvard University. As an adolescent, Levine was already, by his own account, &quot;a formidable draftsman&quot;. Ross sponsored Bloom and Levine&#x27;s studies via a weekly stipend, as well as studio space.

==Career==

In 1932, Ross included Levine&#x27;s drawings in an exhibition at the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, and three years later bequeathed twenty drawings by Levine to the museum&#x27;s collection. Levine&#x27;s early work was most influenced by Bloom, Chaïm Soutine, Georges Rouault, and Oskar Kokoschka. Along with Bloom and Karl Zerbe, he became associated with the style known as Boston Expressionism.

From 1935 to 1940, he was employed by the Works Progress Administration. In 1936, Levine had his first exhibition of paintings in New York City in &quot;New Horizons in American Art&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art. The paintings selected for the exhibition were &quot;Card Game&quot; and &quot;Brain Trust&quot;, the latter was painted from his observation of life in the Boston Common. In 1937, his &quot;The Feast of Pure Reason&quot;, a satire of Boston political power, was placed on loan to the Museum of Modern Art. In the same year &quot;String Quartet&quot; was shown at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and purchased in 1942 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The death of his father in 1939 prompted a series of paintings of Jewish sages.

From 1942-45, Levine served in the United States Army during World War II. Upon his discharge from service he painted &quot;Welcome Home&quot; (1946), a lampoon of the arrogance of military power. In 1959, the painting would engender political controversy when it was included in the &quot;American National Exhibition&quot; in Moscow, raising suspicions in the House Un-American Activities Committee of pro-Communist sympathies. President Dwight D. Eisenhower called the painting &quot;more lampoon than art.&quot;

Levine was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship in 1945. With a Fulbright grant he traveled to Europe in 1951, and was affected by the work of the Old Masters, particularly the Mannerism of El Greco, which inspired him to distort and exaggerate the forms of his figures for expressive purposes.

After returning to the United States, Levine continued to paint biblical subjects, and also produced &quot;Gangster Funeral&quot;, a narrative which Levine referred to as a &quot;comedy&quot;. Further commentary on American life was furnished by &quot;Election Night&quot; (1954), &quot;Inauguration&quot; (1958), and &quot;Thirty- Five Minutes from Times Square&quot; (1956). Also in the late 1950s, Levine painted a series of sensitive portraits of his wife and daughter. In the 1960s, he responded not only to social unrest in the United States with works such as &quot;Birmingham &#x27;63&quot; (1963), but to international subjects as well, as in &quot;The Spanish Prison&quot; (1959–1962), &quot;Panethnikon&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Arms Brokers&quot; (1982–83). Levine once said of himself, &quot;I am primarily concerned with the condition of man.&quot; Following his own direction, he created a distinct body of socially conscious art that probes the strengths and weaknesses of humanity.

In 1979 Levine was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member and became a full Academician in 1982. Following the death of his wife in 1982, he developed an increased interest in Hebraism, and with it a proliferation of paintings with themes from the Hebrew Bible.

==Exhibitions and collections==
Levine&#x27;s work is featured in many public collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Brooklyn Museum, the Phillips Collection, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Fogg Art Museum, and the National Gallery of Art. In 1973 the Vatican purchased &quot;Cain and Abel&quot; (1961), to the satisfaction of Pope Paul VI.

In 1978, a retrospective of Levine&#x27;s work was held at the Jewish Museum (New York). He was the subject of a 1989 film documentary entitled &quot;Feast of Pure Reason&quot;.

In 2005, at the age of 90, Levine was given a mini-retrospective exhibition at DC Moore Gallery in New York City.

==Personal life and death==
In 1946, he married the painter Ruth Gikow and moved to New York City. They had one daughter, Susanna who also became an artist.

Levine died at his home in Manhattan, New York on November 8, 2010, at the age of 95.

After the United States entered World War II, he served in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1946, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. Burdick was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest non-combat decoration awarded for heroism by the Navy, for rescuing four injured men by diving into a sea full of burning oil while under artillery fire.

Thereafter, he pursued graduate studies at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar in 1948 and ultimately earned a PhD with a dissertation on the role of modern syndicalism in European politics.

Burdick spent much of his career as a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, where he oversaw an integrated course in the social sciences (encompassing elements of political science, economics, sociology and philosophy) and served as a consultant to the university&#x27;s administration. While on leave from 1950 to 1952, he served as assistant to the president of the Naval War College. Among other professional activities, he was a member of the governing board of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions and a member of the Indonesian-American Society, the Polynesian Research Society and the Migratory Labor Association.

==Writing career==
He first gained national attention as a writer of fiction in 1947 when &quot;Rest Camp on Maui,&quot; a short story derived from his wartime experiences that was published by &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, received the O. Henry Award second prize. In 1956 his first novel, &quot;The Ninth Wave&quot;, was published, and was a Book of the Month Club selection. At the close of the 1950s, he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research.

==Political views==
He was a Cold War liberal, supporting the Vietnam War, though he was critical of how the United States government went about it. &quot;The Ugly American&quot; portrayed American representatives losing the battle for hearts and minds to the Soviet Union in the fictional Asian kingdom of Sarkhan. (The book&#x27;s depictions created controversy: President Dwight Eisenhower called the book &quot;sickening,&quot; claiming that it distorted the truth.) He also advocated nuclear disarmament.

He was scheduled to speak in defense of the administration at the Berkeley Teach-in in May 1965 before withdrawing at the last minute, alleging that those attending weren&#x27;t interested in a dialogue.

==Death==
Burdick died in 1965 of a heart attack, while playing tennis, in San Diego, California, at the age of 46. After his death, it was reported that he was a diabetic who struggled with chronic heart disease. He had also had a prior heart attack in 1959. He was survived by his wife Carol and three children.

<doc id="1043769" wikidata="Q1942139" url="?curid=1043769" title="MAC times">
<text>MAC times are pieces of file system metadata which record when certain events pertaining to a computer file occurred most recently. The events are usually described as &quot;modification&quot; (the data in the file was modified), &quot;access&quot; (some part of the file was read), and &quot;metadata change&quot; (the file&#x27;s permissions or ownership were modified), although the acronym is derived from the &quot;mtime&quot;, &quot;atime&quot;, and &quot;ctime&quot; structures maintained by Unix file systems. Windows file systems do not update ctime when a file&#x27;s metadata is changed, instead using the field to record the time when a file was first created, known as &quot;creation time&quot; or &quot;birth time&quot;. Some other systems also record birth times for files, but there is no standard name for this metadata; ZFS, for example, stores birth time in a field called &quot;crtime&quot;. MAC times are commonly used in computer forensics. The name Mactime was originally coined by Dan Farmer, who wrote a tool with the same name.

== Modification time (mtime) ==

A file&#x27;s modification time describes when the content of the file most recently changed. Because most file systems do not compare data written to a file with what is already there, if a program overwrites part of a file with the same data as previously existed in that location, the modification time will be updated even though the contents did not technically change.

== Access time (atime) ==

A file&#x27;s access time identifies when the file was most recently opened for reading. Access times are usually updated even if only a small portion of a large file is examined. A running program can maintain a file as &quot;open&quot; for some time, so the time at which a file was opened may differ from the time data was most recently read from the file.

Because some computer configurations are much faster at reading data than at writing it, updating access times after every read operation can be very expensive. Some systems mitigate this cost by storing access times at a coarser granularity than other times; by rounding access times only to the nearest hour or day, a file which is read repeatedly in a short time frame will only need its access time updated once. In Windows, this is addressed by waiting for up to an hour to flush updated access dates to the disk.

Some systems also provide options to disable access time updating altogether. In Windows, starting with Vista, file access time updating is disabled by default.

== Change time and creation time (ctime) ==

Unix and Windows file systems interpret &#x27;ctime&#x27; differently:

* Unix systems maintain the historical interpretation of ctime as being the time when certain file metadata, &quot;not its contents&quot;, were last changed, such as the file&#x27;s permissions or owner (e.g. &#x27;This file&#x27;s metadata was &quot;changed&quot; on 05/05/02 12:15pm&#x27;).
* Windows systems use ctime to mean &#x27;creation time&#x27; (also called &#x27;birth time&#x27;) (e.g. &#x27;This file was &quot;created&quot; on 05/05/02 12:15pm&#x27;).

This difference in usage can lead to incorrect presentation of time metadata when a file created on a Windows system is accessed on a Unix system and vice versa. Although not specified by POSIX, most modern Unix file systems (such as ext4, HFS+, ZFS, and UFS2) allow to store the creation time.
NTFS stores both the creation time and the change time.

The semantics of creation times is the source of some controversy. One view is that creation times should refer to the actual content of a file: e.g. for a digital photo the creation time would note when the photo was taken or first stored on a computer. A different approach is for creation times to stand for when the file system object itself was created, e.g. when the photo file was last restored from a backup or moved from one disk to another.

== Metadata issues ==

As with all file system metadata, user expectations about MAC times can be violated by programs which are not metadata-aware. Some file-copying utilities will explicitly set MAC times of the new copy to match those of the original file, while programs that simply create a new file, read the contents of the original, and write that data into the new copy, will produce new files whose times do not match those of the original.

Some programs, in an attempt to avoid losing data if a write operation is interrupted, avoid modifying existing files. Instead, the updated data is written to a new file, and the new file is moved to overwrite the original. This practice loses the original file metadata unless the program explicitly copies the metadata from the original file. Windows is not affected by this due to a workaround feature called File System Tunneling.

<text>Raymond Veveysan Vernède (9 December 1905 – 18 October 2003) was an English colonial administrator in India and a writer. He was educated at Bradfield College and Hertford College, Oxford. He was in the Indian Civil Service from 1928 to 1947; later he became Bursar of St Peter&#x27;s College, Oxford.

On 6 November 1937, at Lucknow, he married Nancy Mary Kendall, younger daughter of Sir Charles and Lady Kendall of Weir House, Countess Weir, Devon. Sir Charles Kendall, a Judge in the Allahabad High Court, was in various posts in the Indian Civil Service, shifting towards the judicial side of things after his marriage in 1910.

He is known for two books based on his experiences in Garhwal in the Himalayas: &quot;The Enchanted Loom&quot;, a historical novel, and &quot;The Collector&#x27;s Bag&quot;, stories. He also edited &quot;British Life in India&quot; (1995), an anthology of writings, and &quot;A Sounding of Verses&quot;.

<text>A writ of coram nobis (also writ of error &quot;coram nobis,writ of &quot;coram vobis, or writ of error &quot;coram vobis&quot;) is a legal order allowing a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a fundamental error that did not appear in the records of the original judgment&#x27;s proceedings and that would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced. 

In the United Kingdom, the common law writ is superseded by the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c. 76) and the Criminal Appeal Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7. c. 23).

The writ survives in the United States in federal courts, in the courts of sixteen states, and the District of Columbia courts. Each state has its own &quot;coram nobis&quot; procedures. A writ of coram nobis can be granted only by the court where the original judgment was entered, so those seeking to correct a judgment must understand the criteria required for that jurisdiction.

==Terminology==
A writ is an official written command, while a writ of error provides a superior court the means to correct errors of a lower court. A writ of error &quot;coram nobis&quot; is a variation of the writ of error providing a court with the means to correct its own errors. &quot;Coram nobis&quot; is Latin for &quot;before us&quot;. Initially, when the Lord Chancellor issued orders on behalf of the King and the royal court, the word &quot;us&quot; simply referred to the King, the Lord Chancellor, and other judges of the royal court. The meaning of its full form, , is &quot;which [things] remain in our presence&quot;. 

Over time, the authority to issue writs shifted from the Lord Chancellor to the courts. Although the King was no longer part of the court issuing the writ, the name &quot;&quot;coram nobis&quot; continued because courts associated the name with its function rather than its original Latin meaning. Thus, in English law, the definition of &quot;coram nobis&quot;&quot; evolved and is now redefined as a remedy for a court to correct its own error.

==History==

The writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; originated in the courts of common law in the English legal system during the sixteenth century. The writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; still exists today in a few courts in the United States, where it applies only to criminal proceedings, not civil ones. 

===Common law===

In English common law, a &quot;petition of error&quot; requested higher courts to review the legality of an order or sentence (similar to what is now known as an appeal). The writ of error was an original writ which began a legal proceeding (other writs were issued during proceedings). Petitioners brought a petition of error before the Lord Chancellor. If a lower court committed an error of law, the Lord Chancellor would issue a writ of error. A writ of error required the lower court to deliver the &quot;record&quot; of the case to a superior court where the court reviewed the case for legal errors. Because a writ of error was only available for a higher court to determine if a lower court committed an error of law, courts needed another type of writ to correct its own decision upon an error of fact. To rectify this issue, the Lord Chancellor created a new writ - the writ of error &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Thus, the original writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; provided the means to correct errors that the writ of error could not correct. Unlike the writ of error, the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;:
# corrected only factual errors that were not raised in the original case proceedings,
# allowed the same court that presided over the original case to correct its own error, and
# required the original case records to remain with the court that presided over the original case.

====Abolition in English courts====
The first case involving the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is unknown due to incomplete historical records prior to the sixteenth century; however, the first recorded case involving the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; occurred in 1561 in the case of &quot;Sir Gilbert Debenham and Another v. Bateman&quot;. 

Until 1705, the writ of error was originally a matter entirely up to the discretion of either the monarch or those with the authority to make decisions on behalf of the monarch; but in 1705, the court held that the writ was a matter of right instead of a matter of discretion. Despite making writs of error a matter of right, courts rarely used these writs because of their cumbersome and impractical procedure. A writ of error moved the record from the original court to a higher court; however, the record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict. The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge&#x27;s direction to the jury. 

As a result, England abolished all writs of error, including the writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot; and &quot;coram vobis&quot;, and replaced them with appellate procedures encompassing all rights previously available through these writs. Thus, the abolition of the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in England was due mostly to administration difficulties with the writ of error, and not because of administration difficulties with the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; itself. 

The law abolishing the writ in civil cases was section 148 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852. The law abolishing the writ in criminal cases was section 20 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1907.

===United States===
After arriving in North America in the seventeenth century, English settlers established English colonies. Within these colonies, the settlers created colonial courts that adhered to the English legal system and issued writs in the same manner as English courts. After the United States obtained independence from England, state governments, as well as the federal government, provided courts the authority to continue to rely upon writs as a source of law unless issuing the writ violated the state or federal constitution or if either the state or federal government subsequently enacted a statute restricting the writ. The purpose of allowing courts to issue writs was to fill a void whenever the state constitution, state statutes, the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes did not address an issue to be decided before the court. Writs were especially important when the federal government, as well as each state, first established its judicial system. During those times, there were very few (if any) statutes or case laws for courts to rely upon as guidance. In those circumstances, the English writs provided fledgling federal and state courts an important source of law.
Over time, writs became significantly less important as Congress and state legislatures enacted more statutes and further defined rules for its judiciary. Writs also evolved independently in the federal judicial system and each state&#x27;s judicial system so that a writ within one judicial systems may have a vastly different purpose and procedures from the same writ in other judicial systems. Different characteristics of a writ from one judicial system to another is the result of the federal system of government prescribed within the United States Constitution. Federalism in the United States is a mixed system of government that combines a national federal government and state governments. While federal courts are superior to state courts in federal matters, the Constitution limits the reach of federal courts; thereby, providing state courts general sovereignty and law-making authority over a wider range of topics. This sovereignty allows each judicial system to decide whether to adopt writs and the function and purpose of each writ it adopts. Thus, the use and application of writs, including the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;, can vary within each of these judicial systems.

Legislation authorizes a judicial system to issue the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; under one of two conditions:
#Where legislation permits courts to issue writs, but the legislation does not specifically mention the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Courts throughout the United States generally have the authority to issue writs whenever the constitution or statutes encompassing a court&#x27;s jurisdiction do not address an issue before the court and issuance of the writ is necessary to achieve justice. This authority was especially important for earlier courts when there were few statutes or case law to rely upon. Over time, legislatures enacted statutes encompassing almost all issues that could arise before a court. As a result, courts today rarely need to rely on writs as a source of law to address an issue not covered by statute. One example of a rare issue where courts have the occasion to issue the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is the issue of former federal prisoners who have new information and this new information would have resulted in a different verdict if the information were available at the time of trial. Whenever this specific issue comes before a federal court, there is no federal statute that specifically guides or regulates how the court must proceed; however, federal courts have determined that the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is the proper vehicle to achieve justice under this specific issue.
#Where legislation specifically permits courts to issue, by name, the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. The use of writs in the United States is more common when legislation has authorized a writ by name and regulated its use by courts. For earlier courts, the practice of issuing writs was an integral part of the judicial system&#x27;s proceedings. Therefore, when legislatures enacted laws to regulate issues associated with writs, some legislatures adopted the exact name of the writ within its rules while other legislatures chose to abolish the names of the writ but provided an alternative remedy under a different name. Tennessee is an example of a state where its legislature enacted a statute expressly authorizing courts to issue, by name, the &quot;Writ of Error Coram Nobis&quot; and regulated how this writ should be issued. In contrast, other states replaced the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; with other post-conviction remedies. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a law on January 25, 1966, that expressly abolished the name &quot;writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;&quot; and enacted the state&#x27;s Post Conviction Relief Act, which is now the sole means for obtaining post-conviction relief.

==&quot;Coram nobis&quot; in United States federal courts==
In 1789, Congress passed the Judiciary Act to establish the judicial courts in the United States. This act also allows courts to issue writs, including the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Originally, federal courts applied the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; only to correct technical errors, such as those made by a clerk of the court in the records of the proceedings. The 1914 Supreme Court case &quot;United States v. Mayer&quot; expanded the scope of the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to include fundamental errors, but the Court declined in this case to decide whether federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. In 1954, the Supreme Court determined in &quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; that federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to correct fundamental errors, such as those where discovery of new information is sufficient to prove a convicted felon is actually innocent. Since the &quot;Morgan&quot; case, federal courts traditionally issue a writ of coram nobis whenever a former federal prisoner petitions the original sentencing court to set aside the conviction based upon new information that was not available when the petitioner was in custody and where this new information demonstrates that the conviction was a result of a fundamental error.

===History of the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in federal courts from 1789 to 1954===

====The Judiciary Act of 1789====
The history of the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in United States federal courts began in 1789 when Congress enacted the Judiciary Act. Under Section 14 of the Judiciary Act, federal courts have the authority to issue a writ whenever the court deems it necessary to achieve justice and whenever no congressional law covers the issues before the court. This section was known as the &quot;All-Writs Provision&quot; of the Judiciary Act until 1948 when it became more commonly known as the &quot;All-Writs Act&quot; after Congress modified the Judicial Code and consolidated this provision into . Under the All Writs Act, federal district courts have the &quot;power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specifically provided for by statute&quot;. Congress had not specifically provided by statute the authority for federal courts to issue a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;; therefore, the All Writs Act provides federal courts this authority.

The first case in a federal court to address the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; was &quot;Strode v. The Stafford Justices&quot; in 1810. In this case, the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the opinion in this Circuit Court case and held that the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is distinguishable from the writ of error and therefore not subject to the writ of error&#x27;s statute of limitations. The first Supreme Court case mentioning the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; (using the term &quot;coram vobis&quot;) is the 1833 case, &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Heirs v. Legerwood&quot;. In this case, the Court determined that the writ was available to correct its own errors, but the same remedy was also available using the preferred method of submitting a motion to the court. Eighty years later, in 1914, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in &quot;United States v. Mayer&quot;. Thus, while federal courts confirmed the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; was available to federal courts, this remedy was rarely necessary or appropriate in federal courts throughout the nineteenth century for the following two reasons:
#Courts generally considered the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to be restricted to correct only technical errors, such as discovery of a defendant being under age, evidence that a defendant died before the verdict, or errors made by the court clerk in the recording of the proceedings.
#Petitioners could raise a &quot;motion to amend&quot; to correct most of errors also corrected by the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Although courts recognized that the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; could also reverse the judgement on such defects, the preferred practice was to present the court with a motion to amend.

====1946 amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure ====
In 1946, Congress amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and specifically abolished the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in federal civil cases. Prior to enactment of these amendments, Congress reviewed all relief previously provided for civil cases through the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; and adopted those avenues of relief into the rules; therefore, eliminating the need for the writ in federal civil cases. In the amendment, Congress expressly abolished the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in Rule 60(b). Later, in 2007, Congress restructured the format of Rule 60, and moved the language expressly abolishing the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in civil proceedings from Rule 60(b) to Rule 60(e) in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

===History of post-conviction remedies available to former federal prisoners from 1789 to 1954===
====Post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners prior to 1867====
In 1790, one year after Congress passed the Judiciary Act establishing federal courts, Congress enacted the Crimes Act which created the first comprehensive list of federal offenses. From 1790 until 1867, there are few, if any, records of individuals challenging a federal criminal conviction after completion of the prison sentence. Two primary reasons explain the absence of any challenges to a conviction by former federal prisoners:
#The Crimes List provided only twenty-three federal crimes. Seven of these crimes, including treason and murder, were punishable by death. (In comparison, today there are approximately 3,600 to 4,500 federal statutes that impose criminal punishments.) There are an estimated 500,000 former federal prisoners. Despite this large population, recent cases where a former federal prisoner is able to find new information sufficient to reverse the conviction are exceedingly rare. Thus, the chances of this type of case arising prior to 1867, when the federal prison population was significantly smaller, are even more remote.
#There were few collateral consequences stemming from a conviction at this time. Generally, the reason former convicted felons seek a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is to eliminate collateral consequences ensuing the challenged conviction. Collateral consequences are indirect consequences of a conviction. While direct consequences of a conviction are usually issued by a judge in the sentencing phase of a case (such as a prison sentence, probation, fines and restitution); indirect consequences of a conviction are not contained within a court sentence. Collateral consequences may include loss of voting privileges, loss of professional licenses, inability to qualify for some employment and housing opportunities, and damage to the person&#x27;s reputation.

====The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867====
The American Civil War is historically significant upon the rights of former federal prisoners in two ways. First, Congress enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 to prevent abuses following the civil war. This Act expanded the writ of habeas corpus to any person, including former prisoners. Second, states began imposing more collateral consequences upon those convicted of crimes; thus, providing more reasons why a person would want to have a wrongful conviction overturned. The loss of voting privileges was one of the most significant collateral consequences of a felony conviction. In 1800, no state prohibited convicted felons from voting; but by end of the U.S. Civil War, nearly 80% of state legislatures had passed laws barring felons the right to vote.

Slavery was legal in the United States until the 1860s. In the 1860 U.S. presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, supported the elimination of slavery. This controversial issue was the catalyst for the American Civil War that began in 1861 following the election of Lincoln and concluded in 1865. On March 3, 1865, President Lincoln signed a joint resolution declaring wives and children of persons in the armed forces to be free; and on December 18, 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution became effective. This Amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude in the United States. The purpose of the Habeas Act was to provide &quot;what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States to enforce the freedom of the wife and children of soldiers of the United States, and also to enforce the liberty of all persons&quot;.

The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 expanded the jurisdiction of the writ of habeas corpus to &quot;any person&quot;. One year later, the Supreme Court implied that this Act had no custody requirements. The Court said the Act &quot;is of the most comprehensive character. It brings within the habeas corpus jurisdiction of every court and of every judge every possible case of privation of liberty contrary to the National Constitution, treaties, or laws. It is impossible to widen this jurisdiction.&quot; The Court&#x27;s interpretation of this act seemed to eliminate the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in criminal cases because any person challenging a conviction, regardless of whether the person is in prison or not, could have raised the claim through the writ of habeas corpus.

Although the Act expanded habeas jurisdiction to &quot;any person&quot;, it also required that an application for the writ include &quot;facts concerning the detention of the party applying, [and] in whose custody he or she is detained&quot;. In 1885, the Supreme Court read these application requirements as an intent by Congress to restrict the writ of habeas corpus to only those who were physically restrained in jail. Thus, the Court foreclosed the writ of habeas corpus to those no longer in custody.

===&quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; (1954) provides writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to former federal prisoners===

In 1948, Congress passed legislation that would lead to the official recognition of the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in federal courts. The Act of June 25, 1948 combined two pieces of legislation:
#Congress passed the Act to organize all laws of the United States into a single source of reference, known as the United States Code (abbreviated U.S.C.). Any law (or statute) ever passed by Congress can be found in the United States Code. The U.S.C. is divided into 50 titles. Within each title is a chapter, and within each chapter is a section. For example, one of the titles created in the Act was Title 28 – Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. Chapter 153 of this title is the chapter on Habeas Corpus. Section 2255 of this title is the section providing how prisoners can challenge a conviction. In legal documents, this section is commonly abbreviated 28 U.S.C. §2255.
#Congress passed the Act to solve a problem with habeas corpus petitions. The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 instructed prisoners to file a writ of habeas corpus with the district court whose territory included the prison. For example, those imprisoned at Alcatraz Island, California were required to file a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, even if the prisoner&#x27;s conviction and sentence originated from a federal court in another district or state. This rule led to administrative difficulties, especially for the five district courts whose territorial jurisdiction included major federal prisons. The Act of June 25, 1948 codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and judicial habeas practice at 28 U.S.C. §2255 and changed the jurisdiction from the district of confinement to the district of sentence; however, the jurisdictional change was the only change Congress intended.

The Act of June 25, 1948 reworded the habeas corpus sections of the United States Code to provide only those individuals in custody (as a result of a criminal conviction in federal court) access to the writ of habeas corpus. For those who had been convicted of a federal crime but were no longer in custody, the question was whether the 1948 Act abolished all post-conviction review of a former prisoner&#x27;s conviction.

In 1952 Robert Morgan, a former federal prisoner who had completed his sentence, petitioned to have his conviction overturned based on information he claimed to be unavailable at the time of his conviction. The district court denied his petition because Morgan was no longer in custody for the conviction he sought to overturn. Morgan appealed that decision. In 1953, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and determined that the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; was available to Morgan. The government appealed the appellate court&#x27;s decision to the US Supreme Court.

The first question in &quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; was whether Congress intended to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners when it restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. If the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not intend to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners, then the second question in &quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; was whether the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; was available to challenge a conviction after completion of the petitioner&#x27;s sentence. On January 4, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision. The Court first determined that Congress did not intend within the 1948 Act to eliminate all reviews of criminal convictions for petitioners who had completed their sentence. Although the 1948 Act restricted former prisoners from challenging a conviction with a writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined by reviewing the legislative notes that Congress did not intend to abolish post-conviction challenges to a sentence from former prisoners. Justice Stanley Reed, who authored the majority opinion for the Court, wrote;
[T]he purpose of § 2255 was &quot;to meet practical difficulties&quot; in the administration of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction. ... Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners&#x27; rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. We know of nothing in the legislative history that indicates a different conclusion. We do not think that the enactment of § 2255 is a bar to this motion, and we hold that the District Court has power to grant [the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;]. Although Congress did restrict the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners, the Court determined that the All Writs Act provides federal courts the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis to former prisoners whenever new evidence proves the underlying conviction was a result of a fundamental error. Thus, &quot;Morgan&quot; officially recognized the writ of coram nobis as the sole means for post-incarceration judicial review of federal convictions.

===Source of rules and procedures governing &quot;coram nobis&quot; proceedings===
&quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; provides broad, general guidance to courts on the rules and procedures in &quot;coram nobis&quot; proceedings, but since the &quot;Morgan&quot; case in 1954, the Supreme Court and Congress seldom provide lower courts additional guidance. Thus, Appellate courts generally fill in the gaps and provide guidance for rules and procedures unclarified by Congress and the Supreme Court; however, the interpretations of rules and procedures of &quot;coram nobis&quot; may differ in each appellate court. Thus, for a former federal prisoner who is attempting to decide whether to file a petition for the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;, it is necessary to understand the source of the rules and procedures.

The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. Article One of the Constitution creates the legislature and provides Congress the means to create and enact laws. Article Three of the Constitution creates the judiciary and provides courts the means to interpret laws. Other than the writ of habeas corpus, the Constitution has no language permitting or restricting courts from issuing specific writs, including the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;.

====Congressional enactments====
The United States Congress enacts laws or statutes, and codifies these statutes in the United States Code. In contrast to the writ of habeas corpus, Congress has seldom enacted statutes regulating the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Statutes enacted by Congress regulating the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; are:
*In 1789, Congress enacted the Judicial Act. The All Writs Act section of the Judiciary Act provides federal courts the authority to issue &quot;all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law&quot;. The All Writs Act gives courts the ability to decide which specific writs utilized in English courts are available and appropriate in U.S. federal courts. While Congress provides federal courts the authority to issue writs, it does not provide courts the authority to issue specific writs by name, such as writs of mandamus or writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. The code for the All Writs Act is .
*In 1946, Congress amended the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to abolish the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in federal civil cases. Prior to enacting this statute, Congress reviewed all issues previously addressed by federal courts in writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; proceedings, and incorporated remedies for those issues within the procedures. Rule 60(e) of this Procedure originated from this statute and states, &quot;The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot;, &quot;coram vobis&quot;, and &quot;audita querela&quot;.&quot;
*In 2002, Congress enacted Rule 4(a)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to resolve a conflict among the federal appellate courts regarding the time limitations to file an appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Prior to this amendment, the federal appellate courts were divided on whether &quot;coram nobis&quot; appeals have a 10-day time limit or a 60-day time limit. Rule 4(a)(1)(C) resolved the conflict and established a 60-day time limit to file the notice of appeal from a district court&#x27;s judgement in a &quot;coram nobis&quot; proceeding.

====United States Supreme Court decisions====
Following the Constitution and Congressional statutes, the next highest source for direction and guidance of rules and procedures is the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is the highest federal court. Lower courts, such as federal appellate courts and federal district courts, must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction, meaning the Court chooses to hear cases for reasons it deems &quot;compelling reasons&quot; (such as resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or resolving an important matter of law). Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, cannot override any law enacted by Congress unless the law violates the Constitution. Federal courts also cannot repeal a statute unless Congress clearly intended to repeal the statute.
In 1954, &quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; provides writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to former federal prisoners. The Court determined &quot;coram nobis&quot; relief &quot;should be allowed ... only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice&quot;. Specifically, the circumstances must include all three of these conditions:
*to remedy errors &quot;of the most fundamental character&quot;
*when &quot;no other remedy [is] then available&quot;
*&quot;sound reasons [exist] for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief&quot;.

Since 1954, the Supreme Court granted review of only one other &quot;coram nobis&quot; case. In 2009, the Court clarified that Article I military courts have jurisdiction to entertain &quot;coram nobis&quot; petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect. Other than providing military courts the authority to issue the writ, the Supreme Court has declined to provide federal courts additional guidance in &quot;coram nobis&quot; proceedings. Appellate courts have occasionally criticized the Supreme Court for failing to provide this additional guidance. The Seventh Circuit called the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;, &quot;a phantom in the Supreme Court&#x27;s cases&quot; and contends &quot;Two ambiguous decisions on the subject in the history of the Supreme Court are inadequate.&quot; The Sixth Circuit took a similar stance saying, &quot;The Supreme Court has decided only one coram nobis case in the last forty-two years, &quot;Morgan&quot;, and that opinion is ambiguous concerning whether proof of an ongoing civil disability is required.&quot; The First Circuit wrote that its decision of time limitations &quot;derives from the Morgan Court&#x27;s cryptic characterization of &quot;coram nobis&quot; as a &#x27;step in the criminal case. In another case, the First Circuit writes, &quot;The metes and bounds of the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; are poorly defined and the Supreme Court has not developed an easily readable roadmap for its issuance.&quot;

====Federal courts of appeals decisions====
While the United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States federal court system, the United States courts of appeals, or circuit courts, are the intermediate appellate courts. There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals. Eleven courts of appeals are numbered First through Eleventh and have geographical boundaries of various sizes. For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of all federal courts in only three states: Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of nine western states and two U.S. territories. There is also a Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Other tribunals also have &quot;Court of Appeals&quot; in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which hears appeals in court-martial cases.

Congressional statutes and Supreme Court decisions are controlling over courts of appeals. Absent statutory rules or Supreme Court case law, a court of appeals decision establishes a binding precedent for the courts in its circuit; however, a court of appeals decision is not binding for courts in other circuits. Generally, when a court of appeals hears an issue raised for the first time in that court, it arrives at the same conclusion as other courts of appeals on identical issues raised before those courts. However, whenever the courts of appeals arrive at different conclusions on the same issue, it creates a &quot;circuit split&quot;. The Supreme Court receives thousands of petitions each year, but only agrees to hear fewer than 100 of these cases. One of the most compelling reasons for the Supreme Court to accept a case is to resolve a circuit split. Currently, a circuit split exists in &quot;coram nobis&quot; cases involving the definition of &quot;adverse consequences&quot;. The Supreme Court determined in &quot;United States v. Morgan&quot; that a petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; must demonstrate that adverse consequences exist from the criminal conviction. Some courts of appeals determined adverse consequences occur with any collateral consequence of a conviction while other courts of appeals have limited &quot;adverse consequences&quot; to only a few collateral consequences of a conviction.

====Federal district court decisions====
District courts must abide by congressional statutes, Supreme Court decisions, and decisions of the court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located. Whenever a district court hears an issue that is not specifically addressed by statute or by case law of a higher court, district courts often &quot;develop the record&quot;. In case of an appeal, the higher courts have the district court&#x27;s reasoned decision as guidance. A developed record not only greatly facilitates the process of appellate review but also ensures that the district court has carefully considered the issues and applied the applicable law.

===Criteria for the writ===
====Rules for petitioners====
Writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot; are rare in U.S. federal courts due to the stringent criteria for issuance of the writ. &quot;Morgan&quot; established the following criteria required in a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition in order for a federal court to issue the writ:
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is a collateral attack on a judgment in a federal criminal case. A &quot;collateral attack&quot; is defined as an attack on a judgment in a proceeding other than a direct appeal. Fourth Appellate, Orange County Ca, Division 3. Ronald Regan Federal Building, pending accurate information to file petition to overturn conviction in which completed reports from law enforcement were not presented prior to sentencing. discovery report was available prior to retaining private counsel. Prejudice was a factor, lack of training and knowledge. Reg E included adversely with no Forensics, poor delegation, am inaccurate deflection of character. Eighth Amendment violation, Human Trafficked through Mental Court, in custody 1 year. 
*Breach of Contract Future proceedings, Airbag allegations. 
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in a federal court must seek to vacate a federal criminal conviction. A writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is not available in federal courts to challenge a conviction in a state court. The federal government operates its own &quot;coram nobis&quot; procedures independent from state courts. Those seeking to attack a state judgment must follow the post-conviction remedies offered by that state. A writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is also not available for civil cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) specifically abolished the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in civil cases.
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody. A person who is on probation is considered &quot;in custody&quot;. Anyone filing a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition while in custody will have their petition either denied for lack of jurisdiction or categorized as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (or successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255 if the petitioner has previously filed a § 2255 petition).
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; must be addressed to the sentencing court. To challenge a conviction, the petitioner must send a request for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to the court clerk of the district court where the petitioner&#x27;s conviction originated. In other words, a petitioner must request for the writ in the sentencing court, rather than any convenient federal court.
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; must provide valid reasons for not attacking the conviction earlier. Petitioners need to show &quot;reasonable diligence&quot;, where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels (such as a § 2255 petition while in custody). A delay may be considered reasonable when the applicable law was recently changed and made retroactive, when new evidence was discovered that the petitioner could not reasonably have located earlier, or when the petitioner was improperly advised by counsel not to pursue habeas relief.
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; must raise new issues of law or fact that could not have been raised while the petitioner was in custody. In &quot;Morgan&quot;, the Court announced the writ was available where no other remedy is available. However, petitioners occasionally misinterpret this statement as an opportunity to re-raise arguments from previous post-conviction petitions. Appellate courts have consistently determined that the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; cannot be used as a &quot;second chance&quot; to challenge a conviction using the same grounds raised in a previous challenge.
*Petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion and it was denied while in custody must obtain authorization from the district court in order to file a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition. Currently, this rule only applies to those in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2018, the Eighth Circuit became the first appellate court to decide whether a petition for writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (&quot;AEDPA&quot;) restrictions on successive relief as defined in § 2255(h)(1) and (2). The Eighth Circuit held that &quot;coram nobis&quot; petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion, while in custody and the motion was denied while the petitioner remained in custody, is restricted by AEDPA from filing a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition without first obtaining authorization from the district court to file the &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition. This requirement is different from those in custody who are required to obtain authorization from the &quot;appellate court&quot; in order to file a successive § 2255 motion. Other federal appellate courts have yet to issue an opinion on this question.
*A petition for a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; must provide adverse consequences which exist from the conviction. A circuit split exists on this requirement. The First, Second, Third, Fifth, Seventh, Eighth, and Tenth circuit courts administer a &quot;civil disabilities test&quot; which requires a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petitioner to prove that his conviction produced ongoing collateral consequences; however, the Fourth, Ninth and Eleventh Circuits have held that the petitioner need not show that he is suffering from an ongoing &quot;civil disability&quot; because &quot;collateral consequences flow from any criminal conviction&quot;. The Sixth circuit has granted &quot;coram nobis&quot; relief without mentioning this requirement.
*The writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is an extraordinary remedy to correct errors of the most fundamental character. The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid. Typically, the same errors that are deemed grounds for Section 2255 habeas relief also justify &quot;coram nobis&quot; relief. For those claiming actual innocence, a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurs where a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of one who is actually innocent.

====Procedural rules in federal district courts====
*District court clerks should file petitions for writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot; under the original case number In &quot;Morgan&quot;, the Supreme Court provided that the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is a step in the criminal case and not the beginning of a separate civil proceeding. As a result, district courts, such as those in the Ninth Circuit, file petitions for writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot; under the original criminal case number.
*District courts should construe incorrectly titled petitions with the appropriate title. Whenever a federal district court receives an incorrectly labeled or incorrectly titled petition, the court should construe the petition correctly. District courts should construe a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition from a federal prisoner as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Similarly, district courts should construe a habeas corpus petition from a former federal prisoner as a petition for writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot;. Federal courts have determined that a person on probation is still a federal prisoner; therefore, petitioners in this category must file a petition for writ of habeas corpus. A federal prisoner convicted of more than one federal crime may file a petition for writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; to challenge any conviction where the sentence is complete; but the prisoner must file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge any conviction where the sentence is not complete.

====Procedural rules in federal appellate courts====
*Appeals from &quot;coram nobis&quot; orders are subject to a 60-day filing period. Until 2002, two provisions in &quot;Morgan&quot; divided the federal appellate courts interpretation on the time limits to file an appeal from a district court&#x27;s decision on a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition. First, &quot;Morgan&quot; held that &quot;the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is a step in the criminal case&quot;. Second, &quot;Morgan&quot; held that &quot;the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is of the same general character as the writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;&quot;. This created a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding the time limits that applied to appeals from &quot;coram nobis&quot; orders. In 2002, Congress added language to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that clarified an application for a writ of error &quot;coram nobis&quot; is subject to a 60-day filing period.
*Appeals from &quot;coram nobis&quot; orders do not require a certificate of appealability. In 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (&quot;AEDPA&quot;) which included language that limits the power of federal judges to grant motions for habeas relief, including motions for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. AEDPA requires a Certificate of Appealability in order to appeal a district court&#x27;s ruling on a habeas corpus petition. Unlike the writ of habeas corpus, a Certificate of Appealability is not required in order to appeal a district court&#x27;s ruling on a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition. Neither the 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) statute making the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; available in federal courts in criminal matters nor any Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure requires a certificate of appealability before an appeal may be taken, nor does such a requirement appear in the case law. Some prisoners have attempted to file &quot;coram nobis&quot; petitions if AEDPA prevents the petitioner from filing under § 2255. However, federal courts have consistently held that prisoners may not resort to the writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; in order to bypass AEDPA&#x27;s gatekeeping requirements.
*The standard of review from a district court&#x27;s denial of a &quot;coram nobis&quot; petition is similar to the standard of review from a district court&#x27;s denial of a habeas corpus petition. Generally, the standard of review is that any district court&#x27;s determinations on questions of law are reviewed de novo, but that district court&#x27;s determinations on questions of fact are reviewed for clear error (or clearly erroneous error). Under de novo review of federal &quot;coram nobis&quot; cases, the appellate court acts as if it were considering the question of law for the first time, affording no deference to the decision of the district court. Under Clear Error review of federal &quot;coram nobis&quot; cases, the appellate court must have a &quot;definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed&quot; by the district court.

==U.S. state courts==

Only sixteen state courts and District of Columbia courts recognize the availability of writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot; or &quot;coram vobis&quot;. Each state is free to operate its own &quot;coram nobis&quot; procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. The writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; is not available in a majority of states because those states have enacted uniform post-conviction acts that provide a streamlined, single remedy for obtaining relief from a judgment of conviction, and that remedy is available to petitioners who are no longer in custody. States that have replaced writs of &quot;coram nobis&quot; with remedies within their post-conviction proceedings are also independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. These proceedings enacted by state legislatures may either be more or less stringent than the writs it replaced or the post-conviction proceedings of other states.

===Availability===

==Notable cases==

===Gordon Hirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu===
Gordon Hirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu are best known for their principled resistance to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. All three had their convictions overturned through writs of coram nobis, and they were each awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

After the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s administration concluded that Japanese Americans living in the West Coast were a security threat, even though the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Naval Intelligence had argued the opposite, and thus authorized the military to secure areas from which &quot;any or all persons may be excluded&quot;. As a result, Japanese Americans were subject to curfew and other restrictions before being forced into internment camps. Hirabayashi, Yasui, and Korematsu, who were not acquainted with each other at the time, each defied the internment and were convicted for their resistance. Their convictions would be affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court between 1943 and 1944. Four decades after the Court&#x27;s rulings, lawyers, including civil rights attorney, Peter Irons, re-opened their wartime convictions on the basis of newly discovered evidence of governmental misconduct. The new evidence indicated the government intentionally withheld &quot;The Ringle Report&quot;, a report drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which would have undermined the administration&#x27;s position of the military actions, as it finally concluded that most Japanese Americans did not pose a national security threat during WWII.

Gordon Hirabayashi was born in April 1918 in Seattle, Washington. He was a senior student at the University of Washington at the time when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to internment camps. Although he first considered accepting internment, he ultimately defied it. In May 1942, Hirabayashi turned himself in to the FBI. After being convicted in October 1942 for the curfew violation, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison. He also served a one-year sentence at McNeil Island Penitentiary for Selective Service violations when he refused to answer questions which singled out Japanese Americans on the basis of race alone. He appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in &quot;Hirabayashi v. United States&quot;. In 1987, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a writ of coram nobis which effectively overturned his criminal conviction. Hirabayashi died in January 2012, and he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in May 2012.

Minoru Yasui was born in 1916 in Hood River, Oregon. He attended law school at the University of Oregon and became the first Japanese American lawyer in Oregon in 1939. Upon the declaration of war, Yasui attempted to report for military duty, but his services were refused nine times. After hearing the news of internment, Yasui planned his legal challenge to the government&#x27;s policies. In March 1942, he deliberately disobeyed the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew&#x27;s constitutionality. He was convicted in November 1942. Yasui appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in &quot;Yasui v. United States&quot;. In January 1984, his conviction was overturned when the U.S. District Court in Oregon granted his writ of coram nobis. Yasui died in 1986, and he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2015.

Fred Korematsu was born in 1919 in Oakland, California. He attempted to enlist with the United States Navy when called for military duty under the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, but he was rejected due to stomach ulcers. In March 1942, when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to assembly centers, he refused and went into hiding in the Oakland area. He was arrested in May 1942, and held at the Presidio of San Francisco military detention center until his conviction in September 1942. The U.S. Supreme Court in December 1944 upheld his conviction in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;. In November 1983, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco formally granted the writ of coram nobis and vacated his conviction. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1998, and died in March 2005.

===George Stinney===

In December 2014, a writ of &quot;coram nobis&quot; was granted by a South Carolina state court to posthumously vacate the conviction of George Stinney, a 14-year-old black boy who was convicted of murder and executed in June 1944. Stinney was convicted in 1944 in a one-day trial of the first-degree murder of two white girls: 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 8-year-old Mary Emma Thames. After being arrested, Stinney was said to have confessed to the crime; however, there was no written record of his confession apart from notes provided by an investigating deputy, and no transcript of the brief trial. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed as a result of the conviction. On December 17, 2014, Stinney&#x27;s conviction was posthumously vacated 70 years after his execution, because the judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and therefore his Sixth Amendment rights had been violated.

==United Kingdom==
The common law writ of error &quot;contra nobis&quot; and its equitable equivalent, the supplemental bill of review, do not appear to have survived the reforms to English law made in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Writs of error as a separate proceeding were abolished by section 148 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict., c.76), which instead provided that &quot;the Proceeding to Error Shall be a Step in the Cause&quot;. Error was finally abolished 23 years later in 1875, when Schedule I, Order 58, rule 1 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 was brought into force and the Court of Appeal was created.

===Fresh evidence===
The modern practice at English law where a litigant seeks to rely upon evidence not known at trial is to bring an appeal.

In civil proceedings, CPR 52.11(1)(b) contains a presumption that civil appeals shall be limited to a review of a decision of the lower court, and CPR 52.11(2)(b) contains a presumption that the Court of Appeal shall not receive fresh evidence. The Court of Appeal will exercise its discretion to hear fresh evidence according to the over-riding objective in civil cases to deal with cases justly: however, three key criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal in &quot;Ladd v Marshall&quot; continue to be of relevance:

*the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
*the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive;
*the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed; it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.

Moreover, where it is &quot;necessary to do so in order to avoid real injustice&quot;, in &quot;exceptional&quot; circumstances, and where &quot;there is no alternative effective remedy&quot;, CPR 52.17(1) permits both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to re-open a final determination of an appeal.

In criminal proceedings, the Court of Appeal also has a discretion to admit fresh evidence on appeal. If it does so, the Court must ask itself whether, in light of the fresh evidence, the conviction is unsafe.

===Special case of fraud===
Soon after the passage of the Judicature Acts, it was thought that, when a judgment had been obtained by wilful fraud of the victorious party, the aggrieved party&#x27;s proper recourse was to bring a new action for fraud, because to try the alleged fraud required original jurisdiction, which the Court of Appeal did not have.

In so ruling, Jessell MR made specific references to the supplemental bill of review, the equitable equivalent of the writ of error &quot;contra nobis.&quot; However, the Court drew an analogy with the old law, rather than preserving it: in agreeing with Jessell MR, James LJ observed, &quot;if it is true that there was a fraud practised upon the Court, by which the Court was induced to make a wrong decree, the way to obtain relief will be to bring a &quot;fresh action&quot; to set aside the decree on the ground of fraud&quot; [emphasis added].

Since the coming into force of the Civil Procedure Rules, the law has evolved further. In &quot;Noble v Owens&quot;, the Court of Appeal held that the modern position is that it is now not necessary to commence a fresh action to cure a judgment fraudulently obtained. Instead, the powers of the Court of Appeal under CPR 52.10 are sufficiently broad to permit the Court of Appeal to refer the determination of the issue of fraud to a Judge of the High Court as part of the appeal proceedings, with a consequent saving of costs.

In criminal cases, the Court of Appeal has allowed appeals and quashed convictions on the basis of misconduct by Crown witnesses analogous to fraud, e.g., where prosecution witnesses had subsequently been convicted for giving perjured evidence during the original trial; or where police officers who took confessions from the appellants had subsequently been discredited in later proceedings.

===Recent attempts to resurrect the procedure===
In &quot;Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd&quot;, an unsuccessful attempt was made to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. Jacob LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of fresh evidence had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of review procedure had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed. The judge observed that &quot;it would make for better justice in principle for a prior decision to be impugnable on the grounds for which a bill of review once lay, namely that there was fresh evidence not discoverable by reasonable diligence, which &#x27;entirely changes the aspect of the case (para. [100]). However, he also observed that the Court of Appeal had not been asked to consider its powers under CPR 52.17 to re-open a final appeal in &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; and therefore could not say whether such an application would have succeeded.

Moreover, in a Northern Ireland case, &quot;Walsh&#x27;s Application&quot;, in which an application was made for a writ of error &quot;coram nobis&quot; following an unsuccessful judicial review, Weatherup J followed the Court of Appeal in &quot;Cinpres&quot; by observing, &quot;While the Writ developed at Common Law, I doubt if the procedure survived the appeals process introduced by the Judicature (Ireland) Act 1875&quot;, before referring to the provision of that Act dealing with the abolition of proceedings in error. The court concluded that it did not have the jurisdiction to alter the decision made on judicial review.

The above cases indicate that the Judicature Acts and the Civil Procedure Rules provide for a comprehensive system of appeals which effectively ousts the function served by the former bill of review and writ of error &quot;coram nobis&quot;, which may now be extinct in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<text>Lucien Lévy-Bruhl (10 April 1857 – 13 March 1939) was a French scholar trained in philosophy who furthered anthropology with his contributions to the budding fields of sociology and ethnology. His primary field interest was ways of thinking.

Born in Paris, Lévy-Bruhl wrote about the mind in his work &quot;How Natives Think&quot; (1910), where he posited, as the two basic mindsets of mankind, the &quot;primitive&quot; and the &quot;modern&quot;. The primitive mind does not differentiate the supernatural from reality but uses &quot;mystical participation&quot; to manipulate the world. According to Lévy-Bruhl, the primitive mind does not address contradictions. The modern mind, by contrast, uses reflection and logic.

Lévy-Bruhl did not necessarily believe in a historical and evolutionary teleology leading from the primitive mind to the modern, but this is often assumed because his work is rarely read in full; rather, his thought is more dynamic, as shown by his later &quot;Notebooks on Primitive Mentality&quot;, where he admits that non-logical thought is common in modern societies, such as in gambling practices. Sociologist Stanislav Andreski argued that despite its flaws, Lévy-Bruhl&#x27;s &quot;How Natives Think&quot; was an accurate and valuable contribution to anthropology, perhaps even more so than better-known work by Claude Lévi-Strauss.

Lévy-Bruhl&#x27;s work, especially the concepts of &quot;collective representations&quot; and &quot;participation mystique&quot;, influenced the psychological theory of Carl Jung.

His thought also plays a large part in the work of Norman O. Brown.

<text>General elections were held in Denmark on 12 December 1990. Although the election resulted in a strong gain for the Social Democratic Party, Poul Schlüter&#x27;s coalition government was able to continue despite the Danish Social Liberal Party leaving. Schlüter&#x27;s coalition consisted of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and Venstre. Voter turnout was 83% in Denmark proper, 54% in the Faroe Islands and 51% in Greenland.

<text>Gossa (dative: Gossen) is an island in Aukra Municipality in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. The island encompasses most of the municipality and has a ferry connection from the village of Aukrasanden across the Julsundet strait to the village of Hollingen on the mainland. About 80% of the municipal population (about 2,500 people) is located on the island. 
The island is flat and swampy, but it is well cultivated by farmland wherever possible. There are also some planted forests. The highest point on the island is the tall &quot;Jærmannburet&quot;. 

The largest population centers on the island are the villages of Aukrasanden and Varhaugvika on the southeastern side and the village of Røssøyvågen on the west side. Aukra Auto runs bus service on the island. 

The natural gas from the Ormen Lange gas field is brought ashore at Nyhamna on the northeastern shore of the island. Here the gas is processed and pumped through the world&#x27;s longest underwater pipeline, the Langeled pipeline, to Easington in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="1043804" wikidata="Q4958928" url="?curid=1043804" title="Brazilianist">
<text>Brazilianist (brasilianista, in Brazilian Portuguese) is a scholar, either a non-Brazilian or a Brazilian living abroad, who teaches, conducts research, and publishes about Brazil. Common fields and disciplines are history, anthropology, sociology, political science, geography, literature, and music. There is great diversity of interests amongst Brazilianists.

== Origins and use of the term ==

The term &quot;Brazilianist&quot; supposedly originated in Brazil in the 1960s or perhaps a little earlier; it was coined to designate scholars from the United States who were receiving grants to study Brazil at the time when the U.S. had special political interests in that country. However, that is a view perhaps a little too narrow as to the motivating factors which led these many social scientists to do research on Brazilian issues.

In the 1970s and well into the 1980s the Brazilian press paid considerable attention to Brazilianists themselves but there was not much discussion of their arguments and findings. At that time the term &quot;Brazilianist&quot; could even have something of a pejorative tone.

Since the 1990s there has been a greater acknowledgment in Brazil of the body of work produced by Brazilianist scholars. Brazilianists&#x27; studies began to be more actively introduced into curricula at major Brazilian universities.. A major bi-national conference in Washington D.C. led to the book &quot;Envisioning Brazil&quot;: 
&quot;A Guide to Brazilian Studies in the United States. &quot;University of Wisconsin Press, 2005&quot;. &quot;Edited by Marshall C. Eakin and Paulo Roberto de Almeida. The book was translated as &quot;O Brasil dos Brasilianistas: um guia dos estudos sobre o Brasil nos Estados Unidos, 1945-2000&quot;.

Today some of the books produced by Brazilianists are known well beyond academic circles in Brazil.

Brazilian and Portuguese dictionaries define a “Brazilianist” as a scholar, most usually a non-Brazilian, dedicated to Brazilian studies.

== List of notable Brazilianists ==

The following is a partial list of people who have studied Brazil in a multi-disciplinary fashion and can be considered Brazilianists.

<text>Snap freezing (or cook-chill or blast freezing) is the process of rapid cooling of a substance for the purpose of preservation. It is widely used in the culinary and scientific industries.

==Scientific use==
Snap-freeze is a term often used in scientific papers to describe a process by which a sample is very quickly lowered to temperatures below -70 °C. This is often accomplished by submerging a sample in liquid nitrogen. This prevents water from crystallising when it forms ice, and so better preserves the structure of the sample (e.g. RNA, protein, or live cells).

<doc id="1043828" wikidata="Q1807035" url="?curid=1043828" title="Waitākere Ranges">
<text>The Waitākere Ranges is a mountain range in New Zealand. Located in West Auckland between metropolitan Auckland and the Tasman Sea, the ranges and its foothills and coasts comprise some of public and private land. The area, traditionally known to Māori as &quot;Te Wao Nui o Tiriwa&quot; (The Great Forest of Tiriwa), is of local, regional, and national significance. The Waitākere Ranges includes a chain of hills in the Auckland Region, generally running approximately from north to south, 25 km west of central Auckland. The ranges are part of the Waitākere Ranges Regional Park.

From 1 May 2018 the forested areas of the Waitākere Ranges Regional Park were closed, with some exceptions, while Auckland Council upgraded the tracks to dry foot standard protect the roots and to prevent the spread of kauri dieback, bacteria that affect kauri trees and prevents them from getting nutrients, effectively killing them. There is no cure. But 

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Wai-tākere&quot; originally came from a rock located in Waitākere Bay near Te Henga (Bethells Beach). In Māori the name Te Wao Nui a Tiriwa (&quot;The Great Forest of Tiriwa&quot;), referred to all of the forested areas south from Muriwai and the Kaipara Harbour portage to the Manukau Harbour, while the name Hikurangi referred to the central and Western Waitākere Ranges, south of the Waitākere River.

==Geology==

The rugged upstanding topography is formed from erosion-resistant ancient volcanic conglomerate and lava flows laid down in eruptions from the large Waitākere volcano to the west 12–25 million years ago. The Waitākere Ranges and land south from Muriwai are the eastern slopes of the volcano, which were uplifted from the sea floor between 3 and 5 million years ago. Much of the rock that forms the ranges, such as the Piha Formation and Nihotupu Formation, are volcanic and marine conglomerate rocks. Many of the features of the ranges, such as Karekare, Te Toka-Tapu-a-Kupe / Ninepin Rock and Pukematekeo, are remnants of volcanic vents and plugs.

==Geography==

The western coastline of the ranges consists of cliffs exceeding , interspersed infrequently with beaches. The ranges are covered in native forest, most of which is in the process of regeneration since extensive logging and farming in the mid–late 19th and early 20th centuries. The highest point in the Waitākere Ranges, at , is Te Toiokawharu, in the southern part of the ranges, about north-east of Huia. The Scenic Drive follows a ridge of high points along the eastern ranges, connecting the communities of Titirangi, Waiatarua and Swanson. Along this ridge are some of the more notable peaks of the ranges, including Ruaotuwhenua, known for its radome and adjacent television mast, and Pukematekeo, the northernmost of the ranges which looks out over metropolitan Auckland.

==Biodiversity==

In the Holocene prior to human settlement, the Waitākere Ranges was a densely forested podocarp-broadleaf forest, dominated by kauri, northern rātā and rimu. The ranges are home to one endemic species, &quot;Veronica bishopiana&quot;, the Waitākere rock koromiko, and additionally some species which are rare outside of coastal West Auckland, including &quot;Sophora fulvida&quot;, the west coast kōwhai and &quot;Veronica obtusata&quot;, the coastal hebe. The Waitākere Ranges are known for the wide variety of fern species (over 110), as well as native orchids, many of which self-established from seeds carried by winds from the east coast of Australia.

The Waitākere Ranges are home to many native species of bird, the New Zealand long-tailed bat and Hochstetter&#x27;s frog, which have been impacted by introduced predatory species including rodents, stoats, weasels, possums and cats. At the northern end of the ranges, Otakamiro Point is the site of one of New Zealand&#x27;s few mainland gannet breeding colonies. In the bush are many indigenous invertebrates, including kauri snail, wētā and oviparous velvet worms with 14 pairs of legs, and ovoviviparous species of 15 and 16 pairs of legs in the genus &quot;Peripatoides&quot;.

== History ==
=== Māori history ===
A number of Tāmaki Māori are associated with the early settlement of the Waitākere Ranges. In the creation legend of the Auckland volcanic field, the Waitākere Ranges was home to a tribe of supernatural beings known as Tahurangi (called patupaiarehe in other traditions), who battled with the patupaiarehe of the Hunua Ranges. The Māori language name of the Waitākere Ranges, Te Wao Nui a Tiriwa, refers to Tiriwa, a chief of the Tūrehu patupaiarehe. The coastline of the ranges and the Manukau Harbour is traditionally thought to be guarded by the taniwha Paikea, while the Waitākere River and northern ranges were the home to Te Mokoroa, a malevolent taniwha. The ranges were visited by Rakatāura, the senior tohunga (priest/navigator) of the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe, who named many of the locations along the west coast.

The area is within the traditional rohe of the iwi Te Kawerau ā Maki, whose most intensive settlements were traditionally around the Waitākere River and Te Henga / Bethells Beach being major focal points for settlement. Much of the coastline and river valleys were settled due to the resource-rich forests and coastline, with over 550 recorded archaeological sites recorded in the area.

The warm, sheltered valleys of the west coast streams were well suited for growing crops such as kūmara, taro, hue (calabash) and aruhe (bracken fern), and were the cause of many early wars in the area. Te Kawerau ā Maki benefited from the abundant seafood found on the coast, as well as resources found deeper within the Waitākere Ranges, such as moa, seasonal berries, eels, crayfish and other birds. Over 50 pā were located around the Waitākere Ranges, and many caves and rock shelters were used as refuges during times of war between the 16th and 18th centuries, including Lion Rock at Piha, which was the location of Whakaari pā, and the caves in Whatipu. The Waitākere Ranges sites have a large number of wood and fibre artefacts due to the weather conditions of the area. Surveys in the early 1900s uncovered traditional textile fragments such as fishing nets, baskets, cloak fragments, from locations such as Anawhata, Piha, Takatu Point, Karekare and Whatipu. In 1853 and 1854, the New Zealand government acquired around 100,000 acres of Te Kawerau ā Maki land, purchased from other iwi without consultation of Te Kawerau ā Maki. Reserves were created at Piha and Te Henga (Bethells Beach), however by the 1950s almost all Te Kawerau ā Maki land in the Waitākere Ranges had been partitioned and sold.

=== Kauri logging industry ===
In the 18th century, significant areas of the Waitākere Ranges were forested with kauri. Tāmaki Māori tribes had traditionally felled kauri wood to construct waka, and early European visitors in the 1790s likely began harvesting young kauri trees for sailing ship spars. During the early colonial era, the Waitākere Ranges were a major source for kauri wood. Kauri trees near the Manukau Harbour were first felled in the 1830s. Between 1840 and 1940, 23 timber mills worked the Waitākere Ranges. Approximately 70 dams were constructed along the waterways of the Waitākere Ranges, which loggers would break in order for kauri to be sent downstream with the flood of water.

A major sawmill was constructed at Whatipu, and in the latter 19th century a wharf was constructed on the north-east side of Paratutae Island for the industry. A tramway was constructed along the west coast gradually between the 1870s and 1914 linking to the sawmill and wharf, eventually being extended as far as Anawhata. The wharf was used until 1921, and was demolished in 1950.

The 1920s signalled the end of the kauri logging industry, as there was little kauri forest left in the Waitākeres. An estimated 120,000 trees were felled by the kauri logging industry, many of which were damaged and unable to be turned into timber, due inefficient logging techniques.

===Water reservoirs===
By the late 19th century, Auckland was plagued with seasonal droughts. A number of options were considered to counter this, including the construction of water reservoirs in the Waitākere Ranges. The first of these projects was the Waitākere Dam in the north-eastern Waitākere Ranges, which was completed in 1910. The Waitākere Dam was constructed overtop of the Waitākere Falls, which was a major tourist attraction in Auckland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The construction of the Waitākere Dam permanently reduced the flow of the Waitākere River, greatly impacting the Te Kawerau ā Maki community at Te Henga / Bethells Beach. Between the 1910s and 1950s, most members of Te Kawerau ā Maki moved away from their traditional rohe, in search of employment or community with other Māori.

Further reservoirs were constructed along the different river catchments in the Waitākere Ranges: the Upper Nihotupu Reservoir in 1923; the Huia Reservoir in 1929; and the Lower Nihotupu Reservoir in 1948.

The five reservoirs continue to operate today, supplying water. Combined, the reservoirs supply approximately 26% of Auckland&#x27;s potable water demand. The ranges receive an average of over 2,000 mm (78.75 inches) of rainfall annually while the corresponding rate in the city is less than half that. As weather systems approach across the Tasman Sea, their path is blocked by the ranges causing a small uplift sufficient to trigger orographic rainfall.

=== Regional Park ===

By the late 19th century, the Waitākere Ranges area became popular for sightseers, notably the Waitākere Falls and the Gap at Piha. In 1894 a group led by Sir Algernon Thomas (the first professor of natural sciences at Auckland University College, now the University of Auckland) persuaded the Auckland City Council to preserve 3,500 acres (14 km2) in the Nihotupu area of the ranges as a bush reserve. In 1895 the national Government vested the land, and several other smaller areas of the ranges, in the City Council as &quot;reserves for the conservation of native flora and fauna&quot;.

After the construction of the dams in the 1920s, the Nihotupu and Huia areas reforested in native bush. This forest left a strong impression on residents who lived in these communities, and was one of the major factors that sparked the campaign for the Waitākere Ranges to become a nature reserve. The Auckland Centennial Memorial Park opened in 1940, commemorating 100 years since the establishment of Auckland. It was formed from various pockets of land that had been reserved by the Auckland City Council starting in 1895. Titirangi resident Arthur Mead, the principal engineer who created the Waitākere Ranges dams, lobbied the city council and negotiated with landowners to expand the park. Owing to the efforts of Mead, the park had tripled in size by 1964, when it became the Waitākere Ranges Regional Park. By 1992, the area had reached a size of , and was formally consolidated into a single regional park. By this point, the park had become one of the regional parks in New Zealand, alongside the Hunua Ranges.

=== Conservation and kauri dieback ===

Ark in the Park is a collaborative project between Forest and Bird and the Auckland Council. First established in 2002 by volunteers, the project began with a gated area of within the Waitākere Ranges Regional Park that was regularly trapped by volunteers. By 2019, this area had grown to , and led to reintroductions of New Zealand bird species, including the whitehead (), North Island robin () and North Island kōkako; the latter having last been seen in the ranges in the 1950s. In 2008, the &quot;Waitākere Ranges Heritage Area Act&quot; was produced, as formal legislation to ensure the protection of the park. The Waitākere Ranges Regional Park covers about 60% of the area protected by the &quot;Waitākere Ranges Heritage Area Act&quot; of 2008. The act protects approximately 27,700 ha of both public (the Waitākere Ranges Regional Park) and privately owned land.

In March 2006, entomologist Peter Maddison noticed many mature kauri in the Waitākere Ranges had been infected with a distinct oomycete disease. After the disease had begun to increasingly impact kauri in the ranges, Te Kawerau ā Maki announced a rāhui in 2017, asking for members of the public to not enter the ranges as a measure to protect the trees against kauri dieback. This was followed by a formal vote by Auckland Council to restrict access to the Waitākere Ranges a year later.

Tracks in the ranges have slowly begun to be reopened, after extensive work on tracks to incorporate boardwalks and gravel as protective measures for kauri.

== Attractions==

Some of the ranges&#x27; main attractions are: the four popular surf beaches, Piha, Muriwai, Te Henga (Bethells Beach), Karekare; an extensive network of bush walks and tracks; and panoramic views of the east and west coasts and the city. A road, aptly named Scenic Drive, runs a good portion of the length of the ranges from Titirangi to Swanson. Auckland City Council operates an information centre on Scenic Drive, called Arataki Visitor Centre.

The beaches are typical of west coast beaches north of Taranaki in that they are all black sand beaches. They have a reputation of being dangerous for swimmers due to rips and large swells. Surf Life Saving Clubs patrol designated areas of the four most popular beaches during the summer months. Piha Surf Life Saving Club is the oldest of these, being founded in 1934.

On 11 January 2010, the Auckland Regional Council opened the Hillary Trail, a 77 km trail running roughly south–north from the Arataki Visitor Centre to Muriwai through the Waitākere Ranges, named in honour of the New Zealand mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary. The Hilary Trail is regarded as one of or maybe the best multi day hike in the north of the country.

<text>Levée en masse ( or, in English, &quot;mass levy&quot;) is a French term used for a policy of mass national conscription, often in the face of invasion.

The concept originated during the French Revolutionary Wars, particularly for the period following 16 August 1793, when able-bodied men aged 18 to 25 were conscripted. The concept of mass conscription was kept in place during the Napoleonic Wars.

The term is also applied to other historical examples of mass conscription.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;levée en masse&quot; denotes a short-term requisition of all able-bodied men to defend the nation and its rise as a military tactic may be viewed in connection with the political events and developing ideology in revolutionary France—particularly the new concept of the democratic citizen as opposed to a royal subject.

Central to the understanding that developed (and was promoted by the authorities) of the &quot;levée&quot; is the idea that the new political rights given to the mass of the French people also created new obligations to the state. As the nation now understood itself as a community of &quot;all&quot; people, its defense also was assumed to become a responsibility of &quot;all&quot;. Thus, the &quot;levée en masse&quot; was created and understood as a means to defend the nation by the nation.

Historically, the &quot;levée en masse&quot; heralded the age of national participation in warfare and displaced restricted forms of warfare, such as the cabinet wars (1715–1792), when armies of professional soldiers fought without the general participation of the population.

==French Revolutionary Wars==
The first modern use of &quot;levée en masse&quot; occurred during the French Revolutionary Wars. Under the Ancien Régime, there had been some conscription (by ballot) to a militia, &quot;milice&quot;, to supplement the large standing army in times of war. This was unpopular with the peasant communities on which it fell, and was one of their grievances which they expected to be addressed by the French Estates General when it was convened in 1789, to strengthen the French monarchy. When this instead led to the French Revolution, the &quot;milice&quot; was duly abolished by the National Assembly.

===Pre-war through early war days===
As early as 1789, leaders had considered how they would sustain their revolutionary army. In December, Dubois de Crancé, who was both &quot;a man of the left&quot; and &quot;a military man, having served as a King&#x27;s Musketeer&quot;, spoke to the National Assembly on behalf of its military committee. He called for &quot;a people&#x27;s army, recruited by universal conscription, from which there could be no escape by purchase of a replacement&quot;. He said to the National Convention: &quot;And so I say that in a nation which seeks to be free but which is surrounded by powerful neighbours and riddled with secret, festering factions, every citizen should be a soldier and every soldier should be a citizen, if France does not wish to be utterly obliterated&quot;. Yet the Committee was not ready to enact conscription, and would not until dire war deficits demanded more men.

The progression of the Revolution came to produce friction between France and its European neighbors, who grew determined to invade France to restore the monarchy. War with Prussia and Austria began in April 1792. Decrees such as that of 19 November 1792 reflect the fact that &quot;the deputies were in no mood for caution&quot;. The convention&#x27;s decree stated that: &quot;The National Convention declares, in the name of the French nation, that it will grant fraternity and assistance to all peoples who wish to recover their liberty, and instructs the Executive Power to give the necessary orders to generals to grant assistance to these peoples and to defend those citizens who have been—or may be—persecuted for their attachment to the cause of liberty. The National Convention further decrees that the Executive Power shall order the generals to have this decree printed and distributed in all the various languages and in all the various countries of which they have taken possession&quot;. Their decree signalled to foreign powers, namely Britain, that France was out for conquest, not just political reformation of its own lands.

The French army at that time contained a mixture of what was left of the old professional army and volunteers. This ragtag group was spread thin, and, by February 1793, the new regime needed more men, so the National Convention passed a decree on 24 February allowing for the national levy of about 300,000 with each French département to supply a quota of recruits. By March 1793, France was at war with Austria, Prussia, Spain, Britain, Piedmont, and the United Provinces. The introduction of recruitment for the levy in the Vendée, a politically and religiously conservative region, added to local discontent over other revolutionary directives emanating from Paris, and on 11 March the Vendée erupted into civil war—just days after France declared war on Spain and adding further strains on the French armies&#x27; limited manpower. By some accounts, only about half this number appears to have been actually raised, bringing the army strength up to about 645,000 in mid-1793, and the military situation continued to deteriorate, particularly when Mainz fell on 23 July 1793.

In response to this desperate situation, at war with European states, and insurrection, Paris petitioners and the fédérés demanded that the Convention enact a levée en masse. In response, Convention member Bertrand Barère asked the convention to &quot;decree the solemn declaration that the French people was going to rise as a whole for the defense of its independence&quot;. The Convention fulfilled Barere&#x27;s request on 16 August, when they stated that the levée en masse would be enacted.

===Levée en masse decreed===

The decree was enacted by the National Convention on 23 August 1793, having been penned by Barère in conjunction with Lazare Carnot. The decree read in ringing terms, beginning: &quot;From this moment until such time as its enemies shall have been driven from the soil of the Republic, all Frenchmen are in permanent requisition for the services of the armies. The young men shall fight; the married men shall forge arms and transport provisions; the women shall make tents and clothes and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the old men shall betake themselves to the public squares in order to arouse the courage of the warriors and preach hatred of kings and the unity of the Republic.&quot;

All unmarried able-bodied men between 18 and 25 were requisitioned with immediate effect for military service. This significantly increased the number of men in the army, which reached a peak of about 1,500,000 in September 1794, although the actual fighting strength probably peaked at no more than 800,000. In addition, as the decree suggests, much of the civilian population was turned towards supporting the armies through armaments production and other war industries as well as supplying food and provisions to the front. As Barère put it, &quot;…all the French, both sexes, all ages are called by the nation to defend liberty&quot;.

==Text of the French Revolution&#x27;s &quot;levée en masse&quot; ==
Translated and summarized Levée en Masse
# Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the republic, the French people are in permanent requisition for army service. The young men shall go to battle; the married men shall forge arms and transport provision; the women shall make tents and clothes, and shall serve in the hospitals; the children shall turn old linen into lint; the old men shall repair to the public places, to stimulate the courage of the warriors and preach the unity of the Republic and hatred of kings
# National buildings shall be converted into barracks; public places into armament workshops; the soil of cellars shall be washed in lye to extract saltpeter therefrom.
# Arms of the caliber shall be turned over exclusively to those who march against the enemy; the service of the interior shall be carried on with fowling pieces and sabers.
# Saddle horses are called for to complete the cavalry corps; draught horses, other than those employed in agriculture, shall haul artillery and provisions
# The Committee of Public Safety is charged for taking all measures necessary for establishing, without delay, a special manufacture of arms of all kinds, in harmony with the élan and the energy of the French people. Accordingly, it is authorized to constitute all establishments, manufactories, workshops, and factories deemed necessary for the execution of such works, as well as the requisition for such purpose, throughout the entire extent of the Republic, the artists and workmen who may contribute to their success. For such purpose a sum of 30,000,000 taken from the 498,200,000 livres in assignats in reserve in the “Fund of the Three Keys,” shall be placed at the disposal of the Minister of War (Carnot). The central establishment of said special manufacture shall be established at Paris.
# The representatives of the people dispatched for the execution of the present law shall have similar authority in their respective arrondissements, acting in concert with the Committee of Public Safety; they are invested with the ultimate powers attributed to the representatives of the people with armies.
# No one may obtain a substitute for service to which he is summoned. The public functionaries shall remain at their posts.
# The levy shall be general. Unmarried citizens or childless widowers, from eighteen to twenty-five years, shall go first; they shall meet, without delay, at the chief town of their districts, where they shall practice manual exercise daily, while awaiting the hour of departure.
# The representatives of the people shall regulate the musters and marches so as to have armed citizens arrive at the points of assembling only in so far as supplies, munitions, and all that constitutes the material part of the army exist in sufficient proportion.
# The points of assembling shall be determined by circumstances, and designated by the representatives of the people dispatched for the execution of the present decree, upon the advice of the generals, in co-operation with the Committee of Public Safety and the provisional Executive Council.
# The battalion organized in each district shall be united under a banner bearing the inscription: The French people risen against tyrants.
# Such battalions shall be organized according to established decrees, and their pay shall be the same as that of the battalions at the frontiers.
# In order to collect supplies in sufficient quantity, the farmers and managers of national property shall deposit the produce of such property, in the form of grain, in the chief town of their respective districts.
# Owners, farmers, and others possessing grain shall be required to pay, in kind, arrears of taxes, even the two-thirds of those of 1793, on the rolls which have served to effect the last payment.
# [Articles 15 and 16 name assistants to the Deputies on Mission—among them Chabot and Tallien—and give orders to the envoys of the primary assemblies concerning the mission assigned to them.]
# The Minister of War is responsible for taking all measures necessary for the prompt execution of the present decree; a sum of 50,000,000 from the 498,000,000 livres in assignats on the “Fund of the Three Keys,” shall be placed at his disposal by the National Treasury.
# The present decree shall be conveyed to the departments by special messengers.
==Conscription==
According to historian Howard G. Brown, “The French state’s panicky response to a crisis of its own making soon led to an excessive military build-up. Enemy forces consisted of no more than 81,000 Austrians and Prussians, supported by 6,000 Hessians and a few thousand émigrés. Against these paltry forces France decided to mobilize an army of 450,000 men, larger than any army Europe had ever seen.” Depending on the source, the exact number of those conscripted ranges from 750,000 to around 800,000. However, the values cannot be verified and is a reconstructed estimate because the French Government was in no position to give accurate figures at the time. One source states the official numbers in February 1793, were 361,000 men, in January 1794, were 670,900 men, in April 1794, 842,300, with the maximum reached in September 1794, 1,108,300. “However these figures are worth very little.” The figures “designated all who were on the rolls as being maintained at the expense of the state, including therefore all those disabled by illness, capture or even desertion...The best guess seems to be that about 800,000 were available for active service” in 1794. Other sources give estimates that around 750,000 men were actively serving in the French Army. “The Commission of Armies alone could not identify the armies, let alone its location or strength.” Also, there were many individuals that deserted the army, but the exact number of individuals that deserted is also an estimation based on the number of individuals that were caught or came back to France due to amnesty laws.

When looking at the makeup of the French army overall, the majority of the individuals in the army consisted of the peasant, farming class in contrast to the rich and urban workers who were given special privileges and exemptions. The rich were able to buy remplaçants, replacements, by paying poorer males who needed the money to take their places. Males that had office jobs in the city were also exempted from serving in the French army as well as males that could read and write and who worked in the government. The overall make up of the army was unevenly distributed among the different regions in France. The Levée expected that one male was conscripted for every 138 inhabitants. However, in reality each region did not follow this conscription rule. There were departments that conscribed more individuals like Puy-de-Dôme, the Haute-Loire, and Yonne, located more in central France while other areas that sent less than expected, like Seine, Rhône, and Basses-Pyrénées—all located further from the capital of France, away from the central government troubles.

Many individuals who were conscripted by the French deserted, fleeing from their duty of fighting for France without permission, in hopes of never getting caught. There were rough estimates to the number of individuals that deserted during the time of the Levée en Masse, but due to many factors, like the inability to manage and keep track of all the armies or differentiating between men with similar names, the exact number is unclear. In 1800, the Minister of War (Carnot) reported that there were 175,000 deserters based on the number of individuals that sought the benefits following the amnesty put in place. Similarly to how the proportions of males that were sent varied depending on what region they lived in, the same applied for deserters.

The historian Hargenvillier produced a detailed statistical breakdown of the percentage of desertions that flanked that specific department from 1798 to 1804. In hopes of showing that like the previous levées that were proposed by the French government in an attempt to raise the number of troops, there were different reactions depending on region. There were regions where there was little to no resistance to the levée and no large amount of deserters, while other regions had nearly 60 percent deserters.

==Popular reaction==
For all the rhetoric, the &quot;levée en masse&quot; was not popular; desertion and evasion were high. However, the effort was sufficient to turn the tide of the war, and there was no need for any further conscription until 1797, when a more permanent system of annual intakes was instituted. An effect of the &quot;levée en masse&quot; was the creation of a national army in France, made up of citizens, rather than an all-professional army, as was the standard practice of the time.

Its main result, protecting French borders against all enemies, surprised and shocked Europe. The &quot;levée en masse&quot; was also effective in that by putting on the field many men, even untrained, it required France&#x27;s opponents to man all fortresses and expand their own standing armies, far beyond their capacity to pay professional soldiers.

The &quot;levée en masse&quot; also offered many opportunities for untrained people who could demonstrate their military proficiency, allowing the French army to build a strong officer and non-commissioned cadre.

Though not a novel idea—see for example thinkers as diverse as Plato, the political theorist Niccolo Machiavelli, and the lawyer and linguist Sir William Jones (who thought every adult male should be armed with a musket at public expense)—the actual practice of a &quot;levée en masse&quot; was rare before the French Revolution. The &quot;levée&quot; was a key development in modern warfare and would lead to steadily larger armies with each successive war, culminating in the enormous conflicts of World War I and World War II during the first half of the 20th century.

== &quot;Levée en masse&quot; in the Third Reich ==

Hitler proclaimed a &quot;levée en masse&quot; in early January 1945 during the Battle of the Bulge at a meeting of his &quot;inner circle&quot; of Hitler with Martin Bormann, Joseph Goebbels, Wilhelm Keitel and Albert Speer, after it was apparent that the &quot;breakthrough&quot; had failed. Only Speer opposed total conscription, saying it would paralyse the weapons factories and effectively kill the war effort. Goebbels sneered: &quot;Then, Herr Speer, you bear the historic guilt for the loss of the war for the lack of a few hundred thousand soldiers.&quot;

<text>The Minnesota Strikers were an American soccer team that competed in the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1984 season and in the Major Indoor Soccer League from 1984 through 1988. The team was based in Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area and played their outdoor home games at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and the Met Center for indoor games. Founded in 1967 as the Washington Darts and playing in Miami as the Gatos and the Toros before playing seven season as the Fort Lauderdale Strikers the team left Florida following the 1983 North American Soccer League season. After the 1987–88 season and playing four seasons in the MISL the team ceased operations.

==History==
===Origins and 1984 NASL season===

Founded in 1963 as the amateur club Washington Britannica and eventually rebranding as the Washington Darts, the team joined the North American Soccer League in 1970 after playing three seasons in the American Soccer League and winning two consecutive ASL championships. After the 1970 season, the team was sold to John Bilotta, former part owner of the Rochester Lancers, and Arthur Bant a hotel owner, who relocated and rebranded as the team as the Miami Gatos. After one season, the team was sold to a group of 25 local business leaders including Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie and his wife Elizabeth and renamed the Toros. In December 1976 and after five seasons in Miami, the team announced it was moving to Fort Lauderdale. Following the conclusion of the 1983 outdoor season season long rumors that the team was looking to move were confirmed when General Manager Tim Robbie met with officials in Minneapolis On November 30, 1983, team owner Elizabeth Robbie, Minnesota Governor Rudy Perpich, and NASL president Howard Samuels officially announced the team was moving and indicated the team had lost around $1 million in the last year.

The Strikers played their first game on the road against the Tampa Bay Rowdies, their former cross-state rivals in the Florida Derby, winning a game decided by a shootout. The team played its first home game at Metrodome on May 12, 1984, defeating the Chicago Sting 3-2. The Strikers ended the season with a record of fourteen wins and ten losses, tied for best record in the league. However, NASL rules awarded six points for a win, four for a shootout win, and one point for each goal scored during regulation up to three per game. This resulted in four other teams earning more than the 115 points the Strikers had for the season. This put the Strikers in third place of the Western Division and missing the playoffs. Prior to Soccer Bowl &#x27;84, the team announced head coach David Chadwick, who had moved with the team from Fort Lauderdale, would not return and hired Alan Merrick as his replacement.

===Major Indoor Soccer League 1984 - 1988===
On August 28, 1984, along with three other NASL team, the Strikers joined the Major Indoor Soccer League for the 1984–85 season. Finishing the season with a record of twenty-four wins and twenty-four losses, the Strikers qualified for the playoffs as a wildcard. After defeating the Wichita Wings two games to one in the Wildcard Series, the Strikers beat the Las Vegas Americans in the Quarterfinals three games to one. The May 12, 1984, game four of the Semifinals against the San Diego Sockers ended in a tie and was won by the Sockers in a shootout, resulting in a three game to one series victory for San Diego. However, the Strikers protested that Sockers player Jacques LaDouceur who scored a goal during the shootout was ineligible. The next day, MISL Commissioner Francis Dale ruled in the Strikers favor and awarded the game to Minnesota, resulting in a two games all series tie. In the fifth game of the series, San Diego defeated the Strikers seven goals to none. The Strikers finished the 1985–86 Major Indoor Soccer League season with a record of twenty-six wins and twenty-two losses and second place in the Eastern Division. Minnesota defeated the Dallas Sidekicks in the first round of the playoffs three games to one and the Cleveland Force in the Division Finals, also three game to one, to earn a spot in the Championship Series. After trailing the best of seven series against the Sockers three games to one, the Strikers were able to tie the series at three games a piece. However, San Diego was able to capture their fifth straight indoor title with a 5-3 victory over Minnesota on May 27, 1986. The Strikers finished the 1986–87 season with a record of twenty six wins and twenty six losses, in fourth place of the Eastern Division and qualifying for the playoffs. Meeting Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, the Force defeated the Strikers three games to two.

The team&#x27;s final season was the 1987–88 Major Indoor Soccer League season. The Strikers finished in first place of the Eastern Division with a record of thirty-one wins and twenty-five losses. A fight broke out with less than two minutes remaining in the second game of the Division Semifinals against the Baltimore Blast which resulted in players from both teams being ejected. The Strikers went on to defeat the Blast three games to one in the series. Facing the Cleveland Force in the Division Finals, the Strikers lost the series four games to one. On June 22, 1988, Executive Vice President Tim Robbie announced that his family had been looking to sell the team for two years but had not been able to find a buyer and therefore, owners Joe and Elizabeth Robbie had decided to terminate the franchise rather than post a $400,000 letter of credit with the league.

<doc id="1043840" wikidata="Q3777527" url="?curid=1043840" title="1988 Danish general election">
<text>General elections were held in Denmark on 10 May 1988, just seven months after the last elections. Prime Minister Poul Schlüter chose to call for an election after the Conservative People&#x27;s Party-led government fell short of a majority in a foreign policy issue after they failed to come to an agreement with the Social Democrats. In a parliamentary debate, Prime Minister Poul Schlüter accused Svend Auken (the leader of the Social Democrats) of breaking a political deal between the two of them whilst Auken accused Schlüter of lying to the public.

However, the election did not change the balance of power in the Folketing. Common Course failed to cross the 2% percent threshold and lost their four seats. The Centre Democrats and the Christian People&#x27;s Party left the government (although they continued to support it) and were replaced by the Danish Social Liberal Party. The reason for doing this was that it gave Schlüter a majority in foreign policy issues which had caused this election. Nonetheless, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People&#x27;s Party continued to support the government.

Voter turnout was 86% in Denmark proper, 70% in the Faroe Islands and 58% in Greenland.

<doc id="1043842" wikidata="Q3266243" url="?curid=1043842" title="Ludwig Lewisohn">
<text>Ludwig Lewisohn (May 30, 1882 – December 31, 1955) was a novelist, literary critic, the drama critic for &quot;The Nation&quot; and then its associate editor. He was the editor of the New Palestine, an American Zionist journal. He taught at the University of Wisconsin and at Ohio State University as well as serving as professor of German and Comparative Literature at Brandeis University. Lewisohn produced some 40 full-length fiction and non-fiction books, nearly as many translations, wrote numerous magazine and journal articles and edited countless other written works.

==Biography==
Lewisohn was born in Berlin, Germany to a highly assimilated, upper-middle class Jewish family. His parents Jacques Lewisohn and Minna (Eloesser) immigrated to the United States in 1890. The family settled in St. Matthews, South Carolina and then in 1892 moved to Charleston. Lewisohn&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a rabbi, but when the family moved to America they settled in an area where there was not a practicing Jewish congregation. He was sent to a Methodist Sunday school to improve his English. He integrated well into the Methodist community and its church and subsequently became an active Methodist. After graduating with honors from the College of Charleston, he went to Columbia University in 1902 to continue with graduate work. He received the degree of A.M. in 1903.

In 1904 he was told by his advisers that a Jew would never be hired to teach English literature at an American university. The bitter irony in this advice led Lewisohn to return to Judaism and he became an outspoken critic of American Jewish assimilation. In 1948 Lewisohn was among the founding faculty members of Brandeis University where he taught until his death.

Following his graduation from Columbia, Lewisohn worked for Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. in New York as a member of the editorial staff. The following year, 1905, he left Doubleday to become a free-lance magazine writer. In 1910, with the strong recommendation of his close friend William Ellery Leonard he became an instructor of German at the University of Wisconsin. He remained there for one year and then accepted the position of professor of German language and literature at Ohio State University. He served at the University until 1917 when war time sentiments forced his separation. Upon leaving Ohio State University Lewisohn became drama critic at &quot;the Nation&quot; and then was promoted to associate editor in 1920. He continued to write for &quot;The Nation&quot; until 1924. He translated from the German into English works of Gerhart Hauptmann, Jakob Wassermann and Franz Werfel.

In 1943 he became the editor of The New Palestine (magazine), working with them until 1948. He then began his work at Brandeis University.

Lewisohn was a member of the Jewish Academy of Arts and Sciences and was an honorary secretary of the Zionist Organization of America. Lewisohn
strongly supported the Zionist cause and he lectured and wrote widely on its behalf.

==Personal life==

When he first came to Columbia, Lewisohn had an affair with George Sylvester Viereck. He was married three times; to Mary Arnold in 1906, to Edna Manley in 1940 and to Louise Wolk in 1944. His first two marriages ended in divorce and he was survived in death by his third wife. Lewisohn also had a son, James Elias Lewisohn, by Thelma Spear, a concert singer with whom he had lived and had a relationship with for many years. Spear actually burst in on his wedding to Edna Manley at a Baltimore synagogue, insisting that he first marry and then divorce her or she would sue him for bigamy. Lewisohn died in Miami Beach, Florida on December 31, 1955.

<text>The Tamma (; ) is a river in Yakutia (Sakha Republic), Russia. It is a tributary of the Lena with a length of and a drainage basin area of .

The Tamma is the largest river of Megino-Kangalassky District. The villages of Darkylakh and Khaptagay are located by the river. 

==Course== 
The Tamma is a right tributary of the Lena. It is formed on the Sellyakait-Sella Ridge (Кряж Селлякаит-Селля), at the confluence of the Konyo-Daban and Ilin-Daban rivers in the Lena Plateau, between the Lena and the Amga. It heads in a roughly northwestern direction parallel to the Menda in its upper and middle course. It flows mostly across Megino-Kangalassky District but in one stretch it forms the border between this district and Khangalassky District. There are a few small lakes in the lower course of the river, part of the neighboring Lena floodplain. Finally it meets the Khaptagay arm of the Lena from its source near the village of Khaptagay, south of Yakutsk.

The largest tributary of the Tamma is the long Khompu from the right. The river freezes between October and May.

<doc id="1043858" wikidata="Q220900" url="?curid=1043858" title="Children of the Gods">
<text>&quot;Children of the Gods&quot; is the first episode of the military science fiction television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. It was written by producers Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright and was directed by Mario Azzopardi. The episode first aired on July 27, 1997, on &quot;Showtime&quot;. Originally presented as a television movie, the episode would later be split into two parts for repeats and syndicated viewings. A new, updated cut, which is entitled &quot;Children of the Gods – The Final Cut&quot; was released on DVD on July 21, 2009 by MGM Home Entertainment.

The story follows retired United States Air Force Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill (portrayed by Richard Dean Anderson) who is recalled by General George Hammond (portrayed by Don S. Davis) to Stargate Command after it is attacked by an alien force. After being reunited with Dr. Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) who has been living in secret on the alien world of Abydos, Daniel explains to O&#x27;Neill and Captain Samantha Carter (portrayed by Amanda Tapping) that the Stargate network traverses the entire galaxy. After retrieving Daniel and discovering where the attackers came from, the team travel to a new world where they encounter a race of beings posing as Gods, called the Goa&#x27;uld and find an unlikely ally named Teal&#x27;c (portrayed by Christopher Judge).

Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright developed the series to follow on from the events of 1994 film by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, incorporating a number of elements such as settings and characters. The pilot was filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia and had a budget of $7.5 million. Whilst the episode originally received mixed reviews, it gained a sizable following which would see the show last for 10 seasons, 214 episodes and lead to various spinoff shows.

==Background==

One year previously, as depicted in the movie &quot;Stargate&quot;, Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill (originally spelled O&#x27;Neil, portrayed by Kurt Russell) led a team through the Stargate to the planet Abydos, tasked with destroying any potential threat to Earth. After killing the Goa&#x27;uld System Lord Ra with a nuclear bomb, O&#x27;Neill returned to Earth with two survivors of his team, Charles Kawalsky (originally portrayed by John Diehl) and Louis Ferretti (originally portrayed by French Stewart). They leave behind Dr. Daniel Jackson (originally portrayed by James Spader), with his new love Sha&#x27;re (originally spelled Sha&#x27;uri, portrayed by Mili Avital) and her brother Skaara (portrayed by Alexis Cruz), falsely reporting that Dr. Jackson was killed on the mission along with the inhabitants of Abydos.

==Plot==

At Stargate Command in the Cheyenne Mountain Complex, five United States Air Force airmen play poker in front of a dormant covered Stargate, justifying their laid-back conduct as Stargate Command being a dead-end assignment with dwindling personnel. Airman Carol Weterings (Rachel Hayward), the only member of the group to raise concerns, notices the room shaking and investigates the Stargate, which suddenly activates. Warriors in metal armour with serpent helmets (Jaffa) appear through the gate and grab Weterings. Teal&#x27;c (Christopher Judge) presents her to their leader (the Goa&#x27;uld Apophis) to examine, before ordering his men to open fire, killing the other airmen. A quick reaction force led by Major General George Hammond (Don S. Davis) arrives to witness the Jaffa leaving with Weterings through the Stargate. Jack O&#x27;Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) is brought to Cheyenne Mountain where he is questioned along with his former teammates Charles Kawalsky (Jay Acovone) and Louis Ferretti (Brent Stait) about his first mission through the Stargate to Abydos.

With O&#x27;Neill unwilling to give any more information than what was already on their mission reports, Hammond believes the only response is to send a nuclear bomb through the Stargate to Abydos, to eliminate the threat. O&#x27;Neill reveals he lied about using the bomb to destroy Abydos and that although the alien Ra was killed, the people of Abydos are still alive and Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) is living among them. O&#x27;Neill convinces Hammond to let him communicate with Jackson by sending a box of tissues through to Abydos, which is promptly returned with a request to &quot;send more&quot; by Jackson, proving he is still alive. Hammond reinstates O&#x27;Neill to active duty and orders him to return to Abydos to investigate where the alien invaders came from. A team is assembled with O&#x27;Neill commanding, along with Kawalsky, Ferretti, and Captain/Dr. Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping). When they step through the Stargate, they find a group of Abydonians waiting for them, armed with military weapons from Earth.

After being reunited with Jackson, Skaara (Alexis Cruz), and Jackson&#x27;s spouse Sha&#x27;re (Vaitiare Bandera), O&#x27;Neill, Kawalsky, and Carter are led by Jackson to a large cavernous room, filled with what he believes to be coordinates of a vast network of Stargates across the entire galaxy. While O&#x27;Neill and the others are away, the same Jaffa team arrives through Abydos Stargate, kidnapping Skaara and Sha&#x27;re, severely injuring Ferretti, and killing several civilians. After returning to Earth, and learning that the Stargate can go to other worlds, nine teams are put together, including SG-1, led by O&#x27;Neill with Carter his second-in-command and Jackson, who is determined to find Sha&#x27;re, accompanying him. Kawalsky is given command of SG-2. Ferretti is able to recall the coordinates entered by the enemy troops on the Stargate, and the two teams head through the Stargate once more.

Meanwhile, Jackson&#x27;s wife Sha&#x27;re is selected as host to a Goa&#x27;uld, Amonet, the Queen of Apophis. After coming through the Stargate, SG-1 encounters a group of monks who escort them to a town of Chulak where they encounter Apophis and the now possessed Sha&#x27;re, before being captured. In prison, O&#x27;Neill, Carter, and Jackson find Skaara and are confronted by the enemy soldier Teal&#x27;c, who has noticed their technology. Skaara is selected to become a host and Teal&#x27;c is ordered to execute the remaining prisoners, but O&#x27;Neill, noticing Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s hesitancy, convinces him to help them escape.

O&#x27;Neill, Carter, Jackson, and Teal&#x27;c lead the prisoners toward the Stargate but are pinned down by two Goa&#x27;uld death gliders from above. O&#x27;Neill and Teal&#x27;c manage to damage one before being rescued by SG-2, who destroy the other. As team and liberated prisoners reach the Stargate, they are once again met by a possessed Skaara, who departs through the Stargate. Daniel rushes to open the Stargate back to Earth as the team defends against a battalion of attacking Jaffa. As they retreat through the Stargate to Earth, Kawalsky is invaded by an infant Goa&#x27;uld.

Safely home on Earth, Jackson and O&#x27;Neill reaffirm their determination to find Sha&#x27;re and Skaara and rescue them. O&#x27;Neill asks General Hammond to make Teal&#x27;c a member of their team, but the General says it is not his decision. As everyone leaves the gate room, Kawalsky&#x27;s eyes glow like a Goa&#x27;uld.

== Production ==
===Development===

After learning MGM were looking to develop a show based upon the 1994 film, &quot;Stargate&quot;, Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright - who worked on science fiction series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; together - both individually perused the project. At the time, Glassner who was living and working out of Vancouver, Canada, was keen to move back home to Los Angeles in the United States. Keen to keep Glassner with MGM in Vancouver, Glassner told them that he would only stay if they gave him &quot;Stargate&quot;. Some weeks later, Glassner and Wright were paired to develop the series together. Pitching to MGM and Showtime, they imagined the Stargate being run in a similar way to the NASA program, with teams going out and exploring. Keen to avoid comparisons to &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Stargate&quot; was set in the present day, not the future, with the teams going through the gate being outgunned and outmatched by the other races they encounter.

As part of developing both the series and writing the first episode, Glassner and Wright spent three months studying the original feature film, as well as any books, notes and scripts they could acquire to help them in developing the universe which their show would inhabit. Upset that MGM were developing a series and not sequels to their film, the original creators of the film Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich were unwilling to talk to Glassner and Wright.

Glassner and Wright completed their first draft of the pilot on October 18, 1996. Whilst many elements remain the same or similar in the completed script, the earlier draft had a number of key differences. Dr. Samantha Clayman, who was later re-imagined as Captain Samantha Carter, was penned by the duo as a theoretical astrophysicist, with a disdain for the military despite being a Lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. The more abrasively imagined character also didn&#x27;t warm to the other characters, including Dr. Jackson.

Continuing the feature film&#x27;s use of Ancient Egyptian deities, Apep, the serpent &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; was imagined as the pilot&#x27;s antagonist before settling on his alternative name of Apophis. The early draft had Apep cradling the Goa&#x27;uld symbiote from a fallen soldier, whilst his world of Chulak was conceived as being covered in snow. The Stargate Facility on Earth also had some differences, with Glassner and Wright imagining giant concrete doors shutting in front of the gate to stop unwanted visitors. Towards the pilot&#x27;s climax, a Goa&#x27;uld symbiote attaches itself to a member of SG2, Corporal Warren, making its way back to Earth before being discovered and destroyed by O&#x27;Neill. This was later reshaped into SG2 leader Major Kawalsky&#x27;s being taken as a host by a Goa&#x27;uld symbiote at the end of the pilot. The writers&#x27; main goals when writing the pilot were to bring O&#x27;Neill out of retirement, Jackson back to Earth, and introduce the Stargate as a way of going all over the galaxy.

===Cast===


John Symes, the president of MGM, had a relationship with Richard Dean Anderson and his producing partner Michael Greenburg and suggested that Anderson take over the role of Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill. Believing he would be unable to portray the strict, humourless military officer that Kurt Russell had depicted in the feature film, Anderson initially declined the offer until he was told that the show had already been given a 44 episode commitment and that he would be given ample leeway to shift the character away from Russell&#x27;s version.

For recasting Daniel Jackson, the team viewed auditions for around 500 actors, before narrowing it down to just 3 who were all very different. Michael Shanks, who was finishing his second year at Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Toronto, submitted a video audition before being flown to Los Angeles, with Shanks recalling that he &quot;must have tested for everybody at MGM and Showtime&quot;. Shanks got on well with Richard Dean Anderson during the process, and Glassner had a hunch that whilst Shanks appeared nervous, he would be able to bring wit and a sense humour to the role.

As well as bringing back O&#x27;Neill and Jackson from the film, Wright was adamant they introduce new characters, including a strong female character that would end up being Samantha Carter. An Air Force Captain and theoretical astrophysicist, Carter had been written as a &quot;hardass&quot;, so when Tapping auditioned, she decided to try to bring a sense of humour as well as more warmth and levity to the characters—even though it wasn&#x27;t written that way. In the casting process, the studio executives were predominantly interested in casting an actress based upon her physical attributes, with Glassner recalling that the studio &quot;wanted this other woman who was sort of the cliché hot woman who didn&#x27;t come across as very bright&quot;, whilst Wright and Glassner wanted Tapping for the role. It wasn&#x27;t until just two weeks before filming the pilot commenced that Tapping was finally given the role.

The part of Teal&#x27;c was conceptualised as a way of introducing the Goa&#x27;uld and Jaffa elements of the show&#x27;s story. As Teal&#x27;c was an alien, Glassner wanted the actor to look &quot;somewhat unique&quot; and have a &quot;strong, intimidating presence&quot;. Christopher Judge first learnt of the part from a friend&#x27;s roommate, who was also reading for the part and told his agent he would leave their agency unless they got him an audition for the role. Upon first glance of the script, Judge assumed it was going to &quot;yet another example of where the big, tough black guy is your stereotypical reformed slave&quot;, but upon reading it properly he realised that there was the chance to let &quot;&#x27;the guy with the muscle&#x27; be the one who might just lead his people away from slavery&quot;. When Judge entered the room to audition, Wright turned to Glassner and said &quot;ok - that&#x27;s him&quot;, to which Glassner whispered &quot;please God, let him be able to act&quot;. Judge, who had longer hair at the time, was asked to go bald for the role.

The role of General Hammond was originally imagined by Wright and Glassner as a black American man, resembling politician, diplomat, and United States Army four-star general Colin Powell. When Anderson and Greenburg came onboard they brought Don S. Davis in to audition, having worked with him on &quot;Macgyver&quot;. Shooting the pilot, director Mario Azzopardi wanted Davis to portray the character as a stereotypical military general, with Davis calling Hammond &quot;by-the-book&quot; and a &quot;foil for O&#x27;Neill&quot;, believing the character to be two-dimensional and a poor representation of what the United States military was really like. Davis, having served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War criticized Azzopardi&#x27;s &quot;limited imagination&quot;, and as the show progressed successfully encouraged Wright and Glassner to write his character to be a more well-rounded, better representation of a military general.

The role of the antagonist, Apophis, was filled by Peter Williams. Williams had originally auditioned for the part of Teal&#x27;c. Williams cut his dreadlocked hair off for the role, with Azzopardi suggesting that Williams look at people with delusions of grandeur for research, with Williams using Benito Mussolini as a template. Sha&#x27;re (originally spelled Sha&#x27;uri) was another character taken from the feature film. Vaitiare Bandera, who had been unsuccessful auditioning for the role as the character in the feature film was cast in the pilot. Bandera agreed to a topless scene, but this was changed during post to use full-frontal nude shoots. A reluctant Bandera was talked into agreeing after the scenes were slightly shortened. The producers had approached John Diehl, who originally portrayed Lieutenant Kawalsky in the feature film, to reprise his role, under the direction that Diehl would only return for 2 episodes. Diehl then decided he no longer wanted the part and it was recast to Jay Acovone. Although Acovone was open to playing the part for longer, the scripts for the first part of the season had already been completed. The producers also approached Alexis Cruz, who originally portrayed Ska&#x27;ra in the feature film and asked if he would take on a recurring role in the series. Cruz was interested but did not wish to be tied to a series, so the producers brought the character back in a smaller capacity.

Major Samuels, portrayed by Robert Wisden, would reoccur a number of times over the course of the show, as would actor Gary Jones, portraying a character simply credited as &quot;Technician&quot;. This character would eventually be named Walter, appearing in over 100 episodes.

===Filming===

Filming commenced on February 18, 1997, running for a total of 24 days, wrapping up in mid-March 1997. The episode was directed by Mario Azzopardi, who would go on to direct four more episodes of the series, as well as directing four episodes of the spin-off series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Andy Mikita was the first assistant director and would go direct 29 episodes of SG-1, as well as directing for spin-offs &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. The episode was shot on 16 mm film.

The North Shore Mountains in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada served as backdrop for the alien world of Chulak, with production taking place at Mid-Valley Viewpoint. The first days of shooting on location were particularly tough for the production due to heavy wind and rain. Conditions were so tough, many of the cast and crew wondered if this was indicative of what working on the show was going to be like, with writer and producer Jonathan Glassner initially wondering if the series was jinxed. Amongst the problems caused by the adverse weather was the entire first day&#x27;s film being scratched, to the point it was mostly unusable. The noise generated by the wind and rain meant that dialog was at times entirely inaudible, with many cast members struggling to deliver their lines due to coldness—notably Christopher Judge who at times was unable to maintain the deep imposing voice of his character, Teal&#x27;c. Many of the costumes worn by extras were soaking wet and covered in mud as the day went on.

Problems continued over the following days as production moved to filming the teams escape the prison on Chulak. As the scene required the seamless transition of the characters escaping out of the prison and into the surrounding alien forest, production opted not to construct the prison on a soundstage, but rather to build the set on location, in the mountains. The weather caused the set to keep blowing over, and eventually production staff were enlisted to physically hold the walls in place during shooting, to stop the set collapsing. Another issue, as noted by writer and producer Brad Wright, was that the set was so big, they didn&#x27;t have enough background actors to adequately fill it. Instead, just prior to shooting they had to move the walls to make the room smaller.

The Stargate Command set was to be built on Stages 5 and 6 at The Bridge Studios in Vancouver, however the buildings were still under construction and would not be complete in time for filming the pilot. As a result, production designer Richard Hudolin and construction coordinator Thom Wells designed and built the Stargate Command set in the effects stage at Bridge Studio, where it stayed for the pilot and subsequent episode &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;, before being taken apart at the end of February 1997 and moved to its permanent home.

Offscreen, over the course of filming the pilot, Amanda Tapping, Michael Shanks, and Christopher Judge, who had all relocated to Vancouver for the show, were all staying in the same hotel and would spend the vast majority of their time together after work. The three actors would go on to attribute their great on-screen chemistry to the genuine relationship and familiarity they were able to establish whilst making the pilot.

===Post production and effects===

Over 240 special effects were featured in the original cut of the pilot, with the post-production team working from when filming wrapped in March all the way through until July before the premiere. A mixture of practical and computer effects were used in the pilot. Matte paintings were used as backdrops and to extend locations, such as the Abydos Pyramid, which was based upon the feature film and re-created by Kent Matheson.

A miniature model death glider, based around a similar craft from the feature film, was used for the film&#x27;s climax. The model was created from Styrofoam and shot using a motion control rig by John Gajdecki&#x27;s visual effects team, mostly out his own studio in Toronto.

The Stargate effect itself was shot as production for the pilot and would be reused throughout the series to save money. What was known as the kawoosh effect was shot in a similar fashion to the feature film, although due to budget constraints when the gate opens it would not recede into an introverted cone behind the Stargate as it did in the feature. The effect was created by firing an air canon into a 5&#x27;×5&#x27;×5&#x27; tank of water, with some Sapphire Sparks to add glows.

Michelle Comens, who originally worked on the pilot as a coordinator, oversaw the updates for the visual effects as part of the 2009 Final Cut. This included supplementing Death Glider sequence from the end of the pilot with new computer-generated imagery, including a second Death Glider and adding a Cargo Ship, retconning the Death Glider from being used as a transport (which had only been done in the pilot). New scenic shots for the alien planets of Abydos &amp; Chulak were also created.

===Musical score===

Joel Goldsmith, who had previously worked with Brad Wright and Johnathan Glassner on their series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, was hired to score the series, with Rick Chadock editing. Early in production, Goldsmith opened a dialog with David Arnold, composer of the 1994 film &quot;Stargate&quot;, as he looked to incorporate the main theme from the film, as well as draw and expand upon some of the other cues.

Whilst all subsequent episodes of Stargate SG-1 would be scored with an electronic orchestra, Goldsmith utilized an orchestra to bring his score to life. Goldsmith worked on the score at his own private studio, Goldmore Studio in Sun Valley, Los Angeles, with Rick Chadock producing.

Despite resistance from Brad Wright and Joel Goldsmith, during post-production, executives at MGM and Showtime made the decision to use David Arnold&#x27;s score from the 1994 film more extensively, both in-place and in some cases directly on top of Goldsmith&#x27;s score. Alex Wilkinson&#x27;s music editing on the pilot was nominated for a Golden Reel Award.

The interlaced mix combining both Goldsmith and Arnold&#x27;s score which was used in the pilot was later released as a CD soundtrack on November 25, 1997, through Milan Records. Arnold and Goldsmith were so dissatisfied with the score that they both took their names off of it, with Goldsmith calling it &quot;horrible&quot;, affirming it had been made against their wishes.

In 2009, one of Brad Wright&#x27;s main motivations for revisiting &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; was his dissatisfaction with how the score had been presented. Wright convinced MGM that as part of the new version, they should cut David Arnold&#x27;s film score and instead restore Joel Goldsmith&#x27;s music, around 40 minutes of which had never properly been used or even heard. Wright&#x27;s new cut had both different pacing, with some scenes reordered, entirely new or completely cut, which required Goldsmith to slightly rework his score and create new cues.

On March 26, 2018, Dragon&#x27;s Domain Records released &quot;Stargate SG-1: Children of the Gods - The Final Cut - Original Soundtrack&quot; by Joel Goldsmith. Goldsmith, who passed away in 2012, had first discussed releasing the score from &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; when the Final Cut was released in 2009. The score was mastered by James Nelson, with the CD set accompanied by a booklet of liner notes by series co-creator Brad Wright.

==Release==
A month before the premiere, MGM and Showtime launched stargatesg-1.com, offering fans their first look at the show and the characters. A novelisation of the episode was written by Ashley McConnell and published by Channel 4 Books in 1999.

===Broadcast===
&quot;Children of the Gods&quot; was first shown in its entirety on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and was followed by a 20-minute featurette called &quot;The Stargate Saga&quot;, which contained interviews, behind the scenes footage and previews of the upcoming season. The pilot received Showtime&#x27;s highest-ever ratings for a series premiere with an audience of approximately 1.5 million households in the 8 p.m. Sunday slot, whilst also boasting as the highest-rated original movie shown on &quot;Showtime&quot; since 1994. In the UK, the episode was first shown on Sky One on April 8, 1998, before later being shown on Channel 4 in August 1999.

===Home media===
Both parts of &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; were released on VHS in 1998. &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; along with the subsequent episodes &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; and &quot;Emancipation&quot; were made available to purchase on DVD in 2000. These were presented in 16:9 aspect ratio, as opposed to the 4:3 ratio they were broadcast in. As the episode featured full-frontal nudity during the scene showing the possession of Sha&#x27;re (Vaitiare Bandera) by Amonet, it was rated R by the MPAA.

In May 2008, it was revealed an updated version of &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; was in development. The new version was the &quot;pet project&quot; of series co-creator Brad Wright. Wright was motivated after learning that MGM were keen to revisit dailies from the 10 years of SG-1 to put together blooper reels. Wright countered that he would instead want to revisit the pilot to restore Joel Goldsmith&#x27;s unreleased original score, originally imagining simply using a 1080p upscale of the original cut. As this developed, Wright secured more interest and funding from MGM, allowing him to revisit the original film dailies.

Longtime SG-1 editor, Brad Rines was brought on board to work on the new cut with Wright. In conjunction with revisiting dailies, $35,000 was spent on repairing the scratch that had been sustained to the film on the first day of shooting. Repairing the damaged footage, as well as no longer being restricted by having to present the show in 4:3 aspect ratio with the option of 16:9, as the 1997 cut had been, opened the project up to takes that Wright felt were in some cases better aesthetically and in the actors performances.

The new edit introduced scenes that did not make the original cut, as well as trimmed, moved, and in some cases entirely cut some scenes. Among the changes was the possession of Sha&#x27;re, which whilst still present in episode, the nude shots of Vaitiare Bandera were removed. Scenes involving Apophis&#x27; harem of women were cut as were some scenes between General Hammond &amp; Major Samuels. The possession of Major Kawalsky which sets up the subsequent episode &quot;The Enemy Within&quot; was also removed. A beat to explain how Apophis left Stargate Command on Earth, a question which Wright had frequently been asked was added in, along with additional exposition and character moments. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Peter Williams were among the cast members who were asked to provide automated dialogue replacement, whilst Christopher Judge re-recorded all of his dialog. During the process, Wright deliberated using scenes from a season 5 episode, &quot;Threshold&quot; which has scenes that overlap with &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; and further Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s decision to turn against the Goa&#x27;uld, however Wright ultimately decided it wasn&#x27;t necessary.

On July 21, 2009 &quot;Children of the Gods - The Final Cut&quot; was released as a standalone DVD. The release included Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s first ever DVD commentary, along with a 7-minute &quot;Back to the Beginning&quot; featurette detailing the changes made by Wright.

The original cut of &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, along with the rest of season 1 was first made available to download in January 2008 on iTunes and Amazon Unbox.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Reaction to the pilot was mixed. &quot;Starburst&quot; praised the episode, writing &quot;this is smart, witty and spectacular Sci-Fi, in which the cast find their feet instantly, and the FX crew create some stunning visuals&quot;. Writing for &quot;Science Fiction Weekly&quot;, Kathie Huddleston positively received the episode, writing &quot;Stargate was a fun B movie. Stargate SG-1 looks to be a fun, blast-&#x27;em-up, B television series&quot;. Huddleston praised Wright and Glassner for remaining faithful to the original feature film, highlighting the action and special effects, although did call out the fact that Ra&#x27;s people (the Goa&#x27;uld) could now speak English as being &quot;A little harder to swallow&quot;. Discussing the cast, the reviewer commented that Richard Dean Anderson &quot;doesn&#x27;t waste time trying to do an imitation of Russell&quot;, whilst calling Michael Shank&#x27;s portrayal of Dr. Daniel Jackson &quot;fairly good take on Spader&#x27;s original characterization&quot;. Huddleston felt that Amanda Tapping&#x27;s Capt. Samantha Carter &quot;seems a bit out of place as the writers try to create sexual tension between her and Anderson (not terribly successfully at this stage)&quot;. Brian Gray for &quot;UGO Networks&quot; called &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; &quot;a pilot that is worthy of theatrical release, with as much action and bravado as any feature.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Tony Scott criticized that &quot;superficial characters wander through their roles without stirring a modicum of conviction&quot;. He mocked that the wooden acting, &quot;pedestrian writing, pulp-mag plotting, shopworn characters, hackneyed dialogue [...] and Mario Azzopardi&#x27;s broad direction will all undoubtedly delight billions and billions&quot;. He predicted that the series is &quot;essentially for young people&quot;, and that &quot;if no one else, the kiddies are probably watching&quot; but that it didn&#x27;t stop the producers from &quot;blatantly showcasing naked young women&quot;. Criticism of the full-frontal nudity was echoed by other outlets, with Scott Pierce for &quot;Deseret News&quot; asserting &quot;it&#x27;s the sort of scene we&#x27;ve seen in countless sci-fi shows before - and having the actress disrobe is nothing but pure exploitation. You know, the sort of thing we&#x27;ve come to expect from Showtime&quot;. Pierce also criticised the episodes plot for being &quot;extremely similar&quot; to the feature film, although did believe that audiences might be &quot;pleasantly surprised&quot;. Will Joyner from &quot;The New York Times&quot; considered &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as a &quot;challenging, if derivative, mix&quot; that is &quot;more than a &quot;Stargate&quot; [feature film] fan might expect but certainly less than one would hope for&quot;. His opinion about the main cast was mixed, and he found it disturbing that &quot;SG-1&quot; used shock tactics to make up for its lower television budget. He would not recommend the show for children because of the &quot;grotesque physical attributes in the new villains&quot; and the &quot;gratuitous use of sexual implication and nudity&quot;. The episode got a Nielsen rating of 3.3 / 3.4, -4.

===Retrospective &amp; &quot;Final Cut&quot; Reviews===

Writing for &quot;IGN&quot;, R.L. Shaffer praised what he believed to be an &quot;extravagant, fun and surprisingly amusing, but very cheap-looking film&quot; and whilst he was critical of the shows sets and production, he attributed the cast&#x27;s performances to the ultimate longevity of the show. Reviewing the Final Cut, &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Dan Heaton noted that the episode displayed writers Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner still deciding whether they were going to move the show in a more adult, creepy or clever, family-fun direction, resulting in an unclear dominant tone in the pilot. Heaton believed the pilot had been strengthened through many of the changes, including using Goldsmith&#x27;s score and updates to some of the CGI, although was singled out the new Abydos Pyramid shots as looking &quot;too much like a video game&quot;.

In 2013 &quot;WhatCulture&quot; Joe Julians was complimentary of the episode, believing that the casting of Richard Dean Anderson and Michael Shanks made Kurt Russell and James Spader &quot;almost instantly forgotten&quot;, enjoying the humour that Anderson injected into the character. Julians also felt that whilst Samantha Carter goes on to be a &quot;great character&quot;, he felt that the writing in the pilot made her come across as &quot;entitled&quot;. The episode was ranked at number 19 out of 25, in a feature listing the series best episodes on &quot;Den of Geek&quot;. Writing for &quot;Comet&quot; in 2018, Kieran Dickson awarded the episode the number 1 spot on his Top 10 episodes of Stargate SG-1.

The shows creators and cast have criticised and gone onto parody some of the dialog from the episode. Amanda Tapping was particularly critical of how her character Samantha Carter was written in the episode, feeling that the dialog was not reflective of how women really speak. Tapping successfully encouraged Wright and Glassner to reconsider the way they wrote Carter in the series. One of the most notorious lines &quot;just because my reproductive organs are on the inside instead of the outside doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t handle whatever you can handle&quot; from Carter&#x27;s original introduction to the show was frequently mocked by the shows creators, and was even parodied in the season 8 episode &quot;Moebius&quot;. Ultimately, Wright was so dissatisfied with the line he cut it from the &quot;Final Cut&quot; version. Prior to airing the episode, Wright was called out on the decision to include nudity, which he justified by stating it was integral to the story. Glassner and Wright both later acknowledged that it was &quot;Showtime&quot; that pushed for the scenes, believing it would help ratings and that it had no place in what was otherwise a family show.

<doc id="1043859" wikidata="Q4306617" url="?curid=1043859" title="Music of Olympia, Washington">
<text>The port city of Olympia, Washington, has been a center of post-hardcore, anti-folk, indie rock and other youth-oriented musical genres since the late 1970s. Before this period, Olympia&#x27;s The Fleetwoods had several Billboard chart successes between 1959 and 1963. Olympia saw a rise in feminism in the music industry, where artists commonly addressed rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, classism, anarchism, and female empowerment in their songs. It was a center for the riot grrrl movement of the early 1990s, which featured Bikini Kill and Bratmobile.

Olympia&#x27;s downtown Capitol Theater hosted the punk and indie-rock International Pop Underground Convention in 1991 and the Yoyo-A-Go-Go festival in 1994, 1997, 1999 and 2001. The city has several record labels and companies, including K Records and Kill Rock Stars; Kill Rock Stars has signed Bikini Kill, Sleater-Kinney, Unwound and Elliott Smith.

<text>Energy–maneuverability theory is a model of aircraft performance. It was developed by Col. John Boyd, a fighter pilot, and Thomas P. Christie, a mathematician with the United States Air Force, and is useful in describing an aircraft&#x27;s performance as the total of kinetic and potential energies or aircraft specific energy. It relates the thrust, weight, aerodynamic drag, wing area, and other flight characteristics of an aircraft into a quantitative model. This enables the combat capabilities of various aircraft or prospective design trade-offs to be predicted and compared.

== Formula ==

All of these aspects of airplane performance are compressed into a single value by the following formula:

:formula_1

== History ==
John Boyd, a U.S. jet fighter pilot in the Korean War, began developing the theory in the early 1960s. He teamed with mathematician Thomas Christie at Eglin Air Force Base to use the base&#x27;s high-speed computer to compare the performance envelopes of U.S. and Soviet aircraft from the Korean and Vietnam Wars. They completed a two-volume report on their studies in 1964. Energy Maneuverability came to be accepted within the U.S. Air Force and brought about improvements in the requirements for the F-15 Eagle and later the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighters.

<doc id="1043873" wikidata="Q321090" url="?curid=1043873" title="German Brazilians">
<text>German Brazilians (German: &quot;Deutschbrasilianer&quot;, Hunsrik: &quot;Deitschbrasiliooner&quot;, ) refers to Brazilians of full or partial German ancestry. German Brazilians live mostly in the country&#x27;s South Region, with a smaller but still significant percentage living in the Southeast Region.

Between 1824 and 1972, about 260,000 Germans settled in Brazil, the fifth largest nationality to immigrate after the Portuguese, the Italians, the Spanish, and the Japanese. By 1940, the German diaspora in Brazil totaled about a million. 

The rapid increase in numbers was due to a relatively high birth rate, the highest in Brazil amongst immigrant groups although still lower than that of the local population. 

The majority settled in the Brazilian states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Less than 5% of Germans settled in Minas Gerais, Pernambuco, and Espírito Santo.

According to a 1999 survey by IBGE researcher Simon Schwartzman, in a representative sample of the Brazilian population, 3.6% said they had some degree of German ancestry, a percentage that in a population of about 200 million amounts to 7.2 million descendants. In 2004, Deutsche Welle cited the number of 5 million Brazilians of German descent. 

According to a 2016 survey published by Institute of Applied Economic Research, in a universe of 46,801,772 names of Brazilians analyzed, 1,525,890 or 3.3% of them had the only or the last surname of German origin, a proportion that represents about 6.7 million individuals if applied to the entire population in that year.

German dialects together make up the second most spoken first language in Brazil after Portuguese. A few Brazilian municipalities have Brazilian Hunsrückisch and Germanic East Pomeranian as co-official with Portuguese; they are located in Southern Brazil and Espírito Santo. It has been estimated that between 2 and 3 million people can speak Brazilian Hunsrückisch to some degree or other.

==Overview==

The 19th century was marked by an intense emigration of Europeans to different parts of the world, which led to a process of Europeanisation of these areas. Between 1816 and 1850, 5 million people left Europe; between 1850 and 1880 another 22 million people emigrated. Between 1846 and 1932, 60 million Europeans emigrated. Many Germans left the German states after the failed revolutions of 1848. 

Between 1878 and 1892, another 7 million Germans left Germany; after the 1870s Germany was one of the countries from which the largest numbers of people emigrated, the vast majority to the United States. From 1820 to 1840, Germans represented 21.4% of all European immigrants entering the USA; 32.2% in the following two decades; and at the end of the 19th century they were the largest immigrant group (21.9%) in the US.

German immigration to Brazil was small compared to the numbers who went to the United States, and also compared to immigration of other nationalities, such as Portuguese, Italians and Spaniards, who together made up over 80% of the immigrants to Brazil during the period of greatest immigration by Europeans. Germans appeared in fourth place among immigrants to Brazil, but dropped to fifth place when Japanese immigration increased after 1908.

Even though the immigration of Germans to Brazil was small, it had a notable impact on the ethnic composition of the country, particularly of the Southern Brazilian population. Different factors led to this large influence. First of all, German immigration to Brazil is an old phenomenon which started as early as 1824, many decades before the beginning of the immigration of other European ethnic groups to Brazil. 

For example, the first significant groups of Italians to immigrate to Brazil only arrived in 1875, many decades after the arrival of the first Germans. When the settlement of other Europeans in Brazil began, the Germans had already been living there for many generations. Another factor was the high birth rates among German Brazilians. Research has found that between 1826 and 1828 a first-generation German Brazilian woman had an average of 8.5 children, and the second generation had an average of 10.4 children per woman.

The book &quot;The Monroe Doctrine&quot; by T B Edgington said:

&quot;The natural increase of the German population in southern Brazil is marvelous. As a rule they rear from ten to fifteen children in each family. Blumenau, a colony which was settled by the Germans over fifty years ago, more than doubles itself every ten years. Southern Brazil is now called &#x27;Greater Germany&#x27;, and the Germans exercise there a commercial and financial supremacy.&quot;

Even though the population of German descent makes up a small minority in Brazil, they represent a very large percentage of the population of the South. Jean Roche estimated that people of German descent made up 13.3% of the population in Rio Grande do Sul in 1890, and that they had increased to 21.6% of the population in 1950. By 1920, the vast majority of the population of German descent was Brazilian-born. 

The census of 1920 revealed that foreigners constituted only 3% of the population of the old German communities of São Leopoldo, Estrela, Montenegro and Bom Retiro do Sul. São Leopoldo, then with 46,482 inhabitants, had only 1,159 foreigners. In the new German communities the proportion of foreigners was larger, for example in Ijuí (15%) and Erechim (25%), indicating they were newer destinations of immigrants in the state. The census of 1940 revealed that virtually all the population of German descent was native-born.

==Immigration==
When German-speaking immigrants first arrived in Brazil starting at the beginning of the 19th century, they did not identify themselves so much as a unified German-Brazilian group. However, as time went on this common regional identity did emerge for many different geo-socio-political reasons. Germans immigrated mainly from what is now Germany, but also from other countries where German communities were established. From 1824 to 1969, around 250,000 Germans emigrated to Brazil, being the fourth largest immigrant community to settle in the country, after the Portuguese, Italians and Spaniards. About 30% of them arrived between World War I and World War II.

==First German settlement in Brazil==

The first German immigrants to settle in Brazil were 165 families who settled in Ilhéus, Bahia, in 1818. One year later, 200 families settled São Jorge, in the same state. Some Germans were brought to work in the Brazilian army after Independence from Portugal in 1822.

However, the cradle of the German settlement in Brazil was São Leopoldo, in 1824. At that time Southern Brazil had a very low population density. Most of its inhabitants were concentrated on the coast and a few in the Pampas. The interior was covered by forests and sparsely populated by different groups of native Amerindians. The absence of a unified population in the interior was regarded as a problem by the Brazilian government because Southern Brazil could easily be invaded by neighboring countries.

Since Brazil was recently independent from Portugal, it was not possible to bring Portuguese immigrants. Germany was suffering the effects of the wars against Napoleon, overpopulation and poverty in the countryside. Many Germans were willing to immigrate to Brazil. Furthermore, Brazil&#x27;s Empress, Maria Leopoldina, was Austrian and encouraged the arrival of German immigrants.

===First communities===
Major Schaeffer, a German who was living in Brazil, was sent to Germany in order to bring immigrants. He brought immigrants and soldiers from Rhineland-Palatinate. To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised large tracts of land where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. In fact, these lands were in the middle of big forests and the first Germans had been abandoned by the Brazilian government. From 1824 to 1829, the Major brought 5,000 Germans to Brazil.

German immigrants in Brazil settled mostly in rural areas, called colonies (&quot;colônias&quot; in Portuguese). These colonies were created by the Brazilian government, and the lands were distributed among the immigrants. They had to construct their own houses and cultivate the land.

The first years were not easy. Many Germans died of tropical disease, while others left the colonies to find better living conditions. The German colony of São Leopoldo was in the early years a disaster. Nevertheless, in the following years, a further 4,830 Germans arrived at São Leopoldo, and then the colony started to develop, with the immigrants establishing the town of Novo Hamburgo (&quot;New Hamburg&quot;). From São Leopoldo and Novo Hamburgo, the German immigrants spread into other areas of Rio Grande do Sul, mainly close to sources of rivers. The whole region of Vale dos Sinos was populated by Germans. During the 1830s and part of the 1840s German immigration to Brazil was interrupted due to conflicts in the country (Ragamuffin War).

===Waves of immigrants===

Immigration restarted after 1845 with the creation of new colonies. The most important ones were Blumenau in 1850 and Joinville in 1851, both in Santa Catarina state; these attracted thousands of German immigrants to the region. Some of the mass influx was due to the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. Nowadays these areas of German colonization are among the wealthiest parts of Brazil, with the lowest levels of unemployment and illiteracy found in the country, and still retain a strong influence from German culture.

By the end of the 19th century, 122 German communities had been created in Rio Grande do Sul, and many others in Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro. Germans helped to establish a middle-class population in Brazil, a country that was formerly divided between slaves and their masters.

&quot;Nowhere are our colonies, those loyal offshoots from the mother root, so promising as here. Today in these provinces, over thirty per cent of the inhabitants are Germans, or of German descent, and the ratio of their natural increase far exceeds that of the Portuguese. Surely to us belongs this part of the world, and the key to it all is Santa Catharina, stretching from the harbor of San Francisco far into the interior with its hitherto undeveloped, hardly suspected wealth. Here indeed, in southern Brazil, is a rich and healthy land, where the German emigrant may retain his nationality, where for all that is comprised in the word &#x27;Germanismus,&#x27; a glorious future smiles.&quot;
– Dr. Leyser, a German traveller in South Brazil at the beginning of the 20th centuryBy 1905 the German Navy Office listed that there were over 140k Germans living in Brazil, 131.5k of those being &quot;Reich&quot; Nationals and the other 8.5k being &quot;Reich&quot; Citizens, with 24 German consulates.

==Urban Germans in Brazil==

Not all Germans who settled in Brazil became farmers. In the early 20th century, very few rural areas of Southern Brazil were empty. Most of them had been settled by German, Italian and Polish immigrants during the 19th century. 

Given this situation, most Germans who immigrated to Brazil during the 20th century settled in big towns, although many of them also settled in the old rural German colonies. German immigration to Brazil peaked during the 1920s, after World War I. 

These Germans were mostly middle-class laborers from urban areas of Germany, different from the poor peasants who had settled in the colonies of Brazil during the 19th century.

In 1858, Germans were 15% of Porto Alegre&#x27;s population, 10% of São Paulo&#x27;s population in 1860, and 60% of the immigrants living in Curitiba by the end of the 19th century. In Rio de Janeiro, by 1830 there were 20 businesses owned by Germans. Twenty years later the number reached 50.

People of German descent actively participated in the industrialization and development of big cities in Brazil, such as Curitiba and Porto Alegre.

In São Paulo, Germans founded their first colony in 1829. By the beginning of the 20th century, the city was considered the center of the German Brazilian Culture. The city attracted German immigrants until the 1950s. Today, there are 400,000 German Brazilians living within Greater São Paulo.

==Pioneering period==

The German settlements, and also those of other European ethnic groups, occupy a vast area in the centers of the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. To the east, they border the old areas of Azorean Portuguese colonization, and to the south and west, the &quot;gaúcho&quot; grazing areas. The areas of German settlement emerged in the center of the region, isolated from other settlements. 

In these remote pastoral and farming areas, the immigrants were not under the control of the powerful Brazilian landowners. Due to this isolation, the immigrants were able to organize themselves independently, building their own churches, schools and municipal authorities. The children were educated in German. Portuguese became dominant later, as a means of communication with Brazilians or with immigrants of other nationalities.

The first generation of immigrants faced the arduous task of surviving while opening gaps in the virgin forest to build their own houses and roads. Attacks by Indians were common. Isolated from other settlements, the Germans also had to face the difficulty of finding markets for their products. The initial difficulty was to define which productive activities could be integrated into the Brazilian economy. Only the penury faced by these people in Europe, due to the consequences of the Industrial Revolution and of the crisis during the consolidation of European nations, can explain their persistence in Brazil, sometimes facing miserable conditions which were worse than those they left in Europe. Once in Brazil, however, they became small landowners, which facilitated their development.

==Period of prosperity==
The following generations benefited from the efforts of the pioneer immigrants and prospered. The families grew and the settlements expanded, coming to constitute a thriving German community of small landowners. At first, they found virgin forests that could be occupied or bought at low prices. During this period, the more isolated communities suffered from messianic anomie, influenced by popular German traditions of Protestant aspirations. This led to the Revolt of the Muckers in the 1870s, which culminated in several crimes and murders.

==Identity==

According to Darcy Ribeiro, despite their isolation, the descendants of Germans knew that Brazil was their home now. The new immigrants who arrived from Germany were clearly different from German Brazilians of older stock. German Brazilians had moved away from European standards, habits, language and aspirations. 

However, coexistence with the local Brazilians (Amerindians, Portuguese Brazilians of Azorean stock, mixed-race &quot;gaúchos&quot; and a few Afro-Brazilians) showed that the differences with the locals were also great. The misery faced by Brazilians of other origins was also not attractive to German Brazilians. Hence, German Brazilians eventually created a third identity, which was not completely German (because of the distance that created sharp differences) but also not completely Brazilian (because of the undesirable misery seen in Brazilians). 

Their isolation and cultural and linguistic conservatism gave rise to conflicts between German Brazilians (and also Japanese Brazilians, Italian Brazilians, etc.) on one side, and Brazilians of older extraction on the other. The nationalization was fundamental, compelling the teaching of foreign languages at schools, breaking the isolation of the communities and recruiting young people of foreign origins to serve in the military.

Migrating to urban centers, the younger generations broadened their cultural horizon and their own vision of Brazil. When they returned to their hometowns, they endorsed a Brazilian identity which was already becoming imperative. 

The above-average social, economic and cultural progress of the German settlements and their simultaneous integration into Brazilian markets as producers and consumers facilitated the integration of the descendants of Germans in Brazil. Since the second half of 20th century to present, this population is no longer seen as &quot;foreign&quot; by other Brazilians, but as a modern progressive urban population. 

The identification as &quot;Brazilians&quot; is also dominant among German Brazilians, since the cultural world of their ancestors was completely changed. It has become unrealistic for them to assert any other ethnic identity than Brazilian. Since the second half of 20th century to present, the only notable differences between Brazilians of German and of non-German European and Arab ancestry are in levels of education (higher among German Brazilians), in a few surviving German traditions.

==Panorama of German communities==
The German Brazilian areas form, today, a Brazilian region with its own character, made up of towns and large concentrations of residents around the church, commerce and school. These rural villages are connected to major cities where the economy was diversified, adding cottage industries to the original agricultural production. 

In this way, the Southern Brazilian areas of European settlements formed a prosperous regional economy and a European cultural landscape, contrasting with the relative Portuguese-Brazilian uniformity found in the rest of Brazil. In recent years a large industrial development has occurred in these areas, stemming from the cottage industry. 

Some of the old German communities are now prosperous industrial centers, such as São Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Blumenau, Joinville and Itajaí. The Germans became entrepreneurs due to their knowledge of more complex techniques of production than those dominated by other Brazilians. In addition their bilingualism gave them better European contacts.

Historically, a considerable number of German Brazilians and others of European ancestry populated certain cities and states. In the city of Blumenau, Santa Catarina, during the last decade of the 19th century, 70% of the population was ethnically Germanic, 15% were Italians, and 15% others. The German Brazilian population in Espírito Santo was 73,000 in 1960, 145,000 in 1980 and 250,000 in 2004.



===End of expansion===

If in the beginning Germans found a region with vast empty areas, later with the compulsory occupation of the lands, the German expansion came to an end. As they expanded, the German settlements encountered the pastoral areas of the &quot;gaúchos&quot; to the west and south. The Gaúcho area was an impoverished region consisting of huge farms, dominated by a small elite of landowners who monopolized the lands and a mass of underemployed people who worked for them in poor conditions, similar to the rest of Brazil and very different from the areas of German settlements, where each family had their own small farm. Due to the expansion of German and other European settlements in Southern Brazil, the lands for each family became limited because there was no more land available. Plots of land previously settled by a single family started to be occupied by two or four families. Without their own land, some descendants of Germans regressed to a situation of poverty, mingling with the mass of &quot;gaúchos&quot; and descendants of Azorean Portuguese who make up the poor in Southern Brazil, in search of land to work.

==Culture==
===Language===
The use of the German language is in decline in Brazil, however, there are 3,000,000 Brazilians who speak German and important German-speaking communities in Brazil even almost 200 years after the beginning of immigration. According to Born and Dickgiesser (1989, p. 55) the number of Brazilians of German descent in 1986 was 3.6 million. For Rio Grande do Sul, based on data from Birsa (Bilingualism in Rio Grande do Sul), for 1970, Altenhofen (1996, p. 56) estimated at 1,386,945 the number of speakers of a variety of German. As of 1996, he estimated that it had dropped to between 700,000 and 900,000 speakers. Damke (1997, p. 59), as of 1996, estimated more than 2 million speakers of any variety of the German language in Brazil.

German immigrants preserved their language more than any other group of immigrants in Brazil. This was mainly due to shared cultural identity and the desire to recreate in Brazil an environment with characteristics of the country they believed they would never return to. In addition, the large differences between the German and Portuguese languages hindered learning of the national language of Brazil, which was and remains a pretext for continuing use of German dialects. The main German dialect spoken in Brazil is Hunsrückisch, and according to Ammon, who visited German-speaking communities in Southern Brazil in 2004, the Hunsrik Language&quot;&quot; lexicon is still quite similar to that of modern German speakers, even after almost 200 years of distance.

Hamel (1988, p. 64) and Damke (1997, p. 60–61) observed that there is a balance between the use of German and Portuguese in the German-speaking communities of Brazil. But, gradually, the trend is that Portuguese is becoming dominant. Despite the &quot;myth of monolingualism in the country&quot;, i.e., that all Brazilians speak only Portuguese, German continues to have a strong presence even today. This myth is effective in hiding the country&#x27;s linguistic minorities, including the indigenous nations and as well as the speakers of immigrant languages. But it also hides the majority of the Brazilian population that speaks discredited varieties of Portuguese instead of the formal standard Portuguese taught in schools. According to Oliveira (2000: 84), Brazil is one of the most multilingual countries in the world, with inhabitants speaking around 200 languages, of which about 170 are indigenous and 30 languages of immigrants.

The Brazilian census of 1940 revealed that German was the second most spoken language in Brazil, with 644,458 speakers. In a total population of nearly 1 million German Brazilians at that time, over half still spoke German as their mother tongue. The vast majority of the German speakers were Brazilian-born, with a minority born in Germany or in another German-speaking country. The other main languages spoken were Italian with 458,054, Japanese with 192,698 and Spanish with 74,381.

===Discrimination===
The &quot;myth of monolingualism&quot;, along with the general idea that speaking Portuguese was a &quot;condition to be Brazilian&quot;, has masked the presence of minority languages and contributed to ideas that German Brazilians were separatist and did not want to learn Portuguese or assimilate. However, these beliefs did not take into account that the German communities in Brazil were formed in places isolated by forests, where the Portuguese-speaking population was not present, and it was natural that the children continue speaking German rather than adopt the Portuguese language with which they rarely had contact. 

The fact that they spoke German did not prevent them from seeing themselves as Brazilians, since they saw themselves as &quot;Brazilians of German culture.&quot; Under Getúlio Vargas&#x27;s government, during World War II, when Brazil broke off diplomatic relations with Germany (and also with the other Axis Powers, Italy and Japan), the use of the German language was repressed: teaching German in schools and publication of German newspapers were forbidden (together with Italian and Japanese).

In this context, monolingualism appeared to solve the problems of learning Portuguese, and the language of immigrants was regarded as responsible for school failure and difficulties in learning Portuguese. In 1989 there was a controversy regarding German speakers in Brazil when the mayor of Santa Maria do Herval, a town in Rio Grande do Sul, issued a verbal orientation to the municipality&#x27;s elementary teachers to retain students using Hunsrückisch during break time to &quot;teach them Portuguese&quot;. Disagreement ensued, with some decrying the initiative as repressive, and others (including people of German descent) supporting the mayor on the basis that not being able to speak Portuguese is a handicap in Brazilian society. The guideline has since been overturned.

===Religion===

Most German Brazilians are either Roman Catholics or Lutherans. As with other Brazilians, there is a significant minority of non-religious people, and Pentecostalism is on the rise. Almost 85% of all Lutherans in Latin America and the Caribbean live in Brazil. Brazil has the second largest Lutheran community in the Americas, after the United States and ahead of Canada.

===Media===
The printed media include newspapers like &quot;Deutsche Zeitung&quot; or magazines like &quot;Entre Rios&quot;, &quot;Lindenpost&quot; and &quot;Sankt Paulusblatt&quot;.

===Fashion and models===
Within the fashion business, influences of German ancestry have been noticeable throughout Brazil.

Renowned German Brazilian models include Gisele Bündchen, Ana Hickmann, Ana Claudia Michels, Mariana Weickert, Letícia Birkheuer, Raquel Zimmermann, Cintia Dicker, Solange Wilvert, Monique Olsen, Carol Trentini, Jeísa Chiminazzo, Shirley Mallmann, Camila Finn, Bruna Erhardt and Aline Weber.

Winners of the Miss Brazil beauty pageant have included Vera Fischer (1969), Mariza Sommer (1974), Ingrid Budag (1975), Eveline Schroeter (1980), Maria Carolina Portella Otto (1990), Leila Cristine Schuster (1993), Thaisa Thomsen (2002), Carina Beduschi (2005), Rafaela Zanella (2006), Gabriela Markus (2012), and Marthina Brandt (2015), who all share German ancestry.

===Year of Germany===

Beginning May 2013 Brazil celebrates the &quot;Year of Germany in Brazil&quot;. Just in time for German Unity Day on 3 October 2012 the world-famous Christ the Redeemer monument in Rio de Janeiro was illuminated in Germany&#x27;s national colors of black, red and gold to point towards this awaited event. The motto of the year is &quot;Germany and Brazil – when ideas come together.&quot; 

The Unidos da Tijuca school, the third-oldest samba school, reigning carnival champions, chose to go for a German theme at this year&#x27;s Carnival with an unusual title for their 80-minute performance in February 2013: &quot;Alemanha Encantada&quot; or &quot;Enchanted Germany,&quot; which is about &quot;Brazil and Germany coming together: colours, cultures, and capabilities,&quot; the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported. 

It was a mammoth show, involving eight floats, built on buses, with various Germanic features – including outsized Playmobil figures, the moon (to represent Germany pioneering rocket scientists, e.g. Wernher von Braun), and figures from ancient Germanic mythology, including thunder god Thor. 

Artistic director Paulo Barros, who has already choreographed two winning Sambadrome performances, packed Germany into five acts, beginning with Germanic gods and assorted mythic creatures. There follows Goethe&#x27;s Faust, Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s outcast characters, Fritz Lang robots, and a depiction of Marlene Dietrich as The Blue Angel. Meanwhile, the &quot;Universe of Children&quot; section is dedicated to German fairytales and toys. The whole spectacle was broadcast in its entirety on Brazilian TV station Globo-TV, with an audience of more than 190 million viewers.

==Forced assimilation==
::&quot;We most desire that at any cost a German country containing some 20 to 30 million Germans may grow in the twentieth century in Brazil, and that, no matter whether it remains a portion of Brazil or becomes a self-containing state or enters into close relations with our empire.&quot;

Gustav von Schmoller, German economist (1900).

When Germans first arrived in Southern Brazil in 1824, they found a country with a climate, vegetation and culture very different from those of Germany. Southern Brazil was a land of gauchos, cattle herders who lived, and still live, in the Pampas region of the Southern Cone. In the following decades, however, waves of German-speaking immigrants arrived, to the point that in many areas of Southern Brazil the vast majority of the inhabitants were Germans and even after three or four generations born in Brazil, these people used to consider themselves Germans.

Between 1937 and 1945 a significant portion of the Brazilian population suffered interference in daily life produced by a &quot;campaign of nationalization&quot;. This population – called &quot;alien&quot; by the Brazilian government – was composed of immigrants and their descendants. Both the Brazilian Empire and the early Republic allowed groups of immigrants to settle in isolated communities, mainly in Southern Brazil, and to some extent in other parts, such as Espírito Santo, in the Southeast. These people had not been assimilated into the majority Brazilian society, a fact that worried the government of President Getúlio Vargas. The army had an important role during this process of forced assimilation of these areas of &quot;foreign colonization&quot; that created so-called &quot;ethnic cysts&quot; in Brazil. German Brazilians saw themselves as part of a pluralist society, so that the &quot;Deutschtum&quot; conception (of being part of a community with a shared German ancestry) seemed compatible with the fact that they were also Brazilian citizens. However, the Brazilian government only accepted the idea of the jus soli, so that all people born in Brazil should see themselves as Brazilians, and leave other ethnic associations behind. The Brazilian view contrasted with the jus sanguinis conception of most German Brazilians of that time, who were still connected to the ancestral homeland.
Not only the people of German origin were considered &quot;alien&quot;: almost all descendants of immigrants, in some degree, were &quot;non-assimilated&quot;, in the opinion of Bethlem and other participants in the campaign. However, evidence of greater resistance to &quot;abrasileiramento&quot; (Brazilianization) was found in those areas considered &quot;redoubts of Germanism&quot;, a situation considered risky to the cultural, racial and territorial integrity of the nation. One of the areas considered &quot;non-patriotic&quot; was the Vale do Itajaí, where the population was composed mostly of Germans, Italians and Poles. Following the establishment of the Brazilian Estado Novo in 1937, the Vale do Itajaí was viewed in the eyes of the dominant national ideology as a place of &quot;strange customs full of non-national Brazilians, contaminated by ideals of a nation that collapsed Brazil, a place of disintegration of national spirit&quot;. During this period of nationalization, the Germans were considered the most &quot;alien&quot;, the Italians closest to the Brazilians, and the Poles in an intermediary position, but none of them were seen as unequivocally Brazilian. The fear of secession was not a novelty in regard to the definition of the Brazilian nation-state: long before 1939, Brazilian nationalists feared the collapse of the South, considering it &quot;too Germanized&quot;. Many members of the Brazilian army participated during this process, such as Nogueira:

Nogueira also compared the German Brazilians to &quot;an octopus extending its tentacles&quot; in Southern Brazil. Nogueira used the image of the occupation of the most fertile areas of southern territory by foreigners, who had no intention of being integrated into the country, but had remained segregated since the beginning of their settlement. The record of the first impressions about the city of Blumenau in his book received the subtitle of &quot;One Weird City&quot;, arguing that &quot;the German language is spoken without constraints, including in public offices&quot;. Silvio Romero (1906) compared German immigration to the Barbarian Invasions which brought about the end of the Roman Empire. Writings by different authors against the German settlement in Brazil displayed clear xenophobia against the so-called &quot;German threat&quot;. The Portuguese language was presented as a fundamental criterion of nationality and this justified the nationalization of education and the closing of ethnic schools. Most German Brazilians could barely speak Portuguese, and when German was prohibited in the country, they faced many difficulties due to this language barrier.

From this perspective, the human element representative of the &quot;more legitimate&quot; national formation had the task of conforming immigrants and their descendants to the myth of the amalgam of the three races that makes up the Brazilian nation (Europeans, Black Africans and Amerindians).

In the 1930s, Brazil was home to one of the largest German populations outside Germany, with 100,000 German-born people and a community of 1 million people of German descent, whose ancestors had been settling the country since 1824. Brazil also had the largest number of members of the Nazi Party outside of Germany, with 2,822 members. The large number of people with German roots and a notable number of Nazi members were used by the Brazilian government to justify their programs of nationalization. During World War II, in 1942, Nazi Germany attacked Brazilian ships and Brazil declared war against Germany. President Getúlio Vargas initiated a strict program of forced cultural assimilation – &quot;Nacionalismo&quot;- that worked quite efficiently, if not initially.
He forbade any organised manifestation of German culture in Brazil. Schools were required to teach exclusively in Portuguese, and the publishing of books, newspapers and magazines in foreign languages (which in practice meant German language and Italian language) was subjected to prior censorship by the Ministry of Justice The use of foreign languages in governmental precincts was forbidden, as well as the use of foreign languages in religious services. Members of the Brazilian army were sent to areas of &quot;foreign colonization&quot; to &quot;monitor&quot; the local population. There are records of arrest or moral coercion motivated by the use of foreign languages.

===Nazism===


These problems were aggravated with the rise of Nazism in Germany. The Nazi Party soon took to the task of organizing abroad, wherever significant populations of German origin were present. In Brazil, the results were not as the party expected. 

About 3,000 people joined it, making the Brazilian section the numerically most important foreign branch of the Nazi Party; however, the considerable population of German origin in Brazil may have been more a problem than an asset for the German Nazi Party: if on the one hand it raised the hope of interfering in Brazilian internal politics, on the other hand there was a concern not to alienate the Brazilian government, which Germany at the time hoped could be brought to its side , or at least remain in a benevolent neutrality.

In addition there was the issue of the local Brazilian traditionalist syncretic party, the Brazilian Integralist Action. In contrast to the Nazi Party, the Integralists favoured miscegenation, and had the rural &quot;sertanejo&quot; as a noble ideal of representation of the people, which they thought was essential to Brazilian national identity; this directly conflicted with the Nazi ideology of racial purity. 

This was a problem, since the Integralists were able to attract some membership among Brazilians of German ancestry, thus competing with the Nazi organisation; moreover, until 1937, when Vargas imposed a dictatorship, the Integralists, unlike the Nazi Party, were able to participate in elections, and so there was a natural tendency of informal Nazi support for the Integralists.

Support for the Nazi regime in Germany was widespread among Brazilians of German descent, which certainly worried the Brazilian authorities. The racial and nationalist views of the Nazis easily blended into the &quot;Deutschtum&quot; ideology. However, the Nazis weren&#x27;t able to capitalise this into a really strong membership, and their local actions, such as proposed boycotts, were resisted by most of the population of German ancestry.

In fact, the fears of the Brazilian authorities regarding the expansion of Nazism in Brazil seem exaggerated in retrospect; however, it should be taken into consideration that in 1938 Germany annexed Austria, and in 1939 it dismembered, then also annexed Czechoslovakia, and that the local sections of the Nazi Party were fully involved in these actions; manipulation of German minorities also played an important role in the internal politics of Poland (Danzig) and Lithuania (Memel). So, while exaggerated, the Brazilian government&#x27;s worries seem to a certain extent justifiable.

From Rolf Hoffmann&#x27;s archive, roll 29, frames 26.600–656, mentioned by Alton Frye in &quot;Nazi Germany and the American Hemisphere, 1933–1941&quot;, p. 101–102, the Brazilian diplomat Sérgio Corrêa da Costa, in the book &#x27;The history of a secret war&#x27; (&#x27;Crônica de uma guerra secreta&#x27; in Portuguese), reveals that Hitler had planned to colonize Brazil (which several historians from the English speaking world had already shown, as well as the testimony of Rauschning, who was present when Hitler spoke of plans of colonizing Brazil).

The plan was not new. In his &quot;Gross Deutschland, die Arbeit des 20. Jahrhunderts&quot;, published in Leipzig, 1911, Tannenberg outlines the principle of partition of Central and South American between the great powers, to Germany belonging the subtropical part facing the Atlantic Ocean:

In April 1938, Vargas outlawed the Nazi Party in Brazil (the Brazilian parties themselves were outlawed in December 1937). However, in December 1937 the Nazi German Ambassador to Rio de Janeiro, Karl Ritter, was already reporting nationalising actions by the Brazilian government. At that moment, conditions were being imposed for the continued functioning of German schools. 

Ritter had a problem in that his powers as Ambassador did not enable him to interfere on behalf of Brazilian citizens of German origin. However, in February 1938 Ritter met Vargas, and demanded criticism of Germany and Nazism in the Brazilian press be gagged. As confirmed by diplomatic documents later declassified, the interest of the embassy was in the &quot;Reichsdeutschen&quot;, or German citizens, not the &quot;Deutschbrasilianer&quot;, or Brazilian citizens of German ancestry.

In April, Vargas forbade any political activity by foreigners; in May, the Integralists attempted a coup against Vargas, which further complicated relations between Brazil and Germany. Up to this moment, however, no actions were taken against cultural, religious or sports associations. Measures were intensified in 1939, when the public use of foreign languages was forbidden, including in elementary schools and religious ceremonies (harsh as this is, it is necessary to remember, as René Gertz points out, that about half of Lutheran ministers in Rio Grande do Sul were affiliated with the Nazi Party) . 

The cultural associations had to stop promoting foreign cultures. In 1942, when Brazil entered World War II, further restrictions were put in place, and their enforcement was made stricter. No effort was made to suppress the Lutheran church; the teaching of foreign languages, including German, in high schools and colleges continued, as well as their private use. 

Publicly speaking foreign languages, including German, was banned under penalty of imprisonment; this was especially enforced against the public use of German. Stores owned by Germans were ransacked. Establishments registered in foreign names had to be changed and worship in churches had to be only in Portuguese. During World War II, the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB) enlisted many Germans and people of German descent to fight alongside the Allied forces, which was difficult for many of them, considering that the soldiers were forced to fight against Germany.

There were differences in emphasis during the nationalization campaign; in particular, the &quot;interventor&quot; (unelected governor) of Rio Grande do Sul, Cordeiro de Farias, was notable for his harshness. At the time of Brazil&#x27;s declaration of war against Germany, popular riots against citizens of German origin erupted in Rio Grande do Sul, as a response to the sinking of Brazilian merchant ships by German U-boats that resulted in more than 600 deaths. When the Army repressed those riots and ensured the physical integrity of the citizens, Cordeiro de Farias offered his resignation, which was rejected, but he was soon sent to Italy as a military commander and replaced by Colonel Ernesto Dornelles, a much more moderate leader.

===Postwar developments===

Since then, the Southern Brazilian German regional culture has been in decline. Some have decried this as a tragic loss for the country while others feel that this means national progress, arguing that assimilation ultimately leads to togetherness. However, German influence can still be seen all across the southern states, be it in architecture, shops, town names or the way of life. Many German schools re-opened during the 1950s and are regarded as some of the best places to educate children.

===Education===

The Colégio Visconde de Porto Seguro, founded in 1872 as &quot;Deutsche Schule&quot; by the Germans immigrants in São Paulo, is the largest German School worldwide. In Rio de Janeiro, Germans founded their first school in 1862 (today Colégio Cruzeiro).

Aside from Colégio Visconde, Brazil has the following German international schools:
* Colégio Humboldt São Paulo.
* Deutsche Schule Rio de Janeiro.

Historic German schools:
* Escola Hygienopolis – Waldorf-Schule – in São Paulo.
* Instituto Preteologico in Sao Leopoldo.
* Rede Sinodal – a network of Lutheran schools dating back to 1924, organized by Lutheran Brazilians, mainly German Brazilians. Classes were taught in German in the early years.
The city of Blumenau has, since 2019, adopted a policy aiming to turn all of its public elementary schools in bilingual schools, where all the subjects are taught simultaneously in Portuguese and in a second language. By 2022, the city has adopted this policy in 18 schools, of which 4 now teach German as a second language (the other 14 teach either English or Brazilian Sign Language).

===Health===
Germans also founded hospital such as the Hospital Moinho de Ventos in Porto Alegre, Hospital do Amparo and Hospital Alemão (today Hospital Central da Aeronáutica) in Rio de Janeiro and Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz, Hospital Samaritano, Hospital Santa Catarina and Hospital Santa Helena in São Paulo.

===Food and beverage===

Germans introduced new types of food and beverage in Brazil or reinforced their utilizations by Brazilians. The wheat culture in Brazil arrived by German immigrants.

Kuchen, Sauerkraut (known in Portuguese as &quot;chucrute&quot;, is also used as derogatory term to designate Germans, and people of Central European origin or descent in general), Eisbein, new types of sausage and vegetables are some examples of food introduced in Brazil by the immigrants. In Curitiba, sausage are commonly known as vina, from the German &quot;Wiener&quot; (Wiener Würstchen). In Southern Brazil, Fruit preserves are known as chimia, from the German &quot;Schmier&quot;.

Chopp or Chope (from German &quot;Schoppen&quot;) in Brazilian Portuguese is the word for draught beer or just beer. Today, beer is the most consumed beverage in Brazil.
The tradition of brewing in Brazil dates back to German immigration in the early 19th century. The first breweries date from the 1830s, although the brand Bohemia is claimed to be the first Brazilian beer, with production starting in 1853 in the city of Petrópolis founded by the German-Brazilian Henrique Kremer. In 1913 there were 134 breweries in Rio Grande do Sul. Brahma was founded in 1888 in Rio de Janeiro by the Swiss immigrant Joseph Villiger. Antarctica (Companhia Antarctica Paulista) was founded in the same year by the Brazilian Joaquim Salles and the German immigrant Louis Bücher in São Paulo. In 1999 the two brands merged creating AmBev.

===Sport===
The German community founded two of the main football clubs in Brazil. The first one Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense was founded in 1903 by the German and English community in Porto Alegre. Today, the club is the most popular football club in Southern Brazil. In 1909, Coritiba Foot Ball Club was founded by the German population in Curitiba. The club nickname is &quot;White-Thigh&quot; due to the presence of German Brazilians among its first players.

Other clubs were founded in other cities as Sociedade Germania in Rio de Janeiro founded in 1821. In São Paulo, Esporte Clube Pinheiros was founded on 7 September 1899 by German immigrants as Sport Club Germânia. Germânia is the fourth oldest football club of Brazil and was part of the very first interclub match of the country. During the course of World War II the club abandoned references to its German origin and in 1941 was renamed to Pinheiros. São Paulo FC also have connections with the German community after merging, during the World War II, with the former Associação Alemã de Esportes (Deutscher SC). The club has 12 international titles.

Alisson Becker is the famous German Brazilian goalkeeper, who plays for Liverpool and Brazil national football team.

Eric Leme Walther Brazil&#x27;s first Olympic Bobsleigh athlete and founder of the Brazilian Ice Sports Federation (Brasilianischer Eissportverband).

==Number of German Brazilians and ethnicity==
In the southern states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, Germans were 22.34% and 19.3% respectively of the population in the 1940s and 6.9% for Paraná. Only in the state of Rio Grande do Sul there are approximately between 2.5 million (or even a third of its population) German descent living there.

The percentages are higher in some cities. For example, in the town of Pomerode, Santa Catarina, 90% of the population are Brazilians of German descent, and the main local language is an East Pomeranian dialect. It is considered the most &quot;German&quot; city in Brazil. Many towns in Southern Brazil have a majority of German-descent citizens.

Sometimes, Germans surnames were adapted or changed in Brazil to a more &quot;understandable&quot; writing in Portuguese since many were incomprehensible to Brazilians.

===The Lins family===

Two of the first Germans that arrived in Brazil were the cousins Sebald Linz von Dorndorf and Christoph Linz (or Sebald Lins von Dorndorf and Christoph Lins) who arrived in Brazil in 1570 as landowners. At the time they arrived, they married into the Luso-Brazilian nobility living there and changed their names to Portuguese names and surnames of Portuguese writing conventions, respectively, Cibaldo Lins and Cristovão Lins, founding the Lins family in Brazil. The surname is original from the surrounding areas around Linz (Austria). The Brazilian family comes from the branch from Ulm (Germany).

<doc id="1043875" wikidata="Q719028" url="?curid=1043875" title="Bombax">
<text>Bombax is a genus of mainly tropical trees in the mallow family. They are native to western Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the subtropical regions of East Asia and northern Australia. It is distinguished from the genus &quot;Ceiba&quot;, which has whiter flowers.

Common names for the genus include silk cotton tree, simal, red cotton tree, kapok, and simply bombax. Currently four species are recognised, although many plants have been placed in the genus that were later moved.

The genus is best known for the species &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;, which is widely cultivated throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. It is native to southern and eastern Asia and northern Australia.

&quot;Bombax&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the leaf-miner &quot;Bucculatrix crateracma&quot; which feeds exclusively on &quot;Bombax ceiba&quot;.

The tree appears on the flag of Equatorial Guinea.

The tree fibers are 100% cellulose, able to float, impervious to water, and have a low thermal conductivity. Called Kapok in Asia, the fibers are mainly used for insulation in sleeping bags and life preservers. The fibers are also used as stuffing for pillows and mattresses.

==Description==
&quot;Bombax&quot; species are among the largest trees in their regions, reaching 30 to 40 metres in height and up to three metres in trunk diameter. The leaves are compound with entire margins and are deciduous, being shed in the dry-season. They measure 30 to 50 cm across and are palmate in shape with five to nine leaflets. The calyx is deciduous, meaning it does not persist on the fruits. They bear five to ten cm long red flowers between January and March while the tree is still leafless. The stamens are present in bundles in two whorls, while the staminal column lacks lobes. The ovary matures into a husk containing seeds covered by a fibre similar to that of the kapok (&quot;Ceiba pentandra&quot;) and to cotton, though with shorter fibres than cotton, that does not lend itself to spinning, making it unusable as a textile product.

==Species==

&quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; currently (March 2024) includes:
# &quot;Bombax albidum&quot; 
# &quot;Bombax anceps&quot; (syn. &quot;B. kerrii&quot; &amp; &quot;B. valetonii&quot;)

<text>Matt Behncke (born February 20, 1980) is an American former professional soccer player and attorney. He last played for Real Salt Lake of Major League Soccer (MLS). He is now a partner with the law firm of Susman Godfrey.

==Soccer career==
Behncke grew up in Williamsburg, Virginia playing his youth soccer with the Williamsburg Wizards. Before joining MLS, Behncke played four years of college soccer for Princeton University. In 1998, his first year at Princeton, Behncke was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year. In his sophomore year, he was a second team All-Ivy selection, while leading the Tigers to an Ivy League title. In both his junior and senior seasons, Behncke was named first team All-Ivy. In 2002, Behncke was the sole recipient of the William Winston Roper award, the highest male student-athlete award at Princeton. The award is given annually to a Princeton senior of high scholastic rank, outstanding sportsmanship, and general athletic ability.

Upon graduating, Behncke was drafted 18th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by the Dallas Burn. In his first year with Dallas, Behncke did not make much of an impact, playing only 190 minutes. In his second year, however, Behncke developed into a useful utility player for the Burn, capable of playing adequately at either central defense or left fullback. Behncke saw an increased role in 2004, starting almost half of the Burn&#x27;s games.

However, after the 2004 season, he was selected by Real Salt Lake in the Expansion Draft. Following the 2005 season, Behncke was waived and retired from professional soccer to attend law school at the University of Texas School of Law. In 2006, he played for the Williamsburg Legacy, his hometown club, in the fourth division Premier Development League, prior to beginning school in Austin.

==Legal career==
While attending law school at the University of Texas School of Law, Behncke was selected as the chief articles editor of the &quot;Texas Law Review&quot;.

After law school, Behncke served as a law clerk to John M. Rogers of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On January 1, 2017, Behncke was elected to the partnership of Susman Godfrey L.L.P. Behncke is based out of the Houston, Texas office.

<doc id="1043883" wikidata="Q715094" url="?curid=1043883" title="Arturo Álvarez (footballer, born 1985)">
<text>José Arturo Álvarez Hernández (born June 28, 1985) is a former professional footballer who played as a winger and forward. Born in the United States, he played for the El Salvador national team.

==Career==
===Professional===
Álvarez did not play college soccer; instead, he joined MLS in 2003, signing a Project-40 contract, and was selected thirteenth overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the San Jose Earthquakes. In his first year, Álvarez scored his first MLS goal on June 14, 2003, against FC Dallas but would go on to get limited playing time. However, in January 2005 Álvarez was traded by San Jose with Richard Mulrooney and the #6 and #29 picks in the 2005 MLS SuperDraft to FC Dallas in exchange for Brad Davis, cash, and the #4 pick in the 2005 SuperDraft.

During the 2007 MLS Cup Playoffs, in the second leg of FC Dallas&#x27; Conference semifinal match with the Houston Dynamo, Álvarez was sent off for &quot;violent conduct&quot; after he kneed Brad Davis in the groin while out of bounds in the forty-seventh minute. Dallas went on to lose the tie 4–1, and the match 4–2 on aggregate.
Álvarez was traded to the new San Jose Earthquakes in July 2008 for allocation money and their first round draft pick in the 2009 MLS SuperDraft. In his debut, he scored the first goal of the match against the Los Angeles Galaxy in a match that ended 3–2. On November 24, 2010, Álvarez was selected in the tenth round of the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft by Portland Timbers but was immediately traded to Real Salt Lake for a 2nd round 2011 MLS SuperDraft pick.

The Salvadoran American made his debut with Real Salt Lake on March 15, 2011, when he entered in the 88th minuteof the first leg of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League semifinals against Saprissa.
After the 2011 season, Real Salt Lake did not re-sign Álvarez. He opted to participate in the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft and was selected by Chivas USA on December 5, 2011. However, he instead signed a two-year contract with Portuguese first division club Paços de Ferreira. On March 18, 2012, he scored his first goal with his new team against Académica

On February 7, 2013, he was loaned to Hungarian club Videoton. He played well enough with the team that in June 2013 he signed a two-year contract to stay in Hungary. He was released in 2015.

On March 3, 2016, after a successful preseason trial with the club, Álvarez was signed by Chicago Fire to a one-year deal with one year option.

On December 10, 2017, Álvarez was traded by Chicago to his home town club, the Houston Dynamo, in exchange for a second-round selection in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft. Álvarez was mainly used as a sub and helped the Dynamo win the 2018 US Open Cup. He left the club again at the end of 2018.

On March 1, 2019, Álvarez announced his retirement from playing professional soccer.

===International===

====United States====
Álvarez represented the United States in various youth levels – U-17, U-18, and U-20. He also participated in various matches and training camps with the U-23 team.

====El Salvador====
Though Álvarez played on various United States national squads at the youth level, he was never called up to the senior national team. Being of Salvadoran descent, Álvarez was invited to play for the El Salvador national team by coach Carlos de los Cobos. On August 12, 2009, Álvarez made his debut for El Salvador in a World Cup qualifier against Trinidad and Tobago. On September 5, 2009, Álvarez started in a World Cup qualifier against his home country at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah. El Salvador fell, 2–1. On September 9, 2009, Álvarez played his first home game in Estadio Cuscatlán, in San Salvador, El Salvador against Costa Rica. El Salvador was victorious 1–0.

<doc id="1043889" wikidata="Q12656487" url="?curid=1043889" title="Hymenolepiasis">
<text>Hymenolepiasis is infestation by one of two species of tapeworm: &quot;Hymenolepis nana&quot; or &quot;H. diminuta&quot;. Alternative names are dwarf tapeworm infection and rat tapeworm infection. The disease is a type of helminthiasis which is classified as a neglected tropical disease.

==Symptoms and signs==
Hymenolepiasis does not always have symptoms, but they usually are described as abdominal pain, loss of appetite, itching around the anus, irritability, and diarrhea. However, in one study of 25 patients conducted in Peru, successful treatment of the infection made no significant difference to symptoms. Some authorities report that heavily infected cases are more likely to be symptomatic.

Symptoms in humans are due to allergic responses or systematic toxaemia caused by waste products of the tapeworm. Light infections are usually symptomless, whereas infection with more than 2000 worms can cause enteritis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, restlessness, irritability, restless sleep, and anal and nasal pruritus. Rare symptoms include increased appetite, vomiting, nausea, bloody diarrhea, hives, extremity pain, headache, dizziness, and behavioral disturbances. Occasionally, epileptic seizures occur in infected children.

Examination of the stool for eggs and parasites confirms the diagnosis. The eggs and proglottids of &quot;H. nana&quot; are smaller than &quot;H. diminuta.&quot; Proglottids of both are relatively wide and have three testes. Identifying the parasites to the species level is often unnecessary from a medical perspective, as the treatment is the same for both.

===Complications===
Abdominal discomfort and, in case of prolonged diarrhea, dehydration are possible complications.

In 2015 an unusual complication was noted in a man whose immune system had been compromised by HIV. He developed multiple tumors of malignant cell nests within his body that had originated from a tapeworm in his intestines.

==Causes==

&quot;Hymenolepis&quot; worms live in the intestines of rats and are common in warm climates, and are generally found in the feces of rats, which are consumed by their secondary hosts—beetles. The worms mature into a life form referred to as a &quot;cysticercoid&quot; in the insect; in &quot;H. nana,&quot; the insect is always a beetle.
Humans and other animals become infected when they intentionally or unintentionally eat material contaminated by insects. In an infected person, it is possible for the worm&#x27;s entire lifecycle to be completed in the bowel, so infection can persist for years if left untreated.
&quot;H. nana&quot; infections are much more common than &quot;H. diminuta&quot; infections in humans because, in addition to being spread by insects, the disease can be spread directly from person to person by eggs in feces. When this happens, &quot;H. nana&quot; oncosphere larvae encyst in the intestinal wall and develop into cysticercoids and then adults. These infections were previously common in the southeastern USA, and have been described in crowded environments and individuals confined to institutions. However, the disease occurs throughout the world. &quot;H. nana&quot; infections can grow worse over time because, unlike in most tapeworms, &quot;H. nana&quot; eggs can hatch and develop without ever leaving the definitive host.

==&quot;H. diminuta&quot;==
The risk of human infection from &quot;H. diminuta&quot; is very low, since its main host is the rat. Also known as the rat tapeworm, &quot;H. diminuta&quot; adults live and mate in the bowels of rats. Eggs of &quot;H. diminuta&quot; are excreted by the rats in droppings, which are frequently consumed by beetles. Once inside the beetle, the eggs mature into a cysticercoid. The juvenile tapeworms claw their way out of the beetle gut into the circulatory system by means of their three pairs of hooks. There, they wait for a rat to ingest the host beetle, where they mature to adult form, lay eggs, and restart the entire cycle.

===Beetle manipulation===
&quot;H. diminuta&quot; has an effective mechanism for interspecies transfection. Beetles prefer to ingest rat droppings infected with tapeworm eggs, because of their odor. It is not known if the odor is produced specifically by the eggs or the droppings. &quot;H. diminuta&quot; also sterilizes its beetle host, if female. This is so the beetle does not waste energy in its reproductive system, allowing &quot;H. diminuta&quot; to further exploit the beetle&#x27;s metabolic resources.

==&quot;H. nana&quot;==
&quot;H. nana&quot; is a tapeworm, belonging to the class Cestoidea, phylum Platyhelminthes.
It consists of a linear series of sets of reproductive organs of both sexes; each set is referred to as a genitaluim and the area around it is a proglottid. New proglottids are continuously differentiated near the anterior end in a process called strobilation. Each segment moves toward the posterior end as a new one takes its place and, during the process, becomes sexually mature. The proglottid can copulate with itself, with others in the strobilla, or with those in other worms. When the segment reaches the end of its strobila, it disintegrates &quot;en route&quot;, releasing eggs in a process called apolysis.

===Lifecycle===
&quot;H. nana&quot; is the only cestode capable of completing its lifecycle without an intermediate host. It can, however, pass through an intermediate host, as well. The most common intermediate hosts for &quot;H. nana&quot; are arthropods (e.g. flour beetles). When an egg is ingested by the definitive host, it hatches and releases a six-hook larva called the oncosphere (hexacanth) which penetrates the villi of the small intestine and develops into a cysticercoid.

===Infection===
Transmission of &quot;H.nana&quot; occurs by the fecal-oral route. It also occurs by accidental ingestion of an insect containing the cysticercoid.

=== Screening for activity against &quot;H. nana&quot; ===

Mouse models can be used to study &quot;H. nana&quot; because the human-type infection is easily maintained in mice, the armed scolex is similar to other pathogenic tapeworms, and it corresponds to other tapeworms in its sensitivity to standard anthelmintics. The method is as follows:

# Mature worms are collected from infected mice.
# Terminal gravid proglottids are removed, crushed under cover slips, and eggs are removed.
# Eggs containing hooklets (mature) are counted.
# stock solution containing ~200 eggs given to each mouse.
# Adult worms develop in 15–17 days.
# The test drug is given orally; mice are necropsied on the third day after treatment.
# A standard drug is given.
# The intestines are examined under a dissecting microscope for worms or scolices.
# The response is measured by the number mice cleared.

== Pathology ==

&quot;H. nana&quot; lodges itself in the intestines and absorbs nutrients from the intestinal lumen. In human adults, the tapeworm is more of a nuisance than a health problem, but in small children, many &quot;H. nana&quot; worms can be dangerous. Usually, the larvae of this tapeworm cause the most problem in children; they burrow into the walls of the intestine, and if enough tapeworms are present in the child, severe damage can be inflicted. This is done by absorbing all the nutrients from the food the child eats. Usually, a single tapeworm will not cause health issues. &quot;H. nana&quot; usually will not cause deaths unless in extreme circumstances and usually in young children or in people who have weakened immune systems. In some parts of the world, individuals who are heavily infected are a result of internal autoinfection.

==Prevention==
Good hygiene, public health and sanitation programs, and elimination of infected rats help to prevent the spread of hymenolepiasis. Preventing fecal contamination of food and water in institutions and crowded areas is of primary importance. General sanitation and rodent and insect control (especially control of fleas and grain insects) are also essential for prevention of &quot;H. nana&quot; infection.

== Treatment ==

The two drugs that have been well-described for the treatment of hymenolepiasis are praziquantel and niclosamide. Praziquantel, which is parasiticidal in a single dose for all the stages of the parasite, is the drug of choice because it acts very rapidly against &quot;H. nana&quot;. Although structurally unrelated to other anthelminthics, it kills both adult worms and larvae. &quot;In vitro&quot;, the drug produces vacuolization and disruption of the tegument in the neck of the worms, but not in more posterior portions of the strobila. Praziquantel is well absorbed when taken orally, and it undergoes first-pass metabolism and 80% of the dose is excreted as metabolites in urine within 24 hours.
Repeated treatment is required for &quot;H. nana&quot; at an interval of 7–10 days.

Praziquantel as a single dose (25 mg/kg) is the current treatment of choice for hymenolepiasis and has an efficacy of 96%. Single-dose albendazole (400 mg) is also very efficacious (&gt;95%).

A three-day course of nitazoxanide is 75–93% efficacious. The dose is 1 g daily for adults and children over 12; 400 mg daily for children aged 4 to 11 years; and 200 mg daily for children aged 3 years or younger.

==Prognosis==
Cure rates are extremely good with modern treatments, but successful cure results may be of no symptomatic benefit to patients.

<doc id="1043891" wikidata="Q3280956" url="?curid=1043891" title="Singles (The Smiths album)">
<text>Singles is the seventh compilation album by the English rock band the Smiths, pitched as a compilation of previously issued singles. It was released in February 1995 by the new owner of their back catalogue, WEA (Sire Records in the United States). Its highest British chart position was #5; it did not chart in the United States. &quot;Blender&quot; magazine listed the album among the &quot;500 CDs You Must Own&quot; on their website.

==Background==

WEA (now the Warner Music Group) acquired the entire Smiths back catalogue in early 1992. After re-releasing all of The Smiths&#x27; eight original albums (the four studio albums, the &quot;Rank&quot; live album and the three compilation albums issued while the band were still active) and releasing a newly-assembled two-volume best of compilation album (&quot;Best I&quot; and &quot;Best II&quot;) in 1992, they decided to celebrate The Smiths&#x27; reputation as a &quot;singles band&quot; by issuing a collection of the band&#x27;s singles in 1995. Only the singles released in the UK were included.

Despite the album&#x27;s title, the &quot;Singles&quot; versions of &quot;Hand in Glove&quot;, &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot; and &quot;Ask&quot; were not the original single mixes. Similarly, &quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot;, &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;, &quot;That Joke Isn&#x27;t Funny Anymore&quot; and &quot;Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me&quot; were the full-length album versions, that are on the original 12&quot; singles, as opposed to the original single edits.

===Cover===
The cover features previously unused artwork designed by Morrissey, featuring singer and actress Diana Dors in a still from the 1956 film &quot;Yield to the Night&quot;.

==Spin-off singles==
WEA decided to promote the album in the UK by re-releasing the &quot;Ask&quot; single with its two original B-sides, &quot;Cemetry Gates&quot; and &quot;Golden Lights&quot;. The single charted at #62. In the United States, Sire decided to release &quot;Sweet and Tender Hooligan&quot;, a single of rarities, to promote the album, with a newly designed sleeve by Morrissey. It failed to chart.

==Track listing==
==Personnel==
===The Smiths===
* Mike Joyce – drums
* Johnny Marr – guitars, keyboards, harmonica, synthesized saxophone, string and flute arrangements
