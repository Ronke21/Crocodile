<text>Lough Ree (), translated to English as &quot;King&#x27;s Lake&quot; or &quot;King Lake&quot;, is a lake in the midlands of Ireland, the second of the three major lakes on the River Shannon. Lough Ree is the second largest lake on the Shannon after Lough Derg. The other two major lakes are Lough Allen to the north, and Lough Derg to the south. There are also several minor lakes along the length of the river. The lake serves as a border between the counties of Longford and Westmeath (both in the province of Leinster) on the eastern side and County Roscommon in the province of Connacht on the western side. The lake is popular for fishing and boating. The lake supports a small commercial eel fishery and is locally famous for its &quot;eels on wheels&quot; truck. The town of Athlone is situated at the southern end of the lake, and has a harbour for boats going out on the lake. The small town of Lanesboro is at the northern end of the lake.

The island of Inchcleraun (&quot;Inis Cloithreann&quot;) in the northern part of the lake is the site of a monastery founded in the early Christian era and contains the remains of several ancient churches. In Irish legends, it was on this island that Queen Maeve was killed. The Viking Turgesius controlled a ringfort on the shores until his death by drowning in Lough Owel.

Families lived on some of the islands in Lough Ree including Inchcleraun (Walsh &amp; Farrell), The Black Islands (Hanly &amp; O&#x27;Hara), Inchmore (Tiernan, Quigley, Nolan &amp; Keefe), Hare Island (Duffy), Inchbofin (Connell), Inch Turk (Ganly, Slevin &amp; Walsh) and Inchenagh (Shea, Killian &amp; Connaughton) until the 1950s, when they were rehoused ashore. Like several other Irish loughs, Lough Ree has been the scene of claimed sightings of a lake monster over the years.

The geographical centre of Ireland was previously calculated to be in the townland of Carnagh East, County Roscommon on the western shore of Lough Ree, opposite the Cribby Islands Also Hodson pillar which is located on an island on the lake is said to be the most central point in Ireland. However, in 2022 Ordnance Survey Ireland did a new calculation which put the centre near Castletown Geoghegan in County Westmeath.

==Ecology==
Lough Ree has been designated a Special Area of Conservation. The main habitat, by area, is the lake itself, but there are other habitats including bog.

Lough Ree site has been designated a Special Protection Area on the basis of its migratory waterfowl, with nationally important numbers of &quot;Tachybaptus ruficollis&quot;.
It is also an Important Bird Area.

In 2021, invasive quagga mussels were discovered in the lake and in Lough Derg by a research team from UCD.

== Events ==
Jim O&#x27;Connor was the first person to solo swim the length of Lough Ree in 2012. The swim lasted 13 hours and 34 minutes, a mean speed of . O&#x27;Connor completed this swim to raise funds for South Westmeath Hospice.

==Human history==
9th century Viking attacks climaxed in 845 in Ireland and they built a fortified base on Lough Ree.

<doc id="1053506" wikidata="Q6030325" url="?curid=1053506" title="Influx of disease in the Caribbean">
<text>The first European contact in 1492 started an influx of communicable diseases into the Caribbean. Diseases originating in the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) came to the New World (the Americas) for the first time, resulting in demographic and sociopolitical changes due to the Columbian Exchange from the late 15th century onwards. The Indigenous peoples of the Americas had little immunity to the predominantly Old World diseases, resulting in significant loss of life and contributing to their enslavement and exploitation perpetrated by the European colonists. Waves of enslaved Africans were brought to replace the dwindling Indigenous populations, solidifying the position of disease in triangular trade.

== Infectious diseases ==

Before the first wave of European colonization, the Indigenous peoples of the Americas and the Caribbean are thought to have lived with infrequent epidemic diseases, brought about by limited contact between tribes. This left them socially and biologically unprepared when the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus and his crew introduced several infectious diseases, including typhus, smallpox, influenza, whooping cough, and measles following his 1492 voyage to the Americas. The Old World diseases spread from the carriers to the Indigenous populations, who had no immunity, leading to more serious cases and higher mortality. Because the Indigenous societies of the Americas were not used to the diseases as European nations were at the time, there was no system in place to care for the sick.

Smallpox is among the most notable of diseases in the Columbian Exchange due to the high number of deaths and impact on life for Indigenous societies. Smallpox first broke out in the Americas on the island of Hispaniola in 1518. The disease was carried over from Europe, where it had been endemic for over seven hundred years. Like the other diseases introduced in the time period, the Europeans were familiar with the treatment of the disease and had some natural immunity, which reduced mortality and facilitated quicker recovery. The Taíno people, who inhabited Hispaniola, had no natural smallpox immunity and were unfamiliar with treating epidemic disease.

In 1493, the first recorded influenza epidemic to strike the Americas occurred on the island of Hispaniola in the northern Spanish settlement of Isabela. The virus was introduced to the Isle of Santo Domingo by the Cristóbal Cólon, which docked at La Isabela on 10 December 1493, carrying about 2,000 Spanish passengers. Despite the general poor health of the colony, Columbus returned in 1494 and found that the Native American population had been affected by disease even more catastrophically than Isabela&#x27;s first settlers were. By 1506, only a third of the native population remained. The Taíno population before European contact is estimated to have been between 60,000 and 8 million people, and the entire nation was virtually extinct 50 years after contact, which has primarily been attributed to the infectious diseases.

After the first European contact, social disruption and epidemic diseases led to a decline in the Amerindian population. Because the Indigenous societies, including the Taínos, were unfamiliar with the diseases, they were not prepared to deal with the social consequences. The high number of people incapacitated by the disease disrupted the normal cycles of agriculture and hunting that sustained the Native American populations. This led to increased dependence on the Europeans, and reduced capacity to resist the European invasion. The eventual enslavement of the Taíno people by the Europeans compounded the effects of the epidemics in the downfall of the Indigenous societies.

== Impact of the transatlantic slave trade ==

As the population of enslaved Indigenous peoples fell due to disease and abuse, the Spanish and Portuguese &quot;conquistadors&quot; began to import enslaved workers from Africa in 1505. Until 1800 the population rose as slaves arrived from West Africa. Because there was already an established European colonial presence in Africa at the time, the enslaved Africans were less vulnerable to disease than the Taíno people on Hispaniola. However, they came carrying their own diseases, including malaria. At the time, malaria was endemic both in Europe and Africa, though more prevalent in the latter continent. The climate of the Caribbean was hospitable to mosquitoes of the genus &quot;Anopheles&quot;, which acts as a vector for the disease and allowed it to spread. Many of the African-born enslaved people had genetic protections against malaria that Indigenous enslaved people did not. As malaria, smallpox, and other diseases spread the Indigenous populations continued to fall, which increased the motivation for the Spanish and Portuguese colonists to continue to import more enslaved workers from Africa. This enslaved people worked in mining and agriculture, driving the development of triangular trade.

<text>Robert Horatio Walpole, 10th Baron Walpole of Walpole, 8th Baron Walpole of Wolterton, (8 December 1938 – 8 May 2021), was a British politician who, as an excepted hereditary peer, was a member of the House of Lords until his retirement in 2017.

==Ancestors==
Walpole was descended from Horatio Walpole, 1st Baron Walpole (of Wolterton), a younger brother of Sir Robert Walpole, the first British Prime Minister. He was the 10th and 8th Baron Walpole (of two different creations). His ancestors include Sir Robert Walpole&#x27;s father Colonel Robert Walpole (1650–1700).

<text>MechCommander is a real-time tactics video game based on FASA&#x27;s &quot;BattleTech&quot;/&quot;MechWarrior&quot; franchise, developed by FASA Interactive and distributed by MicroProse in 1998. An expansion pack, &quot;Desperate Measures&quot;, was released in 1999.

==Gameplay==
Players assume the role of the commander of Zulu company from the Federated Commonwealth&#x27;s First Davion Guards, a member of the Inner Sphere (IS). The planet Port Arthur must be taken back from the Clan Smoke Jaguar. The game&#x27;s campaign progresses through 30 different missions broken into 5 operations with 6 missions apiece. Each mission consists of a number of objectives which may include destroying enemy units, capturing or defending enemy units, protecting friendly units, and capturing and defending bases. Some missions must be completed within a certain time limit.

In each mission, players controls a limited number of units which are either mechs or support vehicles. This control is through a simulated aerial viewscreen above the battlefield. Each mission restricts both the combined tonnage and the number of units allowed. Briefings are supplied prior to the start of the mission which lists the objectives and other relevant information. A wide range of strategies and tactics may be used on any given mission, and players can customize their forces for each one.

In between missions players can repair and refit mechs, assign mechwarriors to each mech and purchase mechs, vehicles, mechwarriors, and components. These items are purchased with Resource Points which are awarded for completing previous mission objectives. Few mechs, vehicles, mech pilots, and components can be purchased at the beginning of the campaign, but more become available as the game progresses. However, only IS technology can be purchased. Clan technology such as weaponry and new mechs must be salvaged from the battlefield. Salvaging equipment is an important feature of the game.

Each mech is piloted by a mechwarrior. Pilots increase in skill as they use them during missions. The more missions and kills a particular pilot has, the more experienced and valuable he or she becomes. If a pilot gains enough experience, he or she will increase in rank. The four ranks from least to greatest are &quot;green&quot;, &quot;regular&quot;, &quot;veteran&quot;, and &quot;elite&quot;. Rank determines how effective a pilot is in a certain class of mechs (light, medium, heavy, or assault).

==&quot;MechCommander: Desperate Measures&quot;==
&quot;MechCommander: Desperate Measures&quot; is an expansion pack that was released in 1999. Set immediately after the liberation of Port Arthur, the player once again assumes command of Zulu company in a campaign to liberate the desolate planet Cermak in the Periphery, taken by a renegade Smoke Jaguar, Star Colonel Marcus Kotare (a character that was featured briefly in &quot;MechWarrior 2: Mercenaries&quot;), for an unknown reason that is revealed later in game. Once again, the player starts with inferior Inner Sphere mechs (pilots and mechs from original campaign cannot be exported into expansion), though both mechs and pilots are better than in the start of the original campaign. The expansion features a total of three campaigns. Aside from the missions, the expansion also includes a new soundtrack, new landscapes along with redesigned and new buildings, new weapons, three new mechs for each side—Stiletto, Bushwacker, and Mauler for IS and Shadow Cat, Nova Cat and Turkina for the Clan, and new vehicles including Alacorn, Pilum and Regulator tanks, as well as ammo trucks that also doubled as mobile bombs and Centipede scout vehicles. &quot;Desperate Measures&quot; also acted as testbed for the concept of custom NPC mechs that had their own names (like &quot;Kotare&#x27;s Turkina&quot;), weapon configurations and overall superiority to the standard modifications. This idea was carried on to, and greatly improved in, &quot;MechCommander 2&quot;. A compilation called &quot;MechCommander Gold&quot; was released in 1999 that includes the base game and the expansion.

==Reception==
The game received favorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. &quot;Next Generation&quot; called it &quot;a good first effort, and FASA is to be commended for trying something different in the overcrowded field of RTS games. Unfortunately, it lacks polish, and the repetition of each mission drags down the fun factor.&quot;

The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated the game for &quot;PC Strategy Game of the Year&quot; at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, although it ultimately lost to &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Alpha Centauri&quot;. The game was a runner-up for &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot;″ 1998 &quot;Real-Time Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;StarCraft&quot;. The staff called the former game &quot;great&quot;, but argued that &quot;only &quot;StarCraft&quot; was stellar&quot;.

Due to its science fiction setting, &quot;MechCommander&quot; received an overt recommendation from The Sci-Fi Channel (now SyFy), to the point of Sci-Fi&#x27;s logo being present on the box art. Along with &quot;&quot;, it was one of the few games to ever be officially recommended by Sci-Fi.

<doc id="1053521" wikidata="Q657185" url="?curid=1053521" title="So (album)">
<text>So is the fifth studio album by English singer-songwriter Peter Gabriel, released on 19 May 1986 by Charisma Records and Virgin Records. After working on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Birdy&quot; (1984), producer Daniel Lanois was invited to remain at Gabriel&#x27;s Somerset home during 1985 to work on his next solo project. Initial sessions for &quot;So&quot; consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes, although these grew to include a number of percussionists.

Although Gabriel continued to use the pioneering Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer, songs from these sessions were less experimental than his previous material. Nevertheless, Gabriel drew on various musical influences, fusing pop, soul, and art rock with elements of traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian styles. It is Gabriel&#x27;s first non-eponymous album, &quot;So&quot; representing an &quot;anti-title&quot; that resulted from label pressure to &quot;properly&quot; market his music. Gabriel toured &quot;So&quot; on the This Way Up tour (1986–1987), with some songs performed at human rights and charity concerts during this period.

Often considered his best and most accessible album, &quot;So&quot; was an immediate commercial success and transformed Gabriel from a cult artist into a mainstream star, becoming his best-selling solo release. It has been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, was promoted with an innovative animated music video and achieved particular success, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and subsequently winning a record of nine MTV Video Music Awards. It was followed by four further singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; (a duet with Kate Bush), &quot;Big Time&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Red Rain&quot;.

The album received positive reviews from most critics, who praised its songwriting, melodies and fusion of genres, although some retrospective reviews have criticised its overt commercialism and 1980s production sounds. &quot;So&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987 but lost to Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot;. It has appeared in lists of the best albums of the 1980s, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the album in their 2003 and 2020 editions of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2000 it was voted number 82 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. &quot;So&quot; was remastered in 2002, partially re-recorded for Gabriel&#x27;s 2011 orchestral project &quot;New Blood&quot; and issued as a box set in 2012.

==Recording==

Since 1978, Gabriel had composed his music at Ashcombe House, including his album &quot;Security&quot; (1982) and the &quot;Birdy&quot; soundtrack (1984). He had an inexpensive studio in the adjacent barn consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. Preparing for &quot;So&quot;, Gabriel considered Bill Laswell and Chic&#x27;s Nile Rodgers as potential producers. He eventually asked his &quot;Birdy&quot; collaborator Daniel Lanois to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further.

Work on the album began in earnest in February 1985, with &quot;We Do What We&#x27;re Told (Milgram&#x27;s 37)&quot; as the first song. Some of the initial sessions consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes playing together: Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had &quot;a nice starting point [as] in that kind of scenario, it&#x27;s not a good idea to have a lot of people around because you get nervous that you&#x27;re wasting other people&#x27;s time&quot;. Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as the &quot;Three Stooges&quot;. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a &quot;turning up for work humour&quot;. As sessions grew, engineer/mixer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Manu Katché became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Jerry Marotta and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.

The studio&#x27;s basic equipment consisted of &quot;two analog 24-track machines, a Studer A80, and a Studer A80 shell that had been modified by a local electronics wizard, with its own audio cards and transport controls&quot;. To record vocals a Neumann U47 tube microphone and a Decca compressor were used without equalization. All of &quot;So&quot;″s songs were made in a similar format. Gabriel would record demo parts on a modified &quot;B machine&quot; - using mainly a Yamaha piano and Prophet-5 over a Linn 9000 drum beat - and play this to the band. During rehearsals, the band would listen to the B machine through headphones and record their output onto the &quot;A machine&quot;; parts of Gabriel&#x27;s demo would also be transferred to the A machine at this stage. Subsequent takes of the song were then put onto the B machine in order for the band to hear what they had played with the demo, as well as the song&#x27;s new and old takes.

Other equipment included the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; Fairlight CMI synthesizer, which Gabriel said in an interview for &quot;Billboard&quot; meant &quot;more human imagination is involved&quot;. He added, &quot;the creative decision-making process has become more important than technique. You have a wider range of tools, a wider range of decisions&quot;. Although remaining continually inspired to produce new music, he often struggled to write lyrics and would procrastinate. His proclivity to being dissatisfied with them required Killen to isolate certain vocal performances as the master track, in order to keep other tracks available so new lyrics could be edited in. Lanois took adverse measures to encourage his writing, such as destroying his much-used telephone in the nearby woods and, on one occasion, nailed the studio door shut to lock him inside.

Towards the end of recording, Gabriel became &quot;obsessed&quot; with the track listing and created an audio cassette of all the song&#x27;s beginnings and ends to hear how the sounds blended together. He wanted to have &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; as the final track, but its prominent bassline meant it had to be placed earlier on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate. With later CD releases, this restriction was removed and the track was placed at the end of the album. &quot;So&quot; was completed in February 1986 and cost £200,000 to make. It was overdubbed at Power Station Studios in New York (as well as all horn section parts having been recorded there), despite Gabriel considering sending it via a computer-telephone set up, reasoning, &quot;that&#x27;s a lot of information to send via phone. Isn&#x27;t it amazing though? You can send a song idea around the world to musicians then beam parts back by satellite&quot;. It was mastered by Ian Cooper in mid-February 1986 at London&#x27;s Townhouse Studios.

==Composition==
&quot;So&quot; has been described as Gabriel&#x27;s most commercially accessible and least experimental album, one that features pop songs and incorporates art pop and progressive pop throughout. Like his previous albums, its basis is in art rock, although on &quot;So&quot;, Gabriel develops an increased focus on melody and combines this with elements of soul and African music. &quot;With a song like &quot;(the previous album&#x27;s)&quot; &#x27;The Rhythm of the Heat&#x27; or &#x27;The Family and the Fishing Net&#x27;, if I were to strum that along on a guitar or piano, the song might not work very well ... whereas more of the things on this album do work just as lyric, melody and chords in a more traditional sense.&quot; Gabriel began with around 30 compositional ideas and 20 recorded tracks, which he later winnowed down to twelve songs that were &quot;within finishing distance&quot;.

The songs are highly influenced by traditional world music, particularly African and Brazilian music, with Gabriel incorporating rhythms and drum beats from these regions. In a 2011 interview for &quot;Uncut&quot;, Gabriel said, &quot;I&#x27;d had my fill of instrumental experimenting for a while, and I wanted to write proper pop songs, albeit on my own terms.&quot; Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes that Gabriel &quot;doesn&#x27;t just add on African drums or Indian violin to ordinary songs; they are part of the foundation.&quot; Chris Roberts of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; also notes that the album &quot;[takes] the Fairlight synth and [adds] a palatable dash of world music to art pop.&quot; Daniel Lanois&#x27; production was noted as textured, replete with ambient details and &quot;immaculate warmth giving each note room to breathe, its textures lavish (in the preferred style of the time) without being sterile&quot;.

===Side one===

Gabriel wanted the album to &quot;crash open at the front&quot;. Despite disliking &quot;metal&quot; percussion instruments, he was persuaded by Lanois to allow the Police&#x27;s Stewart Copeland to play cymbals and hi-hat on its opener, &quot;Red Rain&quot;. Gabriel sings – in his upper register, with a throaty, gravelly texture – of a destructive world with social problems such as torture and kidnapping. Its concept originated from a dream in which he envisaged the parting of a vast, red sea and human-like glass bottles filling up with blood. It was also intended to continue the story of Mozo, a recurring character on Gabriel&#x27;s first and second albums.

&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was the final track to be conceived. Most of Gabriel&#x27;s band had packed away their equipment and were ready to leave the studio, but he asked them to reassemble to quickly run through a song he had an idea for. &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was partially inspired by the music of Otis Redding, and Gabriel sought out Wayne Jackson, whom Gabriel had seen on tour with Redding in the 1960s, to record horns for the track. Opened by a shakuhachi bamboo flute, its beat is dominated by brass instruments, particularly Jackson&#x27;s horn, and features lyrics abundant with sexual euphemisms. Manu Katché&#x27;s drums were recorded in one take as he believed any subsequent version would be inferior to his original interpretation of the music.
&quot;So&quot;″s most political statement, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, was fuelled by Gabriel&#x27;s discontent with rising unemployment during Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s premiership and Dorothea Lange&#x27;s photograph &quot;Migrant Mother&quot;. The track began as a Linn drum machine pattern of slow, low-pitched tom-tom drums that Gabriel made, and Lanois believed could serve as the centrepiece of a song. Tony Levin added bass to create a more harmonious sound, and during the second half of the track, put a nappy behind his bass strings to dampen the sound. Gabriel ensured the song, which follows a narrative of an unemployed man and his lover, was written as a conversational piece. He initially sought Dolly Parton to portray the woman; although Parton declined, his friend Kate Bush agreed to feature. Bush serves as the song&#x27;s respondent, she assumes a comforting role and with delicate vocals, sings lines such as &quot;Rest your head/ you worry too much&quot;.

The album&#x27;s first side culminates with &quot;That Voice Again&quot;, in which Gabriel explores the concept of conscience, examining the &quot;parental voice in our heads that either helps or defeats us&quot;. Co-written with David Rhodes, who plays guitar over Katché and Levin&#x27;s input, the song was written after Gabriel&#x27;s initial discussions with Martin Scorsese about scoring &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; (1988).

===Side two===

&quot;In Your Eyes&quot; has been described as Gabriel&#x27;s greatest love song. Inspired by the Sagrada Família and its architect Antoni Gaudí, Gabriel sings over a drumbeat of only feeling complete in the eyes of his lover. The track&#x27;s powerful atmosphere is created through the singing of Senegalese musician Youssou N&#x27;Dour, who sings in his native Wolof.

Gabriel became interested in the late American poet Anne Sexton after reading the anthology &quot;To Bedlam and Part Way Back&quot;. He dedicated &quot;So&quot;″s sixth track to her, calling it &quot;Mercy Street&quot; after &quot;45 Mercy Street&quot;, a poem released in another posthumous collection. &quot;Mercy Street&quot; is set to one of several Forró-inspired percussion compositions that Gabriel recorded in Rio de Janeiro. When these compositions were unearthed in the studio, they were accidentally played back ten per cent slower than the original recording, giving them a grainy quality that Gabriel and Lanois thought highlighted the cymbal and guitars. It features two harmonious Gabriel vocals; one a shadow vocal an octave below the main vocal. Intended to give a sensual, haunting effect, this was hard to capture except when Gabriel first woke up.

The dance song &quot;Big Time&quot; has funk influences and is built on a &quot;percussive bass sound&quot;. Its lyrics satirise the yuppie culture of the 1980s, materialism and consumerism and are the result of Gabriel&#x27;s self-examination, after he considered whether he may have desired fame after all.

&quot;We Do What We&#x27;re Told (Milgram&#x27;s 37)&quot; was recorded for &quot;Peter Gabriel or &quot;Melt&quot;&quot; and is described as an interlude. It references the experiment on obedience carried out by American social psychologist Stanley Milgram, intended as a reference to the obedience citizens show to dictators during times of war. Marotta&#x27;s drums on the song – said to resemble &quot;a heartbeat heard from the womb&quot; – were coupled with Shankar&#x27;s violin and &quot;two overdubbed guitar tracks by Rhodes&quot;.

While &quot;We Do What We&#x27;re Told&quot; was the final song on initial LP versions of the album, the cassette and CD releases close with &quot;This Is the Picture (Excellent Birds)&quot;. &quot;Excellent Birds&quot; was composed with American musician Laurie Anderson. They recorded the song and the filmed music video over a period of three days - which was relatively quick by Gabriel&#x27;s standards - for inclusion on the 1984 global satellite television broadcast &quot;Good Morning, Mr. Orwell&quot;. This was interpolated into a recording called &quot;This Is the Picture&quot;, on which Nile Rodgers plays rhythm guitar. According to Anderson, she and Gabriel &quot;could never agree on what a bassline was. (I think I probably don’t hear so well down there.) I wanted to learn from him, but it turned into a standoff and so we each put out our own version of the song.&quot; However, Gabriel remembered it slightly differently: both of them quite liked the song such that they agreed to release it on their own albums. Anderson&#x27;s version, with Gabriel on additional vocals, appeared on her 1984 album &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot;, which is closer to the version premiered on &quot;Good Morning, Mr. Orwell&quot;. Gabriel&#x27;s own version was based on the groove, while Anderson&#x27;s version was &quot;more fragmented&quot;.

== Release ==

&quot;So&quot; is Gabriel&#x27;s first non-eponymous album. Gabriel has noted his dislike for titling albums, mainly because it distracts from the sleeve design. In an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he explained that his American label Geffen Records refused to release &quot;Peter Gabriel IV&quot; until it was retitled &quot;Security&quot;. He elaborated that for &quot;So&quot; &quot;[he] decided to go for the anti-title ... It can be more a piece of graphic, if you like, as opposed to something with meaning and intention. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done ever since&quot;. When the album was profiled in the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary series, Gabriel quipped that its short title meant it could be enlarged and useful when marketing it. Before the album was eventually named &quot;So&quot;, it was meant to be entitled &quot;Good&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover is a portrait of Gabriel photographed by Trevor Key, who was then most famous for capturing the bell artwork for Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973). The sleeve was designed by Peter Saville and Brett Wickens; Saville was best known for designing several sleeves for Factory Records artists and was paid £20,000 for his work on &quot;So&quot;. According to Saville, the cover was based on the one he designed for New Order&#x27;s album &quot;Low-Life&quot; the previous year, utilizing a similar method of taking Polaroid photos to produce a &quot;groovy&quot; portrait of the artist; Saville described the results as &quot;contemporary, young but grown up, mature.&quot; Gabriel recalled: &quot;The only compromise I made was to go with Peter Saville&#x27;s idea for a retro-style portrait. I was told my usual obscure LP sleeves alienated women.&quot; Saville, meanwhile, stated that the cover was influenced by the impassioned tone and unusually accessible nature of the music, following a nighttime drive where he witnessed a car crash, then reluctantly started playing a test cassette of the album and was moved to tears by Gabriel&#x27;s performance. The cover was partly influenced by photographer David Bailey&#x27;s work.

&quot;So&quot; was released on 19 May 1986. It topped the charts of seven countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, where it became Gabriel&#x27;s second number one album. In the United States, &quot;So&quot; became one of Geffen Records&#x27; most commercially successful releases, peaking at number two and remaining on the chart for ninety-three weeks. In April 1986, &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single and became Gabriel&#x27;s first and only number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, displacing Genesis&#x27; first and only US number one &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;. The track reached number four in the United Kingdom, where it ties with &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; as his highest-charting single, and peaked at number one in Canada. The success of &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; can be seen, in part, due to its hugely popular and innovative stop motion music video, designed by Aardman Animations. Gabriel would go on to say in an interview for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that he believed the video exposed &quot;So&quot;″s songs to a wider audience, bolstering the album&#x27;s success. Two high-charting singles followed, &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, which rose to number nine on the UK Singles Chart and a less successful seventy-nine in America, while &quot;Big Time&quot; peaked at number thirteen in the UK and number eight in America. &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; saw moderate success in America, where it reached twenty-six on the Hot 100, while &quot;Red Rain&quot; peaked at forty-six in the United Kingdom.

Bono contacted Gabriel to perform at A Conspiracy of Hope, a series of Live Aid-inspired concerts that intended to spread awareness of human rights issues in light of Amnesty International&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary. Gabriel accepted and in June 1986, he performed alongside Sting, the Police, Lou Reed, and Joan Baez, with a set that opened with &quot;Red Rain&quot; and featured &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;. Gabriel described it as &quot;the best tour [he&#x27;d] ever been on&quot;. In the same month, Gabriel performed at London&#x27;s Clapham Common, along with Boy George and Elvis Costello, for Artists Against Apartheid. Gabriel eventually embarked on the ninety-three date This Way Up tour to support &quot;So&quot;, beginning in Rochester, New York on 7 November 1986. One of the dates was a special two-night residency (20–21 December) at Tokyo&#x27;s Meiji Jingu Stadium to fund a global computer system for the University for Peace, a United Nations project. The tour suspended in early 1987 until June when it reached Europe, before going on to America and finishing at the Lycabettus Amphitheatre in Athens in October. Gabriel partially performed &quot;So&quot; at The Prince&#x27;s Trust Concert and at Human Rights Now! Tour in 1988.

==Critical reception==
&quot;So&quot; received mostly favourable reviews from music critics. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;only a handful of Western rock musicians have managed to use exotic rhythms and instruments with so much ingenuity and conviction&quot;. Pareles also praised his vocals, describing them as &quot;grainy but not bluesy, ageless and joyless, the voice of some ancient mariner recounting disasters&quot;. Tim Holmes of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the album as &quot;a record of considerable emotional complexity and musical sophistication&quot; and felt that the mainstream pop music scene would be encouraged to innovate by the album.

Terry Atkinson of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; viewed the album as offering &quot;an amazing variety of tones, moods and topics, and a consistently powerful level of expression&quot;. Although disliking &quot;Big Time&quot;, Atkinson concluded &quot;So&quot; was &quot;a great album, possibly Gabriel&#x27;s best&quot;. Steve Hochman, also of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, praised Gabriel&#x27;s reinvention too, describing it as &quot;real progress&quot; compared to the contemporaneous work of other progressive rock acts such as Genesis, GTR and Marillion. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Lynn Van Matre praised the album&#x27;s &quot;wave of funky rhythms&quot; and called for more appreciation of Gabriel&#x27;s talent, but noted a lack of &quot;quirkiness&quot; and said there were no tracks as impactful as his 1980 single &quot;Biko&quot;. Robert Christgau was also lukewarm in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, writing that &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go, which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn&#x27;t get him up on the one—smart guys do go for texture in a pinch.&quot;

&quot;So&quot; has continued to perform well in most retrospective reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commended &quot;So&quot; as the &quot;catchiest, happiest record he ever cut&quot;. Erlewine particularly praised Gabriel&#x27;s fusion of art rock with African music and soul. Jude Rogers of the BBC wrote, &quot;once you look past the bombast of &#x27;Sledgehammer&#x27;, ... you notice how easily its artful ideas slipped inside the 80s mainstream&quot;. &quot;The Quietus&quot;″ Wyndham Wallace praised &quot;So&quot;″s sincerity and called it &quot;a heartfelt journey through intense emotional territory, assembled and arranged with intricacy and commitment, laboured over with such care that it sounds effortless&quot;.

Ryan Bray, writer for &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, concluded &quot;So&quot; was an &quot;all-too-rare record that manages to have it both ways, earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving so much as an artistic inch&quot;. He added that &quot;it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s&quot;. Mark Blake of &quot;Q&quot; described the album as &quot;carbon-dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths&quot;. He added that &quot;Gabriel crafted an album of user-friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd.&quot; Terry Staunton of &quot;Classic Rock&quot; wrote &quot;Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record&#x27;s muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence.&quot; Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed &quot;a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole&quot;.

In a less positive retrospective review, &quot;Mojo&quot;″s David Buckley contrasted the album with Gabriel&#x27;s earlier, more experimental work, stating &quot;on 1986&#x27;s &quot;So&quot;, he switched tack to write pop, and write big. The results are mixed. &#x27;Sledgehammer&#x27;, echoing both Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &#x27;Superstition&#x27; and David Bowie&#x27;s &#x27;Fame&#x27;, retains its punch. Elsewhere, Gabriel sounds airbrushed on &#x27;Mercy Street&#x27;, &#x27;Red Rain&#x27; and &#x27;In Your Eyes&#x27;, with only &#x27;We Do What We&#x27;re Told&#x27; a reminder of a daring past.&quot; In a mostly positive 8/10 review for &quot;Uncut&quot;, John Lewis also directed criticism at the album. He praised its state-of-the-art production in parts, highlighting &quot;Big Time&quot; and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; as standout tracks, but stated elsewhere it interfered in places, such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer on &quot;That Voice Again&quot; and whistling ambient accompaniment on &quot;Mercy Street&quot;.

==Legacy==

At the 29th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;So&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year, losing to Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Graceland&quot; (1986), while &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; received nominations for Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. At the sixth Brit Awards, hosted by Jonathan King at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, Gabriel won Best British Male Artist and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; won Best British Music Video. Gabriel was most successful at the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards where he was honoured with the Video Vanguard Award and &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; won an additional nine awards including Video of the Year, a record that has not been challenged. Its video is the most played music video in the history of MTV.

&quot;So&quot; is often regarded as Gabriel&#x27;s best album, as well as one of the best albums of the 1980s. It enabled Gabriel to transform from a cult artist, acclaimed for his cerebral, experimental solo work, into a mainstream, internationally known star. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed &quot;So&quot; at 187 (2003 edition) and 297 (2020 edition) on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and at 14 on its 100 Best Albums of the 1980s, noting that &quot;despite its mass appeal, however, &quot;So&quot; also presented compelling challenges.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot; placed it at number one on its list of Gabriel&#x27;s best albums, writing, &quot;Peter Gabriel&#x27;s fifth studio album is a mesmerizing dichotomy: simultaneously hooky and experimental; timeless, yet completely crystallizing its moment in history ... It&#x27;s a masterpiece.

&quot;So&quot; has been profiled in the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; series and featured in &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at 41 on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the 1980s, describing it as &quot;Gabriel&#x27;s most accessible yet ambitious work. A chronicle of political, emotional, and artistic exploration, the album [attempts] to balance standard pop orthodoxy with his still-rumbling desire for sonic experimentation&quot;. Jim Allen wrote for &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;What makes &quot;So&quot; important is the way he seamlessly blended peerless pop savvy with an iconoclast’s adventurous artistic instincts. His slightly twisted pop songs packed enough emotional impact, sonic surprises and catchy melodies to make for one of the era’s most consistently rewarding records.&quot; Conversely, in 2002 &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s lead critic Alexis Petridis stated that Gabriel had &quot;suffered a musical mid-life crisis&quot;, lampooning it as &quot;an album packed with ultra-commercial priapic cod-funk&quot; and calling it &quot;a ruthless bid for mainstream success, yet he emerged without a stain on his avant-garde credentials&quot;.

&quot;So&quot; is Gabriel&#x27;s best-selling album, having been certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In 2002, &quot;So&quot; was re-issued and remastered. In 2011, several of tracks from &quot;So&quot; were featured on Gabriel&#x27;s ninth studio release &quot;New Blood&quot;, a project of orchestral re-recordings from Gabriel&#x27;s discography. In 2012, for the album&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary, a limited-edition box set was released. It includes the remastered &quot;So&quot; album, the &quot;Live at Athens&quot; (1987) album and a &quot;So DNA&quot; album which examines its production, as well as new liner notes, photographs, vinyl collectibles and the &quot;So: Classic Albums&quot; documentary. In the same year, Gabriel embarked on the Back to Front Tour, where Gabriel plays every song on the &quot;So&quot; album with several of the session musicians from its recording.

Michael Glabicki of the American band Rusted Root acknowledges this album as a key influence on his own career exploring worldbeat music, saying, &quot;I just kind of got locked into that sound. Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;So&quot; kind of gave everyone the go-ahead that this could work in a popular fashion. For people like me who were exploring those sounds, the wonder of if it&#x27;s going to work or not just went away at that point.&quot; English musician Steven Wilson said, &quot;People think the 80s were a shallow, superficial era&quot;, but he cited &quot;So&quot; as an album that was &quot;really smart&quot;.

<doc id="1053527" wikidata="Q3181785" url="?curid=1053527" title="John Howard (American actor)">
<text>John Howard (born John Richard Cox Jr.; April 14, 1913 – February 19, 1995) was an American actor. He is best remembered for his roles in the films &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940).

Howard played Bulldog Drummond in seven films which were produced by Paramount. He also appeared in many television series and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== Early life ==
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Howard was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of what now is Case Western Reserve University. At college he discovered a love for the theater, and took part in student productions.

One night, a talent scout from Paramount was in Cleveland to see the local stock company. The show was not on that night, so the scout decided to go and see a production at the local university. He was impressed by Howard in a production of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; and arranged for a screen test.

==Career==
===Paramount===
Howard became a contract player for Paramount under the name of &quot;Jon Cox&quot;. He appeared uncredited in &quot;One Hour Late&quot; (1934). Small roles followed in &quot;Car 99&quot; (1935) and &quot;Four Hours to Kill!&quot; (1935).

He changed his name to John Howard and had a bigger part in &quot;Annapolis Farewell&quot; (1935).

===Leading man===
Paramount promoted him to a leading man in just his fourth film, &quot;Millions in the Air&quot; (1935), though it was a &quot;B&quot; movie.

He was second billed in &quot;Soak the Rich&quot; (1936), made for Paramount by the team of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur.

Paramount put him in an &quot;A&quot; feature, &quot;13 Hours by Air&quot; (1936), and he was fourth billed in the credits. He starred in &quot;Border Flight&quot; (1936) alongside Frances Farmer and had a good part in &quot;Valiant Is the Word for Carrie&quot; (1936), with Gladys George.

Howard also starred in the comedy &quot;Easy to Take&quot; (1936) with Marsha Hunt.

According to David Shipman, &quot;Howard..., was tried out in various capacities – supporting roles in As, leads in Bs, and on loan-outs. These last could be significant: the smaller studios had restricted contract lists and were prepared to pay well to borrow good-looking guys whose acting consisted mainly of not bumping into the furniture&quot;.

===&quot;Lost Horizon&quot;===
Howard&#x27;s first memorable role came on loan out to Columbia: as Ronald Colman&#x27;s younger brother in &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937), directed by Frank Capra. Capra had seen him in &quot;Annapolis Farewell&quot; and arranged for a screen test. The film was a huge success and really established Howard, who later said &quot;without &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; I doubt very much whether I would have survived in Hollywood&quot;.

Howard was borrowed by Universal for the lead in &quot;Let Them Live&quot; (1937). Back at Paramount, he supported Bob Burns and Martha Raye in &quot;Mountain Music&quot; (1937).

At RKO, Howard did &quot;Hitting a New High&quot; (1937) with Lily Pons and Jack Oakie. Columbia used him in &quot;Penitentiary&quot; (1938) with Walter Connolly.

He and Lew Ayres were in a buddy comedy, &quot;Hold &#x27;Em Navy&quot; (1937), then Howard supported Lloyd Nolan and Shirley Ross in &quot;Prison Farm&quot; (1938) and starred in &quot;Touchdown, Army&quot; (1938) and &quot;Grand Jury Secrets&quot; (1939). 

===Bulldog Drummond===
Since 1937, Paramount had made a series of &quot;B&quot; movies about daring adventurer Bulldog Drummond. The first of the actors to play the role, Ray Milland, was in &quot;Bulldog Drummond Escapes&quot; (1937). Milland was being groomed for more important pictures, so the studio offered the role of the British hero, Captain Hugh Drummond, to John Howard. Howard was himself not British, so he chose not to attempt a British accent, relying instead on diction to get the idea across. In his first performance as Drummond, &quot;Bulldog Drummond Comes Back&quot; (1937), Howard took second billing to John Barrymore, who played Inspector Nielson of Scotland Yard. According to Shipman, Howard &quot;proved himself a resourceful, debonair, and witty player, his double-breasted suits and trilbies an admirable choice.&quot; Howard continued opposite Barrymore in &quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1937), and &quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Peril&quot; (1938). H. B. Warner replaced Barrymore in &quot;Bulldog Drummond in Africa&quot; (1938), &quot;Arrest Bulldog Drummond&quot; (1939), &quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Secret Police&quot; (1939), and &quot;Bulldog Drummond&#x27;s Bride&quot; (1939), the last in the series. As Shipman said, about the Drummond films, &quot;[The] titles, splendidly, had nothing to do with the plots (since Drummond was never captured, there was nowhere to escape from) and the inconsequence was pleasing... All the while the spider&#x27;s-web plots (of death threats, disguises, ambushes, sobbing women and booby-trapped motor-cars) hurtled to the screen – under various directors – with superior production values. They are more enjoyable than competitors featuring the Falcon, Charlie Chan, the Lone Wolf, Sexton Blake et al. due in part to Howard&#x27;s insouciant playing&quot;.

===&quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot;===

Howard made &quot;What a Life&quot; (1939) with Betty Grable and &quot;Disputed Passage&quot; (1940) with Dorothy Lamour. The latter was a flop at the box office, and Paramount began to cool on Howard.

Universal borrowed him to play a key role in &quot;Green Hell&quot; (1940). MGM used him in &quot;The Man from Dakota&quot; (1940), supporting Wallace Beery, and &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), where he played the fiancé of Katharine Hepburn, competing for her amorous attentions with characters played by Cary Grant and James Stewart. It remains one of his best-known films.

Back at Paramount, Howard was top-billed in &quot;Texas Rangers Ride Again&quot; (1940). Universal borrowed him to play the leading man in &quot;The Invisible Woman&quot; (1941) with Barrymore and Virginia Bruce.

At Paramount, he supported Basil Rathbone in &quot;The Mad Doctor&quot; (1941), then Universal gave him the lead in &quot;Tight Shoes&quot; (1941). At RKO, he supported Adolphe Menjou and Gloria Swanson in &quot;Father Takes a Wife&quot; (1941), then at Columbia he was Joan Blondell&#x27;s leading man in the farce comedy &quot;Three Girls About Town&quot; (1941).

Howard was top billed in Republic Pictures&#x27; &quot;A Tragedy at Midnight&quot; (1942). At Columbia, he had the starring role in &quot;The Man Who Returned to Life&quot; (1942), and &quot;Submarine Raider&quot; (1942), then he did &quot;Isle of Missing Men&quot; (1942) for Monogram Pictures.

Howard wanted to join the navy, but there was a delay after he signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, who put him in &quot;The Undying Monster&quot; (1942), in which he was third billed.

==Military service==
Howard served in the United States Navy as a lieutenant during World War II, later becoming an executive officer aboard the minesweeper USS &quot;YMS-24&quot;, aboard which he participated in landing operations at the Allied invasion of Sicily, Allied invasion of Italy, and Anzio, and deception operations against the island of Sardinia and in &quot;Operation Dragoon&quot; on the South coast of Vichy France. During &#x27;Operation Dragoon&#x27; off the French coast on August 16, 1944 USS &quot;YMS-24&quot; struck a sea mine, the blast killing its captain and severely damaging the ship. Howard took command and fought to save the ship, jumping into the sea several times to save crew members who had fallen overboard. For his actions he was awarded both the United States&#x27; Navy Cross and the French Croix de Guerre.

==Return to acting==

Upon his return to Hollywood, Howard struggled to re-establish himself. He was told that Fox had no projects for him, so he ended his contract with them to do a play -- which closed out of town. &quot;It was a long, long period of absolute dearth,&quot; he later said.

He had support parts in &quot;Love from a Stranger&quot; (1947) for Bryan Foy at Eagle-Lion Films and &quot;I, Jane Doe&quot; (1948) for Republic.

He starred in &quot;Public Prosecutor&quot;, the first dramatic TV drama series shot on film. It was filmed in 1947 but not shown until several years later. &quot;Public Prosecutor&quot; was ultimately broadcast as part of &quot;Crawford Mystery Theatre&quot; in 1951.

He was in &quot;Entrapment&quot; on &quot;NBC Presents&quot; in 1949.

Howard supported John Wayne in &quot;The Fighting Kentuckian&quot; (1949) for Republic and had the lead in &quot;Radar Secret Service&quot; (1950) for the low-budget Lippert Pictures.

Howard guest-starred on shows like &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;The Bigelow Theatre&quot; and &quot;Pulitzer Prize Playhouse&quot; and had leads in low-budget films like &quot;Experiment Alcatraz&quot; (1950).

Howard was in &quot;Models Inc.&quot; (1952) and &quot;Make Haste to Live&quot; (1954) and guest starred on &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;The Loretta Young Show&quot;. His first high-profile film in a long while came when he played Laraine Day&#x27;s husband in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot; (1954).

Howard made his Broadway debut in 1953 in &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot; where he met his future wife, the ballerina and actress Eva Ralf.

===Television star===
Howard continued to work in TV appearing in &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;The Whistler&quot;, &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Star and the Story&quot;, &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot;, &quot;Studio 57&quot;, &quot;Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;TV Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, and &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;.

He had the lead in a series, &quot;Dr. Hudson&#x27;s Secret Journal&quot; (1955–57). The series raised Howard&#x27;s profile, and he was offered the lead in &quot;The Unknown Terror&quot; (1957). In 1958 he starred in another TV series, &quot;Adventures of the Sea Hawk&quot;, which ran for 26 episodes.

===1960s===
Howard&#x27;s 1960s acting work included guest spots on &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Men into Space&quot;, &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot;, &quot;The Americans&quot;, &quot;Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Gunslinger&quot;, &quot;Lock Up&quot;, &quot;Bronco&quot;, &quot;Surfside 6&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, and &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;.

He formed a friendship with Fred MacMurray, star of the TV series &quot;My Three Sons&quot; who, like Howard, had worked in Paramount features of the 1930s. Howard was a regular guest star on the show, playing MacMurray&#x27;s boss. Series producer Don Fedderson used Howard in his other series, &quot;Family Affair&quot; and &quot;To Rome with Love&quot;. Howard also had roles in the feature films &quot;Destination Inner Space&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Destructors&quot; (1967). 

===1970s===
Howard could be seen in &quot;Eye for an Eye&quot; (1971), &quot;The Bold Ones: The New Doctors&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Buck and the Preacher&quot; (1972), &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, &quot;Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;The ABC Afternoon Playbreak&quot;, &quot;The New Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;So Evil, My Sister&quot;, &quot;Capone&quot; (1975), &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Bronk&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot; and &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;.

<text>Paul Jakob Deussen (; 7 January 1845 – 6 July 1919) was a German Indologist and professor of philosophy at University of Kiel. Strongly influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer, Deussen was a friend of Friedrich Nietzsche and Swami Vivekananda. In 1911, he founded the Schopenhauer Society (&quot;Schopenhauer-Gesellschaft&quot;). Professor Deussen was the first editor, in 1912, of the scholarly journal Schopenhauer Yearbook (&quot;Schopenhauer-Jahrbuch&quot;).

Deussen, who Sanskritised his name to &quot;Deva-Sena&quot; as a mark of his admiration for the language, is one of the distinguished roll of Europeans who — often with lyrical admiration — participated in the scholarly Western discovery of Sanskrit and Hinduism that took place in British India itself, Germany, France and England.

==Biography==
Paul Deussen was born on 7 January 1845 in Oberdreis, Neuwied in the Rhine Province, one of eight children of a clergyman of modest means. He became a student, and lifelong devotee, of the German philosopher Schopenhauer, and of the philosophy of Kant; and he became a friend of Friedrich Nietzsche. Deussen was educated at Bonn, Tübingen and Berlin Universities between 1864 and 1881, writing his dissertation on Plato&#x27;s philosophy. Deussen was appointed &quot;Privatdocent&quot; (1881-7) and &quot;Extraordinarius&quot; (1887-9) at the university of Berlin, and &quot;Ordinarius&quot; (1889–1919, the year of his death), at the University of Kiel. Until 1919, Deussen continued to edit the Schopenhauer Yearbook, as well as working on an edition of Schopenhauer&#x27;s works.

It was when he attended a lecture at the University of Bonn by Professor Christian Lassen (1800-1876), expounding the &quot;Shakuntala&quot;, that Deussen was fired by Sanskrit and Hinduism. Deussen&#x27;s first publication (1877) was published in English as &quot;The Elements of Metaphysics&quot; in 1894. It was followed by the translations of &quot;The Sutra of the Vedanta&quot; in 1906; &quot;The Philosophy of the Upanishads&quot; also in 1906; and &quot;The System of the Vedanta&quot; in 1912. His visit to India in 1904 was published in English as &quot;My Indian Reminiscences&quot; in 1912. However, his autobiographical papers, edited by his daughter Erika (1894-1956) and published in German in 1922, have so far not been translated into English.

Deussen&#x27;s &quot;System of the Vedanta&quot; has been reprinted several times: he uses the &quot;Brahmasutra&quot; and – rather less — Adi Shankara&#x27;s commentary on it, as the structure for his exposition.

His scholarship has been described as immense, perceptive, and meticulous. Mahinder Gulati refers to him as an Orientalist and Sanskrit scholar.

Paul Deussen&#x27;s name is thus linked with George Boucher, Sir William Jones and Sir John Woodroffe in British India, Anquetil-Duperron and Eugène Burnouf in France, Heinrich Roth, Franz Bopp, Friedrich von Schlegel and Max Müller in Germany, in the European revelation of the wealth of Hinduism as revealed by Sanskrit documents.

<text>Enhydra is a genus of mustelid that contains the sea otter and two extinct relatives. It is the only extant genus of the bunodont otters group, referring to otters with non-blade carnassials with rounded cusps.

Sea otters probably diverged from other otters during the Pliocene, approximately 5 mya. They probably arose from the closely related &quot;Enhydritherium&quot;, a bunodont otter endemic to North America during the late Miocene and early Pliocene epochs.

&quot;Enhydra reevei&quot;, the oldest known species, has its origins in the Atlantic, suggesting this may have been where sea otters originated. Fossil evidence indicates the &quot;Enhydra&quot; lineage became isolated in the North Pacific approximately 2 million years ago, giving rise to the now-extinct &quot;Enhydra macrodonta&quot; and the modern sea otter.

<text>Leonardo Domenici (born 12 July 1955) is an Italian politician. He served as Mayor of Florence from 1999 to 2009.

== Biography ==
Leonardo Domenici was born in Florence in 1955, later graduating in moral philosophy from the University of Florence.

=== Political life ===
Domenici started his political career in 1976. He joined the ‘’Federazione Giovanile Comunista Italiana’’ (Italian Youth Communist Federation) at the age of 15, and was elected Florence city councilor in 1990 as member of the Italian Communist Party, serving until 1995.

He was elected MP in 1994 and re-elected in the following elections in 1996. He spent a lot of time working for the “Institutional Affairs” commission at the Italian Chamber of Deputies, dedicating his efforts in the reforms of Regions and local institutions.

==== As Mayor of Florence ====
Guiding a centre-left coalition, on 13 June 1999, he was elected Mayor of Florence at the first round and, on 27 June 2004, was elected again for a second term. 
He was the Chairman of ANCI, the national association of Italian municipalities (2000-2009), and a member of the Bureau of the Committee of the Regions (2008-2009).

Domenici awarded Dante Alighieri the city&#x27;s highest honour and revoked the sentence on the poet from 1302 which stated that he would be executed if he set foot in the city again.

==== As Member of European Parliament ====
Currently, Leonardo Domenici is an MEP, belonging to the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D), where he is member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and of the Delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee.

Since 2011 he is rapporteur for the European Parliament on the credit rating agencies regulation.

=== As President of Fiorentina ===
In 2002 Leonardo Domenici, as Mayor of Florence, created a new football society, Fiorentina 1926 Florentia, later Florentia Viola, in order to replace the bankrupted AC Fiorentina.

He was the President of this new society until Diego Della Valle bought the team.

== Awards ==

* Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Star (&quot;Großes Goldenes Ehrenzeichen mit Stern&quot;), Republic of Austria

<text>Vieux () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==History==
The town contains numerous Roman era ruins, as Vieux was a settlement called Aregenua, and appears on the Roman map, Tabula Peutingeriana.

During the Battle of Normandy in 1944, Vieux was designated as Hill 112 position, a strategic point for the Battle of Caen, the area of rue d&#x27;Esquay and the Bas de Vieux were badly affected by the allied bombardment of July 6, 1944. The portion of these streets, destroyed at this time are now dated for its name.

<doc id="1053544" wikidata="Q1361360" url="?curid=1053544" title="Transversion">
<text>Transversion, in molecular biology, refers to a point mutation in DNA in which a single (two ring) purine (A or G) is changed for a (one ring) pyrimidine (T or C), or vice versa. A transversion can be spontaneous, or it can be caused by ionizing radiation or alkylating agents. It can only be reversed by a spontaneous reversion.

== Ratio of transitions to transversions ==
Although there are two possible transversions but only one possible transition per base, transition mutations are more likely than transversions because substituting a single ring structure for another single ring structure is more likely than substituting a double ring for a single ring. Also, transitions are less likely to result in amino acid substitutions (due to wobble base pair), and are therefore more likely to persist as &quot;silent substitutions&quot; in populations as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A transversion usually has a more pronounced effect than a transition because the second and third nucleotide codon position of the DNA, which to a large extent is responsible for the degeneracy of the code, is more tolerant of transition than a transversion: transitions are more likely to be synonymous substitutions than transversions, as one observes in the codon table.

== Spontaneous germline transversion ==
8-oxo-2&#x27;-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) is an oxidized derivative of deoxyguanosine, and is one of the major products of DNA oxidation. During DNA replication in the germ line of mice, the oxidized base 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) causes spontaneous and heritable G to T transversion mutations. These mutations occur in different stages of the germ cell lineage and are distributed throughout the chromosomes.

== Consequences of transversion mutations ==
The location of a transversion mutation on a gene coding for a protein correlates with the extent of the mutation. If the mutation occurs at a site that is not involved with the shape of a protein or the structure of an enzyme or its active site, the mutation will not have a significant effect on the cell or the enzymatic activity of its proteins. If the mutation occurs at a site that changes the structure or function of a protein, therefore changing its enzymatic activity, the mutation can have significant effects on the survival of the cell.

== Transversions due to products of oxidative guanine damage ==
Of the natural nitrogenous bases of DNA, guanine is most prone to oxidation. Oxidation of guanine, also known as oxidative guanine damage, results in the formation of many products. These products trigger mutations, leading to DNA damage, and can pair with adenine and guanine through hydrogen bonding causing G-T transversions and G-C transversions, respectively.

== Transversion and p53 mutations in smoking-associated cancers ==
The mutation of the P53 gene is the most common gene mutation found in cancer cells. A study has shown that p53 mutations are common in tobacco-related cancers, with a variation in the amount of G-T transversions in lung cancer from smokers and non-smokers. In smokers’ lung cancer, the prevalence of G-T transversions is 30% compared to that of 12% in non-smokers. At many p53 mutational hotspots, a large number of the mutations are G-T events in lung cancers but almost exclusively G-A transitions in non-tobacco-related cancers.

<text>Vignola (Modenese: ; Bolognese: ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Modena (Emilia-Romagna), Italy.

Its economy is based on agriculture, especially fruit farming, but there are also mechanical industries and service companies.

The city is mostly known as the birthplace of the Renaissance architect Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola.

==History==

Vignola, whose name derives from the Latin &quot;vineola&quot; (&quot;small vine&quot;) is located near an ancient Etruscan road connecting Bologna to Parma. However it is mentioned in the Middle Ages as having been founded in 826 as, according to the legend, a castle to protect the lands of the nearby Abbey of Nonantola.

Vignola was a possession of those bishops until 1247; during the wars between Guelphs and Ghibellines its territory was contented between the communes of Modena and Bologna, until the Grassoni family installed their seigniory in Vignola. This lasted until 1399, when it was acquired by the House of Este; two years later it was conceded as a county to Uguccione de&#x27; Contrari from Ferrara. With the death of Ercole Contrari in 1557, Vignola was assigned to Giacomo Boncompagni, son of Pope Gregory XIII. The Boncompagni rule fell with the Napoleonic Conquest of Italy, and, after the Congress of Vienna of 1814, Vignola became part of the Duchy of Modena.

==Main sights==
*Town Museum
*The Castle (&quot;Rocca&quot;), built perhaps in the Carolingian era but known from 1178; it was turned into a patrician residence by the Contrari family in the Renaissance era. It houses a chapel with late-Gothic frescoes (early 15th century), and a hall (&quot;Sala del Padiglione&quot;) with frescoes from the same age.
*&quot;Palazzo dei Contrari &quot;
*&quot;Palazzo Boncompagni&quot; (or &quot;Palazzo Barozzi&quot;) 
*&quot;Torre Galvani&quot;
*&quot;Villa Martuzzi&quot;

== Transport ==
Vignola is served by Vignola railway station, terminus of the Casalecchio–Vignola railway.

==Notable people==

<text>Savennières () is a commune in the Maine-et-Loire department in western France.

It lies near the river Loire south west of Angers and is best known for its production of highly rated white wine.

With production predominantly centred on the Chenin blanc grape, it is famed for its particularly long-lasting dry white wine comparable to that of Vouvray.

==Savennières wine==

The area around Savennières is used for the production of white wine from Chenin blanc grapes. The wines are mostly dry, often produced in a powerful style, and the best examples (such as those produced by Nicolas Joly&#x27;s Château de la Roche aux Moines) are highly regarded by international wine critics. The Savennières &quot;Appellation d&#x27;Origine Controlée&quot; (AOC) spreads over 3 hills of schist, located on the right (northwest) bank of the Loire river, totaling about 300 hectares, of which about half are currently in production.

<text>The Viducassēs (Gaulish: *&quot;Uiducassēs/Widucassēs&quot;) were a Gallic tribe dwelling in the modern Calvados department during the Iron Age and the Roman period.

== Name ==
They are mentioned as &quot;Viducasses&quot; by Pliny (1st c. AD), and as &quot;Bidoukesíōn&quot; (Βιδουκεσίων; Βιδουκασίων, Βιδουκαίσιων) and &quot;Bidoukésioi&quot; (Βιδουκέσιοι; Οὐιδουκαίσιοι, Οὐιδουκέσιοι) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).

The Gaulish ethnonym derives from the stem *&quot;uidu-/widu&quot; (&#x27;tree, wood&#x27;). The meaning of the second element &quot;-casses&quot;, attested in other Gaulish ethnonyms such as &quot;Bodiocasses&quot;, &quot;Durocasses&quot;, &quot;Sucasses&quot;, &quot;Tricasses&quot;, or &quot;Veliocasses&quot;, has been debated, but it probably signifies &#x27;(curly) hair, hairstyle&#x27; (cf. Old Irish &quot;chass&quot; &#x27;curl&#x27;), perhaps referring to a particular warrior coiffure. The name may thus be translated as &#x27;the tangled-hair ones&#x27;, that is to say &#x27;those with the hair tangled like a tree&#x27;. Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel has proposed to interpret the name as &#x27;those with wooden helmets&#x27;. 

The city of Vieux, attested in the 3rd century AD as &quot;Civitas Viducassium&quot; (&#x27;civitas of the Viducasses&#x27;; &quot;Veiocae&quot; in 1180, &quot;Vieux&quot; in 1294), is named after the Gallic tribe.

== Geography ==

The Viducasses dwelled south of the Bodiocasses, north of the Aulerci Diablintes, southeast of the Venelli, northeast of the Abrincatui, west of the Lexovii, and northwest of the Sagii.

During the Roman period, their chief town was known as Aregenua (&#x27;by the Guigne river&#x27;; modern Vieux), whose area roughly corresponded to the plain of Caen. The city grew from the first half of the 2nd century and reached its height during the Severan period (193–235). In an inscription dated to 238 AD, the settlement is called both a &#x27;free city&#x27; and a &#x27;colony&#x27;. In the 3rd century, Aregenua became Civitas Viducassium, although it was probably absorbed by the civitas of the Bodiocasses in the early 4th century, for the Civitas Viducassium is not mentioned in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; and the &quot;Notitia Galliarum&quot;.

== Religion ==
A sanctuary from the end of the 1st century BC is known at Baron-sur-Odon, 2.5km west of Aregenua.

<text>&quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; is a single by American rapper Coolio, released on August 1, 1995 by Tommy Boy, Warner Bros. and MCA. Interpolating Stevie Wonder&#x27;s song &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; (1976), &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; features vocals from American singer L.V. who served as a co-composer and co-lyricist with Coolio and Doug Rasheed, with Wonder also being credited for the composition and lyrics. Certified Platinum in October, the song was included on Coolio&#x27;s second album, &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, in November 1995. Its music video was directed by Antoine Fuqua and featured Michelle Pfeiffer. The song is taken from Pfeiffer&#x27;s movie &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, and the music video is also themed around the movie.

The song was the top-selling single of 1995 on US &quot;Billboard&quot; and the first rap single ever to go straight to number one in Britain. In 2008, it was ranked number 38 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; listed the song at number 100 in their ranking of &quot;100 Best Songs of the 1990s&quot; in 2012 and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked it among the &quot;500 Best Pop Songs of All Time&quot; in 2023. Coolio was awarded a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance, two MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rap Video and Best Video from a Film and a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for the song/album. The song was voted as the best single of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll.

The song has sold over five million copies in the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. Coolio performed this song live at the 1995 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards with L.V. and Wonder, and at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards with L.V.

== Background and writing ==
Coolio, L.V. and Doug Rasheed composed &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; and wrote its lyrics, with Rasheed also serving as the song&#x27;s producer. Stevie Wonder received crediting for the composition and lyrics due to the interpolation of his song &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; from his 1976 album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;.

The song begins with a line from Psalm 23:4: &quot;&quot;As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death&quot;, but then diverges with: &quot;I take a look at my life and realize there&#x27;s nothing left.&quot;&quot; Adding to some of the religious overtones are choral vocals in the background. Coolio freestyled the first couple of lines, with the rest of the lyrics coming to him quickly in one sitting. He would later claim that the song ultimately came from a source outside himself, saying: &quot;&#x27;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&#x27; wanted to be born; it wanted to come to life, and it chose me as the vessel.&quot;

The chorus of the song &quot;&quot;Been spending most their lives living in a gangsta’s paradise,&quot;” was created by L.V. by stacking the vocals many times to make it sound like a choir.

Due to the sampling of Wonder&#x27;s music, &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; is one of the few Coolio tracks that did not contain any profanity, as Wonder did not appreciate his song being paired with it. Coolio said, &quot;I had a few vulgarities... and he (Wonder) wasn&#x27;t with that. So I changed it. Once he heard it, he thought it was incredible.&quot;

== Chart performance ==
The single reached number one in the United States, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Denmark, The Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, Australia, and New Zealand, making it Coolio&#x27;s most successful single. In Australia, the song stayed at No. 1 for 14 weeks, a record that would only be broken 22 years later by Ed Sheeran&#x27;s &quot;Shape of You&quot;. Following Coolio&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother 6&quot;, it re-entered the UK singles chart peaking at No. 31. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; is the first rap single to sell over a million copies as well as the first rap single ever to go straight to Number One.

In the United States, the single spent twelve weeks in the top two of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, of which three were spent at No. 1 and nine at No. 2. The song was certified triple platinum by the RIAA on February 23, 1996, indicating 3 million copies sold. It has sold a further 1.8 million downloads in the US in the digital era . As of September 2022, the song had sold 1.9 million downloads in US and had accumulated 763.1 million streams.

Following Coolio&#x27;s death on September 28, 2022, &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; debuted two days later at number 5 on the UK Official Singles Sales Chart Top 100, and reentered the Official Top 100 Singles Chart on 7 October 2022 at number 55.

== Critical reception ==
Bill Lamb of About.com described the song as &quot;riveting and atmospheric&quot;. James Masterton for &quot;Dotmusic&quot; noted its &quot;undoubted brilliance&quot;. David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt it &quot;may be the bleakest tune ever to top the pop singles chart.&quot; He added, &quot;With its ghostly choir and lyrics about a gun-toting 23-year-old who kneels in the streetlight wondering if he’ll live to see 24, it examines the abyss with journalistic coolness.&quot; &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; praised it as &quot;complete pop greatness&quot;. &quot;Idolator&quot; called it a &quot;rap rhapsody&quot;, naming it one of The 50 Best Pop Singles of 1995. David Bennun from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, &quot;That single. F*** me, it&#x27;s good. The slow pulse of strings, the heavenly choir. Puts me in mind of prime Sisters of Mercy, of all things. Coursing at the rate of a slow heartbeat, point being, it&#x27;s life as it is lived, it&#x27;s in the blood. Like all the best rap, you feel the meaning, you sense it, before you even listen to the lyrics&quot;. Another &quot;Melody Maker&quot; editor, Taylor Parkes, said, &quot;An oddly reserved, frustratingly MEAGRE moment. Coolio is, generally speaking, among the lusher, more intriguing gangsta rappers... &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; limps a bit. Nice ominous, looped choir. Fits a little too comfortably on &quot;America&#x27;s Top 10&quot;.&quot;

Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; commented, &quot;Last year, this rapper hit paydirt with a reworking of Lakeside&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;. This time around, he pulls off the same trick with this tall tale founded on Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot;. Unlike the original, which surprisingly never was a hit, this one was a US number 1 and has every chance of succeeding in Europe.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; gave it four out of five, saying, &quot;An infectious release from Grammy-nominated rapper that challenges the assumed form of the genre. Number one in the US and could do big things here.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; editor Alan Jones deemed it &quot;a brooding and menacing track&quot;. Dele Fadele from &quot;NME&quot; named it Single of the Week, writing, &quot;And what a breathtaking doleful and melancholy record &#x27;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&#x27; is. [...] Stabbing strings, a keyboard drone, a massed gothic chorus of gospel voices and a beat ticking time to the bitter end, are all weaved together into this solemn theme tune&quot;.

== Music video ==
The accompanying music video for the song was directed by American film director Antoine Fuqua and featured Michelle Pfeiffer reprising her earlier role as U.S. Marine LouAnne Johnson in the movie &quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;. The video also includes scenes from the movie. Initially Coolio was concerned with the video&#x27;s treatment stating, &quot;I wanted some low-riders and some shit in it; I was trying to take it &#x27;hood&#x27;.&quot; Despite this, he trusted Fuqua and was ultimately pleased with the final result.

For the music video, Coolio won the Best Rap Video at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1996.

The music video hit one billion YouTube views in July 2022.

== Impact and legacy ==
In December 1995, &quot;NME&quot; ranked &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; number 13 in its list of &quot;&quot;NME&quot; Writers&#x27; Top 50 Singles of 1995&quot;. In 1996, it was named Best Rap 12-inch at the International Dance Music Awards in Miami. In 1999, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; listed the song number four on its list of &quot;Top Singles of the &#x27;90s&quot;. In 2008, it was ranked number 38 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop&quot;. In 2012, &quot;NME&quot; listed the song 100th in its ranking of &quot;100 Best Songs of the 1990s&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine placed it at number 20 in its ranking of &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Songs of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Same year, &quot;Stacker&quot; placed it at number 19 on its list of &quot;Best 90s pop songs&quot;. In July 2020, digital publication &quot;The Pudding&quot; carried out a study on the most iconic songs from the &#x27;90s and songs that are most known by Millennials and the people of Generation Z. &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot; was the song with the twelfth highest recognisability rate. In October 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked it 166th on its &quot;500 Best Pop Songs of All Time&quot;. The magazine praised its &quot;magic moment&quot;; &quot;The song&#x27;s climactic and heartbreaking final verse, when Coolio, born Artis Leon Ivey Jr., calls out, &quot;They say I gotta learn, but nobody’s here to teach me/ If they can&#x27;t understand me, how can they reach me? I guess they can&#x27;t. I guess they won&#x27;t … That&#x27;s why I know my life is out of luck, fool.&quot; Same year, &quot;PureWow&quot; ranked it number two in their list of &quot;The 53 Best 90s Songs of All Time&quot;.

== Parodies, covers, and sampling==
There are several parodies of the song, including &quot;Amish Paradise&quot; by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, which was released the following year, reaching number 53 on the U.S. chart. Coolio claimed that he did not give permission for the parody, which led to disagreements between the two. Yankovic claimed that he had been told Coolio had given the go-ahead through his record label, and apologized. Because of this incident, Yankovic now seeks approval for song parodies through the artists themselves, rather than communicating through intermediaries. Coolio himself said in a 2011 interview that he had since &quot;apologized to him (Yankovic)&quot;, further stating in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; retrospective that objecting to the parody &quot;was probably one of the least smart things I&#x27;ve done over the years.&quot;

L.V. released a solo version of the single in 1996 on his debut album, &quot;I Am L.V.&quot; This version did not feature Coolio, and featured additional lyrics written by L.V. himself, with rap lyrics written by Scarface and Dani Blooms.

In 1996, the song was covered by Battery for the electro-industrial various artists compilation &quot;Operation Beatbox&quot; and their 1996 album, &quot;Distance&quot;. American post-hardcore band In Fear And Faith covered the song in 2008. Austrian melodic death metal band Artas covered the song in 2008 on the album &quot;The Healing&quot;. In 2014, post-hardcore band Falling in Reverse covered the song for the compilation album &quot;Punk Goes 90s Vol. 2&quot;. The video included an appearance by Coolio. In 2015, Postmodern Jukebox produced a version in a 1920s jazz style. That same year, New Zealand hard rock band Like a Storm covered the song on their second studio album, &quot;Awaken the Fire&quot;.

The song&#x27;s chorus and bridge were prominently sampled by British singer Ella Henderson for her 2024 single &quot;Alibi&quot;.

<text>The University of Klagenfurt ( or &quot;Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt&quot;, AAU) is a federal Austrian research university and the largest research and higher education institution in the state of Carinthia. It has its campus in Klagenfurt.

Originally founded in 1970 and relaunched in 1993, the university today holds faculties of arts, humanities &amp; education, management, economics &amp; law, social sciences, and technical sciences. It is listed in the ARWU, THE, and QS global rankings and held rank 48 worldwide in THE&#x27;s &quot;Young University Rankings&quot; 2021.

The university has defined three research priority areas, &quot;Social Ecology&quot; (until 2018, transferred to BOKU Vienna), &quot;Networked and Autonomous Systems&quot;, and &quot;Multiple Perspectives in Optimization&quot;, with the former spawning three ERC Grants and the latter a &quot;doc.funds&quot; programme of the Austrian Science Fund. It has launched a new initiative, &quot;Humans in the Digital Age&quot; (HDA), in 2019, hosting an ERC Grant on cybersecurity.

It also holds a number of central facilities such as the Robert Musil Institute (co-organizer of the Bachmann Prize), the Karl Popper Kolleg (an Institute for Advanced Study), the University Cultural Centre (UNIKUM), the &quot;build!&quot; Gründerzentrum (a start-up facilitation center), the University Sports Centre (USI), and the Klagenfurt University Library.

Starting Dec 1, 2024, the university&#x27;s rector will be Ada Pellert, former rector of the University of Hagen, following Oliver Vitouch in this capacity. Martin Hitz chairs the Academic Senate; Werner Wutscher is chairman of the University Council.

The University of Klagenfurt is situated 30 km from the Slovenian and 60 km from the Italian border and supports bi- and multilingualism, especially in the context of the Slovenian minority in Carinthia. Together with the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano (Italy) and the University of Fribourg (Switzerland), it is among the three southernmost universities in the German-speaking world.

==History==



With the Protestant &quot;collegium sapientiae et pietatis&quot; founded in 1552, Klagenfurt hosted one of the oldest gymnasiums in Austria (today&#x27;s ), directed by Hieronymus Megiser from 1593 to 1601, but had no ancient university tradition.

In 1970, the Austrian parliament passed a federal law allowing the establishment of an Educational Science College in Klagenfurt. The first doctoral degree was conferred in 1972. In 1975, new laws on higher education came into force, with the name of the college being changed into &quot;Universität für Bildungswissenschaften&quot; (University of Educational Sciences).

In 1993, a fundamental relaunch took place: The institution&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Universität Klagenfurt&quot; (University of Klagenfurt), and a Faculty of Humanities and a (new) Faculty of Economics, Business Administration, and Informatics were inaugurated. The Faculty of Interdisciplinary Studies was inaugurated in 2004.

The university adopted the official cognomen &quot;Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt&quot; in 2004 (with its legal name still being &quot;Universität Klagenfurt&quot;). It was extended with a fourth, technical sciences faculty in 2007 (with a focus on Informatics, Information Technology, and Networked &amp; Autonomous Systems), engaging in research operations in collaboration with the &quot;Lakeside Science &amp; Technology Park&quot;. In 2012, the number of students passed the 10,000 mark.

On occasion of the institution&#x27;s 40th anniversary, a Boat Race was held on Lake Wörth in 2010. Klagenfurt&#x27;s Eight won against the University of Vienna by a boat length on a sprinting distance from the rowing clubs to .

In 2015, the university established commencement speeches at its graduation ceremonies. Among the speakers so far are Sabine Herlitschka, Josef Winkler, August-Wilhelm Scheer, , Josef Aschbacher, , and Christoph Grabenwarter. Presidents of Austria Heinz Fischer (formerly) and Alexander Van der Bellen (incumbent) are recurrent guests at doctoral graduations sub auspiciis Praesidentis.

In 2020, the university celebrated its institutional 50 year jubilee. This included a lecture series together with the Austrian Academy of Sciences, &quot;Utopia! Is the world out of joint? Contributions to the art of Enlightenment&quot; opened by Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger and the bestowal of an honorary doctorate to Rae Langton. Several further jubilee events were virtualized or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 22 November 2020 the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation showed the TV documentary &quot;Humans in the Digital Age: University of Klagenfurt—50th Anniversary&quot;.

The jubilee exhibition &quot;ARTEFICIA&quot; was postponed to autumn 2021. It shows unique exhibits from honorary doctors Manfred Bockelmann, Michael Guttenbrunner, Maja Haderlap, Peter Handke, Maria Lassnig, Valentin Oman, Wolfgang Puschnig, Peter Turrini, and Josef Winkler.

Technological developments of the University of Klagenfurt—leading contributions to the navigation system of the robotic helicopter &quot;Ingenuity&quot;—are part of NASAs Mars 2020 mission (Mars landing on 18 February 2021, maiden flight of the helicopter on 19 April 2021).

==Campus==
With its suburban setting, the university campus is in walking distance of both the renaissance-dominated historic city centre of Klagenfurt (capital of the state of Carinthia) and the east bay of the Wörthersee, a renowned Austrian summer resort. Also hiking, climbing and skiing possibilities in the Austrian Alps are nearby. 

Together with the adjacent &quot;Lakeside Science &amp; Technology Park&quot;, a 60 acres start-up and spin-off park, the university campus forms the so-called &quot;Lakeside District&quot;. The Park hosts companies such as ASFINAG, CISC Semiconductor, Dynatrace, Fraunhofer Austria, Infineon, Joanneum Research, Kapsch TrafficCom, PharmTElligent, and SKIDATA.

From 2016 to 2018, the university&#x27;s central and north wing (13,000 m2) were fully refurbished with a budget of €26 million. As a result, the university was shortlisted for the &quot;Prix Versailles – Campuses&quot; 2019 (under UNESCO patronage), together with buildings of the University of Chicago in Hongkong, Barnard College, Stanford University, SPA Vijayawada, and Skoltech, which won the competition. It is listed among the &quot;World’s Most Beautiful Campuses&quot; since 2023.

<doc id="1053559" wikidata="Q525713" url="?curid=1053559" title="Howard Pyle">
<text>Howard Pyle (March 5, 1853 – November 9, 1911) was an American illustrator, painter, and author, primarily of books for young people. He was a native of Wilmington, Delaware, and he spent the last year of his life in Florence, Italy.

In 1894, he began teaching illustration at the Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry (now Drexel University). Among his students there were Violet Oakley, Maxfield Parrish, and Jessie Willcox Smith. After 1900, he founded his own school of art and illustration named the Howard Pyle School of Illustration Art. Scholar Henry C. Pitz later used the term Brandywine School for the illustration artists and Wyeth family artists of the Brandywine region, several of whom had studied with Pyle. He had a lasting influence on a number of artists who became notable in their own right; N. C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, Thornton Oakley, Allen Tupper True, Stanley Arthurs, and numerous others studied under him.

His 1883 classic publication &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; remains in print, and his other books frequently have medieval European settings, including a four-volume set on King Arthur. He is also well known for his illustrations of pirates, and is credited with creating what has become the modern stereotype of pirate dress.
He published his first novel &quot;Otto of the Silver Hand&quot; in 1888. He also illustrated historical and adventure stories for periodicals such as &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;. His novel &quot;Men of Iron&quot; was adapted as the movie &quot;The Black Shield of Falworth&quot; (1954).

Pyle travelled to Florence, Italy in 1910 to study mural painting. He died there in 1911 of a sudden kidney infection (Bright&#x27;s disease).

==Life==
Pyle was born in Wilmington, Delaware, the son of William Pyle and Margaret Churchman Painter. As a child, he attended private schools and was interested in drawing and writing from a very young age. He was an indifferent student, but his parents encouraged him to study art, particularly his mother. He studied for three years at the studio of F. A. Van der Wielen in Philadelphia, and this constituted the whole of his artistic training, aside from a few lessons at the Art Students League of New York.

In 1876, he visited the island of Chincoteague off Virginia and was inspired by what he saw. He wrote and illustrated an article about the island and submitted it to &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. One of the magazine&#x27;s owners was Roswell Smith, who encouraged him to move to New York and pursue illustration professionally. Pyle initially struggled in New York; his lack of professional experience made it difficult for him to translate his ideas into forms for publication. He was encouraged by several working artists, however, including Edwin Austin Abbey, A. B. Frost, and Frederick S. Church.

He finally published a double-paged spread in the &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; issue of March 9, 1878 and was paid $75—five times what he had expected. He became increasingly successful and was an established artist by the time that he returned to Wilmington in 1880. Pyle continued illustrating for magazines. He also collaborated on several books, particularly in American history. He wrote and illustrated his own stories, beginning with &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; in 1883. This book won international attention from critics such as William Morris. Over the following decades, he published many more illustrated works for children, many of which are still in print today.

Pyle married singer Anne Poole on April 12, 1881, and the couple had seven children. In 1889, he and his wife sailed to Jamaica, leaving their children in the care of relatives. While they were overseas, their son Sellers died unexpectedly. This loss likely inspired his children&#x27;s book &quot;The Garden Behind the Moon&quot;, which is about death and bears the dedication: &quot;To the little Boy in the Moon Garden This Book is dedicated by His Father.&quot;

From 1894 to 1900, he taught illustration at the Drexel Institute. In 1900, he created his own school in Wilmington where he taught a small number of students in depth. In 1903, Pyle painted his first murals for the Delaware Art Museum. He took up mural painting more seriously in 1906 and painted &quot;The Battle of Nashville&quot; in Saint Paul, as well as two other murals for courthouses in New Jersey (the Essex and Hudson County Courthouses).

Pyle developed his own ideas for illustrating pirate dress, as few examples existed of authentic pirate outfits and few, if any, drawings had been preserved. He created a flamboyant style incorporating elements of Romani dress. His work influenced the design of costumes for movie pirates from Errol Flynn to Johnny Depp. It has been noted as highly impractical for working sailors.

In 1910, Pyle and his family went to Italy where he planned to study the old masters. Suffering poor health, he felt depressed and drained of energy. After one year in the country, he suffered a kidney infection and died in Florence at the age of 58.

In 1937, his niece, Caroline Ashton Pyle married his student N. C. Wyeth&#x27;s son Nathaniel Convers Wyeth.

==Major works==
Pyle wrote and illustrated a number of books, in addition to numerous illustrations done for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, other periodical publications, and various works of fiction for children and young adults.

===&quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;===
Pyle synthesized many traditional Robin Hood legends and ballads in this work, while toning them down to make them suitable for children. For instance, he modified the late 17th century ballad &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Progress to Nottingham&quot;, changing it from Robin killing fourteen foresters for not honoring a bet to Robin defending himself against an attempt on his life by one of the foresters. Pyle has Robin kill only two men, one who shoots at him first when he was a youth, the other a hated assassin named Guy of Gisborne whom the Sheriff sent to slay him. Tales are changed in which Robin steals all that an ambushed traveler carried, such as &quot;Robin Hood and the Bishop of Hereford&quot;, so that the victim keeps a third and another third is dedicated to the poor.

Pyle did not have much concern for historical accuracy, but he renamed the queen in the story &quot;Robin Hood and Queen Katherine&quot; as Eleanor (of Aquitaine). This made her compatible historically with King Richard the Lion-Hearted, with whom Robin eventually makes peace.

Many of the tales in the Robin Hood book dated to the late Middle Ages. His achievement was to integrate them into a unified story, which he also illustrated. For example, he included &quot;Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar&quot; in the narrative order to reintroduce Friar Tuck. He needed a cooperative priest for the wedding of outlaw Allan a Dale to his sweetheart Ellen. In the original &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;, the life is saved of an anonymous wrestler who had won a bout but was likely to be murdered because he was a stranger. Pyle adapted it and gave the wrestler the identity of David of Doncaster, one of Robin&#x27;s band in the story &quot;Robin Hood and the Golden Arrow&quot;. In his novelistic treatment of the tales, he thus developed several characters who had been mentioned in only one ballad, such as David of Doncaster or Arthur a Bland.

===&quot;Men of Iron&quot;===
&quot;Men of Iron&quot; is an 1891 novel about squire Myles Falworth who hopes to become a knight, thereby redeeming his family&#x27;s honor. His father was falsely implicated in a plot to kill King Henry IV. The adventure tale follows Myles through his intensive training for knighthood and ends with him becoming a knight and challenging the wicked Lord Brookhurst Alban to trial by combat.

The novel was adapted into the 1954 film &quot;The Black Shield of Falworth&quot; starring Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh.

===Other works===
* &quot;Otto of the Silver Hand&quot;, about the son of a robber baron during the medieval period.
* &quot;Rejected of Men: A Story of To-day&quot; (1903), setting the story of Jesus as if it had occurred during early twentieth-century America.
* &quot;Portfolio of Etchings&quot;: In 1903 the Bibliophile Society of Boston commissioned Pyle to create a series of paintings of scholars and bibliophiles for a limited, four-volume set of books titled &quot;&quot;. The paintings proved popular and the Bibliophile Society commissioned American engraver to create copper etched copies of Pyle&#x27;s five oil paintings from &quot;The Bibliomania&quot; books. The etched prints in the &quot;Portfolio of Etchings&quot; from the Special Collections and Archives at Albertsons Library, BSU, portray the following literary figures:
The remaining etchings are titled: “Friar” Bacon in His Study, and &quot;Izaak&quot; Walton
* &quot;The Wonder Clock&quot; (1887), a collection of twenty-four tales, one for each hour of the day. Each tale was prefaced by a whimsical verse telling of traditional household goings-on at that hour. His sister Katharine Pyle wrote the verses. Pyle created the tales based on traditional European folktales. 
* &quot;Pepper and Salt, or Seasoning for Young Folk&quot;, traditional tales for younger readers which he also illustrated.
* After his death, a publisher collected a number of his pirate stories and illustrations and published them as &quot;Howard Pyle&#x27;s Book of Pirates&quot; (1921).

==Critical response==
Pyle was widely respected during his life and continues to be well regarded by illustrators and fine artists. His contemporary Vincent van Gogh wrote in a letter to his brother Theo that Pyle&#x27;s work &quot;struck me dumb with admiration.&quot;

Pyle&#x27;s reputation stems from his innovation in form and illustration, creating an American school of illustration and art, and for the revival of children&#x27;s books. His illustrations are vivid and imaginative, yet not overly fantastic or contrived, lending them an air of colorful realism. &quot;Twentieth-Century Literary Criticism&quot; notes:

As time passed, Pyle&#x27;s historical position as the founder of a distinctly American school of illustration and art, as the innovator who introduced the total-design approach, and as the great reinventor of children&#x27;s books, would outshine any single work he did, so that he is remembered less for any one project than for his total stance.

He had a lasting influence on a number of artists who became notable in their own right. Some of his more notable students were N. C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, Elenore Abbott, Ethel Franklin Betts, Anna Whelan Betts, Harvey Dunn, Clyde O. DeLand, Philip R. Goodwin, Thornton Oakley, Violet Oakley, Ellen Bernard Thompson Pyle, Olive Rush, Blanche Grant, Ethel Leach, Allen Tupper True, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Arthur E. Becher, William James Aylward, Jessie Willcox Smith, and Charlotte Harding. Pyle taught his students at his home and studio in Wilmington, which is still standing and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Pyle was an early member of The Franklin Inn Club in Philadelphia.

According to Robert Vitz, the Howard Pyle School of Art developed a common set of themes in its work: attention to realism and expression of optimism and a faith in the goodness of America. His work also continued to inspire well after his death; for example, comic book artist Tony Harris (born 1969) has cited Pyle as a major influence on his work.

Pyle is remembered primarily as an illustrator, but his books have also been analyzed for their literary qualities, particularly &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;. Taimi M. Ranta and Jill P. May have examined their influence on children&#x27;s literature. May writes from a feminist sensibility. Susan F. Beegel has studied his influence on Ernest Hemingway. Alethia Helbig has reviewed his poetry, which since his death has not been as highly valued as it was in his own time.

Malcolm Usrey wrote that &quot;Otto of the Silver Hand&quot;

has all the marks of a good historical novel: it has an exciting plot, with ample conflict and believable characters; it uses language and dialect appropriate to its setting and the characters; it has a significant, universal theme, and it presents the details of daily life in Germany of the thirteenth century accurately and unobtrusively, making the period real and alive.

<text>Mert and Marcus is the working name of two fashion photographers, Mert Alaş (born 1971) and Marcus Piggott (born 1971), who work together on a collaborative basis. Their work and style is influenced by photographer Guy Bourdin and, together, they have pioneered the use of digital manipulation within their field.

== Career ==
Mert Alaş, born in Turkey and Marcus Piggott, born in Wales, met in England in 1994 after having worked for a brief period in different areas, Alaş in classical music and Piggott in graphic design. Piggott was an assistant photographer and Alas was a fashion photo modeler. After working together in the photography business, they decided to create a team. When they showed their first photos to &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, the London fashion magazine, they immediately made the cover.

The team has worked for such magazines as &quot;Vogue, Vogue Paris, Vogue Italia, Interview, Love, W, Pop Magazine, Numéro&quot; and &quot;Arena Homme +.&quot; Some of their major clients have included fashion labels such as Dior, Louis Vuitton, Missoni, Giorgio Armani, Roberto Cavalli, Fendi, Kenzo and Miu Miu. They have created the images for perfume houses such as Gucci, Yves St Laurent, Givenchy and Lancôme.

Alas and Piggott have also worked with celebrities including Madonna, Marion Cotillard, Cara Delevingne, Adele, Adriana Lima, Lady Gaga, Julia Roberts, Rihanna, Shakira, Jennifer Lopez, Linda Evangelista, Gisele Bündchen, Björk, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Lindsay Lohan, Scarlett Johansson, Charlotte Rampling, Bella Hadid, Kylie Minogue, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Victoria Beckham, and have shot album covers for Fergie, Taylor Swift and Nicki Minaj.

They created the cover art for Rob Dougan&#x27;s 2002 CD &quot;Furious Angels&quot;.

In 2015, Mert &amp; Marcus were awarded Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society. 

In 2018, Mert &amp; Marcus won the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator.

<doc id="1053576" wikidata="Q522440" url="?curid=1053576" title="John Gray (philosopher)">
<text>John Nicholas Gray (born 17 April 1948) is an English political philosopher and author with interests in analytic philosophy, the history of ideas, and philosophical pessimism. He retired in 2008 as School Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Gray contributes regularly to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;UnHerd&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, where he is the lead book reviewer. He is an atheist.

Gray has written several influential books, including &quot;False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism&quot; (1998), which argues that free market globalisation is an unstable Enlightenment project currently in the process of disintegration; &quot;Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals&quot; (2002), which attacks philosophical humanism, a worldview which Gray sees as originating in religions; and &quot;Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia&quot; (2007), a critique of utopian thinking in the modern world.

Gray sees volition, and hence morality, as an illusion, and portrays humanity as a ravenous species engaged in wiping out other forms of life. Gray has written that &quot;humans ... cannot destroy the Earth, but they can easily wreck the environment that sustains them.&quot;

==Academic career==
Gray was born into a working-class family, with a docker-turned-carpenter father, in South Shields, County Durham. He attended South Shields Grammar-Technical School for Boys from 1959 until 1967, then studied at Exeter College, Oxford, reading philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), completing his B.A., M.Phil. and D.Phil.

He formerly held posts as lecturer in political theory at the University of Essex, fellow and tutor in politics at Jesus College, Oxford, and lecturer and then professor of politics at the University of Oxford. He has served as a visiting professor at Harvard University (1985–86) and Stranahan Fellow at the Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green State University (1990–1994), and has also held visiting professorships at Tulane University&#x27;s Murphy Institute (1991) and Yale University (1994). He was Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics and Political Science until his retirement from academic life in early 2008.

==Political and philosophical thought==

Among philosophers, he is known for a thoroughgoing rejection of Rawlsianism and for exploration of the uneasy relationship between value pluralism and liberalism in the work of Isaiah Berlin.

Gray&#x27;s political thought is noted for its mobility across the political spectrum over the years. As a student, Gray was on the left and continued to vote Labour into the mid-1970s. By 1976 he had shifted towards a right-liberal New Right position, on the basis that the world was changing irrevocably through technological inventions, realigned financial markets and new economic power blocs and that the left failed to comprehend the magnitude and nature of this change. In the 1990s Gray became an advocate for environmentalism and New Labour. Gray considers the conventional (left-wing/right-wing) political spectrum of conservatism and social democracy as no longer viable.

On liberalism, Gray identified the common strands in liberal thought as being &quot;individualist&quot;, &quot;egalitarian&quot;, &quot;meliorist&quot;, and &quot;universalist&quot;. The individualist element avers the ethical primacy of the human being against the pressures of social collectivism, the egalitarian element assigns the same moral worth and status to all individuals, the meliorist element asserts that successive generations can improve their sociopolitical arrangements, and the universalist element affirms the moral unity of the human species and marginalises local cultural differences.

More recently, he has criticised neoliberalism, the global free market and some of the central currents in Western thinking, such as humanism, while moving towards aspects of green thought, drawing on the Gaia theory of James Lovelock. It is perhaps for this critique of humanism that Gray is best known.

Central to the doctrine of humanism, in Gray&#x27;s view, is the inherently utopian belief in meliorism; that is, that humans are not limited by their biological natures and that advances in ethics and politics are cumulative and that they can alter or improve the human condition, in the same way that advances in science and technology have altered or improved living standards.

Gray contends, in opposition to this view, that history is not progressive, but cyclical. Human nature, he argues, is an inherent obstacle to cumulative ethical or political progress. Seeming improvements, if there are any, can very easily be reversed: one example he has cited has been the use of torture by the United States against terrorist suspects. &quot;What&#x27;s interesting&quot;, Gray said in an interview in &quot;032c&quot; magazine, &quot;is that torture not only came back, but was embraced by liberals, and defended by liberals. Now there are a lot of people, both liberal and conservative, who say, &#x27;Well, it&#x27;s a very complicated issue.&#x27; But it wasn&#x27;t complicated until recently. They didn&#x27;t say that five or ten years ago.&quot;

Furthermore, he argues that this belief in progress, commonly imagined to be secular and liberal, is in fact derived from an erroneous Christian notion of humans as morally autonomous beings categorically different from other animals. This belief, and the corresponding idea that history makes sense, or is progressing towards something, is in Gray&#x27;s view merely a Christian prejudice.

In &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; he argues that the idea that humans are self-determining agents does not pass the acid test of experience. Those Darwinist thinkers who believe humans can take charge of their own destiny to prevent environmental degradation are, in this view, not naturalists, but apostles of humanism.

He identifies the Enlightenment as the point at which the Christian doctrine of salvation was taken over by secular idealism and became a political religion with universal emancipation as its aim. Communism, fascism and &quot;global democratic capitalism&quot; are characterised by Gray as Enlightenment &quot;projects&quot; which have led to needless suffering, in Gray&#x27;s view, as a result of their ideological allegiance to this religion.

===Agonistic liberalism===
The term agonistic liberalism appears in Gray&#x27;s 1995 book &quot;Isaiah Berlin&quot;. Gray uses this phrase to describe what he believes is Berlin&#x27;s theory of politics, namely his support for both value pluralism and liberalism.

More generally, agonistic liberalism could be used to describe any kind of liberalism that claims its own value commitments do not form a complete vision of politics and society, and that one instead needs to look for what Berlin calls an &quot;uneasy equilibrium&quot; between competing values. In Gray&#x27;s view, many contemporary liberal theorists would fall into this category, for instance John Rawls and Karl Popper.

== Reception ==

=== Acclaim ===
Gray&#x27;s work has been praised by, amongst others, the novelists J. G. Ballard, Will Self and John Banville, the theologian Don Cupitt, the journalist Bryan Appleyard, the political scientist David Runciman, historian and cultural critic Morris Berman, investor and philanthropist George Soros, the environmental scientist James Lovelock and the author Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

Friedrich Hayek described Gray&#x27;s 1984 book &quot;Hayek on Liberty&quot; as &quot;The first survey of my work which not only fully understands but is able to carry on my ideas beyond the point at which I left off.&quot;

His 1998 book &quot;False Dawn&quot; was praised by George Soros as &quot;a powerful analysis of the deepening instability of global capitalism&quot; which &quot;should be read by all who are concerned about the future of the global economy&quot;. John Banville praised &quot;Black Mass&quot;, saying that &quot;Gray&#x27;s assault on Enlightenment ideas of progress is timelier than ever&quot;.

His 2002 book &quot;Straw Dogs: Thoughts on Humans and Other Animals&quot; has received particular praise. J. G. Ballard wrote that the book &quot;challenges most of our assumptions about what it means to be human, and convincingly shows that most of them are delusions&quot; and described it &quot;a powerful and brilliant book&quot;, &quot;an essential guide to the new millennium&quot; and &quot;the most exhilarating book I have read since Richard Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;.&quot; Will Self called the book &quot;a contemporary work of philosophy devoid of jargon, wholly accessible, and profoundly relevant to the rapidly evolving world we live in&quot; and wrote &quot;I read it once, I read it twice and took notes. I arranged to meet its author so I could publicise the book – I thought it that good.&quot;

In 2002 &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; was named a book of the year by J. G. Ballard in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;; by George Walden in &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;; by Will Self, Joan Bakewell, Jason Cowley and David Marquand in the &quot;New Statesman&quot;; by Andrew Marr in &quot;The Observer&quot;; by Jim Crace in &quot;The Times&quot;; by Hugh Lawson Tancred in &quot;The Spectator&quot;; by Richard Holloway in the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot;; and by Sue Cook in &quot;The Sunday Express&quot;.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written that John Gray is the modern thinker for whom he has the most respect, calling him &quot;prophetic&quot;.

=== Criticism ===
Gray&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; has been criticised by Terry Eagleton, who has written: &quot;mixing nihilism and New Ageism in equal measure, Gray scoffs at the notion of progress for 150 pages before conceding that there is something to be said for anaesthetics. The enemy in his sights is not so much a straw dog as a straw man: the kind of starry-eyed rationalist who passed away with John Stuart Mill, but who he has to pretend still rules the world&quot;.

The academic and author Danny Postel of the University of Denver also took issue with &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. Postel stated that Gray&#x27;s claim that environmental destruction was the result of humanity&#x27;s flawed nature would be &quot;welcome news to the captains of industry and the architects of the global economy; the ecological devastation they leave in their wake, according to Gray, has nothing to do with their exploits.&quot; Postel also claimed that too much of &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; rested on &quot;blanket assertion&quot;, and criticised Gray&#x27;s use of the term &quot;plague of people&quot; as an outdated &quot;neo-Malthusian persiflage about overpopulation&quot;. Postel strongly condemned Gray for outlining &quot;complete political passivity. There is no point whatsoever in our attempting to make the world a less cruel or more livable place.&quot;

In his 2004 book, &quot;How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World&quot;, the British journalist, writer and broadcaster, Francis Wheen, wrote:

==BBC Radio==

John Gray has made several broadcasts for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s programme &quot;A Point of View&quot;.

In August and September 2011, he made six broadcasts:
* &quot;Greece and the Meaning of Folly&quot;: Taking the myth of the Trojan Horse as his starting point, he explores what he sees as the modern-day folly unfolding in Europe.
* &quot;Kim Philby&quot;: Why Kim Philby and so many others failed to predict the future.
* &quot;The Revolution of Capitalism&quot;: Why an increasing number of people believe that Karl Marx was right.
* &quot;Cats, Birds and Humans&quot;: Why the human animal needs contact with something other than itself.
* &quot;Believing in Belief&quot;: Argues that the scientific and rationalist attack on religion is misguided.
* &quot;Churchill, Chance and the Black Dog&quot;: The chance encounters that made Winston Churchill Britain&#x27;s wartime Prime Minister.

He presented a second sequence from November 2014, sharing his &quot;Point of View&quot; on:

<text>Pomerode () is a Brazilian municipality in the state of Santa Catarina, in Southern Brazil. It is located in the valley of the Itajaí-Açu river, not very far from the city of Blumenau, one of the largest cities in the state.

Pomerode is known as the &quot;most German city in Brazil&quot;, because the vast majority of its inhabitants are of German descent and are bilingual in German and Portuguese. The East Pomeranian dialect of Low German is also used by the community.

==History and the local language==
Pomerode was founded by Pomeranians in 1861 and is considered the &quot;most typically German of all German towns of southern Brazil&quot;.

One very remarkable characteristic about Pomerode is the fact that 90% of its residents speak German. There is also a group of people in the community who speak the East Pomeranian dialect of Low German.

==Ethnic composition==
&quot;Source: IBGE 2010. &quot;

==Religion==
&quot;Source: IBGE 2010. &quot;

Lutherans are 63.76% of the population, as German Pomerania was traditionally overwhelmingly Lutheran. Over time, some of the Pomeranians converted to Catholicism, and Catholics from the rest of Brazil moved into the town.

==Tourism and economy==

Pomerode has a long history developing its manufacturing industry like other cities in the region. It is also located in a very rich agricultural valley. Additionally, in the last few decades the creation and development of the tourist industry has become a priority. To accomplish that, great efforts are being made to reinforce and celebrate the pioneering roots of the local inhabitants.

The tourist industry of nearby Blumenau (about away) is very well developed attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors annually to its festivals such as Oktoberfest of Blumenau, the largest one in the world after the original festival in Munich. Naturally, this has generated a very positive impact on the tourist industry of much smaller Pomerode.

In addition to tourism the economy is dependent on industry, which includes knitted clothing, plastic articles, state of the art metal and mechanical industries, garments and cloth, and furniture.

== Notable people ==
* Hans Fischer (1961 in Pomerode – 1988) a Brazilian cyclist, he competed at the 1980 and 1984 Summer Olympics

<text>Vila do Porto (; &quot;Port Town&quot;) is the single municipality, the name of the main town and one of the civil parishes on the island of Santa Maria, in the Portuguese archipelago of Azores. Its nearest neighbor, administratively, is the municipality of Povoação on the southern coast of São Miguel (to the northwest), and it is physically southwest of the islets of the Formigas. The population in 2021 was 5,408, in an area of .

== History ==
Santa Maria was the first island in the archipelago to be discovered by Diogo Silves in 1427. By 2 July 1439, a royal charter from Infante D. Pedro, regent of D. Afonso V, referred to the fact that Prince Henry the Navigator had ordered that sheep be set ashore along the seven islands of the Azores (since Corvo and Flores had, at the time, not been discovered). São Miguel and Santa Maria were the first islands to be settled by families from Estremadura, Alto Alentejo and Algarve, facilitated by Gonçalo Velho, then first donatary-captain of the Azores. Gonçalo Velho Cabral, nobleman in the House of the Infante D. Henrique (Henry the Navigator) and commander in the Order of Christ, arrived on the island of Santa Maria in 1432. In the cartography of the 14th Century, the island was referred to as Ilha dos Lobos (&quot;Island of Wolves&quot;, referring to the wolf seals that lived in the region at the time). It became the seat of the first Captaincy of the Azores, which initially included both Santa Maria and São Miguel.

Its first settlement originated in 1439, with the occupation of &quot;Praia dos Lobos&quot; (and eventually became the northern coastal village of Anjos). Around 1450, was the probably foundation of the settlement of Porto, by Fernão de Quental. Quental&#x27;s colony was established along the south coast along an escarpment overlooking a small bay that afforded protection for ships: what would become known as the &quot;Vila do Porto&quot; (&quot;town of the port&quot;). This town would become incorporated in 1470, when the town of Porto received the obligatory and first foral (&quot;charter&quot;), in addition to the establishment of the first lighthouse in the Azores. Although never experiencing earthquakes since its initial settlement (in comparison to the other islands in the Azores), the community was always marked by isolation, inaccessibility and weak defensive position.

It was, by the beginning of the 17th century, the fortification of São Brás along the cliff-tops of Cimo da Rocha, was constructed, near the hermitage dedicated to &quot;Our Lady of the Conception&quot;.

In 1901, it received an official visit from King Carlos I of Portugal and Queen Amélie, and later that year elected the first Republican municipal government.

Between 1942 and 1944, in the context of the Second World War, the airport was constructed to provide support and emergency facilities for the island. This airport was transferred to the Portuguese Air Force in 1946, and the barrio (&quot;Bairro do Aeroporto&quot;) was begun by architect Keil do Amaral.

On 21 October 1992, the historical centre was protected, a zone delimited by Vila do Porto, under Regional Legislative Decree 22/92/A. By 24 August 2004, a new document was published by the regional legislature (Decree 29/2004/A), that set out the jurisdictional regime to protect, conserve and promote the cultural heritage; classified under article 58, the &quot;historic centre&quot; of Vila do Porto, was reclassified as a &quot;Group of Public Interest&quot;, and the older protections revoked.

== Geography ==

The municipality covers the entirety of the island of Santa Maria, in the eastern edge of the archipelago of the Azores. Nascently a coastal municipality, the settlements are nonetheless located over a cliff-top platform, dominated in the west by a semi-arid plain and in the east by the hugged flanks of the Pico Alto mountainous ridge. Although its principal urban area is located along linear tracts in the southwestern coast (oriented north to south), there exist various urban settlements and agglomerations throughout the island.

The municipality incorporates the island of Santa Maria in its entirety, and is divided into five parishes (population in 2021):
* Almagreira – 617 residents / 
* Santa Bárbara – 370 residents / 
* Santo Espírito – 597 residents /

<text>Glanfurt is a river of Carinthia, Austria. Its drainage basin is .

The Glanfurt is also called &quot;Sattnitz&quot; by the Carinthian people. It is the outflow of the Wörthersee. It starts at the lake&#x27;s eastern bay, south of the peninsula Maria Loretto and runs more like a channel straight to the east. It passes Viktring Abbey, an old monastery which is now a suburb of Carinthia&#x27;s capital Klagenfurt, and finally flows into the Glan near the market town of Ebenthal. In summer it is the southern recreation area of Klagenfurt with a number of opportunities for free bathing and a bicycle track along the river.

The river was to become a national borderline following the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, which then had not been established according to the results of the 1920 Carinthian Plebiscite.

<text>Katherine Augusta Westcott Tingley (July 6, 1847 – July 11, 1929) was a social worker and prominent Theosophist. She led the American Section of the Theosophical Society after W. Q. Judge. She founded and led the Theosophical community Lomaland in Point Loma, San Diego.

==Early life==
Tingley was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, on July 6, 1847, the daughter of James P. and Susan Westcott, of early colonial ancestry.

==Career==
She was employed as a social worker in New York City when she met William Quan Judge. She joined the Theosophical Society on October 13, 1894.

In 1895, disputes between Judge and Annie Besant led to a split, with Judge taking most of the American section with him. After converting Tingley to Theosophy, Judge appointed her as the Outer Head of the Theosophical Society. became the new head of the Universal Brotherhood and Theosophical Society, although her identity was concealed for one year. In 1898, a group of roughly 200 theosophists led by Ernest Temple Hargrove seceded from Tingley&#x27;s organization, and formed a rival group based in New York City. 
She conducted two theosophical crusades around the world. She was the founder of the International Brotherhood League, and also of the Summer Home for Children, Spring Valley, New Jersey, of a home for orphan children in Point Loma, California, and of several academies for boys and girls in Cuba. She did relief and emergency hospital work after the Spanish–American War and was instrumental in establishing hospitals in Manila and Cuba.

On February 13, 1900, she transferred the Society&#x27;s international headquarters from New York City to a new colony she called Lomaland, located in the Point Loma community near San Diego, California. Her settlement included Raja-Yoga School and College, Theosophical University, and the School for the Revival of the Lost Mysteries of Antiquity.

In 1901, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; printed a story entitled &quot;Outrages at Point Loma; Exposed by an ‘Escape’ from Tingley. Startling Tales told in this City. Women and Children Starved and Treated Like Convicts. Thrilling Rescue.&quot; It made various claims against Tingley, and she immediately filed a lawsuit against the paper for libel and won the following year, resulting in other papers being much more reluctant to attack her publicly.

In 1913 she founded the Parliament of Peace and Universal Brotherhood and in 1919 the Theosophical University at Point Loma. She established several theosophical branch centers in America and in Europe, and also a summer school for children at Visingsoe, Sweden. She was the editor of the Theosophical Path. Many theosophical magazines were published under her direction in Germany, Holland and Sweden. She was the author of &quot;Theosophy and Some of the Vital Problems of the Day,&quot; &quot;Marriage and the Home,&quot; &quot;Theosophy, the Path of the Mystic.&quot; 
==Personal life==
In 1888 she married Philo B. Tingley, inventor, and lived at Point Loma, California.
==Legacy==
After her death, her successors transferred the society to Covina, California and then to Pasadena, where it currently exists.

Yousra made a number of the serial television dramas popular during Ramadan, including 2005&#x27;s &quot;Ahlam &#x27;Adiya&quot; (&quot;Ordinary Dreams&quot;). She portrayed an enterprising con woman in what the English version of Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; called “a major departure from the star&#x27;s usual Ramadan screen persona, which has consistently verged on the romantic and the demure.&quot;

In 2006, she took a supporting role in &quot;The Yacoubian Building&quot;, a star-laden adaptation of the novel of the same name. The film is reported to have had the highest budget of any Egyptian production to date. Playing an entertainer working in a restaurant, Yousra, according to &quot;Variety&quot;, “effortlessly stirs old emotional waters when she sings &#x27;La Vie en rose.&#x27;&quot; Yousra released her first vocal album in 2002. She featured in Abu&#x27;s hit single &quot;3 Daqat&quot; in 2017. In 2018, she acted in &quot;Ladayna Akwalon Okhra (We Have Another Statement)&quot;. In 2019, Yousra and Saba Mubarak starred in a photo session for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar Arabia&quot;, and both Arab actresses wore elegant evening gowns. In 2020, she starred in &quot;Saheb Al Maqam&quot;, her first film in eight years. 

== Personal life ==

<text>Tetovo (, ; , ) is a city in the northwestern part of North Macedonia, built on the foothills of Šar Mountain and divided by the Pena River. The municipality of Tetovo covers an area of at above sea level, with a population of 63,176. The city of Tetovo is the seat of Tetovo Municipality. 

Tetovo was founded in the 14th century on the place of the ancient town of Oaeneon.

In the 15th c. AD, Tetovo came under Ottoman rule for about five centuries. After its conquest by the Ottomans, most of city&#x27;s population converted to Islam and many Ottoman-style structures were built, such as the Šarena Džamija and the Arabati Baba Teḱe, which still stand as two of North Macedonia&#x27;s most significant landmarks of its Ottoman period. During this period, the town belonged to the Vilayet of Kosovo, became a firearm and cannon foundry, and was renamed Kalkandelen (meaning Shield Penetrator); as a result, the town attracted many workers and grew to a city. Following the World Wars, Tetovo became a part of Yugoslavia and, later, the Republic of Macedonia.

South East European University, North Macedonia&#x27;s third largest university after Skopje and Bitola, is located in Tetovo. Tetovo is also home to the State University of Tetovo. Tetovo is regarded as the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Albanian population in North Macedonia.

== Name ==
The region was referred to as &quot;Htetovo&quot; in a Serbian Charter. During the Ottoman rule the name of the town was Kalkandelen.

==History==

===Early antiquity===
===Roman period===

Christianity spread to Oaeneum during the later period of Roman invasion and reached the region relatively early. St Paul preached the Gospel in the region. In the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the main language to spread the Christian religion was Latin.

===Middle Ages===
In the 13th and 14th centuries, Byzantine control was punctuated by periods of Bulgarian and Serbian rule. Konstantin Asen ruled as Tsar of the Bulgarian Empire from 1257 to 1277. Later the region was overrun and taken by Serbian Tsar Stefan Dušan. In a document dated between 1348 and 1353, Dušan restored the Lešok Monastery and gifted the monastery entire Albanian-populated villages, as well as the Nanov Dol highlands. Stefan Dušan also forbade agricultural and livestock activity in the Nanov Dol highlands for state pasture tax collectors, Albanians and Vlachs.

The initial Ottoman occupation did not last as Skanderbeg and his Albanian force with aid from Tetovo, took on the Ottoman forces led by Ibrahim Pasha in the Battle of Polog. Skanderbeg slayed Ibrahim Pasha, who was an old friend of his during his time with the Ottomans. Tetovo came under Albanian control. In August 1462, after Skanderbeg defeated Ottoman forces under Hasan bey in Mokra, Isuf bey went to move against Skanderbeg. Isuf bey marched out with 18,000 troops to Skopje. From there, he marched onto Polog near Tetovo. Skanderbeg attacked and annihilated Isuf&#x27;s force and the Pasha fled, leaving his army behind to be reduced.

===Ottoman Period===

In the 1660s Evliya Celebi considered the highlands around Tetovo as being the mountains of Arnavudluk (Albania).
During the early 19th century, Abdurrahman Pasha, a prominent Albanian landowner, beautified the city of Tetovo, refurbishing many estates including the notable landmarks such as the Colored Mosque, the Teke and the Baltepe fortress. In the 19th century, the Russian diplomat Ivan Jastrebov spoke highly of Tetovo&#x27;s climate, liking the mild snowy winters, sunny and comfortably warm summers. The traveler Ami Bue described Tetovo as a very clean city.

The Tanzimat reforms, initiated by the Ottoman Empire in 1839, sought to modernize and centralize the administration by imposing new taxes and diminishing the power of local feudal magnates, while appointing administrators from Anatolia to oversee the provinces. These changes, however, faced strong opposition, particularly local Albanian pashas. In 1843, the arrest of key Albanian leaders who resisted the reforms triggered an uprising that resulted in the expulsion of Ottoman officials from several major towns. After three weeks of intense fighting, the rebels captured Kalkandelen (modern-day Tetovo), which subsequently became the headquarters of the Albanian Great Council. The Council demanded the annulment of the Tanzimat reforms, challenging the central government&#x27;s authority. In response, the sultan dispatched Omer Pasha with a force of 30,000 troops to suppress the rebellion. Following a prolonged siege of Kalkandelen, lasting several weeks, the Ottoman forces captured the town, arrested the rebel leaders, and effectively ended the uprising.

Albanian diplomat Mid&#x27;hat Frashëri, in his work &quot;Pjesa kombiare&quot; writes that due to the pressure of Turkey, Greece and Serbia, a part of the Albanian population lost their mother tongue. &quot;The people of Gjinokastra speak Greek and in Tetovo and Prizren [they speak] Turkish and Slavic&quot;.

===During the World Wars===
During the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Tetovo came under Albanian control by forces led by Hasan Prishtina. From a period between 1913 and 1915, during the Balkan war, the Serbian Army captured Tetovo and the entire region of what is today North Macedonia became known as &quot;South Serbia&quot; as part of the Kingdom of Serbia.

During World War I, a rift occurred between Bulgaria and Serbia. The Bulgarian army started making way through the area and annexed Tetovo and the rest of the Macedonia region. At the end of the war Serbia regained control of the region. Within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Tetovo was part of the Vardar Banovina from 1929 to 1941. 

In 1941, the Vardar Banovina ceased to exist as a result of the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia. The western region, predominantly inhabited by Albanians, was incorporated into the Italian protected Kingdom of Albania, resulting in Tetovo once again coming under Albanian control. The Italian military intelligence service, OVRA, established the &quot;Luboten Battalion&quot; in Tetovo, composed primarily of ethnic Albanians from the region. The unit was tasked with identifying, interrogating, and neutralizing any resistance to the Italian occupation. Following Italy&#x27;s surrender on September 8, 1943, the German forces retained control over the battalion, permitting its members to retain their Italian-issued uniforms and weapons. Subsequently, members of the Balli Kombëtar, an Albanian nationalist group, joined the battalion, further strengthening its ranks.

The Balli Kombëtar ruled Tetovo with military and financial aid from the Axis powers. The Albanian national flag was raised in Tetovo, the Albanian Franc was introduced as the official currency as well as the official language and education facilities in Albanian.

Against the background of a large-scale offensive operations of the Bulgarian army aimed at Nis, Skopje and Pristina, the city was the last to be seized by the Macedonian partisans on November 19, 1944. Several Macedonian partisan shock brigades fought for control of the city with German forces and the Balli Kombëtar. Part of the fighters were ethnic Macedonians that split from ELAS to form the First Macedonian Shock Brigade. According to Macedonian veterans from the 8th Veles Shock Brigade who participated in the fighting, the operation in Tetovo was well-planned and the enemy resistance was weakened due to the inevitability of the German defeat and the good organization and equipment of the partisans.

After the Germans had been driven out, the communist authorities ordered the collection of weapons but this order was not well received. In Tetovo, the remaining Ballists tried to retain their control after the Yugoslav Partisans announced victory. As result an armed uprising of massive proportions broke in the area led by the Balli Kombëtar, which aimed to resist the incorporation of the region into communist Yugoslavia. It was only in July 1945 that the Yugoslav Partisans were able to push down the uprising and re-establish their control.

===SFR Yugoslavia===
The town became part of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The early years of Socialist Yugoslavia were turbulent for Tetovo&#x27;s Albanian population. Many were subjected to repression, causing many to emigrate. Those who remained demonstrated periodically but violently against the socialist Yugoslav regime, notably in the Yucel Incident of 1957 and the Tetovo Incident of 1968. Many of these protest were led by Mehmet Gega, a notable Albanian rights activist who was sentenced to ten years in prison.

Tetovo under Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia went through major changes. Many Yugoslav Brutalist styled apartments were built around the city centre of Tetovo as well as concrete roads. New suburbs such as the Hajdućka suburb were formed to help accommodate the rising number of Macedonians moving to the city. Some of the city&#x27;s historic buildings, such as the Old Mosque, were demolished by the authorities.
===Break up of Yugoslavia===
Tetovo, along with the city of Gostivar, took in and sheltered several thousands of Bosnian Muslim refugees from 1992 until the end of the Bosnian war. 

In 1997, Alajdin Demiri, the mayor of Tetovo, was jailed for raising the double headed eagle flag of Albania from Tetovo town hall, and by 2000 the outbreak of hostilities in Tanusevci had spilled into the towns of Tetovo and Gostivar. In 2001, ethnic Albanians launched an insurgency, with Tetovo being the main backdrop of the war. Fortunately, the Ohrid Agreement was established, allowing peace to return to the city again.

===Present day===
In economic terms Tetovo is one of the most developing cities in North Macedonia with some multinational companies (Ecolog International, Mercure Tetovo, Renova, Kipper) being located in this town. Despite the interest of private companies in Tetovo, the city is neglected by the government. Tetovo suffers from urban sprawl. Due to the lack of government regulations, the city has no system for building permits, and many houses and buildings have been built unsafely and randomly along footpaths, roads and in parks. Air pollution levels are among the highest in Europe.

The tallest building in the city is Mercure Tetovo measuring about 80 meters in height.

Tetovo is one of the educational centres in North Macedonia hosting two universities South East European University (Public Private Non-profitable) and State University of Tetovo (Public University). The prior one has educational leadership in the region, whereat the Bologna Process is applicable since its establishment, has the best campus in the region of South East Europe and is trend with international developments in education. More than 20,000 students get their education and degrees in Tetovo.

In addition, Tetovo is a centre of ethnic Albanian politics. Most Albanian political parties on North Macedonia (Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA), Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP)) have their main seats there.

Tetovo has one of the highest crime rates in North Macedonia, second only to the much larger capital Skopje. The city was home to 1,229 criminal acts in the first half of 2009.

On September 8, 2021, at least fourteen people were killed in an explosion at a COVID-19 center.

==Culture==

Tetovo has been under many different empires; from the Mycenae and Illyrians, to the Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans, giving the city a vast range of diverse cultures. The museum of Tetovo, established in 1950, contains history of Tetovo and is situated in the Memorial House of Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia.

===Landmarks===
Tetovo Municipality is home to 15 sites designated as Cultural Heritage by the Ministry of Culture, of which 14 are within the city limits of Tetovo. Nine of these are historic homes.

The main attractions of Tetovo are its historic areas and structures. The Šarena Mosque (&quot;The Painted Mosque&quot;) is located near the Pena River in the old part of town. The mosque was built in 1438 and rebuilt in 1833 by Abdurrahman Pasha, the son of Rexhep Pasha. It is one of the most important cultural and historical structures of Tetovo and represents the style of early Ottoman architecture. The painted mosque continues to be an important monument to the residents of Tetovo, and is the main tourist attraction for many foreign visitors.

Sitting directly across the Pena River from the Šarena Mosque is Tetovo&#x27;s Ottoman-era hamam, known as the Čifte Hamam or Bey&#x27;s Hamam. It was built in the late 15th/early 16th century. Declared a monument of cultural heritage, it houses the Tetovo Art Gallery. The building was renovated between 2012 and 2015.

The Tetovo Fortress, located on the top of the Baltepe Hill, above Tetovo, was built in 1820 by Abdurrahman Pasha.

The Arabati Baba Teḱe originally built in 1538 around the türbe of Sersem Ali Baba, an Ottoman dervish. In 1799, a waqf provided by Rexhep Pasha established the current grounds of the tekke. The finest surviving Bektashi monastery in Europe, the sprawling complex features flowered lawns, prayer rooms, dining halls, lodgings and a great marble fountain inside a wooden pavilion.

The Alim Bey House is an historic estate in Tetovo. Along with the Saraj in Resen, it is among the more prominent examples of lodgings built by wealthy Ottoman pashas and beys in North Macedonia that were constructed in Western-inspired architecture. The Alim Bey House is an asymmetrical estate built in the neo-Baroque style with decorated façades, ornate friezes, and the use of various geometric shapes including a hexagonal tower. The three-story home is a protected monument of cultural heritage. The building functioned as a hospital until 1993. Renovation works funded by Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia occurred in 2016.

The Museum of the Tetovo Region is housed within the historic Goce Stojčevski house. The museum was established in 1950, originally situated in the Arabati Baba Tekke complex. It contains archaeological, ethnological, historical, and art exhibits. The house is where Macedonian partisan Goce Stojčevski - Ambarče was born in 1919.

An example of Byzantine culture outside of Tetovo Municipality is the Monastery of Lešok. The monastery is northeast of Tetovo. In its complex are the churches of St. Athanasius of Alexandria and the Holy Mother of God Church. The Church of the Holy Virgin, built in 1326, is an excellent example of Byzantine style and architectural tradition.

Popova Šapka is a ski resort located in the Šar Mountains. Despite being around from the city, it is generally associated with Tetovo. Popova Šapka attracts many tourists in winter due it being one of the popular ski resorts in the former Yugoslavia. Aside from hosting recreational and competitive skiing competitions, Popova Šapka has many villas and restaurants to accommodate visitors. The rise in hotels was because the cable car that took people from Tetovo to Popova Šapka was destroyed during the 2001 Macedonia conflict. Therefore, people stay at Popova Šapka overnight before returning to Tetovo.

There are three stone bridges in Tetovo and each cross the Pena river; one of these, which connects Goce Stojčeski Street one block downstream of the Šarena Mosque, is listed as an Object of Cultural Heritage. The bridges are some of the oldest structures in Tetovo. Most of the old heritage buildings are situated in the old town, near the centre of Tetovo. Tetovo has many old buildings and monuments however, they are endangered of being demolished by people building unpermitted buildings

===Cuisine===

Tetovo is home of the dish Tavče Gravče, known locally in Tetovo as &quot;Tavë me Groshë&quot;. During Socialist Yugoslavia, the dish was known around the country as &quot;Tetovski Gravče&quot;, in reference to the city of Tetovo, where the dish originates. Although different varieties of the meal are made around Balkans, the traditional Tetovo tavče gravče is cooked and served in a terracotta pot.

Most cuisines in Tetovo have a strong Ottoman influence or foundation such as Ajvar, Sujuk and Gevrek. Tetovo is known for its barbecue restaurants, &quot;Qebaptorë&quot;, where Ćevapi and Pljeskavica (including Shar Pljeskavica&quot; (Šarska pljeskavica), stuffed with kashkaval cheese). &quot;Byrektorës&quot;, pastry restaurants, are also common in Tetovo and produce Burek. &quot;Ëmbëltore&quot;, sweet shops, produce locally made traditional sweets such as Lukum, Tulumba, Kataif and Baklava. Boza is also fermented in Tetovo and is a common beverage consumed.

The cuisines in Tetovo have a unique taste and flavour due to the local agricultural products used to make the cuisines. In North Macedonia, Tetovo Kashkaval cheese is the most popular as it is made naturally from sheep&#x27;s milk from the Šar Mountains. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, apples from Tetovo were popular in Belgrade and were known as &quot;Tetovo Jabuka&quot;.

Between the years 1348-1353, Albanians are mentioned by Serbian Tsar Stefan Dušan as farmers and soldiers in the district of Tetovo.

Ottoman statistics from 1452 for the nahiya of Tetovo recorded 146 Christian and 60 Muslim households. In 1453, the population consisted of 153 Christian and 56 Muslim families. The 1455 defter recorded Albanian presence. The 1467 Ottoman defter records of Tetovo attests that the Muslim neighborhood of Tetovo was inhabited by 6 heads of families with mixed anthroponyms of Islamic Albanian character, while the Christian quarter of Tetovo was characterized with Slavic-Christian and Albanian-Christian names, with some cases of Slavicisation.

In 1468, Tetovo had 180 Christian and 41 Muslim families. In 1545 there were 99 Christian and 101 Muslim families (38 were islamicised) in Tetovo, and in 1568 there were 108 Christian and 329 Muslim (184 islamicised).

By the 19th century, when the population of Tetovo began to increase with settlement from the surrounding villages, the French traveler Ami Boue noted that the population had reached about 4,500 people, which are Bulgarians and Albanians. The total population of the Pashalik of Tetovo is 30,000–40,000 and consists of Bulgarians who are Eastern Orthodox and of Albanian who are Muslims.

<text>Michael George Klim, OAM (born 13 August 1977) is an Australian swimmer, Olympic gold medalist, world champion, and former world record-holder of the 1990s and 2000s. He is known as the creator of straight arm freestyle.

==Early years==
Klim was born in Gdynia, Poland, in 1977. Shortly after his birth, his father was appointed trade attaché to the Polish consulate in Bombay, and together with his older sister he learned to swim there. The family returned to Gdynia after five years. They left Poland in 1987 and lived in Hamburg, Germany, where as a 10-year old he competed nationally for a local swimming club. His father applied for a business visa for Australia, but as the process was slow, they also applied for Canadian visas and soon moved to Toronto. Nine months later, their Australian visa was granted. The family arrived in Melbourne on the 30th of April 1989. Klim was educated at the University High School, Melbourne, and Wesley College, Melbourne, where he was later employed as the college&#x27;s elite head coach of swimming.

==Career==
Klim was first selected to represent Australia in the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, while still a student at Wesley College, Melbourne. For his achievements he was named the Male Swimmer of the Year by the magazine &quot;Swimming World&quot; in 1997.

In 1999, he set a world record in the 100 m butterfly twice, in a FINA-sanctioned time trial (51.81 s). It was broken at the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona by the Ukrainian Andriy Serdinov in the first semifinal of the 100 m butterfly, and then broken another time in the next semifinal by Michael Phelps. Phelps&#x27;s record was bested by Ian Crocker in the final the following day.

Klim was Australian Institute of Sport Athlete of the Year in 1998 and 1999 and was inducted into the AIS &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27; in 2001. Klim was the only Australian to win a gold medal at both the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games.

On 26 June 2007 Klim retired from competitive swimming; he finished the year ranked 94 in the 100 freestyle with the Olympics 14 months away. However on 14 February 2011 Klim announced his return to competitive swimming, hoping to compete in the London 2012 Olympics. Ultimately Klim failed to qualify for the team and he retired from competitive swimming for a second time.

==Medal achievements==
In 1996, he arrived at the Atlanta Olympics ranked first in the world for the 200 m freestyle, but was surprisingly eliminated in the heats. He rebounded to qualify for a finals in the 100m butterfly, and swam the freestyle leg in the 4×100 m medley relay, in which Australia claimed a bronze medal.

1998 was Klim&#x27;s year in the sun. In January, the World Aquatics Championships were held in Perth, Western Australia, and in front of a boisterous home crowd, he was the leading swimmer of the meet. He triumphed in the 200 m freestyle and the 100 m butterfly, and added silver in the 100 m freestyle, and bronze in the 50 m freestyle. He was a member of each of Australia&#x27;s three relay teams, winning gold in the 4×200 m freestyle relay and 4×100 m medley relay, and a silver in the 4×100 m freestyle relay.

** 50m Freestyle
** 100m Butterfly
** 4×100m Freestyle Relay
** 4×200m Freestyle Relay

At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Klim set a world record (48.18) leading off the 4×100 m freestyle relay, which paved the way for a world record (3:13.67). Three days later, he was part of the 4×200 m freestyle relay, which set another world record (7:07.05), which left the opposition over 5 seconds in arrears on its way to victory. His 100m freestyle world record bested by Pieter van den Hoogenband in the semi&#x27;s, in the final he finished with a bitter 4th place, he turned first at the wall but he claimed his legs gave away in the second half. In the 100 m butterfly, he was the world record holder, again turning first at the wall heavily under world record pace, but was cut down in the closing stages by Sweden&#x27;s Lars Frölander, finishing second. On the final night he claimed silver as part of the 4×100 m medley relay team.

In 2002 and 2003, due to chronic back and shoulder problems, Klim was inactive throughout these years.

Klim failed to qualify for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but was later selected as part of the relay team, which came second behind USA in the 4×200m, race. The relay team did not win a medal in the 4x100m and failed to qualify for the medley relay final.

==Personal life==
Klim married Lindy Rama, a former model and fashion entrepreneur, in April 2006. The couple have two daughters, and a son. Klim and Rama announced their separation in February 2016. Klim shares custody of his children with his ex-wife and continues to live in Bali with his current partner Michelle Owen.

After his second retirement from swimming Klim became founder and CEO of a skin care company named &quot;Milk and Co&quot;. He has since stepped away from that business to establish his swim school in Bali, Klim Swim. Klim supports the St Kilda Saints in the Australian Football League.

In July 2022, Klim revealed that he had been diagnosed with the auto-immune disorder chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in 2020, which has affected his legs and feet and left him struggling to walk unassisted.

In 2024, his autobiography &quot;Klim&quot;, written with sports journalist Nicole Jeffery, was published by Hachette.

<doc id="1053612" wikidata="Q2619091" url="?curid=1053612" title="Angiosarcoma">
<text>Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that starts in the endothelial cells that line the walls of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Since they are made from vascular lining, they can appear anywhere and at any age, but older people are more commonly affected, and the skin is the most affected area, with approximately 60% of cases being (skin). Specifically, the scalp makes up ~50% of angiosarcoma cases, but this is still &lt;0.1% of all head and neck tumors. Since angiosarcoma is an umbrella term for many types of tumor that vary greatly in origin and location, many symptoms may occur, from completely asymptomatic to non-specific symptoms like skin lesions, ulceration, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Multiple-organ involvement at time of diagnosis is common and makes it difficult to ascertain origin and how to treat it.

The cause of angiosarcoma is not known, though several risk factors are known, such as chronic lymphedema, radiation therapy and various chemicals such as arsenic and vinyl chloride. Angiosarcomas have been reported in association with long standing foreign bodies. Infrequently they have occurred in association with breast implants. Ultraviolet radiation and localized immunodeficiency may play a role in pathogenesis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma can be seen on MRI, CT and ultrasound scans, but it is usually difficult to discern it from other cancers, requiring confirmation of diagnosis by biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis.

Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, usually all three combined. Because these cancers arise from the cells lining the blood or lymphatic vessels, they can easily metastasize to distant sites, particularly the liver and lungs. This makes them especially lethal, and an early diagnosis is usually necessary for survival. Even with treatment, prognosis is poor, with a five-year survival rate of 30–38%. This is even worse in cardiac angiosarcoma and angiosarcoma of the liver, where prognosis may be as low as three months.

Angiosarcomas make up 1–2% of soft tissue sarcomas, which in turn make up less than 1% of adult cancer. Due to this, no large studies have ever been published on the disease, with few exceeding even 100 patients; however, many case reports and small cohort studies have been published, and they cumulatively provide enough information to get a useful understanding of the disease. The rate of angiosarcoma is increasing in the US.

== Classification ==
The classification of angiosarcoma is based on both its origin and the underlying risk factors that may have contributed. This is not a comprehensive list and case reports often go into further depth.

=== Primary cutaneous angiosarcoma ===
Angiosarcoma in the skin (usually the head or neck and specifically the scalp) with no underlying risk factors such as lymphedema or radiation therapy.

=== Lymphedema associated angiosarcoma ===
Also called Stewart-Treves syndrome, it is a lymphangiosarcoma resulting from chronic lymphedema, swelling due to the build up of lymphatic fluid. It typically happens in the breast following a mastectomy that removes the lymph nodes of the breast. However it can happen anywhere.

=== Parenchymal angiosarcoma ===
Angiosarcoma in parenchymal organs such as the liver, breast or heart. These makes up about 40% of angiosarcoma.

==== Primary breast angiosarcoma ====
This refers to angiosarcoma of the breast without underlying causes such as radiation therapy or lymphedema. It is rare and makes up only 0.04% of breast tumors and 8% of breast sarcomas. It is very aggressive, usually presents in younger females and is often noticeable by a palpable mass. Prognosis is poor with a five-year survival between 8 and 50%.

==== Secondary breast angiosarcoma ====
These are angiosarcoma that arise in the breast from underlying causes such as lymphedema or radiation, usually from radiation therapy for breast cancer. The link between radiation therapy and angiosarcoma has been disputed by some who profess the angiosarcoma is caused by concurrent lymphedema. Secondary breast angiosarcoma tends to have a bad prognosis. Radiation-associated angiosarcoma has a five-year survival of 10 to 54%. Distant metastases are present in 27–42% of individuals and is associated with a far worse prognosis. Other prognostic factors include size of tumor, age and how much can be removed by surgery.

==== Primary brain angiosarcoma ====
Primary brain angiosarcoma are angiosarcoma that arise in the brain (i.e. not metastasised from elsewhere). They are exceedingly rare with only a few cases reported. Imaging is non specific and differential diagnosis includes most other brain tumors such as gliomas or cavernomas, requiring biopsy to confirm diagnosis, usually after surgery. Prognosis is generally poor with a median survival rate of eight months. However it varies greatly depending on whether or not the tumor has metastasised, some individuals may be rid of the disease following surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

==== Primary cardiac angiosarcoma ====
Primary cardiac angiosarcoma is an angiosarcoma that arises in the heart. Despite being very rare they are the most common malignant primary heart tumor with 10–25% of cases being angiosarcomas. Symptoms may include shortness of breath, chest pain (46%), hypotension and syncope. Superior vena cava syndrome is reportedly a complication of cardiac angiosarcoma. Due to the non-specificity of symptoms and rarity of the disease it is often missed by doctors and initial diagnosis may be delayed. A 2012 study reported that 56% of patients presented with pericardial effusion with or without cardiac tamponade. The most common finding on imaging is cardiomegaly. Prognosis is generally very poor with a mean survival rate of three months to four years following diagnosis. Metastasis at time of diagnosis is common.

==== Primary liver angiosarcoma ====

Primary angiosarcoma of the liver is the third most common type of liver cancer however it only makes up 0.1–2.0% of all liver cancers. It is rapidly fatal with most individuals dying within six months or a year even with surgical resection. Despite being associated with arsenic, vinyl chloride, thorotrast and other chemicals, 75% of liver angiosarcomas have no known cause. Men are more commonly affected in a ratio of 3–4:1 however in children girls are more often affected. If symptomatic it often presents with non-specific liver related symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, fatigue, unintended weight loss and distension.

=== Deep soft tissue angiosarcoma ===
Angiosarcoma in the deep soft tissue such as adipose tissue, ligaments or muscles. These make up about 10% of angiosarcoma.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Cutaneous angiosarcoma may initially look like a bruise or a purplish-red papule. It may look like a benign tumor which can delay correct diagnosis and treatment. Fungation, ulceration and bleeding may develop.

Cardiac angiosarcoma may present with shortness of breath, chest pain (46%), weight loss, anemia-like symptoms, low blood pressure and syncope.

Angiosarcomas principally metastasises through the blood with the most common site for metastasis being the lungs; this may present as pleural effusion, pneumothorax or other pleural disease. Other common sites of metastasis include the liver, bone and lymph nodes.

== Causes ==
Angiosarcoma develops when damage to the DNA of endothelial cells causes them to divide uncontrollably and prevents programmed death. This allows them to grow into a mass invading other parts of the body and consuming its resources. If part of the mass breaks off and enters the circulatory or lymphatic system (which is very common due to angiosarcomas arising from the lining of said systems) it allows them to lodge elsewhere in the body. This process is called metastasis and is a negative prognostic factor. The underlying causes of DNA damage is not understood but several risk factors are widely accepted.

Accepted risk factors include lymphedema, radiation therapy, neurofibromatosis, Maffucci syndrome, Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and chemicals such as arsenic, thorotrast and vinyl chloride.

A 2020 study analyzing the genome of cutaneous angiosarcomas suggests that ultraviolet radiation may be a causative agent of angiosarcomas.

Immunosuppression may play a role in the pathogenesis of angiosarcoma. There have been reports of angiosarcoma in immunosuppressed individuals following kidney transplantation. The association between lymphedema and angiosarcoma may be due to localized immunodeficiency, however this hypothesis has not been confirmed. Some studies suggest a link between AIDS and angiosarcoma though this may be due to misdiagnosed Kaposi&#x27;s sarcoma.

== Diagnosis ==

The diagnosis of angiosarcoma can be difficult due to its asymptomatic nature or non-specific symptoms. Initial diagnosis is typically done by MRI, CT or ultrasound scan, however it is typically difficult to discern if a mass is an angiosarcoma or other type of tumor such as a melanoma or carcinoma. This means that while the initial diagnosis is typically done via imaging, conclusive diagnosis has to be performed via biopsy and subsequent histological and immunohistochemical analysis.

The marker CD31 is often considered the gold standard for angiosarcoma diagnosis due to its high sensitivity and specificity. Other markers typically used include von Willebrand factor, CD34, and vascular endothelial growth factor. The absence of markers present in melanomas such as S100 and HMB-45 can help in differentiating angiosarcomas from melanomas.

== Epidemiology ==
Angiosarcomas are rare with one in a million people being diagnosed with it each year in the US. Older adults are more commonly affected and there is no gender bias, except in angiosarcoma of the liver where males are affected in a ratio of 3-4:1 and cutaneous angiosarcoma where males are again affected more commonly, particularly elderly white men.

== Other animals ==
In dogs, hemangiosarcoma is relatively common with the golden retriever, boxer and labrador retriever at higher risk of the disease than other breeds. It occurs primarily in the spleen, liver, heart, skin and subcutaneous layer of the skin. It is rapidly fatal and metastatic and can present with anything from nonspecific signs to imminent death from tumor rupture.

<text>The Third Policeman is a novel by Irish writer Brian O&#x27;Nolan, writing under the pseudonym Flann O&#x27;Brien. It was written in 1939 and 1940, but after it initially failed to find a publisher, the author withdrew the manuscript from circulation and claimed he had lost it. The book remained unpublished at the time of his death in 1966. It was published by MacGibbon &amp; Kee in 1967.

== Plot summary ==
&quot;The Third Policeman&quot; is set in rural Ireland and is narrated by a dedicated amateur scholar who studies de Selby, a scientist and philosopher. The narrator, whose name the reader never learns, is orphaned at a young age. At boarding school, he discovers the work of de Selby and becomes a fanatically dedicated student of it. One night he breaks his leg under mysterious circumstances – &quot;if you like, it was broken for me&quot; – and he is ultimately fitted with a wooden leg to replace the original one. On returning to his family home, he meets and befriends John Divney who is in charge of the family farm and pub. Over the next few years, the narrator devotes himself to the study of de Selby&#x27;s work and leaves Divney to run the family business.

By the time the narrator is thirty, he has written what he believes to be the definitive critical work on de Selby but does not have enough money to have it published. Divney observes that Mathers, a local man, &quot;is worth a packet of potato-meal&quot; and eventually it dawns on the narrator that Divney plans to rob and kill Mathers. The narrator and Divney encounter Mathers one night on the road and Divney knocks Mathers down with a bicycle pump. The narrator, prompted by Divney, finishes Mathers off with a spade and then notices that Divney has disappeared with Mathers&#x27;s cash box. When Divney returns, he refuses to reveal the location of the cash box and fends off the narrator&#x27;s repeated inquiries. To ensure that Divney does not retrieve the box unobserved, the narrator becomes more and more inseparable from Divney, eventually sharing a bed with him: &quot;the situation was a queer one and neither of us liked it&quot;.

Three years pass, in which the previously amicable relationship between the narrator and Divney breaks down. Eventually, Divney reveals that the box is hidden under the floorboards in Mathers&#x27;s old house, and instructs the narrator to fetch it. The narrator follows Divney&#x27;s instructions but just as he reaches for the box, &quot;something happened&quot;:

It was as if the daylight had changed with unnatural suddenness, as if the temperature of the evening had altered greatly in an instant or as if the air had become twice as rare or twice as dense as it had been in the winking of an eye; perhaps all of these and other things happened together for all my senses were bewildered all at once and could give me no explanation.

The box has disappeared, and the narrator is perplexed to notice that Mathers is in the room with him. During a surreal conversation with the apparently dead Mathers, the narrator hears another voice speaking to him which he realises is his soul: &quot;For convenience I called him Joe.&quot; The narrator is bent on finding the cash box, and when Mathers tells him about a remarkable police barracks nearby he resolves to go to the barracks and enlist the help of the police in finding the box.

On the way, he meets a one-legged bandit named Martin Finnucane, who threatens to kill him but who becomes his friend upon finding out that his potential victim is also one-legged. The narrator approaches the police barracks and is disturbed by its appearance:

It looked as if it were painted like an advertisement on a board on the roadside and indeed very poorly painted. It looked completely false and unconvincing.

Inside the barracks he meets two of the three policemen, Sergeant Pluck and Policeman MacCruiskeen, who speak largely in non-sequitur and who are entirely obsessed with bicycles. There he is introduced to various peculiar or irrational concepts, artefacts, and locations, including a contraption that collects sound and converts it to light based on a theory regarding omnium, the fundamental energy of the universe; a vast underground chamber called &#x27;Eternity,&#x27; where time stands still, mysterious numbers are devoutly recorded and worried about by the policemen; a box from which anything you desire can be produced; and an intricately carved chest containing a series of identical but smaller chests. The infinite nature of this last device causes the narrator great mental and spiritual discomfort.

It is later discovered that Mathers has been found dead and eviscerated in a ditch. Joe suspects Martin Finnucane, but to the narrator&#x27;s dismay he himself is charged with the crime because he is the most convenient suspect. He argues with Sergeant Pluck that since he is nameless, and therefore, as Pluck observed, &quot;invisible to the law&quot;, he cannot be charged with anything. Pluck is surprised, but after he unsuccessfully attempts to guess the narrator&#x27;s name he reasons that since the narrator is nameless he is not really a person, and can therefore be hanged without fear of repercussions:

The particular death you die is not even a death (which is an inferior phenomenon at best) only an insanitary abstraction in the backyard[…].

The narrator calls on the help of Finnucane, but his rescue is thwarted by MacCruiskeen riding a bicycle painted an unknown colour which drives those who see it mad. He faces the gallows, but the two policemen are called away by dangerously high readings in the underground chamber. The following day he escapes from the barracks on a bicycle of unusual perfection.

As he rides through the countryside, he passes Mathers&#x27;s house and sees a light. Disturbed, he enters the house and finally meets the mysterious and reportedly all-powerful third policeman, Fox, who has the face of Mathers. Fox&#x27;s secret police station is in the walls of Mathers&#x27;s house. He tells the narrator that he is the architect of the readings in the underground chamber, which he alters for his amusement, thereby inadvertently saving the narrator&#x27;s life. Fox goes on to tell the narrator that he found the cash box and has sent it to the narrator&#x27;s home, where it is waiting for him. He also reveals that the box contains not money but omnium, which can become anything he desires. Elated by the possibilities before him, the narrator leaves Fox&#x27;s police station and goes home looking forward to seeing Divney once again; on arrival, he finds that while only a few days have passed in his own life, his accomplice is sixteen years older, with a wife and children. Divney can see the narrator, although the others cannot, and he has a heart attack from the shock. He shouts that the narrator was supposed to be dead, for the black box was not filled with money but a bomb and it exploded when the narrator reached for it. The narrator leaves Divney on the floor, apparently dying.

Feeling &quot;sad, empty and without a thought&quot;, the narrator leaves the house and walks away down the road. He soon approaches the police barracks, the book using exactly the same words to describe the barracks and the narrator&#x27;s opinion of it that were used earlier, the story having circled around itself and restarted. This time, John Divney joins the narrator on the road; they neither look at nor speak to each other. They both enter the police station and are confronted by Sergeant Pluck, who repeats his earlier dialogue and ends the book with a reprise of his original greeting to the narrator:

&quot;Is it about a bicycle?&quot; he asked.

== Publication history ==
In 1940, O&#x27;Nolan completed the novel and circulated the typescript among friends in Dublin. He submitted it to Longman&#x27;s, the English publisher of his first novel, &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, but they declined to publish it. O&#x27;Nolan believed that Graham Greene, who had been a champion of his at Longman, was still a reader with the company, but he was not. Consequently, the novel fell on less sympathetic ears. The rejection notice read in part:

We realize the author&#x27;s ability but think that he should become less fantastic and in this new novel he is more so.

The American author William Saroyan, who had become acquainted with O&#x27;Nolan during a brief stay in Dublin, offered the use of his literary agent in finding an American publisher, but with no success. O&#x27;Nolan made no further attempts at publication and shelved the manuscript, claiming that it had been lost. O&#x27;Nolan told his friends that while driving through Donegal the boot of his car opened unknown to him, causing the manuscript to flutter out page by page until it was gone. In reality he left it on the sideboard in his dining room, in plain view to him every day as he ate, for 26 years. He later used elements of &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; in his 1964 novel &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;. After O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s death in 1966, his widow Evelyn O&#x27;Nolan sent the typescript to MacGibbon &amp; Kee, O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s publishers throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The firm published the book in 1967. Reviewer Thomas Kilroy described it as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

== O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s opinion ==
In a letter to William Saroyan, dated 14 February 1940, O&#x27;Nolan explained the strange plot of &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;:

When you get to the end of this book you realize that my hero or main character (he&#x27;s a heel and a killer) has been dead throughout the book and that all the queer ghastly things which have been happening to him are happening in a sort of hell which he earned for the killing … It is made clear that this sort of thing goes on for ever … When you are writing about the world of the dead – and the damned – where none of the rules and laws (not even the law of gravity) holds good, there is any amount of scope for back-chat and funny cracks.

In a passage that was omitted from the published novel, O&#x27;Nolan wrote:Joe had been explaining things in the meantime. He said it was again the beginning of the unfinished, the re-discovery of the familiar, the re-experience of the already suffered, the fresh-forgetting of the unremembered. Hell goes round and round. In shape it is circular and by nature it is interminable, repetitive and very nearly unbearable.

== Critical interpretations ==
Critical interpretations to &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; have been varied. Anne Clissman, writing in 1975 in the first major study of Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s work, considers the book to be &quot;in many ways a continuation of some of the ideas expressed in &quot;At Swim&quot;&quot;. She described the book as &quot;in parts, extremely amusing, but the overall effect is anything but funny&quot; and noted that the book &quot;shows a fixity of purpose and clarity&quot; which she contrasted with the &quot;organised chaos&quot; of &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;. Clissman regards the novel as a less experimental work than &quot;At Swim&quot;:

Its central concern is not, as in &quot;At Swim&quot;, with varying methods of presenting reality in fiction, but with reality viewed through the medium of scientific and philosophical concepts.

Keith Hopper, writing twenty years after Clissman, regards &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; somewhat differently. Regarding it as &quot;the first great masterpiece […] of what we generally refer to now as post-modernism&quot;, he argues that the book is not less but more formally experimental than &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;:

Contrary to O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s assertion that this novel was without the &#x27;difficulties and fireworks&#x27; of &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, this is a more radical and involved metafictional fantasy[…].

Hopper interprets the narrator&#x27;s journey as &quot;a quest to discover the borderland between reality and fiction&quot;, noting the narrator&#x27;s &quot;flickering between an awareness that he is a character trapped within a fictional order and his realist belief that he is a &#x27;real-life&#x27; person&quot;. Hopper also notes the wide range of intellectual and cultural influences on the book, including John M. Synge&#x27;s play &quot;The Playboy of the Western World&quot;, J.K. Huysmans&#x27;s novel &quot;À rebours&quot;, Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, the works of J. W. Dunne and Cartesian dualism. More recent work, such as that of Maebh Long in &quot;Assembling Flann O’Brien&quot; and the edited collection &quot;Flann O’Brien and Modernism&quot; tend to view O’Brien as a modernist rather than a postmodernist. 

The critic Hugh Kenner, in a 1997 essay entitled &quot;The Fourth Policeman&quot;, advanced a hypothesis to explain why O&#x27;Nolan had suppressed the manuscript. Noting the complex ways in which the novel draws on pagan traditions in Middle and Early Modern Irish literature, as well as the ways in which it confounds attempts to inscribe it within a realist tradition, Kenner argued that the book created a &quot;cartoon of Ireland&quot; that was &quot;brilliant but disturbingly coherent.&quot; Kenner argues that the book&#x27;s failure to find a publisher must have caused O&#x27;Nolan to reread it, whereupon O&#x27;Nolan (in Kenner&#x27;s account) must have been so &quot;unsettled&quot; by the book&#x27;s effect, &quot;for he liked his effects under rational control […] and this book grimaced at him, from expressive levels he was careful never to monkey with again&quot;, that he suppressed it; not out of despair of it reaching a publisher but because it offended his own &quot;explicitly formed and highly orthodox conscience&quot;. Kenner calls O&#x27;Nolan&#x27;s Catholic conscience the &quot;Fourth Policeman&quot; of his essay&#x27;s title. 

== Allusions in other works ==
&quot;The Third Policeman&quot; was featured in a 2005 episode of television series &quot;Lost&quot; with the intent of providing context for the show&#x27;s complex mythology, with the result that sales of the book in the three weeks following its mention equalled what it had sold in the preceding six years.

John Cooper Clarke&#x27;s nonsense prose poem, &quot;Ten years in an open necked shirt&quot; contains the line &quot;What with the drink trade on its last legs and the land running fallow for the want of artificial manures&quot;, the same line John Divney uses in the book to explain their lack of funds.

A book cover of the Norwegian book edition is displayed in the last scene of the movie &quot;Next Door&quot; (2005).

Irish musician Hozier referenced The Third Policeman in the tracks &quot;De Selby (Part 1)&quot; and &quot;De Selby (Part 2)&quot; on his 2023 album &quot;Unreal Unearth.&quot;

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted by the Ridiculusmus theatre company. Premiered at Aras na nGael, London in 1992 and toured in repertory until 1997.

The book was adapted for an open-air theatre production by Miracle Theatre in 2017, with &quot;The Stage&quot; judging it to be an &quot;Enjoyably absurd and inventively staged alfresco summer theatre&quot;.

<text>Gottfried de Purucker (January 15, 1874 – September 27, 1942) was a Theosophist, author and leader of the Theosophical Society Pasadena (then headquartered at Point Loma, California) from 1929-1942.
Purucker&#x27;s father, an Anglican minister, prepared his son for his future with the church through extensive training in language and religious studies. Purucker recalls having at age 14 translated the entire New Testament from Greek, and at age 17 having translated the Book of Genesis from Hebrew. But he recalls having had an intuition that something was wrong with the church system he grew up in. It was when he began studying eastern religions and philosophies and Theosophy that, in his words: &quot;I realized that the instinct of my soul had been a true one&quot;. Of the Theosophical literature, he said: &quot;I read it avidly and studied it eagerly, and then my heart awoke, as my brain had awoke before. But now, from a study of the theosophical literature, my heart awaking, I began to realize what there was, not only in me, but in my fellows; and I said to myself: hereafter my life is consecrate to what I know to be the truth. No man can live unto himself alone; no man can tread the pathway — the still, small, old pathway — of the spiritual self within him, alone.&quot;

These experiences led him to the Theosophical Society, which he joined on August 16, 1893. The years from 1893 until 1903 were spent traveling and working, largely in Europe, before moving to Point Loma and joining the staff at Lomaland, the headquarters of the Theosophical Society, under the leadership of Katherine Tingley. Of this period, Purucker said: &quot;all my early life, up till nearly thirty, was passed in the whirl of social and diplomatic and literary and artistic circles, in Geneva, Paris, and other European capitals and big cities. I hated this life, as you can imagine, and when the word came to me from the &quot;Bosses&quot; to pack up and go to Point Loma into years of retirement and training, I felt like a prisoner released from jail, and going home.&quot;

From that time forward, Purucker taught classes, gave lectures and wrote several works on Theosophy. He succeeded Katherine Tingley to leadership of the Theosophical Society in 1929 and saw its operations through the great depression. In 1942, he sold the property at Point Loma and moved the headquarters to Covina, California. He died a few months later, on September 27, 1942.

His legacy includes several publications, including elucidations of the writings of Helena Blavatsky. Several additional works were also published posthumously.

<text>Jordan K. Hubbard (born April 8, 1963) is an open source software developer, authoring software such as the Ardent Window Manager and various other open source tools and libraries before co-founding the FreeBSD project with Nate Williams and Rodney W. Grimes in 1993, for which he contributed the initial FreeBSD Ports collection, package management system and sysinstall. In July 2001 Hubbard joined Apple Computer in the role of manager of the BSD technology group, during which time he was one of the creators of MacPorts. In 2005, his title was &quot;Director of UNIX Technology&quot; and in October 2007, Hubbard was promoted to &quot;Director of Engineering of Unix Technologies&quot; at Apple where he remained until June 2013.

On July 15, 2013, he became CTO of iXsystems where he also led the FreeNAS open source project.

On March 24, 2017, he announced his plan to depart from iXsystems and that he would be joining TwoPoreGuys, a Biotechnology company, as VP of Engineering. From January 2019–April 2020 he was part of the Engineering Leadership team at Uber and, as of April 2020, is currently Senior Director for GPU Compute Software at Nvidia.

== rwall incident ==
On March 31, 1987 Hubbard executed an rwall command expecting it to send a message to every machine on the network at University of California, Berkeley, where he headed the Distributed Unix Group. The command instead began broadcasting Hubbard&#x27;s message to every machine on the internet and was stopped after Hubbard realised the message was being broadcast remotely after he received complaints from people at Purdue University and University of Texas. Even though the command was terminated, it resulted in Hubbard receiving 743 messages and complaints.

<doc id="1053629" wikidata="Q3079260" url="?curid=1053629" title="Madagascar lowland forests">
<text>The Madagascar lowland forests or Madagascar humid forests are a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion found on the eastern coast of the island of Madagascar, home to a plant and animal mix that is 80 to 90% endemic, with the forests of the eastern plain being a particularly important location of this endemism. They are included in the Global 200 list of outstanding ecoregions.

==Geography==
The ecoregion constitutes a narrow strip of lowland forests between Madagascar&#x27;s east coast and the mountainous Central Highlands, from sea level to elevation. It covers an area of approximately . The ecoregion is under the direct influence of the oceanic trade winds, which maintain a warm, humid climate; rainfall is above 2,000 mm per year and can reach up to 6,000 mm on the Masoala peninsula.

The lowland forests extend from Marojejy in the north to the southeast corner of the island. At the northern edge of ecoregion around Vohemar, the moist forests transition to the drier Madagascar dry deciduous forests ecoregion. To the east, at approximately elevation, the lowland forests transition gradually to the Madagascar subhumid forests ecoregion. The southern end of the ecoregion lies at the crest of the Anosyennes Mountains, where a narrow belt of dry transitional forest marks the transition to the dry spiny forests ecoregion in the mountains&#x27; rain shadow.

==Flora==
The lowland forests are characterized by dense evergreen forests, 82% of which is endemic species, with a canopy exceeding . Typical canopy species include &quot;Dalbergia, Diospyros, Ocotea, Symphonia&quot;, and &quot;Tambourissa&quot;; emergents of &quot;Canarium, Albizia,&quot; and &quot;Neobrochoneura acuminata&quot; rise above the canopy. The lowland forests have a rich diversity of &quot;Pandanus&quot;, palm, bamboo, and epiphytic orchid species. At higher elevations the trees become shorter and have a denser undergrowth.

==Fauna==
The lowland forests represent a great reservoir of diversity and endemism. Nearly all of Madagascar&#x27;s endemic mammal genera are represented there, including all five families of lemurs.
Fifteen species and subspecies of lemurs are endemic and near-endemic to the ecoregion, including the aye-aye &quot;(Daubentonia madagascariensis)&quot;, the hairy-eared dwarf lemur &quot;(Allocebus trichotis)&quot;, both species of ruffed lemurs &quot;(Varecia variegata, V. rubra)&quot;, the indri &quot;(Indri indri)&quot;, the eastern woolly lemur &quot;(Avahi laniger)&quot;, the diademed sifaka &quot;(Propithecus diadema)&quot;, Milne-Edwards&#x27;s sifaka &quot;(P. edwardsi)&quot;, the golden bamboo lemur &quot;(Hapalemur aureus)&quot;, the greater bamboo lemur &quot;(Prolemur simus)&quot;, the gray-headed lemur &quot;(Eulemur cinereiceps)&quot;, the collared brown lemur &quot;(E. collaris)&quot;, and the red-bellied lemur &quot;(E. rubriventer)&quot;.
As well as lemurs, the forest are home to seven endemic genera of rodents, six endemic genera of carnivorans and several species of bat. Rare animals include the brown-tailed mongoose (&quot;Salanoia concolor&quot;).
The lowland forests are home to many of endemic and limited-range species of birds. Of the 165 bird species found here 42 are endemic to the region, such as the rare red-tailed newtonia (&quot;Newtonia fanovanae&quot;). The brown mesite (&quot;Mesitornis unicolor&quot;), red-breasted coua (&quot;Coua serriana&quot;), scaly ground roller (&quot;Geobiastes squamiger&quot;), nuthatch vanga (&quot;Hypositta corallirostris&quot;), helmet vanga (&quot;Euryceros prevostii&quot;), Bernier&#x27;s vanga (&quot;Oriolia bernieri&quot;), red-tailed newtonia (&quot;Newtonia fanovanae&quot;), and dusky tetraka (&quot;Xanthomixis tenebrosa&quot;) are largely endemic to the lowland forests, ranging occasionally into the lower montane forests. The Madagascar serpent eagle (&quot;Eutriorchis astur&quot;), short-legged ground roller (&quot;Brachypteracias leptosomus&quot;), Madagascar red owl (&quot;Tyto soumagnei&quot;), Pollen&#x27;s vanga (&quot;Xenopirostris polleni&quot;), and brown emu-tail (&quot;Bradypterus brunneus&quot;) live in both the lowland forests and montane forests. The rufous vanga (&quot;Schetba rufa&quot;) and Madagascar green pigeon (&quot;Treron australis&quot;) are widespread Madagascar lowland birds who inhabit the humid lowland forests as well as the dry forests on the west of the island.

A famous extinct species is Delalande&#x27;s coua (&quot;Coua delalandei&quot;) which has not been seen since the 19th century.

The forests are also home to 50 endemic reptiles and 29 amphibians such as the following chameleons: &quot;Calumma gallus&quot;, &quot;Calumma cucullatum&quot;, &quot;Furcifer balteatus&quot;, &quot;Furcifer bifidus&quot;, &quot;Brookesia superciliaris&quot;, and &quot;Brookesia therezieni&quot;. The freshwater fish population, with more than 100 endemic species, is also unique.

==Threats and preservation==

Madagascar&#x27;s lowland rainforests have been preserved generally better than the high central plateau, but there has still been substantial loss. Widespread slash-and-burn activity in the lowland rainforests is one of the major reasons. Slash-and-burn is a method sometimes used by shifting cultivators to create short term yields from marginal soils. When practiced repeatedly, or without intervening fallow periods, the nutrient-poor soils may be exhausted or eroded to an unproductive state. Another threat is the selective exploitation of some species, such as palms and tree ferns.

10.79% of the ecoregion is in protected areas, including national parks and reserves. They include:
*Ambato Atsinanana
*Analamazaotra National Park
*Andasibe-Mantadia National Park
*Andohahela National Park
*Kalambatritra Reserve
*Manombo Special Reserve
*Marojejy National Park
*Ranomafana National Park
*Mangerivola Special Reserve
*Masoala National Park
*Tsitongambarika
*Zahamena National Park

<text>The Glan (; ) is a river in Carinthia, Austria, a right tributary of the Gurk. It is long. Its drainage basin is .

It rises north of the Wörthersee in the Ossiach Tauern, then running through Feldkirchen, going northeastwards passing the castle Burgruine Glanegg until it reaches Sankt Veit where it bends sharply towards south. It flows through the Zollfeld Valley, the historical heart of the Carinthian duchy, and through Klagenfurt, the state capital. At Ebenthal southeast of Klagenfurt is the confluence with the Glanfurt River, the Glan bends eastwards and finally flows into the river Gurk.

It was first mentioned as &quot;Glana&quot; in a deed of donation issued by Emperor Otto II at the 983 Reichstag in Verona. The name derives from Celtic (Noric) meaning &quot;bright, clear&quot;, cf. Glanis, Glanum, Glen and English &quot;clean&quot;.

<doc id="1053640" wikidata="Q300323" url="?curid=1053640" title="A Band Apart">
<text>A Band Apart Films LLC was an American independent film production company founded by Quentin Tarantino, Michael Bodnarchek, and Lawrence Bender in 1991, before its liquidation in 2006. Its name is a play on the French New Wave classic film, &quot;Bande à part&quot; (&quot;Band of Outsiders&quot;) by filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard, whose work was highly influential on the work of the company&#x27;s members.

==History==
Tarantino formed A Band Apart in 1991, naming it after his favorite Godard film, &quot;Bande à part&quot;. The company&#x27;s logo was a stylized image of the robbers from &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, Tarantino&#x27;s debut film. Subsequently, several legal entities within the company were named after the film&#x27;s characters. Mr. Pink LLC was for music video production budgets, and Mr. Brown LLC was for commercials.

In addition to Tarantino, members of the company included Robert Rodriguez, John Woo, Tim Burton, Steve Buscemi, Darren Aronofsky, John Landis, Athanasius Acropolis, Joseph McGinty Nichol, Nigel Dick, Varl Hobe, Steve Carr, Cameron Casey, Marcel Langenegger, Wayne Isham, Cale Donk, Terry Windell, Lisa Prisco, Paul Street, Phil Harder-Rick Fuller, Coodie &amp; Chike, Osbert Parker, Luc Besson, Porker LeVance, Adam Christian Clark, André 3000, Christopher Morrison and Michael Palmieri, Ducky Powell, Andy Mornahan, Chash Brower, Steve Lowe, Loren Hill, Darren Grant, Charles Whittenmier, Geoff McGann, Olivier Venturini, The 405 Guys, and Craig Tanamoto.

The company catapulted to fame with the 1994 release of Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, which was considered by some critics to be the most influential American film of the decade. In the summer of 1995, the company added a division for commercials and later, for music video production, adding a third co-owner Michael Bodnarchek. Kristin Cruz (aka Kris Foster) and Heidi Santelli launched A Band Apart Music Videos as directors&#x27; rep and executive producer, respectively.

===Company closure===
Tarantino and Bender had an amicable split, leaving Tarantino as the sole owner of the studio and the studio being up for liquidation, while David Heyman (&quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot;) produced Tarantino&#x27;s ninth film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

The company is listed for Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (2009) and &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012), and credited for &quot;Grindhouse&quot; (2007).

<text>Maurizio Cattelan (; born 21 September 1960) is an Italian visual artist. Known primarily for his hyperrealistic sculptures and installations, Cattelan&#x27;s practice also includes curating and publishing. His satirical approach to art has resulted in him being frequently labelled as a joker or prankster of the art world. Self-taught as an artist, Cattelan has exhibited internationally in museums and Biennials. Maurizio Cattelan created his most important works of art at Viale Bligny 42 in Milan, where he lived for many years.

In 2011, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City presented a retrospective of his work. Some of Cattelan&#x27;s better-known works include &quot;America&quot;, consisting of a solid gold toilet; &quot;La Nona Ora&quot;, a sculpture depicting a fallen Pope John Paul II who has been hit by a meteorite; and &quot;Comedian&quot;, a fresh banana duct-taped to a wall as a 2019 limited edition of three, one of which sold for $6.2 million in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Cattelan was born on 21 September 1960 in Padua, Italy. He was raised there by his mother, a cleaning lady, and his father, a truck driver. He started his career in the early 1980s by designing and producing wooden furniture in Forlì (Italy). Cattelan has no formal training in art. He has said that in addition to reading art catalogues, &quot;making shows has been my school&quot;.

==Art practice==

Humour and satire are at the core of Cattelan&#x27;s work. This approach has often seen him labelled variously as an art scene joker, jester or prankster. He has been described by Jonathan P. Binstock, curator of contemporary art at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, &quot;as one of the great post-Duchampian artists and a smartass, too&quot;. Discussing the topic of originality with ethnographer, Sarah Thornton, Cattelan explained, &quot;Originality doesn&#x27;t exist by itself. It is an evolution of what is produced. ... Originality is about your capacity to add.&quot; His work was often based on simple puns or subverts clichéd situations by, for example, substituting animals for people in sculptural tableaux. &quot;Frequently morbidly fascinating, Cattelan&#x27;s humour sets his work above the visual pleasure one-liners,&quot; wrote Carol Vogel of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Cattelan&#x27;s first artwork has been noted as a photo art piece in 1989 entitled &quot;Lessico Familiare&quot; (Family Syntax), a framed self-portrait in which he is depicted forming a Hand Heart over his naked chest.

In 1992, Cattelan started the &quot;Oblomov Foundation&quot; (named after Ivan Goncharov&#x27;s 1859 novel &quot;Oblomov&quot; and its idle main character) which raised ten thousand dollars to offer as a grant to an artist who would undertake not to make or show any work for one year. Since there were no successful applicants, Cattelan used the money for a long holiday in New York.

Cattelan is commonly noted for his use of taxidermy during the mid-1990s. &quot;Novecento&quot; (1997) consists of the taxidermied body of a former racehorse named Tiramisu, which hangs by a harness in an elongated, drooping posture. Another work utilizing taxidermy is &quot;Bidibidobidiboo&quot; (1996), a miniature depiction of a squirrel slumped over its kitchen table, a handgun at its feet.

In 1999, he started making life-size wax effigies of various subjects, including himself. One of his best known sculptures, &quot;La Nona Ora&quot; (1999), consists of an effigy of Pope John Paul II in full ceremonial costume being crushed by a meteor.

===Curating===
In 1999, he co-curated with Jens Hoffmann the 6th Caribbean Biennial.

In 2002, he co-founded with Ali Subotnick and Massimiliano Gioni &quot;The Wrong Gallery&quot;, a glass door leading to a 2.5 square foot exhibition space at 516A½ West 20th street in New York City. After the building housing the gallery was sold, the door and gallery was put on display within the collection of the Tate Modern until 2009.

With long-term collaborators Subotnick and Gioni, Cattelan also curated the 2006 Berlin Biennale. Articles by Cattelan frequently appear in international publications such as &quot;Flash Art&quot;.

===Publishing===
From 1996 to 2007, Cattelan collaborated with Dominique Gonzalez-Foster and Paola Manfrin on the publication &quot;Permanent Food&quot;, an occasional journal consisting of a pastiche of pages torn from other magazines and submissions by artists of similar material. From 2002 he collaborated on the satirical arts journal &quot;Charley&quot;, a series on contemporary artists.

In 2009, Cattelan teamed up with Italian photographer Pierpaolo Ferrari to create an editorial for &quot;W&quot;″s Art Issue.

In 2010, they founded the magazine &quot;Toiletpaper&quot;, a bi-annual, picture-based publication. As part of a public art series at the High Line in 2012, &quot;Toiletpaper&quot; was commissioned with a billboard at the corner of 10th Avenue and West 18th Street in New York, showing an image of a woman&#x27;s manicured and jeweled fingers, detached from their hands, emerging from a vibrant blue velvet background. In 2014, Cattelan and Ferrari produced a fashion spread for the Spring Fashion issue of &quot;New York&quot;.

In the project entitled &quot;1968&quot;, A &quot;Toiletpaper&quot; collaboration between Maurizio Cattelan, Pierpaolo Ferrari and the Deste Foundation in Athens, Cattelan celebrates the works and time of Dakis Joannou and his collection of radical design.

&quot;Toilet Paper&quot; differs from the two previously magazine projects, as its photographs were planned and designated solely for the magazine. The level of originality for this magazine surpassed the others, providing the audience vague, oddly familiar photographs to peruse through. &quot;Toilet Paper&quot; is a surrealist pantomime of images that the viewer cannot easily trace back to a starting point, while they&#x27;ve most likely been conjured by popular culture. It is a whirlwind of loud colors mixed in with the occasional black-and-white photo: &quot;the pictures probe the unconscious, tapping into sublimated perversions and spasms of violence.&quot;

==Selected works==

*&quot;Working Is a Bad Job&quot; (1993): At the 1993 Venice Biennale he leased his allotted space to an advertising agency, which installed a billboard promoting a new perfume.
* &quot;Errotin, le vrai Lapin&quot; (1995), in which he persuaded his gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin to wear a giant pink rabbit costume shaped like a phallus to Cattelan&#x27;s gallery opening
* &quot;Another Fucking Readymade&quot; (1996): As a profound example of found art, for an exhibition at the de Appel Arts Center in Amsterdam, he stole the entire contents of another artist&#x27;s show from a nearby gallery with the satirical idea of passing it off as his own readymade work, until the police insisted he return the loot on threat of arrest.
* &quot;Turisti&quot; (1997), taxidermied pigeons and fake pigeon feces exhibited in the Italian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale of 1997
* In 1997, at the Consortium in Dijon, Cattelan dug a coffin-shaped hole in the floor of the museum&#x27;s main gallery.
* &quot;Mother&quot; (1999); at the 1999 Venice Biennale, Cattelan executed this piece, a project that involved an Indian fakir, who practiced a daily ritual of being buried beneath sand in a small room, with only his clasped hands visible.
* &quot;Untitled&quot; (2001), installation created for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam that depicts the artist peering mischievously from a hole in the floor at a gallery of 17th-century Dutch masters.
* &quot;Him&quot; (2001): a sculpture resembling a schoolboy kneeling in prayer, except that the head has been replaced with the realistic likeness of Adolf Hitler.
* As part of the 2001 Venice Biennale, he erected a full sized HOLLYWOOD sign over the largest rubbish tip on Palermo, Sicily.

* &quot;La rivoluzione siamo noi (We Are The Revolution)&quot; (2000), features a miniature Maurizio Cattelan, dangling from a Marcel Breuer–designed clothing rack. In this depiction, Cattelan contrasts the German artist Joseph Beuys statement, &quot;every man is an artist&quot;, with his own, &quot;I am not an artist&quot;. 
* &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget to Call Your Mother&quot; (2000), is a photograph by Cattelan that was utilized as a show invitation card, upon its introduction, by the Marian Goodman Gallery in New York City. &quot;The sign ironically reminds customers of their mothers&#x27; worries each time they approach the bar to drink...in mimicking this stern parental directive, the sign draws on attitudes regarding authority, independence, and disobedience&quot; (Susan Thompson).
* &quot;Daddy, Daddy&quot; (2008) was initially premiered in the group exhibition &quot;theanyspacewhatever&quot; (2008–09) at the Guggenheim Museum. The piece was a site-specific installation in a small pool at the bottom of the Frank Lloyd Wright atrium rotunda, where a life-size Pinocchio doll lay face-down, giving the impression that he had jumped or fallen from above. &quot;Cattelan&#x27;s life-size effigy of a beloved fairytale character lying face down in the museum&#x27;s fountain reads as a crime scene replete with questions of intent: suicide, homicide, or ill-planned escape?&quot; 
* &quot;L.O.V.E.&quot; (2011), a white marble sculpture middle finger sticking straight up from an otherwise fingerless hand, pointing away from Borsa Italiana in Milan.

* &quot;Turisti&quot; (2011), for the 2011 Venice Biennale, was made of 2,000 embalmed pigeons, not to be confused with the similarly-named &quot;Turisti&quot; (1997).
*&quot;America&quot; (2016), an 18-karat solid gold toilet, stolen from an exhibition in England in 2019.
*&quot;Comedian&quot; (2019), a banana duct taped to a wall, shown at Art Basel Miami. The edible part was eaten by the Georgian artist David Datuna (1974-2022) in a performance art piece called &quot;Hungry Artist&quot;.
*&quot;Blind&quot; (2021), a memorial to the victims of the September 11 attacks, featuring black resin monolith representing one of the World Trade Center towers intersected by the silhouette of a jetliner.

==Exhibitions==
===Retrospectives===
A major retrospective titled &quot;All&quot;, assembling 130 objects of Cattelan&#x27;s career since 1989, opened in 2011 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. On the occasion of the exhibition, Cattelan announced his early retirement.

In 2016 the Monnaie de Paris his retrospective of his work titled &quot;Not Afraid of Love&quot;.

===Biennials===
Cattelan has participated in the Venice Biennale (1993, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2011), Manifesta 2 (1998), Luxembourg, Melbourne International Biennial 1999, and the 2004 Whitney Biennial in New York.

==Art market==
At a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in 2004, Cattelan&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of Trotsky&quot; (1996), a taxidermic horse suspended by ropes from a ceiling, was sold for $2 million, a record for the artist.

==Recognition==
Cattelan was a finalist for the Guggenheim&#x27;s Hugo Boss Prize in 2000, received an honorary degree in Sociology from the University of Trento, Italy. In 2004, he was awarded the Arnold Bode prize from the Kunstverein Kassel, Germany. A career prize (a gold medal) was awarded to Maurizio Cattelan by the 15th Rome Quadriennale. On 24 March 2009, at the MAXXI Museum of Rome, singer and musician Elio came to receive the prize, claiming to be the real Cattelan.

==Film==
A documentary film titled &quot;Maurizio Cattelan: Be Right Back&quot; was released in 2017. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, and played in theaters in 2017. The film, directed by Maura Axelrod, featured curator Massimiliano Gioni standing in for Cattelan. It followed Cattelan&#x27;s career retrospective at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.

==Television==
On the occasion of his 2011 retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, Cattelan was profiled on the American television program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. In 2016 a documentary about his life and work, &quot;The Art World&#x27;s Prankster: Maurizio Cattelan&quot;, aired on BBC.

==Controversies== 

In 2010, Sicilian artist Giuseppe Veneziano created a representation of Cattelan hanged with a noose around his neck and displayed it in the Vatican.

In 2017, when the Trump administration White House requested the loan of a Vincent van Gogh painting from the Guggenheim collection, &quot;Landscape with Snow&quot;, the museum&#x27;s chief curator Nancy Spector suggested instead Cattelan&#x27;s work &quot;America&quot;, a sculpture of a gold toilet.

On December 7, 2019, &quot;Comedian&quot;, an artwork created by Cattelan in an edition of three for the 2019 installment of Art Basel Miami Beach consisting of a banana held to a wall by duct tape, sold to an unnamed French art collector for $120,000. The fruit in the work was later summarily eaten by Georgian performance artist David Datuna, who called his piece &quot;Hungry Artist&quot;. Meanwhile Galerie Perrotin, which was exhibiting another edition of the piece, replaced the fruit and stated that it is an &quot;idea&quot;, while Datuna said &quot;it was very delicious&quot;. On 27 April 2023 a similar intervention occurred when Noh Hyun-soo, a student from Seoul National University, ate the banana at the Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art. Using the original tape, he then re-affixed the peel back onto the wall. The peel was later replaced by the museum with a fresh banana.

Artist Joe Morford filed a suit against Cattelan for copyright infringement of his 2000 work titled &quot;Banana &amp; Orange&quot;. &quot;Banana &amp; Orange&quot; features plastic replicas of the titular fruits duct taped to two green panels. Given Morford&#x27;s claimed similarities between &quot;Comedian&quot; and &quot;Banana &amp; Orange&quot;, Morford pursued a claim of copyright infringement, alleging that &quot;Comedian&quot; unfairly copied &quot;Banana &amp; Orange&quot;. Morford further claimed that Cattelan might have seen his work and been influenced by it. On June 9, 2023, judge Robert N. Scolar, Jr., a US district judge for the southern district of Florida, granted Cattelan&#x27;s motion for summary judgment, closing the case prior to trial.

<text>Alfred Percy Sinnett (18 January 1840 – 26 June 1921) was an English author and theosophist.

== Biography ==

Sinnett was born in London. His father died while he was young, as in 1851 Sinnett was listed as a &quot;Scholar – London University&quot;, living with his mother Jane Sinnett, an author and translator, who is listed as a widow and whose occupation is listed as &quot;Periodical Literature&quot;; his older sister Sophia, age 22, was a teacher. Jane&#x27;s sister Sarah, age 48, was also a teacher.

In 1870 Sinnett married his wife Patience, probably in the London area. He is listed in the 1871 England Census at age 31, as a Journalist, born in Middlesex. His wife Patience is 27, and her mother Clarissa Edenson a &quot;Landowner&quot;, is living with them.By 1879, Sinnett had moved to India where he was &quot;... the Editor of &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, the leading English Daily of India...&quot; He relates in his book, &quot;The Occult World&quot; that: &quot;...on the first occasion of my making Madame Blavatsky&#x27;s acquaintance she became a guest at my home at Allahabad and remained there for six weeks...&quot;

In 1880 Helena Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott visited the Sinnetts at their summer home in Simla. The &quot;Mahatma Letters&quot;, which generated the controversy that later helped lead to the split of the Theosophical Society were mostly written to Sinnett or his wife Patience. The letters started at this time when Sinnett asked Blavatsky whether if he wrote a letter to her Mahatmas, she could arrange to have it delivered.

By 1884 Sinnett was back in England, where that year Constance Wachtmeister states that she met Blavatsky at the home of the Sinnetts in London.

Sinnett asked Charles Webster Leadbeater to come back to England to tutor his son Percy and George Arundale. Leadbeater agreed and brought with him one of his pupils Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa. Using &quot;astral clairvoyance&quot; Leadbeater assisted William Scott-Elliot to write his book &quot;The Story of Atlantis&quot;, for which Sinnett wrote the preface.

Sinnett was later president of the London Lodge of the Society.

By 1901 Sinnett is listed as an author. His son Percy is also listed as an author and born in India.

<doc id="1053652" wikidata="Q2064589" url="?curid=1053652" title="Incredible Crisis">
<text>Incredible Crisis, known in Japan as , is a PlayStation video game developed by Polygon Magic. The game was published in Japan by Tokuma Shoten on June 24, 1999. Translated versions were released by Titus Interactive in North America and Europe throughout November 2000.

&quot;Incredible Crisis&quot; follows four members of a working-class Japanese family on their bizarre adventures from their daily routines while trying to get home early for the family&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s birthday. The game consists of several action-oriented minigames strung together and book-ended with pre-rendered cutscenes. The game was directed by Takayuki Watanabe, who designed and scripted the game with Kenichi Nishi, and features music from the Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Incredible Crisis&quot; consists of 24 levels (26 in the Japanese version) spread over four main parts, with each part focusing on one of the four members of the Tanamatsuri family: Taneo, Etsuko, Tsuyoshi, and Ririka. Each level revolves around a minigame, some of which are repeated, which the player must clear in order to proceed. These games range from action-based objectives such as dodging obstacles and rhythm games, to puzzle-based objectives such as answering a quiz and finding items that are on sale. Each of these levels has a stress meter that represents how close the player is to failing the level objective which, depending on the minigame, fills from either making mistakes, drawing closer to a pursuing obstacle, or running out of time. A life is lost if the meter becomes completely full, with extra lives earned by performing well after each individual chapter. Minigames that have been played in the main story can be replayed from the main menu.

==Plot==
At the Tanamatsuri home, it is grandmother Hatsu&#x27;s birthday. She wants everyone home early for her special day: the day that serves as a reminder that she has been alive for more years than she can remember. However, her family has completely forgotten to make up last-minute birthday promises to Hatsu. The game begins like any other normal day for the family members - father Taneo, mother Etsuko, daughter Ririka, and son Tsuyoshi - until strings of events stand as obstacles in their way of returning to Hatsu&#x27;s with the presents.

The first chapter revolves around father Taneo, who is working in his office when suddenly he is ordered to dance by his supervisor along with his peers. After doing so in quite a frenzy, his co-workers then run off seemingly in fear of something. Taneo turns round to investigate, when he sees a giant boulder-like statue part (which was being placed onto a statue nearby, but accidentally came off) come crashing through the wall; and is forced to run down corridors from it, until he reaches the safety of an elevator which he uses to descend. The boulder comes crashing from above, shooting debris down while Taneo desperately works on activating an emergency stop. Eventually, the boulder also shoots down onto the elevator, and in an explosion, Taneo is shot out of the window. Falling to certain death, Taneo luckily grabs onto a flagpole - but it cannot take his weight, and thus Taneo falls once more; various things slow his descent, and he lands safely. The boulder emerges again through the building&#x27;s main entrance, but he easily evades it - not long after though, a piece of the statue which was holding the flagpole lands on his head, knocking him unconscious. He later wakes up in an ambulance, strapped to a stretcher while the paramedics ask him questions to check his thinking state. After answering the questions correctly, they accidentally send Taneo - still strapped to the stretcher - out of the ambulance and into the traffic, due to their over-excitement. However, Taneo successfully dodges the traffic and breaks free of his restraints; but when he does so, he crashes into the boulder from before (which miraculously appears). When he recovers, he is helped by an attractive lady, who soon leaves him. Taneo, seemingly in love, follows her onto a Ferris wheel and gives her an erotic back-massage. Afterwards, she suddenly jumps from the Ferris wheel and onto a helicopter, before pointing out she left a bomb behind Taneo. The bomb explodes, sending Taneo onto the helicopter. Soon he makes it off and sees a UFO, which two navy ships are trying to destroy. However, Taneo commandeers a turret and shoots down their missiles, saving the UFO. Eventually, Taneo himself is shot upon by a missile, exploding the turret and sending him high into the sky - but somehow lands safely and gets onto a boat. He gets curious about a block on the boat and removes it, which unwittingly starts sinking the boat. Taneo and the boat owner successfully block the hole and return to shore, where Taneo decides to take the subway. Once boarding the train, he finds it strangely empty, and the attractive woman from before appears, revealing she has cut the brakes of the train. The train crashes into obstacles on the tracks and finally bursts out of the tunnel, depositing Taneo right outside Hatsu&#x27;s house.

The second chapter focuses on mother Etsuko, who is out buying ingredients for Hatsu&#x27;s birthday dinner. She goes to the bank, but finds a robbery underway, and nearly manages to sneak away but is noticed at the last minute. The bank robbers choose Etsuko to investigate the vault, and she is ordered to take a golden piggy bank, which she finds booby-trapped and thus must replace its weight using her groceries. She gives the piggy bank to her captors, whose leader, who reveals herself to be the beautiful lady Taneo would chase after, forces her to open it by inputting musical commands which two of the bank robbers demonstrate. The piggy bank opens and transforms into a device that shoots lasers. Etsuko manages to remove its head using her groceries, causing it to explode and launch her and the robbers through the back wall of the bank and out into the snow. They attempt to shoot Etsuko, but she manages to outrun them by snowboard, then falls into a gorge. Sometime later, Etsuko awakens in a secret military air jet hangar, where she decides to pilot a jet to get back home. After take off, she discovers that a giant bear, with a tag saying &quot;Ririka&quot; attached to it, destroying the city. Piloting the last remaining jet, Etsuko must shoot the bear down. After its defeat, she returns to Hatsu&#x27;s house to prepare sukiyaki for dinner.

The third chapter features son Tsuyoshi, who is out reading in a park. To his amazement, he witnesses a teddy bear grow to giant size not too far away (the same bear that Etsuko encountered) which gives off pink rays - one of which comes into contact with Tsuyoshi and shrinks him to miniature size. He must then run away from a ravenous antlion while avoiding mudslides, then escape a spider&#x27;s web, and following an encounter with the unfortunate boat owner who helped Taneo earlier - in which Tsuyoshi, too, unplugs the block and nearly causes the boat to sink - he has to escape pursuit from a praying mantis, after which a friendly ant leads him through a series of underground tunnels straight to Hatsu&#x27;s backyard.

The final chapter is told from the perspective of daughter Ririka, who is in class at her private girls&#x27; school. While in homeroom, her friend tells her about a new store. Wanting to go there, Ririka makes her classmates switch seats (causing many of them to be knocked out by chalk thrown by the teacher) so she can get to the exit. Riding the subway to Shibuya, she unknowingly comes across the leader of the criminals who would rob the bank where Etsuko was, and later set up Taneo for the fall. She reaches the store and buys four items on sale. When Ririka leaves to return to school, she spots a &quot;take a picture on a bear&quot; photo machine outside a toy store. While she&#x27;s getting ready to have hers taken, a tiny UFO appears in front of her, upsetting her and causing her picture to be printed on the teddy bear with an angry frown. Ririka yells at the UFO and tries to capture it, but it shoots beams that cause different things to shrink or grow at random, one hitting the teddy bear dispensed out of the machine. It starts growing while Ririka chases the small UFO into a karaoke parlor, where her friend calls her to join them, starting a karaoke sequence (removed from the English version). Ririka then chases the UFO outside, and past a big TV screen where she grabs the UFO. After seeing the mothership on the news on the screen, she calls Taneo and tells him to shoot the missiles heading for the mothership after threatening to never clean her room again. After Taneo agrees, Ririka goes to the screen and plays a game of Simon Says by pressing the colors on the small UFO matching the flashing colors of the mothership, interrupted by a &quot;Please Wait&quot; sign and a news story of the giant teddy bear attacking Tokyo, the bank robbery Etsuko witnessed, and the big boulder, with Ririka&#x27;s teacher throwing chalk at it. She arrives at a bay and rides the boat that her brother and dad rode, also almost sinking it. After Ririka gets to her destination (and the UFO shrinks the boat, leading to its owner&#x27;s encounter with Tsuyoshi), she takes a delivery bike leaning against a wall and rides away from a crane/bulldozer manned by the bank robbers and their leader. Managing to outrun the criminals, who meet their fate as the crane runs off the road into the water, Ririka and her bike are lifted into the sky into the mothership (silhouetted briefly against the moon in homage to E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial) and deposited in front of her house, surprising Hatsu for the last time.

==Development==
&quot;Incredible Crisis&quot; was developed by Polygon Magic. The design and script was done by Kenichi Nishi, a director at Love-de-Lic and future co-founder of Skip Ltd. known for his unconventional approach to game production. The game&#x27;s art director was Naozumi Yamaguchi, a former Human Entertainment employee who would later go on to work with Sega on projects such as &quot;Phantasy Star Universe&quot;.

Titus Interactive acquired the rights to publish the game abroad, and introduced it as their only PlayStation title at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2000. Virgin Interactive obtained exclusive rights to distribute the game in Europe. Two minigames, which involve bomb disarming and karaoke respectively, were removed from the localized release of the game, reportedly because they relied too much on kanji and Japanese language, making them difficult to translate. The game&#x27;s musical score was composed by the Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra. A CD titled &quot;Tondemo Crisis! Original Soundtrack&quot;, featuring 25 songs from the game, was released in Japan by Avex Trax on July 23, 1999.

==Reception==
According to Media Create sales records, the PlayStation version sold 70,760 units by the end of 1999, making it the 184th best-selling video game in Japan for that year. Also, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 29 out of 40. Elsewhere, the same console version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Eric Bratcher of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t last long, but everyone on the planet should play &quot;Incredible Crisis&quot; at least once.&quot;

The PlayStation version was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Game Story&quot; and &quot;Best Puzzle Game&quot; awards among console games. It won the award for &quot;Best Other Game&quot; in both Editors&#x27; and Readers&#x27; Choice at &quot;IGN&quot;″s Best of 2000 Awards, and was a runner-up for Story. The game was also nominated for the &quot;Most Innovative Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Game with the Most Laughs&quot; awards at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s Blister Awards 2000, both of which went to &quot;Jet Grind Radio&quot; and &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;, respectively.

Jess Ragan of &quot;1Up.com&quot;, in his retroactive review, felt that the game, for its time, was an innovative introduction to mini-game compilation titles. &quot;&quot;Incredible Crisis&quot; was an important first step for this new genre of games,&quot; Ragan stated. &quot;But even with its wacky situations and hyperactive ska music, it&#x27;s been badly outclassed by Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Wario Ware&quot; series.&quot;

<text>In computer programming languages, codice_1 is a generic label used in generic programming to reference an unknown data type, data structure, or class. TypeParameter is most frequently used in C++ templates and Java generics . TypeParameter is similar to a metasyntactic variable (e.g., codice_2 and codice_3), but distinct. It is not the name of a generic type variable, but the name of a generic &quot;type of&quot; variable.

The capitalisation varies according to programming language and programmer preference. codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8 are all possible. Alternate labels are also used, especially in complex templates where more than one type parameter is necessary. codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14 are typical alternate labels. Many programming languages are case-sensitive, making a consistent choice of labels important. The CamelCase codice_4 is one of the most commonly used.

<text>Tomoko Takahashi is a Japanese artist. She was born in Tokyo in 1966 and has based in London since the early 1990s. She studied at Tama Art University, Goldsmiths College and the Slade School of Fine Art.

Takahashi&#x27;s main medium is installation art, often made of found objects, and is generally site-specific. She studied painting at Tama Art University, however, in around 1994, whilst a student at Goldsmiths she developed an interest in working with found objects.

She first came to attention when she won the EAST award at EASTinternational in 1997 and she has exhibited broadly worldwide since. She has exhibited her work at Beaconsfield, London (1998), the Saatchi Gallery in the 1999 &quot;New Neurotic realism&quot; exhibition, UCLA&#x27;s Hammer Gallery (2002–03), the Serpentine Galleries in London, the De La Warr Pavilion (2010). and her work has been collected by the Tate.

In 2000 she was shortlisted for the Turner Prize, along with Glenn Brown, Michael Raedecker, and eventual winner Wolfgang Tillmans.

Takahashi&#x27;s preferred method for her artistic process, specifically for installation pieces, consists of her inhabiting the space in which the art will be collected. She collects scraps and debris from the site, which she often incorporates into the final product. While these scenes generally incite an idea of chaos, Takahashi&#x27;s attention to detail is a hallmark of her work. Her first installation of this kind was Company Deal (1997), which utilized the waste of an office space to spill over its walls and furniture. Company Deal was commissioned by an advertising agency in Battersea for their office space.

In addition to installations, Takahashi&#x27;s work has been sold by the auction houses Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s. This work includes installations, but also prints, mixed media wall art, and a series of &quot;An Occasional Table.&quot;

<doc id="1053682" wikidata="Q6477" url="?curid=1053682" title="Pirna">
<text>Pirna (; , ) is a town in Saxony, Germany and capital of the administrative district Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge. The town&#x27;s population is over 37,000. Pirna is located near Dresden and is an important district town as well as a &quot;Große Kreisstadt&quot;.

== Geography ==

=== Geographical location ===
Pirna is located in the vicinity of the Sandstone Mountains in the upper Elbe valley, where two nearby tributaries, Wesenitz from the north and Gottleuba from the south, flow into the Elbe. It is also called the &quot;gate to the Saxon Switzerland&quot; (Ger: &quot;Tor zur Sächsischen Schweiz&quot;). The Saxon wine region (Ger: &quot;Sächsische Weinstraße&quot;), which was established in 1992, stretches from Pirna via Pillnitz, Dresden, and Meissen to Diesbar-Seußlitz.

=== Neighboring municipalities ===
Pirna is located southeast of Dresden. Neighboring municipalities
are Bad Gottleuba-Berggießhübel (town), Bahretal, Dohma, Dohna (town), 
Dürrröhrsdorf-Dittersbach, Heidenau (town), Königstein (town), Lohmen,
Stadt Wehlen (town), and Struppen.

== Names ==
*

== Language ==
The regiolect spoken in Pirna is &quot;Südostmeißenisch&quot;, which is part of the Upper Saxon German group of regiolects.

== History ==
=== Stone Age ===
Tools made of flint from the late Paleolithic (about 12,000-8000 BC), at the end of the last ice age, are evidence for the earliest human settlement in the area. Later on, people belonging to the Linear Pottery culture, who farmed grain and cattle, lived here during the Neolithic (5500-4000 BC) because of a good climate and Loess soil. Around 600 AD a Slavic group called the Sorbs, who were fishermen and farmers, succeeded the Germanic tribes in the Elbe Valley, who had lived in the area for a couple of centuries from the 4th century BC on. The name &quot;Pirna&quot; derives from the Sorbian phrase, &quot;na pernem&quot;, meaning on the hard (stone) and is also related to the Slavic deity Perun, whose cult was present in all Slavic and Baltic territories. The representation of a pear tree in the coat of arms was a later cryptic representation of the Perun cult, covered up by a fanciful, German-language notion about the town&#x27;s name (&quot;pear&quot; is &quot;Birne&quot; in German, which sounds rather like &quot;Pirna&quot; ).

=== Middle Ages ===
With the conquest of the Slavic communities and the founding of the Mark by the Germans (Henry the Fowler founded the castle of Meissen in 929), settlement in the Pirna area is again verifiable. The castle in Pirna, which was mentioned for the first time in 1269, probably already existed in the 11th century. In the context of the second Eastern German colonization the town was founded by Henry III, Margrave of Meissen.

The streets are aligned from east to west and north to south forming a chessboard-like system. Only the streets east of the church are not aligned in this form, caused by the nearby &quot;Burgberg&quot;. In 1233, Pirna was mentioned officially for the first time in a document. In 1293, King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia acquired both town and castle from the Bishop of Meissen. Therefore Pirna belonged to Bohemia until 1405.

=== Early Modern times ===
In 1502, the construction of the new church was begun under Meister Peter Ulrich von Pirna.

With the introduction of the Reformation into Saxony in 1539, Anton Lauterbach, a friend of Martin Luther, became pastor and superintendent. In 1544 the strategically important castle was upgraded to a fortress by Maurice, Elector of Saxony. Three years later, it withstood the siege by elector John Frederick, Elector of Saxony in the Schmalkaldic War.

On April 23, 1639, the town was invaded by Swedish troops under the commander in chief of the Swedish army, Johan Banér. During the five-month long siege of the fortress, which was in the end futile, the town was greatly devastated. About 600 people were murdered (&quot;Pirnaisches Elend&quot;, lit. &quot;Misery of Pirna&quot;). In around 1670, based upon recent military developments, the Sonnenstein fortress was built. Only the powerful stonework still exists today. In 1707, Pirna had debts that related to the Great Northern War of more than 100,000 Thalers.

=== Prussian Pirna ===

On August 29, 1756, the small Saxon army fled before the Prussians, who had invaded without declaring war, to the levels between Königstein Fortress and Sonnenstein Castle and capitulated there on October 16, two days after Sonnenstein surrendered. In 1758, Austrian troops and the Imperial Army besieged the fortress.

=== Napoleonic Pirna ===

A &quot;Kattundruck&quot; manufactory for cotton printing opened as the first of its kind in 1774. In 1811 the physician Ernst Gottlob Pienitz opened a very large mental hospital in Castle Sonnenstein. But when on September 14, 1813, French troops occupied the Sonnenstein, they forced the evacuation of 275 patients, seized supplies and tore the roof trusses out to remove a fire threat. In September 1813, emperor Napoleon temporarily lived at the Marienhaus, located at the market. Until Dresden&#x27;s surrender on November 11 the French defended the fortress. Only in February 1814 the hospital for the mentally ill was able to open again.

=== Industrial revolution, Imperial Germany and the Weimar Republic ===
In 1837, steamship travel began on the upper Elbe. A few years later, in 1848, a railway line connecting Dresden and Pirna opened. In 1880, the first section of the &quot;Sekundärbahn&quot;-type railway line from Pirna to Gottleuba, the Gottleuba Valley railway was opened. The line was closed in 1976. In 1894, another railway line opened was the Pirna–Großcotta railway, connecting Pirna with the Lohmgrund, a major location of Saxonian sandstone quarries. It closed in 1999.

Pirna became an industrial town in 1862 with the building of factories. Mechanical engineering, glass, cellulose and rayon production also expanded. In 1875, the sandstone Elbbrücke was completed. During the First World War Pirna became a garrison and the engineer battalions 12 and 5 of the Royal Saxon field artillery regiment No. 64 were billeted on Rottwerndorfer Straße. In 1922/23, the town incorporated several municipalities including Posta, Niedervogelgesang, Obervogelgesang, Copitz, Hinterjessen, Neundorf, Zuschendorf, Rottwerndorf and Zehista. The population totaled about 30,000 inhabitants.

=== Nazi Germany and World War II ===
From early 1940 until end of June 1942, a part of the large mental asylum within Sonnenstein Castle was converted into a euthanasia killing center: the Sonnenstein Nazi Death Institute. It was a testing ground for initial development of certain methods, later generally adopted and refined for usage associated with the Final Solution. A gas chamber and crematorium were installed in the cellar of the former men&#x27;s sanitary (building C 16). A high brick-wall on two sides of the complex shielded it from outside view. Four buildings were located inside this brick-wall shielding. They were used as offices, living rooms for the personnel, etc. Sleeping quarters for the men responsible for incinerating the bodies were provided in the attic of building C 16. It is possible that other sections of the buildings were also used by Action T4.

From end of June 1940 until September 1942, approximately 15,000 persons were killed in the scope of the mass murder by involuntary euthanasia program and the Sonderbehandlung Action 14f13. The personnel list consisted of about 100 persons. One third of them were reassigned to the extermination camps in occupied Poland, because of their recent experiences in deception, killing, gassing and incinerating of people. There, they were trained by the detachments responsible for organized killing in camps like Treblinka.

These killings ceased after pressure was exerted on the authorities by the local population. During August and September 1942, the Sonnenstein killing center was closed and incriminating installations such as gas chamber installations and crematorium ovens dismantled. After October 1942, the buildings were used as a military hospital.

This part of the town&#x27;s history was largely unrecognized in Germany until 1989, but after the regime change which was happening during this period, efforts to remember these catastrophic events began. In June 2000 a permanent exhibition opened, and today a small plaque at the base of Sonnenstein Castle together with the Sonnenstein Memorial provide remembrance.

At the end of the war several air raids took place mainly targeting the railway station in Pirna and the Děčín–Dresden Railway. The air raid on April 19, 1945, destroyed all railway tracks and also the bridge over the Elbe. Though there were only strategic targets most of the over 200 dead were civilians.

=== During the GDR ===
During the existence of the GDR and its economic model, a so-called planned economy, people mostly worked in publicly owned enterprises:
* the artificial silk factory (which formerly belonged to Hugo Küttner, a well-known artificial silk business owner) established at an industrial zone located near today&#x27;s B 172
* the cellulose fiber factory (its location has been between the railway line &amp; the Gottleuba river flowing into the Elbe)
* the VEB Strömungsmaschinen Pirna (a builder of hydraulic machinery) on the Sonnenstein, originally being founded in 1956 as VEB Entwicklungsbau Pirna
* the Wismut in Königstein
Among other things, Pirna 014 turbines for the &quot;152&quot; jet aircraft developed in the GDR were built at VEB Strömungsmaschinen. All these businesses did not continue to exist for long after reunification, because they were not competitive. The Elbe river was heavily polluted by industry wastewater, especially from the cellulose fiber factory; swimming in the river was no longer possible without dangers to health.

In the mid-1980s, around 1,700 un-renovated apartments stood empty in Pirna, 400 of them in the old town. Individual particularly badly dilapidated houses were demolished in the period that followed, for example a house on the southeast corner of the market square and the so-called &quot;Kern’sche Haus&quot; in the &quot;Burgstraße&quot;. When in 1989 the &quot;Teufelserkerhaus&quot; was to be torn down as part of demolition measures in the old town, public demonstrations happened with people shouting “Save Pirna”. From this circle, the &quot;Kuratorium Altstadt&quot; (literally &quot;Old Town Board of Trustees&quot;) was formed, which provided outstanding services during the period of reconstruction which began after the fall of the Berlin Wall.

=== After German Re-unification ===
The de-industrialization in the course of German reunification, unprecedented in the history of the town, was formative. The immediate transition to a market economy led to the shutdown of a considerable part of the structure-determining industrial companies. In the three largest factories of silk, fluid machinery and cellulose fiber alone, more than 5,000 jobs were lost by the mid-1990s as a result of closure and liquidation by the &quot;Treuhandanstalt&quot;. It is true that new jobs were created in the service industry; however, these alone could not compensate for such a huge loss. The establishment of new jobs in the manufacturing industry turned out to be difficult, not least because of the lack of a federal highway connection.

The reconstruction of the inner town has been advanced considerably since the beginning of the 1990s with intensive funding from the urban development funding programs. In the meantime, over 90% of the 300 buildings in the historic old town have been renovated. The number of inhabitants in the redevelopment area of the old town has doubled since the end of the 1990s, from almost 1,000 to almost 2,000 (as of 2013). The market square and the surrounding alleys have developed into a district quite worth seeing with shops, bars and cafes, as well as other cultural offerings (including the Tom-Pauls-Theater). The renovation of the old town repeatedly brought historical features to light. During the renovation of a house on the market square, for example, an approx. 500-year-old wall painting was uncovered that shows a &quot;wrong&quot; type of wild animal hunting - animals hunting and devouring humans - and which, according to the Saxon State Office for Monument Protection, is unique in this form in Saxony. In addition, valuable wooden beam ceilings were exposed in numerous houses.
In August 2002, the town suffered great damage during the widespread flooding in Europe, reaching its apex on 16 August. Two factors greatly worsened the effect: First, the large earthen structure supporting the railway line acted as a dam, retaining the waters both longer and higher on the towns&#x27; side. Second, all the shop-fronts which had been renovated post-unification were practically all kind of sealed in terms of water-tightness: the floodwaters rose outside whilst the shops themselves stayed dry inside; but when reaching certain critical points, the weight of the water then suddenly destroyed these shop-fronts when the windows broke. Ironically, older &quot;leaky&quot; shopfronts did not suffer this fate, as the water built up height and thus pressure equally on both sides. Whilst international media mainly concentrated on the impact upon Dresden the impact upon Pirna was proportionately much worse. Schöna and Bad Schandau were also affected heavily.

In July 2005, Pirna finally received federal highway access via its own connection, when a section from Dresden to Pirna of the Bundesautobahn 17 was completed. The extension to the Czech border was opened to traffic in December 2006.

The inner town and the areas close to the Elbe in Pirna were again affected by severe flooding by the Elbe in June 2013, while still being severe, it failed to meet the record levels of the 2002 flood: The water level of the Elbe reached a height of (2002: ). By June 5, 2013, around 7,700 people had to be evacuated, and about 1000 buildings were affected by the water.

== Politics ==
The mayor in Pirna is elected every seven years. 

Markus Ulbig (CDU) held this position from 2001 to 2009. He was last confirmed in office on June 8, 2008 with 64.87 percent of the vote. Ulbig was appointed Saxon Interior Minister and the post went to the non-party mayor Christian Flörke. In January 2010 there were new elections in which Klaus-Peter Hanke (Free Voters) was elected with 60% in the second round. In 2017, Hanke was re-elected with 60.5% of the vote in the first round. 

In December 2023, Tim Lochner was elected Mayor of Prina. Lochner is independent of a party, but was nominated as a candidate by the right-wing party AfD. It is the first mayor of a city with more than 20,000 inhabitants to be appointed by the AfD.

<text>USS &quot;Waters&quot; (DD-115) was a in the United States Navy during World War I and World War II, later re-designated a high speed transport with the hull identification number APD-8. She was named in honor of Daniel Waters.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Waters&quot; was laid down on 26 July 1917 at Philadelphia by William Cramp &amp; Sons. The ship was launched on 3 March 1918, sponsored by Miss Mary Borland Thayer. The destroyer was commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 8 August 1918.

== Service history ==

=== World War I ===
Although her active service began late in World War I, &quot;Waters&quot; still managed to get in two round-trip voyages to the British Isles and one to the Azores before the armistice in November 1918. On 11 August, she joined a convoy at Tompkinsville, New York, and put to sea for England. She escorted her charges safely into Devonport on 23 August and stood out again four days later in the screen for four ships headed home.

The destroyer delivered the small convoy at New York on 6 September and, following a three-day layover, departed once again—this time bound for Ireland. Eleven days later, she entered the port at Buncrana. She remained there for eight days before again putting to sea. On 8 October, &quot;Waters&quot; arrived in New York and, but for a run to Newport, Rhode Island, on 31 October and 1 November, remained there until she put to sea with a convoy again on 4 November. This one was made up of 11 merchantmen bound for the Azores. &quot;Waters&quot; and her convoy were still three days steaming time from Ponta Delgada on 11 November 1918, when the armistice brought hostilities in Europe to a close. She entered the Portuguese island port with the convoy on 14 November. Eight days later, &quot;Waters&quot; headed west again and arrived at New York on 28 November.

=== Inter-war period ===
The destroyer remained there under repairs until mid-January 1919. On 15 January, she put to sea for another voyage to the Azores. &quot;Waters&quot; stayed in Ponta Delgada from her arrival on 21 January until 17 February when she headed back to the United States. She reached Boston on 25 February and moved to Philadelphia early in March for another series of repairs. On 3 April, she got underway for a brief run, via New York, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

The destroyer returned to New York on 14 March and remained there through the end of the month. On 1 May, she stood out of port, in company with , , , , , and , to take up station as part of the picket of destroyers dotting the path of the transatlantic flight to be conducted by Navy flying boats. After an overnight stop at Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, on 4 and 5 May, &quot;Waters&quot; dropped anchor off Santa Cruz in the Azores on 10 May.

On 17 May, she got underway at 0643 and arrived at her station, located between the islands of Corvo and Flores, at 0750. There, she lay to await the passage of the three seaplanes attempting the flight. Finally, at about 1112, her crew heard the drone of the engines of a single seaplane as NC-4, the only one of the three seaplanes to successfully complete the flight, passed overhead.

That afternoon, the warship left her station to search for NC-1 which had made a forced landing at sea. During the search, she received word that the third plane, NC-3, was also lost in the fog. Just after noon the following day, she received word that NC-1 had been found and its crew rescued by the Greek cargo ship . Accordingly, &quot;Waters&quot; returned to her anchorage off Santa Cruz that night.

Early the next morning, she weighed anchor to participate in the search for NC-3; however, she soon learned that NC-3 had been sighted off Ponta Delgada, navigating on the surface, and heading for that port under its own power. That same day, 19 May, the warship departed the Azores and shaped a course for Newport, Rhode Island, where she arrived on 23 May.

The destroyer operated out of Newport and New York until mid-July. She was among the destroyers which escorted the battleship out to sea on 8 July when Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels embarked in the battleship to meet , off New York harbor and to welcome President Woodrow Wilson as he returned home from the peace negotiations in Europe.

On 14 July, &quot;Waters&quot; sailed from New York, via Hampton Roads and the Panama Canal, to the west coast. She pulled into San Diego on 5 August and, after six weeks of operations which included a voyage to the Hawaiian Islands, was placed in reserve at San Diego on 21 September 1919.

==== 1920s ====
On 24 February 1920, &quot;Waters&quot; came out of reserve and moved to Bremerton, Washington, where she began a nine-month overhaul preparatory to her return to active service. While the destroyer was at Puget Sound, the Navy adopted the alphanumeric system of hull designations, and &quot;Waters&quot; became DD-115 on or about 17 July 1920. She completed her reconditioning on 30 November and returned to San Diego at the end of the first week in December.

During the first few months of 1921, she operated as a unit of Division X, a special organizational unit, to which and &quot;Dent&quot; were also attached, pending the reconstitution of Division 14 in its entirety. In January and February, she made a cruise to Central and South America. She stopped in the Panama Canal Zone on her way south and visited Valparaíso and Mejillones Bay in Chile during the first two weeks of February and then returned to Panama for nine days of battle practice with the Fleet. On 23 February, she headed home and, after visits to Costa Rica and El Salvador, reached San Diego on 11 March.

&quot;Waters&quot; remained there until 21 June when she got underway north and, following brief stops at San Pedro and Mare Island, entered Bremerton, Washington, on 27 June to prepare at the Puget Sound Navy Yard for duty in the Far East. Almost a month later, she returned south to San Francisco, whence she sailed for the Far East on 21 July. After stops at Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam, &quot;Waters&quot; steamed into Manila Bay on 24 August and reported for duty with the Asiatic Fleet at the Cavite Navy Yard.

The destroyer remained in the vicinity of Luzon through most of her tour of duty in the Orient. She visited Olongapo and Manila frequently and conducted combat training and torpedo exercises off the northwestern shores of the island in Lingayen Gulf. On 3 June 1922, she departed the Philippines and headed north for the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s usual summer cruise to Chinese waters. She arrived at Shanghai three days later and, for the remaining seven weeks of her tour in the Orient, visited Chinese ports such as Yantai and Qinhuangdao.

On 25 August, the warship weighed anchor at Yantai to return to the United States. She stopped at Nagasaki in Japan, Midway Island, and Pearl Harbor en route to San Francisco, where she finally arrived on 3 October. After a week of repairs at Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Waters&quot; steamed south and, upon her arrival at San Diego on 23 October, immediately began preparations for inactivation. On 28 December 1922, &quot;Waters&quot; was decommissioned there and was laid up at the destroyer base.

==== 1930s ====
On 4 June 1930, following more than seven years of inactivity, &quot;Waters&quot; was recommissioned at San Diego. After a month of refurbishing, she began operations along the west coast on 18 July and continued that routine for the next 18 months.

On 1 February 1932, she departed the west coast for the first time since her return from the Far East in 1922. She arrived in Lahaina Roads in the Hawaiian Islands on 12 February and took part in a landing exercise as a unit of the antisubmarine screen. The destroyer spent most of her time in Lahaina Roads but managed brief visits to Oahu and Hilo.

&quot;Waters&quot; returned to San Diego on 21 March and resumed normal operations until late January 1933. On 24 January, the warship arrived at Mare Island where she was placed in Rotating Reserve Squadron 20. She passed the next six months idly, moored to pierside at Mare Island with a severely reduced crew on board.

Early in July 1933, &quot;Waters&quot; returned to active service as a unit of Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 5, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 2, Battle Force Destroyers. She left Mare Island on 10 July, arrived at San Diego two days later, and resumed operations along the west coast. After more than eight months of such activity, the warship put to sea from San Diego on 9 April 1934 for an extended voyage to the Atlantic.

&quot;Waters&quot; reached Balboa, Canal Zone, on 22 April, transited the canal three days later, and was moored at Cristobal for a fortnight. On 5 May, she sailed for the gunnery range at Culebra Island near Puerto Rico. For the next three weeks, &quot;Waters&quot; participated in maneuvers in conjunction with Fleet Problem XV, a three-phased exercise which encompassed an attack upon and defense of the Panama Canal, the capture of advanced bases, and a major fleet engagement. On 25 May, the destroyer shaped a course north to Rhode Island. After a stop at New York City, she stood into Newport on 6 July and conducted tactical exercises out of Newport for two months.

On 7 September, she embarked upon a leisurely voyage back to San Diego. Along the way, she stopped at Hampton Roads, Tampa, Florida, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Consequently, the warship did not transit the canal until 25 October. She reached San Diego on 8 November and went back into the Rotating Reserve on 19 December.

The warship returned to active duty in May 1935, and resumed operations along the west coast as a unit of DesDiv 19. Late in April 1936, she steamed south to the Panama Canal where she again joined in the maneuvers associated with the annual fleet concentrations which were conducted on the Pacific side of the isthmus. She returned to San Diego at the end of the first week in June and conducted normal operations for a month before leaving the west coast on 6 July.

Her voyage to Hawaii came as a result of DesDiv 19&#x27;s assignment to the Submarine Force in conjunction with sonar tests. Sometime during the first half of the year, &quot;Waters&quot; and her sisters in the division had received the latest sound gear—high frequency directional sonar which allowed a destroyer to locate a submarine more accurately. Previously, sonar could at best indicate the presence of a submarine somewhere near the destroyer. The new equipment enabled submarine hunters to estimate the interloper&#x27;s bearing and distance and therefore increased the probability of success of the destroyer&#x27;s depth charge attacks. From July 1936 until late June 1939, &quot;Waters&quot; and her division mates cooperated with units of the Submarine Force in experiments to develop the techniques which translated the theoretical potential of the new technological developments into efficient antisubmarine warfare doctrine. &quot;Waters&quot; departed Hawaii for the west coast on 20 June 1939. She reached San Diego ten days later and was assigned to the Underwater Sound Training School. Between that time and America&#x27;s entry into World War II, the destroyer continued to develop the Navy&#x27;s antisubmarine warfare capability by teaching techniques which she had developed to sonar operators and officers assigned to the Fleet.

=== World War II ===
When the Japanese launched their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Waters&quot; was in port at San Diego and still operating with the Sound School. She received word of the hostilities at 11:25 and immediately began preparations to put to sea. That afternoon, the destroyer made a three-hour antisubmarine sweep of the approaches to San Diego. On 8 December, she departed San Diego in the screen of Hawaii-bound aircraft carrier . Six days later, the carrier and her screen, DesDiv 50, entered Pearl Harbor. During her ten days at Oahu, &quot;Waters&quot; periodically conducted patrols of the sea approaches to the harbor. Two days before Christmas, she got underway homeward with a task unit built around the cruisers , , and . She escorted the cruisers into San Francisco on 29 December and returned to San Diego on 30 December.

==== 1942 ====
After a month patrolling the California coast, &quot;Waters&quot; slipped her moorings at San Diego on 31 January 1942 and headed north for duty with the defense forces of the 13th Naval District. She arrived at Bremerton, Washington, on 5 February and, six days later, continued north to Alaska. For the next ten months, the destroyer escorted supply ships from Seattle, Washington, to and between the bases along the Alaskan coast and through the Aleutians chain. She was later assigned to the forces of the Northwestern Sea Frontier as a unit of Task Force 8, the Alaskan defense force. Her mission, however, remained the same as she plied the cold &quot;Waters&quot; of the northeastern Pacific between such ports as Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, Chernofski, Adak, and Sitka—returning periodically to Seattle.

The exigencies of the campaign for Guadalcanal— where neither side enjoyed the overwhelming local naval and air supremacy which insured victory in every other amphibious operation of the war—necessitated an increase in the number of high-speed transports. These hybrid warships combined the functions of transports and of destroyers into one. The concept of the high-speed transport embodied sufficient armament for the ship to defend herself against smaller warships and to support the troops she carried with sufficient speed to enable her to outrun more heavily armed ships. Overage flushdeck destroyers such as &quot;Waters&quot; were the first ships to be so converted to fill this role.

&quot;Waters&quot; entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 19 December 1942 to begin conversion and later that month was redesignated APD-8. During the modifications, her forward boilers were removed to make room for the troops she would carry while her torpedo tubes came off to accommodate landing craft and their davits. Though the ship retained her four-gun main battery configuration, she swapped her obsolete single-purpose guns for more up-to-date dual-purpose guns. Her antiaircraft defenses were further augmented by the addition of several single 20 mm mounts. She completed conversion in February and returned to San Diego on 10 February.

==== 1943 ====
On 17 February, &quot;Waters&quot; stood out of San Diego, bound for the South Pacific. After a five-day stop at Pearl Harbor, she resumed her voyage and reported for duty with the South Pacific Amphibious Force at Noumea, New Caledonia, on 21 March. Five days later, she got underway for Espiritu Santo where she arrived the following day. For the next three weeks, the high-speed transport conducted amphibious training at Espiritu Santo with units of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion. On 18 April, &quot;Waters&quot; headed for the Fiji Islands. She arrived at Suva two days later, embarked men and equipment of Carrier Air Group 11, and proceeded via Espiritu Santo to the Solomons. She arrived off Guadalcanal on 25 April, disembarked her passengers, unloaded cargo, and departed the same day.

During the next nine days, she made a circuitous voyage that took her first to Efate, thence to the Fijis, and from there back to Espiritu Santo where she arrived on 4 May. Eleven days later, the warship exited Segond Channel and set a course for Pago Pago in American Samoa where she stopped from 19 to 23 May. The next stop on her itinerary was Auckland, New Zealand, where she laid over from 29 May to 5 June while her crew enjoyed their last real shore leave for quite some time. &quot;Waters&quot; returned to Nouméa on 8 June and got underway the following day with a convoy bound for the southern Solomons. She and her charges arrived off Guadalcanal on 14 June, and the high-speed transport began patrolling the anchorage off Koli Point.

With her arrival in the Solomons, &quot;Waters&quot; began almost a year engaged in the type of operations for which ships of her type were ideally suited. The remnants of the Japanese defense forces had evacuated Guadalcanal over three months before, and the American Navy, Marine Corps, and Army possessed relatively secure bases—at that island and across Ironbottom Sound at Port Purvis on Florida Island—from which to begin the climb up the Solomons staircase toward the Bismarcks and Rabaul. Operating from Purvis Bay at Florida Island, &quot;Waters&quot; shuttled troops and supplies north to the invasions of various central and northern Solomon Islands—New Georgia, Vella Lavella, Bougainville, Treasury Island, and the Green Islands subgroup. After the move toward the Bismarcks began in earnest, she supported both initial invasions and consolidation operations.

New Georgia, the center island of a cluster which, with Vella Lavella, made up the southern branch of the Solomon Archipelago, constituted the second rung on the ladder to Rabaul. While &quot;Waters&quot; waited for the assault on that island, scheduled for the end of June, she patrolled the anchorages of Ironbottom Sound between Guadalcanal and Florida Island. On 16 June, she fought her first action when attacking Japanese planes dropped a stick of bombs close aboard. She returned the compliment more accurately than her adversaries, as her antiaircraft battery splashed two of the offending bombers.

Four days later, she received orders to move to Guadalcanal to embark five officers and 187 men of the 4th Marine Raider Battalion, part of a force hastily collected to occupy Segi Point on the southern coast of New Georgia. The Japanese were then moving in on a coastwatcher named Kennedy who held the plantation on the point, and Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner decided to advance the date of the opening of the Segi Point phase of the New Georgia operation in order to keep possession of the beachhead which for all intents and purposes was already established there and to protect Kennedy and his native guerrillas. &quot;Waters&quot; and &quot;Dent&quot; transited the Slot during the night of 20 and 21 June and, early the next morning, threaded their way through the uncharted shoal water between New Georgia and Vangunu to Segi Point. In less than two hours, the two former flushdeckers disembarked their passengers and stood out to sea again. After a daylight passage back down the Slot, &quot;Waters&quot; and her sister ship returned to Guadalcanal late that afternoon and thence moved to Port Purvis without incident.

On 25 June, &quot;Waters&quot; moved to Guadalcanal to embark more troops, this time the &quot;Barracudas&quot; scout troops of the Army&#x27;s 172nd Infantry. Until 29 June, she practiced amphibious landings at Purvis Bay; then headed north for the landings on Rendova, a small island south of New Georgia and directly opposite Munda, the main objective of the operation. The troops she carried were to have led the assault on Rendova and to have secured a beachhead for the main invasion force. However, heavy weather obscured the beacon fires which were to have guided them ashore, and the &quot;Barracudas&quot; landed some down the coast from their objective. By the time they reembarked and moved up the coast, the troops were able to land unopposed across a beachhead already established by units of the main invasion force. &quot;Waters&quot; completed disembarkation and unloading operations without further incident and, by 0855, stood down Blanche Channel in company with &quot;Dent&quot; to return to Purvis Bay, where she anchored that afternoon.

Rendova had been taken primarily as a stepping-stone to the main objective—Munda—as well as its airstrip— and to provide locations for supporting heavy artillery and its observation posts. By the time troops began shuttling from Rendova to Zanana—located to the east of Munda Point—for the planned occupation, &quot;Waters&quot; had picked up more troops at Guadalcanal and had landed them on the opposite coast of New Georgia. She departed Guadalcanal on 4 July and, the following morning, sent them ashore at Rice Anchorage on the northern coast of the island. The force she landed, a mixture of Marine Corps and Army units, succeeded in isolating and reducing the Japanese garrisons at Bairoko and on Enogai Inlet while the troops in the south concentrated upon the seizure of Munda without fear of interference from the north.

During the next ten days, she made two more runs to New Georgia carrying reinforcements and supplies to Rendova and returning to Guadalcanal with casualties. On the morning of 13 July, in the aftermath of the naval battles of Kula Gulf and Kolombangara, she escorted the cruisers and &quot;St. Louis&quot; into Purvis Bay. Two days later, she received orders to head for Vella Lavella—located northwest of New Georgia—to pick up survivors from &quot;Helena&quot; which had been sunk during the Battle of Kula Gulf. She embarked three war correspondents at Koli Point and cleared Guadalcanal at 1325 on 15 July. At 2258 that night, she hauled in sight of her destination and began searching for the &quot;Helena&quot; sailors. At 0159 on 16 July, she lowered her boats to enter Paraso Bay. Later, she moved to Lambu Lambu cove, where her boats picked up 40 survivors from the sunken cruiser. She completed rescue operations at 0450 and departed Vella Lavella for Guadalcanal. She disembarked the 40 survivors at Tulagi just after 1300 and anchored in Purvis Bay an hour later.

For the next month, &quot;Waters&quot; transported supplies, reinforcements, and garrison troops from Guadalcanal to Rendova and New Georgia and evacuated casualties in support of the mopping up of New Georgia and the capture of the remainder of the smaller islands of the group. During these operations, she served both as a transport and as escort for the slower and less well-armed landing ship tanks (LSTs) and landing craft infantry (LCIs) which were used so extensively for transportation throughout the campaigns in the southwestern Pacific.

In mid-August, while the troops she had ferried to New Georgia over the previous seven weeks continued to mop up that island and the smaller ones surrounding it, &quot;Waters&quot; trained her sights on a new objective. Though Kolombangara, the big round island just to the northwest of New Georgia, appeared to be the next step in the ascent to Rabaul, American commanders had become intrigued with the possibility of by-passing, or &quot;leapfrogging,&quot; its strong garrison and isolating it by occupying Vella Lavella, the next island above it on the southern arm of the Solomons chain.

Accordingly, &quot;Waters&quot; and six other fast transports loaded troops and equipment at Guadalcanal on 13 and 14 August. Two other transport groups, both composed of slower ships—LSTs and LCIs—departed ahead of her and her sisters who cleared Guadalcanal just before 1600 on 14 August. On the way up the Slot, the faster transports took over the lead from the tank landing ships and landing craft and arrived off Vella Lavella at 0529 the following morning. Since there was no organized Japanese garrison on the island, troops from &quot;Waters&quot; and the other fast transports established and consolidated their beachhead quickly. By 0730, she was steaming back down the Slot toward Guadalcanal and Purvis Bay. During the first hour of the passage, planes from the enemy air raids which halfheartedly contested the Vella Lavella landings attacked the transports. &quot;Waters&quot;″s antiaircraft battery engaged the attackers, but neither side scored. The remainder of the trip proved uneventful, and &quot;Waters&quot; dropped anchor in Purvis Bay at 2133 that night.

Over the next two months, &quot;Waters&quot; transported replacement troops, reinforcements, and supplies to New Georgia and Vella Lavella. On the return trips, she evacuated casualties and later, after both islands had been secured and garrison forces had moved in, began evacuating the combat-weary veterans of the campaign. These operations signaled the close of the central Solomons phase of the campaign to isolate Rabaul. Future operations centered upon Bougainville, the northernmost major island in the Solomons. In preparation for the invasion of that island, &quot;Waters&quot; participated in simulated amphibious landings at Kukum Beach on Guadalcanal on 26 October. Later that day, she embarked New Zealand troops and laid a course up the Slot to the Treasury Islands, a small pair located not far south of Bougainville and ideally suited as a staging base for small craft and PT boat patrols. The warship landed her portion of the Treasuries assault force expeditiously on 27 October and returned south to Purvis Bay the next day.

&quot;Waters&quot; remained at Purvis Bay for the remainder of October and into the first week of November. Consequently, she missed the 1 November landings on Bougainville at Cape Torokina. However, she moved to Guadalcanal on 4 November, loaded elements of the second echelon, and stood out toward Bougainville. She entered Empress Augusta Bay at 0609 on 6 November and disembarked her passengers by 0733. She then stood out of the bay and took up patrol position outside and helped to screen the entrance to the bay until the following day when she steamed back toward Purvis Bay.

For the following two weeks, &quot;Waters&quot; shuttled troops and equipment back and forth between Guadalcanal and Bougainville. All but the last of those trips were relatively peaceful affairs which began with troop embarkation at Guadalcanal, disembarkation at Empress Augusta Bay after passage up the Slot, and a return voyage with casualties bound for Guadalcanal. During the last voyage, however, enemy dive bombers attacked her convoy just as it arrived off Cape Torokina at 0755 on 17 November; the warship&#x27;s antiaircraft batteries quickly engaged the intruders and scored a kill on a Japanese Aichi D3A &quot;Val.&quot; During a lull in the attacks, &quot;Waters&quot; disembarked her troops, but another air raid at 0615 delayed the embarkation of wounded, and she did not complete the operation until 0845. She laid off Cape Torokina until 1819 when she formed up with a south-bound convoy and headed back to Guadalcanal. On 19 November, she disembarked the casualties at Kukum Beach and returned to Purvis Bay at about 1330.

After 11 days in port at Purvis Bay, &quot;Waters&quot; departed the Solomons for the first time since her arrival the previous June. On 1 December, she stood out of Purvis Bay for Nouméa, where she arrived on 3 December. Two days later, she weighed anchor again to escort Liberty ships and , as far as Lady Elliot Island and then continued independently to Australia. She reached Sydney on 10 December and began nine days of shore leave and repairs.

On the morning of 20 December, she sailed for New Caledonia. On 23 December, she received orders to rendezvous with the Liberty ship , and to escort that ship into Nouméa. The warship reached the rendezvous point on Christmas Eve Day and began a fruitless two-day search for &quot;Walter Colton&quot;. Early in the evening of 25 December, she gave up the search and entered Nouméa alone.

Four days later, &quot;Waters&quot; returned to sea and, on 30 December 1943, joined the screen of a Guadalcanal-bound convoy. En route back to the Solomons, &quot;Waters&quot; received orders detaching her from the convoy and instructions to rendezvous with and see that ship safely to Auckland, New Zealand. She made the rendezvous that same day, 5 January 1944, escorted her to her destination, and came about to return to Nouméa. &quot;Waters&quot; arrived in Nouméa on 9 January and, a week later, entered drydock for three days. On 20 January, the day after she left the dock, the fast transport headed back to the Solomons and, two days later, arrived in Purvis Bay.

==== 1944 ====
After a brief excursion as target ship for TF 38 on 24 and 25 January, she moved to Guadalcanal on 28 January and embarked a reconnaissance party for the initial raid on the Green Islands, a small pair north of Buka and Bougainville. She departed Guadalcanal the same day and headed up the Slot. En route, she stopped at Vella Lavella on 29 January to embark a further 112 troops, all members of the 30th Battalion, New Zealand Commando Force. That evening, the fast transport and the embarked raiders rehearsed the landing at Vella Lavella. The next morning, she started out on the last leg of the journey. The landing force reached the Green Islands around 2400 that night, and the commandos landed, unopposed, on Nissan, the larger of the two islands. At 0120 on 31 January, &quot;Waters&quot; received word that the landing had succeeded. Later that evening, she moved in toward the Nissan transport area to recover the reconnaissance party which had completed its mission. She completed reembarkation before dawn on 1 February and steamed back down the Slot. Later that day, she and Hudson parted company with the rest of the task group to return the New Zealanders to Vella Lavella. Afterward, she continued on toward Guadalcanal, where she arrived on 2 February.

After offloading her remaining passengers at Guadalcanal, &quot;Waters&quot; returned to Purvis Bay for an 11-day stay. On 13 and 14 February, the fast transport retraced her steps of two weeks before. On 13 February, she embarked troops at Guadalcanal and steamed northwest up the Slot. The following day, she stopped at Vella Lavella and took on additional troops, mostly members of the 207th Battalion, 3rd New Zealand Division, before continuing on to the Green Islands for the actual occupation. At 0625 on 15 February, the task force arrived off Nissan and began landing the occupation force. The minuscule enemy garrison did not oppose the landing and &quot;Waters&quot; completed her part of the mission and cleared the area by 0846. She returned to Florida Island on 16 February. Between 18 and 21 February, the warship made another round-trip voyage to the Green Islands to ferry a mixed bag of Navy, Army, and New Zealand forces before reentering Purvis Bay for the remainder of the month.

During the first half of March, she made two more voyages to the Green Islands—via Bougainville—before returning to Purvis Bay on 16 March to prepare for the occupation of Emirau Island. At 0630 on 17 March, she shifted from Florida Island to Guadalcanal, where she embarked units of the newly reconstituted 4th Marines. At 1800, she passed through Indispensable Strait with the Emirau invasion force and laid in a course to the northwest of the Solomons and New Ireland. At 0615, she arrived in the St. Matthias Islands and began disembarking troops for the invasion of Emirau, the southernmost island of the group. Once again, Waters&#x27; troops made their landing unopposed. The fast transport completed unloading by 1030 and took up station to patrol the transport area against enemy submarines. Finally, at 1930 that evening, she formed up with the other ships of the force and headed back to the southern Solomons. On the evening of 22 March, the force retransited Indispensable Strait and, the next morning, broke up off Savo Island to return to their various anchorages. &quot;Waters&quot; reentered Purvis Bay at 1130 and let go her anchor.

The fast transport remained in Purvis Bay for the remainder of March and the first week in April. On 8 April, she stood out of the anchorage, picked up passengers at Guadalcanal, and took departure for Pearl Harbor in company with . She made a brief stop at Funafuti, in the Ellice Islands, on 11 April and moored at the DE docks in Pearl Harbor on 18 April. The warship completed repairs by 1 May and began amphibious training at Kauai to prepare for the Marianas operation.

On 21 May, while &quot;Waters&quot; was in Pearl Harbor, an LST moored near her exploded. The resulting fire quickly spread to ships moored nearby. Though &quot;Waters&quot; was unable to get underway immediately and clear the area, her crew responded quickly by manning the fire-fighting equipment and wetting down the decks. Further explosions occurred during the afternoon, showering her with debris and injuring one of her crewmen, but the warship sustained relatively minor damage—a few sprung doors, cut cables, some sprung bulkheads, a bent yardarm brace, and a slightly damaged hull frame. Later, her crew responded to the emergency by launching the ship&#x27;s boats and rescuing 75 survivors from the oil and fire-covered &quot;Waters&quot; surrounding the stricken LSTs. The fires smoldered for two days after the incident, and fire-fighting parties were called away intermittently. However, &quot;Waters&quot; soon completed repairs of the damage caused on 21 May and resumed amphibious exercises in preparation for Operation Forager

On 28 May, &quot;Waters&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor for Kawaihae Bay, where she embarked marines the following day. That same day, she joined TF 51 and departed the Hawaiian Islands en route to Eniwetok Atoll, the staging point for the invasion of Saipan. She entered Eniwetok Lagoon at 0900 on 8 June and remained at anchor there for three days. On 11 June, TF 52—the Northern Attack Force—sortied from Eniwetok and headed for the Marianas. &quot;Waters&quot; served as flagship for both TransDiv 12 and TG 52.8, the Eastern Landing Group, administrative and operational organizations, respectively; the same six fast transports made up both organizations.

As she led her task group on the approach to Saipan late in the evening of 14 June, &quot;Waters&quot; made sonar contact with a submarine. She attacked with depth charges around 2200 and was unable to reestablish the contact after the barrage. Though the evidence did not support crediting her with a confirmed kill, her crew observed an oil slick which suggested that she had at least damaged an enemy submarine. She resumed her place in formation just before 2300 and continued to close Saipan, the northernmost of the Marianas islands.

At 0510, she went to general quarters in anticipation of the landing and moved into the transport area off the lower portion of Saipan&#x27;s western coast. She received orders to patrol to seaward of the transport area, and she led TransDiv 12 to that station at around 0715. The assault force hit the beaches at about 0845, but &quot;Waters&quot;″ complement of marines remained embarked throughout the day and the night of 15 and 16 June while she screened the transport area. She closed the transports once—at 1835—to help repel an air attack and, later, screened them during night retirement.

A little after 0800 on 16 June, &quot;Waters&quot; and the other APDs of TransDiv 12 closed the Charon Kanoa beaches and disembarked their troops—members of the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment—originally intended for a secondary landing on the eastern coast at Magicienne Bay but landed at the main beachhead because of unexpectedly stiff resistance ashore and an impending battle at sea. She completed debarking marines by 0858 and formed her division in column to take up screening station for the transports. The fast transport reached her assigned position at 1330 and relieved .

She remained off Saipan until late June, shepherding the transports of TF 51. During that time, she helped repel several air attacks but did not actually participate in the great air battle of the Philippine Sea fought on 19 and 20 June 1944. Before departing the Marianas on 2 July, the warship also made two unsuccessful attacks on enemy submarines and bombarded Japanese positions on Tinian.

On 2 July, the fast transport cleared the Marianas to escort TG 51.4 to Eniwetok. She reached her destination two days later and, after a 48-hour layover, exited the lagoon to return to the Marianas. &quot;Waters&quot; resumed patrols of the transport area off Saipan upon her arrival there on 12 July. That night, she delivered night illumination and harassment fire on Tinian near Tinian Town, probably to discourage any attempt by the Japanese on that island to reinforce their comrades in the Saipan garrison. She resumed antisubmarine patrols the next day, and on 14 July, she departed the Marianas once more—this time to escort and to Eniwetok. After reaching Eniwetok on 17 July, the warship spent the next 11 days undergoing repairs and then stood out of the lagoon on 28 July to screen another task unit on its voyage to Saipan. She arrived in the Marianas two days later, parted company with the task unit, and entered the anchorage off Guam, which American forces had invaded while the fast transport was at Eniwetok.

Following three days of screening transports in Agat Bay, she joined a task unit built around the battleships and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. &quot;Waters&quot; reached Eniwetok on 6 August, remained overnight, and then steamed out of the lagoon to escort &quot;Colorado&quot; to Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Waters&quot; arrived in Pearl Harbor on 12 August but departed again six days later. On 22 August, she entered San Francisco. After six weeks of repairs and modifications, the fast transport left San Francisco on 7 October to return to Hawaii. Upon arrival in Pearl Harbor on 14 October, she began additional repairs in preparation for training with underwater demolition teams (UDT) which she began at the end of October. She completed that training by the beginning of January 1945 and, on 10 January, departed Pearl Harbor with TG 52.11, built around the battleships and . The task group reached Ulithi Atoll on 23 January, and &quot;Waters&quot; remained until 10 February when she got underway to join in the assault on Iwo Jima. She arrived in the Marianas on 12 February, conducted rehearsals at Saipan and Tinian, and continued on to the Bonin-Volcano group two days later.

==== 1945 ====
She arrived off Iwo Jima on the morning of 16 February as part of the screen for the fire support group. During the three days before the actual invasion, &quot;Waters&quot; protected the bombardment battleships from enemy submarines and supported the UDTs in their preinvasion reconnaissance of Iwo Jima&#x27;s beaches. On the day of the assault, she joined the transports and screened them during the landings. The warship remained in the vicinity of Iwo Jima until the first week in March, supporting UDT operations and patrolling against Japanese submarines. On 5 March, the high-speed transport cleared the area with TransDiv 33 and a four-ship screen and headed for Guam. She remained at Guam for a day and a night, arriving there early on 8 March and departing again the next day. She entered Ulithi again on 11 March and began preparations for the last campaign of World War II—Operation Iceberg, the assault on Okinawa.

Following ten days in Ulithi lagoon, &quot;Waters&quot; steamed out of the atoll on 21 March and joined TG 54.2, part of Rear Admiral M. L. Deyo&#x27;s Gunfire and Covering Force, for the voyage to the Ryukyus. During the approach for the preinvasion bombardment on 26 March, &quot;Waters&quot; fired upon a &quot;Val&quot; which tried to crash into . Though she claimed no kill, &quot;Waters&quot;″ antiaircraft battery was probably instrumental in deflecting that &quot;kamikaze&quot;″s aim and causing him to miss his target by a mere . Over the four days before the landings, she screened the &quot;old&quot; battleships while they softened up Okinawa&#x27;s defenses and supported UDT reconnaissance missions and demonstrations along the Okinawa coastline. Late on the 31st, she joined Tractor Group &quot;Fox&quot; to cover its approach to the beaches on the following morning.

During the first week of the assault, she conducted patrols off those same beaches. On 6 April, she teamed up with to splash a &quot;Betty&quot;. Early that evening, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; crashed &quot;Morris&quot;, and &quot;Waters&quot; rushed to her assistance, helping to control the fires that blazed on board the destroyer for two hours. Two days later, &quot;Waters&quot; entered Kerama Retto for fuel and to await reassignment. The following day, she received orders to screen Mine Squadron (MinRon) 3 and, for the remainder of the month, supported minesweeping operations. On 3 May, she took up familiar duty protecting the transport area from submarines, but that assignment proved to be a brief one.

The following day, she joined the escort of a Ulithi-bound convoy. On 6 May, she and were diverted to Leyte Gulf, where they arrived on the 8th. There, they picked up a convoy of LSTs and shepherded them back to Okinawa, arriving on the 15th. After four days at Okinawa—punctuated by frequent Japanese air attacks, she departed once again in the escort of a convoy bound for Saipan. The fast transport reached her destination on 24 May, underwent repairs, and shifted to Guam on 5 June to unload her UDT equipment. From Guam, she moved to Ulithi for another week of repairs from 6 to 13 June. On 17 June, the warship returned to Okinawa with another convoy and, after two days at Kerama Retto, cleared the Ryukyus for the last time.

During this voyage, which ultimately took her home, she fired her last shot in anger on 24 June when she dropped a barrage of depth charges on an underwater sound contact. Following the attack, she lost contact and continued on her way. After stops at Saipan, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, the warship finally hauled into San Pedro, California, on 21 July. Soon after her arrival, she began an extensive at the Western Steel &amp; Pipe Company. On 2 August, she resumed her former classification as a destroyer and became DD-115 once again. The war ended on 14 August while she was still in the yard; and, in September, she was moved to Terminal Island, and the overhaul became preinactivation preparations. On 12 October 1945, the veteran of two world wars was decommissioned at Terminal Island. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 24 October 1945, and she was sold for scrapping on 10 May 1946.

&quot;Waters&quot; received seven battle stars for service during World War II.

<text>Oscar Deutsch (12 August 1893 – 5 December 1941) was a British entrepreneur who was the founder of Odeon Cinemas, the largest cinema chain in the United Kingdom. He opened his first cinema in Brierley Hill, Staffordshire in 1928, with the chain&#x27;s flagship cinema, the Odeon, Leicester Square in London, opening in 1937.

==Life and career==
Deutsch was born in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, Warwickshire, the son of Leopold Deutsch, a successful Hungarian Jewish scrap metal merchant. After attending King Edward VI Five Ways Grammar School, he started work at his father&#x27;s metal firm in Birmingham. In 1918, he married and went on to have three sons. In 1925, he rented cinemas in Wolverhampton and Coventry and started exhibiting subsequent runs of films. He opened his first cinema in nearby Brierley Hill, Dudley in 1928. By 1933 he had 26 Odeons and &quot;Odeon&quot; had started to become a household word, used interchangeably with &quot;cinema&quot; in some parts of the UK until after the Second World War.

By 1937 there were 250 Odeons, including the flagship cinema in Leicester Square, London, making Odeon one of the three major circuits in the UK. Odeon cinemas were considered more comfortable and respectable for middle-class filmgoers than those of the two other circuits, Associated British Cinemas (ABC) and Gaumont-British Cinemas. Odeons were known for their art deco architecture, first used on the Odeon, Kingstanding to a design by Cecil Clavering, working for Harry Weedon. Although Clavering only designed three further Odeons, at Sutton Coldfield, Colwyn Bay and Scarborough, &quot;one masterpiece after the other&quot; considered &quot;the finest expressions of the Odeon circuit style&quot;. Later in 1935, however, Clavering stunned Weedon by resigning to take up a job with the Office of Works. Weedon approached Clavering&#x27;s former tutor who recommended Robert Bullivant as Clavering&#x27;s replacement and Weedon was commissioned by Deutsch to oversee the design of the entire chain.

Deutsch became a director of the UK arm of United Artists, who had acquired a 50% stake in Odeon Cinema Holdings.

He was from 1932 to 1940 President of Birmingham&#x27;s main Synagogue, Singers Hill. In 1939, the Synagogue was extended by Harry Weedon.

In 1941, a bomb landed on his home and he was blown out of bed and never recovered. After Deutsch died of cancer in 1941, his widow sold the Odeon chain to J. Arthur Rank and it became part of the Rank Organisation, who also bought, but managed separately, Gaumont-British Cinemas.

==Origin of &quot;Odeon&quot;==
The original Odeons were the popular amphitheatres of ancient Greece. The name Odeon had been appropriated by cinemas in France and Italy in the 1920s, but Deutsch made it his own in the UK. His publicity team claimed Odeon stood for &quot;Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our Nation&quot;.

<doc id="1053694" wikidata="Q162093" url="?curid=1053694" title="Lathyrus sativus">
<text>Lathyrus sativus, also known as grass pea, cicerchia, blue sweet pea, chickling pea, chickling vetch, Indian pea, white pea and white vetch, is a legume (family Fabaceae) commonly grown for human consumption and livestock feed in Asia and East Africa. It is a particularly important crop in areas that are prone to drought and famine, and is thought of as an &#x27;insurance crop&#x27; as it produces reliable yields when all other crops fail. The seeds contain a neurotoxin that causes lathyrism, a neurodegenerative disease, if eaten as a primary protein source for a prolonged period.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Lathyrus sativus&quot; grows best where the average temperature is 10–25 °C and average rainfall is per year. Like other legumes, it improves the nitrogen content of soil. The crop can survive drought or floods, but grows best in moist soils. It tolerates a range of soil types from light sandy through loamy to heavy clay, and acid, neutral, or alkaline soils. It does not tolerate shade.

Slow Food inducted Serra de&#x27;Conti Cicerchia, a cicerchia grown in Serra de’ Conti Municipality, Ancona Province, Marche region of Italy into the Ark of Taste.

==Uses==

Seed is sold for human consumption at markets in Florence. Consumption of this pulse in Italy is limited to some areas in the central part of the country, and is steadily declining.

Flour made from grass peas (Spanish: &quot;almorta&quot;) is the main ingredient for the &quot;gachas manchegas&quot; or &quot;gachas de almorta&quot;. Accompaniments for the dish vary throughout La Mancha. This is an ancient Manchego cuisine staple, generally consumed during the cold winter months. The dish is generally eaten directly out of the pan in which it was cooked, using either a spoon or a simple slice of bread. This dish is commonly consumed immediately after removing it from the fire, being careful not to burn one&#x27;s lips or tongue.

Due to its toxicity, it was forbidden for human consumption in Spain from 1967 to 2018. However, it was widely sold as animal feed, but displayed together with flours for human consumption.

The town of Alvaiázere in Portugal dedicates a festival lasting several days to dishes featuring the pulse. Alvaiázere calls itself the &quot;Chícharo&quot; capital, the name of this pulse in Portuguese.

Immature seeds can be eaten like green peas. Mature seeds need soaking and thorough cooking to reduce toxins.

The leaves and stem are cooked and eaten as &quot;chana saga&quot; (Odia: ଚଣା ଶାଗ) in parts of Odisha, India.

==Neurotoxic properties==

Like other grain legumes, &quot;L. sativus&quot; produces a high-protein seed. The seeds however also contain variable amounts of a neurotoxic amino acid β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic acid (ODAP). ODAP is considered the cause of the disease neurolathyrism, a neurodegenerative disease that causes paralysis of the lower body: emaciation of gluteal muscle (buttocks). The disease has historically occurred after famines in Europe (France, Spain, Germany), North Africa, and South Asia, and is still prevalent in Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Afghanistan (panhandle) when &quot;Lathyrus&quot; seed is the exclusive or main source of nutrients for extended periods. ODAP concentration increases in plants grown under stressful conditions, compounding the problem.
Some authors have argued that this toxicity is overstated, and &quot;L. sativus&quot; is harmless as part of a normal diet.

Goya in his 1810-1815 &quot;The Disasters of War&quot; series illustrates the harm that can be done by excessive consumption of grass peas in times of famine in his print &quot;Gracias á la almorta&quot; (&quot;Thanks to the grass pea&quot;), about Napoleon&#x27;s siege of Madrid. It depicts a woman who can no longer walk due to lathyrism, surrounded by starving people waiting for bowls of grass pea-based food. Grass-pea products were banned for sale for human consumption in Spain from 1967 to 2018, due to toxicity.

This legume is the only known dietary source for -homoarginine and is preferred over arginine for nitric oxide (NO) generation. L-ODAP is reported to act as an activator of calcium-dependent protein kinase C.

==Breeding programs==

Breeding programs are underway to produce lines of &quot;Lathyrus sativus&quot; that contain ODAP levels too low to be dangerous, while maintaining disease and insect resistance and tolerance to drought, heat, and salinity.
Wild relatives are a prominent source of genetic material to improve cultivars. From 2016 to 2018, the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) evaluated wild relatives to explore genes for low or no ODAP and resistance/tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses and transfer them to cultivated grass pea.

<doc id="1053696" wikidata="Q6211786" url="?curid=1053696" title="Joe Peschisolido">
<text>Joe Peschisolido (born April 27, 1963) is a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Richmond from 2000 to 2004 and as the MP for Steveston—Richmond East from 2015 to 2019. He was first elected as a member of the Canadian Alliance, but crossed the floor to the Liberal Party in 2002.

==Background==
Peschisolido has a Bachelor of Arts (honours) degree in political science from Trinity College at the University of Toronto and a law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School. Peschisolido is a fourth degree knight of the Knights of Columbus in Richmond, a member of the Rotary Club of Richmond Sunset and a member of the Richmond Chamber of Commerce. He is an active parishioner of Canadian Martyrs Catholic Church and is a vegan, who believes in making healthy and sustainable food choices.

==Political career==
For decades, Peschisolido was a member of the Liberal Party, where he had worked as a youth co-ordinator for Jean Chrétien&#x27;s 1990 leadership campaign. In 1993, he joined the Reform Party of Canada (later the Canadian Alliance), running as their candidate in Etobicoke North in the 1993 general election and a subsequent 1996 by-election. He placed second both times.

===First term (2000 to 2004)===
Peschisolido relocated to British Columbia, where he was elected as Member of Parliament for Richmond in the 2000 general election, defeating Liberal incumbent, Raymond Chan.

In 2002, Peschisolido left the Canadian Alliance and crossed the floor to the Liberal Party without consulting with his constituents. This was due to the &quot;process of political realignment&quot; which eliminated both the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party, and instead creating the Conservative Party of Canada.

While serving in office, Peschisolido fought to protect the rights of taxpayers by introducing the &quot;Taxpayers&#x27; Bill of Rights&quot; in the 37th Parliament&#x27;s first, second, and third sessions.

In 2002, Peschisolido helped broker the original Garden City land deal, which saw the transfer of said lands from the Canadian federal government to the City of Richmond. This deal would have seen the City of Richmond receive 75 to 80 percent of the land, with the rest of the property set aside for a trade and exhibition center, as well as commercial development.

In 2003, he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. He was also Vice-Chair for the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities.

Peschisolido lost the Liberal nomination to his predecessor as Member of Parliament, Raymond Chan, who went on to retain the riding for the Liberals in the 2004 election.

===2011 election===

In 2011, Peschisolido won the Liberal nomination over Raymond Chan for Member of Parliament for Richmond in the 2011 Canadian federal election. In the general election, Peschisolido was defeated by Alice Wong by more than 17,000 votes.

===Second term (2015 to 2019)===

On August 11, 2015, Peschisolido again won the Liberal nomination for Member of Parliament in the new riding of Steveston—Richmond East for the 2015 Canadian federal election.

On October 19, 2015, as a Liberal majority government was formed, Peschisolido was returned to Parliament.

In July 2019, Global News reported the Royal Canadian Mounted Police opened an investigation into Peschisolido &quot;after confidential police informants alleged the veteran politician had been knowingly associating with Chinese organized crime figures through his former real estate law practice in Richmond, B.C.&quot; Peschisolido&#x27;s law firm allegedly received money via illicit channels from China as part of an attempt by the firm&#x27;s clients to circumvent the legal immigration process. No charges have been laid against Peschisolido or lawyers at his firm. Peschisolido turned in his law license in 2018.

On February 5, 2020 the Ethics Commissioner of Canada released an investigative report on Peschisolido. The Commissioner found Peschisolido contravened subsections 21(3) and 20(1) of the &quot;Conflict of Interest Code for Members of the House of Commons&quot; for failing to file a statement of material change and by failing to file a full statement of the private interests.

Peschisolido was defeated by Kenny Chiu in the 2019 Canadian federal election, and Parliament could not apply sanctions since Peschisolido was no longer a sitting MP.

<text>Stefano W. Pasquini is an Italian contemporary artist, writer and curator living in Italy. He works with paintings, performance, photography and installation. He also publishes a magazine called Obsolete Shit.

He currently works with the Italian galleries L&#x27;Arte, Molinella, Quattrocentometriquadri, Ancona, and MelePere Verona.
Since 2010 he has been known as Stefano W. Pasquini.

His style has been defined &quot;horizontal&quot;, as it&#x27;s hard to define practicing in so many different styles. To quote Fabio Cavallucci: &quot;Pasquini doesn’t worry about changing styles and contents: he goes from interactive performances – like when, for example, he dressed like Spider-Man, sitting on the floor of the streets of London – to the hard rock videos – like the one he’s in the woods stuck with his hands and feet onto the ground, shouting like a maniac. He’s also not afraid to return to paintings, portraying, with a fast and synthetic stroke, himself or people from the mass media zoo. Or eschews the indifference in order to approach politics, making works that range from portraying the statesman Aldo Moro in sculpture, as he was found (dead) in the trunk of a Renault in via Caetani, to a performance where a series of people raise on pedestals and wave their hands in the fascist salute.&quot;

==Life==
Pasquini was born in Bologna, Italy. He received his MFA from the Academy of Fine Arts of Bologna in 1991, then immediately left his country for Dublin, briefly, then London for seven years, and New York, where he participated to many exhibitions. He is currently based in Bologna, where he works. He was head curator of Sesto Senso, a small non-profit gallery in Bologna, for the exhibiting seasons of 2001–2002. He was Art Director of &quot;Work – Art in progress&quot;, magazine of the Contemporary Art Gallery of Trento, as well as contributing editor of NYArts Magazine.
In 2014 he directed the non-profit art space Studio Cloud 4 curating many exhibitions until 2016. Since 2013 he teaches Tecniche Grafiche Speciali at the Albertina Academy of Fine Arts of Turin.

==Exhibitions==
Since 1988 Pasquini exhibited in group shows in venues such as the Collective Gallery (Edinburgh), The National Portrait Gallery (London), Casco (Utrecht), ICA (London), Art in General (New York), Star67 (Brooklyn), Gallery Korea (New York), MACRO (Rome), Galleria Enrico Astuni (Bologna).
His first solo exhibition was at Carnera (Adria), in 1994, followed by a show titled &quot;Hope and Despair&quot; at the Bond Gallery in (Birmingham) in 1998. 
Further solo exhibitions include Sesto Senso, Graffio, Villa Serena (Bologna), Studio Vetusta, Paggeriarte (Modena), MelePere (Verona), Quattrocentometriquadri (Ancona). 
In 2004 he made a project about quantity that resulted in a solo exhibition, titled &quot;2004&quot; at Galleria 42 Contemporaneo, in Modena.
In 2012 he had a solo exhibition at Siz, in Rijeka, Croatia, and in 2013 he participated to a three part exhibition curated by Kaz in London at Kingsgate Gallery.
In 2014 he finished a public project started in 2011 in Pfyn, Switzerland, that involved the local population of the small town, a time capsule and a big wooden sculpture.

==Writings==
Since 1994 Pasquini has been writing about contemporary art in many magazines: La Stanza Rossa (Bologna, Italy), New York Arts (New York), Collezioni Sport &amp; Street (Modena, Italy).
He is author with Frank Verpoorten of &quot;Accidental//Coincidental&quot;, Newhouse Center for the Arts, New York, 2008.
In 2004 he published a volume on photographer Claudio Serrapica.
In 2015 he co-authored (with Maria Teresa Roberto) &quot;Incorporeo&quot;, published by Albertina Press.

<text>Art in General was a non-profit contemporary art exhibition space known for its vibrant and ground-breaking projects as a formidable and longstanding New York City alternative space, focused on giving meaningful resources and opportunities to artists early on in their careers. Founded in 1981 by artists Martin Weinstein and Teresa Liszka and originally located in the General Hardware building in New York City — hence the organization&#x27;s name, Art in General — the institution produced and presented distinctive programs and exhibitions featuring new work by local and international artists.

Since its first exhibition in 1982, Art in General provided spaces for artists to display unconventional work and exchange ideas with their peers for almost 40 years, making it one of the longest-standing artist-founded non-profit artist organizations in New York City. Art in General organized exhibitions; commissions new art projects; hosted national and international artist residency programs; and facilitated regular free public programs with renowned artists, critics and curators. More than 2,000 artists exhibited their work at Art in General in a wide range of disciplines—painting, sculpture, drawing, photography, installation art, audio, video art, performance art and new media art.

==Programs==

The New Commissions Program, Art in General’s central focus, flourished since its launch in 2005. The program was created in response to artists’ need for support to create major new projects that would significantly advance their practice. Art in General commissioned new works, either through an open call, or through direct invitation. Art in General provided commissioned artists with both space and a budget for developing their project, as well as an honorarium. Initially designed for New York based artists, in 2012 this program expanded to include projects by international artists.

Art in General established the Eastern European Residency Exchange (EERE) in 2001, with the goal of supporting critical dialogue, the presentation of new work, and a greater understanding of diverse cultures. This program took the form of a two-way artist residency until 2013, when it expanded to encompass institutional co-commissioning and other forms of exchange. Art in General’s partner institutions have included: &quot;&#x27;kim?&#x27; Contemporary Art Centre&quot; in Riga, Latvia; &quot;The Gardens&quot; in Vilnius, Lithuania; Pavilion Unicredit in Bucharest, Romania; Croatian Association of Artists (HDLU) in Zagreb, Croatia; &quot;The Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art&quot; in Rijeka, Croatia; &quot;Centre for Contemporary Arts FUTURA&quot; in Prague, Czech Republic; &quot;The Trafó House of Contemporary Arts&quot; in Budapest, Hungary; &quot;Center For Contemporary Arts Estonia&quot; in Tallinn; &quot;Bunkier Sztuki Gallery&quot; in Kraków, Poland; &quot;Swimming Pool&quot; in Sofia, Bulgaria; and &quot;The Centre for Contemporary Art&quot; in Warsaw, Poland.

Art in General regularly organized other discursive programs and exhibitions. When Art in General was located in Manhattan, its Audio in the Elevator program began in 1990 in response to the slow-moving elevator that takes 38 seconds to reach the 6th floor gallery from street level. Art in General saw this unfavorable circumstance as an opportunity to create a new exhibition space in the elevator, where one to five audio or video art projects were displayed each year. In 2018 Rational Dress Society, a counter-fashion collective, were commissioned to create official Art in General uniforms that all members of its staff wore in contemplation of &quot;what cultural work should look like in difficult political times&quot;.

==Artists==

Art in General had a long history of supporting artists early in their careers. Since 1981, Art in General is proud to have supported and shown over 2,000 emerging and mid-career artists and collectives who have gone onto greater success, including Dorothea Rockburne, Joan Jonas, Kay WalkingStick, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Glenn Ligon, Byron Kim, Elizabeth Peyton, Marina Abramović, Gabriel Orozco, Paul Pfeiffer, William Pope.L, Pipilotti Rist, Francis Alÿs, Walid Raad, Sharon Hayes, Patty Chang, Allora &amp; Calzadilla, Pierre Huyghe, Andrea Geyer, Xaviera Simmons, Lisi Raskin, Kambui Olujimi, Carlos Motta, Jill Magid, Marwa Arsanios, Adelita Husni-Bey, Dineo Seshee Bopape, Fatma Bucak, Postcommodity, Duane Linklater, Chim↑Pom, Sondra Perry, Anna Daučíková, Aliza Shvarts, Zach Blas, among many others. Its roster of artists reflected its deep and long-standing commitment to diversity and equity in the arts. Art in General was often at the forefront of giving artists their first New York exhibitions.

==Curators==

The institution had also been a crucial one for giving diverse curators a chance to curate risk-taking exhibitions early in their careers. Not unlike the artists it supports, many who curated exhibitions for Art in General as staff members or as guest curators later went on to notable acclaim for their impactful and highly original curatorial work, writing on contemporary artists, and leading of important arts institutions such as Holly Block, Anne Barlow, Sofía Hernández Chong Cuy, Dean Daderko, Eva Diaz, Andria Hickey, Ruba Katrib, Laura Hoptman, Laurel Ptak, Irene Mei Zhi Shum, Franklin Sirmans, Hazma Walker, and others.

==Leadership==

Art in General had a long history of supporting women in leadership roles. From 1981 to 1988, Art in General was led by its founders, artists Martin Weinstein and Teresa Liszka. After Weinstein and Liszka stepped aside from actively overseeing day-to-day operations, Holly Block was appointed the inaugural Executive Director. Subsequently, Art in General proudly established itself as a woman-led organization.

Executive Directors:
Holly Block (1988–2006); Anne Barlow (2007–2016); Laurel Ptak (2017–2020); Irene Mei Zhi Shum (2020).

==Facilities==

From 1981 to 2015, Art in General was located at 79 Walker Street in Manhattan, in a six-floor building owned by General Hardware Manufacturing Inc. (now General Tools &amp; Instruments LLC), hence the organization’s name. Located at the intersection of three neighborhoods in New York City (Tribeca, SoHo, and Chinatown), Art in General had since its founding been committed to presenting new work by artists of color, women, immigrants and visiting artists. In 2003, Gerry Weinstein, CEO of General Tools &amp; Instruments LLC, donated the storefront to Art in General for use as a gallery. In 2006, the sixth-floor gallery underwent a major renovation by Steven Learner Studios and was re-opened in January 2007 with Le Musée Minuscule, created in honor of New Langton Arts’ former space of the same name. In 2014, General Tools was acquired by High Road Capital Partners, a private equity group. When the business was sold and the building changed ownership, Art in General lost its primary patron, that provided corporate donations as well as rent-free office and exhibition space. Then Director Anne Barlow and board president Robert Ferguson moved its office to 20 Jay Street and its gallery to 145 Plymouth Street in DUMBO, Brooklyn in January 2016. Although the office and gallery had different mailing addresses, they were in fact located in the same building, owned by Two Trees Management. In August 2020 then Director Irene Mei Zhi Shum announced that Art in General would be partnering with Mana Contemporary and relocating the office to Mana&#x27;s facility in Jersey City, New Jersey, stating in a press release, &quot;This new partnership allows Art in General to organize programs and exhibitions across Mana Contemporary’s real estate portfolio, which includes buildings in Jersey City, New Jersey; Chicago, Illinois; and Miami, Florida. It also provides studio space for visiting artists and curators for Art in General&#x27;s residency programs. This opportunity was made possible by the generous support of Eugene Lemay, founder of Mana Contemporary.&quot; However in October 2020 Art in General was shuttered deeply saddening the arts community. The closure was the direct result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement, Board President Leslie Ruff and Executive Director Irene Mei Zhi Shum cited the pressures of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. “Although we have taken critical measures to adjust to the new normal, the financial constriction due to COVID-19 has proved formidable, severely affecting our ability to fulfill our mission.” They continued, “In this difficult time for us all, we offer our sincere thanks to you — our alumni artists, guest curators, visitors, former staff and donors — for your passion and dedication, interest and support during the last forty years.”

== Legacy ==
The Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, acquired the archive of Art in General. The Art in General archive comprehensively chronicles the decades of exhibitions and programs and long-standing commitment to diversity and equity in the arts. The more than one hundred linear feet of materials donated to the Archives of American Art include Holly Block’s files, documenting her 18-year tenure as Art in General’s forward-thinking first director.

“It is a tremendous honor to preserve the legacy of one of New York’s most important non-profit institutions,” said Liza Kirwin, interim director, Archives of American Art. “The Archives is proud to be stewards of Art in General’s historic records, ensuring that they are preserved and available to the public and future generations.”

<text>Hockley is a large village and civil parish in Essex in the East of England located between Chelmsford and Southend-on-Sea, or, more specifically, between Rayleigh and Rochford. It came to prominence during the coming of the railway in the 1890s and at the 2001 census had a population of 13,616 people, reducing to 9,616 at the 2011 Census. The parish of Hockley itself had a population of 8,909 at the (2001 census), while the urban area runs into the neighbouring parish of Hawkwell. Hockley railway station serves the village.

== History ==
The place-name &#x27;Hockley&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Hocheleia&quot;. The name means &quot;Hocca&#x27;s woodland clearing or glade&quot;. Today, there is still a large wooded area named Hockley Woods. Notable buildings in the village include the church of St Peter and Paul, which has a nave which was possibly built before the twelfth century, a thirteenth-century chancel and a fourteenth-century tower, the upper half of which is octagonal and was built at a later date. The tower holds three bells, manufactured by Miles Gray in 1626, by James Bartlett in 1684 and by John Hodgson in 1657, and the building is Grade II* listed. The church is situated to the north-west of the village centre, where Grade II listed Spa Pump Room is situated. The building was built as a spa to a design by James Lockyer in 1842, after Robert Clay found a medicinal spring there in 1838. Hockley is also the site of the former Bullwood Hall prison which closed in 2013.

Plumberow Mount, a Roman burial mound, was excavated in 1913 by Mr. E. B. Francis. At the time, there was a summer house on the top of the mound, and so trenches were cut on three sides. The excavation found a Roman coin of Domitian and some Saxon pottery which may indicate a secondary burial. The oval mound is high, and in diameter, with a flattened top, where the summerhouse was located. Since 2005, a metal fence has surrounded the mound to protect it from erosion, and a number of trees which were growing on or near it were cut down at the same time.

In 2009, the sixteenth-century Hockley Pendant was discovered in a field at Hockley.

== Governance ==
Hockley has a parish council consisting of two wards (West Ward and East Ward) and is part of Rochford District Council

<doc id="1053706" wikidata="Q365129" url="?curid=1053706" title="Arthur Danto">
<text>Arthur Coleman Danto (January 1, 1924 – October 25, 2013) was an American art critic, philosopher, and professor at Columbia University. He was best known for having been a long-time art critic for &quot;The Nation&quot; and for his work in philosophical aesthetics and philosophy of history, though he contributed significantly to a number of fields, including the philosophy of action. His interests included thought, feeling, philosophy of art, theories of representation, philosophical psychology, Hegel&#x27;s aesthetics, and the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre.

==Life and career==
Danto was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 1, 1924, and grew up in Detroit. He was raised in a Reform Jewish home. After spending two years in the Army, Danto studied art and history at Wayne University (now Wayne State University). While an undergraduate he intended to become an artist, and began making prints in the Expressionist style in 1947 (these are now great rarities). He then pursued graduate study in philosophy at Columbia University. From 1949 to 1950, Danto studied in Paris on a Fulbright scholarship under Jean Wahl, and in 1951 returned to teach at Columbia.

Upon retirement in 1992 he was named Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy. He was twice awarded fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, elected in 1980. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Danto died on October 25, 2013, aged 89 in Manhattan, New York City.

==Philosophical work==
Arthur Danto argued that &quot;a problem is not a philosophical problem unless it is possible to imagine that its solution will consist in showing how appearance has been taken for reality.&quot; While science deals with empirical problems, philosophy according to Danto examines indiscernible differences that lie outside of experience. Noel Carroll, writing as an art critic, has criticized Danto&#x27;s anthropology stating that Danto &quot;believe[d] that persons are essentially systems of representation.&quot;

===&quot;Artworld&quot; and the definition of art===
Danto laid the groundwork for an institutional definition of art that sought to answer the questions raised by the emerging phenomenon of twentieth-century art. The definition of the term &quot;art&quot; is a subject of constant contention and many books and journal articles have been published arguing over the answer to the question &quot;What is Art?&quot; In terms of classificatory disputes about art, Danto takes a conventional approach. Non-conventional definitions take a concept like the aesthetic as an intrinsic characteristic in order to account for the phenomena of art. Conventional definitions reject this connection to aesthetic, formal, or expressive properties as essential to defining art but rather, in either an institutional or historical sense, say that &quot;art&quot; is basically a sociological category. Danto&#x27;s &quot;institutional definition of art&quot; defines art as whatever art schools, museums, and artists consider art, regardless of further formal definition. Danto wrote on this subject in several of his works and a detailed treatment is to be found in &quot;Transfiguration of the Commonplace&quot;.

Danto stated, &quot;A work of art is a meaning given embodiment.&quot; Danto further stated, also in &quot;Veery&quot; journal, &quot;Criticism, other than of content, is really of the mode of embodiment.&quot;

The 1964 essay &quot;The Artworld&quot; in which Danto coined the term &quot;artworld&quot; (as opposed to the existing &quot;art world&quot;, though they mean the same), by which he meant cultural context or &quot;an atmosphere of art theory&quot;, first appeared in &quot;The Journal of Philosophy&quot; and has since been widely reprinted. It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, &quot;especially upon George Dickie&#x27;s institutional theory of art. Dickie defined an art work as an artifact &#x27;which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)&#x27; (p. 43.)&quot;

According to the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, &quot;Danto&#x27;s definition has been glossed as follows: something is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii) about which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style) (iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) which ellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing, and (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereof require an art historical context (Danto with Noël Carroll). Clause (iv) is what makes the definition institutionalist. The view has been criticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highly rhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent account of what makes a context art historical, and for not applying to music.&quot;

After about 2005, Danto attempted to streamline his definition of art down to two principles: (i) art must have content or meaning and (ii) the art must embody that meaning in some appropriate manner.

===The philosophical disenfranchisement of art===
Danto&#x27;s Hegelian position on the history of art and its reception was emphasized in his 1984 plenary address to the World Congress of Aesthetics held in Montreal in that year, and later published as the opening chapter in his book &quot;The Philosophical Disenfranchisement of Art&quot;. In the essay, Danto takes a contrary position to that of Plato who emphasized that art and artistic endeavors occupied an inferior position of importance among the endeavors of philosophers. Danto summarizes this ancient position of the Socratics with the phrase that &quot;art is dangerous&quot; on page four of the essay, which he then criticizes in the remainder of the essay.

===The Hegelian end of art===
The basic meaning of the term &quot;art&quot; has changed several times over the centuries and continued to evolve during the 20th century as well. Danto describes the history of Art in his own contemporary version of Hegel&#x27;s dialectical history of art. &quot;Danto is not claiming that no-one is making art anymore; nor is he claiming that no good art is being made any more. But he thinks that a certain history of western art has come to an end, in about the way that Hegel suggested it would.&quot; The &quot;end of art&quot; refers to the beginning of our modern era of art in which art no longer adheres to the constraints of imitation theory but serves a new purpose. Art began with an &quot;era of imitation, followed by an era of ideology, followed by our post-historical era in which, with qualification, anything goes... In our narrative, at first only mimesis [imitation] was art, then several things were art but each tried to extinguish its competitors, and then, finally, it became apparent that there were no stylistic or philosophical constraints. There is no special way works of art have to be. And that is the present and, I should say, the final moment in the master narrative. It is the end of the story.&quot;

==Art criticism==
Arthur Danto was an art critic for &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1984 to 2009, and also published numerous articles in other journals. In addition, he was an editor of &quot;The Journal of Philosophy&quot; and a contributing editor of the &quot;Naked Punch Review&quot; and &quot;Artforum&quot;. In art criticism, he published several collected essays, including &quot;Encounters and Reflections: Art in the Historical Present&quot; (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1990), which won the National Book Critics Circle Prize for Criticism in 1990; &quot;Beyond the Brillo Box: The Visual Arts in Post-Historical Perspective&quot; (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1992); &quot;Playing With the Edge: The Photographic Achievement of Robert Mapplethorpe&quot; (University of California, 1995); &quot;The Madonna of the Future: Essays in a Pluralistic Art World&quot; (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2000); and &quot;Unnatural Wonders: Essays from the Gap Between Art and Life&quot; (Columbia University Press, 2007).

In 1996, he received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for art criticism from the College Art Association. Danto artist friend Sean Scully, to honor his long-term friendship with Danto, published the book &quot;Danto on Scully,&quot; bringing together the series of five essays Danto had written on the artist over the previous 20 years after Danto&#x27;s death in 2013.

<doc id="1053707" wikidata="Q1514649" url="?curid=1053707" title="NKVD troika">
<text>NKVD troika or Special troika (), in Soviet history, were the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (NKVD which would later be the beginning of the KGB) made up of three officials who issued sentences to people after simplified, speedy investigations and without a public trial. The three members acted as &quot;ad hoc&quot; judges. These commissions were employed as instruments of extrajudicial punishment introduced to supplement the Soviet legal system with a means for quick and secret execution or imprisonment. It began as an institution of the Cheka, then later became prominent again in the NKVD, when it was used during the Great Purge to execute many hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens. Defendants in the Troika&#x27;s proceeding were typically not entitled to legal aid or the presumption of innocence. Convictions usually did not include information about the actual incriminating evidence and basically contained only information about indictment and sentencing. The outcome of such trials was often predetermined before it even began due to targeted numbers of citizens to be executed or imprisoned in Gulag prison camps.

&quot;Troika&quot; means &quot;a group of three&quot; or &quot;triad&quot; in Russian.

== Background ==
The first troika was instituted in 1918, the members being Felix Dzerzhinsky, Yakov Peters, and Left SR V. Aleksandrovich.

The first &quot;operational troikas&quot; (оперативная тройка) were introduced in the &quot;centre&quot;, in the Moscow military okrug in 1929. The qualifier &quot;operational&quot; denotes they were based on the &quot;operational departments&quot; of the state police (OGPU). The troikas were tasked with administering quick punishment of anti-Soviet elements, without public trial or investigation. The sentences that were doled out, executions, were to be held in secret.

In January 1930, as part of the collectivization program, the Soviet Politburo authorized the state police to screen the peasant population of the entire Soviet Union. Normal legal procedures were suspended and the corresponding OGPU order of the 2nd of February, specified the measures needed for &quot;the liquidation of the kulaks as a class&quot;. This instituted a regional based system for these troikas to work, so that the operations could be handed locally and with a quicker result. In each region, the troikas would decide the fate of the landlords branded as &quot;kulaks&quot;. The troika, composed of a member of the state police, a local communist party secretary, and a state procurator, had the authority to issue rapid and severe verdicts (death or exile) without the right to appeal. In effect they served as judges, juries, and executioners.

The secret police troikas became an execution machine, implementing persecutions and torture of priests or other &quot;anti-Soviet elements.&quot; This was done in secret and the victims of these trials often stood no chance at fighting the claims placed before them. They were often forced to give evidence against themselves and watch as the members of the troika sentenced them, often to death.

Gradually, troikas were introduced to other parts of the Soviet Union for various and different purposes: &quot;court troikas&quot; (судебная тройка), &quot;extraordinary troikas&quot; (чрезвычайная тройка), and &quot;special troikas&quot; (специальная тройка).
At the beginning of the Great Patriotic War the NKVD was tasked with deporting thousands of Germans from the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This decree issued from Moscow in 1941 was the responsibility of the Troika and all measures of decrees execution were left in the hands of the so-called three who made up this particular Troika. After the war responsibilities within the government began to shift and in 1952 two special Troikas were created. The first Troika consisted of Georgy Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev (who was also heavily involved with the Great Purge and Show trial), and Nikolai Bulganin. The second consisted of Lavrentiy Beria, Mikhail Pervukhin, and Maksim Saburov. These troikas were created to make sure there were clear duties between party and state; although it was common to be involved on both party and state committees, this blurred the lines between party and state functions.

== Secret Order № 00447 — the &quot;Kulak Operations&quot; ==
 On June 28, 1937, the Politburo issued a decree to set up a troika in West Siberia. While the original intent was to discover if there was a plot stemming from the ROVS, a group of white officers based in Paris, this can be seen as the first step in the creation of order NKVD Order no. 00447. 

The NKVD Order no. 00447 by July 30, 1937 &quot;О репрессировании бывших кулаков, уголовников и других антисоветских элементов&quot; (&quot;Concerning the repression of former kulaks, criminals, and other anti-Soviet elements&quot;) undersigned by Nikolai Yezhov. By this order, troikas were created on the levels of republic, krai and oblast. Investigation was to be performed by &#x27;operative groups&#x27; &quot;in a speedy and simplified way&quot; and the results were to be delivered to troikas for trials. The regional troikas had control over the target groups, the size of the initial limits, the extension of the deadline for completing the operation, the relationship between the initial limits and the final number of victims&quot; Initially, the target groups were limited to only Kulaks and criminals. After some time it broadened to enemies of the Motherland.

The chairman of a troika was the chief of the corresponding territorial subdivision of NKVD (People&#x27;s Commissar of a republican NKVD, etc.). Usually a troika included the prosecutor of the republic/krai/oblast in question; if not, he was allowed to be present at the session of a troika. The third person was usually the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) secretary of the corresponding regional level. The staff of these troikas were personally specified in the Order No. 00447. While Order 00447 decreed the personal constitution of all &quot;troikas&quot;, in the course of the Purge many members of &quot;troikas&quot; were repressed themselves, so the staff of &quot;troikas&quot; varied over time.

Protocols of a troika session were passed to the corresponding operative group for executions of sentences. Times and places of executions of death sentences were ordered to be held in secret. Troikas of this purpose were established for a period of 4 months, but functioned for about a year. 

When Operation No. 00447 was finally stopped, on November 17, 1938, by the Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation, issued jointly by the Sovnarkom and Central Committee of the CPSU, it is estimated that up to 767,000 persons had been condemned, of whom 387,000 had been executed by shooting.

== The &quot;National Operations&quot; ==
On August 11, 1937, following a Politburo top-secret resolution taken two days earlier, Nikolai Yezhov issued another secret directive, Order No. 00485, aimed at &quot;the complete liquidation of local branches of the Polish Military Organization (POW) and its networks of spies, wreckers and terrorists in industry, transport and agriculture&quot;.

Due to a backlog of people being processed by &quot;dvoikas&quot; (two person extrajudicial commissions) as part of the Polish Operations, on September 15, 1938, the Politburo issued the resolution (# П64/22) about the creation of special troikas (Особая тройка) for the period of the Polish operation of the NKVD.

Order No. 00485 served as a model for a series of similar NKVD &quot;National Operations&quot; targeting a number of the Soviet Union&#x27;s diaspora nationalities and ethnic groups: the German, Finnish, Latvian, Estonian, Romanian, Greek, and Chinese. The NKVD referred to these decrees collectively as &quot;the National Operations&quot; directed against &quot;nationalities of foreign governments&quot;.

According to NKVD statistics, from July 1937 to November 1938, 335,513 persons were sentenced by troikas in the course of the implementation of the National Operations. Among them, 247,157 (or 73.6%) were executed by shooting.

== The American Jewish Joint Agricultural Cooperation and Birobidzhan (JAR) ==
The American Jewish Joint Agricultural Cooperation Agro-Joint, 1924–1938 worked to permanently resettle Jews from shtetls (small Jewish settlements) into new agriculture based settlements across Southern Ukraine and Crimea. Agro-Joint had aided in the resettlement of German-Jewish doctors to help grow the living standards of the communities. Germans were among the top nationalities being repressed and eliminated in Soviet Russia during the thirties while Stalin prepared for war with Hitler. During the Great Purge, 1937–38, there was a directive to rid the Soviet lands of all those with outside (non-Soviet) ties or connections. Members of the Agro-Joint, as well as foreign colonies and national diasporas such as the settlements they established, fell squarely within those parameters. Although the Agro-Joint was never intended as a permanent program, the swiftness and fierceness with which it was dismantled by the Soviet Regime shocked those involved, in particular, its leader Joseph Rosen whose network of internal Soviet connections fell to the purges.

In total around 60 high-ranking members of the Agro-Joint staff were arrested, most of whom were tried and sentenced by NKVD Troikas on the grounds of being counter-revolutionaries, nationalists, or spies.

Happening in conjunction with the resettlements by the Agro-Joint was the Soviet Union&#x27;s attempt at giving the Jewish population a homeland. This was the Jewish Autonomous Region commonly referred to by its central city Birobidzhan established in 1928, though not officially recognized as an Autonomous Region by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of USSR until May 1934. Though conditions were tough and approximately 2/3rds of the original settlers left upon seeing that things were not as promised, those that remained founded Birofeld, the first Jewish collective farm in 1928. In 1936, barely a year after the official recognition as an Autonomous Region, The Great Terror began and the Jewish Party leadership both in Moscow and Birobidzhan was decimated by arrests and fast trials (by troika), resulting in either imprisonment or execution on charges such as &quot;bourgeois nationalism&quot; or being spies for the Germans. Prominent Jewish writer Moyshe Litvakov confessed to being an agent for the Gestapo.

== The Katyn Massacre ==
The Katyn Massacre was a mass execution of around 15,000 Polish military officers carried out by the NKVD during the spring of 1940. The killings took place in the Katyn forest in Russia and other cites. After a request from Polish general Władysław Anders on the whereabouts of the 15,000 Polish POWs in 1941, the Soviet Union replied that the soldiers had fled and could not
be located. The whereabouts of these prisoners remained unknown until 1943 when approximately 4,000 bodies were found by German soldiers at the Katyn location. Physical evidence suggested that the soldiers were shot in the back of the head and then buried in large piles. The Soviet Union went on to deny these killings until 1990 when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged that the Soviet Union was, in fact, responsible for the deaths. Many of the documents surrounding the massacre were destroyed and others were not made public until 2010.

According to the released documents, the executions were authorized by a troika consisting of Vsevolod Merkulov, Bogdan Kobulov, and Leonid Bashtakov.

<text>Robert C. Morgan (1943 – October 23, 2024) was an American art critic, art historian, curator, poet, and visual artist.

==Life and career==
Robert C. Morgan received his M.F.A. in sculpture from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1975 and his Ph.D. in art education from New York University in 1978. Professor Morgan had an extensive academic career. He taught at New York University, Wichita State University, the University of Rochester, the School of Visual Arts, Barnard College, and Columbia University. From 1981- 2001, he was Professor of the History and Theory of Art at the Rochester Institute of Technology. He was an adjunct professor of Fine Arts in the Graduate School of Fine Arts at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York.

Morgan worked extensively as an independent curator. He organized museum retrospectives of Allan Kaprow (1979) and Komar and Melamid (1980), both at the Ulrich Museum of Art in Kansas. In 1990, he curated &quot;Concept -- Decoratif&quot; in conjunction with the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York. From 1989 to 1990, he directed the Nahan gallery in SoHo in New York City where he curated a dozen exhibitions of both emerging and established artists, including Carolee Schneemann, Nancy Grossman, Hung Liu, Hong-Wen Lin, Robert Barry, Douglas Huebler, Mel Bochner, Antoni Muntadas, and Max Ernst. In 1994, he co-organized the exhibition &quot;Logo Non Logo&quot; with French critic Pierre Restany at the Thread Waxing Space in New York, which later traveled to the Art Museum of the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida.

Morgan authored numerous books, catalogs and monographs on contemporary artists in various countries. His book on the American conceptualist Robert Barry was published by Karl Kerber Press in Bielefeld, Germany (1986). Haim Steinbach was published by the Musee d’Art Contemporain, Bordeaux (1988). &quot;Duchamp, Androgyny, Etc.&quot;, (on Marcel Duchamp) was published by Editions Antoine Candau in Paris (1990). A Hans Bellmer &quot;Miscellany&quot; was published by Baum/Malmburg in Malmö, Sweden in 1993. His &quot;Turkish Bath&quot; installation at Artists Space in 1976 has been recognized an early example of post-conceptual art.

Morgan frequently wrote art criticism for the Brooklyn Rail. His books and collected critical essays published include commentaries on conceptual art, post-conceptual art, and the new media arts (Umbrella Associates, 1992). He published the following books in the United States: &quot;After the Deluge: Essays on the Art of the Nineties&quot;, (Red Bass Publications, 1993), &quot;Conceptual Art: An American Perspective&quot; (McFarland, 1994); &quot;Art into Ideas: Essays on Conceptual Art&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 1996), &quot;Between Modernism and Conceptual Art&quot; (McFarland, 1997): and &quot;The End of the Art World&quot; (Allworth Press, 1998).

His critical anthologies on Gary Hill (2000) and Bruce Nauman (2002) were published by Johns Hopkins University Press. An edited volume of the late writings by the critic Clement Greenberg was published by the University of Minnesota Press in 2003. In 1995, he traveled to Korea on a Fulbright Fellowship.

Morgan died from amyloidosis on October 23, 2024, at the age of 81.

<text>Achille Bonito Oliva (born 1939) is an Italian art critic and historian of contemporary art. Since 1968 he has taught history of contemporary art at La Sapienza, the university of Rome. He has written extensively on contemporary art and contemporary artists. He originated the term &quot;Transavanguardia&quot; to describe the new direction taken in the late 1970s by artists such as Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Nicola De Maria, and Mimmo Paladino. He has organised or curated numerous contemporary art events and exhibitions; in 1993 he was artistic director of the Biennale di Venezia.

== Life and career ==

Bonito Oliva was born in 1939 in Caggiano, in the province of Salerno, in Campania in southern Italy. He studied law, and then took a degree in letters. He took part in events connected with the avant-garde Gruppo 63 literary movement of the 1960s. From 1968 he taught history of contemporary art at La Sapienza, the university of Rome. 

He became active as an art critic, as a writer on history of art – with work on Mannerism, the historic Avant-Garde movements, and the Neo-Avantgarde – and as an organiser and curator of contemporary art events and exhibitions.

In 1979, in an article in &quot;Flash Art&quot;, he coined the term &quot;Transavanguardia&quot; to describe the work of artists such as Sandro Chia, Francesco Clemente, Enzo Cucchi, Nicola De Maria and Mimmo Paladino, who – in a manner comparable to that of the Neo-Expressionists and the Neue Wilden – discarded the abstract and conceptual approach of the Neo-Avantgarde and instead returned to figurative painting using the traditional techniques and materials, and at times also the forms and motifs, of the past. Bonito Oliva curated an exhibition of their work at Biennale di Venezia in 1980. He later broadened his definition of the movement to include artists such as Jeff Koons and Julian Schnabel, bringing it closer to the international concept of Postmodernism.

He was the artistic director of the Biennale di Venezia of 1993, and has organised or curated numerous contemporary art events and exhibitions.

== Books ==

Bonito Oliva has written many books, including monographs on artists such as Marina Abramović, Francis Bacon, Georg Baselitz, Joseph Beuys, Alighiero Boetti, James Lee Byars, Giorgio de Chirico, Braco Dimitrijević, Marcel Duchamp, Giuseppe Ducrot, Alex Katz, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Frida Kahlo, Paul Klee, Nam June Paik, Joan Miró, Pino Pascali, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Mario Schifano, Nancy Spero, Andy Warhol, Wolf Vostell, and Robert Wilson.

<text>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a federal agency within the legislative branch of the United States government that provides budget and economic information to Congress.
Inspired by California&#x27;s Legislative Analyst&#x27;s Office that manages the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion, the CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974.

Whereas politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the CBO when its estimates have been politically inconvenient, economists and other academics overwhelmingly reject that the CBO is partisan or that it fails to produce credible forecasts. There is a consensus among economists that &quot;adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals.&quot;

==History==
The Congressional Budget Office was created by Title II of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-344), which was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on July 12, 1974. Official operations began on February 24, 1975, with Alice Rivlin as director.

The CBO&#x27;s creation stems from a fight between President Richard Nixon and a Democratic-controlled Congress. Congress wanted to protect its power of the purse from the executive. The CBO was created &quot;within the legislative branch to bolster Congress&#x27;s budgetary understanding and ability to act. Lawmakers&#x27; aim was both technical and political: Generate a source of budgetary expertise to aid in writing annual budgets and lessen the legislature&#x27;s reliance on the president&#x27;s Office of Management and Budget.&quot; In 2015, the Brookings Institution reported that since its creation, the CBO has since supplanted the OMB &quot;as the authoritative source of information on the economy and the budget in the eyes of Congress, the press, and the public.&quot;

==Mission==

The Congressional Budget Office is nonpartisan, and produces &quot;independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process.&quot; Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation, without issuing any policy recommendations.

With respect to estimating spending for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office serves a purpose parallel to that of the Joint Committee on Taxation for estimating revenue for Congress, the Department of the Treasury for estimating revenues for the Executive branch. This includes projections on the effect on national debt and cost estimates for legislation.

==Operations==
Section 202(e) of the Budget Act requires the CBO to submit periodic reports about fiscal policy to the House and Senate budget committees to provide baseline projections of the federal budget. This is currently done by preparation of an annual &quot;Economic and Budget Outlook&quot; plus a mid-year update. The agency also each year issues &quot;An Analysis of the President&#x27;s Budgetary Proposals&quot; for the upcoming fiscal year per a standing request of the Senate Committee on Appropriations. These three series are designated essential titles distributed to Federal Depository Libraries and are available for purchase from the Government Publishing Office. The CBO often provides testimony in response to requests from various Congressional committees and issues letters responding to queries made by members of Congress.

==Divisions==
The Congressional Budget Office is divided into nine divisions.
* Budget Analysis
* Financial Analysis
* Health Analysis 
* Labor, Income Security, and Long-Term Analysis
* Macroeconomic Analysis
* Management, Business, and Information Services
* Microeconomic Studies
* National Security
* Tax Analysis

==Director==
The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate jointly appoint the CBO Director after considering recommendations from the two budget committees. The term of office is four years, with no limit on the number of terms a director may serve. Either house of Congress, however, may remove the director by resolution. At the expiration of a term of office, the person serving as Director may continue in the position until his or her successor is appointed. The list of directors of the CBO are:

== Reception ==
Whereas politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the CBO when its estimates have been politically inconvenient, economists and other academics overwhelmingly reject that the CBO is partisan or that it fails to produce credible forecasts.

A March 2017 survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the notion that &quot;adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals.&quot; According to MIT economist David Autor, the &quot;CBO has a good track record with a very difficult assignment. It errs, but not systematically or with partisan intent.&quot; According to Yale economist Christopher Udry, &quot;There is no credible evidence of partisan bias.&quot; Economist Walter E. Williams, a classical liberal, wrote in 1998 that the CBO was well-regarded for its &quot;honest numbers&quot; on fiscal and economic matters. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;the CBO&#x27;s analyses and forecasting are regarded as good or better than others doing similar work... economists say that the CBO&#x27;s economic projections generally compare favorably against other outfits, and its long-term budget estimates have been fairly accurate.&quot;

According to George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder, the CBO &quot;has emerged over its history as a neutral analyst of congressional budgets and cost estimates for proposed legislation.&quot; The agency has &quot;a nonpartisan staff culture&quot;.

Historically, the House Budget Committee and Senate Budget Committee have insulated the CBO from external pressures and attempts to politicize or weaken the office. Professor Philip Joyce of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy writes:

<text>Langford Lodge Airfield is a former United States Army Air Forces and Royal Air Force station near Belfast, Northern Ireland. Today the airfield is owned by RLC (UK) a subsidiary of RLC Engineering Group which is headquartered in the Isle of Man. Langford Lodge is located on the eastern shores of Lough Neagh and close to RAF Aldergrove/Belfast International Airport and the former RAF Nutts Corner.

The site was also known as No. 20 Satellite Landing Ground.

==History==
Planned to be a Satellite Landing Ground for No. 23 Maintenance Unit at RAF Aldergrove, Langford Lodge was selected in October 1941 to be developed as an air deport for the maintenance and repair of USAAF aircraft. A scheme was devised whereby the British Ministry of Aircraft Production would build the airfield and necessary facilities, while the American Lockheed Aircraft Corporation would staff the depot with civilian employees. Built during January-October 1942, and extended during the winter of 1943-44, the airfield eventually had two concrete runways, 26 pan hardstandings with 100 &#x27;fingers’ for aircraft storage, and nine T2, eight Robin and some 20 Butler hangars, plus a Lockheed-designed hangar.

Essentially, Langford Lodge was one of four primary air depots in the UK which during the period up to July 1944 when the contractual arrangements with Lockheed were terminated, provided complete logistical, ie supply and service back-up facilities to the USAAF, initially the 8th Air Force and then also the 12th, 9th and 15th Air Forces, albeit less extensively. The other two, larger, depots were at Burtonwood and Warton in Lancashire but there were links between all three which were formalised by the setting up of a Base Air Depot Area organisation (BADA) in September 1943, at which time Langford Lodge was officially designated the 3rd Base Air Depot.

From July 1944 until its closure at the end of July 1945, the base functioned as a Storage and Experimental Station, continuing to do some of die work for which it had previously been responsible and, as the war moved towards a conclusion salvaging increasing numbers of war-weary aircraft. For a few months in 1944, Langford Lodge was also the base for Ferrying Squadrons of the 27*&#x27; Air Transport Group.

Following its closure in 1945, the airfield was placed in Care and Maintenance until 1952 when it was refurbished and used briefly to accommodate the RAF&#x27;s No 5 Air Navigation School until its disbandment in January, 1953.

The following units were here at some point:
* No. 4 Air Navigation School RAF was formed here on 22 September 1952 but disbanded less than two months later on 15 November 1952
* No. 5 Air Navigation School RAF from 15 November 1952 until 31 January 1953 using Avro Ansons until it was disbanded
* Sub site of No. 257 Maintenance Unit RAF (March 1946– ?)

Langford Lodge was a target in Operation Grün (Ireland), a second front to Operation Sea Lion, which was the planned Nazi invasion of Britain. German paratroopers were to capture Langford Lodge, Aldergrove and Nutts Corner while RAF Long Kesh, Lisburn was to be destroyed.

Notably, on 2 March 1989 a Dan-Air BAe 748 from Newcastle, bound for Belfast International Airport, mistakenly landed at Langford Lodge. 

Some of the wartime airfield facilities used to house the Ulster Aviation Society&#x27;s Heritage Centre. Exhibits included a Blackburn Buccaneer, a Hawker Sea Hawk and a Westland Wessex. In 2005 the society moved to Maze Long Kesh, Lisburn.

==Today==
Langford Lodge is currently home to two model flying clubs; Langford Model Aviation and Langford Model Heli Club.

There is a rocket sled track owned by Martin-Baker for ejection seat testing. The track, running alongside the old main runway, has been in use since 1971.

<doc id="1053745" wikidata="Q804222" url="?curid=1053745" title="Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)">
<text>Black Mountain, also known as Galambary to the Ngunnawal people, is a small mountain with an elevation of that is situated to the west of the Canberra central business district on the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, in the Australian Capital Territory of Australia. Black Mountain is protected from development by the Canberra Nature Park and is predominantly covered in native bushland and is a haven to native wildlife.

== Cultural significance ==
Galambary (Black Mountain) is a sacred Aboriginal meeting and business site, predominantly for men’s business. Black Mountain and adjacent Mount Ainslie are referred to as women’s breasts. Galambary was also used by Ngunnawal people as an initiation site, with the mountain itself said to represent the growth of a boy into a man.

==Location and features==
The mountain is located west of the main campus of the Australian National University and, together with the ridge, forms a natural west and northwestern boundary for Canberra city. Black Mountain rises above the water level of Lake Burley Griffin that lies at its base. Situated close to the highest point on the mountain is Black Mountain Tower (previously known as Telstra Tower, and Telecom Tower), a broadcasting tower rising a further above the summit.

The Australian National Botanic Gardens and the CSIRO share the eastern base of Black Mountain, next to the Australian National University.

Black Mountain was originally named Black Hill at the same time as the naming of nearby Red Hill. The original name explains why the mountain is not named Mount Black, like nearby Mount Majura and Mount Ainslie. The early European settlers referred to the mountain formation as the Canberry Ranges.

==Geology==

The bulk of Black Mountain consists of the white quartz Black Mountain Sandstone. This was deposited in the late Early Silurian age. On the south-east slopes and north-west west there are exposures of State Circle shale. The Black Mountain Peninsula contains mudstone in the north and greywacke from the Ordovician age Pittman Formation in the south.

Drinfeld&#x27;s work connected algebraic geometry over finite fields with number theory, especially the theory of automorphic forms, through the notions of elliptic module and the theory of the geometric Langlands correspondence. Drinfeld introduced the notion of a quantum group (independently discovered by Michio Jimbo at the same time) and made important contributions to mathematical physics, including the ADHM construction of instantons, algebraic formalism of the quantum inverse scattering method, and the Drinfeld–Sokolov reduction in the theory of solitons.

He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990.
In 2016, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2018 he received the Wolf Prize in Mathematics. In 2023 he was awarded the Shaw Prize in Mathematical Sciences.

== Biography ==
Drinfeld was born into a Jewish mathematical family, in Kharkiv, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union in 1954. In 1969, at the age of 15, Drinfeld represented the Soviet Union at the International Mathematics Olympiad in Bucharest, Romania, and won a gold medal with the full score of 40 points. He was, at the time, the youngest participant to achieve a perfect score, a record that has since been surpassed by only four others including Sergei Konyagin and Noam Elkies. Drinfeld entered Moscow State University in the same year and graduated from it in 1974. Drinfeld was awarded the Candidate of Sciences degree in 1978 and the Doctor of Sciences degree from the Steklov Institute of Mathematics in 1988. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1990. From 1981 till 1999 he worked at the Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering (Department of Mathematical Physics). Drinfeld moved to the United States in 1999 and has been working at the University of Chicago since January 1999.

== Contributions to mathematics ==
In 1974, at the age of twenty, Drinfeld announced a proof of the Langlands conjectures for GL2 over a global field of positive characteristic. In the course of proving the conjectures, Drinfeld introduced a new class of objects that he called &quot;elliptic modules&quot; (now known as Drinfeld modules). Later, in 1983, Drinfeld published a short article that expanded the scope of the Langlands conjectures. The Langlands conjectures, when published in 1967, could be seen as a sort of non-abelian class field theory. It postulated the existence of a natural one-to-one correspondence between Galois representations and some automorphic forms. The &quot;naturalness&quot; is guaranteed by the essential coincidence of L-functions. However, this condition is purely arithmetic and cannot be considered for a general one-dimensional function field in a straightforward way. Drinfeld pointed out that instead of automorphic forms one can consider automorphic perverse sheaves or automorphic D-modules. &quot;Automorphicity&quot; of these modules and the Langlands correspondence could be then understood in terms of the action of Hecke operators.

Drinfeld has also worked in mathematical physics. In collaboration with his advisor Yuri Manin, he constructed the moduli space of Yang–Mills instantons, a result that was proved independently by Michael Atiyah and Nigel Hitchin. Drinfeld coined the term &quot;quantum group&quot; in reference to Hopf algebras that are deformations of simple Lie algebras, and connected them to the study of the Yang–Baxter equation, which is a necessary condition for the solvability of statistical mechanical models. He also generalized Hopf algebras to quasi-Hopf algebras and introduced the study of Drinfeld twists, which can be used to factorize the R-matrix corresponding to the solution of the Yang–Baxter equation associated with a quasitriangular Hopf algebra.

Drinfeld has also collaborated with Alexander Beilinson to rebuild the theory of vertex algebras in a coordinate-free form, which have become increasingly important to two-dimensional conformal field theory, string theory, and the geometric Langlands program. Drinfeld and Beilinson published their work in 2004 in a book titled &quot;Chiral Algebras.&quot;

<text>Gary Hill (born April 4, 1951) is an American artist who lives and works in Seattle, Washington. Often viewed as one of the foundational artists in video art, based on the single-channel work and video- and sound-based installations of the 1970s and 1980s, he in fact began working in metal sculpture in the late 1960s. Today he is best known for internationally exhibited installations and performance art, concerned as much with innovative language as with technology, and for continuing work in a broad range of media. His longtime work with intermedia explores an array of issues ranging from the physicality of language, synesthesia and perceptual conundrums to ontological space and viewer interactivity. The recipient of many awards, his influential work has been exhibited in most major contemporary art museums worldwide.

==Main themes and works==
Gary Hill&#x27;s work has often been discussed in relation to his incorporation of language/text in video and installation, most evident in a work like &quot;Incidence of Catastrophe&quot; (1987–88). In the late 1960s, he began making metal sculpture and, in Woodstock, New York, engaged by wire sculpture&#x27;s sounds, explored extensions into electronic sound, video cameras and tape, playback/feedback, video synthesizers, sound synthesizers, installation-like constructions, video installations, interactive art and public interventions. Later in the 1970s, living in Barrytown, New York, interacting with poets/artists George Quasha and Charles Stein, he extended his growing interest in language to a level of poetics and complex text, as well as performance art and collaboration. Initially &quot;language&quot; for him was not specifically words but the experience of a speaking that emerged inside electronic space (certain sounds &quot;seemed close to human voices&quot;), which he called “electronic linguistics” (first in the transitional non-verbal piece, &quot;Electronic Linguistic&quot; [1977]). From that point, irrespective of whether a given piece uses text, his work in particular instances inquires into the nature of language as intrinsic to electronic/digital technology as art medium. Verbal language soon enters this electronic focus co-performatively, as an intensification of a dialogue with and within the medium, yet with a new language force all its own, its own unprecedented poetics. Highly realized single-channel works in this process include: &quot;Processual Video&quot; (1980), &quot;Videograms&quot; (1980–81), and &quot;Happenstance (part one of many parts)&quot; (1982–83), another stage of the dialogue with technology as a language site where machines talk back. Here the artist&#x27;s path moves to the celebrated language-intensive works of the 1980s: &quot;Around &amp; About&quot; (1980), &quot;Primarily Speaking&quot; (1981–83), &quot;Why Do Things Get in a Muddle? (Come on Petunia)&quot; (1984), &quot;URA ARU (the backside exists)&quot; (1985–86), and &quot;Incidence of Catastrophe&quot; (1987–88).

Art historian Lynne Cooke summarizes:
:A pioneer in his embrace of the then novel medium of video, Hill distinguished himself through a radical approach that both literally and conceptually deconstructed it. Single channel works were soon followed by installations in which video screens were unhoused, suspended, multiplied, miniaturized, or otherwise manipulated. On other occasions, video tubes mysteriously projected unframed images in dark fields; or from oscillating beacons panning an empty room, text and figure swiveled in anamorphic distortion. No artist of Hill&#x27;s generation probed this medium with such invasive scrutiny, and none deployed it with such protean irreverence. And when his restless curiosity led him to computer based technologies and virtual space in the early Nineties, few of his peers proved so avid or dedicated in exploiting this uncharted terrain for art making. Since he rarely deployed technology as a tool in service to an exploration of the visual world, questions of representation have played a relatively minor role in his work: typically, he treats mediums as sites and enablers of languages both verbal and visual. Surveying with hindsight what now amounts to more than three decades of his activity, it&#x27;s striking how far his path has veered from his peers&#x27;—and not least because it betrays so few allegiances to histories of representation.&quot;

The sheer richness and complexity of the artist&#x27;s work over four decades is open to continual further characterization. As an artist working from a &quot;core principle&quot;, often with strong conceptual aspects, his inner focus and dialogue within a given medium allows him high variability and unpredictability. Working with one or more principles at a time (e.g., the &quot;physicality&quot; of the medium and of languaging and imaging; &quot;liminality&quot; or the intense space between contraries and extremes of appearance), he can make it happen on multiple planes simultaneously—physical, personal, ontological, social, political—without reification of any one of them. Result: a singular event of reflexive speaking that marries mind and machine beyond any notion of reference as such—no stable signifier or signified, yet intense engagement at personal, emotional, and intellectual levels. Later works in computer animation—e.g., &quot;Liminal Objects&quot; (1995-), &quot;Frustrum&quot; (2006)—challenge one&#x27;s sense of &quot;object&quot; and mind-body boundaries and the very basis of our &quot;reality.&quot; Major projective installations—&quot;Tall Ships&quot; (1992), &quot;HanD HearD&quot; (1995–96), &quot;Viewer&quot; (1996), &quot;Wall Piece&quot; (2000), &quot;Up Against Down&quot; (2008)—raise these issues of physicality, objectivity, polyvalent signification, and language itself to a further human dimension—a principle of torsional engagement both within one&#x27;s own mind and body and up against the surface and face of the other. 
He was influenced by the intellectual orientation of conceptual art which dominated art of the 1970s, but he instinctively evolved beyond the conceptual as such, working into a refined domain of principle that put him in full processual and open dialog both with electronic media and the language of thinking. His reading of the fiction and philosophical literary essays of Maurice Blanchot, in particular, provided him with ideas relating to the way in which language impinges on phenomenological experience, and a notion of &#x27;the other&#x27;. Such reading informs Hill&#x27;s visual-poetic explorations of the interrelationships between language, image, identity, and the body. For example, in &quot;Cabin Fever&quot; he uses the binary opposition of light and darkness to convey the notion of an interaction between a self and an &#x27;other&#x27;. He has also explored immersive environments, as seen in his 1992 piece &quot;Tall Ships&quot;.
Hill&#x27;s work thoroughly exploits the capacity of video to offer complex nonlinear narratives that encourage active engagement on the part of the viewer. In Roland Barthes&#x27; terms, Hill&#x27;s video narratives can be understood as &#x27;writerly&#x27; texts.

<doc id="1053773" wikidata="Q1288359" url="?curid=1053773" title="Félix González-Torres">
<text>Félix González-Torres or Felix Gonzalez-Torres (November 26, 1957 – January 9, 1996) was a Cuban-born American visual artist. He lived and worked primarily in New York City between 1979 and 1995 after attending university in Puerto Rico. González-Torres’s practice incorporates a minimalist visual vocabulary and certain artworks that are composed of everyday materials such as strings of light bulbs, paired wall clocks, stacks of paper, and individually wrapped candies. He was openly gay and frequently explored themes around his sexuality and stigma in his work. González-Torres is known for having made significant contributions to the field of conceptual art in the 1980s and 1990s. His practice continues to influence and be influenced by present-day cultural discourses. González-Torres died in Miami in 1996 from AIDS-related illness. 

==Work==
González-Torres was trained as a photographer and his oeuvre incorporates this medium in varying ways. He is well known for works that transform commonplace materials into installations that foster meaningful responses from audiences, as well as works with which audiences can choose to physically interact, and works that may be manifested anew and can change each time they are exhibited. González-Torres stated “the only thing permanent is change,” always questioning the stability of the art object.

Throughout much of González-Torres&#x27;s practices, he purposefully incorporated dissonant information and formats. Examples of these contradictions include the way he structured courses as a professor, wrote press releases and texts, gave lectures, participated in interviews, and created varying strategies for each body of work. One particular example is the way Gonzalez-Torres structured a lecture on the occasion of a solo-exhibition of his work at The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago in 1994. Following a slide show of various artworks and exhibitions in which his work was included, Gonzalez-Torres proceeded to read a prepared statement reflecting on the current national deficit, government budget allocations for public housing versus military spending, incarceration and poverty rates, and inequitable wealth distribution. He closed the lecture with a quote from a &quot;New York Times&quot; article that establishes a legacy of contention around the separation of church and state. This methodology was intended to foster individuals’ right and responsibility to have their own point of view.

Over time the work has been interpreted through varying critical lenses, including: the subjective construction of histories, questions of monumentality and attachment to permanency; the profoundness of love and partnership, codes and resilience of queer love; the role of ownership; perceptions of value and authority; discourse around death, loss, and the potentiality of renewal; questions of display and conditions of reception, notions of disidentification; the role and subversiveness of beauty; the rewards and consequences of generosity; arbitrary delineations between private and public selves/places; social, political, and personal dimensions of the AIDS epidemic; questions of established economic and political structures; occupation of the margins and infiltration of centers of power; the instability of language and what is connoted vs. denoted; somatic responses/forms of knowledge; etc. At the core of so many of the artist’s works is the physical experience of the works and their capacity to be manifest in perpetually changing circumstances. 

Gonzalez-Torres stated that his work requires an audience, following Bertolt Brecht’s theory of Epic Theatre. This is a theory that means an audience member is primed to have an individualized response to a performance that leads them to effect change in the world. Gonzalez-Torres maintained that his work should always remain open to new and changing interpretations. While Gonzalez-Torres’s work is conceptual, the formal qualities of the work are especially powerful in their ability to elicit individualized emotional responses from each viewer. “My work is about the daily dealing with events, and objects that form, transform, and affect my positioning.”

=== Categories and bodies of work ===
Categories and Bodies of Work most often reflect the way that Gonzalez-Torres commonly referred to works in his lifetime. Certain works may fit into more than one category/body of work. Some bodies of work by González-Torres&#x27;s are accompanied by Certificates of Authenticity and Ownership. The certificate includes information about the parameters for installing or exhibiting the work, the conceptual nature of the work, as well as the owner&#x27;s integral role in the artwork.

==== Billboards ====
The billboard works date from 1989 to 1995. The billboard works consist of specific images or texts that are installed at billboard scale. It is essential to 14 of the 17 billboard works that they must be installed in multiple, diverse, public/outdoor sets of locations (ideally 24 locations at a time). Documentation of each billboard location is an essential aspect of these works.
==== Birds in sky ====
The ‘birds in sky’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Images of birds in the sky are featured across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice, including billboards, doubles, framed photographs, paper stack, pedestals/platforms, and puzzles.

==== Candy works ====
The ‘candy works’ date from 1990 to 1993. The dimensions for the majority of the candy works include an “ideal weight.” (In total there are 20 candy works. Fifteen of the candy works have ideal ‘weights’, four of these ‘ideal weights’ may correlate to an average body weight of an adult male, and three may correlate to a combined average body weight of two adult men.) The medium for each candy work includes “endless supply” as well as “dimensions vary with installation.” When candies are present in a manifestation of a candy work, it is integral that viewers must be permitted to choose to take individual pieces of candy from the work. The candies may or may not be replenished at any time. Candy works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. Each of the candy works are unique.

==== Curtains ====
The ‘curtain’ works date from 1989 to 1995. The fabric curtain work is intended to be installed on existing windows as standard curtains would typically appear. There are five beaded curtain works, each with a specific bead pattern, and one fabric curtain work. Beaded curtain works must be installed in locations where individuals would naturally have the choice to pass through them and the work’s dimensions vary with installation. Curtain works can exist in more than one place at a time.

==== Doubles ====
The ‘doubles’ works date from 1989 to 1995. Doubled objects, images, and motifs feature across the majority of the bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice.

==== Framed photographs ====
The framed photographic works date from 1986 to 1995. The artist considered the frame to be an essential element of these works. This is one of many bodies of Gonzalez-Torres’s works that incorporate photographic methodologies. Many of the artist’s framed photographs were purposefully analog, developed and processed by hand, as opposed to other photographic works by Gonzalez-Torres which emphasized mechanical reproducibility and the overt removal of the artist’s hand.

==== Graphs ====
The ‘graph’ works date from 1988 to 1994. With the exception of one photograph, the ‘graph’ works are the only works that have hand drawn elements. The ‘graph’ works consist of both painting and drawings. While some of these works have been contextualized as representations of individuals’ medical charts, the graph works are intentionally non-specific and are also referential to other graphed data.

==== Image transfers ====
The ‘image transfers’ date from 1987 to 1992. All three of these works are made in editions. Two of these works are intended to be permanently installed directly on the wall and the third is intended to be permanently tattooed.

==== Light strings ====
The ‘light string’ works date from 1992 to 1994. The light strings were produced by an electrician in conversation with the artist and consist of commonplace electrical components. Each light string work can only exist in one place at a time; which is in contrast to Gonzalez-Torres’s manifestable works that are also made of commonplace materials. The dimensions of a light string work vary with each installation; the exhibitor’s choice of configuration for each installation completes the work. There are 24 individual light string works; 22 are unique and two are editioned works. The light strings works are intended to be displayed either with all the bulbs on or all the bulbs off; light bulbs are replaced promptly as necessary. The relative brightness of the lightbulbs for each light string work is specified but the actual brightness may vary from one installation to the next.

==== Mirrors ====
There are four individual mirror works dating from 1992 to 1994. Three of these works consist of mirrors of a specific size that are either hung on or embedded in the wall. One of the mirror works consists of a mirrored box that is displayed on the ground.

==== Multiples ====
The category of multiples represents those works made in edition sizes ranging from six to unlimited. There are 18 individual multiples in various mediums, dating from 1987 to 1995. Many of the works in this category purposefully resemble unique works, questioning notions of value and the power of the language of categorization.

==== Newspaper and magazine clippings ====
Imagery sourced from ‘newspaper and magazine clippings’ features across many bodies of work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice including paper stacks, puzzles, framed works and paintings. These works include images and texts that pertain to politics, violence, consumerism, mass culture, and religion. Images of crowds are especially prominent in this category of works, and this motif carries its own diverse scope of meanings in the artist’s work. 

==== Paintings ====
The ‘paintings’ date from 1992 to 1994. There are 15 individual paintings, and each of the works is unique. Five of the works are circular canvases painted black with circular newspaper/magazine clippings of crowd imagery adhered to the canvases. Seven of the paintings are graph works. Nine of the painting works include multiple components of the same or similar sizes and shapes.

==== Paper stacks ====
The ‘paper stacks’ date from 1988 to 1993. The paper stack works consist of a stack (or stacks) of paper. It is integral to the manifestable paper stack works that individuals must be permitted to choose to take individual sheets of paper from the work. Each paper stack work has a specific text, design, image, and/or paper color that is integral to the work. There are 45 individual paper stack works; three of the paper stack works are static (the sheets are not intended to be replenished) and four of the paper stack works have additional installation elements. The sheets used to manifest a paper stack work may or may not be replenished at any time. Manifestable paper stack works can exist in more than one place at a time and can vary from installation to installation based on the owner’s or authorized borrower’s interpretations. There are 42 unique paper stack works; four were made in an edition.

==== Pedestals / platforms ====
The ‘pedestals/platforms’ date from 1987 to 1992. There are seven individual pedestal/platform works, and each is unique. Two early sculpture works were presented on platforms, the first of the paper stack works includes a platform, one puzzle is presented on a platform, the one video work in Gonzalez-Torres’s practice includes a platform. Two works consist of platforms, one work that includes an optional performer and one of the mirror works. Strategies that identify and question the significance of modes of presentation for artworks can be traced throughout the artist’s practice.

==== Photostats ====
The ‘photostats’ date from 1987 to 1992. The photostats were made in small edition sizes ranging from one to four, typically with a single artist’s proof. The photostats consist of lines of white text reproduced on a solid black background. Each of the photostats are framed in simple black metal frames and the glazing reflects the viewer in the work. There are thirteen individual photostats. (These works have sometimes been referred to as ‘date pieces.’)

==== Portraits ====
The portrait works date from 1989 to 1994. The portrait works consist of a horizontal line (or lines) of textual entries installed directly on the wall just below the point where the wall meets the ceiling. It is essential to the portrait works that the owner has the right to change the content of the portrait at any time, which may include: adding, subtracting, editing and sequencing entries. Portrait works can exist in more than one place at a time and dimensions vary with installation. The typeface of the text for portrait works is Trump Medieval Bold Italic. The color of the text, and in some cases the optional band of background color, is specified for each work.

==== Puzzles ====
The 59 puzzle works date from 1987 to 1992. In the process of making these works, Gonzalez-Torres sent snapshots to commercial photo labs that produced novelty items, such as puzzles, from personal photos. The imagery for the puzzle works ranges from photographs of Gonzalez-Torres’s personal life to re-photographed newspaper/magazine clippings. Most consist of one individual puzzle, although four works consist of multiple components. Most puzzle works are made in editions of three with one AP (55 puzzles). There are three unique puzzle works. Those puzzles that were made in an edition may not have been produced at the same time or by the same commercial photo lab; which resulted in variations in cropping and color tone within the same edition. This body of work illustrates Gonzalez-Torres’s interest in varying modes of photographic reproduction, the effects of commercial production processes on the form of the works, and his utilization of commonplace consumer products in his practice. The puzzles were received from the photo lab fully assembled with a piece of cardboard backing and sealed inside a fitted plastic bag. For the majority of the puzzle works (56 puzzles), the artist considered the plastic bags to be an important part of the works and he described a specific method of installation using map pins (originally pushed through and eventually positioned against the plastic bags). For owner’s who requested to frame these works, the artist provided a separate methodology for framing.

===== Dateline installations =====

Across several bodies of work, starting as early as 1987, González-Torres employed a strategy, described by some as a “dateline,” wherein he included lists of various events/dates in a purposeful but non-chronological order. The lists included the names of social and political figures and references to cultural phenomena or world events, many of which had political and cultural historical significance. In the body of photostat works, the events/dates are printed in white type on black sheets of photographic paper presented in basic frames with reflective glazing. The viewer’s reflection was visible when reading the line of text. These lists of seeming non sequiturs prompted viewers to consider the relationships and gaps between the diverse references as well the construction of individual and collective identities and memories. González-Torres also employed this strategy for the portraits, as in &quot;Untitled&quot; (Portrait of Jennifer Flay) (1993), which includes, &quot;A New Dress 1971 Vote for Women, NZ 1893 JFK 1963&quot; as well as for the billboards, as in “Untitled” (1989), which includes, “People With AIDS Coalition 1985 Police Harassment 1969 Oscar Wilde 1895.”

=== Various Installations and Interpretations ===

All of González-Torres&#x27;s works, with few exceptions, are titled &quot;Untitled&quot; in quotation marks, sometimes followed by a parenthetical portion of the title. This was an intentional titling scheme by the artist. Rather than limiting the artworks by ascribing any singular title, the artist titled his works in this way to allow for open-ended interpretations to unfold over time. In a 1991 interview with Robert Nickas, González-Torres reflected on the titles of his artworks: “things are suggested or alluded to discreetly. The work is untitled because “meaning” is always shifting in time and place.”

González-Torres&#x27;s manifestable works incorporate the process of change. A 1991 installation of &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Placebo)&quot;, a candy work, consisted of a carpet (roughly 20 x 30 feet) of shiny silver wrapped candies. The candies covered the floor from one side of the room to the other and extended all the way to the back wall opposite the visitor. In 2011, the same candy work, &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Placebo),&quot; was installed at the Museum of Modern Art in two large rectangles divided by a walkway for visitors. A borrower/exhibitor may choose to install the work in any configuration and can also choose to use amounts of candies that differ from the &quot;ideal weight&quot;. Like other candy pieces in his oeuvre, this work has an &quot;ideal weight&quot; that remains constant while the actual weight of the installed candy may fluctuate during the course of an exhibition and also from one exhibition to the next. 

In 1989 González-Torres presented &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Memorial Day Weekend)&quot; and &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Veterans Day Sale)&quot;, exhibited together as &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Monuments)&quot;: block-like stacks of paper printed with ambiguous content, from which the viewer is allowed to choose to take a sheet. Rather than constituting a solid, immovable monument, the stacks can be dispersed, depleted, and renewed over time. 

At Roni Horn&#x27;s 1990 solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, González-Torres encountered her sculpture &quot;Forms from the Gold Field&quot; (1980–82). González-Torres later wrote about his experience of Horn&#x27;s work in &quot;1990: L.A., The Gold Field.&quot; which was first published in Horn&#x27;s catalogue &quot;Roni Horn. Earths Grow Thick&quot;.&quot; González-Torres and Horn became acquaintances in the early 1990s, and he later created &quot;Untitled&quot; (Placebo – Landscape – for Roni)&quot; (1993). 

One of his most recognizable works, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1991), a billboard work which features a black-and-white photograph of an unmade bed, was installed in twenty-four outdoor public locations all over New York City in 1992. Viewers would come upon the work unexpectedly while walking the streets in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Long Island City, and Manhattan. The billboards were installed in the same manner, scale, and location as existing commercial advertising billboards. The installation, &quot;Projects 34: Felix Gonzalez-Torres,&quot; was curated and organized by Anne Umland in her role as Curatorial Assistant at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The work is dated 1991, the same year as the death of his long-time partner, Ross Laycock, from AIDS-related illness. 

&quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time)&quot; is a billboard originally exhibited in 1992 in Hamburg, reading &quot;Es ist nur eine Frage der Zeit.&quot; Whereas the general phrase &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Matter of Time&quot; remains constant from one installation to the next, the language the phrase is presented in may change depending on the local languages where the work is being installed.

In 1993, González-Torres mounted two simultaneous gallery exhibitions in Paris entitled &quot;Travel #1&quot; (at Galerie Ghislaine Hussenot) and &quot;Travel #2&quot; at Galerie Jennifer Flay.

In addition to his manifestable “candy works” and “paper stacks”, González-Torres created other malleable works referred to as &quot;light strings&quot;, which consist of generally lower-wattage/dimmer light bulbs on extension cords, installed however the exhibitor chooses; eg. hung on the wall, piled on floor, strung across a doorway, etc. The body of light strings includes fifteen physically identical light strings, each has 42 light bulbs in white porcelain light sockets, the works are differentiated only by their parenthetical titles and the types of display/installation chosen by each work&#x27;s owner on an ongoing basis, as well as the display/installation that authorized borrowers chose in the context of loans. Each sculpture can be arranged in any way a particular installer wishes, and thus holds the potential for unlimited variations. Over the course of any given installation, some of the bulbs may burn out but the parameters of the work specify that they have to be replaced.

In 1991 González-Torres began producing sculptures consisting of strands of plastic beads strung on metal rods, which some have interpreted to include references to the organic and inorganic substances associated with battling AIDS.

=== Legacy ===
In May 2002, the Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation was created. The Foundation &quot;maintains, builds, and facilitates knowledge and understanding around the work of Gonzalez-Torres.&quot; The Foundation fields exhibition requests that include Felix Gonzalez-Torres&#x27;s work or respond to the artist&#x27;s practice in some way and offers ongoing guidance and support for these exhibitions. The Foundation maintains extensive exhibition and image archives and makes them accessible to anyone interested in learning about Gonzalez-Torres&#x27;s work. The Foundation also facilitates publication projects and licenses copyright in Gonzalez-Torres&#x27;s work. 

The Foundation assisted the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University in the organization of the Felix González-Torres Community Art Project, a three-year initiative that sponsors visits of internationally renowned contemporary artists to the campus of the school. The Foundation initiated and funded the California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) Felix González-Torres Travel Grant Program, a five-year initiative that funds travel based projects for CalArts students.

Since 1990, González-Torres&#x27;s work has been represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery, which exhibited his work both before and after his death. Starting in 2017, the estate of Felix Gonzalez-Torres has been co-represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery and David Zwirner gallery, New York.

In the second decade of the 21st century the critical legacy of González-Torres&#x27;s work has continued to be expanded and challenged. In 2010 Artforum published an article by artist and critic Joe Scanlan titled &quot;The Uses of Disorder&quot; that took a darker look at the soft power and neoliberal economics at play in González-Torres&#x27;s work. In 2017 there was public outcry over the fact that David Zwirner Gallery mounted an extensive exhibition of González-Torres&#x27;s work but made no mention of the role that AIDS played in the works&#x27; conceptual formation, either in the exhibition proper or its press release.

=== Art market ===
González-Torres&#x27;s candy work &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Portrait of Marcel Brient)&quot; (1992) sold for $4.6 million at Phillips de Pury &amp; Company in 2010, a record for the artist at auction at the time. In November 2015 González-Torres&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (L.A.)&quot; (1991), a 50 lb. installation of green hard candies, sold for $7.7 million at Christie&#x27;s, New York, a new record at the time. In 2024 his light-string work &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (America #3)&quot; (1992) sold for $13.6 million, also at Christie&#x27;s, a new record for the artist.

==Personal life and education==
In January 1970, González-Torres was sent from Cuba to Madrid, Spain when he was 12 with his older sister. Later that same year, he relocated to Puerto Rico.

González-Torres attended the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan from 1975-1979. He moved to New York on academic scholarship to study photography at Pratt Institute in 1979, attending the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1981 and 1983. He received a BFA in photography from Pratt Institute in 1983 and obtained an MFA from the International Center of Photography and New York University in 1987.

He was an adjunct Art Instructor at New York University, New York from 1987-1989 and in 1992. In 1990, Gonzalez-Torres lived in Los Angeles and taught at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). Gonzalez-Torres was a member of Group Material from 1987-1994. In 1992 González-Torres was granted a DAAD fellowship to work in Berlin, and in 1993 a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.

He became an American citizen by applying for naturalization as a refugee and he chose to refer to himself as American. His name has appeared as Félix González; professionally, he chose to style his name as Felix Gonzalez-Torres and also as Félix González-Torres in languages that include diacritics.

The artist met his long-term partner Ross Laycock in 1983 in New York. González-Torres and Laycock were in a relationship from 1983 – 1991; for the majority of their relationship they lived in different cities except for a period when they lived together in Los Angeles in 1990. In January 1991, Laycock died of AIDS-related causes in Toronto. Félix González&#x27;s partner towards the end of his life was Rafael Vasquez.

== Selected exhibitions ==
González-Torres staged many solo exhibitions, installations, and shows at galleries and museums in the United States and internationally during his lifetime. His notable solo shows include &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres&quot; (1988), New Museum, New York; &quot;Untitled: An Installation by Félix González-Torres as part of the Visual Aids Program&quot; (1989-1990), Brooklyn Museum, New York; &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres&quot; (1993), Magasin III Museum for Contemporary Art, Stockholm; &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres: Traveling&quot; (1994), originating at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres&quot; (1995-1996), originating at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, exhibited as &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres (A Possible Landscape)&quot; at Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, Santiago de Compostela, and as &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres (Girlfriend in a Coma)&quot; at Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de Paris.

The artist also participated in numerous group shows during his lifetime, including the Whitney Biennial (1991); the 45th Venice Biennale (1993); and the Biennale of Sydney (1996).

===Selected posthumous exhibitions===
====&quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres&quot; (1997)====
Immediately following the artist&#x27;s death in 1996, the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, organized a career retrospective of his work, in conjunction with the publication of a two-volume &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; covering nearly all of the artist&#x27;s output.

====U.S. Pavilion at the 52nd Venice Biennale (2007)====
In 2007, González-Torres was selected as the United States&#x27; official representative at the Venice Biennale, curated by Nancy Spector. The artist&#x27;s previously controversial status influenced the 1995 decision to reject him for the Venice pavilion in favor of Bill Viola. His posthumous show (the only other posthumous representative from the United States was Robert Smithson in 1982) at the U.S. Pavilion featured, among others, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1992–1995).

====&quot;Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form&quot; (2010–2011)====
Between 2010 and 2011, a traveling retrospective, &quot;Felix González-Torres. Specific Objects without Specific Form&quot;, was shown at Wiels Contemporary Art Centre in Brussels, the Beyeler Foundation in Basel, and the Museum für Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt. At each of the stages of the exhibition tour, the show was initially installed by the exhibition&#x27;s curator Elena Filipovic and, halfway through its duration, is completely reinstalled by a different selected artist whose own practice has been influenced by González-Torres. Artists Carol Bove, Danh Vo, and Tino Sehgal were chosen to curate the show&#x27;s second half.

==== &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation&quot; (2021)====
In 2021, the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art presented &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres: The Politics of Relation&quot;. The exhibition was curated by Tanya Barson.

==== &quot;Felix Gonzalez-Torres&quot; (2023) ====
In 2023, David Zwirner Gallery in New York staged its second posthumous solo exhibition of work by González-Torres, including two works that had never been executed as the artist envisioned. The first, &quot;&quot;Untitled&quot; (Sagitario)&quot; (1994-1995), is a variant of the double pools of water the artist had sketched before his death: two large pools of water were embedded in the gallery floor directly adjacent to one another. This work had first been executed posthumously as two outdoor pools embedded in the ground at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, in 2001 in conjunction with the group exhibition &quot;No es sólo lo que ves: pervirtiendo el minimalismo&quot;, but the artist had originally envisioned the pools to be installed indoors. The second newly exhibited work, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1994-1995), consists of a series of indoor billboard installations that the artist had originally designed for his unrealized exhibition at the Musée d&#x27;Art Contemporain in Bordeaux.

<doc id="1053774" wikidata="Q16926715" url="?curid=1053774" title="Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)">
<text>The Gifted Education Programme (GEP) is an academic programme in Singapore, initially designed to identify the top 0.25% (later expanded to 0.5%, then 1%) of students from each academic year with outstanding intelligence. The tests are based on verbal, mathematical and spatial abilities (as determined by two rounds of tests). Selected students will then be transferred to schools offering the GEP. GEP classes are designed to fit the students&#x27; learning ability, and may cover subjects in greater breadth and depth. The curriculum is designed by the Gifted Education Branch and eschews the use of textbooks for notes that have been prepared by GEP teachers. The programme has now been expanded to 1% of the students from each academic year.

==History==
The Gifted Education Programme was first implemented in Singapore in 1984 amid some public concern. It was initiated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in line with its policy under the New Education System to allow each student to learn at his/her own pace. The MOE has a commitment to ensure that the potential of each pupil is recognised, nurtured and developed. It was recognised that intellectually gifted pupils should be given apter classes to reach their full potential. From its inauguration in two primary schools and two secondary schools, the programme has now expanded to nine primary schools (as of October 2004) and was at its peak before the introduction of the Integrated Programme (IP).

In 2024, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced that the GEP will be discontinued in its present form and will be replaced by a school-based programme in which all primary schools will set aside resources to identify their high-ability students and stretch them academically. These changes will take effect starting with the Primary One cohort of 2024. Further details will be announced by Education Minister Chan Chun Sing at a later date.

==Primary Schools offering GEP==
As of 2020, nine primary schools offer GEP.

*Anglo-Chinese School (Primary)
*Catholic High School (Primary)
*Henry Park Primary School
*Nan Hua Primary School
*Nanyang Primary School
*Raffles Girls&#x27; Primary School
*Rosyth School
*Saint Hilda&#x27;s Primary School
*Tao Nan School

===Impact of the Integrated Programme===
In 2004, five secondary schools started implementing Integrated Programmes with their affiliated Junior Colleges, and are officially no longer offering the GEP. However, they still have programmes within their respective Integrated Programmes to cater to gifted students. While the secondary schools that have implemented the Integrated Programme remain generally unaffected by the change, Victoria School, which continued to offer the GEP, saw a drastic decrease in enrolment.

===Secondary Schools that are offering GEP, or SBGE===
The Gifted Education Programme came to a close in secondary schools in 2008 and was replaced by the School-Based Gifted Education (SBGE) programme.
All of the secondary schools that offer the SBGE are IP schools. There are generally two classes per cohort/year/level for SBGE students, but sometimes there may only be one class per cohort, depending on the cohort size.

*Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) 
*Dunman High School 
*Hwa Chong Institution
*Nanyang Girls&#x27; High School 
*NUS High School of Mathematics and Science
*Raffles Girls School (Secondary)
*Raffles Institution

Beginning in 2006, the MOE started to phase out the secondary school GEP due to the impact of the IP. However, GEP pupils who do not wish to take up the Integrated Programme after 2008 can enroll in schools with school-based special programmes at Secondary One. Examples of such schools are Anglo-Chinese School (Independent), Catholic High School, Methodist Girls&#x27; School and St. Joseph&#x27;s Institution.

==Selection Process==
At Primary Three (P3), all students, except those who opt-out, will take the first round of admission tests, the Screening Test. About 10% of students identified based on the Screening Test results will be invited to participate in the second round, the Selection Test. Based on the Selection Test results, the top 1% of the cohort will be identified and invited to join the Gifted Education Programme, usually by November of that year.

English and Mathematics papers are included as part of the Screening Test, while another two papers, General Ability I and General Ability II, are included in the Selection Test.

Before 2003, there was a third round of testing to allow entry for pupils who missed the chance in P3, after the PSLE. This last round of testing was offered to students who achieved 3 or more A*s for the PSLE. Students who enrolled at this stage were referred to as Supplementary Intake students. However, this practice was discontinued in 2003. The IP schools and the new NUS High School, specialising in Mathematics and Science, opened up opportunities for more pupils who were not already part of the primary school GEP, thus, there were ample opportunities to join these schools and therefore no need for a supplementary exercise to select students for the GEP at secondary schools.

==Progress in the Programme==
The pupils will have to study in this programme from Primary 4 to 6, and after that, the pupils can choose to continue studying in the programme only, in the Integrated Programme, or in the mainstream (not the GEP). Students also have a variety of top secondary schools to choose from depending on their PSLE results. Once the school is chosen, they will automatically enter the Express stream unless they choose otherwise.

==Distinction==

&quot;Research Project Studies (RPS)&quot; starting in Primary 4, is a program to teach skills needed in research. &quot;Individualized Study Options (ISO)&quot; is a compulsory programme for pupils in Primary 5, wherein pupils do research on a specific topic. The students are asked to choose their own projects in Primary Five under Teacher Mentors. The student-teacher ratio is normally from 4:1 to 5:1. The Study Options given were:
* Individualized Research Studies (IRS) → research and present your findings
* InnoVation Programme (IvP, formerly IP) → students invent or improve things to solve everyday problems
* Future Problem Solving (FPS) → Students solve future problems we may face in society

Pupils in the GEP have to take Social Studies as a graded subject. Based on the mainstream textbook syllabus, students will have to study in-depth content. Lessons in the GEP are conducted with no textbooks or workbooks, with the exception of Chinese and Higher Chinese; lessons are more discussion, worksheet, and project oriented.

Pupils in GEP learn poetry and literature (&quot;A Single Shard&quot; in Primary 4, &quot;The Giver&quot; in Primary 5, and &quot;Friedrich&quot; in Primary 6) as part of the &quot;Concept Unit&quot; under the English Language subject.

&quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; was used as the literature book for Primary 5 students until 2014 when it was replaced with &quot;The Giver&quot;. The main purpose is to show students how a dystopian society functions.

For English, students have to do different process writings based on the genres they have studied, including mysteries and fairy tales.

In Primary 6, a graded Mathematics Alternative Assessment (Math AA) is given. The pupils will have to choose from six or seven projects that GEP branch officers in the Ministry of Education (MOE) create. These projects are individual and include research, a product to be made and reflections. They will also be required to do a biography unit, of which one is an oral assignment, with the latter a written assignment.

== Integration with mainstream ==
In an article in The Straits Times on 3 November 2007, the MOE announced its new scheme to &quot;encourage&quot; greater integration between GEP and mainstream students, to combat elitism and encourage socialisation. GEP students in the nine primary GEP centres would spend up to 50% of their lesson time with the top 2% to 5% of the cohort, or the top mainstream students. Non-core subjects such as art, music, and physical education are conducted with the mainstream cohort. The announcement of the integration provoked much buzz in the blogosphere.

<text>Eutopia is a 2020 EP by British trip hop group Massive Attack, released on on the band&#x27;s YouTube account as a collection of three music videos; as of 2025, it remains unavailable on Music streaming services. The EP represents the band&#x27;s first work in four years, following the 2016 releases of the &quot;Ritual Spirit&quot; EP and the single &quot;The Spoils&quot;.

Recorded during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the three tracks feature spoken word passages from influential academics calling for action on climate change, tax havens and universal basic income.

== Background ==
During the spring of 2020, Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja worked on a politically-themed audio-visual Massive Attack EP called &quot;“Eutopia”&quot;, consisting of three tracks created across five cities during the COVID-19 global lockdown period, with documentary filmmaker Mark Donne, AI Art pioneer Mario Klingemann and vocal collaborations with Algiers, Young Fathers and US poet Saul Williams. The spirit of the EP was inspired by Thomas More&#x27;s 16th century book &quot;Utopia&quot; to address the need for global change amid COVID-19 pandemic.

Each of the tracks of &quot;Eutopia&quot; discusses a political issuethe climate crisis, tax havens, and universal basic incomeaccompanied with relevant commentary by public academics Christiana Figueres, Guy Standing, and Gabriel Zucman.

Professor Standing of the SOAS University of London said in an interview on the university website: &quot;The collaboration began when Massive Attack contacted me after the pandemic hit, which was shortly after my new book came out in March. I think they had read or at least seen my earlier book, which is my analysis of the ethical and economic foundations of basic income.&quot;

== Visuals ==
The visuals for the music videos were co-written and co-produced by Robert Del Naja and documentary filmmaker Mark Donne, using artificial intelligence manipulated by Mario Klingemann. He has previously collaborated with Massive Attack and filmmaker Adam Curtis on the &quot;Mezzanine XXI&quot; show.

<doc id="1053797" wikidata="Q5057735" url="?curid=1053797" title="Celebrity Farm">
<text>Celebrity Farm was a 2003 Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) reality television show, based on the international TV format &quot;The Farm&quot;, produced by Strix. Held along similar lines as &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Farm&quot; required eight of Ireland&#x27;s C-List celebrities to spend seven days on a farm with one being voted off every evening (or &quot;turfed out&quot; as RTÉ called it). It was hosted by &quot;Ear to the Ground&quot; presenter Mairead McGuinness and the prize money was €50,000 to the charity of their choice.

==Results==
Evictions were decided via a public televote, where the contestant getting the most votes would be &quot;turfed out&quot;.

1st evicted: Twink, pantomime actress

2nd evicted: Paddy O&#x27;Gorman, TV presenter

3rd evicted: Mary Coughlan, jazz musician

4th evicted: Kevin Sharkey, artist

5th evicted: Mary Kingston, children&#x27;s TV presenter

6th evicted: Tamara Gervasoni, then Rose of Tralee

Runner-up: Gavin Lambe-Murphy, gossip columnist

Winner: George McMahon, soap actor

The show was won by George McMahon, an actor from &quot;Fair City&quot;. He split his prize money between a children&#x27;s charity, a children&#x27;s hospital and a centre for those with disabilities. Kevin Sharkey had a serious disagreement with the other &quot;farmhands&quot;, as they were called, and subsequently refused to appear with them on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; after the series, instead appearing on rival chat show &quot;The Dunphy Show&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Celebrity Farm&quot; left a pitiful legacy for Irish television viewers. One witness reported that it had taken until 2012 &quot;to finally stop shuddering at the memory of such sitting room atrocities as RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Farm&quot;&quot;.

<text>Thargomindah (frequently shortened to Thargo) is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Bulloo, Queensland, Australia. The town of Thargomindah is the administrative centre for the Shire of Bulloo. In the , the locality of Thargomindah had a population of 243 people.

On 17 April 2020, the Queensland Government decided to reorganise the nine localities in the Shire of Bulloo, resulting in six localities. Thargomindah, previously being of the area immediately surrounding the town of Thargomindah, was enlarged through the incorporation of all of Bullawarra (except for a small portion in the south of Bullawarra which was absorbed into Bulloo Downs), all of Dynevor and all of Norley, creating a locality of .

== Geography ==
Thargominah is located in South West Queensland on the Adventure Way, approximately west of the state capital, Brisbane, and west of the town of Cunnamulla.

The town of Thargomindah is the administrative centre for the Shire of Bulloo. It lies on the Bulloo River in the centre of the locality.

Five main roads radiate from the town:

* the Bundeena Road goes west to Noccundra
* the Quilpie Road goes north-east to Quilpie
* the Cunnamulla Road (also known as the Bulloo Developmental Road and the Adventure Way) goes east to Yowah and Eulo and beyond to Cunnamulla
* the Hungerford Road goes south to Hungerford
* the Bulloo Downs Road goes south-west to Bulloo Downs

Thargomindah is part of the Channel Country where the rivers are mostly dry riverbeds except for seasonal flooding. The locality contributes to three major drainage basins:

* in the south-east, creeks flow into the Paroo River system in the Murray-Darling basin
* in the centre, creeks flow into the Bulloo River system in the Bulloo-Bancannia drainage basin
* in the north-west, creeks flow into Wilson River system in the Lake Eyre basin

The Bulloo River flows through the locality from the north-east (Quilpie) through the town and exits the locality to the south-west (Bulloo Downs).

The land is principally used for low density cattle grazing. The Dynevor Downs homestead is located on the Cunnamulla Road ().

Lake Bindegolly National Park is located in the east of the locality (). A portion of the Currawinya National Park is on the south-eastern boundary of the locality (), although the bulk of that national park was in adjacent Hungerford.

Lake Bullawarra is in the northwest of the locality () approximately NW of the town and is a nationally important wetland. It is a habitat for a vulnerable species, the Major Mitchell&#x27;s cockatoo.

== History ==

Thargomindah lies on the traditional lands of the Kalali people who seemed to have had a close association with the Wongkumara, Margany and Badjiri peoples from neighbouring regions along the Bulloo and Wilson Rivers. The Margany language (also known as Maranganji), the Badjiri language and the Kalali language (Galali) are now mostly extinct, although some revitalisation projects have been commenced.

The Thargomindah area was first explored by the British in the early 1860s by colonist Vincent James Dowling, who established the Thargomindah pastoral property in 1865 with his brother John Dowling. Violence with the Aboriginal people soon ensued and John Dowling was killed. In retribution, Vincent Dowling and a Native Police detachment under Sub-Inspector James Gilmour from the Yowah barracks pursued the Kalali. These forces massacred a large number of Kalali people near the Thuringowa waterhole. A recent publication disputes these accounts of the massacre.
After the massacre, a new Native Police barracks called the Bulloo Barracks was established on Dowling&#x27;s property at a crossing of the Bulloo River. From the 1870s, the town of Thargomindah developed around these barracks. Thargomindah is an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;echidna&quot;.

A post office was established in 1870 and a telegraph line connected the town to Cunnamulla in 1881.

Thargomindah Provisional School opened on 1 April 1884. In 1892 it became Thargomindah State School.

The 1890s saw the town prosper as the service and administrative centre of a pastoral district. An extension of the Western railway line to the town was planned for many years; however it never eventuated. The railway did reach Cunnamulla in 1898 and Quilpie in 1917.

Thargomindah was one of the first towns in Australia to produce hydroelectric power from 1898 until 1951. The old bore into the Great Artesian Basin was a source of energy when electric street lights were lit and coupled to a turbine driven by the bore&#x27;s natural water pressure. The generator was taken from a unit powered by a steam engine and purchased by the Bulloo Divisional Board becoming the first municipality owned power plant. After that power was supplied by diesel generators until 1988, when the town was connected to the state power grid via Cunnamulla. The power station is still operating with a daily opening to the public.

St Edmund&#x27;s Anglican Church at 60 Dowling Street () was dedicated on 22 October 1960 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. Its closure on 28 May 2003 was approved by Venerable Gary Frederick Harch, Archdeacon of the West. It is now used as a private home.

On 17 April 2020 the Queensland Government decided to reorganise the nine localities in the Shire of Bulloo, resulting in six localities. Thargomindah, previously being of the area immediately surrounding the town of Thargomindah, was enlarged through the incorporation of all of Bullawarra (except for a small portion in the south of Bullawarra which was absorbed into Bulloo Downs), all of Dynevor and all of Norley, creating a locality of .

== Heritage listings ==
Thargomindah has a number of nearby heritage-listed sites, including:

* Bulloo River, Bulloo Downs: Dr Ludwig Becker&#x27;s Grave
*Nappa Merrie Station, Durham: Burke and Wills Dig Tree
* Wilson Street, Noccundra: Noccundra Hotel

== Facilities ==
An information centre is located at 37 Dowling Street, Thargomindah. The building is a renovation of a children&#x27;s hostel which was built in early 1960, it then became a block of flats and ended up being an empty run-down building until converted to a very modern facility containing the Visitor Information Centre, Library and Coffee Shop. The hostel was used for children who lived in remote properties where they would board at the hostel during the week, returning home on the weekends to their families.

The Information Centre contains brochures, pamphlets and maps on the South West Queensland corner and surrounding areas. It is the first place where people stop when they visit Thargomindah to get the latest road conditions, directions, places to stay, things to see and do and the latest information on events.

Bulloo Shire Council operates Thargomindah Library at Shire Office, Dowling Street, Thargomindah.

Thargomindah has two fuel stations; Thargo Motors which is open Mon to Fri and Sat mornings and Thargo Roadhouse which has 24 hour fuel using an EFTPOS facility.

Accommodation consists of the Oasis Motel, Bulloo River Hotel Motel, Explorers Caravan Park and Napunyah Caravan Park.

Dining out options are the Oasis Motel, Bulloo River Hotel Motel, Coffee on Dowling and Thargo Roadhouse.

The nearest government secondary (8–12) school is Cunnamulla P–12 State School.

== Water ==

Thargomindah has a pressurised hot spring from a bore into the Great Artesian Basin and has produced hydroelectric power from the basin in the past. After 2 years of drilling, a good supply of water was found in 1893. The temperature was . In 1924, it was recorded that the bore had a daily output of and today of at . There is a plentiful water supply for the population and the arid area available for irrigation in front and backyards and public warm showers are provided.

It is operated by the Bulloo Shire Council and there are 2 scheduled flights from Brisbane each week on Regional Express Airlines. There is a sealed runway long and an unsealed runway long. It was completely rebuilt in 2018.

The Dynevor Downs Airport is located immediately to the east of the Dynevor Downs Homestead () with three unsealed runways (north–south, east–west, and NE–SW), the longest being , the others being about .

== Climate ==
Thargomindah has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;), very closely bordering on a hot arid climate (&quot;BWh&quot;), which is found in the western part of the shire. Summers are sweltering and generally dry except when monsoonal incursions into the continent bring heavy rain, whilst winters are warm and dry with cool to cold mornings.

<text>The Farm is a reality competition television franchise format created by the Swedish producer Strix. Over 100 licenses sold around the world and aired in more than 50 countries, &quot;The Farm&quot; is one of their most popular formats, including &quot;The Bar&quot; and &quot;Fame Factory&quot;. It has been constantly on air somewhere in the world since 2001. The format is distributed by Fremantle.

==Format==
&quot;The Farm&quot; puts a group of 12 to 14 people living together in a farm. The contestants must work as a normal farmer, raising animals and doing agriculture. In regular periods of time, one of the houseguests is evicted, usually in a ceremony called &quot;The Duel&quot; where they compete in a physical endurance, but in some adaptations of the show, it is the audience that decides, by telephone voting, who must leave &quot;The Farm&quot;.

Celebrity format, with participants being well-known public figures, is also common.

==International versions==

 there are 192 winners of &quot;The Farm&quot; format.

<text>Giorgio Sadotti (born 1955 in Manchester, UK) is a conceptual artist based in London.

In 1993, Sadotti exhibited at City Racing, and in 1996 participated in a group show organised by City Racing at Bricks and Kicks in Vienna run by Muntean and Rosenblum. Other solo exhibitions include the Henry Moore Institute (2006).

He described his work, &quot;Went to America Didn&#x27;t say a word&quot; (1999): 
&quot;On the morning of Saturday March 20, 1999, I flew on American Airlines from London Heathrow to New Yorks John F. Kennedy airport. I was wired for sound and upon arrival switched on my mini-disc recorder. I stayed overnight at a hotel on Lexington and 21st and flew back to London the following evening whilst in America I didn&#x27;t say a word, but all my waking hours were recorded.
He then exhibited the recordings in a three day exhibition. In order to experience the whole show the spectator would have to stay in the gallery for the full duration.&quot;

His work is held in the collection of the Tate and the British Council Art Collection. In 2003 he won a Paul Hamlyn Award for visual arts.

In December 2012, Sadotti exhibited in a one-person show at studio1.1, east London.

<text>James Sanders Holman (February 7, 1804 – December 8, 1867) was a soldier, entrepreneur, and the first mayor of Houston. 

==Early life==
Holman was born in Murfreesboro, Tennessee to Isaac and Polly Anne (Wiggleworth) Holman on February, 7, 1804. When he was about 13 years old, his family moved to Lincoln County, Tennessee. He married a first cousin Martha Wilson Holaman just after he turned 18 years old. He had at least 8 children. 

==Career==

Holman first arrived in Texas in 1834. His brother followed him to San Augustine, Texas, with several family members joining them the next year. Holman participated in the Texan Revolution, and fought in the Siege of Bexar. In 1836, the Allen brothersAugustus Chapman and John Kirby hired Holman as a real estate agent for the paper town of Houston. His signature appears on the city&#x27;s earliest known map, and also on many early deeds, as he both advertised and sold Houston lots.

Late in 1836, Holman organized the Texas Railroad, Navigation, and Banking Company with Augustus Chapman Allen and several others. The First Congress of the Republic of Texas granted the corporation a charter to construct canals and railroads, and to establish a bank after accumulating stock subscriptions of $1 million. The company, however, did not survive sustained political attacks by Anson Jones and the Panic of 1837. 

Holman served as clerk for Harris County, Texas, and while serving in this position, he assisted in bringing an incorporation bill for Houston in the Texas Congress.

On June 5, 1837, the Republic of Texas granted a municipal charter to Houston. In a three-way contest for mayor, Holman beat Francis Lubbock and Thomas J. Ward, 12-11-10. After he was elected in August 1837, her served for just three months. After a failed campaign to gain a seat in congress in 1838, he was elected as district clerk of Harris County and served from February 1839 to April 1841. 

During the American Civil War, he served on the Texas State Military Board from 1864 to 1865, a body established to help the Confederacy trade with foreign powers in spite of a blockade from the Union. After the war, he supervised construction of the Houston and Texas Central Railway.

==Death and legacy==
Holman succumbed to yellow fever in Bryan, Texas on December 8, 1867. The city of Houston named Holman Avenue after him.

<text>Archytas is a lunar impact crater that protrudes into the northern edge of Mare Frigoris. To the northwest is the comparably sized crater Timaeus, and the smaller Protagoras lies in the opposite direction to the southeast. Further to the southwest, beyond the opposite edge of the mare, is the dark-floored crater Plato.

The rim of Archytas is sharp-edged and shows little appearance of erosion due to subsequent impacts. The outer wall is nearly circular, with a slight outward bulge in the southeast. The interior is rough, with a ring of material deposited at the base of the inner wall. Just to the east of the crater midpoint is a pair of central peaks.

The surface surrounding the crater is relatively smooth to the south due to the lava flows that formed the mare. The surface is more rugged to the north and northeast. The satellite crater Archytas B, located to the northwest of Archytas, forms a lava-flooded bay along the edge of the Mare Frigoris.

Archytas is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Archytas.

<text>Adaptive Huffman coding (also called Dynamic Huffman coding) is an adaptive coding technique based on Huffman coding. It permits building the code as the symbols are being transmitted, having no initial knowledge of source distribution, that allows one-pass encoding and adaptation to changing conditions in data.

The benefit of one-pass procedure is that the source can be encoded in real time, though it becomes more sensitive to transmission errors, since just a single loss ruins the whole code, requiring error detection and correction.

==Algorithms==
There are a number of implementations of this method, the most notable are FGK (Faller-Gallager-Knuth) and Vitter algorithm.

===FGK Algorithm ===
It is an online coding technique based on Huffman coding. Having no initial knowledge of occurrence frequencies, it permits dynamically adjusting the Huffman&#x27;s tree as data are being transmitted. In a FGK Huffman tree, a special external node, called &quot;0-node&quot;, is used to identify a newly coming character. That is, whenever new data is encountered, output the path to the 0-node followed by the data. For a past-coming character, just output the path of the data in the current Huffman&#x27;s tree. Most importantly, we have to adjust the FGK Huffman tree if necessary, and finally update the frequency of related nodes. As the frequency of a datum is increased, the&quot; sibling property&quot; of the Huffman&#x27;s tree may be broken. The adjustment is triggered for this reason. It is accomplished by consecutive swappings of nodes, subtrees, or both. The data node is swapped with the highest-ordered node of the same frequency in the Huffman&#x27;s tree, (or the subtree rooted at the highest-ordered node). All ancestor nodes of the node should also be processed in the same manner.

Since the FGK Algorithm has some drawbacks about the node-or-subtree swapping, Vitter proposed another algorithm to improve it.

===Vitter algorithm===
Some important terminologies &amp; constraints :-
* Implicit Numbering : It simply means that nodes are numbered in increasing order by level and from left to right. i.e. nodes at bottom level will have low implicit number as compared to upper level nodes and nodes on same level are numbered in increasing order from left to right. In other terms, when we have built the Huffman tree, when merging two nodes into a parent node, we have set the one with the lower value as the left child, and the one with the higher value as the right child.
* Invariant : For each weight w, all leaves of weight w precede all internal nodes having weight w. In other terms, when we have built the Huffman tree, if several nodes had the same value, we prioritized merging the leaves over the internal nodes.
* Blocks : Nodes of same weight and same type (i.e. either leaf node or internal node) form a Block.
* Leader : Highest numbered node in a block.

Blocks are interlinked by increasing order of their weights.

A leaf block always precedes internal block of same weight, thus maintaining the invariant.

NYT (Not Yet Transferred) is a special node used to represent symbols which are &quot;&#x27;not yet transferred&#x27;&quot;.




 algorithm for adding a symbol is
 leaf_to_increment := NULL
 p := pointer to the leaf node containing the next symbol
 if (p is NYT) then
 Extend p by adding two children
 Left child becomes new NYT and right child is the new symbol leaf node
 &quot;p&quot; := parent of new symbol leaf node
 leaf_to_increment := Right Child of p
 else
 Swap p with leader of its block
 if (new p is sibling to NYT) then
 leaf_to_increment := p
 &quot;p&quot; := parent of p
 while (p ≠ NULL) do
 Slide_And_Increment(p)
 if (leaf_to_increment != NULL) then
 Slide_And_Increment(leaf_to_increment)

 function Slide_And_Increment(p) is
 previous_p := parent of &quot;p&quot;
 if (p is an internal node) then
 Slide p in the tree higher than the leaf nodes of weight wt + 1
 increase weight of &quot;p&quot; by 1
 &quot;p&quot; := previous_p
 else
 Slide p in the tree higher than the internal nodes of weight wt
 increase weight of &quot;p&quot; by 1
 &quot;p&quot; := new parent of &quot;p&quot;.

Encoder and decoder start with only the root node, which has the maximum number. In the beginning it is our initial NYT node.

When we transmit an NYT symbol, we have to transmit code for the NYT node, then for its generic code.

For every symbol that is already in the tree, we only have to transmit code for its leaf node.

====Example====

Encoding &quot;abb&quot; gives 01100001 001100010 11.

Step 1:

Start with an empty tree.

For &quot;a&quot; transmit its binary code.

Step 2:

NYT spawns two child nodes: 254 and 255, both with weight 0. Increase weight for root and 255. Code for &quot;a&quot;, associated with node 255, is 1.

For &quot;b&quot; transmit 0 (for NYT node) then its binary code.

Step 3:

NYT spawns two child nodes: 252 for NYT and 253 for leaf node, both with weight 0. Increase weights for 253, 254, and root. To maintain Vitter&#x27;s invariant that all leaves of weight w precede (in the implicit numbering) all internal nodes of weight w, the branch starting with node 254 should be swapped (in terms of symbols and weights, but not number ordering) with node 255. Code for &quot;b&quot; is 11.

For the second &quot;b&quot; transmit 11.

For the convenience of explanation this step doesn&#x27;t exactly follow Vitter&#x27;s algorithm, but the effects are equivalent.

Step 4:

Go to leaf node 253. Notice we have two blocks with weight 1. Node 253 and 254 is one block (consisting of leaves), node 255 is another block (consisting of internal nodes). For node 253, the biggest number in its block is 254, so swap the weights and symbols of nodes 253 and 254. Now node 254 and the branch starting from node 255 satisfy the SlideAndIncrement condition and hence must be swapped. At last increase node 255 and 256&#x27;s weight.

Future code for &quot;b&quot; is 1, and for &quot;a&quot; is now 01, which reflects their frequency.
