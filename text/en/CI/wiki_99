The character was killed off on 30 April 2004, after falling down the stairs in her flat after tripping over a toy when going to answer the door. Janine Evans (Charlie Brooks) was wrongly accused of murdering her after a receipt was found in Laura&#x27;s flat following a bust-up. Waterman&#x27;s mother Patricia Maynard played Laura&#x27;s mother in &quot;EastEnders&quot; for a couple of episodes in 2001, and her one-time step mother Rula Lenska had also made a guest appearance in the series during Laura&#x27;s run playing Frank Butcher&#x27;s girlfriend in the Spain episodes in 2002.

<text>Spadina was a Canadian electoral district that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1935 to 1988. It covered a portion of the western-central Toronto, Ontario. Its name comes from the Spadina Avenue, which runs through the heart of the riding.

It was formed in 1933 from portions of Toronto Northeast, Toronto Northwest, Toronto West Centre, and Toronto South. Its boundaries changed repeatedly over the years, when it created it stretched far north to the edge of the city boundaries. As this northern portion of became more populated it was split off into other ridings. Its eastern and western boundaries were more consistent, with it stretching from John Street in the east to Bathurst Street in the west. In 1987, due to the relative decrease in the population of downtown Toronto compared to other areas, it was merged with Trinity to form Trinity—Spadina. Some portions also went to the eastern riding of Rosedale.

<doc id="1078053" wikidata="Q273448" url="?curid=1078053" title="Miss Read">
<text>Dora Jessie Saint MBE (17 April 1913 – 7 April 2012),
née Shafe, best known by the pen name Miss Read, was an English novelist and, by profession, a schoolmistress. Her pseudonym was derived from her mother&#x27;s maiden name. She is best known for two series of novels set in the English countryside, the Fairacre novels and the Thrush Green novels.

==Biography==

Dora Jessie Shafe was born on 17 April 1913 in London, the younger of the daughters of Arthur Shafe, an insurance agent, and his wife Grace. For the sake of her mother&#x27;s health, the family moved to the country when Dora was seven, and she began school in Chelsfield, near Orpington, Kent, and later joined her older sister at Bromley county school. When her father became a schoolmaster, Dora followed his example and undertook teacher training at Homerton College, Cambridge.

From 1933 to 1940 she taught in Middlesex, first at Hayes and then at Ealing.

In 1940 she married Douglas Saint; they had one daughter, Jill.

After World War II she worked occasionally as a teacher, and began writing about schools and country topics for several magazines, including &quot;Punch&quot; and the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot;. She also worked as a scriptwriter for the BBC schools service.

From 1955 to 1996 Saint wrote a series of novels centered on two fictional villages, Fairacre and Thrush Green. The first Fairacre novel appeared in 1955, the last in 1996. The first Thrush Green novel appeared in 1959. The principal character in the Fairacre books, Miss Read, is an unmarried schoolteacher in a small village school, an acerbic and yet compassionate observer of village life. Saint&#x27;s novels are wry regional social comedies, laced with gentle humour and subtle social commentary. Saint was also a keen observer of nature and the changing seasons.

Many of the village novels were illustrated by J.S. (John Strickland) Goodall (1908-1996), an artist and picture-book author in his own right.

Saint also wrote two volumes of autobiography, &quot;A Fortunate Grandchild&quot; (1982) and &quot;Time Remembered&quot; (1986); the two were issued together in 1995 as &quot;Early Days&quot;.

Saint wrote 28 novels, 2 autobiographies and 14 other books; her books were translated into several languages including Japanese and Russian.

Saint retired in 1996. In 1998 she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her services to literature. She and her husband lived in Chieveley near Newbury in Berkshire.

Her husband died in 2004. She died on 7 April 2012.

==Influences and legacy==

One of the writers who influenced Saint was Jane Austen. Saint&#x27;s work also bears some similarities to the social comedies of manners written in the 1920s and 1930s and to the work of Barbara Pym.

Miss Read&#x27;s work has in turn influenced a number of writers, including American writer Jan Karon. The musician Enya has a track on her &quot;Watermark&quot; album named after Saint&#x27;s book &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot;, and one on her &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; album titled &quot;No Holly for Miss Quinn&quot;.

Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1900 and was one of the original 65 divisions contested at the first federal election. It is named after Sir Charles Cowper, an early Premier of New South Wales.

Except for one brief break, the seat has been held by the National Party (previously known as the Country Party) and its predecessors since 1919. Its most prominent member has been Sir Earle Page, former leader of the Country Party and interim Prime Minister of Australia in 1939. He represented Cowper from 1919 to 1961, longer than any other MP who represented one seat for his entire career. It has usually been a fairly safe National Party seat, and became more so when its more urbanised area (including Page&#x27;s hometown of Grafton) was shifted to the newly created Division of Page in 1984.

The division is located on the north coast of New South Wales, and on its current boundaries takes in the towns of Coffs Harbour, Port Macquarie, Kempsey, Macksville and Nambucca Heads.

In February 2016, New South Wales federal electoral districts were redistributed. The northern parts of Cowper, from Sapphire Beach to Red Rock were shifted to the division of Page. Since the 2019 election, the member for Cowper has been Pat Conaghan, representing the National Party of Australia.

<text>Heinrich Wölfflin (; 21 June 1864 – 19 July 1945) was a Swiss art historian, esthetician and educator, whose objective classifying principles (&quot;painterly&quot; vs. &quot;linear&quot; and the like) were influential in the development of formal analysis in art history in the early 20th century. He taught at Basel, Berlin and Munich in the generation that saw German art history&#x27;s rise to pre-eminence. His three most important books, still consulted, are &quot;Renaissance und Barock&quot; (1888), &quot;Die Klassische Kunst&quot; (1898, &quot;Classic Art&quot;), and &quot;Kunstgeschichtliche Grundbegriffe&quot; (1915, &quot;Principles of Art History&quot;). 

Wölfflin taught at Berlin University from 1901 to 1912, at Munich University from 1912 to 1924, and at University of Zurich from 1924 until his retirement.

== Origins and career ==
Wölfflin was born in Winterthur, Switzerland. His father, Eduard Wölfflin, was a professor of classical philology who taught at the Munich university and helped to found and organize the &quot;Thesaurus Linguae Latinae&quot;. The younger Wölfflin studied art history and history with Jakob Burckhardt at the University of Basel, philosophy with Wilhelm Dilthey at Berlin University, and art history and philosophy at Munich. He received his doctoral degree from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in 1886 in philosophy, although he was already on a course to study the newly minted discipline of art history.

Wölfflin&#x27;s principal philosophy mentor at the University of Munich, where Wölfflin earned his doctoral degree, was the renowned professor of archaeology Heinrich Brunn. Greatly influenced by his mentors, particularly neo-Kantian Johannes Volkelt (&quot;Der Symbolbegriff&quot;) and Brunn, Wölfflin&#x27;s own dissertation, &quot;Prolegomena zu einer Psychologie der Architektur&quot; (1886), already showed the approach that he was later to develop and perfect: an analysis of form based on a psychological interpretation of the creative process. It is considered now to be one of the founding texts of the emerging discipline of art history, although it was barely noted when it was published. 

After graduating in 1886, Wölfflin published the result of a years&#x27; travel and study in Italy, as his &quot;Renaissance und Barock&quot; (1888), already showed the approach that he was later to develop and perfect, he pursued his method in books on the Renaissance and Baroque periods. For Wölfflin, the 16th-century art now described as &quot;Mannerist&quot; was part of the Baroque aesthetic, one that Burckhardt before him as well as most French and English-speaking scholars for a generation after him dismissed as degenerate. On the death of Jacob Burckhardt in 1897 Wöllflin succeeded him in the Art History Chair at Basel. He is credited with having introduced the teaching method of using twin parallel projectors in the delivery of art history lectures, so that images could be compared when magic lanterns became less dangerous. Sir Ernst Gombrich recalled being inspired by him, as well as the noted art historian Erwin Panofsky. 

Notable students of Wölfflin included Frederick Antal, Paul Frankl, Carola Giedion-Welcker, Richard Krautheimer, Kurt Martin, Jakob Rosenberg, Fritz Saxl, Bruno E. Werner, and Klara Steinweg.

== &quot;Principles of Art History&quot; ==
In &quot;Principles of Art History&quot;, Wölfflin formulated five pairs of opposed or contrary precepts in the form and style of art of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries which demonstrated a shift in the nature of artistic vision between the two periods. These were:
# From linear (draughtsmanship, plastic, relating to contour in projected ideation of objects) to painterly (&quot;malerisch&quot;: tactile, observing patches or systems of relative light and of non-local colour within shade, making shadow and light integral, and allowing them to replace or supersede the dominance of contours as fixed boundaries.)
# From plane to recession: (from the &#x27;Will to the plane&#x27;, which orders the picture in strata parallel to the picture plane, to planes made inapparent by emphasising the forward and backward relations and engaging the spectator in recessions.)
# From closed (tectonic) form to open (a-tectonic) form (The closed or tectonic form is the composition which is a self-contained entity which everywhere points back to itself, the typical form of ceremonial style as the revelation of law, generally within predominantly vertical and horizontal oppositions; the open or atectonic form compresses energies and angles or lines of motion which everywhere reach out beyond the composition, and override the horizontal and vertical structure, though naturally bound together by hidden rules which allow the composition to be self-contained.)
# From multiplicity to unity: (&#x27;Classic art achieves its unity by making the parts independent as free members, and the baroque abolishes the uniform independence of the parts in favour of a more unified total motive. In the former case, co-ordination of the accents; in the latter, subordination.&#x27; The multiple details of the former are each uniquely contemplated: the multiplicity of the latter serves to diminish the dominance of line, and to enhance the unification of the multifarious whole.)
# From absolute clarity to relative clarity of the subject: (i.e. from the exhaustive revelation of the form of the subject to a pictorial representation which deliberately evades objective clearness in order to deliver a perfect rendering of information or pictorial appearance obtained by other painterly means.

Wölfflin was following in the footsteps of Vasari, among others, in devising a method for distinguishing the development in style over time. He applied this method to Trecento, Quattrocento and Cinquecento art in &quot;Classic Art&quot; (1899), then developed it further in &quot;The Principles of Art History&quot; (1915). Wolfflin&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Art History&quot; has recently become more influential among art historians and philosophers of art. The &quot;Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism&quot; published a special issue commemorating the 100th anniversary of the publication of the &quot;Principles&quot; in 2015, edited by Bence Nanay.

== Impact and reception ==
&quot;Heinrich Wölfflin, perhaps the most important art historian of his generation, was so receptive to the aesthetic purism prevailing at the time that he developed a technique of dissociation that was as extreme as the Remy de Gourmont.&quot;

– Edgar Wind, &quot;Art and Anarchy&quot;, Suhrkamp Taschenbuch Wissenschaft No. 1163, Frankfurt am Main, 1994, p 27The legacy of Wölfflin&#x27;s &quot;Principles&quot; upon international scholarship and the teaching of the history of art was examined as the subject of a symposium at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts in 2015.

<text>Julien Benda (; 26 December 1867 – 7 June 1956) was a French philosopher and novelist, known as an essayist and cultural critic. He is best known for his short book, &quot;La Trahison des Clercs&quot; from 1927 (&quot;The Treason of the Intellectuals&quot; or &quot;The Betrayal by the Intellectuals&quot;).

== Life ==
Born into a Jewish family in Paris, Benda had a secular upbringing. He was educated at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. After a period at the École Centrale Paris, he turned to history, and graduated at the Sorbonne in 1894.

His father&#x27;s death in 1889 left Benda independently wealthy. He wrote for &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot; from 1891 to 1903. His articles on the Dreyfus affair were collected and published as &quot;Dialogues&quot;. He disagreed strongly with Henri Bergson, the leading light of French philosophy of his day, and launched an attack on him in 1911, when Bergson&#x27;s reputation was at its height.

In July 1937 he attended the Second International Writers&#x27; Congress, the purpose of which was to discuss the attitude of intellectuals to the war in Spain, held in Valencia, Barcelona and Madrid and attended by many writers including André Malraux, Ernest Hemingway, Stephen Spender and Pablo Neruda.

Benda survived the German occupation of France and the Vichy regime 1940–1944, in Carcassonne. The journal of Jean Guéhenno described his life there, and his character: &quot;Unbearable, yet likeable.&quot; He died in Fontenay-aux-Roses, on 7 June 1956.

==Works==
Benda is considered to be primarily an essayist. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. His single nomination for the Goncourt Prize was in 1912 for &quot;L&#x27;Ordination&quot;. He lost out to André Savignon&#x27;s novel &quot;Les filles de la pluie&quot;. Voting was tied, and the casting vote went to Léon Hennique, in a notorious election that caused Hennique to give up the presidency of the Académie Goncourt.

===&quot;La Trahison des Clercs&quot;===

Benda is now best remembered for his short 1927 book &quot;La Trahison des Clercs&quot;, a work of considerable influence. It was translated into English in 1928 by Richard Aldington; the U.S. edition was titled &quot;The Treason of the Intellectuals&quot;, while the British edition was titled &quot;The Great Betrayal.&quot; Aldington&#x27;s translation was republished in 2006 as &quot;The Treason of the Intellectuals&quot;, with a new introduction by Roger Kimball. This polemical essay argued that European intellectuals in the 19th and 20th centuries had often lost the ability to reason dispassionately about political and military matters, instead becoming apologists for crass nationalism, warmongering, and racism. Benda reserved his harshest criticisms for his fellow Frenchmen Charles Maurras and Maurice Barrès. Benda defended the measured and dispassionate outlook of classical civilization and the internationalism of traditional Christianity.

Closing this work, Benda darkly predicts that the augmentation of the &quot;realistic&quot; impulse to domination of the material world, justified by intellectuals into an &quot;integral realism,&quot; risked producing an all-encompassing species-wide civilization that would completely cease &quot;to situate the good outside the real world.&quot; Human aspirations, specifically after power, would become the sole end of society. In closing, he concludes bitterly, &quot;And History will smile to think that this is the species for which Socrates and Jesus Christ died.&quot;

Benda&#x27;s word &quot;clercs&quot; was borrowed by Anne Appelbaum in her 2020 book &quot;Twilight of Democracy: The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism&quot;.

===Other works===
Other works by Benda include &quot;Belphégor&quot; (1918), &quot;Uriel&#x27;s Report&quot; (1926), and &quot;Exercises of a Man Buried Alive&quot; (1947), an attack on the contemporary French celebrities of his time. Most of the titles in the bibliography below were published during the last three decades of Benda&#x27;s long life; he is emphatically a 20th-century author.

In his 1933 publication &quot;Discours à la nation européenne,&quot; Benda responded to Johann Gottlieb Fichte&#x27;s &quot;Addresses to the German Nation&quot;.

<text>The Robert Burns Fellowship is a New Zealand literary residency. Established in 1958 to coincide with bicentennial celebrations of the birth of Robert Burns, it is often claimed to be New Zealand&#x27;s premier literary residency. The list of past fellows includes many of New Zealand&#x27;s most notable 20th and 21st century writers.

==Overview and history==
The fellowship was established in 1958 by an anonymous group of citizens of Dunedin, including notably Charles Brasch and his cousins Esmond, Dora and Mary de Beer. Its purpose is &quot;to encourage and promote imaginative New Zealand literature, liberally interpreted to include writers of genres such as literary biography, autobiography and literary criticism&quot;. It marked 200 years since the birth of Robert Burns, and also the service provided by the Burns family to the development of the Otago region, including Thomas Burns who was a nephew of the poet. It was the first literary fellowship in New Zealand.

Michael King, who received the fellowship in 1998, said at the time: &quot;If the Burns Fellowship did not exist, New Zealand literature might be a decade or so behind the place where it is now. Some things simply wouldn&#x27;t have been written.&quot; As an example, he noted that Janet Frame, one of New Zealand&#x27;s best-known authors, was only able to stay in New Zealand and continue to write because of the resources provided by the fellowship.

The fellowship is based at the University of Otago. It provides a stipend to recipients for between six months to a year, as well as an office on campus.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the fellowship, a collection titled &quot;Nurse to the Imagination: Fifty years of the Robert Burns Fellowship&quot; was launched in October 2008, along with commemorations to coincide with Dunedin&#x27;s 2008 Arts Festival.

<doc id="1078075" wikidata="Q544812" url="?curid=1078075" title="WavPack">
<text>WavPack is a free and open-source lossless audio compression format and application implementing the format. It is unique in the way that it supports hybrid audio compression alongside normal compression which is similar to how FLAC works. It also supports compressing a wide variety of lossless formats, including various variants of PCM and also DSD as used in SACDs, together with its support for surround audio.

==Features==
WavPack compression can compress (and losslessly restore) 8, 16, 24, and 32-bit fixed-point, and 32-bit floating-point PCM audio files in the .WAV file format. It can also handle DSD input in DSDIFF or DSF format. It also supports surround sound streams and high sampling rates. Like other lossless compression schemes, the data reduction rate varies with the source, but it is generally between 30% and 70% for typical popular music and somewhat better than that for classical music and other sources with greater dynamic range.

===Hybrid mode===
WavPack also incorporates a &quot;hybrid&quot; mode, which still provides the features of lossless compression, but creates two files: a relatively small, high-quality, lossy file (.wv) that can be used by itself; and a &quot;correction&quot; file (.wvc) that, when combined with the lossy file, provides full lossless restoration. This allows the use of lossy and lossless codecs together. The lossy algorithm is similar to ADPCM.

Hybrid mode can handle floating-point data, but only when &quot;exception&quot; values like infinities or NaNs are not present. It cannot handle DSD because there is no lossy algorithm for DSD.

A similar &quot;hybrid&quot; feature is also offered by OptimFROG DualStream, MPEG-4 SLS and DTS-HD Master Audio.

===Summary===
* Open-source, released under a BSD-like license
* Multiplatform
* Error robustness
* Fast encoding
* Higher compression ratios than other widely used (FLAC/ALAC) open-source lossless audio codecs
* Streaming support
* Supports multichannel audio and high resolutions
* Native support in WavPack 5.x for compressing Direct Stream Digital without converting the source file to PCM.
* Hybrid/lossy mode
* Hardware support (provided by Rockbox firmware)
* Metadata support (ID3, APE tags; APE tag is the preferred format)
* Supports RIFF chunks
* Compatible with ReplayGain
* Ability to create self-extracting files for the Win32 platform
* Supports 32-bit floating-point streams
* Supports embedded CUE sheets
* Includes MD5 hashes for quick integrity checking
* Can encode in both symmetrical and asymmetrical (slower encoding to speed up decoding) modes

==History==
David Bryant started development on WavPack in mid-1998 with the release of version 1.0 (1998-08-15). This first version compressed and decompressed audio losslessly, and it already featured one of the best efficiency vs. speed ratios among lossless encoders.

Very soon after the release of version 1.0, v. 2.0 (2 September 1998) was released, featuring lossy encoding (using only quantization of prediction residue for data reduction no psychoacoustic masking model was applied to the stream).

In 1999, version 3.0 (12 September 1999) was released, with a new &quot;fast mode&quot; (albeit with reduced compression ratio), compression of raw (headerless) PCM audio files, and error detection using a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check.

A feature added in late 3.x versions is the &quot;hybrid&quot; mode where the encoder generates a lossy file and a correction file such that both can be decompressed back to a PCM stream that has same quality as the original.

In WavPack 4, a new file format structure is introduced. A &quot;roadmap&quot; is also published by the author with 4.40, containing possible hints on future development. WavPack 5 introduced support for compressing DSD.

==Support==
===Software===
Some software supports the format natively (like DeaDBeeF, foobar2000, and Jack! The Knife), while others require plugins. The official WavPack website offers plugins for Winamp, Nero Burning ROM, MediaChest 2.1, and several other applications, as well as a DirectShow filter. dBpoweramp CD-Ripper, by the author of foobar2000, as well as foobar2000 itself, and Asunder allow ripping Audio CDs directly into Wavpack files.

Linux support is available with a native port.

FFmpeg has a native WavPack encoder, which may be combined with software like GNU parallel to use multiple CPU cores to quickly transcode other lossless formats into WavPack, and from WavPack to any format that FFmpeg supports, without the need for additional software. However, FFMpeg&#x27;s encoder is somewhat limited. 

As of 2023, FFmpeg&#x27;s WavPack encoder has some considerable limitations. It can only produce version 4 bitstreams, which do not support fast verification for file integrity checks, or more than 16 channels. It will also discard RIFF chunks and may not behave predictably with 24-bit input. It also defaults to less than optimal compression to achieve faster encoding. Due to lack of support for Hybrid mode, FFmpeg-based playback software will fail to consider the .wvc correction file if there is one present, and will play or transcode only the lossy section. (However, this is not the usual mode of operation for WavPack.) As native Wavpack support for Direct Stream Digital was added in version 5 of the reference encoder, FFmpeg WavPack also is limited to encoding PCM input.

===Hardware===
Native support:
* Cowon A3 PMP supports WavPack out of the box.

Non-native support:
* Apple iPod range of music players do not support WavPack out of the box, but can through open-source Rockbox firmware.
* iRiver H100 series, through open-source Rockbox firmware.
* iRiver H300 series, through open-source Rockbox firmware.
* Android smartphones and tablets with the installation of third-party media-player software.
* ChromeOS devices using media-player software installed in the Linux subsystem or the Android Play Store.
The WavPack website also includes a plugin that allows support for the format on the Roku PhotoBridge HD .

==Technology==
To ensure high-speed operation, WavPack uses a predictor that is implemented entirely in integer math. In its &quot;fast&quot; mode the prediction is simply the arithmetic extrapolation of the previous two samples. For example, if the previous two samples were −10 and 20, then the prediction would be 50. For the default mode a simple adaptive factor is added to weigh the influence of the earlier sample on the prediction. In the example above the resulting prediction could then vary between 20 for no influence to 50 for full influence. This weight factor is constantly updated based on the audio data&#x27;s changing spectral characteristics.

The prediction generated is then subtracted from the actual sample to be encoded to generate the error value. In mono mode this value is sent directly to the coder. However, stereo signals tend to have some correlation between the two channels that can be further exploited. Therefore, two error values are calculated that represent the difference and average of the left and right error values. In the &quot;fast&quot; mode of operation these two new values are simply sent to the coder instead of the left and right values. In the default mode, the difference value is always sent to the coder along with one of the other three values (average, left, or right). An adaptive algorithm continuously determines the most efficient of the three to send based on the changing balance of the channels.

Instead of Rice coding, a special data encoder for WavPack is used. Rice coding is the optimal bit coding for this type of data, and WavPack&#x27;s encoder is less efficient, but only by about 0.15 bits per sample (or less than 1% for 16-bit data). However, there are some advantages in exchange. The first one is that WavPack&#x27;s encoder does not require the data to be buffered ahead of encoding; instead it converts each sample directly to bitcodes. This is more computationally efficient and is better in some applications where coding delay is critical. The second advantage is that it is easily adaptable to lossy encoding, since all significant bits (except the implied &quot;one&quot; MSB) are transmitted directly. In this way it is possible to only transmit, for example, the 3 most significant bits (with sign) of each sample. In fact, it is possible to transmit only the sign and implied MSB for each sample with an average of only 3.65 bits per sample.

This coding scheme is used to implement the &quot;lossy&quot; mode of WavPack. In the &quot;fast&quot; mode the output of the non-adaptive decorrelator is simply rounded to the nearest codable value for the specified number of bits. In the default mode the adaptive decorrelator is used (which reduces the average noise about 1 dB), and both the current and the next sample are considered in choosing the better of the two available codes (which reduces noise another 1 dB).

No floating-point arithmetic is used in WavPack&#x27;s data path because, according to the author, integer operations are less susceptible to subtle chip-to-chip variations that could corrupt the lossless nature of the compression (the Pentium floating-point bug being an example). It is possible that a lossless compressor that used floating-point math could generate different output when running on that faulty Pentium. Even disregarding actual bugs, floating-point math is complicated enough that there could be subtle differences between &quot;correct&quot; implementations that could cause trouble for this type of application. A 32-bit error detection code to the generated streams is included to maintain user confidence in the integrity of WavPack&#x27;s compression.

WavPack source code is portable and has been compiled on several Unix and Unix-like operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Compaq Tru64, HP-UX...) as well as Windows, DOS, Palm OS, and OpenVMS. It works on many architectures, including x86, ARM, PowerPC, AMD64, IA-64, SPARC, Alpha, PA-RISC, MIPS and Motorola 68k.

A cut-down version of WavPack was developed for the Texas Instruments TMS320 series Digital Signal Processor. This was aimed predominantly at encouraging manufacturers to incorporate WavPack compression (and de-compression) into portable memory audio recorders. This version supported features that were applicable only to embedded applications (stream compression in real-time, selectable compression rate) and dropped off features that only applied to full computer systems (self extraction, high compression modes, 32-bit floats). The TMS320 series DSPs are native integer devices, and support WavPack well. Some &quot;special&quot; features of the full WavPack software were included (ability to generate a correction &quot;file&quot; (stream), for example), and others were excluded. The port was based on version 4.

WavPack support was added to WinZip starting with version 11.0 beta, released in October 2006. This extension to the ZIP file format was included by PKWARE, the maintainers of the format, in the official description file starting with version 6.3.2, released on 28 September 2007.

<text>The Division of Cunningham is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

On 10 October, 2024, the Australian Electoral Commission announced the division of Cunningham will expand to include Primbee, Windang, Cringila, Berkeley as well as the rest of Unanderra and Lake Heights at the 2025 federal election.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named for Allan Cunningham, a 19th-century explorer of New South Wales and Queensland.

The division has always been represented by the Australian Labor Party, except following the 2002 by-election when the Greens won the seat; being the first time that the Greens held a seat in the House of Representatives. Labor recovered the seat at the 2004 federal election. 

Its most prominent members have been Rex Connor, a senior minister in the Whitlam government, and Stephen Martin, who was Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 1993–1996, during the last term of the Keating government. The sitting member is Alison Byrnes who was elected in the 2022 federal election as a member of the Australian Labor Party.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is located on the coast of New South Wales between southern Sydney and Wollongong. It takes in the northern portion of Wollongong, including Corrimal, Figtree and Unanderra. It also includes several of Sydney&#x27;s outer southern suburbs, including Heathcote and Bundeena. The division covers areas east of the Illawarra escarpment and is bounded by the Tasman Sea to the east. It is bounded to the north by the Royal National Park and to the south by the Wollongong suburbs of Figtree, Cordeaux Heights and Coniston. Although the region is primarily rural, the vast majority of the population is located in the northern outskirts of Wollongong and along the eastern seaboard. The main products and means of livelihood in the area are tourism, tertiary education, steel production, coal mining, brick manufacturing, textiles and dairy farming.

<doc id="1078086" wikidata="Q3238392" url="?curid=1078086" title="Lifehouse (rock opera)">
<text>Lifehouse is an unfinished science fiction rock opera by the Who intended as a follow-up to &quot;Tommy&quot;. It was abandoned as a rock opera in favour of creating the traditional rock album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, though its songs would appear on various albums and singles by the Who, as well as Pete Townshend solo albums. In 1978, aspects of the Lifehouse project were revisited by the Who on &quot;Who Are You&quot;. In 2000, Townshend revived the Lifehouse concept with his set &quot;Lifehouse Chronicles&quot; and the sampler &quot;Lifehouse Elements&quot;. On 1 May 2007, he released an online software called &quot;The Lifehouse Method&quot; in which any &quot;sitter&quot; could create a musical &quot;portrait&quot;. The site is now defunct. The artwork and design of the box set was undertaken by designer Laurence Sutherland. 

==Original concept==

&quot;Lifehouse&quot;&#x27;s story was inspired by Pete Townshend&#x27;s experiences on the Tommy Tour: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen moments in Who gigs where the vibrations were becoming so pure that I thought the whole world was just going to stop, the whole thing was just becoming so unified.&quot; He believed that the vibrations could become so pure that the audience would &quot;dance themselves into oblivion&quot;. Their souls would leave their bodies and they would be in a type of heaven; a permanent state of ecstasy. The only reason this did not happen at Who gigs was because there was a knowledge in the listener&#x27;s mind that the show would end and everyone would wake up and go to work the next morning. These ideas were directly linked to the writing of philosopher Inayat Khan, a Sufi musician who had written about the connection of vibration and sound with the human spirit. Another source of inspiration for Townshend was Meher Baba, who claimed to be an avatar of Brahman.

What Townshend was aiming to achieve in &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was to write music that could be adapted to reflect the personalities of the audience. To do this he wanted to adapt his newly acquired hardware, VCS3 and ARP synthesisers and a four-channel quadraphonic PA system, to create a machine capable of generating and combining personal music themes written from computerised biographical data. Ultimately, these thematic components would merge to form a &quot;universal chord&quot;. To help this process, the Who would encourage individuals to emerge from the audience and find a role in the music.

==The Lifehouse concept==

&quot;Lifehouse&quot; began as a story written around several songs. According to Pete Townshend: &quot;The essence of the story-line was a kind a futuristic scene...It&#x27;s a fantasy set at a time when rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll didn&#x27;t exist. The world was completely collapsing and the only experience that anybody ever had was through test tubes. In a way they lived as if they were on television. Everything was programmed. The enemies were people who gave us entertainment intravenously, and the heroes were savages who&#x27;d kept rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as a primitive force and had gone to live with it in the woods. The story was about these two sides coming together and having a brief battle.&quot;

Under those circumstances, a very old guru figure emerges and says, &#x27;I remember rock music. It was absolutely amazing—it really did something to people.&#x27; He spoke of a kind of nirvana people reached through listening to this type of music. The old man decides that he is going to try to set it up so that the effect can be experienced eternally. Everybody would be snapped out of their programmed environment through this rock and roll-induced liberated selflessness. The Lifehouse was where the music was played, and where the young people would collect to discover rock music as a powerful catalyst — a religion as it were. &quot;Then I began to feel &#x27;Well, why just simulate it? Why not try and make it happen?&#x27;&quot;

The plan was for the Who to take over the Young Vic theatre with a regular audience, develop the new material on stage and allow the communal activity to influence the songs and performances. Individuals would emerge from the audience and find a role in the music and the film. When the concerts became strong enough, they would be filmed along with other peripheral activity from the theater. A storyline would evolve alongside the music. Although the finished film was to have many fictitious and scripted elements, the concert footage was to be authentic, and would provide the driving force for the whole production.

Townshend went wild, working out a complex scenario whereby a personal profile of each concertgoer would be compiled, from the individual&#x27;s astrological chart to his hobbies, even physical appearance. All the characteristics would then be fed into a computer at the same moment, leading to one musical note culminating in mass nirvana that Townshend dubbed &#x27;a kind of celestial cacophony.&#x27; This philosophy was based on the writings of Inayat Khan, a Sufi master musician who espoused the theory that matter produces heat, light, and sound in the form of unique vibrations. Taking the idea one step further, making music, which was composed of vibrations, was the pervading force of all life. Elevating its purpose to the highest level, music represented the path to restoration, the search for the one perfect universal note, which once sounded would bring harmony to the entire world. Despite Townshend&#x27;s grandiose plans, the project had its problems. The theater had its own schedule of drama productions, and was not available on a regular nightly schedule that Townshend insisted was necessary for the band to sustain a &quot;euphoric level&quot; of performance. Townshend: &quot;The fatal flaw...was getting obsessed with trying to make a fantasy a reality rather than letting the film speak for itself.&quot; Eventually Townshend had to let go of &quot;Lifehouse&quot; for his own sake.

Townshend&#x27;s inability to translate the ideas in his head to those around him eventually led to a nervous breakdown. &quot;It was a disaster.&quot; No one apart from himself actually understood the whole concept of &quot;Lifehouse&quot;. Even John Entwistle believed that the band were to actually stay at the Young Vic with the audience in a sort of commune. Kit Lambert, an integral part of the communication between the members of the Who, was missing. Townshend had rejected a &quot;Tommy&quot; film script written by Lambert, and later found out that he had told Universal Pictures (to whom Townshend had spoken regarding the making of the film) that &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was actually a new version of &quot;Tommy&quot;. Lambert, dejected, frustrated and hurt, had moved to New York. With &quot;Tommy&quot;, Lambert had served as Townshend’s &quot;interpreter&quot;, explaining &quot;to the willing but befuddled people around me what I was on about.&quot; The film was indefinitely postponed until the album had been issued. The band went to Glyn Johns to produce their collection of songs, intended for a double album. They decided to shelve most of the songs in favour of a single album, hoping that it would have &quot;a sharper focus and greater impact&quot; than the concept of &quot;Lifehouse&quot; had become. In August 1978 Keith Moon said the band intended to make a &quot;Lifehouse&quot; film after the film version of &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; had been completed. In his 2012 memoir &quot;Who I Am&quot;, Pete Townshend makes reference to discussions in 1980 with director Nicolas Roeg to develop a film version of &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, implying that the project fell apart after Roeg learned Townshend made a pass at actress Theresa Russell, Roeg&#x27;s partner at the time.

Townshend also revisited the concept, in modified form, in his radio play and recording &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;, which incorporated outtakes from the &quot;Lifehouse&quot;/&quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; sessions and demos. In the plot of &quot;Psychoderelict&quot;, a reclusive rock star named Ray High is lured out of retirement by a fan-letter hoax between his manager and a gossip columnist, ultimately staging and broadcasting a virtual reality concert similar to the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; climax. He continued discussion of these themes in his later opus &quot;The Boy Who Heard Music&quot;.

In April 2019 it was announced that a graphic novel based on the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; concept was in production, with a scheduled release date of July 2020. The graphic novel is scheduled to be released on 15 September 2023, as part of a Who&#x27;s Next re-release box set.

==Plot summary==

&quot;Lifehouse&quot; has several variations in its storyline:

===1971 version===
In the world in which the album is set, pollution is so bad that the populace are forced to wear Lifesuits, suits that could simulate all experiences in a way that no one would have to leave home.

The suits are plugged into a huge mainframe called the Grid which also contains tubes for sleeping gas, food, and entertainment; supposedly, someone could live out tens of thousands of lifetimes in a very short period within the Grid. The Grid is controlled by a man named Jumbo.

The story begins when a farming family in Scotland hear of a huge rock concert called Lifehouse occurring in London, a sort of post-apocalyptic Woodstock. Their daughter, Mary, runs away to join the concert. They don&#x27;t wear Lifesuits because they are supposedly out of the pollution&#x27;s range and they farm the crops that the government buys to feed the Lifesuiters. Bobby is the creator of Lifehouse. (&quot;Bobby&quot; was also the tentative name of the project for a time.) He is a hacker who broadcasts pirate radio signals advertising his concert, where the participants&#x27; personal data are taken from them and converted into music, quite literally &quot;finding your song&quot;. At the climax of the album, the authorities have surrounded the Lifehouse; then the perfect note rings forth through the combination of everybody&#x27;s songs, they storm the place to find everybody has disappeared through a sort of musical Rapture, and the people observing the concert through their Lifesuits have vanished as well.

===1972 additions===

In 1972, at Daltrey&#x27;s suggestion, Townshend wrote new songs related to the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; plot line. These songs included &quot;Relay&quot;, &quot;Join Together&quot;, and &quot;Put the Money Down&quot;. Also three songs were apparently recorded for inclusion on the unfinished followup to &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, titled &quot;Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!&quot; Instead, the band released &quot;Relay&quot; and &quot;Join Together&quot; as singles that year. &quot;Put the Money Down&quot; was not completed until 1974, when it was released on the outtakes and rarities compilation, &quot;Odds &amp; Sods&quot;.

===1978 version===
Set two hundred years after the events in the &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; version, this tells the story of another attempt at a Lifehouse concert. The concert holders are helped by &quot;muso&quot;, a cult that worships music, and are hated by Plusbond, the group that runs the Grid and the Lifesuits.

===1999 radio play version===
Ray and Sally are farmers who grow, as Sally said, &quot;dead potatoes&quot;. Their daughter, Mary, runs away from home to visit a hacker who has fascinated her with pirated radio advertisements. Ray goes to try to find his lost child and along the way he meets his childhood self, Rayboy, and his imaginary friend, the caretaker.

===2023 graphic novel version===

In 2023 a graphic novel of the story was released. It features a far more apocalyptic storyline, where a tyrannical government is overseen by Jumbo 7, who bans music and plans to use a &quot;silver child&quot; named Valentina to weaponize sound. Mary awakens from &quot;grid-sleep&quot; and finds the Lifehouse, where she learns about music from a guru-like musician and hacker named Bobby and leads the concert. It features a much darker ending than any of the other versions.

==Radio play==

Pete Townshend, along with playwright Jeff Young, completed a musical radio play script of &quot;Lifehouse&quot; as a collaboration between BBC Radio Drama and Eel Pie, Townshend&#x27;s publishing company. The recorded version of this script is available on &quot;Lifehouse Chronicles&quot;, and the text is available as a Simon &amp; Schuster Pocket Books, First Edition 1999.

The book contains the unedited radio play script of &quot;Lifehouse&quot; as well as an introduction by Townshend. The first broadcast of the radio play took place on 5 December 1999 on BBC Radio 3.

<text>Patricia Nead Elrod (born 1954) is an American novelist specializing in urban fantasy. She has written in the mystery, romance, paranormal, and historical genres with at least one foray into comedic fantasy. Elrod is also an editor, having worked on several collections for Ace Science Fiction, DAW, Benbella Books, and St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin. She self-published a signed, limited edition novel under her own imprint, Vampwriter Books.

In 2010, she was nominated for the &quot;RT Book Reviews&quot; Career Achievement Award in Urban Fantasy.

In 2011, she was presented with the &quot;RT Book Reviews&quot; Pioneer Achievement Award in Vampire Fiction.

Her suspense short story, &quot;Beach Girl,&quot; won the 2011 &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; Readers Choice Award.

==Overview==
P. N. Elrod&#x27;s start in professional publishing began at TSR writing gaming modules. She has published more than twenty-five novels, beginning in 1990 with her &quot;Vampire Files&quot; urban fantasy series, featuring hard-boiled private investigator Jack Fleming and his partner, Charles Escott, girlfriend, Bobbi Smythe, and other recurring characters. The 12 books and counting are set in 1930s Chicago. Jack&#x27;s first case was solving his own murder.

Next came the &quot;Jonathan Barrett, Gentleman Vampire&quot; series, set during the American Revolution. The twist on these historicals is that Barrett and his family are on the side of the British throughout the revolution, offering a unique point of view of the times.

Another series co-authored with actor Nigel Bennett, who played the evil yet seductive LaCroix on the television show &quot;Forever Knight&quot;, is of a very different character, but still features a good guy vampire. The three book &quot;Lord Richard, Vampire&quot; series from Baen Books are set in a different universe than the &quot;Files&quot; &amp; &quot;Barrett&quot; books, but this &quot;James Bond with fangs&quot; maintains Elrod&#x27;s premise that there are different breeds of vampires co-existing out there.

Using this premise, she has linked her universe to that of Bram Stoker with her sequel to Dracula, &quot;Quincey Morris, Vampire&quot;. Quincey was killed at the end of &quot;Dracula&quot;, but is resurrected as a vampire himself, albeit a different breed than the infamous count. Lord Richard makes a brief cameo appearance in the story, and Morris&#x27; vampiric state is attributed to a previous blood-sharing with Nora Jones from Elrod&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Barrett&quot; series.

Also quite different, and qualifying as horror, are the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-related books in the Ravenloft world featuring the dark and sinister vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich. These books, &quot;I, Strahd: Memoirs of a Vampire&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;I, Strahd: The War With Azalin&quot;, have garnered her critical acclaim from mainstream reviewers.

With &quot;The Adventures of Myhr&quot; she broke into the humorous fantasy genre. Myhr is half-man, half-cat and all adventure, magically jumping from world to world spreading the good news about pizza and Beatles karaoke. His partner is a cranky wizard fond of techno raves and obscene T-shirt art.

Elrod has authored around two dozen short stories in the fantasy, romance, science fiction, mystery, and horror genres, and edited several collections including &quot;Time of the Vampires&quot;, &quot;Dracula in London&quot;, and with Roxanne Conrad (aka Rachel Caine) &quot;Stepping Through the Stargate: The Science, Archaeology, and Military of Stargate SG-1&quot; The latter is non-fiction and has contributions from world-famous scientists, doctors, the USAF military, FX wizards, and actors from the TV series.

In 2006, she edited an anthology of supernatural romance stories, &quot;My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding&quot;, which made the &quot;USA Today&quot; Bestseller list, and won the 2006 P.E.A.R.L. Awards for best anthology.

She followed it with &quot;My Big Fat Supernatural Honeymoon&quot;, released in January 2008 from St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin. It made the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller extended list and won an honorable mention in the 2007 Pearl Awards for best anthology.

The anthology, &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, from St. Martin&#x27;s, also reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; extended bestseller list in July 2009.

Her collection &quot;Dark and Stormy Knights&quot;, also with St. Martin&#x27;s Griffin, was released in July 2010.

Also sold, a new steampunk series, &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Psychic Service&quot;, to Tor Books in 2010.

In April 2011, Elrod was presented with the RT Book Review&#x27;s &quot;Pioneers of Genre Fiction Award&quot; for &quot;Forging the Way in Vampire Fiction Since 1990.&quot;

Her short story, &quot;Beach Girl&quot;, published in the November 2011 edition of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;, was presented with first place for their annual Readers&#x27; Choice Award.

Her collection, &quot;Hex Symbols&quot;, was released by St. Martin&#x27;s in June 2012.

<text>Dutty Boukman (or Boukman Dutty; died 7 November 1791) was a leader of the Haitian Revolution. Born to a Muslim family in Senegambia (present-day Senegal and Gambia), he was enslaved 
to Jamaica. He eventually ended up in Haiti, where he became a leader of the Maroons and a vodou houngan (priest).

According to some contemporary accounts, Boukman, alongside Cécile Fatiman, a Vodou mambo, presided over the religious ceremony at Bois Caïman, in August 1791, that served as the catalyst to the 1791 slave revolt which is usually considered the beginning of the Haitian Revolution.

Boukman was a key leader of the slave revolt in the Le Cap‑Français region in the north of the colony. He was killed by the French planters and colonial troops on 7 November 1791, just a few months after the beginning of the uprising. The French then publicly displayed Boukman&#x27;s head in an attempt to dispel the aura of invincibility that Boukman had cultivated. The fact that French authorities did this illustrates their belief in the importance Boukman held to Haitian people during this time.

==Background==
In about 1767, Dutty Boukman was born in the region of Senegambia (present-day Senegal and Gambia), where he was a Muslim cleric. He was captured in Senegambia, and transported as a slave to the Caribbean, first to the island of Jamaica, then Saint-Domingue, modern-day Haiti, where he reverted to his indigenous religion and became a Haitian Vodou houngan priest. After he attempted to teach other slaves how to read, he was sold to a French plantation owner and placed as a &quot;commandeur&quot; (slave driver) and, later, a coach driver. His French name came from his English nickname, &quot;Book Man&quot;, which scholars like Sylviane Anna Diouf and Sylviane Kamara have interpreted as having Islamic origins; they note that the term &quot;man of the book&quot; is a synonym for a Muslim in many parts of the world. Laurent Dubois argues that Boukman may have practiced a syncretic blend of traditional African religion and a form of Abrahamic religion.

==Ceremony at the Bois Caïman==
Contemporaneous accounts place the ceremony at Bois Caïman on or about 14 August 1791. Boukman and priestess Cécile Fatiman presided over the last of a series of meetings to organize a slave revolt for weeks in advance; the co-conspirators in attendance included Jean François, Biassou, Jeannot, and others. An animal was sacrificed, an oath was taken, and Boukman gave the following speech:

According to Gothenburg University researcher Markel Thylefors, &quot;The event of the Bois Caïman ceremony forms an important part of Haitian national identity as it relates to the very genesis of Haiti.&quot;

According to the Encyclopedia of African Religion, &quot;Blood from the animal was given in a drink to the attendees to seal their fates in loyalty to the cause of liberation of Saint-Domingue.&quot; A week later, 1800 plantations had been destroyed and 1000 slaveholders killed.
Boukman was not the first to attempt a slave uprising in Saint-Domingue, as he was preceded by others, such as Padrejean in 1676, and François Mackandal in 1757. However, his large size, warrior-like appearance, and fearsome temper made him an effective leader and helped spark the Haitian Revolution.

<doc id="1078092" wikidata="Q907359" url="?curid=1078092" title="Dental restoration">
<text>Dental restoration, dental fillings, or simply fillings are treatments used to restore the function, integrity, and morphology of missing tooth structure resulting from caries or external trauma as well as the replacement of such structure supported by dental implants. They are of two broad types—&quot;direct&quot; and &quot;indirect&quot;—and are further classified by location and size. Root canal therapy, for example, is a restorative technique used to fill the space where the dental pulp normally resides and are more hectic than a normal filling.

== History ==
In Italy evidence dated to the Paleolithic, around 13,000 years ago, points to bitumen used to fill a tooth and in Neolithic Slovenia, 6500 years ago, beeswax was used to close a fracture in a tooth. Graeco-Roman literature, such as Pliny the Elder&#x27;s Naturalis Historia (AD 23–79), contains references to filling materials for hollow teeth.

== Tooth preparation ==
Restoring a tooth to good form and function requires two steps:
# preparing the tooth for placement of restorative material or materials, and
# placement of these materials.
The process of preparation usually involves cutting the tooth with a rotary dental handpiece and dental burrs, a dental laser, or through air abrasion (or in the case of atraumatic restorative treatment, hand instruments), to make space for the planned restorative materials and to remove any dental decay or portions of the tooth that are structurally unsound. If permanent restoration cannot be carried out immediately after tooth preparation, temporary restoration may be performed.

The prepared tooth, ready for placement of restorative materials, is generally called a &quot;tooth preparation&quot;. Materials used may be gold, amalgam, dental composites, glass ionomer cement, or porcelain, among others.

Preparations may be intracoronal or extracoronal. Intracoronal preparations are those which serve to hold restorative material within the confines of the structure of the crown of a tooth. Examples include all classes of cavity preparations for composite or amalgam as well as those for gold and porcelain inlays. Intracoronal preparations are also made as female recipients to receive the male components of removable partial dentures. Extracoronal preparations provide a core or base upon which restorative material will be placed to bring the tooth back into a functional and aesthetic structure. Examples include crowns and onlays, as well as veneers.

In preparing a tooth for a restoration, a number of considerations will determine the type and extent of the preparation. The most important factor to consider is decay. For the most part, the extent of the decay will define the extent of the preparation, and in turn, the subsequent method and appropriate materials for restoration.

Another consideration is unsupported tooth structure. When preparing the tooth to receive a restoration, unsupported enamel is removed to allow for a more predictable restoration. While enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, it is particularly brittle, and unsupported enamel fractures easily.

A systematic review concluded that for decayed baby (primary) teeth, putting an off‐the‐shelf metal crown over the tooth (Hall technique) or only partially removing decay (also referred to as &quot;selective removal&quot;) before placing a filling may be better than the conventional treatment of removing all decay before filling. For decayed adult (permanent) teeth, partial removal (also referred to as &quot;selective removal&quot;) of decay before filling the tooth, or adding a second stage to this treatment where more decay is removed after several months, may be better than conventional treatment.

==Direct restorations==
This technique involves placing a soft or malleable filling into the prepared tooth and building up the tooth. The material is then set hard and the tooth is restored. Where a wall of the tooth is missing and needs to be rebuilt, a matrix should be used before placing the material to recreate the shape of the tooth, so it is cleansable and to prevent the teeth from sticking together. Sectional matrices are generally preferred to circumferential matrices when placing composite restorations in that they favour the formation of a contact point. This is important to reduce patient complaints of food impaction between the teeth. However, sectional matrices can be more technique sensitive to use, so care and skill is required to prevent problems occurring in the final restoration. The advantage of direct restorations is that they are usually set quickly and can be placed in a single procedure. The dentist has a variety of different filling options to choose from. A decision is usually made based on the location and severity of the associated cavity. Since the material is required to set while in contact with the tooth, limited energy (heat) is passed to the tooth from the setting process.

==Indirect restorations==

In this technique the restoration is fabricated outside of the mouth using the dental impressions of the prepared tooth. Common indirect restorations include inlays and onlays, crowns, bridges, and veneers. Usually a dental technician fabricates the indirect restoration from records the dentist has provided. The finished restoration is usually bonded permanently with a dental cement. It is often done in two separate visits to the dentist. Common indirect restorations are done using gold or ceramics.

While the indirect restoration is being prepared, a provisory/temporary restoration is sometimes used to cover the prepared tooth to help maintain the surrounding dental tissues.

Removable dental prostheses (mainly dentures) are sometimes considered a form of indirect dental restoration, as they are made to replace missing teeth. There are numerous types of precision attachments (also known as combined restorations) to aid removable prosthetic attachment to teeth, including magnets, clips, hooks, and implants which may themselves be seen as a form of dental restoration.

The CEREC method is a chairside CAD/CAM restorative procedure. An optical impression of the prepared tooth is taken using a camera. Next, the specific software takes the digital picture and converts it into a 3D virtual model on the computer screen. A ceramic block that matches the tooth shade is placed in the milling machine. An all-ceramic, tooth-colored restoration is finished and ready to bond in place.

Another fabrication method is to import STL and native dental CAD files into CAD/CAM software products that guide the user through the manufacturing process. The software can select the tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of materials, such as titanium and zirconium, and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. In some cases, the intricate nature of some implants requires the use of 5-axis machining methods to reach every part of the job.

== Cavity classifications ==
Greene Vardiman Black classification:

G.V. Black classified the cavities depending on their site:
*Class I Caries affecting pit and fissure, on occlusal, buccal, and lingual surfaces of molars and premolars, and palatal of maxillary incisors.
*Class II Caries affecting proximal surfaces of molars and premolars.
*Class III Caries affecting proximal surfaces of centrals, laterals, and cuspids.
*Class IV Caries affecting proximal including incisal edges of anterior teeth.
*Class V Caries affecting gingival 1/3 of facial or lingual surfaces of anterior or posterior teeth.
*Class VI Caries affecting cusp tips of molars, premolars, and cuspids.

Graham J. Mount&#x27;s classification:

Mount classified cavities depending on their site and size. The proposed classification was designed to simplify the identification of lesions and to define their complexity as they enlarge.

Site:

* Pit/Fissure: 1
* Contact area: 2
* Cervical: 3

Size:

* Minimal: 1
* Moderate: 2
* Enlarged: 3
* Extensive: 4

== Materials used ==
=== Alloys ===
The following casting alloys are mostly used for making crowns, bridges and dentures. Titanium, usually commercially pure but sometimes a 90% alloy, is used as the anchor for dental implants as it is biocompatible and can integrate into bone.

;Precious metallic alloys

*gold (high purity: 99.7%)
*gold alloys (with high gold content)
*gold-platina alloy
*silver-palladium alloy

;Base metallic alloys

*cobalt-chrome alloy
*nickel-chrome alloy

=== Amalgam ===

Amalgams are alloys formed by a reaction between two or more metals, one of which is mercury. It is a hard restorative material and is silvery-grey in colour. One of the oldest direct restorative materials still in use, dental amalgam was widely used in the past with a high degree of success, although recently its popularity has declined due to a number of reasons, including the development of alternative bonded restorative materials, increase in demand for more aesthetic restorations and public perceptions concerning the potential health risks of the material.

The composition of dental amalgam is controlled by the ISO Standard for dental amalgam alloy (ISO 1559). The major components of amalgam are silver, tin and copper. Other metals and small amounts of minor elements such as zinc, mercury, palladium, platinum and indium are also present. Earlier versions of dental amalgams, known as &#x27;conventional&#x27; amalgams consisted of at least 65 wt% silver, 29 wt% tin, and less than 6 wt% copper. Improvements in the understanding of the structure of amalgam post-1986 gave rise to copper-enriched amalgam alloys, which contain between 12 wt% and 30 wt% copper and at least 40 wt% silver. The higher level of copper improved the setting reaction of amalgam, giving greater corrosion resistance and early strength after setting.

Possible indications for amalgam are for load-bearing restorations in medium to large sized cavities in posterior teeth, and in core build-ups when a definitive restoration will be an indirect cast restoration such as a crown or bridge retainer. Contraindications for amalgam are if aesthetics are paramount to patient due to the colour of the material. Amalgams should be avoided if the patient has a history of sensitivity to mercury or other amalgam components. Besides that, amalgam is avoided if there is extensive loss of tooth substance such that a retentive cavity cannot be produced, or if excessive removal of health tooth substance would be required to produce a retentive cavity.

Advantages of amalgam include durability - if placed under ideal conditions, there is evidence of good long term clinical performance of the restorations. Placement time of amalgam is shorter compared to that of composites and the restoration can be completed in a single appointment. The material is also more technique-forgiving compared to composite restorations used for that purpose. Dental amalgam is also radiopaque which is beneficial for differentiating the material between tooth tissues on radiographs for diagnosing secondary caries. The cost of the restoration is typically cheaper than composite restorations.

Disadvantages of amalgam include poor aesthetic qualities due to its colour. Amalgam does not bond to tooth easily, hence it relies on mechanical forms of retention. Examples of this are undercuts, slots/grooves or root canal posts. In some cases this may necessitate excessive amounts of healthy tooth structure to be removed. Hence, alternative resin-based or glass-ionomer cement-based materials are used instead for smaller restorations including pit and small fissure caries. There is also a risk of marginal breakdown in the restorations. This could be due to corrosion which may result in &quot;creep&quot; and &quot;ditching&quot; of the restoration. Creep can be defined as the slow internal stressing and deformation of amalgam under stress. This effect is reduced by incorporating copper into amalgam alloys. Some patients may experience local sensitivity reactions to amalgam.

Although the mercury in cured amalgam is not available as free mercury, concern of its toxicity has existed since the invention of amalgam as a dental material. It is banned or restricted in Norway, Sweden and Finland. See dental amalgam controversy.

=== Direct gold ===

Direct gold fillings were practiced during the times of the Civil War in America. 
Although rarely used today, due to expense and specialized training requirements, gold foil can be used for direct dental restorations.

===Composite resin===

Dental composites, commonly described to patients as &quot;tooth-colored fillings&quot;, are a group of restorative materials used in dentistry. They can be used in direct restorations to fill in the cavities created by dental caries and trauma, minor buildup for restoring tooth wear (non-carious tooth surface loss) and filling in small gaps between teeth (labial veneer). Dental composites are also used as indirect restoration to make crowns and inlays in the laboratory.

These materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix, which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISMA) and urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a comonomer which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a large molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling. Inorganic filler such as silica, quartz or various glasses, are added to reduce polymerization shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm radio-opacity of products due to translucency in property, which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restorations. The filler particles give the composites wear resistance as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, camphorquinone can be excited by visible blue light with critical wavelength of 460-480 nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.

After tooth preparation, a thin primer or bonding agent is used. Modern photo-polymerised composites are applied and cured in relatively thin layers as determined by their opacity. After some curing, the final surface will be shaped and polished.

===Glass ionomer cement===

A glass ionomer cement (GIC) is a class of materials commonly used in dentistry as direct filling materials and/or for luting indirect restorations. GIC can also be placed as a lining material in some restorations for extra protection. These tooth-coloured materials were introduced in 1972 for use as restorative materials for anterior teeth (particularly for eroded areas).

The material consists of two main components: Liquid and powder. The liquid is the acidic component containing polyacrylic acid and tartaric acid (added to control the setting characteristics). The powder is the basic component consisting of sodium alumino-silicate glass. The desirable properties of glass ionomer cements make them useful materials in the restoration of carious lesions in low-stress areas such as smooth-surface and small anterior proximal cavities in primary teeth.

Advantages of using glass ionomer cement:

* The addition of tartaric acid to GIC leads to a shortened setting time, hence providing better handling properties. This makes it easier for the operator to use the material in clinic.
* GIC does not require bond, it can bond to enamel and dentine without the need for use of an intermediate material. Conventional GIC also has a good sealing ability providing little leakage around restoration margins and reducing the risk of secondary caries.
* GIC contains and releases fluoride after being placed therefore it helps in preventing carious lesions in teeth.
* It has good thermal properties as the expansion under stimulus is similar to dentine.
* The material does not contract on setting meaning it is not subject to shrinkage and microleakage.
* GIC is also less susceptible to staining and colour change than composite.

Disadvantages of using Glass ionomer cement:

* GIC have poor wear resistance, they are usually weak after setting and are not stable in water however this improves when time goes on and progression reactions take place. Due to their low strength GICs are not appropriate to be placed in cavities in areas which bear an increase amount of occlusal load or wear.
* The material is susceptible to moisture when it is first placed.
* GIC varies in translucency therefore it can have poor aesthetics, especially noticeable if placed on anterior teeth.

Resin Modified Glass Ionomer

Resin modified glass ionomer was developed to combine the properties of glass ionomer cement with composite technology. It comes in a powder-liquid form. The powder contains fluro-alumino-silicate glass, barium glass (provides radiopacity), potassium persulphate (a redox catalyst to provide resin cure in the dark) and other components such as pigments. The liquid consists of HEMA (water miscible resin), polyacrylic acid (with pendant methacrylate groups) and tartaric acid. This can undergo both acid base and polymerisation reactions. It also has photoinitiators present which enable light curing.

The ionomer has a number of uses in dentistry. It can be applied as fissure sealant, placed in endodontic access cavity as a temporary filling and a luting agent. It can also be used to restore lesions in both primary and permanent dentition. They are easier to use and are a very popular group of materials.

Advantages of using RMGIC:

* Provides a good bond to enamel and dentine.
* It has better physical properties than GIC.
* A Lower solubility in moisture.
* It also releases fluoride over time.
* Provided better translucency and aesthetics as compared to GIC.
* Better handling properties making it easier to use.

Disadvantages of using RMGIC:

* Polymerisation Contraction can cause microleakage around restoration margins
* It has an exothermic setting reaction which can cause potential damage to tooth tissue. 
* The material swells due to uptake of water as HEMA is extremely hydrophilic.
*  Monomer leaching : HEMA is toxic to the pulp therefore it must be polymerised completely.
* The strength of the material reduces if its not light-cured.

GIC and RMGIC are used in dentistry, there will be times when one of these materials is better than the other but that is dependent upon the clinical situation. However, in most cases the ease of use is deciding factor.

=== Compomer ===

Dental compomers are another type of white filling material although their use is not as widespread.

Compomers were formed by modifying dental composites with poly-acid in an effort to combine the desirable properties of dental composites, namely their good aesthetics, and glass ionomer cements, namely their ability to release fluoride over a long time. Whilst this combination of good aesthetics and fluoride release may seem to give compomers a selective advantage, their poor mechanical properties (detailed below) limits their use.

Compomers have a lower wear resistance and a lower compressive, flexural and tensile strength than dental composites, although their wear resistance is greater than resin-modified and conventional glass ionomer cements. Compomers cannot adhere directly to tooth tissue like glass ionomer cements; they require a bonding agent like dental composites.

Compomers may be used as a cavity lining material and a restorative material for non-load bearing cavities. In Paediatric dentistry, they can also be used as a fissure sealant material.

The luting version of compomer may be used to cement cast alloy and ceramic-metal restorations, and to cement orthodontic bands in Paediatric patients. However, compomer luting cement should not be used with all-ceramic crowns.

===Porcelain (ceramics)===

&quot;Full-porcelain&quot; dental materials include dental porcelain (porcelain meaning a high-firing-temperature ceramic), other ceramics, sintered-glass materials, and glass-ceramics as indirect fillings and crowns or metal-free &quot;jacket crowns&quot;. They are also used as inlays, onlays, and aesthetic veneers. A veneer is a very thin shell of porcelain that can replace or cover part of the enamel of the tooth. Full-porcelain restorations are particularly desirable because their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel.

Another type is known as &quot;porcelain-fused-to-metal&quot;, which is used to provide strength to a crown or bridge. These restorations are very strong, durable and resistant to wear, because the combination of porcelain and metal creates a stronger restoration than porcelain used alone.

One of the advantages of computerized dentistry (CAD/CAM technologies) involves the use of machinable ceramics which are sold in a partially sintered, machinable state that is fired again after machining to form a hard ceramic. Some of the materials used are glass-bonded porcelain (Vitablock), lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (a ceramic crystallizing from a glass by special heat treatment), and phase stabilized zirconia (zirconium dioxide, ZrO2). Previous attempts to utilize high-performance ceramics such as zirconium-oxide were thwarted by the fact that this material could not be processed using the traditional methods used in dentistry. Because of its high strength and comparatively much higher fracture toughness, sintered zirconium oxide can be used in posterior crowns and bridges, implant abutments, and root dowel pins. Lithium disilicate (used in the latest Chairside Economical Restoration of Esthetic Ceramics CEREC product) also has the fracture resistance needed for use on molars. Some all-ceramic restorations, such as porcelain-fused-to-alumina set the standard for high aesthetics in dentistry because they are strong and their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel.

Cast metals and porcelain-on-metal were the standard material for crowns and bridges for long time. The full ceramic restorations are now the major choice of patients and are of commonly applied by dentists.

=== Comparison ===
*Composites and amalgam are used mainly for direct restoration. Composites can be made of color matching the tooth, and the surface can be polished after the filling procedure has been completed.
*Amalgam fillings expand with age, possibly cracking the tooth and requiring repair and filling replacement, but chance of leakage of filling is less.
*Composite fillings shrink with age and may pull away from the tooth allowing leakage. If leakage is not noticed early, recurrent decay may occur.
*A 2003 study showed that fillings have a finite lifespan: an average of 12.8 years for amalgam and 7.8 years for composite resins. Fillings fail because of changes in the filling, tooth or the bond between them. Secondary cavity formation can also affect the structural integrity the original filling. Fillings are recommended for small to medium-sized restorations.
* Inlays and onlays are more expensive indirect restoration alternative to direct fillings. They are supposed to be more durable, but long-term studies did not always detect a significantly lower failure rate of ceramic or composite inlays compared to composite direct fillings.
*Porcelain, cobalt-chrome, and gold are used for indirect restorations like crowns and partial coverage crowns (onlays). Traditional porcelains are brittle and are not always recommended for molar restorations. Some hard porcelains cause excessive wear on opposing teeth.

=== Experimental ===
The US National Institute of Dental Research and international organizations as well as commercial suppliers conduct research on new materials. In 2010, researchers reported that they were able to stimulate mineralization of an enamel-like layer of fluorapatite &quot;in vivo&quot;. Filling material that is compatible with pulp tissue has been developed; it could be used where previously a root canal or extraction was required, according to 2016 reports.

== Restoration using dental implants ==
Dental implants are anchors placed in bone, usually made from titanium or titanium alloy. They can support dental restorations which replace missing teeth. Some restorative applications include supporting crowns, bridges, or dental prostheses.

== Complications ==

=== Irritation of the nerve ===
When a deep cavity had been filled, there is a possibility that the nerve may have been irritated. This can result in short term sensitivity to cold and hot substances, and pain when biting down on the specific tooth. It may settle down on its own. If not, then alternative treatment such as root canal treatment may be considered to resolve the pain while keeping the tooth.

=== Weakening of tooth structure ===
In situations where a relatively larger amount of tooth structure has been lost or replaced with a filling material, the overall strength of the tooth may be affected. This significantly increases the risk of the tooth fracturing off in the future when excess force is placed on the tooth, such as trauma or grinding teeth at night, leading to cracked tooth syndrome.

<text>The Division of Dobell () is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

The current MP is Emma McBride, a member of the Australian Labor Party. She has served since 2016.

==History==

The Division of Dobell was created in 1984 and is named in honour of Sir William Dobell, the painter. Dobell was originally a fairly safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, held by Michael Lee, a former minister in the Keating government. The seat was won by the Liberal Party in the 2001 election. The Liberals consolidated their hold on the seat at the 2004 election; however Labor regained the seat at the 2007 election when Craig Thomson defeated Ken Ticehurst.

The seat has been held by Labor’s Emma McBride since 2016.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is located in the Central Coast region and includes the suburbs of The Entrance, Tuggerah and Wyong. The electorate stretches from Blue Haven in the north to Wyoming in the south, from The Entrance in the East through the Jilliby Valley. The division includes the suburbs Bateau Bay, Berkeley Vale, Blue Haven, The Entrance, Gorokan, Jilliby, Lisarow, Ourimbah, Toukley, Tuggerah, Tumbi Umbi, Wamberal, Wyoming, and Wyong.

<text>Morris Abraham Gray (May 16, 1889-January 22, 1966) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the provincial legislature from 1941 to 1966, and was a prominent figure in the province&#x27;s social-democratic Cooperative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) during this period.

==Biography==
Gray was born to Abraham and Sara Gur-Arie, a Jewish family in Gomel (now in Belarus), and received a high school education in that region. He arrived in Canada in 1908, a committed leftist following the attempted revolution of 1905. In 1911, he married Sonia Bruser.

Gray was a founder of the Canadian Jewish Congress, and at one stage served as its national Vice-President. He also became a member of the Mount Sinai Masonic Lodge and the Jewish Children&#x27;s Aid Society, and was an Executive Member of the Canada Club.

Gray served as a member of the Winnipeg School Board from 1926 to 1930, and was an Alderman in the city of Winnipeg from 1930 to 1942. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1941, in the riding of Winnipeg. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members by preferential balloting. Gray topped the CCF list on the first count, with 3,086 votes (ahead of party leader Seymour Farmer), finishing in eighth place overall. Gray and Farmer were subsequently elected on transfers, although longtime Independent Labour Party/CCF Member of the Legislative Assembly John Queen was defeated.

The 1941 election took place in a period of reduced support for the provincial CCF. The party had joined an all-party coalition government the previous year, with Farmer serving as Minister of Labour under Liberal-Progressive Premier John Bracken. The alliance proved disastrous for the CCF, who regularly saw their initiatives thwarted by the other parties. The demoralized party won only three seats in the entire province. After the alliance ended in 1943, Gray played a prominent role in rebuilding the CCF&#x27;s organization.

The CCF performed much more strongly in the 1945 general election, winning four seats in Winnipeg: Farmer (who topped the poll), Gray (who finished sixth), Lloyd Stinson and Donovan Swailes. The party was unable to match this success in the rest of the province, however, and remained in opposition.

In the provincial election of 1949, the City of Winnipeg was divided into three electoral zones, each of which elected four members. Gray ran in Winnipeg North, where he topped the poll and was the only candidate to be elected on the first count. He repeated this performance in the 1953 election; on both occasions, his leading opponent was Bill Kardash of the communist Labour Progressive Party.

Manitoba adopted a system of single-member constituencies for Winnipeg in the mid-1950s, and Gray (despite his strong objection to the new system) was easily elected for the riding of Inkster in the provincial election of 1958. He faced a slightly more serious challenge from the Progressive Conservatives in the 1959 election (in which PC leader Dufferin Roblin won an historic majority), but still defeated his leading opponent by over 1,500 votes. The CCF merged itself into the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961, and Gray joined the new party along with other members of his caucus.

Gray&#x27;s final election, in 1962, was the closest of his career, as he defeated Liberal candidate John Shanski by fewer than 600 votes. He died shortly before the election of 1966, and his riding was subsequently won by Sidney Green of the NDP.

Gray was respected by members of all parties for his advocacy on behalf of the disadvantaged. He frequently used the phrase, &quot;I know mine is a voice in the wilderness&quot; in his parliamentary orations. Among the causes he championed were a provincial labour code, health insurance, child welfare legislation, mother&#x27;s allowances and old age pensions. His appeals for supplementary aid for old-age pensioners were turned down fourteen years in a row by the governments of Stuart Garson and Douglas L. Campbell. Gray was voted &quot;Citizen of the Year&quot; by the &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot; in 1958.

He died in Winnipeg at the age of 76.

Morris Gray was the uncle of Gerald B. Gray, a Manitoba businessman, philanthropist and community leader.

<doc id="1078100" wikidata="Q845790" url="?curid=1078100" title="Lifehouse (band)">
<text>Lifehouse is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California composed of Jason Wade (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Rick Woolstenhulme Jr. (drums, percussion), Bryce Soderberg (bass, vocals), and Steve Stout (lead guitar). The band came to mainstream prominence with their 2000 single &quot;Hanging by a Moment,&quot; which led their debut studio album, &quot;No Name Face&quot; (2000). The song peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, won a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for Hot 100 Single of the Year—having spent 20 weeks within the top ten and over a cumulative year on the chart—and was named the best-performing single of 2001 despite not reaching the top position, making it the fourth song in the chart&#x27;s history to do so.

Following their debut, the band released six follow up albums: &quot;Stanley Climbfall&quot; (2002), their eponymous third album (2005), &quot;Who We Are&quot; (2007), &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; (2010), &quot;Almería&quot; (2012), and &quot;Out of the Wasteland&quot; (2015). Each were met with similar albeit trailing commercial success, spawning the singles &quot;You and Me,&quot; &quot;First Time,&quot; and &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot;; each became hits on the Mainstream Top 40, Adult Top 40, and Adult Contemporary charts, as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their musical style is exemplary of the adult contemporary format, meaning Lifehouse&#x27;s songs are often played at public, family-oriented retail venues such as supermarkets, convention centers, and malls.

==History==
===1996–1999: Blyss and formation===
Jason Wade had been writing songs as a coping mechanism since his parents&#x27; divorce. After moving to Los Angeles in 1995, he met bassist Sergio Andrade, his next-door neighbor. The following year, Wade, Andrade, and Jon &quot;Diff&quot; Palmer formed Blyss, the forerunner of Lifehouse, and began to play live shows at high schools and colleges. Later, Collin Hayden and Aaron Lord were added to the band.

Soon thereafter, word-of-mouth reached producer Ron Aniello, who introduced Jason to Jude Cole, who in turn introduced him to DreamWorks Records principal Michael Ostin. In 1998, Aniello produced Blyss&#x27;s first demos, with the financial backing of DreamWorks Records. Some of these recordings would form the 1999 EP &quot;Diff&#x27;s Lucky Day&quot;, which would be sold at live concerts or distributed among friends and music industry contacts.

===2000–2001: &quot;No Name Face&quot;===

In 2000, Blyss re-recorded, remixed, and released 12 of the 15 &quot;Diff&#x27;s Lucky Day&quot; session demos as &quot;No Name Face&quot;, their debut major label release under the name of Lifehouse. On their choosing the band name, frontman Jason Wade said, &quot;It&#x27;s about what we do as a band and for me personally. Most of this record is about my life and about life&#x27;s circumstances. Not only my life, but other people&#x27;s lives. We thought Lifehouse was a good name for it.&quot; 

&quot;No Name Face&quot; met significant commercial success and established the band, and eventually would sell in excess of four million copies worldwide. This was in part due to the success of &quot;Hanging by a Moment&quot;, Lifehouse&#x27;s first commercial single. Due to the charisma and talent of frontman Wade, DreamWorks Records&#x27; focus was primarily on him. &quot;Hanging by a Moment&quot; was the third song in chart history to be named the &quot;No. 1 Song of the Year&quot; on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 despite not having reached No. 1 on any weekly &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 survey (after Sam the Sham &amp; The Pharaohs&#x27; &quot;Wooly Bully&quot; in 1965 and Faith Hill&#x27;s &quot;Breathe&quot; in 2000). The second single from the album, &quot;Sick Cycle Carousel&quot;, was not as commercially successful as &quot;Hanging by a Moment&quot;, peaking at No. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart; the third and final single was &quot;Breathing&quot;, a reworking of a song featured on &quot;Diff&#x27;s Lucky Day&quot;.

The song &quot;Everything&quot; was the first of many Lifehouse songs to be featured in The WB&#x27;s future hit series &quot;Smallville&quot;. It was used in the series pilot and season 1 finale, and again in the series&#x27; 200th episode &quot;Homecoming&quot; in the show&#x27;s 10th and final season, as an homage to its season 1 episodes nine years prior. The song &quot;You and Me&quot; from the band&#x27;s eponymous third album would be released on Smallville&#x27;s second soundtrack, &quot;&quot;, in an extended form subtitled &quot;You and Me (Wedding Version)&quot;, and the band itself would perform the song live as a special guest appearance in the school prom scene at the end of the season 4 episode &quot;Spirit&quot;. Seven of the band&#x27;s songs would be featured in episodes of the series&#x27; first four seasons.

The song &quot;Somewhere in Between&quot;, also from &quot;No Name Face,&quot; was featured in the first-season episode of &quot;Falcon Beach&quot;, &quot;The Blame Game&quot;.

By the time Lifehouse&#x27;s first album was released, Palmer had left the band, and Wade and Andrade were the only remaining founding members. Soon after recording &quot;No Name Face&quot;, Wade and Andrade met Rick Woolstenhulme, who auditioned for the needed drummer part and joined the band as full-time drummer. Before the audition, Woolstenhulme had been rehearsing in an adjacent room to Lifehouse and frequently he and Wade would pass each other without meeting the other.

=== 2002–2004: &quot;Stanley Climbfall&quot; ===

Shortly after a long tour for &quot;No Name Face&quot;, Lifehouse reentered the studio to cut their second album, &quot;Stanley Climbfall&quot;. The album&#x27;s initial success was short-lived and its singles, 2002&#x27;s &quot;Spin&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, were vastly overshadowed by the success of the first album. Shortly after the album debuted, Rick&#x27;s brother Sean Woolstenhulme (of The Calling) officially became the fourth member of the band in June 2002. He had previously toured with Lifehouse.

In April 2004, Sergio Andrade confirmed that he had decided to leave the band to pursue individual projects. Shortly after his departure, Sean also left the band to pursue other musical projects such as Abandoned Pools and The Jimmy Chamberlin Complex.

===2004–2005: &quot;Lifehouse&quot;===

Jason Wade and Rick Woolstenhulme remained the active members of Lifehouse. In September 2004, Bryce Soderberg (previously of AM Radio) signed on as Lifehouse&#x27;s new bassist. On July 6, 2004, they went to Maryland to begin work on their eponymous third album, spending less than two months in the studio to record thirteen songs produced by John Alagia. &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was released on March 22, 2005.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;You and Me&quot;, was released for airplay on January 18, 2005. It was written several years prior and was originally performed by Jason Wade for the 2000 independent film &quot;All Over Again&quot;. The song was a success and stayed on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for 62 weeks (the fifth longest-charted in history), peaking at No. 5. The song also appears on the soundtrack to &quot;Smallville&quot;. One episode, &quot;Spirit&quot;, featured the band actually performing it and three other songs from the album (&quot;Come Back Down&quot;, &quot;Blind&quot;, and &quot;Undone&quot;) on the show. The song has also appeared on &quot;Cold Case&quot;, &quot;Boston Legal&quot;, &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, &quot;Everwood&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The 4400&quot; and &quot;Medium&quot; as well as the commercial for the final episode of &quot;Zoey 101&quot;. The song &quot;All In All&quot; was featured in &quot;Scrubs&quot;. The music video for the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Blind&quot;, was released October 19, 2005. It starred Tina Majorino and featured several other up-and-coming young actors such as Sarch McClain, Stephen Cheung, Christopher Thien Duc Van and Andy Walters.

In 2006, the newly-written song &quot;Good Enough&quot; was featured in the Disney film &quot;The Wild&quot; and was repeated over the end credits.

=== 2006–2008: &quot;Who We Are&quot;===
Lifehouse began recording their fourth album in mid-2006 at Kiefer Sutherland and Jude Cole&#x27;s recording studio, Ironworks Studios in Los Angeles. Their fourth album, entitled &quot;Who We Are&quot;, was released on June 19, 2007. The album features Wade, Woolstenhulme and Soderberg as its lineup, and &quot;rocks a little harder&quot; than their previous album, according to the band. The album&#x27;s release was followed by a tour with The Goo Goo Dolls and Colbie Caillat, which began June 15 at the Dodge Theatre in Phoenix, AZ.

The album&#x27;s first single was a bright, pop rock love song &quot;First Time&quot;, released on April 24, 2007. The song debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 48 in May, and peaked at number three on the Hot Adult Top 40 Charts. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; was released to radio stations on October 29, 2007. &quot;Broken&quot;, the album&#x27;s third single, peaked at number 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Broken&quot; has appeared on several television series, including &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (&quot;Lay Your Hands On Me&quot;), &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; (&quot;In Birth and Death&quot;, season 3, episode 2), &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;The Hills&quot;. Most recently, it was featured in the film soundtrack &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot;. 

Lifehouse held a contest to make a video for the song &quot;Make Me Over&quot;. The band gave 60 USC School of Cinematic Arts graduate students a chance to shoot the video for their new single. The winning video premiered at a gala event on December 5, 2008, at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills, CA.

The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in October 2008.

=== 2008–2011: &quot;Smoke and Mirrors&quot; ===

On April 11, 2009, the band announced that Ben Carey was an official member of the band. They said that they had been &quot;a four-piece for some time&quot; and that Ben is &quot;family to us&quot;. Carey had been touring with the band since 2004.

The single &quot;Halfway Gone&quot; was released on October 27, 2009. The music video premiered on the VH1 Top 20 on VH1.com at the end of November. &quot;Smoke &amp; Mirrors&quot; was released on March 2, 2010. The album debuted at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 54,000 copies sold. This marked the band&#x27;s highest chart debut to date, surpassing their previous peak at No. 7 with &quot;Stanley Climbfall&quot; in 2002.

===2011–2012: &quot;Almería&quot;===

On September 11, 2012, Lifehouse released a new single featuring Natasha Bedingfield entitled &quot;Between the Raindrops&quot;. A month later, on October 18, the band announced that the title of their sixth studio album would be &quot;Almería&quot;, named after a city in Spain famous as the locale of many classic Spaghetti Western films. &quot;Almería&quot; was released on December 11 in the US and December 12 worldwide. The album was met with mixed reviews, and failed to spawn a second single.

===2013–2018: &quot;Out of the Wasteland&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===

On July 24, 2013, Wade posted a letter to the band&#x27;s Facebook page saying that Lifehouse had parted with Geffen and was on a temporary hiatus as each band member turned attention to other projects (with the assurance that the band would continue to make records in the future). Drummer Rick Woolstenhulme Jr. began touring with the Goo Goo Dolls; bassist Bryce Soderberg initiated a new band titled KOMOX; lead guitarist Ben Carey continued work in country rock band Elvis Monroe; and singer and songwriter Jason Wade worked on his as-yet-unreleased singer-songwriter solo record. The band&#x27;s final show before their break was on September 25, 2013.

Lifehouse reentered the studio in May 2014. &quot;Flight&quot; was released independently on November 18, along with an announcement that the band&#x27;s hiatus was officially over and a new album entitled &quot;Seven&quot; would be released in April 2015. On December 8, 2014, Lifehouse stated on their official website that Ben Carey would no longer be a part of Lifehouse and instead would be focusing on his own projects; for live shows, the band later revealed that Steve Stout would fill in on lead guitar.

The album&#x27;s first official single, &quot;Hurricane&quot;, was released on January 27, 2015. On January 27, &quot;Billboard&quot;.com revealed a new album title &quot;Out of the Wasteland&quot; and published the official standard-edition track list of the album, giving an official release date of May 19, 2015. The album was released online and in stores on May 26, 2015 and debuted at number one on the Independent Albums chart. A special Target edition was made available with four bonus tracks.

The band was to begin touring in support of the album on June 19, as an opening act on the second North American leg of Nickelback&#x27;s No Fixed Address Tour, before the tour was cancelled due to the health of Nickelback&#x27;s lead singer, Chad Kroeger. A European headlining tour commenced on September 15, 2015 in Amsterdam, with extra dates added due to high demand.

In June 2017, the band released their first Greatest Hits compilation, featuring all 17 of their radio singles to date in chronological order, plus one non-single that still charted on radio. Lifehouse spent the summer of 2017 touring throughout the United States and Canada with Switchfoot in support of the album. It marked the first North American tour by the band since 2011. During the tour, Wade teamed up with Switchfoot&#x27;s Jon Foreman, to help raise funds for Houston&#x27;s Hurricane Harvey victims through the track called &quot;Shine Like Gold&quot;.

In early 2018, Lifehouse toured with Collective Soul across South Africa.

=== 2019–present: Hiatus and &quot;Goodbye Kanan&quot; ===
Lifehouse released their first single in six years, &quot;Cut &amp; Run&quot; in April 2021. The first single recorded with member Steve Stout, who had collaborated with Jason Wade on the side project ØZWALD and officially became the band&#x27;s lead guitarist in 2017, the song was succeeded by four more singles over the course of 2021. The band compiled these five singles and one new track into their first EP, &quot;Goodbye Kanan&quot;, released on November 26, 2021 under their own label Allswell Records.

==Other information==
Wade wrote the song &quot;From Where You Are&quot; for Allstate&#x27;s Teen Driving Program. The song was featured on the &quot;Tall Lights&quot; commercial and aired on NBC.

<text>The Division of Eden-Monaro () is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It is named for the town of Eden and the Monaro district of southern New South Wales.

Its boundaries have changed very little throughout its history, including the towns of Yass, Bega and Cooma and the city of Queanbeyan. It completely surrounds the Australian Capital Territory.

Until 1943 non-Labor parties held the seat for all but three years. Since then, it has been consistently marginal, split between provincial territory that votes strongly for Labor and rural areas that vote equally strongly for the Liberals (and their predecessors) or the Nationals. However, it was in Labor hands for all but one term from 1943 to 1975.

Up to the 2016 election, Eden-Monaro was long regarded as Australia&#x27;s most well-known &quot;bellwether seat&quot;. From 1972 to 2013, Eden-Monaro was won by the party that also won the election. During this time, all its sitting members were defeated at the polls – none retired or resigned.

Liberal incumbent Peter Hendy was defeated by Labor&#x27;s Mike Kelly at the 2016 election. Kelly had previously represented Eden-Monaro from 2007 to 2013. Kelly&#x27;s 2016 victory made him the seat&#x27;s first opposition MP elected since 1969; it was also the first time since then that the non-Labor parties had been in government without holding Eden-Monaro. The nation&#x27;s new bellwether became the seat of Robertson – continually won by the party that also won government since the 1983 election. &quot;Best&quot; bellwether aside, ABC psephologist Antony Green classed a total of eleven electorates as bellwethers in his 2016 election guide.

Labor’s Kristy McBain became the first woman to represent the division when she narrowly held the seat in the 2020 Eden-Monaro by-election. At the 2022 election, she held the seat with a large swing to her, boosting her two-party majority to eight percent, the strongest result in the seat for either side of politics since 1934.

<text>School Board is a Metromover station near the northwestern end of Downtown, Miami, Florida, south of Midtown and west of the Arts &amp; Entertainment District. It is the northern terminus of the people mover system.

This station is located near the intersection of Northeast 15th Avenue and Miami Place, about one block north of the Miami-Dade County Public Schools Administration Building. It opened to service May 26, 1994. School Board has consistently been one of the lowest used stations in the system, with well under 1,000 riders a day. As of 2017, two large apartment buildings totaling over 1,200 units were under construction nearby, such as Canvas and Square Station, Art Plaza, and Miami Plaza, with others planned. Prior to this, the station was surrounded by mostly empty lots.

<text>The Division of Farrer is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

It includes the cities of Albury and Griffith. Prior to 2016, it also included the city of Broken Hill.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1949 and is named for William Farrer, an agricultural scientist.

The division is located in the far south-western area of the state and includes Albury, Corowa, Narrandera, Leeton, Griffith, Deniliquin, Hay, Balranald and Wentworth.

The sitting member, since the 2001 election, is Sussan Ley, a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and that party&#x27;s deputy leader since 2022.

The 2015 redistribution resulted in Farrer significantly shrunk in size, ceding the state&#x27;s Far West including Broken Hill to the seat of Parkes. The seat previously gained this area from Parkes in the 2006 redistribution.

It has always been a safe non-Labor seat, alternating between the Liberal Party and the National Party. All four of its members have gone on to serve in cabinet, most notably Tim Fischer, leader of the National Party from 1990 to 1999 and Deputy Prime Minister from 1996 to 1999 during the first half of the Howard government.

<text>Francisco Bangoy International Airport — also commonly known as Davao International Airport — is the main airport serving Davao City and Davao Region in the Philippines. Serving as the main gateway to Mindanao, it is the busiest airport on the island and the third busiest in the Philippines in 2022.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
The site of the airport began operations in the 1940s as Sasa Landing Field with a donation of land in barangay Sasa, located in Buhangin district of Davao City, by Don Francisco Bangoy, the then-current patriarch of an influential family that founded and settled in Davao alongside Don Jose Uyanguren. At the time it began operation, the airport merely consisted of a unpaved grass runway and quonset huts serving as terminal buildings. At the time, and throughout much of the 1940s and the early 1950s, both &quot;Philippine Air Lines&quot; and the Philippine Air Force provided air service to the city.

=== As a civil aviation airport ===

The Davao (Sasa) Airport was opened for civil aviation on August 25, 1958. It initially consisted of a new long by wide concrete runway and a long by wide apron. The grass airstrip was later converted as a taxiway for general aviation.

By 1959, the complex consisted of a small control tower and several low-rise buildings. On June 19, 1960, &quot;Republic Act No. 2762&quot; was enacted which renamed the airport to Francisco Bangoy Airport in honor of the late Don Francisco Bangoy. Right of way and access to the terminal buildings and the airport were improved through further donation of land by Paciano Bangoy, Francisco&#x27;s son, during the latter stages of Paciano&#x27;s gubernatorial term. In 1970, the runway was extended and widened to and , respectively, while the apron was widened to . Five years later, the runway was further extended and widened to and to the current , respectively.

Construction for a new terminal designed by Filipino architect Leandro Locsin began in 1976. It was designed to handle a million passengers annually and was completed in 1980. The project, in addition to runway expansions, was funded during the term of then-Congressman Manuel Garcia, whose congressional district covers the airport perimeter. Airbus A300 operations by Philippine Airlines started on September 1, 1989, marking the first widebody service to the city. The first scheduled international passenger service started on April 29, 1992, with the inauguration of Bouraq Airlines flights to Manado, Indonesia. After the launch of scheduled international flights to Davao, regular flights to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia and Singapore were also commenced by Malaysia Airlines in 1996 and SilkAir in 1997, respectively.

=== Expansion ===
Rapid growth at the airport precipitated the construction of a million interim international terminal beside the airport&#x27;s then-existing terminal, and then eventually a new, larger terminal building that would consolidate the two existing terminals. In planning since 1992, construction began in 2000 and was subsequently inaugurated on December 2, 2003, with a capacity double that of the old airport terminal. The construction of the new ₱2.7 billion building was funded by both the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The modernization and upgrading of the airport facilities aim to make Davao as a hub for tourism and foreign investment in the region. Development was funded by a million loan from the ADB, co-financed by the EIB for twenty-five million ECUs, and through budgetary allocations from the government. The total cost of the project amounted to US$128 million.

As part of the modernization of the airport, the runway was once again extended to the current in 2001 to accommodate future international flights.

=== Contemporary history ===
On November 12, 2007, Cebu Pacific announced the airport as its third hub. Likewise, Philippine Airlines announced the airport as its third hub on March 26, 2018.

In June 2015, the Mindanao Development Authority announced its plans to turn the 1980–2003 airport terminal into a trade and cultural museum.

&quot;Republic Act No. 11457&quot;, also known as the &quot;Charter of the Davao International Airport Authority&quot;, was approved on August 30, 2019, creating and establishing the Davao International Airport Authority, which will manage all airports in the Davao Region, including the Francisco Bangoy International Airport.

== Future developments ==
The airport was slated for upgrading in 2016, but the project was shelved. In 2017, an expansion project of the airport was announced. Udenna Corporation submitted an unsolicited proposal in 2018 and received the original proponent status by the Department of Transportation in that year. The initial expansion and upgrading project aimed to include the expansion of the existing passenger terminal building, landside and airside developments, construction of a parallel taxiway, and the introduction of new technologies.

However, as of 2025, the Francisco Bangoy International Airport Project is now moving forward under a new public-private partnership (PPP) initiative led by the Davao International Airport Consortium. The Davao International Airport Authority (DIAA) is currently evaluating a ₱12.9 billion proposal to upgrade, expand, operate, and maintain the airport under a Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer (ROT) model.

The new expansion plan involves two key phases. Phase 1 includes the expansion and renovation of the passenger terminal building, upgrades to the existing cargo terminal, the construction of a fire station, the apron and parking lot expansion, the installation of a parallel taxiway, and the expansion of passenger access roads; while Phase 2 includes the further passenger terminal building expansion, the construction of a new cargo terminal, the additional apron and parking lot expansion, and the enhancement of ground support equipment (GSE) roads. As of January 27, 2025, the Davao International Airport Authority (DIAA) informed the proponent that it will proceed with the detailed evaluation of the proposal. The PPP Center endorsed the project to the DIAA on January 16, 2025, after determining its completeness under Section 10 of the PPP Code.

== Structure ==
=== Terminal ===
The current passenger terminal is a Malay architecture-inspired building which is four times larger than the old terminal. It is a two-level terminal building with an area of approximately . It is fully computerized, more secure and has more commercial spaces for concessionaires at approximately of gross leasable area. It has four (4) jetbridges for passenger boarding. It has a Flight Information Display System and closed-circuit television system complementing the terminal&#x27;s security system. It is designed to handle approximately 4 million passengers annually. The added capacity is complemented by the latest navigational, security, and baggage handling equipment.

The terminal has 14 domestic and 14 international check-in counters that can handle a steady flow of passenger traffic. The check-in counters are equipped with electronic weighing scales and conveyors and its baggage handling system is also computerized. It has two arrival areas, for domestic and international flights, with two baggage conveyors each. The cargo terminal building covers almost and can handle up to of cargo annually.

=== Runway ===
The airport has a single long by wide runway that can handle basically all passenger wide-bodied aircraft, including the Airbus A380. Complementing the runway are two (2) turning pads at each end of it, which help aircraft make a backtrack. The installation of a new instrument landing system (ILS) for both Runways 05 and 23 upgraded its compliance to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) operating category-Precision Approach Category 1. It can accommodate 8 to 10 aircraft landings per hour, depending on size and has the equivalent 9 gate holding areas for those aircraft. The airport has two dual access taxiways. Taxiways A3 and A4 are used to access the new ramp and terminal; taxiways B and C are used for access to the old airport ramp.

The Antonov An-124 is, by far, the largest aircraft to land at the airport. It is the fourth largest aircraft in the world, next to the Boeing 747-8.

=== Other structures ===
Besides the main terminal building, there are also new support facilities like the administration building, airfield maintenance building, central plant building, hangar for military and training aircraft, and an ARFF building. It has an 800-slot car parking area and four slots for shuttle buses. It has a standby power generator.

== Statistics ==
Data from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP).



An em dash (—) is used when data from CAAP is not available.

== Access and transportation ==

The airport is connected to the city via the Carlos P. Garcia National Highway. The four-laned La Verna-Mamay Bypass Road was constructed and finished in 2017 near the airport to decongest traffic going from Mamay road to the airport and beyond and vice versa, by avoiding the usually busy intersection of Mamay Road and the Carlos P. Garcia National Highway. To avoid widening a road, which would displace houses and creep onto the airport&#x27;s site, the road splits into two for 600 meters then merges back. It has a length of 1.7 kilometers, and is able to accommodate 1,000 vehicles per day.

The planned Davao City Expressway will further connect the airport to the city via a diamond interchange. If it goes according to plan, the entire project will be completed in 2026.

== Accidents and incidents ==

*On April 19, 2000, Air Philippines Flight 541, a Boeing 737-200 en route from Manila to Davao crashed near the airport, killing 131 people.
*On March 4, 2003, a bomb exploded in the waiting shed outside the old terminal building, killing 21 people. At least 145 others were injured.
*On the night of August 25, 2008, a Philippine Air Force Lockheed L-100 Hercules bound for Iloilo City crashed into Davao Gulf shortly after takeoff. The aircraft sank 800 feet into the gulf. The incident killed nine crew members plus two Philippine Army soldiers. After several days of a search-and-retrieval operation, the wreckage was found with the help of a US Navy ship, the USNS &quot;John McDonnell&quot;.
*On June 2, 2013, Cebu Pacific Flight 971, an Airbus A320 carrying 165 passengers inbound from Manila, overshot the runway during a heavy rain. There were no fatalities, but the plane was heavily damaged.

<text>The Vienna Woods (, ) are forested highlands that form the northeastern foothills of the Northern Limestone Alps in the states of Lower Austria and Vienna. The and range of hills is heavily wooded and a popular recreation area with the Viennese.

==Location==
The Vienna Woods are bounded by the rivers Triesting, Gölsen, Traisen and Danube, and are on the border of the Mostviertel and the Industrieviertel, two of the four quarters of Lower Austria. Reaching into the city of Vienna itself, they are a favourite outdoor destination for the densely populated area around the city.

==Geography==

The highest elevation in the Vienna Woods is Schöpfl at above sea level, the location of the Leopold Figl observatory. Important rivers in the Vienna Woods are the Wien, the Schwechat and the Triesting. The northeasternmost Leopoldsberg overlooking the Danube and the Vienna Basin forms the eastern end of the Alpine chain.

Even though the Vienna Woods are a protected landscape and important recreational area, they are threatened by urban sprawl. The Lainzer Tiergarten, an extensive park populated by wild boar and other woodland animals, as well as the &quot;Schwarzenbergpark&quot;, were created on the territory of the city of Vienna during the 19th century. The natural park &quot;Sandstein-Wienerwald&quot; is near Purkersdorf, some 20 km (12 mi) west of Vienna. There are also some caves, such as the &quot;Dreidärrischenhöhle&quot; (&quot;cave of the three deaf men&quot;).

==Geology==
The mountain ranges of the Vienna Woods are the transition between the Eastern Alps and the Carpathians, separated by the Danube and some tectonic lines near Vienna. The northern area is part of the Alps&#x27; sandstone zone, while its south is part of the Northern Limestone Alps. In the east, the border is the thermal line, which forms a geological break line to the Viennese Basin. Beeches, oaks and hornbeams grow throughout the north of the Wienerwald forest; in the south are conifers, mostly pines and firs. The &quot;Föhrenberge&quot; (Pine Mountains) natural park is in the latter region.

==History==

The Vienna Woods was the royal hunting grounds from the 11th century until 1850. Under the influence of the Avars, a Slavic population settled here after the Völkerwanderung, which may account for village names such as Döbling, Liesing or Gablitz. From the 16th century onwards forestry was practised. Industrial development beginning circa 1840 encouraged increased settlement of the area.

Through the northern part of the Vienna Woods (from Tulln an der Donau), a march of Polish troops of King Jan III Sobieski took place, which were to help Vienna in September 1683.

In 1870, plans were brought forward to clear most of the forest, but this caused widespread public resistance, in which Josef Schöffel was one of the most important figures.
In 1987, the governors of the states of Vienna, Lower Austria and Burgenland signed the &quot;Vienna Woods Declaration&quot; to protect nature in the region.

<text>Patrick Chapman (born 1968) is an Irish poet, writer and screenwriter.

Chapman&#x27;s first published work was &quot;Jazztown&quot;, released in 1991 by Raven Arts Press. This was followed five years later by &quot;The New Pornography&quot;, a collection of poems described as &quot;darkly humorous&quot; by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. His story collection, &quot;The Wow Signal&quot; (Bluechrome Publishing ) was published in 2007. He also wrote the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama, &quot;Fear of the Daleks&quot; (Big Finish, 2007).

Based on his own published story of the same name, he wrote the short drama film &quot;Burning The Bed&quot;, which starred Gina McKee and Aidan Gillen. &quot;Burning The Bed&quot; was a prizewinner at the 2004 Worldfest film festival in Houston, Texas and was also named Best Narrative Short at the DeadCENTER Film Festival in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Chapman has also written five episodes of the children&#x27;s television series, Garth and &quot;Bev&quot;, for Kavaleer Productions. This aired on RTÉ in 2009 and Cbeebies in 2010, and has worldwide distribution.

Chapman is the co-founder, along with writer Philip Casey, of irishliteraryrevival.com, which seeks to create &quot;a place where readers could find books no longer available elsewhere, and where writers could get a new audience for their texts, while stimulating interest in their work as a whole&quot; and where all the books are placed on the site under a Creative Commons License.

<text>Planaria is a genus of planarians in the family Planariidae.
Due to its excellent ability to regenerate, species of &quot;Planaria&quot; has also been used as model organisms in regeneration studies. When an individual is cut into pieces, each piece has the ability to regenerate into a fully formed individual. When decapitated, they retain their memories.

Various species of &quot;Planaria&quot; have been widely used as model invertebrate organisms in pharmacological research, in particular in the studies of the drugs of abuse. They were also proposed as models in toxicological research.
== Description ==
Currently the genus &quot;Planaria&quot; is defined as freshwater triclads with oviducts that unite to form a common oviduct without embracing the bursa copulatrix and with an adenodactyl present in the male atrium. The testes occur along the whole body.

&quot;Planaria&quot; originally have habitats in dark, murky water which results in such sensitivity (Paskin et al., 2014). They are also sensitive to other stimuli such as chemical gradients, vibration, magnetic and electric fields (Deochand et al., 2018). Their central nervous system includes the anterior (head, brain and eyes) and middle (abdominal trunk and pharynx) (Deochand et al., 2018).

== Diet ==
The food of &quot;Planaria&quot; species includes freshwater gastropods, tubificid worms, and freshwater arthropods, such as isopods of the genus &quot;Asellus&quot; and chironomid larvae. In the United Kingdom, &quot;P. torva&quot; is a successful predator of the invasive New Zealand mud snail (&quot;Potamopyrgus jenkinsi&quot;).

==Species==
The following species are recognised in the genus &quot;Planaria&quot;:

<text>The Division of Fowler is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

Fowler is based in Sydney&#x27;s outer southwestern suburbs of Liverpool, Warwick Farm, Chipping Norton, Cabramatta, Canley Vale, Mount Pritchard, Abbotsbury, Bossley Park, Edensor Park, Greenfield Park, Prairiewood, St Johns Park, Wakeley, Bonnyrigg, Canley Heights, Carramar and Fairfield East.

Fowler is a diverse electorate, containing immigrant communities of Vietnamese and Chinese ancestry. According to the , 39.1% of electors were born in Australia, 16.0% were born in Vietnam and 2.0% were born in China (excluding SARs and Taiwan). At the time of the 2022 Australian federal election, 16% of Fowler&#x27;s population possessed Vietnamese ancestry, and 11% possessed Chinese heritage.

The current MP is Dai Le, who was elected as an independent in 2022. She is the first non-Labor politician to represent Fowler. Le has strong links to the Vietnamese community in Fowler; she was born in Vietnam and migrated to Australia as an eleven year old after three years in a Philippines refugee camp.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1984 and is named after Lilian Fowler, the first female mayor in Australia.

The division includes the Sydney suburbs of Cabramatta, Cabramatta West, Canley Heights, Chipping Norton, Edensor Park, Fairfield East, Greenfield Park, Liverpool, St Johns Park, Wakeley, and Warwick Farm; as well as parts of Abbotsbury, Bonnyrigg, Bossley Park, Canley Vale, Carramar, Fairfield, Fairfield West, Guildford, Moorebank, Mount Pritchard, Prairiewood, and Yennora.

The member for Fowler from the 2010 federal election to the 2022 federal election has been Chris Hayes, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

===2022 election===
After announcing that he would retire at the 2022 federal election, Hayes endorsed Tu Le, a locally resident lawyer, to succeed him. A factional dispute involving winnable seats on the Senate ticket saw Senator Kristina Keneally parachuted into the election for the &quot;safe&quot; seat in order to resolve the dispute. It would also allow Keneally to serve on the ministerial or shadow frontbench following the election. Keneally&#x27;s move was heavily criticised both in the community and within the party for her decision to usurp the position of a local candidate, with Keneally living on Scotland Island on Sydney&#x27;s Northern Beaches, over an hour&#x27;s drive from the electorate.

Dai Le, a local independent who was serving as the deputy mayor of the Fairfield City Council announced her intention to stand for the seat. Dai Le had been a Liberal Party member earlier in her career until her expulsion from the party as her bid for Mayor breached party rules regarding running against an endorsed candidate.

Le won the seat after a major swing against Labor. Keneally&#x27;s slightly higher first preference vote was not high enough to prevent Le from winning on the two party preferred count. Liberal Party, United Australia, One Nation and Liberal Democrats preferences flowed to Le while the small number of Greens votes and voters not following a typical right to left preference flow were not enough to keep it in the hands of Labor. It was the first time Labor had lost the seat, after 13 straight election wins.

<text>The 2nd Canadian Parliament was in session from March 5, 1873, until January 2, 1874. The membership was set by the 1872 federal election from July 20 to October 12, 1872, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1874 election. Among the by-elections were the first election of PEI MPs, PEI joining Confederation in 1873.

It was first controlled by a Conservative/Liberal-Conservative majority under Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald and the 1st Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Liberal Party, led by Alexander Mackenzie. After a scandal in the Conservative Party, the Liberals took power, forming the 2nd Canadian Ministry. Alexander Mackenzie, now Prime Minister, immediately called an election.

The Speaker was James Cockburn. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1872-1873 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.

The unusual case of a new party taking control of the government between elections has only happened in the federal government twice; the other occasion was in the 15th Canadian parliament.

There were 2 sessions of the 2nd Parliament:

<text>The Division of Gilmore is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales.

==History==

The Division of Gilmore was created in 1984 when the House of Representatives was expanded, and was named after Dame Mary Gilmore, the poet and author. The seat was first won by John Sharp of the National Party. The electorate originally included the areas of Goulburn and Southern Highlands but, following a redistribution, the seat moved to its current boundaries along the New South Wales South Coast. As a consequence, Sharp moved to the nearby seat of Hume in 1993. He served in the First Howard Ministry until he resigned in 1997 due to the &quot;travel rorts affair&quot;.

The seat was won by the ALP&#x27;s Peter Knott in 1993, but he was defeated at the 1996 election by Joanna Gash of the Liberal Party. The seat was considered marginal after the 1996 and 1998 elections, but a big swing in 2001 saw Gash hold the seat by a much larger margin. That was cut back to a margin of about 4% in 2007.

Gilmore&#x27;s boundaries were redrawn before the 2010 election, making the seat a notional Labor one, but Gash gained a 5.7% swing. She announced her retirement in 2012, and was later elected Mayor of Shoalhaven.

At the 2013 federal election, Gash was succeeded by Liberal candidate Ann Sudmalis, who won despite a 2.7% swing to Labor. Sudmalis suffered a further 3% swing in the 2016 election, but narrowly won a second term by only 1,503 of the two-party-preferred vote. On 17 September 2018, Sudmalis announced that she would not contest the forthcoming election, blaming what she called ego-driven bullying, betrayal and backstabbing by Gareth Ward, a Liberal member of state parliament for an electorate that overlaps hers.

On 22 January 2019, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Warren Mundine would be the Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate for the seat in the 2019 election, after Mundine joined the party the same day. Mundine, and former Liberal party member Grant Schultz, who ran as an independent, were defeated by the ALP&#x27;s Fiona Phillips. She retained the seat at the 2022 election by 379 votes.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division is located in the Shoalhaven and the southern Illawarra regions. It covers the entirety of the Kiama and Shoalhaven local government areas and the northern parts of the Eurobodalla. The most northerly part of the electorate is Minnamurra and the most southerly part is just south of Moruya. The western boundary includes much of the Budawang and Morton National Parks.

Towns and suburbs includes Nowra, Worrigee, Batemans Bay, Berry, Bomaderry, Callala Bay, Culburra Beach, Gerringong, Kangaroo Valley, Kiama, Milton, Minnamurra, Nowra, Sussex Inlet, Ulladulla, Moruya and Greenwell Point.

<text>Danielle Nicole Panabaker (born September 19, 1987) is an American actress. She began acting as a teenager and came to prominence for her roles in the Disney films &quot;Stuck in the Suburbs&quot; (2004), &quot;Sky High&quot; (2005) and &quot;Read It and Weep&quot; (2006), and in the HBO miniseries &quot;Empire Falls&quot; (2005). She won three Young Artist Awards: for guest-starring in an episode of the legal drama television series &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2004), for her lead role in the TV film &quot;Searching for David&#x27;s Heart&quot; (2005) and for her ensemble performance in the family comedy film &quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot; (2005).

Panabaker came to wider attention as a cast member in the CBS legal drama series &quot;Shark&quot; (2006–2008) and is also noted as a scream queen, having starred in the psychological thriller &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot; (2007) and the horror films &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; (2009), &quot;The Crazies&quot; (2010), John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;The Ward&quot; (2010) and &quot;Piranha 3DD&quot; (2012).

After starring in recurring roles on &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; (2011–2013), &quot;Bones&quot; (2012–2013) and &quot;Justified&quot; (2014), Panabaker guest-starred as Caitlin Snow on The CW television series &quot;Arrow&quot; in April 2014. The actress was then included as Snow in the main cast of the spin-off series &quot;The Flash&quot;, which premiered that October. Starting with the series&#x27; second season, Panabaker began playing the character&#x27;s alter ego Killer Frost in different capacities, in conjunction with her role as Snow, leading to subsequent guest appearances on &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;Supergirl&quot; and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;. For her role on &quot;The Flash&quot; as Frost, Panabaker has been nominated for five Teen Choice Awards and won the 2019 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television.

==Early life==
Panabaker was born in Augusta, Georgia, to Donna (née Mayock) and Harold Panabaker. Her younger sister, Kay Panabaker, was also an actress and is currently working as a zoologist. As her father&#x27;s sales job took them across the country, the family spent time in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and, for a short time around Panabaker&#x27;s kindergarten year, in Orange, Texas. She took a theater class at a summer camp, discovered her love of acting, and started acting in community theaters at the age of 12, later auditioning for commercials.

After moving to Naperville, Illinois, in 2000, Panabaker went to Crone Middle School and then Neuqua Valley High School, participating in the speech team. She graduated from high school when she was 14 years old. Panabaker also took ballet and pointe classes up until she was fifteen. In 2003, feeling it was the only way to land acting roles regularly, Panabaker, her sister, and their mother relocated to Los Angeles, California, so she could pursue an acting career. She attended Glendale Community College, studying acting. In 2005, she earned her associate degree and appeared on the national Dean&#x27;s List. In 2006, she began her senior year at the University of California, Los Angeles, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in June 2007, again appearing on the Dean&#x27;s List.

==Career==

Panabaker followed her initial appearances in commercials with roles in television, including a part in &quot;The Guardian&quot; (for which she won a Young Artist Award), as well as other television series including &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;Summerland&quot;, and the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Stuck in the Suburbs&quot;. She also appeared in the Lifetime Television productions &quot;Sex and the Single Mom&quot; and &quot;Mom at Sixteen&quot;, as well as the well-reviewed miniseries &quot;Empire Falls&quot;. She considers &quot;Empire Falls&quot; to be her big break, as it gave her the confidence to pursue her career. In addition, Panabaker appeared in stage productions with roles in musical theater, including &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Pippin&quot;, &quot;Once upon a Time&quot;, and &quot;Beauty Lou and the Country Beast&quot;. In 2004, she starred in the ABC film &quot;Searching for David&#x27;s Heart&quot;. In 2005, Panabaker co-starred in two widely released theatrical films, &quot;Sky High&quot; and &quot;Yours, Mine &amp; Ours&quot;. Her next role was in the film &quot;Home of the Giants&quot; (2008). She also had a supporting role in the film &quot;Mr. Brooks&quot;. In the Disney Channel original movie &quot;Read It and Weep&quot;, she plays Is, an alternate version of Jamie, who was played by her real-life sister, Kay Panabaker.

From 2006 to 2008, Panabaker starred in the CBS television drama &quot;Shark&quot;, playing Julie Stark, the daughter of the lead character. In 2009, Panabaker played Jenna, a main character in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; remake. Panabaker next starred in the films &quot;The Crazies&quot; and &quot;The Ward&quot;.

In 2011, Panabaker starred as Katie Lapp, the lead character in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;The Shunning&quot;, based on the novel by Beverly Lewis. She was to reprise her role in the 2013 sequel &quot;The Confession&quot;, but a scheduling conflict forced her to drop out, and the role was recast. In 2013, she starred in another Hallmark Channel movie, &quot;Nearlyweds&quot;.

<text>BEST (&quot;Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology&quot;) is a national six-week robotics competition in the United States held each fall, designed to help interest middle school and high school students in possible engineering careers. The games are similar in scale to those of the FIRST Tech Challenge.

==History==

The idea for a BEST (Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology) competition originated in 1993 when two Texas Instruments (TI) engineers, Ted Mahler and Steve Marum, were serving as guides for Engineering Day at their company site in Sherman, Texas. Together with a group of high school students, they watched a video of freshmen building a robot in Woodie Flowers&#x27;s class at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The high school students were so interested that Mahler and Marum said, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we do this?&quot;

With enthusiastic approval from TI management, North Texas BEST was born. The first competition was held in 1993 with 14 schools and 221 students (including one team from San Antonio).

After learning that a San Antonio group had formed a non-profit organization to support a BEST event, North Texas BEST mentored them in providing their own BEST competition. Thus, San Antonio BEST, the second BEST competition site (or &quot;hub&quot;), was started in 1994. The two groups - North Texas and San Antonio - decided to meet for Texas BEST, a state playoff at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas. The competition has also been held at Texas A&amp;M University, Southern Methodist University (SMU), Texas Tech, University of North Texas (in Denton) and more recently it was hosted by the University of Texas at Dallas with the competition being held in Frisco, TX. The number of SABEST teams invited to Texas BEST is based on the ratio of schools participating at SA BEST to the total number participating at all the BEST hubs that feed Texas BEST multiplied by the total number of teams invited to Texas BEST. The number of San Antonio teams varies from year to year but is typically approximately 8 teams. This is a regional playoff where BEST teams meet from around Texas and New Mexico.

In 1995, more hubs were started as word spread: Collin County BEST (Frisco, Texas), West Texas BEST (Texas Tech University in Lubbock), and Chicago BEST. Also that year, Texas BEST - the &quot;state championship&quot; - became an annual event sponsored by Texas Instruments and Texas A&amp;M University.

BEST continued to grow, adding 3-4 hubs annually. In 1997, the four-year old organization established itself as a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation in the state of Texas as BEST Robotics, Inc. (BRI).
Its growth continued at a similar pace, spreading throughout Texas and neighboring states (Arkansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico) and further (Kansas, Illinois, Kentucky and California).

In 2001, BEST held its first New Hub Workshop at Texas Instruments in Dallas. This sparked an explosion of growth in the next several years throughout Alabama and the south. In 2003, BEST&#x27;s second regional championship was born, South&#x27;s BEST, at Auburn University, Alabama. Thirty-six teams from nine hubs in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Ohio, and Illinois competed. Texas BEST featured 60 teams from 17 hubs in five states. BEST continued to grow as many colleges and universities began organizing hubs. The reach became wider with hubs as far apart as Fargo, North Dakota and New Britain, Connecticut. Two additional championships were added as the program expanded across the US, bringing the total to four. Frontier Trails BEST championship was established in Fort Smith, Arkansas and Northern Plains BEST championship in Fargo, North Dakota.

In 2009, the program started its bi-annual BEST National Conference for volunteers and teachers. The conference is held during the summers of odd years and provides a great place to share information. There are typically tracks regarding hub execution, technical training, design process, and other teacher training.

In 2017, BEST moved its national headquarters to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1078167" wikidata="Q2973482" url="?curid=1078167" title="Division of Canberra">
<text>The Division of Canberra is an Australian electoral division in the Australian Capital Territory. It is named for the city of Canberra, Australia&#x27;s national capital, and includes all of central Canberra, Kowen, Majura, as well as part of Weston Creek, Woden Valley, Molonglo Valley, Belconnen, and Jerrabomberra. Canberra&#x27;s Parliament House, the meeting place of the Parliament of Australia, is located within the division. It is currently held by Alicia Payne of the Labor Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state or territory, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state or territory&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state or territory are malapportioned.

As of 2018, the division of Canberra includes Canberra Central, the Woden Valley suburbs of Curtin, Chifley, Garran and Hughes, the Belconnen suburbs of Aranda, Bruce, Cook, Giralang, Hawker, Kaleen, Lawson and Weetangera, the Jerrabomberra suburbs of Beard and Oaks Estate and the districts of Majura and Kowen.

==History==

The division was created in a redistribution of the former Division of Australian Capital Territory, gazetted on 19 April 1974. It originally encompassed the southern suburbs of Canberra, including the districts of Tuggeranong, Weston Creek and Woden Valley. It also generally included the land in the ACT south of the Molonglo River and Lake Burley Griffin, although at one time some suburbs in the inner south of the lake were includes in the now abolished division of Fraser. Later the division included Reid and Campbell and prior to the 2018 redistribution, it included Civic, Acton, Turner south of Haig Park and east of Sullivans Creek, Braddon south of Haig Park, Reid, Campbell and Pialligo. From 2016, the division included Norfolk Island.

In 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission announced substantial alterations to the boundaries of the electorate, due to the creation of a new seat (the Division of Bean) covering the majority of the Australian Capital Territory, centred on its south, as well as Norfolk Island. The new Division of Canberra only covers Canberra&#x27;s inner suburbs, Majura and Kowen in the Territory&#x27;s north-east, the Belconnen suburbs of Aranda, Bruce, Cook, Giralang, Hawker, Kaleen, Lawson and Weetangera, and parts of Woden Valley north of Hindmarsh Drive.

For most of its history it has been a fairly safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, but it has been won by the Liberal Party three times, most recently at a 1995 by-election. In recent elections, the Australian Greens vote has increased steadily, with the party being only just under 4,000 votes of surpassing the Liberal Party on primary vote to enter the two-party preferred vote. In particular, the Greens came second on primary vote in 12 booths at the 2019 federal election, and won in two booths (Dickson East and Canberra City). However, the Labor Party retains a vote almost double that of the Greens in the electorate.

<doc id="1078168" wikidata="Q1070277" url="?curid=1078168" title="Cross of St. George (Russia)">
<text>The Cross of Saint George () is a state decoration of the Russian Federation. It was initially established by Imperial Russia where it was officially known as the Decoration of the Military Order of Saint George between 1807 and 1913. The Cross of Saint George was reinstated into the Russian awards system in 1992.

==History 1807–1917==
Established in the February 1807 decree of Emperor Alexander I, it was intended as a reward for &quot;undaunted courage&quot; by the lower ranks (soldiers, sailors and NCOs) of the military. Article four of the decree ordered the decoration to hang from the same ribbon as the Order of Saint George. There was only a single class with no restriction as to the number of awards per person.

The first soldier to be awarded the Cross of Saint George was a cavalry non-commissioned officer named Yegor Ivanovich Mitrokhin. He received the award for distinction in the battle against the French at Friedland on 2 June 1807.

Numbering of the crosses on the reverse began in January 1809, conversely, a register of the awards was also started that same year. By this time, approximately 10,000 crosses had already been awarded. By the beginning of the War of 1812 (French invasion of Russia), 16,833 crosses had been produced by the mint. Statistics of awards over the first years is detailed below:

* 1812: 6,783 awarded
* 1813: 8,611 awarded
* 1814: 9,345 awarded
* 1815: 3,983 awarded
* 1816: 2,682 awarded
* 1817: 659 awarded
* 1818: 328 awarded
* 1819: 189 awarded

An 1856 royal decree divided the decoration into four classes. A person initially received the fourth class and would subsequently be promoted to higher classes for further acts of bravery; one who received all four classes was called a &quot;Full Cavalier of Saint George&quot;. The first and second classes were made of gold, the third and fourth were made of silver. The numbering on the reverse began anew for each class of the decoration.

A 1913 royal decree officialized the name &quot;Cross of Saint George&quot; and the numbering began anew. In 1915, due to war shortages, the first and second class decorations were made of lower grade gold (60 percent gold, 39.5 percent silver, 0.5 percent copper). The third and fourth class decorations were produced in the same 99 percent silver. There were 26,950 first class crosses (No. 5531 to No. 32,840) and 52,900 second class crosses (No. 65,030 to No. 12,131) produced in low-grade gold. Approximate number of St. George Crosses awarded from 1914 to 1917:

* 1st class: 33,000
* 2nd class: 65,000
* 3rd class: 289,000
* 4th class: 1.2 million


&quot;1M&quot; was used in the serial number to indicate the number one million. On 10 September 1916, the Highest Council of Ministers approved a change to the St George Cross removing the gold and silver from its making. They began to mint crosses made of &quot;yellow metal&quot; (JM) and of &quot;white metal&quot; (BM). The crosses first and second class, made of yellow metal had the letters &quot;JM&quot; (Russian &quot;ЖМ&quot;) above the serial number, the crosses second and third class, made of white metal had the letters &quot;BM&quot; (Russian &quot;БМ&quot;) above the serial number. The number of crosses produced for each class in &quot;JM&quot; and &quot;BM&quot;:

* 1st class JM 10,000: No. 32,481 to No. 42,480

* 4th class MB 89,000: No. 1,210,151 to No. 1,299,150

In 1917, the Provisional Government changed the statute of the cross allowing its award to junior officers. When awarded as such, a silver laurel branch device was affixed to the ribbon. The Cross of St. George was abolished after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the Order of Glory nominally replaced it during the Soviet Era.

==During the Civil War==
The virtual absence of a unified command and the territorial fragmentation of the White armies meant that no common award system was created. Nor was there a unified approach to the question of the admissibility of awarding pre-revolutionary honours.

As for the soldiers&#x27; St George&#x27;s Crosses and medals, they were awarded to ordinary soldiers and Cossacks, freedmen, non-commissioned officers, junkers, volunteers and nurses in all territories occupied by the White armies. During the Iași–Don March of Mikhail Drozdovsky&#x27;s detachment along the Iasi Don route, a whole bag of St George&#x27;s Crosses was given to Drozdovsky at the headquarters of the Romanian Front, were also awarded to the officers of the detachment. The first such award took place on 30 March 1918.

At the same time, in the south of Russia, on the territory of the Don Republic, taking into account the local specifics of George the Victorious on St George&#x27;s Crosses depicted in the form of a Cossack: in a hat with a Bashlyk, Cossack uniform and boots, a forelock is visible from under the hat, his face is framed by a beard. Since 11 May 1918 more than 20 thousand such crosses of the 4th class, 9080 of the 3rd, 470 of the 2nd and one of the 1st were awarded. In the Don Army St George&#x27;s Crosses were also awarded to officers and generals.

On 9 February 1919 the awarding of the George Cross was restored on the Eastern Front of the Russian Civil War to forces commanded by Alexander Kolchak. But at the same time it was forbidden to award officers with the George Cross with a laurel branch and to wear them.

In the Northern Army (Russia) of Evgenii Miller&#x27;s Northern Army was awarded 2270 crosses of the 4th class, 422 of the 3rd class, 106 of the 2nd class and 17 of the 1st class.

In the Volunteer Army the awarding of St. George&#x27;s Crosses was permitted on 12 August 1918 and took place on the same basis as in the Russian Imperial Army: &quot;Soldiers and volunteers are presented [to] St. George&#x27;s Crosses and medals for the feats specified [in] the St. George Statute, in the same order as during the war [on the] external front, awarded crosses by the authority of the commander, and medals by the authority of the commander&quot;. The first awarding took place on 4 October 1918. In the Army of Wrangel this practice was preserved.

The last Chevalier of St George of the Civil War, awarded in Russia, was &quot;Vakhmistr&quot; Pavel Vasilyevich Zhadan (1901-1975), awarded in June 1920 for his participation in the defeat of the cavalry corps of Dmitry Zhloba.

During the Russian Civil War, the award was issued by commanders of White movement forces, with Naval ratings, soldiers and their officers of Entente interventionist forces being decorated with the award.

==1992 reinstatement==

Following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Cross of St George was reinstated by Decision of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation № 2557-I of March 20, 1992. Its award criteria were amended twice, first on August 8, 2000 by Presidential Decree 1463 and most recently by Presidential Decree 1099 of 7 September 2010.

The Cross of Saint George is awarded to soldiers, sailors, sergeants, petty officers, warrant officers and junior officers for deeds and distinction in battle in defence of the Fatherland, as well as for deeds and distinction in battle on the territory of other states while maintaining or restoring international peace and security with recognized instances of courage, dedication and military skill. Awarded sequentially in four classes from the fourth to the first for subsequent acts of courage.

The first post reinstatement award ceremony took place in August 2008 to soldiers who displayed courage and heroism during the armed conflict in South Ossetia. On that day, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev decorated 11 soldiers and sergeants with the Cross of Saint George, fourth class, for courage and heroism displayed in the performance of military duties. A further 263 servicemen were decorated with the Cross of Saint George for distinction displayed in the Georgia operation.

List of the 11 initial recipients in August 2008:
* Adushkin, Sergei Ravilyevich, junior sergeant
* Alekseev, Sergey Alexandrovich, junior sergeant
* Bazhenov, Taras Germanovich, private
* Kelohsaev, Atsamaz Tamerlanovich, junior sergeant

===Russo-Ukrainian War===
On New Year 2023, Russian president Vladimir Putin awarded the Cross of St. George to military personnel participating in the invasion of Ukraine.

==Award description==
The modern Cross of Saint George is virtually identical to the imperial variant. It is a 34mm wide cross pattée worn on the left side of the chest with other medals, the obverse has a central medallion bearing the right facing image of Saint George on horseback slaying the dragon. The reverse of the central medallion bears the Cyrillic monogram of the Order of Saint George &quot;SG&quot; (Russian: «СГ»). The reverse of the two lateral arms of the cross bear the serial number of the award, the left arm having an embossed letter &quot;N&quot; at its left extremity. The class of the cross is embossed on the reverse of the lower arm, &quot;1-я степ&quot; for the first class, &quot;2-я степ&quot; for the second class, &quot;3-я степ&quot; for the third class and &quot;4-я степ&quot; for the fourth class.

The crosses first and second class are made of gilt silver, the crosses third and fourth class are made of silver. All four crosses hang from the standard Russian pentagonal mount covered with an overlapping 24mm wide silk moiré ribbon of Saint George. A bow made of the same ribbon is affixed to the crosses first and third class to distinguish them from the second and fourth class awards.

When the cross is not worn, a ribbon bar is worn on the uniform. The ribbon bar is 8mm high by 24mm wide, it bears a 7mm high golden metallic Roman numeral denoting the class of the award.

<doc id="1078189" wikidata="Q4501961" url="?curid=1078189" title="USS Tillman (DD-135)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Tillman&quot; (DD–135) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Senator Benjamin Tillman. Transferred to the United Kingdom in World War II, she was commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Wells&quot; (I 95).

==United States Navy==

&quot;Tillman&quot; was laid down on 29 July 1918 by the Charleston Navy Yard; launched on 7 July 1919; sponsored by Miss Mary Y. Tillman the granddaughter of Senator Tillman; re-classified DD-135 on 17 July 1920, during the Navy-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers; and commissioned on 10 April 1921.

Following shakedown, &quot;Tillman&quot; operated out of Charleston Navy Yard with Division 20, Squadron 9, Destroyer Flotilla 1, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, until the summer of 1921. Operating with half of her normal complement by the following winter, the destroyer trained and cruised with Division 33, Squadron 8, Atlantic Fleet Destroyer Squadrons into the spring of 1922. Soon thereafter, &quot;Tillman&quot; was decommissioned on 3 July 1922 and laid up at the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

After almost eight years of inactivity, &quot;Tillman&quot; was placed back in commission at Philadelphia on 1 May 1930. Returning to Charleston, the destroyer operated with Division 23, Squadron 7, of the Scouting Fleet Destroyer Squadrons. Transferred to Division 48 by 1 January 1931, &quot;Tillman&quot; conducted training cruises for naval reserve trainees and NROTC midshipmen until late in the spring of 1933, when she shifted to Boston to train reservists and NROTC midshipmen of the 1st Naval District.

As part of the Scouting Fleet Training Squadron, &quot;Tillman&quot; eventually returned to the Charleston Navy Yard and alternated tours of active training duty with periods moored in &quot;rotating reserve.&quot; On 1 January 1934, she returned to full-time active duty with the Training Squadron and resumed training cruises. The destroyer continued to alternate periods in the rotating reserve with assignments to training duty into the late 1930s. Later assigned to Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 29 of Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 10, she worked out of Charleston and Boston, training reservists and NROTC midshipmen, participating in Fleet landing exercises in the Caribbean; conducting battle practices and drills; and showing the flag at ports along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. She continued this schedule until she was again decommissioned on 15 June 1939.

Two and one-half months later, German forces attacked Poland, triggering World War II in Europe. Early in the spring of 1940, the tide turned against the Allies, as Germany launched a devastatingly successful blitzkrieg. In addition, German U-boats terrorized transatlantic convoys and took heavy tolls of merchantmen and escorts alike. By summer, the United Kingdom was the last country in Europe still at war with Hitler, with only the English Channel between her and the Germans.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s destroyer forces had suffered losses in the Atlantic, as well as in the Norwegian debacle and the evacuation of Dunkirk. At this point, the newly installed prime minister, Winston Churchill, appealed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt for help. Accordingly, on 23 July 1940, the two leaders reached the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, whereby the United States would transfer 50 overaged flush-decked destroyers to the British in return for 99-year leases on sites for strategic bases in the Western Hemisphere.

As one of the 50 ships, &quot;Tillman&quot; was recommissioned at Philadelphia on 24 August 1940. About three months later, she moved up the coast to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the transfer point for the &quot;50 ships that saved the world.&quot; On 21 November 1940, she arrived at that port with the remainder of her division, DesDiv 72, the last group of ships to be turned over to the Royal and Royal Canadian Navies.

==Royal Navy==

Decommissioned on 26 November 1940, &quot;Tillman&quot;″s name was struck from the US Navy list on 8 January 1941. Commissioned in the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Wells&quot; (I 95) on 5 December 1940, the destroyer suffered damage on the 9th in a collision with sister ship . She was thus unable to sail for the British Isles until 4 February 1941. Getting underway on that date in company with , &quot;Wells&quot; encountered a heavy gale in which she lost her topmast. &quot;Newark&quot; soon suffered engine failure and had to be towed back to Halifax.

&quot;Wells&quot; eventually arrived in the United Kingdom and was soon assigned to the 17th Destroyer Division, which provided escorts for the 1st Minelaying Squadron. During this time, she carried out a number of mining operations off the western coast of Scotland.

Between these operations, &quot;Wells&quot; escorted convoys to and from Iceland. On 10 June 1941, while operating south of this strategic isle, she attacked a U-boat but without success. Two days later, she encountered another U-boat and went to the attack, but the explosion of her own depth charges damaged her and forced her to give up the search.

Following refitting at Hull, England, in the autumn of 1941, &quot;Wells&quot; returned to convoy escort duty. &quot;Wells&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog anti-submarine mortars. On 16 January 1942, she intercepted an SOS from SS &quot;R. J. Cullen&quot;—an American merchantman which had run aground on the southeast side of Barra Island, in the Outer Hebrides, west of Scotland. Heavy seas initially made launching a boat a virtual impossibility, but &quot;Wells&quot; stood by until lifeboats and tugs arrived and transported the steamer&#x27;s crew safely ashore.

While escorting two transports later that spring, &quot;Wells&quot; and were bombed by German aircraft west of the Faroe Islands, but escaped damage. During November, &quot;Wells&quot; conducted convoy escort operations with Convoy KX-6, supporting Operation &quot;Torch&quot;, the invasion of North Africa, and returned to the United Kingdom in December with Convoy MKF-3 to resume escort duties with Iceland-bound convoys.

After serving another tour of convoy escort and minelaying escort duties, &quot;Wells&quot; was transferred to Rosyth in August 1943 and operated with the Rosyth Escort Force, screening coastwise convoys between the Firth of Forth and the Thames estuary. Early in 1945, after refitting at the Clyde in late 1944, she became a target ship for aircraft training with the Western Approaches Command, a role in which she served until reduced to reserve status at Greenock after World War II, in mid-1945. Decommissioned in July 1945, Wells was subsequently scrapped at Troon, on 24 July 1945.

<text>The New Democrat Network (NDN) was an American think tank that promoted centrist candidates for the Democratic Party. NDN was a 501(c)(4) membership organization that functioned in collaboration with two subsidiary organizations, the NDN Political Fund, a non-federal political organization (527), and NDN PAC, a federal political action committee. The organization was dissolved by Rosenberg in March 2024.

The group was officially named the New Democrat Network from 1996 to 2004 and NDN from 2004 to 2024.

==Founding==
NDN was led and founded by Simon Rosenberg in 1996, after his split with the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), for which he worked.

Before founding NDN, Rosenberg worked as a television news writer and producer and a political strategist for the Michael Dukakis and Bill Clinton presidential campaigns and the Democratic National Committee.
NDN has offices in Washington, D.C., New York City, San Francisco, and Miami. 

In 2000, the NDN was characterized as &quot;a group of pro-business Capitol Hill Democrats who borrow freely from the metaphors and values of the New Economy in their quest to modernize their party and wean it away from the labor unions and old-line liberals.&quot; Simon described the group as &quot;a venture capital fund for the Democratic Party.&quot;

==Involvement in the 2004 presidential election==
The NDN, while not supporting or embracing 2004 Democratic presidential primary candidate Howard Dean, pointed to his online network of small donors, volunteers, and bloggers as the model to emulate for the Democratic Party. In 2003, the NDN was described as challenging the DLC and becoming an increasingly influential player in the party&#x27;s politics.

In the 2004 United States presidential election, NDN led an effort to turn out Hispanic voters for John Kerry. Also in 2004, Rosenberg announced his candidacy for Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but eventually withdrew from the race after it became clear that he would lose to eventual Chairman Howard Dean. Rosenberg then supported Dean&#x27;s campaign.

<doc id="1078195" wikidata="Q1281666" url="?curid=1078195" title="All-inclusive resort">
<text>An all-inclusive resort is a holiday resort that generally includes, in the price of booking a stay, lodging, unlimited food and drinks, entertainment, and other recreational activities. They are often located in warmer regions of the world, particularly in the Mediterranean, Mexico and the Caribbean. 

Though some Butlin&#x27;s holiday camps in the U.K. had offered a similar concept in the 1930s, the modern all-inclusive resort has its origins in the 1950s with the foundation of the Club Med company by Belgian entrepreneur Gérard Blitz. Their first resort was opened in Alcúdia, Majorca, Spain in 1950, where guests stayed in tents and basic straw huts along the beach.

The concept has evolved over the decades. All-inclusives in the 1980s and 1990s were generally marketed towards singles, later on becoming more popular with couples and families.

Those geared toward families may have facilities like craft centers, game rooms, and water parks to keep children of all ages entertained. All-inclusive resorts geared towards couples are also popular locations for weddings and honeymoons.

== Resorts by type ==

=== All-inclusive resort ===
An all-inclusive resort, in addition to all the amenities of a resort, charges a fixed price that includes most or all items offered. At a minimum, most inclusive resorts include lodging, drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic), food (three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner), indoor and outdoor activities, and entertainment for a fixed price.

=== Destination resorts ===
They generally are called &quot;all-inclusive destination resorts&quot;. These facilities provide food, drink, lodging, sports, fitness programs and spas, entertainment, and shopping, with the advantage that guests do not have to leave the resort after arriving.

===Adults-only all-inclusive resorts===
In most cases, &quot;Adults Only&quot; means that resorts in this category do not admit children. The minimum age of admission varies from resort to resort but is usually 18 years of age or older.

==Criticisms==
It has been noted that, depending on the fine print, and the traveller&#x27;s individual interests - especially with respect to out-of-resort-trips - that an &quot;all-inclusive&quot; offer may eventually turn out more costly than a regular offer.

Also, ambiguity about what &quot;all-inclusive&quot; means sometimes leads to travelers being disappointed that services which they expected are not available or require payment of additional fees. For example, guests are often disappointed to learn that only &quot;cheap&quot; (i. e., &quot;well&quot; or &quot;bottom shelf&quot;) liquor is included, and that they must pay an upcharge for &quot;top-shelf&quot; alcohol.

<doc id="1078198" wikidata="Q13561063" url="?curid=1078198" title="Prime Minister of Iran">
<text>The prime minister of Iran was a political post that had existed in Iran (Persia) during much of the 20th century. It began in 1906 during the Qajar dynasty and into the start of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1923 and into the 1979 Iranian Revolution before being abolished in 1989.

==History of the office==

===Qajar era===

In the Qajar era, prime ministers were known by different titles. The post itself was mainly known as &quot;ataabak&quot; or &quot;ataabak-e a&#x27;zam&quot; (grand &quot;ataabak&quot;), or sometimes &quot;sadr-e a&#x27;zam&quot; (premier) at the beginning, but became &quot;ra&#x27;is ol-vozaraa&quot; (head of ministers) at the end. The title of &quot;nakhost vazir&quot; (prime minister) was rarely used. The prime minister was usually called by the honorific title &quot;hazrat-e ashraf&quot;. Reza Khan Sardar Sepah became the last prime minister of the Qajar dynasty in 1923.

For a list of Iranian &#x27;prime ministers&#x27; prior to 1907 see List of grand viziers of Persia.

===Pahlavi era===

In 1925, Reza Shah became the Shah of Iran. He installed Mohammad Ali Foroughi as the prime minister. In 1941 his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi became Shah. He installed Mohammad-Ali Foroughi as the prime minister too. In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh became Prime Minister but was overthrown in a counter-coup d&#x27;état in 1953. Amir-Abbas Hoveyda became Prime minister of Iran in 1965 and remained in office until 1977. Shapour Bakhtiar was the last Prime Minister of the Pahlavi era.

===Islamic Republic of Iran===
After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini installed Mehdi Bazargan as the Prime Minister of an interim government, which served until November 1979. The government resigned during the Iran hostage crisis, but mentioned that it has not been the sole reason, and the decision for mass resignation had been reached one day before the invasion of the United States embassy by the Iranian students.

The post was left empty until Abolhassan Banisadr became president in January 1980 and chose Mohammad-Ali Rajai as his prime minister, mainly because of pressures imposed by Majlis representatives, especially those close to the Islamic Republic Party. Rajai served in the post until Banisadr&#x27;s impeachment in June 1981, and was elected as president in the elections of July 24, 1981. Rajai chose Mohammad Javad Bahonar as his prime minister, but they were assassinated together in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office only a few weeks later on August 30, 1981.

When Ali Khamenei became president in the elections of October 1981, he first introduced right-leaning Ali Akbar Velayati to the Majlis as his prime minister, but he was voted down by the then left-leaning majority of the parliament, which then forced their preferred prime minister to Khamenei, namely Mir-Hossein Mousavi. The dispute finally ended following intervention by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, who advised the president to accept Mousavi.

Mousavi served under the title until 1989, when the constitution was amended to abolish the title of Prime Minister and divide his responsibilities between the president and a newly created title of first Vice President.

<doc id="1078205" wikidata="Q628566" url="?curid=1078205" title="Central Authentication Service">
<text>The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on protocol for the web. Its purpose is to permit a user to access multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as user ID and password) only once. It also allows web applications to authenticate users without gaining access to a user&#x27;s security credentials, such as a password. The name &quot;CAS&quot; also refers to a software package that implements this protocol.

==Description==
The CAS protocol involves at least three parties: a &quot;client&quot; web browser, the web &quot;application&quot; requesting authentication, and the &quot;CAS server&quot;. It may also involve a &quot;back-end service&quot;, such as a database server, that does not have its own HTTP interface but communicates with a web application.

When the client visits an application requiring authentication, the application redirects it to CAS. CAS validates the client&#x27;s authenticity, usually by checking a username and password against a database (such as Kerberos, LDAP or Active Directory).

If the authentication succeeds, CAS returns the client to the application, passing along a service ticket. The application then validates the ticket by contacting CAS over a secure connection and providing its own service identifier and the ticket. CAS then gives the application trusted information about whether a particular user has successfully authenticated.

CAS allows multi-tier authentication via proxy address. A cooperating &quot;back-end&quot; service, like a database or mail server, can participate in CAS, validating the authenticity of users via information it receives from web applications. Thus, a webmail client and a webmail server can all implement CAS.

==History==
CAS was conceived and developed by Shawn Bayern of Yale University Technology and Planning. It was later maintained by Drew Mazurek at Yale. CAS 1.0 implemented single-sign-on. CAS 2.0 introduced multi-tier proxy authentication. Several other CAS distributions have been developed with new features.

In December 2004, CAS became a project of the Java in Administration Special Interest Group (JASIG), which is as of 2008 responsible for its maintenance and development. Formerly called &quot;Yale CAS&quot;, CAS is now also known as &quot;Jasig CAS&quot;. In 2010, Jasig entered into talks with the Sakai Foundation to merge the two organizations. The two organizations were consolidated as Apereo Foundation in December 2012.

In December 2006, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded Yale its First Annual Mellon Award for Technology Collaboration, in the amount of $50,000, for Yale&#x27;s development of CAS. At the time of that award CAS was in use at &quot;hundreds of university campuses (among other beneficiaries)&quot;.

In April 2013, CAS Protocol specification 3.0 was released.

<text>RapidCAD is a specially packaged Intel 486DX and a dummy floating-point unit (FPU) designed as pin-compatible replacements for an Intel 80386 processor and 80387 FPU. Because the i486DX has a working on-chip FPU, a dummy FPU package (the &quot;RapidCAD-2&quot;) is supplied to go in the Intel 387 FPU socket. The dummy FPU is used to provide the FERR signal, necessary for compatibility purposes.

Despite being able to execute instructions in the same number of cycles as an i486DX, integer performance on RapidCAD suffers due to the absence of level 1 cache and the bottleneck of the 386 bus. RapidCAD offers minimal improvement in integer performance over a 386DX (typically 10%, at most 35%), but provides substantial improvement in floating-point operations (up to 80% faster) for which it was marketed. Floating-point performance is mostly improved by moving the FPU onto the CPU core. Other source reports that the performance range from 20 to 170 percent faster than the regular Intel386 DX based computers. It was available at manufacturer&#x27;s suggested list price of US$499.

<text>Antimycins are produced as secondary metabolites by &quot;Streptomyces&quot; bacteria, a soil bacteria. These specialized metabolites likely function to kill neighboring organisms in order to provide the streptomyces bacteria with a competitive edge.

== Chemical structures ==

==Biosynthesis==
Antimycins are produced by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) assembly complex which acts as an assembly line for antimycin production. The assembly is genetically coded for by the ant gene family. The assembly requires 14 proteins, AntBCDEFGHIJKLMNO, which shuttle the intermediates along the assembly line through a series of transesterifications, keto reductions, thiolations (addition of a sulfur containing group), condensations, and adenylations. The last two steps involving AntB and AntO are tailoring steps. The following steps describe chemically what the Ant Enzymes do in order to synthesize Antimycin. Synthesis begins with tryptophan, an amino acid.

1. The indole ring of tryptophan, an amino acid, is opened by a pathway-specific tryptophan-2.3-dioxygnease, AntN, to make N-formyl-L-kynurenine.

2. N-formyl-L-kynurenine is converted to anthranilate by the pathway-specific kynureninase, AntP.

3. Anthranilate is activated by the acyl-CoA ligase protein, AntF and loaded onto its cognate carrier protein, AntG, for further processing.

4. Anthranilate is converted to 3-aminosalicylate by a multicomponent oxygenase, AntHIJKL.

5. 3-Aminosalicylate is presented to the NRPS, AntC. AntC has two modules which are organized Condensation1 (C1) -Adenylation1 (A1) -Thiolation1 (T1) -Condensation2 (C2) -Adenylation2 (A2) -Ketoreduction (KR) -Thiolation2 (T2). The A1 domain activates and loads threonine, an amino acid, onto T1, followed by a C1 promoted condensation of 3-aminosalicylate and threonine. The A2 domain activates and loads pyruvate onto T2. Pyruvate is reduced by the KR domain and condensed with threonine by C2 

6. The Ketosynthase domain of PKS catalyses the decarboxylative condensation between the aminoacyl thioester attached to AntC T2 domain and the 2-carboxy-acyl moiety attached to AntD Acetyl Carrier Protein domain.

7. AntM catalyses the reduction of the β-keto group, which precedes the AntD TE domain – promoted release of the nine-membered dilactone

8. A lipase homologue, AntO, and acyltransferase homologue, AntB, catalyze the installation of the N-formyl group and the transesterification of the C-8 hydroxyl group, respectively, resulting in the backbone for the Antimycin family.

<text>Southpark Village is a housing estate in the Darnley area of the Scottish city of Glasgow. The northwestern area was built during the mid to late 1980s, but the southeastern part was built in the late 2010s. It is located on the south-western edge of the city, close to the towns of Barrhead and Newton Mearns in East Renfrewshire. Nearby areas within Glasgow itself are the rest of Darnley to the north, Deaconsbank to the east, and Parkhouse to the northwest, although Southpark is physically separated from all but the rest of Darnley by the Dams to Darnley Country Park and M77 motorway.

==History==

The entire area was once owned by Lord Darnley, who ran linen works in the area. The remains of a large house can be found a few miles south of the village, and this appears to have belonged to Lord Darnley himself.

In later years the surrounding area was extensively quarried for limestone and mined for coal; During the late stages of the life of the mine, a catastrophic explosion occurred killing many local miners. A monument to those lost in the disaster currently sits on the Nitshill Road (A726) beside the train station at Nitshill, north west of Southpark. The consequences of this disaster and the subsequent abandonment of the mine have been felt as recently as the late 1990s when a mine shaft collapsed in an area near the estate, leading to a massive landfill operation which successfully prevented the land around the shaft from collapsing any further.

==Characteristics==
Most homes in the area are occupied by private owners who are within working class or lower/medium-middle class income brackets. The neighbourhood is conveniently located for commuting to work by car via the M77 motorway and is also fairly close to suburban railway stations (Nitshill and Priesthill &amp; Darnley).

Like much of Glasgow since the mid-20th century, the area is ethnically diverse. Southpark falls under the council tax bracket of Glasgow City Council, within its Greater Pollok ward. The area has many communal landscaped areas that are maintained through financial contributions by the residents of the estate.

There is a retail park to the north of the housing, consisting of large Sainsbury&#x27;s, fast food outlets and a pub/restaurant. It was built on the site of the &quot;Darnley Mains&quot; farm. To the southeast of this retail area there is a large B&amp;Q store.

Land to the east of B&amp;Q - directly adjacent to the motorway - was designated for further retail for some years, but failed to attract investors for this use (likely due in part to the busy Silverburn Centre at the next junction north) so was reallocated for new housing in the late 2010s. At that time another residential development between the existing Southpark neighbourhood and the Darnley Mains site, &quot;Glenmill&quot; (320 houses) was also constructed by Persimmon Homes and Bellway.

<text>A green lane is a type of road in the United Kingdom, usually an unmetalled or unpaved rural route.

==England and Wales==
In particular, a green lane is unmetalled, and may be so infrequently used that there is no wearing of the surface, allowing vegetation to colonise freely, hence &quot;green&quot;. Many green lanes are ancient routes that have existed for millennia, such as hollow ways, drover&#x27;s roads, ridgeways and even ancient trackways.

Under modern public rights-of-way (PROW) law, the expression &quot;green lane&quot; has no legal meaning. Instead, there are four different types of public right of way, listed below, in addition to public roads:

* A footpath has pedestrian rights only.
* A bridleway allows pedestrians, horse traffic and cyclists.
* A byway open to all traffic (BOAT, or just &#x27;byway&#x27;) is open to all users and all types of traffic. However, as they are unsurfaced, they are often only passable in a 4×4 or on a trail motorbike, as well as by pedestrians and horse riders.
* A restricted byway (RB) allows pedestrians, horse traffic and vehicles other than mechanically propelled vehicles (e.g. bicycles, horse-drawn carriages). Restricted byways replaced the older road used as a public path (RUPP) classification.

An unclassified county road (UCR) is an obsolete expression and is no indication of a right of way, although they may be maintained and repaired at public expense by local highway authorities. The surfaces of these routes can vary from broken tarmac and gravel to only grass, often having the appearance of byways. As these routes are maintained at public expense, along with the rest of the highway network, it is presumed that these routes are open to all traffic. They are not shown on the definitive map.

The Countryside Act 1968 required all highway authorities to reclassify RUPPs in their area—occasionally as footpaths but in practice generally as bridleways, unless public vehicular rights were demonstrated to exist, in which case the road was classified as a byway open to all traffic. This process involved extensive research into historic usage and often public enquiries. Section 47 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 set a time limit of 2026 for every highway authority to complete the reclassification exercise. The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 (NERC) changed the deadline to 2 May 2006.

This change is significant as RUPPs allowed motorised vehicular access, while restricted byways do not. This change resulted in some conflict between user groups. Some highway authorities neglected to carry out their responsibilities under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. This has meant that some counties, e.g. Somerset, have minimal off-road rights of way available to motorised vehicles, while other counties, e.g. Kent and Wiltshire, have a considerably more extensive network still available to vehicular users. It is calculated that before the CRoW Act approximately 5% of the national rights of way network was open to vehicular use, while post-CRoW this has halved to around 2 to 3%.

The various users of rights of way disagree (often passionately) about the other users&#x27; rights. Walkers&#x27; groups (such as the Ramblers&#x27; Association) advocate the removal of vehicular rights on BOATs. Cyclists&#x27; and equestrians&#x27; groups fear for their rights, while vehicular use of public rights of way is increasingly being seen as unacceptable and has been targeted for further restrictions. The rights of vehicle users are represented by the Green Lane Association, also known as GLASS, All Terrain UK and the Trail Riders Fellowship, who oppose these restrictions on the basis that a road is just that, regardless of the type of surface.

==Jersey==
In Jersey, a Green Lane is a road designated as priority for pedestrians, cyclists and horse-riders to which a speed limit applies. The first Green Lanes were introduced in St Peter in 1994. All parishes, except St Saviour and Trinity, have since joined the Green Lane network, but since St Saviour and Trinity adjoin across the Island the Green Lanes in the West and in the East do not link up.

<text>The Colt Buntline Special was a long-barreled variant of the Colt Single Action Army revolver, which Stuart N. Lake described in his best-selling but largely fictionalized 1931 biography, &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;. According to Lake, the dime novelist Ned Buntline commissioned the production of five Buntline Specials. Lake described them as extra-long Colt Single Action Army revolvers, with a 12-inch (300 mm)-long barrel, and stated that Buntline presented them to five lawmen in thanks for their help in contributing local color to his western yarns.

Lake attributed the gun to Wyatt Earp, but modern researchers have not found any supporting evidence from secondary sources or in available primary documentation of the gun&#x27;s existence prior to the publication of Lake&#x27;s book. After its publication, various Colt revolvers with long (10-inch or 16-inch) barrels were called Colt Buntlines or Buntline Specials. Colt manufactured the pistol among its second-generation revolvers produced after 1956. A number of other manufacturers, such as Uberti, Navy Arms, and Cimarron Arms, have made their own versions of this long-barreled revolver.

== Origin ==

The revolver was first described by Stuart Lake in his highly fictionalized 1931 biography &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;. The extremely popular book turned Wyatt Earp into a &quot;Western superman&quot;. Lake&#x27;s creative biography and later Hollywood portrayals exaggerated Wyatt&#x27;s profile as a western lawman.
Lake wrote that dime novelist Edward Zane Carroll Judson Sr., writing under the pseudonym of Ned Buntline, commissioned the guns in repayment for &quot;material for hundreds of frontier yarns.&quot; Although Ned Buntline wrote somewhere between twenty and twenty-four western novelettes and dime novels, the most sensational about William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, who Buntline made nationally famous, none mentions Wyatt Earp. Lake claims that Ned Buntline traveled to Dodge City and made the presentations there, then went on up to North Platte, Nebraska, where he made a similar presentation to Cody. But Buntline traveled west of the Mississippi only once in his life, in 1869, in fact, and at the time of the supposed presentation to Earp in Dodge City, Wyatt and his brother were actually in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, mining for gold. Actually Earp was under indictment for murder in Dodge City at the time. As for Cody, he wasn&#x27;t in North Platte, either, but was in Wyoming scouting for the US Cavalry in pursuit of Sitting Bull and the Cheyenne and Sioux bands that had wiped out Custer at the Little Bighorn the previous summer. According to descendants of Wyatt Earp&#x27;s cousins, he owned a Colt .45-caliber and a Winchester lever-action shotgun.

There is no conclusive evidence as to the kind of pistol that Earp usually carried though, according to some sources, on the day of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, October 26, 1881, he carried a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3 with an 8-inch (200 mm) barrel. Earp had received the revolver as a gift from Tombstone mayor and newspaper editor John Clum of &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; . Lake later admitted that he had &quot;put words into Wyatt&#x27;s mouth because of the inarticulateness and monosyllabic way he had of talking&quot;.

The book later inspired a number of stories, movies, and television programs about outlaws and lawmen in Dodge City and Tombstone, including the 1955–1961 television series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;.

=== Description ===
Lake conceived the idea of a revolver that would be more precise and could be easily modified to work similarly to a rifle. According to Lake, the Colt Buntline was a single-action revolver chambered for .45 Long Colt cartridge. However, it had a 12-inch-long (305 mm) barrel, in comparison to the Colt Peacemaker&#x27;s 7.5-inch (190 mm) barrel. A 16-inch (406 mm) barrel was available, as well. According to Lake, it had a removable stock that could be easily affixed through a combination of screws and lead-ins. This accessory gave the revolver better precision and range, Lake claimed, and allowed the user to fire it like a rifle. The Colt Buntline was further popularized by &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot; television series.

=== Alleged presentation to lawmen ===
Lake wrote that Ned Buntline commissioned the revolvers in 1876 and that he presented them to Wyatt Earp and four other well-known western lawmen — Bat Masterson, Bill Tilghman, Charlie Bassett, and Neal Brown. However, neither Tilghman nor Brown were lawmen at that time. According to Lake, Earp kept his pistol at the original 12-inch length, but the four other recipients of the Specials cut their barrels down to the standard inches, or shorter.

Lake spent much effort trying to track down the Buntline Special through the Colt company, Masterson, and contacts in Alaska. Lake described it as a Colt Single Action Army model with a long, barrel, standard sights, and wooden grips into which the name “Ned” was ornately carved. Researchers have never found any record of an order received by the Colt company, and Ned Buntline&#x27;s alleged connections to Earp have been largely discredited.

=== Colt records ===
The revolver could have been specially ordered from the Colt factory in Hartford, Connecticut, as extra-long barrels were available from Colt at a dollar an inch over . Several such revolvers with 16-inch barrels and detachable stocks were displayed at the 1876 Centennial Exposition, but these were marketed as &quot;Buggy rifles&quot;. There are no company records for the Buntline Special, nor a record of any orders from or sent to Ned Buntline. This does not absolutely preclude the historicity of the revolvers, however. Massad Ayoob writing for &quot;Guns Magazine&quot; cited notes by Josie Earp in which she mentioned an extra-long revolver as a favorite of Wyatt Earp. He cited an order by Tombstone, Arizona, bartender Buckskin Frank Leslie for a revolver of near-identical description. This order predated the O.K. Corral fight by several months.

== Replicas ==
In the 1950s, Colt resumed manufacture of the Single Action Army and made a Buntline version, due to customer demand. The barrels are marked on the left side &quot;COLT BUNTLINE SPECIAL .45&quot;. A few third-generation Buntlines were manufactured in the late 1970s, as well. Colt manufactured 70 New Frontier Buntline Specials from 1962 to 1967 with 12-inch barrels and folding target sights, chambered in .45 Colt.

The 1873 Buntline Target is an Italian 6-shot single-action revolver chambered for the .357 Magnum or the .45 Colt cartridges, manufactured by A. Uberti, Srl. The revolver has an 18-inch barrel with no muzzle brake or ports. It comes with a walnut grip and a dark blue finish.

The Navy Arms Frontier Buntline Model is a 6-shot single-action revolver chambered for the .357 Magnum or the .45 Colt cartridges, manufactured for Navy Arms. The revolver has a 16.5-inch barrel with no muzzle brake or ports. It comes with a walnut grip and a detachable shoulder stock.

Cimarron Firearms offers a version called the Wyatt Earp Buntline styled after the one used by Kurt Russell in the 1993 movie &quot;Tombstone&quot; with a 10-inch barrel and a silver badge inlaid on the right grip panel.

<text>William Avery &quot;Devil Bill&quot; Rockefeller Sr. (November 13, 1810 – May 11, 1906) was an American businessman, lumberman, herbalist, salesman, and con artist who went by the alias of Dr. William Levingston. He worked as a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a &quot;botanic physician&quot; and sold elixirs. He was known to buy and sell horses, and was also known at one point to have bought a barge-load of salt in Syracuse. Land speculation was another type of his business, and the selling of elixirs served to keep him with cash and aided in his scouting of land deals. He loaned money to farmers at twelve percent, but tried to lend to farmers who could not pay so as to foreclose and take the farms. Two of his sons were Standard Oil co-founders John Davison Rockefeller Sr. and William Avery Rockefeller Jr.

== Family ==
William Avery Rockefeller was born in Ancram, New York. He was the eldest son of businessman/farmer Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller (September 24, 1783 in Albany, New York – September 28, 1857 in Richford, New York) and Lucy Avery (February 11, 1786 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts – April 6, 1867). Godfrey and Lucy had married on September 20, 1806, in Amwell, Hunterdon County, New Jersey. Bill had two elder sisters—Melinda and Olympia—as well as seven younger siblings; Norman, Sally, Jacob, Mary, Miles, Mary Miranda, and Egbert.

== Ancestry ==
The Rockefellers trace their patrilineal line to Goddard Rockefeller (born Gotthard Rockenfeller; 1590) of Fahr, today part of Neuwied, Germany, and the now deserted village of Rockenfeld as namesake. The first Rockefeller to emigrate to America (1723) was Johann Peter Rockenfeller (1710 in Segendorf, Neuwied – 1787 in Amwell Township, New Jersey), who changed his name to Rockefeller. Godfrey Lewis Rockefeller was a son of distant cousins William Rockefeller (1750–1793) and Christina Rockefeller (1754–1800). Lucy Avery was born to Miles Avery and Melinda Pixley, New England Yankees of mostly English descent, being a descendant of James Avery.

== Marriage and children ==
Rockefeller married his first wife, Eliza Davison, on February 18, 1837 in Niles, Cayuga Co., New York. Rockefeller met Eliza on one of his business trips in Upstate New York. It is said that Rockefeller pulled out a slate and chalk to communicate when he arrived at the Davison residence, as he often pretended to be deaf and dumb on his selling trips. Eliza is to have supposedly remarked, &quot;If that man were not deaf and dumb, I&#x27;d marry him.&quot;

The couple had three sons and three daughters: 
*Lucy Rockefeller (1838–1878), married Pierson Briggs
*John Davison Rockefeller Sr. (1839–1937), married Laura Celestia &quot;Cettie&quot; Spelman 
*William Avery Rockefeller Jr. (1841–1922), married Almira Geraldine Goodsell
*Mary Ann Rockefeller (1843–1925), married William Cullen Rudd Sr.
*Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Rockefeller (1845–1917) [twin]
*Frances Rockefeller (1845–1847) [twin]

Bill once bragged, &quot;I cheat my boys every chance I get. I want to make &#x27;em sharp.&quot; Although Bill abandoned the family while Lucy, John, and William Jr. were teenagers, he remained legally married to Eliza until her death. In 1856, having assumed the name Dr. William Levingston, he married Margaret Allen in Norwich, Ontario, Canada. Bill and Margaret had no children together. Before leaving his first wife, he also had two daughters with his mistress and housekeeper Nancy Brown:
*Clorinda Rockefeller (c. 1838–?, died young)
*Cornelia Rockefeller (c. 1840–?)

Before marrying Eliza, Bill had been in love with Nancy. However, he ended up marrying Eliza since her father was to give her $500 when she married, and Nancy was poor.

When John D. Rockefeller started his own produce commission business with Maurice B. Clark in 1859, Clark initiated the idea of the partnership and offered $2,000 towards the goal. John D. Rockefeller had only $800 saved up at the time and so borrowed $1,000 from his father, &quot;Big Bill&quot; Rockefeller, at 10 percent interest.

Bill visited with his grandchildren at the Forest Hill estate in Cleveland and at Pocantico Hills in Tarrytown. He taught his grandchildren how to shoot and played fiddle in the evenings for them. Prior to Bill&#x27;s visits, John D. would invite some of Bill&#x27;s Upstate New York relatives and friends.

== Scandal ==
On July 26, 1849, in the city of Auburn, New York, William was indicted for a rape which had occurred at gunpoint. His victim had worked in the Rockefeller household; her name was Ann Vanderbeak. In the 1905 book &quot;Memoirs of an American Citizen&quot;, Robert Herrick says an improper relationship had been rumoured to exist.

The court document reads, &quot;That William A. Rockefeller late of the Town of Moravia in the County of Cayuga, on the first day of May in the year of the Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty eight, with force and arms at the Town of Moravia in said County, in and upon one Ann Vanderbeak in the Peace of God with the People of the State of New York then and there being, violently did make an assault on her, the said Ann Venderbeak, then and there make violently and against her will feloniously did ravish and carnally know […]&quot;. William Cooper, the Rockefeller family doctor, was also indicted for assault and battery with the intention of raping Ann Vanderbeak.

Because of the allegations, William sold the Moravia home and moved to Owego, New York, possibly to avoid trial, under the pretence of providing better opportunities for the boys. Four days later, Eliza&#x27;s father sued Bill in the Supreme Court of Cayuga for failure to pay a $1,175 debt. His plea states that Bill had asked him for help with his bail for the rape charges, but that Eliza&#x27;s father had not seen Bill since. Eliza also informed authorities that her husband had &quot;absconded and cannot now be found within the state.&quot; William assumed the title Doctor Bill Levingston and worked as a travelling snake oil specialist. Although nothing came of the charges, William left the family penniless.

After hearing rumours that John D. Rockefeller—then the richest man in the world at the height of his fame—had a shameful family secret, the press went into a frenzy. Joseph Pulitzer offered a reward of $8,000 for information about &quot;Doc Rockefeller,&quot; who was known to be alive and living under a false name, but whose whereabouts were a family secret. Despite slender clues picked up from interviews with family members and an 18-month search, the journalists failed to track him down before he died. The full story was not exposed until two years later.

== Death ==
Rockefeller had spent some time in Park River, North Dakota under the Levingston alias. He died on May 11, 1906, in Freeport, Illinois, at the age of 95. He was buried there in Oakland Cemetery. John D. Rockefeller never publicly acknowledged the truth about his father&#x27;s life as a bigamist, and the cost for Bill&#x27;s grave marker was paid by the second wife&#x27;s estate.

<text>Samuel Ward (May 25, 1725 – March 26, 1776) was an American farmer, politician, Rhode Island Supreme Court justice, governor of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, and delegate to the Continental Congress where he signed the Continental Association. He was the son of Rhode Island Governor Richard Ward, was well-educated, and grew up in a large family in Newport, Rhode Island. He and his wife received property in Westerly, Rhode Island from his father-in-law, and the couple settled there and took up farming. He entered politics as a young man and soon took sides in the hard money vs. paper money controversy, favoring hard money or specie. His primary rival over the money issue was Providence politician Stephen Hopkins, and the two men became bitter rivals; the two also alternated as governors of the colony for several terms.

During this time of political activity, Ward became a founder and trustee of Brown University. The most contentious issue that he faced during his three years as governor involved the Stamp Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament just before he took office for the second time. The Stamp Act placed a tax on all official documents and newspapers, infuriating the American colonists by being done without their consent. Representatives of the colonies met to discuss the act, but when it came time for the governors to take a position, Ward was the only one who stood firm against it, threatening his position but bringing him recognition as a great Patriot.

Ward&#x27;s final term as governor ended in 1767, after which he retired to work on his farm in Westerly. On August 5, 1769, he was baptized at the age of 44 in the old church of Westerly as a Seventh Day Baptist.

He was called back into service in 1774 as a delegate to the Continental Congress. War was looming with England, and to this end he devoted all of his energy. After hostilities began, Ward stated, &quot;&#x27;Heaven save my country,&#x27; is my first, my last, and almost my only prayer.&quot; He died of smallpox during a meeting of the Congress in Philadelphia, three months before the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and was buried in a local cemetery. His remains were later re-interred in the Common Burying Ground in Newport.

Ward was born in Newport in the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1725, the son of Rhode Island Colonial Governor Richard Ward. His mother Mary Tillinghast was the daughter of John Tillinghast and Isabel Sayles, and a granddaughter of Pardon Tillinghast who had come from Seven Cliffs, Sussex, England. She was a granddaughter of John Sayles and Mary Williams, and a great-granddaughter of Rhode Island founder Roger Williams, making Ward the great-great-grandson of the colony&#x27;s founder. Ward&#x27;s great-grandfather John Ward was born in Gloucester, England and had been an officer in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s army, but he came to the American colonies following the accession of King Charles II.

Ward was the ninth of 14 children. He grew up in a home of liberal tastes and cultivated manners, and he was trained under the discipline and instruction of a celebrated grammar school in his home town. He may also have been tutored by his older brother Thomas, who had graduated from Harvard College in 1733. As a young man, Ward married Anne Ray, the daughter of a well-to-do farmer on Block Island, from whom the couple received land in Westerly where they settled as farmers. He devoted much effort to improving the breeds of domestic animals, and he raised a breed of racehorse known as the Narraganset Pacer.

== Family and legacy ==

Samuel and Anna Ward had 11 children. Their second son Samuel Ward, Jr. served as the lieutenant colonel of the 1st Rhode Island Regiment in the Continental Army. A great-granddaughter was Julia Ward Howe who composed the &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. Ward&#x27;s aunt Mary Ward married Sion Arnold, a grandson of Governor Benedict Arnold.

In 1937, the town of Westerly honored Ward&#x27;s memory by dedicating its high school to him. It was renamed Westerly High School in the late 20th century, but the main auditorium was given his name.

== Political life ==

Ward first became active in politics in 1756 when he was elected as a deputy from Westerly. The divisive political issue of the day was the use of hard money (or specie) versus paper money, and Ward sided with the specie group. His chief rival was Stephen Hopkins of Providence who sided with paper money. So bitter was the animosity between these two men that Hopkins commenced an action for slander against Ward. The case was moved to Massachusetts for a fair trial, and the judgment went against Hopkins by default in 1759.

For ten years, the two men went back and forth as governor of the colony, each at the head of a powerful party. Josias Lyndon was elected as a compromise candidate in 1768, and the constant butting heads stopped. Hopkins won the election as governor in 1758 and beat Ward again in the following three elections. In 1761, the Assembly named Ward to the office of chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, but he only served in this capacity for a year, finally being elected governor in 1762. During his first year in office, Ward supported the idea of establishing a college in Rhode Island Colony, and he took an active part in the establishment of &quot;Rhode island College,&quot; later Brown University. The school was incorporated in 1765 and he was one of the trustees and one of its most generous supporters.

=== Stamp Act ===

In 1763, Hopkins once again beat out Ward in the election for governor, serving for the next two years. However, in 1765, Ward won the contest for the second time. During this term, one of the most contentious issues of the age arose, uniting the divided elements into a common cause when both houses of the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act. This act was a scheme for taxing the colonies, directing that all commercial and legal documents must be written on stamped paper sold at fixed prices by governmental officers, and also directing that a duty be applied to newspapers. Parliament assumed the right to tax the colonies and put additional duties on sugar, coffee, and other articles. The government also required that lumber and iron from the colonies be exported solely to England.

The news of the act infuriated the colonists. Samuel Adams of Massachusetts invited all the colonies to a congress of delegates to meet in New York to discuss relief from the unjust taxes. In August 1765, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed resolutions following the lead of Patrick Henry of Virginia. Rhode Island&#x27;s appointed stamp distributor was Attorney General Augustus Johnson, but he refused to execute his office &quot;against the will of our Sovereign Lord the People.&quot; The Rhode Island General Assembly met again at East Greenwich in September 1765, choosing delegates to the New York congress and appointing a committee to consider the Stamp Act. The committee reported six resolutions that pointed to the absolution of allegiance to the British Crown unless the grievances were removed.

The day before the act was to become effective, all of the royal governors took an oath to sustain it. Among the colonial governors, only Samuel Ward of Rhode Island refused the act. In so doing, he forfeited his position and was threatened with a huge fine, but this did not deter him. The act was ultimately repealed, with news reaching the colonies in May 1766 to public rejoicing. The conflict for independence was delayed but not abandoned.

=== Continental Congress ===

In the 1767 election, Ward once again lost to his nemesis, but Hopkins would not seek re-election after 1768. Eventually, the two great rivals established friendly relations. The famous controversy was replaced by a more momentous struggle soon to involve the colony. Governor Ward retired to his estate in Westerly but became active again in 1774. At a town meeting in May of that year, the freemen of Providence formally proposed a Continental Congress for the union of the colonies, the first such act in favor of this measure, though the idea had already been circulating in several of the colonies. As plans solidified, the General Assembly met the following month in Newport and elected Ward and Hopkins as delegates.

Ward served on several important committees, including the &quot;Committee on Secrets&quot;, and he was a delegate when the Congress met as a committee of the whole. He devoted all of his energy to the Continental Congress, until his untimely death from smallpox at a meeting of the convention in Philadelphia. Ward died a little more than three months before the Declaration of Independence was signed. He was originally buried in Philadelphia but was reinterred in the Common Burying Ground in Newport, Rhode Island in 1860.

<text>USS &quot;Boggs&quot; (DD–136) was a in the United States Navy, later redesignated as AG-19 and then as DMS-3, and back again to AG-19. She was the first ship named for Admiral Charles Boggs.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Boggs&quot; was launched on 25 April 1918 by Mare Island Navy Yard, sponsored by Miss Ruth Hascal. The ship was commissioned on 23 September 1918.

==Service history==
===Pre-World War II===
&quot;Boggs&quot; departed San Diego in March 1919 for a six-month cruise along the United States East Coast, in the North Atlantic, and in the Caribbean Sea. Upon her return she served with the Pacific Fleet until being placed out of commission on 29 June 1922. Redesignated a miscellaneous auxiliary (AG-19) on 5 September 1931, she was re-commissioned on 19 December 1931 and assigned to Mobile Target Division 1, Battle Force, for high-speed radio control tests, target towing, and minesweeping. Except for a cruise to the U.S. East Coast from January to October 1934, she served off the West Coast of the United States until 1940. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 11 September 1940. Late in 1940, she was reclassified a high-speed minesweeper and received the new hull classification symbol DMS-3.

===World War II===
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 found &quot;Boggs&quot; at sea, but she returned later in the day to sweep the approaches and anchorage. She remained at Pearl Harbor on minesweeping, patrol, and training duty until January 1943 when she made a run to Canton Island, Phoenix Islands, with supplies. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 March 1943, and for the next year served in the vicinity as a patrol vessel, minesweeper, and towboat. She served as a target towing vessel with the Operational Training Command out of San Diego (12 April 1944 – March 1945).

Following at San Pedro, Los Angeles, from March through June 1945, she was stripped of her sweeping gear and reclassified AG-19, 5 June 1945. Fitted for high-speed target towing, &quot;Boggs&quot; arrived at Eniwetok, Marshall Islands, via Pearl Harbor, on 15 August 1945. She remained at Eniwetok until 6 October 1945 and then returned to the United States, arriving in early 1946. &quot;Boggs&quot; was decommissioned on 20 March 1946 and sold for scrap on 27 November 1946.

<doc id="1078243" wikidata="Q3165416" url="?curid=1078243" title="Jean-François Papillon">
<text>Jean-François Papillon (died in the early 1800s) was one of the principal leaders in the Haitian Revolution against slavery and French rule. He led the initial uprising of enslaved workers and later allied with Spain against the French.

He was born in Africa but enslaved and taken in captivity to the North Province of Saint-Domingue (the future nation of Haiti). There he worked in the plantation of Papillon in the last decades of the 18th Century. He escaped from that plantation and became a maroon, so when the revolution started in August 1791 he had already enjoyed a direct experience of freedom.

== Ascent to power ==

Right after the tragic death of Boukman Dutty, the insurgent slaves’ first leader, Jean-François Papillon imposed his authority over the other black generals, especially Georges Biassou, Jeannot Bullet, and Toussaint Bréda (later Toussaint Louverture), and became commander-in-chief of the Haitian former slaves. By late 1791, some weeks after the revolutionary outbreak, Jean-François and Biassou set their rivalry aside in order to oppose Jeannot, who not only massacred the French but also all the black soldiers that contested his authority. For that reason, Biassou and Jean-François arrested and executed him by November 1791. 
It has often been assumed that Jean-François and his men rose up in rebellion to win universal freedom, but their real intention was to gain as much power as possible and return the rest of the slaves to the plantations when the revolution was over and the generals had already achieved power. Jean-François confessed his convictions to the North American agents in Le Cap Français: “[...] that General told us that he had not created himself General of the negroes, that those who had that power had confered [sic] upon him that title; that in taking up arms, he never pretended to fight for General Liberty, which he knew to be an illusion.&quot;

== Relation with Spain ==

There are many reasons that the Spaniards backed the Haitian revolution from the beginning, providing the insurgents with food and weapons: they knew that the episode would cause chaos in Saint-Domingue, giving Spain the chance to send troops to that territory and re-annex it, since it had been a Spanish possession taken by the French in the Peace Treaty of Ryswick (1697). In October 1791, the black General Toussaint Bréda admitted his contacts with the Spaniards, who had promised them provisions. As Spain was officially neutral towards the French Revolution, of which Saint-Domingue’s revolution was regarded as a mere echo, it kept its contacts with the black leaders in secret.

Spain’s attitude changed from late January 1793, when the French National Convention executed Louis XVI. From then on, the Spanish government considered that it was unnecessary to stay officially neutral towards France and both countries declared war on each other in March 1793. As a consequence, Charles IV of Spain issued his instructions to the Dominican authorities, which needed to begin official dealings with Saint-Domingue’s black generals to persuade them to join the Dominican army.

Negotiations, which were carried out by the mulatto priest José Vázquez, finished on May 6, 1793 with Jean-François’ oath of loyalty to the Spanish King in his name and in the name of his soldiers. The said oath was confirmed by Jean-François some days later, in an official letter addressed to the Dominican Archbishop, Fernando del Portillo y Torres. Nevertheless, the slave leaders made it clear that they did not support the Spanish King as an end in itself, but as a means of avenging the French King, the Spanish sovereign’s cousin.

== Triumphs and problems at the service of Spain ==

Jean-François and his collaborators became Carlos IV’s black auxiliary troops, since the colour of their skin prevented the Spaniards from considering them part of the colonial regular army. Their alliance to Spain was crucial for the Spanish army to make important progress in Hispaniola against the French, conquering important positions like Gonaïves, Gros-Morne, Plaisance, Acul, Limbé, Port-Margot, Borgne, Petit-Saint-Louis and Terre-Neuve.

Nevertheless, there had always existed a strong tension between Jean-François and Biassou that led to an armed confrontation in September 1793. Both generals confronted each other and the French took advantage of the instability within the black auxiliaries to re-conquer the Tannerie fort, recently occupied by Jean-François’ troops. That episode convinced the Dominican government of the necessity to put an end to the internal tension of the black army, which was achieved thanks to the intervention of the Dominican Brigadier Matías de Armona, who persuaded them to meet in Dondon and come to an agreement by late November 1793.

In the following weeks, the black auxiliaries achieved many other victories at the service of Spain, especially the conquest of Port Margot at the beginning in 1794, which earned them several golden and silver medals given by the Spanish Crown.

== Bayajá ==

The prestige of the black auxiliaries started to decay in July 1794, after the massacre of Bayajá. This place had been a French possession (Fort Dauphin) until the Spaniards conquered it in January 1794. At that moment, the authorities of the village asked the Spaniards to not let Jean-François’ troops enter the place in the future, because they were afraid that the latter would massacre them, provided that most of its inhabitants were the former owners of Jean-François’ collaborators, and also that one of the officers that surrendered the city to Spain was the mulato Candy, Jean-François’ former subordinate that had deserted to the French camp.

Despite the described circumstances, on July 7, 1794 Jean-François entered the place with his troops and massacred the French inhabitants, mostly, though many Spaniards died also in the episode. The Spanish garrison of the place did not interfere to stop the killing, for which they were criticised by other foreign governments that even accused Spain of supporting the killing from the shadow.

From that moment on, not only did the Spaniards realise that the black auxiliaries were dangerous, but they also prevented them from taking part in any other important campaign in the future, so that such abuses would not occur again.

== Basel and the diaspora of the auxiliaries ==

The Spaniards’ awareness of the black auxiliaries’ “natural savagery” as well as Santo Domingo’s cession to France in the Peace Treaty of Basel, persuaded them to get rid of Jean-François and his troops, since the circumstances that had justified their alliance to the former slaves, that is, Spain’s plan to conquer the western part of Hispaniola, had failed.

First, Jean-François and his main collaborators were taken to Havana. But the Cuban governor, Luis de las Casas, was so afraid that their presence there would provoke a massive black insurrection in that island, that he pressured the Spanish government to throw them out of his colony.

In March 1796 they arrived to the Spanish city of Cádiz, where they were kept almost as prisoners. Their situation in that city was dramatic: the generals lost their military ranks and their right to any economic compensation after their retirement and, in addition, Jean-François had to use the few resources he had to assist his family and his companions.

In 1813, the Spanish Council of Regency decided to throw them out of that city and take them to the Coast of the Flies. Unfortunately, Jean-François never saw the resolution of the conflict that concerned his troops, as he had already died in the early days of the 19th Century, maybe in 1805, totally forgotten by the Spanish government, which “rewarded” him for his loyal services by denying any official link with him or any other slave general in the past.

<doc id="1078246" wikidata="Q3102316" url="?curid=1078246" title="Georges Biassou">
<text>George Biassou (1 January 1741 – 14 July 1801) was an early leader of the 1791 slave rising in Saint-Domingue that began the Haitian Revolution. With Jean-François and Jeannot, he was prophesied by the vodou priest Dutty Boukman to lead the revolution.

Like some other slave leaders, he fought with the Spanish royalists against the French Revolutionary authorities in colonial Haiti. Defeated by his former ally Toussaint Louverture, who had allied with the French after they promised to free the slaves, Biassou remained in service to the Spanish Crown. He withdrew from Santo Domingo in 1795 and moved with his family to Florida, which was then part of the Spanish colony of Cuba.

In Florida, Biassou changed his first name to Jorge. Spanish leaders put him in charge of the black militia in Florida. He began to build alliances there when his brother-in-law married a fugitive from South Carolina. Florida had provided refuge for both planters and slaves during the American Revolution.

Georges Biassou was born in 1741 on the island of Hispaniola, as a slave on a sugar plantation in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, modern day Haiti. He was an early leader of the 1791 slave revolt in Saint-Domingue, in which he and his fellow leaders, Jean-François Papillon and Jeannot Bullet, killed the plantation owners to whom they were enslaved. This ultimately led to the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804). Biassou and Jean-François offered to cease the revolt, in exchange for emancipation, however France was preoccupied with multiple wars, and hence dismissed this proposal. In 1793, a war between France and Spain manifested in Hispaniola. Biassou and his fellow revolutionaries were requested to aid Spain in fighting against France in exchange for freedom, to which they agreed. France abolished slavery throughout its empire in 1794, however Biassou remained loyal to Spain.

In 1796, Biassou relocated to St. Augustine, Florida, where he became the general of the free black militia stationed at Fort Matanzas. He died there in 1801.

== Saint-Domingue ==
Georges Biassou was born in 1741 in Saint-Domingue, Hispaniola. Hispaniola is an island which previously consisted of Saint-Domingue on the western third, and Santo Domingo on the east. Saint-Domingue is now recognised as the Republic of Haiti, and Santo Domingo as the Dominican Republic. The island lies in the Greater Antilles, a group of islands in the Caribbean Sea and part of the West Indies. Saint-Domingue was initially claimed by Spain, which later ceded the colony to France. France controlled Saint-Domingue from 1659 to 1804, and it became the most lucrative colony in the French colonial empire, as well as throughout the Caribbean.
Saint-Domingue was known as the &quot;Pearl of the Antilles&quot; for its resources, subsequent profitability and beauty. The economy hinged on slave plantations and their production of export crops. Enslaved Africans grew sugar in the northern plains around Cap Français, and coffee in the mountainous terrain. Georges and his family laboured on a sugar plantation. By the 1780s, Saint-Domingue produced 40% of all sugar and 60% of all coffee in Europe, profiting the French government and further reinforcing its dominance. To maintain this economy, from 1786 onwards, approximately 40,000 slaves were annually imported into Saint-Domingue from Africa. The Saint-Domingue colony was regarded as one of the harshest, considering the high levels of violence and mortality. The plantation owners were notoriously brutal, often using whips for the punishment of their slaves, producing an unprecedented standard of violence.

=== Social structure ===
Saint-Domingue&#x27;s population was stratified with a rigid caste system. The population was divided into three groups. White colonists, or &#x27;&quot;les blancs&#x27;&quot; were of the highest rank. This group was subdivided into government officials and plantation owners, referred to as &quot;&#x27;grandes blancs&#x27;&quot;, and a lower class of whites, referred to as &quot;&#x27;petits blancs&#x27;&quot;, who were usually shopkeepers, artisans and labourers. Free persons of colour, or &#x27;&quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;&#x27;, were &#x27;mulattoes&#x27; who were decedents of white fathers and black mothers. They were relatively educated and were usually administrators on plantations, or in the army. Some even owned their own plantations and slaves. This stratum also included &#x27;affranchis&#x27;, who had been free for generations, owned property and enjoyed considerable rights. They were, however, excluded from positions in office and some occupations. Members of this stratum often identified more so with the whites, however still faced distinct social differentiation. African-born slaves, such as Georges Biassou, ranked the lowest. In 1789, Saint-Domingue housed 500,000 slaves and 32,000 whites. This colonial stratification pattern laid the foundation of Haiti&#x27;s present day class system.

=== Social conflict ===
White colonists and black slaves continually participated in violent conflict, many of which involved &quot;maroons&quot;. Paul Fregosi, in his book &quot;Dreams of Empire: Napoleon and the First World war 1792-1815&quot;, emphases that each of the three social classes in Saint-Domingue despised one another.

In May 1791, the French government granted citizenship to wealthier emancipated slaves, often referred to as &quot;affranchis&quot;. This caused uproar among the small European population of Saint-Domingue, who refused to treat them as equal. This, as well as generations of inequality and brutality, caused Biassou and other African slaves to become enraged.

July 1791 saw physical fights between Europeans and African slaves, and in August of the same year, a slave rebellion rose. Georges Biassou attended the Vodou ceremony at Bois-Caiman where Vodou priest Dutty Boukman declared that Georges Biassou, Jean-François Papillon and Jeannot Bullet would lead the insurrection. Jean-François executed Jeannot early in the uprising due to his excessive violence and cruelty, particularly that he commanded a rebel camp in which he tortured and executed white prisoners.

== Haitian Revolution ==
The Haitian Revolution was a series of conflicts which began on 22 August 1791 and ended on 1 January 1804. It involved Haitian slaves, &quot;affranchis&quot;, &quot;mulattoes&quot;, colonists, French royalist troops, French revolutionary forces, and the British and Spanish armies. The revolution was initially an insurrection against French imperial authority; however, it later became a battle of racial inequity, and then of slavery in general. Thomas Madiou&#x27;s &quot;Historie d&#x27;Haïti&quot; (English: History of Haiti) emphasises that within the first months of fighting, Georges Biassou and Jean-François Papillon became the most important insurgent leaders. Biassou commanded approximately 40,000 slaves to burn plantations and murder the &quot;great whites&quot;. Biassou and Papillon proposed peace negotiations with France, offering to cease the revolt in exchange for emancipation. France was preoccupied, being at war with several monarchies and kingdoms, and hence dismissed this proposal. Concurrently, Biassou and Papillon developed informal contacts with Spain, which controlled Santo Domingo.

In 1793, France declared war on Spain, a war which eventually manifested in Hispaniola. Spain granted freedom to the revolutionaries in exchange for their assistance in battling France in Santo Domingo. A military organisation called the Black Auxiliaries of Charles IV was formed for the rebel leaders. Members included Georges Biassou, Jean-François Papillon, Toussaint Louverture and other rebels. The Black Auxiliaries were provided with weapons, supplies, and salaries. Biassou ultimately received Spanish citizenship, gold medals, and letters of recognition and confidence from the Spanish Government.

== Slave emancipation in Saint-Domingue ==
In 1792, abolitionist Léger Félicité Sonthonax was sent to Saint-Domingue from France to maintain order. He was titled the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Saint Domingue from September 1792 to 1795. Sonthonax also offered freedom to slaves who joined his army. In September and October 1793, slaves were emancipated throughout Saint-Domingue. Some insurgents, including Toussaint Louverture, withdrew from the Black Auxiliaries to return to Saint-Domingue and support the French.

=== Loyalty to Spain ===
Biassou and François remained loyal to Spain, despite that it meant they were to fight against their former fellow, Louverture. Biassou and François both continued defending Spain until the war ended. Spain was grateful for this loyalty, however, as the war concluded, the Spanish government no longer knew what to do with its Haitian &quot;wolves&quot;. The revolutionists were armed, skilled and former members of an army.

On February 4, 1794, all slaves were emancipated throughout all French colonies. This was enforced under an Act, and was ratified by the French National Convention. With the Treaty of Basel in 1795, Spain ceded Santo Domingo to France. Spain subsequently disbanded the Black Auxiliaries, meaning that its members, including Biassou, were to leave Hispaniola.

== St. Augustine ==

In 1795, the Black Auxiliaries left Santo Domingo and headed to Cuba. However, Cuban officials feared that their presence would provoke slave movements in Cuba. Thus, the Black Auxiliaries were prohibited from entering. Instead, they sailed to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, which was also under Spanish control. St. Augustine had already enforced racial equality laws in 1792, thus providing refuge for emancipated slaves, and even former planters.

Upon arrival, St. Augustine&#x27;s Governor, Juan Nepomuceno de Quesada y Barnuevo, provided two nights worth of dinner for Georges and his Haitian followers, who he considered family. Georges changed his name to &quot;Jorge&quot; and was hereafter a free Spanish general. He was appointed leader of the Black Militia of St. Augustine, which he commanded from Fort Matanzas.

Although Biassou was largely perceived as a hero, the violence he caused in his pursuit of freedom was no secret. Considering this, colonists and administrators in Florida feared Biassou, worrying that he might encourage a slave revolt in Florida too. They were especially weary as there had been two slave uprising conspiracies in Pointe Coupée, Louisiana, which is relatively proximal to Florida. Despite this, Governor Quesada made an effort to maintain Biassou&#x27;s image as a loyal soldier, rather than a rebel. Biassou wore gold-trimmed clothing and carried both a silver sabre and an ivory dagger.

== Constitution of 1801 ==
Whilst Biassou settled in St. Augustine, Napoleon Bonaparte developed a new French constitution for all its colonies. Toussaint Louverture propagated the constitution on 7 July 1801, and established himself as governor of Hispaniola. Article 3 of the constitution states, &quot;There cannot exist slaves, servitude is therein forever abolished. All men are born, live and die free and French.&quot;

== Final years ==

Georges Biassou lived in the Salcedo House in St. Augustine. He bought a plantation, farmed by slaves of his own. Biassou continued to serve Spain in his final years, defending Florida against attacks of the Seminole Indians. He had achieved 10 years of freedom before he died at age 60 on 14 July 1801, during a drunk brawl. He was honoured with a Catholic mass and was buried at the Tolomato Cemetery. The exact location of his gravesite is unknown, as most grave markers were made of wood and have long since disappeared.

== Legacy ==
Georges was commemorated as a Spanish officer and an honourable veteran, and was recognised with a Guard of Honour at his Funeral. On 1 January 1804, the island of Hispaniola was declared an independent state, divided into the Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Haiti is the only nation that has emerged from a successful slave rebellion in modern history. Haiti&#x27;s independence exposed an interdependence between slave emancipation and the construction of a sovereign state, giving rise to issues such as the definition of citizenship and difficulties in laying political foundations. Georges Biassou&#x27;s impact surpassed the domestic threshold and influenced world politics permanently. The Haitian revolution dictated the structure of international relations in the forthcoming 19th century with its defeat of the French colonial empire, and subsequent impact on Spain and England, who emerged weakened from the conflict and remained cautious for years to come.

In August 2009, the US Ambassador to Haiti, Raymond Joseph, visited St. Augustine to raise awareness for Haitian-American heritage. He visited Biassou&#x27;s home, fort and cemetery, and placed a wreath in front of the chapel in Tolomato Cemetery in honour of Biassou. In 1798, Biassou also appeared as a fictional character in Jean-Baptiste Picquenard&#x27;s novel, &#x27;&quot;Adonis, ou le bon nègre, anecdote coloniale&quot;&#x27; (English: Adonis, or the good negro, colonial anecdote), in which he is depicted as a &quot;cruel and bloodthirsty leader&quot;.

=== Witness accounts ===
A witness account titled &#x27;&quot;The revolution of Saint-Domingue, containing everything that occurred in the French colony from the start of the revolution until the author&#x27;s departure for France on 8 September 1792&quot;&#x27; (title translated to English) is written by an anonymous author, who is only identified by the fact that he is a white male. He details his experiences of being a white prisoner, being held captive on the first night of the uprising, August 22, 1791. This account provides a vivid first-person perceptive.

Monsieur Joseph Gros was one of Jeannot Bullet&#x27;s white prisoners at his rebel camp. Gros also published an account, in which he states that Jeannot ordered for one prisoner to be tortured and executed every 24 hours, in order to &quot;prolong his enjoyment&quot;. Jeannot Bullet would be tried and executed for this by Georges Biassou and Jean-François Papillon.

=== Contemporary scholarship ===
Biassou&#x27;s life has been thoroughly studied by scholars and historians, such as Jane Landers. Landers is a historian who has conducted research on Biassou and black society in Spanish Florida for decades, with a PhD in Latin American Colonial History. Her work provides most of what is known about Georges Biassou. She has written several books on the topic of black society and culture, a few of which are titled:
* &quot;Against the Odds: Free Blacks in the Slave Societies of the Americas&quot;
* &quot;Atlantic Creoles in the Age of Revolutions&quot;
* &quot;Black Society in Spanish Florida&quot;

Biassou is also figured as a character in Madison Smartt Bell&#x27;s 1995 novel, &quot;All Souls Rising&quot;, the first book in his Haitian Revolutionary trilogy series. It attempts to present a historically accurate rendition of the Haitian Revolution. The novel illustrates vivid details that are not facts, per se, but are based on actual events. The book also graphically depicts the witness account of Monsieur Joseph Gros. It was nominated for the 1996 PEN/Faulkner Award and a finalist for the 1996 US National Book Award. It also won the 1996 Anisfield-Wolf Award for best book of the year which dealt with matters of race.

<text>Jeannot, was a leader of the 1791 slave rising that began the Haitian Revolution. With Biassou and Jean François, he was prophesied by Dutty Boukman to lead the revolution, and fought with the Spanish royalists against the French Revolutionary authorities in colonial Haiti.

He launched vicious attacks on whites and mulattoes, devising gruesome methods of putting them to death. Toussaint Louverture was sickened by his attitudes and actions. (Beard, p. 55)

&quot;Small, thin man with a forbidding manner and a veiled crafty face. He was utterly remorseless... even towards his own kind. ... He would stop at nothing to gain his own ends, he was daring, seizing quickly on chances, quick-witted and capable of total hypocrisy. He feared no one and nothing; unfortunately he found inspiration in cruelty, a sadist without the refinements that so-called civilization brings.&quot; (Parkinson, p. 40) &quot;He hanged those he had captured by hooks stuck under their chins. He himself put out their eyes with red-hot pincers. He cut the throat of a prisoner and lapped at the blood as it flowed, encouraging those around him to join him: &quot;Ah, my friends, how good, how sweet is the blood of the whites. Drink it deep and swear revenge against our oppressors, never peace, never surrender, I swear by God.&quot; (Parkinson, p. 43-4).

Jeannot&#x27;s brutality was not limited to whites and free blacks. He also targeted blacks whom he suspected of loyalty to the white slave owners. One rebel commander named Blin, who helped some white slave owners to reach safety, for example, was brutally executed for treason by Jeannot. A man named Gros, who was among a group of white prisoners in a rebel camp under Jeannot&#x27;s command, left behind a written account of the period. According to Gros, Jeannot ordered the torture and execution of one of his captives every 24 hours &#x27;to prolong his enjoyment&#x27;. Before the execution of Gros and the other remaining prisoners, however, a higher ranking rebel leader, Jean-François, arrived in the camp. Jeannot was subsequently arrested, placed on trial, and executed on the orders of Jean-François (Dubois, p. 112, 123).

<text>Ethanol, an alcohol fuel, is an important fuel for the operation of internal combustion engines that are used in cars, trucks, and other kinds of machinery.

* Ethanol was first isolated from wine in approximately 1100 and was found to burn shortly thereafter. These early solutions distilled from wine-salt mixtures were referred to as &quot;aqua ardens&quot; (burning water) or &quot;aqua flamens&quot; (flaming water) and had such low alcohol content that they burned without producing noticeable heat. By the 13th century, the development of the cooling coil allowed the isolation of nearly pure ethanol by distillation.
* Ethanol has been used for lamp oil and cooking, along with plant and animal oils. Small alcohol stoves (also called &quot;spirit lamps&quot;) were commonly used by travelers in the 17th century to warm food and themselves.
* Before the [[American Civil War]] many farmers in the United States had an alcohol still to turn crop waste into free lamp oil and stove fuel for the farmers&#x27; family use. Conflict over taxation was not unusual; one example was the Whiskey Rebellion in 1791.
* In 1826, Samuel Morey uses alcohol in the first American internal combustion engine prototype.
* In the 1830s, alcohol blends had replaced increasingly expensive whale oil in most parts of the country. It &quot;easily took the lead as the illuminant&quot; because it was &quot;a decided improvement on other oils then in use.&quot; 
* By 1860, thousands of distilleries churned out at least of alcohol per year for lighting. Camphene / alcohol blends (at $.50 per gallon) were cheaper than whale oil ($1.30 to $2.50 per gallon) and lard oil (90 cents per gallon). It was about the same price as coal oil, which was the product first marketed as &quot;kerosene.&quot;
* In 1860, German inventor Nicolaus Otto uses ethyl alcohol as a fuel in an early internal combustion engine.
* In 1862 and 1864, a tax on alcohol was passed in the U.S. to pay for the Civil War, increasing the price of ethanol to over $2.00 per gallon. A new product from petroleum, called kerosene, is taxed at 10 cents a gallon.
* In the 19th century, spirit lamps, pigeon lamps and others used a variety of blends of alcohol and oils in Europe. Alcohol powered not only automobiles and farm machinery but also a wide variety of lamps, stoves, heaters, laundry irons, hair curlers, coffee roasters and every conceivable household appliance. By one estimate, some 95,000 alcohol fueled stoves and 37,000 spirit lamps had been manufactured in Germany by 1902.
* By the 1890s, alcohol-fueled engines are starting to be used in farm machinery in Europe, making countries more fuel independent. Research at the Experimental Mechanical Laboratory of Paris and at the Deutsche Landwirtschaftliche Gesellschaft in Berlin in the 1890s helped pave the way for expanded use of alcohol fuel.
* By 1896, horseless carriages (cars) were showing up on roads in Europe and the United States. Because gasoline is so cheap and abundant, and also because ethanol is taxed at a high level, early US automobiles are adapted to gasoline from the beginning. Racing cars, on the other hand, usually used ethanol (and other alcohols) because more power could be developed in a smaller, lighter engine. Charles Edgar Duryea builds the first U.S. gasoline powered car but is aware of Samuel Morey&#x27;s ethanol fueled experimental car of 1826. Henry Ford&#x27;s first car, the Quadracycle, is also built that year. The car runs on gasoline, but Ford is aware of experiments with ethanol in Germany, and subsequently backs the lifting of the U.S. tax on industrial uses of ethanol.
* In 1899, the German government taxed petroleum imports and subsidized domestic ethanol. Kaiser Wilhelm II &quot;was enraged at the Oil Trust of his country, and offered prizes to his subjects and cash assistance ... to adapt [alcohol] to use in the industries.&quot;
* In 1901, the French ministry of agriculture offered prizes for the best alcohol-fueled engines and household appliances.
* In 1902, the Paris alcohol fuel exposition exhibited alcohol powered cars, farm machinery, lamps, stoves, heaters, laundry irons, hair curlers, coffee roasters, and every conceivable household appliance and agricultural engine powered by alcohol. This exhibit traveled widely through Europe and was featured at the 1907 Jamestown, Virginia tricentennial celebrations.
* In 1906, the &quot;Free Alcohol&quot; bill is passed. The USA repeals the alcohol tax under Teddy Roosevelt. At 14 cents per US gallon, corn ethanol was cheaper than gasoline at 22 cents per US gallon. Bills pass that exempt farm stills from government control. In backing the bill, U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt says: &quot;The Standard Oil Company has, largely by unfair or unlawful methods, crushed out home competition... It is highly desirable that an element of competition should be introduced by the passage of some such law as that which has already passed in the House, putting alcohol used in the arts and manufacturers upon the [tax] free list.&quot;
*Starting in 1901, the discovery of new oil fields in Texas causes the price of gasoline to drop to between 18 and 22 cents per US gallon by 1906, undercutting farm ethanol markets
* In 1908, the Ford Model T is introduced. Early models had adjustable carburetors to run on ethanol with gasoline as an option.
* In 1909, the U.S. Geological Survey reports: &quot;In regard to general cleanliness, such as absence of smoke and disagreeable odors, alcohol has many advantages over gasoline or kerosene as a fuel… The exhaust from an alcohol engine is never clouded with a black or grayish smoke.&quot; Overall, alcohol was &quot;a more ideal fuel than gasoline.&quot;
* In 1914, the &quot;Free Alcohol&quot; bill is amended again to decrease the regulatory burden and encourage alcohol fuel production in the U.S.
* In 1917 Alexander Graham Bell says: &quot;Alcohol makes a beautiful, clean and efficient fuel… Alcohol can be manufactured from corn stalks, and in fact from almost any vegetable matter capable of fermentation… We need never fear the exhaustion of our present fuel supplies so long as we can produce an annual crop of alcohol to any extent desired.&quot;
* In 1918, &quot;Scientific American&quot; says it is &quot;now definitely established that alcohol can be blended with gasoline to produce a suitable fuel …&quot; Another article notes that the Pasteur Institute of France found it could obtain of ethanol per ton of seaweed.
* In 1919, Prohibition of beverage alcohol in the U.S. leads to suggestions for more ethanol use as an anti-knock blend with gasoline. Farm belt politicians are split on ethanol as a fuel. While distillers could have a new market for their alcohol, some thought that allowing any distillery to stay open would be a &quot;bargain with the devil.&quot;
* In the 1920s and 1930s, Koolmotor, Benzalcool, Moltaco, Lattybentyl, Natelite, Alcool and Agrol are some of the gasoline-ethanol blends of fuels once found in Britain, Italy, Hungary, Sweden, South Africa, Brazil and the USA (respectively).
* In 1920, David White, chief geologist of US Geological Survey, estimates total oil remaining in the US at . &quot;In making this estimate, which included both proved reserves and resources still remaining to be discovered, White conceded that it might well be in error by as much as 25 percent.&quot;
* In 1921, leaded gasoline is developed at the General Motors research laboratories in Dayton, Ohio. GM researcher Thomas Midgley Jr. still maintains: &quot;The most direct route which we now know for converting energy from its source, the sun, into a material that is suitable for use in an internal combustion motor is through vegetation to alcohol… It now appears that alcohol is the only liquid from a direct vegetable source that combines relative cheapness with suitability (although other sources might be found)… Alcohol will stand very high initial compressions without knocking, and at high compressions is smooth and highly satisfactory.&quot;.
* In 1921, British engineer Harry Ricardo patents racing fuels RD1 and RD2 (for Ricardo Discol) that contained methanol and ethanol, acetone and small amounts of water. These were widely used on race tracks throughout Europe and the US in the 1920s and 30s.
* In 1923 leaded gasoline is marketed, and by 1924 GM and Standard Oil Co. form the Ethyl Corp. Ethyl claims it has &quot;solved&quot; the problem of engine knock, but public health scientists (e.g. Alice Hamilton of Harvard University) are appalled at the prospects for lead poisoning and insist that alternatives such as ethanol blends are available.
* In 1923 Rolls-Royce engine designer Harry Ricardo writes: &quot;…It is a matter of absolute necessity to find an alternative fuel. Fortunately, such a fuel is in sight in the form of alcohol; this is a vegetable product whose consumption involves no drain on the world’s storage and which, in tropical countries at all events, can ultimately be produced in quantities sufficient to meet the world’s demand, at all events at the present rate of consumption. By the use of a fuel derived from vegetation, mankind is adapting the sun’s heat to the development of motive power, as it becomes available from day to day; by using mineral fuels, he is consuming a legacy – and a limited legacy at that – of heat stored away many thousands of years ago. In the one case he is, as it were, living within his income, in the other he is squandering his capital. It is perfectly well known that alcohol is an excellent fuel, and there is little doubt but that sufficient supplies could be produced within the tropical regions of the British empire…&quot; 
* In 1923, the price of alcohol from molasses was less than 20 cents per US gallon, while retail gasoline prices had reached an all-time high of 28 cents per gallon. Standard Oil experiments with a 10% alcohol, 90% gasoline blend for a few months to increase octane and stop engine knock.
* In 1923, French assembly passes the Carburant National law requiring gasoline importers to buy alcohol for 10% blends from the State Alcohol Service. The law has a far-reaching impact as many other nations, especially Brazil and other sugar-cane growing countries, were influenced to enact similar laws based on the French and German programs.
* By the mid-1920s, ethyl alcohol is blended with gasoline in every industrialized nation, and some blends are showing up as experiments in the United States, but the market is dominated by leaded gasoline.
* In October of 1924, a catastrophic miscalculation in the production of leaded gasoline causes at least 17 refinery deaths and many dozens of permanently debilitating injuries. GM and Standard very nearly abandon leaded gasoline, but decide to defend it, claiming (contrary to their own prior published research) that &quot;&quot;So far as science knows at the present time, tetraethyl lead is the only material available which can bring about these [antiknock] results.&quot;
* In 1925, Henry Ford tells &quot;The New York Times&quot; that ethyl alcohol is &quot;the fuel of the future&quot; which &quot;is going to come from fruit like that sumach out by the road, or from apples, weeds, sawdust -- almost anything. There is fuel in every bit of vegetable matter that can be fermented. There&#x27;s enough alcohol in one year&#x27;s yield of an acre of potatoes to drive the machinery necessary to cultivate the fields for a hundred years.&quot;
* In 1926, US Public Health Service allows leaded gasoline to return to the market.
* In 1928 Harry Ricardo, National Distillers Co. and Shell Oil introduce an alcohol fuel blend in the United Kingdom called &quot;Cleveland Discol.&quot; The ethanol blend is a popular unleaded gasoline brand and is sold through 1968.
* In August 1930, the German government required all gasoline importers to buy 2.5% of the volume of their imports from the German Alcohol Monopoly, and the ratio was increased to 6% and then 10% by 1932. Estimates of alcohol used in 1932 vary from 44 million liters to about 175 million liters. Some 36,000 small farm alcohol stills, owned by the monopoly, were in operation at this time. By 1938, Germany was producing about 267 million liters of ethanol, about two thirds from potatoes and the rest from grain, wood sulfite liquors and beets. Some 89 million liters of methanol were produced from coal, while other synthetic fuels included 550 million liters of benzene and over one billion liters of synthetic gasoline. All told, 54% of the pre-war German fuel production was derived from non-petroleum sources, of which 8% was ethanol from renewable sources 
* In the 1930s, the Dust Bowl drought and Great Depression forced many more farmers to move to the cities looking for work, leaving their alcohol fuel stills behind. Henry Ford, a farmer himself, supported ethanol&#x27;s use over gas.
* In 1933, faced with the 25% unemployment of the Great Depression, the European concept of finding new markets for surplus farm products is widely discussed, with ethanol-gasoline blending among the most significant. Fuel blending experiments begin in Peoria, IL, Spokane WA, Lincoln, NE, and Ames, IA. Federal and state governments consider tax advantages to help ethanol production and increase employment among farmers. By 1935 the Chemurgy movement emerges, supported by farmers, Republicans, and Henry Ford. Along with ethanol, chemurgy research included the industrial development of agricultural raw materials such as hemp, soybeans and new products from biological materials, such as hemp &amp; soybean plastics and inks.
* In 1933, a campaign to end Prohibition in the United States emerges. Concerned about renewed interest in ethanol for fuel, the American Petroleum Institute begins a campaign against ethanol blends, claiming such &quot;will harm the petroleum industry and the automobile industry as well as state and national treasuries by reducing [oil] consumption,&quot; the sole beneficiaries allegedly being distillers, railroads (which would transport the alcohol) and bootleggers &quot;to whom would be opened brand new fields of fraud.&quot; Prohibition ends with the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 5, 1933.
* From 1933 to 1939, various oil companies and the American Petroleum Institute argued that tax incentives for ethanol would hurt the oil industry, reduce state treasuries, and create a bootlegger&#x27; atmosphere around fueling stations. They also claimed alcohol fuel was inferior to gasoline.
* In 1937, the farm chemurgy movement finds backers for the Agrol ethanol fuel plant, created at Atchison, Kansas. For two years, ethanol blends were sold at around 2,000 service stations in the U.S. Midwest. Agrol plant managers complained of sabotage and bitter infighting by the oil industry, and the cheaper price of gasoline. Agrol sold for 17 cents per gallon, while leaded gasoline sold for 16 cents.
* In 1939, Agrol production shuts down.
* In 1942, chemists who designed the Agrol ethanol plant, especially Leo Christensen, go to work producing ethanol for aviation fuel and synthetic &quot;Buna-S&quot; rubber for World War II. By 1944, petroleum based synthetic rubber production lags, and three quarters of all tires, raincoats, engine gaskets and other rubber products for the war effort come from ethanol.
* In 1942, a war investigating committee led by then-Senator (and future president) Harry Truman makes public evidence that the oil industry had colluded with German chemical companies, especially I.G. Farben, to prevent the development of synthetic rubber production in the United States. Standard Oil (Exxon) had entered a partnership that it described as a &quot;full marriage&quot; designed to &quot;outlast the war&quot; no matter who won.
* In 1949, S. J .W. Pleeth, chemist for the Cleveland Discol company in Great Britain, writes: &quot;The bias aroused by the use of alcohol as a motor fuel has produced [research] results that are incompatible with each other ... Countries with considerable oil deposits -- such as the US -- or which control oil deposits of other lands -- such as Holland -- tend to produce reports antithetical to the use of fuels alternative to petrol; countries with little or no indigenous oil tend to produce favorable reports. The contrast ... is most marked. One can scarcely avoid the conclusion that the results arrived at are those best suited to the political or economic aims of the country concerned or the industry sponsoring the research. We deplore this partisan use of science, while admitting its existence, even in the present writer.&quot;
* In 1964, a seven-car crash kills drivers Dave MacDonald and Eddie Sachs on the second lap of the Indianapolis 500, as over of gasoline burned. Johnny Rutherford, who was also involved in the crash, survived, mainly because his methanol-fueled car had not ignited. The United States Auto Club bans gasoline and switches all cars to methyl alcohol (methanol), a rule which would stay for 41 years before ending after the 2005 race.
* During the Nigerian Civil War of 1967 to 1970, Engineers in the breakaway republic of Biafra resorted to powering vehicles with alcohol. Initially, alcohol was used to supplement the crude oil refining capacity which the fledgling state had under its control, but as the Soviet and UK backed Nigerian army seized the oil producing regions, and with the Nigerian embargo beginning to bite, alcohol became the dominant source of fuel for the economy.
* In 1971, the Nebraska Agricultural Products Industrial Utilization Committee (or &quot;Gasohol&quot; Committee) is formed to find new uses for surplus grain. The commission tests ethanol-gasoline blends in thousands of cars over millions of miles, proving that ethanol can be used as an octane-boosting additive to replace leaded gasoline.
* In 1973, the Arab oil embargo creates a worldwide energy crisis, leading to intensified search for alternative energy sources. Also, in the same year, the government of Brazil starts the program &quot;Pró-Álcool&quot; in order to substitute gas-powered vehicles in favor of automobiles powered by ethanol. Such program would lead to the development of the first ethanol powered automobile motor in the world.
* In 1979, President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration creates federal incentives for ethanol production. Federal and state subsidies for ethanol amount to about $11 billion between 1979 and 2000, as compared to about $150 billion in tax credits for the oil industry (from 1968–2000), according to the General Accounting Office.
* By the mid-1980s, over 100 new corn alcohol production plants are built and over a billion US gallons of ethanol for fuel were sold per year. The ethanol program is controversial for several reasons, not the least of which was that the ethanol industry was dominated by one company – Archer Daniels Midland of Peoria, Ill.
* In 1984, the number of ethanol plants peaked at 163 in the U.S., producing of ethanol that year.
* In 1988, the George H. W. Bush administration proposes a cleanup of &quot;air toxics&quot; in gasoline, focusing on replacing benzene octane boosters with ethanol. The proposal leads to one part of the 1990 Clean Air Act.
* In the late 1980s and 1990s, an oil surplus drives gasoline prices down as low as $12 per barrel, driving most of the ethanol industry into bankruptcy.
* In 1990 and 1992, Congress passes amendments to the Clean Air Act encouraging the use of ethanol and other oxygenated fuels as replacements for benzene, toluene and xylene octane boosters. MTBE becomes the oil industry&#x27;s favorite additive, but as water pollution problems were recognized, MTBE is banned in California. Ethanol production rises to the level.
* Between 1997 and 2002, three million U.S. cars and light trucks are produced which could run on E85, a blend of 85% ethanol with 15% gasoline. Almost no gas stations sell this fuel however.
* In the early 2000s, the invasion of Iraq makes Americans aware of their dependence on foreign oil. This and worry over anthropogenic climate change causes leading alternative energies like biofuel, solar and wind to expand 20 to 30% yearly.
* In 2003, California is the first state to ban MTBE. Several other states start switching soon afterward. California consumes of ethanol a year, about a third of all the ethanol produced in the United States.
* In 2004, Crude oil prices rise by 80%. Gasoline prices rise 30% in the U.S. Diesel fuel rises almost 50%. These rises are caused by hurricane damage to oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, attacks on Iraqi oil pipelines, disruptions elsewhere, and rising demand for gasoline in Asia, as Asians buy more cars. Alcohol fuel prices are much closer to the price of gasoline. The ethanol industry in the USA makes per day in August, an all-time record. Some conventional oil fuel companies are investing in alcohol fuel. Oil reserves are forecast to last about 40 more years. Total use (demand) of ethanol is .
* In 2005, E85 sells for 45 cents (or 30-75 cents wholesale) less than gasoline on average in the United States. More than 4 million flexible-fuel (capable of running on E85 as well as gasoline) vehicles exist in the United States. About 400 filling stations exist in the US that sell E85 fuel, mostly in the Midwest. Gasoline prices rise as ethanol prices stay the same, due to rapidly growing ethanol supply and federal tax subsidies for ethanol. Wholesale ethanol prices drop nearly 30% between January and April, or $1.75 to $1.23 per gallon in the U.S.
* In 2005, the earliest-documented test of driving a car designed solely for gasoline use, long-distance solely on 100% butanol fuel occurs as American motorist David Ramey drove from Blacklick, Ohio to San Diego, California using 100% butanol in an unmodified 1992 Buick Park Avenue.
* In 2006, the Indy Racing League switches to a 10% ethanol-90% methanol fuel mixture, as part of a phase-in to an all-ethanol formula in 2007. Bill Gates buys a quarter of Pacific Ethanol Inc. for $84 million.
* In 2007, United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Special Rapporteur for the Right to Food urges five-year moratorium on food based biofuels, including ethanol, saying its development is a &quot;crime against humanity.&quot; The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calls this &quot;regrettable,&quot; and UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon, called for more scientific research. &quot;Clearly biofuels have great potential for good and, perhaps, also for harm.&quot;
* In 2008, Bill Gates sells most Pacific shares held by Cascade Investment for a loss of $38.9 million.

<doc id="1078259" wikidata="Q269237" url="?curid=1078259" title="Fifth Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Fifth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty V) is often combined with Dynasties III, IV and VI under the group title the Old Kingdom. The Fifth Dynasty pharaohs reigned for approximately 150 years, from the early 25th century BC until the mid 24th century BC.

==Chronology==
The Fifth Dynasty of Egypt is a group of nine kings ruling Egypt for approximately 150 years in the 25th and 24th centuries BC. The relative succession of kings is not entirely secured as there are contradictions between historical sources and archaeological evidence regarding the reign of the shadowy Shepseskare.

== Rulers ==
Known rulers in the Fifth Dynasty are listed below. Manetho assigns 248 years of rule to the Fifth Dynasty; however, the pharaohs of this dynasty more probably ruled for approximately 150 years. This estimate varies by both scholar and source. The Horus names and most names of the queens are taken from Dodson and Hilton.

Manetho writes that the Dynasty V kings ruled from Elephantine, but archeologists have found evidence clearly showing that their palaces were still located at Ineb-hedj (&quot;White Walls&quot;).

As before, expeditions were sent to Wadi Maghareh and Wadi Kharit in the Sinai to mine for turquoise and copper, and to quarries northwest of Abu Simbel for gneiss. Trade expeditions were sent south to Punt to obtain malachite, myrrh, and electrum, and archeological finds at Byblos attest to diplomatic expeditions sent to that Phoenician city. Finds bearing the names of several Dynasty V kings at the site of Dorak, near the Sea of Marmara, may be evidence of trade but remain a mystery.

=== Userkaf ===
How Pharaoh Userkaf founded this dynasty is not known for certain. The Westcar Papyrus, which was written during the Middle Kingdom, tells a story of how king Khufu of Dynasty IV was given a prophecy that triplets born to the wife of the priest of Ra in Sakhbu would overthrow him and his heirs, and how he attempted to put these children – named Userkaf, Sahure, and Neferirkare – to death; however in recent years, scholars have recognized this story to be at best a legend and admit their ignorance over how the transition from one dynasty to another transpired.

During this dynasty, Egyptian religion made several important changes. The earliest known copies of funerary prayers inscribed on royal tombs (known as the Pyramid Texts) appear. The cult of the god Ra gains added importance, and kings from Userkaf through Menkauhor Kaiu built temples dedicated to Ra at or near Abusir. Then late in this dynasty, the cult of the deity Osiris assumes importance, most notably in the inscriptions found in the tomb of Unas.

=== Djedkare Isesi ===
Amongst non-royal Egyptians of this time, Ptahhotep, vizier to Djedkare Isesi, won fame for his wisdom; &quot;The Maxims of Ptahhotep&quot; was ascribed to him by its later copyists. Non-royal tombs were also decorated with inscriptions, like the royal ones, but instead of prayers or incantations, biographies of the deceased were written on the walls.

<text>Iceland is heavily integrated into the European Union via the Agreement on the European Economic Area and the Schengen Agreement, despite its status as a non-EU member state. Iceland applied for membership in 2009. The Minister for Foreign Affairs sent a letter in 2015 that ended the application process.

== Comparison ==
== Integration ==
Iceland is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), a grouping of four non-EU European countries, and is also part of the European Economic Area (EEA). Through the EEA, Iceland participates with a non-voting status in certain EU agencies and programmes, including enterprise, environment, education (including the Erasmus Programme) and research programs. Iceland also contributes funds to &quot;social and economic cohesion&quot; in the EU/EEA. Iceland also frequently consults the EU on foreign affairs and frequently aligns itself to EU foreign policy. Iceland also participates in EU civilian peacekeeping missions.

Iceland is a member of the Nordic Passport Union and the Schengen Area, which now is under EU law, as a non-voting participant. Iceland&#x27;s participation in the Schengen Area allows free movement of people between Iceland and the rest of the Schengen Area. Several thousand Icelanders travel to and study or work in the EU. A large majority of foreigners in Iceland come from the EU. Iceland is also associated with the Dublin Convention on justice and home affairs cooperation. Iceland also has links to several EU member states through its membership of the Nordic Council.

=== Use of the euro ===
During the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, instability in the Icelandic króna led to discussion in Iceland about adopting the euro. However, Jürgen Stark, a Member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, has stated that &quot;Iceland would not be able to adopt the EU currency without first becoming a member of the EU&quot;. As of the ECB&#x27;s May 2012 convergence report, Iceland did not meet any of the convergence criteria. One year later, the country managed to comply with the deficit criteria and had begun to decrease its debt-to-GDP ratio, but still suffered from elevated HICP inflation and long-term governmental interest rates.

=== Reasons for Iceland&#x27;s non-membership of the European Union ===
Academics have proposed several explanations for why Iceland has not joined the European Union:
* The importance of the fishing industry to Iceland&#x27;s economy and the perception that EU membership (and its Common Fisheries Policy) will have an adverse effect on the fishing industry.
* The perception that EU membership will have an adverse effect on Iceland&#x27;s agricultural sector.
* Iceland&#x27;s strong ties with the United States, which included significant economic, diplomatic and military assistance, decreased Iceland&#x27;s dependence on European countries. 
* The victories in the Cod Wars (1958-1976) may have strengthened Icelandic nationalism and boosted the perception that Iceland can succeed through unilateral or bilateral means rather than compromise in multilateral frameworks.
* The Icelandic electoral system favors rural areas, which are more eurosceptic.
* The tendency for Icelandic elites to pursue education in the United States or eurosceptic European countries (such as the United Kingdom or the Nordic countries), and to cooperate more closely with political elites from those countries.
* Icelandic nationalism and the legacy of Iceland&#x27;s struggle for national sovereignty.
* The impact of the Icesave dispute with the Netherlands and the UK.

== Trade relations ==


Economic relations between Iceland and the European Union are primarily governed by two agreements: a bilateral free trade agreement signed in 1972, and the agreement on the EEA in 1994. The EEA was established to give Iceland, among other European countries outside the EU, access to the EU market. Iceland&#x27;s access to the EU market in respect of agriculture and fisheries is dealt with by separate bilateral agreements. Iceland is legally bound to implement into its own law all EU directives applicable to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. This is complemented by regular meetings between EU and Icelandic officials, including a twice-yearly meeting of EEA foreign ministers.

78% of Iceland&#x27;s exports went to the EU and 52% of Iceland&#x27;s imports came from it, making the EU Iceland&#x27;s most important trading partner, followed by Norway. Traditionally, Iceland&#x27;s economy has focused on fisheries and renewable energy (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal energy - see energy in Iceland for more details), but it has been diversifying into aluminium production, pharmaceuticals, information technologies, tourism and the financial sector. Iceland is still a large exporter of fish (the third largest exporter to the EU after Norway and China) with a world trade surplus of €1.1 billion in 2008. In fisheries, the EU had a 2009 trade deficit of €879 million. Until Iceland&#x27;s 2009 financial crisis, its commercial services sector had been growing rapidly, accounting for almost 35% of total exports (goods and services combined).

== Accession of Iceland to the European Union ==

Iceland applied to join the European Union on 16 July 2009 and formal negotiations began on 27 July 2010. However, on 13 September 2013 the Government of Iceland dissolved its accession team and suspended its application to join the EU. On 12 March 2015, Foreign Minister of Iceland Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson stated that he had sent a letter to the EU withdrawing the application for membership, without the approval of the Althing, though the European Union stated that Iceland had not formally withdrawn the application.

If negotiations were to resume, Iceland would face controversial issues on fisheries which could potentially derail an agreement, despite already being a member of the European Economic Area (which excludes fishery). If an agreement were to be concluded, the accession treaty would be subject to a national referendum in Iceland and require ratification by every EU state.

=== Pre-2008 opinion ===
From 1995 to 2007 the government coalition of the conservative Independence Party (&quot;Sjálfstæðisflokkurinn&quot;) and the conservative Progressive Party (&quot;Framsóknarflokkurinn&quot;), opposed joining the EU, while the opposition Social Democratic Alliance (&quot;Samfylkingin&quot;) supported membership negotiations. In 1994, the Social Democratic Party (&quot;Alþýðuflokkurinn&quot;) became the first Icelandic political party to include the intention to apply to join the EU in its policy statement. Despite this hostility towards EU membership, the Independence Party was forced to accept some of the constraints associated with participation in the European project. Iceland sought shelter provided by the EEA, EFTA and Schengen because non-membership of the EEA and EFTA would have threatened its key economic interests, and non-membership of Schengen would have imposed burdens on Icelandic individuals.

Former Prime Minister Halldór Ásgrímsson predicted on 8 February 2006 that the country would join the EU by 2015. He added that the decisive factor would be the future and the size of the Eurozone, especially whether Denmark, Sweden and the UK would have adopted the euro or not. His prediction received some criticism, not the least from people within his own government.

Another former Prime Minister, Geir H. Haarde, has on a number of occasions stated his opposition to EU membership, both as Foreign Minister under Halldór Ásgrímsson and after taking office as Prime Minister. In response to Halldór Ásgrímsson&#x27;s earlier prediction, Haarde said, &quot;I don&#x27;t share that point of view. Our policy is not to join in the foreseeable future. We are not even exploring membership.&quot; In a speech at a conference at the University of Iceland on 31 March 2006, Geir Haarde repeated what he had said on a number of occasions—that no special Icelandic interests demanded membership of the EU. In the same speech he further explained in detail why it would not be in the interest of Iceland to adopt the euro.

Following the 2007 election, the Independence Party and the Social Democratic Alliance formed a new coalition with a policy of not applying for membership, but setting up a special committee to monitor the development within the EU and suggest ways to respond to that.

Due to Iceland&#x27;s limited currency, the government has explored the possibility of adopting the euro without joining the European Union. The EU, however, says that Iceland cannot join the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) without becoming a full EU member state (all other non-EU states that use the euro do so because they previously used a member state currency that was replaced by the euro).

=== Effect of 2008 financial crisis ===
At a meeting of members of his party on 17 May 2008, Geir Haarde said that in his opinion the cost of joining the EU outweighed the benefits, and therefore he was not in favour of membership. However, in October 2008, during talks to repatriate a portion of Iceland&#x27;s foreign invested pension funds—Iceland having been particularly hard hit by the financial crisis of September 2008—the unions demanded that Iceland apply for EU membership in return for wage restraint.

On 30 October 2008, Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, minister of education, said that &quot;Iceland has to define its long-term national interests and part of that is a revision of the currency regime, including a possible EU application&quot; and that an application for membership needed to be discussed &quot;in weeks rather than months&quot;.

Two weeks later, on 17 November 2008, the Independence Party announced it would hold its party congress in January 2009 instead of Autumn 2009, to reconsider the possibility of applying for EU membership; the Progressive Party also announced it would hold its party congress in January, after two anti-EU MPs (including the party leader) resigned and were replaced by MPs more positive towards EU application.

The Progressive Party accepted at its congress to support application for EU membership but with very strict conditions including one demanding full authority for Iceland over its fishing grounds and other national resources. When the government headed by the Independence Party was dissolved in January the party decided to postpone its congress until March. The congress eventually decided on an unchanged opposition to EU membership but also claimed that if the issue were opened by others both an application and an initial accession treaty with the EU should be put to a referendum.

The US denied Iceland&#x27;s financial request for financial support after the 2008 economic crash. Iceland turned to the EU for assistance, but they also turned Iceland&#x27;s request for aid down. This seriously damaged the efforts of the Europhiles in Iceland to sell the EU as a shelter provider to Iceland. The Europhiles mainly focused on the potential economic benefits of EU membership and the adoption of the euro, emphasizing the benefits of cheaper goods for consumers and enterprises, and access to aid from the EU structural funds for rural areas, agriculture and the tourism industry. There was, however, no mention of the EU as a soft security shelter provider. After a speedy economic recovery and considerable domestic opposition to membership, the application was put on hold in 2013. At present, the Icelandic government does not regard the country as a candidate to join the EU, though it has not withdrawn its membership application. Iceland&#x27;s membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Schengen provide Iceland with partial political, economic and societal shelter but it is secondary to formal membership of the EU. Iceland&#x27;s membership of the EU is unlikely to materialize in the present domestic and European environment. A dramatic change is needed to alter Iceland&#x27;s present European policy. Domestic features of each and every state need to be taken into consideration in order to fully understand its calculations of cost and benefits of a potential shelter relationship.

=== 2009 election and parliamentary debate ===
Iceland&#x27;s finance minister, Steingrímur J. Sigfússon, ahead of the country&#x27;s first elections since the financial crisis, stated that &quot;any decision for Iceland to join the European Union and the single currency must be taken by its people, not one political party&quot;, on the subject that the issue of EU membership was the greatest threat to a stable coalition.

The 2009 election, which followed the financial crisis, saw the Progressive Party switch to supporting EU membership but the Independence Party called for a referendum prior to the start of negotiations. The Social Democratic Alliance made joining the EU a key issue in their campaign.

After the win of the pro-EU Social Democratic Alliance in the election, Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir spoke of an immediate application to the European Union and adoption of the euro within four years as a way to deal with the country&#x27;s debt.

In late April 2009, it was announced that the United Kingdom, which at the time was a member state of the European Union with whom Iceland has had a long history of fishing and territorial water disputes, supported Iceland joining the EU.

In early May 2009, it was leaked that the issue of application for EU membership would likely be left to the parliament, in which the Alliance, the Progressive Party and the Citizens&#x27; Movement together already had enough seats to approve the application. Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, the leader of the Progressive Party, strongly objected to the suggestion that his party would assist the government in this matter, however. The anti-EU Left-Green coalition partner accepted that in spring 2010, the minister for foreign affairs would present to the parliament a bill on talks with the EU.

On 10 May 2009, Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir announced that the government intended to move towards membership more quickly than previously expected. She announced that a bill would be introduced in parliament on 15 May 2009, authorising the opening of accession talks with the EU. She also stated that she was confident that the legislation would pass, and that she had secured a parliamentary majority on the issue, despite the official opposition to talks by one of her coalition partners. She went on to say that she expected an official application to be submitted no later than July 2009. This seemed to leave Iceland on course to join the EU along with Croatia in 2011, as predicted by EU Enlargement Commissioner, Olli Rehn. The government has stated that the issue will be put to a vote once an accession agreement has been negotiated.

The motion to file an application for membership was officially introduced in parliament on 25 May 2009. Voting was to have been held on 13 July, but was postponed until 16 July. First, a proposal by the Independence Party to hold a referendum on the membership application was defeated by 32 to 30 with one abstention. Then the Social Democratic Alliance&#x27;s proposal to apply for membership immediately was approved with a narrow majority of 33 to 28 votes with 2 abstentions.

=== Application for membership ===

To become a member, a country must first apply and then be recognised as a candidate country. For that to happen the country must satisfy the first of the Copenhagen criteria: it must be a politically stable democracy that respects human rights. Then negotiations will take place which will consider the country&#x27;s fulfilment of economic criteria, the country&#x27;s degree of adoption of EU legislation, and whether there shall be any exceptions.

EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn claimed that negotiations on an accession treaty would take less than a year, because Iceland had already adopted two-thirds of EU legislation in relation to the EEA. He had on other occasions claimed that the negotiations could take up to four years.

On 30 January 2009, Rehn commented that Iceland could enter the European Union promptly in 2011, at the same time as Croatia, saying that Iceland is an old democracy but also that it should not get special treatment. Fishing quotas and Icelandic whaling may be the toughest issues in any such negotiations.

On 16 July 2009, the Althing voted in favour of accession talks with the EU (with 33 votes in favour, 28 against, and 2 abstentions). The head of the parliamentary committee on EU affairs, Árni Þór Sigurðsson, stated that Iceland would not be ready to join the EU any earlier than 2013. However the government stated that it planned to complete negotiations by the end of 2010.

On 17 July 2009, the application for Icelandic membership of the EU was handed to the government of Sweden, which then held the presidency of the Council of the European Union, by the ambassador of Iceland in Stockholm. The application was again handed over by the Icelandic foreign minister to the Swedish one in a ceremony in Stockholm on 23 July 2009.

The letter of application was dated 16 July 2009. The application was acknowledged by the Council of the European Union on 27 July 2009.

=== Accession negotiations ===
Sweden, then holder of the EU presidency, announced that it would prioritise Iceland&#x27;s EU accession process. On 24 July, the Lithuanian Parliament unanimously approved and gave full support for Iceland&#x27;s membership application to join the European Union. Later, on 27 July, Malta also announced that it supports Iceland&#x27;s EU bid.

In September 2009, the Spanish foreign minister visited Iceland to discuss the progress of the Icelandic application; Spain chaired the EU from January–June 2010. On 8 September, the EU commission sent a list of 2,500 questions to Iceland about its fulfilment of political and economic criteria and adoption of EU law. Iceland returned answers to them on 22 October 2009. On 2 November, Iceland selected a chief negotiator for the membership negotiations with the EU: Stefán Haukur Jóhannesson, Iceland&#x27;s Ambassador to Belgium.

In January 2010 the Icesave dispute became an issue. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands wanted the Icelandic government to repay them the costs incurred in covering their citizens&#x27; losses due to the bankruptcy of some Icelandic banks. If Iceland did not pay, obstacles to membership could be laid by the UK and the Netherlands. If Iceland agreed to repay the UK and the Netherlands, the added debt would make it difficult to adopt the euro, a major reason for Iceland to join the EU, because of the convergence criteria. Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Moratinos, who then held the Presidency of the European Union, has said that the Icesave dispute does not impact Iceland&#x27;s application. David Miliband, then British Foreign Minister, reaffirmed the UK&#x27;s continued support for Iceland&#x27;s EU application. Additionally, the Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen has stated that while the opening of negotiations will not be blocked by the Icesave dispute, it must be resolved before Iceland&#x27;s accession.

In February 2010, the European Commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy recommended to the Council of the European Union to start accession negotiations with Iceland. While it was expected that Iceland would be considered for official candidate status at the EU summit in March, this was delayed to allow the German national parliament, which has the authority to debate important EU policy such as enlargement before action is taken by the government, to consider the matter. The German Parliament voted in favour of opening membership negotiations on 22 April 2010. The European Council decided in June to begin negotiations, and on 17 June 2010, the EU granted official candidate status to Iceland by formally approving the opening of membership talks.

Negotiations for membership of the EU started on 27 July 2010, with screening of specific acquis chapters beginning on 15 November 2010. Iceland became eligible for pre-accession funding from the EU through the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) since July 2010.

The first annual report on negotiations was published in November 2010: the main issues at stake remained the fisheries sector and whale hunting, while progress has been made concerning the Icesave dispute.

The screening process ended and formal negotiations began on 27 June 2011. Four chapters were opened: science and research; education and culture; public procurement; information society and media. The first two were immediately closed, a first in accession history. Iceland aimed to open half of the remaining chapters under the Polish presidency (the second half of 2011) and the other half under the following Danish presidency (first half of 2012). Despite disputes over Icesave and fishing, and the fact there was then no majority in favour of membership in Iceland, Icelandic Foreign Minister Össur Skarphéðinsson was confident Iceland would join and looked to the EU&#x27;s flexibility in negotiations with Norway during the 1990s as hope. He did however claim that ultimately it was the major fishing countries of the EU who would influence the outcome of the application.

In February 2013, the Icelandic chief negotiator stated that the main driving force for Iceland joining the EU was the benefit to the country of adopting the euro to replace the inflation-plagued Icelandic króna. Iceland&#x27;s HICP inflation and related long-term government interest rates were both recorded to be around 6 per cent on average for 2012. Most importantly, however, while the country retained the Icelandic kronur, it was unable to lift the capital controls recently introduced in the turmoil of the economic crisis. Introduction of the euro, a far stronger currency, would allow the country to lift these capital controls and achieve an increased inward flow of foreign economic capital, which ultimately would ensure higher and more stable economic growth. To be eligible to adopt the euro, Iceland would need to join the EU, as unilateral euro adoption had previously been refused by the EU.

=== 2013 election and withdrawal of application ===
The Icelandic Parliamentary committee on foreign affairs tabled a proposal on 18 December 2012 to suspend accession negotiations. The motion also called for an &quot;application referendum&quot; to be held to determine the will of the Icelandic people prior to any resumption of negotiations. A similar proposal was submitted to the Icelandic parliament in May 2012, but was rejected by a vote of 25 for and 34 against. The Icelandic parliament had yet to vote on the new proposal, which were supported primarily at the time by the opposition Independence Party and Progressive Party. The leaders of both governing parties, the Social Democratic Alliance and Left-Green Movement, stated that they did not support the motion. However, some MPs from the Left-Green Movement declared their support for the measure. On 10 January 2013, the proposal was formally adopted by the Foreign Affairs committee.

On 14 January, the Icelandic government announced that negotiations would be slowed, and that an accession agreement would not be reached before the parliamentary election in April. No new chapters would be opened prior to the election, though negotiations would continue on chapters that had already been opened. In February 2013, the national congress of both the Independence Party and Progressive Party reconfirmed their policy that further membership negotiations with the EU should be stopped and not resumed unless they are first approved by a national referendum, while the national congresses of the Social Democratic Alliance, Bright Future and Left-Green Movement reiterated their support for the completion of EU accession negotiations.

On 19 March 2013, Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir, an Independence Party MP, put forward a motion in the Althing calling for a referendum asking the Icelandic public whether EU accession negotiations should continue. She proposed that the referendum be held during the upcoming parliamentary election in April if possible, or else during local elections in the spring of 2014. In response to Gunnarsdóttir and other proponents of EU integration within the Independence Party, Bjarni Benediktsson, the leader of the party, reiterated the party&#x27;s policy of stopping negotiations with the EU, but promised to hold a referendum on continuing the negotiations in the first half of their term if they form government.

The ruling left-wing parties suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections that were held on 27 April 2013, while the centrist Progressive Party had a large victory. The leaders of the Progressive Party and the Independence Party began negotiating the formation of a coalition government, and on 22 May it was announced that a coalition platform had been agreed to that would suspend all accession talks with the EU and not resume them unless approved by a referendum. However, under Icelandic law, it is not the Government but the Icelandic Parliament which decides to end negotiations. On 13 June, Iceland&#x27;s Foreign Minister Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson informed the European Commission that the newly elected government intended to &quot;put negotiations on hold&quot;. European Commission President Manuel Barroso responded on 16 July 2013 by requesting that the new Icelandic Prime Minister make a decision on the continuation of their accession bid &quot;without further delay&quot;, and stressed that the EU remained &quot;committed to continue the accession negotiations process, which I&#x27;m certain could address Iceland&#x27;s specificities&quot;.

In August 2013 the Icelandic government revealed that it had received a legal opinion that the 2009 Parliamentary vote did not oblige it to continue accession negotiations with the EU. In light of this, the Foreign Ministry stated that it had &quot;decided to consider dissolving the negotiation committee&quot;. A few weeks later the committee was officially dissolved. Foreign Minister Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson said that &quot;the process has been suspended. But nothing has been closed down.&quot; In October 2013 Benediktsson stated that no decision on ending Iceland&#x27;s membership bid would be made until a report being prepared by the government on negotiations and &quot;the recent changes within the union&quot; was completed, expected to be by the end of 2013. Benediktsson went on to say that &quot;we will see if a proposal will be put before the parliament or not.&quot; On 12 March 2015, Foreign Minister of Iceland Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson stated that he had sent a letter to the EU withdrawing the application for membership, without the approval of the Althing, though the European Union stated that Iceland had not formally withdrawn the application.

In 2017, Iceland&#x27;s newly elected government announced that it would hold a vote in parliament on whether to hold a referendum on resuming EU membership negotiations. However, in November 2017 that government was replaced by a coalition of the Independence Party, the Left Green Movement and the Progressive Party; all of whom oppose membership. Only 11 out of 63 MPs are in favour of EU membership.

There was a renewed call in 2022 for a referendum on resuming EU membership negotiations.

Following the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary election, the Social Democratic Alliance, Viðreisn, and People&#x27;s Party formed a new coalition government, which agreed to hold a referendum on resuming negotiations on EU membership by 2027.

The screening is a series of meetings between the commission and the applicant country examining the level of fulfilment of the EU acquis. It allows candidate countries to familiarise themselves with the acquis and it allows the commission and the member States to evaluate the degree of preparedness of candidate countries prior to negotiations.

=== Political parties&#x27; stances ===




== Public opinion ==
A poll released in January 2014 found that 67.5% of Icelanders support holding a referendum on the continuation of accession negotiations. On 22 February, the governing parties agreed to formally withdraw the membership application, without first holding a referendum on the matter, and submitted a bill to parliament seeking their approval to do so. The decision led to thousands of protesters taking to the streets outside of the Parliament buildings in Reykjavík. By 28 February 82% were in favour of holding the referendum. More than 40,000 people (16.5% of Iceland&#x27;s voters) have signed a petition demanding that the promised referendum be held. On 25 February, Ragnheiður Ríkharðsdóttir, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Independence Party, announced her intention not to vote in favour of the proposal. In early March, the EU ambassador to Iceland said that the country could keep its application suspended rather than having to decide between resuming negotiations or formally withdrawing the application, &quot;but of course not for an unlimited period of time&quot;. The bill was not approved before parliament&#x27;s summer recess.

Various polls have been taken on the public opinion of starting accession negotiations, joining the EU or adopting the euro.
==Comparison with EU countries==
If Iceland were admitted to the EU, it would be the smallest member state in terms of population. Its area (103,000 km2) is somewhat close to the average for EU countries (165,048 km2), but it would be the least densely populated country in the EU. The table below shows its population and population density in comparison to some of the other member states.

Iceland&#x27;s GDP per capita is among the highest in Europe as is shown in the following tables:
The Icelandic language would be one of the official languages of the EU with the least speakers in terms of native speakers (together with Irish and Maltese).

<text>The Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards (commonly known informally as ARIA Music Awards, ARIA Awards, or simply the ARIAs) is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry, put on by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). The event has been held annually since 1987 and encompasses the general genre-specific and popular awards (these are what is usually being referred to as &quot;the ARIA awards&quot;) as well as Fine Arts Awards and Artisan Awards (held separately from 2004), Achievement Awards and ARIA Hall of Fame – the latter were held separately from 2005 to 2010 but returned to the general ceremony in 2011. For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time.

Winning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and usually increases recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance – in 2005, for example, after Ben Lee won three awards, his album &quot;Awake Is the New Sleep&quot; jumped from No. 31 to No. 5 in the ARIA Charts, its highest position. In October 1995 singer-songwriter Tina Arena became the first woman to win Album of the Year for &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask&quot; (1994) and Song of the Year for &quot;Chains&quot;. Before the ceremony the album had achieved 3× platinum (for shipment of 210,000 copies) and by year&#x27;s end it was 8× platinum (560,000 copies) and had topped the end of year albums chart.

==History==
In 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) was established by the six major record companies then operating in Australia, EMI, Festival Records, CBS (now known as Sony Music), RCA (now known as BMG), WEA (now known as Warner Music) and PolyGram (now known as Universal) replacing the Association of Australian Record Manufacturers (AARM) which was formed in 1956. It later included smaller record companies representing independent acts/labels and has over 100 members.

Australian TV pop music show &quot;Countdown&quot; presented its own annual awards ceremony, &quot;Countdown&quot; Music and Video Awards, which were co-produced by Carolyn James (also known as Carolyn Bailey) from 1981 to 1984 and, in the latter two years, in collaboration with ARIA. ARIA provided peer voting for some awards, while &quot;Countdown&quot; provided coupons in the related &quot;Countdown Magazine&quot; for viewers to vote for populist awards. At the 1985 &quot;Countdown&quot; awards ceremony, held on 14 April 1986, fans of INXS and Uncanny X-Men scuffled during the broadcast and as a result ARIA decided to hold their own awards. Australian music journalist, Anthony O&#x27;Grady, described the fans of Uncanny X-Men, &quot;screeching dismay and derision every time their heroes were denied a prize. Finally, when INXS were announced Best Group and Michael Hutchence walked towards the stage, X-Men fans unfurled a 2-metre banner reading: &#x27;@*l! OFF POCK FACE&#x27;&quot;.

After that ceremony ARIA withdrew their support for the &quot;Countdown&quot; awards. Meanwhile, four music industry representatives had met in Sydney: a talent manager Peter Rix and three record company executives Brian Harris, Peter Ikin and Gil Robert. Rix summarised the outcome, &quot;the industry deserved a peer-voting Awards night and it needed to be sanctioned by&quot; ARIA. Its &quot;primary purpose was to strive for some sort of objective overview of excellence in recording.&quot; Rather than the ARIA board pay the entire cost of the event, &quot;we cooked up a scheme whereby the ARIA Awards would be funded by individual record companies buying tickets for a dinner.&quot; Rix and his group approached ARIA board members, Paul Turner (also managing director of WEA) and Brian Smith (BMG&#x27;s managing director) then-chairperson of ARIA. After several months of arguing for the change, Rix was appointed chair of &quot;a committee to convene the inaugural ARIA Awards&quot;.

Starting with the first ceremony, on 2 March 1987, ARIA administered its own entirely peer-voted ARIA Music Awards, to &quot;recognise excellence and innovation in all genres of Australian music&quot; with an annual ceremony. Initially included in the same awards ceremonies, it established the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1988, it held separate annual ceremonies from 2005 to 2010, the Hall of Fame returned to the general ceremony in 2011. The ARIA Hall of Fame &quot;honours Australian musicians&#x27; achievements [that] have had a significant impact in Australia or around the world&quot;.

The first ceremony, in 1987, featured Elton John as the compere and was held at the Sheraton Wentworth Hotel, Sydney. There were no live performances at the early ARIAs, music for both walk on/walk off was supplied by a nightclub dj, Rick Powell. All subsequent ceremonies were held in Sydney except the 1992 event at World Congress Centre, Melbourne. For 2010, ARIA introduced public voted awards for the first time. Winning, or even being nominated for, an ARIA award results in a lot of media attention and publicity on an artist, and may increase recording sales several-fold, as well as chart significance – in 2005, for example, after Ben Lee won three awards, his album &quot;Awake Is the New Sleep&quot; jumped from No. 31 to No. 5 in the ARIA Charts, its highest position.

===Broadcast history===
The first five ARIA Awards were &quot;not&quot; televised, at the very first award ceremony on 2 March 1987, the host, Elton John, advised the industry to keep them off television &quot;if you want these Awards to stay fun&quot;. In June of that year &quot;Countdown&quot; still had its own awards ceremony, which was televised, &quot;so there was no thought of going to TV&quot;. The first &quot;televised&quot; ARIA Awards ceremony occurred in 1992, all subsequent ceremonies were televised. They were broadcast on Network Ten from 2002 to 2008 and returned in 2010. Nine Network aired the ceremony on 26 November 2009, its digital channel, GO!, aired the 2011 ARIA Music Awards on 27 November 2011. In 2023, the ceremony will air live on Stan with a delayed broadcast on Nine Network and YouTube.

===Controversy===
At the 1988 ceremony a fracas developed between band manager, Gary Morris, accepting awards for Midnight Oil, and former &quot;Countdown&quot; compere, Ian &quot;Molly&quot; Meldrum, who was presenting. They conflicted over visiting United Kingdom artist, Bryan Ferry, who had also presented an award. Morris objected to Ferry&#x27;s presence and insulted him, Meldrum defended Ferry and then scuffled with Morris. Also in that year Midnight Oil were nominated for Best Indigenous Record for &quot;Diesel and Dust&quot; despite having no Indigenous members. Morris objected to that decision by ARIA, &quot;an Indigenous Award should go to an indigenous band&quot;. In 1995 electronic music group, Itch-E and Scratch-E, won the inaugural award for &quot;Best Dance Release&quot; for their single, &quot;Sweetness and Light&quot;. Band member, Paul Mac thanked Sydney&#x27;s ecstasy dealers for their help. One of the sponsors of the awards, that year, was the National Drug Offensive. In 2005 Mac explained that he did not expect to win and so had not prepared a speech. His speech was bleeped for the TV broadcast.

During the 2004 voting process, former 3RRR radio DJ Cousin Creep (also known as Craig Barnes), published his user name and password on a music site, Rocknerd, allowing public votes, before being removed from voting two days later. The 2007 ARIA Awards telecast was marred by controversy after it was revealed by the ABC&#x27;s &quot;Media Watch&quot; programme that Network Ten had used subliminal advertising during the course of the broadcast, which under the Australian Media and Broadcasting rules is illegal. Network Ten disputed the finding; however, their basis for defence was criticised by &quot;Media Watch&quot;, demonstrating an ignorance of the rules.

Tony Cohen, a record producer and audio engineer for Nick Cave and the Cruel Sea, who won three Artisan Awards in mid-1990s, described the ARIA Board&#x27;s determination of general award winners, &quot;I find them a bit hypocritical those ARIAs. I mean, the awards for the technical people are quite honest but the ones for the actual artists, basically the record companies just sit down at a meeting and decide which one of their acts are going to win this year and all, that sort of thing. It&#x27;s like a promotion thing.&quot; He specifically pointed to Gabriella Cilmi&#x27;s winning six trophies in 2008, &quot;like that girl who won everything... who only had one song. It&#x27;s a great song but, I mean, I&#x27;d rather see a little longevity first... I wish her luck and everything but you just don&#x27;t, especially with kids that young.&quot;

The 2010 telecast was criticised in media reports: Crikey&#x27;s Neil Walker decried the &quot;infamously shambolic Sydney Opera House fiasco&quot;, The Punch&#x27;s Rebekah Devlin speculated on it being the worst ever telecast, &quot;it felt like we&#x27;d stumbled into some raging A-list party and we definitely weren&#x27;t invited [...] Guests who were there said it was a great night, but it reignites the debate of what the Arias are actually all about… is it an event staged for the musicians and the people there, or is it for a TV audience?&quot;, while &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;″s Kathy McCabe felt the &quot;underlying problem with the past two years&#x27; telecasts is they have tried to be all things to all people and do way too much&quot; and advised that ARIA should get &quot;professionals to do the job professionally, give them ample time to rehearse and allow them to protest when the words just don&#x27;t work&quot;. In 2011 Dallas Crane&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist, Dave Larkin hoped for improvement from ARIA and the telecast, &quot;[s]o gross was last year&#x27;s &#x27;stubby-on-the-opera-house-steps&#x27; screaming match, that it still burns a brutal reflux just thinking what horrible depths our embattled industry and its unfortunate viewership plummeted to on that grievous evening of small screen hell&quot; and felt their main flaw was that the &quot;ARIAs never seem to take enough time or pride educating the masses on our local industry legends ... There never seems to be enough reference or homage paid to great Aussie pop and rock trailblazers who made and continue to make Australian music what it is today&quot;.

==Nomination process==
To be eligible, a release must be commercially available within the specified period for a given year. Material must be previously unrecorded, thus ruling out most live albums. A recording can be nominated within multiple categories, but only one genre category (for example, an album could not be simultaneously nominated for Best Pop Release and Best Dance Release). Re-released recordings are not eligible and compilations are not eligible.

Artists must either be Australian citizens, or have applied for or attained permanent resident status and have resided in Australia for at least six months within the specified period. For bands, at least half the members of the group must meet this requirement. If a recording refers to both an individual and a band (for example, Dan Kelly &amp; the Alpha Males), it must be nominated only the basis of the individual or the band, not mixed or both.

Some categories have further requirements as specified below:

* Album/Single of the Year: Recording must appear in the ARIA Top 100 Albums or Singles chart respectively during the specified period.
* Breakthrough Artist (Album/Single): Artist must not have previously reached the final five nominations in any ARIA awards category for any release, or have been in a group that has done so, or have a previous release in the Top 50 release charts.
* Best Rock Album: &quot;Recording must be directed toward Contemporary Rock, Modern Rock and Active Rock formats.&quot;
* Best Adult Contemporary Album: &quot;Recording must be directed toward Adult Contemporary formats.&quot;
* Best Pop Release: &quot;Recording must be directed toward CHR/Top 40 formats.&quot;
* Best Independent Release: Recording must be released and funded by an ARIA member that is not a member of a multinational corporation.
* Best Music DVD: Compilations may enter this category. Content must be at least 60% original. The release must be eligible to appear on the ARIA Music DVD chart (this means most &quot;bonus disc&quot; releases are unlikely to be eligible).
* Best Comedy Release: Compilations are acceptable. Album, single and DVD releases are all eligible. Content must be 100% original.
* Best Children&#x27;s Album: Compilations are acceptable (but content must be 100% original, having been recorded specifically for that album). Form and content must be aimed at a pre-teen audience.
* Best Dance Release: Compilations are acceptable. &quot;Artists working primarily within the dance genre, e.g.: House, Techno, Trance, Hardcore, Garage, Breakbeat, Drum &amp; Bass, Disco and Electronica are eligible. In the case of a remixed album or single, the production team(s) and the original recording artist(s) must both meet the artist eligibility criteria, and the release must qualify for inclusion in either the ARIA Album or Single chart.&quot;
* Best Urban Release: &quot;Artists working primarily within the urban genre, e.g.: R&amp;B, hip-hop, soul, funk, reggae, and dancehall, are eligible. In the case of a remixed album or single, the production team(s) and the original recording artist(s) must both meet the artist eligibility criteria, and the release must qualify for inclusion in either the ARIA Album or Single chart. The ARIA member must also nominate whether the production team or the original recording artist would be the recipient of the award.&quot; This category was discontinued in 2018 and replaced by Best Hip Hop Release and Best Soul/R&amp;B Release from 2019.
* Sales awards: A company may enter up to five recordings in a category. For these categories, the recording does not have to be first released during the specified period, so these categories are two of the few where recordings can be nominated more than once. These categories were discontinued in 2010.

==Judging process==

Sales awards are judged by an independent audit. The Hall of Fame and Lifetime Achievement awards are awarded at the discretion of the ARIA Board. Genre categories are judged by &quot;voting schools&quot; that consist of 40–100 representatives from that genre. The remaining generalist categories are the &quot;voting academy&quot;, which, in 2009, consisted of 1106 representatives from across the music industry.

Members of the academy are kept secret. Membership is by invitation only. An individual record company may have up to eight members on the academy. The only artists eligible to vote are winners and nominees from the previous year&#x27;s awards.

==Categories==
The ARIA Awards are given in four fields: ARIA Awards (for general and genre categories), Fine Arts, Artisan and Public Vote. With the exception of the Public Vote field, all award winners and nominees are determined by either a &quot;voting academy&quot; or a &quot;judging school&quot;; the nominees for the public voted categories are determined by ARIA with the public choosing the winner.
In the following tables, all the categories are listed in order of the year they were first given; any box in the &quot;last awarded&quot; column that says &quot;N/A&quot; is a current award. The years are linked to their corresponding ceremony and the ordinal numbers beside the year correspond to the order they were presented.

===Current===
===Retired===
*Note: Originally awarded at the same ceremony as the ARIA Awards, the ARIA Fine Arts and Artisan Awards have been awarded at a separate ceremony from 2004. In 2020 both Fine Arts and Artisan Awards returned to the general ceremony.

===Hall of Fame and achievement awards===

ARIA Hall of Fame inductees have been installed annually from the category&#x27;s inception, as from 1988 except 2000 and 2021 (no inductees), ARIA Outstanding Achievement Awards (periodically, first in 1988), ARIA Special Achievement Awards (periodically, first awarded in 1989), ARIA Lifetime Achievement Awards (periodically, first awarded in 1991) and ARIA Icon Awards (first in 2013).

Originally artists were inducted into the Hall of Fame at the same ceremony as the ARIA Awards, in 2005 the inaugural ARIA Icons: Hall of Fame ceremony was held separately with another inductee at the later ARIA Awards ceremony — from 2008 to 2010 the ARIA Hall of Fame ceremony was a stand-alone event with no later inductees. From 2011 the Hall of Fame ceremony was held at the same time as the ARIA Awards.

==The trophy==
The ARIA award trophy, used since 1990, is a tall triangular pyramid made of solid stainless steel. The 1987–1989 trophies were designed by Philip Mortlock, while the 1990 design was by Mark Denning. The Channel V award which is V-shaped, and silver, or in the case of the award of 2008, red. As from 2005, The Hall of Fame trophy, from the Denning design, was golden coloured metal with ARIA printed in black near the base on two sides, on the third side is the award title (ARIA ICONS: HALL OF FAME), awardee name and date printed on a plaque.

<text>Speke Hall is a wood-framed wattle-and-daub Tudor manor house in Speke, Liverpool, England. It is one of the finest surviving examples of its kind. It is owned by the National Trust and is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
Construction of the current building began under Sir William Norris in 1530, though earlier buildings had been on the site, parts of which are incorporated into today&#x27;s structure. The Great Hall was the first part of the house to be built, in 1530. The Great (or Oak) Parlour wing was added in 1531. Around this time the North Bay was also added to the house. Between 1540 and 1570 the south wing was altered and extended. The west wing was added between 1546 and 1547. The last significant change to the building was in 1598, when the north range was added by Edward Norris. Since then there have only been minor changes to the Hall and gardens.

The oak frame, typical of the period, rests on a base of red sandstone surrounded by a now dry moat. The main beams of the house are stiffened with smaller timbers and filled with wattle and daub.

During the turmoil of the Reformation the Norrises were Roman Catholics so the house incorporated a priest hole and a special observation hole built into a chimney in a bedroom to allow the occupant to see the approach to the house to warn the priest that people were coming. There is also an eavesdrop (a small open hole under the eaves of the house) which allowed a servant to listen in on the conversations of people awaiting admission at the original front door.

In 1612 a porch was added to the Great Parlour. A laundry and dairy were founded in 1860; the laundry was altered in the 1950s.
The house was owned by the Norris family for many generations until 1736 when Mary Norris, the heiress, married Lord Sidney Beauclerk. After Mary&#x27;s death in 1766 the house was leased to various tenants. Richard Watt, a Liverpool merchant, purchased the house and estate from the Beauclerks in 1795. The last surviving heir of the Watt family was Miss Adelaide Watt, who inherited the house and returned to it in 1878 at the age of 21 years. She died in 1921, leaving the house and estate in trust for 21 years, during which time it was looked after by the staff under the supervision of Thomas Whatmore, who had been butler to Miss Watt. At the end of this period, in 1943, the house passed into the ownership of the National Trust. The house was administered by Liverpool City Corporation from 1946 until 1974 when it passed to Merseyside County Council who carried out a seven-year programme of major structural repairs and restoration which was completed in 1983. The National Trust took over full responsibility in 1986.

The gardens date from the 1850s. In the courtyard of the main building are two ancient yew trees, male and female, called &#x27;Adam&#x27; and &#x27;Eve&#x27;. First recorded in correspondence dating to 1712, they are estimated to be at least 500 years old.

==21st century==
The Home Farm building has been renovated and now houses the shop, restaurant and reception. The laundry has been converted into the education room and the dairy contains interpretation material. Furthermore, rooms such as a gun room have been changed over the years and then changed back by the National Trust in order to show more of the History of Speke Hall. Walks in the grounds give panoramic views over the Mersey estuary towards the Wirral Peninsula. Liverpool John Lennon Airport is adjacent to Speke Hall. The house received 224,913 visitors in 2019.

==In Art and Literature==

An engraving of a painting of the great hall by Thomas Allom was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1835, with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.

<doc id="1078285" wikidata="Q536336" url="?curid=1078285" title="The Unforgettable Fire">
<text>The Unforgettable Fire is the fourth studio album by Irish rock band U2. It was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, and released on 1 October 1984 by Island Records. The band wanted to pursue a new musical direction following the harder-hitting rock of their previous album, &quot;War&quot; (1983). As a result, they employed Eno and Lanois to produce and assist in their experimentation with a more ambient sound. The resulting change in direction was at the time the band&#x27;s most dramatic. The album&#x27;s title is a reference to &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, an art exhibit about the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

Recording began in May 1984 at Slane Castle, where the band lived, wrote, and recorded to find new inspiration. The album was completed in August 1984 at Windmill Lane Studios. It features atmospheric sounds and lyrics that lead vocalist Bono describes as &quot;sketches&quot;. &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; and &quot;MLK&quot; are lyrical tributes to Martin Luther King Jr.

&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; received generally favourable reviews from critics and produced the band&#x27;s biggest hit at the time, &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, as well as the live favourite &quot;Bad&quot;. A 25th anniversary edition of the album was released in October 2009.

==Background==
U2 feared that following the overt rock of their 1983 album &quot;War&quot; and the War Tour, they were in danger of becoming another &quot;shrill&quot;, &quot;sloganeering arena-rock band&quot;. Following their concert at Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park Racecourse in August 1983, one of the final dates of the War Tour, lead vocalist Bono spoke in metaphors about the group breaking up and reforming with a different direction. In the 10th issue of &quot;U2 Magazine&quot;, released in February 1984, Bono hinted at radical changes on the next album saying that he could not &quot;sleep at night with the thought of it all&quot; and that they were &quot;undertaking a real departure&quot;. As bassist Adam Clayton recalls, &quot;We were looking for something that was a bit more serious, more arty.&quot;

After completing the War Tour in Japan late that year, U2 rehearsed at Bono&#x27;s seaside home in a Martello tower in Bray, County Wicklow. During this time, early versions of the songs &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, and &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; were composed.

U2 had recorded their first three albums at Windmill Lane Studios but decided to find a new location for their next studio album. Clayton lamented the lack of a live room in which the band could play together at Windmill Lane, while the band&#x27;s manager Paul McGuinness said the studio had barely enough space for people to work. He set to finding a new location and came up with Church Hall in Ranelagh, but he found it overpriced. The band&#x27;s tour manager Dennis Sheehan also searched for suitable locations and found Slane Castle in County Meath. The building&#x27;s owner, Lord Henry Mountcharles, offered to lease it to the group for less than half the cost of Church Hall, and also offered lodging and dining for the band and crew on-premises. The castle&#x27;s Gothic ballroom, which was originally built for music and had a 30-foot high domed ceiling, also attracted the band, as they were looking to capture the natural acoustics of a room in their recordings.

After working with producer Steve Lillywhite on their first three albums, the band sought experimentation rather than to create the &quot;son of &quot;War&quot;&quot;. Both Lillywhite and the group agreed that it was time for a change of producers and that they should not &quot;repeat the same formula&quot;. For their next studio album, the band considered hiring Conny Plank, whose previous production credits included Can, Kraftwerk, and Ultravox. U2 also met with Roxy Music producer Rhett Davies, but Clayton said that it &quot;didn&#x27;t really go anywhere&quot;. They also considered Jimmy Iovine, who had produced their live album &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; in 1983, but they found their early musical ideas for the new album to be too &quot;European&quot; for an American producer. Iovine thought that he was in line for the job and went so far as to hold a meeting about recording logistics at Slane Castle with his engineer Shelly Yakus and with another engineer Randy Ezratty, whose mobile recording studio U2 would be using once again. However, at the last minute, McGuinness informed Ezratty that they would be proceeding with different producers.

U2 instead had turned their attention to hiring musician/producer Brian Eno. Guitarist the Edge had long admired Eno&#x27;s music, particularly his ambient and &quot;weird works&quot;. The group were also fond of his collaborations with Talking Heads. Eno was hesitant to work with a rock band and when contacted by U2, he told them he was considering retiring from music production to become a video artist. Reluctantly, Eno agreed to meet with the band in Dublin and brought along his engineer Daniel Lanois with the intention of recommending he work with them instead; Lanois had his own ambitions of producing a rock band. When the band played &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; to Eno, his eyes &quot;glazed over&quot;. The Edge said of him: &quot;I think he was intimidated by the lack of irony in what we were doing. He&#x27;d come from Talking Heads, the Rhode Island School of Design, living in New York, and here was this Irish band hitting everything full on, completely earnest, hearts on sleeves, no irony at all.&quot; Eno also thought that the group were &quot;frightened of being overpowered by some softness&quot;. His doubts were resolved by Bono&#x27;s persuasiveness and his increasing perception of what he called &quot;U2&#x27;s lyrical soul in abundance&quot;. Eno was impressed by how they spoke, which was not in terms of music or playing, but in terms of their contributions to the &quot;identity of the band as a whole&quot;. The band&#x27;s discussion about pursuing different recording techniques and capturing the ambience of a recording space also piqued his interest. Ultimately, Eno and Lanois agreed to produce the record with the understanding that if Eno&#x27;s working relationship with U2 was not fruitful, they would still have a solid producer in Lanois on which they could fall back.

Island Records founder Chris Blackwell initially tried to talk U2 out of hiring Eno, believing that just when they were about to achieve the highest levels of success, Eno would &quot;bury them under a layer of avant-garde nonsense&quot;. Nick Stewart, also of Island Records, thought the band were &quot;mad&quot;. Blackwell instructed him to dissuade U2 from working with Eno; Stewart recalled Blackwell telling him, &quot;You better sort your band out because they&#x27;re going in a very odd direction.&quot; Stewart was unable to change their minds, prompting Blackwell to fly to Dublin to meet with the group. Ultimately, Blackwell too was convinced by Bono&#x27;s persuasiveness and the band&#x27;s enthusiasm for the collaboration. Stewart said that in hindsight, the group&#x27;s decision to stretch themselves and find an extra dimension became the &quot;turning point in their career&quot;.

==Recording and production==

The band arrived at Slane Castle on 7 May 1984 for a month-long recording session. A makeshift control room was set up in the castle&#x27;s drawing room. Ezratty&#x27;s company Effanel Music, which recorded U2&#x27;s concerts in Boston and at Red Rocks Amphitheatre the previous year, was hired to provide their then-unique portable 24-track recording system. The equipment, which came in wheeling flight cases with removable lids, was described by Lanois as a &quot;heavily modified Sound Workshop mixing console with a tape recorder&quot;. He said it was not the &quot;ultimate technical system&quot; but that the priority was to capture the feeling of the band&#x27;s music. Ezratty&#x27;s equipment was set up in the castle&#x27;s library, dubbed the Chinese Room, with cables running into the adjacent ballroom where the band played. The band and crew lived at the castle during the sessions, helping to foster a camaraderie among them. The site provided a relaxed and experimental atmosphere.
U2 worked long days at the castle, sometimes starting at 10 a.m. and finishing at 1 a.m. Eno, who worked on a more &quot;executive schedule&quot; than other members of the creative team, was focused on creative ideas and conceptual aspects, while Lanois handled the production duties. In Bill Graham&#x27;s words, Eno&#x27;s task was to &quot;help [U2] mature a new, more experimental and European musical vocabulary&quot;. Eno was glad that the group began the sessions with only rough sketches of songs, as he was more interested in encouraging experimentation and improvisation than refining their ideas. To that end, he often created atmospheric compositions on a synthesiser that were intended to inspire U2 and Lanois to play along with. Bono and the Edge, who the singer described as the &quot;more cerebral&quot; members of the band, were particularly drawn to Eno&#x27;s ideas. The band&#x27;s experiments produced 15 additional pieces of music. The Edge said that they &quot;didn&#x27;t object to [Eno] taking liberties with what [they] had achieved up to that point&quot;, adding: &quot;We were eager to learn and not precious at all about our sound or the way we worked. We threw ourselves wholeheartedly into this different approach.&quot; According to the Edge, Eno&#x27;s points of reference were philosophy and contemporary art, and he was not beholden to the standard schools of thought in rock music. The producer encouraged U2 to work on their more unconventional material, &quot;champion[ing] the songs that didn&#x27;t seem very U2-ish or things that had strong beginnings but no clear destination&quot;. As a result, he did not take much interest in songs like &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; or &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. Lanois would &quot;cover for him&quot; such that the two balanced each other out.

Since U2 had primarily been interested in working with Eno, Lanois was initially viewed as an &quot;interloper&quot;, which caused tension at the start of the sessions, according to Ezratty. Once the band realised his musical talents, they embraced him as a fellow collaborator. As a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Lanois understood musical notation and was able to simplify the songwriting process for them. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. in particular enjoyed working with Lanois, as the producer took an interest in the band&#x27;s rhythm section, which Mullen felt had been neglected on their past recordings. Mullen called himself &quot;not technically proficient&quot; and appreciated Lanois spending time to develop his skills and encourage different approaches to playing drums. The producer convinced Mullen to utilise timbales and two types of snare drums (one being a piccolo snare) in his drum kit, and he explained how to use brushes and tom-toms on various drum parts. The crew also experimented with distant miking of his drum kit, placing microphones up to 60 feet away. Mullen eschewed wearing headphones while playing and instead used monitor speakers, which caused audio spill issues with other microphones in the recording space.

The Edge said that the band&#x27;s plan for recording at Slane was rather than working in the &quot;dead, acoustic atmosphere&quot; of a studio and &quot;trying to revitalise the recorded work using effects and reverberation and all the standard music trappings, we would go into a very live room and try to do the opposite—try and tame what would be a wild sound&quot;. Lanois originally intended for the band to record entirely in the ballroom, which he described as a &quot;beautiful very tall room with big mirrors, chandeliers and windows overlooking the river&quot;. Shortly after their arrival, the team realised that the ballroom had too much natural reverberation, necessitating the addition of sound absorption materials such as drapes to the walls. Lanois said the room was only suitable for songs with &quot;openness but not good for tracks that were quick and required punch&quot;, while crew member Stephen Rainford said, &quot;Okay for chamber music, but no good for rock and roll&quot;. Consequently, most of the recording took place in the library, which was smaller, rectangular, filled with books, and provided improved sound quality. Lanois said the room helped them &quot;achieve a denser more powerful sound&quot; on their recordings. Adding to the recording challenges was the water wheel generator on River Boyne that powered the building. During low tide or periods of no rain, there was not sufficient power to keep their recording equipment operational. Ezratty said, &quot;When that stupid river started to run low, the voltage would go down and it would beat the crap out of my equipment.&quot; As a backup, the team were forced to make use of an old diesel generator, which at times broke down or caught fire.
The Edge was encouraged by Eno to think of the studio as an instrument and to expand the range of his guitar tones, resulting in experiments with his equipment and guitar playing techniques. The producer processed the Edge&#x27;s guitar through an AMS harmonizer effects unit, a Lexicon Prime Time delay unit, and a reverb chamber; Lanois at times confused the guitar sounds for keyboards. The Edge also used an EBow, a slide with echo, alternative guitar tunings, and a &quot;zero sustain&quot; technique that muted his strings with tape across the bridge. He experimented with the placement and miking of his guitar amplifier. At times, it was situated outside on the balcony encircling the castle, with close miking and, when it rained, a plastic cover to shield it. This placement was originally done for sound isolation purposes, but ended up producing a good sound. Other times, his amplifier was placed at the bottom of a staircase, with one microphone there and another placed at the top of the staircase.

A Fairlight CMI synthesiser was used during the demoing phase out of convenience to help fill in placeholder textures and string ideas, marking the first time the instrument had been used on a U2 album. These textures were later replaced with actual string arrangements, although the Fairlight CMI was kept on one song. Clayton said the synthesiser &quot;was only really used as a means to an end, to see if an idea worked&quot;. Eno contributed synthesiser parts on a Yamaha DX7, while he and the Edge also played a Yamaha CP-70 electric grand piano.

Bono recorded his vocals on Neumann U47 and U67 and AKG C-12 microphones. Lanois said that they captured a warm sound and a &quot;bottom end and depth&quot; to Bono&#x27;s vocals. For &quot;Promenade&quot;, one of the first songs for which vocals were recorded, Lanois encouraged Bono to sing quieter by increasing the volume of his vocals in his headphones. By doing so, the producer was able to force Bono to &quot;draw on the fine points of the voice&quot;.
The band finished recording at Slane Castle on 5 June and began a second phase of the recording sessions at Windmill Lane Studios the following day. Their original intent was to record the backing tracks at Slane before overdubbing and mixing at Windmill Lane. Clayton said this was because the mobile recording equipment did not offer them as many options or treatment possibilities as a traditional studio mixing console would. However, the group ended up crafting their songs at Windmill Lane more than they originally anticipated, including re-recording &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot;. The Edge reflected that when recording at a new location such as Slane, it took them a few weeks to &quot;get in to the momentum of the new creative surrounding&quot;. Lanois said that in hindsight the recording sessions were &quot;split in a slightly off-balanced fashion&quot;, with too much time being dedicated to experimenting and not enough to fundamental recording. Within the band, there were concerns that their material recorded at Slane was too skeletal to consider completing yet, prompting them to re-evaluate and in some cases re-record it. Eno, on the other hand, was more interested in recording as few takes as possible and preserving the rough, spontaneous nature of the music. Clayton said that Eno would get easily bored if he had nothing to do, while Mullen said he was impatient with U2&#x27;s creative process. Tension grew between them and the production team, largely because the band &quot;weren&#x27;t at a point where [they] could finish anything&quot;.

Throughout the recording sessions, Bono had been ad-libbing his vocals, without completing lyrics. Mullen explained that the group&#x27;s reliance on Bono to help complete the musical composition of their songs took time away from him to work on the lyrics independently: &quot;While recording, we seemed to do our best work when we were in the room together. We depended on Bono to be there, every step of the way. He had to be singing something, anything, to get the song finished. When Bono came in and strapped on a guitar or started to sing, the band responded... A song recorded in the room with Bono and a song recorded without him could be very different animals altogether.&quot; Whereas Bono wanted to finalise the lyrics, Eno, Lanois, and the Edge advocated preserving the improvised nature of his vocals, telling the singer, &quot;Why write lyrics?... I&#x27;m getting the feeling from this.&quot; In retrospect, Bono lamented leaving the lyrics to songs like &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; as incomplete &quot;sketches&quot;.

Twelve days before the deadline to complete the record, Bono told his bandmates he did not think he would be able to finish the lyrics in time, creating a panic internally. McGuinness reminded the group of their commitment to tour Australia and New Zealand in less than a month, and that the producers and studio would not be available afterwards. To complete the album, the band worked 20-hour days for the final two weeks; Eno worked the first half of days, while Lanois worked the second half. Eno departed before the album was completed, leaving Lanois to oversee the final mixes. On their final day in the studio, the band worked overnight to complete the album by 7–8 a.m. on 5 August. As Lanois was preparing to depart for London with the album tapes for mastering, Bono expressed interest in recording another take of his vocals for &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;. With his taxi to the airport waiting outside, Lanois cued up the tapes for Bono to record one final vocal take. Lanois told the band he would mix it in London and then departed, delivering the tapes for mastering in the basement of Blackwell&#x27;s offices.

Portions of the recording sessions were filmed by Barry Devlin and his crew for an RTÉ-TV documentary. The 30-minute programme, &quot;The Making of The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, was released in 1985 on VHS as part of &quot;The Unforgettable Fire Collection&quot;. Devlin said that he did not think the band and crew had thought through the logistics and access required for a film crew to document the making of the album. He often encountered &quot;No Entry&quot; signs on doors and windows when attempting to film the group, forcing him to take a more artful, impressionistic approach to the documentary.

==Composition==
A far more atmospheric album than the previous &quot;War&quot;, &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; was at the time the band&#x27;s most dramatic change in direction. It has a rich and orchestrated sound and was the first U2 album with a cohesive sound. Under Lanois&#x27;s direction, Mullen&#x27;s drumming became looser, funkier and more subtle, and Clayton&#x27;s bass became more subliminal, such that the rhythm section no longer intruded, but flowed in support of the songs. Eno&#x27;s atmospheric production, along with more experimental song structures, lent the album an &quot;art-rock sensibility&quot; and &quot;atmospheric rock&quot; style that departed from U2&#x27;s &quot;hard-hitting post-punk roots&quot;, according to &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s Luke Larson. Both &quot;Stereogum&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also observed art rock on the album, while &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;″s Christopher Gray said &quot;the rich textures, impressionistic tableaux, and cinematic landscapes&quot; may not be &quot;art rock &quot;per se&quot;&quot;, but still &quot;served to distance U2 even further from their post-punk peers&quot;.

The opening track, &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;, immediately shows the change in U2&#x27;s sound. Like much of the album, the hard-hitting martial drum sound of &quot;War&quot; was replaced with a subtler polyrhythmic shuffle, and the guitar was no longer as prominent in the mix. Typical of the album, the track &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, with a string arrangement by Noel Kelehan, has a rich, symphonic sound built from ambient guitar and driving rhythm, along with a lyrical &quot;sketch&quot; that is an &quot;emotional travelogue&quot; with a &quot;heartfelt sense of yearning&quot;. The band cited a travelling Japanese art exhibit of the same name as inspiration for both the song and album title. The exhibition, which the band attended in Chicago, commemorated the victims of the bombing of Hiroshima. However, the open-ended lyric, which Bono says &quot;doesn&#x27;t tell you anything&quot;, does not directly reference nuclear warfare. Rather, the lyrics are about travelling to Tokyo.

The album&#x27;s lyrics are open to many interpretations, which alongside its atmospheric sounds, provides what the band often called a &quot;very visual feel&quot;. Bono had recently been immersing himself in fiction, philosophy and poetry, and came to realise that his song writing mission—which up to that point had been a reluctant one on his behalf—was a poetic one. Bono felt songs like &quot;Bad&quot; and &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; were best left as incomplete &quot;sketches&quot;, and he said that &quot;&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; was a beautifully out-of-focus record, blurred like an impressionist painting, very unlike a billboard or an advertising slogan.&quot;

The melody and the chords to &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; originally came out of a 1983 War Tour sound check in Hawaii. The song was originally intended to be about Ronald Reagan&#x27;s pride in America&#x27;s military power, but Bono was influenced by Stephen B. Oates&#x27;s book about Martin Luther King Jr. titled &quot;Let The Trumpet Sound: A Life of Martin Luther King, Jr.&quot; and a biography of Malcolm X to ponder the different sides of the civil rights campaigns, the violent and the non-violent. Bono would revise the lyrics to pay tribute to King. &quot;Pride&quot; went through many changes and re-recordings, as captured in a documentary included on &quot;The Unforgettable Fire Collection&quot; video. &quot;Pride&quot; is the most conventional song on the album—Tony Fletcher of &quot;Jamming!&quot; magazine said at the time it was the most commercial song U2 had written—and it was chosen as the album&#x27;s first single.

On &quot;Wire&quot; Bono tried to convey his ambivalence to drugs. It is a fast-paced song built on a light funk drum groove. The song shows the influence of Talking Heads, with whom Eno had worked. Much of the song was improvised by Bono at the microphone.

The ambient instrumental &quot;4th of July&quot; came about almost entirely through a moment of inspiration from Eno. At the end of a studio session, Eno overheard Clayton improvising a simple bass figure and recorded it &quot;ad hoc&quot; as it was being played. The Edge happened to join in, improvising a few guitar ideas over the top of Clayton&#x27;s bass; neither knew they were being recorded. Eno added some treatments and then transferred the piece straight to two-track master tape—and that was the song finished, with no possibility of further overdubs.

Bono tried to describe the rush and then come down of heroin use in the song &quot;Bad&quot;.

The sparse, dreamlike &quot;MLK&quot; was written as an elegy to King.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; was released on 1 October 1984. The album took its name and much of its inspiration from a Japanese travelling exhibition of paintings and drawings at The Peace Museum in Chicago by survivors of the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. The band spent a few days driving around Ireland with photographer Anton Corbijn looking for potential locations. The castle depicted on the cover is Moydrum Castle. The band liked the image&#x27;s ambiguity and the Irish mysticism they saw in it. The photograph, however, was a virtual copy of a picture on the cover of a 1980 book &quot;In Ruins: The Once Great Houses of Ireland&quot; by Simon Marsden. It was taken from the same spot and used the same photographic techniques, but with the addition of the four band members. For this copyright infringement, the band had to pay an unknown sum to Marsden.

&quot;Pride (In the Name of Love)&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in September 1984, and it was at that point the band&#x27;s biggest hit. It cracked the UK Top 5 and the U.S. Top 40 and would ultimately become the group&#x27;s most frequently played song in concerts.

&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; was released as the second single in April 1985. The song became the band&#x27;s third Top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number six on the UK Singles Chart and number 8 on the Dutch singles chart, but did not perform as well in the U.S.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release, reviews were generally favorable. Paul Du Noyer of &quot;NME&quot; praised the album and the new Eno–Lanois production team. The review said: &quot;The old four-square rock unit has been deconstructed. In its place there&#x27;s a panoramic soundscape, multiple textures, subtle shifts in emphasis.&quot; Tony Fletcher from &quot;Jamming!&quot; said it was not &quot;an album full of hits. [It is however] a forceful collection of atmospheric ideas and themes, forgettable at first but strangely haunting and soon firmly implanted.&quot; Fletcher added that Eno&#x27;s production removed some of the &quot;heavy metal&quot; from U2 and replaced &quot;emotion [as] the driving force&quot;. &quot;Hot Press&quot; hailed the arrival of producer Brian Eno as &quot;a bold move&quot;. Reviewer Liam Mackey said that the album was &quot;rich and rewarding&quot;.

In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Adam Sweeting said &quot;&quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; is the other side of the coin from &quot;War&quot;. Where the latter opened with the shattering paramilitary drumbeat of &#x27;Sunday Bloody Sunday&#x27;... &quot;Fire&quot; launches into the long shimmer of &#x27;A Sort Of Homecoming,&#x27; whose sort-of-mystical lyric adorns the romantic maroon-and-gold sleeve. The fact is, if you bring your established conception of U2 to this record, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.&quot; Kurt Loder was more critical in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;U2 flickers and nearly fades, its fire banked by a misconceived production strategy and occasional interludes of soggy, songless self-indulgence. This is not a &#x27;bad&#x27; album, but neither is it the irrefutable beauty the band&#x27;s fans anticipated.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau felt Bono&#x27;s moralizing and &quot;wild romantic idealism&quot; proved careless, specifically on &quot;Pride&quot; and &quot;Elvis Presley and America&quot;, but concluded that those qualities work well enough for him throughout the rest of the album &quot;to make a skeptic believe temporarily in miracles&quot;. At the end of 1984, it was voted the 29th best record of the year in the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;.

==Touring==
In support of the album, the band embarked on a worldwide concert tour, the Unforgettable Fire Tour, which saw U2 shows moving into indoor arenas in the United States. Consisting of six legs and 112 shows, the tour commenced in New Zealand in August 1984 where translating the elaborate and complex textures of the new studio-recorded tracks to live performance proved to be a serious challenge. One solution was programmed sequencers, which the band had previously been reluctant to use. Sequencers were prominently used on songs like &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;; sequencers are now used on the majority of U2 songs in live performances. Songs criticised as being &quot;unfinished&quot;, &quot;fuzzy&quot; and &quot;unfocused&quot; on the album made more sense on stage. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, for example, critical of the album version of &quot;Bad&quot;, described its live performance as a &quot;show stopper&quot;.

In March 1985, a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story called U2 the &quot;Band of the 80&#x27;s,&quot; saying that &quot;for a growing number of rock-and-roll fans, U2 have become the band that matters most, maybe even the only band that matters.&quot; In July 1985, U2 participated in the Live Aid benefit concert at Wembley Stadium for Ethiopian famine relief. Their performance was one of the show&#x27;s most memorable; during a 12-minute performance of the song &quot;Bad&quot;, Bono climbed down from the stage to embrace and dance with a female fan he had picked out of the crowd. The length of the song&#x27;s performance cut their set short by a song. Although the group initially believed they had &quot;blown it&quot;, it was, in fact, a breakthrough moment for them, showing a television audience of millions the personal connection that Bono could make with fans. All of U2&#x27;s previous albums returned to the charts in the UK after their performance.

==Legacy==
Retrospectively, Bill Graham of &quot;Hot Press&quot; wrote in 1996 that &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; was U2&#x27;s most pivotal album and that it was &quot;their coming of age that saved their lives as a creative unit.&quot; Niall Stokes, also of &quot;Hot Press&quot;, said that &quot;one or two tracks were undercooked&quot; due to the deadline crush but that it was the group&#x27;s &quot;first album with a cohesive sound&quot; on which &quot;U2 were reborn&quot;. By contrast, it was also included in the 1991 book &quot;The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time&quot;. In 2009, reviewing the album&#x27;s deluxe edition, Will Hermes of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubbed the album a &quot;transitional, hit-or-miss set&quot;, but noted, &quot;When things click, it bridges [&quot;War&quot;]″s fight-the-power arena rock with the texture fetishism of... &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;.&quot; Ryan Dombal of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; as &quot;a transitional album of the highest magnitude&quot; which &quot;ebbs and flows along the spectrum between the spiky, post-punk U2 of old and the impressionistic, Eno-assisted U2 they were yearning to become.&quot; In 2023, Robert Crawford of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; ranked &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; U2&#x27;s fourth-best album, calling it &quot;soft-hued and shimmering, balanced equally between moody song sketches and sharply-written singles&quot; and crediting the change in producers for contributing to the band&#x27;s development. The album ranks at 15 on Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 albums.

<text>Thomas Willing (December 19, 1731 – January 19, 1821) was an American merchant, politician and slave trader who served as mayor of Philadelphia and was a delegate from Pennsylvania to the Continental Congress. He also served as the first president of the Bank of North America and the First Bank of the United States. During his tenure there he became the richest man in America.

==Early life==
Thomas Willing was born in Philadelphia, the son of Charles Willing (1710–1754), who twice served as mayor of Philadelphia, and Anne Shippen (1710-1791), granddaughter of Edward Shippen, who was the second mayor of Philadelphia. His brother, James Willing, was a Philadelphia merchant who later served as a representative of the Continental Congress and led a 1778 military expedition to raid holdings of British loyalists in Natchez, Mississippi.

Thomas completed preparatory studies in Bath, England, then studied law in London at the Inner Temple.

==Career==
In 1749, after studying in England, he returned to Philadelphia, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits in partnership with Robert Morris. They established the firm Willing, Morris and Company in 1757, which exported flour, lumber and tobacco to Europe while importing sugar, rum, molasses, and slaves from the West Indies and Africa. Their partnership continued until 1793. Willing himself owned slaves, three in 1779, but none in 1782.

He was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society in 1768. According to Pennsylvania tax records, Willing owned three enslaved people in 1769, but none as of 1782.

===Political career===
A member of the common council in 1755, he became an alderman in 1759, associate justice of the city court on October 2, 1759, and then justice of the court of common pleas February 28, 1761. Willing then became Mayor of Philadelphia in 1763. In 1767, the Pennsylvania Assembly, with Governor Thomas Penn&#x27;s assent, had authorized a Supreme Court justice (always a lawyer) to sit with local justices of the peace (judges of county courts, but laymen) in a system of &quot;Nisi Prius&quot; courts. Governor Penn appointed two new Supreme Court justices, John Lawrence and Thomas Willing. Willing served until 1767, the last under the colonial government.

A member of the Committee of Correspondence in 1774 and of the Committee of Safety in 1775, he served in the Continental Congress. In 1775 and 1776 he voted against the Declaration of Independence, but later subscribed £5,000 to supply the revolutionary cause. 

===Banker===
From 1781 to 1791, Willing served as president of the Bank of North America, preceding John Nixon. In 1791, President George Washington appointed Willing along with two others as commissioners of the newly created First Bank of the United States. He was elected president of the bank later that year, and during his tenure, he became the richest man in America. In August 1807, Willing suffered a slight stroke, and within a few months, he resigned his position with the bank for health reasons.

==Personal life==
In 1763, Willing married Anne McCall (1745–1781), daughter of Samuel McCall (1721–1762) and Anne Searle (1724–1757). Together, they had thirteen children, including:
* Anne Willing (1764–1801), who married William Bingham (1752–1804)
* Thomas Mayne Willing (1767–1822), who married Jane Nixon (1775–1823)
* Elizabeth Willing (1768–1858), who married William Jackson (1759–1828)
* Mary Willing (1770–1852), who married Henry Clymer (1767–1830)
* Dorothy Willing (1772–1842), who married Thomas Willing Francis, a cousin
* George Willing (1774–1827), who married Rebecca Harrison Blackwell (1782–1852)
* Richard Willing (1775–1858), who married Eliza Moore (1786–1823)
* Abigail Willing (1777–1841), who married Richard Peters (1780–1848).

Willing died in 1821 in Philadelphia, where he is interred in Christ Church Burial Ground.

===Descendants===
Willing was the great-uncle of John Brown Francis (1791–1864), who was a governor and United States Senator from Rhode Island.

Willing was also the grandfather of Ann Louisa Bingham (b. 1782), who married Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton (1774–1848), in 1798, and Maria Matilda Bingham (1783–1849), who was briefly married to Jacques Alexandre, Comte de Tilly, a French aristocrat and later married her sister&#x27;s brother-in-law, Henry Baring (1777–1848), until their divorce in 1824. Maria later married the Marquis de Blaisel in 1826. Their brother, and Willing&#x27;s grandson, William Bingham (1800–1852) married Marie-Charlotte Chartier de Lotbiniere (1805–1866), the second of the three daughters and heiresses of Michel-Eustache-Gaspard-Alain Chartier de Lotbinière by his second wife Mary, daughter of Captain John Munro, in 1822.

<text>USS &quot;Kilty&quot; (DD–137) was a &quot;Wickes&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy. She was the first ship named for Admiral Augustus Kilty.

&quot;Kilty&quot; was launched 25 April 1918 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California; sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Harrison Shapley; and commissioned 17 December 1918.

==Service history==
After a Caribbean shakedown and a European cruise during the summer of 1919, &quot;Kilty&quot; returned to San Diego and operated there until she decommissioned 5 June 1922.

===World War II===
&quot;Kilty&quot; recommissioned 18 December 1939, and in April 1940 sailed on Neutrality Patrol out of San Diego. During the summer, she conducted reserve training cruises and resumed her patrols early in September. The destroyer continued these operations until the United States entered World War II. Then, &quot;Kilty&quot; intensified ASW patrols, trained armed-guard crews for merchantmen, and escorted coastal convoys throughout 1942.

Reclassified APD-15 on 2 January 1943, &quot;Kilty&quot; cleared Mare Island 2 March for the South Pacific. After arriving Noumea 8 April with a Marine Raiders battalion, the transport steamed toward Guadalcanal as an ASW screen 28 April. She made similar cruises until June when she reported for patrol and escort duty in the Solomons. &quot;Kilty&quot; played a vital role in the conquest of the Solomons, landing troops of the 37th Division on New Georgia Island 30 June and 4 July. Continuing operations in the area, she made three reinforcement runs up the &quot;Slot&quot; during July and landed troops on Vella Lavella Island 15 August.

As Allied operations built up momentum, &quot;Kilty&quot; moved on to the Treasury Islands Campaign. She successfully landed New Zealand troops on Stirling Island 27 October and a Marine force on Bougainville 9 days later, enabling Allied Forces to bypass Rabaul. &quot;Kilty&quot; effectively aided this campaign in three more landings before sailing for Brisbane 21 November.

Returning Milne Bay in mid-December, the transport began preparing for the assault on the Bismarck Archipelago. &quot;Kilty&quot; landed units of the 7th Marine Regiment for the initial attack on Cape Gloucester, New Britain 26 December. Following two more landings there, she sent troops ashore at Saidor 2 January 1944 to take an air strip which would help the Air Force patrol and support Cape Gloucester. &quot;Kilty&quot;″s next objective was Green Island, where she landed troops on 15 and 20 February before returning to Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons.

Following an unopposed assault on Emirau Island 20 March, the transport prepared for the Hollandia campaign. Completing landings at Aitape 22 April, &quot;Kilty&quot; then participated in New Guinea landings, including Wakde 17 May and Biak 10 days later before putting into Humboldt Bay 28 May.

After a minor overhaul at Milne Bay, she landed troops on Cape Sansopor 30 July before sailing to Sydney. Returning to Humboldt Bay 30 August, &quot;Kilty&quot; landed troops on Morotai 15 September to complete her operations in New Guinea area. &quot;Kilty&quot; departed Hollandia 12 October as part of the spearhead for the giant Leyte assault that bore down on the enemy like a typhoon. In the advance assault force she landed rangers on Dinagat in the entrance to Leyte Gulf 17 October to pave the way for the main Philippine invasion. While &quot;Kilty&quot; was returning to Hollandia 23 October, the U.S. Fleet was crushing the Japanese Navy in the famous battle for Leyte Gulf.

During another cruise to Leyte in mid-November, the transport splashed two Aichi D3A &quot;Vals&quot; before they could crash into American LSTs. Continuing operations in the strategic Philippines, &quot;Kilty&quot; landed troops 15 December in the invasion of Mindoro, and on 11 January 1945 supported the Luzon landings. She made additional landings at Nasugbu 31 January and at Corregidor in mid-February before sailing for Ulithi 25 February for overhaul.

Battle-proven &quot;Kilty&quot; cleared Ulithi 2 April as escort to four escort carriers ferrying planes to the Okinawa beachhead. During May she made another escort cruise from Saipan to Okinawa, and on the 4th rescued survivors from sunk during a &quot;kamikaze&quot; attack. With the Okinawa campaign well under way, &quot;Kilty&quot; departed Guam 17 May and arrived San Diego 18 June for overhaul. Redesignated DD-137 on 20 July 1945, &quot;Kilty&quot; was still in the yard as the war came to an end. The veteran destroyer decommissioned 2 November 1945, and was sold 26 August 1946 to the National Metal &amp; Steel Corporation for scrapping.

==Awards==
&quot;Kilty&quot; received ten battle stars for World War II service.

As of 2009, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

<doc id="1078310" wikidata="Q269979" url="?curid=1078310" title="Sixth Dynasty of Egypt">
<text>The Sixth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (notated Dynasty VI), along with the Third, Fourth and Fifth Dynasty, constitutes the Old Kingdom of Dynastic Egypt.

== History ==
The Sixth Dynasty is considered by many authorities as the last dynasty of the Old Kingdom, although &quot;The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt&quot; includes Dynasties VII and VIII as part of the Old Kingdom. Manetho writes that these kings ruled from Memphis, since their pyramids were built at Saqqara, very close one to another.

By the Fifth Dynasty, the religious institution had established itself as the dominant force in society; a trend of growth in the bureaucracy and the priesthood, and a decline in the pharaoh&#x27;s power had been established during Neferirkare Kakai&#x27;s reign. During Djedkare Isesi&#x27;s rule, officials were endowed with greater authority—evidenced by the opulent private tombs they constructed—eventually leading to the creation of a feudal system in effect. These established trends—decentralization of authority, coupled with growth in bureaucracy—intensified during the three decades of Unas&#x27;s rule, which also witnessed economic decline. This continued on into Sixth Dynasty, leading into the First Intermediate Period.

== Pharaohs ==
Known pharaohs of the Sixth Dynasty are listed in the table below. Manetho accords the dynasty 203 regnal years from Teti to Nitocris, while the Turin Canon assigns 181 regnal years, but with three additional kings concluding with Aba – discounting the reigns of the added Eighth Dynasty kings, this is reduced to 155 regnal years. This estimate varies between both scholar and source.

=== Teti ===

Teti is identified as the first king of the Sixth Dynasty by Manetho, after the conclusion of the reign of Unas. He acceded to the throne in the 23rd century BC.

Teti is assigned a regnal duration of 30 or 33 years by Manetho — improbably long as the celebration of a Sed festival is not attested to, and the latest date recorded corresponds to the sixth cattle count, 12 or 13 years into his reign. The Royal Canon of Turin (RTC) gives another unlikely estimate of seven months. The archaeologist Hartwig Altenmüller mediates between Manetho and the record of the cattle count to offer a reign length of around 23 years. The Egyptologists Peter Clayton and William Smith accord 12 years to his reign.

The relationship between Teti and his predecessors remains unclear, but his wife Iput is thought to be a daughter of Unas. This would mean that Teti ascended to the throne as Unas&#x27;s son-in-law. His inauguration solved a potential succession crisis, Unas having died without a male heir. Teti adopted the Horus name Seheteptawy (meaning &quot;He who pacifies the Two Lands&quot;) to establish his reign as one of renewed political unity. The transition appears to have occurred smoothly, and Teti retained officials from his predecessors of the Fifth Dynasty, such as viziers Mehu and Kagemni who had begun their careers under Djedkare Isesi. Despite this, the RTC too inserts a break between Unas and Teti, which the Egyptologist Jaromìr Malek contends relates to a &quot;change of location of the capital and royal residence&quot;. The capital migrated from &quot;White Wall&quot; to the populous suburbs further south to &quot;Djed-isut&quot;—derived from the name of Teti&#x27;s pyramid and pyramid town, and located east of the monument. The royal residence might have been yet further south, in the valley away and across a lake from the city, east of South Saqqara—where the pyramids of Djedkare Isesi and Pepi I were built.

Teti had his daughter, Sesheshet, married to one of his viziers and later chief priest, Mereruka, a clear sign of his interest in co-operating with the noble class. Mereruka was buried close to Teti&#x27;s pyramid, in a lavish tomb in North Saqqara. As part of his policy of pacification, Teti issued a decree exempting the temple at Abydos from taxation. He was the first ruler to be closely associated with the cult of Hathor at Dendera. Abroad, Teti maintained trade relations with Byblos and Nubia.

Teti commissioned the construction of a pyramid at North Saqqara. His pyramid follows the standard set by Djedkare Isesi, with a base length of converging to the apex at ~53° attaining a peak height of . The substructure of the pyramid was very similar to Unas&#x27;s and Djedkare Isesi&#x27;s; it had a descending corridor and horizontal passage guarded at about the middle by three granite portcullises, leading to an antechamber flanked to its east by the &quot;serdab&quot; with its three recesses and to its west by the burial chamber containing the sarcophagus. The walls of the chambers and a section of the horizontal passage were inscribed with Pyramid Texts, as in Unas&#x27; pyramid. The mortuary temple, with the exception of its entrance, conforms to the same basic plans as his predecessors. The complex contained a cult pyramid to the south-east of the pyramid with base length . The causeway connecting to the mortuary temple is yet to be excavated, while the valley temple and pyramid town are entirely missing. Teti&#x27;s pyramid became the site of a large necropolis, and included the pyramids of his wives Neith and Iput, mother of Pepi I. Iput&#x27;s skeleton was discovered buried in her pyramid in a wooden coffin.

Manetho claims that Teti was assassinated by a bodyguard, but no contemporary sources confirm this. The story, if true, might explain the references to the ephemeral ruler Userkare, proposed to have briefly reigned between Teti and Pepi I. Userkare is attested to in the Royal Turin Canon and Abydos king-list, and is mentioned in several contemporaneous documents.

=== Pepi I ===
During this dynasty, expeditions were sent to Wadi Maghara in the Sinai Peninsula to mine for turquoise and copper, as well as to the mines at Hatnub and Wadi Hammamat. The pharaoh Djedkara sent trade expeditions south to Punt and north to Byblos, and Pepi I sent expeditions not only to these locations, but also as far as Ebla in modern-day Syria.

=== Pepi II ===
The most notable member of this dynasty was Pepi II, who is credited with a reign of 94 years.

=== Nitiqret ===
Also known by the Greek name Nitocris, this woman is believed by some authorities to have been not only the first female pharaoh but the first queen in the world, although it is currently accepted that her name is actually a mistranslation of the king Neitiqerty Siptah.
== The rise of the nobility ==
With the growing number of biographical inscriptions in non-royal tombs, academic knowledge of the contemporary history in Egypt broadened. There is modern veracity to records of an unsuccessful plot against Pepi I, and a letter written by the young king Pepi II, excited that one of his expeditions will return with a dancing pygmy from the land of Yam, located to the south of Nubia.

These non-royal tomb inscriptions are but one example of the growing power of the nobility, which further weakened the absolute rule of the king. As a result, it is believed that on the death of the long-lived Pepi II his vassals were entrenched enough to resist the authority of his many successors, which may have contributed to the rapid decline of the Old Kingdom.

<text>The Girsberg Tunnel is a motorway tunnel in Switzerland. The tunnel lies in the northeastern part of the canton of Thurgau, and forms part of the A7 motorway from Winterthur to Kreuzlingen and the border to Germany. The tunnel was completed in 2002, and is in length.

The tunnel essentially winds its way down a hill in a clockwise direction (heading into Kreuzlingen). Despite all this winding, there is no actual difficulty in driving through the tunnel. The eastern end of the tunnel is less than half a kilometre away from the terminus of the toll portion of the A7 motorway, which takes the form of a rarely seen motorway roundabout.

<doc id="1078340" wikidata="Q347368" url="?curid=1078340" title="Immortal Technique">
<text>Felipe Andres Coronel (born February 19, 1978), better known by the stage name Immortal Technique, is an American rapper and activist. His lyrics are largely commentary on issues such as politics, religion, institutional racism, and government conspiracies.

Immortal Technique seeks to retain control over his production, and has stated in his music that record companies, not artists themselves, profit the most from mass production and marketing of music. He claimed in an interview to have sold close to a combined total of 200,000 copies of his first three official releases.

==Early life==
Coronel was born in a military hospital in Lima. He is of mostly Amerindian descent, and also has Spanish, French and African ancestry. His family immigrated to Harlem, New York, in 1980 to escape the Peruvian Civil War. During his teenage years, he was arrested multiple times due in part to what he has said was &quot;selfish and childish&quot; behavior. He attended Hunter College High School on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where his classmates included Chris Hayes and Lin-Manuel Miranda, whom he bullied, although the two later became friends. Shortly after enrolling in Pennsylvania State University, he was arrested and charged with assault-related offenses due to his involvement in an altercation between fellow students; the charges stemming from this incident led to him being incarcerated for a year.

After being paroled, he took political science classes at Baruch College in New York City for two semesters at the behest of his father, who allowed Coronel to live with him on the condition that he went to school. Honing his rapping skills in jail, and unable to find decent wage-paying employment after his release, he began selling his music on the streets of New York and battling with other MCs. This, coupled with his victories in numerous freestyle rap competitions of the New York underground hip hop scene such as Rocksteady Anniversary and Braggin Rites, led to his reputation as a ferocious Battle MC.

==Musical career==
===2000–2005: &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 2&quot;===
In 2001, Immortal Technique released his first album &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 1&quot; without the help of a record label or distribution, instead using money earned from his rap battle triumphs. He also battled but lost to Posta Boy in 106 &amp; Park&#x27;s Freestyle Friday. &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 1&quot; also contained the underground classic &quot;Dance with the Devil&quot;. In November 2002, he was listed by &quot;The Source&quot; in its &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; column, highlighting artists that are not signed to a record label. The following year, in September 2003, he received the coveted &quot;Hip Hop Quotable&quot; in &quot;The Source&quot; for a song entitled &quot;Industrial Revolution&quot; from his second album. Immortal Technique is the only rapper in history to have a &quot;Hip Hop Quotable&quot; while being unsigned. He released his second album &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 2&quot; in 2003, which featured an intro and a spoken-word piece by death row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. In 2004 and 2005, Viper Records and Babygrande Records, respectively, re-released Immortal Technique&#x27;s debut, &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 1&quot;, to make it available to a wider audience. &quot;Point of No Return&quot; from &quot;Revolutionary Vol 2&quot; was used as the entrance theme for Rashad Evans during the UFC 88 Main Event between Chuck Liddell and Rashad Evans.

===2005–present: &quot;The 3rd World&quot;, &quot;The Martyr&quot; and &quot;The Middle Passage&quot;===

Between 2005 and 2007 Immortal Technique began working on &quot;The Middle Passage&quot; and &quot;The 3rd World&quot;, the two albums that would serve a follow-up to &quot;Revolutionary Vol. 2&quot;. &quot;The 3rd World&quot;, produced by DJ Green Lantern, was released in 2008. Emilee Woods, writing for &quot;RapReviews.com&quot;, reviewed the album positively, praising its &quot;earnestly and skillfully delivered&quot; material, and claiming that Technique had &quot;finally found a comfort zone in the balance between lyricism and message.&quot;

He was also featured on several movie soundtracks and video game soundtracks, all the while touring relentlessly. In October 2011, Immortal Technique released &quot;The Martyr&quot;, a free compilation album of previously unreleased material and new tracks.
In an interview in 2020 with Latino USA, Immortal Technique discussed that he was working on writing a book. He also mentioned that he was in the process of creating a new album, but had faced setbacks because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Collaborations===

The summer of 2005 saw the release of &quot;Bin Laden&quot;, a vinyl single 12&quot; featuring Mos Def and DJ Green Lantern. The single also contained a remix of the song featured Chuck D of Public Enemy and KRS-One. In early 2006, the song &quot;Impeach the President&quot;, featuring Dead Prez and Saigon turned up in the mixtape &quot;Alive on Arrival&quot; DJ Green Lantern. This is a simple version of The Honeydrippers, 1973, in which Immortal Technique urged fans to organize a vote of censure against George W. Bush. In April 2009, a new song leaked on the internet named &quot;Democratie Fasciste (Article 4)&quot; by Brazilian-French rapper Rockin&#x27; Squat which featured Immortal Technique. The official release of the song and Rockin&#x27; Squat&#x27;s album &quot;Confessions D&#x27;un Enfant Du Siècle Volume 2&quot; was on May 12, 2009. The instrumental from the song was sampled from Wendy Rene&#x27;s &quot;After Laughter&quot;. The song expresses the inequalities of the Third World and revolutionary events throughout history against tyranny and oppression.

The song contains lyrics in English (Immortal Technique), French (Rockin&#x27; Squat) and brief shout outs in Spanish (Immortal Technique). This song is Immortal Technique&#x27;s first official international collaboration. In early 2009, it was announced that there would be a collaboration between Technique and UK underground artist Lowkey, on a single called &quot;Voices of the Voiceless&quot;. On September 11, 2009, a &quot;snippet&quot; of the song was released on YouTube. The preview was released ahead of its September 21 launch on iTunes, as part of a web-campaign that included updates, promotion and links on forums, E-Magazines and several social networking sites. The song&#x27;s lyrics cover a broad range of issues that are familiar to listeners of both artists – racism, world revolution, war, socialism, government control, rape, famine, colonialism, Classism, self-determination and the war in Iraq.

==Activism==

Immortal Technique visits prisons to speak to youth and working with immigrant-rights activists, and raising money for children&#x27;s hospitals overseas. He created a writing grant program for high-school students as well.

In June 2008, Immortal Technique partnered with &quot;Omeid International&quot;, a non-profit human rights organization, and dubbed the work as &quot;The Green Light Project&quot;. With the profits of the album &quot;The 3rd World&quot;, he traveled to Kabul, Afghanistan to help Omeid build an orphanage, the Amin Institute, without corporate or external funding.

==Other work==
===Films===
Immortal Technique featured in Ice-T&#x27;s documentary &quot;Something from Nothing: The Art of Rap&quot;.

A documentary about Immortal Technique was released in September 2011 and premiered at the Harlem Film Festival. It was released on DVD on July 10, 2012.

====&quot;This Revolution&quot;====
Immortal Technique appeared as himself in a docudrama film entitled &quot;This Revolution&quot;, which was recorded during the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York. The tape contains the protests surrounding the convention in the form of a documentary. It also featured Viper Records affiliates Akir and producer SouthPaw in roles.

Since then, Immortal Technique has taken control of Viper Records and has signed a distribution deal with Babygrande Records / E1 Entertainment to vent to their next album. SouthPaw has managed to establish himself as A&amp;R of Viper Records.

<doc id="1078341" wikidata="Q2997110" url="?curid=1078341" title="Alleluia">
<text>Alleluia ( ; ) is a phrase in Christianity used to give praise to God. In Christian worship, Alleluia is used as a liturgical chant in which that word is combined with verses of scripture, usually from the Psalms. This chant is commonly used before the proclamation of the Gospel. In Western Christianity, congregations commonly cease using the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; during the period of Lent but restore it into their services at Easter. The form of praise &quot;Alleluia&quot; is used by Christians to thank and glorify God; it finds itself present in many prayers and hymns, especially those related to Eastertide, such as &quot;Christ the Lord is Risen Today&quot;.

==History==
The Hebrew word &quot;Hallelujah&quot; as an expression of praise to God was preserved, untranslated, by the Early Christians as a superlative expression of thanksgiving, joy, and triumph. Thus it appears in the ancient Greek Liturgy of St. James, which is still used to this day by the Patriarch of Jerusalem and, in its Syriac recension is the prototype of that used by the Maronites. In the Liturgy of St. Mark, we find this rubric: &quot;Then follow &quot;let us attend&quot;, the Apostle, and the Prologue of the Alleluia.&quot; The &quot;Apostle&quot; is the usual ancient Eastern title for the Epistle reading, and the &quot;Prologue of the Alleluia&quot; would seem to be a prayer or verse before Alleluia was sung by the choir. It has been suggested that the acclamation arises from and is an onomatopoeic rendition of the ancient tradition of ululation.

==Eastern uses==
===Byzantine Rite===

In the Eastern Orthodox, as well as Byzantine Rite Eastern Catholic and Eastern Lutheran Churches, after reading the Apostle (Epistle) at the Divine Liturgy, the Reader announces which of the Eight Tones the Alleluia is to be chanted in. The response of the choir is always the same: &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot; What differs is the tone in which it is sung, and the stichera (psalm verses) which are intoned by the Reader.

The Alleluia is paired with the Prokeimenon which preceded the reading of the Apostle. There may be either one or two Alleluias, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (there may be up to three readings from the Apostle, but never be more than two Prokeimena and Alleluia).

In the Russian/Slavic order, the Alleluia is intoned in one of the two following manners, depending upon the number of Prokeimena (The Antiochian/Byzantine practice is slightly different):

====One Alleluia====
:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Let us attend.&quot;
:&quot;Reader:&quot; &quot;Alleluia in the ____ Tone.&quot;
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:The Reader then chants the first sticheron of the Alleluia.
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the Alleluia.
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;

====Two Alleluias====
:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Let us attend.&quot;
:&quot;Reader:&quot; &quot;Alleluia in the ____ Tone:&quot; Then he immediately chants the first sticheron of the first Alleluia.
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:The Reader then chants the second sticheron of the first Alleluia.
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Reader:&quot; &quot;In the ____ Tone:&quot; And he chants the first sticheron of the second Alleluia.
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;

====Lenten Alleluia====
Among the Orthodox, the chanting of Alleluia does not cease during Lent, as it does in the West. This is in accordance with the Orthodox approach to fasting, which is one of sober joy. During the weekdays of Great Lent and certain days during the lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles&#x27; Fast, and Dormition Fast), the celebration of the Divine Liturgy on weekdays is not permitted. Instead, Alleluia is chanted at Matins. Since this chanting of Alleluia at Matins is characteristic of Lenten services, Lenten days are referred to as &quot;Days with Alleluia.&quot;

The Alleluia at Matins is not related to scripture readings or Prokeimena; instead, it replaces &quot;God is the Lord...&quot; It is sung in the Tone of the Week and is followed by the Hymns to the Trinity (&quot;Triadica&quot;) in the same tone (see Octoechos for an explanation of the eight-week cycle of tones).

&quot;God is the Lord...&quot; would normally be intoned by the deacon, but since the deacon does not serve on days with Alleluia, it is intoned by the priest. He stands in front of the icon of Christ on the Iconostasis, and says:

:&quot;Priest:&quot; &quot;Alleluia in the ____ Tone: Out of the night my spirit waketh at dawn unto Thee, O God, for Thy commandments are a light upon the earth.&quot;
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Priest:&quot; &quot;Learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.&quot;
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Priest:&quot; &quot;Zeal shall lay hold upon an uninstructed people.&quot;
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Priest:&quot; &quot;Add more evils upon them, O Lord, lay more evils upon them that are glorious upon the earth.&quot;
:&quot;Choir:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.&quot;

====Alleluia for the departed====
Alleluia is also chanted to a special melody at funerals, memorial services (Greek: &quot;Parastas&quot;, Slavonic: &quot;Panikhida&quot;), and on Saturdays of the Dead. Again, it is chanted in place of &quot;God is the Lord...&quot;, but this time is followed by the Troparia of the Departed.

The Alleluia is intoned by the deacon (or the priest, if no deacon is available):

:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, in the 8th tone: Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord.&quot;
:&quot;Choir&quot;: &quot;Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Their memory is from generation to generation.&quot;
:&quot;Choir&quot;: &quot;Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Their souls will dwell amid good things.&quot;
:&quot;Choir&quot;: &quot;Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.&quot;

On Saturdays of the Dead, which are celebrated several times throughout the year, the prokeimenon at Vespers is also replaced with Alleluia, which is chanted in the following manner:

:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Alleluia, in the 8th tone.
:&quot;Choir&quot;: &quot;Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Blessed are they whom Thou hast chosen and taken unto Thyself, O Lord.&quot;
:&quot;Choir&quot;: &quot;Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.&quot;
:&quot;Deacon:&quot; &quot;Their memory is from generation to generation.&quot;
:&quot;Choir&quot;: &quot;Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.&quot;

====Other uses====
Gospel readings are appointed for other services as well, particularly those in the Trebnik. A number of these are preceded by an Alleluia, in the same manner as that chanted at the Divine Liturgy, though sometimes there are no stichera (psalm verses).

During the sacred mystery (Sacrament) of baptism, in addition to the Alleluia before the Gospel, the choir also chants an Alleluia while the priest pours the Oil of Catechumens into the baptismal font.

==Western use==
===Roman Rite===

In the Roman Rite the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; is associated with joy and is especially favoured in Paschal time, the time between Easter and Pentecost, perhaps because of the association of the &quot;hallel&quot; (Alleluia psalms) chanted at Passover. During this time, the word is added widely to verses and responses associated with prayers, to antiphons of psalms, and, during the Octave of Easter and on Pentecost Sunday, to the dismissal at the end of Mass (&quot;Ite missa est&quot;).

On the other hand, the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; is excluded from the Roman liturgy during Lent, often euphemistically referred to during this time as the &quot;A-word&quot;. In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite it is excluded also in the pre-Lenten Septuagesima period and in Masses for the Dead. The same word, which normally follows the &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; at the beginning of each hour of the Liturgy of the Hours and which in the present ordinary form of the Roman Rite is omitted during Lent, is replaced in pre-1970 forms by the phrase &quot;Laus tibi, Domine, rex aeternae gloriae&quot; (Praise to thee, O Lord, king of eternal glory) in Lent and the Septuagesima period.

The term &quot;Alleluia&quot; is used also to designate a chant beginning and ending with this word and including a verse of scripture, in particular a chant to greet and welcome the Lord whose word will be proclaimed in the Gospel reading. The choir or a cantor sings &quot;Alleluia&quot;. The congregation repeats this. The choir or cantor then sings a verse taken from the Mass Lectionary or the &quot;Roman Gradual&quot;, after which the congregation again sings &quot;Alleluia&quot;. In Lent the verse alone is sung or the word &quot;Alleluia&quot; is replaced by a different acclamation taken from the &quot;Gradual&quot;, or a tract is sung. If singing is not used, the Alleluia and its verse may be omitted at any season.

The complex plainchant setting in the &quot;Roman Gradual&quot; requires a high degree of skill and is mostly used only in monasteries and seminaries. This melismatic Gregorian chant opens with the cantor singing &quot;Alleluia&quot;. The choir repeats it, adding to the final syllable a long melisma called a jubilus. (The &quot;Liber Usualis&quot; notates the repeat with the Roman numeral &quot;ij&quot; (2) and continues with the jubilus.) The cantor then sings the main part of the verse, and the choir joins in on the final line. The cantor then repeats the opening Alleluia, and the choir repeats only the jubilus. The music is generally ornate, but often within a narrow range. The Alleluia for Christmas Eve, for instance, has an ambitus of only a perfect fifth, a rather extreme example.

Alleluias were frequently troped, both with added music and text. It is believed that some early Sequences derived from syllabic text being added to the jubilus, and may be named after the opening words of the Alleluia verse. Alleluias were also among the more frequently used chants to create early organa, such as in the Winchester Troper.

The Alleluia and its verse is replaced during Lent and in the pre-1970 form of the Roman Rite Mass also during Septuagesima time by a Tract. On the other hand, during Eastertide the Gradual is replaced with an Alleluia chant, thus putting two such chants before the Gospel reading.

<text>James Lovell (October 31, 1737 – July 14, 1814) was an educator and statesman from Boston, Massachusetts. He was a delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1782. He was a signatory to the Articles of Confederation.

==Early life==

Lovell was born in Boston and had his preparatory education at the Boston Latin School. His father John Lovell (1710–1778) was the school&#x27;s headmaster from 1738 until 1775. James attended Harvard and graduated in 1756. He then joined his father and taught at the Latin School, while continuing his own studies. He received a Master of Arts degree from Harvard in 1759. Father and son continued their work in the Latin School until it was closed in April 1775, during the Siege of Boston in the American Revolutionary War.

While the school produced a number of revolutionary leaders, including John Hancock and Samuel Adams, the approaching revolution split father and son. John Lovell wrote and endorsed Loyalist or Tory positions, while James became aligned with the Whigs and associated growing rebel sentiment. He was chosen to give an to the town the first year after the Boston Massacre, which he delivered at the Old South Church Following the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, the new military Governor William Howe, ordered the arrest of likely dissidents in Boston. James Lovell was picked up in the sweep and spent nine months in the Boston Stone Jail.

General Howe evacuated Boston in March 1776, taking all British troops and Loyalists. James was transported with the British fleet as a prisoner and taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he spent nine months in the jail. His father also sailed with the British fleet to Halifax in March 1776, as part of the general exodus of Loyalists when British forces abandoned the city. In November 1776, James was exchanged for Colonel Philip Skene. When he got back to Boston in December, he was elected to be a delegate to the Continental Congress, to which he served until 1782.

==Congressional career==
Lovell served effectively in the Congress during the six years that were critical to the American Revolution. He was particularly important as a long-term member of the Committee of Foreign Correspondence and that of Secret Correspondence. He signed the Articles of Confederation, endorsing them for Massachusetts on July 9, 1778. During his appointment to the Committee for Foreign Affairs, he created and implemented ciphers for the country. The ciphers he created were somewhat difficult and complex to use as described and referenced by John Adams &quot;I have letters from the president and from Lovell, the last unintelligible, in ciphers, but inexplicable by his own cipher.&quot; and Benjamin Franklin &quot;If you can find the key &amp; decypher it, I shall be glad, having myself try&#x27;d in vain.&quot; as expressed in their letters to Francis Dana of March 1781.

In one area his performance was controversial. In 1776 and 1777, there was a growing struggle for influence and command in the Continental Army. Lovell became a supporter of Horatio Gates in his lobbying quest for command. He encouraged Gates in reporting directly to Congress, in effect going over General Washington&#x27;s head. This reached its peak when Gates was given command of the Northern Department, replacing Philip Schuyler in the summer of 1777. The controversy also extended into his family along political lines as he was a fervent Whig as opposed to his father who was a Loyalist.

Lovell was also a frequent correspondent with both John and Abigail Adams. In his correspondence to Abigail, he flirted wondering what John was doing with his private time in France. He also used Abigail&#x27;s pet name of Portia in his correspondence.

==Later events ==
After his term in Congress, Lovell returned to teaching but continued to hold various political offices. He was collector of taxes in Massachusetts from 1784 to 1788 and Customs Officer of Boston in 1778 and 1789. He was appointed as a naval officer of the port of Boston and Charlestown from 1789 and held that position until his death. He died in Windham, Maine (then part of Massachusetts) on July 14, 1814.

==Family ==
His son, James Lovell (1758–1850) served in the Continental Army from 1776 to 1782. After graduating from Harvard in 1776, he joined the 16th Massachusetts regiment as a lieutenant and saw action at Battle of Monmouth and in Rhode Island. In 1779, he was assigned as adjutant and major to Light Horse Harry Lee&#x27;s Southern Legion and fought in the southern campaigns. He is reported to have fought valiantly and was wounded several times.

Lovell&#x27;s grandson was Joseph Lovell, who served as the first Surgeon General of the Army from 1818 until 1836.

<text>Christopher Boyd Lemmon (born June 22, 1954) is an American actor and author.

==Early life and education==
Lemmon was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of actress Cynthia Stone and actor Jack Lemmon. Lemmon attended the Verde Valley School in Sedona, Arizona. With a talent for music, he was encouraged by his father to study piano. Lemmon considered playing piano professionally after having graduated from the California Institute of the Arts, with degrees in classical piano and composition, and in theater.

==Career==
He appeared as an actor in numerous stage productions, including the west-coast tour of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;, directed by Jerry Paris, the original West coast production of &quot;Shay&quot; by Anne Commire, and A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot; with Stephanie Zimbalist. He portrayed Richard Phillips in two situation comedies, &quot;Duet&quot; (1987) and &quot;Open House&quot; (1989), and also co-starred as Martin &quot;Bru&quot; Brubaker in the television series &quot;Thunder in Paradise&quot; alongside American professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Lemmon is also a screenwriter and producer. Algonquin Books published Lemmon&#x27;s tribute to his father, titled &quot;A Twist of Lemmon&quot; (2006), which was re-released in 2008 as a paperback by Applause Theatre and Cinema Books.

He appeared in three films with his father: &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977),&quot; That&#x27;s Life!&quot; (1986), and &quot;Dad&quot; (1989).

Lemmon adapted his tribute to his father, &quot;A Twist of Lemmon&quot; to the stage in 2015. The show, which Lemmon has performed all around the United States, follows the relationship between Lemmon and his father as seen through his father&#x27;s eyes.

<text>The Milchbuck Tunnel is a motor road tunnel in Switzerland, and forms part of the A1L motorway from Zürich Schwamendingen to Zürich Letten, where the tunnel&#x27;s southern portal lies on Wasserwerkstrasse, which leads into central Zürich. Constructed in 1978, the tunnel is in length.

A proposed second tunnel bore (to create two separate tunnels for two directions of traffic) was turned down. Now, only one lane handles traffic into downtown Zurich, one lane handles traffic leaving the city, with an emergency lane in the middle. By 2006, the emergency services in the tunnel have been upgraded, with the escape path being added. At the northern portal in the direction to the city, the entrance to the Irchel underground car park is to the left of the lane.

At about the midpoint of the Milchbuck tunnel, the Weinberg rail tunnel passes beneath it.

<doc id="1078359" wikidata="Q1539893" url="?curid=1078359" title="Pharmacophore">
<text>In medicinal chemistry and molecular biology, a pharmacophore is an abstract description of molecular features that are necessary for molecular recognition of a ligand by a biological macromolecule. IUPAC defines a pharmacophore to be &quot;an ensemble of steric and electronic features that is necessary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions with a specific biological target and to trigger (or block) its biological response&quot;. A pharmacophore model explains how structurally diverse ligands can bind to a common receptor site. Furthermore, pharmacophore models can be used to identify through de novo design or virtual screening novel ligands that will bind to the same receptor.

== Features ==
Typical pharmacophore features include hydrophobic centroids, aromatic rings, hydrogen bond acceptors or donors, cations, and anions. These pharmacophore points may be located on the ligand itself or may be projected points presumed to be located in the receptor.

The features need to match different chemical groups with similar properties, in order to identify novel ligands. Ligand-receptor interactions are typically &quot;polar positive&quot;, &quot;polar negative&quot; or &quot;hydrophobic&quot;. A well-defined pharmacophore model includes both hydrophobic volumes and hydrogen bond vectors. 

== Model development ==

The process for developing a pharmacophore model generally involves the following steps:

# Select a training set of ligands – Choose a structurally diverse set of molecules that will be used for developing the pharmacophore model. As a pharmacophore model should be able to discriminate between molecules with and without bioactivity, the set of molecules should include both active and inactive compounds.
# Conformational analysis – Generate a set of low energy conformations that is likely to contain the bioactive conformation for each of the selected molecules.
#Molecular superimposition – Superimpose (&quot;fit&quot;) all combinations of the low-energy conformations of the molecules. Similar (bioisosteric) functional groups common to all molecules in the set might be fitted (&quot;e.g.&quot;, phenyl rings or carboxylic acid groups). The set of conformations (one conformation from each active molecule) that results in the best fit is presumed to be the active conformation.
#Abstraction – Transform the superimposed molecules into an abstract representation. For example, superimposed phenyl rings might be referred to more conceptually as an &#x27;aromatic ring&#x27; pharmacophore element. Likewise, hydroxy groups could be designated as a &#x27;hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor&#x27; pharmacophore element.
# Validation – A pharmacophore model is a &quot;hypothesis&quot; accounting for the observed biological activities of a set of molecules that bind to a common biological target. The model is only valid insofar as it is able to account for differences in biological activity of a range of molecules.

As the biological activities of new molecules become available, the pharmacophore model can be updated to further refine it.

== Applications ==

In modern computational chemistry, pharmacophores are used to define the essential features of one or more molecules with the same biological activity. A database of diverse chemical compounds can then be searched for more molecules which share the same features arranged in the same relative orientation. Pharmacophores are also used as the starting point for developing 3D-QSAR models. Such tools and a related concept of &quot;privileged structures&quot;, which are &quot;defined as molecular frameworks which are able of providing useful ligands for more than one type of receptor or enzyme target by judicious structural modifications&quot;, aid in drug discovery.

== History ==

Historically, the modern idea of pharmacophore was popularized by Lemont Kier, who mentions the concept in 1967 and uses the term in a publication in 1971. Nevertheless, F. W. Shueler, in a 1960s book, uses the expression &quot;pharmacophoric moiety&quot; that corresponds to the modern concept. 

The development of the concept is often erroneously accredited to Paul Ehrlich. However neither the alleged source nor any of his other works mention the term &quot;pharmacophore&quot; or make use of the concept.

<text>Paços de Ferreira () is a city in the Porto District, in the north of Portugal. The population of the city in 2011 was 7491, while its municipality had 56,340 inhabitants, in an area of 70.99 km².

Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Capital do Móvel&quot; (&quot;capital of furniture&quot;), owing to the predominance of this industry within its territory, the municipality has around 5000 companies producing furniture and has the biggest exhibition and selling area (estimated in 2.5 million square meters) of furniture in Europe. It is also the location of IKEA&#x27;s industrial operations within Portugal.

Its football team, FC Paços de Ferreira, participated for three times in European Competitions (Champions League and Europa League), finished runners-up of the Portuguese cup in 2008/2009 and of the Portuguese League Cup in 2010/2011.

== History ==
The territory of the current municipality was occupied by humans since prehistory. In the parish of Sanfins de Ferreira, there is an important hillfort, the Citânia de Sanfins, that was one of the main settlements of the Celtic tribes who lived in northwest Iberian Peninsula (Gallaeci). 
In medieval times, this planaltic area had few population. The only centers of power were the monastery of Ferreira and the noble families concentrated in the parish of Frazão.

After the Portuguese Civil War, the new constitucional regime made important administrative changes, and, for the first time, granted administrative autonomy for the populations of the region, creating a municipality in 1836 and appointing the most central parish of the plateau, Santa Eulália de Paços de Ferreira, as capital.

Since then, the territory registered a remarkable development, and the population more than sextupled in 150 years.

In the beginnings of the 20th century, a local elementary school teacher, Albino de Matos, invented new tools and furniture which began to be used in schools all around the country, marking the beginning of the furniture industry in Paços de Ferreira. In the second half of the century, with the economic growth of the country, the carpenters of Paços de Ferreira started to make and sell furniture for houses, which allowed the industry to expand, becoming the most important activity of the population.

In 1993 the Portuguese parliament gave the title of city to Paços de Ferreira.

==Geography==

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 12 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;):

* Carvalhosa
* Eiriz
* Ferreira
* Figueiró
* Frazão Arreigada
* Freamunde [city]
* Meixomil
* Paços de Ferreira [city]
* Penamaior

<doc id="1078371" wikidata="Q1474813" url="?curid=1078371" title="Icelandic Coast Guard">
<text>The Icelandic Coast Guard (, or simply ) is the Icelandic defence service responsible for search and rescue, maritime safety and security surveillance, national defense, and law enforcement. The Coast Guard maintains the Iceland Air Defence System which conducts ground-based surveillance of Iceland&#x27;s air space and operate the Keflavik airbase. It is also responsible for hydrographic surveying and nautical charting.

==History==
Its origins can be traced to 1859, when the corvette &quot;Ørnen&quot; started patrolling Icelandic waters. In 1906, Iceland&#x27;s first purposely built guard-ship, &quot;Islands Falk&quot;, began operation. Iceland&#x27;s own defense of its territorial waters began around 1920 and the Icelandic Coast Guard was formally founded on 1 July 1926. The first cannon was put on the trawler &quot;Þór&quot; in 1924 and on 23 June 1926 the first ship built for the Coast Guard, named &quot;Óðinn&quot;, arrived in Iceland. Three years later, on 14 July 1929 the coastal defence ship &quot;Ægir&quot; was added to the Coast Guard fleet.

=== Cod Wars ===
The Icelandic Coast Guard played its largest role during the fishing rights dispute known as the Cod Wars, between 1972 and 1976, when the Coast Guard ships would cut the trawl wires of British and West German trawlers, resulting in confrontations with Royal Navy warships and tugs from the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF). The Icelandic Coast Guard goal was to enforce a disputed expansion of Iceland&#x27;s exclusive economic zone. Engagements between Icelandic gunboats and British warships involving ramming became the tactic of choice during this conflict. At least 15 British frigates, five Icelandic patrol boats and one British supply ship were damaged by ramming between 1975 and 1976. In the end, Iceland achieved its overall ambition of expanding its exclusive fishery zone to by June 1976.

==Operations==
The Icelandic Coast Guard&#x27;s (ICG) primary mission as stipulated in Section 1 of Act on Icelandic Coast Guard is conduct search and rescue, maritime safety and security surveillance, and law enforcement inside the -wide economic zone. The Coast Guard operates Joint Rescue and Coordination Centre (JRCC) Iceland which is responsible for search and rescue of vessels and aircraft in Iceland&#x27;s search and rescue region (SRR) according to International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR) Manual. Additionally the ICG is in the charge of defusing naval mines, most of which were laid during the Second World War, and monitoring fisheries in international waters outside of the Icelandic economic zone in order to blacklist any vessel partaking in unregulated fishing and thus bar them from receiving services from any member of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in order to make unregulated fishing unprofitable. The Icelandic Coast Guard also occasionally operates within Greenlandic and Faeroese waters, following a bilateral agreement with Denmark regarding mutual aid in security, rescue and defence matters.

The Coast Guard accomplishes these tasks with the use of offshore patrol vessels (OPV), helicopters, surveillance aircraft, satellites and a network of land based surface scanning radar.

The Icelandic Coast Guard is also in charge of the Iceland Air Defence System, which operates four ground-based AN-FPS(V)5 air surveillance radars and a control and command centre.

In the 1990s the Coast Guard started hosting exercises such as &quot;Northern Challenge&quot; which had military units from Norway, Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom, among others, participating along with the Icelandic Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has also taken part in peacekeeping operations on behalf of the Icelandic Crisis Response Unit, although while usually using their own rank insignia, uniforms and weapons.

The fleet also takes part in Frontex operations, and in that role played a major part in the rescue of over 300 Syrian refugees in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in January 2015.

==Fleet==
, the Icelandic Coast Guard fleet consists of two OPVs, one coastal hydrographic and patrol vessel and an independent fast rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), as well as numerous smaller boats assigned to the larger units. In 2011 the Coast Guard received ICGV &quot;Þór&quot;, built by the Asmar shipyard in Talcahuano, Chile.

ICGV &quot;Týr&quot;, an , the second youngest, built by Århus Flydedok a/s and launched in 1975. , lead ship of the &quot;Ægir&quot; class, is ICGV &quot;Týr&quot;″s sister ship, built by Ålborg Værft a/s and launched in 1968. Each ship is equipped with two or more RHIBs of various sizes and armed with a 40 mm Bofors cannon. Various kinds of small arms as well as other man-portable weapons are also carried on board each of the ships. &quot;Týr&quot; and &quot;Þór&quot; are also equipped with sonar systems and the &quot;Ægir&quot;-class vessels have flight decks and a hangar for a small helicopter. While the Coast Guard does not operate small enough helicopters to use the hangars, the flight decks are often used by the helicopters of the Aeronautical Division on various missions.

The coastguard has a 73-ton patrol and hydrographic survey vessel, named &quot;Baldur&quot;, built by Vélsmiðja Seyðisfjarðar shipyard in 1991. This vessel has no mounted weaponry, but it has nonetheless been used for port security and fishery inspection.

The newest ship of the fleet, , was bought in September 2021 to replace the 46-year old ICGV &quot;Týr&quot;. It arrived for retrofit at Damen Shiprepair Rotterdam in Schiedam on 11 October and was formally delivered to the Coast Guard on 1 November 2021. She departed for Siglufjordur on 2 November.

==Aeronautical division==
After World War II, the Coast Guard occasionally leased civilian aircraft for short term monitoring of shipping and fishing in the territorial waters, first in 1948 when a Grumman Goose was leased from Loftleiðir. On 10 December 1955, the Coast Guard acquired its first aircraft when a Consolidated PBY-6A Catalina flying boat was acquired from the Civil Aviation Administration. It was originally from the Iceland Defense Force but was damaged near Langanes in 1954. It was named &quot;Rán&quot; and registered as TF-RAN.

In 1972, the ICG, along with the National Life-saving Association of Iceland, bought its first specialized search and rescue helicopter, a Sikorsky S-62 that was named &quot;Gná&quot;, from the United States Coast Guard. Three years later, &quot;Gná&quot; crashed in Skálafell, with no injuries, after a shaft in the tail propeller broke.

It took five years for another SAR helicopter to arrive but in 1980, the Coast Guard bought a new Sikorsky S-76 which was given the name &quot;Rán&quot;. The helicopter performed admirably, including in March 1983, when &quot;Rán&quot;, along with a French Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma, one of two temporarily deployed in the country, rescued 11 people from &quot;Hafrún ÍS-400&quot; after it ran aground at Stigahlíð in the Westfjords. However, in November 1983, &quot;Rán&quot; crashed in Jökulfirðir in the Westfjords of Iceland during a training mission, killing its four man crew, in what remains the deadliest accident in the ICG history. The loss of &quot;Rán&quot; and some of the Coast Guard&#x27;s most experienced flight members nearly caused the shutdown of its helicopter program. After some deliberation, the decision was made in 1984 to continue the program and buy a new Aérospatiale SA 365N Dauphin II and rent another until the new one would arrive.

In 1985, the new &quot;Sif&quot; arrived and with it, several changes were made to the helicopter program, including to training, expanding crew rosters, addition of helicopter doctors and shift plans to expand its availability. &quot;Sif&quot; went on to become one of the ICG most successful aircraft to date. During its 22-year career it took part in several high profile rescue operations around Iceland and is credited to have been involved in the rescue of around 250 lives.

In 1995, the ICG received a second specialised SAR helicopter when it bought an Aérospatiale AS-332L1 Super Puma which was given the name &quot;Líf&quot;. The new helicopter continued on the success of &quot;Sif&quot; and gained national fame when it rescued 39 sailors in three separate incidents during a six-day period in March 1997.

As a response to the withdrawal of the Iceland Defense Force in 2006, the Coast Guard expanded its helicopters to four in 2007. That number was later reduced to three and as of 2022, it operates three Airbus Helicopters H225 helicopters named &quot;Gná&quot;, &quot;Gróa&quot; and &quot;Eir&quot;.

The Coast Guard also operates a single Bombardier DHC-8-Q314, registered as TF-SIF, modified for maritime surveillance and reconnaissance. This plane has been extensively modified by FIELD to carry a modern Mission Management System and suite of surveillance sensors, air operable door and communications/navigation equipment. It is occasionally also used for surveillance of volcanic eruptions, such as the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull.

==Vehicles==
All major vehicles of the Icelandic Coast Guard are named after beings from Norse mythology.

===Vessels===

===Decommissioned vessels===

In addition the Coast Guard has rented or borrowed a number of civilian vessels and aircraft for shorter periods, which are not listed.

===Aircraft===


===Retired===
Previous notable aircraft operated consisted of the Consolidated PBY Catalina, Douglas C-54, Fokker F27, Bell 47J/G, MD 500C, Sikorsky S-62, Sikorsky S-76, Eurocopter AS365, Eurocopter AS350. Three former aircraft of the Icelandic Coast Guard can be viewed and boarded at the Icelandic Aviation Museum in Akureyri, the helicopters TF-SIF and TF-LÍF, and the Fokker F-27 TF-SYN.

== Radars ==
The Iceland Air Defense System monitors Iceland&#x27;s airspace. Air Defense is provided by fighter jets from NATO allies, which rotate units for the Icelandic Air Policing mission to Keflavik Air Base.
The Iceland Air Defense System&#x27;s Control and Reporting Centre is at Keflavik Air Base and reports to NATO&#x27;s Integrated Air Defense System CAOC Uedem in Germany.

==Weaponry==
The Icelandic Coast Guard possesses over 200 firearms, with more than half of them in storage. In 2014, the Coast Guard received 250 Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 from the Norwegian Armed Forces. The acquisition of the weapons caused an uproar in Iceland due to several facts, including that the mostly unarmed Icelandic Police was to receive 150 of them and conflicting statements from Icelandic and Norwegian officials on whether they were a gift or bought.
In June 2015, the weapons were returned to Norway.

<text>Peñafiel is a town in the Valladolid Province and the greater autonomous community of Castile and León, Spain. It is best known for the Peñafiel Castle and for its medieval square used for bullfights and named &quot;Plaza del Coso&quot; (English: &quot;Bullring Square&quot;). The square is surrounded by private homes, but since medieval times the rights to use their windows, balconies and doorways during bullfights are owned by the town (see easement), which auctions them to the highest bidders.

The town is full of deep excavated caveswhich were traditionally used to store the wine because of the constant temperature they kept all year around. These caves have chimney vents for ventilation and to evacuate the gases generated by the fermentation of the wine. These chimney vents dot the landscape in and around the town and the castle.

In 2006 Peñafiel had a population of about 5,434.

Peñafiel was a very important centre in the Middle Ages, as evidenced by the fact that it had up to 19 churches.

The town witnessed a clear expansion when the Spanish Rail System reached it, and this also profited the surrounding region. Rail facilitated distribution of goods, of which wheat was the most important. Three factories were established dedicated to the production of flour. This expansion did not, however, serve to develop animal husbandry in the region.

The name of Peñafiel derives from the Latin &quot;Pinna Fidelis&quot; (the loyal Rock or Mountain). The name is not casual: the &quot;Peña&quot; served as protection through the years, as the Castle at its top attests. The castle can be seen from kilometers away, and it is a typical postcard of the town. The castle now hosts the Wine Museum of Valladolid, and offers an impressive view of the town and the surrounding region. Below the castle, but above the town, many of wine caves were built. The mountain contains tens of such caves, some of which are as large as . Many wineries are located near Peñafiel: the town is at the heart of the Wine Region of Ribera del Duero. Guided winery visits in La Ribera del Duero are a growing tourist activity.

<doc id="1078392" wikidata="Q1830038" url="?curid=1078392" title="Center for Public Integrity">
<text>The Center for Public Integrity (CPI) is an American nonprofit investigative journalism organization whose stated mission is &quot;to counter the corrosive effects of inequality by holding powerful interests accountable and equipping the public with knowledge to drive change.&quot; It won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting, and in 2023, the Edward R. Murrow Award for General Excellence.

The CPI has been described as an independent watchdog group. The Center releases its reports via its website.

==Mission==
The mission of the center is &quot;to protect democracy and inspire change using investigative reporting that exposes betrayals of the public trust by powerful interests&quot;.

==History==

===1989–2004===
CPI was founded on March 30, 1989, by Charles Lewis, a former producer for ABC News and CBS News &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. By the late 1980s Lewis observed that fewer resources—time, money and space—were being invested in investigative reporting in the United States by established news outlets and major publications.
In his book entitled &quot;935 Lies: The Future of Truth and the Decline of America&#x27;s Moral Integrity&quot; Lewis recounted how he recruited two trusted journalists, Alejandro Benes and Charles Piller—whom he had met through his television work— to serve on the board of directors of the nascent CPI. All three had grown dissatisfied with what was being done in the name of investigative journalism by established news organizations. They chose the name public integrity as a way of underlying the &quot;ultimate purpose of investigative journalism&quot; which is &quot;to hold those in power accountable and to inform the public about significant distortions of the truth.&quot; In their tenth anniversary Annual Report Piller described their first meetings in their &quot;Boardroom—the cheap seats at the Baltimore Orioles game.

In May 1990, Lewis used the money he had raised and his house as collateral to open an office in Washington, D.C. In its first year, the CPI&#x27;s budget was $200,000. In 1996, CPI launched its first website, although CPI did not begin to publish reports online until 1999.

In August 2000 the CPI published a story entitled &quot;Cheney Led Halliburton to Feast at Federal Trough: State Department Questioned Deal With Firm Linked to Russian Mob&quot;, in which the authors argued that while Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton—from 1995 to 2000—the company received &quot;$3.8 billion in federal contracts and taxpayer-insured loans&quot;.

In 2001, Global Integrity, an international project, was launched to systematically track and report on openness, accountability and the rule of law in various countries. It has since been incorporated independently.

In 2004, CPI&#x27;s &quot;The Buying of the President&quot; book was on The New York Times Best Seller list for three months.

===2005–2007===
Lewis served as CPI&#x27;s director until January 2005. As of his departure, CPI had published 14 books and more than 250 investigative reports. In 2005, CPI had a staff of 40 full-time Washington-based reporters who partnered with a network of writers and editors in more than 25 countries. Years later, Lewis said he decided to leave his position at CPI because &quot;he didn&#x27;t want it to become &#x27;an institution that was Chuck&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. Lewis&#x27; departure surprised and upset philanthropists Herb and Marion Sandler, who had partially funded the CPI&#x27;s activities.

In December 2004, CPI&#x27;s board of directors chose television journalist Roberta Baskin as Lewis&#x27;s successor. Baskin came to CPI after directing consumer investigations for ABC News&#x27;s 20/20 and serving as Washington correspondent for PBS&#x27;s &quot;NOW with Bill Moyers&quot;. Lewis wrote that &quot;most of the Center&#x27;s carefully assembled, very talented, senior staff had quit by the fall of 2005&quot;.

In September 2005, CPI announced that it had discovered a pattern of plagiarism in the past work of a staff writer for CPI&#x27;s 2002 book &quot;Capitol Offenders&quot;. CPI responded by hiring a copy editor to review all work, issuing a revised version of &quot;Capitol Offenders&quot;, sending letters of apology to all reporters whose work was plagiarized, authoring a new corrections policy, and returning an award the book received from Investigative Reporters and Editors. He went on to work for a political consulting firm that specializes in opposition research. In March 2007, he told the &quot;Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel&quot; that the center&#x27;s official version &quot;is not accurate in telling the full story of why I left the center,&quot; but did not elaborate.

Baskin led the organization until May 24, 2006.

Baskin was followed by Wendell Rawls Jr., who was named the center&#x27;s interim executive director. Rawls had previously worked as the center&#x27;s managing director — being named to that post by Baskin on December 19, 2005. He joined CPI in August 2005.

===2007–2022===
In 2007, Rawls was succeeded by William Buzenberg, a vice president at American Public Media/Minnesota Public Radio. Buzenberg was first interviewed for the position in 2004 during the hiring process that ultimately led to the selection of his predecessor, Roberta Baskin.

According to a report by Lewis, &quot;the number of full-time staff was reduced by one-third&quot; in early 2007. By December 2007, the number of full-time staff had dropped to 25, down from a high of 40. At the time, Buzenberg said &quot;It&#x27;s a great, great place, but I will not mislead you... [Lewis] quite frankly left the center in great shape financially, but when you have a visionary who leaves, how do you continue? &#x27;With difficulty&#x27; is the answer.&quot;

Baskin publicly disputed Buzenberg&#x27;s claims in a letter to the &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; where she wrote, &quot;contrary to the statement from current Executive Director Bill Buzenberg, the center was not left &#x27;in great shape financially&#x27; by my predecessor. Much of the money raised during the year prior to my tenure was used to offset budget overruns on several previous projects. I replaced our director of development and made fundraising my number one priority, much as Buzenberg has done. As a rookie fundraiser, I take pride in the fact that I was able to raise millions of dollars.&quot;

In 2008, Lewis reflected on the transition period following his resignation and said, &quot;I regret what happened to my staff and the condition of the Center. It&#x27;s no secret it had a less than enviable few years. But that&#x27;s one of the reasons I thought it was important to leave. I had founded it and run it for 15 years, and at some point the founder does have to leave the building...I don&#x27;t regret it, I think it was important that I left, but I do feel badly about the hardship it brought to people I think the world of.&quot;

In 2010, &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; Investigative Fund merged into the CPI, and eight &quot;Huffington Post&quot; journalists moved to CPI.

In 2011, CPI eliminated 10 staff positions in order to compensate for a $2 million budget shortfall. Buzenberg and other senior staffers also took salary cuts. CPI board chairman Bruce Finzen said the budget would be &quot;reduced between $2 million and $3 million, more like $2.5 million. The budget for next year will be in the 6 to 7 million range.&quot;

In April 2011, with support from the Knight Foundation, CPI launched iWatchnews.org as its main investigative reporting website. In August 2012, CPI stopped using iWatchnews.org and returned to its original domain.

Buzenberg stepped down from CPI at the end of 2014, at which time Peter Bale was named CEO. In November 2016, Bale resigned from the center to &quot;pursue other international media opportunities&quot; and John Dunbar assumed the role of chief executive officer.

In 2019, Susan Smith Richardson was named chief executive officer, becoming the first African-American CEO in the center&#x27;s history.

===2022–present===

In February 2024, CEO Paul Cheung resigned. The board also acted to eliminate the position of editor-in-chief, a post that had been held by Matt DeRienzo.

CPI had a revenue goal of $6 million for 2023, and fell about $2.5 million short of that. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, this has created a situation of financial peril that &quot;threatens to extinguish a newsroom of about 30 journalists that has watchdogged powerful institutions for decades.&quot; In March 2024, CPI laid off 11 newsroom employees.

==Organizational structure==

===Funding===

CPI&#x27;s donors are listed on its website for the most recent two years. CPI ceased accepting contributions from corporations and labor unions in 1996. In its first year, CPI&#x27;s budget was reported to be $200,000. In 2010, CPI had $9.2 million in revenue and $7.7 million in expenses. By 2022, annual revenues had declined to $5 million.

CPI reports receiving foundation support from a number of foundations, including the Sunlight Foundation, the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, the Omidyar Network, the Open Society Foundations, and the Pew Charitable Trusts. The Barbra Streisand Foundation reports that it has funded CPI.

In July 2014, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation donated $2.8 million to CPI to launch a new project focused on state campaign finance. According to the &quot;International Business Times&quot;, &quot;as CPI was negotiating the Arnold grant, Arnold&#x27;s name was absent from a CPI report on pension politics&quot;. Arnold has spent at least $10 million on a campaign to roll back pension benefits for public workers.

===Board of directors===

As of March 2024, CPI&#x27;s board of directors includes co-chairs James A. Kiernan and Wesley Lowery, and members Richard Lobo, George Alvarez-Correa, Bruce Finzen, Jamaal Glenn, Olivier Kamanda, Jennifer 8. Lee, Gilbert Omenn, Sue Suh, Daniel Suleiman and Andres Torres. Former board members include Elspeth Revere, Bill Kovach, Ninan Chacko, Arianna Huffington, Craig Newmark, Dan Emmett, Matthew Granade, Steve Kroft, Hendrik-Jan Laseur, Susan Loewenberg, Bevis Longsteth, Olivia Ma, Scott Siegler, Marianne Szegedy-Maszak, Christiane Amanpour, Sheila Coronel, and Molly Bingham, and Matt Thompson.

==International Consortium of Investigative Journalists==

In 1997, CPI launched the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). This international network, based in Washington, D.C., includes over 200 investigative reporters in over 90 countries and territories. Gerard Ryle is the director of ICIJ. Its website publishes &quot;The Global Muckraker&quot;. ICIJ is focused on issues such as &quot;cross-border crime, corruption, and the accountability of power&quot;. In 2013, the consortium reported having 160 member journalists from 60 countries. The ICIJ brings together teams of international journalists for different investigations (over 80 for Offshore leaks). It organized the bi-annual &quot;Daniel Pearl Awards for Outstanding International Investigative Reporting&quot;. ICIJ staff members include Michael Hudson, while the Advisory Committee in 2013 included Bill Kovach, Phillip Knightley, Gwen Lister, and Goenawan Mohamad.

===Panama Papers===

In April 2016, the ICIJ made headlines worldwide with the announcement that it and the German newspaper had received a leaked set of 11.5 million confidential documents from a secret source, created by the Panamanian corporate service provider Mossack Fonseca. The Panama Papers provided detailed information on more than 214,000 offshore companies, including the identities of shareholders and directors. The documents named the leaders of five countries — Argentina, Iceland, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and the United Arab Emirates — as well as government officials, close relatives and close associates of various heads of government of more than 40 other countries, including Brazil, China, France, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Malta, Pakistan, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Syria and the United Kingdom.

The ICIJ and received the Panama Papers in 2015 and distributed them to about 400 journalists at 107 media organizations in more than 80 countries. The first news reports based on the set, along with 149 of the documents themselves, were published on April 3, 2016. Among other planned disclosures, the full list of companies is to be released in early May 2016.

=== Paradise Papers ===
In November 2017, ICIJ launched a coordinated worldwide release of investigative reports based on the Paradise Papers, documents leaked to the German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; on offshore tax havens – tax &quot;paradises&quot; – from offshore law firm Appleby.

== Ideology ==
A 2012 &quot;The New York Times&quot; editorial described the CPI as a &quot;nonpartisan watchdog group&quot;.

In relation to a story in February 1996, CPI was characterized as a &quot;liberal group&quot; by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, a progressive media watchdog, has described CPI as &quot;progressive.&quot;

==Reports==
CPI&#x27;s first report, &quot;America&#x27;s Frontline Trade Officials&quot;, reported that nearly half of White House trade officials studied over a fifteen-year period became lobbyists for countries or overseas corporations after retirement. According to Lewis, it &quot;prompted a Justice Department ruling, a General Accounting Office report, a Congressional hearing, was cited by four presidential candidates in 1992 and was partly responsible for an executive order in January 1993 by President Clinton, placing a lifetime ban on foreign lobbying by White House trade officials.&quot;

===CPI &quot;Fat Cat Hotel&quot; 1996===

In 1996, CPI released a report called &quot;Fat Cat Hotel: How Democratic High-Rollers Are Rewarded with Overnight Stays at the White House&quot;. This report, written by Margaret Ebrahim, won an award from the Society of Professional Journalists. The report was an examination of the connection between overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom during the Clinton presidency and financial contributions to the Democratic Party as well as the Clinton re-election campaign.

===CPI &quot;Windfalls of War&quot; 2003===
In 2003, CPI published &quot;Windfalls of War&quot;, a report arguing that campaign contributions to George W. Bush affected the allocation of reconstruction contracts in Afghanistan and Iraq. &quot;Slate&quot; ran a piece arguing that due to a statistically insignificant correlation coefficient between campaign donations and winning contracts, &quot;CPI has no evidence to support its allegations.&quot;

===CPI &quot;LobbyWatch&quot; 2005===
CPI&#x27;s &quot;LobbyWatch&quot; series of reports started with its first reports in 2005. In their January 2005 publication entitled &quot;Pushing Prescriptions&quot;, CPI revealed that major pharmaceutical companies were the number one lobbyist in the United States spending $675 million over seven years on lobbying. They continued with this series in 2005 revealing how pharmaceutical companies had contacts even within the Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Trade Representatives.

===CPI &quot;Who&#x27;s Behind the Financial Meltdown?&quot; 2009===
CPI&#x27;s report, &quot;Who&#x27;s Behind the Financial Meltdown?&quot;, looking at the roots of the global financial crisis, was featured in numerous media outlets, leading &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; to ask, &quot;Why hasn&#x27;t a newspaper or magazine done this?&quot;

===CPI &quot;The Climate Change Lobby Explosion&quot; 2009===
More than 100 newspapers, magazines, wire services and websites cited CPI&#x27;s report, &quot;The Climate Change Lobby Explosion&quot;, an analysis of Senate records showing that the number of climate lobbyists had grown by three hundred percent, numbering four for every Senator.

===&quot;Tobacco Underground&quot; 2010===
&quot;Tobacco Underground&quot;, an ongoing project tracing the global trade in smuggled cigarettes, produced by CPI&#x27;s International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was honored with the Renner Award for Crime Reporting from Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), and the Overseas Press Club Award for Best Online International Reporting. The &quot;Tobacco Underground&quot; Project was funded by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Health. It is a cooperative project between the Center for Public Integrity&#x27;s International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) with journalists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Russia and Ukraine. Journalists in Brazil, Belgium, Canada, China, Italy, Paraguay and the UK also participated. that won the Overseas Press Club Award and Investigative Reporters and Editors&#x27;s Tom Renner Award for crime reporting.

===Sexual Assault on Campus 2010===
In 2010, CPI partnered with National Public Radio to publish &quot;Sexual Assault on Campus&quot;, a report which showcases the failures of colleges and government agencies to prevent sexual assaults and resolve sexual assault cases.

===&quot;Toxic Clout&quot; 2013===
The year long investigation by CPI, &quot;Toxic Clout&quot;, produced in partnership with the &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;, &quot;unmasked the deep, sometimes hidden, connections entangling the chemical industry, scientists and regulators, revealing the industry&#x27;s sway and the public&#x27;s peril.&quot; Investigative journalists examined the work of the then California Department of Public Health&#x27;s John Morgan who had been working since 1995, to debunk allegations that chromium had contributed to the cancer cluster attributed to Hinkley groundwater contamination. The CPI found glaring weaknesses in Morgan&#x27;s analysis that challenge the validity of his findings. &quot;In his first study, he dismisses what others see as a genuine cancer cluster in Hinkley. In his latest analysis, he excludes people who were exposed to the worst contamination.&quot; &quot;PBS Newshour&quot; broadcast the series which included &quot;EPA Contaminated by Conflict of Interest&quot;, &quot;Ouster of Scientist from EPA Panel Shows Industry Clout&quot;, starting in early 2013. CPI published a series of articles including &quot;Toxic clout: how Washington works (badly)&quot; and &quot;How industry scientists stalled action on carcinogen.&quot;

===Secrecy for Sale: offshore accounts 2013 to present===
In 2013, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists released the results of a 15-month-long investigation based on 260 gigabytes of data regarding the ownership of secret offshore bank accounts. The data was obtained by Gerard Ryle as a result of his investigation into the Firepower scandal. The ICIJ partnered with the &quot;Guardian&quot;, BBC, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;SonntagsZeitung&quot;, &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; and NDR to produce an investigative series on offshore banking. ICIJ and partnering agencies used the ownership information to report on government corruption across the globe, tax avoidance schemes used by wealthy people, the use of secret offshore accounts in Ponzi schemes, the active role of major banks in facilitating secrecy for their clients, and the strategies and actors that make these activities possible.

In early 2014 the ICIJ revealed as part of their &quot;Offshore Leaks&quot; that relatives of China&#x27;s political and financial elite were among those using offshore tax havens to store wealth.

===Science for Sale===
The 2016 series entitled Science for Sale included, the February 8, 2016 article &quot;About Science for Sale&quot;, the February 8, 2016 article &quot;Meet the &#x27;rented white coats&#x27; who defend toxic chemicals&quot;, the February 10, 2016 article &quot;Making a cancer cluster disappear&quot;, the February 16, 2016 article &quot;Ford spent $40 million to reshape asbestos science&quot;, the February 18, 2016 article &quot;Brokers of junk science?&quot;, and the March 31, 2016 article &quot;Senators seek better conflict disclosures for scientific articles.&quot; In this investigative series which was co-published with Vice, journalist revealed how research backed by industry has opened debates on asbestos and arsenic with some of the paid scientists saying that &quot;there are &#x27;safe&#x27; levels of asbestos despite statements to the contrary from the World Health Organization and many other august bodies&quot;.

===Professional fundraisers for veterans===
In December 2017, CPI journalist Sarah Kleiner published a report on professional fundraisers who use telemarketing to collect donations for US military veterans, then keep 90 percent of the funds collected. According to the December 12, 2017 article, Brian Arthur Hampton co-founded two Falls Church, Virginia-based non-profit organizations: the Circle of Friends for American Veterans (COFAV)—also known as &quot;American Homeless Veterans&quot;—in 1993 and then the Center for American Homeless Veterans—also known as the &quot;Association for Homeless and Disabled Veterans&quot;. During the 2000s, Hampton said he had &quot;hosted more than 100 members of Congress across 196 veterans shelter-themed forums in 46 cities&quot; in rallies for these non-profits. Kleiner revealed that according to the 2015 Center for American Homeless Veterans&#x27; tax returns, &quot;it provided just $200 in grants to other organizations out of $2.5 million in overall expenditures, the vast majority of which paid telemarketers.&quot; This report confirms findings from the investigation by the Saint Louis, Missouri Better Business Bureau (BBB) and CharityWatch. The BBB had advised &quot;consumers to exercise caution when deciding whether to contribute money&quot; to Hampton&#x27;s non-profit.

BBB also found that &quot;[c]ontracts between the Center for American Homeless Veterans and &quot;its two main fundraisers&quot;Reno, Nevada-based Outreach Calling and Phoenix, Arizona-based Midwest Publishingrevealed that &quot;just 10 percent of all donations&quot; go to the Center for American Homeless Veterans. The BBB investigation also revealed that from September 2014 to September 2016, Outreach Calling and Midwest Publishing &quot;collected nearly $5 million, with about $508,000 going to the [Center for American Homeless Veterans] and &quot;almost all the money retained&quot; by the center, &quot;went to pay salaries, legal fees and office-related expenses.&quot;

According to New York state regulators, &quot;a wealthy 49-year-old New Jersey businessman&quot;, Mark Gelvan (b.1978), is the &quot;driving force behind Outreach Calling.&quot; Outreach Calling collects money for &quot;homeless veterans,&quot; &quot;breast cancer survivors&quot;, &quot;disabled police officers&quot;, and &quot;children with leukemia&quot;, among others. According to a 2017 CPI analysis, &quot;Outreach Calling, raised more than $118 million on behalf of about two dozen charities from 2011 to 2015&quot;, retaining $106 million. This left c. 10.3 percent or $12.2 million, for the non-profit charities and those they serve - homeless veterans, breast cancer survivors, disabled police officers, and children with leukemia. In the United States, it is legal -profit telemarketers to keep 90% of the donations they solicit as long as they to not &quot;mislead prospective donors&quot; or &quot;lie to them about how their contributions will be used&quot;, according to Jim Sheehan, &quot;head of the charities bureau for the office of New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman.&quot;

===Copycat bills===

The CPI, &quot;USA TODAY&quot;, and &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; undertook a collaborative two-year investigation into copycat bills, involving 30 investigative reporters across the United States, which culminated in a series of articles published in 2019. Specifically, their investigation examined the role of organizations, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), in the American legislative process through the use of so-called &quot;model bills&quot; or copycat bills. Data journalists, using a &quot;unique-data analysis engine built on hundreds of cloud computers&quot;, compared &quot;millions of words of legislation&quot; from the LegiScan service, found that, from 2010 through 2018, legislators have introduced ALEC model bills 2,900 times. Six hundred of these became law. The data identified about 10,000 bills introduced in all American states, that included almost identical language. The investigation called the widespread successful use of these model bills spanning an eight-year period—which the report described as &quot;fill-in-the-blank legislation&quot;—amounts to &quot;perhaps the largest unreported special-interest campaign in American politics.&quot; Journalists wrote that copycat bills drive agendas in almost &quot;every statehouse&quot; and touch almost every area of public policy. The data revealed how the traditional way of writing legislation &quot;from scratch&quot; had been supplanted by the use of ALEC bills in many states. Mississippi—with a total population of less than three million—has had more &quot;model bills&quot;, that were written outside Mississippi, introduced into its Legislature than in any other state&quot; in the United States.

==Reception==
Kevin Phillips of National Public Radio has said, &quot;no other investigative organization shines so many probing flashlights into so many Washington dirty-laundry baskets.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Slate&quot; media critic Jack Shafer described CPI as having &quot;broken as many stories as almost any big-city daily in the last couple of decades&quot;.

===Funding from supporters of legal restrictions on campaign finance===
Writing in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in March 2005, commentator John Fund accused CPI of being a member of what he termed the &quot;campaign finance lobby.&quot; Citing a speech by Sean Treglia, former program manager at Pew Charitable Trusts, Fund argued that a &quot;stealth campaign&quot; by &quot;eight liberal foundations&quot; fomented a false sense of public demand for new restrictions on the financing of public campaigns. Fund singled out CPI as a front group pushing Pew&#x27;s agenda, arguing that &quot;reporters are used to attempts to hoodwink officials into thinking an issue is genuinely popular, and they frequently expose them. But when &quot;good government&quot; groups like the Center for Public Integrity engage in the same tactics, journalists usually ignore it.&quot;

CPI&#x27;s Bill Allison responded to criticisms arising from Tregalia&#x27;s speech by emphasizing that Pew&#x27;s contributions to the CPI&#x27;s work on campaign finance have always been forthrightly disclosed. In a published argument with blogger Ryan Sager, Allison also disputed the notion that the CPI&#x27;s work amounted to advocacy. Allison stated, &quot;the purpose of our grants is to do things like code hundreds of thousands of public records, put them in a database and post them on our Website so anyone can use them. The amount of money we&#x27;ve gotten to push campaign finance reform is $0.

In another essay on CPI&#x27;s website, Allison challenged CPI&#x27;s critics, and Fund specifically, arguing that:

===Looting the Seas controversy===
In November 2010, CPI published a report on bluefin tuna overfishing entitled &quot;Looting the Seas&quot;. &quot;Politico&quot; reported that &quot;to obtain key information for the project, reporters accessed a database maintained by an intergovernmental fisheries regulatory body with a password given by a source, likely breaking the law.&quot; CPI&#x27;s own lawyer and an outside law firm both determined that CPI&#x27;s staff likely broke the law in obtaining information for the report. In addition, one of the experts quoted in the associated documentary was paid $15,000 as a project consultant to CPI. The investigative methods used to produce the report became a point of contention within the organization when CPI employee John Solomon made a number of accusations against the team that had worked on the series.

CPI board member and former &quot;The New York Times&quot; Washington bureau chief Bill Kovach was asked by then-CPI president William Buzenberg to look into the matter. Kovach concluded that CPI&#x27;s reporting was &quot;sound, ethical and fully in the public interest.&quot; In addition, the board hired an outside law firm to answer the legal questions. Columbia Journalism Review reported: &quot;As for the legality of using the password to access data, the lawyers concluded that, in theory, a prosecutor might argue it violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. But whether it actually did was open to debate. And, in any case, it was highly unlikely that charges would ever be brought.&quot; In the wake of the controversy, David Kaplan and John Solomon resigned from CPI. CPI officials also withdrew their entry of the tuna story for a Pulitzer Prize. Andy Revkin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;the relationship of the television production to a United Nations agency and an environmental group can prompt questions about objectivity, but the package, over all, appears robust.&quot; The Looting the Seas series won two journalism awards: the Renner Award from Investigative Reporters and Editors and the 2010 Whitman Bassow Award from the Overseas Press Club of America.

===Coordination with advocacy groups===
In 2011, &quot;Politico&quot; called into question CPI&#x27;s collaboration with advocacy organizations. &quot;Politico&quot; reported that CPI had coordinated the release of a report on Koch Industries with Greenpeace. &quot;Politico&quot; also reported that Pew Charitable Trusts, a funder of the Looting the Seas report, hosted a screening of a CPI documentary and then organized a call to action with other NGOs for the protection of bluefin tuna. In 2008, CPI published a report on tobacco that was both funded by and promoted by an advocacy group called Tobacco Free Kids.

===Awards===
In 1996, the CPI received the Society of Professional Journalists Sigma Delta Chi Award for Public Service in Online Journalism (Independent) for their report entitled &quot;Fat Cat Hotel: How Democratic High-Rollers are Rewarded with Overnight Stays at the White House&quot; by the Public i staff and Margaret Ebrahim.

CPI received the George Polk Award in 2003 for its investigation of US military spending in Iraq and Afghanistan (&quot;Windfalls of War: U.S. Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan&quot;). Its work led to widespread media coverage that increased congressional scrutiny of military spending.

In 2011, CPI won a James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism for their investigation of weak inspections endangering factory workers and surrounding communities.

In 2012, CPI reporter Michael Hudson won a &quot;Best-in-Business&quot; award for digital investigative reporting from the Society of American Business Editors and Writers. Hudson won the award for his report entitled &quot;The Great Mortgage Cover-Up.&quot;

CPI&#x27;s work has also received awards from PEN USA, Investigative Reporters and Editors, the Society of Professional Journalists, the Association of Capitol Reporters and Editors, the National Press Foundation, the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy and others.

CPI reporter Chris Hamby won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. Hamby&#x27;s story reported that doctors and lawyers working for the coal industry helped defeat benefit claims of coal miners who had contracted black lung disease. After CPI&#x27;s Pulitzer win, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that &quot;ABC News has accused The Center for Public Integrity of downplaying the network&#x27;s contributions to a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative report, setting off a bitter public dispute between two news organizations that once worked as partners.&quot; CPI executive director Bill Buzenberg said that ABC News overstated its contributions to the story.

In 2022, the &quot;Center for Public Integrity and Transmitter Media&quot; was nominated for a Podcast &amp; Radio Peabody Award for their episode &quot;The Wealth Vortex&quot;.

<doc id="1078393" wikidata="Q5548102" url="?curid=1078393" title="Lady Georgiana Fullerton">
<text>Lady Georgiana Fullerton (; 23 September 1812 – 19 January 1885) was an English novelist, philanthropist, biographer, and school founder. She was born into a noble political family. She was one of the foremost Roman Catholic novelists writing in England during the nineteenth century.

==Biography==
Lady Georgiana Fullerton, born as Lady Georgiana Charlotte Leveson-Gower, was born at home in Tixall Hall, Staffordshire, England. She was the second daughter of Lord Granville Leveson-Gower, the first Earl of Granville, and Lady Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish. She was baptized in the Anglican faith on 10 October 1812, in Tixall Hall, where her family was staying at the time.

For many of her younger years, she resided in Paris, where her father served as the English ambassador. While there she had occasion to take piano lessons from a young Franz Liszt.

=== Marriage and conversion ===
On 13 July 1833, Lady Georgiana married embassy attaché Alexander George Fullerton, in Paris. She and her husband left Paris 8 years later, when her father retired from the embassy. They lived in Rome for a few years, where her husband converted to Roman Catholicism. She followed in his footsteps and was received into the Roman Catholic Church on Passion Sunday, 29 March 1846 in London.

In London, she joined Margaret Radclyffe Livingstone Eyre and Cecil Chetwynd Kerr, Marchioness of Lothian who, like her, were recent aristocratic converts to Catholicism. The three of them were a known source of Catholic philanthropy.

In 1855, her only son died at the age of 21, overwhelming her with grief and throwing her and her husband into a permanent state of mourning. After the loss of her only son, she devoted herself to works of philanthropy and charity. In 1856, she adopted the Franciscan tradition by enrolling herself in the Third Order of Saint Francis. At the time of the 1861 England Census, she, her husband, and eleven servants lived at 27 Chapel St in the fashionable St. George Hanover Square, Mayfair, London.

=== Charitable work ===
The Fullerton residence in Sussex was the center of her charitable works, which include her efforts to bring the sisters of St. Vincent of Paul to England. In 1872, she assisted in the founding of Frances Margaret Taylor&#x27;s school and religious community Poor Servants of the Mother of God Incarnate in which she served as the benefactor.

=== Death ===

Three years later, she moved for the final time with her husband and eight servants to Bournemouth, into their home called Ayrfield, Gervis Road in which she died on 19 January 1885. Her remains are in the Cemetery of the Sacred Heart, Roehampton. Following her death, Madame, Augustus Craven (née La Ferronays) published a work titled &quot;Lady Georgiana Fullerton, sa Vie et ses Œuvres&quot;, documenting Fullerton&#x27;s philanthropic work.

A Blue Plaque commemorating her charitable activities can be found on the Sacred Heart Church in Bournemouth.

== Publications ==
Lady Georgiana Fullerton published roughly a dozen novels and biographies on religious, historical, and romantic themes between the years 1844–1883. Most of her publications were novels, but she did publish two volumes of verse. Occasionally, Fullerton translated the works of other authors, such as &quot;The Notary&#x27;s Daughter, a Tale from the French of Madame Léonie d&#x27;Aulney&quot; (1878).

She began her writing career when she was 32, publishing her first novel, &quot;Ellen Middleton: A Tale&quot; in three volumes in July 1844. Her own brother, Lord Brougham, and Charles Cavendish Fulke Greville, commended her work. The novel contained no illustrations, which was unusual for the period.

She published her second novel, &quot;Grantley Manor&quot;, in 1847, following her conversion to Catholicism. This novel contained a more advanced style of writing compared to her first. Her most popular novel was &quot;Too Strange not to Be True&quot;, which was published in 1864. The novel described the life of a poverty stricken French emigrant fighting for survival in the Canadian wilderness.

Her other works include:

* &quot;The Old Highlander, the Ruins of Strata Florida, and Other Verses&quot; (1849)
* &quot;Lady Bird&quot; (1852)
* &quot;Life of St. Francis of Rome&quot; (1855)
* &quot;La Comtesse de Bonneval&quot; (1857)
* &quot;Rose Leblanc&quot; (1861)
* &quot;Laurentia, A Tale of Japan&quot; (1861)
* &quot;Constance Sherwood: An Autobiography of the Sixteenth Century&quot; (1865)
* &quot;Life of the Marchessa G. Falletti di Baroto&quot; (1866)
* &quot;A Stormy Life&quot; (1867)
* &quot;The Helpers of the Holy Souls&quot; (1868)
* &quot;Mrs. Gerald&#x27;s Niece&quot; (1869)
*&quot;The Gold-digger and Other Verses&quot; (1872)
* &quot;Life of Louisa de Carvajal&quot; (1873)
* &quot;Seven Stories&quot; (1873)
*&quot;Rosemary; a Tale of the Fire of London&quot; (1874)
*&quot;Sketch of the Life of the Late Father Henry Young, of Dublin&quot; (1874)
* &quot;A Will and a way&quot; (1881)
* &quot;Life of Elizabeth Lady Farkland&quot; (1883)
*&quot;A Stormy Life: Queen Margaret&#x27;s Journal, a Novel&quot; (1885)

== Reception ==
In a margin note in his copy of &quot;Ellen Middleton&quot;, a psychological tale of a woman who carries the guilty secret that her brief act of violence resulted in a child&#x27;s accidental death, American author Edgar Allan Poe wrote: &quot;A remarkable work, and one which I find much difficulty in admitting to be the composition of a woman. Not that many good and glorious things have not been the composition of women – but, because, here, the severe precision of style, the thoroughness, and the luminousness, are points never observable, in even the most admirable of their writings.&quot;

Like most critics, &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; responded approvingly in 1844 to Fullerton&#x27;s first effort: &quot;To say of &quot;Ellen Middleton&quot; that it evinces extraordinary talent in the writer, would be to make use of language which is quite inappropriate to the occasion. It is not talent, but power – marvelous power over the deeper feelings of the human heart, which these burning pages set forth.&quot;

Responding in October 1847 to Fullerton&#x27;s second novel &quot;Grantley Manor&quot;, about a Protestant husband and Catholic wife unable to live together openly due to his father&#x27;s prejudice against Catholicism, the reviewer for &quot;The New Monthly Belle Assemblée&quot; castigated her for her rejection of Anglicanism in favor of &quot;Romish glories,&quot; commenting, &quot;It is all very well, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, to expel the sin of bigotry, and the falsehood of those rampant Calvinists, who teach children that the Pope is the devil without his horns. We know there are many excellent Christians in that other faith, though it be full of pitfalls...but we do not see either profit or pleasure in the task of illuminating with the pictures of your genius the dull old missal which has been forgotten in England since the glorious Reformation.&quot;

<doc id="1078397" wikidata="Q281774" url="?curid=1078397" title="Geoffrey Gaimar">
<text>Geoffrey Gaimar (fl. 1130s), also written Geffrei or Geoffroy, was an Anglo-Norman chronicler. His contribution to medieval literature and history was as a translator from Old English to Anglo-Norman. His &quot;L&#x27;Estoire des Engleis&quot;, or &quot;History of the English People&quot;, written about 1136–1140, was a chronicle in eight-syllable rhyming couplets, running to 6,526 lines.

==Overview of his work==
The &quot;L&#x27;Estoire des Engleis&quot; opens with a brief mention of King Arthur, whose actions affect the plot of the interpolated tale of Havelok the Dane. That aside, most of the first 3,500 lines are translations out of a variant text of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and subsequent portions from other (Latin and French) sources that remain unidentified.

Gaimar claims to have also written a version of the &quot;Brut&quot; story, a translation of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s chronicle &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (c. 1136) into Anglo-Norman verse, which was commissioned by Constance, wife of Ralph FitzGilbert, a Lincolnshire landowner. Constance appears to have been implicated in the writing process. Gaimar&#x27;s translation, if it existed, antedated Wace&#x27;s Norman &quot;Roman de Brut&quot; (c. 1155), but no copy of Gaimar&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot; (also known as &quot;L&#x27;Estoire des Bretuns&quot;) has survived, being superseded by the latecomer. Ian Short argues that Gaimar&#x27;s &quot;Estoire des Bretuns&quot; was no more than a short epitome of the pre-Arthurian section of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, which might explain why Wace&#x27;s later, full translation of the text became more popular and ultimately superseded Gaimer&#x27;s.

Gaimar did not create two separate and distinct chronicles, and the two &quot;estoires&quot; were merely the former and latter sections of a long-running history starting from the Argonauts&#x27; quest for the Golden Fleece to the reign of William II &quot;Rufus&quot; (died 1100) that Gaimar set out to write. Gaimar&#x27;s scheme was greatly expanded in scope from the translation work on Geoffrey of Monmouth, the former part, which the patron had requested. Ironically, it was solely the latter part covering the Anglo-Saxon period that was transmitted by later copyists, as a continuation to Wace. The scribe of one such copy, in a late 13th-century manuscript (B.L. Royal 13 A xx i), dubbed the portion with the title &quot;Estoire des Engles&quot;. The so-called &quot;lost &quot;L&#x27;Estoire des Bretuns&quot;&quot; (History of the Britons) was an expedient term coined by 19th-century commentators.

A version of Havelok the Dane occurs at the beginning of &quot;L&#x27;Estoire des Engles&quot;, which must have originally been interpolated in between the history of the Britons and the history of the English, serving as a bridge. Unlike the Middle English version of the legend, Gaimar&#x27;s version connects Havelok to King Arthur (making him responsible for destroying the Danish kingdom that Havelok would inherit.) Additionally there is a mention of a sword, Calibur (Excalibur), pointing to Gaimar&#x27;s knowledge of Galfridian legendary history that predated the advent of Wace&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Canary&quot; Murder Case (1927) is a murder mystery novel which deals with the murders of an attractive nightclub singer known as &quot;the Canary,&quot; and, eventually, her boyfriend, solved by Philo Vance. S. S. Van Dine&#x27;s classic whodunnit, second in the Philo Vance series, is said by Howard Haycraft to have broken &quot;all modern publishing records for detective fiction.&quot; The earliest editions give the title with quotation marks around the word &quot;Canary&quot;, but most subsequent editions omit them.

==Plot summary==

The beautiful Margaret Odell, famous Broadway beauty and ex-Follies girl known as &quot;The Canary&quot;, is found murdered in her apartment. She has a number of men in her life, ranging from high society to gangsters, and more than one man visited her apartment on the night she dies. It is Philo Vance&#x27;s characteristic erudition that leads him to a key clue that allows him to penetrate a very clever alibi and reveal the killer. &quot;The strangeness, the daring, the seeming impenetrability of the crime marked it as one of the most singular and astonishing cases in New York&#x27;s police annals; and had it not been for Philo Vance&#x27;s participation in its solution, I firmly believe it would have remained one of the great unsolved mysteries of this country.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;It is difficult now to grasp the extent of Van Dine&#x27;s success in America, and to a much lesser extent in Britain. ... Van Dine&#x27;s second book was on the American best-seller lists for months ... It was said that he had lifted the detective story on to the plane of a fine art, and by his own account he was the favourite crime writer of two Presidents.&quot;

Some contemporary reviews:
&quot;A model of everything a detective story should be – a monument, a cathedral amongst detective stories.&quot; Arnold Palmer in the &quot;London Sphere&quot;. &quot;Not only a rattling good yarn that holds you to the end – it&#x27;s an education in itself. ... Belongs to the aristocracy of detective fiction.&quot; Harry Hansen in the &quot;New York World&quot;. &quot;One of the most ingenious and thrilling tales of crime that I have seen. Philo Vance is an original and fascinating person.&quot; William Lyon Phelps.

&quot;The Canary Murder Mystery&quot; today is primarily of interest as a classic puzzle mystery with an interesting mechanical solution. &quot;It should be said that the best of the Van Dine stories are models of construction. Utterly remote from real life, they remain fascinating by strict adherence to the rules of their own dotty logic, and through their creator&#x27;s self-absorbed immersion in his own work.&quot;

Author and radio raconteur Jean Shepherd cited &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot; as his earliest literary inspiration. One detailed discussion was during his February 1, 1968 broadcast on WOR.
==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
A film, &quot;The Canary Murder Case&quot;, was made by Paramount Pictures in 1929, directed by Malcolm St. Clair and Frank Tuttle and starring William Powell as Philo Vance and Louise Brooks as the Canary.

<text>Richard Garnett C.B. (27 February 1835 – 13 April 1906) was a scholar, librarian, biographer and poet. He was keeper of printed books at British Museum from 1890 to 1899.

==Life==
Garnett was educated at a school in Bloomsbury. He entered the British Museum in 1851 as an assistant librarian. Anthony Panizzi, a close friend of Garnett&#x27;s father, invited the then 16-year-old Richard to work at the British Museum following his father&#x27;s death. He married Olivia Narney Singleton in 1863. They had six surviving children. In 1875, he became superintendent of the Reading Room, in 1881, editor of the General Catalogue of Printed Books, and in 1890, succeeding George Bullen, he was Keeper of Printed Books until his retirement in 1899.

His literary works include numerous translations from the Greek, German, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese; several books of verse; the book of short stories &quot;The Twilight of the Gods&quot; (1888, 16 stories; 12 stories added in the 1903 edition); biographies of Thomas Carlyle, John Milton, William Blake, and others; &quot;The Age of Dryden&quot; (1895); &quot;Essays of an Ex-Librarian&quot; (1901); a &quot;History of Italian Literature&quot;; &quot;English Literature: An Illustrated Record&quot; (with Edmund Gosse); and many articles for encyclopaedias, including the ninth and tenth editions of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, and the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

He also discovered and edited some unpublished poems of Shelley (&quot;Relics of Shelley&quot;, 1862) and edited the republication of the newly discovered poetry collection &quot;Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire&quot; in 1898. His poem &quot;Where Corals Lie&quot; was set to music by Sir Edward Elgar as part of &quot;Sea Pictures&quot; and was first performed in 1899. Long interested in astrology, in 1880 he published a monograph on the subject, &quot;The Soul and the Stars&quot;, in the &quot;University Magazine&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;A. G. Trent&quot;; ill health prevented him from writing more on the subject. He wrote a biography of William Johnson Fox, published 1910.

In 1901, Garnett was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

He died on 13 April 1906 and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery.

According to Joseph McCabe, Garnett &quot;cherished a genuine and somewhat mystical belief in religion, which combined hostility to priestcraft and dogma with a modified belief in astrology&quot;.

<doc id="1078407" wikidata="Q2053466" url="?curid=1078407" title="The Greene Murder Case">
<text>The Greene Murder Case is a 1928 mystery novel by S. S. Van Dine. It focuses on the murders, one by one, of members of the wealthy and contentious Greene family. This is the third in the series of Philo Vance whodunits, and the first of the Vance books not inspired by a real-life crime.

==Plot synopsis==
Philo Vance takes a hand when, one evening, a daughter of the Greene family is shot to death and another one is wounded. The family comprises two sons and three daughters (the youngest, Ada, is adopted) under the rule of their mother, a bedridden invalid who spends her days feeling sorry for herself and cursing her ungrateful children. The family is required to live in the Greene mansion under the terms of their father&#x27;s will. The German cook seems strangely attached to the adopted daughter; other hangers-on include the mother&#x27;s physician, who is courting Sibella Greene, and the enigmatic butler. Later, the two Greene brothers and the mother are killed and the only family left are the two surviving daughters, jaunty modern Sibella and shy Ada, against whom two murder attempts have been made. The murders are complicated by sets of mysterious footprints appearing in the snow, which seem to have been made in an impossible way and by the suggestion that the paralyzed mother has been seen walking in the halls. Philo Vance reduces the facts of the case to just under a hundred paragraphs, sets them in order, and solves the case.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot; became the number-four bestseller in the United States during its first year of publication.

==Film adaptations==
&quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot; (1929) starred William Powell as Philo Vance. Another version, entitled &quot;Night of Mystery&quot; (1937), was based on &quot;The Greene Murder Case&quot; and starred Grant Richards as Philo Vance. Reportedly, no prints exist outside of university/museum collections. Czech Television produced a film titled &quot;Vyvraždění rodiny Greenů&quot; in 2002, directed by Jiří Strach and starring Jiří Dvořák as Philo Vance.

<text>Earl Harcourt, of Stanton Harcourt in the County of Oxford, was a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1749 for Simon Harcourt, 2nd Viscount Harcourt. He was made Viscount Nuneham at the same time, also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Harcourt was the son of the Honourable Simon Harcourt and the grandson of Simon Harcourt, Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, who had been created Baron Harcourt, of Stanton Harcourt in the County of Oxford, on 3 September 1711, and Viscount Harcourt, of Stanton Harcourt in the County of Oxford, on 24 July 1721. Both these titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain.

The first earl fulfilled various diplomatic duties for King George II and George III as Prince of Wales and then King. In 1772, Harcourt was appointed Viceroy of Ireland. Five years later, he died at his own estate at Nuneham by falling into a well. He was succeeded by his eldest son, George, who was in turn succeeded by his younger brother, William. The titles became extinct on the latter&#x27;s death in 1830 as neither brother left legitimate surviving sons of their own.

The viscountcy was revived in 1917 in favour of Lewis Vernon Harcourt. He was a descendant of the Right Reverend Edward Venables-Vernon-Harcourt, the son of George Venables-Vernon, 1st Baron Vernon, by his third wife Martha Harcourt, daughter of the aforementioned Simon Harcourt, son of Simon Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt. See Viscount Harcourt for further history of this branch of the family.

The ancient family of Harcourt held Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire from the 12th century and other later Oxfordshire seats included Cokethorpe House and Nuneham House. In addition, they held estates in Staffordshire at Ellenhall Hall and Abbey House, Ranton Priory.

In some writings she argues against Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. She became a popular writer of tales for young people, which she hoped would influence adult minds as well. Among her other books are &quot;Parables from Nature&quot;, &quot;Worlds not Realized&quot;, &quot;Proverbs Illustrated&quot;, and &quot;Aunt Judy&#x27;s Tales&quot;. She edited &quot;Aunt Judy&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, a family publication written by various family members.

==Science==
Gatty became fascinated by marine biology through contact with a second cousin, Charles Henry Gatty, a Royal Society member. There may also have been influence from William Henry Harvey, whom she met while convalescing in Hastings in 1848. She corresponded with many great marine biologists of her day including George Johnston, George Busk and Robert Brown. She wrote &quot;British Sea Weeds&quot;, a book that was more accessible than previous ones on the subject. This illustrated book, published in 1872, was the outcome of 14 years&#x27; work and described 200 species. It continued to be used into the 1950s.

Gatty&#x27;s other collecting and scientific interests included sundials, which led to an 1872 book on 350 of them, focusing on their artistry and literary nature rather than their astronomical aspects, although it discussed historical developments. The coverage of sundials on mainland Europe and some illustrations were major contributions from a friend, Eleanor Lloyd.

==Children&#x27;s literature==
While many see her interests in literature and science as independent, she used the combination of children&#x27;s literature and scientific curiosity as a way to argue against Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. 

Primarily in &quot;Parables from Nature&quot;, Gatty could preach to children in a way they enjoyed, in which God and nature were treated concurrently. The publication of the &quot;Parables&quot; coincided with the evolutionary theories, so that her writing influenced children&#x27;s attitudes towards science. It tended to have a strong moral tone, and often used religion and God to influence their upbringing. 

Victorian children&#x27;s literature at the time was designed to teach children lessons and morals rather than capture their attention. Gatty&#x27;s increased use of illustrations and folk and fairy tales meant children enjoyed reading her more.

==Selected works==
Her fiction for children includes: 
*&quot;The Fairy Godmothers and Other Tales&quot; (London: George Bell, 1851) – four stories dedicated &quot;To My Children&quot; Gatty was paid in marine botany books for this.
*&quot;Parables from Nature&quot; (1855 to 1871) – &quot;First Series&quot;, &quot;Second Series&quot;, etc.
*&quot;Legendary Tales&quot;, illustrated by Phiz (Bell and Daldy, 1858)
*&quot;Aunt Judy&#x27;s Tales&quot; (1859)
*&quot;Aunt Judy&#x27;s Letters&quot;, illustrated by Clara S. Lane (Bell and Daldy, 1862) – sequel to &quot;Tales&quot;

She also authored, collaborated and translated academic works:
*&quot;Recollections of the Life of the Rev. A. J. Scott D.D., Lord Nelson&#x27;s chaplain&quot; (1842) Saunders and Otley, London
*Travels and Adventures of the Rev. Joseph Wolff (1861) Saunders, Otley and Co., London. She and her daughters collaborated with Joseph Wolff to write his autobiography.
*The History of a Mouthful of Bread (1864), translated from the eighth edition of the work by Jean Macé
*&quot;The Book of Sun-Dials&quot; (1872) Bell and Daldy, York Street, Covent Garden, London. Illustrated
*British Sea Weeds (1872) Bell and Daldy, York Street, Covent Garden, London. Illustrated

==Personal life==
Gatty was born in Burnham on Crouch, Essex, the daughter of Mary Frances (née Ryder) and the Rev. Alexander John Scott. Her father was a linguist, scholar and Royal Navy chaplain who served under Lord Nelson. Her mother died when she was young and Gatty took on a caring role in a family consisting of her father, grandfather and younger sister Horatia. She and her sister were educated at home, learning Italian and German, painting and writing poetry. Her poetry was encouraged by Margaret Holford but after a rejection by &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; she did not pursue this further.

The family knew a local curate Rev. Alfred Gatty, D.D. from 1837. She married him on 8 July 1839 at St Giles in the Fields, Holborn, Camden (after overcoming her father&#x27;s objections), and moved into the vicarage of the Church of St Mary, Ecclesfield near Sheffield, shortly after, on the recommendation of her uncle. She lived there for the rest of her life. They had eight children. In 1848 she was introduced to collecting marine algae while in Hastings recovering from a breakdown. Her husband died in 1903.

Gatty was the mother of Juliana Horatia Ewing, also a writer of children&#x27;s books, of the musician and author Charles Tindal Gatty, of the judge Sir Stephen Herbert Gatty, and of Alfred Scott-Gatty who served as Garter Principal King of Arms. Her daughter Horatia Eden shared her interest in marine biology, inherited her mother&#x27;s collections and added to them herself especially marine invertebrates.

Gatty suffered from ill health for much of her life, possibly from undiagnosed multiple sclerosis. Her frequent illnesses brought close friendship with Dr George Johnston, who was noted for advocating pain-relieving medication. He advised her to use chloroform in childbirth and in 1851 Gatty became the first woman in Sheffield to do so. She died at home on 4 October 1873 and was buried in Ecclesfield churchyard.

==Legacy==
A marble tablet was installed in the north side of the nave of the Church of St Mary, Ecclesfield, in memory of her. It indicates that it was subscribed by more than a 1,000 children &quot;as a token of gratitude for the many books she wrote for them&quot;. There is also a stained glass window in the chancel that was installed in her memory. It includes a representation of her as well as of the Sermon on the Mount and several parables.

Gatty amassed a large collection of marine material, gathered by herself and by correspondents in far corners of the British Empire as well as the UK.

This was donated to two places by her daughter, Horatia Katherine Francis Eden (née Gatty). Weston Park Museum received part of the collection of seaweed and sponges assembled by both Gatty and her daughter. These were donated in several parts between 1877 and 1909. It comprises 350 items including both folio albums and individual specimens.

In April 1907 part of Margaret Gatty’s herbarium was donated by her daughter to the Gatty Marine Laboratory in St Andrews and later incorporated into the St Andrews University Herbarium in the Department of Botany. Starting in 1947 these specimens were partly described by Helen Blackler. More recently the herbarium was moved to the St Andrews Botanic Garden. The laboratory was named after its benefactor Charles Henry Gatty (1836-1903), a distant cousin of Gatty’s husband. A total of 8,825 specimens and 500 plates exist currently at St Andrews, many in their original albums.

Several species of seaweed were named after her, including the Australian monospecific genus &quot;Gattya pinnella&quot;.

<text>Alexander Geddes (14 September 1737 – 26 February 1802) was a Scottish Catholic theologian and scholar. He translated a major part of the Old Testament of the Catholic Bible into English.

==Translations and commentaries==
Geddes was born at Rathven, Banffshire, of Catholic parentage, and educated for the priesthood at the local seminary of Scalan, and at Paris; he became a priest in his native county.

His translation of the &quot;Satires&quot; of Horace made him known as a scholar, but his liberalism led to his suspension. He then went to London, where he became known to Baron Petre, who enabled him to proceed with a new translation of the Bible for English Catholics, which he carried on as far as the Book of Second Chronicles and the Prayer of Manasseh which was published in 2 volumes (1792–1797). A translation of &quot;Psalms&quot; was published in 1807. Geddes was also a poet, and wrote &quot;Linton: a Tweedside Pastoral&quot;, &quot;Carmen Seculare pro Gallica Gente&quot; (1790), in praise of the French Revolution.

He released his &quot;Critical Remarks on the Hebrew Scriptures&quot; in 1800, wherein he largely anticipated the German school of higher criticism. The result of this publication was Geddes&#x27;s suspension from all ecclesiastical functions. Arguing for the mythic character of the Pentateuch, he cast doubt not on those books&#x27; veracity but their historicity, seeing in the Fall for example &quot;the mythic account of the painful condition of human life,&quot; rather than a historical chronicle.

He died without recanting his works of higher criticism, but received absolution at the hands of a French priest, though public Mass for his soul was forbidden by the ecclesiastical powers. He is buried next to the south-east corner of St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Paddington, London.

==Publications==
*The Holy Bible, or the Books accounted sacred by Jews and Christians, otherwise called the books of the Old and New Covenant; faithfully translated from corrected texts of the originals. With various readings, explanatory notes, and critical remarks. By Alexander Geddes. (J. Davis, London. 1797).

<doc id="1078424" wikidata="Q1436350" url="?curid=1078424" title="The Bishop Murder Case">
<text>The Bishop Murder Case (1929) is the fourth in a series of mystery novels by S. S. Van Dine about fictional detective Philo Vance. The detective solves a mystery built around a nursery rhyme. &quot;The Bishop Murder Case&quot; is believed to be the first nursery-rhyme mystery book.

==Plot summary==
The story involves a series of murders taking place in a wealthy neighborhood of New York City. The first murder, of a Mr. Joseph Cochrane Robin, who is found pierced by an arrow, is accompanied by a note signed &quot;The Bishop&quot;, with an extract from the nursery rhyme, &quot;Who Killed Cock Robin&quot;. This crime takes place at the home of an elderly physicist with a beautiful young ward and a private archery range. District Attorney Markham finds the circumstances so unusual that he asks his friend Philo Vance to advise upon the psychological aspects of the crime. Further murders connected with the physicist&#x27;s family and neighbours are accompanied with similar extracts from Mother Goose, such as the case of Johnny Sprigg, &quot;who was shot through the middle of his wig, wig, wig.&quot; Midway through the book, an elderly woman confesses to the crimes, but this possibility is discounted by the police for physical reasons and by Philo Vance for psychological ones. Vance and the police luckily discover the kidnapping and confinement of a little Miss Moffatt before the child suffocates in the closet in which she has been locked. Vance finally realizes the significance of one character&#x27;s pointed reference to &quot;The Pretenders&quot;, a play written by Henrik Ibsen. Vance arranges a spectacular finale in which the criminal is poisoned by a glass of liqueur which that person prepared for another suspect.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
Modern interest in this book stems at least partly from its role as a precursor of other books with a similar design, such that the underlying circumstances of a series of murders appear to be related to an external source, such as, in this instance, Mother Goose stories. Many other later Golden Age mystery novels are constructed around a formal scheme. Agatha Christie used this motif in &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; and a number of other novels constructed around the basis of a nursery rhyme (&quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot;, &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;, etc.), or another linking device like the alphabet (&quot;The A.B.C. Murders&quot;).

&quot;Philo Vance is more pedantic than ever and talks absolute rot except for passages quoted from encyclopedias about modern physics and math. A young scientist is &#x27;framed&#x27; for a series of apparently meaningless killings and the solution is pulled out of a hat after Vance has finished lecturing.&quot;

&quot;The murderer in this story has an uncommon sense of humor and of sportsmanship. In a non-stop trail of successive murders, a note is discovered at each scene. Each note contains a nursery rhyme with a false clue and is signed &quot;The Bishop.&quot; Philo Vance finally puts a stop to the fun, which had included a generous sprinkling of archery, chess and astronomy, mixed with poison and bloodshed.&quot;

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
A film starring Basil Rathbone was made of &quot;The Bishop Murder Case&quot; in 1930. The film was an early &quot;talkie&quot; and lacks a music soundtrack.

Some elements from the mystery&#x27;s plot were referenced in Dario Argento&#x27;s giallo comeback movie, &quot;Sleepless&quot; (called &quot;Non ho sonno&quot; in Italy), which featured killings referencing a nursery rhyme.
