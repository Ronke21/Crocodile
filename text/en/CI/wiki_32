<text>Henry Maitland Macintosh (10 June 1892 – 26 July 1918) was a Scottish track and field athlete and winner of gold medal in 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

Macintosh was born in Kelso and educated at Glenalmond College and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. A sprinter, at the Stockholm Olympic Games, he was eliminated in the first round of the 100 metres and did not finish in the semi-final of the 200 metres. He won a gold medal in the second leg in the British 4 × 100 m relay team despite finishing second after the United States in the semifinal. The United States was later disqualified for a fault in passing the baton – the same mistake was made in the final by the world record holder and main favourite German team.

In 1913, Macintosh served as president of the Cambridge University Athletics Club, won the Scottish title, and equalled the British record for over 100 yards. He ran his last competition in 1914 and left for South Africa. After the start of World War I, he was commissioned into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He died as a captain at age 26 from wounds. He was buried in Senlis French National Cemetery.

<text>Country Life (stylised in all caps) is a British weekly perfect-bound glossy magazine, launched in 1897, that is published by Future plc. It was based in London at 110 Southwark Street until 2016, when moved to Farnborough, Hampshire. In 2022, the magazine moved back to London at 121–141 Westbourne Terrace, Paddington.

== History ==

&quot;Country Life&quot; was launched in 1897, incorporating &quot;Racing Illustrated&quot;. At this time it was owned by Edward Hudson, the owner of Lindisfarne Castle and various Lutyens-designed houses including The Deanery in Sonning; in partnership with George Newnes Ltd (in 1905 Hudson bought out Newnes).

At that time golf and racing served as its main content, as well as the property coverage, initially of manorial estates, which is still such a large part of the magazine. Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the late Queen Mother, used to appear frequently on its front cover. Now the magazine covers a range of subjects, from gardens and gardening to country house architecture, art and books, and property to rural issues, luxury products and interiors.

In 1997, the centenary of the magazine was celebrated by a special issue, the publishing of a book by Roy Strong, the broadcast of a BBC2 TV programme on a year in the life of the magazine, and staging a Gold Medal-winning garden at the Chelsea Flower Show. In 1999, the magazine launched a new website.

In 2007, the magazine celebrated its 110th anniversary with a special souvenir issue on 4 January. Since May 2008 the magazine has been issued each Wednesday, having been on sale each Thursday for the past 111 years.

== Topics ==
The first several dozen pages of each issue are devoted to colour advertisements for upmarket residential property

The magazine covers various aspects of rural life. It is primarily concerned with rural communities and their environments as well as the concerns of country dwellers and landowners and has a diverse readership which, although mainly UK based is also international.

The other rural pursuits and interests covered include hunting, shooting, farming, equestrian news and gardening and there are regular news and opinion pieces as well as rural politics. There are reviews of books, food and wine, art and architecture and antiques and crafts. Illustrative material includes the &quot;Tottering-by-Gently&quot; cartoon by Annie Tempest.

Recent feature articles have included Charles, Prince of Wales guest-editing an issue of &quot;Country Life&quot; in 2013, a historic revelation which revealed the true face of Shakespeare for the first time in 2015, and in 2016 an exclusive on where the Great Fire of London began in 1666. There was a special commemorative issue in June 2016 on the occasion of the Queen&#x27;s 90th birthday.

== BBC documentary ==
In March 2016, &quot;Country Life&quot; was featured in a three-part documentary series produced by Spun Gold which aired on BBC2 called &quot;Land of Hope and Glory, British Country Life&quot;.

<doc id="1054247" wikidata="Q681160" url="?curid=1054247" title="Dermatomyositis">
<text>Dermatomyositis (DM) is a long-term inflammatory autoimmune disorder which affects the skin and the muscles. Its symptoms are generally a skin rash and worsening muscle weakness over time. These may occur suddenly or develop over months. Other symptoms may include weight loss, fever, lung inflammation, or light sensitivity. Complications may include calcium deposits in muscles or skin.
Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder featuring both humoral and T-cell autoimmune processes. Dermatomyositis may develop as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with several forms of malignancy. It is known to be associated with several viruses, especially coxsackievirus, but no definitive causal link has been found. Dermatomyositis is considered a type of inflammatory myopathy. Diagnosis is typically based on some combination of symptoms, blood tests, electromyography, and muscle biopsies. Eighty percent of adults and sixty percent of children with juvenile dermatomyositis have a myositis-specific antibody (MSA).
Although no cure for the condition is known, treatments generally improve symptoms. Treatments may include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy, orthotics, assistive devices, and rest. Medications in the corticosteroids family are typically used with other agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine recommended if steroids are not working well. Intravenous immunoglobulin may also improve outcomes. Most people improve with treatment and in some, the condition resolves completely.
About one in 100,000 people receive a new diagnosis of dermatomyositis each year. The condition usually occurs in those in their 40s and 50s with women being affected more often than men. People of any age, however, may be affected. The condition was first described in the 1800s.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main symptoms include several kinds of skin rash along with muscle weakness in both upper arms or thighs. Although dermatomyositis is closely related to polymyositis and is sometimes assumed to be a complication of that disease, most patients with dermatomyositis develop skin symptoms before any muscle involvement.

=== Skin ===
One form the rashes take is called &quot;heliotrope&quot; (a purplish color) or lilac, but may also be red. It can occur around the eyes along with swelling, but also occurs on the upper chest or back what is called the &quot;shawl&quot; (around the neck) or &quot;V-sign&quot; above the breasts and may also occur on the face, upper arms, thighs, or hands. Another form the rash takes is called Gottron&#x27;s sign, which is red or violet, sometimes scaly, slightly raised papules that erupt on any of the finger joints (the metacarpophalangeal joints or the interphalangeal joints). Gottron&#x27;s papules may also be found over other bony prominences including the elbows, knees, or feet. All these rashes are made worse by exposure to sunlight, and are often very itchy, painful, and may bleed.

If a person exhibits only skin findings characteristic of DM, without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes, then he or she may be experiencing amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM), formerly known as &quot;dermatomyositis sine myositis&quot;.

=== Muscles ===
People with DM experience progressively worsening muscle weakness in the proximal muscles (for example, the shoulders and thighs). Tasks that use these muscles: standing from sitting, lifting, and climbing stairs, can become increasingly difficult for people with dermatomyositis.

=== Respiratory ===
In some people, the condition affects the diaphragm muscle, the lungs directly (through inflammation), or both. This causes difficulty breathing, and dermatomyositis is considered to be a restrictive lung disease in patients with these symptoms. Respiratory symptoms occur in about 40% of people with dermatomyositis, and in these people, the symptoms may slowly progress and frequently are identified as an eventual cause of death. The main driver of respiratory failure in most of these patients is the damage to the lung interstitia, rather than diaphragm weakness.

=== Cardiac ===
In dermatomyositis, many patients have mild myocarditis and cardiac conduction system abnormalities which may be detected if the patient undergoes special testing. However, these abnormalities typically have no symptoms or clinical consequences. In a study of 26 patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis, only one patient reported chest pain.

More rarely, these abnormalities can cause greater issues and lead to arrhythmias, heart failure, or damage to heart valves. For those dermatomyositis patients who do have cardiac symptoms caused by the disease, their clinical course may be much worse than usual.

=== Other ===
Around 30% of people have swollen, painful joints, but this is generally mild.

Later in the course of the disease, patients often experience difficulty swallowing, called dysphagia, which makes it hard to move food from the mouth to the stomach. The muscles of the esophagus may become weak, leading to reduced or irregular movements that prevent proper swallowing. Additionally, individuals might suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing heartburn and irritation.

== Causes ==

The pathogenesis of dermatomyositis involves an autoimmune-mediated process characterized by immune complex deposition and complement activation, leading to microangiopathy in both muscle and skin tissues. The specific mechanism of tissue injury is variable, depending on the specific autoantibodies and immune cell types involved. The microangiopathy has a non-uniform pattern: within a single muscle fiber, some capillaries may be heavily affected while others seem to be unharmed.

In contrast to polymyositis, which pathologically centers on damage to the endomysium of muscle fibers, dermatomyositis damages both the endomysium and the perimysium. This indicates that tissue damage from dermatomyositis is not limited to the capillaries and the tissues immediately surrounding them; it also damages the larger vessels of the muscle fibers and skin tissue, potentially causing wider structural damage.

The complement system plays a crucial role in the tissue injury of dermatomyositis, through the formation and deposition of immune complexes. Autoantibodies target muscle and skin antigens, leading to the activation of the classical complement pathway, ultimately forming the membrane attack complex (MAC) on the endothelial cells of microvasculature. MAC causes direct endothelial cell damage by perforating the cell membrane and ultimately lysing (destroying) the cell due to osmotic effects. The destruction of vascular endothelium results in increased vascular permeability, furthering the pro-inflammatory immune cell infiltration of the tissue, and also results in tissue ischemia due to the lack of blood flow. Additionally, complement fragments facilitate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells like macrophages and T lymphocytes, further driving the inflammatory response and resulting damage to local tissue. However, the specific sequence of complement activation is not completely understood and may depend on the pathological subtype of the disease.

As many as 40% of cases of dermatomyositis are paraneoplastic manifestations of an underlying cancer. The most commonly associated cancers are ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer overall, but the most frequent associations can vary depending on patient race or ethnicity.

Inherited genetic factors play at least a partial role in developing the disease, and HLA subtypes HLA-DR3, HLA-DR52, and HLA-DR6 seem to create a disposition to autoimmune dermatomyositis.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis of dermatomyositis is based on five criteria, which are also used to differentially diagnose with respect to polymyositis:

# Muscle weakness in both thighs or both upper arms
# Using a blood test, finding higher levels of enzymes found in skeletal muscle, including creatine kinase, aldolase, and glutamate oxaloacetate, pyruvate transaminases and lactate dehydrogenase
# Using electromyography (testing of electric signalling in muscles), finding all three of: erratic, repetitive, high-frequency signals; short, low-energy signals between skeletal muscles and motor neurons that have multiple phases; and sharp activity when a needle is inserted into the muscle
# Examining a muscle biopsy under a microscope and finding mononuclear white blood cells between the muscle cells, and finding abnormal muscle cell degeneration and regeneration, dying muscle cells, and muscle cells being consumed by other cells (phagocytosis)
# Rashes typical of dermatomyositis, which include heliotrope rash, Gottron sign, and Gottron papules

The fifth criterion is what differentiates dermatomyositis from polymyositis; the diagnosis is considered definite for dermatomyositis if three of items 1 through 4 are present in addition to 5, probable with any two in addition to 5, and possible if just one is present in addition to 5.

Dermatomyositis is associated with autoantibodies, especially antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Around 80% of people with DM test positive for ANA and around 30% of people have myositis-specific autoantibodies which include antibodies to aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (anti-synthetase antibodies), including antibodies against histidine—tRNA ligase (Anti-Jo1); antibodies to signal recognition particle (SRP); and anti-Mi-2 antibodies.

Magnetic resonance imaging may be useful to guide muscle biopsy and to investigate involvement of internal organs; X-ray may be used to investigate joint involvement and calcifications.

A given case of dermatomyositis may be classified as amyopathic dermatomyositis if only skin is affected and no muscle weakness for longer than 6 months is seen according to one 2016 review, or two years according to another.

===Classification===
Dermatomyositis is a form of systemic connective tissue disorder, a class of diseases that often involves autoimmune dysfunction.

It has also been classified as an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, along with polymyositis, necrotizing autoimmune myositis, cancer-associated myositis, and sporadic inclusion body myositis.

A form of this disorder that occurs prior to adulthood is known as juvenile dermatomyositis.

== Treatment ==
No cure for dermatomyositis is known, but the symptoms can be treated. Options include medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy (including microwave and ultrasound), orthotics and assistive devices, and rest. The standard treatment for dermatomyositis is a corticosteroid drug, given either in pill form or intravenously. Immunosuppressant drugs, such as azathioprine and methotrexate, may reduce inflammation in people who do not respond well to prednisone. Periodic treatment using intravenous immunoglobulin can also improve recovery. Other immunosuppressive agents used to treat the inflammation associated with dermatomyositis include cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, and tacrolimus.

Physical therapy is usually recommended to prevent muscle atrophy and to regain muscle strength and range of motion. Many individuals with dermatomyositis may need a topical ointment, such as topical corticosteroids, for their skin disorder. They should wear high-protection sunscreen and protective clothing. Surgery may be required to remove calcium deposits that cause nerve pain and recurrent infections.

Antimalarial medications, especially hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, are used to treat the rashes, as is done for similar conditions.

Rituximab is used when people do not respond to other treatments.

As of 2016, treatments for amyopathic dermatomyositis in adults did not have a strong evidence base; published treatments included antimalarial medications, steroids, taken or orally or applied to the skin, calcineurin inhibitors applied to the skin, dapsone, intravenous immunoglobulin, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. None appears to be very effective; among them, intravenous immunoglobulin has had the best outcomes.

== Prognosis ==
The cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis may or may not improve with therapy in parallel with the improvement of the myositis. In some people, the weakness and rash resolve together. In others, the two are not linked, with one or the other being more challenging to control. Often, cutaneous disease persists after adequate control of the muscle disease.

The risk of death from the condition is much higher if the heart or lungs are affected.

Before the advent of modern treatments such as prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, chemotherapies, and other drugs, the prognosis was poor.

==Epidemiology==
Incidence of DM peaks at ages 40–50, but the disease can affect people of all ages. It tends to affect more women than men. The prevalence of DM ranges from one to 22 per 100,000 people.

==History==
The diagnostic criteria were proposed in 1975 and became widely adopted. Amyopathic DM, also called DM sine myositis, was named in 2002.

==People who were affected with dermatomyositis==
* Opera singer Maria Callas (1923–1977) allegedly had dermatomyositis from 1975 until her death.
* Actor Laurence Olivier (1907–1989) had dermatomyositis from 1974 until his death.
* American football running back Ricky Bell (1955–1984), the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 1976, and the number-one pick in the NFL draft in 1977, died at the age of 29 from heart failure caused by this disease.
* Rob Buckman (1948–2011) a doctor, comedian, and author, and the president of the Humanist Association of Canada.
* Samantha, Indian actress diagnosed in 2022.
* Suhani Bhatnagar (2005–2024), Indian actress.
* Tim Rooney (1947-2006), American actor and son of Mickey Rooney.

==Research==
As of 2016, research was ongoing into causes for DM, as well as biomarkers; clinical trials were ongoing for use of the following drugs in DM: ajulemic acid (Phase II), adrenocorticotropic hormone gel (Phase IV, open label), IMO-8400, an antagonist of Toll-like receptor 7,8 and 9 (Ph II), abatacept (Phase IV, open label), and sodium thiosulfate (Phase II).

<doc id="1054255" wikidata="Q840534" url="?curid=1054255" title="Monpa people">
<text>The Monpa ( (;, Chinese: 门巴族) are a major people of Arunachal Pradesh in northeastern India and one of the 56 officially recognized ethnic groups in China. Most Monpas live in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, with a population of 50,000, centered in the districts of Tawang and West Kameng. As of 2020 there were 11,143 Monpa people living in Le/ Lebo/ Lebugou/ Lebugou township of Cona/ Tsona Tsona City in the southern Tibet Autonomous Region, where they are known as Menba (). Of the 45,000 Monpas who live in Arunachal Pradesh, about 20,000 of them live in Tawang district, where they constitute about 97% of the district&#x27;s population, and almost all of the remainder can be found in the West Kameng district, where they form about 77% of the district&#x27;s population. A small number of them may be found in bordering areas of East Kameng and Bhutan (2,500). 

They also share very close affinity with the Sharchops of Bhutan. Their language belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family, but it is significantly different from the Eastern Tibetan dialect. It is written with the Tibetan script.

The Monpa are sub-divided into six sub-groups because of their variations in their language. They are namely: 
* Tawang Monpa
* Dirang Monpa
* Lish Monpa
* Bhut Monpa
* Kalaktang Monpa
* Panchen Monpa

The Tawang Monpas have a migration history from Changrelung. The Monpa are believed to be the only nomadic tribe in Northeast India – they are totally dependent on animals like sheep, cow, yak, goats and horses. There is a village called Le in Tibet, China where Monpa people are also found. The term Monpa is a generic term in China, unlike in India where it refers to a specific tribal group. People of Medog ( Pemako) in China are also called Monpa in China. Therefore, there must be careful study of the Monpa term and its use. The term Monpa is a very generic term and it includes people from all over trans himalayan region and unlike the modern term used to refer to the tribe of Monpa, of Tawang and West Kameng district. The Monpa people in Tibet live in Lebugou, Cona county.

==Name==
Tibetan Buddhists texts present &quot;Monyul&quot; (literally, &quot;low land&quot;) as the territory immediately to the south of Tibet below the Himalayan crest line. Its borders were imprecise, but roughly stretched from eastern Bhutan and western Sikkim to the Tawang area. &quot;Monpa&quot; were the people of Mon and they were distinguished from &quot;Lopa&quot; (also spelt &quot;Lhopa&quot;), who were the wild and intractable tribes of the Assam Himalayan region. In practice, Monpa were people amenable to the proselytising efforts of the Buddhist monks, whereas Lopa were those inimical to them.

In course of time, the various people of the historical &quot;Monyul&quot; came to be called by other names, such as Lepcha for the tribes of Sikkim and Drukpa for the people of Bhutan, but the people of Tawang continued to own the name &quot;Monpa&quot;.

==Distribution==
Most Monpas live in the Indian administered region of Arunachal Pradesh, with a population of around 60,000, centred in the districts of Tawang and West Kameng. About 20,000 live in the Tawang district, where they constitute about 97% of the district&#x27;s population, and almost all of the remainder can be found in West Kameng district, where they form about 77% of the district&#x27;s population. A small number live in East Kameng district.

Around 9,000 Monpas live in Tibet, in Tsona County, Pêlung in Bayi District, and Mêdog County. These places fall completely outside of the Tibetan plateau and south of the Himalayan crest, and as a result have very low altitude, especially Mêdog County, which has a tropical climate unlike the rest of Tibet. 

The Monpa are sub-divided into six sub-groups because of variations in their language. They are namely:
* Tawang Monpa
* Dirang Monpa
* Lish Monpa
* Bhut Monpa
* Kalaktang Monpa
* Panchen Monpa

== History ==
A state of &quot;Lhomon&quot; or &quot;Monyul&quot; is believed to have existed from 500 B.C to 600 A.D. centered in the present day Bhutan. In the 11th century, the Northern Monpas in Tawang came under the influence of the Tibetan Buddhism of the Nyingma and Kagyu denominations. At this time the Monpa adopted the Tibetan alphabet for their language mainly for religious purposes. Drukpa missionaries came to the region in the 13th century, and missionaries of the Gelug school came in the 17th century. The Gelug school is the sect to which most Monpas belong today. The Monpa were never regarded as Tibetan, even though they adopted the Tibetan language and script. 

Around the 14th century, Monyul came under increasing Tibetan political and cultural influence, which was apparent in the years when Tsangyang Gyatso, an ethnic Monpa, became the 6th Dalai Lama. However, Monyul, also known as the Tawang Tract, remained a remote area and sparsely populated until the middle of the 20th century.

Monyul remained an autonomous entity, with local monks based in Tawang holding great political power within the kingdom, and direct rule over the area from Lhasa was established only in the 17th century. From this time until the early 20th century, Monyul was ruled by authorities in Lhasa. One of the first British-Indian travellers into Monyul, Nain Singh Rawat, who visited the area from 1875 to 1876, noted that the Monpa were a conservative people who shunned contact with the outside world and made efforts to monopolise trade with Tibet. In 1914, as part of the negotiations for the Simla Convention, Britain and Tibet negotiated their mutual border roughly along the crest of the Himalayas, which came to be called the McMahon Line. The line divided the land in which the Monpas inhabited, and became a source of contention in subsequent years because of ambiguities in the specific location of the McMahon Line.

== Languages ==
The languages spoken by the Monpa people are often referred to as the &quot;Monpa languages&quot;. This is not a genealogical term, and several quite different languages are subsumed under it. &quot;Monpa languages&quot; include Kho-Bwa, East Bodish, and Tshangla languages. According to Blench (2014), five groups may be distinguished:
* The Sherdukpen, Lish, and Sartang languages show no obvious relationship to other languages of the region and they comprise a small language isolate cluster. These three languages are related to Bugun, and form a &quot;Kho-Bwa&quot; group together with it.
* The Tawang language is an East Bodish language, and is a variety of Dakpa.
* The languages of the Zemithang, Mago and Thingbu villages are additional East Bodish varieties that are not mutually intelligible with Tawang.
* The Tshangla language within Bodish comprises closely related dialects spoken in the villages of Nyukmadung and Lubrang and the Brokpa language spoken by nomads. Other languages include Dirang (also known as &quot;Central Monpa&quot;), Morshing and Kalaktang (also known as &quot;Southern Monpa&quot;).

== Culture ==
The Monpa are known for wood carving, painting, carpet making and weaving. They manufacture paper from the pulp of the local sukso tree. A printing press can be found in the Tawang Monastery, where many religious texts are printed on local paper and wooden blocks, usually meant for literate Monpa Lamas. They are also known for their wooden bowls and bamboo weaving.

All animals except men and tigers are allowed to be hunted. According to tradition, only one individual is allowed to hunt the tiger on an auspicious day, upon the initiation period of the shamans, which can be likened to a trial of passage. After the tiger is killed, the jawbone, along with all its teeth, is used as a magic weapon. It is believed that its power will enable tigers to evoke the power of the guiding spirit of the ancestral tiger, who will accompany and protect the boy along his way.

=== Religion ===
The Monpa are generally adherents of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism, which they adopted in the 17th century as a result of the influence of the Bhutanese-educated Merag Lama. The testimony to this impact was the central role of the Tawang Monastery in the daily lives of the Monpa folk.
In Zemithang the Monpa are adherents of the Nyingmapa strand of Mahayana/Tantrayana-tradition.

===Festivals===

Principal Monpa festivals include the Choskar harvest festival, Losar, and Torgya. During Losar, people generally offer prayers at the Tawang Monastery to pray for the coming of the Tibetan New Year. Pantomime dances are the principal feature of the Ajilamu festival.

Buddhist lamas read religious scriptures in the gompas for a few days during Choskar. Thereafter, the villagers walk around the cultivated fields with sutras on their back. The significance of this festival is to pray for better cultivation and the prosperity of the villagers, and protect the grains from insects and wild animals.

=== Society ===
The traditional society of the Monpa was administered by a council of six ministers locally known as &quot;Trukdri&quot;. The members of this council are known as &quot;Kenpo&quot;, literally the “Abbot”. The Lamas also hold honored positions, two monks known as &quot;Nyetsangs&quot;, and two other &quot;Dzongpen&quot;.

The man is the head of the family and he is the one who makes all decisions. In his absence, his wife takes over all responsibilities. When a child is born, they have no strict preference for a boy or a girl.

=== Lifestyle and dress ===
The traditional dress of the Monpa is based on the Tibetan chuba. Both men and women wear headwear made of yak hair, with long tassels. The women tend to wear a warm jacket and a sleeveless chemise that reaches down to the calves, tying the chemise round the waist with a long and narrow piece of cloth. Ornaments are made of silver, corals and turquoise. Sometimes a person wears a cap with a single peacock feather in a felt hats.

Due to the temperate climate of the eastern Himalayas, the Monpa, like most of the other ethnic groups in the region, construct their houses of stone and wood with plank floors, often accompanied with beautifully carved doors and window frames. The roof is made with bamboo matting, keeping their house warm during the winter season. Sitting platforms and hearths in the living rooms are also found in their houses.

The extreme climatic conditions have an influence on the Monpas food habits and sedentary lifestyle. They intake substantial amount of cheese, salt, and meat with alcohol to cope with extreme cold. The butter tea and locally made distilled liquor from maize, millet, barley, buckwheat or rice, etc. known as Chang, Baang-Chang, Sin-Chang. However, the gradual influx of tourists from other parts of India and with the influence of the western culture among educated younger generation there is a radical changes in the youth&#x27;s diet habits. The commercially processed store-bought foods and fast foods like chips, burgers and samosa, and drinks like cappuccino coffees, and commercial alcohols, are widely prevalent today.

== Economy ==
The Monpa practice shifting and permanent types of cultivation. Cattle, yaks, cows, pigs, sheep and fowl are kept as domestic animals.

To prevent soil erosion from planting crops on hilly slopes, the Monpa have terraced many slopes. Cash crops such as paddy, maize, wheat, barley, millet, buckwheat, peppers, pumpkin and beans are planted.

<doc id="1054258" wikidata="Q7494786" url="?curid=1054258" title="Sherdukpen people">
<text>The Sherdukpen are an ethnic group of Arunachal Pradesh state of India. Their population of 9,663 is centered in West Kameng district in the villages of Rupa, Jigaon, Thongri, Shergaon, to the south of Bomdila. All of these are at elevations between 5000 and 6000 feet above sea level. Of late, some of them have settled in Kameng bari areas, a new settlement area under Bhalukpong circle.

== Society ==

Sherdukpen society is divided into two classes: The Thong and Chao,The thong ( Higher caster) consist of Thongchi,Thongdok and Thongon. the former of which–the higher caste–are divided into eight clans. Marriage between inter-castes are considered taboo within the tribal society and are strongly discouraged. Local legend mentioned that the upper caste are the descendants of a Tibetan king (a grandson of Songtsän Gampo) and Ahom princess, of which they bore two sons. The Chao are the descendants of the king&#x27;s porters and servants. The Sherdukpens migrate to Doimara (a lowland hamlet close to the Assamese border) and stayed between December and March on an annual basis during the winter months, a tradition with which the tribe maintain the memory of their Assamese ancestry. In Doimara, the Sherdukpens mingled with the nearby Assamese natives and traded for rice.

The Sherdukpen generally practice monogamy and trace their descent patrilineally. Their houses are built on strong stone foundations with their wall and floor made from thick wooden planks.

==Language==
The Sherdukpen speak their own language, Sherdukpen, which isn&#x27;t directly related with the neighboring Bugun and Monpa language. It is possibly of Tibeto-Burman derivation.

== Dress ==

The Sherdukpen men wear a sleeveless cloth, which is made out of silk, with the two ends of the cloth which pins onto the shoulders that reach down to the knees. Made from yak&#x27;s hair with tassels jutting down over the face, the gurdam skull-cap is mainly worn by the men. It is decorated with a white cockade and colourful band around its brim. The warriors are often seen carrying their Tibetan sword, with the support of a waistband. A bogre, a cloth woven from natural fibres, is tied around the shoulders to form a fold at the back.

The women wear a collarless and sleeveless cloth to cover them from the shoulders to the knees. A full-sleeved embroidered jacket and waist cloth, known as mushaiks, is worn over the cloak. The ladies tie their hair tied into a bun at the back, although most grown-up girls do not tie their tresses into a knot. Weaving is considered a feminine art, and most women are able to weave different kinds of clothing in a highly artistic manner.

== Religion ==
The Sherdukpen adopted the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism as with their northern neighbours, the Monpa who were also subjected to the evangelical influence of Mera Lama. However, contrary to the Monpas, Sherdukpens are more inclined to their pre-Buddhist Animistic traditions, which is shown by the relative absence of any Buddhist Lamas within their tribe.

Lamas from the Monpa and refugee Tibetan communities were invited to conduct Buddhist communal rituals whenever necessary. The profound Animist influence is attributed to the prevalence of their traditional Shamans with which they also employ for certain religious activities, known as &quot;Jiji&quot; in the local tongue. Rituals pertaining to indigenous spirits, human sacrifice and blood are prevalent within Sherdukpen mythology and legends, which is characteristically absent in Tibetan Buddhism.

<text>William Reuben Applegarth (11 May 1890 – 5 December 1958) was a British track and field athlete and winner of a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1912 Summer Olympics.

== Biography ==
Born in Guisborough, then in the North Riding of Yorkshire, William Applegarth was one of the best European sprinters during World War I.

At the Stockholm Olympics, Applegarth was eliminated in the semifinals of the 100 m competition and won a bronze medal in the 200 m. As the anchoring leg in the British 4 × 100 m relay team, he won a gold medal despite finishing second after the US in the semifinal. The United States was later disqualified for a fault in passing the baton; the same mistake was made in the final by the world record holder and main favourite German team.

Applegarth was a British National AAA champion in at the 1913 AAA Championships and 1914 AAA Championships and was the highest British athlete at the 1912 AAA Championships, finishing behind South African George Patching. Additionally, he was the 220 yards champion from 1912 to 1914.

Shortly after the Olympics, Applegarth repeated Donald Lippincott&#x27;s world record in the 100 m of 10.6 and set a new world record of 21.2 in the 200 m in the 1914 AAA meeting. His 200 m record was not broken until 1928.

In November 1914, Applegarth turned professional and, in 1922, emigrated to America, where he became the track and association football coach at Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania. He also played for Brooklyn in the American Soccer League. In 1925, he retired from sport and began working as a welder at the General Electric Company, where he stayed until 1955. He died aged 68, in the same year his British record of 9.8 s was finally broken.

<doc id="1054266" wikidata="Q25098557" url="?curid=1054266" title="Rifled muzzle loader">
<text>A rifled muzzle loader (RML) is a type of large artillery piece invented in the mid-19th century. In contrast to smooth bore cannon which preceded it, the rifling of the gun barrel allowed much greater accuracy and penetration as the spin induced to the shell gave it directional stability. Typical guns weighed 18 tonnes with 10-inch-diameter bores, and were installed in forts and ships.

This new gun and the rifled breech loader (RBL) generated a huge arms race in the late 19th century, with rapid advances in fortifications and ironclad warships.

==Royal Navy experience==
The largest rifled muzzle-loader carried on a warship was the 17.7-inch, 100-ton Elswick of the 1870s, four of which were installed in each of the Italian battleships &quot;Duilio&quot; and &quot;Enrico Dandolo&quot; (launched in 1872). The Royal Navy at the time was restricted to the weapons produced by Woolwich Arsenal, so that the heaviest guns that could be shipped were the 80-ton 16-inch guns of HMS &quot;Inflexible&quot;.

Introduction of the Armstrong rifled breechloaders (RBL) into the Royal Navy in 1860 was not very successful. The action of Kagosima on 14 August 1863 led to 28 accidents in 365 rounds fired. Following this experience, the Royal Navy reverted to the muzzle-loader until the early 1880s. Other navies, notably France, continued to develop and deploy RBLs, but they were hardly superior in rate of fire or muzzle energy to their British counterparts.

During this period rapid burning black powder was used as the propellant, and the guns had a stubby, &#x27;soda bottle&#x27; shape giving easy access to either end for loading. The RBLs of the time were notably weaker in the breech region, and more prone to failure.

A catastrophic accident on board HMS &quot;Thunderer&quot; in January 1879, in which a 35-ton 12-inch muzzle-loader hung fire (misfired) and was subsequently double-loaded, killing eleven sailors, motivated the Admiralty to re-consider the RBL.

Improvements in breech mechanisms in the period 1860 to 1880, together with the introduction of large-grain powder, caused the Navy to re-adopt the RBL as the new powder required longer barrels which could not be withdrawn into the turret for loading. A new 12-inch gun was developed for HMS &quot;Edinburgh&quot; in 1879, but burst during trials. Following modifications the new weapon proved reliable.

<doc id="1054273" wikidata="Q911160" url="?curid=1054273" title="Ganser syndrome">
<text>Ganser syndrome is a rare dissociative disorder characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions and other dissociative symptoms such as fugue, amnesia or conversion disorder, often with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. The syndrome has also been called &quot;nonsense syndrome&quot;, &quot;balderdash syndrome&quot;, &quot;syndrome of approximate answers&quot;, &quot;hysterical pseudodementia&quot; or &quot;prison psychosis&quot;.

The term prison psychosis is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may be seen as an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials. Psychological symptoms generally resemble the patient&#x27;s sense of mental illness rather than any recognized category. The syndrome may occur in persons with other mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depressive disorders, toxic states, paresis, alcohol use disorders and factitious disorders. Ganser syndrome can sometimes be diagnosed as merely malingering, but it is more often defined as a dissociative disorder.

The identification of Ganser syndrome is attributed to German psychiatrist Sigbert Ganser (1853–1931). In 1898, he described the disorder in prisoners awaiting trial in a penal institution in Halle, Germany. He named impaired consciousness and distorted communication, namely in the form of approximate answers (also referred to as &quot;Vorbeireden&quot; in the literature), as the defining symptoms of the syndrome. Vorbeireden involves the inability to answer questions precisely, although the content of the questions is understood.
Ganser syndrome is described as a dissociative disorder not otherwise specified (DDNOS) in the DSM-IV, and is not currently listed in the DSM-5. It is a rare and an often overlooked clinical phenomenon. In most cases, it is preceded by extreme stress and followed by amnesia for the period of psychosis. In addition to approximate answers, other symptoms include a clouding of consciousness, somatic conversion disorder symptoms, confusion, stress, loss of personal identity, echolalia, and echopraxia.

==Cause==
To date, no definitive cause or reason of the disorder has been established. The sources that classify the syndrome as a dissociative disorder or a factitious disorder conflict in their proposed aetiologies. As a result, there are differing theories as to why the syndrome develops. 
Ganser syndrome was previously classified as a factitious disorder, explaining the symptoms as mimicking of what patients who do not experience psychosis believe is typical of the experience. However, the DSM-IV placed the syndrome under &quot;Dissociative Disorders Not Otherwise Specified&quot;. There has been evidence of a strong correlation between approximate answers and amnesia, suggesting that these have an underlying dissociative mechanism.

Both Ganser&#x27;s syndrome and the broader category of dissociative disorders have been linked to histories of hysteria, psychosis, conversion, multiple personality and possible feigning. Despite this, the condition&#x27;s aetiology remains under question due to associations with established psychiatric disorders, as well as organic states. 
According to Stern and Whiles (1942), Ganser syndrome is a fundamentally psychotic illness. As evidence, they describe the case of a woman with recurrent mania and a head injury before being submitted to treatment and the report of a man with schizophrenia who suffered from alcoholism and had recently been in prison.
Ganser syndrome is also sometimes referred to as &quot;prison psychosis&quot;, emphasizing its prevalence among prisoners, generating discussion about whether the disorder only appears in this population. In a study of prisoners, Estes and New concluded that escaping an intolerable situation, such as being incarcerated, prompted the syndrome&#x27;s key symptoms. The study touched on the malingering controversy surrounding the syndrome, as well as the stress component that often precedes the disorder.
According to consultant psychiatrist F. A. Whitlock, Ganser syndrome is a hysterical disorder, on par with Ganser&#x27;s description of the disorder. Whitlock pointed to the number of cases in which Ganser syndrome was reported in settings of organic brain disease or functional psychosis as evidence of its hysterical foundations. Kraepelin and Bumke also believed the syndrome to be of a hysterical nature. Bumke thought the syndrome hysterical because amnesia for a traumatic emotional event tends to occur in hysteria more than in other disorders. The giving of approximate answers is thought to be produced in hysterical personalities. 
According to Mayer-Gross and Bleuler, Ganser syndrome occurs mainly in epileptic or schizophrenic patients.
Still others claim that an organic condition that could lead to the manifestation of Ganser syndrome symptoms would have to be at an advanced stage in which a diagnosis could be easily given.
There have also been reports of trauma and stroke patients with the syndrome. A study investigating the neurological basis of Ganser syndrome described a patient with symptoms of the disorder who had a history of stroke and bifrontal infarcts. They discovered that hyperglutamatergic states, which are caused by both strokes and stress, share a relationship with dissociative symptoms, suggesting a possible organic pathology that can predispose individuals to the syndrome. Wirtz and colleagues (2008) described a patient with Ganser syndrome after a left-hemispheric middle cerebral artery infarct. A neuropsychological examination revealed atypical lateralisation of cognitive functions, leading to the conclusion that the giving of approximate answers might be related to frontal-executive cerebral dysfunction.

==Diagnosis==
Ganser syndrome was listed under Factitious Disorder with Psychological Symptoms in the DSM-III. The criteria of this category emphasized symptoms that cannot be explained by other mental disorders, psychological symptoms under the control of the individual, and the goal of assuming a patient role, not otherwise understandable given their circumstances. 
The DSM-IV-TR classified Ganser syndrome as a dissociative disorder defined by the giving of approximate answers to questions (e.g. &#x27;2 plus 2 equals 5&#x27; when not associated with dissociative amnesia or dissociative fugue). The ICD-10 and DSM-IV do not specify any diagnostic criteria—apart from approximate answers—as a requirement for a Ganser syndrome diagnosis. Most case studies of the syndrome also depend on the presence of approximate answers and at least one of the other symptoms described by Ganser in his original paper. Usually when giving wrong answers, individuals are only slightly off, showing that the individual understood the question For instance, when asked how many legs a horse has, they might say, &quot;five&quot;. Although subjects appear confused in their answers, in other respects they appear to understand their surroundings. Amnesia, loss of personal identity, and clouding of consciousness were among the most common symptoms apart from approximate answers.
Although there is currently no uniform way to diagnose the syndrome, a full neurological and mental state examination is recommended to determine its presence as well as tests that assess malingering. In addition to mental examination, other investigations should be done to exclude other underlying causes. These include computer tomography scans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to exclude structural pathology, lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis or encephalitis, and electroencephalography (EEG), to exclude delirium or seizure disorder.
Diagnosing Ganser syndrome is challenging because of its rarity and symptom variability. The manifested symptoms may be dependent on the individual&#x27;s conception of what mental illness entails, creating the possibility of a wide range of combinations of symptoms present in an individual with Ganser syndrome.

==Treatment==
In many cases, the symptoms seem to dwindle after a few days, and patients are often left with amnesia for the period of psychosis. Hospitalization may be necessary during the acute phase of symptoms, and psychiatric care if the patient is a danger to self or others. A neurological consult is advised to rule out any organic cause. Psychotherapy may also recommended for ensuring and maintaining safety.
Ganser patients typically recover quickly and completely. Since Ganser syndrome can be a response to psychic deterioration, its resolution may be followed by other psychiatric symptoms, such as schizophrenia and depression, hence the rationale behind the recommendation of psychotherapy. Medication is usually not required.

==Epidemiology==
Reviewing multiple collections of case studies, the incidence of the disorder is not precisely known. Individuals of multiple backgrounds have been reported as having the disorder. The syndrome was historically thought to be more common in men. However, Whitlock speculates that the higher reported rate of Ganser in men might be due to the greater proportion of men who are incarcerated. It has been most frequently seen in individuals ages 15 to 40 and has also been observed in children. This wide age range is derived from case studies, and therefore may not be an accurate estimate. Ganser syndrome has also been observed in groups other than prison populations.

==Controversy==
There is controversy regarding whether Ganser syndrome is a valid clinical entity. For example, Bromberg (1986) has argued that the syndrome is not due to or related to mental illness, but rather a sort of defense against legal punishment. Some see it as conscious lying, denial and repression, presenting Ganser syndrome symptoms as malingering instead of a dissociative or factitious disorder.
One case study of Ganser syndrome presented a middle-aged man who had been in a car crash and wanted disability insurance benefits. Since he had a big incentive, psychologists took careful measures and implemented testing with malingering instruments, which showed that the man performed below chance on simple memory tests and claimed to experience non-existent symptoms. Upon further inspection of the collateral information, they found that the patient took part in high-level sports and other activities that were inconsistent with the cognitive dysfunctions he reported, and they determined it to be a case of malingering.
Estes and New (1948) concluded that the motivation for the symptoms of the syndrome was escaping an &quot;intolerable situation&quot;. Stern and Whiles proposed an alternative explanation, citing Ganser syndrome presented itself in individuals who, although not psychologically well, do not realize it, and want to appear so. Still others attribute the syndrome to inattention, purposeful evasion, suppression, alcoholic excess, head injury, and to unconscious attempts to deceive others as a means to free themselves from responsibility for their actions. This denial of behaviour can be seen as a way to overcome anxiety and helplessness brought on by the stressful event that often precedes the syndrome.
These aetiological debates focus on the main symptom of Ganser syndrome and its importance in its diagnosis. Approximate answers are prominent in the Ganser syndrome literature, causing concern in those who believe that this is a relatively simple symptom to feign.
Ganser syndrome was regarded as an Adjustment Reaction of Adult Life in the DSM-II and later was moved under the category of Factitious Disorder with Psychological Symptoms in the DSM-III. Ganser syndrome can also be found under the Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DDNOS) section of the DSM-IV-TR, however it is not listed in the DSM-5, which got rid of the DDNOS section and replaced it with Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD) and Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (USDD). Despite this, the International Classification of Diseases has Ganser syndrome listed under dissociative disorders.

<text>Louise Perkins Fitzhugh (October 5, 1928 – November 19, 1974) was an American writer and illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Fitzhugh is best known for her 1964 novel &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;, a fiction work about an adolescent girl&#x27;s predisposition to covering with a journal the foibles of her friends, her classmates, and the strangers she is captivated by. The novel was later adapted into a live action film in 1996. The sequel novel, &quot;The Long Secret&quot;, was published in 1965, and its follow-up book, &quot;Sport&quot;, was published posthumously in 1979. Fitzhugh also wrote &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Family Is Going to Change&quot;, which was later adapted into a short film and a play.

Fitzhugh died at age 46 from a brain aneurysm on November 19, 1974.

== Early life and family ==
Louise Fitzhugh was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on October 5, 1928 as the only child of Louise and Millsaps Fitzhugh, a lawyer. Her father came from a wealthy family in Memphis, and she is a descendant of Reuben Millsaps, the founder of Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi. He graduated from Emory University and met Louise Perkins, an aspiring tap dancer, in 1926 on a boat traveling from New York to England. They married, but his family disapproved of the marriage due to her lower social standing and they divorced after a year, shortly following Fitzhugh&#x27;s birth in 1928. Her father gained custody of her after a publicized legal battle while her mother moved to Hollywood. She grew up in Memphis with her father and stepmother, Sally Taylor, and was told that her mother was dead. Her father went on to become a U.S. district attorney. When Fitzhugh was a teenager, she discovered the truth while working at the Memphis newspaper, &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; and finding coverage of the divorce proceedings in the archive. She began writing at the age of 11. 

She graduated in 1946 from Miss Hutchison&#x27;s School where she had been popular, but felt out of place as a debutante in upper-class society, and was appalled by her peers&#x27; racist attitudes. Fitzhugh had a series of romantic relationships as teenager, beginning with a boy named Charles McNutt. After dating for two years, she fell in love with a photojournalist named Amelia Brent, her first love affair with another woman. While still seeing Amelia, she also dated a local boy named Ed Thompson, and eloped with him in 1947, at the age of nineteen. The marriage went unconsummated and her father had it annulled from Memphis.

== Education ==
Fitzhugh briefly attended Southwestern College (now Rhodes College) after graduating from Miss Hutchison&#x27;s, and transferred to Florida Southern College in 1947. In 1948, she transferred again, this time to Bard College, after her uncle, novelist Peter Taylor, recommended its writing program. She studied child psychology and literature under poet James Merrill at Bard, but left in 1951, six months before her graduation.

Using money inherited after her grandmother&#x27;s death in 1949, Fitzhugh moved to New York City to study art. She lived in Greenwich Village and studied at the Art Students League and Cooper Union starting in 1952. She also traveled to study art in France in 1954, and Bologna in 1957.

== Career ==
In 1961, Fitzhugh published her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Suzuki Beane&quot;, coauthored with Sandra Scoppettone, which was a parody of &quot;Eloise&quot;; while Eloise lived in the Plaza Hotel, Suzuki was the daughter of beatnik parents and slept on a mattress on the floor of a Bleecker Street pad in Greenwich Village. Fitzhugh worked closely with Scoppettone on the production of the book, which incorporated typewriter font and line drawings in an original way. Although a parody of both &quot;Eloise&quot; and beatnik conceit, the book sprang to life as a genuine work of literature and was immediately popular with both adults and children. 

Fitzhugh continued to be a successful painter in New York, showing her work, primarily realistic portraits, nudes, and city scenes, alongside artists like Jacob Lawrence, Ad Reinhardt, and Louise Nevelson. She had a particularly successful solo exhibition at Banfer Gallery in 1963, but also wrote prolifically, penning several plays and adult novels that were never published. Around this time, Fitzhugh attempted to publish &quot;Amelia,&quot; a novel about two teenage girls falling in love, in remembrance of her first love Amelia Brent, who had died apparently by suicide in 1956. The manuscript was rejected by an agent for its lesbian subject matter, and later disappeared.

=== &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot; ===
After the success of &quot;Suzuki Beane&quot;, Fitzhugh began working with editors Ursula Nordstrom and Charlotte Zolotow, who helped publish her most successful work, &quot;Harriet the Spy,&quot; through Harper and Row. It was published in 1964 to some controversy, since its characters were flawed and engaged in behavior that many felt weren&#x27;t suitable for children. Although it received many negative reviews at the time of its publication, It was hugely popular with young girls, and has since become a classic. It is also considered a milestone book for introducing &quot;a new realism to children&#x27;s fiction. Harriet is the daughter of affluent New Yorkers who leave her in the care of her nanny, Ole Golly, in their Manhattan townhouse. A curious and solitary child, she spends her time spying on other people, often her friends and neighbors, recording her cynical and bluntly rude observations in a notebook. 

The book has been adapted three times, starting in 1996 with a film starring Michelle Trachtenberg and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. In 2010, it was adapted as the Disney movie, &quot;Harriet the Spy: Blog Wars&quot; and in 2021 as an animated series by Apple TV+ starring Beanie Feldstein.

The book and Harriet&#x27;s tomboyish character is often linked to Fitzhugh&#x27;s identity as a lesbian despite a lack of direct references to homosexuality. The character was based on Marijane Meaker as well as some of Fitzhugh&#x27;s own experiences. Irene Zahava dedicated &quot;The Second Womansleuth Anthology&quot; to Harriet and fictional lesbian detective characters created by Elizabeth Pincus and Bonnie Morris cite Harriet as a childhood influence. 

She wrote two other books in the same universe, &quot;The Long Secret&quot; and &quot;Sport.&quot;

=== Posthumous publications and adaptations ===
Several of Fitzhugh&#x27;s books were published posthumously, including &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Family is Going to Change,&quot; published eight days after her death in 1974. &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Family Is Going to Change&quot; was adapted into the short film &quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot; for &quot;Special Treat&quot; in 1978. It was also adapted into the 1983 Tony-nominated musical &quot;The Tap Dance Kid&quot;.

Other posthumous publications included &quot;Sport&quot; (1979), &quot;I Am Five&quot; (1978)&quot;, I am Four&quot; (1982)&quot;,&quot; and &quot;I Am Three&quot; (1982). According to her biographer, Virginia L. Wolf, Fitzhugh had left two adult fiction works at the time of her death, an unfinished novel, &quot;Crazybaby,&quot; and a completed play, &quot;Mother Sweet, Father Sweet.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Fitzhugh was a lesbian. Fitzhugh was romantically linked to actress Constance Ford, casting director Alixe Gordin, and her &quot;Suzuki Beane&quot; collaborator, Sandra Scoppettone.

== Death ==
Fitzhugh died on November 19, 1974, at a New Milford, Connecticut hospital of a brain aneurysm.

<text>The World Food Prize is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity, or availability of food in the world. Conceived by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Norman Borlaug and established in 1986 through the support of General Foods, the prize is envisioned and promoted as the Nobel or the highest honors in the field of food and agriculture. It is now administered by the World Food Prize Foundation with support from numerous sponsors. Since 1987, the prize has been awarded annually to recognize contributions in any field involved in the world food supply, such as animal science, aquaculture, soil science, water conservation, nutrition, health, plant science, seed science, plant pathology, crop protection, food technology, food safety, policy, research, infrastructure, emergency relief, and poverty alleviation and hunger.

Laureates are honored and officially awarded their prize in Des Moines, Iowa, in an award ceremony held at Iowa State Capitol. Laureates are presented with a diploma, a commemorative sculpture designed by Saul Bass and a monetary award of $500,000. The Foundation also has the aim of &quot;inspiring exceptional achievement in assuring adequate food and nutrition for all&quot;. A number of associated events and honors include the World Food Prize Symposium or the Borlaug Dialogue, the Iowa Hunger Summit and youth programs such as the Borlaug-Ruan International Internships.

==History==
Norman Borlaug (1914–2009) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for contributions that resulted in the extensive increase in global food production. Chairperson of the Nobel Committee Aase Lionæs gave the rationale that the committee had linked providing much needed food to the world as a path for peace. Further, the increase in food production has given policy planners across the world more years in figuring out how to feed the growing population. 12 years later, Borlaug approached the Nobel Foundation to include a prize for food and agriculture. However, the Foundation was bound by Alfred Nobel&#x27;s will which did not allow for the creation of such a new prize. Borlaug continued his search for a sponsor elsewhere.

In 1986, General Foods Corporation, under Vice President A. S. Clausi&#x27;s leadership, agreed to establish the prize and be the founding sponsor. The amount they agreed to, US$200,000, was equivalent to the value of the Nobel Prizes at the time. In 1990, the sponsorship was taken over by businessman and philanthropist John Ruan and his family. The Ruan family established the World Food Prize Foundation backed by an endowment of $10 million. In 2000, Kenneth M. Quinn was made the president. Borlaug, Ruan, and Quinn were all from the US state of Iowa. Barbara Stinson succeeded Quinn as the second president in 2019.

The former Des Moines Library was acquired and the Ruan family gave $5 million to renovate the building into the headquarters for the World Food Prize Foundation. A number of sponsors would go on to contribute over US$20 million in a campaign to transform the building into a public museum, the Hall of Laureates, to honor Borlaug and the work of the World Food Prize laureates. Other sponsors have included over 100 charitable foundations, corporations and individuals, who have helped sustain the prize and the Foundation&#x27;s associated events. The Founder&#x27;s Boardroom in the Hall of Laureates commemorates 27 individuals who played an important part in the foundation of the prize.

The first chairperson of the World Food Prize laureate selection committee was Norman Borlaug. Borlaug appointed the first laureate M. S. Swaminathan as his successor in 2009. Currently, Gebisa Ejeta, the 2009 laureate, is the chairperson. Apart from the chairperson who is a non-voting member, other members of the selection committee remain anonymous.

On January 24, 2023, the Foundation announced that former Iowa Governor and U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad would take over as president, replacing outgoing former president Barbara Stinson.

== Laureates ==
World Food Prize laureates include the following:


== Associated events ==
The Foundation has expanded into a number of associated events including the Norman E. Borlaug International Symposium, also known as the World Food Prize Symposium or the Borlaug Dialogue. A Youth Institute was established in 1994 to motivate youngsters in agriculture, food, population and connected sciences. Youth Institutes have been set up in 24 states of the United States, and three other countries. based on essays, high school students are selected to take part in the activities of these institutes. Participation in these institutes also makes one eligible for an eight-week internship program.

The Borlaug-Ruan International Internship provides high school students an eight-week opportunity for a hands-on experience, working with scientists and policymakers in hunger and nutrition at research centres around the world. The internship was founded in 1998 and has funded over 350 Borlaug-Ruan interns who have travelled to 34 agricultural research centres around the world. The Iowa Hunger Summit has taken place during the week of the World Food Prize events since 2007. The event is open to the public and celebrates the role Iowans play in fighting hunger and advancing food security each year.

<text>Golden is a town in southeastern British Columbia, Canada, west of Calgary, Alberta, and east of Vancouver.

==History==
In 1807, David Thompsonrenowned fur trader, surveyor, and map makerwas tasked by the North West Company to open a trading route to the lucrative trading territories of the Pacific Northwest. He first crossed over the Rocky Mountains and travelled along the Blaeberry River to the future site of Golden.

In 1881, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) hired surveyor A. B. Rogers to find a rail route through the Selkirk and Rocky Mountains, and in 1882, he found the pass now named for him. Rogers established a base camp for his survey crew led by a man named McMillan. Initially known as McMillan&#x27;s Camp, the settlement was the beginning of the town of Golden. By 1884, in response to a nearby lumber camp naming itself Silver City, the residents of McMillan&#x27;s Camp, headed by Baptiste Morigeau, decided not to be outdone and renamed the settlement Golden City. The word &quot;city&quot; was later dropped.

In the late 1890s, the CPR began importing Swiss mountain guides to assist travellers attracted to the area to explore the surrounding mountains, Glacier National Park, Yoho National Park and the Rogers Pass region, as part of their efforts to promote tourism to the mountain parks area. The railway built a group of chalet-style house in a section that became known as Edelweiss, some of them still standing, to encourage the guide to bring their families to Canada and remain year-round. The men made many of the first ascents of area mountains and helped pioneer the ski industry in the region. 

Golden is also the site of notable South Asian Canadian history, after Sikh settlers first arrived in Golden in 1902 to work at the Columbia River Lumber Company. These early settlers built the first (Sikh temple) in North America in 1905, which burned down in 1926.

Much of the town&#x27;s history is tied into the CPR and the logging industry. The town&#x27;s economy still relies heavily on those two influences, but the development of Kicking Horse Mountain Resort, along with other outdoor adventure companies, has allowed the town to diversify into tourism. Mount 7, which is just southeast of town, is also an outdoor activity destination. The town forms part of the Golden Triangle cycle route.

Kicking Horse Pedestrian Bridge is the longest freestanding timber-framed bridge in Canada. Planned as a community project by the Timber Framers Guild, volunteers from Golden were joined by carpenters and timber framers from the United States and from Europe. The bridge structure is long, with a Burr arch structure. The bridge was completed in September 2001.

In June 2021, the Golden Skybridge opened. The bridge is the highest suspension bridge in Canada.

The Golden meteorites fell there on October 4, 2021.

==Geography==
Golden is nestled in the Rocky Mountain Trench, built around the confluence of the Columbia and Kicking Horse rivers, surrounded by three different mountain ranges (most notably the Purcell Mountains and Rocky Mountains) and five national parks: Yoho National Park, Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, Glacier National Park, and Kootenay National Park.

Golden is on Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway), and it is the northern terminus of Highway 95, connecting it to the United States via the rest of the East Kootenay region and the city of Cranbrook, British Columbia (B.C. Highway 95 is a continuation of U.S. Route 95, which runs north-to-south through the U.S. and into Mexico). The Trans-Canada Highway east of Golden has numerous upgrade projects ongoing to greatly improve the roadway west of the Yoho National Park boundary. The Ten Mile Hill section of the project was recently completed and is a major upgrade to the old highway.

<text>A rifled breech loader (RBL) is an artillery piece which, unlike the smoothbore cannon and rifled muzzle loader which preceded it, has rifling in the barrel and is loaded from the breech at the rear of the gun.

The spin imparted by the gun&#x27;s rifling gives projectiles directional stability and increased range. Loading from the rear of the gun leaves the crew less exposed to enemy fire, allows smaller gun emplacements or turrets, and allows a faster rate of fire.

These rapidly improving breech systems and the powerful new guns they facilitated led to an arms race in fortification and ironclad warship design that led to the battleship class of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and continued until the start of World War I.

==Overview==
The major problem to be solved with breechloading artillery was obturation: the sealing of the breech after firing to ensure that none of the gases generated by the burning of the propellant (initially gunpowder) escaped rearwards through the breech. This was both a safety issue and one of gun performance – all the propellant gas was needed to accelerate the projectile along the barrel.

The second problem was speed of operation – how to close the breech before firing and open it after firing as quickly as possible consistent with safety.

Two solutions were developed more or less in parallel, the &quot;screw breech&quot; block and &quot;sliding wedge&quot; or &quot;sliding block&quot;.
At the time of development of the first modern breechloaders in the mid-19th century, gunpowder propellant charges for artillery were typically loaded in cloth bags, which combusted totally on firing. Hence, unlike with a metal rifle cartridge, the breech mechanism itself somehow needed to provide obturation.

The early &quot;screw&quot; mechanisms for sealing the breech consisted of threaded blocks which were screwed tightly into the breech after loading, but the threads themselves were insufficient to provide a gas-tight seal. This was further complicated by the need to screw and unscrew the breech as quickly as possible; this was met by the &quot;interrupted thread&quot; breech block, where the block circumference was alternately threaded and left unthreaded at a slightly smaller diameter to allow the whole block to be fully inserted and rotated a fraction to lock it. Hence if the block circumference was divided into two sets of threads and gaps, the block only needed to be rotated ¼ turn to lock it instead of several turns. The tradeoff was that only ½ the block&#x27;s circumference was threaded, reducing the security accordingly.

The other possibility of sealing the breech was to enclose the propellant charge in a metal cartridge case which expanded on firing and hence sealed the breech, leaving the breech-block merely needing to lock the cartridge case in place. This was more easily accomplished by sliding the block in behind the cartridge case through a vertical or horizontal slot cut through the rear of the breech : the &quot;sliding wedge&quot; or &quot;sliding block&quot; breech.

==History==

===Early breechloaders===

The very first cannons of the Middle Ages were breech loaded, with gunpowder and shot contained in pots dropped at the back of the barrel, but the poor seals made them dangerous, and they wore quickly and could not be scaled to larger weapons. Until the 19th century, mainly muzzle-loaders were used.

In 1837, Martin von Wahrendorff patented a design for a breech-loader with a cylindrical breech plug secured by a horizontal wedge; it was adopted by Sweden in 1854. Independently, Giovanni Cavalli first proposed a breech-loader gun in 1832 to the Sardinian Army, and first tested such a gun in 1845.

===Armstrong screw breech===

Advances in metallurgy in the industrial era allowed for the construction of rifled breech-loading guns that could fire at a much greater muzzle velocity. After the British artillery was shown up in the Crimean War as having barely changed since the Napoleonic Wars the industrialist William Armstrong was awarded a contract by the government to design a new piece of artillery. Production started in 1855 at the Elswick Ordnance Company and the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich.

His &quot;Armstrong screw&quot; breech involved loading the shell and gunpowder propellant charge in a cloth bag through the hollow breech screw, lowering a heavy block into a slot behind the powder chamber and screwing the breech screw tightly against the block to lock it in place. A degree of obturation was achieved via a cup on the face of the block being forced into a recessed ring on the chamber face. The system was in effect a vertical sliding block such as later used by Krupp in both horizontal and vertical form, with the crucial difference that Armstrong failed to make the progression to loading the powder charge in a metal cartridge, with the result that complete obturation was impossible.
Whatever obturation that was achieved relied on manual labour rather than the power of the gun&#x27;s firing, and was hence both uncertain, based on an unsound principle and unsuited to large guns. Armstrong screw-breech guns were initially adopted by the British Army and Royal Navy, but concerns about limited armour penetration of the shells due to limited maximum velocity, safety concerns with the breech blocks blowing out of guns, and higher skill levels demanded of gunners led the British Government to revert to rifled muzzle-loaders from 1865 to 1880, when Britain finally deployed reliable screw breech mechanisms.

The Imperial Japanese Army used Armstrong cannon during the Boshin War to devastate the Aizu castle town and force its inhabitants to surrender quickly, and British Armstrong light field guns proved deadly against Chinese forces in the Second Opium War. However, the British Army and Navy preferred to revert to muzzle-loaders until larger high-powered breech-loaders with secure obturation systems that were relatively simple to operate were developed.

===Broadwell ring===

American engineer Lewis Wells Broadwell who worked as sales agent for the Gatling Gun Company in Europe replaced a papier-mache obturating cup in bag-loaded RBLs with a metallic gas ring and patented his invention in 1861, later perfecting it in 1864 and 1866; most countries paid royalties to Broadwell for the design, but in Germany the Krupp company stole it and used it for free.
===French efforts===

In the meantime the French persevered with trying to develop breechloaders which combined faster loading than muzzle-loaders, high power, safety and solved the problem of obturation. The Lahitolle 95 mm cannon of 1875 with an interrupted screw breech met the first three requirements to a great extent and partially solved the obturation problem.

Finally the de Bange system introduced in 1877 solved the obturation problem with an asbestos pad impregnated with grease which expanded and sealed the breech on firing. The de Bange system formed the obturation system for all subsequent screw breeches to the present day. Britain adopted the de Bange breech when it returned to breechloaders in the early 1880s after some initial experiments with the inferior &quot;Armstrong cup&quot; obturation system.

Britain, France, and the United States preferred screw breeches for most calibres, but the major drawback of the de Bange interrupted screw as first implemented was that only half of the circumference of the breech block could be threaded, and hence it needed to be fairly long to achieve safe locking of the breech, which required three separate motions to open after firing; rotate to unscrew, retract the screw and swing to the side. Loading required the 3 operations in reverse. This was hence termed a &quot;three motion block&quot; and was slow to operate.

===Welin breech block===
While working as a weapons designer for Thorsten Nordenfelt in London, Axel Welin solved this problem in 1889–1890 with his stepped interrupted screw Welin breech block. This had threads in sets of steps of increasing diameter so that instead of only half of the screw being threaded, the fraction threaded was number of steps / (1 + number of steps): i.e. if the block of a large gun had four steps of threads, 80% of the screw was threaded, allowing a much shorter screw and hence breech block. This allowed the block to be unscrewed and swung out in two motions – the &quot;two motion interrupted screw&quot; breech.
===Bofors ogival screw===

Also in the early 1890s, Arent Silfversparre of Bofors invented an ogival screw breech, similar to the Armstrong model in the way it eliminated the need to withdraw the screw before swinging it to the side. Bofors continued to use this in medium artillery into the 20th century. The Elswick conical screw breech is very similar in concept.

===The sliding block===

The German company Krupp in contrast, adopted &quot;Horizontal sliding block&quot; breeches, rather than screw breeches, for all artillery calibres up to naval guns. This was similar in some ways to the original &quot;Armstrong screw&quot;; the shot and powder cartridge were inserted through the open rear end of the breech into the gun bore, and a steel block was slid home into a horizontal slot cut through the breech to close the rear end of the breech.

However, unlike Armstrong, Krupp loaded the powder propellant in a metal cartridge case much like a large rifle cartridge, which expanded against the chamber wall on firing and effectively sealed the breech. The sliding block, in both horizontal and vertical forms, and metal cartridge case continued to be the preferred German breech system until after World War II (e.g. 7.5 cm Pak 40), and is still used by some modern artillery.

===Quickfiring guns===
The first quick-firing light gun was the 1-inch Nordenfelt gun, built in Britain from 1880. The gun was expressly designed to defend larger warships against the new small fast-moving torpedo boats in the late 1870s to the early 1880s and was an enlarged version of the successful rifle-calibre Nordenfelt hand-cranked &quot;machine gun&quot; designed by Helge Palmcrantz. The gun fired a solid steel bullet with hardened tip and brass jacket.

It was superseded for anti-torpedo boat defence in the mid-1880s by the new generation of Hotchkiss and Nordenfelt &quot;QF&quot; guns of 47-mm and 57-mm calibre firing exploding &quot;common pointed&quot; shells weighing .

The French firm Hotchkiss produced the QF 3 pounder as a light 47-mm naval gun from 1886. The gun was ideal for defending against small fast vessels such as torpedo boats and was immediately adopted by the RN as the &quot;Ordnance QF 3 pounder Hotchkiss&quot;. It was built under licence by Elswick Ordnance Company.

Both the Hotchkiss and Nordenfelt guns loaded ammunition as a single cartridge with projectile, cartridge case and primer in a single unit. The cartridge case sealed the breech on firing and a vertical sliding wedge (block) locked it in place. These new guns incorporated recoil control devices which facilitated consistency of aim, allowed single-motion loading and could be fired as soon as the cartridge was inserted, and then ejected it after firing, these properties denoting a &quot;quick-firing&quot; gun. This set a new standard for artillery, and made firing cycles measured in seconds rather than minutes possible.

Britain used brass cartridge cases for all calibres up to 6 inches in the late 1880s and early 1890s. However, British-designed quickfiring (&quot;QF&quot; in British terminology, which became synonymous with charges in metal cartridge cases) continued to use screw breech blocks, but with their function merely to lock the cartridge in place rather than provide obturation. The powerful backward force generated by 6-inch QF guns still required a strongly seated breech screw with as much thread as possible. However, a basic interrupted-thread screw sufficiently long enough to have enough thread to secure the cartridge on firing still required three separate motions to operate – rotate, withdraw, swing aside after firing, and repeated in reverse before firing.
Elswick Ordnance Company (Armstrong&#x27;s ordnance arm) developed a coned version of the interrupted-thread screw, with a decreasing rather than constant diameter towards the front. This eliminated the second &quot;withdrawal&quot; motion, with just two motions now necessary, rotate and swing aside. This proved short-lived, with Britain adopting charges in bags using the Welin stepped interrupted screw for all guns and up within several years of it becoming available.

<doc id="1054296" wikidata="Q6268789" url="?curid=1054296" title="Johnstown Inclined Plane">
<text>The Johnstown Inclined Plane is a funicular in Johnstown, Cambria County, Pennsylvania, U.S. The incline and its two stations connect the city of Johnstown, situated in a valley at the confluence of the Stonycreek and the Little Conemaugh rivers, to the borough of Westmont on Yoder Hill. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s steepest vehicular inclined plane&quot;. It can carry automobiles and passengers, up or down a slope with a grade of 71.9%. The travel time between stations is 90 seconds.

After a catastrophic flood in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was completed in 1891 to serve as an escape route from floods in the valley, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for residents of the new communities above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. The incline was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated.

Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floods—once in 1936 and again in 1977. The incline was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994. It had major renovations in 1962 and from 1983 to 1984. It closed for a further renovation in 2021.

== Design ==
The Johnstown Inclined Plane was designed by Hungarian-American engineer Samuel Diescher, who had also designed the Duquesne, Castle Shannon and Fort Pitt Inclines in Pittsburgh. The funicular consists of a parallel set of broad gauge railroad tracks with a 70.9% grade or an angle of 35 degrees and 28 minutes from the horizontal. The incline is long and ascends vertically to the top of Yoder Hill and the borough of Westmont, the station of which is at an elevation of above sea level.

The rails are supported by 720  railroad ties made from Southern Yellow Pine. The incline is illuminated at night by 114 high-pressure sodium-vapor lamps mounted along the sides of tracks. There was a stairway between the tracks with 966 steps; this was removed .

Two cars traverse the slope; as one descends, the other ascends and acts as a counterweight. The cars are wide, tall, and long, and are large enough to carry either 65 people, 6 motorcycles, or an automobile. While the cars are open to the elements, an enclosed seating area with a bench is situated along the outer side of the incline. The cables connecting the cars are , 6×36 right regular lay, steel wire rope. They are wound around a , drum that connects the cars. The cable on the north track is long, while the south cable is shorter. Each car weighs , but they and the cables can carry an additional load of . A electric motor drives the drum, simultaneously winding and unwinding the cable, to propel the incline. The Johnstown Inclined Plane is unusual in that the motor and winch are located at a 90-degree angle to the incline instead of directly underneath it. Operation of the incline is controlled via a foot pedal located in a booth in the upper station.

An emergency brake engages if the air pressure needed to control the incline is insufficient; the brake also engages if a dead man&#x27;s switch is tripped in the operator&#x27;s booth. In addition to the hauling cables, a safety cable capable of withstanding is also connected to the cars.

== History ==
=== Background and construction ===
Inclines are common in Europe, and immigrants, like the German, Slavic, and Welsh people who settled near Johnstown, remembered them from their native lands and brought the concept to the United States. The earliest inclines in the United States were a series of 10 that were built in the 1830s as part of the Allegheny Portage Railroad. The portage railroad carried canal boats over the Allegheny Mountains to connect the canals from Pittsburgh to the ones from Philadelphia. Pittsburgh at one time also had &quot;at least 17&quot; inclines—some carried passengers, others freight, while another two inclines (like the Nunnery Hill Incline) were curved.

On May 31, 1889, the South Fork Dam collapsed upstream of Johnstown on the Little Conemaugh River. The resulting deluge devastated the city, killing 2,209 people. As the city rebuilt, the Cambria Iron Company started work on a residential development atop Yoder Hill. To provide easy transportation on the steep slope for residents of the new community of Westmont, the company constructed an inclined plane. In addition to being a convenient mode of transportation, the Johnstown Inclined Plane doubled as an escape route in event of flood. Diescher was hired by Cambria Iron to design the incline. The rails used in the incline were manufactured in Johnstown at Cambria Iron, and many of the construction tools handcrafted there. The Inclined Plane Bridge was built to span the Stoneycreek River to provide access to the lower station of the incline. Originally named the Cambria Inclined Plane, the Johnstown Inclined Plane opened on June 1, 1891, and cost $133,296 to build. 

=== 1890s to 1960s ===
The convenience the incline provided stimulated a rapid growth of population in Westmont and made the borough one of the country&#x27;s first suburbs. Over 40 million trips were taken on the incline in its first 80 years of operation. The incline&#x27;s original steam engine was disconnected on January 6, 1912, and replaced with an electric motor. The cars used on the incline were originally double-deckers, but were reconfigured into a single-decker design in 1921. The double-decker cars had horses and wagons riding on the main, upper deck and passengers riding in a compartment below. Only one human fatality has occurred at the incline; it was determined that the incident was not caused by the incline itself. There were two incidents in the 1920s when horses aboard the incline became spooked and leapt from the car onto the tracks. Bethlehem Steel, the successor to Cambria Iron, sold the Johnstown Inclined Plane to the borough of Westmont in April 1935. 

On March 17, 1936, nearly 4,000 people were evacuated from Johnstown to higher ground via the incline as the Stoneycreek and Conemaugh Rivers overflowed their banks. The floodwaters continued downstream and eventually reached Pittsburgh. From February 1938 to July 1953, the Johnstown Traction Company operated transit buses from Johnstown to Westmont with the &quot;fully loaded public buses&quot; being carried by the incline. Bethlehem Steel stopped supplying electricity to the Johnstown Inclined Plane when the factory switched to &quot;an incompatible power system&quot;, forcing the incline to close on January 31, 1962. Because of public pressure to keep the incline operating, it was reopened in July 1962 after extensive renovation, in which the electric motor was rewound, ties were replaced, and the cars were repainted.

=== 1970s to 2010s ===

The Johnstown Inclined Plane was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 18, 1973. On July 20, 1977, during the Johnstown flood of 1977, the incline was again used as an escape route, evacuating 1,500 residents from the valley to Westmont, Pennsylvania. It also carried &quot;boats, emergency personnel, and equipment down to the valley to aid in rescue operations&quot;. The incline was closed for repairs in January 1983, at which point the renovation was planned to cost $1.7million. The incline was again sold for $1 by Westmont borough on March 8, 1983, to the Cambria County Transit Authority, now CamTran. CamTran initiated a $4.2 million renovation on September 7, 1983, replacing steel, foundation piers and track. The federal government funded 80% of the renovation, while the local government provided the remainder. The renovations were completed on August 22, 1984, and the incline was rededicated on September 6. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; wrote at the time: &quot;For Johnstown, the incline has, in more ways than one, provided a lift.&quot;

The incline was designated an Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in September 1994. A footbridge spanning Pennsylvania Route 56 between the incline and Vine Street was opened around the same time. On September 1, 2000, the incline was closed when the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) undertook an $2.3 million renovation of the bridge and its access road. It was reopened in April 2001, but again closed in September to allow PennDOT to finish repairs to the bridge deck. The repairs were completed on December 14, 2001. A strong thunderstorm disrupted power to the incline on April 16, 2010, stranding the cars and two passengers almost halfway down the slope. The rescue took three hours, and ended when firefighters rappelled down the tracks to reach the car. 

The Johnstown Inclined Plane was closed from September 9 to October 14, 2010, for the installation of a new &quot;hoist brake shaft.&quot; From October 29 to 31, 2012, CamTran shut down the incline fearing power outages due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy. During the annual Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally, two resistors failed and stopped the incline near the stations on June 28, 2014. Repairs took approximately a month after consultants diagnosed the failure. Sensor issues briefly disrupted service in August 2014, and again in December 2014, forcing the incline to start its winter maintenance period early. In addition, the firm NexGen was hired in 2015 to refurbish the incline&#x27;s cars for $3.7 million.

=== 2020s refurbishment ===

In 2021, the incline closed for a renovation, which was expected to cost more than $12 million. The refurbishment included restoration of the cars, a complete overhaul of the mechanical and electrical systems, and replacement of all the track ties. The project was funded by a variety of state and federal grants—including a $24.4 million grant from the federal government—and donations from local foundations. By July 2022, the incline&#x27;s ties had been replaced, a drainage system had been added, and vegetation had been planted around the incline.

Though the project was supposed to be completed in early 2023, the renovation stalled after work was 92 percent complete. Local TV station WJAC-TV reported in May 2023 that the incline&#x27;s reopening had delayed due to issues in completing and delivering the sheave wheels, to which the cables are attached. After further issues arose that November, CamTran halted the renovation entirely in January 2024. The sheave wheels had to be remade after they were delivered. In addition, officials discovered damage to one of the cables, and the incline needed to be inspected and recertified before it could reopen. In May 2024, CamTran awarded three contracts for the renovation of the incline&#x27;s visitor center, its observation deck, and a footbridge at the bottom of the incline. Due to the continued delays, CamTran declined to review bids for replacement cables that September, as the cables were not ready to be installed. Work resumed in December 2024 after CamTran finished investigating the cable damage; at the time, the incline was scheduled to reopen in 2025.

== Current operations ==

With the growing usage of the automobile and construction of new roads, ridership on the incline diminished. It was losing $25,000 a year by 1961. Since the 1980s, the incline has become one of the main tourist attractions in Johnstown, with people visiting the incline to &quot;ride for fun, nostalgia and novelty.&quot; Primarily used for tourism, the incline&#x27;s use by commuters, who bike or walk to work, has also increased. CamTran&#x27;s Route 18 transit bus offers connections between the incline and downtown Johnstown. , the cost for a ride on the incline is $3 or $5 for a roundtrip. The one way fare for automobiles $8. The incline takes around 90 seconds to travel between stations. The same trip takes 10 minutes by automobile. In 2021, the Johnstown Inclined Plane had an annual ridership of 20,193 passengers, a decrease of 50.5 percent from the previous year.

The upper station has a gift shop selling souvenirs and snacks. A visitor center is located adjacent to the station. The mechanical room housing the incline&#x27;s hoisting mechanism can be viewed from windows in the gift shop and the visitor center lobby. An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located on the opposite side of the station from the visitor center. Since the 1970s, the upper station of the Johnstown Incline has also led to a series of multipurpose trails. Two hiking trails and several mountain bike trails allow visitors to recreate on the hillside. One of the hiking trails is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.

<doc id="1054300" wikidata="Q681136" url="?curid=1054300" title="Wolfgang Flür">
<text>Wolfgang Flür (born 17 July 1947) is a German musician, best known for playing percussion in the electronic group Kraftwerk from 1973 to 1987. Flür claims that he invented the electric drums the group used throughout the 1970s. However, patent records dispute this, citing Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter as the creators.

==Background==
In the 1960s, Flür played an acoustic drum kit in the Düsseldorf band The Spirits of Sound, along with guitarist Michael Rother, who would also go on to play in Kraftwerk, and who would later form Neu! with Kraftwerk drummer Klaus Dinger.

==Post-Kraftwerk==
In 1997, Flür founded the band Yamo and released the album &quot;Time Pie&quot;, a collaboration with Mouse on Mars. Yamo&#x27;s next release, the 12&quot; &quot;I Was a Robot&quot;, reached number 6 in the German club charts. Collaborations with Pizzicato Five and Der Plan founding member Pyrolator were announced, and the lyrics to a song called &quot;Greed&quot; appeared in Flür&#x27;s autobiography, but this material remains unreleased.

In 2000, Flür published his autobiography, &quot;Ich war ein Roboter&quot; (English version: &quot;I Was a Robot&quot;). The book covers his youth, early career as a musician, sexual escapades, and some of his activity within Kraftwerk. Hütter and Schneider filed a lawsuit against Flür, causing a temporary halt of the publication and revision of parts that included disputed accounts of his time with the band.

Recently, Flür has been seen DJing in clubs, playing tech house and electro. He has also played electronic percussion with the German synthpop band Dyko in live shows and on their 2009 cover of Kraftwerk&#x27;s &quot;Autobahn&quot;. He has also performed under the moniker &quot;Musik Soldat&quot;.

Japanese singer Maki Nomiya&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Party People&quot; included the song &quot;Yamate Line,&quot; with songwriting and co-production credited to Flür/Yamo.

On 16 October 2015, Flür released his first solo album under his own name, entitled &quot;Eloquence&quot;.

Flür announced three new collaboration albums, the first of which, &quot;Magazine 1&quot;, to be released in February 2022. 

On 4 September 2020, Flür collaborated with German dance act U96 to release Transhuman, it featured 3 new songs from Flür, the only songs he&#x27;s released in 5 years.

On 12 May 2021, Kraftwerk was announced as one of the inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Flür being one of the inductees along with Schneider, Hütter and Karl Bartos.

Wolfgang&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Magazine 1&quot;, was released on 4 March 2022, and included collaborations with Peter Duggal, Peter Hook, Maps, Carl Cox, Claudia Brucken and Midge Ure.

A third solo album from Flür is planned for March 2025, titled &quot;Time&quot;. It will feature collaborations with Thomas Bangalter, Boris Blank of Yello, Peter Hook, Juan Atkins, and more.

<doc id="1054309" wikidata="Q5521071" url="?curid=1054309" title="Gangaramaya Temple">
<text>Gangaramaya Temple (Sinhala: ශ්‍රී ගංගාරාම මහාවිහාරය &quot;śrī gangārāma mahāvihāraya&quot;, Tamil: ஸ்ரீ கங்காராம மகாவிகாரம் &quot;Srī Gaṅgārāma Makāvikāram&quot;) is one of the most important temples in Colombo, Sri Lanka, being a mix of modern architecture and cultural essence. Located on the Beira Lake, it was completed in the late 19th century.

== Architecture ==
The temple&#x27;s architecture demonstrates an eclectic mix of Sri Lankan, Thai, Indian, and Chinese architecture.

This Buddhist temple includes several imposing buildings and is situated not far from the placid waters of Beira Lake on a plot of land that was originally a small hermitage on a piece of marshy land. It has the main features of a Vihara (temple), the Cetiya (Pagada) the Bodhitree, the Vihara Mandiraya, the Seema malaka (assembly hall for monks) and the Relic Chamber. In addition, a museum, a library, a residential hall, a three storeyed Pirivena, educational halls and an alms hall are also on the premises.

Most notable for tourists is the architecture of Seema Malaka, which was built with donations from a Muslim sponsor to the design of Geoffrey Bawa.

== Famous incumbents ==

It was the home for erudite scholars such as Ratmalana Sri Dharmarama Thero, Waskaduwa Sri Subhuti Thero, Weligama Sri Sumangala Thero, Welivitiye Dhammaratna Thero, and Pandit Batuwantudawe.

== History ==

Don Bastian de Silva Jayasuriya Goonewardane, a 19th-century shipping merchant who was seeking suitable land to build a temple for the Matara Sri Dharmarama thero, bought a beautiful tract belonging to three Moors, and filled and prepared the land at great expense. The land was bordered on two sides by the Moragoda Ela and the Pettigala Ela was used to build the temple, which was subsequently named the Padawthota Gangaramaya Viharaya. The Mudaliyar, with the assistance of the people built a great &#x27;Chaitya&#x27; (Dagaba) of 30 Riyans, and built a great decorative arch (thorana) and a &#x27;Sandakada pahana&#x27; modeled on the ones found at Anuradhapura, at the entrance to the temple. A &#x27;Bo&#x27; sapling brought from the great Sri Maha Bhodiya in Anuradhapura, was planted with his own hands and nurtured. He also built a three-storied preaching hall, walls, railings and the moat around the temple.

== Present day activities ==
Today Gangaramaya serves as a place of Buddhist worship and a learning centre. The temple is involved in Buddhist welfare work including old peoples&#x27; homes, a vocational school and an orphanage. The temple is uniquely attractive and tolerant of members of many different religions. It has been instrumental in establishing the Buddhist temple on Staten Island (US) the Buddhist Center in New York and the Buddhist Centre in Tanzania, thus helping to propagate the Dhamma in other countries.

<text>The Mungana affair involved the sale to the Government of Queensland, Australia, in 1922, of some mining properties in the Chillagoe-Mungana districts of northern Queensland, at a grossly inflated price. At that time, Ted Theodore was Premier of Queensland and William McCormack, was member for Cairns and a former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. Both men represented the Australian Labor Party. McCormack was later premier of Queensland, from 1925 to 1929, and Theodore entered federal politics in 1927.

Following the 1929 Queensland state election, the new conservative Queensland Government appointed a Royal Commission to investigate the sale of properties owned by the Mungana Mining Co. On 4 July 1930, the Commission reported. It found that, at the time of the sale in 1922, Theodore and McCormack each secretly held 25% ownership of the properties. It declared that Theodore and McCormack were guilty of &quot;fraud and dishonesty&quot;, and abuse of ministerial position. That forced Theodore&#x27;s immediate resignation from his role as Federal Treasurer. McCormack, who had quit the Labor leadership following his government&#x27;s 1929 electoral defeat, resigned from Queensland Parliament in February 1930, the month the Royal Commission was set up.

The Queensland Government did not charge either man with any criminal offence. However, it signalled its intention to take civil action to retrieve the difference between the selling price of the mines and their estimated worth. After considerable delay, civil proceedings began on 22 July 1931. A &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict was handed down on 24 August.

<text>The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom was a committee formed in 1859 to enquire into the ability of the United Kingdom to defend itself against an attempted invasion by a foreign power, and to advise the British Government on the remedial action required. The appointment of the Commission had been prompted by public concern about the growing military and naval power of the French Empire and was instigated by the Prime Minister, Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, who came to be closely associated with the project. In the following year, the Commission&#x27;s report recommended a huge programme of fortification to defend the country&#x27;s arsenals and naval bases. Many of the recommendations were acted upon; however, the great expense, the length of time taken to complete the various works and their perceived usefulness were all subjects of critical political, press and public debate.

==Background==

In the late 1850s, there were serious concerns that France might attempt to invade the United Kingdom. The recent period had seen great improvements in gunnery (with Rifled Muzzle Loader (RML) and Rifled Breech Loader (RBL) designs) and the widespread introduction of steam propulsion in ships. In 1858, France began a programme to increase their fleet to have 150 steamships, four of which would be ironclads, the first of which, &quot;La Gloire&quot;, superior to anything in the British inventory, was launched in 1859. Belatedly, the British response was the iron-hulled , but several obsolete wooden ships of the line were building at the same time. When Palmerston returned to power in 1859, public concern over this naval arms race, combined with Napoleon III&#x27;s aggressive intervention in the Second Italian War of Independence, allowed him to act on his conviction that Britain&#x27;s coastal defences were inadequate to prevent invasion if the Royal Navy was lured elsewhere.

==The Royal Commission==

===The Commissioners===
The Commission consisted of six eminent naval and military officers, plus a civilian architect:
:Major-General Sir Henry David Jones CB (Chairman)
:Major-General Duncan Alexander Cameron
:Rear Admiral George Augustus Eliot
:Major-General Sir Frederick Abbott, Indian Army
:Captain Astley Cooper Key, Royal Navy
:Lieutenant-Colonel John Henry Lefroy, Royal Artillery
:James Fergusson Esquire

The Secretary of the Commission was Major William Jervois of the Royal Engineers, a progressive military engineer who held the post of Assistant Inspector-General of Fortifications. Although not appointed as a Commissioner, Jervois seems to have had considerable influence on the conduct of the Commission. Amongst the Commissioners themselves, Cooper Key was an expert in the latest advances in naval gunnery, while Lefroy was an experienced and knowledgeable artillery officer who had been one of the founders of the Royal Artillery Institution. Fergusson was an expert in the history of eastern architecture, but had also published books entitled; &quot;An Essay on a Proposed New System of Fortification: with Hints for its Application to our National Defences&quot; (1849), &quot;The Peril of Portsmouth; or, French Fleets and English Forts&quot; (1852) and &quot;Portsmouth Protected: a Sequel to the Peril of Portsmouth&quot; (1856).
===Terms of Reference===
Formulated by Lord Palmerston and the Secretary of State for War, Sidney Herbert, the Commission&#x27;s brief was as follows:

An attached memorandum directed the attention of the Commissioners to the works already under construction at Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, Plymouth, Portland, Pembroke and Chatham; they were further asked to consider how the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich might best be defended.

===Investigations===
Starting on 3 November 1859, the first phase of the Commission&#x27;s work was a series of interviews with technical experts and senior military and naval officers. One specialist was Captain Cowper Phipps Coles, the hero of the Siege of Taganrog and an expert in the bombardment of fortifications from the sea. He was so enraged by the numerous questions posed by the Commissioners that he was twice asked to leave the room so that he could recover his composure. Perhaps because of this, the Commission failed to enquire about Coles&#x27;s pioneering design for a revolving gun turret, which he had patented in that year. Another interviewee was General John Fox Burgoyne, who had conducted the Siege of Sevastopol and was the current Inspector-General of Fortifications. Burgoyne&#x27;s opinion was that the defence of the dockyard at Portsmouth was of primary importance and it could be protected from bombardment by the fortification and garrisoning of the Isle of Wight and also Portsdown Hill, the ridge which overlooks Portsmouth from the north. Burgoyne also believed that the coast between Portsmouth and the Thames was vulnerable to invasion and that every small harbour there needed to be fortified. Sir William Armstrong, the artillery designer and manufacturer, was questioned at length about the current capabilities of modern rifled artillery and likely future developments. Armstrong&#x27;s opinion was that his latest guns would be able to defeat some features of current fortification, such as the Carnot wall, but that the maximum range of artillery would be unlikely to exceed in the future.

The Commission also conducted a series of visits to the sites in question, before convening to produce a report of their findings. Perhaps because the Commissioners were all respected experts in their own fields, they were apparently able to work together amicably.

==The Report==
The Report of the Commissioners was published on 7 February 1860. The Commissioners concluded that the fleet, standing army and volunteer forces, even combined, did not provide sufficient defence against invasion. Further, that the coastline which they considered to be at risk, the from the Humber to Penzance, could not feasibly be completely fortified and therefore recommended that &quot;the fortifications of this country should be confined to those points... whose possession would give him sure bases for operations&quot;. A detailed plan and costing was produced for each location which required defences, including forts which were already under construction, resulting in a massive programme. The total expenditure projected for the purchase of land and construction costs (including some funds that had already been agreed but not yet provided) was as follows:

Also included in the costings were the total of £500,000 for the armament of these works (a sum that was to prove hopelessly optimistic) and £1,000,000 for the construction of floating batteries, giving a grand total of £11,850,000. The Commissioners further suggested that a force of volunteer artillerymen be raised to man the guns in the new works.

However the commission left “extended commerce” and consequently the food supply of Great Britain, to the protection of the fleet. This topic was then addressed by the Royal Commission Appointed to Enquire into the Defence of British Possessions and Commerce Abroad.

==Implementation==
The government, although broadly in agreement with the report, thought that it was too ambitious to be accepted by Parliament in its original form, and therefore set about reducing the number of planned works while attempting to retain the objectives of the scheme for each locality. Planned forts that were not proceeded with included fifteen at Plymouth, ten at Pembroke, six at Portsmouth and four at Chatham; the floating batteries were also dispensed with, resulting in a total saving of £3,930,000. Palmerston finally laid the Fortification Bill before an astonished House of Commons on 23 July 1860. Opposition came from those who believed that there was no threat from France and those who believed that greater security should be achieved by further spending on the navy. The chief opponents were the Radical Richard Cobden and his ally, William Ewart Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, who between them had recently concluded the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty, a Free Trade agreement with France. The bill was accepted as the Fortifications (Provisions for Expenses) Act 1860, providing an initial sum of two million pounds and later payments financed by loans to a total of nine million.

By the time the fortifications were completed in the 1880s it was clear that the French had not seriously planned to invade. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 removed the threat and the forts became known as Palmerston&#x27;s Follies. As a key purpose of fortification is deterrent, this judgement was harsh, but with the rapid development of warship design during the period, the time taken to plan and implement the works would always have caused problems with ensuring that the defences were capable of defeating a French attack force.

==The works==

The types of fortification constructed as a result of the Royal Commission fell into two main categories; coastal batteries and land forts.

===Coastal batteries===
The main purpose of the coastal batteries was to provide protected positions for heavy coastal artillery which would be able to engage enemy warships and troopships. In some places, for instance high on a cliff, the guns could be mounted in a barbette or open gun pit. However, where the batteries were close to the shoreline and could be engaged directly by enemy gunfire, each heavy gun was mounted in a casemate, a vaulted chamber with embrasure for the gun to fire through which was pierced through an armoured shield. Since being mounted in an enclosed space limited the traverse of the gun, casemates were arranged in a long curved row so that the guns of the battery could follow the progress of a passing enemy ship, each weapon engaging it in turn. The rear of the battery was closed either by a simple wall pierced with loopholes, or by a more elaborate defensible building which doubled as a barracks for the garrison. The intention of these rearward defences was that they would be strong enough to prevent the battery being taken by enemy infantry but weak enough to be demolished should the battery fall into enemy hands. In two forts, Fort Darnet and Fort Hoo, the casemates formed a complete circle; other circular works were built as sea forts with foundations on the sea-bed and entirely surrounded by water. A number of the Royal Commission coastal works were upgrades of existing fortifications, such as the 16th century Pendennis Castle at Falmouth.

===Land forts===
The landward fortifications were intended to prevent an enemy force who may have landed at an undefended beach from marching overland and assaulting a dockyard from the rear, or simply bombarding it. These forts were built in the new polygonal style without the traditional bastions and generally sited so as to form a &quot;ring fortress&quot;, so that each fort could support its neighbour with artillery fire. Construction of some landward forts at Portsmouth and Plymouth had already begun in the 1850s and work on the ring fortress at Chatham was not started until 1875, resulting in very different designs as military theories changed over the decades.

<text>Intracoastal City () is an unincorporated community in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is situated on the west bank of the Vermilion River at its junction with the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway and has various port facilities and some permanent residents.

Intracoastal City is approximately 13 miles (21 km) south of Abbeville, the Vermilion Parish seat. It is part of the Abbeville Micropolitan Statistical Area as well as the Acadiana region of Louisiana.

On September 4, 2011 Tropical Storm Lee made landfall south-west of the area.

On July 13, 2019 Hurricane Barry made landfall in the area.

==Culture==
Its facilities include heliports, a shrimp docking facility, and dry docks.
As it stands on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico somewhat remote from major settlements, it is often used by the National Hurricane Center as a breakpoint for tropical cyclone warnings and watches which affect the bayous of eastern Louisiana but not the west of the state. It also plays a major part in Louisiana&#x27;s oil and gas industry by supporting offshore personnel, platforms and drilling rigs.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Intracoastal City has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<doc id="1054333" wikidata="Q1346058" url="?curid=1054333" title="Growl (software)">
<text>Growl is a deprecated global notification system and pop-up notification implementation for the Mac OS X and Windows operating systems. Applications can use Growl to display small notifications about events which may be important to the user. This software allows users to fully control their notifications, while allowing application developers to spend less time creating notifications and Growl developers to concentrate on the usability of notifications. Growl can be used in conjunction with Apple&#x27;s Notification Center that is included in Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and higher.

==Details==
Growl is installed as a preference pane added to the Mac OS X System Preferences. This pane may be used to enable and disable Growl&#x27;s notifications for specific applications or specific notifications for each application. Each notification provides some information, such as &quot;Download Finished&quot; or the name of the current iTunes track. The software comes with multiple display plugins, providing the user with different style options for presenting the notifications. Display plugins include visual styles as well as the ability to send notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications. Additional third-party plugins or scripts exist to add Growl notifications to iChat, Mail, Thunderbird, Safari, and iTunes.

Application developers may make use of the Growl API to send notifications to their users. Growl includes bindings for developers who use the Objective-C, C, Perl, Python, Tcl, AppleScript, Java, and Ruby programming languages.

==Adobe installation==
The Growl website listed applications that install Growl without the user&#x27;s permission, including Adobe Creative Suite 5. Adobe published a blog post apologizing for installing Growl on users&#x27; systems without permission, and says that they are &quot;actively working to mitigate the problem&quot;. Adobe added an article to their knowledge base explaining what notifications CS5 sends and how to remove Growl.

<doc id="1054335" wikidata="Q434184" url="?curid=1054335" title=".um">
<text>.um was the Internet country code top-level domain for the United States Minor Outlying Islands. It was administered by the United States Minor Outlying Islands Registry. Until late 2006 USMIR was housed at the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute (USC-ISI), which was the original administrator of .us prior to NeuStar absorbing that role.

In January 2007, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers reportedly dropped the .um domain from the master list of domain names in response to the domain&#x27;s being unused and USC-ISI&#x27;s desire to divest itself of responsibility for the domain. In November 2007 at the registry website of &quot;www.nic.um&quot; a message stated &quot;Registration is CLOSED at this time. We are only accepting Registrar Accounts.&quot; Links to a brief description of each of the individual American islands were also given. In December 2007, registration was opened on an experimental basis with an &quot;Annual Account Maintenance&quot; fee of $1,200 and a $30 annual domain registration.

Since the USC-ISI divested itself of this registry, in late 2006, EP.NET hosted USMIR and continued to administer it. According to the www.nic.um site at that time, the TLD was no longer affiliated with USC-ISI and had spun off the venture into an independent company, USMIR, which has the same contact information as that of the limited liability company EP.net. Accessing the website without the &quot;www&quot; subdomain returned a copy of the main site for &quot;EP.net&quot;.

Some .um websites, like &#x27;hotel.um&#x27; and &#x27;co.um&#x27; appeared after the TLD registry opened; however, as of April 20, 2008, the .um domain has been removed from the DNS root zone. It appears ICANN took the action of removing .um from the root since USC-ISI requested this. Whether USMIR will refund domain owners is not known. According to the revocation report on the IANA website, the U.S. DOC has approved the removal and has also instructed ICANN not to reassign the domain without prior approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce.

<doc id="1054336" wikidata="Q4869748" url="?curid=1054336" title="Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home">
<text>Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home (now known as Battersea) is an animal rescue centre for dogs and cats. Battersea rescues dogs and cats until their owner or a new one can be found. It is one of the UK&#x27;s oldest and best known animal rescue centres. It was established in Holloway, London, in 1860 and moved to Battersea in 1871.&quot;

The non-government funded organisation cares for an average of 240 dogs and 145 cats across all three centres at any one time. The charity has cared for more than 3.1 million dogs and cats over its history.

==History==

Battersea was established in Holloway in 1860 by Mary Tealby (1801–1865). She called it &quot;The Temporary Home for Lost and Starving Dogs&quot;. Initially the home was in her scullery but as the number of dogs delivered to her grew she hired some nearby stables funded by herself, her brother and Sarah Major. In 1860 the RSPCA agreed to assist and the committee meetings were held at the RSPCA offices at 12 Pall Mall. &quot;The Times&quot; ran a story ridiculing the idea of opening a &quot;home&quot; for dogs when there were homeless people in London. It accused Tealby of &quot;letting her zeal ...outrun her discretion&quot;. Its most impressive supporter in the 1860s was Charles Dickens. He wrote about a &quot;remarkable institution&quot; that had saved &quot;over a thousand&quot; dogs in 1860. He noted that the dogs were cared for but if necessary humanely disposed of. By 1864 the finances were sound and they were handling 2,000 dogs that year.

Battersea started taking in cats from 1883, but its name remained Battersea Dogs Home until 2002.

During World War II, then manager Edward Healey-Tutt advised against people euthanising their pets because of fear of food shortages. Throughout the war Battersea fed and cared for over 145,000 dogs.

In 1979, Battersea acquired Bell Mead Kennels, which is now known as Battersea Old Windsor in Berkshire and in 1999, Battersea bought a centre in Kent, now known as Battersea Brands Hatch.

In 2002, the name was changed from Battersea Dogs Home to include cats in its name – Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home.
To mark its 150th anniversary in 2010, the charity&#x27;s London Cattery was opened by HRH the Duchess of Cornwall. Royal Mail released a set of stamps featuring a series of dogs and cats that had been adopted by staff. It also launched a commemorative book, &quot;A Home of Their Own&quot;, which charts the history of the Home. This includes a look at prominent people who have adopted animals such as Elton John, who credited his dog Thomas with helping him through a rough period. Starting in 2011, Battersea implemented the &quot;Staffies. They&#x27;re Softer Than You Think&quot; campaign to educate the public on the misconceptions about the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.

On 17 March 2015, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a plaque to officially open the intake kennels named after their founder, Mary Tealby kennels. In 2016, a new state of the art Veterinary Hospital was opened at the London centre.

In 2018, the charity rebranded as just &quot;Battersea&quot; &quot;to be here for every dog and cat&quot;. The charity&#x27;s public affairs work involved spearheading a campaign to increase maximum sentences from six months to five years for the worst animal cruelty crimes in England and Wales. Battersea has been campaigning since 2017.

The charity also launched the Battersea Academy, and launched a campaign &quot;Rescue Is My Favourite Breed&quot; in 2019.

The Chief Executive is Peter Laurie, who took over from Claire Horton CBE January 2021.

===Patronage===

In 1885, Queen Victoria became patron of the home, and it has remained under royal patronage ever since. Queen Camilla is the current patron, and Prince Michael of Kent is the President.

==Media==
In 1862, Charles Dickens published an article about the home for his magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. He called it an &quot;extraordinary monument of the remarkable affection with which the English people regard the race of dogs&quot;.

===TV programmes===
Battersea has featured on many television programmes and documentaries. The Channel 4 programme &quot;Pet Rescue&quot; which aired in 1997 featured Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home. BBC One programme &quot;Animal Rescue Live&quot; was broadcast live for a week at Battersea in July 2007. The programme was presented by Matt Baker and Selina Scott.

ITV&#x27;s &quot;For the Love of Dogs&quot; is filmed at Battersea.

<doc id="1054350" wikidata="Q1543656" url="?curid=1054350" title="Grattan massacre">
<text>The Gratetan Massacre, also referred to as the Grattan Fight, was the initial conflict of the First Sioux War, occurring on August 19, 1854, between the United States Army and the Lakota Sioux warriors. This event took place east of Fort Laramie, located in the Nebraska Territory, which is now part of Goshen County, Wyoming.

A small contingent of soldiers entered a large Sioux camp to apprehend an individual accused of killing a settler&#x27;s cow, despite the fact that such issues were supposed to be resolved by the US Indian agent according to treaty agreements. After one of the soldiers fatally shot Chief Matȟó Wayúhi (Conquering Bear), the Sichangu Lakotas returned fire, resulting in the deaths of 29 soldiers, including Lieutenant John Grattan and a civilian interpreter.

==Background==
From 1845–56, the Great Plains suffered a severe drought. Conditions of this drought dramatically reduced grass coverage, and Kiowa tribes recorded few to no bison on the Plains by the late 1840s. The lack of bison, in turn, caused hunger and starvation among the Plains American Indians. By 1853, U.S. Indian Agents noted, &quot;many of the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, and Sioux, in a starving condition, on account of the scanty supply of buffalo[.]&quot;

Late in summer of 1854, about 4,000 Sichangu and Oglala were camped east of Fort Laramie, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of 1851. On August 17, a cow belonging to Mormon Christian J. Larsen (chaplain of the Hans P. Olsen Company of Danish immigrants) traveling on the nearby Oregon Trail, strayed and was killed by a visiting Miniconjou (Sioux) named High Forehead. Larsen barely noticed the incident in his journal, writing, &quot;We passed a large encampment of Indians before we reached &#x27;Fort Laramie&#x27;. They shot one of our cows, that was lame, and we let them have the meat. They also shot one, belonging to Hans Monsen, and it came into our camp, wounded, where we had it butchered.&quot;

Lt. Hugh Fleming, the senior officer of the small garrison, consulted with the chief, Matȟó Wayúhi, also known as Conquering Bear, to discuss the loss of livestock. Lt. Fleming was either unaware, or chose to ignore that these matters were supposed to be handled by the local Indian agent according to the terms of the Treaty of 1851. The Indian agent in this case was John Whitfield, who was due to arrive within days with annuities with which restitution could be made.

Despite knowing that the matter was not under the purview of the military, Conquering Bear still attempted to negotiate with Lt. Fleming, offering a horse from his personal herd or a cow from the tribe&#x27;s herd; however, Larsen, the owner of the cow, reportedly persisted in demanding $25 instead. Lt. Fleming asked the Sioux to arrest High Forehead and deliver him to the fort, which Conquering Bear refused; he had no authority over the Miniconjou and did not want to violate his people&#x27;s tradition of hospitality. The day&#x27;s talk ended in stalemate.

On August 19, 1854, Second Lieutenant John Lawrence Grattan of the U.S. 6th Infantry Regiment, a recent graduate of West Point and supernumerary waiting for a vacancy in the regiment, led an armed detachment into the Indian encampment to take custody of High Forehead and bring him back to the fort. Grattan was inexperienced and described as contemptuous of the Lakotas&#x27; ability as warriors. This was his first (and only) encounter with the Sioux.

A commander at Laramie later recalled, &quot;There is no doubt that Lt. Grattan left this post with a desire to have a fight with the Indians, and that he had determined to take the man at all hazards.&quot; In Grattan&#x27;s party were a sergeant, a corporal, 27 privates, and a French-Indian interpreter named Lucien Auguste; the military forces had two artillery pieces in addition to arms.

==Events==

By the time the detachment reached the encampment, Auguste was intoxicated from drinking along the way, as he feared the encounter. Grattan broke his bottle and scolded him. Auguste was not well liked by the Sioux; he spoke only broken Dakota and had little grasp of other dialects. As they entered the encampment, he began to taunt the Sioux, calling their warriors women, and saying the soldiers were not there to talk, but to kill them all. James Bordeaux, who owned the nearby trading post and observed the encounter, later recounted Auguste&#x27;s comments.

Historians estimate the encampment had some 1,200 warriors among the total 4,800 population. According to Bordeaux, Lt. Grattan began to realize the risk and stopped to discuss the situation with the trader. Bordeaux advised him to talk directly with Conquering Bear and let him handle the situation. Grattan seemed to understand and continued on into the encampment. Going first to the lodge of High Forehead, he ordered him to surrender to the US forces. High Forehead said he would die first.

Grattan went to Conquering Bear, saying the Sioux should arrest the guilty party and turn him over. Conquering Bear refused but tried to negotiate, offering a horse as compensation for the cow. Bordeaux reportedly said the interpreter Auguste taunted the Sioux, and failed to fully or accurately translate Conquering Bear and Grattan&#x27;s comments, as there seemed to be confusion between them. Conquering Bear asked for the trader Bordeaux to act as interpreter, as the Sioux trusted him and his language ability. Called by the Sioux, Bordeaux rode to the meeting place; later he said he could see the situation was out of hand. As Grattan pressed Conquering Bear, numerous Sioux warriors moved into flanking positions around the soldiers. Bordeaux returned to the trading post, where he told associates to arm themselves, as a fight was brewing.

Ending the discussion, Grattan began walking back to his column. A nervous soldier fired his gun, shooting a Sioux. The warriors started shooting arrows while leaders tried to take control. Conquering Bear was mortally wounded and died nine days later near the Niobrara River. The Sichangu Sioux warriors, led by Spotted Tail, then a rising war chief within their people, quickly killed Grattan, 11 of his men, and the interpreter. A group of some 18 soldiers retreated on foot trying to reach some rocks for defense, but they were cut off and killed by overcoming warriors led by Red Cloud, a rising war chief within the Oglala Sioux. One of Grattan&#x27;s soldiers survived the immediate situation but later died of his wounds.

Conquering Bear was the only Lakota who was killed. The Sioux spared Bordeaux, both because he was married to a Sichangu Sioux woman and because he had a friendly relationship with the tribes.

==Aftermath==

The enraged warriors &quot;rampaged throughout the night, swearing to attack other whites.&quot; They rode against Fort Laramie the next morning but withdrew; they looted the trading post but did not harm Bordeaux. On the third day after the US attack, the Sichangu and Oglala abandoned the camp on the North Platte River and returned to their respective hunting grounds. 

On the fourth day, the military asked Bordeaux to arrange a burial party. His team went to the scene and found that the slain soldiers had been ritually mutilated. Grattan&#x27;s body was identified by his watch and was returned to the trading post for burial. The remains of the troops were interred at the site in a shallow mass grave. The soldiers&#x27; remains were later exhumed (unburied) and re-interred at Fort McPherson National Cemetery, where a white marble monument was erected in their memory. Grattan&#x27;s remains were moved later and reinterred to Fort Leavenworth National Cemetery in Kansas. A historical marker was later erected about one-half mile from the site of the events. 
The U.S. press called the event the &quot;Grattan Massacre.&quot; Accounts generally ignored the US soldiers&#x27; instigation of the event by their failures: first, to leave it up to the Indian agent to settle, as called for in the treaty; and second, shooting chief Conquering Bear in the back.

When news of the fight reached the War Department, officials started planning retaliation to punish the Sioux. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis characterized the incident as &quot;the result of a deliberately formed plan.&quot;

Col. William S. Harney was recalled from Paris in April 1855 and sent to Fort Kearny, where he assembled a command of 600 troops, consisting of men from the 6th Infantry, 10th Infantry, 4th Artillery, and his own 2nd US Dragoons. In total, he had four mounted companies led by Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke and five companies of infantry under Major Albemarle Cady. They set out on August 24, 1855, to find the Sioux and exact retribution. Harney was quoted as saying, &quot;By God, I&#x27;m for battle—no peace.&quot;

Warned by Thomas S. Twiss of the Indian Bureau that the army had put a force in the field, half of the Lakota who were camped north of the Platte River went into Fort Laramie for protection as &quot;friendlies&quot;. The other half, generally led by Conquering Bear&#x27;s successor Little Thunder, remained at large. They considered themselves peaceful but knew that Harney was out with a force. They continued to harbor warriors sought by the army. 

Harney engaged them in the Battle of Ash Hollow (also known as the Battle of Bluewater Creek) on September 3, 1855. U.S. soldiers killed 86 Sichangu Sioux, half of them women and children, in present-day Garden County, Nebraska. The &quot;New York Times&quot; and other newspapers recounted the battle as a massacre because so many women and children were killed. The village of 230 persons was caught between an assault by the infantry and a blocking force by the cavalry. Spotted Tail, principal war chief of the Sichangu, was surprised while unarmed and taking part in the parley; he was seriously wounded four times and two bullets passed through his chest, but still he killed or wounded 13 &quot;long knives&quot;.

Harney returned to Fort Laramie with 70 prisoners, most of them women and children, including Spotted Tail&#x27;s mother, wife and three children, and the wife of Iron Shell (Maza Pangeska). To make the Sichangu Women and children free, Harney claimed the delivery of the leaders of Grattan Fight, and Spotted Tail, Red Leaf (Waba Sha), Long Chin (Iku Hanska) and, some days later, Standing Elk (Hehaka Najin) and Red Plume (Wiyaka Sha), went to Fort Pierre, esorted by Iron Shell and the whole Sichangu crowd. On October 25, the three warriors sought by the expedition surrendered, were held for a year at Fort Leavenworth (where Spotted Tail was reached by his wife several months later), and were released. 

Harney ordered the tribes to send representatives to a treaty council at Fort Pierre in March 1856, where a treaty was signed on terms dictated by the War Department. Twiss tried to undermine the treaty, and Harney had him removed from office, although he did not have the authority to do so; George W. Manypenny, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, successfully lobbied the Senate to reject the treaty, and Twiss was reinstated. 

Harney&#x27;s actions against the Lakota restrained them for nearly ten years. The US was soon involved in the American Civil War, and did not have resources to fight on the Great Plains.

Historians such as Griske believe the following nearly quarter-century of intermittent warfare on the Great Plains was triggered by the Grattan massacre. Others suggest numerous factors, especially US desire for control of lands that were Sioux territory, that contributed to make warfare inevitable.

In addition, Red Cloud admitted to having been present in the battle where thirty people died.

<doc id="1054358" wikidata="Q1549557" url="?curid=1054358" title="Hokitika">
<text>Hokitika is a town in the West Coast region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, south of Greymouth, and close to the mouth of the Hokitika River. It is the seat and largest town in the Westland District. The town&#x27;s estimated population is as of .

On a clear day Aoraki / Mount Cook can clearly be seen from Hokitika&#x27;s main street.

== Toponymy ==
The name Hokitika translates from Māori as &quot;to return directly&quot; (from , &#x27;to return&#x27;, and , &#x27;direct&#x27;). According to the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, the name comes from when a band of Ngāi Tahu warriors in search of greenstone were about to attack Ngāti Wairangi . The chief of the invaders drowned while trying to cross the Hokitika River, and the leaderless (army) then returned directly to their own home.

==History==
The land where Hokitika stands was purchased in 1860 from Māori when Poutini Ngāi Tahu chiefs signed the Arahura Deed. This was the sale of the whole of the West Coast region, apart from small areas reserved for Māori. It was almost 3 million hectares and sold to the Crown for £300.

Founded on gold mining in 1864, it was a centre of the West Coast gold rush and grew very quickly. Members of the Jewish community ran stores and businesses and built a synagogue in Tancred St. One of them, John Lazar, was appointed Town Clerk in 1866 and was a prominent Freemason.

By late 1866, it was one of New Zealand&#x27;s most populous centres. On 16 September 1867, there were 41 vessels alongside the wharf at Hokitika, in some places three and four deep. In 1867, the port of Hokitika ranked first in New Zealand in both the number of vessels entered inwards and in the total value of exports; principally gold.

On 8 March 1868 a mock funeral was held in protest about the conviction and hanging of three Irish Fenians in Manchester – the Manchester Martyrs. The funeral was led by Roman Catholic Father William Larkin and a Celtic Cross was erected in the Hokitika Cemetery. Larkin was later arrested, charged, and convicted of riot and seditious libel.

In 1873 Hokitika became the capital of the short-lived Westland Province which lasted from 1873 until the abolition of provinces in 1876.

In the early 20th century Hokitika had two hospitals, the Westland Hospital and the Seaview Asylum.

In October 1941, three Hokitika police officers (and a policeman stationed in the neighbouring locality of Kaniere), along with a field instructor for the Canterbury education board, were killed when a local farmer, Stanley Graham, went on a shooting rampage and killed seven people, including two armed Home guard personnel.

In the ensuing manhunt, the biggest in New Zealand history, overseen by the Commissioner of Police, Denis Cummings, more than 100 New Zealand Police and several hundred New Zealand Army &amp; Home Guard searched the area for the gunman for 12 days, with orders to shoot him on sight if found still armed. On 20 October, after being spotted by two police constables and a local civilian carrying his rifle and ammunition belts, Graham was fatally wounded by a police constable and died the next day.

The population has declined greatly since that time but the population of the Westland District is now on the rise thanks to &quot;lifestyle inhabitants&quot;. Almost 30% of the district&#x27;s rate-payers live outside of Hokitika.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Hokitika has an oceanic climate, with mild summers, cool winters, and rainfall evenly distributed across the year. It is one of the wettest places in New Zealand, with over of rainfall per year.

===Hokitika Gorge===
Nearby Hokitika Gorge is a popular short tourist walk, with vibrant blue water and a &quot;swing&quot; (metal rope suspension) bridge.

== Demographics ==
The Hokitika urban area, as defined by Statistics New Zealand, covers and is coterminous with the Hokitika statistical area. The urban area has an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Hokitika had a population of 2,892 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 75 people (−2.5%) since the 2013 census, and a decrease of 186 people (−6.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,305 households, comprising 1,374 males and 1,521 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.9 males per female. The median age was 47.5 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 459 people (15.9%) aged under 15 years, 474 (16.4%) aged 15 to 29, 1,278 (44.2%) aged 30 to 64, and 687 (23.8%) aged 65 or older.

The percentage of people born overseas was 11.6, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 47.7% had no religion, 41.3% were Christian, 0.4% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.8% were Hindu, 0.4% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 1.3% had other religions.

The median income was $27,300, compared with $31,800 nationally. 318 people (13.1%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,146 (47.1%) people were employed full-time, 408 (16.8%) were part-time, and 57 (2.3%) were unemployed.

==Economy and culture==
The major industries of greenstone (pounamu), gold, coal, and forestry have all dwindled over the last century, but a growing ecotourism industry has grown up and the town is starting to show signs of recovery. It has become a major tourist stop on the West Coast&#x27;s main highway route, with carving of greenstone an important local industry. It is also gaining a reputation for its annual wild food festival which has been running since 1990.

Seaview Asylum was once the town&#x27;s biggest employer.
Another important industry is dairying, with Westland Milk Products having its headquarters and main processing plant in the town. Westland Milk Products was established as a dairy co-operative in 1937, and was sold to the Yili Group in 2019. It is the country&#x27;s third-equal largest dairy processor as of 2018.
Hokitika has a 3D digital cinema, the Regent Theatre, due to volunteer hours and grants from the Lions foundation, Lottery&#x27;s commission, Development West Coast through the Major District Initiative and pub charity. The Art Deco theatre is a heritage building and narrowly avoided being demolished, thanks to a last-minute coup in the management committee. Community performances are also held there. Hokitika has a drama group which produce plays. It is also on the circuit for Arts on Tour and well known artists from many countries as well as New Zealand perform at the Old Lodge Theatre.
Every January, Hokitika beach hosts the Driftwood and Sand Festival. The festival involves members of the public and a sponsored artist constructing sculptures out of beach debris. Driftwood and Sand originated in beach festival run by Hokitika artist Donald Buglass in November 2002, and it has been run as an annual festival since 2003.

The Hokitika Museum is housed in the town&#x27;s Carnegie library building. The Hokitika Sock Machine Museum in Revell Street has on display a collection of antique sock-knitting machines. Visitors are invited to knit their own socks. Hokitika also has a modern library, thriving community groups, and many excellent artists.

===Marae===
Arahura Marae is located near Hokitika. It is a marae (tribal meeting ground) of Ngāi Tahu and its Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Waewae branch, and includes the Tūhuru wharenui (meeting house).

In October 2020, the Government committed $161,131 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae, and create four jobs.

==Transport==
===Road===
 passes through the town.

===Rail===
The first rail transport was the Hokitika &amp; Kanieri Tramway laid with wooden rails was established in 1868, with cars drawn by horses. A road followed in 1873.

A branch line railway known as the Hokitika Branch was established to the town from Greymouth in 1893, and an extension to Ross was open from 1909 to 1980.

Passengers to Hokitika were initially served by mixed trains that carried both goods and passengers. In 1936, these services were augmented by a Leyland diesel railbus service that ran from Hokitika to Greymouth, Christchurch, and briefly Reefton. In the early 1940s, the Vulcan railcars were introduced and they provided a twice-daily service between Ross and Christchurch via Hokitika. The mixed trains continued to operate until 1967, and all passenger services to Hokitika ceased when the Vulcan railcars stopped running past Greymouth in 1972. 

Since then, the line to Hokitika has been freight only with traffic primarily coming from Westland Milk Products.

===Shipping===

In 1865, after the discovery of gold in the area, the town became the official port of entry of the West Coast. A boom period ensued when Hokitika was second only to Auckland, with reports of over 40 ships in the harbour at one time, with more waiting offshore. It was a dangerous port, with 108 strandings and 32 ships lost from 1865 to 1867. The lack of nearby coal meant that the port declined rapidly along with the gold, though Hokitika remained an official entry port until the 1950s.

===Air===
Air New Zealand provides two flights a day to Christchurch. The Hokitika Airport is adjacent to the town, immediately to the north-east in the suburb of Seaview.

Hokitika&#x27;s Southside airfield was the base of Air Travel, New Zealand&#x27;s first airline. Air Travel carried passengers, mail and freight south from Hokitika to the glaciers and remote landing strips beyond Haast and north up to Westport. Its first scheduled flight was in December 1934. Directors were Hokitika residents: Bert Mercer, Paul Renton and Harry Newman.

After the second world war, Air Travel was nationalised and became part of NAC.

==Education==
A school was described as &quot;recently opened&quot; in Hokitika in 1875, and had nearly 350 students. The Hokitika District High School provided both primary and secondary education for the area for many years. Its name was changed in 1963 to Westland High School, which caters for years 7 to 13 and has a roll of .

Hokitika School is a contributing primary (years 1–6) school with a roll of .

St Mary&#x27;s School is a full primary (years 1–8) school with a roll of . It is a state integrated Catholic school and is connected with St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church.

<text>Stanley Greenspan (June 1, 1941 – April 27, 2010) was an American child psychiatrist and clinical professor of Psychiatry, Behavioral Science, and Pediatrics at George Washington University Medical School. He was best known for developing the floortime approach for attempting to treat children with autistic spectrum disorders and developmental disabilities.

He was Chairman of the Interdisciplinary Council on Developmental and Learning Disorders and also a Supervising Child Psychoanalyst at the Washington Psychoanalytic Institute. A graduate of Harvard College and Yale Medical School, Greenspan was the founding president of Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers, and Families and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health&#x27;s Clinical Infant Developmental Program and Mental Health Study Center.

==Career==
The developmental model Greenspan formulated guides the care and treatment of children and infants with developmental and mental health disorders, and his work has led to the formation of regional councils and networks in most major American cities.

He has been recognized internationally as a foremost authority on mental health and disorders in infants and young children, having received awards from both the American Psychiatric Association and the American Orthopsychiatric Association. In 1981, he received the Ittleson Prize, the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s award for child psychiatry research. He also received the Blanche F. Ittleson award from the American Orthopsychiatric Association for outstanding contributions to American mental health. In 2003, he received the Mary S. Sigourney Award for distinguished contributions to psychoanalysis. He has testified before Congress numerous times on policies affecting children and families.

Since 1975, he has written four monographs and 40 books including &quot;The Course of Life: Psychoanalytic Contributions to Understanding Personality Development&quot; with G. H. Pollock in 1980, with an update in 1989–90. He has also created two videos including &quot;First Feelings&quot;, which is an introduction to his orientation into social-emotional development. Both in the popular press and in peer-reviewed articles, he has written about a wide variety of subjects that affect human development.

He wrote a book &quot;The Four Thirds Solution: Solving the Childcare Crisis in America Today&quot;, which addresses how Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage supports child development.

Greenspan recently orchestrated and edited the writing of the &quot;Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual&quot; (PDM), a new manual intended to supplement the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&quot; (DSM) currently used to diagnose psychological disorders.

Greenspan&#x27;s years of studying child development at NIMH and subsequent work successfully treating children with social-emotional delays using the DIR model is described in detail in the memoir &quot;The Boy Who Loved Windows; Opening the Heart and Mind of a Child Threatened with Autism&quot; written by Patricia Stacey, the mother of one of his patients. . The book was based on an article Stacey wrote featuring Greenspan called &quot;Floor Time&quot; published in The Atlantic Monthly in February 2003.

Greenspan lived in Bethesda, Maryland, with his wife and co-author Nancy Thorndike Greenspan. He died on April 27, 2010, of complications of a stroke.

<text>Ben Macdui (, meaning &quot;MacDuff&#x27;s mountain&quot;) is the second-highest mountain in Scotland and all of the British Isles, after Ben Nevis, and the highest of the Cairngorm Mountains. The summit is above sea level and it is classed as a Munro. Ben Macdui is situated on the southwestern edge of the Cairngorm plateau, overlooking the Lairig Ghru pass to the west, and Loch Etchachan to the east. It lies on the boundary between the historic counties of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire.

Before the production of accurate maps of Scotland in the 19th century, it was not known for certain that Ben Nevis was the highest point in Britain, and it was often thought that Ben Macdui might be higher. Following surveys of both peaks in 1846–47, Ben Nevis was confirmed as the higher. The summit of the mountain has a direction indicator erected in 1925 by the Cairngorm Club of Aberdeen in memory of former president Alexander Copland. The indicator shows the directions of the most noteworthy mountains that can be seen from the summit in clear weather.

Snow patches have been known to persist at various locations on Ben Macdui, most notably Garbh Uisge Beag. The mountain is said to be haunted by the legendary Am Fear Liath Mòr (Big Grey Man).

After the defeat of Domnall mac Uilliam in 1187, Donnchad II, Earl of Fife, acquired Stratha&#x27;an, a territory stretching from Ballindalloch to Ben Macdui. Because the mountain marked the western boundary of Donnchad&#x27;s territory, Gaelic scholar historian F.C. Diack and place-name scholar Professor G.W.S. Barrow have suggested that the mountain took its name from Donnchad&#x27;s family, the Mac Duibh. Another suggestion is that the name comes from the Gaelic for &quot;black pig&quot;, , referring to its shape. A 19th-Century Ordnance Survey name book suggests the name signifies &quot;The Black Son mountain&quot;.

In 1810 a Rev Dr Keith surveyed the heights of several Cairngorm summits using a barometer, estimating the height of Ben Macdui to be . This sparked interest in whether it, or Ben Nevis, was the highest summit in Scotland. The Ordnance Survey built a trig point on the summit in 1847 in order to accurately survey the height, confirming that Ben Nevis was indeed the higher. The surveyors also built a small shelter that became known as the &quot;Sappers&#x27; Bothy&quot;, the remains of which can still be seen. Following these surveys, there were plans to build a cairn on top of Ben Macdui to make its height greater than Ben Nevis, but these plans did not come to fruition.

Queen Victoria hiked to the summit on 7 October 1859, aged forty. About her experience, she wrote: &quot;It had a sublime and solemn effect, so wild, so solitary – no one but ourselves and our little party there ... I had a little whisky and water, as the people declared pure water would be too chilling.&quot;

During the Second World War commando troops training in the Cairngorms visited the summit of Ben Macdui, building small shelters to the northeast of the summit. In early 1940 a plane crashed at the top of the Allt a&#x27; Choire Mhòir, to the northwest of the summit.

==Climbing==
Probably the easiest route of ascent is from the Coire Cas car park at the foot of Cairngorm Ski Centre by a path that leads up over slowly rising moorland. This route is about long; a somewhat longer route allows one also to climb Cairn Gorm. One possible alternative route follows the path coming up from Loch Etchachan. This loch may be reached from Loch Avon to the north or by coming up from Glen Derry to the south. Other routes include coming over Derry Cairngorm, or via the Lairig Ghru pass, which lies to the west of Ben Macdui.

Nearly all these routes are long days by Scottish standards. When coming from the south it is common to use a bicycle to cover the from the road end at Linn of Dee to Derry Lodge at the southern end of the massif.

==Am Fear Liath Mòr==
The area of Ben Macdui is said to be haunted by the legendary &quot;Am Fear Liath Mòr&quot; (&#x27;the Big Grey Man&#x27;) or &#x27;Greyman&#x27;. There have been several accounts of an unnatural presence, with mountaineer Norman Collie claiming to have heard footsteps before fleeing from the summit in terror.

<text>Decapitation is a military strategy aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of a hostile government or group.

== In nuclear warfare ==
In nuclear warfare theory, a decapitation strike is a pre-emptive first strike attack that aims to destabilize an opponent&#x27;s military and civil leadership structure in the hope that it will severely degrade or destroy its capacity for nuclear retaliation. It is essentially a subset of a counterforce strike but whereas a counterforce strike seeks to destroy weapons directly, a decapitation strike is designed to remove an enemy&#x27;s ability to use its weapons.

Strategies against decapitation strikes include the following:
* Distributed command and control structures.
* Dispersal of political leadership and military leadership in times of tension.
* Delegation of ICBM/SLBM launch capability to local commanders in the event of a decapitation strike.
* Distributed and diverse launch mechanisms.

A failed decapitation strike carries the risk of immediate massive retaliation by the targeted opponent. Many countries with nuclear weapons specifically plan to prevent decapitation strikes by employing second-strike capabilities. Such countries may have mobile land-based launch, sea launch, air launch, and underground ballistic missile launch facilities so that a nuclear attack on one area of the country will not totally negate its ability to retaliate.

Other nuclear warfare doctrines explicitly exclude decapitation strikes on the basis that it is better to preserve the adversary&#x27;s command and control structures so that a single authority remains that is capable of negotiating a surrender or ceasefire. Implementing fail-deadly mechanisms can be a way to deter decapitation strikes and respond to successful decapitation strikes.

== Conventional warfare, assassination and terrorist acts ==
Decapitation strikes have been employed in as a strategy in conventional warfare. The term has been used to describe the assassination of a government&#x27;s entire leadership group or a nation&#x27;s royal family.
*Assassination attempts on Volodymyr Zelenskyy
*The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq began with a decapitation strike against Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi military and political leaders. These air strikes failed to kill their intended targets.
*The U.S. and its NATO allies have, and continue to pursue this strategy in its efforts to dismantle militant Islamic fundamentalist networks, such as Al-Qaeda and ISIL, that threaten the United States and allies.
*September 17, 2024: 2024 Lebanon pager explosions A (suspected) Israeli supply-chain attack on Hezbollah communication devices. AR-924 model pagers distributed by GOLD APOLLO were filled with explosives and acquired by Hezbollah. The explosions have been theorized to be a decapitation strike and prelude to the potential invasion of Southern Lebanon by Israel during the Israel–Hezbollah conflict.

In recent warfare, unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are popularly used for decapitation strikes against terrorist and insurgent groups. Drones are most effective in areas with inadequate air defense. There are mixed scholarly opinions whether or not decapitation strikes via drones effectively degrade the capabilities of these groups.

Some military strategists, like General Michael Flynn, have argued that the experience gained by the American and Coalition military experience from fighting the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan was in support of kill or capture operations, but that they would be ineffective without a full understanding of how they would affect the local political landscape in the country.

Robert Pape has argued that decapitation is a relatively ineffective strategy. He writes that decapitation is a seductive strategy as it promises &quot;to solve conflicts quickly and cheaply with... little collateral damage, and minimal or no friendly casualties&quot;, but decapitation strikes frequently fail or are not likely to produce the intended consequences even if successful.

Counterterrorism theorists Max Abrahms and Jochen Mierau argue that leadership decapitation in a terrorist or rebel group has the tendency to create disorder within the group, but find decapitation ineffective because group disorder can often lead to politically ineffective, unfocused attacks on civilians. The two conclude that &quot;[t]his change in the internal composition of militant groups may affect the quality and hence selectivity of their violence.&quot; 

One tactic that is sometimes used to inform the target selection for decapitation strikes is social network analysis. This tactic involves identifying and eliminating higher ranked members in a hierarchically arranged rebel or terrorist group by targeting lower members first, and using intel gained in initial strikes to identify an organization&#x27;s leadership. Some strategists, like Generals David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, have also called for dedicated task units that are non-hierarchical and can be reorganized, in order to face similar distributed or decentralized terrorist groups. Others, however, argue that decapitation strikes combined with social network analysis are more than unproductive, but can prolong a conflict due to their habit of eliminating rebel or terrorist leaders who are the most capable peace negotiators or have the potential to advance communities hardest hit by terror campaigns after the cessation of hostilities.

<text>David A. Turner (26 January 1946 – 19 October 2023) was a British computer scientist. He is best known for designing and implementing three programming languages, including the first for functional programming based on lazy evaluation, combinator graph reduction, and polymorphic types: SASL (1972), Kent Recursive Calculator (KRC) (1981), and the commercially supported Miranda (1985).

Turner&#x27;s work on Miranda had a strong influence on the later Haskell. Turner first implemented SASL using the abstract SECD machine, but then reimplemented them in 1978 using SKI combinator calculus. This approach was used by Thomas Johnsson and Lennart Augustsson in the design of the g-machine that evolved to become the standard mechanism for lazy evaluation in call-by-need languages.

In 1981, Turner received the Doctor of Philosophy (D.Phil.) from the University of Oxford, for his dissertation &quot;Aspects of the Implementation of Programming Languages: The Compilation of an Applicative Language to Combinatory Logic&quot;, supervised by Christopher Strachey and Dana Scott. He held professorships at Queen Mary College, London, University of Texas at Austin and the University of Kent at Canterbury, where he spent most of his career and retained the title of Emeritus Professor of Computation.

Turner was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. He was also a member of the IFIP Working Group 2.8 on Functional Programming, which related to his creation of Miranda.

Turner was an emeritus professor at the University of Kent and Middlesex University in England.

Turner&#x27;s parents were second-generation Jewish immigrants, and Turner himself was a strong advocate for equal rights for Palestinians. He was an executive member of ICAHD UK and frequently spoke on the topic. Turner died on 19 October 2023, at the age of 77.

<doc id="1054394" wikidata="Q145506" url="?curid=1054394" title="Autothysis">
<text>Autothysis (from the Greek roots &quot;autos-&quot; &quot;self&quot; and &quot;thysia&quot; &quot;sacrifice&quot;) or suicidal altruism is the process where an animal destroys itself via an internal rupturing or explosion of an organ which ruptures the skin. The term was proposed by Ulrich Maschwitz and Eleonore Maschwitz in 1974 to describe the defensive mechanism of &quot;Colobopsis saundersi&quot;, a species of ant. It is caused by a contraction of muscles around a large gland that leads to the breaking of the gland wall. Some termites (such as the soldiers of &quot;Globitermes sulphureus&quot;) release a sticky secretion by rupturing a gland near the skin of their neck, producing a tar effect in defense against ants.

==Termites==
Groups of termites whose soldiers have been found to use autothysis to defend their colonies include: &quot;Serritermes serrifer&quot;, &quot;Dentispicotermes&quot;, &quot;Genuotermes&quot;, and &quot;Orthognathotermes&quot;. Several species of the soldierless Apicotermitinae, for example those of the &quot;Grigiotermes&quot; and &quot;Ruptitermes&quot; genera, have workers that can also use autothysis. This is thought to be one of the most effective forms of defense that termites possess as the ruptured workers block the tunnels running into the nest and it causes a one-to-one exchange between attackers and defenders, meaning attacks have a high energy cost to predators.

The soldiers of the Neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defense strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When outside the nest they try to run away from attackers, and only use autothysis when in the nest to block tunnels up, preventing attackers entering.

Old workers of &quot;Neocapritermes taracua&quot; develop blue spots on their abdomens that are filled with copper-containing proteins (blue laccase). These react with a secretion from the labial gland upon autothysis to form a mixture which is toxic to other termites.

==Ants==
Some ants belonging to the genera &quot;Camponotus&quot; and &quot;Colobopsis&quot; have adapted to using autothysis as an altruistic defensive trait to better fight against arthropods and to possibly deter vertebrate predators for the benefit of the colony as a whole. These ants use autothysis as a self-destructive defense to protect their territory, but they use it differently from termites, in that their primary uses for autothysis do not include blocking the tunnels of their territory from attackers, but more so for combat purposes during territorial battles.

Early ants used mechanical means of stinging to defend themselves, but the stings showed to be more useful against large vertebrate predators and not as successful against other arthropods. So selection for autothysis in ants evolved as a way to more effectively kill arthropod enemies. The products of autothysis in ants are sticky and corrosive substances, released by the ants&#x27; contraction of their gasters, leading to a burst at an intersegmental fold as well as the mandibular glands. The ants use this self-sacrifice to kill one or more enemies which entangle themselves in this sticky substance. The worker ant has been observed to wrap itself around an opponent, placing its dorsal gaster onto the opponent&#x27;s head before expelling sticky corrosive material from its mouth and gaster, permanently sticking to the opponent while killing itself and the enemy, as well as any other enemies that become stuck to the products.

These ants mostly use autothysis against other arthropods, like invading ant colonies or against termite colonies, and are rather ineffective towards larger vertebrate predators such as lizards or birds. This self-sacrifice is most useful against arthropods because the sticky adhesives in the products work best against the bodies of other arthropods. The compounds used in autothysis, however, have also been explained to have some use in deterring vertebrate predators from eating the ants, because these products are inedible.

<text>Fort Paull is a gun battery situated on the north bank of the Humber, near the village of Paull, downstream from Hull in northern England.

==History==
Batteries have been built at Paull by Henry VIII, Charles I during the Civil War during the siege of Hull and the Napoleonic Wars. The first fort built on the site was started in 1542 with a capacity for 12 guns. The current fort is of pentagonal design and was built in 1861–4 and on the recommendations of the Royal Commission, hence it is one of the Palmerston Forts.

===Armament===
The original emplacements, nineteen 64-pounder (29 kg) RML artillery pieces were concealed or demolished in 1894 when concrete emplacements for three 6-inch Breech Loading (BL) guns on hydropneumatic carriages and two 4.7-inch Quick Firing (QF) guns were built. A mining station was added in 1886 and searchlights followed in 1907. The three 6-inch gun positions were remodelled after 1902 to newer Mark VII types on central pivot mountings.

At the outset of the First World War, Paull was judged too close to Hull, so was disarmed when new forts were built at Sunk Island and Stallingborough. The fort was used as a training base between the wars, and during the Second World War, it was converted into a magazine to serve the Russian convoys; a degaussing station was also added.

==Present day==

In 1960, Fort Paull was released from the Ministry of Defence and closed down. In 1964, a group of volunteers, the Friends of Fort Paull took over the site and began to restore the fort as a heritage museum. Fort Paull finally opened to the public in 2000. Fort Paull housed a waxwork museum showing figures which have influenced the fort&#x27;s long history as well as an armoury showing various artillery pieces and armoured vehicles. The fort also played hosts to various military re-enactments from time to time.

Fort Paull was the location of the last remaining complete Blackburn Beverley heavy transport aircraft.

In January 2020, it was announced that the attraction would not be opening for the 2020 season.

The museum&#x27;s contents were auctioned on 19 September 2020. The contents auction raised a six-figure sum, the Blackburn Beverley bringing £21,000.

==Reopening==

In May 2024 a post on Facebook announced the site had been bought and would be undergoing works to reopen.
The post referenced the desire to bring the site back for future generations and start running events there again. It mentions they will be starting from scratch after a lot of the museum&#x27;s contents were auctioned off when it last closed. The attraction reopened on 28 September with a classic car weekend.

<text>Frank Bruce &quot;Doc&quot; Robinson (1886 – 19 October 1948) was an American New Thought author and spiritual leader. A pharmacist in Moscow, Idaho, Robinson was the son of an English Baptist minister. He studied in a Canadian Bible school but later rejected organized religion in favor of the New Thought Movement. In 1928, he founded the spiritual movement Psychiana. Robinson was also publisher of the &quot;Idahoan&quot; newspaper. Psychiana&#x27;s International Headquarters building still stands on 2nd Street, as does Robinson&#x27;s house on Howard Street. Robinson&#x27;s most lasting impact on Moscow and Latah County is the eponymous Robinson Park, for which he donated the land.

<text>Sharpe James (born February 20, 1936) is an American former politician from New Jersey. A Democrat, he served as the 37th mayor of Newark from 1986 to 2006 and as a state senator for the 29th legislative district from 1999 to 2008. He is the longest-serving mayor in Newark&#x27;s history and is a subject of the 2005 feature-film &quot;Street Fight&quot;, which depicts Newark&#x27;s 2002 mayoral election where James faced a closer-than-expected challenge from Cory Booker. Once a popular figure in New Jersey politics, his career effectively ended after he was convicted of high-profile corruption charges in 2008.

== Early life and education ==
James was born in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1936. He has been a resident of Newark since 1940. He graduated from South Side High School (since renamed as Malcolm X Shabazz High School), earned a B.A. in education from Montclair State University and a M.A. in physical education from Springfield College. He received the 1961 Department of Physiology Award from that school, and later completed postgraduate studies at Washington State University, Columbia University, and Rutgers University. He also served with the U.S. Army in Germany. In 1988, James was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Montclair State University, and, in 1991, an Honorary Doctorate from Drew University. Prior to politics, James worked as a teacher, athletic director and professor at Essex County College.

== Political career ==
===City council===
James was first elected to public office in 1970 as a South Ward Councilman. He was reelected to the council in 1974, defeating his sole opponent by a ten-to-one margin. He was elected to a third term in 1978, and in 1982 he became the first ward councilman elected to an at-large seat. As a councilman, he chaired New Jersey&#x27;s Black and Hispanic delegation. In 1977 he led an effort to halt landings of Concorde jets at Newark International Airport, claiming it would add to air and noise pollution in the area. In 1983, after talk show host Phil Donahue made comments about Newark being &quot;a place foreigners wouldn&#x27;t want to visit&quot;, James demanded an apology. In response, Donahue sent James a letter apologizing for the remark.

===Mayor of Newark===
On January 30, 1986, James announced he would run for Mayor of Newark to challenge four-term incumbent Kenneth A. Gibson. James won the May 13 election and was sworn into office on July 1 of that year. He was the first Newark mayor to run unopposed when he sought re-election in 1990 and handily won re-election in 1994 and 1998. James became Newark&#x27;s longest-serving mayor when he was re-elected for an unprecedented fifth term in 2002, a year after being named &quot;Mayor of the Year&quot; by the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. His 2002 reelection campaign, against then-Councilman Cory Booker, was documented in the 2005 feature film &quot;Street Fight&quot;. James faced scrutiny over a racist and homophobic statement involving a slur made to Booker during a public confrontation prior to election day, but still was victorious in the tense election.

James became known in his early years as mayor for often wearing jogging suits in public and making high-profile efforts to attract development to Downtown Newark. In 1997, Newark saw the completion of the acclaimed New Jersey Performing Arts Center. James became known as an example of &quot;machine politics&quot;. He had a reputation for questionable campaign tactics, including alleged use of the police force for his own purposes, intimidating supporters of his opponents and attacking his opponents&#x27; heritage.

In 1987 and 1988, James served as the New Jersey chairman of Jesse Jackson&#x27;s campaign for the 1988 Democratic Party presidential nomination. In December 1992, James was a member of the New Jersey State Electoral College, one of 15 electors casting their votes for the Clinton/Gore ticket.

In 1996, James&#x27;s chief of staff, Jackie Mattison, was charged in federal court with receiving over $17,000 in bribes from an insurance broker from Millburn. He was later sentenced to 41 months in federal prison. He was released in 2000.

In terms of housing, James&#x27; policy in the 1990s was to demolish Newark&#x27;s massive, but mostly abandoned, housing projects, and replace them with small-scale public housing or market rate middle class residences. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, James offered to assist nearby Jersey City in providing aid for New York City where the attacks occurred.

In 2006, James championed the relocation of the New Jersey Devils to the City of Newark. The Prudential Center is the newest arena in the Newark metropolitan area. On March 16, James filed for reelection as mayor, but announced eleven days later he would not seek a sixth term.

===State senate===
In June 1999, while serving as Mayor, James was appointed to the New Jersey Senate to fill out the unexpired term of the late Senator Wynona Lipman, and won election to that seat the following November. He was re-elected for a full term in November 2001 and continued to hold both offices. His Senate district encompassed part of Newark in Essex County and all of the Township of Hillside in Union County.

From 2002 to 2003, James served as Assistant Democratic leader of the senate, and from 2004 to 2005 he served as Assistant Senate Majority leader under Bernard Kenny. He became vice chairman of the Senate budget committee in 2004, serving in that position under Senator Wayne R. Bryant, who was indicted in March 2007 for corruption charges. On April 9, 2007, James announced he would not seek re-election to his State Senate seat.

== Corruption and abuse of power ==
=== Investigations and federal charges ===
In 2005, a New Jersey Open Public Records Act (OPRA) request was submitted asking that James hand over a City Hall-issued debit card he had received in 2002. The OPRA request showed that James had spent over $70,000 with the card for personal expenses over a two-year period. In August 2006, an OPRA request further revealed that James had spent over $80,000 with a credit card provided by the Newark Police Department for several vacations, including a $6,500 vacation to Rio de Janeiro in June of that year. On August 21, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office, led by U.S. Attorney Chris Christie, issued subpoenas for debit and credit card records for further information. In a response, James claimed no wrongdoing, and explained that, &quot;as the last of the civil rights mayors in America, I had to travel and sell this city and the world about the Newark success story&quot;. In September, federal authorities began their own investigation into potential wrongdoing committed by James.

In March 2007, federal investigators subpoenaed documents between James and Tamika Riley, his mistress and a former store operator, under accusations that James rigged the sale of city lots to Riley, who quickly resold them for hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit. The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office launched a separate investigation into these allegations later in June.

On July 12, James was indicted by a federal grand jury on 33 federal charges, namely mail fraud and conspiracy. In a press conference regarding the indictment, Christie alleged that James rigged the sale of nine city lots to Riley in a &quot;cut-rate scheme&quot; between 2001 and 2005. Later, he further alleged that James had also misused city-issued credit cards for himself and eight women during out-of-state vacations between 2001 and 2006. At his arraignment, James pleaded not guilty.

=== Trial and conviction ===
On February 26, 2008, James&#x27; trial was opened. His lawyers maintained that James had not violated federal law. In the first week, prosecutors presented a video tape of James testifying about Senate Bill 967, which was legislation he sponsored in 2004 to amend the Faulkner Act, with them alleging that James urged the passage of the bill so he could increase his power and illegally benefit himself. The defense counter-argued that James was acting properly in his capacity as a senator and should have enjoyed immunity.

On March 5, prosecutors presented more than a dozen memos from James regarding the land deals, which revealed that he had been monitoring whether city developers he was acquainted with were getting a chance to buy the lots. To prove this, prosecutors called up James&#x27; longtime secretary Rose Marie Posella, who testified that James met routinely with developers in his Newark City Hall office. She also testified that Tamika Riley had privileged access to James and that City Hall officials were aware they were having an affair. On April 1, the defense called up former councilwoman Gayle Chaneyfield Jenkins, who testified that the city council set a uniform price for city-owned land for redevelopers and that James had not been involved in the process.

The jury began deliberations on April 8 and on April 16 they found James guilty on all counts. On May 12, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office announced that the remaining charges against James for his misuse of city-issued credits cards had been dropped, thus sparing him of a second trial. On July 23, Judge Bill Martini upheld the convictions, and on July 29, James was sentenced to 27 months in prison and was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Originally, prosecutors urged for a 15-to-20 year sentence for James, but Martini argued that James&#x27; years as a public servant played a role in the more lenient sentence. Tamika Riley was also found guilty on those five counts and eight others, including tax evasion. In September 2008, the Federal Bureau of Prisons denied James&#x27; request to serve his sentence at a federal prison in Fort Dix and instead reported him to FCI Petersburg in Virginia.

=== Release from prison and lawsuits ===
In June 2009, James&#x27; attorney Alan Bowman attempted to convince an appellate court to expunge the convictions, although his efforts failed. On April 6, 2010, James was granted early release after 18 months served. As per a court order, he was banned from running for elected office for the remainder of his career. Seven days after his release, James filed an appeal to reverse his convictions. In September 2010, one of his convictions was overturned, but the four remaining convictions were left unchanged. He further appealed seeking to overturn the convictions due to a juror being dishonest; this appeal was dismissed in February 2013.

In 2011, the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission filed a lawsuit against James alleging that he and his campaign treasurer, Cheryl Johnson, improperly used about $94,000 in campaign funds to pay for legal fees. On August 17, 2012, the New Jersey Superior Court ruled in favor of the commission and ordered that both James and Johnson had to pay the money back. In January 2015, a state appeals court struck down an appeal by James and upheld the higher court&#x27;s ruling.

== Post-conviction career ==
In 2013, James published a 17-chapter book titled &quot;Political Prisoner&quot;, which he had written in prison. That same year, he advised the election campaign of his son John Sharpe James, who won a seat on the Municipal Council of Newark. That same year James endorsed Cory Booker, a former foe he had defeated in the 2002 Newark mayoral race, in the special election for U.S. Senator to replace the late Frank Lautenberg.

In 2022, James attempted to run for office as an at-large candidate for Newark City Council despite a court order banning him from running a public elected office. His certification was denied by Newark City Clerk Kenneth Louis on March 3, 2022. James attempted to sue after his candidacy was rejected, arguing that while he was prohibited from holding public office, running as a candidate was not prohibited. A judge dismissed his suit and James declined to appeal the dismissal.

<doc id="1054413" wikidata="Q2879007" url="?curid=1054413" title="Finncon">
<text>Finncon is the largest science fiction convention in Finland and, with up to 15,000 participants, one of the largest SF conventions in Europe. Finncon is unique among SF conventions because it has no ticket/membership fee, and is funded primarily on various cultural grants as well as income from traders. The event is organised annually in different cities in Finland.

From 2003 to 2009 and in 2011 the convention included the anime convention Animecon, which boosted the convention&#x27;s attendance and public visibility significantly. Since then the conventions have separated, and the future of the Finnish Animecon is currently uncertain beyond the 2011 combined Finncon-Animecon.

Finncon 2021 was cancelled due to logistical difficulties of conducting a large scale event during the COVID-19 pandemic while adhering to the event&#x27;s ethos and criteria of being open to international communities.

Finncon alternates between different cities in Finland without a formal rota. Recently the event has been held almost every year, but occasionally a year is skipped if no city is found to host the event that year.

<text>William Hayley (9 November 174512 November 1820) was an English writer, best known as the biographer of his friend William Cowper.

==Biography==
Born at Chichester, he was sent to Eton in 1757, and to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in 1762; his connection with the Middle Temple, London, where he was admitted in 1766, was merely nominal. In 1767 he left Cambridge and went to live in London. His private means enabled Hayley to live on his patrimonial estate at Eartham, Sussex, and he retired there in 1774. The location of this house in Eartham is now occupied by the Great Ballard School.

So great was Hayley&#x27;s fame that on Thomas Warton&#x27;s death in 1790 he was offered the laureateship, which he refused. In 1792, while writing the &quot;Life&quot; of Milton, Hayley made Cowper&#x27;s acquaintance. A warm friendship sprang up between the two which lasted till Cowper&#x27;s death in 1800. Hayley indeed was mainly instrumental in getting Cowper his pension. In 1800 Hayley also lost his natural son, Thomas Alphonso Hayley, to whom he was devotedly attached. He had been a pupil of John Flaxman&#x27;s, to whom Hayley&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Sculpture&quot; (1800) is addressed. Flaxman introduced William Blake to Hayley, and after the latter had moved in 1800 to his marine hermitage at Felpham, Sussex. Blake settled near him for three years to engrave the illustrations for the &quot;Life of Cowper&quot;. This, Hayley&#x27;s best known work, was published in 1803–1804 (Chichester) in 5 vols.

Hayley died at Felpham on 12 November 1820. His library was sold at auction by Evans, in London, on 13 February (and twelve following days), in 2649 lots. A copy of the catalogue is at Cambridge University Library (Munby.c.123(4)).
==Works==
Hayley had already written occasional poems, when in 1771 his tragedy, &quot;The Afflicted Father&quot;, was rejected by David Garrick. In the same year his translation of Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;Rodogune&quot; as &quot;The Syrian Queen&quot; was also declined by George Colman. Hayley won the fame he enjoyed amongst his contemporaries by his poetical &quot;Essays and Epistles&quot;; a &quot;Poetical Epistle to an Eminent Painter&quot; (1778), addressed to his friend George Romney, an &quot;Essay on History&quot; (1780), in three epistles, addressed to Edward Gibbon; &quot;Essay on Epic Poetry&quot; (1782) addressed to William Mason; &quot;A Philosophical Essay on Old Maids&quot; (1785); and the &quot;Triumphs of Temper&quot; (1781). The last-mentioned work was so popular as to run to twelve or fourteen editions; together with the &quot;Triumphs of Music&quot; (Chichester, 1804) it was ridiculed by Byron in &quot;English Bards and Scotch Reviewers&quot;. His 1789 tragedy &quot;Marcella&quot; was performed at Drury Lane.

In 1805 he published &quot;Ballads founded on Anecdotes of Animals&quot; (Chichester), with illustrations by Blake, and in 1809 &quot;The Life of Romney&quot;. For the last twelve years of his life Hayley received an allowance for writing his &quot;Memoirs&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2007, the exhibition &quot;Poets in the Landscape: the Romantic Spirit in British Art&quot; curated by Simon Martin and held at Pallant House Gallery in Chichester explored Hayley&#x27;s role as patron and friend of artists including William Blake, George Romney, John Flaxman and Joseph Wright of Derby.
It was appropriate that the gallery&#x27;s new wing is situated on 8 North Pallant, which formed part of the house in which Hayley was born. A portrait of Hayley by George Romney is currently on long-term display in the gallery.

==Family==
In 1769 Hayley married Eliza Ball (1750-1797), daughter of Thomas Ball, dean of Chichester. Eliza Ball Hayley was a translator and an essayist. She translated into English two essays by the French essayist Anna Thèrese de Lambert (1647 – 1733), &quot;Traité de l’Amitié&quot; (1732) and &quot;Traité de la Vieillesse&quot; (1732), published in 1780 as &quot;Essays on Friendship and Old Age by the Marchioness de Lambert&quot;. Sixteen years later she published an original essay, &quot;The Triumph of Acquaintance over Friendship: an Essay for the Times&quot; (1796). She died in 1797; after being separated from William since 1789. He attributed the mental illness she suffered as reasoning for the separation. He married in 1809 Mary Welford, but they also separated after three years. He left no child.

<text>Fort Perch Rock is a former defence installation situated at the mouth of Liverpool Bay in New Brighton. Built in the 1820s to defend the Port of Liverpool, it is now a tourist attraction and museum. It has been used as a venue for musical concerts and has been listed as a Grade II* Listed Building. The Fort&#x27;s cafe &quot;The Mess&quot; is open daily from 9 am. A World War 2 escape room concept &quot;Escape The Fort&quot; runs within the fort. 

==History==
Fort Perch Rock is a coastal defence battery built between 1825 and 1829, with the foundation stone being laid in 1826. It was built to protect the Port of Liverpool and proposed as a fortified lighthouse to replace the old Perch Rock Light; however, a separate lighthouse was built. The fort was built on an area known as Black Rock, and was cut off at high tide. However, coastal reclamation has made it fully accessible.

The Fort covers an area of about , with enough space for 100 men. It was built with red sandstone from the Runcorn quarries. The height of the walls ranges from to , and the towers are high. The Fort originally had a drawbridge, and a Tuscan portal which bore the coat of arms and the words &#x27;Fort Perch Rock&#x27;. At one point it was armed with 18 guns, of which 16 were 32-pounders, mounted on platforms. It was nicknamed the &#x27;Little Gibraltar of the Mersey&#x27;.

The foundation stone reads:

&quot;This foundation stone of the Rock Perch Battery, projected by and under the direction of John Sikes Kitson, Esquire, Captain in the Royal Engineers, for the defence of the port was laid on 31st March 1826 by Peter Bourne, Esquire, Mayor of Liverpool in the 7th year of the reign of His Majesty George IV. His Grace, the Duke of Wellington , Master General of the Ordnance.&quot;
The projected cost of building was £27,065.0s.8d. Kitson ensured that this budget was not exceeded, finishing the fort for a total cost of £26,965.0s.8d.

==Modern use==

In the late 1970s, the fort could be hired as a party venue. During this time Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark founder members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys played there as members of the short lived Wirral group The Id. Since the 1990s, the fort has played host to various musical events including, in the summer of 2006, a number of rock concerts which were organised by a group of young Wallaseyans. The nights were called &quot;Nautical&quot; and were featured in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and named &quot;The NME&quot; club of the week for the 1 September 2006 show, which featured British Sea Power and the Tiny Dancers.

The fort features a museum with displays including military aviation, maritime history. Previously, the Fort Perch Rock Marine Radio Museum used to exhibit marine wireless communications devices. The &quot;Escape The Fort&quot; escape room opened in 2022 and is available for bookings daily. In spring 2022, The Mess cafe opened within the Fort and is open daily from 9 am. 

==In literature and the arts==

In the poetical illustration &#x27;The Black-Rock Fort and Lighthouse&#x27;, by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to an engraving of a painting by Samuel Austin, she imagines the beacon light as a welcoming sight to voyagers returning home to England.

<text>Topic Records is a British folk music label, which played a major role in the second British folk revival. It began as an offshoot of the Workers&#x27; Music Association in 1939, making it the oldest independent record label in the world.

==History==
The label began as an offshoot of the communist led Workers&#x27; Music Association in 1939, selling Soviet and left-wing political music by mail order. After a period of relative inactivity in the Second World War, production resumed in the later 1940s, moving towards traditional music for the emerging revival market. Up to 1949 the composer Alan Bush was involved with choral and orchestral music released on the label. Topic also produced some of the first American blues records to be commercially available in Britain. From about 1950 the two key figures of the second revival, Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd, became heavily involved, producing several records of traditional music. One of the earliest albums of UK traditional music was &quot;Street Songs and Fiddle Tunes of Ireland&quot; by Margaret Barry and Michael Gorman, issued in 1958.

With the decline of British Communist Party membership in the late 1950s, financial aid to the label began to dry up and, under director Gerry Sharp, they were forced to pursue an entrepreneurial strategy to survive. In the early 1960s, Topic Records separated from the Workers&#x27; Music Association, but those involved still had socialist credentials. A new company was registered in 1963. Financially, the company was in a precarious state until that year, when they had substantial sales from the album &quot;The Iron Muse&quot;, a ground-breaking thematic programme of industrial folk songs. This success allowed them to produce a greater and wider range of records until tastes began to radically change again in the 1970s.

After the arrival of managing director Tony Engle, Topic released a series of albums by ground breaking artists including Nic Jones, Dick Gaughan, The Battlefield Band, as well as major figures on the folk scene including Martin Carthy and Roy Harris. They also began to reissue their back catalogue on cd. In the late 1990s, with the resurgence of traditional folk, spearheaded by children of the revival like Eliza Carthy, Topic managed to gain both commercial and critical success. In the inaugural BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards in 2000 the label received the Good Tradition Award in recognition of their role in the folk music movement.

Other major figures who recorded for Topic included Peggy Seeger, The Watersons, Shirley Collins, June Tabor and John Tams. The breadth of the Topic catalogue was evident in the release of &quot;The Voice of the People&quot; (1998), a twenty-part series sampling the earliest and greatest of folk singers of the British Isles.

In 2009, the label celebrated 70 years of activity with the release of a seven-CD hardback book set entitled &quot;Three Score &amp; Ten - A Voice To The People&quot;.

In 2012, this venerable old label began to re-release many of the LPs from its early catalogue in digital form. However, in a departure from the norm, it accompanied the music with a digital booklet containing all the original artwork and sleeve notes from the original album. These are downloadable free from their website.

Tony Engle went into semi-retirement in 2012, and the day-to-day running of the label was taken over by David Suff. In an interview in early 2017, Suff explained that he would also be entering semi-retirement in February 2017, and that the everyday management of the label would be handed over to Proper Records.

==Anniversaries==
The label&#x27;s 70th anniversary was marked by the issue of a boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten, A Voice to the People&quot; consisting of a 108-page book and 7 CDs from their back catalogue. Alexis Petridis said in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;not bad for a Marxist party offshoot that started in a basement&quot;.

The label&#x27;s 75th anniversary was marked on 23 August 2014 with a special concert at the 50th Towersey Village Festival, near Thame in Oxfordshire. Artists performed songs from the Topic catalogue, and included Norma Waterson, Eliza Carthy &amp; the Gift Band, Lau, Fay Hield, Martin Carthy, Saul Rose, Blair Dunlop, Josienne Clarke and Ben Walker.

<doc id="1054457" wikidata="Q1445276" url="?curid=1054457" title="Franklin Raines">
<text>Franklin Delano Raines (born January 14, 1949), also known as Frank Raines, is an American business executive. He is the former chairman and chief executive officer of the Federal National Mortgage Association, commonly known as Fannie Mae, who served as White House budget director under President Bill Clinton. His role leading Fannie Mae has come under scrutiny. He has been called one of the &quot;25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis&quot; according to &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Raines was born in Seattle, Washington, the son of a janitor. Raines graduated from Harvard College, Harvard Law School; and Magdalen College, Oxford University, as a Rhodes Scholar.

==Career==
In 1969, Raines first worked in national politics, preparing a report for the Nixon administration on the causes and patterns of youth unrest around the country related to the Vietnam War. He served in the Carter Administration as associate director for economics and government in the Office of Management and Budget and assistant director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff from 1977 to 1979. Then he joined Lazard Freres and Co., where he worked for 11 years and became a general partner. In 1991 he became Fannie&#x27;s Mae&#x27;s vice chairman, a post he left in 1996 in order to join the Clinton Administration as the director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, where he served until 1998. In 1999, he returned to Fannie Mae as CEO.

On December 21, 2004, Raines accepted what he called &quot;early retirement&quot; from his position as CEO while U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigators continued to investigate alleged accounting irregularities. He was accused by The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulating body of Fannie Mae, of abetting widespread accounting errors, which included the shifting of losses so senior executives, such as himself, could earn large bonuses.

In 2006, the OFHEO announced a suit against Raines in order to recover some or all of the $90 million in payments made to Raines based on the overstated earnings, initially estimated to be $9 billion but have been announced as $6.3 billion.

Civil charges were filed against Raines and two other former executives by the OFHEO in which the OFHEO sought $110 million in penalties and $115 million in returned bonuses from the three accused. On April 18, 2008, the government announced a settlement with Raines together with J. Timothy Howard, Fannie&#x27;s former chief financial officer, and Leanne G. Spencer, Fannie&#x27;s former controller dismissing its charges. The three executives maintained their denial of the charges but agreed to the payment of fines totaling about $3 million, which were paid by Fannie&#x27;s insurance policies. Raines also agreed to donate to charity the proceeds from the sale of $1.8 million of his Fannie stock newly issued to him by the company and to give up stock options, which were valued at $15.6 million when issued. The stock options however had no value. The OFHEO press release said Raines also gave up an estimated $5.3 million of &quot;other benefits&quot; said to be related to his pension and forgone bonuses. Raines denied that he gave up any such benefits or paid any money out of pocket for the settlement.

A 2008 editorial in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called it a &quot;paltry settlement&quot; which allowed Raines and the other two executives to &quot;keep the bulk of their riches&quot;. In 2003 alone, Raines&#x27;s compensation was over $20 million.

A statement issued by Raines said of the consent order, it &quot;is consistent with my acceptance of accountability as the leader of Fannie Mae and with my strong denial of the allegations made against me by OFHEO&quot;.

The OFHEO charges were repeated in a class action securities fraud lawsuit filed on September 23, 2004, by the Ohio Attorney General on behalf of Ohio state pension funds and other investors. On September 20, 2012, Federal District Court Judge Richard Leon granted summary judgment to Raines and dismissed him from the suit. The judge noted that over its eight-year history &quot;the parties produced nearly 67 million pages of documents, deposed 123 fact witnesses, and engaged 35 expert witnesses&quot;. Despite all of that discovery, Judge Leon found, &quot;plaintiffs have not identified any evidence that Raines knew or, indeed had any reason to know, that Fannie Mae&#x27;s accounting violated GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles). Further, plaintiffs have not identified any evidence that Raines intentionally misled investors through his statements concerning the implementation and operation of these accounting policies.&quot; The judge also refused to give any credence to the original OFHEO reports. He wrote, &quot;the OFHEO reports were part of an effort to prepare administrative charges against the individual defendants and raise substantial questions of trustworthiness.&quot; (Memorandum Opinion September 20, 2012, Judge Richard Leon, United States District Court for the District of Columbia, In re Fannie Mae Securities Litigation MDL No. 1668, Consolidated Civil Action No. 04-1639)

In a settlement with OFHEO and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fannie paid a record $400 million civil fine. Fannie, which is the largest American financier and guarantor of home mortgages, also agreed to make changes in its corporate culture and accounting procedures and ways of managing risk. The SEC and the Justice Department never brought any charges against Raines.

In June 2008, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Franklin Raines was one of several people who may have received below market rates loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation considered the officeholders &quot;FOA&#x27;s&quot;--&quot;Friends of Angelo&quot; (Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo). But the article acknowledged that it had insufficient data to confirm whether the rates were below market. He received loans for over $3 million while CEO of Fannie Mae. Raines has denied that he received any loan terms from Countrywide other than those for which he qualified based on his credit standing.

== Role in the subprime mortgage crisis ==

Whether the GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises) caused or greatly contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 is controversial. The overwhelming consensus of those who have examined the issue find that their connection in to the crisis was minor at best. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) completed its analysis of the financial crisis and found that the GSE&#x27;s &quot;contributed to the crisis, but were not a primary cause&quot;. There was a strong dissent by one member of the commission. The FCIC found that the GSE&#x27;s were late to the subprime lending game, entering the market in a substantial way in 2005. The GSE&#x27;s followed rather than led the race to purchase subprime loan securities. The GSE&#x27;s increased their involvement in the subprime securitization market because they were significantly losing market share and were feeling less relevant in the mortgage lending marketplace.
In accordance with the mission of Fannie Mae to enable home ownership by a greater proportion of the population, Franklin Raines, while chairman and CEO, began a pilot program in 1999 to ease credit requirements on loans that Fannie Mae purchased from banks. Raines promoted the program saying that it would allow consumers who were &quot;a notch below what our current underwriting has required&quot; to get home loans. The move was intended in part to increase the number of minority and low income home owners.

The &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot; editorial staff has noted that the expansion of easy credit to home buyers with a lesser ability to pay them back was one of the major contributing factors to the subprime mortgage crisis. Raines himself stated before Congress, &quot;In 1994, we launched our trillion-dollar commitment, a pledge to provide $1 trillion in financing for 10 million underserved families before the decade was over ... In 2000 ... we launched a redoubled new pledge ... to provide $2 trillion for 18 million underserved families before this decade is over. ... we are one of the best capitalized financial institutions in the world, when compared to the risk of our business ... these assets are so riskless that their capital for holding them should be under 2 percent.&quot;

While the Fannie Mae pilot program described above sought to expand housing opportunities for under-served consumers, these loans did not result in major losses and performed significantly better than private label subprime loans. Phil Angelides, the chair of the FCIC commented that &quot;the FCIC analyzed the performance of roughly 25 million mortgages outstanding at the end of each year from 2006 to 2009, and found that delinquency rates for the loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchased or guaranteed were substantially lower than for mortgages securitized by other financial firms. This holds true even for loans to borrowers with similar credit scores or down payments. For example, data compiled by the FCIC for a subset of borrowers with scores below 660 shows that by the end of 2008, far fewer GSE mortgages were seriously delinquent than non-GSE securitized mortgages: 6.2 percent versus 28.3 percent.&quot; Although under Raines, Fannie Mae invested in some securities backed by subprime loans, it didn&#x27;t start buying subprime and Alt-A loans directly (and bundling them into securities) until 2006 after Raines had left Fannie Mae. Purchasing of subprime and alt-A mortgages expanded under the guidance of Raines&#x27;s successor Daniel H. Mudd. (See also Subprime lending.)

On December 9, 2008, Raines testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Capitol Hill regarding Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and financial market instability.

== Alleged connection to Obama ==
On July 16, 2008 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Franklin Raines had &quot;taken calls from Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters&quot;. Also, in an editorial on August 27, 2008, titled &quot;Tough Decision Coming&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; editorial staff wrote that &quot;Two members of Mr. Obama&#x27;s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, are former chief executives of Fannie Mae.&quot; On September 18, 2008, John McCain&#x27;s campaign published a campaign ad that quoted &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporting regarding Raines and Obama. The ad also notes that &quot;Raines made millions and then left Fannie Mae while it was under investigation for accounting irregularities&quot;.

Neither Raines nor the Obama campaign had disputed the &quot;Post&quot; reporting before the ad. The text in question consisted of one sentence in each article. After McCain&#x27;s ad however, both denied that Raines was or had been a provider of advice to Obama or the Obama campaign.

In later commentary &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (the original source) described McCain&#x27;s attempts to connect Obama with Raines based on their reporting as &quot;a stretch&quot; and said all reporting they did about the matter actually stems from a single conversation a reporter had with Raines in which she recalls Raines said he &quot;had gotten a couple of calls from the Obama campaign&quot;. When the reporter queried Raines to the nature of the calls he said &quot;oh, general housing, economy issues&quot;.

Additionally, an email hoax falsely claimed that Raines was made &quot;chief economic advisor&quot; for the Obama presidential campaign.

<doc id="1054458" wikidata="Q734776" url="?curid=1054458" title="Country Life (Roxy Music album)">
<text>Country Life is the fourth studio album by English art rock band Roxy Music, released on 15 November 1974 by Island Records. It was released by Atco Records in the United States. The album is considered by many critics to be among the band&#x27;s most sophisticated and consistent.

&quot;Country Life&quot; peaked at number three on the UK albums chart. It also charted at number 37 in the US, becoming their first record to crack the top 40 in the country. The album includes Roxy Music&#x27;s fourth hit single, &quot;All I Want Is You&quot;, which, backed with the B-side &quot;Your Application&#x27;s Failed&quot;, reached number 12 on the UK singles chart. An edited version of &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot;, with the same B-side, was released in the US.

==Style and themes==
Band leader Bryan Ferry took the album&#x27;s title from the British rural lifestyle magazine &quot;Country Life&quot;.

The opening track, &quot;The Thrill of It All&quot;, is an uptempo rocker that builds on the style of previous Roxy Music songs such as &quot;Virginia Plain&quot; (1972) and &quot;Do the Strand&quot; (1973); it includes a quote from Dorothy Parker&#x27;s poem &quot;Resume&quot;: &quot;You might as well live&quot;. Eddie Jobson&#x27;s violin dominates the heavily-flanged production of &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, which became a live favourite. Esoteric musical influences are betrayed by the German oom-pah band passages in &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot;, the Elizabethan flavour of &quot;Triptych&quot; and the lighthearted, boogie-blues, Southern rock edge to &quot;If It Takes All Night&quot;.

&quot;Three and Nine&quot; has been likened to the whimsical songs of the Kinks&#x27; Ray Davies, with Ferry looking back nostalgically to a time of watching the moving pictures in cinemas in his youth, for the pre-decimalization price of 3 shillings and ninepence.

&quot;Casanova&quot; was singled out for praise by a number of critics as a more cynical and hard-rocking number than the usual Roxy Music fare. Like the earlier &quot;In Every Dream Home a Heartache&quot; (1973), it was seen as a critique of the hollowness of the contemporary jet set, and contained further instances of Ferry&#x27;s idiosyncratic word association (&quot;Now you&#x27;re nothing but / Second hand in glove / With second rate&quot;). A re-recorded version, more mellow than the original, appeared on Ferry&#x27;s 1976 solo studio album &quot;Let&#x27;s Stick Together&quot;.

The final track, &quot;Prairie Rose&quot;, is an ode to Texas and sometimes mistakenly thought as a reference to Jerry Hall. However, Ferry would not meet Hall until 1975.

==Cover art==
Shot by Eric Boman, the &quot;Country Life&quot; cover features two scantily clad models, Constanze Karoli (sister of Can&#x27;s Michael Karoli) and Eveline Grunwald (who was also Michael Karoli&#x27;s girlfriend). Bryan Ferry met them in Portugal and persuaded them to do the photo shoot as well as to help him with the words to the song &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot;. Although not credited for appearing on the cover, they are credited on the lyric sheet for their German translation work.

The cover image was controversial in some countries, including the United States and Spain, where it was censored for release. As a result, early releases in the US were packaged in opaque shrink wrap; a later American LP release of &quot;Country Life&quot; (available during the years 1975–80) featured a different cover shot. Instead of Karoli and Grunwald posed in front of some trees, the reissue used a photo from the album&#x27;s back cover that featured only the trees. In Australia, the album was banned in some record stores, while others sold each copy inside a black plastic sleeve. Author Michael Ochs has described the result as the &quot;most complete cover-up in rock history&quot;.

==Critical reception==

Jim Miller, in a 1975 review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;Stranded&quot; and &quot;Country Life&quot; together mark the zenith of contemporary British art rock.&quot;

In 2003, &quot;Country Life&quot; was ranked number 387 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was one of four Roxy Music studio albums that made the list (&quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;, &quot;Siren&quot; and &quot;Avalon&quot; being the others).

<doc id="1054460" wikidata="Q687153" url="?curid=1054460" title="William Martin Leake">
<text>William Martin Leake  (14 January 17776 January 1860) was an English soldier, spy, topographer, diplomat, antiquarian, writer, and Fellow of the Royal Society. He served in the British Army, spending much of his career in the Mediterranean seaports. He developed an interest in geography and culture of the regions visited, and authored a number of works, mainly about Greece.

==Life==
Leake was born in London to John Martin Leake and Mary Calvert Leake. Following a family tradition, he joined the British Royal Regiment of Artillery as an officer; he completed his training at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1794 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant. Having spent four years in the West Indies as lieutenant of marine artillery, he was promoted to captain, and was sent in 1799 by the government to Constantinople to train the forces of the Ottoman Empire in the use of artillery. The British Empire had decided to support the Ottoman in its defence against Napoleonic France. A journey through Asia Minor in 1800 to join the British fleet at Cyprus inspired him with an interest in antiquarian topography. In 1801, after travelling across the desert with the Turkish army to Egypt, he was, on the expulsion of the French, employed in surveying the Nile valley as far as the cataracts; but having sailed with the ship engaged to convey the Elgin marbles from Athens to England, he lost all his maps and observations when the vessel foundered off Cerigo in Greece.

For much of the first decade of the nineteenth century, Leake was employed by the Foreign Office to spy in Greece in the guise of a wandering tourist, with the intent of gathering topographical information which would be useful in the case of a French invasion. Shortly after his arrival in England, he was sent out to survey the coast of Albania and the Morea, with the view of assisting the Turks against attacks of the French from Italy, and of this he took advantage to form a valuable collection of coins and inscriptions and to explore ancient sites. In 1807, war having broken out between Turkey and England, he was made prisoner at Salonica; but, obtaining his release the same year, he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Ali Pasha of Ioannina, whose confidence he completely won, and with whom he remained for more than a year as British representative. He was there in 1809 when Lord Byron visited Ali&#x27;s court.

In 1810 he was granted a yearly sum of £600 for his services in Turkey. In 1815 he retired from the army, in which he held the rank of colonel, devoting the remainder of his life to topographical and antiquarian studies. He joined the learned Society of Dilettanti and became vice-president of the Royal Society of Literature. He was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society on 13 April 1815.

He died in Steyning, Sussex on 6 January 1860. The marbles collected by him in Greece were presented to the British Museum; his bronzes, vases, gems and coins were purchased by the University of Cambridge after his death, and are now in the Fitzwilliam Museum. He was also elected as a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, received the honorary DCL at Oxford in 1816, and was a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences and correspondent of the Institute of France.

==Works==
He authored:
*&quot;Researches in Greece&quot; (1814)
*&quot;The topography of Athens: With some remarks on its antiquities&quot; (1821)
*&quot;Journal of a tour in Asia Minor,: with comparative remarks on the ancient and modern geography of that country&quot; (1824)
*&quot;Travels in the Morea: With a map and plans&quot; (1830), and a supplement, &quot;Peloponnesiaca&quot; (1846)
*&quot;Travels in Northern Greece&quot; (1835)
*&quot;Numismata Hellenica&quot; (1854), followed by a supplement in 1859.

His &quot;Topography of Athens&quot;, the first attempt at a systematic treatment, long remained an authority.

<doc id="1054461" wikidata="Q1337010" url="?curid=1054461" title="Gary Megson">
<text>Gary John Megson (born 2 May 1959) is an English former football player and manager.

He has previously managed Norwich City, Blackpool, Stockport County, Stoke City, West Bromwich Albion, Nottingham Forest, Leicester City, Bolton Wanderers and Sheffield Wednesday. He guided West Brom to promotion in 2001–02 and 2003–04, both times from the First Division to the Premier League.

He is the son of Don Megson and the brother of Neil Megson, both former players.

==Playing career==
As a player, Megson was a tough-tackling defensive midfielder who played for nine different clubs. He began his career at Plymouth Argyle, where he impressed enough for Everton to sign him for a £250,000 transfer fee. Megson struggled to establish himself in the Everton line-up, and after two years at Goodison, he moved to Sheffield Wednesday, where his father had once played, for a fee of £130,000.

Megson immediately gained a place in Wednesday&#x27;s starting lineup, and was a member of the team that gained promotion to the top flight in 1983–84, ending a 14-year exile from the elite. In his three years at Hillsborough, he missed only three league games. In the summer of 1984, he was signed by Nottingham Forest, only for Brian Clough to decide &quot;he couldn&#x27;t trap a bag of cement&quot;. Megson spent five months at the City Ground, without making a single first-team appearance before being sold to Newcastle United.

Megson played regularly for the Magpies for the remainder of the 1984–85 season, but lost his place in the line-up the following season, and moved back to Sheffield Wednesday. In his second spell with the Owls, Megson again established himself as an important member of the squad, and was rarely out of the starting eleven. In January 1989, he moved to Manchester City, where he spent three and a half seasons, and helped City finish fifth in his final two seasons there, having helped them win promotion in his first season.

He then moved to Norwich City on a free transfer in the summer of 1992, and spent three seasons at Carrow Road. He was an important member of the Norwich side that finished third in the inaugural season of the Premier League and played in the UEFA Cup for the first time as a result. When manager Mike Walker moved to Everton in January 1994, he was also assistant to the new Norwich manager John Deehan.

When Deehan resigned in April 1995, Megson briefly took charge as caretaker manager, but failed to save City from the drop, losing four and drawing one of his five games in charge. In the summer, he also left Norwich and finished his playing career with short spells at lower division sides Lincoln City and Shrewsbury Town. In December 1995, he returned to Norwich when he was re-appointed manager following Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s sudden departure to Leicester City. He remained as manager at Carrow Road until the end of the season, when Mike Walker was appointed for the second time.

==Managerial career==

===Norwich City===
While still playing at Norwich City, Megson became assistant to manager John Deehan. When Deehan resigned as manager of Norwich on 9 April 1995, with Norwich heading for relegation after a terrible loss of form since Christmas, Megson stepped up to the manager&#x27;s seat for the remainder of the season, and had five games remaining to secure survival. However, Norwich collected just one point from their remaining games and were relegated. Martin O&#x27;Neill was appointed manager that summer, with Megson leaving the club to play for Lincoln City and then Shrewsbury, before joining Bradford City late in 1995 as assistant manager to Chris Kamara. However, by Christmas that year, he was back at Norwich as manager following the departure of Martin O&#x27;Neill to Leicester City. Norwich finished 15th in Division One that season and Megson then left the club as Mike Walker returned as manager.

===Blackpool===
In 1996, Megson became manager at Blackpool, where he recorded 21 wins in 52 matches – enough to stay clear of relegation to Division Three, but not quite enough for a playoff place and the chance of promotion to the Division One. At Bloomfield Road, he was assisted by the former Manchester United midfielder Mike Phelan, but the partnership failed to bring a Division Two playoff place to &quot;the Seasiders&quot;, and Megson left at the end of the season.

===Stockport County===
Megson moved to Stockport County in July 1997, shortly after Dave Jones&#x27; departure for Premier League Southampton. County had been runners-up in Division Two the season before, therefore started the new season in Division One. In Megson&#x27;s first season they performed admirably and they came just two places short of the Division One playoffs, with some excellent performances, including a 3–1 home win versus Manchester City. The following season was more disappointing and County finished in 16th place. Soon after he left Stockport by mutual consent.

===Stoke City===
Megson was not unemployed for long, taking the manager&#x27;s job at Stoke City in the summer of 1999 after the club missed out on Tony Pulis who instead joined Bristol City. Megson arrived at the club at a time when there was a great deal of pressure on the current board to sell the club to new owners. After a slow start to the 1999–2000 season results gradually improved and the team went on a ten match unbeaten run to haul them into the play-offs. However unfortunately for Megson by November the long-awaited takeover bid was accepted in the form of a group of Icelandic businessmen headed by Gunnar Gíslason. They appointed their own man, former Iceland national team manager Gudjon Thordarson.

===West Bromwich Albion===
Megson took over as manager of First Division West Bromwich Albion in March 2000, just days before the transfer deadline at the end of the 1999–2000 season. It was 14 years since Albion had been in the top flight of English football, and in that time they had spent their first ever spell (two seasons) in the third tier. Indeed, when Megson was appointed they were in real danger of a second relegation to that level. But he moved quickly to strengthen the team by bringing in several new players. In his first month in charge, Megson received a 28-day touchline ban following his comments to referee Graham Poll after Albion&#x27;s 2–0 defeat to Portsmouth. Megson was unhappy about a penalty that Poll had awarded to Portsmouth; some years later, Poll conceded that it was &quot;one of the worst penalties I&#x27;ve ever given&quot;. Albion nevertheless ensured their safety by winning their final game of the season.

The following season Megson took the club into the playoffs, winning the Division One Manager of the Month award for November 2000 along the way. Albion lost to Bolton Wanderers at the semi-final stage, but the following year the club won promotion to the Premier League for the first time, overcoming the eleven-point lead of their fierce local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers in the closing weeks of the campaign. This achievement earned Megson the Nationwide Division One Manager of the Year award, as well as the medieval title &quot;Lord of the Manor of West Bromwich&quot;. However, the club was barely prepared for the financial challenges of life in the top flight and a bitter quarrel soon developed between Megson and the club&#x27;s chairman Paul Thompson over what Megson perceived as the latter&#x27;s interference in footballing matters. An undignified public showdown resulted in Thompson resigning from the board in order to forestall Megson&#x27;s departure. The board elected Jeremy Peace as Thompson&#x27;s successor, and in July 2002 Megson signed a new three-year contract with Albion. However, in 2002–03 the club were relegated after just a single season in the Premier League.

Megson mounted a successful promotion campaign the following season, and a return to the Premier League – but by the summer of 2004, the relationship between Megson and Peace had become strained. By September, after a poor start to the season, Megson&#x27;s job appeared to be under threat. The following month Megson, whose contract was due to end in June 2005, announced that he would not sign a new deal if the club offered one. The board chose to interpret this as a resignation, and on 26 October Megson was dismissed. A settlement for the remainder of his contract was reached in November 2004.

===Nottingham Forest===
Within a week of being sacked at West Bromwich Albion, Gary Megson was linked with the manager&#x27;s job at Albion&#x27;s local rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers, which became vacant after Dave Jones was sacked – but that job went to Glenn Hoddle instead. On 10 January 2005, Megson was appointed to succeed Joe Kinnear as manager of struggling Nottingham Forest, but was unable to save them from slipping into the third tier of English football for the first time in more than half a century. Promotion back to the Championship was to be his priority for 2005–06, but Forest struggled, especially away from home, for most of the season. In terms of points they were nearer to the relegation zone than the playoff zone when he resigned in February 2006 after being put under a lot of pressure by the Forest fans. He claimed that his resignation had cost him £500,000.

In June 2007 Megson was appointed as a coach at Stoke City by manager Tony Pulis. He retained this role until his appointment as manager of Leicester City.

===Leicester City===
On 13 September 2007, Leicester City chairman Milan Mandarić announced Gary Megson as the new manager of the club, citing Megson&#x27;s &quot;wealth of experience&quot; as a deciding factor in the appointment. Leicester achieved their first League win under Megson on 6 October 2007 with a 2–0 win over Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough with goals from Gareth McAuley and an own goal by Akpo Sodje.

A month into Megson&#x27;s tenure at Leicester, Mandarić rejected an approach from Bolton Wanderers for the manager&#x27;s services. On 23 October however, Bolton announced that Megson was their first choice to become their new manager, and made a second approach for him. The club said they were also willing to compensate Leicester should Megson leave the Walkers Stadium. This second approach was also rejected by Milan Mandarić, but Megson was eventually given permission to speak to Bolton and he left Leicester on 24 October 2007, just 41 days and nine EFL Championship games after his appointment.

===Bolton Wanderers===
Megson took over as manager of Bolton Wanderers on 25 October 2007 in a two-and-a-half-year deal. He accepted that he was not the number one choice for the job, after Bolton had already had approaches for Steve Bruce and Chris Coleman rejected, and Graeme Souness had also ruled himself out. Bolton had made a poor start to the 2007–08 season under Sammy Lee, and when Megson took over they were bottom of the Premier League table with only 5 points from 10 games. Megson&#x27;s first game in charge was against Aston Villa on 28 October, and finished 1–1. He recorded his first win on 24 November when Bolton beat Manchester United, the champions and League leaders, 1–0; this was their first home victory over United for 30 years.

By the New Year Bolton were lying 16th in the Premier League table, but only two points ahead of Fulham who were 19th. In January 2008 they sold Nicolas Anelka to Chelsea for £15 million, and brought in no comparable replacement. In February 2008 however they beat Atlético Madrid (who at the time were lying fourth in La Liga) 1–0 on aggregate, winning 1–0 at home and drawing 0–0 away, to reach the last 16 of the UEFA Cup for the first time in the club&#x27;s history before proceeding to play the reserve team in Lisbon in the Last 16 with the tie tied at 1–1, Bolton lost the away leg 1–0. Megson picked a reserve side so that the first team were rested for Sunday&#x27;s relegation battle against Wigan Athletic. They proceeded to lose 1–0 to a ten-man Wigan side. Their League form remained poor, and a 4–0 defeat at Aston Villa on 5 April left them in 18th place, two points adrift of safety. But they proceeded to take 11 points from their last five games (including a 1–1 draw at Chelsea on the final day of the season) to secure survival in the Premier League – the first time Megson had achieved this as a manager.

Megson won the Premier League Manager of the Month award for November 2008. Heading into the 2008–09 season, he brought in players such as Johan Elmander for a club record £8.2m, Fabrice Muamba from Birmingham City for £5m, Mustapha Riga from Levante, Danny Shittu for £2m and Ebi Smolarek on a season-long loan from Racing Santander with a view to a permanent deal. Bolton started the season unremarkably and by October Bolton were looking set for another relegation scrap. This caused increasing pressure on Megson but he was given time by Chairman Phil Gartside and managed to improve results, leading Bolton to a high of eighth in the league. On 1 March 2009, it was announced that Megson had agreed a new rolling contract with Bolton. He celebrated his new contract with a 1–0 victory over Newcastle United. Bolton finished 13th in the 2008–09 season.

During the summer of 2009 Megson added to the Trotters&#x27; squad with the additions of Portsmouth midfielder Sean Davis on a free transfer, Hull City&#x27;s Welsh right-back Sam Ricketts, Aston Villa&#x27;s England international defender Zat Knight for £4m, veteran left-back Paul Robinson on loan from West Brom and the South Korean international Lee Chung-Yong. Just before the transfer window closed he added the Croatian international Ivan Klasnić from FC Nantes on a season long loan. In the 2009 season, under Megson&#x27;s tenure, he started the season in an inauspicious manner with defeats to Hull City and Sunderland before seeing excellent form in the next seven games. These games saw three wins, two draws and narrow defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool. After 25 October, Bolton lost five out of the next six games. The first three were losses by four goals and these were followed by a home defeat to Blackburn, a draw against Fulham and an away defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers. In a period which lasted almost fifty days without a win Bolton played Manchester City and were scheduled games against other relegation candidates including West Ham United, Wigan Athletic, Burnley and Hull City. In the four games that were played Bolton were leading them all but ended with only one win and three draws, leaving the club 18th out of 20 and with 18 points from 18 games.

On 30 December 2009, Bolton announced that Megson had been relieved of his duties as manager with immediate effect. Bolton Wanderers official club statement said; &quot;The decision has been taken in the light of the position the club finds itself in the Barclays Premier League at the halfway point of the season.&quot; It was later confirmed that as the club and their former manager could not agree a compensation deal Megson would be paid out the remainder of his rolling contract on a weekly basis, effectively putting him on a year&#x27;s garden leave. Over two years after being dismissed by Bolton, Megson complained that he had never won the fans over and hit out at the club&#x27;s supporters, claiming that they did not like him and he did not like them.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 4 February 2011, Megson was appointed manager of his former club, Sheffield Wednesday, replacing Alan Irvine who had been relieved of his post the previous day. On 29 February 2012, with the club third in League One, he was sacked. At the time of his sacking he had the third best win percentage of any manager in Sheffield Wednesday&#x27;s history. His last result before being sacked was a 1–0 victory over Sheffield United in the Steel City derby.

===Return to West Bromwich Albion===
Megson returned to West Bromwich Albion as an Assistant Head Coach to Tony Pulis in July 2017.

On 20 November 2017, he was named as the caretaker head coach of West Bromwich Albion &quot;until further notice&quot; after Tony Pulis was sacked. When Alan Pardew was appointed manager of the club, Megson departed.

== Coaching style ==
Darren Huckerby criticised Megson&#x27;s coaching style, when explaining why he chose to sign for Norwich City, instead of Megson&#x27;s West Bromwich Albion. &quot;I told him I didn&#x27;t like the way he coached, I didn&#x27;t like the way he shouted at his players and didn&#x27;t like the way he treated seasoned professionals like 15-year-olds. I was just being honest with him. I said: &#x27;I&#x27;ve seen you on the sidelines and you look like a crazed animal&#x27;&quot;. According to Huckerby, Megson&#x27;s response was that &quot;He told me that was how he had to work with his players&quot;.

<doc id="1054466" wikidata="Q5442556" url="?curid=1054466" title="Fellside Recordings">
<text>Fellside Recordings is a British independent record label, formed by Paul Adams and Linda Adams in 1976 in Workington, Cumbria, and still run by them.

Paul Adams toured semi-professionally with the Barry Skinner Folk Group in his teens. He and Linda married in 1974. Fellside started as a folk music label. They issued jazz under the name LAKE, and children&#x27;s records as &quot;small folk&quot;. Most of the Fellside catalogue was recorded and produced by Paul Adams. In 2007, BBC Radio celebrated the company with a programme called &quot;30 Years of Fellside&quot;. Three of their acts, John Spiers &amp; Jon Boden, Nancy Kerr &amp; James Fagan, and Kirsty McGee were nominated for BBC Folk Awards, and two of the acts were winners on the night. The label has won many awards including 12 from the Music Retailers Association. LAKE has won a BT British Jazz Award and Paul Adams was nominated for a BBC Jazz Award.

The Amazon website lists over 130 titles still in print, including albums by Spiers and Boden, Nancy Kerr &amp; James Fagan, Dr Faustus, 422, Fribo, Hughie Jones, A. L. Lloyd, Peter Bellamy, James Keelaghan, Clive Gregson, The Queensberry Rules, Jez Lowe, Last Orders, Bram Taylor, and Grace Notes. Their anthologies have included songs by Maddy Prior, Richard Thompson, Frankie Armstrong, John Kirkpatrick and Martin Carthy. Fellside, along with Topic Records, are the two most significant and longest serving record labels for traditional music in the UK.

On the jazz side, LAKE Records&#x27;s roster includes George Melly, Digby Fairweather, Ottilie Patterson, Phil Mason, John Hallam, The Fryer-Barnhart International All Star Jazz Band, The Savannah Jazz Band, Spats Langham, Debbie Arthurs and Keith Nichols.

In 2004, they started reissuing recordings from the defunct jazz label Record Supervision. This included the reissue of albums by Humphrey Lyttelton, Acker Bilk, Alex Welsh, Ken Colyer, Chris Barber, Terry Lightfoot, Sandy Brown, and Archie Semple. Singsong described this set of reissues as &quot;A milestone in British jazz&quot;. They have a &quot;Vintage&quot; Series as well as a series recorded at the Dancing Slipper Jazz Club in Nottingham in the 1960s.

<text>Cosenza (; Cosentian: &quot;Cusenza&quot;, ) is a city located in Calabria, Italy. The city centre has a population of approximately 70,000, while the urban area counts more than 200,000 inhabitants. It is the capital of the province of Cosenza, which has a population of more than 700,000.

The ancient town is the seat of the Cosentian Academy, one of the oldest academies of philosophical and literary studies in Italy and Europe. To this day, Cosenza remains a cultural hub, with several museums, monuments, theatres and libraries. The modern city is the centre of an urban agglomeration including, among others, the municipality of Rende, where the University of Calabria is located.

== Geography ==

Situated at the confluence of two historical rivers, the Busento and the Crati, Cosenza stands 238 m above sea level in a valley between the Sila and the coastal range of mountains. The old town, overshadowed by its Swabian castle, descends to the river Crati. The modern city lies to the north, beyond the Busento, on level ground.

Almost completely surrounded by mountains, Cosenza is subject to a microclimate scarcely influenced by the effects of the Mediterranean Sea. It experiences cold winters and hot summers.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The ancient Consentia (), capital of the Italic tribe of the Brettii, was a bulwark of the Italic people against the Hellenic influences of the Ionian colonies. It was in this province that the Battle of Pandosia was fought, in which a small Italic army composed of Brettii and Lucanians defeated the uncle of Alexander the Great, who was known as Alexander of Epirus. Over the centuries, Cosenza maintained a distinctive character, that marked it out among the cities of the region. Under Emperor Augustus, it became an important stopover on the Roman route via Popilia, which connected Calabria to Sicily. During the Roman Empire, the town benefited from municipal privileges.

=== Alaric&#x27;s legendary tomb ===
In 410 AD, Alaric I, king of the Visigoths, sacked the city of Rome, becoming the first foreign enemy to capture the city in more than 800 years. Alaric amassed a great amount of treasure during his conquest of Rome. According to the historian Jordanes, after sacking Rome Alaric headed south with his troops, advancing easily until reaching the area of Cosenza, where he died. No one is certain how this happened: Some believe he contracted a disease that took his life, while others feel that his death came from an attack by enemy forces. In any case, his troops honored their king by burying him in a tomb in Cosenza. His burial place is said to have been at the confluence of the Busento and Crathis rivers. A horde of slaves were used to divert the water from the Busento, allowing them to dig a tomb large enough for Alaric, his horse, and all of the treasure amassed from his conquests in Rome. Once the tomb was completed, the river was returned to its bed and the tomb covered with water. Then, to ensure that no one would reveal this location to anyone, Alaric&#x27;s troops killed all of the slaves.

In the centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, several towns in the province of Cosenza, most notably Rossano, refused to acknowledge the new governments of the Ostrogoths. Instead, they used their good fortune of having strong city walls and small Roman garrisons to hold out for centuries as semi-independent enclaves of the still extant Eastern Roman Empire in Italy.

=== Norman, Hohenstaufen, and Angevin period ===
Bitterly disputed between the Saracens and the Lombards, the town was destroyed, then rebuilt around 988; only to be ravaged again in the early eleventh century. In the attempt to escape the devastation, the population left the town and sheltered on the surrounding hills where they built some small hamlets (still denominated as, &quot;casali&quot;).

By the first half of the eleventh century, Lombard Calabria became a feudal dukedom of the Normans, with Cosenza as the capital. The town soon rebelled against the rule of Roger Guiscard and was recaptured only after a long siege. Subsequently, under the Hohenstaufen rule, the town became the seat of the Court of Calabria (&quot;Curia Generale&quot;). Emperor Frederick II had a particular interest in the town: he promoted construction and economic activities, organising an important annual fair.

Subsequently, Cosenza fought bitterly against the Angevin domination, supported by the clergy. While the uprising spread through the valley of the Crathis, the town was involved in the see-sawing fight between Angevins and the Crown of Aragon. In 1432, King Louis III of Anjou settled in the castle of Cosenza with his wife Margaret of Savoy. When he died untimely, in 1434, he was buried in the cathedral.

=== Spanish domination ===
In 1500, in spite of resistance, Cosenza was occupied by the Spanish army led by Captain Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. During the sixteenth century the town experienced a period of expansion as the seat of the Viceroy of Calabria. At the same time its cultural importance grew thanks to the foundation of the Accademia Cosentina; among its most renowned members were Bernardino Telesio, Aulo Gianni Parrasio, the Martirano brothers, Antonio Serra, and others.

In 1707, the Austrians succeeded the Spanish in the Kingdom of Naples, followed by the Bourbons. After the proclamation in 1799 of the short-lived Parthenopean Republic and a vain resistance, the town was finally occupied for the Bourbons by Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo&#x27;s &quot;Lazzari&quot;. Cardinal Ruffo was native of the province of Cosenza.

=== Modern age ===
From 1806 to 1815, Cosentians fought hard against French domination. Cruel suppressions characterised that period and it was a cradle of the Carbonari secret societies. In 1813, the town saw many rebels executed. The local riots of 1821 and 1837 heralded the Risorgimento. They were followed by the uprising of 15 March 1844, which reached its climax with the “noble folly” of the Bandiera Brothers, who were executed together with some of their followers in the Vallone di Rovito in Cosenza. In 1860, some months after the rapid and overwhelmingly heroic deeds of Garibaldi&#x27;s troops, a plebiscite proclaimed the annexation of Calabria to the new Kingdom of Italy.

=== Church of San Domenico ===


Founded in 1448, the Church of San Domenico combines Medieval and Renaissance architectural elements. Its most interesting feature is the rose window defined by 16 little tuff columns. The wooden portal (1614) is inlaid with floral motifs, figures of saints, and coats of arms.

Inside the church are works by the sanfilese painter Antonio Granata, such as the canvas depicting the Madonna of the Rosary between Saints Dominic and Agnese da Montepulciano preserved in the ancient choir used today as a sacristy in the church (late eighteenth century). The high altar is made of polychrome marble (1767). In the transept, there is a &quot;Deposition&quot; and a &quot;San Vincenzo Ferreri&quot; (late eighteenth century, anonymous). The sacristy is noted for its ribbed vault, a double lancet window with a narrow arch, and a wooden choir installed in 1635.

=== The Cathedral ===
The exact origins of the Duomo (&quot;Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta&quot;) are unknown; it was probably built during the first half of the eleventh century. An earthquake destroyed the cathedral on 9 June 1184, and rebuilding was completed by 1222, when the cathedral was consecrated by Emperor Frederick II. At some point during the first half of the eighteenth century the church was covered by a baroque superstructure that obliterated the original structure and its works of art. In the first half of the nineteenth century the façade was transformed in neo-gothic style, which completely changed its character. At the end of the nineteenth century, Archbishop Camillo Sorgente entrusted restoration work to Pisanti, who recovered the original old arches and the ancient structure of the church. In the 1940s the work was finally completed.

The tomb of Isabella of Aragon, wife of king Philip III of France is in the transept. A long aisle links the Duomo to the palace of the archbishop, the &quot;Palazzo Arcivescovile&quot;, which houses an &quot;Immacolata&quot; by Luca Giordano. One can also see a rare and precious &quot;Stauroteca&quot;. A Stauroteca is a relic containing fragments of wood from the cross of Christ. It generally has a rectangular and flat rectangular cross or rectangular tee with cruciform recipe used to guard the relic. It was a gift from Emperor Frederick II to the Duomo upon consecration. The work was produced in workshops of the royal goldsmiths, better known as &quot;Tiraz&quot;, in a cultural environment blending Arabic, Byzantine, and Western cultural elements.

=== &quot;Monastero delle Vergini&quot; ===
The &quot;Convent of the Virgins&quot; stands in via Gaetano Argento. The external part of the main entrance is made of decorated tuff, while the internal part is carved of wood. The convent contains a sixteenth-century painting of the &quot;Annunciation&quot;. In front of it, is the thirteenth-century &quot;Madonna del Pilerio&quot; attributed to Giovanni da Taranto, while on the walls are four other anonymous sixteenth-century paintings: the &quot;Visitation&quot;, the &quot;Circumcision&quot;, the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, and the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;. In the apse is the altarpiece &quot;Transit of the Virgin&quot; (1570). The cymatium houses a painting portraying the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot;, while at the base of the two columns are paintings of two unidentified saints that are attributed to Michele Curia, the &quot;Master of Montecalvario&quot;. The wooden choir dates to the seventeenth century.

=== &quot;Giostra Vecchia&quot; ===
In the fifteenth century, at Palazzo Falvo the Renaissance was introduced at Cosenza, in the &quot;Giostra Vecchia&quot;. Here are located the church and monastery of Saint Francis of Assisi. The Latin cross plan has a nave and two aisles. In the nave stands the impressive high wooden altar built in 1700. Above it is a painting by Daniele Russo representing the &quot;Perdono d’Assisi &quot;(1618). The left aisle is home to a wooden seventeenth-century crucifix, the altar of the &quot;Madonna della Febbre&quot; and the statue of the &quot;Madonna with Child&quot;, in marble, dating to the sixteenth century. The sacristy has a painted wooden ceiling, a wooden &quot;armadio&quot; representing episodes from the Passion of Christ, and paintings of saints and Franciscan friars. The stone arch is characterized by the painting of St. Francis of Paola, while on the walls are some frescoes dating to the beginning of the fifteenth century.

=== Hohenstaufen Castle ===


The &quot;Castello Svevo&quot; (&quot;Swabian&quot; or Hohenstaufen Castle) was originally built by the Saracens on the ruins of the ancient Rocca Brutia, around the year 1000. The castle was restored by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, adding the octagonal tower to the original structure, in 1239. According to tradition, his son Henry lived in this castle, as a prisoner at his father&#x27;s command. Louis III of Naples and Margaret of Savoy married in the castle and they both settled there in 1432.

All signs of the ancient Saracen structure have now disappeared. In the internal cloister, the modifications made by the Bourbons in order to convert it into a prison can also be seen. The entrance-hall is covered by ogival arches with engraved brackets. A wide corridor is dominated by some fleur-de-lis from the House of Anjou coat of arms. They are engraved on the ribbed Hohenstaufen arches.

=== &quot;Spirito Santo&quot; ===
The church of &quot;Sant&#x27;Agostino&quot;, also known as the &quot;Spirito Santo&quot;, was built in 1507 by the Augustinians. The original portal has several inscriptions in Gothic characters. The interior has a series of paintings from the eighteenth century. Further on a narrow street leads to the so-called “Area of the Bandiera Brothers”, the &quot;Vallone di Rovito&quot;. Here, the insurrectionist patriots of 1844 were executed by a firing squad.

=== &quot;San Francesco di Paola&quot; ===
In the Arenella, are the church and monastery of Saint Francis of Paola (1510). The interior, with a single nave, houses the tomb of Ottavio Cesare Gaeta. On the right wall, are two eighteenth-century paintings: a &quot;Sacra Famiglia&quot; and &quot;Madonna con San Francesco e Sant’Agostino&quot;. On an altar is a wooden statue of Saint Francis of Paola; while on the left side of the nave, on another altar, is a wooden statue of San Michele Arcangelo. The &quot;Madonna with Child in Glory and Saints Paul and Luke&quot; (1551) was painted by Pietro Negroni. In the apse, a sixteenth-century triptych made by Cristoforo Faffeo represents the &quot;Madonna and Child in glory with saints Catherine and Sebastian&quot;. At the back of the altar is a wooden choir built in 1679 by M. Domenico Costanzo da Rogliano. On the wall of the sacristy are remains of frescoes dating back to 1550–1600. On the vault are some pastels representing scenes from the life of the Saint from Paola.

=== &quot;San Salvatore&quot; ===
The small church of San Salvatore serves the parish that professes the Byzantine-Albanian faith. Inside the nave are a wooden ceiling, some frescoes of the Apostoli, of the Salvatore, and of the Madonna, as well as a splendid iconostasis.

=== Open Air Museum ===
In the modern part of Cosenza, in an area stretching from the pedestrianized Corso Mazzini to Piazza Bilotti, lies the open-air &quot;Museo MAB&quot; (&quot;Museo all&#x27;aperto Bilotti&quot;). The museum hosts a wide range of modern art sculptures that stand in the street for residents and tourists. The sculptures were donated to the city by the Italian-American entrepreneur and art collector, Carlo Bilotti. They include &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot; by Salvador Dalí, &quot;Hector and Andromache&quot; by Giorgio de Chirico, &quot;the Bronzes&quot; by Sacha Sosno, &quot;The Bather&quot; by Emilio Greco, &quot;The Cardinal&quot; by Giacomo Manzù, and various marble sculptures by Pietro Consagra.

<text>Louis Brennan (28 January 1852 – 17 January 1932) was an Irish mechanical engineer and inventor. He is best known for inventing the Brennan Torpedo, one of the earliest wire-guided torpedoes, which was adopted by the British Army in the late 19th century.

==Biography==
Brennan was born in Castlebar, Ireland, and moved to Melbourne, Australia, in 1861 with his parents. He started his career as a watchmaker and a few years later was articled to Alexander Kennedy Smith, a renowned civil and mechanical engineer of the period.
He served as a sergeant in the Victorian Engineers under the command of Captain J. J. Clark.
Brennan invented the idea of a steerable torpedo in 1874, from observing that if a thread is pulled on a reel at an angle with suitable leverage, the reel will move away from the thread side. Brennan spent some years working out his invention, and received a grant of £700 from the Victorian government towards his expenses. He patented the Brennan Torpedo in 1877. The idea was trialled at Camden Fort near Crosshaven, Cork, Ireland.

Brennan went to England in 1880 and brought his invention before the War Office. Sir Andrew Clarke alerted the authorities to the possibilities of the torpedo if used in the defence of harbours and channels, and the patent was eventually bought for a sum believed to be more than £100,000 (£ in 2025). In 1887, Brennan was appointed superintendent of the Brennan torpedo factory, and was consulting engineer from 1896 to 1907.
Brennan also did much work on a monorail locomotive which was kept upright by a gyrostat. In 1903, he patented a gyroscopically-balanced monorail system that he designed for military use; he successfully demonstrated the full sized system on 10 November 1909, at Gillingham, England. At the Japan–British Exhibition of 1910 at White City, London, he built a mile long monorail track and gave rides for around 40 people at a time on his gyro stabilised 22-ton prototype. Winston Churchill (then Home Secretary) was one of the passengers and then drove the vehicle himself for one circuit. He was so impressed that he brought along the Prime Minister and other cabinet members and family to see it the following week. The exhibit was awarded the Grand Prize for the exhibition. Although the ability of the vehicle to balance itself on a single rail was amazing, especially when stationary, it was not to prove a commercial success, partly due to fears that the gyroscopes might fail, and partly because any wagons or coaches towed by the locomotive would also need powered gyroscopic stabilisation.

From 1916 to 1919 Brennan served in the munitions inventions department. In 1916 he submitted a patent application entitled &quot;Improvements Relating to Aerial Navigation&quot; in which he outlined designs for a helicopter, and in June 1916 he received support for his experimental helicopter project from the British Ministry of Munitions. From 1919 to 1926 he was engaged by the Air Ministry in aircraft research work at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, and gave much time to developing the Brennan Helicopter. The first tethered flights (inside a hangar) took place in December 1921, at which time the engine was up-rated from the Bentley BR1 to the Bentley BR2. Flight trials in the open started in May 1924, however in October 1925 a demonstration flight ended with one of the twin blade rotors touching the ground causing damage to several components. The government had spent a large sum of money on it, and the Air Ministry was still offering an award of £50,000 for the developments of a successful machine, but in 1926 the air ministry gave up funding the Brennan helicopter project, much to Brennan&#x27;s disappointment.

He married Anna Quinn (died 1931) on 10 September 1892. He was survived by a son and a daughter. Brennan was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1892, and was foundation member of the National Academy of Ireland in 1922. In January 1932 he was knocked down by a car at Montreux, Switzerland, and died on 17 January 1932. Brennan was buried at St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, London, in an unmarked plot numbered 2454 that is opposite the Chapel record office. On 11 March 2014, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny unveiled a new gravestone for Brennan at St. Mary&#x27;s in a ceremony honouring the inventor&#x27;s life and career.

Gillingham Library retains the archive of his papers.

<text>Ionela Târlea (during marriage &quot;Târlea-Manolache;&quot; born 9 February 1976) is a former track and field athlete, competing internationally for Romania. She won the silver medal in the 400 m hurdles at the 2004 Summer Olympics. At the same games in Athens, Greece, Târlea helped the Romanian national team to sixth place in the 4 × 400 m relay.

She gained recognition in top international competitions as early as 1996 at the Atlanta Olympics, when she came seventh in the 400 m hurdles event. In 1999 at the World Indoor Athletics Championships she won the gold medal in the 200 metres.

In 2000 in Sydney, Australia, Târlea earned her place again in the finals of the 400 m hurdles event, and came sixth. In 2002, she reaped gold at the European Championships held in Munich, also in the 400 m hurdles, her preferred event. A rather uneventful period followed for Târlea.:It was only in early 2008 that she secured her comeback among the world&#x27;s top athletes as she came third in the 400 m event held in Stuttgart&#x27;s Sparkassen Cup. She retired in April 2009, due to long-term injuries.

At club level Târlea competed for Dinamo Bucharest, Fenerbahçe Istanbul and Sporting Portugal athletics.

<doc id="1054508" wikidata="Q864060" url="?curid=1054508" title="M134 Minigun">
<text>The M134 Minigun is an American 7.62×51mm NATO six-barrel rotary machine gun with a high rate of fire (2,000 to 6,000 rounds per minute). It features a Gatling-style rotating barrel assembly with an external power source, normally an electric motor. The &quot;Mini&quot; in the name is in comparison to larger-caliber designs that use a rotary barrel design, such as General Electric&#x27;s earlier 20 mm M61 Vulcan, and &quot;gun&quot; for the use of rifle ammunition as opposed to autocannon shells.

&quot;Minigun&quot; refers to a specific model of weapon that General Electric originally produced, but the term &quot;minigun&quot; has popularly come to refer to any externally powered rotary gun of rifle caliber. The term is sometimes used loosely to refer to guns of similar rates of fire and configuration, regardless of power source and caliber.

The Minigun is used by several branches of the U.S. military. Versions are designated &quot;M134&quot; and &quot;XM196&quot; by the United States Army, and &quot;GAU-2/A&quot; and &quot;GAU-17/A&quot; by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy.

==History==
===Background: electrically driven Gatling gun===
The ancestor to the modern minigun was the hand cranked mechanical Gatling gun invented in the 1860s by Richard Jordan Gatling. He later replaced the hand-cranked mechanism with an electric motor, a relatively new invention at the time. Even after Gatling slowed the mechanism, the new electrically powered Gatling gun had a theoretical rate of fire of 3,000 rounds per minute, roughly three times the rate of a typical modern, single-barreled machine gun. Gatling&#x27;s design received U.S. Patent #502,185 on July 25, 1893. Despite his improvements, the Gatling gun fell into disuse after cheaper, lighter-weight, recoil and gas operated machine guns were invented; Gatling himself went bankrupt for a period.

During World War I, several German companies were working on externally powered guns for use in aircraft. One of these designs was the Fokker-Leimberger, an externally powered 12-barrel rotary gun using the 7.92×57mm Mauser round; it was claimed to be capable of firing over 7,000 rpm, but suffered from frequent cartridge-case ruptures due to its &quot;nutcracker&quot; rotary split-breech design, which is different from that of conventional rotary gun designs. None of these German guns went into production during the war, although a competing Siemens prototype (possibly using a different action), which was tried on the Western Front, scored a victory in aerial combat. The British also experimented with this type of split-breech during the 1950s, but they were also unsuccessful.

===Minigun: 1960s–Vietnam===
In the 1960s, the United States Armed Forces began exploring modern variants of the electrically powered, rotating barrel Gatling-style weapons for use in the Vietnam War. American forces in the Vietnam War, which used helicopters as one of the primary means of transporting soldiers and equipment through the dense jungle, found that their helicopters were vulnerable to small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attacks when they slowed to land. Although helicopters had mounted single-barrel machine guns, using them to repel attackers hidden in the dense jungle foliage often led to overheated barrels or cartridge jams.

To develop a more reliable weapon with a higher rate of fire, General Electric designers scaled down the rotary-barrel 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannon for 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition. The resulting weapon, designated M134 and known as the &quot;Minigun&quot;, could fire up to 6,000 rounds per minute without overheating. The gun has a variable (i.e. selectable) rate of fire, specified to fire at rates of up to 6,000 rpm with most applications set at rates between 3,000 and 4,000 rounds per minute.
The Minigun was mounted on Hughes OH-6 Cayuse and Bell OH-58 Kiowa side pods; in the turret and on pylon pods of Bell AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters; and on door, pylon and pod mounts on Bell UH-1 Iroquois transport helicopters. Several larger aircraft were outfitted with miniguns specifically for close air support: the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly with an internal gun and with pods on wing hardpoints; and the Douglas A-1 Skyraider, also with pods on wing hardpoints. Other famous gunship airplanes are the Douglas AC-47 Spooky, the Fairchild AC-119, and the Lockheed AC-130.

===Dillon Aero minigun===
The U.S. government had procured some 10,000 Miniguns during the Vietnam War. Around 1990, Dillon Aero acquired a large number of Miniguns and spares from &quot;a foreign user&quot;. The guns kept failing to shoot continuously, revealing that they were actually worn-out weapons. The company decided to fix the problems encountered, rather than simply putting the guns into storage. Fixing failure problems ended up improving the Minigun&#x27;s overall design. Word of Dillon&#x27;s efforts to improve the Minigun reached the 160th SOAR, and the company was invited to Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to demonstrate its products. A delinker, used to separate cartridges from ammunition belts and feed them into the gun housing, and other parts were tested on Campbell&#x27;s ranges. The 160th SOAR were impressed by the delinker&#x27;s performance and began ordering them by 1997. This prompted Dillon to improve other design aspects including the bolt, housing and barrel. Between 1997 and 2001, Dillon Aero was producing 25–30 products a year. In 2001, it was working on a new bolt design that increased performance and service life. By 2002, virtually every component of the minigun had been improved, so Dillon began producing complete weapons with improved components. The guns were purchased quickly by the 160th SOAR as its standardized weapon system. The gun then went through the Army&#x27;s formal procurement system approval process, and in 2003 the Dillon Aero minigun was certified and designated &quot;M134D&quot;. Once the Dillon Aero system was approved for general military service, Dillon Aero GAU-17s entered Marine Corps service and were well received in replacing the GE GAU-17s serving on Marine UH-1s.

The core of the M134D was a steel housing and rotor. To focus on weight reduction, a titanium housing and rotor were introduced, creating the &quot;M134D-T&quot; which had reduced weight from to . The gun housing had a 500,000-round lifespan before it wore out, which was far higher than a conventional machine gun&#x27;s 40,000-round lifespan but lower than that of other rotary guns. A hybrid of the two weapons resulted in the &quot;M134D-H&quot;, which had a steel housing and titanium rotor. It was cheaper with the steel component and only heavier than the M134D-T, and restored its lifespan to 1.5 million rounds. The M134D-H is currently in use on various 160th Regiment platforms.

Dillon also created specialized mounts and ammunition-handling systems. Initially, mounts were made only for aviation systems. Then from 2003 to 2005, the Navy began mounting Dillon miniguns on specialized small boats. In 2005, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division procured guns to mount on Humvees. In Iraq, US Army Special Forces units on the ground were frequently engaged by opposition forces, so they mounted M134D miniguns on their vehicles for additional firepower. After several engagements the attackers seemed to avoid vehicles with miniguns. Later, the Special Forces units began concealing their weapons so opposition troops would not know they were facing the weapon; the regular Army units did the opposite, creating minigun mock-ups out of painted PVC pipes tied together to resemble barrels to intimidate enemies.

===Garwood Industries minigun===
Garwood Industries created the M134G version with several modifications to the original GE system. The optimum rate of fire was determined by Garwood to be around 3,200 rounds per minute (rpm). The M134G is being produced with this firing rate as well as 4,000 rpm and the previous standard 3,000 rpm rate. Garwood Industries made several other modifications to the 1960s Minigun design in order to meet modern-day military and ISO standards. This includes modifications to the drive motor, feeder and barrel clutch assembly.

From 2015 to 2017 Garwood Industries CEO Tracy Garwood collaborated with firearms dealer Michael Fox and weapons smuggler Tyler Carlson to supply miniguns to Mexican drug cartels. Garwood submitted false paperwork to the ATF claiming that some M134G rotor housings had been destroyed when they were actually sold to the gun-running ring. In 2017 federal agents raided Fox&#x27;s home and recovered two of the rotor housings that Garwood had reported destroyed. A number of the rotor housings were shipped to Mexico and a completed M134G using a reportedly destroyed rotor housing was recovered from a cartel by Mexican law enforcement. Garwood claimed he did not know that the intended buyers were Mexican cartels although he was aware that they were to be used for illegal activity.

==Design and variants ==
The basic minigun is a six-barrel, air-cooled, and electrically driven rotary machine gun. The electric drive rotates the weapon within its housing, with a rotating firing pin assembly and rotary chamber. The minigun&#x27;s multi-barrel design helps prevent overheating, but also serves other functions. Multiple barrels allow for a greater capacity for a high firing rate, since the serial process of firing, extraction, and loading is taking place in all barrels simultaneously. Thus, as one barrel fires, two others are in different stages of shell extraction and another three are being loaded. The minigun is composed of multiple closed-bolt rifle barrels arranged in a circular housing. The barrels are rotated by an external power source, usually electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. Other rotating-barrel cannons are powered by the gas pressure or recoil energy of fired cartridges. A gas-operated variant, designated XM133, was also developed.

While the weapon can feed from linked ammunition, it requires a delinking feeder to strip the links as the rounds are fed into the chambers. The original feeder unit was designated MAU-56/A, but has since been replaced by an improved MAU-201/A unit.
The General Electric minigun is used in several branches of the U.S. military, under a number of designations. The basic fixed armament version was given the designation &quot;M134&quot; by the United States Army, while the same weapon was designated &quot;GAU-2/A&quot; (on a fixed mount) and &quot;GAU-17/A&quot; (flexible mount) by the United States Air Force (USAF) and United States Navy (USN). The USAF minigun variant has three versions, while the US Army weapon appears to have incorporated several improvements without a change in designation. The M134D is an improved version of the M134 designed and manufactured by Dillon Aero, while Garwood Industries manufactures the M134G variant. Available sources show a relation between both M134 and GAU-2/A and M134 and GAU-2B/A. A separate variant, designated &quot;XM196&quot;, with an added ejection sprocket was developed specifically for the XM53 Armament Subsystem on the Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne helicopter.

Another variant was developed by the USAF specifically for flexible installations, beginning primarily with the Bell UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter, as the GAU-17/A. Produced by General Dynamics, this version has a slotted flash hider. The primary end users of the GAU-17/A have been the USN and the United States Marine Corps (USMC), which mount the gun as defensive armament on a number of helicopters and surface ships. GAU-17/As from helicopters were rushed into service for ships on pintle mountings taken from Mk16 20 mm guns for anti-swarm protection in the Gulf ahead of the 2003 Iraq War - 59 systems were installed in 30 days. The GAU-17/A is designated Mk 44 in the machine gun series and is generally known as the Mk 44 when installed on British warships.

The weapon is part of both the A/A49E-11 armament system on the UH-1N; and of the A/A49E-13 armament subsystem on the USAF Sikorsky HH-60H Pave Hawk helicopter. The weapons on these systems feature a selectable fire rate of either 2,000 or 4,000 rpm. There is mention of a possible GAUSE-17 designation (GAU-Shipboard Equipment-17), in reference to the system when mounted on surface ships, though this would not follow the official ASETDS designation system&#x27;s format.

===Gun pods and other mounting systems===

One of the first applications of the weapon was in aircraft armament pods. These gun pods were used by a wide variety of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft mainly during the Vietnam War, remaining in inventory for a period afterward. The standard pod, designated &quot;SUU-11/A&quot; by the Air Force and &quot;M18&quot; by the U.S. Army, was a relatively simple unit, completely self-contained, with a 1,500-round magazine directly feeding delinked ammunition into the weapon. This means the Minigun fitted to the pod does not require the standard MAU-56/A delinking feeder unit. A number of variants of this pod exist.

Initially on fixed-wing gunships such as the Douglas AC-47 Spooky and Fairchild AC-119, the side-firing armament was fitted by combining SUU-11/A aircraft pods, often with their aerodynamic front fairings removed, with a locally fabricated mount. These pods were essentially unmodified, required no external power, and were linked to the aircraft&#x27;s fire controls. The need for those pods for other missions led to the development and fielding of a purpose-built &quot;Minigun module&quot; for gunship use, designated the &quot;MXU-470/A&quot;. These units first arrived in January 1967 with features such as an improved 2,000-round drum and electric feeder allowing simplified reloading in flight. The initial units were unreliable and were withdrawn almost immediately. By the end of the year, the difficulties had been worked out and the units were again being fitted to AC-47s, AC-119s, and AC-130s, with a specific ammunition load that replaced every fifth &#x27;ball&#x27; round with a tracer round to enable better accuracy by the gunners, and also earning these airborne gunships the nickname &#x27;Puff the Magic Dragon&#x27; by the Viet Cong due to their apparent ability of spitting fire and making everything they hit disappear or die. The AC-47 had three side mounted MXU-470/As (four were mounted on its replacement, the AC-119) and when all firing at once created a devastating image in the eyes of the enemy. The first AC-130A Gunship IIs did away with the MXU-470/A mounts and instead used GAU-2/As, and not only had four 7.62mm GAU-2/A minigun mounts, but added four 20mm M61 Vulcan 6-barrel rotary cannons; this configuration was upgraded two years later in 1969 by removing two each of the GAU-2/As and M61s and adding two 40mm (1.58 in) L/60 Bofors cannons in the aptly named AC-130A &#x27;Surprise Package&#x27;. This configuration lasted two more years until, in late 1971, the AC-130E Pave Aegis arrived, which did away with the miniguns altogether and one of the 40mm Bofors and instead went to the configuration of two 20mm M61 Vulcan, one 40mm L/60 Bofors and one 105 mm (4.13 in) M102 howitzer, a configuration that lasted until the early 2000s when the AC-130Hs (the AC-130Es had had an avionics upgrade and redesignated to H models) underwent a refit and the two M61 Vulcans were removed and replaced with one General Dynamics 25 mm (0.984 in) GAU-12/U Equalizer 5-barrel rotary cannon (while still retaining the H suffix).

The improved MXU-470/As were even being proposed for lighter aircraft such as the Cessna O-2 Skymaster used by Forward Air Controllers but proved too heavy and cumbersome. A fit of two MXU-470/As was also tested on the Fairchild AU-23A Peacemaker, though the Royal Thai Air Force later elected to use another configuration with the M197 20 mm cannon.

In September 2013, Dillon Aero released the DGP2300 gun pod for the M134D-H. It contains 3,000 rounds, enough ammunition to fire the minigun for a full minute. The system is entirely self-contained, so it can be mounted on any aircraft that can handle the weight, rotational torque, and recoil force () of the gun. The pod has its own battery which can be wired into the aircraft&#x27;s electrical system to maintain a charge.

Various iterations of the minigun have also been used in a number of armament subsystems for helicopters, with most of these subsystems being created by the United States. The first systems utilized the weapon in a forward firing role for a variety of helicopters, some of the most prominent examples being the M21 armament subsystem for the UH-1 and the M27 for the OH-6. It also formed the primary turret-mounted armament for a number of members of the Bell AH-1 Cobra family. The weapon was also used as a pintle-mounted door gun on a wide variety of transport helicopters, a role it continues to fulfill today.

<text>Hatzalah, also spelled Haztolah, (; ) is the title used by many Jewish volunteer emergency medical service (EMS) organizations serving mostly areas with Jewish communities around the world, giving medical service to patients regardless of their religion. Most local branches operate independently of each other, but use the common name. The Hebrew spelling of the name is always the same, but there are many variations in transliteration, such as Hatzolah, Hatzoloh, and Hatzola. It is also often called Chevra Hatzalah, which loosely translates as &quot;Company of Rescuers&quot;, &quot;Group of Rescuers&quot;, or &quot;Rescue Squad&quot;. It is the largest volunteer medical group in the United States.

== History ==
The original Hatzalah emergency medical services (EMS) was founded in Williamsburg, a neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York, by Hershel Weber in the late 1960s. His aim was to improve rapid emergency medical response in the community, and to mitigate cultural concerns of a Yiddish-speaking, Hasidic community. The idea spread to other Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods in the New York City area, and eventually to other regions, countries, and continents. Hatzalah is believed to be the largest volunteer ambulance service in the world. Chevra Hatzalah in New York has more than a thousand volunteer emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics who answer more than 70,000 calls each year with private vehicles and a fleet of more than 90 ambulances.

Hatzalah organizations now function in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Mexico, Panama, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ukraine, and in 10 U.S. states: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Hatzalah branches are currently being organized in other states as well.

In Israel, there are two Hatzalah organizations operating on the national level: United Hatzalah (), and Tzevet Hatzalah (). While United Hatzalah is inarguably the larger of the two organizations, in the past their volunteers were limited to direct response on-scene care, versus Tzevet Hatzalah volunteers, which are additionally licensed and authorized to provide emergency transport utilizing Magen David Adom ambulances. Currently United Hatzalah has a wide deployment of active ambulances and several Mobiles Intensive Care Units (always staffed by a specialist doctor and a paramedic) distributed in the greatest cities of Israel, which allows them to transport sick and injured to the nearest suitable medical center, for free.

== Operations ==

Hatzalah uses a fly-car system, where members are assigned ad-hoc to respond to the emergency. The dispatcher requests any units for a particular emergency location. Members who think they will have best response times respond via handheld radios, and the dispatcher confirms the appropriate members. Two members will typically respond directly to the call in their private vehicles. A third member retrieves an ambulance from a base location.

Each directly dispatched Hatzolah volunteer has a full medical technician &quot;jump kit&quot; in their car, with oxygen, trauma, and appropriate pharmaceutical supplies. Paramedic (EMT-P) members carry more extensive equipment and supplies, including EKG, IV, injection, intubation, and other pharmaceuticals. Each volunteer is called a &quot;unit&quot; (as in, a crew of one) and is assigned a unit number that starts with a neighborhood code, followed by a serial number for that neighborhood (e.g., &quot;Q-120&quot; means &quot;Queens unit number 120&quot;). Ambulances used to have unit numbers in the same format, with the first few numbers for each neighborhood reserved for the ambulance numbers. By now all neighborhoods have begun to assign 3-digit unit numbers to their ambulances, using numbers out of the range assigned to human member units (e.g., 900-numbers). The new system is prone to confusion since every neighborhood has a 901, 902 etc. Often times dispatch and units on calls may get confused which bus is being called, i.e, B901 (the Boro Park bus) or F901 (the Flatbush bus) especially when Flatbush busses passing through Boro Park to and from Maimonidies Medical Center can, and often do, respond to Boro Park calls. 

In some areas there may be periods where coverage is not strong enough, for example on a summer weekend. When this happens, coordinators may assign an on-call rotation. The rotation may still respond from their houses, or they may stay at the garage through their shift. In such periods, Hatzalah functions closer to a typical EMS crew setup, though the dispatchers may still seek non-on-call members to respond, and there will still often be a non-ambulance responder as first dispatched, even if that responder starts from the base.

In Israel, United Hatzalah relies upon mobile phone technologies which include an SOS app and a special emergency phone number, 1221, with messages to news organizations distributed by WhatsApp.

=== Response times ===
Hatzalah&#x27;s model provides for rapid first responder response times. Each Hatzalah neighborhood&#x27;s response time varies. For example, in Borough Park, Brooklyn, daytime response in life-threatening emergency are between 1–2 minutes, and nighttime response times are 5–6 minutes. However, in the last few years with the implementation of Truck-1 (night on-call crews) the nighttime response in Boro Park has been shortened significantly. In the Beverly-La Brea neighborhood of Los Angeles, response times average at 60–90 seconds.
In Israel, the response time is under 3 minutes.

=== Organization ===
Hatzalah is not a single organization. Each chapter operates autonomously, or, in some cases, with varying levels of affiliation with neighboring Hatzalah chapters and under a central association.

In New York City&#x27;s Hatzalah, there is a very simple operational hierarchy. Usually, there are two or three members who are &quot;coordinators&quot;, managing all operational aspects of the chapter.

As Orthodox Jews, many volunteers see each other daily during prayers, and especially on Shabbat. This allows them to remain organized, despite the lack of an extensive formal hierarchy.

The coordinators are responsible for recruitment, interaction with municipal agency operations (police, fire, and EMS), first-line discipline, and day-to-day operations. The coordinators often are responsible, directly or via delegation, for arranging maintenance crews, who are often called service members or service units, and for purchasing supplies, ambulances, and other equipment. There is also an administrative function, often separate from the coordinator function. The chief administrator is often called a director or executive director, and this is sometimes a paid position. All other positions in Hatzalah, including coordinators, are held by unpaid volunteers.

Most of the New York State branches have some centralized administration and dispatch functions, known as &quot;Central Hatzalah&quot;, or, simply, &quot;Central&quot;. The neighborhood organizations under Central are nevertheless independent. Most Hatzalah organizations pattern themselves after the Williamsburg and Central models (see operational descriptions below).

Formally, the New York City-area &quot;Central Hatzalah&quot; is called Chevra Hatzalah of New York. It combines dispatch and some other functions for over a dozen neighborhood organizations, including Williamsburg, Flatbush, Borough Park, Canarsie, Crown Heights, Lower East Side, Upper West Side, Midtown, Washington Heights, Queens, Rockaways &amp; Nassau County, Seagate, Catskills, Staten Island, Riverdale, and others. As each of these areas is otherwise independent, each has its own fund-raising, management, garages, ambulances, and assigned members. Rockland County, New York, and Kiryas Joel (Town of Palm Tree) branches have a centralized dispatch system as well, but their central organization is separate from the other New York State centralized functions, and they have a looser relationship with their New York State brethren, though there is a great deal of co-operation among them. Together, the combined New York State branches have grown to become the largest all-volunteer ambulance system in the United States.

Outside of New York and Israel, there are many smaller Hatzalah organizations. Each of these operates as a self-contained unit as members of a single association, but with no centralized coordination. However, where there are other Hatzalahs nearby, there is often a great deal of co-operation.

In Baltimore, Hatzalah&#x27;s response area straddles two jurisdictions; Baltimore City Fire Department and Baltimore County Fire Department. Members in Baltimore often work side by side with crews from both services.

== Legal status ==
In the United Kingdom, Hatzalah cannot use blue lights and sirens on their private vehicles. though they are allowed to do so with ambulances.

In England, all Hatzalah chapters are CQC-registered, and they have a memorandum of understanding with local police forces with regards to use of blue lights and sirens, if certain criteria are met. Like any other emergency service, this does not mitigate if a collision occurs, and the service and its members can be prosecuted if deemed to be in the public interest.

In New York, Hatzalah usually use red and blue lights and sirens, like normal unmarked emergency vehicles. In New Jersey, Hatzalah usually use blue lights. Since 2021, Florida law has permitted faith-based volunteer ambulance services to operate, allowing Hatzalah response vehicles to use emergency lights and sirens. 

In Toronto, Hatzalah use green lights, having the same legal status as volunteer firefighters who also use green lights in their vehicles.

In Australia, Hatzalah are trained as Community First Responders. They are tasked by the professional services to respond to emergencies, but they cannot use flashing lights or sirens, and they must obey all traffic rules.

== Community involvement ==
Hatzalah organizations are often involved in other community activities, on top of their primary mission of emergency medical work. Many neighborhood chapters sponsor and participate in community events, both within the local Jewish community and in the broader community.

Many Hatzalahs worldwide run public relations campaigns related to safe drinking on Purim, fire safety on Chanukah, and during Passover preparations. Chevra Hatzolah in New York works closely with the New York City Fire Department on this matter.

== Specialization of Hatzalah ==
A number of items that are either unique to Hatzalah, or that are relatively unusual for an EMS, include:

=== Direct response ===

Most EMS rely on crews with scheduled shifts operating from a known location. Due to its members and the communities they serve usually living in proximity, Hatzolah relies little on scheduled crews and stations, and, rather, has all service members on call 24/7 and members responding from wherever they are.

=== Cultural sensitivities ===
Language, religion, and culture barriers create challenges for an emergency medical service. Hatzalah was predicated on the consideration of these challenges, especially with regard to halakha (Jewish law) and communities that only speak Yiddish or Hebrew.

A Jew reluctant to violate Shabbat rules when receiving medical attention may be more at ease and easily convinced of the medical urgency when the EMT or paramedic is a fellow Orthodox Jew. A woman or girl worried about physical modesty and contact may be helped by knowing that a Jewish provider will be aware of the details of her concerns, and will act to reduce the problem as much as possible.

=== Mental health ===

Many Hatzalah response crews will include at least one mental health professional (either a psychologist or psychiatrist), even if the emergency is not psychological in nature. The mental health professional functions to deal with potential psychological elements of the medical emergency including: calming the patient before and during transport to hospital, calming surrounding individuals on the scene, and dealing with actual psychological/psychiatric emergencies. Some Hatzalah chapters globally have their own mobile crisis units.

=== Cost ===
In areas where the EMS charges a fee, lower income clientele lacking health insurance may have a reluctance to call for an ambulance, unless the evidence of urgency is overwhelming. A volunteer service, with less overhead costs, tends to reduce that reluctance. Hatzolah will often handle &quot;check-out&quot; cases without charge. In this way, the true emergencies among those check-outs may be recognized and treated quickly, where the caller might have otherwise not sought treatment.

=== Patient advocacy ===

In contrast with most other EMS agencies, many Hatzalah volunteers will remain at the hospital with the patient long after bringing them to the emergency department. This is especially true during serious cases, where volunteers will remain in order to help the patient and/or their families navigate the sometimes confusing series of events that occur during an emergency. Members will stay to explain, advocate, and sometimes help make arrangements to bring in other specialists or arrange transfer to higher care facilities.

== Funding ==

Across the world, Hatzalah organisations make money by fundraising, either by fundraising dinners, or via public matching funds.

== Interaction with other agencies ==
At times, there have been difficulties in dealing with outside organizations, including other first-responders.

On February 20, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission granted Chevrah Hatzalah&#x27;s request for a waiver to obtain calling party numbers (CPN), even when callers have caller ID blocking. Calls to 911 are exempt from CPN blocking, but calls to Chevrah Hatzalah do not go through 911. Other Hatzalah dispatch numbers, including other New York State Hatzalah groups, do not have this waiver, but some are working on it.

In general, branches have excellent relations with state and local police and EMS.

An example of those operating in uneven, or otherwise especially challenging situations is Catskills Hatzolah, handling the swelling summer crowd.

Israel&#x27;s United Hatzalah has shared its expertise with a group of Palestinian volunteers from East Jerusalem, to form an emergency first response unit called Nuran. The group has since been dismantled, and the volunteers were incorporated into United Hatzalah.

=== Magen David Adom ===
United Hatzalah&#x27;s relationship with Magen David Adom, however, is strained, and MDA has banned its members and volunteers from also volunteering in other rescue organizations, including Hatzalah.

The Chevra NYC Central affiliates boast an excellent relationship with New York City and New York State agencies.

=== Ezras Nashim === 
Hatzalah was the subject of controversy as articles in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and &quot;JEMS Magazine&quot; criticize the organization for its practice of not allowing women to join. A group of Orthodox women founded an organization called Ezras Nashim, an all-female Orthodox Jewish volunteer EMT ambulance service. They cited the need for modesty and sensitivity to the needs of fellow Orthodox women, with the goal of preserving women&#x27;s modesty in emergency medical situations, especially childbirth: &quot;This is a woman&#x27;s job. Historically, women have always delivered babies in traditional Jewish values, pointing to the Hebrew Bible Book of Exodus, where the first midwives were women, Shiphrah and Puah.&quot; &quot;In our community, women also have a very strong motivation to seek female doctors&quot;, said their lawyer, Rachel Freier, a Brooklyn Civil Court Judge and Haredi Orthodox Jewish mother of six.

== Notable field operations ==
=== Crown Heights riot ===
Lack of public understanding of Hatzalah operations played a key role in the 1991 Crown Heights riot in Brooklyn. To the general public observing a car crash, it appeared that Hatzalah was there to help the Jewish operator of the car and not the two small children who were severely injured by the car.

=== September 11 attacks ===
Hatzalah members were among the first responders at the World Trade Center following the September 11 attacks on September 11, 2001. Alongside other rescue workers, Hatzalah volunteers rescued, treated, and transported victims.

Hatzalah was not dispatched by the city&#x27;s 911 system, and a print-out of the 911 job from FDNY EMS does not list them as responding units. However, audio recordings exist of Hatzalah&#x27;s own dispatch, including members calling for help during the collapse of the first tower. There are also well-known photos of destroyed Hatzalah ambulances and the destroyed cars of Hatzalah members, in the aftermath of the attack.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Hatzalah chapters across the United States continued to service Jewish communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The organization saw a 250% increase in emergency calls during the pandemic. In addition to medical response, Hatzalah worked with rabbis and community leaders to communicate to Jewish communities the need for self-isolation and the implementation of safety precautions. Multiple Hatzalah chapters donated ventilators and masks, as well as other vital personal protective equipment, to local hospitals in need of the equipment.

=== Surfside building collapse ===
On 24 June 2021—ten days after Governor Ron DeSantis signed the law that would allow Hatzalah in Florida to operate—Hatzalah of South Florida&#x27;s (HSF) Baruch Sandhaus was one of the first paramedics on the scene of the Surfside condominium collapse, providing triage care to survivors and families. HSF, which was on-site for the duration of the rescue and recovery operation, initiated calls to Magen David Adom and the Israel Defense Forces search and rescue team (part of the Home Front Command), later providing medical and rehab support to them as well as the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department and United Hatzalah. HSF treated sixty patients on-site.

== Chapters ==
Chapters of the organization exist in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Panama,England, Israel, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, Switzerland, and in the United States. The chapters in each neighborhood or city operate independently, though in many cases, affiliations and levels of co-operation do exist between neighboring chapters.

<text>The 2004 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Formula 1 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 October 2004 at the Suzuka Circuit. It was Race 17 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.

==Friday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

Wirdheim and Briscoe could not got to drive any single lap Friday training sessions. Teams confirmed it as a reason for not driving the drivers that they had a limited number of tyres for very wet weather, and were therefore not sufficient for the cars of the third drivers.

== Report ==
=== Background ===
This was Jarno Trulli&#x27;s first race with the Toyota team after missing the previous race. This was Olivier Panis&#x27;s last race as he decided to retire from the race seat. But he stayed with the Toyota team, as the test driver.

=== Qualifying ===
All the running on Saturday was cancelled due to Typhoon Ma-on, meaning that both the qualifying sessions were run on Sunday morning. Qualifying took place on a track that was still damp but is drying out; Michael Schumacher took advantage of this and, taking to the track among the last thanks to an excellent performance in the first session, won pole position, with a large advantage over his rivals. Second was Ralf Schumacher, while Webber surprisingly took third place, still a full second behind the pole position time. The two BARs of Sato and Button followed, preceding Trulli, Fisichella, Coulthard and Villeneuve. The difficult conditions of the track put several drivers in difficulty: Alonso, Räikkönen, Montoya and Barrichello made mistakes, relegated to the second half of the grid.

=== Race ===
After some testing plagued by bad weather, the race started in dry conditions and sunshine. At the start, Michael and Ralf Schumacher had no difficulty maintaining the lead. Webber on the other hand, started poorly and was overtaken by Button, Sato and Trulli. Michael Schumacher immediately gained a clear advantage over his opponents. The only one who drove a similar pace was his brother Ralf, who also went into the pits first on the 9th lap. When Michael Schumacher refueled four laps later, he rejoined the track as the leader, ahead of Button (who started with a two-stop strategy and therefore had not yet pitted). The race for first place was practically over. While the BAR duo fought for third place (Sato with a three-stop strategy against Button&#x27;s), the race is livened up by the comeback of Barrichello, Montoya, Räikkönen and Alonso; Trulli, however, is relegated and, having started with little petrol on board, has to deal with a Toyota that is very difficult to manage with a full tank of fuel.

On lap 20, Webber retired for a rather unusual reason: the cockpit of his Jaguar inexplicably overheated to such an extent that the Australian driver suffered minor burns on his thigh. After the first series of stops, Trulli, Montoya, Barrichello and Fisichella gave rise to an intense duel, with the Sauber driver having difficulty with the tyres, having to give way to the Brazilian from Ferrari, but managing to defend himself from the other two until his second refueling, on the 24th lap. Michael Schumacher continued to lead undisturbed and didn&#x27;t relinquish the lead for one lap. His brother Ralf also had no particular difficulties defending his second place from the two BAR drivers. Coulthard climbs sharply up the overall standings and initially only makes two stops. With around twenty laps to go, the Scot was in fifth place, having refueled for the second time.

Behind him, however, Barrichello quickly recovered. On lap 38, the Brazilian attempted an attack, but the McLaren driver came out of the corner and the two subsequently touched each other. The two cars were damaged beyond repair and both had to give up. Alonso moved up to fifth place. Meanwhile, Button prevailed against his teammate in the duel for the podium. Sato got off to a slow start and pain from an old shoulder injury returned during the race and had to go without liquid for much of the race when a water bottle stopped working. BAR virtually secured second place in the Constructors&#x27; Championship. The team increased its advantage over Renault to 16 points with one race remaining.

There were no more surprises in the final laps and Michael Schumacher won ahead of Ralf Schumacher, Button, Sato, Alonso, Räikkönen, Montoya and Fisichella. It was Ferrari&#x27;s fifteenth victory of the season. In doing so, they equaled the previous record of the McLaren, which won fifteen out of sixteen Grands Prix victories in , and the Ferrari, which won fifteen out of seventeen in .

It was the last time the Schumacher brothers finished in 1–2 formation (having done so on four other occasions: 2001 Canadian Grand Prix, 2001 French Grand Prix, 2002 Brazilian Grand Prix, 2003 Canadian Grand Prix). It was also the last 1-2 finish between German drivers until the 2013 Indian Grand Prix.

<doc id="1054527" wikidata="Q2609670" url="?curid=1054527" title="Corporate law">
<text>Corporate law (also known as company law or enterprise law) is the body of law governing the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations and businesses. The term refers to the legal practice of law relating to corporations, or to the theory of corporations. Corporate law often describes the law relating to matters which derive directly from the life-cycle of a corporation. It thus encompasses the formation, funding, governance, and death of a corporation.

While the minute nature of corporate governance as personified by share ownership, capital market, and business culture rules differ, similar legal characteristics and legal problems exist across many jurisdictions. Corporate law regulates how corporations, investors, shareholders, directors, employees, creditors, and other stakeholders such as consumers, the community, and the environment interact with one another. Whilst the term company or business law is colloquially used interchangeably with corporate law, the term business law mostly refers to wider concepts of &quot;commercial law,&quot; that is the law relating to commercial and business related purposes and activities. In some cases, this may include matters relating to corporate governance or financial law. When used as a substitute for corporate law, business law means the law relating to the &quot;business corporation&quot; (or business enterprises), including such activity as raising capital, company formation, and registration with the government.

== Overview ==
Academics identify four legal characteristics universal to business enterprises. These are: 
*Separate legal personality of the corporation (access to tort and contract law in a manner similar to a person)
*Limited liability of the shareholders (a shareholder&#x27;s personal liability is limited to the value of their shares in the corporation)
*Transferable shares (if the corporation is a &quot;public company&quot;, the shares are publicly listed and traded)
*Delegated management under a board structure; the board of directors delegates day-to-day management of the company to executives.
Widely available and user-friendly corporate law enables business participants to possess these four legal characteristics and thus transact as businesses. Thus, corporate law is a response to three endemic opportunism: conflicts between managers and shareholders, between controlling and non-controlling shareholders; and between shareholders and other contractual counterparts (including creditors and employees).

A corporation may accurately be called a company; however, a company should not necessarily be called a corporation, which has distinct characteristics. In the United States, a company may or may not be a separate legal entity, and is often used synonymous with &quot;firm&quot; or &quot;business.&quot; According to Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary, in America a company means &quot;a corporation — or, less commonly, an association, partnership or union — that carries on industrial enterprise.&quot; Other types of business associations can include partnerships (in the UK governed by the Partnership Act 1890), or trusts (such as a pension fund), or companies limited by guarantee (like some community organizations or charities). Corporate law deals with companies that are incorporated or registered under the corporate or company law of a sovereign state or their sub-national states.

The defining feature of a corporation is its legal independence from the shareholders that own it. Under corporate law, corporations of all sizes have separate legal personality, with limited or unlimited liability for its shareholders. Shareholders control the company through a board of directors which, in turn, typically delegates control of the corporation&#x27;s day-to-day operations to a full-time executive. Shareholders&#x27; losses, in the event of liquidation, are limited to their stake in the corporation, and they are not liable for any remaining debts owed to the corporation&#x27;s creditors. This rule is called limited liability, and it is why the names of corporations end with &quot;Ltd.&quot; or some variant such as &quot;Inc.&quot; or &quot;plc.&quot;

Under almost all legal systems corporations have much the same legal rights and obligations as individuals. In some jurisdictions, this extends to allow corporations to exercise human rights against real individuals and the state, and they may be responsible for human rights violations. Just as they are &quot;born&quot; into existence through its members obtaining a certificate of incorporation, they can &quot;die&quot; when they lose money into insolvency. Corporations can even be convicted of criminal offences, such as corporate fraud and corporate manslaughter.

===History===
Although some forms of companies are thought to have existed during Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece, the closest recognizable ancestors of the modern company did not appear until the 16th century. With increasing international trade, Royal charters were granted in Europe (notably in England and Holland) to merchant adventurers. The Royal charters usually conferred special privileges on the trading company (including, usually, some form of monopoly). Originally, traders in these entities traded stock on their own account, but later the members came to operate on joint account and with joint stock, and the new Joint stock company was born.

Early companies were purely economic ventures; it was only a belatedly established benefit of holding joint stock that the company&#x27;s stock could not be seized for the debts of any individual member. The development of company law in Europe was hampered by two notorious &quot;bubbles&quot; (the South Sea Bubble in England and the Tulip Bulb Bubble in the Dutch Republic) in the 17th century, which set the development of companies in the two leading jurisdictions back by over a century in popular estimation.
Companies returned to the forefront of commerce, although in England to circumvent the Bubble Act 1720 investors had reverted to trading the stock of unincorporated associations, until it was repealed in 1825. However, the process of obtaining Royal charters was insufficient to keep up with demand. In England there was a lively trade in the charters of defunct companies. It was not until the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 that the first equivalent of modern companies, formed by registration, appeared. Soon after came the Limited Liability Act 1855, which in the event of a company&#x27;s bankruptcy limited the liability of all shareholders to the amount of capital they had invested.

The beginning of modern company law came when the two pieces of legislation were codified under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 at the behest of the then Vice President of the Board of Trade, Mr Robert Lowe. That legislation shortly gave way to the railway boom, and from there the numbers of companies formed soared. In the later nineteenth century depression took hold, and just as company numbers had boomed, many began to implode and fall into insolvency. Much strong academic, legislative and judicial opinion was opposed to the notion that businessmen could escape accountability for their role in the failing businesses. The last significant development in the history of companies was the decision of the House of Lords in &quot;Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.&quot; where the House of Lords confirmed the separate legal personality of the company, and that the liabilities of the company were separate and distinct from those of its owners.

==Corporate structure==
The law of business organizations originally derived from the common law of England, and has evolved significantly in the 20th century. In common law countries today, the most commonly addressed forms are:
* Corporation
* Limited company
* Unlimited company
* Limited liability partnership
* Limited partnership
* Not-for-profit corporation
* Company limited by guarantee
* Partnership
* Sole proprietorship
* Privately held company
The proprietary limited company is a statutory business form in several countries, including Australia. Many countries have forms of business entity unique to that country, although there are equivalents elsewhere. Examples are the limited liability company (LLC) and the limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) in the United States. Other types of business organizations, such as cooperatives, credit unions and publicly owned enterprises, can be established with purposes that parallel, supersede, or even replace the profit maximization mandate of business corporations.

There are various types of company that can be formed in different jurisdictions, but the most common forms of company are:
* &quot;a company limited by guarantee&quot;. Commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise they have no economic rights in relation to the company .
* &quot;a company limited by guarantee with a share capital&quot;. A hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return.
* &quot;a company limited by shares&quot;. The most common form of company used for business ventures.
* &quot;an unlimited company&quot; either with or without a share capital. This is a hybrid company, a company similar to its limited company (Ltd.) counterpart but where the members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should the company ever go into formal liquidation.
There are, however, many specific categories of corporations and other business organizations which may be formed in various countries and jurisdictions throughout the world.

===Corporate legal personality===

One of the key legal features of corporations are their separate legal personality, also known as &quot;personhood&quot; or being &quot;artificial persons&quot;. However, the separate legal personality was not confirmed under English law until 1895 by the House of Lords in &quot;Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.&quot; Separate legal personality often has unintended consequences, particularly in relation to smaller, family companies. In &quot;B v. B&quot; [1978] Fam 181 it was held that a discovery order obtained by a wife against her husband was not effective against the husband&#x27;s company as it was not named in the order and was separate and distinct from him. And in &quot;Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co Ltd&quot; a claim under an insurance policy failed where the insured had transferred timber from his name into the name of a company wholly owned by him, and it was subsequently destroyed in a fire; as the property now belonged to the company and not to him, he no longer had an &quot;insurable interest&quot; in it and his claim failed.

Separate legal personality allows corporate groups flexibility in relation to tax planning, and management of overseas liability. For instance in &quot;Adams v. Cape Industries plc&quot; it was held that victims of asbestos poisoning at the hands of an American subsidiary could not sue the English parent in tort. Whilst academic discussion highlights certain specific situations where courts are generally prepared to &quot;pierce the corporate veil&quot;, to look directly at, and impose liability directly on the individuals behind the company; the actual practice of piercing the corporate veil is, at English law, non-existent. However, the court will look beyond the corporate form where the corporation is a sham or perpetuating a fraud. The most commonly cited examples are:
* where the company is a mere façade
* where the company is effectively just the agent of its members or controllers
* where a representative of the company has taken some personal responsibility for a statement or action
* where the company is engaged in fraud or other criminal wrongdoing
* where the natural interpretation of a contract or statute is as a reference to the corporate group and not the individual company
* where permitted by statute (for example, many jurisdictions provide for shareholder liability where a company breaches environmental protection laws)

====Capacity and powers====

Historically, because companies are artificial persons created by operation of law, the law prescribed what the company could and could not do. Usually this was an expression of the commercial purpose which the company was formed for, and came to be referred to as the company&#x27;s &quot;objects&quot;, and the extent of the objects are referred to as the company&#x27;s capacity. If an activity fell outside the company&#x27;s capacity it was said to be &quot;ultra vires&quot; and void.

By way of distinction, the organs of the company were expressed to have various &quot;corporate powers&quot;. If the objects were the things that the company was able to do, then the powers were the means by which it could do them. Usually expressions of powers were limited to methods of raising capital, although from earlier times distinctions between objects and powers have caused lawyers difficulty. Most jurisdictions have now modified the position by statute, and companies generally have capacity to do all the things that a natural person could do, and power to do it in any way that a natural person could do it.

However, references to corporate capacity and powers have not quite been consigned to the dustbin of legal history. In many jurisdictions, directors can still be liable to their shareholders if they cause the company to engage in businesses outside its objects, even if the transactions are still valid as between the company and the third party. And many jurisdictions also still permit transactions to be challenged for lack of &quot;corporate benefit&quot;, where the relevant transaction has no prospect of being for the commercial benefit of the company or its shareholders.

As artificial persons, companies can only act through human agents. The main agent who deals with the company&#x27;s management and business is the board of directors, but in many jurisdictions other officers can be appointed too. The board of directors is normally elected by the members, and the other officers are normally appointed by the board. These agents enter into contracts on behalf of the company with third parties.

Although the company&#x27;s agents owe duties to the company (and, indirectly, to the shareholders) to exercise those powers for a proper purpose, generally speaking third parties&#x27; rights are not impugned if it transpires that the officers were acting improperly. Third parties are entitled to rely on the ostensible authority of agents held out by the company to act on its behalf. A line of common law cases reaching back to &quot;Royal British Bank v Turquand&quot; established in common law that third parties were entitled to assume that the internal management of the company was being conducted properly, and the rule has now been codified into statute in most countries.

Accordingly, companies will normally be liable for all the act and omissions of their officers and agents. This will include almost all torts, but the law relating to crimes committed by companies is complex, and varies significantly between countries.

===Corporate governance===

Corporate governance is primarily the study of the power relations among a corporation&#x27;s senior executives, its board of directors and those who elect them (shareholders in the &quot;general meeting&quot; and employees), as well as other stakeholders, such as creditors, consumers, the environment and the community at large. One of the main differences between different countries in the internal form of companies is between a two-tier and a one tier board. The United Kingdom, the United States, and most Commonwealth countries have single unified boards of directors. In Germany, companies have two tiers, so that shareholders (and employees) elect a &quot;supervisory board&quot;, and then the supervisory board chooses the &quot;management board&quot;. There is the option to use two tiers in France, and in the new European Companies ().

Recent literature, especially from the United States, has begun to discuss corporate governance in the terms of management science. While post-war discourse centred on how to achieve effective &quot;corporate democracy&quot; for shareholders or other stakeholders, many scholars have shifted to discussing the law in terms of principal–agent problems. On this view, the basic issue of corporate law is that when a &quot;principal&quot; party delegates his property (usually the shareholder&#x27;s capital, but also the employee&#x27;s labour) into the control of an &quot;agent&quot; (i.e. the director of the company) there is the possibility that the agent will act in his own interests, be &quot;opportunistic&quot;, rather than fulfill the wishes of the principal. Reducing the risks of this opportunism, or the &quot;agency cost&quot;, is said to be central to the goal of corporate law.

====Constitution====
The rules for corporations derive from two sources. These are the country&#x27;s statutes: in the US, usually the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL); in the UK, the Companies Act 2006 (CA 2006); in Germany, the Aktiengesetz (AktG) and the Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH-Gesetz, GmbHG). The law will set out which rules are mandatory, and which rules can be derogated from. Examples of important rules which cannot be derogated from would usually include how to fire the board of directors, what duties directors owe to the company or when a company must be dissolved as it approaches bankruptcy. Examples of rules that members of a company would be allowed to change and choose could include, what kind of procedure general meetings should follow, when dividends get paid out, or how many members (beyond a minimum set out in the law) can amend the constitution. Usually, the statute will set out model articles, which the corporation&#x27;s constitution will be assumed to have if it is silent on a bit of particular procedure.

The United States, and a few other common law countries, split the corporate constitution into two separate documents (the UK got rid of this in 2006). The memorandum of association (or articles of incorporation) is the primary document, and will generally regulate the company&#x27;s activities with the outside world. It states which objects the company is meant to follow (e.g. &quot;this company makes automobiles&quot;) and specifies the authorised share capital of the company. The articles of association (or by-laws) is the secondary document, and will generally regulate the company&#x27;s internal affairs and management, such as procedures for board meetings, dividend entitlements etc. In the event of any inconsistency, the memorandum prevails and in the United States only the memorandum is publicised. In civil law jurisdictions, the company&#x27;s constitution is normally consolidated into a single document, often called the charter.

It is quite common for members of a company to supplement the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as &quot;shareholders&#x27; agreements&quot;, whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. Conceptually a shareholders&#x27; agreement fulfills many of the same functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to it somehow. One benefit of shareholders&#x27; agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders&#x27; agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of &quot;voting trusts&quot;, although these are relatively uncommon outside the United States and certain offshore jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions consider the company seal to be a part of the &quot;constitution&quot; (in the loose sense of the word) of the company, but the requirement for a seal has been abrogated by legislation in most countries.

====Balance of power====

The most important rules for corporate governance are those concerning the balance of power between the board of directors and the members of the company. Authority is given or &quot;delegated&quot; to the board to manage the company for the success of the investors. Certain specific decision rights are often reserved for shareholders, where their interests could be fundamentally affected. There are necessarily rules on when directors can be removed from office and replaced. To do that, meetings need to be called to vote on the issues. How easily the constitution can be amended and by whom necessarily affects the relations of power.

It is a principle of corporate law that the directors of a company have the right to manage. This is expressed in statute in the DGCL, where §141(a) states,

In Germany, §76 AktG says the same for the management board, while under §111 AktG the supervisory board&#x27;s role is stated to be to &quot;oversee&quot; (&quot;überwachen&quot;). In the United Kingdom, the right to manage is not laid down in law, but is found in Part.2 of the Model Articles. This means it is a default rule, which companies can opt out of (s.20 CA 2006) by reserving powers to members, although companies rarely do. UK law specifically reserves shareholders right and duty to approve &quot;substantial non cash asset transactions&quot; (s.190 CA 2006), which means those over 10% of company value, with a minimum of £5,000 and a maximum of £100,000. Similar rules, though much less stringent, exist in §271 DGCL and through case law in Germany under the so-called &quot;Holzmüller-Doktrin&quot;.

Probably the most fundamental guarantee that directors will act in the members&#x27; interests is that they can easily be sacked. During the Great Depression, two Harvard scholars, Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means wrote &quot;The Modern Corporation and Private Property&quot;, an attack on American law which failed to hold directors to account, and linked the growing power and autonomy of directors to the economic crisis. In the UK, the right of members to remove directors by a simple majority is assured under s.168 CA 2006 Moreover, Art.21 of the Model Articles requires a third of the board to put themselves up for re-election every year (in effect creating maximum three year terms). 10% of shareholders can demand a meeting any time, and 5% can if it has been a year since the last one (s.303 CA 2006). In Germany, where employee participation creates the need for greater boardroom stability, §84(3) AktG states that management board directors can only be removed by the supervisory board for an important reason (&quot;ein wichtiger Grund&quot;) though this can include a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders. Terms last for five years, unless 75% of shareholders vote otherwise. §122 AktG lets 10% of shareholders demand a meeting. In the US, Delaware lets directors enjoy considerable autonomy. §141(k) DGCL states that directors can be removed without any cause, unless the board is &quot;classified&quot;, meaning that directors only come up for re-appointment on different years. If the board is classified, then directors cannot be removed unless there is gross misconduct. Director&#x27;s autonomy from shareholders is seen further in §216 DGCL, which allows for plurality voting and §211(d) which states shareholder meetings can only be called if the constitution allows for it. The problem is that in America, directors usually choose where a company is incorporated and §242(b)(1) DGCL says any constitutional amendment requires a resolution by the directors. By contrast, constitutional amendments can be made at any time by 75% of shareholders in Germany (§179 AktG) and the UK (s.21 CA 2006).

Countries with co-determination employ the practice of workers of an enterprise having the right to vote for representatives on the board of directors in a company.

===Director duties===

In most jurisdictions, directors owe strict duties of good faith, as well as duties of care and skill, to safeguard the interests of the company and the members. In many developed countries outside the English speaking world, company boards are appointed as representatives of both shareholders and employees to &quot;codetermine&quot; company strategy. Corporate law is often divided into corporate governance (which concerns the various power relations within a corporation) and corporate finance (which concerns the rules on how capital is used).
Directors also owe strict duties not to permit any conflict of interest or conflict with their duty to act in the best interests of the company. This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the conflict of interest or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In &quot;Aberdeen Ry v. Blaikie&quot; (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 Lord Cranworth stated in his judgment that, However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle should be capable of being abrogated in the company&#x27;s constitution. 
The standard of skill and care that a director owes is usually described as acquiring and maintaining sufficient knowledge and understanding of the company&#x27;s business to enable him to properly discharge his duties. This duty enables the company to seek compensation from its director if it can be proved that a director has not shown reasonable skill or care which in turn has caused the company to incur a loss. In many jurisdictions, where a company continues to trade despite foreseeable bankruptcy, the directors can be forced to account for trading losses personally. Directors are also strictly charged to exercise their powers only for a proper purpose. For instance, were a director to issue a large number of new shares, not for the purposes of raising capital but in order to defeat a potential takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

==Company law theory==

Ronald Coase has pointed out, all business organizations represent an attempt to avoid certain costs associated with doing business. Each is meant to facilitate the contribution of specific resources - investment capital, knowledge, relationships, and so forth - towards a venture which will prove profitable to all contributors. Except for the partnership, all business forms are designed to provide limited liability to both members of the organization and external investors. Business organizations originated with agency law, which permits an agent to act on behalf of a principal, in exchange for the principal assuming equal liability for the wrongful acts committed by the agent. For this reason, all partners in a typical general partnership may be held liable for the wrongs committed by one partner. Those forms that provide limited liability are able to do so because the state provides a mechanism by which businesses that follow certain guidelines will be able to escape the full liability imposed under agency law. The state provides these forms because it has an interest in the strength of the companies that provide jobs and services therein, but also has an interest in monitoring and regulating their behaviour.

==Litigation==

Members of a company generally have rights against each other and against the company, as framed under the company&#x27;s constitution. However, members cannot generally claim against third parties who cause damage to the company which results in a diminution in the value of their shares or others membership interests because this is treated as &quot;reflective loss&quot; and the law normally regards the company as the proper claimant in such cases.

In relation to the exercise of their rights, minority shareholders usually have to accept that, because of the limits of their voting rights, they cannot direct the overall control of the company and must accept the will of the majority (often expressed as &quot;majority rule&quot;). However, majority rule can be iniquitous, particularly where there is one controlling shareholder. Accordingly, a number of exceptions have developed in law in relation to the general principle of majority rule.

* Where the majority shareholder(s) are exercising their votes to perpetrate a fraud on the minority, the courts may permit the minority to sue
* members always retain the right to sue if the majority acts to invade their personal rights, e.g. where the company&#x27;s affairs are not conducted in accordance with the company&#x27;s constitution (this position has been debated because the extent of a personal right is not set in law). &quot;Macdougall v Gardiner&quot; and &quot;Pender v Lushington&quot; present irreconcilable differences in this area.
* in many jurisdictions it is possible for minority shareholders to take a &quot;representative&quot; or &quot;derivative action&quot; in the name of the company, where the company is controlled by the alleged wrongdoers

==Corporate finance==
Through the operational life of the corporation, perhaps the most crucial aspect of corporate law relates to raising capital for the business to operate. The law, as it relates to corporate finance, not only provides the framework for which a business raises funds - but also provides a forum for principles and policies which drive the fundraising, to be taken seriously. Two primary methods of financing exists with regard to corporate financing, these are:
*Equity financing; and
*Debt financing 
Each has relative advantages and disadvantages, both at law and economically. Additional methods of raising capital necessary to finance its operations is that of retained profits Various combinations of financing structures have the capacity to produce fine-tuned transactions which, using the advantages of each form of financing, support the limitations of the corporate form, its industry, or economic sector. A mix of both debt and equity is crucial to the sustained health of the company, and its overall market value is independent of its capital structure. One notable difference is that interest payments to debt is tax deductible whilst payment of dividends are not, this will incentivise a company to issue debt financing rather than preferred stock in order to reduce their tax exposure.

===Shares and share capital===
A company limited by shares, whether public or private, must have at least one issued share; however, depending on the corporate structure, the formatting may differ. If a company wishes to raise capital through equity, it will usually be done by issuing shares (sometimes called &quot;stock&quot; (not to be confused with stock-in-trade)) or warrants. In the common law, whilst a shareholder is often colloquially referred to as the owner of the company - it is clear that the shareholder is not an owner of the company but makes the shareholder a member of the company and entitles them to enforce the provisions of the company&#x27;s constitution against the company and against other members. A share is an item of property, and can be sold or transferred. Shares also normally have a nominal or par value, which is the limit of the shareholder&#x27;s liability to contribute to the debts of the company on an insolvent liquidation. Shares usually confer a number of rights on the holder. These will normally include:
* voting rights
* rights to dividends (or payments made by companies to their shareholders) declared by the company
* rights to any return of capital either upon redemption of the share, or upon the liquidation of the company
* in some countries, shareholders have preemption rights, whereby they have a preferential right to participate in future share issues by the company
Companies may issue different types of shares, called &quot;classes&quot; of shares, offering different rights to the shareholders depending on the underlying regulatory rules pertaining to corporate structures, taxation, and capital market rules. A company might issue both ordinary shares and preference shares, with the two types having different voting and/or economic rights. It might provide that preference shareholders shall each receive a cumulative preferred dividend of a certain amount per annum, but the ordinary shareholders shall receive everything else. Corporations will structure capital raising in this way in order to appeal to different lenders in the market by providing different incentives for investment. The total value of issued shares in a company is said to represent its &quot;equity capital&quot;. Most jurisdictions regulate the minimum amount of capital which a company may have, although some jurisdictions prescribe minimum amounts of capital for companies engaging in certain types of business (e.g. banking, insurance etc.).
Similarly, most jurisdictions regulate the maintenance of equity capital, and prevent companies returning funds to shareholders by way of distribution when this might leave the company financially exposed. Often this extends to prohibiting a company from providing financial assistance for the purchase of its own shares.

==Dissolution==
Events such as mergers, acquisitions, insolvency, or the commission of a crime affect the corporate form. In addition to the creation of the corporation, and its financing, these events serve as a transition phase into either dissolution, or some other material shift.

===Mergers and acquisitions===

A merger or acquisition can often mean the altering or extinguishing of the corporation.

===Corporate insolvency===

If unable to discharge its debts in a timely manner, a corporation may end up on bankruptcy liquidation. Liquidation is the normal means by which a company&#x27;s existence is brought to an end. It is also referred to (either alternatively or concurrently) in some jurisdictions as &quot;winding up&quot; or &quot;dissolution&quot;. Liquidations generally come in two forms — either &quot;compulsory liquidations&quot; (sometimes called &quot;creditors&#x27; liquidations&quot;) and &quot;voluntary liquidations&quot; (sometimes called &quot;members&#x27; liquidations&quot;, although a voluntary liquidation where the company is insolvent will also be controlled by the creditors, and is properly referred to as a &quot;creditors&#x27; voluntary liquidation&quot;). Where a company goes into liquidation, normally a liquidator is appointed to gather in all the company&#x27;s assets and settle all claims against the company. If there is any surplus after paying off all the creditors of the company, this surplus is then distributed to the members.

As its names imply, applications for compulsory liquidation are normally made by creditors of the company when the company is unable to pay its debts. However, in some jurisdictions, regulators have the power to apply for the liquidation of the company on the grounds of public good, i.e., where the company is believed to have engaged in unlawful conduct, or conduct which is otherwise harmful to the public at large.

Voluntary liquidations occur when the company&#x27;s members decide voluntarily to wind up the affairs of the company. This may be because they believe that the company will soon become insolvent, or it may be on economic grounds if they believe that the purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.

Some jurisdictions also permit companies to be wound up on &quot;just and equitable&quot; grounds. Generally, applications for just and equitable winding-up are brought by a member of the company who alleges that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a prejudicial manner, and asking the court to bring an end to the company&#x27;s existence. For obvious reasons, in most countries, the courts have been reluctant to wind up a company solely on the basis of the disappointment of one member, regardless of how well-founded that member&#x27;s complaints are. Accordingly, most jurisdictions that permit just and equitable winding up also permit the court to impose other remedies, such as requiring the majority shareholder(s) to buy out the disappointed minority shareholder at a fair value.

===Insider dealing===

Insider trading is the trading of a corporation&#x27;s stock or other securities (e.g., bonds or stock options) by individuals with potential access to non-public information about the company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal if this trading is done in a way that does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider&#x27;s duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company. Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.

In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders (in the United States, defined as beneficial owners of ten percent or more of the firm&#x27;s equity securities) must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. Many investors follow the summaries of these insider trades in the hope that mimicking these trades will be profitable. While &quot;legal&quot; insider trading cannot be based on material non-public information, some investors believe corporate insiders nonetheless may have better insights into the health of a corporation (broadly speaking) and that their trades otherwise convey important information (e.g., about the pending retirement of an important officer selling shares, greater commitment to the corporation by officers purchasing shares, etc.)

==Trends and developments==
Most case law on the matter of corporate governance dates to the 1980s and primarily addresses hostile takeovers, however, current research considers the direction of legal reforms to address issues of shareholder activism, institutional investors and capital market intermediaries. Corporations and boards are challenged to respond to these developments. Shareholder demographics have been effected by trends in worker retirement, with more institutional intermediaries like mutual funds playing a role in employee retirement. These funds are more motivated to partner with employers to have their fund included in a company&#x27;s retirement plans than to vote their shares – corporate governance activities only increase costs for the fund, while the benefits would be shared equally with competitor funds.

Shareholder activism prioritizes wealth maximization and has been criticized as a poor basis for determining corporate governance rules. Shareholders do not decide corporate policy, that is done by the board of directors, but shareholders may vote to elect board directors and on mergers and other changes that have been approved by directors. They may also vote to amend corporate bylaws. Broadly speaking there have been three movements in 20th century American law that sought a federal corporate law: the Progressive Movement, some aspects of proposals made in the early stages of the New Deal and again in the 1970s during a debate about the effect of corporate decision making on states. However, these movements did not establish federal incorporation. Although there has been some federal involvement in corporate governance rules as a result, the relative rights of shareholders and corporate officers is still mostly regulated by state laws. There is no federal legislation like there is for corporate political contributions or regulation of monopolies and federal laws have developed along different lines than state laws.

==By region==

===Europe===

====Germany====
====United Kingdom====

=== United States ===

In the United States, most corporations are incorporated, or organized, under the laws of a particular state. The laws of the state of incorporation normally governs a corporation&#x27;s internal operations, even if the corporation&#x27;s operations take place outside that state. Corporate law differs from state to state. Because of these differences, some businesses will benefit from having a corporate lawyer determine the most appropriate or advantageous state in which to incorporate.

Business entities may also be regulated by federal laws and in some cases by local laws and ordinances.

====Delaware====

A majority of publicly traded companies in the U.S. are Delaware corporations. Some companies choose to incorporate in Delaware because the Delaware General Corporation Law offers lower corporate taxes than many other states. Many venture capitalists prefer to invest in Delaware corporations. Also, the Delaware Court of Chancery is widely recognized as a good venue for the litigation of business disputes.

<text>Stielers Handatlas (after Adolf Stieler, 1775–1836), formally titled Hand-Atlas über alle Theile der Erde und über das Weltgebäude (&quot;Handy atlas of all parts of the world and of the universe&quot;), was the leading German world atlas of the last three decades of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Published by Justus Perthes of Gotha (established 1785 and still existing there) it went through ten editions from 1816 to 1945. As with many 19th century publications, an edition was issued in parts; for example, the eighth edition was issued in 32 monthly parts.

== Editions ==
The earliest edition, by Stieler and Christian Gottlieb Reichard, was published as separate plates from 1817 to 1823. There were 47 maps, though the intention had been to publish 50. After Stieler&#x27;s death Friedrich von Stülpnagel (1786–1865) edited the first (1834-1845) edition, and the second (1845–47) with 107 maps. Petermann contributed to the third (1854–62) edition containing 83 maps, the fourth (1864–67) and the fifth (1868–74), each with 84 maps.

However, it was not until the sixth edition (1871–75, 90 maps), edited by August Petermann (1822–78), Hermann Berghaus (1828–1890) and Carl Vogel (1828–1897), that the work reached the high scientific level and the unsurpassed relief &quot;Stieler&#x27;s Atlas&quot; is famous for. A seventh edition was issued 1879-82; an eighth 1888-91 (both 95 maps) under the direction of Hermann Berghaus, Vogel and Hermann Habenicht (1844–1917). Although the printing industry had already changed to lithography for some time, some maps in &quot;Stieler&#x27;s Atlas&quot; were still reproduced by copper-plate printing on hand presses with hand colouring into the 1890s.

The ninth edition (1901–05), edited by Habenicht, with one hundred maps, over double the number of the initial edition, was the first one printed on cylinder machines by means of lithography, which halved the price and made the &quot;Stieler&quot; accessible to a broad public. 16 maps hereof were exclusively translated to English, transferred to Imperial units and became part the 11th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (1910–1911). Hermann Haack (1872–1966) edited the tenth (centenary) edition (1920–25, 108 maps), with an index to 320,000 entries being the most comprehensive world atlas of modern times.

English versions of the ninth and tenth editions appeared as &quot;Stieler&#x27;s Atlas of Modern Geography&quot;, and editions with similar titles were also issued in French, Italian and Spanish. An international edition (1934–1940) remained with 84 of the 114 maps planned incomplete due to wartime circumstances. The work was engraved on 432 copper plates which have been preserved.

<text>The Brennan torpedo was a torpedo patented by Irish-born Australian inventor Louis Brennan in 1877. It was propelled by two contra-rotating propellers that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside the torpedo. Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, up to away, at speeds of up to .

The Brennan torpedo is often claimed as the world&#x27;s first guided missile, but guided torpedoes invented by John Ericsson, John Louis Lay, and Victor von Scheliha all predate it; however, Brennan&#x27;s torpedo was much simpler in its concept and worked over an acceptable range at a satisfactory speed so it might be more accurate to call it the world&#x27;s first &quot;practical&quot; guided missile.

==Description==

The Brennan torpedo was similar in appearance to more modern ones, apart from having a flattened oval cross-section instead of a circular one. It was designed to run at a consistent depth of , and was fitted with an indicator mast that just broke the surface of the water; at night the mast had a small light fitted which was only visible from the rear.

Two steel drums were mounted one behind the other inside the torpedo, each carrying several thousands yards of high-tensile steel wire. The drums were connected via a differential gear to twin contra-rotating propellers. If one drum was rotated faster than the other, then the rudder was activated. The other ends of the wires were connected to steam-powered winding engines, which were arranged so that speeds could be varied within fine limits, giving sensitive steering control for the torpedo.

The torpedo attained a speed of using a wire in diameter but later this was changed to to increase the speed to . The torpedo was fitted with elevators controlled by a depth-keeping mechanism, and the fore and aft rudders operated by the differential between the drums.

In operation, the torpedo&#x27;s operator would be positioned on a high telescopic steel tower, which could be extended hydraulically. He was provided with a special pair of binoculars on which were mounted controls which could be used to electrically control the relative speeds of the twin winding engines. In this way he was able to follow the track of the torpedo and steer it with a great degree of accuracy. In tests carried out by the Admiralty the operator was able to hit a floating object at and was able to turn the torpedo through 180 degrees to hit a target from the off side.

==History==
Tomlinson states that in 1874 while watching a planing machine worked by a driving belt, Brennan stumbled on the paradox that it was possible to make a machine travel forward by pulling it backward.

Beanse expands Brennan’s observation of the driving belt powering the planing machine was taut and the non-driving side was slack. Brennan reasoned that if one dispensed with the non-driving side it would be possible to transfer energy to a vehicle and power it from a static power source. The concept was to place a drum of fine wire in the vehicle in place of the belt. The wire was attached to an engine to wind it in, rotating the drum that then propelled the vehicle away from its start point. He demonstrated this by means of a cotton reel, with a pencil thrust through the hole in the centre. By resting the ends of this pencil on two books and unwinding the cotton by pulling it from underneath he caused the reel to roll forward, the harder he pulled the faster the cotton unwound and the quicker the reel travelled in the opposite direction.

Brennan began making rough sketches of such a torpedo, and as the concept developed he sought the mathematical assistance of William Charles Kernot, a lecturer at Melbourne University.

After earlier experiments with a single propeller, by 1878 Brennan had produced a working version about long, made from iron boiler plate, with twin contra-rotating propellers. Tests carried out in the Graving Dock at Williamstown, Victoria were successful, with steering proving to be reasonably controllable, although depth-keeping was not.

The British Admiralty had meanwhile instructed Rear Admiral J. Wilson, the Commodore of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Australian Squadron, to investigate the weapon and report back. Alexander Kennedy Smith was also working to obtain the Victoria government&#x27;s backing for the project and raised the subject in the state&#x27;s legislature on 2 October 1877. A grant was eventually awarded for the development of the torpedo, and in March 1879 it was successfully tested in Hobsons Bay, Melbourne.

Brennan had by now established the Brennan Torpedo Company, and had assigned half of the rights on his patent to civil engineer John Ridley Temperley, in exchange for much-needed funds. Brennan and Temperley soon afterwards travelled to Britain, where the Admiralty examined the torpedo and found it unsuitable for shipboard use. However, the War Office proved more amenable, and in early August 1881 a special Royal Engineer committee was instructed to inspect the torpedo at Chatham and report back directly to the Secretary of State for War, Hugh Childers. The report strongly recommended that an improved model be built at government expense. At the time the Royal Engineers – part of the army – was responsible for Britain&#x27;s shore defenses, while the Royal Navy was responsible for its seaward protection.

In 1883 an agreement was reached between the Brennan Torpedo Company and the government. The newly appointed Inspector-General of Fortifications in England, Sir Andrew Clarke, appreciated the value of the torpedo and in spring 1883 an experimental station was established at Garrison Point Fort, Sheerness on the River Medway and a workshop for Brennan was set up at the Chatham Barracks, the home of the Royal Engineers. Between 1883 and 1885 the Royal Engineers held trials and in 1886 the torpedo was recommended for adoption as a harbour defence torpedo.

In 1884 Brennan received a letter from the War Office stating that they had decided to adopt his torpedo for harbour defence and he was invited to attend a meeting to decide the value of his invention. Brennan decided to accept £40,000 as a quick answer to his financial worries but his business partner J.R. Temperley assumed control of the negotiations and demanded £100,000. The War Office agreed to this, but said that it would have to be paid out over a period of three years. Brennan accepted this, but Temperley demanded a further £10,000 for the delay, and after some argument the War Office agreed, also agreeing to pay Brennan a sizable salary to act as production chief. A scandal eventually blew up over this sum, which was wildly extravagant in comparison to the £15,000 paid for manufacturing rights to the Whitehead torpedo only 15 years previously.

The Brennan torpedo became a standard harbour defence throughout the British Empire and was in use for more than 15 years. Operational stations were established in the UK at Cliffe Fort, Fort Albert on the Isle of Wight and Plymouth. Other stations included Fort Camden in Cork Harbour, Ireland, Lei Yue Mun Fort in Hong Kong and Forts Ricasoli and Tigné in Malta.

In 1905 the Committee on Armaments of Home Ports issued a report in which they recommended the removal of all Brennan torpedoes from fixed defences due to their comparatively short range and the difficulty of launching them at night. Manufacture of the Brennan torpedo finished in 1906.

==Installations==

In 1891 It was intended to build 15 stations as indicated in a report to the Director of Artillery.
&quot;We have now completed or in progress 7 installations viz. Thames (Cliffe), Medway (Garrison Pt), Portsmouth (Cliff End/Fort Albert), Plymouth (Pier Cellars/Cawsand Bay), Cork Harbour (Fort Camden), Malta (Tigné and Ricasoli). Further sites proposed as funds become available at Plymouth (Bovisand), Milford Haven, Clyde, Forth, Falmouth, Hong Kong, Singapore and St Lucia.&quot;
The first seven were completed but out of the other eight only the one at Hong Kong was completed. The plans for two installations at Dale Point and Great Castle Head, Milford Haven were drawn up but not carried out.
Four Brennan installations were added to existing fortifications at Fort Albert on the Isle of Wight, Cliffe Fort on the Thames, Garrison Point at the entrance to The Medway and at Fort Ricasoli at the entrance to the Grand Harbour at Malta. With the exception of Ricasoli, the design of these was constrained by the existing structure and resulted in unique designs. In addition the ones at Fort Camden at Cork and Tigné at Malta together with proposed designs for Milford Haven followed a very similar layout while the Installations at Lei Yue Mun in Hong Kong and Pier Cellars at Plymouth were individual designs.

===Installation remains===
The installation at Fort Albert has been completely destroyed. That at Cliffe Fort partially exists, including a slipway and parts of a telescopic control tower. Parts of the installation at Garrison Point survive including the direction stations on the face of the fort and parts of the slipway supports. The complete installation at Pier Cellars still exists although it was greatly modified during later use for midget submarines. At Malta the Tigne installation was later converted for use as the boom defence station but the rooms still exist. At Fort Ricasoli the complex of buildings still exist and the slipway is mostly intact. At Lei Yue Mun the installation has been incorporated into a museum with a replica Brennan Torpedo on display. At Fort Camden most of the installation still exists but is derelict.

==Surviving examples==
The only remaining original Brennan Torpedo is exhibited at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, Kent. However, traces of the installation at Fort Camden in County Cork are visible to this day. The launching rails at Cliffe Fort in Kent are crossed by the public footpath and though heavily rusted are very easy to get close to. There is also a display at Lei Yue Mun Fort in Hong Kong which shows a replica Brennan Torpedo with the side cut away so the workings are visible.

<text>Viscount Rochford is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England.

The first creation was made in favour of Sir Thomas Boleyn in 1525 by King Henry VIII. The title was taken from Boleyn&#x27;s Rochford country estate in Essex. In 1529, Thomas was promoted even further when the King created him &quot;Earl of Wiltshire&quot;. In that same year, Thomas also inherited the wealth and title of his mother&#x27;s ancestors, the &quot;Earls of Ormond&quot;. Thus, Thomas&#x27;s only son, George became known by the courtesy title of &quot;Viscount Rochford&quot;.

The title fell out of use as a courtesy title in 1536 when George Boleyn was executed on false charges of treason. It became extinct when Thomas died in 1539. In 1542, Jane Boleyn, Viscountess Rochford, George&#x27;s widow, was also executed after she was implicated in the fall of Queen Catherine Howard.

The title was recreated in 1619 for Thomas Boleyn&#x27;s great-great-grandson Henry Carey, 4th Baron Hunsdon, who was created Earl of Dover in 1628. Both titles became extinct on the death of the second Earl in 1677.

==Viscounts Rochford, 1st creation (1525)==
*Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire and 1st Earl of Ormond (c. 1477-1539)
*George Boleyn, 2nd Viscount Rochford (1503/1504–1536)

<text>The AEG helicopter was an unusual German aircraft project, intended to create a portable observation post in the form of a tethered helicopter. It achieved lift by use of two contra-rotating rotors powered by an electric motor that was supplied with power from the ground. The device could be folded for transportation on the back of a truck. An observer&#x27;s cabin was suspended underneath the rotor assembly, and could be blown clear by an explosive charge in case of emergency. Development commenced in 1933, but it was never put into service by the military.

The system was tested with an up to 800 metre long Very Low Frequency antenna for communication with submerged submarines. The three power feeder cables doubled as radiators for frequencies from 15 to 60 kHz.

<doc id="1054556" wikidata="Q2577997" url="?curid=1054556" title="Rayagada district">
<text>Rayagada district is a district in the southern Odisha state in India. Rayagada became a separate district in October 1992. Its population consists mainly of tribes, primarily the Khonds and the Soras. In addition to Odia, Kui and Sora are spoken by the district&#x27;s indigenous population. It was founded by Biswanatha Deba Gajapati of the Surjyabansha dynasty of Jeypore.

Rayagada covers an area of , and is divided into eleven blocks. Agriculture is the chief source of income, and paddy, wheat, ragi, green and black gram, groundnut, sweet potato and maize are the district&#x27;s major crops.

== Administrative setup ==
The 11 Blocks and Tahasils in Rayagada district under two administrative Sub-Divisions are listed in the following table.

There are 17 Police Stations under the three Police Sub-Divisions in Rayagada district. They are listed in the following table.

==History==
In the third century BC, during the reign of Ashoka, Odisha was part of the Kalinga empire. The hilly track between the Vamshadhara and Nagavali Rivers was known for its spices. The Rastriks were defeated by Kharvela, the emperor of Kalinga, during the battle of Chawpagada.

Vishwanath Dev Gajapati (1527 - 1571 CE), the suryavanshi king of Nandapur (later Jeypore) established his capital on the bank of Nagavali and named it Rayagada or Rai-gadh. Under his rule the place flourished economically which proved beneficial to the vast kingdom that stretched from the confines of Jharkhand and West Bengal to River Godavari in south. During his reign he fought a war with Quli Qutb Mulk, the first Qutb Shahi Sultan of Golconda and successfully stopped his advance towards his kingdom. However, he had to surrender the rich fertile land located in the middle of Godavari-Krishna Delta to execute a peace treaty which made Godavari the border of the two kingdoms. Rayagada remained under the Kingdom of Jeypore until the dissolution act of 1947.

During the British Raj, Rayagada was under the then-newly demoted Jeypore Samasthanam and was part of Koraput district; it was carved from the district on 2 October 1992 as part of Odisha&#x27;s district-expansion plan.

==Economy==
The district is reportedly rich in bauxite and silicon. In 2006, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Rayagada one of the country&#x27;s 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the 19 districts in Odisha receiving aid from the Backward Regions Grant Fund (BRGF).

==Constituencies==

The district has three Odisha Legislative Assembly (Vidhan sabha) constituencies.
Rayagada district is part of the Koraput Lok Sabha constituency.

==Rail transport==

Rayagada railway station has direct service to Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Raipur, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Jamshedpur, Jodhpur and New Delhi. Gunupur is also an important railway station; via Parlakhemundi, it is connected to Naupada on the main east-coast railway line from Kolkata to Chennai by a broad-gauge line which was converted from narrow gauge in 2011. The narrow-gauge line (the Paralakhemedi Light Railway, or PLR) was established by Gajpatirajas of Paralakhemundi, the former raja of Paralakhemedi, to connect his capital with Naupada. The government authorized construction in 1898, and the line was opened to traffic two years later at a cost of 700,000.

The East Coast Railway began in 1893 with construction of the Cuttack-Khurda Road-Puri line, and its subsequent link along the East Coast to Vijayawada (the junction of Southern Maratha Railway and Nizam&#x27;s Guaranteed State Railway) was opened for traffic between 1893 and 1896. The railway brought service to Naupada in 1894.

Due to a policy change by the British government, the Bengal Nagpur Railway took over East Coast Railway&#x27;s northern section from Vizianagaram to Cuttack, including the Puri branch line, by 23 January 1902. The PLR was also taken over by the Bengal Nagpur Railway that year. In its first few years, the PLR had incurred losses; after 1910 it began making a profit, which increased after 1924–25. This motivated the raja to extend the line to Gunupur in two phases in 1929 and 1931. There were now ten stations between Naupada and Gunupur: Tekkali, Paddasan, Temburu, Ganguvada, Patapatnam, Paralakhemedi, Kashinagar, Lihuri, Bansidhara and Palasingi. The standard PLR locomotive was a 20-ton 0-6-4 tank engine with coupled wheels and a 4.75-ton axle load.

Management of the BNR was taken over by the government of India in October 1944. On 14 April 1952, when Indian Railways was regrouped, it became part of the Eastern Railway. The merger was short-lived, however, and on 1 August 1955 it was merged with the new South Eastern Railway. A set of four postage stamps was released during the 1987 BNR centennial, one stamp featuring the PL 691 locomotive.

The foundation stone was laid for the Naupada-Gunupur gauge conversion at Naupada on 27 September 2002. On 1 April 2003, PLR became a part of the East Coast Railway. The line was closed for gauge conversion on 9 June 2004. Although the Khurda-Bolangir broad-gauge line was approved in 1995, only about half the work has been completed.

<text>Modernismo is a literary movement that took place primarily during the end of the nineteenth and early 20th century in the Spanish-speaking world, best exemplified by Rubén Darío, who is known as the father of &quot;modernismo&quot;. The term &quot;modernismo&quot; specifically refers to the literary movement that took place primarily in poetry. This literary movement began in 1888 after the publication of Rubén Darío&#x27;s &quot;Azul...&quot;. It gave &quot;modernismo&quot; a new meaning. The movement died out around 1920, four years after the death of Rubén Darío. In &quot;Aspects of Spanish-American Literature&quot;, Arturo Torres-Ríoseco writes (1963),

&quot;Modernismo&quot; influences the meaning behind words and the impact of poetry on culture. &quot;Modernismo&quot;, in its simplest form, is finding the beauty and advances within the language and rhythm of literary works.

Other notable exponents are Leopoldo Lugones, Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera, José Asunción Silva, Julio Herrera y Reissig, Julián del Casal, Manuel González Prada, Aurora Cáceres, Delmira Agustini, Manuel Díaz Rodríguez and José Martí. It is a recapitulation and blending of three European currents: Romanticism, Symbolism and especially Parnassianism. Inner passions, visions, harmonies and rhythms are expressed in a rich, highly stylized verbal music. This movement was of great influence in the whole Hispanic world (including the Philippines), finding a temporary vogue also among the Generation of &#x27;98 in Spain, which posited various reactions to its perceived aestheticism.

==Characteristics of &quot;modernismo&quot;==

&quot;Modernismo&quot; is a distinct literary movement that can be identified through its characteristics. The main characteristics of &quot;modernismo&quot; are:

# Giving an idea of the culture and time that we live within, cultural maturity. 
# Pride in nationality (pride in Latin American identity) 
# Search for a deeper understanding of beauty and art within the rhetoric. Gives ideas of meaning through colors and images related to senses. 
# Contains different metrics and rhythms. Uses medieval verses such as the Alexandrine verses from the French. 
# The use of Latin and Greek mythology. 
# The loss of everyday reality to which many of the &quot;modernismo&quot; poems are located within exotic or distant places. 
# The cultivation of a perfection within poetry.

==Notable authors==
===Rubén Darío===
Rubén Darío was the father of &quot;modernismo&quot; and trailblazed the path for future poets. Darío&#x27;s idea of modernistic poems was rejected by poets following World War I because many considered it outdated and too heavy in rhetoric. He developed the idea of modernism after following Spanish poets and being influenced by them heavily. Darío created a rhythm within his poetry to represent the idea of modernism. This changed the metric of Spanish literature. His use of the French method, &quot;Alexandrine verses&quot;, changed and enhanced the literary movement. &quot;Modernismo&quot; literary works also tend to include a vocabulary that many see as lyrical. Modernistic vocabulary drew from many semantic fields to impart a different meaning behind words in his literary work. Examples are items such as flowers, technology, jewelry, diamonds, luxury items, etc. This vocabulary often stemmed from Greek and Latin terms, if not the languages themselves. Darío often mentions the &#x27;swan&#x27; in his literary works to symbolize the idea of beauty and perfection within his writing. The idea of beauty and perfection in poetry is a major characteristic of &quot;modernismo&quot;. In his poem &quot;El Cisne&quot;, he wrote: 

His contributions to the movement of &quot;modernismo&quot; created an opportunity for poets to use their words with meaning behind them within their poems. The swan represents perfection, and according to Darío in his poem, the swan was without flaw had the power to revive someone from the dead. This represents the &quot;modernismo&quot; movement within literary works.
===José Martí===
José Julián Martí y Pérez was born on January 28, 1853, in Havana, Cuba—died May 19, 1895. He was a poet, essayist, and a martyr for Cuban independence from Spain. His dedication to a free Cuba made him a symbol of Cuba&#x27;s struggle for independence from Spain. He organized and unified the movement for Cuban independence and died on the battlefield fighting for it. Martí also used his writing ability to fight for independence. By the age of 15 he had published several poems, and by the age of 16 he founded a newspaper, &quot;La Patria Libre&quot;. This was his way of showing sympathy for the patriots during a revolutionary uprising in 1868. He was sentenced to six months of hard labor. Martí continued to use his talent to call attention to the problems plaguing Latin America. He is considered one of the fathers of &quot;modernismo&quot;.

===Enrique González Martínez=== 
Enrique González Martínez was born April 13, 1871, in Guadalajara, Mexico. He died on February 19, 1952, in Mexico City, Mexico. Martínez is considered one of the last great &quot;modernismo&quot; poets. While others consider him to be the first &quot;post-modernismo&quot; poet, he never completely abandoned &quot;modernismo&quot; characteristics in his work. For the first time in Latin American literature, his works showed more of a local concern in literature. He was a medical doctor, professor, and diplomat to Chile (1920-1922), Argentina (1922-24), Spain, and Portugal (1924-1931). One of his poems, called &quot;Tuércele el cuello al cisne&quot; (Twist the Swan’s Neck), has often been seen as an anti-&quot;modernismo&quot; manifesto. However, this is far from the truth. Enrique González Martínez continued to be a &quot;modernismo&quot; poet for the rest of his life.

<text>A ditloid is a type of word puzzle in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. An example would be &quot;7 D S&quot; representing &quot;seven deadly sins&quot;.

Common words such as &#x27;the&#x27;, &#x27;in&#x27;, &#x27;a&#x27;, &#x27;an&#x27;, &#x27;of&#x27;, &#x27;to&#x27;, etc. are not normally abbreviated. The name &#x27;ditloid&#x27; was given by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; newspaper, originating from the clue &quot;1 = DitLoID&quot;, to which the solution is &quot;1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot;.

==History==

The term was coined by William Hartston: 

For more than 50 years, crosswords were the only word puzzle that had a universally accepted name, but since the 1970s another has emerged and, in 1999, the new teaser was given a name. The word &quot;ditloid&quot; is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary, but a Google search for &quot;ditloid&quot; produces tens of thousands of results. I am delighted by this, because it is a word I coined myself and is my only genuine contribution to the English language.

Will Shortz originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of &quot;Games&quot; magazine, calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of &quot;What&#x27;s hot and what&#x27;s not&quot;, &quot;Us&quot; magazine named the Equation Analysis Test in the &quot;what&#x27;s hot&quot; category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:

Some anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from &quot;Games&quot; (word for word, except for my byline), photocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter, and circulated around the country. &quot;Games&quot; readers who hadn&#x27;t seen the original even started sending it back to &quot;Games&quot; as something the magazine ought to consider publishing! 

Shortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test – Revised Form published in Morgan Worthy&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking&quot; (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy&#x27;s equations were in a different format, for example:


Worthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity of this puzzle:
I got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had written in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the University of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized the format was a good one for eliciting the &quot;aha effect&quot;. After that I used such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on creative thinking.

My guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is that the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in an incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly see an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral rather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had the answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously thinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about to fall asleep.

Another factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge on obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, &quot;I could never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it.&quot; There is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer inside and just need to find it.

<doc id="1054568" wikidata="Q1159141" url="?curid=1054568" title="Dan Petrescu">
<text>Daniel &quot;Dan&quot; Vasile Petrescu (; born 22 December 1967) is a Romanian football manager and former player who is currently in charge of Liga I club CFR Cluj.

As a player, Petrescu was deployed as a full-back or a winger and began his career at Steaua București, with which he played in the 1989 European Cup final. Abroad, he represented Serie A clubs Foggia and Genoa, before moving to the Premier League where he played for Sheffield Wednesday, Chelsea, Bradford City, and Southampton, respectively. With Chelsea, Petrescu won the 1998 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. He earned 95 caps for the Romania national team, being selected in two World Cup squads, in 1994 and 1998, and in two European Championships, in 1996 and 2000.

Petrescu became player-assistant manager to Walter Zenga at Național București towards the end of his playing career, and has since had an extensive career as a head coach in Poland, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, China, Turkey, and South Korea, in addition to his native country. His first job was at Sportul Studențesc, which he led to Liga I promotion. Petrescu has won domestic honours with Unirea Urziceni, Kuban Krasnodar, ASA Târgu Mureș, Jiangsu Suning, and CFR Cluj. He is the second-most successful manager in Romania, tied with Emerich Jenei, winning the league on six occasions (five times with CFR Cluj and once with Urziceni), and was also named Romania Coach of the Year a record five times, tied with Mircea Lucescu.

==Playing career==
===Club===
After playing for Steaua București&#x27;s youth teams, Petrescu was promoted into the first team in 1986 in a match played by Steaua just one month after winning the European Cup. He was loaned to Olt Scornicești for the 1986–87 season, but asked to return to Steaua in 1987.

Petrescu was part of the Steaua squad that reached the European Cup semi-finals (1988) and the final (1989).

In 1991, Petrescu was bought by Italian club Foggia in a period when the club saw promotion to Serie A. In 1993, he moved to Genoa.

Petrescu signed for Sheffield Wednesday in 1994 from Genoa, after a successful 1994 World Cup for Romania. After one season at Hillsborough, he signed for Chelsea and featured prominently there for the next five years. During his term at Chelsea, he was a member of the teams which won the FA Cup in 1997 and the League Cup and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup (both in 1998). After falling out with Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli after a defeat to Manchester United (a game in which he scored), Petrescu never played for the club again and was not even selected as a substitute for the 2000 FA Cup final against Aston Villa.

Turning down a move to Southampton in August 2000, he instead moved to Bradford City for £1 million, scoring one goal, against West Ham United.

In January 2001, Petrescu&#x27;s former Chelsea manager, Glenn Hoddle, eventually persuaded him to join Southampton for a &quot;nominal&quot; fee. He initially settled in well at The Dell, scoring against Leicester City and Manchester City in his first few matches. In March, Hoddle left &quot;the Saints&quot; to take up the managerial reins at Tottenham Hotspur and his replacement, Stuart Gray, dropped Petrescu, replacing him with Hassan Kachloul for the remainder of the season. After making only two substitute appearances in the 2001–02 season, Petrescu was released and returned to Romania.

Petrescu returned to his native Bucharest for a last season as a footballer, with Național București. His last match was the Cupa României final, on 31 May 2003; Național lost 1–0 to Dinamo București, during which Petrescu received much abuse from some of the Dinamo fans as he left the pitch at the end of 90 minutes, even though it was the last game of one of Romania&#x27;s greatest footballers. Presumably, this was because he used to play for Dinamo&#x27;s greatest rivals, Steaua.

===International===
Petrescu registered 95 caps for the senior Romania national team. He made his debut in 1989 and played at four major tournaments: the 1994 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1996, the 1998 World Cup (where the entire Romania squad famously dyed their hair blonde after losing a bet with head coach Anghel Iordănescu), and Euro 2000.

Petrescu missed the 1990 World Cup due to injury. In 1994, Petrescu played in his first World Cup, held in the United States. He scored the only goal in a win against the United States which saw Romania qualify for the second round as group winners. They were then handed a difficult game against Argentina which they managed to win, only to lose to Sweden on penalties in the quarter-finals, with Petrescu one of two Romanians to miss his spot-kick. The miss still haunts him today. &quot;It will probably stay with me for the rest of my life&quot;, he said. After the World Cup, he flew to Saint Thomas and spent two weeks in the Caribbean region.

Euro 1996 was a disappointment for Romania, as they lost all three group matches and only managed to score one goal.

At the 1998 World Cup in France, Petrescu raced past his Chelsea teammate Graeme Le Saux and scored the winning goal against England, which effectively won them the group and ensured they would not have to face Argentina in the second round. He became the second Romanian player to score in two different World Cups after Ștefan Dobay. The Romanians, however, lost their second round match to Croatia, 1–0.

Petrescu was an important piece of the Romanian team at Euro 2000, where they survived a group with Portugal, Germany and England. A new victory over the English team was decisive to qualify for quarter-finals. Romania won all the matches where Petrescu scored.

==Managerial career==
After retiring in 2003, Petrescu pursued a career as a coach. He began his managerial career in July 2003 with second division side Sportul Studențesc, whom he led to promotion before taking over at Rapid Bucharest in December, but stepped down in April 2004, after only six games and four months at the helm. He then returned for a second spell at Sportul Studențesc, where he helped the club to a seventh-place finish in Diviza A.

===Wisła Kraków===
In December 2005, Petrescu agreed to manage 2004–05 Ekstraklasa champions Wisła Kraków in Poland, replacing caretaker manager Tomasz Kulawik. Wisła finished second in the 2005–06 championship. He was dismissed as manager of Wisła on 18 September 2006 after unconvincing results to begin the 2006–07 season. Petrescu accused the Wisła players for not wanting to train hard to improve their performances.

===Unirea Urziceni===

About one week after his termination, Petrescu was appointed as manager of Romanian Liga I newly promoted club Unirea Urziceni, with which he had considerable leading. Under his management, Unirea Urziceni was runner-up in the 2007–08 Cupa României and qualified for the 2008–09 UEFA Cup. He was considered for the vacant manager&#x27;s position at his former club Steaua București after Marius Lăcătuș&#x27; resignation in October 2008. Dorinel Munteanu was appointed instead, but Petrescu has not ruled out a future role at the club. In May 2009, Petrescu won the Liga I title with outsiders Unirea Urziceni, the first title for both Petrescu and his club, and consequently achieving qualification to the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, during which he led Unirea to a shock 4–1 victory at Ibrox against Rangers and a win against Sevilla at home, 1–0.

Petrescu resigned as manager of Unirea Urziceni in December 2009.

===Kuban Krasnodar===

On 28 December 2009, Russian First Division club Kuban Krasnodar hired Petrescu on a five-year contract. Petrescu managed to gain promotion to the Russian Premier League in his debut season, winning the 2010 Russian First Division with a total of 80 points, nine clear of second place. His team conceded only 20 goals in 38 matches.

On 14 August 2012, it was announced that Petrescu had resigned as Kuban Krasnodar manager, citing the need for a new challenge. Kuban later participated in the UEFA Europa League for the first time.

===Dynamo Moscow===

Shortly after his resignation, in August 2012 Petrescu signed a three-year contract reportedly worth €2.5 million per year to join Dynamo Moscow.

On 8 April 2014, his contract was terminated by mutual agreement after a heavy loss to outsiders Anzhi Makhachkala, 0–4. Dynamo Moscow director of sports Guram Adzhoyev stated, &quot;Last year Dan drew the team from the complicated situation, lifted it to the certain level, but recently we have seen no progress.&quot;

=== Al-Arabi ===
In June 2014, Petrescu agreed to coach Qatari side Al-Arabi. On 1 December 2014, his contract with the club was terminated after a mutual agreement.

=== Târgu Mureș ===
On 10 June 2015, Petrescu was announced as the new manager of Liga I runner-up ASA Târgu Mureș. His first, and only, match in charge was in the Supercupa României against champions Steaua București ended with Târgu Mureș winning 1–0. He resigned the next day, to take up a lucrative contract with Chinese side Jiangsu Suning.

===Jiangsu Suning===
On 9 July 2015, Petrescu left Târgu Mureș, claiming his decision was due to the club&#x27;s growing financial problems, though he was immediately hired as manager of Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning on a lucrative deal. Petrescu said in a statement, &quot;It&#x27;s very hard to leave the team in this moment. I don&#x27;t how it&#x27;ll be in China, I hope it will be like in Russia.&quot; In his first season in charge, Petrescu guided the club to victory in the 2015 Chinese FA Cup. On 3 June 2016, Suning announced that Petrescu will no longer be the manager of the club.

===Kuban Krasnodar ===
On 14 June 2016, Petrescu signed a two-year contract with Kuban Krasnodar, after the club was relegated to the second-tier Russian National Football League. On 4 October 2016, with Kuban winning only 3 out of first 15 games and sitting in the 14th spot in the league instead of the expected fight for promotion, he left Kuban by mutual consent, stating that the club had not paid him.

On 29 October 2016, Petrescu was announced as the manager of Emirates Arabian Gulf League side Al-Nasr until the end of the season. He led the club to the final match of the UAE President&#x27;s Cup but was defeated by Al-Wahda in his last game in charge. Al-Nasr appointed Cesare Prandelli as his replacement.

===CFR Cluj===
On 10 June 2017, he was appointed head coach of Liga I club CFR Cluj. On 20 May 2018, Cluj were crowned as Liga I champions for the 2017–18 season after a 1–0 victory over Viitorul Constanța.

===Guizhou Hengfeng===
On 7 June 2018, he was announced as the manager of Chinese club Guizhou Hengfeng to replace Gregorio Manzano.

===Return to CFR Cluj===
On 22 March 2019, Petrescu returned as manager of CFR Cluj after the club had experienced a string of poor performances in the league. He managed to win the 2018-19 Liga I title, successfully defending the trophy he won one year prior. The next season, CFR Cluj sought to have an ambitious European campaign, with the goal to qualify for the group stages of a European Competition. Petrescu guided his side to the 2019-20 Europa League group stage, after a loss in the 2019-20 Champions League playoffs against Slavia Praha, eliminating Scottish giants Celtic on the way. In the group stages, he faced Italian giants SS Lazio, Stade Rennais and meeting Celtic once again, proving to be an almost impossible challenge for CFR. However, with two wins over Stade Rennais and one win over Lazio and Celtic each, CFR finished second in the group stages and qualified for the knock-out phase of the Europa League. There, Petrescu met Spanish giants Sevilla and were eliminated after a 1-1 and 0-0 draws. The team&#x27;s performance in Europe was praised by Romanian media, and Petrescu himself claims it was one of the highlights of his career.

Domestically, CFR were able to maintain their dominance, winning the regular season of the 2019-20 Liga I by a comfortable margin. However, the playoffs proved to be a much bigger challenge, as the COVID pandemic allowed Craiova to stabilize and pose a challenge to Petrescu&#x27;s side. While Craiova lead the standings for most of the playoff phase, following a win on CFR&#x27;s ground and CFR&#x27;s draws against Astra Giurgiu and Gaz Metan Medias, CFR won the reverse fixture against Craiova on the last matchday, thus securing their third consecutive title.

On 19 August 2020, CFR restarted the European campaign against Maltese champions Floriana FC with a 2–0 victory but were eliminated in the second round by Dinamo Zagreb on penalties. After CFR was eliminated from the Europa League, and had begun to faltering domestically, Petrescu announced on 30 November that he and the club had agreed to terminate his contract.

===Third spell at CFR Cluj===
On 28 August 2021, after a weak European campaign which saw the club fail to qualify for the Europa League, CFR Cluj&#x27;s owner Nelutu Varga dismissed Marius Sumudica, and after few days of negotiations, Petrescu signed a contract on 31 August for a third stint at CFR Cluj. On 15 May 2022 Petrescu won his 4th league, and CFR&#x27;s 5th consecutive championship after a 2–1 win over Universitatea Craiova, establishing the Hegemony of CFR Cluj in Romanian football.

===Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors===
On 9 June 2023, Petrescu was appointed as the head coach of K League 1 club Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors. On 6 April 2024, he stepped down after a five-game winless start.

===A fourth chapter at CFR Cluj===
On 15 April 2024, Petrescu agreed to return to CFR Cluj on a three-year contract, with an effective start in the summer of 2024, citing desire to rest after his spell in South Korea. However, on 30 April, Petrescu announced his decision to cancel his break, and took charge of the club for the fourth time, replacing interim manager Ovidiu Hoban. He made his return to Romanian football on 5 May, leading Cluj to a 3–2 win over Rapid București.

== Personal life ==

<doc id="1054589" wikidata="Q54149352" url="?curid=1054589" title="Shahrokh (mythical bird)">
<text>Shahrokh, Shahrukh, or Shah Rukh () is the name of a mythological bird in Iranian literature. It is built of two parts: Shah meaning a king, and Rukh (or Rogh, or Rokh), another enormous mythological bird. In the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; stories, Rukh helps Sinbad escape from a dangerous island.

Shah Rukh, therefore, means king of the Rokh. It may also be written as Shaahinrokh or Avestan Saeenrokh. (E.g., Iranian city of Shaahindezh or Saeendezh and also city of Sannadazh). This has been converted to saeem-rokh, then seem-rokh, seem-rogh and vulgarised as see-morgh. Seemorgh is also known in mystics’ ideas as the king of birds or God.

Soleiman Haim in his Persian-English Dictionary has translated Shahrokh as &quot;The Great Rook&quot; and according to &quot;A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary&quot; Shahrokh means &quot;The horn of a rhinoceros; the rooks in chess; a title given to the sons of the nobility; name of a son of Timure.&quot;

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kou Fumizuki. The manga was serialized in Hakusensha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Young Animal&quot; magazine from 1998 to 2005 and the chapters collected into 17 volumes. It is a love story between two characters who have not seen each other in years, but were once childhood friends.

An anime television series adaptation was animated by J.C.Staff and directed by Masami Shimoda, with Kenichi Kanemaki handling series composition, Kazunori Iwakura designing the characters and Toshio Masuda composing the music. The anime was broadcast on Fuji TV in 2002. A second season titled was set two years later and aired in 2003. There are 37 episodes total, counting an alternate-continuity Christmas special. The anime was released in North America by Geneon and the manga was released in English by Tokyopop. Four visual novels were also released for the PlayStation 2 and Windows 98.

==Plot==
Kaoru Hanabishi, a university student, is the eldest son of Yūji Hanabishi, the head of the Hanabishi Zaibatsu, and was set to take over the zaibatsu after his father retired. His mother, Kumi Honjō, and his father never married, making life difficult for both him and his mother. Kaoru&#x27;s father died when he was five years old. After that, Yūji&#x27;s father, Gen&#x27;ichiro Hanabishi, took Kaoru under his wing and began educating him for the eventual succession. However, Kaoru never felt at home in the Hanabishi family and exiled himself after his mother&#x27;s death. Day by day he felt alone, thinking that he was living life with no reason pushing him on.

There was, however, a person who loved Kaoru so much that she felt had to do whatever was necessary to be with him. Her name is Aoi Sakuraba. Aoi is the only daughter of the owner of the Sakuraba Dry Goods Store (later renamed to Sakuraba Department Store). Kaoru&#x27;s family and Aoi&#x27;s family had expected for Kaoru to marry Aoi, but after Kaoru left, the marriage was canceled. Both families had a friendly relationship, and unbeknownst to Kaoru, Aoi had been in love with him from the start. The Sakuraba family had already been searching for someone suitable, but Aoi was unwilling to marry someone else and walked out, chasing Kaoru.

Both were freed from their families&#x27; affairs but did not know how to make their living. Miyabi Kagurazaki, Aoi&#x27;s caretaker, has Aoi live with her in a grand western-style summer mansion owned by the Sakuraba family, with Kaoru living in a house for servants next to it to prevent a scandal as with the previous. They are soon joined by Tina Foster, an American expatriate; Taeko Minazuki, a clumsy housekeeper; Mayu Miyuki, Kaoru&#x27;s childhood friend; and Chika Minazuki, Taeko&#x27;s cousin. The house is eventually converted to a dormitory and Aoi becomes its landlady.

Eventually, Miyabi helps Kaoru reconcile with the Hanabishis and patch up the original engagement. However, Kaoru&#x27;s half brother attempts to gain control of the Hanabishi Zaibatsu by proposing to Aoi. After Kaoru foils the proposal, Aoi abandons her family name and Kaoru gives the ownership of Hanabishi Zaibatsu to his half-brother. Five years later, Kaoru and Aoi are married.

Christi from THEM Anime Reviews commented that anime adaptation has a &quot;split personality&quot;, since on the one hand, &quot;it wants to be a serious, dramatic romance with a dash of comedy&quot;, and on the other hand, &quot;[it] wants to be a &quot;One Guy/Lots of Girls slapstick harem show&quot;. Despite that, the anime was labeled as &quot;stunning&quot; with its artwork, and the theme music got a good review.

<doc id="1054604" wikidata="Q193517" url="?curid=1054604" title="Emily Blunt">
<text>Emily Olivia Laura Blunt (born 23 February 1983) is a British actress. She is the recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and four British Academy Film Awards. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her as one of the highest-paid actresses in the world in 2020.

Blunt made her acting debut in a 2001 stage production of &quot;The Royal Family&quot; and portrayed Catherine Howard in the television miniseries &quot;Henry VIII&quot; (2003). She made her feature film debut in the drama &quot;My Summer of Love&quot; (2004). Blunt&#x27;s breakthrough came in 2006 with her starring roles in the television film &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and the comedy-drama film &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. The former won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her profile continued to grow with leading roles in the period film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2009), the romantic comedy &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot; (2011), the science fiction films &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; (2011), &quot;Looper&quot; (2012) and &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot; (2014), and the musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014).

Blunt received critical acclaim for playing an idealistic FBI agent in the crime film &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015), an alcoholic in the psychological thriller &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot; (2016), and a survivalist mother in her husband John Krasinski&#x27;s horror film &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; (2018), for which she won a SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has since starred in the sequels &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018) and &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot; (2021), the fantasy adventure &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot; (2021), and the revisionist Western television miniseries &quot;The English&quot; (2022). Her portrayal of Katherine Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biographical thriller film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023) earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Blunt has been working with the American Institute for Stuttering since 2006 to help children overcome stuttering through educational resources and raise awareness of the realities of the condition. She is on the board of directors of the institute, and hosts a gala for it to raise funds for speech therapy scholarships for children and adults.

==Early life==
Emily Olivia Laura Blunt was born in London on 23 February 1983. She is the second of four children, born to a former actress and English teacher, Joanna Mackie, and a barrister, Oliver Blunt QC. Her mother gave up acting to parent full time before Blunt started school. Blunt described herself as a &quot;shy and awkward&quot; child, who began having difficulties with stuttering, a condition she described as debilitating and &quot;like an imposter living in your body.&quot; She experienced it at its worst between the ages of seven and 14. Intimidated by speaking, she spent much time watching people, as well as creating elaborate games for herself and playing the cello. She credits a school teacher with encouraging her to perform in class plays, where using voices different from her own allowed her to disconnect from herself and speak fluently. It also gave her the confidence to continue on the stage and discover her love of acting. She has said that her stutter largely receded in adulthood, but still occasionally emerges under stress. She attended Hurtwood House, a sixth-form boarding school in Surrey, known for its performing arts programme. After appearing in a school play at the Edinburgh Festival, Blunt was discovered and signed by an agent. Once she finished her school exams, she began auditioning.

==Career==
===2001–2004: Early work===
In November 2001, Blunt made her professional acting debut at age 18 in Peter Hall&#x27;s &quot;West End&quot; production of the play &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, in which she played the granddaughter of Judi Dench&#x27;s character. Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that &quot;Peter Hall&#x27;s direction and Anthony Ward&#x27;s tremendous set combine with all this to make &quot;The Royal Family&quot; a terrific night&#x27;s entertainment&quot;, and that &quot;it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble&quot;. For her performance, Blunt was named &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The following year, she portrayed Eugenie in Nicholas Wright&#x27;s play &quot;Vincent in Brixton&quot; at the National Theatre, and Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at Chichester Festival Theatre. In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama &quot;Boudica&quot;, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans. That same year, she was praised for her performance as the 16th-century Queen Catherine Howard in the two-part British television drama &quot;Henry VIII&quot;.

In 2004, Blunt made her theatrical film debut in Paweł Pawlikowski&#x27;s critically acclaimed independent British drama &quot;My Summer of Love&quot;, about an infatuation between two young women from different socioeconomic backgrounds in the English countryside. The film involved much improvisation, which Blunt found an interesting challenge, later stating that Pawlikowski&#x27;s approach was &quot;free spirited, collaborative and alive.&quot; Co-starring as Tamsin, she received considerable attention for her performance, garnering critical praise, with David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; writing: &quot;Press and Blunt are major discoveries ... they conjure up the role-playing raptures of youth with perfect poetic pitch&quot;. Blunt won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer and was nominated for the British Independent Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer. She credited her experience making the film as having an impact on her career choices, stating that it was &quot;such a foray into the great unknown ...[like] putting your feet to the fire&quot; and she &quot;loved that feeling of terror and excitement&quot; and &quot;looked for it ever since.&quot;

===2005–2010: &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; and breakthrough===
Blunt&#x27;s international breakthrough came in 2006. She co-starred as the troubled only child of a New Labour spin doctor in the British television drama film &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and played Emily Charlton, the senior assistant of fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep), in the comedy-drama film &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; was a commercial success, grossing . Blunt&#x27;s performance was deemed a standout, with Clifford Pugh of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; asserting that &quot;[Blunt] has many of the film&#x27;s best lines and steals nearly every scene she&#x27;s in.&quot; Blunt won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance in &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her performance in &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;. She also received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for the latter. At the 79th Academy Awards, she and co-star Anne Hathaway co-presented the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, with both acting as their characters from the film. Blunt also appeared in the independent mystery drama &quot;Irresistible&quot; (2006). After &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, Streep described Blunt as &quot;the best young actress I&#x27;ve worked with in some time, perhaps ever&quot;.

Blunt&#x27;s profile continued to rise, and in 2007, she appeared in four films: the horror film &quot;Wind Chill&quot;, the romantic drama &quot;The Jane Austen Book Club&quot;, the comedy-drama &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot;, and the biographical comedy-drama &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;. In 2008, Blunt appeared in &quot;Sunshine Cleaning&quot; in the role of Norah Lorkowski, an underachiever who starts a crime-scene clean-up business with her sister Rose (Amy Adams). The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it received positive reviews, particularly for Adams&#x27; and Blunt&#x27;s performances. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine commented &quot;This funny and touching movie depends on two can-do actresses to scrub past the biohazard of noxious clichés that threaten to intrude. Adams and Blunt get the job done.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; agreed, stating &quot;Amy Adams and Emily Blunt [...] attack their roles with vivacity and dedication...&quot; She then starred in &quot;The Great Buck Howard&quot; as Valerie Brennan, which premiered at the same festival.

In 2009, Blunt portrayed Queen Victoria in the independent period drama &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, directed by Jean-Marc Vallée and written by Julian Fellowes, which focused primarily on her early life and reign, as well as her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Blunt admitted to having little prior knowledge of the Queen, but after consulting her mother, found her to be &quot;remarkable&quot; and &quot;a very 21st century sort of woman.&quot; Blunt&#x27;s performance earned critical accolades, and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress, among others. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; concluded that &quot;Director Jean-Marc Vallée&#x27;s images have a creamy stateliness, but this is no gilded princess fantasy – it&#x27;s the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant.&quot; That same year, Blunt received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.

She starred in the Toby Spanton–directed short film &quot;Curiosity&quot;. She also voiced Matilda Mouseling, the mother of the titular character, in the television series &quot;Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps&quot;. In 2010, Blunt played a supporting role in the period horror film &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, starring Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. A re-adaptation of the 1941 film of the same name, the film received mainly negative reviews, and according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, was one of the largest box-office failures of all time. Blunt was offered the role of Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow for &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; (2010), but she was contractually obligated by 20th Century Fox to join the Jack Black-led comedy film &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; after the studio exercised an option it had for her when she signed on for &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;.

===2011–2014: Science-fiction and comedy films===
In 2011, Blunt co-starred with Matt Damon in the thriller &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot;, playing a dancer who is &quot;being mysteriously kept apart&quot; from a politician. The film earned generally positive reviews, with critics praising Blunt and Damon&#x27;s chemistry. Blunt starred in the British romantic comedy-drama &quot;Salmon Fishing in the Yemen&quot;, directed by Lasse Hallström. She played a financial adviser who recruits a fisheries expert to help realise a sheikh&#x27;s vision of bringing the sport of fly fishing to the Yemen desert, resulting in a spiritual journey for both in the process. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, receiving positive reviews, as did Blunt&#x27;s performance. Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted &quot;Blunt and [co-star Ewan McGregor] are two of the most gifted and attractive actors working today, able to play off each other with great style...&quot; Blunt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance. Also that year, she made a cameo appearance in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Muppets&quot;, as Miss Piggy&#x27;s receptionist, and starred in the independent comedy-drama &quot;Your Sister&#x27;s Sister.&quot; In November 2011, Blunt was named the ambassador of the new Yves Saint Laurent fragrance Opium.

In 2012, Blunt starred in the romantic comedy &quot;The Five-Year Engagement&quot;, directed by Nicholas Stoller and co-starring Jason Segel, in which she and Segel played a couple whose relationship becomes strained when their engagement is continually extended. The film earned positive reviews, with Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York &quot;Daily&quot; News remarking that &quot;Blunt has never been more relaxed, and she and Segel have a believably warm chemistry.&quot; She then starred in &quot;Looper&quot;, a science fiction action film directed by Rian Johnson. Blunt played Sara, a tough farm woman and single mother, who aids and falls in love with a time-traveller. The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, where it served as the opening film, and earned highly positive feedback. Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; credited Blunt for &quot;effectively [revealing] Sara&#x27;s tough and vulnerable sides.&quot; Also that year, she starred in the comedy-drama &quot;Arthur Newman&quot; as the troubled Charlotte, who is trying to run away from her past. The film received generally mixed-to-negative reviews.

In 2014, Blunt starred in &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, a film adaptation of the Japanese novel &quot;All You Need Is Kill&quot;, written by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. Blunt played Sergeant Rita Vrataski, a Special Forces warrior tasked with training a public relations officer to defeat invading extraterrestrials. Blunt trained three months for her role, &quot;focusing on everything from weights to sprints to yoga, aerial wire work and gymnastics&quot;, and studying Krav Maga. The film was commercially successful, grossing and earned positive reviews. Many critics took note of the atypically dominating role portrayed by Blunt, and Justin Chang of &quot;Variety&quot; noted that &quot;Blunt is alert, energized and emotionally present in a none-too-taxing role.&quot; For her performance, Blunt won the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.

Blunt then played the role of the Baker&#x27;s Wife in The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, directed by Rob Marshall and featuring an ensemble cast. Ironically, Blunt was pregnant throughout filming, while playing a character who is barren throughout the film&#x27;s first act. The film was a commercial success and earned generally positive reviews, with Blunt earning praise for her acting and singing. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; remarked that &quot;When Blunt is onscreen, these woods are alive with the magic of a fractured fairy tale...&quot; She was nominated for her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.

===2015–present: Established actress===
In 2015, Blunt starred in the crime thriller &quot;Sicario&quot;, directed by Denis Villeneuve. Blunt played Kate Macer, a principled FBI agent assigned to take down the leader of a powerful Mexican drug cartel. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim. Blunt received considerable praise for her performance, with Dan Jolin of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine calling it &quot;nuanced&quot;, and stating that &quot;her straight-arrow-sharp determination becomes painfully dulled&quot;, and while Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found her character implausible, he praised Blunt for &quot;[brazening] out any possible absurdity with great acting focus and front&quot;. Blunt was nominated for her second consecutive Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.

In 2016, Blunt co-starred in &quot;The Huntsman: Winter&#x27;s War&quot;, which serves as both a prequel and sequel to &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot; (2012). The film, directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, was mostly dismissed by critics. Blunt then headlined the mystery thriller &quot;The Girl on the Train&quot;, directed by Tate Taylor. Based on Paula Hawkins&#x27;s best-selling novel of the same name, Blunt played Rachel Watson, an alcoholic who becomes involved in a missing person investigation. While the film received mixed reviews from critics, who felt it failed to live up to the novel, Blunt&#x27;s performance earned considerable praise. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers remarked that &quot;the movie gives away the game faster than the novel&quot;, but credited Blunt for &quot;playing the hell out of [her character] and adding a touch of welcome empathy. [She] digs into the role like an actress possessed – there&#x27;s not an ounce of vanity here, [and she] raise[s] &quot;Girl&quot; to the level of spellbinder.&quot; She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.

After providing her voice for the 2017 animated films &quot;My Little Pony: The Movie&quot; and &quot;Animal Crackers&quot;, Blunt made her return to live action in her husband John Krasinski&#x27;s horror film &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, which follows a family being tormented by monstrous creatures that hunt by sound. The script was originally written by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who began writing it in January 2016 based on a concept they conceived in college, and they wanted Blunt for the role of the mother. When Krasinski re-wrote the script, he wrote it with Blunt in mind for the role, but did not ask her to do it as she had just had a child, was working on another film, and he was concerned that if he asked she would either decline it or accept it to support him. &quot;I just thought if she does this, she has to come to it on her own.&quot; Blunt initially did not want to be cast, but after reading Krasinski&#x27;s draft on a plane flight she felt she needed to do it as the story &quot;represented some of my deepest fears – of not being able to protect my children.&quot; Blunt contributed to the pre-production stage of the film. &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; served as the opening night film at the 2018 South by Southwest film festival, where it received critical acclaim; Eric Kohn of IndieWire lauded the cast for &quot;contribut[ing] credible intensity to their scenes with a degree of sophistication rare for this type of material&quot;, while Laura Prudom of IGN remarked that, &quot;Blunt, in particular, is put through the wringer in ways that would seem almost farcical, if she didn&#x27;t play them with such compelling conviction.&quot;

The same year, Blunt played the title character in Rob Marshall&#x27;s musical fantasy film &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;. It served as a sequel to the 1964 film, with Blunt taking over the role from Julie Andrews. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Variety&quot; found Blunt to be &quot;practically perfect in every way&quot; and added that she &quot;inhabits Mary Poppins&#x27; snappishly entrancing spirit, and in the musical numbers she generates her own spit-spot radiance&quot;. She received two SAG nominations for her performances in &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; and &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, winning Best Supporting Actress for &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, and she also received her sixth Golden Globe nomination for &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;. In 2020, Blunt guest-starred in her husband&#x27;s web series &quot;Some Good News&quot;, which began streaming on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic. She starred in the romantic drama &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot;based on John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s play &quot;Outside Mullingar&quot;. The part required her to speak with an Irish accent; neither the film nor her accent were well received. In the same year, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her as the sixth highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of .

Blunt reprised her role in the horror sequel &quot;A Quiet Place Part II&quot; (2021), which was released after a year-long delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It became one of the first major Hollywood films to be released theatrically since the beginning of the pandemic. Peter Bradshaw bemoaned that the &quot;excellent&quot; Blunt did not have more screen time. As with the first film, it also emerged as a commercial success. Later that year, Blunt starred alongside Dwayne Johnson in the adventure film &quot;Jungle Cruise&quot;, based on the eponymous amusement ride. It was released simultaneously in theatres and digitally on Disney+ Premier Access. Jeannette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; disliked the picture and opined that &quot;not even Emily Blunt, doing her best Katharine Hepburn impression, can keep this leaky boat ride afloat&quot;. The following year, Blunt played an avenging mother in the television miniseries &quot;The English&quot;, a western from Hugo Blick. Critics were impressed with her performance. Lucy Mangan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined, &quot;Blunt is at her best yet, giving us a woman made brave and undauntable by resolve&quot;. She received another SAG Award nomination for it.

In Christopher Nolan&#x27;s biographical film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Blunt portrayed the eponymous scientist&#x27;s wife, Katherine, who was a member of the Communist Party USA. She took a pay cut to work on the film, earning in lieu of her usual salary. Nolan said that he thought about &quot;running away&quot; from the character while writing the script as she was &quot;terrifying&quot;, but Blunt humanised her and surprised him in how she embraced her negative qualities; &quot;No vanity, no fear of humiliation, no wanting to control the way she would appear&quot;. The film was critically acclaimed, although some criticism was made of the writing of the female characters. Blunt&#x27;s performance received praise, and was singled out for elevating the limited material she had. Writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, Dan Jolin said that Blunt &quot;busts out of the supportive/suffering wife archetype as the alcoholic but sharp-witted Kitty Oppenheimer&quot; and delivers &quot;one of the film&#x27;s most rousing scenes in an intense verbal duel with bullish lawyer Roger Robb&quot;, and Tomris Laffly of &quot;The Wrap&quot; called her performance &quot;subtly scene-stealing&quot;. Blunt once again received nominations for the Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA Award, in addition to her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. With a worldwide gross of over , &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; emerged as Blunt&#x27;s highest-grossing film. Her next release that year, the Netflix crime drama &quot;Pain Hustlers&quot; opposite Chris Evans, received poor reviews from critics.

Blunt next starred with Ryan Gosling in David Leitch&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; (2024). For her part as a filmmaker in it, she drew inspiration from Greta Gerwig. IGN&#x27;s Siddhant Adlakha was appreciate of the romantic chemistry between Blunt and Gosling. It did not perform well commercially. She then had a voice role in Krasinski&#x27;s live-action animated fantasy film &quot;IF&quot;. 

As of February 2025, Blunt has filmed the sports drama &quot;The Smashing Machine&quot;, starring Dwayne Johnson as wrestler Mark Kerr, which is set for release later in the year. She will also star in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Disclosure&quot;, co-starring Josh O&#x27;Connor.
==Reception==
Journalists have noted Blunt&#x27;s versatility as an actor and her roles in various genres, including drama, comedy, musicals, and action. &quot;The Guardian&quot; observed her ability to not be pigeonholed into a type of role, and wrote that she &quot;specialises in a sort of calculated understatement&quot;, praising her &quot;insight into what makes characters tick and her facility for accents&quot;. Commenting on her engaging screen presence, Rachel Rosenblint of &quot;Elle&quot; stated that &quot;she has a knack for playing subtle, unspoken notes like a virtuoso&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; regarded Blunt as having a &quot;taste for the offbeat and a fetching lack of vanity when it comes to playing disagreeable women&quot; and noted her &quot;adventurous spirit&quot; as a performer. Describing the nuances of a performance, &quot;The Age&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s no wonder that Meryl Streep has already pronounced Blunt &quot;the best young actress I&#x27;ve worked with in some time, perhaps ever&quot;.&quot; Aaron Hicklin said in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that Blunt&#x27;s career &quot;has been marked by a succession of stretching new roles&quot;. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; assessed that from the start of her career, Blunt &quot;has always proved up for whatever the challenge may be&quot;, and noted her &quot;fluidity&quot; in working between drama and comedy. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; stated that Blunt has &quot;a number of iconic roles under her belt&quot;. Her work in action roles has also been singled out, with &quot;Collider&quot; writing that it is &quot;proof that action cinema has the potential to be morally, ethically, and emotionally nuanced&quot;, and deeming Blunt one of the &quot;rare performers&quot; that exceed as both an actor and movie star. Catherine Shoard of &quot;The Guardian&quot; named her &quot;the biggest British female movie star of her generation&quot;, comparing her to Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan, Rachel Weisz, and Kate Winslet. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; commented that she has portrayed &quot;a kaleidoscope of mesmerizing characters&quot; and found a &quot;delicate balance&quot; as &quot;a movie star with character-actor range&quot;.

==Advocacy==
Blunt helps to promote and raise funds for the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation that advocates for girls&#x27; education, co-founded by Malala Yousafzai. She also works with Family Reach, an organisation that helps financially support families affected by cancer. Blunt has also been working with the American Institute for Stuttering since 2006 to help children overcome stuttering through educational resources and raise awareness of the realities of the condition. She is on the board of directors of the institute, and hosts a gala for it each year to raise funds for speech therapy scholarships for children and adults.

==Personal life==
Blunt was in a relationship with Canadian singer Michael Bublé from 2005 to 2008. She and American actor John Krasinski were introduced to each other by a mutual friend and began dating in November 2008. They became engaged in August 2009 and married in Como, Italy in July 2010. They have two daughters, one born in 2014 and the other in 2016.

In 2012, Blunt became the sister-in-law of actor Stanley Tucci when he married her sister Felicity. In 2015, Blunt became an American citizen through naturalisation, making her a dual citizen of the UK and US.

<doc id="1054609" wikidata="Q1235098" url="?curid=1054609" title="Komla Agbeli Gbedemah">
<text>Komla Agbeli Gbedemah (17 June 1913 – 11 July 1998) was a Ghanaian politician and Minister for Finance in Ghana&#x27;s Nkrumah government between 1954 and 1961. Known popularly as &quot;Afro Gbede&quot;, he was an indigene of Anyako in the Volta Region of Ghana.

==Early life and career==
Komla Gbedemah was born on 17 June 1913 in Warri, Nigeria, of Ewe parentage. He attended Adisadel College in Cape Coast for his secondary education from 1925 to 1929 and Achimota College from 1929 to 1933.
He became employed as a teacher at a school in the Akuapem District in The Gold Coast. In 1939, he became a Science Master at Accra Academy in Jamestown. Alongside teaching, he engaged in the timber and confectionery business. In 1943, he quit his teaching role at Accra Academy to engage in the timber trade full-time.

== Political career ==

Gbedemah was originally a member of the United Gold Coast Convention. He left with Dr Kwame Nkrumah to form the Convention People&#x27;s Party (CPP). Gbedemah was an important member of the CPP because of his organizational ability. He was influential in getting Nkrumah elected to the Legislative Council on 8 February 1951 at the Elections for the Legislative Assembly. He organized Nkrumah&#x27;s entire campaign while Nkrumah was still in prison, detained by the colonial government. Nkrumah duly won the Accra Central Municipal seat. This led to Nkrumah being released on 12 February 1951 and his being invited to form a government. Gbedemah is in some reports named as being the first to welcome Nkrumah after his release from Fort James prison.

Gbedemah, who himself got elected into the Legislative Assembly, became the first Ghanaian Minister for Health and Labour in Nkrumah&#x27;s government. In 1954, he became the Minister of Finance, a position he held for seven years. He was influential in getting an initially reluctant United States government to back the building of the Akosombo Dam. Later, as his relationship with Nkrumah deteriorated, Gbedemah was demoted by Nkrumah to the post of Minister of Health in May 1961. It is alleged by US sources that at a point, Gbedemah was considering the overthrow of Nkrumah. He is quoted as saying: &quot;I would be sorry to have to do it but country has had enough of Nkrumah&#x27;s arrogance, whims and madness.&quot; Nkrumah demanded Gbedemah&#x27;s resignation in September 1961.

Gbedemah was forced into exile later the same year, after worsening relations between him and Nkrumah over what he perceived to be Nkrumah&#x27;s financial indiscipline. He is alleged to have fled as there were plans to place him under preventive detention. While in exile, he is known to have continued to lobby the US over the Akosombo dam project.

Gbedemah formed and led the National Alliance of Liberals into the 1969 general election. His campaign slogan &quot;Say it loud, I am black and proud!&quot; was taken from the popular James Brown tune. After the election, Gbedemah was barred from taking his seat in parliament. This followed a Supreme Court ruling, upholding the NLC barring members of the CPP accused of financial crimes from holding public office for ten years. This decision led him to retire from active involvement in politics.

From 1957 to 1961, Gbedemah served as President of the World Federalist Movement, an international non-governmental organization promoting federal world government. He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

== Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant incident ==
In the United States, Gbedemah is most widely known from an incident on 10 October 1957 when U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower apologized to him after he was refused service in a Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant in Dover, Delaware. Gbedemah told the staff: &quot;The people here are of a lower social status than I am, but they can drink here and we can&#x27;t. You can keep the orange juice and the change, but this is not the last you have heard of this.&quot; The incident resulted in Gbedemah being invited to breakfast at the White House.

<doc id="1054629" wikidata="Q269582" url="?curid=1054629" title="Setuid">
<text>The Unix and Linux access rights flags setuid and setgid (short for &quot;set user identity&quot; and &quot;set group identity&quot;) allow users to run an executable with the file system permissions of the executable&#x27;s owner or group respectively and to change behaviour in directories. They are often used to allow users on a computer system to run programs with temporarily elevated privileges to perform a specific task. While the assumed user id or group id privileges provided are not always elevated, at a minimum they are specific.

The flags codice_1 and codice_2 are needed for tasks that require different privileges than what the user is normally granted, such as the ability to alter system files or databases to change their login password. Some of the tasks that require additional privileges may not immediately be obvious, though, such as the codice_3 command, which must send and listen for control packets on a network interface.

==File modes==

The codice_1 and codice_2 bits are normally represented as the values 4 for codice_1 and 2 for codice_2 in the high-order octal digit of the file mode. For example, codice_8 has both the codice_1 and codice_2 bits () set, and also the file read/write/executable for the owner (7), and executable by the group (first 1) and others (second 1). Most implementations have a symbolic representation of these bits; in the previous example, this could be codice_11.

Typically, codice_12 does not have a recursive mode restricted to directories, so modifying an existing directory tree must be done manually, with a command such as .

==Effects==

The codice_1 and codice_2 flags have different effects, depending on whether they are applied to a file, to a directory or binary executable or non-binary executable file. The codice_1 and codice_2 flags have an effect only on binary executable files and not on scripts (e.g., Bash, Perl, Python).

===When set on an executable file===

When the codice_1 or codice_2 attributes are set on an executable file, then any users able to execute the file will automatically execute the file with the privileges of the file&#x27;s owner (commonly root) and/or the file&#x27;s group, depending upon the flags set. This allows the system designer to permit trusted programs to be run which a user would otherwise not be allowed to execute. These may not always be obvious. For example, the ping command may need access to networking privileges that a normal user cannot access; therefore it may be given the setuid flag to ensure that a user who needs to ping another system can do so, even if their account does not have the required privilege for sending packets.

==== Security impact====
For security purposes, the invoking user is usually prohibited by the system from altering the new process in any way, such as by using codice_19, codice_20 or sending signals to it, to exploit the raised privilege, although signals from the terminal will still be accepted.

While the codice_1 feature is very useful in many cases, its improper use can pose a security risk if the codice_1 attribute is assigned to executable programs that are not carefully designed. Due to potential security issues, many operating systems ignore the codice_1 attribute when applied to executable &quot;shell scripts&quot;.

The presence of codice_1 executables explains why the codice_25 system call is not available to non-root users on Unix. See limitations of codice_26 for more details.

===When set on a directory===
Setting the codice_2 permission on a directory causes files and subdirectories created within to inherit its group ownership, rather than the primary group of the file-creating process. Created subdirectories also inherit the codice_2 bit. The policy is only applied during creation and, thus, only prospectively. Directories and files existing when the codice_2 bit is applied are unaffected, as are directories and files moved into the directory on which the bit is set.

Thus is granted a capacity to work with files amongst a group of users without explicitly setting permissions, but limited by the security model expectation that existing files permissions do not implicitly change.

The codice_1 permission set on a directory is ignored on most UNIX and Linux systems. However FreeBSD can be configured to interpret codice_1 in a manner similar to codice_2, in which case it forces all files and sub-directories created in a directory to be owned by that directory&#x27;s owner - a simple form of inheritance. This is generally not needed on most systems derived from BSD, since by default directories are treated as if their codice_2 bit is always set, regardless of the actual value. As is stated in codice_34, &quot;When a new file is created it is given the group of the directory which contains it.&quot;

==Examples==
===Checking permissions===

Permissions of a file can be checked in octal form and/or alphabetic form with the command line tool codice_35
[ torvalds ~ ] $ stat -c &quot;%a %A&quot; ~/test/
1770 drwxrwx--T
===SUID===
4701 on an executable file owned by &#x27;root&#x27; and the group &#x27;root&#x27;

A user named &#x27;thompson&#x27; attempts to execute the file. The executable permission for all users is set (the &#x27;1&#x27;) so &#x27;thompson&#x27; can execute the file. The file owner is &#x27;root&#x27; and the SUID permission is set (the &#x27;4&#x27;) - so the file is executed as &#x27;root&#x27;.

The reason an executable would be run as &#x27;root&#x27; is so that it can modify specific files that the user would not normally be allowed to, without giving the user full root access.

A default use of this can be seen with the codice_36 binary file. codice_36 needs to modify codice_38 and codice_39 which store account information and password hashes for all users, and these can only be modified by the user &#x27;root&#x27;.
[ thompson ~ ] $ stat -c &quot;%a %U:%G %n&quot; /usr/bin/passwd
4701 root:root /usr/bin/passwd

[ thompson ~ ] $ passwd
passwd: Changing password for thompson
The owner of the process is not the user running the executable file but the owner of the executable file

== Security ==
Developers design and implement programs that use this bit on executables carefully in order to avoid security vulnerabilities including buffer overruns and path injection. Successful buffer-overrun attacks on vulnerable applications allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the rights of the process exploited. In the event that a vulnerable process uses the codice_1 bit to run as codice_42, the code will execute with root privileges, in effect giving the attacker root access to the system on which the vulnerable process is running.

Of particular importance in the case of a codice_1 process is the environment of the process. If the environment is not properly sanitized by a privileged process, its behavior can be changed by the unprivileged process that started it. For example, GNU libc was at one point vulnerable to an exploit using codice_1 and an environment variable that allowed executing code from untrusted shared libraries.

==History==
The codice_1 bit was invented by Dennis Ritchie and included in codice_46. His employer, then Bell Telephone Laboratories, applied for a patent in 1972; the patent was granted in 1979 as patent number . The patent was later placed in the public domain.

<text>In infrared photography, the photographic film or image sensor used is sensitive to infrared light. The part of the spectrum used is referred to as near-infrared to distinguish it from far-infrared, which is the domain of thermal imaging. Wavelengths used for photography range from about 700 nm to about 900 nm. Film is usually sensitive to visible light too, so an infrared-passing filter is used; this lets infrared (IR) light pass through to the camera, but blocks all or most of the visible light spectrum; these filters thus look black (opaque) or deep red.

When these filters are used together with infrared-sensitive film or sensors, &quot;in-camera effects&quot; can be obtained; false-color or black-and-white images with a dreamlike or sometimes lurid appearance known as the &quot;Wood Effect,&quot; an effect mainly caused by foliage (such as tree leaves and grass) strongly reflecting infrared in the same way visible light is reflected from snow. There is a small contribution from chlorophyll fluorescence, but this is marginal and is not the real cause of the brightness seen in infrared photographs. The effect is named after the infrared photography pioneer Robert W. Wood, and not after the material wood, which does not strongly reflect infrared.

The other attributes of infrared photographs include very dark skies and penetration of atmospheric haze, caused by reduced Rayleigh scattering and Mie scattering, respectively, compared to visible light. The dark skies, in turn, result in less infrared light in shadows and dark reflections of those skies from water, and clouds will stand out strongly. These wavelengths also penetrate a few millimeters into skin and give a milky look to portraits, although eyes often look black.

==History==

Until the early 20th century, infrared photography was not possible because silver halide emulsions are not sensitive to longer wavelengths than that of blue light (and to a lesser extent, green light) without the addition of a dye to act as a color sensitizer. The first infrared photographs (as distinct from spectrographs) to be published appeared in the February 1910 edition of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; and in the October 1910 edition of the &quot;Royal Photographic Society Journal&quot; to illustrate papers by Robert W. Wood, who discovered the unusual effects that now bear his name.
The RPS co-ordinated events to celebrate the centenary of this event in 2010. Wood&#x27;s photographs were taken on experimental film that required very long exposures; thus, most of his work focused on landscapes. A further set of infrared landscapes taken by Wood in Italy in 1911 used plates provided for him by C. E. K. Mees at Wratten &amp; Wainwright. Mees also took a few infrared photographs in Portugal in 1910, which are now in the Kodak archives.

Infrared-sensitive photographic plates were developed in the United States during World War I for spectroscopic analysis, and infrared sensitizing dyes were investigated for improved haze penetration in aerial photography. After 1930, new emulsions from Kodak and other manufacturers became useful to infrared astronomy.
Infrared photography became popular with photography enthusiasts in the 1930s when suitable film was introduced commercially. &quot;The Times&quot; regularly published landscape and aerial photographs taken by their staff photographers using Ilford infrared film. By 1937, 33 kinds of infrared film were available from five manufacturers including Agfa, Kodak and Ilford.
Infrared movie film was also available and was used to create day-for-night effects in motion pictures. A notable example being the pseudo-night aerial sequences in the James Cagney/Bette Davis movie, &quot;The Bride Came C.O.D.&quot;

False-color infrared photography became widely practiced with the introduction of Kodak Ektachrome Infrared Aero Film and Ektachrome Infrared EIR. The first version of this, known as Kodacolor Aero-Reversal-Film, was developed by Clark and others at the Kodak for camouflage detection in the 1940s. The EIR film became more widely available in 35mm form in the 1960s but has been since discontinued.

Infrared photography became popular with a number of 1960s recording artists, because of the unusual results; Jimi Hendrix, Donovan, Frank Zappa and the Grateful Dead all issued albums with infrared cover photos. The unexpected colors and effects that infrared film can produce fit well with the psychedelic aesthetic that emerged in the late 1960s.

==Techniques and special equipment==

===Infrared filters===

Infrared light lies between the visible and microwave portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Infrared light has a range of wavelengths, just like visible light has wavelengths that range from red light to violet. &quot;Near infrared&quot; light is closest in wavelength to visible light, ranging from approximately 700 to 5000 nm and &quot;far infrared&quot; is closer to the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from approximately 25 to 350 μm. The longer, far infrared wavelengths are about the size of a pin head and the shorter, near infrared ones are the size of cells, or are microscopic.

Historically, black-and-white infrared films are sensitive to near infrared wavelengths shorter than approximately 860 nm, and retain significant sensitivity to blue wavelengths. Infrared-passing filters are used in black-and-white infrared photography to block blue wavelengths and limit the photograph to infrared wavelengths only. Without filters, infrared negative films look much like conventional negative films because the blue sensitivity lowers the contrast and effectively counteracts the infrared look of the film. Typically, a red filter (Wratten #25) is recommended as the best compromise, which removes blue wavelengths while still passing enough visible light for focusing.
Some photographers use orange or red filters to allow slight amounts of blue wavelengths to reach the film, and thus lower the contrast. The majority of black-and-white infrared art, landscape, and wedding photography is done using orange (Wratten #15 or 21), red (#23, 25, or 29) or visually opaque (#72) filters over the lens to block the blue visible light from the exposure. Very dark-red (#29) filters block out almost all blue, and visually opaque (#70, 89b, 87c, 72) filters block out all blue and also visible red wavelengths, resulting in a more pure-infrared photo with a more pronounced contrast.

Instead of the Wratten number, some manufacturers embed the transition or cutoff wavelength in the name of the filter. For example, Hoya markets the R72 (720 nm cutoff, 750 nm 50% transition) and RM90 (900 nm cutoff) filters for infrared photography. B+W (Schneider Kreuznach) and Heliopan sell filters using glass sourced from Schott AG, including types RG695 (695 nm transition, considered approximately equivalent to Wratten #89B), RG715 (715 nm, #88A), RG780 (780 nm, #87), RG830, RG850, and RG1000.

===Focusing infrared===

Many manual focus lenses for 35 mm single-lens reflex cameras (SLR) and medium format SLR have a red dot, line or diamond, often with a red &quot;R&quot; called the infrared index mark, which can be used to achieve proper infrared focus; many autofocus lenses no longer have this mark. For these lenses, after visual focus is achieved for the intended subject, the distance indicated by the visual focusing mark is then re-set to the infrared index mark. Without refocusing, a sharp infrared photograph can be taken by proper hyperfocal settings, which generally requires a tripod, a narrow aperture (like ); however, wider apertures like can produce sharp photos when the lens is meticulously refocused to the infrared index mark, and only if this index mark is the correct one for the filter and film in use. Diffraction effects inside a camera are greater at infrared wavelengths so that stopping down the lens too far may actually reduce sharpness.

Some lens manufacturers such as Leica never put IR index marks on their lenses. The reason for this is that any index mark is only valid for one particular IR filter and film combination, and may lead to user error. Even when using lenses with index marks, focus testing is advisable as there may be a large difference between the index mark and the subject plane.

Most apochromatic (&#x27;APO&#x27;) lenses do not have an Infrared index mark and do not need to be refocused for the infrared spectrum because they are already optically corrected into the near-infrared spectrum. Catadioptric lenses do not often require this adjustment because their mirror containing elements do not suffer from chromatic aberration and so the overall aberration is comparably less. Catadioptric lenses do, of course, still contain lenses, and these lenses do still have a dispersive property.

When a SLR camera is fitted with a filter that is opaque to visible light, the reflex system becomes useless for both framing and focusing, one must compose the picture without the filter and then attach the filter. This requires the use of a tripod to prevent the composition from changing.

Zoom lenses may scatter more light through their more complicated optical systems than prime lenses, that is, lenses of fixed focal length; for example, an infrared photo taken with a 50 mm prime lens may have more contrast than the same image taken at 50 mm with a 28–80 zoom.

==Film cameras==
Many conventional cameras can be used for near-infrared photography, where the portion of the infrared is light of a wavelength only slightly longer than that of visible light. Photography of the far-infrared spectrum with longer wavelengths is called thermography and requires special equipment.

With some patience and ingenuity, most film cameras can be used. However, some cameras of the 1990s that used 35mm film have infrared sprocket-hole sensors that can fog infrared film (their manuals may warn against the use of infrared film for this reason). Other film cameras are not completely opaque to infrared light.

Arguably the greatest obstacle to infrared film photography has been the difficulty of obtaining infrared-sensitive film. Kodak typically manufactured just one or two batches of infrared films per year. In addition, the popularity of digital photography has pushed film manufacturers to discontinue niche film products, including infrared-sensitive films. The discontinuance of Konica Infrared 750 (2006), Kodak High-Speed Infrared (2007), and Efke IR820 Aura (2012) has now narrowed the selection for black and white infrared film to Agfa Aviphot films, made for areal photography. These films are not available directly to consumers and must be purchased in large quantities and non-consumer formats. This film is often bought by large companies and sold in consumer quantities and formats under different brands, such as Rollei Infrared 400 film.

===Black-and-white infrared film===
Black-and-white infrared negative films are sensitive to wavelengths in the 700 to 900 nm near infrared spectrum, and most also have an inherent sensitivity to blue light wavelengths. Kodak High-Speed Infrared (HIE), which produced negatives for photographic prints, was one of the most common black-and-white infrared films used. Because HIE was so prevalent, black-and-white infrared photographs have been associated with a notable halation effect or glow often seen in the highlights, similar to the soft focus effect of uncorrected spherical aberration. This halation is an artifact of the clear polyester film base used for HIE and not inherent to infrared photography; it is caused by the absence of an anti-halation layer on the back side of Kodak HIE film, which results in a scattering or blooming around the highlights that would usually be absorbed by the anti-halation layer in conventional films. In addition, the clear backing means that Kodak HIE must only be loaded and unloaded in total darkness.

Infrared black-and-white films require special development times but exposed film can be processed using standard black-and-white photographic developers and chemicals, including D-76; the choice of chemical may affect the characteristic exposure/density curve. Kodak HIE film has a polyester film base that is very stable but extremely easy to scratch, therefore special care must be used in the handling of Kodak HIE throughout the development and printing/scanning process to avoid damage to the film.

Kodak HIE was sensitive to 900 nm. Other infrared black-and-white films include:
* Agfa Aviphot (sensitive to approximately 770 nm) Widely available in most formats, such as 135 film, 120 film, and sheets by larger resellers (such as Rollei as 80S, 400S and IR 400) and individuals. Occasionally 220 film, 70mm film, and other formats not sold at scale may be available from individual sellers.
* Fotokemika/Efke IR 820 (also sensitive to approximately 800 nm)
* Ilford SFX 200 (&quot;extended&quot; sensitivity in the near-infrared range to 740 nm)
* Konica Infrared 750 (sensitive to approximately 800 nm)
===Color infrared film===

Like HIE, the most commonly used infrared color reversal film, also called transparency or slide film, was manufactured by Kodak and sold as Ektachrome Infrared (EIR), under code 2236, packaged as a 36-exposure roll; in addition, Kodak made EIR in bulk lengths (for the motion picture industry) and the similar Aerochrome III Infrared for aerial photography (codes 1443 and SO-734). EIR originally was developed during World War II as a means to detect camouflaged objects, taking advantage of the difference in infrared reflectance between plants and green paint, and was adopted by the military and scientific communities after the war. It was not marketed to consumers until the 1960s. To improve camouflage paint, companies began incorporating infrared-reflecting materials.
The structure of all color reversal films (both standard and infrared-sensitive) contains at least three separate photosensitive layers. Each layer is specifically sensitized to respond to a different set of wavelengths; for instance, a standard color reversal film has red-, green-, and blue-sensitive layers. During the modern E-6 process of development, grains of silver halide that were sensitized by the appropriate wavelengths of light in each layer react with a reducing agent to form metallic silver particles. The unexposed grains are then sensitized chemically during a second development step and produce oxidized developer, which react with dye coupler compounds embedded in the film emulsion layers to form negative images in various color dyes, respective to how the silver halide was originally sensitized for each layer.

In conventional color films, the topmost (blue-sensitive) layer gets exposed to light prior to the green- and red-sensitive layers stacked behind it. Since the green- and red-sensitive layers also retain an inherent sensitivity to blue light, a yellow filter layer is placed behind the blue-sensitive layer, in front of the green and red-sensitive layers. This serves to minimize undesired passthrough of shorter wavelengths that are not supposed to expose the bottom layers.

During development, each emulsion layer forms a negative image in the appropriate subtractive color (cyan-magenta-yellow): the blue-sensitive layer forms a yellow-dyed (&quot;minus-blue&quot;) negative image, the green-sensitive layer forms a magenta-dyed negative image, and the red-sensitive layer forms a cyan-dyed negative image. When the slide is viewed or projected by passing white light through these stacked layers, the visible wavelengths are filtered correspondingly with the reversed colors. For example, blue light will result in no yellow dye formation in the blue-sensitive layer, but cyan and magenta dye will form in the red- and green-sensitive layers. By projecting white light through the combined layers, blue is produced: cyan (aka negative-red) removes red and passes blue and green, and magenta (aka negative-green) removes green and passes blue and red; when these layers are stacked, only blue light is passed.

Since silver halides are sensitive to wavelengths of light outside of the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, longer wavelengths corresponding with infrared light can be captured by using suitable dyes. Without specialized dyes, silver halides are only sensitive to a wavelength shorter than around 450 nm.


Color infrared reversal films share a similar three-layer emulsion structure with conventional color reversal films, with the blue-sensitive layer replaced by an infrared-sensitive layer, and different dyes used for each of the layers. An external yellow photographic filter is used (Wratten #12 or equivalent) to block the blue and violet wavelengths, which results in a false-color image by translating or remapping the captured spectrum (from green through infrared) to the visible spectrum: Infrared wavelengths are mapped to the red color, even though the infrared wavelengths are not normally visible. Similarly, visible red wavelengths are remapped to green, and visible green band wavelengths are remapped to blue. The filter and color remapping means visible blue and violet wavelengths are not captured. The infrared-sensitive layer will form cyan dyes (negative-red), while the green-sensitive layer will form yellow dyes (negative-blue) and the red-sensitive layer will form magenta dyes (negative-green).

The external yellow filter is used because each emulsion layer in color films (both conventional and infrared) has an inherent sensitivity for short-wavelength radiation (blue and violet visible wavelengths of light) due to the silver halide chemistry. Since there is no blue-sensitive layer, color infrared films also omit the internal yellow filter layer built into conventional color films to protect the following layers. This requires photographers to use an external blue-blocking filter to absorb blue and violet wavelengths of light, which gives the filter a yellow color.
Early color infrared films were developed in the older E-4 process, but Kodak later manufactured a color transparency film that could be developed in standard E-6 chemistry, although more accurate results were obtained by developing using the AR-5 process. Like HIE, EIR uses a clear polyester film base and must be loaded in complete darkness. In general, color infrared does not need to be refocused to the infrared index mark on the lens.

Kodak EIR loses its infrared sensitivity as it ages, giving photographs a cyan cast, as fewer grains in the infrared-sensitive (cyan-forming) layer will be sensitized. Anecdotally, EIR is most sensitive up to approximately 21 days after purchase, and stabilizes at a decreased sensitivity thereafter.

===Availability===

Kodak discontinued production of HIE Infrared 35 mm film at the end of 2007, stating that, &quot;Demand for these products has been declining significantly in recent years, and it is no longer practical to continue to manufacture given the low volume, the age of the product formulations and the complexity of the processes involved.&quot; At the time it was discontinued, HIE Infrared 135-36 was available at a street price of around $12.00 a roll at US mail order outlets.

Also in 2007, Kodak announced that production of the 35 mm version of their color infrared film (Ektachrome Professional Infrared/EIR) would cease as there was insufficient demand.

In 2008, Los Angeles photographer, Dean Bennici started cutting and hand rolling Aerochrome color Infrared film. All Aerochrome medium and large format which exists today came directly from his lab. The trend in infrared photography continues to gain momentum with the success of photographer Richard Mosse and multiple users all around the world.

Since 2011, all formats of color infrared film have been discontinued. Specifically, Aerochrome 1443 and SO-734.

==Digital cameras==

Digital camera sensors are inherently sensitive to infrared light, which could interfere with normal photography by confusing the autofocus calculations, because infrared light wavelengths may focus at a different point than visible light wavelengths, or by softening the image, if the red channel becomes oversaturated. Also, some clothing is transparent in the infrared, leading to unintended (at least to the manufacturer) uses of video cameras. Thus, to improve image quality and protect privacy, many digital cameras have infrared blockers or hot mirrors installed in front of their sensors. Depending on the subject matter, adding a infrared-passing filter to the lens may not be practical with these cameras because the exposure times become overly long, often in the range of 30 seconds, creating noise and motion blur in the final image. However, for some subject matter the long exposure does not matter or the motion blur effects actually add to the image. Some lenses will also show a &#x27;hot spot&#x27; in the center of the image as their coatings are optimized for visible light and not for IR.

There is no currently available digital camera that will directly produce the same results as Kodak color infrared film although equivalent images can be produced using a full spectrum converted infrared digital camera and a Kolari Vision Color IR Chrome lens filter. Similar effects can be achieved by taking two exposures, one infrared and the other full-color, and combining in post-production. A yellow (minus-blue) filter can also be used, which produces a single image that can also be post-processed to emulate the Ektachrome look. The color images produced by digital still cameras using infrared-pass filters are not equivalent to those produced on color infrared film. The colors result from varying amounts of infrared passing through the color filters on the photo sites, further amended by the Bayer filtering. While this makes such images unsuitable for the kind of applications for which the film was used, such as remote sensing of plant health, the resulting color tonality has proved popular artistically.

Color digital infrared, as part of full spectrum photography is gaining popularity. The ease of creating a softly colored photo with infrared characteristics has found interest among hobbyists and professionals.

===Hot mirror removal===

One method of infrared photography using digital cameras is to remove the infrared blocker in front of the sensor and replace it with a glass cover that either removes or restricts visible light (infrared-only conversion) or one that passes infrared wavelengths (&quot;full spectrum&quot; conversion). This filter is behind the mirror of DSLRs, so the camera can be used normally - handheld, normal shutter speeds, normal composition through the viewfinder, and focus, all work like a normal camera. Metering works but is not always accurate because of the difference between visible and infrared refraction. When the IR blocker is removed, many lenses which did display a hotspot cease to do so, and become perfectly usable for infrared photography. Additionally, because the red, green and blue micro-filters remain and have transmissions not only in their respective color but also in the infrared, enhanced infrared color may be recorded.

Since the Bayer filters in most digital cameras may also absorb a significant fraction of the infrared light, converted cameras are sometimes not very sensitive to infrared wavelengths and can sometimes produce false colors in the images. An alternative approach is to use a Foveon X3 sensor, which does not have absorptive filters on it; the Sigma SD10 DSLR has a removable IR blocking filter and dust protector, which can be simply omitted or replaced by a deep red or complete visible light blocking filter. The Sigma SD14 has an IR/UV blocking filter that can be removed/installed without tools. The result is a very sensitive digital IR camera.

While it is common to use a filter that blocks almost all visible light, the wavelength sensitivity of a digital camera without internal infrared blocking is such that a variety of artistic results can be obtained with more conventional filtration. For example, a very dark neutral density filter can be used (such as the Hoya ND400) which passes a very small amount of visible light compared to the near-infrared it allows through. Wider filtration permits an SLR viewfinder to be used and also passes more varied color information to the sensor without necessarily reducing the Wood effect. Wider filtration is however likely to reduce other infrared artefacts such as haze penetration and darkened skies. This technique mirrors the methods used by infrared film photographers where black-and-white infrared film was often used with a deep red filter rather than a visually opaque one.

===Post-processing===
Another common technique with near-infrared filters is to swap blue and red channels in software (e.g. Adobe Photoshop) which retains much of the characteristic &#x27;white foliage&#x27; while rendering skies a glorious blue.

Phase One digital camera backs can be ordered in an infrared modified form.

==Applications and specific implementations==

The health of foliage can be determined from the relative strengths of green and infrared light reflected using color infrared film; this shows in color infrared as a shift from red (healthy) towards magenta (unhealthy).

Several Sony cameras had a feature branded as Night Shot, which physically moves the blocking filter away from the light path, making the cameras very sensitive to infrared light. Soon after its development, this facility was &#x27;restricted&#x27; by Sony to make it difficult for people to take photos that saw through clothing. To do this the iris is opened fully and exposure duration is limited to long times of more than 1/30 second or so. It is possible to shoot infrared but neutral density filters must be used to reduce the camera&#x27;s sensitivity and the long exposure times mean that care must be taken to avoid camera-shake artifacts.

Fuji have produced digital cameras for use in forensic criminology and medicine which have no infrared blocking filter. The first camera, designated the S3 PRO UVIR, also had extended ultraviolet sensitivity (digital sensors are usually less sensitive to UV than to IR). Optimum UV sensitivity requires special lenses, but ordinary lenses usually work well for IR. In 2007, FujiFilm introduced a new version of this camera, based on the Nikon D200/ FujiFilm S5 called the IS Pro, also able to take Nikon lenses. Fuji had earlier introduced a non-SLR infrared camera, the IS-1, a modified version of the FujiFilm FinePix S9100. Unlike the S3 PRO UVIR, the IS-1 does not offer UV sensitivity. FujiFilm restricts the sale of these cameras to professional users with their EULA specifically prohibiting &quot;unethical photographic conduct&quot;.

Remote sensing and thermographic cameras are sensitive to longer wavelengths of infrared (see ). They may be multispectral and use a variety of technologies which may not resemble common camera or filter designs. Cameras sensitive to longer infrared wavelengths including those used in infrared astronomy often require cooling to reduce thermally induced dark currents in the sensor (see Dark current (physics)). Lower cost uncooled thermographic digital cameras operate in the Long Wave infrared band (see Thermographic camera). These cameras are generally used for building inspection or preventative maintenance but can be used for artistic pursuits as well, such as this image of a cup of coffee.

<text>Basilisk II is an emulator which emulates Apple Macintosh computers based on the Motorola 68000 series. The software is cross-platform and can be used on a variety of operating systems.

Christian Bauer (developer of a Mac 68k emulator ShapeShifter for Amiga) released the first version of Basilisk II in March 1999. The emulator was expected to be highly portable across several computing platforms and provided some improvements in comparison to ShapeShifter - e.g. no limit for number of emulated disks, improved CD-ROM support and support for the host file system. However, early reviews highlighted several issues like difficult configuration and limited compatibility with recommendation of ShapeShifter as a better choice for Amiga users. Newer releases mitigated these problems, 2005 review of the MorphOS version noted only slow CPU emulation (in comparison to built-in 68k CPU emulation for Amiga applications in MorphOS) as a major issue.

The latest version of Classic Mac OS that can be run within Basilisk II is Mac OS 8.1, the last 680x0-compatible version, released in January 1998. Mac OS 8.5, which came out nine months later, was PowerPC-only and marked the end of Apple&#x27;s 680x0 support.

Ports of Basilisk II exist for multiple computing platforms, including AmigaOS 4, BeOS, Linux, Amiga, Windows NT, macOS, MorphOS and mobile devices such as the PlayStation Portable.

Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Basilisk II is free software, and its source code of is available on GitHub.

<doc id="1054644" wikidata="Q1306554" url="?curid=1054644" title="Eine Nacht in Venedig">
<text>Eine Nacht in Venedig (&quot;A Night in Venice&quot;) is an operetta in three acts by Johann Strauss II. Its libretto was by F. Zell and Richard Genée based on &quot;Le Château Trompette&quot; by Eugène Cormon and Richard Genée. The farcical, romantic story involves several cases of mistaken identity.

The piece premiered in 1883 in Berlin and then Vienna. It became one of Strauss&#x27;s three most famous stage works and has been seen in New York, London and elsewhere, and has been adapted for film.

==History==
The piece premiered in Berlin on 3 October 1883 in the , and it is Strauss&#x27;s only operetta to be premiered outside Vienna. Although the press praised Strauss&#x27;s music, they criticized the libretto as banal and silly; for instance, references were made to roast beef made from the sole of a boot and, in the waltz scene, the character of Duke Urbino was singing passages of &quot;meows&quot;, which was met with much embarrassment from the Berlin audience. Unperturbed, Strauss made several alterations to the work with his librettists and scored a triumph in his native Vienna at the Theater an der Wien, where it ran for 44 consecutive performances from 9 October 1883. The operetta became established as one of Strauss&#x27;s three most recognisable stage works alongside &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; and &quot;Der Zigeunerbaron&quot;. A 1923 production, starring Richard Tauber at the Theater an der Wien, used a score and libretto revised by composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold and writer Hubert Marischka, which was later used in other productions and recordings.
The work played at Daly&#x27;s Theatre in 1884, staged by J.C. Duff’s Comic Opera Company, and in 1900 at the American Theatre on Broadway in New York. English language versions have included one with a translation by Lesley Storm and lyrics by Dudley Glass that played at the Cambridge Theatre in London in 1944, one for English National Opera in 1976 at the London Coliseum by Murray Dickie and a 1980s production for the Light Opera of Manhattan by Alice Hammerstein Matthias. Ohio Light Opera performed the work in 1981, 1991, 1999 and 2009, recording it in 2000.

In 1934 the work was adapted as a German operetta film, &quot;A Night in Venice&quot;, directed by Robert Wiene. A Hungarian version of the film was made simultaneously. Like both films before, &quot;&quot; (1942) uses only Strauss&#x27;s music and the title &quot;Night in Venice&quot;. The 1953 version &quot;A Night in Venice&quot; follows the libretto of F. Zell and Richard Genée.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===

It is an evening in eighteenth-century Venice. In a square on the Grand Canal, with a view across to the Ducal Palace and the Isle of San Giorgio, people stroll around as the sun goes down, while the tradeswomen call out their wares. The young Neapolitan macaroni cook Pappacoda observes that, for all the splendours of the city, Venetians do not have everything without their macaroni cook. &quot;Macaroni as long as the Grand Canal, with as much cheese as there is sand in the Lido&quot; – that is what Pappacoda offers. The young man is approached by Enrico, a naval officer, enquiring whether the Senator Delacqua is at home. When he is told that he is at a sitting of the Senate, Enrico sees it as an opportunity for a few private minutes with the Senator&#x27;s young wife Barbara. However, she also is out, so Enrico slips Pappacoda a coin to give Barbara a letter with the message that Enrico will be ready for her at nine o&#x27;clock that evening.

As the people watch, a boat arrives carrying Annina, a fisher-girl, who is hawking her &quot;fruitti di mare&quot;. Pappacoda greets her, hinting that what has really brought her hither is the imminent arrival of the Duke of Urbino, and more particularly his barber Caramello, Annina&#x27;s sweetheart. &quot;Caramello is a monster, a ne&#x27;er-do-well, and a conceited blockhead into the bargain&quot;, she pouts. &quot;Stupidity is no hindrance to love&quot;, Pappacoda retorts, sampling an oyster. &quot;After all, I&#x27;m passionately in love with Ciboletta, Signora Delacqua&#x27;s pretty cook – a girl as stupid as this oyster, and yet just as appetising, just as worthy of catching!&quot;

When Barbara Delacqua returns home, Pappacoda gives her the message from Enrico and receives another tip for his troubles. Annina departs with Barbara, leaving Pappacoda to greet his own girlfriend, Ciboletta. She is wondering when they are going to get married, and he promises that they will do so just as soon as he gets a position in service.

The senators return from a stormy session, discussing the banquet that the Duke of Urbino is to give today when he arrives for his annual Carnival-time visit to Venice. The Duke is a notorious womaniser and has already cast his roving eye on Barbara, so Delacqua has taken the precaution of arranging for his wife to be taken by gondola to Murano to stay with an old abbess aunt in the convent there.
The Duke&#x27;s arrival is signalled by the appearance of a gondola carrying his personal barber, Caramello, who is warmly greeted by the crowd. He proceeds to show off his close acquaintance with the Duke and rounds things off with an agile tarantella for good measure. He quickly spots Annina, but she is not too pleased that he has practically ignored her for the past year. She becomes interested enough when the subject of their talk turns to marriage, but Caramello explains that he is eager to obtain a position as the Duke&#x27;s steward before committing himself to matrimony.

In pursuit of amorous adventures on his master&#x27;s behalf Caramello has learned with interest from Pappacoda that a gondolier is due to take Barbara Delacqua to Murano at 9 p.m. What he does not know is that his own girlfriend, Annina, has been persuaded by Barbara to take her place in the gondola, so that Barbara may spend her time with Enrico Piselli. Annina is determined to be back within the hour so that she may join in the Carnival dancing with Caramello, Pappacoda and Ciboletta in masks borrowed from their masters.

The Duke arrives and greets Venice and its people. He loves them all, he tells them, though it appears that he seems to love the pretty girls rather more than the rest. To the Duke&#x27;s great delight, Caramello reveals to him his plan to take the place of the gondolier in the gondola calling for Barbara. Instead of taking her to Murano, he will then deliver her to the Duke&#x27;s palace. Pulling on a gondolier&#x27;s cloak and hood, he sets off on his adventure. The scene is set and the evening still, as the Duke looks up to Delacqua&#x27;s balcony and sings a serenade. Inside the Delacqua house Barbara and Annina are making their final preparations, putting on the domino masks that will disguise them, as they await the sound of the gondolier&#x27;s song that is to be the agreed signal. Below, Ciboletta brings Pappacoda a carnival costume.

Finally the voice of Caramello is heard from the gondola singing the gondolier&#x27;s song. Delacqua helps into the gondola the masked figure he believes to be his wife and he bids her farewell as the Duke looks on with keen anticipation. A group of sailors appear and, with Enrico at their head, they sing a serenade to Delacqua for his birthday the following day. While Delacqua is on the balcony thanking the singers, Barbara slips out to join Enrico. The birthday serenade merges with the sound of Caramello&#x27;s gondola song as night falls on Venice and the disguised Caramello glides away with his masked sweetheart Annina, neither knowing the true identity of the other.

===Act 2===
Watching from a room in his palace, the Duke is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the gondola in which Caramello is due to bring Barbara, as Agricola, Constantia and the other senators&#x27; wives arrive in their carnival costumes, ignoring their husbands&#x27; fears for their moral safety. Finally the gondola is seen approaching, and the Duke ushers his guests into the ballroom while he prepares to greet his special lady guest. When Caramello and Annina arrive and masks are removed, Caramello is dismayed to discover who it is he has brought for the Duke&#x27;s pleasure, but Annina fancies making the most of the opportunity with the Duke that fate has given her.

Caramello does his best to warn the Duke off Annina. &quot;Don&#x27;t trust her. She scratches and bites!&quot; he warns. Finally Annina and the Duke are left alone, and the disguised Annina is shocked and thrown on the defensive when the Duke rhapsodises over the receptive response that his advances to Barbara had previously aroused. As the orchestra in the ballroom strikes up a waltz, the Duke takes the reluctant Annina into his arms.

Caramello finds an excuse to interrupt the amorous scene, and Annina persuades the Duke to take her into the ballroom. While they are away, Caramello opens the doors to the Duke&#x27;s apartments, and a crowd enters, including Pappacoda, prominent in a faded, shabby senator&#x27;s costume with false, misshapen nose and spectacles and with his pockets stuffed with sausages, meat and pastries. Pappacoda has brought with him all his tradesmen friends, to whom he has distributed invitations given to him by Caramello. They are wide-eyed at the scale of the Duke&#x27;s hospitality and, having introduced his friends to Caramello, Pappacoda invites them to help themselves.

As the Duke seeks somewhere to be alone with Annina, a group of senators and their wives detain him. Among them are Senator Delacqua and his supposed wife, and the Duke is taken aback at being introduced to a second Barbara. However, Annina identifies this &quot;wife&quot; for the Duke as the masked Ciboletta. The Duke goes along with Ciboletta&#x27;s pretence, as he recalls the serenade he had sung to Barbara at previous carnival times. Delacqua pushes the supposed Barbara forward to put his own case for the position of the Duke&#x27;s steward, but Ciboletta instead asks for a place for Pappacoda as the Duke&#x27;s personal cook, and the Duke is only too ready to oblige her. Delacqua departs to join Barbara in Murano, leaving the Duke to take supper with Annina and Ciboletta. Caramello has sent away the servants, and he and Pappacoda wait on the trio personally in order to keep their eyes open for any unwelcome developments.

As the Duke courts the two ladies, Caramello and Pappacoda repeatedly interrupt. The cook gives a timely discourse on his culinary arts before the senators&#x27; wives arrive seeking the Duke&#x27;s attention. By now midnight is approaching – the time when the Duke must go to lead the revels in the Piazza San Marco. When the bells of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica sound out, Annina joins in the revelry, and all go off in masks to enjoy themselves.

===Act 3===
In the Piazza, before the moonlit cathedral, the revellers are celebrating, but Caramello stands alone, reflecting upon Annina&#x27;s flirtation with the Duke and lamenting the fickleness of women. Ciboletta, meanwhile, is looking for Pappacoda to tell him of his appointment as the Duke&#x27;s personal cook, a piece of news that dispels Pappacoda&#x27;s wrath at Ciboletta&#x27;s adventures with the Duke. Now they can marry. When Pappacoda goes to pay his respects to the Duke, Ciboletta reveals to the Duke that the young lady on whom he had been lavishing his attention was not Barbara but Caramello&#x27;s sweetheart Annina. When the Duke finally catches up with Annina, he finds her telling the senators&#x27; wives all about her escapade with him. Fanfares announce the start of the grand Carnival procession, in which all sections of Venetian life are represented and, when it is over, the pigeons of St. Mark&#x27;s flutter down into the square.

Delacqua has returned, distressed by the discovery that Barbara is not in Murano and, when she appears with Enrico, the young man reassures Delacqua with a story of how he has rescued his aunt Barbara from an impostor gondolier. The Duke is decidedly less interested in Barbara when he discovers that she has a nephew as big as Enrico, and he rewards Caramello for delivering him from a potentially awkward situation by making him his steward. Caramello and Annina can therefore join Pappacoda and Ciboletta in marrying, and the revelries are set fair to go on long into the night.

<text>Thierry Lincou (born 2 April 1976, in La Réunion) is a retired professional squash player from France. He reached the World No. 1 ranking in January 2004. That year, Lincou won the World Open title, the Hong Kong Open and the Super Series Finals. He has been known as one of the greatest lateral movers in the game, as well as being one of the fittest players in the history of squash. His nickname, &quot;titi&quot;, was coined by a former competitor, Amr Shabana. He called Thierry &quot;titi-tight,&quot; because of his precision and tight shots.

==Career overview==
Lincou has enjoyed considerable success at the elite level of the game, rising steadily through the ranks since joining the professional squash circuit in 1994. He has beaten all of the world&#x27;s top squash players including Peter Nicol, Jonathon Power, David Palmer, Lee Beachill, and many others. Lincou has been one of the most consistent players on the circuit – reaching the semi-finals of nine successive PSA events in 2003, and holding the World No. 1 ranking throughout 2005.

In 2003, Lincou was a member of the French team which finished runners-up to Australia at the World Team Squash Championships.

In 2004, he reached the PSA World Ranking Number 1 and became the first Frenchman to top the world rankings. In December, he won the 2004 World Open Squash Championship in Doha in Qatar against Lee Beachill 5–11, 11–2, 2–11, 12–10, 11–8. He became the first Frenchman to win the World Championship. In the same year, he won the Hong Kong Open against Nick Matthew in the final.

In 2006, he won 4 PSA World Tour titles including the Canary Wharf Squash Classic in London and the prestigious Pakistan Open in Islamabad.

He was runner-up of the prestigious British Open in 2006 against Nick Matthew and in 2007 against Grégory Gaultier.

He won 11 titles of the French Nationals and was one of only five players to have maintained themselves in the top 10 without interruption for 10 years at the PSA World Tour.

In October 2012, Thierry retired at the age of 36 after winning the Bluenose Squash Classic, the 23rd PSA World Tour title of his career.

He is currently coaching the Massachusetts Institute of Technology varsity squash team.

<doc id="1054655" wikidata="Q215516" url="?curid=1054655" title="Mount Helicon">
<text>Mount Helicon (; ) is a mountain in the region of Thespiai in Boeotia, Greece, celebrated in Greek mythology. With an altitude of , it is located approximately from the north coast of the Gulf of Corinth. Some researchers maintain that Helicon was also the Greek name of mount Rocca Salvatesta in Sicily as a river started from it was called also Helikon.

==Greek mythology==
In Greek mythology, two springs sacred to the Muses were located here: the Aganippe and the Hippocrene, both of which bear &quot;horse&quot; (ἵππος &quot;híppos&quot;) in their names. In a related myth, the Hippocrene spring was created when the winged horse Pegasus aimed his hoof at a rock, striking it with such force that the spring burst from the spot. On Mount Helicon too was the spring where Narcissus was inspired by his own beauty.

Mount Helicon and the Hippocrene spring were considered to be a source of poetic inspiration. In the late eighth or early seventh century BCE, the poet Hesiod placed a reference to the Muses on the Helicon at the very beginning of his &quot;Theogony&quot;:

Later in the text, he describes a meeting between himself and the Muses on Mount Helicon, where he had been pasturing sheep when the goddesses presented him with a laurel staff, a symbol of poetic authority. The Helicon thus was an emblem of poetical inspiration. (It is not clear, if the other names mentioned – Permessus and Olmeius – are different springs or other names for Hippocrene.) In the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot; to Poseidon – generally dated to the seventh century, but a bit later than Hesiod&#x27;s works – a brief invocation, the god is hailed as &quot;Lord of Helicon&quot;.

In his &quot;Aitia&quot;, the third-century BC poet Callimachus recounts his dream in which he was young once more and conversed with the Muses on Helicon. and thus follows explicitly in the footsteps of Hesiod. He also placed on Helicon the episode in which Tiresias stumbles upon Athena bathing and is blinded but at the same time given the art of prophecy, by which means poetry and prophecy are implicitly connected to each other. Perhaps reflecting this account, the Roman poet Ovid, in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, writes of Minerva visiting the muses on Mount Helicon.

The cult centers on Helicon established in the Valley of the Muses, a fertile valley near Thespiai and Ascra, under the influence of the Hesiodic texts, in Hellenistic times if not before, were visited by Pausanias in the second century CE. He explored the sacred grove by the spring Aganippe thoroughly and left a full description as it then was. He saw images of Eupheme, nurse of the Muses, and of the legendary poet Linus &quot;in a small rock which has been worked into the manner of a cave&quot; (cf. the religious use of grottoes). In the &quot;temenos&quot; were statues, some by famous masters, of Apollo and Dionysus and famed poets. The absence of Homer at Helicon has been noticed by Richard Hunter: &quot;The presence of Homer would spoil the party, for the tendency to see these as rival figures for supremacy in &quot;epos&quot; is familiar from the &quot;Contest of Homer and Hesiod&quot;, parts of which derive from the classical period&quot;. But even if the presence of Homer at the festival Hesiod mentions in &quot;Works and Days&quot; (650–59) was a later interpolation, the sacrificial tripod which Hesiod won at a contest in Chalcis in Euboea was still on view at Helicon in Pausanias&#x27; day.

==Since the Renaissance==

The poetical image of Helicon established by the Roman poets became once more an emblem of cultural inspiration with the Renaissance and is often referred to in poetry. 
The Hungarian composer Leó Festetics (1800–1884) held &#x27;Helicon balls&#x27; at his Festetics Palace near Keszthely (whose Slavic place name suggests the Hungarian equivalent &quot;hely&quot;), also naming the library he founded the Helikon Library. John Milton, in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, refers to Mount Helicon as &quot;th&#x27;Aonian mount&quot; at the very beginning (line 15) of the poem. Torquato Tasso refers to &quot;Elicona&quot; in the second verse of &quot;Gerusalemme Liberata&quot;.

==Religious sites==
The monastery of Hosios Loukas, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located on Mount Helicon.
