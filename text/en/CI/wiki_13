<text>United We Stand America was the name selected by Texas businessman H. Ross Perot for his citizen action organization after his 1992 independent political campaign for President of the United States. Perot&#x27;s 19% showing in the 1992 election was sufficient to entitle him to federal matching funds for the 1996 campaign. After the campaign, Perot announced, on January 11, 1993, the formation of a non-profit watchdog organization named United We Stand America (UWSA).

==History==
In the early 1990s, many people were talking about forming a new political party. These discussions centered around populist themes. The eventual result of the movement that followed was &quot;United We Stand America&quot;, followed by the Reform Party, and in some states the Independence Party. The early history of UWSA revolved around establishment of chapters in all 50 states and citizen activism against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The organization also supported Ross Perot&#x27;s fiscally conservative and socially liberal platform.

In November 1993, Perot and Vice-president Al Gore conducted a nationally televised debate about NAFTA on Larry King Live, which had been the highest rated CNN program until the Republican presidential debate in September 2015.

UWSA remained active under Perot&#x27;s leadership until late 1995 when the paid staff was moved to a new organization dubbed &quot;Citizens for the Reform Party&quot; which actively campaigned to petition the Reform Party on to the ballot in all 50 states for the 1996 presidential election. The name of Perot&#x27;s organization conflicted with that of a United Way-type LGBT advocacy group that had already copyrighted the name &#x27;United We Stand&#x27;.

==The Independent Movement and Founding of the Reform Party==

The movement to the political center ignited and began taking shape in one form or another all around the country in 1992. In Minnesota, the Independence Party was formed in 1992 by supporters of Ross Perot, and fielded Dean Barkley that year as a candidate for a seat in the US House of Representatives. Other supporters led by Don Dow, State Director, and Victoria Staten, Assistant State Director and Ross Perot&#x27;s spokesperson on NAFTA, worked as part of United We Stand America, and some eventually found their way to the Independence Party after the elections. In later years, the party began to field candidates in races of other states. In 1995 the Independence Party of Minnesota became affiliated with the national Reform Party and renamed itself the Reform Party of Minnesota. This is the same group that led the effort to elect Jesse Ventura, one of three independent governors in recent years. In 1995 Angus King was elected Governor of Maine. King&#x27;s election as an independent was not unprecedented in Maine politics; independent James B. Longley had been elected twenty years earlier. Though a member of the Republican Party during his time in Congress, Lowell Weicker left the Republican Party, and in 1991 he became one of the few independents to be elected as a state governor.

The Reform Party, founded in 1995 with ballot access in all 50 states, nominated Ross Perot for President after a convention battle between Perot and Richard Lamm, former governor of Colorado.
Perot&#x27;s running mate in 1996 was Pat Choate, a well-known author, economist and professor. The future of the Reform Party was somewhat clouded by the 1996 election results when the Perot/Choate ticket received only 9% of the overall vote. Since many states require a minimum of 10% to retain ballot access, the ability of the party to field candidates without the time and expense of petition drives was limited. However, based on the 1996 results, the party retained the ability to earn federal matching funds in the 2000 Presidential election - a fact that was not lost on Pat Buchanan. The battle for control of the Reform Party between many of the founding members and Buchanan&#x27;s weakened the Reform Party to the extent that it has diminished as a factor in U.S. politics in the years since the 2000 election.

United We Stand America no longer exists today. Archives of material from the original organization can be found at http://www.uwsa.com/books/Uwsabook.html , but the original group founded by Ross Perot ceased to be active after the independents organized, and with the formation of the Reform Party in 1995.

<text>Renato Carosone (; born Renato Carusone; 3 January 1920 – 20 May 2001) was an Italian musician.

He was a piano prodigy and prominent figure in the Italian music scene in the second half of the 20th century. He was also a modern performer of the so-called canzone napoletana, a traditional music genre from Naples. His biggest successes were: O sarracino/Caravan petrol&quot;, &quot;Tu vuò fà l&#x27;americano&quot;, &quot;Maruzzella&quot; and &quot;Pigliate &#x27;na pastiglia&quot;.

Carosone was one of the first post-war Italian artists (the other one being Domenico Modugno) who sold records and toured in the United States without singing in English.

==Biography==
===Beginnings===
Carosone was born on 3 January 1920 in Naples, in Vico dei Tornieri, near , to Antonio and Carolina Daino, the first of two other brothers, Olga and Ottavio. His father, who worked in the box office at Teatro Mercadante, encouraged him to pursue music. At 14, he wrote &quot;Triki-trak&quot;, his first composition for piano, and in 1935, he was hired by an &quot;opera dei pupi&quot; puppet theater to play music to the battles of Count Roland and Renaud. Subsequently, he worked at E. A. Mario&#x27;s publishing house teaching new songs to singers. He studied piano and composition at the Naples Conservatory under , and obtained his diploma in 1937, when he was just 17. 

A few months later he signed a contract with comedian Aldo Russo to perform as a band leader in Italian East Africa. The troup landed in Massawa, Eritrea, to work in a restaurant-theatre frequented by Italian workers. The act failed and after less than a week, Aldo Russo decided to dissolve the group and return to Naples. Carosone, however, decided to remain in East Africa, and he moved on to Asmara in the Eritrean highlands, playing piano in an orchestra at the Circolo Italia. There he met and fell in love with Venetian dancer Italia Levidi, known as Lita. The two married in Massawa on 2 January 1938. Carosone adopted her son Giuseppe, known as Pino, born to Lita five years before the wedding. Shortly thereafter, Carosone moved to Addis Ababa (now part of Ethiopia), where he spent a few months as conductor at the White Eagle. In June 1940, at the outbreak of World War II, he was called up and sent to the front in Italian Somaliland.

Following the surrender of the last regular Italian forces in the region in November 1941, Carasone returned to British-occupied Asmara, where his cousin Antonio was director of the Odeon Theatre. Carasone became the musical director of the theater and the adjoining nightclub. He was a prominent figure of the local music scene, performing a combination of big-band music, Neapolitan songs and Eritrean percussive elements.

Carosone worked at the Odeon Club in Asmara, where he become a prominent figure of the local music scene, building his musical experience with a combination of big-band music (including American dance pieces, such as &quot;Night and Day&quot;, &quot;Begin the Beguine&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot; and &quot;Tea for Two&quot;), Neapolitan songs and Eritrean percussive elements.

In July 1946, after the end of the war in Europe, he returned to Italy, to Brindisi, with his wife and son. Partially due to his long tenure abroad and inactivity caused by the war, Carosone was discovered to be virtually unknown in his home country. He started his career afresh, playing piano for small dance-hall bands. These new performances were strongly influenced by the new rhythms and music styles he had encountered during his ten years in East Africa and caught the attention of local promoters.

===Success===

In 1949 Carosone was asked to put together a band for a club&#x27;s opening night. After some auditions, he signed the Dutch guitarist Peter van Houten and the Neapolitan drummer Gegè Di Giacomo and formed the Trio Carosone. The trio would later become a quartet with the addition of the Hungarian romani musician Elek Bacsik on bass, guitar and violin.

During the 1950s Carosone became more and more popular, his orchestra was in great demand both in Italy and abroad, and record sales were soaring high.

His song &quot;Torero&quot;, entered the pop charts in the United States in the summer of 1958 where it peaked at #18, making it his only Top 20 hit song for his one-hit wonder in the United States. &quot;Torero&quot; was translated into twelve languages and covered by almost thirty artists in the United States alone, including versions by The Andrews Sisters, Connie Francis and The King Brothers. In 1957 Carosone and his band embarked on an American tour, kicking off in Cuba. This tour concluded with a triumphant performance at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in New York City.

Carosone was then signed by Capitol Records, which released his first two albums: &quot;Honeymoon in Rome&quot; (1957) and &quot;Renato Carosone!&quot; (1959). He then moved to Pathé and recorded &quot;Blue Italian Skies&quot; (1958). His fourth studio album, &quot;Carnevale Carosone&quot; (1960) was released by Parlophone.

===Retirement===
At the height of his career, Carosone announced his retirement from music in 1960. He felt that the advent of Rock and roll had the consequence of making his swing, big-band sound no longer popular: &quot;I&#x27;d rather retire now on the crest of the wave, than being tormented later by the idea of rock and roll wiping away all that I have achieved in so many years of hard work&quot;. His decision to retire caused an uproar. Some observers even suspected obscure underworld threats. Away from the spotlight, Carosone turned to other interests, mainly painting. In 2007 the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo Museum in Rome organized a large exhibition of his work.

===Comeback===
On 9 August 1975 Carosone made his comeback in a televised concert. He then resumed his musical career with live concerts, performances at the Sanremo Music Festival and TV appearances until the late 1990s.

==Repertoire==
The majority of Carosone&#x27;s songs were the result of his long and fruitful collaboration with the lyricist Nicola Salerno, who used the pseudonym Nisa. O suspiro&quot;, &quot;Torero&quot;, &quot;Tu vuò fà l&#x27;americano&quot;, &quot;Mambo italiano&quot;, &quot;Pigliate &#x27;na pastiglia&quot; and O sarracino/Caravan petrol&quot; were among their greatest hits.

A few famous songs not co-written by Nisa were &quot;...E la barca tornò sola&quot; (a parody of a song performed by Gino Latilla at Sanremo Music Festival in 1954); &quot;Tre numeri al lotto&quot;; &quot;Maruzzella&quot; (dedicated to his wife); and O russo e &#x27;a rossa&quot;

==Death==
Carosone died on 20 May 2001 at the age of 81 in Rome, Italy.

<doc id="1047310" wikidata="Q5188777" url="?curid=1047310" title="Crosspool">
<text>Crosspool is a suburb of the City of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England, located west of the city centre. The suburb falls within the Crookes ward of the City of Sheffield. It is a middle class residential area in an elevated position above the Porter and Rivelin valleys and stands at around above sea level. Crosspool is situated on the A57 road (Manchester Road) and is the last suburb on that road before the city boundary and open countryside is reached. In 2011 Crosspool had a population of 6,703.

==History==
The area of Crosspool is a fairly recent creation and, unlike some Sheffield suburbs, does not have any ancient history as a village stretching back over the centuries. W. Fairbank&#x27;s &quot;“Map of the Parish of Sheffield in the County of York”&quot; published in 1795 shows it as a thinly populated unnamed area sprinkled with a few buildings. From the early centuries AD the Long Causeway ancient track passed through the area; this originated in Roman times as a highway connecting the forts at Templeborough and Buxton and continued in later centuries as a packhorse route.

Throughout medieval times the area was part of a deer hunting park known as Hallamshire Chase. This was an area of thousands of acres set aside for the Lords of Hallamshire after the Norman conquest of England. Lydgate Hall was one of the earliest substantial buildings in the area as it existed in the early 1700s although it was substantially altered and extended in the early 19th century. It was the home of the steel magnate Horatio Bright (1827–1905) for the last 30 years of his life. The Hall was eventually demolished in the 1930s being replaced by housing on Lydgate Hall Crescent.

Although there was never a Crosspool village, the area was strategically placed as two roads left Sheffield through the area and there was a toll gate as well as inns and a blacksmiths to serve the traveller. The main industry in the 18th and 19th century was farming although there was also extensive quarrying. The presence of several natural pools gave the area its name in the 1800s as travellers on the turnpike roads were said to have “crossed the pools” when they had passed through the neighbourhood and the name of Crosspool developed. The A57 road was built in 1820, and tolls were phased out in 1884, but housing development in the area was delayed because of Crosspool&#x27;s elevated position, which developers thought would deter people from settling in the area.

Housing development eventually started in the 1880s but full-scale building did not take place until after the First World War. In 1913 Crosspool became the first area of Sheffield to receive a public transport service by bus as the Sheffield Tramway did not extend to the suburb. Crosspool suffered some bomb damage during the Second World War when bombs were dropped on Den Bank, Shore Lane, Sandygate Road and Ringstead Crescent.

==Demographics==

Crosspool is a suburb with vague boundaries; it merges with the adjacent neighbourhoods of Crookes, Fulwood and Ranmoor and has sub-districts within it such as Tapton Hill, Sandygate and Hallam Head. It has a total population of 7,070 residents in a 2006/7 NHS Neighbourhood Profile, just 1.3% of the population of the City of Sheffield. Other statistics bear out Crosspool&#x27;s status as a middle class area with almost 87% of residents being owner-occupiers of their houses compared to the Sheffield average of 60.2%. Almost 80% of Crosspool&#x27;s housing is either detached or semi-detached, again well above the average. 93.1% of Year 11 school pupils go on to further education compared to the Sheffield average of 86.8% while 38.5% of Crosspool&#x27;s adults have been educated to degree level in contrast to the Sheffield average of 18.8%.

==Buildings and landmarks==
Present day Crosspool is centred on the area around the junction of Manchester Road, Sandygate Road and Lydgate Lane ( ) where there is a selection of shops, food takeaways and a post office which since 2004 has been located inside a SPAR store. The Crosspool Tavern, a public house, is also in this area. Other public houses in Crosspool are “The Sportsman” at Stephen Hill and “The Plough” at Sandygate. Another pub, the &quot;Hallamshire Hotel&quot; on Lydgate Lane was demolished in the summer of 2011 and has been replaced by four houses, two apartments and a detached garage block. There are four schools in Crosspool for different age groups. Tapton School on Darwin Lane has over 1600 pupils between 11 and 18 years old and is a specialist college for science and the arts. The Lower School of King Edward VII School is also located on Darwin Lane and was known as Crosspool Secondary Modern School until 1969. Lydgate Junior School is situated on Manchester Road and has around 480 pupils between the ages of 7 and 11. While Lydgate Infant School on Lydgate Lane has just over 300 pupils, it is housed in a Grade II listed building dating from 1896, built by William John Hale.

Tapton Hall, a Grade II listed building is situated on Shore Lane, it was built in 1855 and has been the home of the industrialist Edward Vickers and the snuff mill owner George Wilson; today it is a conference and banqueting centre which is licensed to conduct weddings. Another Grade II listed structure is The Towers, a Scottish Baronial fantasy on Sandygate Road.

The main churches in Crosspool are the Church of St. Columba and Stephen Hill Methodist Church, both of which are located on Manchester Road near the centre of the suburb. Because of the pressure from housing developers present day Crosspool has been left with very few open spaces for recreation with the small park/play area on the north side of Lydgate Lane being created on re-claimed land when an extensive quarry was filled in the first half of the 20th century. A prominent landmark, also on Lydgate Lane, is the Crosspool transmitter, officially known as the Tapton Hill transmitting station, which stands on the site of a covered reservoir and is well seen from many parts of Sheffield. The 57-metre-high mast takes advantage of Crosspool&#x27;s elevated position to provide TV pictures and radio signals for Sheffield by the “line of sight” method. The privately run Claremont Hospital is situated at 401 Sandygate Road.

==Sport==
Hallam F.C., the second oldest football club in the world has its home ground in Crosspool at Sandygate Road, which is the oldest football ground in the world. Crosspool hosts the start and finish of the Hallam Chase, a 3.25 miles (5.25 km) race starting at Hallam cricket ground, going on a very hilly route to Stannington church and then returning to the ground. The route has almost 250 metres of ascending and is run every year on Whit Tuesday. The race, which is organised by the local athletics club, the Hallamshire Harriers, started in 1863. Sebastian Coe, the Olympic Games gold medal winning middle distance runner, was brought up in Crosspool, attending Tapton School and being a member of Hallamshire Harriers.

==Community==
The community has a vibrant local community, which co-ordinates itself through a community forum established in 2003. Reports of open meeting minutes, together with items of local interest, letters and adverts are published in the quarterly &#x27;Crosspool Clarion&#x27; magazine, delivered to over 2,500 local households, and also on the crosspool.info website. Many events and village activities are held in Crosspool. Every year since 2003 a summer fayre has been held in July, along with car boot sales in June and September. A Festival was first organised in 2010, going on to become an annual event.

<text>Elizabeth Proctor (née Bassett; 1650 – after 1703) was convicted of witchcraft in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. She was the wife of John Proctor, who was convicted and executed.

Her execution sentence was postponed because she was pregnant. In 1693 the new governor, Sir William Phips, freed 153 prisoners, including Elizabeth. The widow Proctor remarried in 1699, to Daniel Richards. In 1703 she and her late husband John Proctor were granted a reversal of attainder by the Massachusetts legislature.

==Early life==
Elizabeth was born in 1650 in Lynn, Massachusetts, and was the daughter of Capt. William Bassett Sr. and Sarah Burt. As an adult she weighed 155 pounds. She married John Proctor on April 1, 1674 in Salem, Massachusetts.

Elizabeth&#x27;s grandmother was Ann (Holland) Bassett Burt, a Quaker and a midwife. The Puritans felt there was something &quot;witchlike&quot; about Quakers. Since Ann was not a doctor, but was successful at caring for those who were ill, some felt she could only have these skills if she were a witch. She was charged with witchcraft in 1669. One of those who testified against Ann was Phillip Read, a doctor. These accusations left a taint in the memories of residents and may have contributed to Elizabeth&#x27;s persecution nearly 30 years later.

==Salem witch trials==
===Accusations of witchcraft===

In early March 1692, the Proctors&#x27; servant, Mary Warren, began to have fits, saying she saw the spectre (ghost) of Giles Corey. John Proctor was dismissive of her claims (as he was of all the accusations) and made her work harder; he felt that witchcraft should be suspected of the bewitched girls themselves and not of the respectable women of the village. His negative reactions to the girls&#x27; accusations may have caused Elizabeth to become one of the next to be accused of practicing witchcraft.

On March 26, 1692, Mercy Lewis made the first accusations that Elizabeth&#x27;s spectre was tormenting her. William Rayment, of nearby Beverly, Massachusetts, mentioned he had heard a rumor that Elizabeth Proctor would be questioned in court the next day. Appearing to go into a trance, one of the girls cried, &quot;There&#x27;s Goody Proctor! Old Witch! I&#x27;ll have her hung.&quot; When onlookers expressed doubt, claiming that the Proctor family was well regarded in the community, the girl promptly came out of her trance and told them it was all for &quot;sport&quot;.

On March 29, 1692, Abigail Williams and Mercy Lewis again said they were being tormented by Elizabeth&#x27;s spectre. A few days later, Abigail complained that Elizabeth was pinching her and tearing at her bowels, and said she saw Elizabeth&#x27;s spectre as well as John&#x27;s. In April 1692, 31 men from Ipswich, Massachusetts, filed a petition attesting to the upstanding character of John and Elizabeth and denying that they had ever seen anything that would indicate either of the couple were witches.

In May 1692, a similar petition was filed on behalf of John and Elizabeth, containing signatures of 20 men and women, including several of the wealthiest landowners of Topsfield, Massachusetts and Salem Village. The petition questioned the validity of spectral evidence, testified to the Christian lives that John and Elizabeth had led, said that they &quot;were ever ready to help such as stood in need of their help&quot;, and that the petitioners had no reason to believe the couple were witches.

On June 2, 1692, a male doctor and several women completed a physical examination of Elizabeth and several of the other accused. They looked for birth defects, moles or other markings, which were widely believed at the time to be a sign that the person was a witch; the examiners found no such marks.

On August 2, 1692, the court met in Salem to discuss the fate of John, Elizabeth and several others. At some point during this time, John wrote his will, but he did not include Elizabeth. Some believe this is because he assumed she would be executed along with him. In spite of the petitions and testimonies from friends, both John and Elizabeth were found guilty, and were sentenced to death on August 5, 1692. Elizabeth, who was pregnant at the time, was granted a stay of execution until after the birth of the baby. John tried to postpone his execution, but failed. On August 19, 1692, John was executed. Elizabeth remained in jail. Action was eventually taken on the petition that John had filed to save his life and that of Elizabeth, but it was too late for him.

===Release===
In January 1693, several hundred people were still in prison awaiting trial. On January 27, while imprisoned, Elizabeth gave birth to a son, whom she named John Proctor III after her husband. Elizabeth was not executed as the court had ordered for unknown reasons.

In May 1693, the girls began to accuse Lady Mary Phips, wife of the Governor of Massachusetts Sir William Phips. The Governor then ordered the remaining 153 prisoners to be set free. Elizabeth was among this general release of prisoners. Before she was released, her family was required to pay her prison fees. At this time, families were required to pay for their family members&#x27; room and board while in jail, as well as the cost of their executions.

===Accusations against other Proctor family members===
In 1692, 141 complaints were filed. Of those, 12 were against relatives or extended members of the Proctor family. John Proctor, Elizabeth Proctor, and Rebecca Nurse were convicted, and John and Rebecca were executed.

#John Proctor, husband of Elizabeth Bassett aka Elizabeth Proctor and the father of Benjamin, William, and Sarah Proctor.
#Elizabeth Bassett Proctor, third wife of John Proctor.
#Benjamin Proctor, son of John Proctor and his first wife Martha Giddens.
#William Proctor, son of John Proctor and his third wife, Elizabeth Bassett Proctor.
#Mary Bassett DeRich was the sister of Elizabeth Bassett Proctor.

====Extended family====
#Thomas Farrar Sr., father-in-law of Elizabeth (Hood) Farrar, sister of Sarah Hood aka Sarah Bassett
#Elizabeth Hutchinson, wife of Isaac Hart whose sister, Deborah Hart, was married to Benjamin Proctor, brother of John Proctor.
#Elizabeth Proctor, daughter of John Proctor and Elizabeth Thorndike Proctor, married Thomas Very in 1681. His sister, Elizabeth Very was the second wife of John Nurse, the eldest son of Francis and Rebecca (née Towne) Nurse.
#Rebecca Nurse, sister of Mary Eastey and Sarah Cloyce.
#Mary Eastey, sister of Rebecca Nurse and Sarah Cloyce.
#Sarah Cloyce, sister of Rebecca Nurse and Mary Eastey.
#Esther Elwell (née Dutch), aka Hester Elwell — wed to Samuel Elwell, brother of Thomas Elwell; sister-in-law to Sarah Bassett Elwell, another of Elizabeth Bassett Proctor&#x27;s sisters.

====Family tree====



===Related accuser===
One other family member was drawn into the Trials, joining the accusers: 16-year-old John DeRich, son of the imprisoned Bassett, and her husband, Michel DeRich, who had recently died.

===Trial aftermath===
Though Elizabeth was free, the ordeal was not over for her. As she had been convicted, in the eyes of the law she was a dead person, separated from society. Although the law stated that possessions would be seized when someone was convicted, the Proctors&#x27; possessions were confiscated long before their trials. Elizabeth could not claim any of John&#x27;s property. She could not regain her dowry, because legally, she no longer existed. Elizabeth petitioned the General Court for reversal of attainder to restore her legal rights. No action was taken by the government for seven years, although it was already widely accepted that innocent people had been wrongly convicted.

On April 19, 1697, the probate court ordered Elizabeth&#x27;s step-children to return to her the dowry as she was &quot;now restored to benefit of law&quot;.
In June 1696 Elizabeth filed an appeal to contest her husband&#x27;s will. She testified in court that in that &quot;sad time of darkness before my said husband was executed it is evident somebody had contrived a will and brought it to him to sign, wherein his whole estate is disposed of&quot;. The will had already been granted probate and assets distributed and she stated that her step-children &quot;will not suffer me to have one penny of the estate, neither upon the account of my husband&#x27;s contract with me before marriage nor yet upon the account of the dower which, as I humbly conceive, doth belong or ought to belong to me by law, for they say that I am dead in the law&quot;.

The public demanded that the courts apologize, and a written apology was issued on March 18, 1702. In July 1703, an address was made to the General Court requesting the petitions from the families be granted. Finally, action was taken to obtain the reversal of attainder for Elizabeth. The Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a bill that year formally disallowing spectral evidence, but reversing attainder only for those who had filed petitions, which applied only to John and Elizabeth Proctor, and Rebecca Nurse.

On March 2, 1703, 21 spouses and children of those condemned, as well as three women who were convicted but not executed, including Elizabeth, filed petitions before any action was taken on Elizabeth&#x27;s appeal for reversal of attainder. They requested that &quot;something may be publicly done to take off infamy from the names&quot;. Two more petitions were filed in June 1703. These included requests from eleven ministers to reconsider the convictions and restore the good names of the citizens. The Massachusetts House of Representatives finally passed a bill disallowing spectral evidence. However, they only gave reversal of attainder for those who had filed petitions.

In 1705 another petition was filed requesting a more equitable settlement for those wrongly accused. In May 1709, 22 people who had been convicted of witchcraft, or whose parents had been convicted of witchcraft, presented the General Court with a petition to take action on the 1705 proposal demanding both a reversal of attainder and compensation for financial losses. In May 1710 the legislature appointed a committee to hear the petitions. After many delays, on 17 October 1711 the General Court passed a bill reversing the judgment against the people listed in the 1709 petition and Governor Joseph Dudley signed the bill into law. There were still an additional seven people who had been convicted, but had not signed the petition. There was no reversal of attainder for them. The bill read as follows:

The 22 people in the 1709 petition were awarded the sum of £578-12-0 to be divided among the survivors and relatives of those accused. However, reversal of attainder and monies were only awarded to the accused and their heirs who had asked for it. £150 were awarded to &quot;John Proctor and wife&quot;, but Elizabeth&#x27;s name was not specifically mentioned. Thorndike Proctor received money for his family&#x27;s suffering. His older brother Benjamin objected as he had been the one responsible for taking care of his siblings during this time. The court took no action, leaving it up to the family to determine how to divide the funds. Most of the accounts were settled within a year. The award to the Proctor family was $1500, much more money from the Massachusetts General Court than most families of accused witches, a possible indicator of the wealth of the families involved.

Thorndike Proctor purchased the Groton Farm from the Downing family of London, England, following the hanging of his father. The farm was renamed Downing Farm. Thorndike subsequently sold nearly half of Downing Farm to his half-brother Benjamin. Eight generations of Proctors resided on the Downing farm, until 1851. 

By 1957, not all the condemned had been exonerated. Descendants of those falsely accused demanded the General Court clear the names of their family members. In 1957 an act was passed pronouncing the innocence of those accused; however, it only listed Ann Pudeator by name and the others as &quot;certain other persons&quot;, still failing to include all names of those convicted. They also included a resolution prohibiting further lawsuits based on old court proceedings.

In 1992, the Danvers Tercentennial Committee persuaded the Massachusetts House of Representatives to issue a resolution honoring &quot;the courage and steadfastness of these condemned persons who adhered to truth when the legal, clerical, and political institutions failed them&quot;. While the document did list the names of all those not previously granted reversal of attainder, it only noted that these individuals were &quot;worthy of remembrance and commemoration&quot;.

After efforts by, among others, Representatives J. Michael Ruane and Paul Tirone, and Salem schoolteacher, Paula Keene, when it was finally signed on October 31, 2001, by Governor Jane Swift, more than 300 years later, all were finally proclaimed innocent.

==&quot;The Crucible&quot;==
In the 1953 play &quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller, Abigail Williams, mistress to John Proctor, secretly pierces her abdomen deeply with a needle, then pretends that it is the doing of a witch. She falsely accuses Proctor&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Proctor, of having pierced the abdomen of a witch&#x27;s &quot;poppet&quot; doll with a needle in order to torment her, and accuses her of witchcraft. After this event, many in the community find other reasons to suspect Elizabeth Proctor.

<text>Mosler Automotive was an American sports car manufacturer headquartered in Riviera Beach, Florida. It was founded in 1985 by Warren Mosler as Consulier Industries, and manufactured the Consulier GTP, which was later rebranded and updated as the Mosler Intruder/Raptor when the company spun off its automotive division as Mosler Automotive.

The company produced the MT900R racer and the street-legal MT900S, as well as several unique project vehicles, until its demise in June 2013 when all assets were acquired by Rossion Automotive. Additional manufacturing facilities were based in St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England. Filmmaker George Lucas was the first to take delivery of the MT900S.

== History ==

===Consulier Industries===
In 1985, Warren Mosler started a company called Consulier Industries and introduced the Consulier GTP, a 2200 lb. mid-engined car powered by a mid-mounted turbocharged Chrysler 2.2 L engine producing 190 hp. The chassis was a fiberglass-and-foam monocoque.

=== Mosler automotive spin off ===
In 1993, Consulier Industries spun off its automotive division as Mosler Automotive. The newly named Mosler Automotive introduced the Intruder, a rebodied Consulier with a new 300 hp GM LT1 engine. This car raced at the 24 hours of Nelson Ledges for two consecutive years, winning both years – unfortunately, the Intruder was also banned after its dominating 1993-4 performances. In 1996, an Intruder modified by Lingenfelter Performance Engineering to yield 450 hp won &quot;Car and Driver&quot;″s One Lap of America. It too was banned after three victories.

In 1997 the Intruder was given a V-shaped windshield that reduced drag, and renamed the Raptor, once again winning the 1997 One Lap of America. It also went on to win the 1999 One Lap. The Raptor entered in the 1997 One Lap weighed 2773 lb (1,258 kg) and had 443 hp (330 kW) from a Lingenfelter modified 6.3 L V8 engine.

In 2001, an all-new Mosler debuted – the Mosler MT900. This carbon-fiber chassis, rear wheel drive sports car was designed by using Siemens advanced design software, and used a 350 hp (261 kW), mid-mounted GM LS1 engine. An early prototype MT900S, despite being 390 pounds (177 kg) heavier and having 65 hp (49 kW) less power than the production version could achieve a 0-60 mph time of 3.5 seconds, and a quarter-mile time of 12 seconds flat. Since then, the MT900 has undergone several revisions to become the 2005 MT900S, which has 435 hp (324 kW) from its Corvette Z06-derived LS-6 V8, powering a 2,500 lb (1136 kg) car (without fuel). A Photon variant was available which added a Hewland transmission, thinwall subframes, BBS magnesium wheels, titanium springs, and carbon fiber seats and bodywork, reducing the car&#x27;s mass to 1,980 lb (900 kg). &quot;Motor Trend&quot; with its guest hot shoe, Le Mans winner Justin Bell, behind the wheel reported a 0-60 time of 3.1 seconds, a standing quarter-mile time of 11.72 seconds and a standing mile time of 30.4 seconds. In addition to breaking acceleration records, &quot;Motor Trend&quot; also reported 60-0 braking in 100 feet, braking from 100-0 in 275 feet and the ultimate test, 0-100-0 in 10.98 seconds, breaking the 11.15 second record previously held by the McLaren F1 LM. It was discovered after the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; test that the Mosler MT900 test car had a faulty O2 sensor and was very down on power.

Introduced concurrently was the MT900R, a race prepared version of the MT900. In 2003, the MT900R won the GTS Division of the Rolex 24 Hours at Daytona. In Europe, the MT900R has successfully raced and won in the British GT Championship, FIA GT Tourist Trophy races, International Open GT Championship, Britcar Championship, Spanish GT Championship as well as selected races in other series. In 2008, The Mosler Dutch Supercar Challenge, an MT900R only race series ran its inaugural event at the famed Nürburgring F1 track.

Mosler also produced several one-off project vehicles, including a six-wheel custom Jeep that uses many GM components (dubbed the J-10 Sport) and the TwinStar, a Cadillac Eldorado boasting twin Northstar V-8s.

<doc id="1047327" wikidata="Q4893051" url="?curid=1047327" title="Bernard Darnton">
<text>Bernard Darnton (born 18 December 1972 in Leicester, United Kingdom) is a former leader of Libertarianz, a libertarian political party in New Zealand.

==Involvement in the Libertarianz party==
In the party&#x27;s list for the 1999 election, Darnton had been ranked fourth. In the party list announced for the 2002 election, however, Darnton was ranked twentieth, although the list itself was not submitted by the appropriate deadline. Darnton became leader in mid-2004, replacing Russell Watkins, and remained in the position until the 2008 election. In 2004, Darnton unsuccessfully stood for election in the Wellington Regional Council&#x27;s Wellington constituency. For the 2005 and 2008 General Elections, Darnton headed the Libertarianz party list and was the electorate candidate for .

===Darnton v Clark===
On 29 June 2006, Bernard Darnton filed proceedings in the High Court, suing Helen Clark for allegedly misappropriating public funds to pay for the Labour Party&#x27;s pledge cards during the 2005 election. Some commentators labelled the lawsuit a stunt, although it received some media coverage as concern about the &quot;pledge card&quot; funding grew.

On Sunday 10 September 2006, the lawsuit was the subject of a front-page story in &quot;The Sunday Star-Times&quot; newspaper. The Labour party promptly accused the Libertarianz party of being part of a conspiracy with the National party, alleging that the small party could not afford to bring such a case to court.

In October 2006, after the Auditor-General released a report declaring that the misappropriation of funds was illegal, Labour and other political parties immediately announced that they would pay back the money. On 17 and 18 October, a majority, including the Labour Party, passed a law through Parliament to &#x27;retrospectively validate&#x27; the spending, making it legal, which is required under the Public Finance Act 1989. In the circumstances, however, it also effectively makes the misspending immune from court proceedings.

In response, the Libertarianz party declared 18 October 2006 to be &quot;Banana Republic Day&quot;, and issued press releases.

<doc id="1047328" wikidata="Q6142958" url="?curid=1047328" title="USS Bluegill">
<text>USS &quot;Bluegill&quot; (SS-242/SSK-242) was a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine in commission in the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946, from 1951 to 1952, and from 1953 to 1969. She was named for the bluegill, a sunfish of the Mississippi Valley.

During World War II, &quot;Bluegill&quot; completed six war patrols between 1 April 1944 and 21 June 1945, operating in an area extending from New Guinea to Formosa and in the South China Sea and Java Sea. She sank ten Japanese vessels, totaling 46,212 tons, including the light cruiser and a submarine chaser. She was placed in reserve in 1946.

Recommissioned in 1951, &quot;Bluegill&quot; operated as a training submarine until 1952. She then underwent conversion into a &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot; specialized for antisubmarine warfare, and was recommissioned as such in 1953. After service in the Vietnam War, she was decommissioned in 1969 and sunk in 1971 for use as a salvage trainer. She was refloated and scuttled in 1983.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bluegill&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 17 December 1942. She was launched on 8 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. W. Sterling Cole, wife of Congressman W. Sterling Cole of New York, and commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton on 11 November 1943 with Lieutenant Commander Eric L. Barr Jr., in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====November 1943–March 1944====
After shakedown training, &quot;Bluegill&quot; transited the Panama Canal. She departed Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone on 22 February 1944 and set course for the South West Pacific Area. She arrived at Milne Bay on the eastern tip of New Guinea on 22 March 1944.

====First war patrol====
On 1 April 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; put to sea from Milne Bay on her first war patrol. She conducted it in the area between northern Halmahera in the Maluku Islands and Sonsorol Island in the Palau Islands. She made her first enemy contact, three Japanese merchant ships, on 10 April 1944 but failed to gain a favorable attack position. On 27 April 1944, with the help of signals intelligence, &quot;Bluegill&quot; sighted an Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer lying to off Sonsorol Island. While she approached the destroyer, the Japanese 3,500-displacement ton light cruiser crossed her path. She launched six torpedoes at &quot;Yubari&quot;, two of which struck home and sent &quot;Yubari&quot; to the bottom. The Japanese destroyer then charged in to counterattack. &quot;Bluegill&quot; responded with four torpedoes from her stern torpedo tubes. All four missed &quot;Samidare&quot;, and &quot;Bluegill&quot; went deep to escape.

On 28 April 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; encountered another Japanese destroyer escorting a large landing barge. After gaining a favorable position on the target, she fired a spread of four torpedoes. None hit, the torpedoes apparently running under the target. Again, &quot;Bluegill&quot; dived and escaped.

On the afternoon of 1 May 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; contacted a Japanese convoy of three merchant ships and two escorts west of the Palau Islands. She set up an ambush ahead of the convoy and, as the Japanese ships passed, fired a spread of four torpedoes, two of which crashed into the side of the 8,812-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Asosan Maru&quot;. The escorts counterattacked, but &quot;Bluegill&quot; escaped. That evening, she surfaced and spied &quot;Asosan Maru&quot; still afloat and burning furiously. On 2 May 1944, she used her deck gun to finish off &quot;Asosan Maru&quot;.

On 10 May 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; put into Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands to bring aboard additional torpedoes from the submarine . The two submarines departed Manus on 11 May, and &quot;Bluegill&quot; returned to her patrol area near Halmahera and Morotai in the Maluku Islands. On the morning of 19 May, she allowed a Japanese destroyer to pass unmolested in the hope that larger targets might follow, but none materialized.

On 20 May 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; sighted a single Japanese merchant ship rounding a point on Halmahera in company with two escorts. Gaining a favorable firing position to shoreward, she loosed a four-torpedo spread from her stern tubes. Three of the four torpedoes shattered the 1,856-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Miyaura Maru&quot;. On 22 May, &quot;Bluegill&quot; encountered a Japanese convoy that had already been attacked by the submarine , but two Japanese submarine chasers detected her and dropped a depth-charge barrage close aboard, preventing her from making an attack. While she continued to maneuver for a favorable attack position on the convoy later that day, a Japanese plane forced her to crash-dive and dropped depth charges. Thanks to the crash dive, &quot;Bluegill&quot; lost contact with the convoy. She left her patrol area on 28 May 1944, stopped at Manus on 1 June, and concluded her patrol with her arrival at Brisbane, Australia, on 7 June 1944.

====Second war patrol====

&quot;Bluegill&quot; embarked upon her second war patrol at the end of June 1944, stopped at Manus on 5 and 6 July, and then got underway for Davao Gulf off Mindanao in the Philippine Islands. On 20 July 1944, she made an unsuccessful attack on a Japanese &quot;Nagara&quot;-class light cruiser from an extreme range. On 22 July, she sighted a ship of about 1,000 tons, but her spread of four torpedoes ran harmlessly beneath the ship, which responded with 11 depth charges. Off the entrance to Sarangani Bay on 1 August 1944, she encountered a Japanese cargo ship with three escorts. She attained a good firing position, but the escorts detected her and the cargo ship began radical evasive maneuvers. With depth charges coming down around her, &quot;Bluegill&quot; abandoned her attack and escaped.

While off Maculi Point on Mindanao on 7 August 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; spotted a Japanese cargo ship accompanied by two escorts, a decoy vessel, and three aircraft overhead. She set up on the cargo ship, and two of the four torpedoes that she fired struck home. She was forced deep by a barrage of 36 depth charges. She later learned that her target, the 4,642-gross register ton &quot;Sanju Maru&quot;, had gone to the bottom.

On 13 August 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; caught sight of a Japanese cargo ship escorted by two torpedo boats, two submarine chasers, and a decoy vessel. She launched a spread of four torpedoes that found two targets, the 300-displacement ton &quot;Submarine Chaser No. 12&quot; and the 1,931-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Kojun Maru&quot;. At that point, she headed for Australia and, after a stop at Darwin in the Northern Territory, she concluded her patrol with her arrival at Fremantle, Western Australia, on 24 August 1944.

====Third war patrol====

&quot;Bluegill&quot; departed Fremantle on 18 September 1944 to begin her third war patrol, which took her to the Sulu Sea, the Sibuyan Sea, and the South China Sea. On 6 October 1944, she encountered an interisland steamer off Bondoc Point on southern Luzon in the Philippine Islands and riddled it with gunfire. The steamer remained stubbornly afloat at the approach of darkness, so &quot;Bluegill&quot; was forced to expend a torpedo to sink it.

On 12 October 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; surfaced in the midst of three small Japanese cargo ships of a type known to the Americans as &quot;sea trucks&quot; off Tumao Point on northwestern Mindanao. She opened gunfire on them and soon scored hits on two of the three. However, the sea trucks were armed with heavy machine guns, and when &quot;Bluegill&quot;′s after 20-millimeter gun jammed, one of the sea trucks took advantage of the opportunity to spray the submarine with machine-gun fire, wounding several of &quot;Bluegill&quot;′s sailors and prompting &quot;Bluegill&quot; to break off the action and submerge.

Before dawn on 18 October 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; contacted a Japanese 14-ship convoy while on the surface off Manila on Luzon but could not reach a favorable firing position. After transmitting a contact report, she submerged in the hope of making a daylight attack. The convoy turned away from her, but then made another turn toward &quot;Bluegill&quot;. In the ensuing combat, &quot;Bluegill&quot; claimed to have sunk five ships, but a postwar survey of Japanese records credited her with only three: the 9,400-gross register ton transport &quot;Arabia Maru&quot;, the 1,999-gross register ton cargo ship &quot;Chinzei Maru&quot;, and the 8,000-gross register ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Hakushika Maru&quot;. From time to time throughout the action, &quot;Bluegill&quot; had to dive to evade depth charges before resuming her attack.

On 20 October 1944, &quot;Bluegill&quot; expended her remaining torpedoes in an unsuccessful attack on two Japanese tankers escorted by a submarine chaser. On the 21 October, she headed for Mios Woendi in the Schouten Islands off the northwestern coast of New Guinea. She arrived there on 27 October, took aboard torpedoes and fuel, and then returned to sea to resume her patrol in the Sulu Sea. After 20 fruitless days, she departed station to return to her base. Off the coast of Borneo in the Japanese-occupied Netherlands East Indies on 17 November 1944, she encountered a small Japanese transport escorted by three small destroyers. The Japanese detected her, and she dived deeply and began to clear the area. Before escaping, she suffered a pounding from 27 depth charges. Her patrol ended on 25 November 1944 with her arrival at Fremantle, where she began repairs to the damage she suffered in the 17 November depth-charging.

====Fourth war patrol====

Repair of her battle damage kept &quot;Bluegill&quot; in port until she stood out of Fremantle on 19 December 1944 for her fourth war patrol. On the night of 25 December, she attempted a fast surface transit of Lombok Strait between the islands of Bali and Lombok just east of Java, but a Japanese shore battery detected her and opened accurate fire on her, forcing her to make a hasty retreat. She soon joined a coordinated attack group, or &quot;wolfpack,&quot; which also included the submarines and .

During January 1945, &quot;Bluegill&quot; conducted a reconnaissance in support of the American liberation of the campaign in the Philippine Islands. The only other event of note during the patrol occurred on 2 February 1945, when she took aboard two Japanese prisoners-of-war that another American submarine had captured for passage back to Fremantle, which she reached on 7 February 1945.

====Fifth war patrol====

&quot;Bluegill&quot; began her fifth war patrol on 12 March 1945 and transited Lombok Strait on the night of 18–19 March 1945. Early on 19 March, she made an unsuccessful submerged torpedo attack on an auxiliary sailing vessel and the &quot;sea truck&quot; it was preparing to take in tow. Following fruitless searches along the coast of Borneo, &quot;Bluegill&quot; arrived off Japanese-occupied French Indochina on 27 March 1945. She submerged off Hon Doi to join the submarines and in a picket line along the coast.

At around 10:20 on 28 March 1945, &quot;Bluegill&quot; heard a combination of sonar pings and depth-charge explosions to the south as &quot;Blackfin&quot; attacked the Japanese convoy HI-88J as it moved up the coast of French Indochina. &quot;Bluegill&quot; began to edge quietly toward the fracas as the three submarines, in concert with United States Army Air Forces planes, began an onslaught against the convoy. Just before 11:00, &quot;Bluegill&quot; made contact with the 5,542-gross register ton tanker &quot;Honan Maru&quot; (formerly the British Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker &quot;&quot;War Sirdar&quot;&quot;) escorted by four coast defense vessels and a destroyer. A little before 11:15, she fired three torpedoes at &quot;Honan Maru&quot;. Two of them struck home, but &quot;Honan Maru&quot; managed to ground herself on the nearby shore to avoid sinking and permit salvage. Meanwhile, &quot;Bluegill&quot; contended with a savage depth charge attack from the escorts. On 29 March, she fired two more torpedoes at the stranded &quot;Honan Maru&quot;.

On 5 and 6 April 1945, &quot;Bluegill&quot; attempted a commando raid to blow up bridges and trains in French Indochina. The Japanese detected the Australian commandos, and the attempt ended in failure. Meanwhile, &quot;Bluegill&quot; returned to &quot;Honan Maru&quot; on 5 April and sent ashore a landing party that ascertained &quot;Honan Maru&quot;′s identity and completed her destruction with demolition charges and incendiaries. She concluded her patrol at Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippine Islands on 18 April 1945.

====Sixth war patrol====

&quot;Bluegill&quot; put to sea from Subic Bay on her sixth war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the South China Sea to the southwest of Formosa. She sighted no enemy shipping during her patrol. On 28 May 1945, she conducted a reconnaissance and bombardment of Pratas Island. She sent a landing party of 12 men ashore, and they found the island to be uninhabited, discovering that the Japanese naval garrison had recently been evacuated. In a ceremony on 29 May 1945, &quot;Bluegill&quot;′s crew raised the United States flag on the island and proclaimed it to be &quot;Bluegill Island.&quot; They then destroyed a Japanese ammunition and fuel dump on the island. The otherwise uneventful patrol ended at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 21 June 1945.

====End of war====
Later in June 1945, &quot;Bluegill&quot; headed for San Francisco, California, where she arrived on 2 July 1945 and soon began an overhaul at the Bethlehem Steel Company shipyard. While she was undergoing overhaul, World War II ended with the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August 1945 (14 August on the other side of the International Date Line in San Francisco).

===Post-World War II===

====1945–1946====
Upon completion of her overhaul, &quot;Buegill&quot; served in the United States Pacific Fleet until 1 March 1946, when she was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Mare Island Naval Shipyard on Mare Island in Vallejo, California.

====1951–1953====
&quot;Bluegill&quot; remained in reserve at Mare Island until the spring of 1951. As part of the fleet build-up that occurred following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, she was recommissioned on 3 May 1951 and reported to the U.S. Pacific Fleet for service as a training submarine, based at San Diego, California. On 7 July 1952, she was decommissioned at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, placed in reserve, and redesignated a &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot; — U.S. Navy terminology at the time for a specialized antisubmarine warfare submarine — with the hull classification symbol SSK-242. After conversion at Hunters Point for her new role, she was recommissioned at San Francisco on 2 May 1953.

====1953–1969====
&quot;Bluegill&quot; resumed duty based at San Diego until 2 November 1953, when she deployed to the western Pacific. During her deployment, she trained with units of the United States Seventh Fleet, saw service off the Korean Peninsula, and visited various Far Eastern ports before returning to San Diego on 15 May 1954. There, she resumed operations along the United States West Coast and continued such duty until Decebmber 1955.

In December 1955, &quot;Bluegill&quot; moved to a new home port at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. For almost nine years, she alternated between operations in the Hawaiian Islands with deployments to the western Pacific. On 15 August 1959, she was redesignated an attack submarine with the hull classification symbol SS-242.

While &quot;Bluegill&quot; was undergoing overhaul at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 1 April 1964, while in overhaul, her home port changed to San Diego. For the remainder of her career, she divided her time between training duties along the U.S. West Coast and periodic cruises to the Far East. During the Vietnam War, she spent time in the Gulf of Tonkin off North Vietnam in 1965, conducting reconnaissance operations and rescuing downed American pilots. She received her last designation change on 1 April 1966, when she became an auxiliary submarine with the hull classification symbol AGSS-242.

==Disposal==
&quot;Bluegill&quot; was decommissioned at San Diego on 28 June 1969, and her name was struck from the Navy Vessel Register the same day. In 1970, she was towed to Pearl Harbor. On 3 December 1970, she was scuttled and moored to the sea bed as a salvage trainer about off Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii, in of water. Her hull was used thereafter for underwater rescue training until 1983.

On 5 November 1983, after a month of preparatory work, the &quot;Edenton&quot;-class salvage and rescue ships and raised &quot;Bluegill&quot; and towed her to deep water, where she was scuttled with military honors on 6 November 1983 as a means of disposal.

<text>The Nudelman N-37 was a 37 mm (1.46 in) aircraft autocannon used by the Soviet Union. It was designed during World War II by V. Ya. Nemenov of A.E. Nudelman&#x27;s OKB-16 to replace the earlier Nudelman-Suranov NS-37 and entered service in 1946. It was 30% lighter than its predecessor at the cost of a 23% lower muzzle velocity.

The N-37 was a sizable weapon firing a massive (735 g/26 oz HEI-T, 760 g/27 oz AP-T) shell. Its muzzle velocity was still considerable, but its rate of fire was only 400 rounds per minute. The weapon&#x27;s considerable recoil and waste gases were problematic for turbojet fighter aircraft, as was finding space for the gun and a useful amount of ammunition, but a single shell was often sufficient to destroy a bomber.

The N-37 was used in the MiG-9, MiG-15, MiG-17, and early MiG-19 fighters, the Yakovlev Yak-25, and others. Production lasted through the late 1950s, although it remained in service for many years afterwards.

==Variants==

;N-37
:Basic version without muzzle brake

;N-37D
:N-37 with muzzle brake

;N-37L
:N-37 with 1950mm long barrel (had no muzzle brake)

;NN-37
:Improved N-37L developed during the late 1950s for the Yak-27 reconnaissance aircraft. The NN-37 differed from the N-37L in having a pneumatic counter-recoil accelerator, therefore achieving a rate of fire of 600–700rpm. The ammunition feed mechanism was redesigned as well on this version.

<doc id="1047341" wikidata="Q1544403" url="?curid=1047341" title="Virgin Steele">
<text>Virgin Steele is an American heavy metal band from New York, originally formed in 1981.

The band released a few career highlights albums (&quot;Noble Savage&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II&quot; and &quot;Invictus&quot;). In recent years, they have enriched their sound with elements of musical theatre, progressive and symphonic metal, developing and writing projects such as the metal opera &quot;The House of Atreus&quot; (based on &quot;Oresteia&quot; and the Greek myth related to the Atreides) in 1999/2000 and the soundtrack for an imaginary movie &quot;Visions of Eden (A Barbaric Romantic Movie of the Mind)&quot; or &quot;The Lilith Project&quot; (based on the Sumerian legend of Lilith) in 2006.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
At the beginning of the 1980s, Jack Starr (a guitarist of French origin) was looking for the right elements to form the ultimate heavy metal band. The first to answer his call was drummer Joey Ayvazian and together they started jamming and auditioning singers. Future L.A. Guns bassist Kelly Nickels joined them in 1981. They auditioned around 40 singers before David DeFeis was introduced to Jack by a friend of Joey.

With an interpretation of &quot;No Quarter&quot; by Led Zeppelin, &quot;Child in Time&quot; by Deep Purple and &quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot; by Rainbow, David got the vacant role of singer, bringing with him bassist Joe O&#x27;Reilly. At the end of 1981 the first line-up was ready.

=== The debut album ===
Virgin Steele debuted in 1982 with &quot;Children of the Storm&quot; (a song loved by Metallica), included in the compilation &quot;U.S. Metal Vol. II&quot;. Later they issued their self-titled first album. Their style was and remains very original, a melding of American heavy metal and Rainbow&#x27;s epic atmospheres. DeFeis, who also plays piano and keyboards, shows a particular liking for pompous and melodic arrangements, while Starr goes for a harder and more immediate assault. Fan mail was becoming more interesting. Two letters in particular stand out, one from a young band, who were from Seattle. Their name was Queensrÿche. The other, from California, also a band, who called themselves Metallica.

=== The second album ===
The following year (1983) the second album &quot;Guardians of the Flame&quot; was supported by a mini LP called &quot;Wait for the Night&quot; (&quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; in the European version). After the album, Jack Starr started recording his first solo album, &quot;Out of the Darkness&quot;. Meanwhile, DeFeis continued the band with Edward Pursino. As stated in the Virgin Steele&#x27;s website &quot;we never actually asked Edward to join the band, he just came down one day and never left&quot;.) After a lawsuit won by Starr over the name &quot;Virgin Steele&quot;, he sold it to DeFeis.

=== &quot;Noble Savage&quot; and &quot;Age of Consent&quot; ===
Supported by Pursino, whose style better fit DeFeis&#x27; songwriting than Starr&#x27;s had, Virgin Steele new lineup recorded &quot;Noble Savage&quot;, which melds classic and epic music. Today, this album is still considered one of the most important manifests of heavy and epic metal worldwide. Between 1985 and 1986, some members of Virgin Steele strongly contributed to an album published under the name Exorcist called &quot;Nightmare Theatre&quot; and to an album published under the name Piledriver called &quot;Stay Ugly&quot;. David DeFeis only produced and helped these albums even if some rumors said that he and Pursino were behind these bands.

Finally, the band managed to go to Europe, supporting Manowar on tour and gaining great approval from all quarters because of their live performances. When things started to come together, though, some inexplicable laws seemed to apply and the following album, &quot;Age of Consent&quot;, got a very narrow distribution and ended up a complete commercial failure. At this point, Virgin Steele were in their darkest period: their label shut down and Joe O&#x27;Reilly decided to leave, forcing the band to stop playing for a while.

During this break, David DeFeis graduated in piano and composition and played live with a semi-improvised band called &quot;Smoke Stark Lightning&quot;, featuring some famous musicians like his old mate Jack Starr and drummer Bobby Rondinelli.

=== The comeback ===
In 1993, Rob De Martino was chosen as the new bass player and Virgin Steele came back with &quot;Life Among the Ruins&quot;, an album of Whitesnake-influenced hard rock with a strong bluesy vein. The song &quot;Last rose of Summer&quot; is the highlight of the cd. Featuring none of the trademark epic and mythology-based elements of the band, &quot;Life Among the Ruins&quot; is probably the most atypical release in the Virgin Steele discography and disliked by many die-hard classic metal fans. Quite interesting is the fact the American version has got a different cover and a bonus-track called &quot;Snakeskin Voodoo Man&quot; (published as a stand-alone single too) while many video-clips, taken from this album, were included into the home-video &quot;Tale Of The Snakeskin Voodoo Man&quot;.

=== &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot; ===
One year later, the band returned to the original sound with &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I&quot;, an album of epic metal full of melodic and symphonic influences, very progressive oriented. This work (a concept regarding the different side of human nature) includes, among the others, the song &quot;Life Among the Ruins&quot; which is not related to the previous album with the same title.

Virgin Steele went back to Europe supporting Manowar and Uriah Heep and at the beginning of 1996 released &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II&quot;, following the concept and the style of the first one. The band appeared also on the compilation &quot;A Tribute to Judas Priest: Legends of Metal – Volume II&quot; playing a raw cover of the song &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot;. Another Judas Priest cover, &quot;Desert Plains&quot;, is included as a bonus track in the &quot;Age of Consent&quot; album reissue.

After another European tour (this time as headliner) in 1996, a new album was released in March 1998: the third and final chapter of the &quot;Marriage&quot; saga, titled &quot;Invictus&quot;. This was their heaviest album at the time and also very epic. Lyrically it is a concept album about humanity&#x27;s rebellion against a pantheon of evil, uncaring gods. The band played at the Wacken Open Air festival in 1997 and in 1998. The Marriage of Heaven and Hell trilogy signs also the debut of drummer Frank Gilchriest. Always in 1998, Virgin Steele headlined a real long new European tour with Mark Reale&#x27;s Riot and Stigmata IV as supporting acts. This tour included the headliner performance at the biker festival &quot;Motorock&quot; in Cremona (Italy).

===Metal opera ===
Between the years 1999 and 2000, the band released a metal opera, writing the albums &quot;The House of Atreus Act I&quot; and &quot;The House of Atreus Act II&quot;, intended to be played by actors in theaters.

The subject of the metal opera was &quot;Oresteia&quot; and the Greek myths related by Aeschylus, very familiar to David DeFeis, because of his father&#x27;s theaterical background. On the albums all vocals and orchestrations are managed by David DeFeis himself.

Just before &quot;The House of Atreus Act II&quot;, the single &quot;Magick Fire Music&quot; was published, with some metal opera outtakes. Inspired by Virgin Steele&#x27;s metal opera, the German band Tobias Sammet&#x27;s Avantasia wrote various albums using the same format. David DeFeis appears as special guest on the track: &quot;The Final Sacrifice&quot; included in the Avantasia&#x27;s second album. After the show at the Bang Your Head!!! festival in 2000 without a bass player, in 2001 Virgin Steele toured with HammerFall and Freedom Call with the new bass player Josh Block.

=== The 20th anniversary ===
In 2002, the band released two compilations to celebrate the 20th anniversary. &quot;The Book of Burning&quot; consists of a mix of previously unreleased songs and new compositions created by David DeFeis in collaboration with original guitarist Jack Starr. The songs were written at the beginning of the 1990s and previously unofficially appeared in the underground, with Starr at the guitar, with the name &quot;Sacred Demos&quot;. The album contained also re-recordings of various songs from the first two albums with Josh Block, and not Jack Starr, supporting Pursino at the second guitar. &quot;Hymns to Victory&quot; instead is a best-of album covering the band&#x27;s career from &quot;Noble Savage&quot; to their latest album &quot;The House of Atreus Act II&quot;.

The way to manage the reissues of the first two albums &quot;Virgin Steele&quot; and &quot;Guardians of the Flame&quot;, never published in cd before, created one more time problems between DeFeis and Starr so they decided to truncate any sort of relationship. DeFeis managed the reissues all by himself remastering the original albums and adding new bonus tracks. The EP &quot;A Cry in the Night&quot; was included into the &quot;Guardians of the Flame&quot; CD.

=== Side projects ===
David DeFeis (keyboards and backing vocals) appears as special guest on the first two Immortally Committed albums in the tracks &quot;Epic&quot; and &quot;Council in Hell&quot;. He, Edward Pursino, Josh Block and Exorcist&#x27;s drummer Geoff Fontaine played some live dates with the New York cover band Carnival of Souls. Between the years 2002 and 2005, the band headlined a large number of heavy metal festivals such as the &quot;Agglutination Festival&quot; (2003, Italy), the &quot;Tradate Iron Fest&quot; (2004, Italy), the &quot;Keep It True V Festival&quot; (2004, Germany) and the &quot;Ragnarock Festival&quot; (2005, Netherlands).

=== &quot;A Barbaric Romantic Movie of the Mind&quot; ===
David DeFeis also created his own recording studio called &quot;The Hammer of Zeus&quot; (sometimes also called &quot;The Wrecking Ball of Thor&quot;). In September 2006, after 6 years without an all-new studio album, the band released its 11th full-length &quot;Visions of Eden&quot;. The album revolves heavily around Gnostic beliefs and critically revisits the traditional Christian mythology with regards to the creation of the Earth and the Biblical accounts of Adam and Eve. An even darker, more melancholic drama than the House of Atreus saga, the story revolves around Lilith, the first wife of Adam and a symbol of female strength and independence. Representing the female side of the true, higher god, she suffers under the lusting, jealous Demiurge who represents the Christian god, and as an emancipated woman who could not get along with the dominant Adam stands in stark contrast to Eve. Adam&#x27;s second wife is portrayed as a docile, subservient partner created by the demiurge at the request of Adam, who could not cope with an independent woman on equal footing with him.

&quot;Visions of Eden (A Barbaric Romantic Movie of the Mind)&quot; or &quot;The Lilith Project&quot; is based on the Sumerian legend of Lilith and it is intended as the soundtrack for an imaginary movie. The band is looking for a producer to bring this concept album story to screen.

=== Recent activities ===

In 2007, the band played at the Power Prog VIII Festival (Atlanta, Georgia) and at the Evolution Festival (Florence, Italy). David DeFeis and Josh Block appear on the Polish band Crystal Viper EP in the cover of Virgin Steele&#x27;s song &quot;Blood and Gasoline&quot; from &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I&quot; album. Between 2007 and 2008 the out of print albums &quot;Noble Savage&quot;, &quot;Age of Consent&quot;, &quot;Life Among the Ruins&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II&quot; were reissued (with bonus tracks) by the German label Dockyard1. There are also rumors that a DVD live album is planned, a three hours show recorded at the Downtown Club (Long Island, NY) in 2002 and an acoustic concert played in 2000 in München should be part of it.

A new Virgin Steele album, entitled &quot;The Black Light Bacchanalia&quot;, was released at the end of October 2010 for the new label SPV/Steamhammer while, in 2011, the whole back-catalogue, from &quot;Noble Savage&quot; onwards, will be reissued again with faithfully restored covers and booklets, bonus tracks and liner notes.

The first ever Virgin Steele tribute album &quot;By the Gods: A Noble Tribute to Virgin Steele&quot; was released on October 31, 2015, by Majestic Metal Records. It features a 12-page full-color booklet with exclusive liner notes by Virgin Steele&#x27;s frontman David DeFeis.

In February 2017, the album Visions of Eden was reissued as a double CD containing a remixed version and a remastered recording of the original mix.

Three years after Nocturnes of Hellfire &amp; Damnation, in 2018 the box-set Seven Devils Moonshine is published containing 3 new albums (&quot;Ghost Harvest – Vintage I – Black Wine for Mourning&quot;, &quot;Ghost Harvest – Vintage II – Red Wine for Warning&quot;, &quot;Gothic Voodoo Anthems&quot;) plus the re-issues of The Book of Burning and Hymns to Victory.

Five years after &quot;Seven Devils Moonshine&quot;, the band released their first album since then, and their first single-CD album since &quot;Nocturnes of Hellfire &amp; Damnation&quot;, &quot;The Passion of Dionysus&quot;, on June 30, 2023.

== Style ==

=== Barbaric romantic music ===
Virgin Steele play what they call symphonic, romantic and bombastic music with many elements taken from classical music and fantasy/mythological lyrics based on real life events. David DeFeis (all vocals, keyboards, orchestration, synth bass, swords and effects) about Virgin Steele&#x27;s music: &quot;From a whisper to a scream, barbaric, romantic, bombastic, yet subtle, grandiose, yet earthy. A call, a shout, an invocation to Freedom and the continual awakening to the awareness that every moment of life is lived to its fullest potential. It is a force, a sacred quest which drives Virgin Steele on&quot;.

Typically, during Virgin Steele&#x27;s concerts a sword is burnt on stage. In some special show they used to play a long live set called &quot;Three hour extravaganza&quot;. Fans consider &quot;The Burning of Rome (Cry for Pompeii)&quot; and &quot;Emalaith&quot; some of the most representative songs of the band.

Many Virgin Steele songs are mythological, often dealing with subjects from Greek and Christian mythology. Most of their albums are concept albums. The later albums tend to be more epic and mythological while, on the early albums (up until &quot;Life Among the Ruins&quot;), many songs are more real-life based stories of love and sex. According to David DeFeis, all the lyrics he writes are based on real life in some form or another.

=== Metal opera and theatre ===
A metal opera is a mix between rock opera, Broadway style and &quot;heavy metal adapted for theater actors&#x27; live performances&quot;. According to German artists Walter Weyers and Martina Krawulsky, with the name &quot;Klytaimnestra – The House of Atreus&quot;, metal opera (musically available on the Virgin Steele&#x27;s albums &quot;The House of Atreus Act I&quot;, &quot;The House of Atreus Act II&quot;) was performed on stage in Germany theaters by Landestheater Production. The result, very different from a heavy metal concert, is a metal based dark Broadway style musical really powerful and energetic with actors only. The premiere of &quot;Klytaimnestra&quot; in Memmingen, June 5, 1999, has been the first ever regular musical theatre show based on heavy metal concepts. After &quot;Klytaimnestra&quot;&#x27;s success, David DeFeis &amp; Landestheater Production extracted a second metal opera musical, named &quot;The Rebels&quot;, from the previous Marriage of Heaven and Hell trilogy (&quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part I&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell Part II&quot;, &quot;Invictus&quot;).

In 2003, the same team released a third metal opera, named &quot;Lilith&quot;, based on the material of album &quot;Visions of Eden&quot;. &quot;Visions of Eden&quot; was later on published in CD in 2006. In a different way to the previous two operas. Regarding the album, David DeFeis declared: &quot;I don&#x27;t think of it as a Metal Opera. What it really is, is the soundtrack for a major motion picture that has yet to be made! And by the hammer of Zeus, I will make this film one day. I call this work a Barbaric Romantic movie of the mind.&quot;.

<text>The Type 63 () is a Chinese 7.62×39mm assault rifle. The weapon&#x27;s overall design was based on the SKS (known in Chinese service as the Type 56 carbine), but with select fire capability and a rotating bolt system adapted from the Type 56 assault rifle, a derivative of the AK-47. It was originally introduced to replace the SKS as the standard service rifle of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, but was prematurely withdrawn from service due to numerous production difficulties. The Type 63 was originally manufactured with a milled steel receiver, although later production models had pressed and riveted steel receivers.

The Type 63 is occasionally misidentified in Western literature as the &quot;Type 68&quot;.

==History==
===Development===
From 1956 until the late 1980s, the standard service rifle of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) was the Type 56 carbine, a licensed derivative of the Soviet SKS. The SKS was well-regarded by the PLA, but it lacked select-fire capability and was limited to a ten-round fixed magazine fed from stripper clips. To overcome these shortcomings, Chinese military officials specified a new service rifle based on the overall SKS design but capable of fully automatic fire and modified to accept large capacity, detachable magazines. The new weapon had to incorporate a wooden stock and folding bayonet similar to those of the SKS for close quarters fighting. It also needed to be manufactured with the same tooling equipment as the SKS and AK-47 for logistical reasons, as the Chinese government wished to adapt its pre-existing production lines for the new rifle.

Work on the new weapon commenced in 1959, led by a diverse three-tiered development team consisting of technicians from arms factories, engineering faculty and students from universities, and military staff. At first, the team used the plans and technical data from the SKS as the basis for their rifle. However, they later drew more heavily on the internal structure of the AK-47, not only because of its proven select-fire capabilities but also the comparative ease of mass producing parts for that weapon. Uniquely, the design team was also entrusted with overseeing pre-production trials and the initial manufacturing process. The first prototypes became available in 1963, and it received the designation Type 63. The Type 63 was subsequently inspected and approved for service by Mao Zedong in his capacity as chair of the Chinese Central Military Commission. 

Serial production of the Type 63 commenced in 1969 and from the beginning was plagued with difficulties. The Chinese government failed to appoint quality control inspectors to oversee the initial phase of manufacturing, and as a result many of the quality control regulations released by the design team were ignored by the factory managers. Although PLA personnel were supposed to aid in the testing of sample rifles, they failed to do so. Due to the lack of oversight, a large number of technically unauthorized changes were made to the Type 63 to simplify or streamline manufacturing, and the original specifications disregarded.

Almost 700 changes were unilaterally made to the Type 63 design without adequate testing or approval from the development team and the PLA. The first catastrophic design change came when factory staff decided to manufacture the Type 63 with a pressed and pinned barrel, as opposed to threading the barrels into the receiver as called for in the technical data. This method was much more cost effective and efficient, but several miscalculations were made which caused the barrels to deform prematurely under stress, and they often failed to fit the receivers properly. Additionally, the pins used to hold the pressed barrels and the receivers in place were of poor quality and suffered a high failure rate. The factory staff also began experimenting with stamped and riveted receivers for the Type 63, as opposed to the original milled receiver design which was much more labor-intensive to produce. The design of the stamped receiver specified an excessive number of rivets, which coupled with the nonexistent quality control, often resulted in inconsistent riveting that compromised the receiver. The decision was also made to simply paint the receivers and barrels rather than producing them with a blued finish; the paint flaked off almost immediately under field conditions and failed to protect the rifle&#x27;s exposed metal surfaces from rust or corrosion.

In 1974, responding to multiple complaints from the PLA, the Chinese government carried out a program to improve quality control and improve the manufacture of the stamped receivers and pinned barrels. However, the accuracy of the Type 63 had been permanently affected by the changes to the receiver and barrel design, and it remained much less accurate than the SKS it was supposed to replace. The receivers also continued to suffer fractures and cracks under routine field conditions. 

In 1978, the PLA ordered the Type 63 withdrawn from general service, and production was formally discontinued. The Type 63 production line was reassigned and re-tooled for the production of the SKS/Type 56 carbine, and the PLA units which had previously been issued the Type 63 were re-issued with the older weapon. 

In 1979, some newly reworked and upgraded Type 63s were delivered on a limited basis to select PLA units for the Sino-Vietnamese War. These rifles had redesigned bolts, recoil springs, and firing pins, and were modified to accept standard AK magazines. Despite positive field reports concerning their performance, they were again withdrawn from service at the war&#x27;s end.

A number of elements of the Type 63 design, namely the unique gas regulator, were later incorporated into the design of the Type 81 assault rifle.

===Service===

The Type 63 entered service with the PLA in 1969, and for the first two years of production the weapon remained favorably evaluated by Chinese infantry troops. However, an increasing number of complaints emerged from the PLA during the mid 1970s, namely that the Type 63 was inaccurate and often failed to hold zero. Other common complaints concerned the brittle nature of the parts, and injuries caused by malfunctions in the gas regulators. By the late 1970s, the PLA general staff in nine Chinese military regions had rejected the Type 63 and requested an alternative service rifle, citing concerns over the rifle&#x27;s poor accuracy. The Type 63 was formally withdrawn from service in 1978 due to these complaints, and the affected units re-armed with older SKS/Type 56 carbines. All existing Type 63s were relegated to storage, or passed to the Chinese militia.

In 1979, with PLA forces suffering from a shortage of automatic weapons in the Sino-Vietnamese War, a small number of Type 63s were returned to service. To simplify logistics, these were not issued with their proprietary magazines but modified to accept the same magazine as the Type 56 assault rifle. They were withdrawn from service again when the war ended.

China exported small quantities of Type 63s as military aid to North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Others were supplied to the Khmer Rouge in neighboring Cambodia. Khmer Rouge forces used Type 63s during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. The primary export customer for the Type 63 outside Asia was Albania, which purchased a large number of the rifles during the 1970s. Some were also exported to Afghanistan and unidentified African nations. The Kosovo Liberation Army used Type 63s, likely acquired through Albania, during the Kosovo War.

==Description==

The Type 63 is a gas-operated, select-fire assault rifle with a conventional wooden stock and the ability to accept proprietary 15 and 20 round magazines. If the bolt stop is removed, or ground down, it can accept the same standard AK-pattern magazines as the Type 56 assault rifle. A Type 63 with a seated magazine can be loaded from an SKS stripper clip seated in the bolt carrier. The Type 63&#x27;s receiver and barrel are closely modeled on those of the SKS, but the bolt action is based on that of the AK-47. It has a two-piece gas regulator that can generate sparks when the weapon is fired, necessitating the use of a protective sleeve on later models. The gas regulator is usually set with the smaller of two holes closer to the barrel. The larger hole is used to increase gas flow, and can be selected simply by pressing the regulator retainer towards the gas tube. 

When a round is discharged, some of the propellant gas passes through the vent and into the gas tube above the barrel. This forces the piston back, and the bolt carrier is driven rearwards and rotates the hammer back. After traveling six millimeters, a cam cut in the bolt carrier reaches the operating lug of the bolt, causing it to rotate, extracting the spent cartridge. When the bolt carrier hits the rear of the receiver it rebounds, and the next round is chambered. The extractor secures the rim of the next cartridge as the bolt returns forward. The bolt carrier cam then acts on the operating lug, rotating it into the locked position.

There are three fire selector markings on the right side of the receiver: &quot;0&quot; (safety), &quot;1&quot; (semi-automatic fire), and &quot;2&quot; (fully automatic fire&quot;). The Type 63&#x27;s trigger safety is engaged by rotating the selector to the rearmost &quot;0&quot;, although the bolt can still be released.

Each Type 63 is fitted with a folding spike bayonet similar to that of the Type 56 carbine. The handle is forced back against a spring, freeing the bayonet to rotate forward and be locked into place at the muzzle.

<doc id="1047364" wikidata="Q2628423" url="?curid=1047364" title="Białystok Ghetto uprising">
<text>The Białystok Ghetto uprising was an insurrection in the Jewish Białystok Ghetto against the Nazi German occupation authorities during World War II. The uprising was launched on the night of August 16, 1943 and was the second-largest ghetto uprising organized in Nazi-occupied Poland after the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of April–May 1943. It was led by the Anti-Fascist Military Organisation (&quot;Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa&quot;), a branch of the Warsaw Anti-Fascist Bloc.

The revolt began upon the German announcement of mass deportations from the ghetto. The main objective was to break the German siege and allow the maximum number of Jews to escape into the neighboring Knyszyn (&quot;Knyszyński&quot;) Forest. A group of about 300 to 500 insurgents armed with 25 rifles and 100 pistols as well as home-made Molotov cocktails for grenades, attacked the overwhelming German force with a great loss of life. Leaders of the uprising committed suicide. Several dozen combatants managed to break through and run into the Knyszyn Forest where they joined other guerrilla groups.

==Background==
The Białystok Ghetto was set up by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In February 1943, the first wave of mass deportations to Treblinka extermination camp took place, organized during country-wide Aktion Reinhard. The final liquidation of the ghetto was attempted on August 16, 1943, by regiments of the German SS reinforced by Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Latvian auxiliaries (&quot;Hiwis&quot;), known as the &quot;Trawniki men&quot; .

==Uprising==
During the night of August 16, 1943, several hundred Polish Jews started an armed uprising against the troops carrying out liquidation of the ghetto. The guerillas led by Mordechaj Tenenbaum and Daniel Moszkowicz were armed with only one machine gun, rifles, several dozen pistols, Molotov cocktails and bottles filled with acid. As with the earlier Warsaw Ghetto Uprising extinguished in May 1943, the Białystok uprising had no chance for military success. However, it was seen as a way to die in combat rather than in German camps. A Betar youth commander was Yitzhak Fleischer, also spelled Fleisher, or Berl Fleischer according to different source.

The fights in isolated pockets of resistance lasted for several days, but the defence was broken almost instantly with a tank sent into the ghetto by SS &quot;Gruppenführer&quot; Odilo Globocnik. German soldiers set fire to the area. The commanders of the struggle committed suicide after their bunkers ran out of ammunition. In spite of the insurgency, the planned deportations to concentration and extermination camps went ahead on August 17, 1943, without any delay. Approximately 10,000 Jews were led to the Holocaust trains and sent to camps in Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz. A transport of 1,200 children were sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp and later to Auschwitz, where they were murdered.

Several dozen guerillas managed to break through to the forests surrounding Białystok where they joined the partisan units of Armia Krajowa and other organisations and survived the war. It is estimated that out of almost 60,000 Jews who lived in Białystok before World War II, only several hundred survived the Holocaust.

==Analysis==
Historian Evgeny Finkel argues that &quot;the comparison of the Minsk, Kraków, and Białystok ghettos suggests a direct linkage between the likelihood of uprising and the Zionists&#x27; leading role in the underground&quot;; in Bialystok, the local Zionist chapters were well organized and had experience with clandestine activity from having operated underground even before the Nazi occupation, and ultimately successfully organized a rebellion, and convinced the rival communist faction to join; in Kraków, the Zionists were poorly organized and often dependent on cooperation with the communists, and thus could not successfully realize an uprising despite intending to. The difference between communist and Zionist behavior has been explained in the Zionists&#x27; greater salience of Jewish identity; they preferred to defend Jewish honor to the end even when doing so was suicidal, whereas the communists preferred to flee into forested lands and regroup.

<text>Eleanor Rosch (once known as Eleanor Rosch Heider; born 9 July 1938) is an American psychologist. She is a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, specializing in cognitive psychology and primarily known for her work on categorization, in particular her prototype theory, which has profoundly influenced the field of cognitive psychology.

Throughout her work Rosch has conducted extensive research focusing on a range of topics, including semantic categorization, mental representation of concepts, and linguistics. Her research interests include cognition, concepts, causality, thinking, memory, and cross-cultural, and Eastern and religious psychology. Her more recent work in the psychology of religion has sought to show the implications of Buddhism and contemplative aspects of Western religions for modern psychology.

==Early life and education==
Rosch was born in New York City, the daughter of an English teacher from England and a mother who was a Russian refugee. She completed an undergraduate philosophy thesis at Reed College on Wittgenstein, who she said &quot;cured her of studying philosophy.&quot;

After school, she served as a social worker in Portland for several years, returning later to Harvard to study clinical psychology at the then-Department of Social Relations. Rosch delivered a paradigm-changing doctoral thesis at Harvard about category formation, under the direction of Roger Brown. After a short stint at Brown University and Connecticut College, Rosch joined the Department of Psychology at University of California, Berkeley in 1971.

==Research==
From field experiments Rosch conducted (alongside her then-husband Karl Heider) in the 1970s with the Dani people of Papua New Guinea, she concluded that when categorizing an everyday object or experience, people rely less on abstract definitions of categories than on a comparison of the given object or experience with what they deem to be the object or experience best representing a category (&quot;prototype&quot;).

Although the Dani lack words for all the English colors (their language contained only two color terms dividing all colors into either the &quot;light, bright&quot; category or the &quot;dark, cool&quot; category), Rosch showed that they could still categorize objects by colors for which they had no words. She argued that basic objects have a psychological import that transcends cultural differences and shapes how such objects are mentally represented. She concluded that people in different cultures tend to categorize objects by using prototypes, although the prototypes of particular categories may vary.

Rosch contributed to multiple scholarly works of taxonomic analysis of objects based on these prototype (&quot;chair&quot;) and subordinate terms (&quot;tall black leather chair&quot;). She inferred that overuse of subordinate terms could be attributed to the attitude of snobbery and elitism.

Her work has been often referenced by that of computer vision and deep learning researcher Aude Oliva, who has built upon Rosch&#x27;s object classifications to teach computers to recognize basic scenes instantly interpreted by humans.

<text>Jean Frédéric Frenet (; 7 February 1816 – 12 June 1900) was a French mathematician, astronomer, and meteorologist. He was born and died in Périgueux, France.

He is best known for being an independent co-discoverer of the Frenet–Serret formulas. He wrote six out of the nine formulas, which at that time were not expressed in vector notation. These formulas are important in the theory of space curves (differential geometry), and they were presented in his doctoral thesis at Toulouse in 1847. That year he became a professor at Toulouse, and one year later, 1848, he became professor of mathematics at Lyon. He also was director of an astronomical observatory at Lyon. Four years later, in 1852, he published the Frenet formulas in the &quot;Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées&quot;.

In 1856 his calculus primer was first published, which ran through seven editions, the last one published posthumously in 1917.

<text>Litovoi, also Litvoy, was a Vlach/Romanian &quot;voivode&quot; in the 13th century whose territory comprised northern Oltenia in today&#x27;s Romania.

He is mentioned for the first time in the Diploma of the Joannites issued by king Béla IV of Hungary (1235–1270) on 2 July 1247. The diploma granted territories to the Knights Hospitaller in the Banate of Severin and &quot;Cumania&quot;, &quot;“with the exception of the land of the kenazate of Voivode Litovoi,”&quot; which the king left to the Vlachs &quot;“as they had held it”&quot;.

== Name ==
The king’s diploma also refers to the &quot;kenazate&quot;s of Farcaș and John and to a certain &quot;voivode&quot; Seneslau. Although the names of Litovoi and Seneslau are of Slavic origin, they are expressly said to be Vlachs &quot;(Olati)&quot; in the king&#x27;s diploma. It seems that Litovoi was the most powerful of all the above local rulers. His territories were exempted from the grant to the knights, but half of the royal tax generated by his land &quot;(terra Lytua)&quot; was assigned to the Hospitallers – except for the income from the District of Hátszeg (&quot;terra Harszoc&quot; in the diploma’s only surviving, papal copy, ), which the king kept all for himself. According to the Romanian historian Ioan-Aurel Pop, the king had grabbed Haţeg from Litovoi shortly before 1247.

== War with the Hungarians ==
In 1277 (or between 1277 and 1280), Litovoi was at war with the Hungarians over lands king Ladislaus IV of Hungary (1272–1290) claimed for the crown, but for which Litovoi refused to pay tribute. Litovoi was killed in battle. This event is recounted in the king’s letter of grant of 8 January 1285, in which king Ladislaus IV donated villages in Sáros County (today in Slovakia) to Master George, son of Simon, who had been sent against Litovoi.

Ioan Aurel Pop argues that the Litovoi mentioned in the diploma of 1247 was not identical to the Litovoi whose death is described in the letter of grant of 1285, and the latter was probably the former’s successor.

<doc id="1047379" wikidata="Q4816174" url="?curid=1047379" title="Atlanta University Center">
<text>The Atlanta University Center Consortium (AUC Consortium) is a collaboration between four historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in southwest Atlanta, Georgia: Clark Atlanta University, Spelman College, Morehouse College, and the Morehouse School of Medicine. It is the oldest and largest contiguous consortium of African-American higher education institutions in the United States. The consortium structure allows for students to cross-register at the other institutions in order to attain a broader collegiate experience. They also share the Robert W. Woodruff Library, a dual degree engineering program, and career planning and placement services and the AUC Data Science Initiative.

==History==
The Atlanta University Center (AUC) was created in April 1929, when John Hope, then president of both Morehouse College and the former Atlanta University saw the potential gains from such a consortium. Atlanta, Morehouse and Spelman signed the affiliation agreement and became the original members of the AUC. Clark College and Morris Brown College joined in 1957, followed by the Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC) in 1959. Morehouse School of Medicine (which became independent from Morehouse College) joined the AUC in 1983. Morris Brown ended its affiliation with AUC when the school lost its accreditation in December 2002.

The Atlanta University Center has undergone several administrative and governance changes since its inception. In 2004, the business operating as AUC, Inc. was dissolved. A new corporation, known as the AUC Consortium, Inc., was established in its place and Marilyn Jackson became the first female CEO and executive director, with fiduciary responsibilities. In 2011, the current executive director, Dr. Sherry Turner, was selected to expand the Consortium&#x27;s community revitalization efforts.

===Former members and closely related institutions===
To be eligible for membership in the AUC Consortium, a college or university must be regionally accredited, maintain tax-exempt status, and pay a membership assessment. Morris Brown College was a member of the AUC Consortium until it lost its accreditation and federal funding in 2002 during the 1998–2002 tenure of Dr. Dolores E. Cross as school president.

The Interdenominational Theological Center (ITC) is eligible for membership in AUC Consortium, but is not currently a member. However, the ITC is a member of the library sharing consortium of Robert W. Woodruff Library, which is part of the AUC Consortium.

==Location==

The AUC campuses are located in the Atlanta University Center District, near Downtown Atlanta and immediately southwest of Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

==Museums==
The Spelman College Museum of Fine Art and Clark Atlanta University Museum of Art are the two designated museums in the AUC.

==Olive Branch tradition==
Olive Branch is a long-standing tradition where new first-year students from Clark Atlanta, Morehouse, and Spelman gather for an official AUC unity ceremony and celebration every August before the beginning of the fall semester.

==Homecomings==
Spelman and Morehouse annually have homecoming festivities in the same week during the fall semester. The parallel homecomings are traditionally referred to as &quot;SpelHouse Homecoming.&quot; Clark Atlanta&#x27;s homecoming is usually in a different week from Spelman and Morehouse. Every few years, all three institutions have homecoming during the same week which is traditionally referred to as &quot;SpArkHouse Homecoming.&quot; Homecomings significantly contribute to the cultural identity of the AUC and attract tens of thousands of alumni, students, celebrity guests, and visitors.

==Dual Degree Engineering Program (DDEP)==
In 1969, the AUC Consortium established a dual degree engineering program that allows its undergraduate students to receive two degrees in approximately five years. Students must first complete a science, technology or mathematics curriculum at an AUC institution, followed by the completion of an engineering curriculum at the engineering institution. Upon successful completing both curricula, students earn two degrees: a Bachelor of Science degree awarded from an AUC institution, and a Bachelor of Science degree in a specific engineering discipline from an affiliated engineering institution. Engineering institutions affiliated with DDEP include Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Michigan, University of Notre Dame, Auburn University, Clarkson University, Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Alabama in Huntsville, and North Carolina A&amp;T State University. Since its inception, over 1,100 students have successfully completed the dual degree program.

Spelman never offered engineering degrees which is most common among liberal arts colleges. In 2003, Clark Atlanta&#x27;s leadership voted to end its engineering programs for budget reasons. In 2019, Morehouse established its first engineering degree program with software engineering.

==AUC Data Science Initiative==
In 2019, United Health Group donated $8.25 million to the AUC Consortium to establish the AUC Data Science Initiative. This initiative offers technical classes to AUC students who want to specialize in data science or learn data analysis to give them a competitive edge in the job market. A major objective of this initiative is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities in the data science and analytics fields.

==3+3 Law Program==
In 2019, three AUC institutions (Morehouse, Spelman, and Clark Atlanta) established an admissions agreement with Syracuse University College of Law allowing their students to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree and law degree in approximately six years.

==Spike Fellowship==
In 2023, Morehouse alumnus Spike Lee and the Gersh Agency, launched a competitive fellowship program for AUC students interested in careers in the entertainment and media industry. Students selected will receive a paid graduate study summer internship, executive mentorships and $25,000 in student loan payoff and debt relief. The goal of the fellowship is to increase diversity in all aspects of the entertainment and media industry. 

==Religious institutions==
Three denominational campus ministry centers have been established to serve the students of the Atlanta University Center. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta operates the Lyke House Catholic Student Center, the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta operates the Absalom Jones Episcopal Student Center and Chapel, the Absalom Jones Student Center also houses the Lutheran Campus ministry which serves both students and the members of the adjoining community. Two of these campus ministry facilities are named after notable Black American clerics.

<text>Seneslau, also Seneslav or Stănislau, was a Vlach &quot;voivode&quot; mentioned in the Diploma of the Joannites issued by king Béla IV of Hungary (1235–1270) on 2 July 1247. The diploma granted territories to the Knights Hospitaller in the Banate of Severin and &quot;Cumania&quot;. According to the diploma, the king gave the territories east of the Olt River to the knights, with the exception of the territory of &quot;voivode&quot; Seneslau.

The name of Seneslav is of Slavic origin. Seneslau held central and southern Muntenia (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the territories along the rivers Argeş and Dâmboviţa). The Romanian historian Ioan Aurel Pop suggests that Seneslau was quasi independent of the king of Hungary. According to the Hungarian historian István Vásáry, his title &quot;(voivode)&quot; suggests that he had a territorial unit under his jurisdiction.

The diploma of Béla IV also refers to the &quot;kenazate&quot;s of John, Farcaş and &quot;voivode&quot; Litovoi. Although the names of Seneslau and Litovoi are of Slavic origin, they are expressly said to be Vlachs &quot;(Olati)&quot; in the king&#x27;s diploma.

<doc id="1047389" wikidata="Q1651422" url="?curid=1047389" title="Vz. 52 rifle">
<text>The vz. 52 rifle is a semi-automatic rifle developed shortly after the Second World War in Czechoslovakia. Its full name is 7,62mm samonabíjecí puška vzor 52. Vz. 52 is an abbreviation for &quot;vzor 52&quot;, meaning &quot;model 52&quot;. It fires the unique 7.62×45mm cartridge. 52 rifles were made by Považské strojárne in Považská Bystrica, but due to production difficulties, its manufacture was taken over by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod.

==Design details==
The vz. 52 is a shoulder-fired semi-automatic rifle with a tilting-bolt locking mechanism powered by an annular short-stroke gas piston system. The bolt is locked by two lugs that recess into slots machined into the receiver. However, unlike most vertically-locking breech mechanism, the rifle&#x27;s bolt has the unusual feature of tipping the bolt frontally to lock the mechanism, whereas other tipping bolt designs tip the bolt to the rear. The piston is actuated by residual gases from the bore, vented into a sleeve surrounding the barrel to overcome the inertia of the bolt carrier, bolt and the resistance of the return spring in order to unlock the chamber, eject the empty cartridge casing and then introduce a new round into the chamber upon return to battery.

The barrel is press-fit and pinned into the receiver. The manual safety switch is placed inside of the trigger guard and is manipulated by the shooter&#x27;s index finger. The trigger mechanism closely resembles that used in the American M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle. The cocking handle is integrated into the bolt carrier and is located on the right side of the rifle.

The rifle is equipped with open-type iron sights with a hooded front post and V-notch rear sight placed on a sliding tangent, adjustable for elevation between 100–950 m. The rifle can also accept day and night-time optics that interface with an optional, receiver-mounted side rail. The one-piece pistol grip stock is carved from either walnut or beech and stained a yellowish-brown color; the stock has a hollowed butt which is used as a storage compartment for a cleaning rod, oil bottle and accessories. The rifle has an integral blade bayonet which folds into a recess carved into the stock on the right side.

The vz. 52 feeds from a detachable box magazine with a 10-round cartridge capacity but could also be rapidly recharged from stripper clips with the bolt retracted. For this purpose, a stripper clip guide is milled into the front face of the bolt carrier, aligning with the magazine when the bolt is locked in the open position. This is the primary method of reloading the rifle as infantrymen were only issued 2 magazines per rifle. It ejects cartridge cases vigorously forward and to the left.

==Conversion==
After pressure from the Soviet Union to adopt its 7.62×39mm cartridge, existing Czech rifles were rechambered to the Soviet caliber, and all further production of the rifle was chambered in this caliber and re-designated the vz. 52/57. The vz. 52/57 is identical to the vz. 52 except for its barrel and its magazines. It is considerably less common and is generally found in better condition due to the vz. 52/57 chromium-plated bore and chamber. The vz. 52 magazines can be used with the vz. 52/57, but they do not feed as reliably.

==Decommissioning==

All of the vz. 52 series were quickly replaced in Czechoslovak service by the vz. 58, but the earlier rifles found their way to Soviet allies during the Cold War, and have seen service in Grenada, Somalia, Cuba and Afghanistan and many of those were passed on to guerrillas. At least 12,000 of Cuba&#x27;s vz. 52s were emptied from that country&#x27;s reserve stocks and donated to Angola as military aid during the Cuban intervention in Angola.

The Czech Castle guard uses chrome-finished, deactivated vz. 52 rifles with darkened wood stocks as ceremonial weapons.

<doc id="1047391" wikidata="Q7653444" url="?curid=1047391" title="Swan Hellenic">
<text>Swan Hellenic is a British cruise line specialising in expedition tours of historical or cultural interest aimed at the upper end of the cruise market. Swan Hellenic was first established as Swan&#x27;s Tours in the 1950s as a tour operator carrying guests to historic sites, providing enrichment throughout their trips. In 1983, Swan Hellenic was acquired by P&amp;O and became a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc in 2003, but it ended operations in 2007 after Carnival discontinued the brand. Shortly after, All Leisure Holidays Group purchased and revived Swan Hellenic, but ended its operations in 2017. G Adventures acquired the brand later that year and planned to revive it for a second time in 2018, but sold the brand to a private group in 2020, which plans to resume Swan Hellenic&#x27;s operations with its first-ever new-build ship in 2021.

==History==

=== 1950s–1983: Swan&#x27;s Tours ===
In the 1950s, a British travel agency, Swan&#x27;s Tours, operated by a father and son (W.F. Swan and R.K. Swan), was asked to organise a tour for visitors interested in the antiquities of Greece. Archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler served as a guest lecturer on the tours. The tours developed into a full programme of cruises, a concept known as &quot;cultural cruising,&quot; in which well known academics, writers and clergymen were regularly featured as guest lecturers, both on board ships and on site. Swan&#x27;s Tours prided itself on never repeating an itinerary and focused its business on touring classical sites in the Aegean Sea, around the coasts and islands of modern Greece and Turkey. It also visited classical and other ancient sites in north Africa (including Egypt) and the eastern Mediterranean. In contrast to most commercial cruises offered at the time, in which the onboard entertainment was as important as the destinations visited, Swan&#x27;s itineraries included almost-daily port calls for visits to historic sites, placing a high emphasis on the destination-oriented nature of its business. The operation was characterised by an English ethos of high culture, although it had an international following.

=== 1983–2007: As subsidiaries of P&amp;O and Carnival ===
In 1983, P&amp;O acquired Swan Hellenic from the Swan family. In 2003, it became a subsidiary of Carnival Corporation &amp; plc after Carnival merged with P&amp;O Princess Cruises. Under Carnival, the characteristically small 300-passenger ship &quot;Minerva&quot; was replaced in 2003 by the 600-passenger &quot;Minerva II&quot;. This led to criticism that the intimacy of the original cruise concept had been compromised.

On 7 April 2007, Carnival officially ceased Swan Hellenic&#x27;s operations, and transferred &quot;Minerva II&quot; to the Princess Cruises fleet with the new name of &quot;Royal Princess&quot;. Swan Hellenic&#x27;s demise was also compounded when Martin Randall Travel launched a series of cruises to fill the niche Swan Hellenic had left.

=== 2007–2017: First revival ===
On 15 March 2007, following news of Carnival folding the Swan Hellenic brand, Lord Sterling, the former chairman of P&amp;O, announced that he was buying the Swan Hellenic brand and intended to relaunch the cruise line as soon as a suitable vessel could be located. All Leisure Holidays Group (ALG) subsequently acquired Swan Hellenic, joining it with sister brand Voyages of Discovery. The revived brand intended to begin operations with &quot;Minerva&quot; in May 2008, but the maiden voyage was later postponed after the ship&#x27;s generators incurred problems. For her inaugural season, &quot;Minerva&quot; was scheduled to sail itineraries to the Baltic, Scandinavia, and Mediterranean.

In January 2008, Swan Hellenic announced it would begin operating river cruises in 2009, offering itineraries sailing on the Danube from Vienna and on the Rhône from Lyon. The cruises were operated in partnership with A-Rosa Cruises, and were offered with packages that included land excursions and gratuity charges.

On 4 January 2017, it was reported that ALG had gone into administration, leaving 400 passengers abroad. The Civil Aviation Authority was instructed to repatriate them and future bookings for 13,000 others had been cancelled with pending refunds. The news came one day after the company announced it was cancelling its first itineraries of 2017, seen as a precursor to the ending of operations after profits had declined in recent years. That month, Grant Thornton&#x27;s Eddie Williams, administrator to ALG, told BBC: &quot;The cruise operations [of Swan Hellenic and Voyages of Discovery] have been significantly loss-making over a number of years and the ongoing cost of funding these operations by the tour operations has created significant cash issues for the entire group, which has ultimately led to the administration of all businesses.&quot; Following ALG&#x27;s closure, &quot;Minerva&quot;, the only ship operating for Swan Hellenic, was laid up in Marseille awaiting sale.

=== 2017–present: Second revival ===
In February 2017, G Adventures announced it had acquired the Swan Hellenic brand, with the plan to restart operations in 2018. Itineraries were scheduled to be released that summer, though none were ultimately publicized and released for sale.

On 22 July 2020, a team led by former cruise industry executive Andrea Zito announced it had purchased Swan Hellenic from G Adventures. Zito, who had helped to broker the sale of Swan Hellenic to G Adventures in 2017 while working for V-Ships Leisure, said the revived brand will retain its British heritage and maintain the breadth of international offerings provided in the past by honing in on its focus on exploring different cultures across global destinations. The revived brand will launch with offices in Cyprus, Düsseldorf and Monaco. Swan Hellenic is scheduled to begin operations with the brand&#x27;s first-ever new-build, an expedition vessel built by Helsinki Shipyard in Hietalahti, scheduled for delivery in August 2021 for a November 2021 debut, with a sister ship slated for delivery in September 2022 for an October 2022 debut. The 152-passenger vessels are designed to sail in the polar regions and the tropics. The vessels, temporarily named &quot;Vega 1&quot; and &quot;Vega 2&quot;, will be built to Polar Class 5, measure 113 metres (370 ft) long, 20,2 metres (66 ft) wide and have a maximum crew capacity of 120. The ownership of Swan Hellenic is split between three Cyprus-based companies (shareholders, also listed as shipowners) - Capstans Ltd, Valbridge Ltd, and Diamant Ltd.

<doc id="1047392" wikidata="Q3022458" url="?curid=1047392" title="Denham Film Studios">
<text>Denham Film Studios (&quot;later dubbed Anvil Studios)&quot; was a British film production studio operating from 1936 to 1952, founded by Alexander Korda, in Buckinghamshire. 

Notable films made at Denham include &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. From the 1950s to the 1970s the studio became best known for recording film music, including the scores for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

The studio buildings were demolished in 1981 and the site re-landscaped as a business park; as of 2017 it has been turned over to residential use.

==History==
The studios were founded by Alexander Korda in 1935, on a 165-acre (668,000 m2) site known as &#x27;The Fisheries&#x27; near the village of Denham, Buckinghamshire, and designed by architects Walter Gropius and Maxwell Fry. At the time it was the largest facility of its kind in the UK. In 1937, Queen Mary visited the studios while &quot;The Drum&quot; was being filmed. In 1946, &#x27;Stage One Music Theatre&#x27; opened. Designed by sound recordist and engineer Cyril Crowhurst, the stage could accommodate 120 performers.

The studios were known by various names during their lifetime including London Film Studios, the home of Korda&#x27;s London Films. It was merged with the Rank Organisation&#x27;s Pinewood Studios to form D&amp;P Studios; Pinewood is just 4 miles south of Denham. Film makers were said to prefer Denham as a location, leading to Pinewood Studios being used for storage during the Second World War.
Some of the notable films made at Denham include, &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Bernard Miles said that &quot;when the technicians, the electricians and carpenters and so on, on the floor, who had been watching a scene filmed, applauded, you knew it was good, because they&#x27;d seen the best.&quot; Colin Sorensen, who as a schoolboy often watched the work going on at Denham recalled the sight &quot;of the main studio buildings, a great mass of, probably asbestos, grey-green roofs&quot; and the smell of &quot;cellulose paint merged with newly cut soft wood.&quot; The proximity of Denham Aerodrome was sometimes difficult. Mary Morris remembered that an intimate scene with Leslie Howard, for &quot;Pimpernel Smith&quot; was &quot;interrupted 22 times by aircraft noise.&quot;

Denham&#x27;s final film was made in 1952, and the J. Arthur Rank Company went on to rent the facility to the United States Air Force between 1955 and December 1961. In the 1960s and 70s Rank occupied the Art Deco office buildings and used most of the sound stages as warehouses. Despite this, from the 1950s Denham became one of the most important centres for recording film music, the studio played host to Bernard Herrmann, John Barry, Jerry Goldsmith and John Williams, among others.

After the closing of the film studio, Stage One Music Theatre was used periodically by Pinewood Studios and Rank to record film scores, including for &quot;Vertigo&quot;, &quot;The Three Worlds of Gulliver&quot; and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot;. In 1966 the film production company Anvil Films moved into the large music stage at Denham. Led by Ken Cameron (brother of the famous journalist James), Ken Scrivener, Richard Warren and Ralph May, Anvil recorded post-synching dialogue, Foley sound effects and music. By 1969, the studio claimed it was the most technologically advanced recording studio in Europe. Important films recorded during their time at the studio, included &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;International Velvet&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the TV miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;, Alien and &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. The company was forced to move in 1980 when the studio was bought by a developer.

The buildings on the south of the site were demolished in 1980 and the area redeveloped and landscaped as Broadwater Park business park. The landscaped gardens, by Preben Jakobsen and utilising spoil from the demolished buildings, are included on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. In 2017 the Grade II listed main studio building and surrounding land were redeveloped as luxury flats and houses. The Art Deco main building, which included a film processing laboratory and cinema, is the only surviving building from the original film studios.

<doc id="1047394" wikidata="Q773924" url="?curid=1047394" title="Yonex">
<text>is a Japanese sports equipment manufacturing company. Yonex produces equipment and apparel for tennis, badminton, golf, and running.

Its range of products manufactured and commercialized includes equipment for badminton and tennis (rackets, shuttlecocks, balls, bags) and golf (clubs, bags). Yonex also produces athletic shoes and apparel including T-shirts, jackets, skirts, shorts, hoodies, leggings and hats.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1946 by Minoru Yoneyama as a producer of wooden floats for fishing nets. The company was later forced out of this market because of the invention of plastic floats. This led to a commitment by Yoneyama to never again be left behind by technological advancements.

In 1957, Yoneyama began to make badminton racquets for other brands. By 1961, the first Yoneyama-branded racquet was introduced, and within another two years an export company was created for the worldwide distribution. After the company began to make aluminium badminton racquets in 1969, it found that the same technology could be applied to the tennis racket which the company introduced in 1971. The company began to experiment with graphite shafts for both types of rackets and found that these would also be useful for golf clubs.

In 1982 Yonex came out with the new oversized tennis racquet in the REX-series with the R-7 and R-10 racquets. At that time Martina Navratilova played with the R-7 and was very successful. One year later, the new series Rexking was developed with the R-22. Navratilova subsequently used the white RQ 180 widebody frame until the early 1990s.
Finding a growing market, the Yonex Corporation (a wholly owned subsidiary) was established in Torrance, California, US in July 1983. In 1992 Yonex introduced the widebody badminton racket, the &quot;Isometric 500&quot;, a racquet that was much less &quot;tear drop&quot;-shaped than previous ones. The more &quot;square&quot; head gave it a much larger striking surface, which provides a larger &quot;sweet spot&quot; to hit the shuttle. It led other manufacturers to follow suit in &quot;square-head&quot; or isometric designs.

The parent company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1994. Yonex describes itself as &quot;the world leader in golf, tennis and badminton equipment.&quot; Yonex provides clothing for national badminton associations around the world, such as the Malaysian Badminton Association, Badminton Scotland, Badminton England, Badminton Ireland, and Badminton Wales. Yonex has also been teaming up with OCBC (Orange County Badminton Club) since 2007 to host the annual U.S. Open Grand Prix Badminton Championships.

Yonex has become the dominant corporate player in badminton. Yonex sponsors the All England Open Badminton Championships and is a partner of the Badminton World Federation which organizes the World Championships. Upwards of 80% of competitive players use their racquets, as it is the preferred choice amongst professionals. Yonex is significant in the tennis and golf industries as well and is a major sponsor of professional athletes in all three sports.

== Controversies ==
*Yonex signed a contract with the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association regarding national team jersey sponsorship in 2014. However, Yonex would often send players clothing and shoes to wear a few days before major tournaments, with the shoes unfit for players, as players had blisters and bruises from playing in them.

*In May 2016, Yonex acted in a way that was ultra vires when criticizing the Taiwan national team players who had violated the dress code. Yonex sent official documents to the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association threatening to sue the national team head coaches if the Association did not provide a reasonable answer.

*During the 2016 Summer Olympics, Yonex provided unfit shoes to non-contract badminton player Tai Tzu-ying. This forced Tai to wear other shoes made by her personal sponsor brand, Victor, without any logo. This event caused a controversy as the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association was going to punish Tai based on Yonex&#x27;s pressing. 

*After the Tai incident, five other badminton players found themselves in the same situation and were punished. For example, Yonex was dissatisfied that badminton player Liao Kuan-hao used his personal sponsor racquet and as a result Yonex asked the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association to fine Liao and force him to be suspended for six months. In August 2016, the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association held a board meeting to resolve the situation. The meeting resulted in three key decisions: no punishment will be enforced on the “player”; to accept the resignation of Chairman Tsai Hung-peng for the controversy; to remove the word “Shoes” and “Racquets” from the contract with Yonex.

<text>Patricia Nixon Cox (born February 21, 1946) is the elder daughter of the 37th United States president Richard Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon, and the sister of Julie Nixon Eisenhower.

She is married to Edward F. Cox and is the mother of Christopher Nixon Cox.

In her father&#x27;s public career, Cox performed a ceremonial role, in contrast to Julie&#x27;s more political involvement. She accompanied him on many campaign stops and, after his inauguration, on state trips around the world.

==Early life==
Nixon was born on February 21, 1946, at Murphy Memorial Hospital in Whittier, California. She grew up in Washington, D.C., attending Horace Mann Elementary and the Sidwell Friends School. Later she attended the Chapin School in Manhattan.

In 1964, she was presented as a debutante to high society at the International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Edward Cox was her civilian escort at the ball.

She briefly attended the now-defunct women&#x27;s college Finch College, then Boston College in Boston, Massachusetts, graduating in 1968 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. At her graduation on June 14, 1968, her father served as a special guest speaker. In 1968, future president George W. Bush took Nixon on a date arranged by his father. After Bush spilled wine and tried to smoke a cigarette, Nixon requested to be taken back to the White House.

In 1969, she hosted a Halloween party for 250 children at the White House. Actor Jonathan Frid who played Barnabas Collins in the Dark Shadows show was in attendance.

==Marriage and professional activities==

Tricia Nixon married Harvard Law student Edward F. Cox in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on June 12, 1971.

In a 2015 interview with Max Foster for CNN regarding an upcoming visit to the United States, Charles, then Prince of Wales, recalled his first visit to the U.S. in 1970 as &quot;the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon&quot; who was nearly three years his senior and American. Nixon had represented the U.S. government along with former Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey at Charles&#x27; investiture in Caernarvon Wales one year earlier in July 1969.

She has lived a very private life in the suburbs of New York, and was a stay-at-home mother to her son, Christopher Nixon Cox, born in March 1979. Her husband is now a corporate attorney and a chairman of the New York Republican State Committee. She serves on the boards of many medical research institutions, as well as the Richard Nixon Foundation at the Nixon Library in California.

<text>Bărbat was the brother and successor of &quot;voivode&quot; Litovoi whose territory had comprised northern Oltenia (Romania).

== War with Hungary ==
In 1277 (or between 1277 and 1280), Litovoi renounced fealty to king Ladislaus IV of Hungary (1272–1290) when the king claimed lands for the crown, but Litovoi refused to pay tribute for them. King Ladislaus IV dispatched a punitive force, and Litovoi was killed during the battle against the Hungarian army. Bărbat was taken prisoner and sent to the royal court where he was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule. After Bărbat accepted Hungarian suzerainty under the duress of circumstances, he returned to his country.

All these events are recounted in the king’s letter of grant of 8 January 1285, in which king Ladislaus IV donated villages in Sáros County (today in Slovakia) to Master George, son of Simon, who had been sent against Litovoi.

<text>Post Consumer Brands, LLC (previously Post Cereals and Postum Cereals; also known as simply &quot;Post&quot;) is an American consumer packaged goods food manufacturer headquartered in Lakeville, Minnesota.

The company, founded in 1895 by C. W. Post, owns a large portfolio of cereal brands that include Bran Flakes, Honey Bunches of Oats, Golden Crisp, Grape-Nuts, Honeycomb, Pebbles, and Waffle Crisp, among others. The company also produces several pet food brands, including Rachael Ray Nutrish, Kibbles &#x27;n Bits, and 9Lives, and markets Peter Pan Peanut Butter.

== History ==

C. W. Post established his company in Battle Creek, Michigan, having lived there since 1891, when he was a patient at a holistic sanitarium operated by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg. Dr. Kellogg, with his brother W. K. Kellogg, had developed a dry corn flake cereal that was part of their patients&#x27; diet. Post&#x27;s first product, introduced in 1895, was not a cereal, however, but a roasted, cereal-based beverage, Postum. Having developed an aversion to coffee during his time in the sanitarium, Post positioned Postum as a healthy alternative. Its advertising slogan, which he coined himself, was, &quot;There&#x27;s a Reason.&quot; Postum&#x27;s main ingredients were naturally caffeine-free wheat grain, bran, and molasses. Initially, Postum had to be brewed like coffee, but in 1911, Post introduced a powdered, instant formulation. This version of the product was manufactured in Battle Creek until it was discontinued in 2007. As of January 2013, Eliza&#x27;s Quest Food had succeeded in returning Postum to many grocery stores across the United States and Canada.

In 1897, Post introduced his first dry cereal, a crunchy blend of wheat and barley, which he called Grape Nuts. His first corn-flake product was introduced as &quot;Elijah&#x27;s Manna&quot; in 1904. Owing to consumer resistance to the (inaccurate) biblical reference that was so great that even Great Britain flatly refused to register the name as a trademark, it was renamed Post Toasties in 1907.

C. W. Post was an astute businessman who believed that advertising and aggressive marketing were the keys to a successful enterprise. Within 10 years of its incorporation, his Postum Cereal Company had more than $10 million in capital and was spending $400,000 a year on advertising, sums which were remarkable for the period. His employees were the highest-paid in his industry and working conditions at the Post factory were exemplary. He even developed a factory town in which he sold homes to his workers at favorable rates.

Postum Cereal Company lost its founder in 1914. C.W. Post underwent an apparently successful appendectomy at the Mayo Clinic, but shortly after returning home to recuperate, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Post had for years suffered from bouts of illness and depression. While his death was without warning, his company was not left rudderless. His daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, had been raised in the business and was familiar with virtually every aspect of its operations. She assumed control of the now $20-million Postum Company and managed its affairs for the next eight years. While she did not oversee major product innovations, she did have a good feel for business and for promoting talented managers. In addition, her second marriage, in 1920, was to Edward F. Hutton, the founder of a brokerage firm on Wall Street.

Gross revenues in 1921 were $17.75 million. In 1922, Hutton took the newly incorporated Postum Cereal Company public by issuing 200,000 common shares. The 1920s was a period in which common stock was still considered highly speculative, and consequently the newly issued shares carried a dividend at the rate of $5.00 per year.

Revenues in 1922 were essentially the same as in 1921, but in 1923, they were $22.25 million and a stock split, in the form of a 100% stock dividend, increased the authorized shares to 400,000. These shares also earned a $3.00 annual cash dividend, representing a 20% increase over the presplit rate. In 1925, with revenues now at $27.4 million, the stock was split once again and the dividend was increased to $4.00 per new share.

=== Major acquisitions ===

Starting in 1925, under the leadership of financier (and at one point, son in-law to the founder), E. F. Hutton as chairman and Colby M. Chester as president, Postum Cereal made the first of a series of corporate acquisitions which would within a few years transform it into the dominant U.S. packaged grocery products manufacturer.

It began late that year with the purchase of the Jell-O Company. Jell-O had been first produced in 1897 by Pearle Bixby Wait, a carpenter from the town of LeRoy in northern New York state. Mr. Wait&#x27;s product was based upon a patent that had been issued to inventor and industrialist Peter Cooper in 1845, but which Cooper had never developed commercially. However, Wait was unsuccessful in marketing Jell-O, and in 1899, he sold the rights to it for $450 to a neighbor, Orator Francis Woodward, who had founded the Genesee Pure Food Company in 1897. Genesee became the Jell-O Company in 1923, the same year it began marketing D-Zerta, a sugar-free gelatin, and a powdered mixture for making ice cream in the kitchen.

In 1926, Postum Cereal acquired Igleheart Brothers, Inc (established in 1856), the makers of Swans Down cake flour, and followed this with the purchase of the Minute Tapioca Company. &quot;Tapioca Superlative&quot; had been invented in 1894 by a Boston woman, Susan Stavers, who made it from tapioca flakes that she ran through her coffee grinder. Later that year, she sold the rights to John Whitman, of Orange, Massachusetts, who changed its name to &quot;Minute Tapioca&quot;. In 1908, he changed the name of his company to that of his product. The &quot;Minute&quot; brand would later become better known for a General Foods innovation introduced in 1949 known as Minute Rice, a brand of parboiled rice.

As a consequence of the Jell-O and Minute Tapioca acquisitions, Postum Cereal&#x27;s revenues in 1926 jumped to $46.9 million. The number of shares stood at 1.375 million, including shares issued to acquire Jell-O and Minute Tapioca. The dividend was increased to $4.70 a year.

The acquisition spree continued in 1927 with the purchase of two similarly named confectionery companies, chocolate-maker Walter Baker (founded in 1765, making it the oldest component of the Postum constituent companies), and coconut-processor Franklin Baker, which had begun early in the 19th century as a flour broker, but whose confectionery products dated from 1895. This was followed by the purchase of Log Cabin Products, the maker of Log Cabin Syrup (first produced in 1887), and of Richard Hellmann, Inc (established in 1913), the producer of Blue Ribbon mayonnaise. And late in the year, Postum Cereal began selling its first coffee product, &quot;Sanka&quot;, by obtaining US marketing rights from Dr Ludwig Roselius of Bremen, Germany. Roselius had developed the decaffeinated coffee in 1906 and began selling it in the US in 1923.

Three more acquisitions followed in 1928. The most important was that of the Cheek-Neel Coffee Company. Its product, Maxwell House, dating from 1892, was a well-known brand in what was still a fragmented US coffee market. Within a few years, however, it was to become the number one brand in America and would retain that position well into the 1980s. Also acquired during 1928 was the La France Manufacturing Company, a maker of starch and other laundry products (this being Postum&#x27;s first venture into nonedibles), and the Calumet Baking Powder Company, the leading maker of this kitchen essential.

Financially, the year culminated on October 1 with the inclusion of Postum, Inc in the newly reformulated Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 common stocks. By year-end, revenues stood at $101 million and the dividend on the five million authorized shares was $5.00 per year, a 25-fold increase since 1922.

=== Purchase of General Foods and renaming ===

By far the most important acquisition of 1929 was of the frozen-food company owned by Clarence Birdseye, called &quot;General Foods Company&quot;. Birdseye (December 9, 1886 - October 7, 1956) was one of the most important entrepreneurs in the history of the food industry. Born in New York City, he became interested in the frozen preservation of food during the course of working as a fur trader in Labrador between 1912 and 1916. By 1923, he had developed a commercially viable process for quick-freezing foods using a belt mechanism, which he patented. In 1924, with backing from three investors, he formed the General Seafoods Company, in Gloucester, Massachusetts, to produce frozen haddock fillets packed in plain cardboard boxes.

The founder&#x27;s daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, was first to become excited about the prospects for the frozen foods business. In 1926, she had put into port at Gloucester on her yacht, &quot;Hussar (IV)&quot;, and was served a luncheon meal which, she learned to her amazement, had been frozen six months before. Although she eventually became the richest woman in America because of her business genius, it took Marjorie Post three years to finally convince Postum&#x27;s management to acquire the company. In a deal arranged by Marjorie, who immediately understood the value of Clarence Birdseye&#x27;s patents, Postum paid $10.75 million for a 51% interest and its partner, Goldman Sachs, paid $12.5 million for the other 49%. Following this acquisition, Postum, Inc changed its name to General Foods Corporation. Goldman sold its share back to General Foods in 1932, apparently at a slight loss.

Shortly after the acquisition, General Foods began test-marketing an expanded line of frozen foods, but the company quickly realized that a packaging process alone would not be sufficient to market frozen products in stores. To be sold, the packages had to be kept frozen while on display, so Birdseye engineers began development of a freezer cabinet designed specifically to hold frozen foods. The cabinet, which first appeared in 1934, required a great deal of space and electricity, which were not readily available in most grocery stores of the period. For those stores which could accommodate them, the payback was immediate. Housewives quickly realized that keeping packages of frozen food in the icebox could mean fresher meals and fewer trips to the market.

The company published a cook book in 1932, the &quot;General Foods Cook Book&quot;, dedicated &quot;To the American homemaker&quot;. Five editions were published between 1932 and 1937. The book includes photographs (among which is &quot;General Foods offers over twenty famous products for your well-stocked pantry shelf&quot;) and a subject index.

== After General Foods ==
Philip Morris Companies acquired General Foods in 1985 and Kraft Inc. in 1988, eventually merging them as Kraft Foods Inc. before the cereal unit was sold to Ralcorp in 2007.

In 2011, Ralcorp announced plans to spin off Post Foods into a separate company. About a quarter of Ralcorp&#x27;s sales in 2010 were generated by its Post Foods unit. The spinoff was completed with an IPO for Post Holdings, Inc. on February 7, 2012.

In 2014, the company acquired Michael Foods. The following year, Post Foods purchased MOM Brands (formerly Malt-O-Meal Co.) creating the third largest breakfast cereal company in the US. At this point, Post Foods rebranded as Post Consumer Brands, and is headquartered in Lakeville, Minnesota.

In July 2017, Post Holdings bought Weetabix Limited (including US subsidiary Barbara&#x27;s) for £1.4 billion. In 2019, the company began combining some of its MOM Brands and Weetabix cereal brands under the Three Sisters Cereal name.

On December 8, 2020, Post Holdings announced that it was acquiring the Peter Pan peanut butter brand from Conagra Brands. The transaction was completed on January 25, 2021. With the acquisition of Peter Pan peanut butter on January 25, 2021, Post created a new group called Animated Brands, with the Peter Pan brand being the founding member. Animated Brands is managed under Post Consumer Brands.

On June 1, 2021, Post announced it acquired the ready-to-eat (&quot;RTE&quot;) cereal business of TreeHouse Foods. The TreeHouse Foods RTE cereal business was added to Post Consumer Brands&#x27; broad portfolio of private label cereal products.

In February 2023, Post Holdings announced its acquisition of pet food brands like 9Lives, Kibbles &#x27;n Bits and Gravy Train. Such acquisition would enable Post&#x27;s entry to the &#x27;pet food category&#x27;. After the completion of this acquisition, Post intends to develop a new pet food category within Post Consumer Brands.

=== Postum advertisements ===

Postum, a coffee substitute made out of roasted grain, was created in 1895. It was popular through the early 20th century, particularly during World War II when coffee was rationed.

Due to its decline in popularity, Post announced its discontinuation in 2007. It was later revived by Eliza&#x27;s Quest Food in 2013.

<text>Jean de Florette () is a 1986 period drama film directed by Claude Berri. It was followed by &quot;Manon des sources&quot;, released the same year. Both are the adaptation of Marcel Pagnol’s 1963 two-part novel &quot;The Water of the Hills&quot;, with the second part also being adapted from Pagnol&#x27;s original 1952 film &quot;Manon of The Spring&quot;. Berri&#x27;s version was the first attempt at adapting the whole saga, including the first part, &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;, which was originally written as a prequel to the novelization of &quot;Manon of The Spring&quot;.

The story takes place in rural Provence in the 1920s, where two local farmers plot to trick a newcomer out of his newly inherited property. The film starred three of France&#x27;s most prominent actors – Gérard Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil, who won a BAFTA and a César award for his performance, and Yves Montand in one of his last roles.

The film was shot back to back with &quot;Manon des sources&quot;, over a period of seven months. At the time the most expensive French film ever made, it was a great commercial and critical success, both domestically and internationally, and was nominated for eight César awards, and 10 BAFTAs. The success of the two films helped promote Provence as a tourist destination.

==Plot ==
The story takes place outside a village in Provence, in the south of France, shortly after the First World War. Ugolin Soubeyran returns from his military service and throws himself into a project to grow carnations on his property in the mountains. His uncle César, referred to as Le Papet, meaning grandfather in the local dialect, is at first skeptical; but is convinced when the flowers get a good price at the market. They decide the project is worthy of expansion, and together they go to see the neighbouring farmer, Pique-Bouffigue, to buy his land. The land in question is apparently dry, but Papet knows of a spring that could solve that problem.

Pique-Bouffigue does not want to sell up, and an altercation breaks out. In the fight, Pique-Bouffigue is killed. After the funeral, Papet and Ugolin plug the spring that could water the land and cover it with cement and earth. Unknown to them, they are seen blocking the spring by a poacher.

The property is inherited by Pique-Bouffigue&#x27;s sister, Florette, who left the area long ago, but she dies very shortly afterwards and the inheritance goes to her son, Jean Cadoret, who is a tax collector and a hunchback. Ugolin, according to local custom, refers to him as Jean de Florette – Florette&#x27;s Jean. To discourage Jean from taking up residence, Ugolin damages the roof of the house.

Jean arrives with his wife, Aimée, and young daughter, Manon. He makes it clear that he has no intention of selling up. He intends to make the farm profitable within two years, breeding rabbits and growing their produce himself. Jean does not know about the nearby blocked spring, only of one that is further, two kilometres away, though still on his land. He is reliant on rainfall to fill a cistern to supply the livestock and irrigate the crops. Ugolin and Papet keep secret from Jean the fact that the area where Jean&#x27;s farm lies rarely gets any rain. Meanwhile, they work to turn the local community against Jean, because the late Pique-Bouffigue has cousins in the village who know about the blocked spring and would tell Jean about it if they became friendly with him.

Jean initially makes progress and earns a small profit from farming rabbits. In the long run, however, getting water proves problematic. Dragging it all the way from the distant spring is a backbreaking task. Jean asks to borrow Ugolin&#x27;s mule, but Ugolin gives vague excuses. When the rain does come, it falls on the surrounding area but not where it is needed. The dusty winds of the sirocco then arrive, bringing the farm near catastrophe. Jean decides to dig a well. 

Ugolin tells Jean that his project is hopeless and that he might be better off selling up. Jean asks how much he could expect to receive for the farm, and Ugolin gives an estimate of around 8,000 francs. However, it turns out that Jean has no intention of selling, but wants to use the value of the property to take out a mortgage. Papet decides that he will himself grant the mortgage, because that way he will either earn the interest or drive Jean away for good. 

From the mortgage money, Jean buys dynamite to finish the well, but in his first blast, he is hit by a flying rock; falls into the cavity, and subsequently dies of his injuries. Ugolin returns with the news to Papet, who asks him why he&#x27;s crying. &quot;It is not me who&#x27;s crying,&quot; he responds, &quot;it&#x27;s my eyes.&quot;

Aimée and Manon cannot remain on the farm, and Papet buys them out. As mother and daughter are packing their belongings, Papet and Ugolin go to where they blocked the spring and remove the plug. Manon follows them, and when she sees what they are doing, she understands and screams. The men hear it, but dismiss the sound as that of a buzzard. Papet performs a mock baptism of his nephew in the water of the spring.

==Cast==
* Yves Montand as César Soubeyran / &quot;Le Papet&quot;: In the local dialect &quot;Papet&quot; is an affectionate term for &quot;grandfather&quot;. César is the proud patriarch of a dying family, and his only known relative is his nephew Ugolin. Eager to restore his family&#x27;s position, he manipulates his nephew to do his bidding. For Yves Montand the filming experience was particularly trying because his wife of thirty-three years, Simone Signoret, died during filming. Montand himself died in 1991, and the two films were among the last of a cinematic career spanning forty-five years. Having grown up in nearby Marseilles, he visited the location before filming started, and endeared himself to the locals.
* Daniel Auteuil as Ugolin: Ugolin is César&#x27;s &quot;rat-faced sub-intelligent nephew&quot;. Somewhat more conscientious than his uncle, he is nevertheless persuaded to carry through with the diabolical plan. Auteuil used a prosthetic nose to make the character uglier. The role represented a great change for Auteuil. He had previously tended to play &quot;smart, funny, urban hipster types&quot;, and the role as Ugolin – which earned him both a BAFTA and a César – was a great step forward in his career.
* Gérard Depardieu as Jean Cadoret / &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;: Jean is a city man with a romantic idea of the countryside, yet obstinate and hard-working. Depardieu was well established as a versatile actor even before this role. Seemingly impervious to the great pressure on the film crew, he earned a reputation on the set for &quot;fooling about, telling jokes, swearing at planes interrupting the shot and never knowing his lines until the camera was rolling&quot;.
* Élisabeth Depardieu (Gérard Dépardieu&#x27;s wife) as Aimée Cadoret: Jean&#x27;s beautiful wife is a former opera singer, who has named her daughter after her favourite role, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;.
* Ernestine Mazurowna as Manon, the daughter of Jean and Aimée.

==Production==
Marcel Pagnol&#x27;s 1952 film &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; was four hours long, and subsequently cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, and led him to retell the story as a novel. The first part of the novel, titled &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called &quot;L&#x27;Eau des collines&quot; (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol&#x27;s book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.

&quot;Jean de Florette&quot; was filmed in and around the Vaucluse department of Provence, where a number of different places have been mentioned as filming locations. La Treille, east of Marseille, in the Bouches-du-Rhône department, was the village where Pagnol had shot the original film. The village is now within the city limits of Marseille and has undergone extensive development since the 1950s, so Berri had to find alternatives. For the village of the story he settled on Mirabeau (65 km to the north), while Jean de Florette&#x27;s house is located in Vaugines, where the church from the film can also be found. The market scenes were filmed in Sommières in the Gard, and the story&#x27;s Les Romarins was in reality Riboux in the Var.

Extensive work was put into creating a genuine and historically correct atmosphere for the film. The facades of the houses of Mirabeau had to be replaced with painted polystyrene, to make them look older, and all electric wires were put underground. Meanwhile, in Vaugines, Berri planted a dozen olive trees twelve months before filming started, and watered them throughout the waiting period, and for the second installment planted 10,000 carnations on the farm.

&quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; were filmed together, over a period of thirty weeks, from May to December 1985. This allowed Berri to show the dramatic seasonal changes of the Provençal landscape. At 120 million French Franc ($17 million), it was at the time the most expensive film project in French history. The long filming period and the constantly increasing cost put a great burden on the actors, many of whom frequently had to return to Paris for television or theatre work. Once completed, the release of the film was a great national event. A special promotional screening before the film&#x27;s official release 27 August 1986, was attended by then Minister of Culture Jack Lang. The musical score is based around the aria Invano Alvaro from Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s 1862 opera &quot;La forza del destino&quot;.

==Reception==
The film was a great success in its native France, where it was seen by over seven million people. It also performed very well internationally; in the United States it grossed nearly $5 million, placing it among the 100 most commercially successful foreign-language films shown there. It became the highest-grossing subtitled film in the United Kingdom with a gross over £1 million.

Critical reception for &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; was almost universally positive. 
Rita Kempley, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, compared the story to the fiction of William Faulkner. Allowing that it could indeed be &quot;a definitive French masterwork&quot;, she reserved judgement until after the premiere of the second part, as &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; was only a &quot;half-movie&quot;, &quot;a long, methodic buildup, a pedantically paced tease&quot;. 
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; commented on Berri&#x27;s exploration of human character, &quot;the relentlessness of human greed, the feeling that the land is so important the human spirit can be sacrificed to it&quot;. Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars.

The staff reviewer for the entertainment magazine &quot;Variety&quot; highlighted – as other reviewers did as well – the cinematography of Bruno Nuytten (an effort that won Nuytten a BAFTA award and a &quot;César&quot; nomination). The reviewer commended Berri particularly for the work done with the small cast, and for his decision to stay true to Pagnol&#x27;s original story. Richard Bernstein, reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote it was &quot;like no other film you&#x27;ve seen in recent years&quot;. He called it an updated, faster-paced version of Pagnol, where the original was still recognisable. The newspaper lists the film among the &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. 
Later reviews show that the film has stood up to the passage of time. Tasha Robinson, reviewing the DVD release of the two films for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; in 2007, called the landscape, as portrayed by Berri and Nuytten, &quot;almost unbearably beautiful&quot;. Grading the films &#x27;A&#x27;, she called them &quot;surprisingly tight and limber&quot; for a four-hour film cycle.

=== Awards ===
Nominated for a total of eight &quot;César&quot; awards in 1987 – including &#x27;Best Film&#x27;, &#x27;Best Director&#x27; and &#x27;Best Cinematography&#x27; – &quot;Jean de Florette&quot; won only one, &#x27;Best Actor&#x27; for Daniel Auteuil. 
At the BAFTA awards the next year it fared better, winning awards for &#x27;Best Actor in a Supporting Role&#x27; (Auteuil), &#x27;Best Cinematography&#x27;, &#x27;Best Film&#x27; and &#x27;Best Adapted Screenplay&#x27;. The film also earned six more nominations, including both Depardieu and Montand in the &#x27;Best Actor&#x27;-category, as well as &#x27;Best Direction&#x27; and &#x27;Best Foreign Language Film&#x27;. 
Amongst other honours for the film were a U.S. National Board of Review award for &#x27;Best Foreign Language Film&#x27;, and a &#x27;Best Foreign Language Film&#x27; nomination at the 1988 Golden Globes. It was also nominated for the Golden Prize at the 15th Moscow International Film Festival.

==Legacy==
&quot;Jean de Florette&quot; and &quot;Manon des Sources&quot; have been interpreted as part of a wider trend in the 1980s of so-called &#x27;heritage cinema&#x27;: period pieces and costume dramas that celebrated the history, culture and landscape of France. It was the official policy of President François Mitterrand, elected in 1981, and particularly his Minister of Culture Jack Lang, to promote these kinds of films through increased funding of the ailing French film industry. Berri&#x27;s pair of films stand as the most prominent example of this effort. It has also been suggested that the treatment given the outsider Jean de Florette by the locals was symbolic of the growing popularity of the anti-immigration movement, led by politicians like Jean-Marie Le Pen.

The two films are often seen, in conjunction with Peter Mayle&#x27;s book &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;, as causing increased interest in, and tourism to, the region of Provence, particularly among the British. The films inspired a vision of the area as a place of rural authenticity, and were followed by an increase in British home ownership in southern France. As late as 2005, the owners of the house belonging to Jean de Florette in the movie were still troubled by tourists trespassing on their property.

&quot;Jean de Florette&quot; served as an inspiration for the 1998 Malayalam–language Indian film &quot;Oru Maravathoor Kanavu&quot;.

Ranked No. 60 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

<text>Thocomerius, also Tihomir, was the father of Basarab, who would become the first independent &quot;voivode&quot; of Wallachia. Many Romanian historians, such as Vlad Georgescu and Marcel Popa, believe that Thocomerius was a &quot;voivode&quot; in Wallachia who succeeded Bărbat, who ruled around 1278; others, such as Tudor Sălăgean, refer to him as a local potentate whose status cannot be specified.

== Name ==
Thocomerius&#x27; name is only known from a diploma issued by King Charles I of Hungary on 26 November 1332. The diploma refers to &quot;the schismatic Basarab, son of Thocomerius, our disloyal Vlach.&quot; (&quot;&quot;Basarab, filium Thocomerii&quot;, &quot;scismaticum, infidelis Olahus Nostris&quot;).&quot;

The Hungarian László Rásonyi derives the name from a Cuman and Tatar name, &quot;Toq-tämir&quot; (&quot;hardened iron&quot;), and refers to a Chingisid prince, &quot;Toktomer&quot;, mentioned in the Russian annals in 1295 as abiding in the Crimea. According to István Vásáry, even if Basarab’s father bore a Turkic name, this person can by no means be identified with a Chingisid prince, because being descended from Genghis Khan was a matter of such significance that no one could, or would have wanted, to conceal it.

<text>The Royal Institute of International Affairs, commonly known as Chatham House, is a British think tank based in London, England. Its stated mission is &quot;to help governments and societies build a sustainably secure, prosperous, and just world&quot;. It is the originator of the Chatham House Rule.

==Overview==
The Royal Institute of International Affairs has its headquarters in central London at 10 St James&#x27;s Square, which is known as Chatham House. It is a Grade I listed 18th-century building that was designed in part by Henry Flitcroft and was occupied by three British prime ministers, including William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, whose name became associated with the house. Canadian philanthropists Lieutenant-Colonel Reuben Wells Leonard and Kate Rowlands Leonard purchased the property in 1923 and then donated the building to the fledgling institute as its headquarters. As a result, the Chatham House name is used as a metonym for the institute as a whole.

Chatham House accepts individual members, as well as members from corporations, academic institutions, and NGOs.

==Chatham House Rule==

Chatham House is the origin of the non-attribution rule known as the Chatham House Rule, which provides that a participant in a meeting may discuss the content of this meeting in the outside world, but may not discuss who attended nor identify what a specific individual said. The Chatham House Rule evolved to facilitate frank and honest discussion on controversial or unpopular issues by speakers who may not have otherwise had the appropriate forum to speak freely. However, most meetings at Chatham House are held on the record rather than under the Chatham House Rule.

==Research and publications==
Chatham House research is structured around five thematic programmes, comprising: environment and society; global economy and finance; global health security; international law; and international security; as well as seven regional programmes, covering Africa, the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Russia and Eurasia, the USA and Americas and the UK in the World launched in 2023.

Chatham House contains the Sustainability Accelerator (formerly Hoffmann Centre for Sustainable Resource Economy), which focuses on the political economy of resource production and consumption.

Chatham House regularly hosts speakers from the UK and international policy and business communities.

Chatham House has produced the policy journal &quot;International Affairs&quot; since 1922, and the &quot;Journal of Cyber Policy&quot; since 2016. It has also published a monthly global affairs magazine, &quot;The World Today&quot;, since 1945.

==History==

=== Origins ===
The Royal Institute of International Affairs originated in a meeting, convened by Lionel Curtis, of the American and British delegates to the Paris Peace Conference on 30 May 1919. Curtis had long been an advocate for the scientific study of international affairs and, following the beneficial exchange of information after the peace conference, argued that the method of expert analysis and debate should be continued when the delegates returned home in the form of international institute.

The British and American delegates formed separate institutes, with the Americans developing the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.

The British Institute of International Affairs, as it was then known, held its inaugural meeting, chaired by Robert Cecil, on 5 July 1920. In this, former Foreign Secretary Edward Grey moved the resolution calling the institute into existence:

&quot;That an Institute be constituted for the study of International Questions, to be called the British Institute of International Affairs.&quot;

These two, along with Arthur J. Balfour and John R. Clynes, became the first Presidents of the institute, with Lionel Curtis and G. M. Gathorne–Hardy appointed joint Honorary Secretaries.

By 1922, as the institute&#x27;s membership grew, there was a need for a larger and more practical space and the Institute acquired, through the gift of Canadian Colonel R. W. Leonard, Chatham House, Number 10 St. James&#x27;s Square, where the institute is still housed.

=== Inter-war years ===
Following its inception, the Institute quickly focused upon Edward Grey&#x27;s resolution, with the 1920s proving an active decade at Chatham House. The journal &quot;International Affairs&quot; was launched in January 1922, allowing for the international circulation of the various reports and discussions which took place within the institute.

After being appointed as Director of Studies, Professor Arnold Toynbee produced the institute&#x27;s annual Survey of International Affairs until his retirement in 1955. While providing a detailed annual overview of international relations, the survey&#x27;s primary role was &#x27;to record current international history&#x27;. The survey continued until 1963 and was well received throughout the Institution, coming to be known as &#x27;the characteristic external expression of Chatham House research: a pioneer in method and a model for scholarship.&#x27;

In 1926, 14 members of Chatham House represented the United Kingdom at the first conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations, a forum dedicated to the discussion of problems and relations between Pacific nations. The IPR served as a platform for the institute to develop a political and commercial awareness of the region, with special focus being placed upon China&#x27;s economic development and international relations.

In the same year the Institute received its royal charter, thereupon being known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs. The Charter set out the aims and objectives of the institute, which were to &quot;advance the sciences of international politics... promote the study and investigation of international questions by means of lectures and discussion... promote the exchange of information, knowledge and thought on international affairs.&quot;

===Further expansion===
The year 1929 marked the next stage in the institute&#x27;s development, with the appointment of a full-time chief executive or director. Ivison Macadam was appointed to the position (Secretary and then Director-General), in which he oversaw the institute&#x27;s rapid expansion with its growing research, organisational and financial needs, a role he occupied until 1955.

Macadam was able to secure funding to expand the physical plant of the Institute by acquiring the freeholds of 6 Duke of York Street, then called York Street (largely through the generosity of Waldorf Astor, John Power, and others) and later 9 St James&#x27;s Square, then the Portland Club, in 1943 (through a donation to cover its purchase by Henry Price), and connect these adjoining properties to the original freehold property of Chatham House at 10 St James Square (with the cost of these connections covered by Astor&#x27;s sons, William, David, and John). Power also donated his leasehold property in Chesham Place to the Institute in 1938. These additional properties provided much needed additional space for the institute&#x27;s activities.

1929 also saw the inception of the institute&#x27;s special study group on the international gold problem. The group, which included leading economists such as John Maynard Keynes, conducted a three-year study into the developing economic issues which the post-war international monetary settlement created. The group&#x27;s research anticipated Britain&#x27;s decision to abandon the gold standard two years later.

Around this time Chatham House became known as the place for leading statesmen and actors in world affairs to visit when in London; notably, Mahatma Gandhi visited the institute on 20 October 1931, in which he delivered a talk on &quot;The Future of India&quot;. The talk was attended by 750 members, making it the institute&#x27;s largest meeting up to that point.

In 1933 Norman Angell, whilst working within the institute&#x27;s Council, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his book &quot;The Great Illusion&quot;, making him the first and only Laureate to be awarded the prize for publishing a book.

Chatham House held the first Commonwealth Relations Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1933. Held roughly every five years, the conference provided a forum for leading politicians, lawyers, academics and others to discuss the implications of recent Imperial Conferences. With various dominion nations seeking to follow individual foreign policy aims, Major-General Sir Neill Malcolm, the chairman of the Council of the institute, emphasised the need for &quot;essential agreement in matters of foreign policy between the various Governments,&quot; with the Commonwealth Relations Conference being the vehicle upon which this cooperation would be achieved and maintained.

=== War years, 1939–1945 ===

====WWII Foreign Press and Research Service====

At the outbreak of the Second World War the institute was decentralised for security reasons, with many of the staff moving to Balliol College, Oxford from Chatham House&#x27;s main buildings in St James&#x27;s Square. There, the Foreign Press and Research Service of the Institute worked closely with the Foreign Office to provide intelligence for and to work closely with the Foreign Office dedicating their research to the war effort under the Chairmanship of Waldorf Astor,

The formal remit of Chatham House for the FPRS at Balliol was:
1. To review the press overseas.
2. To “produce at the request of the Foreign Office, and the Service and other Departments, memoranda giving the historical and political background on any given situation on which information is desired”.
3. “To provide information on special points desired&quot; (in regards to each country). It provided various reports on foreign press, historical and political background of the enemy and various other topics.

Many eminent historians served on the FPRS under Arnold J. Toynbee as its director and with Lionel Curtis (represented the Chairman) at Oxford until 1941 when Ivison Macadam took over from him. There were four deputy directors, Alfred Zimmern, George N. Clark, Herbert J. Patton and Charles K. Webster, and a number of experts in nineteen national divisions.

It was moved to the Foreign Office 1943–46.

====Post-war reconstruction====
The institute also provided many additional services to scholars and the armed forces at its St. James&#x27;s Square home. The Institute reopened formally on 28 October 1943; the session was addressed by the American commanding general of U.S. Army logistics forces in the ETO, then-Maj. Gen. John C. H. Lee, who spent a substantial part of his time working with the Theater G-5 officer (Civil-Military Affairs), MG Ray W. Barker. Research facilities were opened to refugee and allied academics, whilst arrangements were made for both the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Polish Research Centre to relocate to the Institute following the bombing of their premises. In addition, allied officers undertook courses in international affairs at the Institute in an attempt to develop their international and political awareness as well as post-war reconstruction planning.

=== Post-war 20th century ===
Chatham House had been researching potential post-war issues as early as 1939 through the Committee on Reconstruction. Whilst a number of staff returned to the Institute at the end of the war, a proportion of members found themselves joining a range of international organisations, including the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. Combining this with the institute&#x27;s early support of the League of Nations and impact of the gold study on the Bretton Woods system, Chatham House found itself to be a leading actor in international political and economic redevelopment.

In reaction to the changing post-war world, Chatham House embarked on a number of studies relating to Britain and the Commonwealth&#x27;s new political stature, in light of growing calls for decolonisation and the development of the Cold War. A board of studies in race relations was created in 1953, allowing for the close examination of changing attitudes and calls for racial equality throughout the world. The group broke off into an independent charity in 1958, forming the Institute of Race Relations.

Following the Cuban Missile Crisis and Brazilian coup d&#x27;état, the institute developed a growing focus on the Latin American region. Che Guevara, then Cuba&#x27;s Minister of Industry, wrote an analysis of &#x27;The Cuban Economy: Its Past and Present Importance&#x27; in 1964 for &quot;International Affairs&quot;.

Chatham House played a more direct role in the international affairs of the Cold War through the October 1975 Anglo-Soviet round-table, the first in a series of meetings between Chatham House and the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow. As an early example of two-track diplomacy, the meeting sought to develop closer communication and improved relations between Britain and the Soviet Union.

At the start of the 1980s, the Council moved to expand the institute&#x27;s research capabilities in two key emerging areas. The first modern programmes to be created under this initiative were the Energy and Research Programme and the International Economics Programme, formed in 1980 - 1981.

In addition to reshaping its research practices, the institute also sought to strengthen its international network, notably amongst economically prosperous nations. For example, Chatham House&#x27;s Far East programme, created with the intention of improving Anglo-Japanese relations in the long and short term, was bolstered by the support of the Japan 2000 group in 1984.

=== 21st century ===
In 1998, Chatham House launched the Angola Forum. Angola&#x27;s oil reserves, combined with growing international ambition, facilitated Angola&#x27;s quick ascent as an influential African nation. Chatham House said the Angola Forum was intended to create an international platform for &quot;forward looking, policy focused and influential debate and research&quot;. The institute&#x27;s wider Africa Programme was created in 2002, beginning the modern structure of area studies programmes.

In 2005, &quot;Security, Terrorism and the UK&quot; was published.

The Chatham House Prize was launched in 2005, recognising heads of state and organisations that made a significant contribution to international relations during the previous year. Queen Elizabeth II presented the debut award to Ukrainian President Victor Yushchenko.

In January 2013, the Institute announced its Academy for Leadership in International Affairs, offering potential and established world leaders a 12-month fellowship at the institution with the aim of providing &quot;a unique programme of activities and training to develop a new generation of leaders in international affairs.&quot; In November 2014, The Queen formally launched the academy under the title of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth II Academy for Leadership in International Affairs.&quot;

The Institute celebrated its centenary in 2020 with a series of events and initiatives such as the SNF CoLab, the Common Futures Conversations project, and the introduction of a panel of young advisers, plus three Chatham House Centenary Awards for Sir David Attenborough, Melina Abdullah and Greta Thunberg.

In April 2022, Russia designated Chatham House as an &quot;undesirable organisation&quot;.

Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow at Chatham House, leads a project promoting opposition to the Venezuelan government of Nicholas Maduro. After Juan Guaidó failed to replace Maduro as president, Sabatini said &quot;The current strategy on Venezuela hasn&#x27;t worked, so we have to try something else. The Guaidó government was a failure but it did provide a rallying point which no longer exists&quot;.

==== Reports since 2015====
In 2015, several reports were published by Chatham House, including &quot;Nigeria&#x27;s Booming Borders: The Drivers and Consequences of Unrecorded Trade&quot;, which urges formalising trade and driving more sustainable and less volatile growth; &quot;Changing Climate, Changing Diets: Pathways to Lower Meat Consumption&quot; examines a reduction in global meat consumption as critical to keeping global warming below the &quot;danger level&quot; of two degrees Celsius; &quot;Heat, Light and Power for Refugees: Saving Lives, Reducing Costs&quot; examines the reasons why energy provision to displaced people undermines the fundamental humanitarian aims of assistance; and &quot;Towards a New Global Business Model for Antibiotics: Delinking Revenues from Sales&quot; argued for revenues for pharmaceutical companies to be de-linked from sales of antibiotics to avoid their over-use and avert a public health crisis.

In 2016, Chatham House published &quot;Elite Perceptions of the United States in Latin America and the Post-Soviet States&quot;, examining how elites in Latin America and the former Soviet Union view the United States, and providing recommendations on how the US could adjust its policies based on these perceptions.

2017 reports included &quot;The Struggle for Ukraine&quot;, an exploration of, four years after its Euromaidan revolution, Ukraine&#x27;s fight for survival as an independent and viable state; &quot;Chokepoints and Vulnerabilities in Global Food Trade&quot; advocates for policymakers to take immediate action to mitigate the risk of severe disruption at certain ports, maritime straits, and inland transport routes, which could have devastating knock-on effects for global food security; &quot;Collective Action on Corruption in Nigeria: A Social Norms Approach to Connecting Society and Institutions&quot; examines how anti-corruption efforts could be made significantly more effective through new ways of understanding why people engage in the practice; and &quot;America&#x27;s International Role Under Donald Trump&quot; explores the impact of US President Donald Trump&#x27;s personality and style—brash, unpredictable, contradictory and thin-skinned—on his engagement in foreign affairs.

Major reports in 2018 included &quot;Transatlantic Relations: Converging or Diverging?&quot; which argues that the longer-term fundamentals of the transatlantic relationship remain strong,
&quot;Making Concrete Change: Innovation in Low-carbon Cement and Concrete&quot; exploring why significant changes in how cement and concrete are produced and used are urgently needed to achieve deep cuts in emissions in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, and &quot;Artificial Intelligence and International Affairs&quot; arguing the rise of AI must be better managed in the near term in order to mitigate longer term risks and to ensure that AI does not reinforce existing inequalities.

2019 saw three major reports produced. &quot;The UK and Japan&quot; makes the case that a stronger relationship could advance each country&#x27;s ability to address shared global concerns. &quot;Conflict Economies in the Middle East and North Africa&quot; examines the common economic factors that continue to drive conflict in Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. And &quot;Kazakhstan: Tested by Transition&quot; examines if the country can pursue modernisation and reform, and break from its authoritarian past.

In 2020 and 2021, there were reports on &quot;The Business Case for Investment in Nutrition&quot; claiming to be the first of its kind to reveal the hidden costs of malnutrition for business, and the extent to which these costs are recognised and addressed by multinational companies and &quot;Myths and misconceptions in the debate on Russia&quot; which aims to deconstruct sixteen of the most prevalent myths and misconceptions that shape contemporary Western thinking on Russia.

The are involved in building the (wrestling ring) or calling wrestlers () to the ring when it is their turn to fight. They are also entrusted with other roles, both administrative and artistic, in the service of the stable to which they are attached.

Established during the Heian period, the role of was not codified until the Tenmei era. Nicknamed &quot;sumo&#x27;s workhorses&quot; by former Takamiyama, the are required to wear traditional clothing in public and are subject to a strict hierarchy in their organisation.

==History==
The status of did not appear until 1750. Before the appearance of this term to specifically designate the staff responsible for announcing the wrestlers, several different terms were used over time to designate the . During the Heian period, there was a role known as , who was responsible for presenting the wrestlers to the emperor and the nobility who attended the matches. During the Edo period, the role became more codified, the staff responsible for calling the wrestlers inherited the name , meaning &#x27;preceding referees&#x27;. Later came the terms and , both of which also mean &#x27;to announce something&#x27;, to refer more specifically to the personnel announcing the wrestlers. Since in earlier times the would sit down on their heels in the middle of the ring when the wrestlers arrived and call them by name, they inherited another name: , meaning &#x27;squatting referees&#x27;.

Like , new recruits can only begin their career under the age of 19 and must have completed compulsory education. Most enter at 15, and it is not uncommon for most to be wrestlers who have not managed to break through but are keen to stay in professional sumo. They then work up a career ladder roughly based on the ranking system for wrestlers until their retirement at 65. The current ranking system was created in July 1993 and consists of the following nine ranks:

It takes around 15 years for a to be promoted from the bottom of the hierarchy to the rank of . The are promoted only after 30 years of service. are not generally promoted until they have 45 to 50 years of experience. Most of these ranks clearly follow those for the ranking of , or wrestlers, with the exception of the and ranks, which stand for chief and deputy chief, respectively. This system is identical to that applied for . Prior to July 1993, were simply ranked first-class, second-class and so on.

While a earns between 360,000 and 400,000 yen ($2,513, or €2,313 as of November 2023) a month, the average Japanese salary for a salaryman, a young apprentice earns just 14,000 yen ($97, or €89 in November 2023) a month. In the past, lived on tips alone. In the same way that low-ranking wrestlers are deprived of certain freedoms, junior are also forbidden to live anywhere other than in their stable and are not allowed to marry while -ranked are allowed these liberties and have a assigned to them. The tasks that are undue to a depend on his rank, although all are versatile, with the highest ranks appearing at the end of the day and performing tasks that put them in the public eye.

Since October 2019 the position has been vacant after the incumbent, Takuro, from Kasugano stable, was suspended for two tournaments and announced his retirement for hitting a junior over the head after he caught him eating in the customer seating area on . In September 2023, however, it was announced that Jirō (also from Kasugano stable), would be promoted by two ranks to become from December 25 of the same year, when the &quot;banzuke&quot; for the January 2024 tournament will be released. On the same date, the role–vacant since November 2015–will be taken up by Katsuyuki from Shibatayama stable.

==Responsibilities==

During the tournament, are by far the busiest workers, staying for the whole of the fighting days, staying on site from 7:30am to 6pm. These tasks begin before the official opening of the tournaments () with the construction of the (sumo ring).

===Building the ring===

Construction begins five days before the first day of the tournament (). 40 tonnes of a special clay, called Arakida, collected in the town of Kawagoe (Saitama Prefecture) are needed for its construction and the use small trucks to transport the materials. As well as building the ring, the are also responsible for the facing of the (the suspended roof above the ). Supervision of the construction does not necessarily fall to the . Depending on their skills, a may also supervise the construction of the ring. During (tours), not all are present, and it is not uncommon for local volunteers to help with construction.

===Calling the wrestlers===
The &#x27;s most emblematic task is to call the wrestlers into the ring for their match of the day. Dressed traditionally and holding a simple white fan, they call the wrestlers by their , or ring-name, in a high-pitched and melodious way. The use of a fan was originally intended to prevent droplets of saliva from soiling the sacred surface of the . Because of the large number of wrestlers in the divisions, the who enter the ring are notoriously using cheat sheets so as not to make any mistakes in public. On odd-numbered days, the call is made from the east, then the west, and on even-numbered days the call is made in the other way round.

===Other tasks===

Another recognisable task of the is parading the (advertising) banners around the ring before particular match-ups between popular wrestlers, which are often sponsored by companies. The are responsible for banging the drum at different times of the day. Originally, these different times were used to convey different messages to spectators outside the arena. The first drum sound is the , played during the 15 days of the tournaments, for 30 minutes from 8am to announce the opening of a day of matches. At the end of the day, immediately after the (bow-twirling) ceremony, the is played to invite spectators leaving the arena to disperse. Before the Second World War, the took part in the tours separately and by (clan), therefore the method used to beat the drum was different and these variations are traditionally preserved today, even if all now take part in the tours equally. High-ranking finally accompany -ranked wrestlers in their ring-entering ceremonies by sounding their , an instrument consisting of two pieces of cherry wood tied together with a cord.

Other tasks on match days include: sweeping the ring, providing purification salt, handing towels to wrestlers, displaying banners showing that a match has been decided by default (usually due to a competitor&#x27;s withdrawal), or subject to a rematch after the next two bouts, and ensuring that, during a bout, no wrestler injures himself on the bucket of (power water) situated at each east and west side of the ring. The are also responsible for bringing the thick cushions of the -ranked wrestlers to the ring, which are handed to them by the (assistant) who come out of the changing rooms. Junior also help senior during the ceremony. Less publicly, also take care of many small requests made by the Sumo Association executives on judging duty or guard duty in the corridors, such as fetching drinks or cigarettes.

Nevertheless, the responsibility for is not simply confined to tournament days. As , like wrestlers, belong to the stables, they are also entrusted with tasks by their stablemasters, such as running errands or keeping track of wrestlers&#x27; progress during training sessions. When a stable goes on tour in the odd-numbered months, the are also responsible for making the necessary arrangements to reserve accommodation for the masters and wrestlers. When a stable&#x27;s (training area) needs rebuilding, from the same , to which the stable belongs, take charge of the construction. 

It is also traditional for to write folk songs, called , based on sumo life.

==Ring names==
 take a single name as their ring name, unlike both the wrestlers () and who have both a surname and given name. This may be related to the practice of the Edo period in Japan whereby only samurai-class persons could hold a surname. The wrestlers (involved in a martial activity) and (who were lettered) could be construed as having positions consistent with a samurai status, while the did not. As in most traditional Japanese activities, the professional name of the is sometimes derived from the name of the master who taught them, borrowing a kanji from the master&#x27;s name.

As from July 1993 the upper ranked also have their names automatically included on the , the ranking sheet produced prior to each . With the exception of a period around the Kansei era to Bunsei era, only the had traditionally been included on the alongside the wrestlers and their training masters, or .

==Uniform==

The outfit worn by the is loosely based on an old style Japanese workman&#x27;s outfit, with , working trousers, and socks. The kimono worn by the often displays sponsors&#x27; names in black characters and logo. As there are currently eight main sponsors of the Sumo Association, each has eight different kimono which he wears during all 15 days of each basho. The costume is the same for senior and junior ranked and only the kimono worn on the torso varies in color and the names on the back. Since the kimono display the logos and names of the sponsors, it is often offered by them and the rarely choose the colors of their kimono. Their colors and designs, on the other hand, are often decided within an , but it can also be presented by who have been promoted to or as a commemorative gift and the , or ring name, of the said wrestler can be seen at top of the back of the , in place of the name of the stable to which the belongs, which is normally found there.

<doc id="1047424" wikidata="Q2471320" url="?curid=1047424" title="USS Tench">
<text>USS &quot;Tench&quot; (SS/AGSS-417), the lead ship of her class of submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the tench. Her keel was laid down on 1 April 1944 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard. She was launched on 7 July 1944, sponsored by Claudia Alta Johnson, the wife of Rep. Lyndon Baines Johnson, and commissioned on 6 October 1944 with Commander William B. &quot;Barney&quot; Sieglaff in command.

==First War Patrol==

After completing trials and shakedown out of New London, Connecticut, &quot;Tench&quot; departed that port on 20 December for duty in the Pacific. Following brief pauses for training at Key West, Florida, and in the Panama Canal Zone, she reached Pearl Harbor during the latter part of January 1945. An additional training period followed her arrival in Oahu, but only a brief one. On 7 February, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, bound for her first war patrol. After a stop at Saipan for fuel, &quot;Tench&quot; returned to sea in a four submarine wolf pack with , (like &quot;Tench&quot;, also the lead ship of a submarine class), and .

They left Saipan on 27 February and headed for their assigned patrol area which began in the region of the East China Sea southwest of Kyūshū and extended north into the Yellow Sea. On the night of 6 March and 7 March, &quot;Tench&quot; passed through the Colnett Strait south of Yakushima and into the East China Sea. The four submarines rotated patrol, weather-reporting, photographic-reconnaissance, and lifeguard duties. On 18 March, &quot;Tench&quot; received orders to take up lifeguard station off the western coast of Kyūshū during Fifth Fleet carrier air raids on Nagasaki. Just before the noon watch came on duty, the submarine got word of a dye marker sighting (presumably evidence of a downed American aviator) sighted by friendly aircraft in a bay on the coast of Kyūshū near the town of Akune.

Under the protective cover of F6F Hellcat fighters, &quot;Tench&quot; threaded her way cautiously into the shallow waters of the bay. Just after she discovered the &quot;sighting&quot; had been the result of a reflection of a shoal spot, she received a severe fright. Caught in waters too shallow for her to dive, she proceeded almost helplessly on the surface while a large flight of aircraft approached her from astern. Fortunately the planes proved to be additional Fifth Fleet bombers returning from Nagasaki. &quot;Tench&quot; stood offshore and watched while they loosed their remaining bombs on installations near Akune: a railroad bridge, a fuel dump, and a factory.

The remainder of March proved relatively unproductive. In the absence of targets worthy of torpedoes, the submarine contented herself with the destruction of floating mines and with the sinking of two tiny trawlers on 28 March.

Early on 3 April, an enemy bomber forced her to dive, and she ran submerged for the remainder of the day. That evening, she surfaced once again and soon made radar contact with a good-sized target. The fact the enemy ship carried radar, coupled with the appearance of a second target larger than the first, indicated she was some type of warship escorting a merchantman. Darkness and fog dictated a surface attack. &quot;Tench&quot;’s report claims the target, the large cargoman, took one torpedo hit and erupted in a splendid pyrotechnic display. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to confirm the kill.

&quot;Tench&quot;’s first war patrol had begun soon after the invasion of Iwo Jima and continued past the landings on Okinawa. American planners had foreseen the possibility of Japan&#x27;s attempting to strike back at the Allied forces with what remained of the Imperial surface fleet. They therefore stationed a picket line of submarines off Japan to serve as an early warning system. &quot;Tench&quot; received orders to join this patrol line before concluding her war patrol. She was on station off the western coast of the Japanese home islands when the &quot;Yamato&quot; task force sortied on 6 April to contest the Okinawa landings. &quot;Tench&quot; did not make a sighting, since &quot;Yamato&quot; sortied from the Bungo Suido. That station was assigned , which raised the alarm; the picket line was disbanded, and each submarine turned to its own individual mission. In accordance to orders, &quot;Tench&quot; cleared the area for an air-sea rescue sweep of the East China Sea before ending her patrol. On 8 April, she picked up the pilot and radioman from a dive-bomber from and then headed for Guam where she arrived on 14 April.

==Second War Patrol==

Refit completed and her crew rested, &quot;Tench&quot; (now skippered by Tom Baskett) returned to sea early in May for her second war patrol. That patrol took her again to the Japanese homeland, but this time to the Tsugaru Strait between Honshū and Hokkaidō, the northern entrance to the Sea of Japan. Her mission was to interdict Japanese shipping as it attempted to run north and south between the Kuril Islands and Tokyo. Her first contact came on 25 May and proved to be an enemy warship. While patrolling on the surface, she sighted a periscope approaching her out of the fog. She submerged immediately, picked the enemy up on her sound gear, and evaded him successfully. During the waning days of May, she sighted little enemy shipping of consequence though her gun crews dispatched a number of motor luggers, picket boats, steam trawlers, and other small craft to the depths.

On 1 June, however, fortune began to favor the submarine. That evening, she encountered the 861-ton &quot;Mikamisan Maru&quot; hugging the coast of Honshū near Shirlya. &quot;Tench&quot; stalked her quarry until 0700 the next morning when she caught the cargoman about one-half mile (900 m) off shore. In a surface attack, the submarine scored two torpedo hits on &quot;Mikamisan Maru&quot; and sent her to the bottom. Two days later, &quot;Tench&quot; scored a single hit amidships on the 517-ton &quot;Ryujin Maru&quot; which proved sufficient to sink her. For five days, the submarine worked her way back and forth across the strait, dodging enemy patrols and picket boats but without finding suitable targets. Then, on 9 June, she came across the biggest game of her wartime career: the 2857-ton freighter &quot;Kamishika Maru&quot;. &quot;Tench&quot; sank the merchantman in a submerged attack and spent the rest of the day evading spirited and persistent enemy retaliation. The following day, she dispatched an enemy tanker, the 834-ton &quot;Shoei Maru Number Six&quot; in another submerged attack. Again, the Japanese patrol force went after the submarine with everything it had, but failed even to come close.

In fact, &quot;Tench&quot;’s closest call was self-inflicted. On 11 June, she engaged a Japanese destroyer in a night surface attack. After firing a salvo of torpedoes at the enemy from her bow tubes, &quot;Tench&quot; put her rudder hard over to turn and retired rapidly. Just then, the lookouts reported one of her own Mark 14 torpedoes running in a wide circle and on a collision course with &quot;Tench&quot;. Frantic moments of evasive action ensued, but the torpedo hung tenaciously on to its collision course. Once again fortune smiled. The torpedo ran deeply and passed directly under the submarine&#x27;s stern. &quot;Tench&quot; continued her retirement unaware of the results of her attack – in all probability unsuccessful – but heartened by her escape from what had seemed certain destruction. After five more days of hunting enemy shipping during which she encountered and sank a motor trawler with gunfire, &quot;Tench&quot; headed toward Midway Island, her score for the patrol (according to JANAC) four ships for 5,000 tons.

==Third War Patrol==

Following refit, she put to sea on her third and final war patrol. On 29 July, she once again passed through Colnett Strait and entered the East China Sea. On 30 July, she found another motor lugger and punched holes in her with her 40 millimeter gun. She then proceeded to round up the lugger&#x27;s nine-man Korean crew, all of whom had taken to the water at the first hint of trouble. Between 2 August and 4 August, she rode out an East China Sea typhoon and on 6 August, released her prisoners in a small boat near the Korean coast. That afternoon, she headed in toward the harbor on the small island of Osei To, near the western coast of Korea, to conduct a shore bombardment. During that escapade, her guns destroyed four schooners and severely damaged another five, along with a sea truck, a motor trawler, and some warehouses and other dockside installations. &quot;Tench&quot; then shifted north to the Gulf of Bohai, between the Liaodong Peninsula of Manchuria and the Shandong Peninsula of China. Her last encounter of the war occurred on 9 August when she surfaced in fog to torpedo and sink a seagoing tug towing two large barges. While the submarine retired from that attack, two Japanese &quot;Betty&quot; medium bombers dropped a bomb apiece some off her port beam and retired themselves. (These craft were all too small to be recorded by JANAC, and her credited score for the patrol was zero.) That ended her hostile actions. On 15 August, the Japanese Empire capitulated, and hostilities ceased.

&quot;Tench&quot; remained on station until 28 August and then headed for Guam where she arrived on 2 September. After a brief stop at Apra harbor, she headed back toward the United States. Following stops at Pearl Harbor and Balboa, Canal Zone, &quot;Tench&quot; moored at New London, Connecticut, on 6 October 1945 – a year to the day since she had entered commission. In March 1946, she was placed in reserve at New London.

==Post World War II and fate==

Almost four years of idleness ended for &quot;Tench&quot; in October 1950, when she came out of &quot;mothballs&quot; to be converted to a Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) submarine. Over the next three months, she underwent extensive modifications to improve her performance characteristics for submerged operations. In January 1951, the submarine was recommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, with Commander Frederiek N. Russell in command.

&quot;Tench&quot;’s second period of active service lasted just over two decades. For the most part, she conducted routine training operations off the East Coast. Initially, she operated out of Norfolk as a unit of Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6). While so assigned, she made her first deployment to the Mediterranean Sea in January 1952. Upon her return three months later, she resumed her schedule of east coast and Caribbean Sea operations. On the night of 13 January 1955, &quot;Tench&quot; accidentally grounded herself in ten feet of water 1,500 yards due east of the Cape Henry lighthouse, a Navy spokesman said. She got off the sand bar under her own power with the aid of high seas. She was stranded from 2100 hrs. to 2230 hrs. During the summer of 1955, the submarine changed homeports, leaving SubRon 6 behind for duty with SubRon 2, based at New London, Connecticut. In addition to periodic fleet exercises including Operation ICEX during the spring of 1960 in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, &quot;Tench&quot; served as a school ship for the Submarine School located at New London. That employment continued until October 1961 at which time she stood out of New London on her second deployment to the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean from which she returned early in 1962. Another extended period of duty with the Submarine School followed. That assignment was augmented by duty with various aviation and surface units in a series of antisubmarine warfare exercises. On 8 June 1965, &quot;Tench&quot; encountered the 13&#x27; 6&quot; sailboat &quot;Tinkerbelle&quot; and its captain, Robert Manry as he made a historic trans-Atlantic voyage between Falmouth, MA and Falmouth, England. At the time, it was the smallest boat to cross the Atlantic nonstop. Early in April 1966, &quot;Tench&quot; broke that routine once again for a four-month cruise with the Sixth Fleet. This appears to have been her third and last tour of duty in the Mediterranean. Upon completion of the deployment, she returned once again to her New London-based training operations which occupied the submarine for the remainder of her active career.

During the late summer and early fall of 1968, &quot;Tench&quot; took part in a NATO exercise, Operation &quot;Silvertower,&quot; in the eastern Atlantic. During that assignment, she visited ports in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Portugal. The submarine returned to New London on 4 November and began her final 19 months of active service. Near the end of her career, she was given hull classification symbol AGSS-417 (general auxiliary submarine) on 1 October 1969. She was placed in commission, in reserve, at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, later that month; and, on 8 May 1970, &quot;Tench&quot; was placed out of commission. Berthed at Philadelphia, &quot;Tench&quot; remained in reserve until 1973. On 16 August 1973, her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was subsequently scrapped.

&quot;Tench&quot; was awarded three battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Manon des sources (; meaning &quot;Manon of the Spring&quot;) is a 1986 French language period film directed by Claude Berri, as the second part of a diptych with &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;, released the same year.

Both are the adaptation of Marcel Pagnol’s 1963 two-volume novel &quot;The Water of the Hills&quot;, itself an adaptation of his own 1952 film &quot;Manon of the Spring&quot;, which became the novel’s second part.

The two films are ranked No. 60 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010.

==Plot==
Ten years after the events of &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;, Jean’s daughter Manon lives in the Provençal countryside near Les Romarins, the farm that her father once owned. She has taken up residence with an elderly Piedmontese squatter couple who teach her to live off the land, tending to a herd of goats and hunting for birds and rabbits. Ugolin Soubeyran, also called Galinette by his uncle César, has begun a successful business growing carnations at Les Romarins with his uncle, César Soubeyran—also known as Papet—thanks to the water provided by the spring there.

After seeing her bathe nude in the mountains, Ugolin develops an interest in Manon. When he approaches her, she seems disgusted by his vileness and almost certainly by the memory of his involvement in her father&#x27;s downfall. But Ugolin&#x27;s interest in Manon becomes obsessive, culminating in sewing a ribbon from her hair onto his chest. At the same time, Manon becomes interested in Bernard, a handsome and educated schoolteacher recently arrived in the village. 

As a small child, Manon had suffered the loss of her father, who died from a blow to the head while using explosives in an attempt to find a water source. César and Ugolin then bought the farm cheaply from his widow—Manon&#x27;s mother—and unblocked the spring. Manon witnessed this as a child. The two men profited directly from his death. When she overhears two villagers talking about it, Manon realises that many in the village knew of the crime but had remained silent, for the Soubeyran family was locally important. While searching for a goat that fell into a crevice above the village, Manon finds the underground source of the spring that supplies water to the local farms and village. To take her revenge on both the Soubeyrans and the villagers, who knew but did nothing, she stops the flow of water using the iron-oxide clay and rocks found nearby.

The villagers quickly become desperate for water to feed their crops and run their businesses. They come to believe that the water flow had been stopped by some Providence to punish the injustice committed against Jean. Manon publicly accuses César and Ugolin, and the villagers admit their own complicity in the persecution of Jean. They had never accepted him as he was an outsider and was physically deformed. César tries to evade the accusations, but an eyewitness, a poacher who was trespassing on the vacant property at the time, steps forward to confirm the crime, shaming both César and Ugolin. Ugolin makes a desperate attempt to ask Manon for her hand in marriage, but she rejects him. The Soubeyrans flee in disgrace. Rejected by Manon, Ugolin hangs himself from a tree, apparently ending the Soubeyran line.

The villagers appeal to Manon to take part in a religious procession to the village&#x27;s fountain because she is orphaned, hoping that acknowledging the injustice will restore the flow of water to the village. With the assistance of Bernard, Manon unblocks the spring in advance, and the water arrives at the village at the moment that the procession reaches the fountain. Manon marries Bernard.

Meanwhile, César has been broken by his nephew&#x27;s suicide. Delphine, an old acquaintance of his, returns to the village and tells him that Florette, his sweetheart from that period, had written to him to tell him she was carrying their child. Receiving no reply from him, she had tried to abort it. Florette left the village, married a blacksmith from nearby Créspin, and the child was born alive but a hunchback.

César, away on military service in Africa, never received her letter and did not know that she had given birth to his child. In a cruel twist of fate, Jean, the man he drove to desperation and death without having met him, was the son he had always wanted. Realizing now she is related to him, César sadly watches a pregnant Manon hurry home at night, wishing to reconcile with his only grandchild, but knowing it will never happen.

Devastated, and lacking the will to live any longer, César dies quietly in his sleep. In a letter he leaves his property to Manon, whom he recognises as his natural granddaughter and the last of the Soubeyrans.

==Cast==
* Emmanuelle Béart as Manon
* Yves Montand as César Soubeyran/&#x27;Le Papet&#x27;
* Daniel Auteuil as Ugolin
* Hippolyte Girardot as Bernard Olivier
* Margarita Lozano as Baptistine
* Yvonne Gamy as Delphine
* Gabriel Bacquier and Ève Brenner as singers at the wedding

==Production==
The sequence in which Manon bathes naked posed some difficulties. Being modest, Emmanuelle Béart was reluctant to undress in front of the crew. In an effort to resolve the situation, Claude Berri undressed and dived naked into the water to break the ice. As a result, Béart followed suit.
Shooting ran from 22 April 1985 to 27 December 1985.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was a domestic and international success, grossing nearly $4 million in US sales.

===Critical response===
===Awards===
* 1987: César Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role – Emmanuelle Béart
* 1987: National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Language Film (shared with &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;)

<doc id="1047454" wikidata="Q1064030" url="?curid=1047454" title="Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia">
<text>Nicholas Alexander (), (died November 1364) was a Voivode of Wallachia (c. 1352 – November 1364), after having been co-ruler to his father Basarab I.

== Reign ==

In the year 1359, he founded the Eastern Orthodox Metropolis of Ungro-Wallachia.

After initially resisting pressures to become the Kingdom of Hungary&#x27;s vassal, he yielded to King Louis I in 1354, and recognized the right of the Roman Catholic Church to establish missions in his principality, as well as the privilege of Saxon traders from Brașov to transit Wallachia without paying duties. In 1355, Nicolae Alexandru and the King of Hungary reached an agreement in return for Severin.

Nicholas Alexander died in 16 November 1364 and he was buried in Câmpulung. His epitaph reads:
:&quot;In the 16th day of November died the great and sole ruler Io Nicholas Alexander voivode, son of great Basarab, in 6873 indiction 3. Memory eternal.&quot;

== Family ==
Firstly, he married Lady Maria, of the magyar Lackfi family located in &quot;Transylvania&quot;.The couple had two children:
*Prince Voislav ( d. January 1366)
*Princesa Elizabeth of Wallachia (1340– 1369), who married Duke of Opole Vladislaus II and had three daughters.
Through Elizabeth&#x27;s youngest daughter, Katarina of Oppole, Nicolas Alexander become ancestor for all European royal families including Romanian royal family.

His second wife was Clara Dobokai, a Catholic noblewoman from Hungary. The marriage produced three children:
*Princess Ana of Wallachia, the Empress Consort of Bulgaria; married her cousin Tsar Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria and had three children, including the next tsar, Prince Constantine
*Voievode Radu I of Wallachia, succeeded his half brother Vladislav as voievode
*Princess Anna of Wallachia, the Empress Consort of Serbia; married Emperor Stefan Uroš V

The mother of Vladislav I of Wallachia may be Clara Dobokai.

In February 1369, Vladislav I subdued Vidin and recognised Louis I of Hungary as his overlord, in return for Severin, Amlaș and Făgăraș. In 1373, Louis I took Severin again, but Vladislav I recovered it, in 1376–1377.

==Family==

Vladislav I was the son of Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia and Clara Dobokai. It has been suggested that his son was Vlad I of Wallachia.

==Reign==

During his reign, the Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja was split in two parts, as a single bishop did not suffice for the entire country, thus creating the Metropolis of Oltenia. The first monasteries in Wallachia were erected by Nicodemus of Tismana (Vodița Monastery and Tismana Monastery) with the support of the voivode. 

===Relations with the Hungarian Crown===

Louis assembled his armies in Temesvár (now Timișoara in Romania) in February 1365. According to a royal charter that year, he was planning to invade Wallachia because the new voivode, Vladislav I, had refused to obey him. However, he ended up heading a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir, which suggests that Vladislav I had in the meantime yielded to him. Louis seized Vidin and imprisoned Ivan Stratsimir in May or June. In 1366, Louis granted the Banate of Severin and the district of Fogaras to Vladislav Vlaicu of Wallachia, who had accepted his suzerainty. Tvrtko I of Bosnia also accepted Louis&#x27;s suzerainty after Hungarian troops assisted him in regaining his throne in early 1367. In 1368, Vladislav I cooperated with Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria, the father of Ivan Sratsimir of Vidin, against the Hungarians. Their united armies imposed a blockade on Vidin. Louis marched to the Lower Danube and ordered Nicholas Lackfi, Voivode of Transylvania, to invade Wallachia in the autumn of 1368. The voivode&#x27;s army marched through the valley of the Ialomița River, but the Wallachians ambushed it and killed many Hungarian soldiers, including the voivode. However, Louis&#x27; campaign against Wallachia from the west was successful and Vladislav Vlaicu yield to him in next summer. Upon his initiative, Louis restored Ivan Sratsimir in Vidin.

===Coinage===

Vladislav I was the first Wallachian voivode to mint local coins around 1365. The coins were made exclusively from silver and they were classified in 3 categories:

*I - Ducats, with a diameter of 18-21 mm and an average weight of 1,05 grams. There were 3 types of the Wallachian ducats: 
**type I, which had solely Cyrillic inscriptions, featuring on the obverse the inscription and a shield with a cross on top divided into two halves vertically, one being traversed by horizontal stripes and the other featuring a crescent, while on the reverse featuring an eagle with the head tilted to the left sitting on a knightly helmet with a cross to its left; 
**type II, which had both Latin and Cyrillic inscriptions, featuring on the obverse the inscription or and a Jerusalem cross, while on the reverse featuring the inscription or and the same model as type I, but mirrored; 
**type III, which, akin to type II had both Cyrillic and Latin inscriptions, featuring on the obverse the inscription or and a shield divided into two halves vertically, one being traversed by horizontal stripes and the other being blank, while on the reverse featuring the inscription or and the same illustration as type II.
*II - Dinars, with a diameter of 16-18 mm and an average weight of 0,7 grams. They looked the same as type III ducats and also featured the same Cyrillic or Latin inscriptions, however they were smaller and lighter.
*III - Bans, with a diameter of 14-16 mm and an average weight of 0,35 grams. On the obverse, they featured the same imagery as type II and III ducats did on the reverse, with the exception of the inscription, which was , while on the reverse they featured a Jerusalem cross.

<text>The Prudential Tower, also known as the Prudential Building or, colloquially, the Pru, is an international style skyscraper in Boston, Massachusetts. The building, a part of the Prudential Center complex, currently stands as the 2nd-tallest building in Boston, behind the John Hancock Tower. The Prudential Tower was designed by Charles Luckman and Associates for Prudential Insurance. Completed in 1964, the building is tall, with 52 floors, and (as of January 2021) is tied with others as the 114th-tallest in the United States. It contains of commercial and retail space. Including its radio mast, the tower&#x27;s pinnacle height reaches .

== History ==
The Prudential Tower began construction in 1960 with steel erection work by Donovan Steel. Upon its completion in 1964, the Prudential was the tenth tallest building in the world and the tallest building in North America outside of New York City, surpassing the Terminal Tower in Cleveland, Ohio. It also ended the Custom House Tower&#x27;s 59-year reign as the tallest building in Boston, and passed Hartford&#x27;s Travelers Tower as the tallest building in New England.

The newly built Prudential Tower dwarfed John Hancock Financial&#x27;s headquarters building, built in 1947. This spurred the insurance rival to build the 1975 John Hancock Tower, which is slightly taller at .

Today, the Prudential is no longer among the fifty tallest buildings in the U.S. in architectural height, but at , it still stands in that rank based on pinnacle height. Within Boston, in addition to the nearby John Hancock tower, many other tall buildings have since been built such as the Four Seasons Hotel &amp; Private Residences, One Dalton Street at 742 feet and the Millennium Tower in the Downtown Crossing neighborhood at 685 feet. The financial district, including the Federal Reserve Bank is now the 5th tallest at 614 feet. The Prudential, John Hancock and now the Four Seasons Hotel &amp; Private Residences towers dominate the Back Bay skyline.

== Critical reception ==

When it was built, the Prudential Tower received mostly positive architectural reviews. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the showcase of the New Boston [representing] the agony and the ecstasy of a city striving to rise above the sordidness of its recent past&quot;. But Ada Louise Huxtable called it &quot;a flashy 52-story glass and aluminum tower ... part of an over-scaled megalomaniac group shockingly unrelated to the city&#x27;s size, standards, or style. It is a slick developer&#x27;s model dropped into an urban renewal slot in Anycity, U.S.A.—a textbook example of urban character assassination.&quot; Architect Donlyn Lyndon called it &quot;an energetically ugly, square shaft that offends the Boston skyline more than any other structure&quot;. In 1990, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; architecture critic Robert Campbell commented: &quot;The Prudential Center has been the symbol of bad design in Boston for so long that we&#x27;d probably miss it if it disappeared.&quot;

== Ownership ==

The Prudential Center is currently owned by Boston Properties. The building is one of several Prudential Centers built around the United States (such as the tower in Chicago) constructed as capital investments by Prudential Financial (formerly, The Prudential Insurance Company of America). Preceding Prudential Financial&#x27;s demutualization, Prudential sold many of its real estate assets, for instance most of the air rights in Times Square, and the Prudential Center in Boston, to put cash on the corporate balance sheets. The Gillette Company, now a unit of Procter &amp; Gamble, once occupied 40 percent of the space in the structure but has since vacated many of these floors. Boston-based law firm Ropes &amp; Gray moved into much of this space, including the 37th through 49th, in fall 2010. Other major tenants include Wall Street investment firm Home State Corporation, Partners HealthCare, Club Monaco, Exeter Group and Accenture. Boston Properties acquired the building in 1998. However, Prudential Financial&#x27;s then head of global marketing, and Boston native, Michael Hines, suggested that the real estate deal only go through with the condition that Prudential retain the name and signage rights for the Prudential Center and Prudential Tower. Signage rights in Boston are very limited, and Prudential&#x27;s are grandfathered. The other notable backlit signs allowed above include The Colonnade Hotel, Boston, State Street Bank sign, Sheraton sign, and the Boston Citgo sign. Using similar negotiations, Prudential retains two notable signs in Times Square.

==Features and design==
===Lighting===
The tradition of using the window lights to support local sports teams and events began at its inception in 1964 supporting the charity drive for the United Fund, a predecessor of the United Way. The building&#x27;s windows have been illuminated with &quot;GO B&#x27;s&quot; to support the Boston Bruins during the Stanley Cup playoffs and &quot;GO SOX&quot; or a &quot;1&quot; during important World Series and postseason games.

In the 1999, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2018 Major League Baseball playoffs, the building&#x27;s tenants turned on and off their lights to spell out &quot;GO SOX&quot;, providing a visual for Boston Red Sox fans nearby and at Fenway Park. The tower appears in nearly all pictures of deep right field from the left field line, and is prominently featured in most broadcasts from the park.

A normal display of 91 foot tall letters takes over 140 man-hours, covers 18 floors of the building, uses 165 additional window lights, and 260 window block out panels.

On April 22, 2013, the City of Boston requested the lighting of the Prudential Tower with the number &quot;1&quot; in support of The One Fund Boston and those affected by the Boston Marathon bombing. The display was seen on the north side of the building, overlooking Boylston Street, where the tragedy occurred just a week earlier.

Over the past few years, the Prudential Tower has been illuminated through light-emitting diodes (LEDs), that have the capacity to create a glow near the top of the building. The lighting is used for special occasions and charitable events and can support nearly every color, including pink, maroon, red, orange, yellow, gold, green, blue, and purple.

===Prudential Center===

The Prudential Center, situated on , is in the Back Bay neighborhood at 800 Boylston Street and houses the Prudential Center shopping mall in the base. Known to locals as &quot;the Pru,&quot; it is bordered by Belvidere, Dalton, Boylston, and Exeter streets overlooking Huntington Avenue. Before the Prudential development, the site was a switch yard for the Boston and Albany Railroad. By 1965, a part of the negotiations for the Massachusetts Turnpike extension included the construction of the roadway below parts of the Prudential complex. The Prudential still has its own (eastbound only) exit from the turnpike for this reason.

The new skyscraper at 111 Huntington Avenue was completed in 2002, directly across the street from The Colonnade Hotel, at 120 Huntington Avenue. The third tower of the Prudential Center, 101 Huntington Avenue, is, at a mere 25 stories, overshadowed by the other two.

The Hynes Convention Center is connected to the complex, as well as the existing Sheraton Hotel Boston at Copley Place, which combined was considered the first mixed-use development in New England and awarded the Urban Land Institute&#x27;s Best Mixed Use Development Award in 2006. By the fall of 2007, another major development was completed along Boylston Street at the Prudential Center complex: the Mandarin Oriental, Boston hotel. In 2016, 888 Boylston Street, a 17-story LEED Platinum-certified office building, completed the last site of the Prudential Center complex.

The complex has direct indoor connections to two MBTA stops, Prudential and Back Bay. Prudential is on the Huntington Avenue side of the building directly outside the Colonnade Hotel and is the first station on the Green Line E branch after its split from the main line at Copley Square. Back Bay is a stop on the Orange Line and is accessible to the complex via the Copley Place mall, to which it is attached by a walkway over Huntington Avenue. Back Bay is also served by Amtrak, including the Acela high-speed train.

The Prudential Center serves as one of three starting locales for the Boston Duck Tours, a popular tourist attraction in the city.

In November 2016, a Eataly location was opened, replacing the existing food court.

===Observation Desk &amp; Tower Restaurant===
A 50th-floor observation deck has been the highest such location in New England open to the public, as the higher observation deck of the John Hancock Tower has been closed since the September 11 attacks in 2001. On the 52nd floor was the tower restaurant &quot;Top of the Hub wich occupied said floor since December 1965. Scheduled to close permanently on April 18, 2020, the Prudential&#x27;s &quot;Skywalk&quot; was closed until further notice in March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Top of the Hub was also scheduled to permanently close on April 18, 2020, but was closed a month earlier due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In June 2023 the top three floors opened as View Boston, consisting of a 52nd floor enclosed observation deck and gift shop; a 51st floor bar and al fresco observation deck with tables, chairs, and some couches; and a 50th floor bistro requiring reservations.

===Antenna and broadcast tenants===
The main rooftop mast supports two FM master antennas, and a top-mounted television antenna previously used by WBPX. The upper master antenna, manufactured by Electronics Research, Inc. (ERI), serves WZLX 100.7, WWBX 104.1, WMJX 106.7, and WXKS-FM 107.9. The lower master antenna was installed in the late 1990s, also by ERI, and serves WBOS 92.9, WBQT 96.9, and WROR-FM 105.7. The FM stations each transmit with approximately 22,000 watts ERP and in HD Radio. The roof also has a smaller tower with standby antennas for WZLX, WWBX, WROR-FM, WXKS-FM. All 7 FM broadcast tenants have backups located in Newton as well.

The studios of FM station WBCN occupied space on the 50th floor for a period in the 1970s and WEEI (AM 590 and FM 103.3), when it was CBS Radio owned and operated, had its offices and studios on the 44th floor in the second half of the 1960s.

<text>Jules Auguste Muraire (18 December 1883 – 20 September 1946), whose stage name was Raimu, was a French actor. He is most famous for playing César in the &#x27;Marseilles trilogy&#x27; (&quot;Marius&quot;, &quot;Fanny&quot; and &quot;César&quot;).

==Life and career==
Born in Toulon in the Var department, Muraire made his stage debut there in 1899. After coming to the attention of the great music hall star Félix Mayol who was also from Toulon, in 1908 he was given a chance to work as a secondary act in the Paris theatre scene. He worked primarily in comedy. In 1916, writer/director Sacha Guitry gave him significant parts in productions at the Folies Bergère and other major venues. In addition to his appearances on stage, Raimu also developed a successful career in films, sometimes under the name &quot;Jules Raimu&quot;.

He starred in the premiere of André Messager&#x27;s operetta &quot;Coups de roulis&quot; in 1928. The following year, already a leading actor, he gained wide acclaim for his starring role in the stage production of the Marcel Pagnol play &quot;Marius&quot;. Reluctantly, owing to his disappointment with his first film role many years earlier, he agreed to act in Guitry&#x27;s film &quot;Le Blanc et le Noir&quot; and then reprised his &quot;Marius&quot; role on film a year later. By his late forties Raimu had become one of his country&#x27;s most respected actors, and was considered the ultimate actor by Alec Guinness, Marlene Dietrich, Rod Steiger and Orson Welles.

==Family==
He married Esther Metayer (1905-1977) in 1936. He had a daughter, Paulette Brun (1925-1992).

==Death==
Raimu died of a heart attack on 20 September 1946, brought on by complications with anesthesia after a relatively minor leg operation, in the American Hospital of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, while he was asleep.

==Legacy==
He was interred in the cemetery of Toulon, where the Cinéma Raimu Toulon has been named in his honor.

In 1961, the government of France honored him with his image on a postage stamp. A small museum created by his granddaughter Isabelle Nohain exists in the town of Cogolin in the Var department in France.

<doc id="1047463" wikidata="Q748080" url="?curid=1047463" title="Romeo Must Die">
<text>Romeo Must Die is a 2000 American action film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak in his directorial debut, and features fight choreography by Corey Yuen. The film stars Jet Li, Aaliyah (in her film debut), Isaiah Washington, Russell Wong, DMX, and Delroy Lindo. The film marks Aaliyah&#x27;s only film that was released during her lifetime, before she was killed in a plane crash one year later on August 25, 2001. The plot is loosely related to William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, transplanted to contemporary Oakland with Black-American and Chinese-American gangs representing the feuding families.

Frustrated by the lack of originality in Hollywood action films, producer Joel Silver built the film around Hong Kong action films. He cast established Hong Kong actor Jet Li following his role in &quot;Lethal Weapon 4&quot;. R&amp;B singer Aaliyah was cast and sang the soundtrack&#x27;s lead single &quot;Try Again&quot; which topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on March 24, 2000, where it received mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success, grossing $91 million against a production budget of $25 million. The film was considered Li and Aaliyah&#x27;s breakthrough in Hollywood.

==Plot==
Po Sing is the youngest son of Chinese Triad boss Ch&#x27;u Sing, who is accosted by African-Americans in a nightclub owned by Silk in Oakland, California. Po is rescued and admonished by Kai, Ch&#x27;u&#x27;s chief lieutenant. Po leaves the club, but is found murdered the next day by a kid on a bicycle. Han Sing is Po&#x27;s brother and a former cop who has been imprisoned in Hong Kong. Han learns of his brother&#x27;s death and escapes to Oakland to investigate, where Ch&#x27;u is engaged in a joint business venture with Isaak O&#x27;Day, a black real estate developer and gang leader. The two have been acquiring deeds to properties along the waterfront to sell to Vincent Roth, a business magnate who plans to buy a new NFL franchise and build a stadium.

Despite assurances from Ch&#x27;u that their partnership remains intact, Isaak fears retribution following Po&#x27;s death and has his chief lieutenant Mac place security details on his son Colin and his daughter Trish, who refuses to be involved in her father&#x27;s illegal enterprises. In a chance encounter, Han befriends Trish by helping her ditch her assigned security Maurice and then discovers Po called Trish&#x27;s clothing store the day before he was killed. At his brother&#x27;s funeral, Han confronts his estranged father and blames him for failing to protect Po after Han helped them both flee to America to escape Chinese authorities, which resulted in Han&#x27;s imprisonment. Kai informs Han that Po&#x27;s death has been the result of the escalating gang war between the Chinese and African-Americans.

Meanwhile, Colin tells his father that he was supposed to have met Po at the club on the night of his murder to discuss information that could end the war. That night, Colin and his girlfriend are murdered by an unseen assailant. Trish and Han team up and realize that Po wanted to show Colin a list of businesses that were either destroyed or being threatened for failing to sell their properties. The two visit one of the remaining businesses on Po&#x27;s list, but the Chinese owner and his employees have been killed. After killing the Chinese hitmen responsible, Han questions his father, who deflects suspicion by suggesting Isaak may have used outside contractors. Later, Ch&#x27;u is shown ordering the death of several other Triad bosses to acquire their territories. Trish and Han visit the last holdout on Po&#x27;s list: Silk&#x27;s nightclub where Po was last seen.

Han and Trish meet with Silk, but Mac kills him for his deed and abducts the two. At a remote location, Han defeats Mac&#x27;s henchmen led by Maurice and goes to rescue Trish. Ch&#x27;u and Isaak meet with Roth to sell him the deeds for the properties they now control. After Ch&#x27;u takes a multimillion-dollar payment and departs, Isaak refuses his payment, stating that &quot;his compensation&quot; will be in the form of an ownership share of the new franchise. An enraged Mac threatens Isaak to take the deal using Trish as a hostage. He also reveals that the &quot;gang war&quot; was a ruse he and Ch&#x27;u concocted to cover their murder and intimidation of businessmen who refused to sign away their properties and admits to killing Colin. In the ensuing shootout, Isaak is wounded while Roth escapes via helicopter.

==Production==
During the late 1990s, the producer Joel Silver became annoyed that he did not see anything fresh or original in American action films. For inspiration, he turned to Hong Kong action cinema, where Jet Li was an established movie star. In addition to the influence of Hong Kong martial arts films, the production team also introduced a new visual effect technique: the presentation of martial arts fighting in X-ray vision. They initially experimented with it for a single fight scene with Jet Li and tested it in front of an American audience, which gave an overwhelmingly positive response, before using it in more action scenes throughout the film.

The film&#x27;s setting is Oakland, California, but other than a few establishing shots, film production was entirely in Vancouver, British Columbia. Principal photography began on May 3, 1999 and ended on July 23, 1999. Filming locations included Gastown, Grandview–Woodland, Vanier Park, Chinatown, Versatile Pacific Shipyards, and the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden.

According to the documentary &quot;The Slanted Screen&quot;, Han and Trish were supposed to have a kissing scene, which explains the title of Romeo, but this did not test well with an urban audience. Jet Li stated on his personal website that they had filmed both versions of the scene (with kiss and without), and decided to use the latter because it would be &quot;somewhat strange and awkward&quot; for Han to have witnessed his father&#x27;s suicide and then to come out and kiss someone.

==Release==
&quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; debuted at #2 at the U.S. box office behind &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, which had come out a week earlier. The film was produced with a budget of US$25 million. In North America, &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; earned $18,014,503 (2,641 theaters, $6,821 per screen average) in its opening weekend. &quot;Romeo Must Die&quot;″s total North American gross is $55,973,336. The film&#x27;s worldwide box office gross is $91,036,760.

It was released in the United States on DVD on August 1, 2000, and on Blu-ray on August 14, 2012.

==Critical reception==
The film has a 32% approval rating from 94 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator; the critical consensus reads: &quot;In his second Hollywood movie, Jet Li impresses. Unfortunately, when he&#x27;s not on screen, the movie slows to a crawl. Though there&#x27;s some spark between Jet and Aaliyah, there isn&#x27;t any threat of a fire. And as impressive as the action sequences are, some critics feel they are over-edited.&quot;

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the movie &quot;dreary&quot; but said it was bound to be a hit due to its combination of martial arts action and hip hop. Writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Bob Graham likened it to &quot;The Matrix&quot;, describing it as a &quot;cross-cultural kung fu extravaganza&quot; that shines during Li&#x27;s stunts. In his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Rene Rodriguez said the film is &quot;needlessly convoluted&quot; and should not have added special effects on top of Li&#x27;s stunts, which he said makes them seem less impressive because of the artificiality. Roger Ebert rated the film 1.5/4 stars and also criticized the use of computer-generated special effects in a martial arts film, saying that it &quot;misses the point&quot; of having audiences be impressed by realistic stunts. Aaliyah received praise for her role.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;Romeo Must Die: The Album&quot; was released on March 28, 2000 through Blackground/Virgin Records in association with Warner Bros. (who helped co-financed the soundtrack). Composed of hip hop and R&amp;B music, it features contributions from film star Aaliyah, who appears on fours songs and served as one of executive producers on the soundtrack album. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Try Again&quot;, &quot;Come Back in One Piece&quot; and &quot;We At It Again&quot;.

<doc id="1047464" wikidata="Q597429" url="?curid=1047464" title="Radu I of Wallachia">
<text>Radu I (died 1383) was a Voivode of Wallachia ( 1377 – 1383). His year of birth is unattested in primary sources. He was the son of Nicolae Alexandru and half-brother and successor to Vladislav I. He is identified by many historians as the legendary Radu Negru, a mythical voievode of the early medieval state Wallachia, founder of the state&#x27;s institutions and ruler.

== Beginning of reign ==
Radu was the only son of Nicholas Alexander of Wallachia by his second wife, Clara Dobokai. He was co-ruler with his half-brother Vladislav I at least from 1372. He may have started his reign as sole ruler after 9 July 1374 when the last documentary mention of his brother as being alive is dated. Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t any internal documents that could attest his reign. There are a few external mentions of him, primarily documents of the Kingdom of Hungary, a contemporary Italian chronicle, a late pisanie, an inscription on the walls of Curtea de Argeș Cathedral and an important quantity of coins (ducati, dinari and bani) which were emitted by the voievod.

== Conflicts with the Kingdom of Hungary ==
The relations with the Hungarian kingship during his reign remained tense, resulting in armed conflicts. The details of these fights remain unclear. An Italian chronicle &quot;Cronaca Carrarese&quot; tells about an expedition of the Hungarian king Louis the Great between 5 July - 14 August 1377 with the intention of subduing a one &quot;Radano principe di Bulgaria infedele&quot; (Italian), identified with Radu I. These tense relations which preceded the fight are confirmed by the registers of the Venetian Republic where, in the same year, a large order of full-equip armors made by the Wallachian voievod appears. These armors were to be worn by those &quot;armadura da cavali&quot;, 10.000 at number who were defeated in battle against the Hungarian king as pointed out by the Italian chronicle.

It is hard to tell whether the troops of the Wallachian voievod were truly defeated, as from the internal documents of the Kingdom of Hungary which were published in the next period, it appears that the Hungarian king still had the intention of subduing the unfaithful voievod. Thus on 19 November of the same year, the king promised the Saxon traders of Transylvania from Brasov that if Wallachia becomes his possession he reduces the dues. On the contrary, in an order given to the landlord of Orsova in 1382 through which he was obliged to forbid any foreign trader to enter Wallachia with merchandise and to keep guard of the border &quot;day and night&quot; reporting everything that happened, there is no mention of a Hungarian ban of Severin and Orsova appears as border point thus suggesting that the Eastern part of Banat was annexed by the Wallachian voievod Radu I.

Maybe linked to this fact is the strange name given to the voievod in the biography of Sigismund of Luxembourg in which, speaking of Vlad Dracul, it is said that he was the son of &quot;Merzeweydan&quot; (Mircea) and grandson of &quot;Pankraz dem Weisen&quot; (Pankraz the Wise). The name Pankraz (Pancratius) is explained from the deterioration of the name Radu Ban (ban of Severin, title taken after the conquest of the territory). Nevertheless, the Wallachian voievod, in another Hungarian document which is contemporary with the events of 1377, bears the name &quot;Godon&quot; as well strange and unclear.

== Other accomplishments ==
An important event linked to the reign of Radu I is the move of the remains of Saint Filofteia from Tarnovo to Arges, event which happened app. in 1384 when the scene is painted on the walls of the Curtea de Argeș Cathedral that became the guardian of the Saint and whose ctitor was the voievod with his brother and father.
His activity as ctitor of religious establishments makes him one of the most active rulers of Wallachia, building a large number of churches with Tismana, Cozia and Cotmeana being the most important. Also, during his reign the two Catholic cathedrals from Severin (a. 1380)and Arges (9 mai 1381) are built and following the tradition, a Catholic monastery in Targoviste.

Another important and controversial moment of his reign is represented by his, not well supported by evidences, ruling over the smaller of the two Bulgarian states in that moment - the Tsardom of Vidin. At the basis of this theory stands an illegible inscription on the walls of Curtea de Argeș Cathedral in which, some researchers, identified the title „domn singur stăpânitor al Ungrovlahiei, al Vidinului și al oblastiei Vidinului“ (&quot;sole ruler of Ungrovlahia, Vidin and the Oblast of Vidin&quot;). It is true that the relations between the Wallachian rulers Vladislav I and Radu I and the Bulgarian Tsars from Tarnovo and Vidin, Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir were very tensed, the latter being themselves in conflicts for the succession of the paternal throne. Once, Vladislav I managed to annex Vidin, but he later gave it to the rightful ruler. It is possible that the same thing was done by Radu I, although the proofs supporting this theory are insufficient.

== Death and tomb ==
The exact date of his death, as well as his tomb, remain unknown. Archaeological digs carried out in 1920 around the voievodal necropolis (in the grounds of the Curtea de Arges Cathedral), have revealed a rich tomb dating from the end of the 14th century, presumed to be that of Radu I. His attire, jewelry and other accessories show him as a powerful feudal ruler, with all the pomp of the Wallachian court supported by evidence that is Radu I lost tomb.

<text>Spiritual ecology is an emerging field in religion, conservation, and academia that proposes that there is a spiritual facet to all issues related to conservation, environmentalism, and earth stewardship. Proponents of spiritual ecology assert a need for contemporary nature conservation work to include spiritual elements and for contemporary religion and spirituality to include awareness of and engagement in ecological issues.

==Introduction==
Contributors in the field of spiritual ecology contend there are spiritual elements at the root of environmental issues. Those working in the arena of spiritual ecology further suggest that there is a critical need to recognize and address the spiritual dynamics at the root of environmental degradation.

The field is largely emerging through three individual streams of formal study and activity: science and academia, religion and spirituality, and ecological sustainability.

Despite the disparate arenas of study and practice, the principles of spiritual ecology are simple: In order to resolve such environmental issues as depletion of species, global warming, and over-consumption, humanity must examine and reassess our underlying attitudes and beliefs about the earth, and our spiritual responsibilities toward the planet. U.S. advisor on climate change, James Gustave Speth, said: 

Thus, it is argued, ecological renewal and sustainability necessarily depends upon spiritual awareness and an attitude of responsibility. Spiritual ecologists concur that this includes both the recognition of creation as sacred and behaviors that honor that sacredness.

Recent written and spoken contributions of Pope Francis, particularly his May 2015 Encyclical, &quot;Laudato si&#x27;&quot;, as well as unprecedented involvement of faith leaders at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris reflect a growing popularity of this emerging view. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on December 4, 2015, that 

==History==
Spiritual ecologists have identified the Scientific Revolution—beginning the 16th century, and continuing through the Age of Enlightenment to the Industrial Revolution—as contributing to a critical shift in human understanding with reverberating effects on the environment. The radical expansion of collective consciousness into the era of rational science included a collective change from experiencing nature as a living, spiritual presence to a utilitarian means to an end.

During the modern age, reason became valued over faith, tradition, and revelation. Industrialized society replaced agricultural societies and the old ways of relating to seasons and cycles. Furthermore, it is argued that the growing predominance of a global, mechanized and commercialized worldview, a collective sense of the sacred was severed and replaced with an insatiable drive for scientific progress and material prosperity without any sense of limits or responsibility.

Some in spiritual ecology argue that a pervasive patriarchal competitive world-view, and a monotheistic religious orientation towards a transcendent divinity, is largely responsible for destructive attitudes about the earth, body, and the sacred nature of creation. Thus, many identify the wisdom of indigenous cultures, for whom the physical world is still regarded as sacred, as holding a key to our current ecological predicament.

Spiritual ecology is a response to the values and socio-political structures of recent centuries with their trajectory away from intimacy with the earth and its sacred essence. It has been forming and developing as an intellectual and practice-oriented discipline for nearly a century.

Spiritual ecology includes a vast array of people and practices that intertwine spiritual and environmental experience and understanding. Additionally, within the tradition itself resides a deep, developing spiritual vision of a collective human/earth/divine evolution that is expanding consciousness beyond the dualities of human/other, human/earth, heaven/earth, mind/body. This belongs to the contemporary movement that recognizes the unity and interrelationship, or &quot;interbeing&quot;, the interconnectedness of all of that is creation.

Spiritual visionaries carrying this thread include Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925) who founded the spiritual movement of anthroposophy, and described a &quot;co-evolution of spirituality and nature&quot; and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955), a French Jesuit and paleontologist who spoke of a transition in collective awareness toward a consciousness of the divinity within every particle of life, even the most dense mineral. This shift includes the necessary dissolution of divisions between fields of study as mentioned above. &quot;Science, philosophy and religion are bound to converge as they draw nearer to the whole&quot;, said Teilhard.

Thomas Berry (1914–2009), the American Passionist priest known a &#x27;geologian&#x27;, has been one of the most influential figures in this developing movement, with his stress on returning to a sense of wonder and reverence for the natural world. He shared and furthered many of Teilhard de Chardin&#x27;s views, including the understanding that humanity is not at the center of the universe, but integrated into a divine whole with its own evolutionary path. This view compels a re-thinking of the earth/human relationship: &quot;The present urgency is to begin thinking within the context of the whole planet, the integral earth community with all its human and other-than-human components.&quot;

Leaders in Buddhism including the Engaged Buddhism movement, historically identify a need to return to a sense ones innate inborn nature that is part of the Earth. Joanna Macy describes a collective shift – referred to as the &quot;Great Turning&quot; – taking humanity into a new consciousness in which the earth is not experienced as separate. Sufi teacher Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee similarly grounds his spiritual ecology work in the context of a collective evolutionary expansion towards oneness, bringing us all toward an experience of earth and humanity – all life – as interdependent. In the vision and experience of oneness, the term &quot;spiritual ecology&quot; becomes, itself, redundant. What is earth-sustaining is spiritual; that which is spiritual honors a sacred earth.

An important element in the work of these contemporary teachers is the call for humanity&#x27;s full acceptance of responsibility for what we have done – physically and spiritually – to the earth. Only through accepting responsibility will healing and transformation occur.

Including the need for a spiritual response to the environmental crisis, Charles, Prince of Wales in his 2010 book &quot;&quot;, writes: &quot;A specifically mechanistic science has only recently assumed a position of such authority in the world... (and) not only has it prevented us from considering the world philosophically any more, our predominantly mechanistic way of looking at the world has also excluded our spiritual relationship with Nature. Any such concerns get short shrift in the mainstream debate about what we do to the Earth.&quot; Prince Charles, who has promoted environmental awareness since the 1980s, continues: 

In May 2015 Pope Francis&#x27;s Encyclical, &quot;Laudato Si&#x27;: On Care for our Common Home&quot;, endorsed the need for a spiritual and moral response to our environmental crisis, and thus implicitly brings the subject of spiritual ecology to the forefront of our present ecological debate. This encyclical recognizes that &quot;The ecological crisis is essentially a spiritual problem&quot;, in line with the ideas of this developing field. American environmentalist, author, and journalist Bill McKibben who has written extensively on the impact of global warming, says that Pope Francis has &quot;brought the full weight of the spiritual order to bear on the global threat posed by climate change, and in so doing joined its power with the scientific order&quot;.

Scientist, environmentalist, and a leader in sustainable ecology David Suzuki also expresses the importance of including the sacred in addressing the ecological crisis: 

A Catholic nun interviewed by Sarah MacFarland Taylor, author of the 2009 book, &quot;Green Sisters: Spiritual Ecology&quot;, articulates this perspective of unity: &quot;There is no division between planting new fields and prayer.&quot;

==Indigenous wisdom==
Many in the field of spiritual ecology agree that a distinct stream of experience threading throughout history that has at its heart a lived understanding of the principles, values and attitudes of spiritual ecology: indigenous wisdom. The term &quot;indigenous&quot; in this context refers to that which is native, original, and resident to a place, more specifically to societies who share and preserve ways of knowing the world in relationship to the land. For many Native traditions, the earth &quot;is&quot; the central spiritual context. This principle condition reflects an attitude and way of being in the world that is rooted in land and embedded in place. Spiritual ecology directs us to look to revered holders of these traditions in order to understand the source of our current ecological and spiritual crisis and find guidance to move into a state of balance.

Features of many indigenous teachings include life as a continual act of prayer and thanksgiving, knowledge and symbiotic relationship with an animate nature, and being aware of one&#x27;s actions on future generations. Such understanding necessarily implies a mutuality and reciprocity between people, earth and the cosmos.

The above historical trajectory is located predominantly in a Judeo-Christian European context, for it is within this context that humanity experienced the loss of the sacred nature of creation, with its devastating consequences. For example, with colonization, indigenous spiritual ecology was historically replaced by an imposed Western belief that land and the environment are commodities to be used and exploited, with exploitation of natural resources in the name of socio-economic evolution. This perspective &quot;... tended to remove any spiritual value of the land, with regard only given for economic value, and this served to further distance communities from intimate relationships with their environments&quot;, often with &quot;devastating consequences for indigenous people and nature around the world&quot;. Research on early prehistoric human activity in the Quaternary extinction event, shows overhunting megafauna well before European colonization in North America, South America and Australia. While this might cast doubt upon the view of indigenous wisdom and the sacred relationship to land and environment throughout the entirety of human history, it this does not negate the more recent devastating effects as referenced.

Along with the basic principles and behaviors advocated by spiritual ecology, some indigenous traditions hold the same evolutionary view articulated by the Western spiritual teachers listed above. The understanding of humanity evolving toward a state of unity and harmony with the earth after a period of discord and suffering is described in a number of prophecies around the globe. These include the White Buffalo prophecy of the Plains Indians, the prophecy of the Eagle and Condor from the people of the Andes, and the Onondaga prophecies held and retold by Oren Lyons.

==Current trends==
Spiritual ecology is developing largely in three arenas identified above: science and academia, religion and spirituality, and environmental conservation.

===Science and academia===
Among scholars contributing to spiritual ecology, five stand out: Steven Clark Rockefeller, Mary Evelyn Tucker, John Grim, Bron Taylor and Roger S. Gottlieb.

Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim are the co-ordinators of the Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology, an international multi-religious project exploring religious world-views, texts ethics and practices in order to broaden understanding of the complex nature of current environmental concerns.

Steven C. Rockefeller is an author of numerous books about religion and the environment, and is professor emeritus of religion at Middlebury College. He played a leading role in the drafting of the Earth Charter.

Roger S. Gottlieb is a professor of Philosophy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute is author of over 100 articles and 16 books on environmentalism, religious life, contemporary spirituality, political philosophy, ethics, feminism, and the Holocaust.

Bron Taylor at the University of Florida coined the term &quot;Dark Green Religion&quot; to describe a set of beliefs and practices centered on the conviction that nature is sacred.

Other leaders in the field include: Leslie E. Sponsel at the University of Hawaiʻi, Sarah McFarland Taylor at Northwestern University, Mitchell Thomashow at Antioch University New England and the Schumacher College Programs.

Within the field of science, spiritual ecology is emerging in arenas including physics, biology (e.g. Ursula Goodenough), consciousness studies (e.g. Brian Swimme at California Institute of Integral Studies), systems theory (e.g. David Loy), and the Gaia hypothesis, which was first articulated by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis in the 1970s.

Another example is scientist and author Diana Beresford-Kroeger, world recognized expert on how trees chemically affect the environment, who brings together the fields of ethnobotany, horticulture, ecology, and spirituality in relation to the current ecological crisis and stewardship of the natural world. She says, &quot;... the world, the gift of this world is fantastic and phenomenal. The molecular working of the world is extraordinary, the mathematics of the world is extraordinary ... sacred and science go together.&quot;

===Religion and ecology===
Within many faiths, environmentalism is becoming an area of study and advocacy. Pope Francis&#x27;s May 2015 encyclical, Laudato si&#x27;, offered a strong confirmation of spiritual ecology and its principles from within the Catholic Church. Additionally, over 150 leaders from various faiths signed a letter to the UN Climate Summit in Paris 2015 recognizing the earth as &quot;a gift&quot; from God and calling for climate action.

Christian environmentalists emphasize the ecological responsibilities of all Christians as stewards of God&#x27;s earth, while contemporary Muslim religious ecology is inspired by Qur&#x27;anic themes, such as mankind being &quot;khalifa&quot;, or trustee of God on earth (2:30). There is also a Jewish ecological perspective based upon the Bible and Torah, for example the laws of &quot;bal tashchit&quot; (neither to destroy wantonly, nor waste resources unnecessarily). Engaged Buddhism applies Buddhist principles and teachings to social and environmental issues. A collection of Buddhist responses to global warming can be seen at Ecological Buddhism.

In addition to Pope Francis, other world traditions currently seem to include a subset of leaders committed to an ecological perspective. The &quot;Green Patriarch&quot; Bartholomew I, the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, has worked since the late nineties to bring together scientists, environmentalists, religious leaders and policy makers to address the ecological crisis, and says protecting the planet is a &quot;sacred task and a common vocation ... Global warming is a moral crisis and a moral challenge.&quot; The Islamic Foundation For Ecology And Environmental Sciences (IFEES) were one of the sponsors of the International Islamic Climate Change Symposium held in Istanbul in August 2015, which resulted in &quot;The Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change&quot;—a declaration endorsed by religious leaders, noted Islamic scholars and teachers from 20 countries. In October, 2015, 425 rabbis signed &quot;A Rabbinic Letter on the Climate Crisis&quot;, calling for vigorous action to prevent worsening climate disruption and to seek eco-social justice. Hindu scriptures also allude strongly and often to the connection between humans and nature, and these texts form the foundation of the Hindu Declaration on Climate Change, presented at a 2009 meeting of the Parliament of World Religions. Many world faith and religious leaders, such as the 14th Dalai Lama, were present at the 2015 Climate Change Conference, and shared the view that: &quot;Saving the planet is not just a political duty, but also a moral one.&quot; The Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, has also stated, &quot;The environmental emergency that we face is not just a scientific issue, nor is it just a political issue—it is also a moral issue.&quot;

These religious approaches to ecology also have a growing interfaith expression, for example in the Interfaith Center for Sustainable Development where world religious leaders speak out on climate change and sustainability. And at their gathering in Fall 2015, the Parliament of World Religions created a declaration for Interfaith Action on Climate Change, and &quot;brought together more than 10,000 activists, professors, clergy, and global leaders from 73 countries and 50 faiths to confront climate change&quot;.

===Earth-based traditions and earth spirituality===
Care for and respect to earth as sacred—as Mother Earth (Mother Nature)—who provides life and nourishment, is one form of Earth-based spirituality. PaGaian Cosmology is a tradition within such Earth-based spirituality. Glenys Livingstone describes it in her book as 

===Spirituality and ecology===
While religiously-oriented environmentalism is grounded in scripture and theology, there is a movement that articulates the need for an ecological approach founded on spiritual awareness rather than religious belief. The individuals articulating this approach may have a religious background, but their ecological vision comes from their own lived spiritual experience. The difference between this spiritually-oriented ecology and a religious approach to ecology can be seen as analogous to how the Inter-spiritual Movement moves beyond interfaith and interreligious dialogue to focus on the actual experience of spiritual principles and practices. Spiritual ecology similarly explores the importance of this experiential spiritual dimension in relation to the present ecological crisis.

The Engaged Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh speaks of the importance of mindfulness in taking care of our Mother Earth, and how the highest form of prayer is real communion with the Earth. Franciscan friar Richard Rohr emphasizes the need to experience the whole world as a divine incarnation. Sufi mystic Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee directs our attention not just to the suffering of the physical world, but also its interior spiritual self, or anima mundi (world soul). Pir Zia Inayat Khan of the Inayati Sufi Order, regards the current ecological crisis as “a unique and compelling factor in contemporary mysticism,” and that the spiritual answer to the ecological crisis lies in the acknowledgment of the sacredness of nature and of the environment. 

Cultural ecologist and geophilosopher David Abram, who coined the phrase &quot;the more-than-human world&quot; (in order to describe nature as a realm that thoroughly &quot;includes&quot; humankind with all our culture yet also necessarily &quot;exceeds&quot; human creativity and culture) aims the careful language of his writing and speaking toward a reenchantment of matter. He was the first philosopher to call for an attentive reappraisal of &quot;animism&quot; as a uniquely ecological way of perceiving, speaking, and thinking; his writings are now associated with a broad movement, among both academics and environmental activists, often termed the &quot;new animism&quot; 

===Environmental conservation===

The environmental conservation field has been informed, shaped, and led by individuals who have reported profound experiences of nature&#x27;s sacredness and have fought to protect it.

Robin Wall Kimmerer, Professor of Environmental and Forest Biology at the State University of New York, has founded the Center for Native Peoples and the Environment which bridges scientific based study of ecology and the environment with traditional ecological knowledge, which includes spirituality. As she wrote in &quot;BioScience&quot;: 

The World Wide Fund for Nature has developed &quot;Sacred Earth: Faiths for Conservation&quot;, a program to collaborate with spiritual leaders and faith communities from all different spiritual traditions around the world, to face environmental issues including deforestation, pollution, unsustainable extraction, melting glaciers and rising sea levels. The Sacred Earth program works with faith-based leaders and communities, who &quot;best articulate ethical and spiritual ideals around the sacred value of Earth and its diversity, and are committed to protecting it&quot;.

One of the conservation projects developed from the WWF Sacred Earth program is Khoryug, based in the Eastern Himalayas, which is an association of several Tibetan Buddhist monasteries that works on environmental protection of the Himalayan region through apply the values of compassion and interdependence towards the Earth and all living beings that dwell here. Organized under the auspices of the 17th Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje, the Khoryug project resulted in the publication of environmental guidelines for Buddhists and &quot;more than 55 monastery-led projects to address forest degradation, water loss, wildlife trade, waste, pollution and climate change&quot;.

Krishna Kant Shukla, a physicist and musician, is noted for his lectures on &quot;Indian villages as models of sustainable development&quot; and his work in establishing Saha Astitva, a model ecovillage and organic farm in tribal Maharashtra, India.

Women have shown a unique commitment and capacity to protect the earth&#x27;s resources, as illustrated by the lives of Wangari Maathai, founder of Africa&#x27;s Green Belt Movement, which was initially made up of women planting trees; Jane Goodall, innovator of local sustainable programs in Africa, many of which are designed to empower girls and women; and Vandana Shiva, the Indian feminist activist working on a variety of issues including seed saving, protecting small farms in India and protesting agri-business.

Other contemporary inter-disciplinary environmentalists include Wendell Berry, a farmer, poet, and academic living in Kentucky, who fights for small farms and criticizes agri-business; and Satish Kumar, a former Jain monk and founder of Schumacher College, a center for ecological studies.

==Opposing views==
Although the May 2015 Encyclical from Pope Francis brought the importance of the subject spiritual ecology to the fore of mainstream contemporary culture, it is a point of view that is not widely used in the work of mainstream environmentalists and ecologists. Academic research on the subject has also generated some criticism.

Ken Wilber has criticized spiritual ecology, suggesting that &quot;spiritually oriented deep ecologists&quot; fail to acknowledge the transcendent aspect of the divine, or hierarchical cosmologies, and thus exclude an important aspect of spirituality, as well as presenting what Wilber calls a one-dimensional &quot;flat land&quot; ontology in which the sacred in nature is wholly immanent. But Wilber&#x27;s views are also criticized as not including an in-depth understanding of indigenous spirituality.

<text>Ferguson plc (formerly Wolseley plc) was an American-British multinational plumbing and heating products distributor. In August 2024, it merged into Ferguson Enterprises.

The company traced its roots to The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company, founded in 1887. Wolseley plc changed its name to Ferguson plc in March 2017, to reflect the primacy of its operations in the United States. The company continued to trade as Wolseley in the United Kingdom and Canada until 2021 when Wolseley UK was sold to a private equity firm.

==History==
===Wolseley===
The Wolseley business began in 1887 as The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company. Herbert Austin, who had worked on Wolseley&#x27;s shearing machinery development in Melbourne, Australia from 1887, when he was aged just 20, was appointed its manager and received a share of its equity.

Seeking other suitable products, Austin designed his first car in 1896, and for the next four years, continued to develop and improve his designs. Though the board did allow Austin to purchase some machinery to build cars, they decided around 1900, it was unlikely to be a profitable industry. In 1901, Wolseley&#x27;s embryo car business was acquired by Vickers, Sons and Maxim.

The post-war rise of synthetic textiles sharply reduced the demand for wool and the necessary machinery, and in 1960, Wolseley diversified activities, by buying Nu Way Heating. Nu Way Burners was founded in 1932 in Vines Lane, Droitwich Spa, Oil Burner Components was founded by Nu Way in 1959, as a national spares organisation. Out of that grew O.B.C. Limited, and then Wolseley Centers Limited, the major distributor of plumbing and central heating equipment.

In 1965, Wolseley purchased Granville Controls and Yorkshire Heating Supplies. Wolseley continued to expand buying both manufacturing and distribution businesses. In 1982, it entered the market in the United States by acquiring Ferguson Enterprises, a distributor of plumbing supplies with around fifty branches on the East Coast of the United States, for $30.7 million. In 1984, some of the manufacturing businesses were sold, and since that time Wolseley has been mainly a distribution business. Wolseley expanded to Europe by buying French plumbing supplies business Brossette in February 1992. In April 2000, Wolseley sold most of its remaining manufacturing businesses to Cinven for £215 million.

In 2008, during the Great Recession, the company announced 6,000 layoffs.

In July 2011, Saint-Gobain acquired Build Center for £145 million and Brossete for €186-million. Wolseley sold ISB (Importation et Solution Bois) Group to its management in April 2015. Wolseley sold Bois &amp; Matériaux to OpenGate Capital in November 2015.

Following a 2016 restructuring of the UK business (based in Warwick in Warwickshire), most of the trading brands were renamed, and brought under the single brand of &quot;Wolseley&quot;. In Scotland, it was a supplier of plumbing, heating and bathroom products, branded William Wilson.

===Ferguson plc===
Wolseley rebranded as Ferguson effective 31 July 2017, because almost all of its business was in the United States, by its Ferguson Enterprises brand. It continued to use the name Wolseley in the United Kingdom and Canada, for its brand recognition.

In 2017, Ferguson sold its Scandinavian businesses for €1 billion. In 2018, Wolseley UK exited its wholesale business, closed nearly 100 branches and cut about 800 jobs, leaving it with 642 branches. Ferguson also made about $650 million of acquisitions. In January 2021, the company sold Wolseley UK to Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice for £308 million.

In August 2024, the company merged into Ferguson Enterprises.

<doc id="1047485" wikidata="Q5151588" url="?curid=1047485" title="Comet (pyrotechnics)">
<text>A comet is a type of firework star fired into the sky from the ground which leaves a long trail of sparks in its wake as it flies through the air. A low noise effect that is popular in pyro-musicals because comets can be easily synchronized to music given their instantaneous impact. 

A comet may also be a small block attached to the outside of a shell which burns and emits sparks as the shell is rising, leaving a trail in the sky.

Some comets use a matrix composition with small stars embedded in it. The matrix composition burns with little light but ignites the stars, producing the effect.

Some freely-launched comets contain crossette breaks, which explode and break the comet into several pieces to produce a branching effect.

Comets intended for use indoors near an audience, such as at a rock concert, are typically freely-launched projectiles designed to completely consume themselves to reduce the hazard to audience members.

<text>The Federal Reserve Bank Building is the seventh tallest building in Boston, Massachusetts. It is located at Dewey Square, on the convergence of Fort Point and the Financial District neighborhoods. In close proximity to the Boston Harbor, the Fort Point Channel and major intermodal South Station terminal, the building is marked by a distinctive opening near ground level which allows sea breezes to pass through.

==History==

Built for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to replace the 1922 building which now houses the Langham Hotel Boston, the building was completed in 1977 and is 614 feet (187 m) tall with 32 floors. It was designed by Hugh Stubbins of The Stubbins Associates, Inc. and was reportedly one of his favorite buildings. The design stood in contrast to that of the other Reserve Banks, which resembled fortresses. It sometimes referred to as &quot;the washboard&quot; building or &quot;Venetian Blind&quot; building

==Design and features==

The building consists of an office tower and a four-story wing, built between December 1972 and November 1974. The office tower has a glass front and an anodized aluminum exterior, with office floors that rise from a 140-foot bridge and a 600-ton steel truss.

It features an auditorium that is named for Frank E. Morris, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston from 1968 to 1988. It was designed to meet the Bank&#x27;s needs and is also available to the community, offering lunchtime concerts as well.

Gardens are incorporated above street level.

==In popular culture==
In the 2006 Martin Scorsese film &quot;The Departed&quot;, in the scene where Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) gets caught on the roof by undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), the building can be seen in the background.

In 2020, the building appeared in the background of a scene in the second episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; as Picard and Laris beam into Dahj&#x27;s apartment.

&quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; is a squad-based game in which the player issues commands to two fireteams, Alpha and Bravo. Each fireteam has a Team Leader equipped with an M4 carbine. The Team Leaders also carry a GPS receiver, which can be used to locate mission objectives and enemy locations, and a radio for communication with headquarters. The second team member is the Automatic Rifleman, equipped with an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, used to lay suppressive fire on the enemy and assigned to take command if the team leader is shot. The third team member is the Grenadier, equipped with an M4 with an M203 grenade launcher attachment. The last team member is the Rifleman, equipped with an M4 carbine. If a member of the team is wounded, another member of the team will carry them. Lieutenant Phillips is the team commander and the player will usually find him with the CASEVACs, which are healing and ammunition points. Each fireteam has a limited amount of fragmentation and smoke grenades, in addition to the M203 grenades. Occasionally throughout the game, there will be a third asset designated as Charlie Team, ranging from anti-armor engineers to US Army Rangers.

Throughout the game, the player does not directly control any of the fireteam members; instead, orders are given using a cursor that projects onto the environment, letting the player tell his/her soldiers to hold a position and set a specific zone to cover with fire. It is also possible to order them to lay down suppressive fire on a given zone to cover the second squad&#x27;s movement, or to reduce incoming fire.

Gameplay revolves around the concept of fire and movement, with one team providing suppressive fire while the other moves. The basic gameplay mechanics remain the same for the retail version of &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot;, which was released on the Xbox, PlayStation 2 and Windows platforms. The retail version places much more emphasis on aesthetics; it possesses substantially improved graphics and sound. Cut scenes and voice acting are also characteristics that distinguish the retail version from the military version.

===Multiplayer===
&quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; includes a cooperative mode that was designed to take advantage of Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Live online gaming service through the use of voice communication. In co-op mode, two players are in command of their own fireteam and must work together to accomplish the goals of the level.

==Plot==
Background story
A dramatic wave of terrorist attacks sweeps Europe and Southeast Asia, particularly targeting US and UK interests. After months of intense searching, US intelligence has tracked the source of the attacks to the tiny fictional nation of Zekistan in Central Asia.

U.S.-led operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have forced rebels and loyalists to flee, seeking refuge in the nation of Zekistan by invitation of the nation&#x27;s dictator, Mohammad Jabbour Al-Afad. His tyrannical regime houses death camps and training centers for the terrorist networks, and promotes cleansing of the ethnic Zeki population. After several failed diplomatic solutions and repeated warning by the UN, NATO votes to invade Zekistan to remove Al-Afad from power.

Pakistan grants US access through its airspace, and the invasion begins. The and launch aircraft to airstrike Al-Afad&#x27;s air, armor, and bases across the nation. When the dust settles, infantry and armor from seven different NATO countries begin to land at southern Zekistan. Under the cover of darkness, the U.S.-led forces converge on the capital city of Zafarra.

Campaign storyline
The story starts at the MOUT (if the player chooses to play the tutorial) in Fort Benning, as fireteams Alpha and Bravo of squad Charlie 90, B Company, 159th Light Infantry goes through the training at Fort Benning, Georgia as they prepare for their deployment to Zekistan as part of the NATO Invasion force sent to invade the country. When they arrived Zekistan, their first objective is to help secure the airfield, the main airport in the city, but the route to the airport is crawling with resistance; the first few hours after they arrived, they were ambushed.

After the Airport is successfully captured, Charlie 90 is tasked with infiltrating Al-Afad&#x27;s palace and eliminating him. They trek through the city and make it to the palace. While they manage to capture one of Afad&#x27;s top lieutenants, Afad escapes. The members of Charlie 90 also witness one of the Joint STARS planes crashing into the city. The squad is then ordered to rescue the crew of the downed plane before they can be captured by Afad&#x27;s men.

Charlie 90 secures the crash site, but the crew of the plane is taken hostage by Afad&#x27;s men. Charlie 90, with the assistance of two Ranger snipers, finds and rescues the crew. Charlie 90 then track Afad down and find his SUV in an old train yard. Charlie 90 must then call in an airstrike on the SUV before it escapes. If the player orders the strike in time, U.S. gunships swoop down and destroy the SUV, eliminating Al-Afad.

Epilogue missions
Despite the death of Al-Afad, propaganda broadcasts were made by a surviving group of Al-Afad soldiers called the Black Wind Brigade, headed by one of Al-Afad&#x27;s sons Al-Hamal. As a way of repaying the Army Rangers from Mike 25 a debt for saving them in a parking lot, both Alpha and Bravo team from Charlie 90 were &quot;on loan&quot; to them to participate in unofficial assignments. In the first mission, both teams were to mark a radio tower for an airstrike to end the propaganda broadcasts. On the second epilogue mission, both fireteams, with assistance from Staff Sergeant Hackett, were sent to a mosque to take out the Black Wind Brigade. Although Al-Hamal is killed by an airstrike during a firefight, the younger brother, Colonel Samir who was presumed to be dead assumes the role as ruler, willing to work towards democracy and stray away from his father and brother&#x27;s tyrannical regime.

These missions were released as DLC for the Xbox version and are included in the PC and PS2 versions by default and unlocked from the start, but the game still goes to credits after the last &quot;Normal&quot; mission and the player must manually start them from the level select.

==Development==
In 2000, the U.S. Army&#x27;s Science &amp; Technology community was curious to learn if commercial gaming platforms could be leveraged for training. Recognizing that a high percentage of incoming recruits had grown up using entertainment software products, there was interest in determining whether software game techniques and technology could complement and enhance established training methods.

Having established a U.S. Army University Affiliated Research Center (the Institute for Creative Technologies – ICT) in 1999 for the purpose of advancing virtual simulation technology, work began in May 2000 on a project entitled &quot;C4&quot; under ICT Creative Director James Korris with industry partners Sony Imageworks and their teammate, Pandemic Studios, represented by co-founders Josh Resnick and Andrew Goldman.

At the time, there was a great deal of interest in leveraging the stability, low cost and computational/rendering power of the new generation of game consoles, chiefly Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox, for training applications. Legal restrictions on the PlayStation (using the platform for a military purpose) combined with the default Xbox configuration &quot;persistence&quot; (i.e. missions recorded on the embedded hard drive for after-action review) led to the final selection of the Xbox platform for development.

A commercial release of the game was required for Xbox platform access. The team, however, quickly concluded that a viable entertainment title might differ from a valid training tool. The exaggerated physics of entertainment software titles, it was believed, could produce a negative training effect in the Soldier audience. Accordingly, the team developed two versions of the game. The Army version was accessible through a static unlock code; the entertainment version played normally.

The most radical decision in the game&#x27;s development was to limit first-person actions to issuing orders and directions to virtual Fire Teams and Squad members (see Gameplay). Given the popularity of the first-person shooter genre, it was assumed that all tactical-level military gameplay necessarily involved individual combat action. The application defied conventional wisdom, winning both awards and commercial acceptance. The game&#x27;s working title evolved to &quot;C-Force&quot; (2001) and ultimately &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; (2003).

As work progressed on &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot;, ICT developed another real-time tactical decision-making game with Quicksilver Software entitled &quot;Full Spectrum Command&quot; for the US Army&#x27;s Infantry Captains Career Course, with the first-person perspective of a Company Commander. As the application was designed to play on a desktop PC (unlike the Xbox), no commercial release was necessary. &quot;Full Spectrum Command&quot; gave rise to a sequel developed for the US Army and Singapore Armed Forces (version 1.5). A related ICT/Quicksilver title, &quot;Full Spectrum Leader&quot;, simulates the first person perspective of a Platoon Leader.

&quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; relates to the Army&#x27;s program of training soldiers to be flexible and adaptable to a broad range of operational scenarios.

The game&#x27;s budget was $5 million.

==Reception==
At the Game Critics Awards of E3 2003, &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; was awarded &quot;Best Original Game&quot; and &quot;Best Simulation Game&quot;. The staff of &quot;X-Play&quot; nominated &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; for their 2004 &quot;Best Strategy Game&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;&quot;. It was also a runner-up for &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot;″s 2004 &quot;Best Interface&quot; award, and for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Most Innovative Game&quot; prize. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; for &quot;Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Computer Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;.

The Xbox and PC versions received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. According to The NPD Group, &quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; sold roughly 190,000 units on the Xbox by the end of its debut month. Analyst Michael Pachter described this as a commercial success.

The game sold nearly 1 million copies for Xbox and PC.

&quot;Full Spectrum Warrior&quot; became the subject of some controversy shortly after it was released. The two primary complaints aired were that the United States Army was not using their training version of the game because it was not &quot;realistic enough&quot;. Secondly, the United States Army had been short-changed. There was some discussion in the press regarding whether the government had either wasted money on the project, or if they had been taken advantage of by Pandemic Studios, and Sony Pictures Imageworks, their partner on the project.

<doc id="1047514" wikidata="Q6985373" url="?curid=1047514" title="Necare">
<text>Necare was an American death-doom metal band, from Newport News, Virginia, United States. It was composed by only two members: Ryan Henry, or R.H., (guitar, bass, keyboards and vocals) and Jonathan Greer Cawthon, or G.C., (drums, guitar and keyboards). The group uses both death grunts and clean vocals and sporadically uses violin and other elements in its songs, considered mournful and bleak.

==History==

Necare was created in 1999. It was composed of only two members, who present themselves by their initial letters (R.H. and G.C.), but counted on the contribution of many guest musicians. The band has never played live; it was a studio band. The name of the band is a Latin verb meaning &quot;to kill&quot;, &quot;to murder&quot;, or &quot;to destroy&quot;. The band project is to discuss about death and the crisis of mankind and religions, which can no longer convincingly explain tragedy of life. It was influenced specially by English doom metal bands, such as Anathema and My Dying Bride and other metal bands, such as Iron Maiden and Chuck Schuldiner. Their lyrics where influenced by the singer Aaron Stainthorpe and some English and American poets, such as Algernon Charles Swinburne, Alfred Tennyson, Wilfred Owen and Sylvia Plath.

Before forming Necare, Ryan Henry and Greer Cawthon played together in another band. However, dissatisfied with the project of the band, they came out and created Necare. In the same year the band was created, Necare recorded a demo album, named &quot;Ophelia&quot;. This album counted with the participation of two guest musicians: April Leightty (violin) and Erin Vernon (vocals). However, it was never released.

One year later, Necare recorded its second independent album, &quot;Rite of Shrouds&quot;. In 2001, the band recorded another independent album, its third, &quot;Appassionata&quot;. There were five guest musicians playing in this album: Andy Henson (guitar), Erin Vernon (vocals), Amy Caroline Parker (vocals), April Leightty (violin) and Ben Snider (violin).

In 2004, Necare recorded its fourth album on Firebox Records, named &quot;Ruin&quot;. Produced by Jhon Ackerman, the recording process took about one year to get finished. The album counts with two guest musicians: Jhon Ackerman (guitar) and Laura (violin); all the other instruments were played by the band&#x27;s own members. Its songs criticise religion and its failure in explaining mortality. They also try to balance distortions and melancholy with long and slow songs.

Despite all the work together, Necare&#x27;s members were always involved in other musical projects. The band officially disbanded in 2004 when Ryan Henry moved on to his funeral-doom metal band Reclusiam. That same year, he was also invited to compose, as a guest musician, the Swedish Gothic-doom metal band Draconian.

<doc id="1047519" wikidata="Q1171190" url="?curid=1047519" title="Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure">
<text>is a Japanese anime series animated by AIC and created by Masaki Kajishima, best known for the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; franchise. It was originally broadcast on Wowow from April to July 1999 and was licensed in the US by Pioneer LDC, later known as Geneon. In addition to the original TV run, an OVA special was added to conclude the series as a de facto &quot;14th episode&quot;.

The title refers to the fact that the story takes place in two parallel universes, a concept loosely based on multiverse theory.

==Plot==
22 years ago, a huge alien artifact is found on a construction site by a worker named Yotsuga. The foreman orders that the artifact be broken apart to avoid delays. As Yotsuga walks towards the dumpsters to dispose of a small piece of the artifact, the world splits into two. In one world, Yotsuga tosses away the piece and the artifact is destroyed. In the other world, Yotsuga keeps the artifact, leading to the discovery of extraterrestrial technology that changes history.

In the present, Kazuki Yotsuga is a high school student who is shunned by other students as an otaku; his web site describes battles between giant robots that only he can see, but it is mostly as a result of him being occasionally seen by the other students reacting to their &quot;presence&quot;. One day, the most popular girl in school, Mitsuki Sanada, approaches him to tell him that she likes his stories. This is only a ruse; she lures him to her father, Dr. Ken Sanada, who wishes to study Kazuki for his research on parallel worlds.

After being thrown into the other possible world by Dr. Sanada&#x27;s device (thanks to a careless action by Mitsuki), Kazuki finds himself still in Dr. Sanada&#x27;s basement, but everything is covered with cobwebs. Kazuki goes home, is distracted by a real battle between two giant robots, one white and the other black. The white robot is knocked down and an injured female figure emerges from inside. When Kazuki goes to her aid, he is trapped inside the robot and somehow manages to activate it and defeat the enemy robot. Afterwards, Kazuki reaches his home, but his parents no longer recognize him. He is found by Mitsuki, who has followed him. Along with a military escort, she takes him to the Earth Defense Force HQ, a paramilitary operation led by this world&#x27;s Dr. Sanada. After Kazuki learns of this world&#x27;s situation and the attempted conquest of this world by this world&#x27;s Dr. Rara (Dr. Sanada&#x27;s arch-rival) who is using technology developed from the artifact, he volunteers to become a giant robot pilot.

Over the course of the series, Kazuki manages to attract several very different women without even trying, and he becomes a hero. He is later taken prisoner by Dr. Rara, the father of this world&#x27;s Mitsuki. Mitsuki Rara eventually defects and comes to live with Kazuki and her counterpart. Later on, a new type of robot made from the artifact is deployed that can cause objects and people to be shifted between the alternate worlds. During the battle against it, Kazuki and Mitsuki Sanada are sent back to their original world, and they discover their world&#x27;s Dr. Sanada covered up their disappearance by claiming that they had eloped. As it turns out, the frequent travel between worlds is taking a toll on the universe itself as the barriers separating them begin to break down; this will eventually lead to both worlds vanishing. A decision must be made; since Kazuki and the alien technology are exclusive to each world, one must be eliminated to halt the destruction. The robots are destroyed, and the worlds combine into one, an expression of Kazuki&#x27;s wish for all his (girl)friends to continue to stay together with him (even though the action is again caused by Mitsuki&#x27;s carelessness).

Masaki Kajishima, confirmed that &quot;DUAL!&quot; is in fact set in the distant past of the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; universe.

==Characters==


:Kazuki is the main character of the series: a shy, quiet and awkward everyman, who possesses incredible fighting power and illogical charisma. As such, he attracts a bevy of beautiful women. Kazuki is regarded as a pariah by his classmates because he periodically has visions of giant robots battling in the city. After being accidentally sent to the parallel world by Ken and Mitsuki Sanada, Kazuki discovers that he is the only male that can control the mechas. Because of his unbelievable piloting skill, he is commissioned to the Earth Defense Force, or simply the EDF, and becomes the new pilot of the white Core Robot. His cover story at school is that he is Mitsuki&#x27;s little brother, which gives Kazuki quite a bit of trouble.

:Curiously, there is no alternative version of Kazuki Yotsuga in this world. Later in the series, Kazuki subconsciously awakens one of the original alien mechas, a robot named Zinv. It is revealed that Zinv is Kazuki&#x27;s counterpart in the parallel world.

:When Zinv is destroyed, Kazuki&#x27;s desire for the group to stay together results in the creation of a third possible world, where elements from the parallel universes are combined.


:Mitsuki is the most admired girl in Kazuki&#x27;s school; young men constantly send her gifts and cards, and Kazuki is nearly lynched for speaking to her. She lures Kazuki to her house for her father&#x27;s experiments, and later follows him into the parallel world (for some reason arriving a month before he does). She is the daughter of both Ken Sanada and Ayuko Sanada in this world; however, she is in no way related to the Ken Sanada from the parallel world.

:Mitsuki is also an exceptional robot pilot, and joins the EDF to end the war, hoping research to send her home can begin afterwards. Unfortunately, Mitsuki is hotheaded and easily manipulated, and is captured by the Rara Army towards the end of the series and coerced into piloting the complete version of HIMC.

:She clearly has an attraction to Kazuki, but covers it up by treating him abrasively. When Kazuki is lost behind enemy lines, Mitsuki is affected most of all.


:D is a bioroid, an artificially constructed biological/mechanical being first introduced in the &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; universe. The war between the Earth Defense Force and the Rara Army began when D and at least two mechas were discovered in an artifact of unknown origin. Her original body was damaged, so a bioroid was built to contain her essence (represented by a glowing orb in place of an eye) while her body healed.

:D appears to be as inhuman as the robot she pilots, speaking mechanically and asking many questions about human emotions and behavior. The only one to break through her stony exterior is Kazuki, to the shock of Commander Sanada and Mitsuki. D frequently has visions of a horrible creature attacking, and is deathly afraid of HIMC.

:She develops a strong attachment to Kazuki, culminating in her decision to return to her real body at the climax of the series in order to save him, at which she came to the realization that she was in love with Kazuki, a new feeling she had not experienced or understood before. It is then revealed that D stole Zinv and fled her world to escape HIMC and Kumu, who claimed the lives of her friends.

:As a robot pilot, D is subpar, often requiring rescue by Kazuki and Mitsuki. However, she redeems herself by removing the limiter placed upon Zinv, allowing its true power to manifest itself.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, D becomes Dee Sanada, taking on the animated personality of a young girl.

:There is also an apparent resemblance between D and &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; character Neju na Melmas, leading some to believe that she and D may belong to the same race. The character of D also resembles the character Doll from &quot;Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar&quot;. D will appear in the &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; OVA sequel &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP Paradise Shidō-hen&quot;.


:Yayoi is the original pilot of the white Core Robot, which Kazuki named &quot;Hartzenen&quot;. After suffering a serious head injury in battle, Yayoi experienced a feedback loop, effectively cutting off her connection to robots and ending her career as a pilot. Kazuki climbed into Hartzenen and took control, saving Yayoi&#x27;s life. She refers to Kazuki as &quot;her prince&quot;, and falls in love with him.

:Yayoi goes to great lengths to spend time with Kazuki, signing up to be his combat instructor and school homeroom teacher, and even moving in next door to the Sanada home and building a passageway and door into Kazuki&#x27;s room (immediately boarded up by Mitsuki). Her grandmother once tried to arrange a marriage for Yayoi to another man (due in part to Mitsuki Sanada&#x27;s meddling), but her affection for Kazuki was too deep for her to even pay attention to the would-be suitor.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Yayoi is Kazuki&#x27;s homeroom teacher, still living next door and usually entering the Sanada house through Kazuki&#x27;s window (as a short cut), to Mitsuki (Sanada)&#x27;s annoyance.


:The Earth Defense Force knows her as &quot;Miss Ra&quot;, the Rara Army&#x27;s spokeswoman/mascot, but when Kazuki is injured and trapped behind enemy lines, it is revealed that she is Mitsuki Sanada&#x27;s counterpart in the parallel world, the daughter of Hiroshi Rara and Ayuko Rara.

:Mitsuki Rara could very well be Mitsuki Sanada&#x27;s direct opposite. She is quiet, easily embarrassed and gentle; she personally nurses Kazuki back to health. However, she places herself in a trance to play Miss Ra, becoming a ruthless warrior. When she finds out that Kazuki is an enemy pilot, she launches him away in an escape pod, remembering the time he could have killed Miss Ra, but saved her instead.

:Mitsuki is later brainwashed into piloting HIMC, one of the most powerful robots created. After Kazuki saves her, she resists returning home, eventually becoming a Core Robot pilot for the EDF. She comes the closest to capturing Kazuki&#x27;s heart; the two almost go out on a date, which is unfortunately cancelled by U.N. officers intent on sending her home.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Mitsuki lives with her parents right next door to the Sanada home, but has a habit of sneaking in Kazuki&#x27;s window via sleepwalking and spending most of her time in the Sanada home.


:Ken has A and B versions: the eccentric scientist from our world, and the parallel world&#x27;s commander of the Earth Defense Force. Ken is Mitsuki&#x27;s father in this world, but is childless in the other world; naturally, he is quite confused when our world&#x27;s Mitsuki calls him &quot;Dad&quot;.

:Both Kens share a love for instant ramen, a slightly off-color sense of humor, and an understanding that Kazuki is special. Despite appearing to goof off on the job (antagonizing Rara and Akane never gets old), Commander Sanada takes it quite seriously. When the U.N. turns against the EDF, his subordinates remain loyal to him, proving his worth as a leader.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Ken Sanada returns to being a scientist as well as being married to Akane Yamano. In the new world, Mitsuki Sanada is his daughter and Dee Sanada is his adopted daughter. His relation to Kazuki is cause for question. Kazuki calls him &quot;Uncle&quot; but it is debated among fans whether they are actually related in the new world.


:The Earth Defense Force&#x27;s United Nations advisor. Despite Akane&#x27;s tendency to work &quot;by the book&quot;, Ken and the young pilots often convince her to defy her orders, such as Rara&#x27;s demand for the EDF to repatriate his daughter. When the EDF is outlawed, she resigns her post and flees with Ken Sanada and the others.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Akane becomes Ken&#x27;s wife, as well as (unfortunately) Ayuko Rara&#x27;s junior (as Ayuko was married to Ken previously), enabling Ayuko to insist on Akane&#x27;s calling her &quot;big sister&quot;.


:The grandmother of Yayoi Schwael, she exists only in the alternate world. She is a woman of some mystery, working for the EDF in some unknown (possibly classified) capacity but also acting as a matchmaker for eligible young ladies with a success rate of almost 100% (Yayoi is one of the very few that escapes one of her grandmother&#x27;s matches, thanks to Kazuki and a Rara attack during the marriage interview). She embraces traditional values and is a woman of strong character and moral judgement, as demonstrated when she scolds Akane for allowing people to laugh at Kazuki when he is forced to wear a female disguise. She also cares very deeply for people and is revealed in the OVA to be a dog lover.


:In our world, Rara is a Nobel Prize-winning scientist (previously in competition with Ken Sanada for that honor). In the parallel world, he is become something of a megalomaniac. It was he who began the war in the first place, transforming himself into a messiah-like figure (&quot;You fools have no fear of God!&quot;, &quot;the divine power of the Rara Army&quot;).

:In the bizarre scene where Kazuki actually has dinner with the Rara family, the General reveals a softer side of himself; he believes that the war is about keeping the alien technology out of the wrong hands. However, it quickly becomes clear that Rara is simply a figurehead, with his wife wielding the real power. He redeems himself, however, when Kazuki attacks their base, and gets everyone out before it gets destroyed.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Rara and his wife move in next door to the Sanadas, hoping to corral Kazuki into revealing the secret of his connection to Zinv (one method being to get Kazuki into a situation where he would have to marry Mitsuki Rara).


:Ayuko was both Rara and Sanada&#x27;s wife in the two worlds, and is the mother of both Mitsukis. In the parallel world, she manipulates events while behind the scenes, posing as Rara&#x27;s submissive wife. In reality, she controls the Rara Army along with the mysterious alien named Kumu. She exploits Mitsuki Sanada&#x27;s love of Kazuki to convince Mitsuki to turn against the EDF. Ultimately, both Ayuko and HIMC are defeated by Kazuki and Zinv.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Ayuko attempts to &quot;arrange&quot; Kazuki&#x27;s marriage to her daughter, with humorous results.

:Mitsuki Rara&#x27;s best friends. While initially teasing Mitsuki for her attraction to Kazuki, they help him escape the Rara base when his identity is revealed. Later, they give Kazuki her diary after a battle, letting him know Mitsuki&#x27;s still thinking about him. The three later join Mitsuki Rara as pilots for the EDF.

:When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Alice, Mena and Ryla return to working for the Raras.


:A scientist in the employ of the Rara Army. She opposes the plan to force Mitsuki Rara to pilot HIMC, and warns her of her mother&#x27;s machinations. Hayase later joins the Earth Defense Force and works alongside Ken Sanada.

;Kumu

:An alien being encased in a shrine in Rara&#x27;s Garden, where it advises Ayouko Rara in the army&#x27;s dealings with the Earth Defense Force late in the series. After the world merge, it is represented as a small female dog gifted to the Sanada&#x27;s that has a penchant for biting Kazuki (whether out of affection or not is not quite clear).

==Glossary==
; Core Robots
: Three multicolored bipedal machines reverse engineered from Zinv. Because they are man-made, the Core Robots are inferior to the originals in every way.

: The Core Robots are used by the Earth Defense Force; Yayoi Schwael (replaced by Kazuki Yotsuga, and later by Mitsuki Rara) pilots the white Unit 1 (nicknamed &quot;Hartzenen/Halcynen&quot; by Kazuki), Mitsuki Sanada controls the red Unit 2, and D (briefly replaced by Alice, Mena, and Ryla) pilots the blue Unit 3.

; Earth Defense Force
: A United Nations-sponsored military organization under the command of Ken Sanada dedicated to foiling the Rara Army&#x27;s plans for world domination. The EDF employs many soldiers, but relies solely upon the three Core Robots in battle.

: Combat between the two armies is quite different from normal warfare; Rara informs the public where and when an attack will take place, and the combat zone is evacuated. At any time, either side can submit a &quot;callsign&quot;, indicating their surrender. Because of these measures, there have been no casualties in the war.

; HIMC (pronounced Himiko)
: Zinv&#x27;s opposite, HIMC carved a swath of ruin across D&#x27;s world before she escaped. It seems as though only people with negative emotions in their hearts can control HIMC, as evidenced by its initial rejection of Mitsuki Rara, and its violent reaction to Mitsuki Sanada&#x27;s jealousy. HIMC has some connection to the alien lifeform Kumu.

: HIMC is completely and totally destroyed at the hands of Zinv, compressed down to nothing to prevent it from regenerating.

; Kumu
: The alien that advises Ayuko Rara. It has some relationship to D, and hates men with a passion. Kumu resembles a floating, glowing bell and garland.

: When Zinv is destroyed and the worlds merge, Kumu is the name of a puppy that is given to the Sanada family by Ayuko Rara in the hopes of finding out information about Zinv. The name fits: while it loves the girls in the house, Kazuki gets a severe bite whenever he comes near.

; Life Sympathy
: A term for the power of a pilot&#x27;s will to exert control over robots. High Life Sympathy levels can enable a robot to move faster and inflict more damage with melee attacks. For reasons revealed at the end of the series, the robots on Earth only respond to female Life Sympathy, though Kazuki is somehow exempt.

: Because of his overwhelming negative Life Sympathy, Kazuki&#x27;s robot is capable of feats beyond most other models.

; Rara Army
: Formed by Hiroshi Rara, it intends to unite the world under its banner. Like the EDF, it uses robots in battle rather than conventional weapons, but its machines are exotic and beastly, differing from its rival&#x27;s humanoid robots. Rara&#x27;s robots are also remotely operated, unlike the Earth Defense Force&#x27;s cockpit-equipped models.

: Rara prefers to operate outlandishly, broadcasting attack trailers and boasting of his army&#x27;s God-given power (often through his mascot, Miss Ra). However, despite General Rara&#x27;s highly visible status within the organization, another person wields the real authority.

; The Original
: A mech under the control of the Rara army, it has the power to control the atmosphere as well as some electromagnetic capabilities. It captures Kazuki along with Hartzenen and brings them to Rara&#x27;s base where it falls off a large cliff, supposedly destroying it beyond repair.

: The Original and Zinv are the only mechs confirmed to be found in The Artifact.

; Zinv (pronounced Jinbu)
: An incredibly powerful robot found with D. It sat dormant in the EDF&#x27;s headquarters for years until Kazuki awakened it during Rara&#x27;s assault.

: Zinv has many unique abilities revolving around the manipulation of gravimetric forces, including gravitational projectiles, super speed, and crushing enemy mecha. Zinv also comes equipped with a nano-repair system that can fix any damage inflicted. Zinv only responds to Kazuki&#x27;s Life Sympathy, and sometimes activates itself when Kazuki is not aboard.

: Zinv defeats the lesser version of HIMC quite easily, but HIMC&#x27;s final form takes the upper hand. When D removes the limiter preventing males from piloting it (Kazuki skirts this by &quot;being&quot; Zinv), Zinv instantly repairs itself and generates Light Hawk Wings. With this newfound power, Kazuki decimates HIMC and creates a black hole, reducing the Rara fortress to nothing.

: With the two worlds dangerously close to oblivion, Zinv and Kazuki agree to destroy Zinv, ensuring that both worlds will live on. However, Zinv survives the explosion that consumes it, regenerating at the bottom of the ocean and returning to Kazuki in the third universe.

: Followers of &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; will recognize the Light Hawk Wings, as well as the Zinv look-alike in the anime &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot;. The &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; novels confirmed that they are in fact the very same robot, and not alternate universe versions of each other as previously thought.

==Connections to &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; Universe==
It has been confirmed by the creator of &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; and &quot;Dual!&quot; that the two series are related, and in fact occur in the same universe. A mecha, confirmed in the &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; novels to be Zinv, is found during an episode of &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; which runs parallel with the &quot;Tenchi&quot; OVA Series. The hero of the &quot;GXP&quot; series, Seina Yamada has been confirmed to be a direct reincarnation of Kazuki Yotsuga and, in a complicated way, several others are basically partial reincarnations of the rest of the cast. In fact, &quot;Dual&quot;! is so consistently relevant to the &quot;GXP&quot; novels they can be viewed as a distant sequel. 
*The Great Prehistoric Civilization mentioned in the &quot;True Tenchi Muyo&quot;! novels is revealed, in the &quot;Tenchi Muyo! GXP&quot; novels, to be the space-faring civilization begun by the characters at the end of &quot;Dual!&quot;. It seems to have died out close to a billion years prior to the main Tenchi Muyo timeline. Though not the first or last, this civilization eventually performed the greatest &quot;seeding&quot; program in the galaxy. They seeded proto-planets so that the human genome would replicate itself and somehow even seeded cultural and technological norms so things like handheld telephone designs would repeat throughout the galaxy and similar food dishes, like curry and spaghetti, would continue almost unchanged throughout history. Tenchi&#x27;s Earth has somehow turned out functionally identical to the earlier Earth. In fact, when the original solar system of the Earth from &quot;Dual&quot; is found, the entire solar system is found to be basically the same: containing a giant gas planet like Jupiter, a ringed planet like Saturn, etc.
*Washu explains that at one time in the past, a group of people (Kazuki&#x27;s group) made such an impact on the universe that their existence had massive effects on the &quot;Astral Sea&quot; (the dimension where a being&#x27;s &quot;astral self&quot; originates and returns after death) that their astrals basically replicated and continue to revive and form the base of many beings in the universe.
*Certain astrals are so similar to their past astral selves that they retain vestigial memories of their past life that come to them occasionally like déjà vu. Miki Steinbeck, apparently represents the closest thing to direct reincarnation to Mitsuki Sanada, and her father, Hiroshi Manada (or creator-she was an AI that developed an astral), is physically identical to Ken Sanada (but shares some personality features of Hiroshi Rara as well), a friend and rival of Hiroshi&#x27;s (named Ken Raraiba Steinbeck) also seems to be the other half of this mixed up duo. 
*By the end of &quot;GXP&quot;&#x27;s 14th novel, Miki, another digital AI named Kirche, and D (a direct astral copy of the original D, containing all her memories- but, for unknown reasons, acts like D before she became &quot;Dee&quot;) gain pseudo-cabbit bodies that were cloned from Fuku. With Fuku they seem to represent the most direct reincarnations of the original four girls in &quot;Dual&quot;. When the cabbit group appears in the 5th season of &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; each had the same voice actors that voiced their respective counterparts from &quot;Dual&quot;. 
*The Zinv that appears in &quot;GXP&quot; is the very same as the one in &quot;Dual&quot; and he immediately recognizes Seina as his partner.
*Seina represents an almost direct reincarnation of Kazuki and no others seem to share Kazuki&#x27;s base astral.
*Other than Miki, Mitsuki Sanada&#x27;s astral also forms the core of Kiriko Masaki, the Renza agent Karen, Tsukiko Masaki (Kiriko&#x27;s mother and also the model for the AI that Hiroshi created and became Miki), and others.
*Other than Fuku, Yayoi Schwael shares her astral pattern with Amane Kaunaq, the Renza agent Gyokuren, Mikami Kuramitsu, and others.
*Other than Kirche, Mitsuki Rara shares her astral pattern with Ryoko Balta, the Renza agent Suiren, Ringo Tasuki, and others.
*Other than the D that is her astral copy, D/Dee shares her astral pattern with Neju Na Melmas, the Renza agent Hakuren, and others.
*When four of the girls that share an astral with their &quot;Dual&quot; counterpoint join Seina, his bad luck (described as a &quot;biased probability&quot; in the novels) is lessened and can even create good luck. 
*Others that surround Seina, like Airi Masaki and Seto Kamiki Jurai probably represent other primary characters in &quot;Dual&quot;, such as Akane Yamano, Reika Nanjoin, and Ayuko Rara, but this has not been confirmed. Seto does have a separate &quot;mirror self&quot; called Kuis Panta that has been confirmed to share the D astral, but while they are practically copies of each other- they do not seem to share the same astral pattern.

=== Cameo appearances ===
*Sasami and several other &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot; characters were featured in inserts found in the &quot;Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure&quot; releases in Japan.
*Kiyone Makibi, Ramia, and Misao Amano appear in a brief easter egg cameo in the series&#x27; OVA special (&quot;Final Frontier&quot;, also known as episode 14).

==Production==
Dual! was inspired by the popularity of Neon Genesis Evangelion when it aired in Japan in the 1990s with the main characters inspired by the dynamics of Shinji, Asuka, Rei and Misato.

===Media===
Dual! was released in Japan via VHS, Laserdisc and DVD from June 25 to December 22, 1999. A Blu-Ray version was released in Japan on October 11, 2018.

The US/Canada version was formerly licensed by Pioneer (Geneon). On October 17, 2023, Discotek announced a Blu-Ray release of the anime in 2024.

<text>111 Huntington Avenue is a Boston skyscraper. Located on Huntington Avenue, it is part of the Prudential Center complex that also houses the Prudential Tower. Completed in 2002, the tower is tall and houses 36 floors. It is Boston&#x27;s 12th-tallest building. Its recognizable dome gives the tower the unofficial nicknames of The [[R2-D2]] Building, and the Juicer Building.

==Design==
The 36-story tower, constructed by John Moriarty &amp; Associates, Inc, is capped by an open-frame dome and crown which is illuminated at night. The building&#x27;s original design called for a flat roof, but Boston Mayor Thomas Menino objected; Menino chose the present design from among several options the developer subsequently proposed.

The postmodern facade consists of a blue glass curtain wall designed by the architect firm Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc. (CBT). The lobby interior consists of reflective black marble walls with finished wood paneling and a dramatic lobby waterfall.

<doc id="1047527" wikidata="Q196049" url="?curid=1047527" title="Paramaecium">
<text>Paramaecium (sometimes typeset as Paramæcium) was an Australian death/doom metal band formed in 1991. There is use of instrumentation like flutes, cellos and violins on some albums. Paramaecium is one of the few doom metal bands that focus on Christian lyrical themes and Christian concepts. According to Doom-metal.com, &quot;what sets Paramaecium apart from other bands in the doom metal scene, is the fact that they are the only Christian death/doom band that made it to the top of the genre.&quot;

== History ==

In 1993, Paramaecium released their debut album, &quot;Exhumed of the Earth&quot;. The band consisted of Andrew Tompkins on vocals and bass, Jason De Ron on guitar, and Jayson Sherlock on drums. The music was inspired by Cathedral, early My Dying Bride and Anathema. The band incorporated flute and violin sounds as well as a soprano alongside the usual musical offerings of death and doom metal.

Paramaecium added rhythm guitarist Chris Burton in 1995 and released their second album, &quot;Within the Ancient Forest&quot;, which was accompanied by a fantasy novel of the same name written by Tompkins. The album was more diverse and technical, and involved female vocalists, harpsichord, piano, flute and cello.

Sherlock left the band in 1996.

The third album, &quot;A Time to Mourn&quot;, was released in 1999 and marked the departure of all previous band members except Tompkins. The band no longer had a touring lineup, so guest musicians were used, including guitarist Ian Arkley (formerly of Seventh Angel, Ashen Mortality and My Silent Wake). After a five-year break, Paramaecium returned in 2004 with &quot;Echoes from the Ground&quot;. The album again featured Tompkins as the only original member, but held firmly to the band&#x27;s doom and death metal roots while again incorporating soprano and violins.

In 2005, Tompkins started working again with guitarist De Ron on songs for a new album. Early in 2006, drummer Sherlock rejoined the band and they played a series of concerts in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, and NordicFest in Oslo, Norway. The NordicFest appearance in November 2006 marked the official end of Paramaecium, but it was also the official launch of the band under its new name, InExordium. InExordium&#x27;s name is derived from a Paramaecium song off of &quot;Within the Ancient Forest&quot;. After InExordium broke up, Sherlock and guitarist Sheldon D&#x27;Costa formed Revulsed.

== Album concepts ==
All of Paramaecium&#x27;s albums have a concept that generally revolves around Christianity and Christian life. &quot;Exhumed of the Earth&quot; was based around the narrative of the New Testament, particularly the canonical gospels and the Book of Acts. &quot;Within the Ancient Forest&quot; is based on how Andrew Tompkins became a Christian, and &quot;A Time to Mourn&quot; is about a life in Christ, addressing the sorts of issues one might face as a modern Christian. &quot;Echoes from the Ground&quot; is about a young man&#x27;s journey through the Holy Lands to find a justification for his faith.

<doc id="1047538" wikidata="Q757262" url="?curid=1047538" title="Brugmansia">
<text>Brugmansia is a genus of seven species of flowering plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae. They are woody trees or shrubs, with pendulous flowers, and have no spines on their fruit. Their large, fragrant flowers give them their common name of angel&#x27;s trumpets, adjacent to the nickname devil&#x27;s trumpets of the closely related genus &quot;Datura&quot;.

&quot;Brugmansia&quot; species are among the most toxic of ornamental plants, containing tropane alkaloids of the type also responsible for the toxicity and deliriant effects of both jimsonweed and the infamous deadly nightshade. All seven species are known only in cultivation or as escapees from cultivation, and no wild plants have ever been confirmed. They are therefore listed as Extinct in the Wild by the IUCN Red List, although they are popular ornamental plants and still exist wild outside their native range as introduced species. It is suspected that their extinction in the wild is due to the extinction of some animal which previously dispersed the seeds, with human cultivation having ensured the genus&#x27;s continued survival.

==Description==
&quot;Brugmansia&quot; are large shrubs or small trees, with semi-woody, often many-branched trunks. They can reach heights of . The leaves are alternately arranged along the stems, generally large, long and across, with an entire or coarsely toothed margin, and are often covered with fine hairs. The name &quot;angel&#x27;s trumpet&quot; refers to the large, pendulous, trumpet-shaped flowers, long and across at the opening. They come in shades of white, yellow, pink, orange, green, or red. Most have a strong, pleasing fragrance that is most noticeable in the evening. Flowers may be single, double, or more.
==Taxonomy==
Linnaeus first classified these plants as part of &quot;Datura&quot; with his 1753 description of &quot;&quot;Datura arborea&quot;&quot;. Then in 1805, C. H. Persoon transferred them into a separate genus, &quot;Brugmansia&quot;, named for Dutch naturalist Sebald Justinus Brugmans. For another 168 years, various authors placed them back and forth between the genera of &quot;Brugmansia&quot; and &quot;Datura&quot;, until in 1973, with his detailed comparison of morphological differences, T.E. Lockwood settled them as separate genera, where they have stayed unchallenged since.

Currently, there are seven recognized species:

These species are then divided into two natural, genetically isolated groups. &quot;Brugmansia&quot; section &quot;Brugmansia&quot; (the warm-growing group) includes the species &quot;aurea&quot;, &quot;insignis&quot;, &quot;sauveolens&quot;, and &quot;versicolor&quot;. &quot;Brugmansia&quot; section &quot;Sphaerocarpium&quot; (the cold group) includes the species &quot;arborea&quot;, &quot;sanguinea&quot;, and &quot;vulcanicola&quot;.

Two of these species were challenged by Lockwood in his 1973 doctoral thesis.
First, &quot;Brugmansia vulcanicola&quot; was said to be a subspecies of &quot;B. sanguinea&quot;, but this was refuted by Lockwood&#x27;s former mentor, R. E. Schultes in 1977.
Second, Lockwood proposed that the species &quot;B. insignis&quot; was instead a hybrid of the combination (&quot;B. suaveolens&quot; × &quot;B. versicolor&quot;) × &quot;B. suaveolens&quot;. This was later disproved by crossbreeding experiments done by the Preissels, published in 1997.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Brugmansia&quot; are native to tropical regions of South America, along the Andes from Venezuela to northern Chile, and also in south-eastern Brazil. They are grown as ornamental container plants worldwide, and have become naturalized in isolated tropical areas around the globe, including within North America, Africa, Australia, and Asia.

==Ecology==
Most &quot;Brugmansia&quot; are fragrant in the evenings to attract pollinating moths. One species lacking scent, the red-flowered &quot;Brugmansia sanguinea&quot;, is pollinated by long-billed hummingbirds.
&quot;Brugmansia&quot; have two main stages to their life cycle. In the initial vegetative stage the young seedling grows straight up on usually a single stalk, until it reaches its first main fork at high. It will not flower until after it has reached this fork, and then only on new growth above the fork. Cuttings taken from the lower vegetative region must also grow to a similar height before flowering, but cuttings from the upper flowering region will often flower at a very low height.

One interesting example of plant/animal interaction involves the butterfly &quot;Placidula euryanassa&quot;, which uses &quot;Brugmansia suaveolens&quot; as one of its main larval foods. It has been shown that these can sequester the plant&#x27;s tropane alkaloids and store them through the pupal stage on to the adult butterfly, where they are then used as a defense mechanism, making themselves less palatable to vertebrate predators.

&quot;Brugmansia&quot; seed dispersal was probably formerly accomplished by mammalian megafauna, extinct since the Pleistocene. &quot;Brugmansia&quot; has long been extinct in the wild as their fruits now shrivel on the plants without progeny. They have been maintained in cultivation as a source of psychotropic drugs, following the loss of their evolutionary seed dispersal partner by humans.

==Historical uses==

&quot;Brugmansia&quot; are most often grown today as flowering ornamental plants.

&quot;Brugmansia&quot; contains deliriant hallucinogenic tropane alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine) which cause delirium and hallucinations. In modern medicine, these tropane alkaloids found in &quot;Brugmansia&quot; and other related members of Solanaceae have proven medical value for their spasmolytic, anti-asthmatic, anticholinergic, narcotic, and anesthetic properties, although many of these alkaloids, or their equivalents, are now artificially synthesized.
&quot;Brugmansia&quot; species have also traditionally been used in many South American indigenous cultures in medical preparations and as an entheogen in religious and spiritual ceremonies. Medicinally, they have mostly been used externally as part of a poultice, tincture, ointment, or where the leaves are directly applied transdermally to the skin. Traditional external uses have included the treating of aches and pains, dermatitis, orchitis, arthritis, rheumatism, headaches, infections, and as an anti-inflammatory. They have been used internally much more rarely due to the inherent dangers of ingestion. Internal uses, in highly diluted preparations, and often as a portion of a larger mix, have included treatments for stomach and muscle ailments, as a decongestant, to induce vomiting, to expel worms and parasites, and as a sedative.

Several South American cultures have used &quot;Brugmansia&quot; species as a treatment for unruly children, so that they might be admonished directly by their ancestors in the spirit world, and thereby become more compliant. Mixed with maize beer and tobacco leaves, it has been used to drug wives and slaves before they were buried alive with their dead lord.

In the Northern Peruvian Andes, shamans (curanderos) traditionally used &quot;Brugmansia&quot; species for initiation, divination, and black magic rituals. In some Latin American countries such as Colombia and Peru, members of the genus &quot;Brugmansia&quot; are reportedly used by malevolent sorcerers or &quot;bad shamans&quot; in some ayahuasca brews in attempt to take advantage of tourists. The species that are typically used for these purposes include &quot;Brugmansia suaveolens&quot; and &quot;Brugmansia arborea&quot; among others.

==Toxicity==
All parts of &quot;Brugmansia&quot; are potentially poisonous, with the seeds and leaves being especially dangerous.
&quot;Brugmansia&quot; are rich in scopolamine (hyoscine), hyoscyamine, and several other tropane alkaloids which can lead to anticholinergic toxidrome and delirium.
Effects of ingestion can include paralysis of smooth muscles, confusion, tachycardia, dry mouth, constipation, tremors, migraine headaches, poor coordination, delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, mydriasis, rapid onset cycloplegia, and death.

The hallucinogenic effects of &quot;Brugmansia&quot; were described in the journal &quot;Pathology&quot; as &quot;terrifying rather than pleasurable&quot;. The author Christina Pratt, in &quot;An Encyclopedia of Shamanism&quot;, says that &quot;&quot;Brugmansia&quot; induces a powerful trance with violent and unpleasant effects, sickening after effects, and at times temporary insanity&quot;. These hallucinations are often characterized by complete loss of awareness that one is hallucinating, disconnection from reality (psychosis), and amnesia of the episode, such as one example reported in &quot;European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience&quot; of a young man who amputated his own penis and tongue after drinking only one cup of &quot;Brugmansia sanguinea&quot; tea.

In 1994 in Florida, 112 people were admitted to hospitals after ingesting &quot;Brugmansia&quot;, leading one municipality to prohibit the purchase, sale, or cultivation of &quot;Brugmansia&quot; plants. The concentrations of alkaloids in all parts of the plant differ markedly. They even vary with the seasons and the level of hydration, so it is nearly impossible to determine a safe level of alkaloid exposure.

In 2022 &quot;The BMJ&quot; reported the following case: A woman in her 50s presented to the emergency department with blurred vision and pupil asymmetry for 3 hours. The right pupil was dilated, while the left was normal. A detailed history revealed that she had been pruning plants in her garden, when the blurred vision started. She did not complain of any other symptom. When all tests proved normal, she was finally asked to provide a photo of her garden. &quot;Brugmansia suaveolens&quot; (angel&#x27;s trumpet) was identified in the picture. On asking specific history, she reported rubbing her right eye after touching the plant&#x27;s leaves and flowers. Anecdotally, this is an example of &quot;Brugmansia&quot;s highly toxic properties, where even touching the leaves and flowers transfered sufficient amounts of active principles to the hand.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Brugmansia&quot; are easily grown in a moist, fertile, well-drained soil, in sun to part shade, in frost-free climates. They begin to flower in mid to late spring in warm climates and continue into the fall (autumn), often continuing as late as early winter in warm conditions. In cool winters, outdoor plants need protection from frost, but the roots are hardier, and may resprout in late spring. The species from the higher elevations, in &quot;B&quot;. section &quot;Sphaerocarpium&quot;, prefer moderate temperatures and cool nights, and may not flower if temperatures are very hot. Most &quot;Brugmansia&quot; may be propagated easily by rooting cuttings taken from the end of a branch during the summer.
Several hybrids and numerous cultivars have been developed for use as ornamental plants. &quot;B. &quot;×&quot; candida&quot; is a hybrid between &quot;B. aurea&quot; and &quot;B. versicolor&quot;; &quot;B. &quot;×&quot; flava&quot; is a hybrid between &quot;B. arborea&quot; and &quot;B. sanguinea&quot;; and &quot;B. &quot;×&quot; cubensis&quot; is a hybrid between &quot;B. suaveolens&quot;, &quot;B. versicolor&quot;, and &quot;B. aurea&quot;. There are cultivars producing double flowers, and some with variegated leaves. The cultivars &quot;B.&quot; × &quot;candida&quot; &#x27;Grand Marnier&#x27; and &#x27;Knightii&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<doc id="1047545" wikidata="Q6533680" url="?curid=1047545" title="Letterman (sports)">
<text>In sports or activities in the United States, a letterman is a high school or college student who has met a specified level of participation or performance on a varsity team.

==Overview==
The term comes from the practice of awarding each such participant a cloth &quot;letter&quot;, which is usually the school&#x27;s initial or initials, for placement on a &quot;letter sweater&quot; or &quot;letter jacket&quot; intended for the display of such an award. In some instances, the sweater or jacket itself may also be awarded, especially for the initial award to a given individual. Today, in order to distinguish &quot;lettermen&quot; from other team participants, schools often establish a minimum level of participation in a team&#x27;s events or a minimum level of performance in order for a letter to be awarded. A common threshold in American football and basketball is participation in a set level, often half, of all quarters in a season. In individual sports such as tennis and golf, the threshold for lettering is generally participation in one half or sometimes two-thirds of all matches contested. Frequently, other members of the team who fail to meet requirements for a letter are awarded a certificate of participation or other award considered to be of lesser value than a letter.

Some schools continue to base the awarding of letters according to performance, in team sports requiring a certain number of touchdowns, catches, scores, steals, baskets or tackles, according to position and sport. In individual sports letters are often determined according to qualification for state meets or tournaments. Other schools award letters on a more subjective basis, with the head coach, usually with the input of other coaches and sometimes student team leaders who have already lettered, awarding letters for substantial improvement as well as significant performance on or off the field. This places much more emphasis on character, commitment and teamwork as well as, and often in place of, simply playing enough or meeting some other time or performance requirement. Sometimes in high schools academic performance in classes can also be an element. This philosophy gives more focus to developing and rewarding a well-rounded and balanced player, where other methods focus strictly on athletic performance and on the field victories. This term is not gender-specific; a qualifying participant in women&#x27;s basketball or other women&#x27;s sports is properly referred to as a letterman, as would be a qualifying female participant on a co-educational sports team. An athlete who is awarded a letter (or letters in multiple sports) is said to have &quot;lettered&quot; when they receive their letter.

In recent years, some schools have expanded the concept of letterman beyond sports, providing letters for performance in performing arts, academics, or other school activities.

==Letter jacket==
A letter jacket is a baseball-styled jacket traditionally worn by high school and college students in the United States to represent school and team pride as well as to display personal awards earned in athletics, academics or activities. Letter jackets are also known as &quot;letterman jackets&quot;, &quot;varsity jackets&quot; and &quot;baseball jackets&quot; in reference to their American origins.

===Appearance and style===
The body (i.e., torso) is usually of boiled wool and the sleeves of leather with banded wrists and waistband. Letter jackets are usually produced in the school colors, with the body of the jacket in the school&#x27;s primary color and sleeves in the secondary color, although sometimes, the colors of the jacket may be customized to a certain extent by the student. There could be cases where a student could change the color so much that it doesn&#x27;t differentiate too much from school colors. 
They usually feature a banded collar for men or a top-buttoned hood (that unbuttons into an expanded collar) for women.

===Decorations===
The letter jacket derives its name from the varsity letter chenille patch on its left breast, which is almost always the first letter or initials of the high school or college the jacket came from. The letter itself can also be custom fitted to the particular sport or activity (e.g. cross country—a symbol or sign in the middle of the letter).

The name of the owner usually appears either in chenille (matching the letter) or embroidered on the jacket itself. The owner&#x27;s graduation year typically appears in matching chenille. Placement of the name and year of graduation depends on school traditions. The year is most often sewn on the right sleeve or just above the right pocket. The school logo and symbols representing the student&#x27;s activities may also be ironed onto the jacket.

Lettermen who play on a championship team often receive a large patch commemorating their championship that is worn on the back of the jacket.

Lettermen who participate in a sport in which medals are awarded often sew the medals onto their jackets to display their accomplishments.

===History===
Varsity jackets trace their origins to letter sweaters, first introduced by the Harvard University baseball team in 1865. The letter was usually quite large and centered (if the sweater was a pullover); stripes on one sleeve designated the number of letters won, with a star indicating a team captain.

By the 1930s, the lettered apparel had developed its well-known look: wool jackets with differently colored leather sleeves, and chenille lettering. 

Today, many letterman companies have added cellphone pockets to their jackets. 

===Traditions===
Letter jackets are almost never purchased before a student has earned a letter. In schools where only varsity letters are awarded this is usually the practice in a student&#x27;s junior or senior year. Recently, many student-athletes have been awarded letters during their sophomore and sometimes freshman year, leading to the need for a jacket much sooner. Still, the actual jacket is not usually purchased until the sophomore year. In schools where junior varsity letters are awarded, the jacket may be purchased by junior varsity letter recipients, though the letter is placed just above the left pocket, leaving space for a future varsity letter.

Some schools may award letter jackets to letter winners at an award ceremony, but more often, the school only provides the letter. Some schools will have fundraising activities or other programs to provide jackets to students who cannot afford them.

While it is commonly done, removing one&#x27;s letter from the letter jacket upon graduation is not firmly held as protocol. Many graduates keep the letter on the jacket after graduation as a symbol of accomplishment and school pride and commitment, especially with college lettermen.

<doc id="1047549" wikidata="Q6764148" url="?curid=1047549" title="Marine Hospital Service">
<text>The Marine Hospital Service was an organization of Marine Hospitals dedicated to the care of ill and disabled seamen in the United States Merchant Marine, the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal beneficiaries. The Marine Hospital Service evolved into the U.S. Public Health Service.

It was the point of origin for several components of the current Public Health Service, including the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, the National Institutes of Health, and multiple programs now incorporated into the Health Resources and Services Administration.

==History==

=== Background: Marine Hospital Fund ===

The origins of the system of Marine Hospitals can be traced to the passage, by the 5th Congress of the United States, of &quot;An Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen&quot; in 1798. This act created Marine Hospitals to care for sick seamen. The Marine Hospital Fund was placed under the Revenue Marine Service (a forerunner of the present-day Coast Guard) within the Department of the Treasury.

It was the first federal health law. It authorized a tax, which was the deduction of twenty cents per month from the wages of the seamen. This tax raised funds for physicians and to support the network of hospitals. The tax was about 1% of the wages of maritime sailors. (In 1884, the tax was abolished and in 1906 funds were dispensed by Congress.)

The act led to the gradual creation of a network of hospitals along coastal and inland waterways. They were initially located along the East Coast, at the harbors of the major port cities, with Boston being the site of the first such facility, followed later by others including in the Baltimore vicinity at Curtis Bay. As the boundaries of the United States expanded, and harbors were built on other coasts, so too were marine hospitals. In the 1830s and 1840s they were built along inland waterways, the Great Lakes, and the Gulf of Mexico. After the acquisition of the Oregon Territory (1846) and California (1848) hospitals were built in 1850s at Pacific Coast harbors.

Following the Civil War, public outcry and scandal surrounded the Marine Hospital Fund. In 1869, Dr. John Shaw Billings, a prominent Army surgeon, was appointed to head an investigation of the Marine Hospital Fund. Dr. Billings found the hospital fund to be inadequate and completely disorganized.

=== Establishment ===
In June 1870 the 41st Congress formally converted the loose network of locally controlled marine hospitals, the Marine Hospital Fund, into a centrally controlled Marine Hospital Service, with its headquarters in Washington, D.C. This reorganization made the Marine Hospital Service into its own bureau within the Department of the Treasury.

Dr. John Maynard Woodworth was subsequently appointed to the Service as &quot;Supervising Surgeon.&quot; He transformed the service into a disciplined organization based on his experience in the Union Army as a surgeon. Dr. Woodworth required his physicians to be a mobile work force stationed where the service was in need, and he mandated the daily wear uniforms. This eventually led to the creation of the modern-day Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. Dr. Woodworth, using Army-style heraldry, created the Marine Hospital Service fouled anchor and caduceus seal which is used to this day by the Public Health Service. In 1873, Dr. Woodworth&#x27;s title was changed to &quot;Supervising Surgeon General,&quot; a forerunner of the modern-day office of Surgeon General of the United States.

Woodworth created a cadre of mobile, career service physicians, who could be assigned as needed to the various Marine Hospitals. The commissioned officer corps was established by legislation in 1889, and signed by President Grover Cleveland. At first open only to physicians, over the course of the 20th century, the Corps expanded to include veterinarians, dentists, physician assistants, sanitary engineers, pharmacists, nurses, environmental health officers, scientists, and other types of health professionals. It is now known as the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service.

=== Increasing scope ===
The scope of activities of the Marine Hospital Service began to expand well beyond the care of merchant seamen in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, beginning with the control of infectious disease. Starting in the mid-14th century, ships entering harbors were quarantined when any of the crew was sick. This practice was normal procedure at United States harbors, with quarantine originally a function of the individual states, rather than of the Federal Government. The National Quarantine Act of 1878 vested quarantine authority to the Marine Hospital Service. However, the Public Health Act of 1879 created the National Board of Health, through which quarantine authority was shared with the U.S. Army and Navy; this arrangement was not reauthorized by Congress in 1883, and its powers reverted solely to the Marine Hospital Service. Over the next half a century, the Marine Hospital Service increasingly took over quarantine functions from individual state authorities.
The Marine Hospitals, as their name suggests, were hospitals constructed at key sea and river ports across the nation to provide health care for merchant marine sailors. Aside from the well-being of these sailors, the hospitals provided a key monitoring and gate-keeping function against pathogenic diseases. As immigration increased dramatically in the late 19th century, the Federal Government also took over the processing of immigrants from the individual states, beginning in 1891. The Marine Hospital Service was assigned the responsibility for the medical inspection of arriving immigrants at sites such as Ellis Island in New York Harbor. Commissioned officers played a major role in fulfilling the Service&#x27;s commitment to prevent disease from entering the country.

As the nation grew, the scope of Marine Hospital Service&#x27;s duties grew to include domestic and foreign quarantine and other national public health functions. Over time, the hospitals of the service were also expanded to include research and prevention work as well as the care of patients. Aside from merchant seamen, members of the military, immigrants, Native Americans, other federal beneficiaries, and people affected by chronic and epidemic diseases found a source for health care in the MHS and its hospitals.

In 1899, the Marine Hospital Service first formed internal divisions: the Division of Marine Hospitals and Relief, Division of Domestic (Interstate) Quarantine, Division of Insular and Foreign Quarantine and Immigration, Division of Personnel and Accounts, Division of Sanitary Reports and Statistics, Division of Scientific Research and Sanitation, and Miscellaneous Division, although there were minor name changes after this time.

=== Transformation into Public Health Service ===

In 1902, the Marine Hospital Service was renamed the &quot;Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service.&quot; In 1912, as the emphasis of its responsibilities shifted from sailors to general public health, the name was changed again to the &quot;Public Health Service&quot; to encompass its diverse and changing mission.

The Division of Hospitals, which contained the Marine Hospital system, became part of the Bureau of Medical Services in 1943, and was eventually renamed as a different Bureau of Medical Services within the Health Services Administration in 1973. Large new buildings were constructed for many Marine Hospitals in the 1920s and 1930s, and the system reached its peak of 30 hospitals in 1943. A wave of closings in 1944–1953 mainly targeted hospitals that had not been upgraded, and another wave during 1965–1970 closed the remaining hospitals at inland locations, leaving eight general hospitals and the National Leprosarium operating. The system was abolished in 1981, with the last eight general hospitals transferred to other organizations, and the remaining functions of the Bureau of Medical Services merged into the present Bureau of Primary Health Care within the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). PHS would however continue to operate the National Leprosarium until 1999.

Other pre-1912 divisions of the Marine Hospital Service have descendants that operate to the present day:

* The Division of Domestic Quarantine became the Division of States Relations and then the Bureau of State Services in 1943. This bureau would eventually give rise to the modern Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as the HRSA Bureau of Health Workforce and Healthcare Systems Bureau.
* The Division of Scientific Research became the National Institutes of Health. The Environmental Health Divisions (predecessor of the Environmental Protection Agency and FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health), and the Division of Industrial Hygiene (predecessor of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health), were spun off from it in the mid-20th century.
* The Division of Foreign Quarantine eventually became the CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.
* The Division of Sanitary Reports and Statistics was an ancestor of the CDC National Center for Health Statistics.

Today, the records for these institutions sit in storage at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland and the National Archives in College Park, Maryland.

== Hospitals ==
The hospitals themselves were, by the middle of the 19th century, fairly imposing and architecturally grand structures in many cases. As long as ample federal funding was available for their construction, these hospitals were impressive examples of government-provided health care. The hospitals of the early 20th century in major port cities such as New Orleans, San Francisco, and Savannah displayed ornate architectural detail and reflected many of the changes sweeping medicine at the time.

In addition to the major hospitals, many lower-class hospitals and clinics existed.

<text>Cinema arrived in Cuba at the beginning of the 20th century. Before the Cuban Revolution of 1959, about 80 full-length films were produced in Cuba. Most of these films were melodramas. Following the revolution, Cuba entered what is considered the &quot;Golden age&quot; of Cuban cinema.

== History ==
After being popularised by the brothers Louis Jean and Auguste Marie Lumière, the cinematographe traveled through several capital cities in different American countries before arriving in Havana, which occurred on January 24, 1897. It was brought from Mexico by Gabriel Veyre. The first presentation was offered at Paseo del Prado #126, just aside the Teatro Tacón. Four short films were shown: &quot;Partida de cartas&quot;, &quot;El tren&quot;, &quot;El regador y el muchacho&quot; y &quot;El sombrero cómico&quot;. The tickets were sold at a price of 50 cents, and 20 cents for kids and the military. Short after, Veyre performed a leading role in the first film produced in the island, &quot;Simulacro de incendio&quot;, a documentary centered around firemen in Havana.

In this first phase of introduction there were several locations devoted to cinema: Panorama Soler, Salón de variedades o ilusiones ópticas, Paseo del Prado #118, Vitascopio de Edison (in the famous Louvre sidewalk). The Teatro Irioja (today Teatro Martí) was the first to present cinema as one of its attractions. The first in a long list of movie theatres in Havana was set by José A. Casasús, actor, producer and entrepreneur, under the name of &quot;Floradora&quot;, later renamed &quot;Alaska&quot;.

In the six or seven years before World War I, cinema was expanded and stabilized as a business in the most important cities in Latin America. Cuba, just as the rest of the countries in the continent, went through those first years with itinerant and sporadic exhibitions, changing from European providers to North American providers, starting the dependency on the big Hollywood companies.

The first ambitious genre in the continent was probably historic reviews. In Cuba films like &quot;El Capitán Mambí&quot; and &quot;Libertadores o guerrilleros&quot; (1914), by Enríque Díaz Quesada with support from Gen. Mario García Menocal are worth mentioning. Díaz Quesada adapted from the Spanish novelist Joaquín Dicenta in 1910, as a tendency widely used then, of using literary works adapted for movies, as well as imitating Charlie Chaplin, the French comedies and cowboy adventure films. The silent stage of production was extended until 1937, when the first full-length fiction movie was produced.

=== Pre-revolutionary cinema ===

Before the Cuban Revolution of 1959 the total film production was around 80 full-length movies. Some films are worth mentioning, such as &quot;La Virgen de la Caridad&quot; starring Miguel Santos and &quot;Romance del Palmar&quot; by Ramón Peón. Many famous people from the continent came to the island to film, and some leading Cuban actors had a strong presence mainly in Mexico and Argentina. Musicians such as Ernesto Lecuona, Bola de Nieve or Rita Montaner also performed and composed for movies in several countries.

=== Cinema after the revolution ===

In the first days of 1959, the new government created a cinematographic department within the &quot;Dirección de Cultura del Ejército Rebelde&quot; (Culture Division of the Rebel Army), which sponsored the production of documentaries such as &quot;Esta tierra nuestra&quot; by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea, and &quot;La vivienda&quot; by Julio García Espinosa. This was the direct ancestor of what would eventually become the &quot;Instituto Cubano del Arte y la Industria Cinematográficos&quot; (ICAIC), which was founded in March as a result of the first culture law of the revolutionary government. Film, according to this law, is &quot;the most powerful and provocative form of artistic expression, and the most direct and widespread vehicle for education and bringing ideas to the public.&quot; The ICAIC founded &quot;Cine Cubano&quot; in 1960. All production, distribution, and exhibition in the country were run by ICAIC by 1965. The ICAIC also established mobile projection units called &quot;cine moviles&quot;, trucks that visited remote areas to hold screenings. From its foundation up until 1980, Alfredo Guevara was head of the ICAIC. Under his direction, the organization was pivotal in the development of Cuban cinema which came to be identified with anti-imperialism and revolution.

The first ten years of the institution were called by critics the Golden Age (&quot;Década de Oro&quot;) of Cuban cinema, most of all because of the making of &quot;Lucía&quot; (1969) by Humberto Solás and &quot;Memorias del subdesarrollo&quot; (&quot;Memories of Underdevelopment&quot;) (1968) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea. These two directors are often regarded as the best film directors to have come out of Cuba. &quot;Memorias del subdesarrollo&quot; was selected among the best 100 films of all times by the International Federation of Film Clubs. One of the most prolific and strong branches of the Cuban cinema in the last 40 years has been documentaries and short-films. The documentary &quot;Now&quot; (1965) by Santiago Álvarez is often considered the first video clip in history. It combines a song with an uninterrupted sequence of images depicting racial discrimination in the U.S..

Animation has also been a major highlight in the last decades. In 1974, Juan Padrón gave birth to &quot;Elpidio Valdés&quot;, a character that represents a mambí fighter, struggling for Cuban independence against the Spanish occupation in the 19th century. It is very popular among Cuban children. Another great success of Cuban animation was the full-length film &quot;Vampiros en La Habana&quot; (1983), also by Juan Padrón.

Essential in the history of Cuban cinema is the &quot;Noticiero ICAIC Latinoamericano&quot; (Latin-American ICAIC News) whose first director was Alfredo Guevara. Years later it was directed by Santiago Álvarez and the Mexican Rodolfo Espino, the most successful documentary maker in the island. In 1979 the ICAIC played a key role in the creation of the Festival Internacional del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano (International Festival of New Latin American Cinema) allowing Latin American films a more international audience. The festival is one of the most important of its type in Latin America and has been held in Havana every year since 1979. There is also an international cinema university, the &quot;Escuela Internacional de Cine, Televisión y Video de San Antonio de los Baños&quot; (International School of Cinema, Television and Video of San Antonio de los Baños) located in San Antonio de los Baños near Havana, on land donated by the Cuban government and supported by the &quot;Fundación del Nuevo Cine Latinoamericano&quot;, Gabriel García Márquez and the Father of the New Latin American Cinema, Fernando Birri. Hundreds of young students from all over Latin America have studied direction, script, photography and edition.

The contribution of the ICAIC, which was rapidly positioned as the head of a process aiming for legitimate artistic values and expression of nationality, is not limited only to the support in producing and promoting a movement that spanned fiction, documentary and animation, but also allowed for the exhibition and spread of popular knowledge of the best of cinema from all over the world. It also created the film archives of the Cinemateca de Cuba, and took part in initiatives such as Cinemóviles, which made cinema available on the most intricate sites of the national geography.

The institution also helped developing the Cuban poster, as a mean of promoting films. It gave birth between 1969 and 1977, to the Grupo de Experimentación Sonora, which influenced Cuban music to a great extent, serving as a starting point for the movement of the Nueva Trova. Figures like Silvio Rodríguez, Pablo Milanés and Leo Brouwer were prominent through all this process.

In 1980, Alfredo Guevara was ousted from his position as head of the ICAIC, which he had held since its formation, over controversies about &quot;Cecilia&quot;&#x27;. The film, directed by Humberto Solás, was based on the 19th century Cuban novel Cecilia Valdés. It was the most ambitious Cuban film to date and somewhat monopolized the funds available to filmmakers during its production. This, coupled with the fact that many other directors and the general public did not agree with Solás&#x27;s interpretation of the film, led to the removal of Alfredo Guevara from his position.

Having won a great deal of autonomy from the central government in the 1970s, the ICAIC, under the new leadership of Julio García Espinosa, was allowed to make many films dealing with sociopolitical issues. Espinosa was able to increase the recognition of Cuban film and especially of the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema by obtaining greater funds from the government and also inviting big names such as Francis Ford Coppola, Sydney Pollack, Robert De Niro, and Jack Lemmon to the island. Despite his successes, Espinosa faced a large problem in 1991, again due to a controversial film. This film, entitled &quot;Alicia en el pueblo de Maravillas&quot;, was very critical of the bureaucracy of the government. This, combined with the simultaneous collapse of the Soviet Union, led to Espinosa&#x27;s retirement.

During this time, Alfredo Guevara returned to the scene of the ICAIC in order to help it maintain its autonomy from the central government. Many of the party faithful were calling for the organization to merge with the Cuban Radio and Television Institute. Due to the loss of Cuba&#x27;s largest trading partner, the Soviet Union, the future of the island country became uncertain, and criticism of the government, which the ICAIC was known for, became unpopular. Guevara managed to get the film released and allow the ICAIC to keep its independent status. He then remained president of the organization throughout the Special Period until his retirement in 2000.

One of the most notable Cuban films in the recent years was &quot;Fresa y chocolate&quot; (&quot;Strawberry and Chocolate&quot;) (1993) by Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío. It is about intolerance, and portrays the friendship between a homosexual and a young member of the Unión de Jóvenes Comunistas (a communist youth organization). It was also the first Cuban production to ever be nominated for an Academy Award.

Omar González succeeded Alfredo Guevara as the head of the ICAIC and remains in that position today. It continues to directly aid in the production and distribution of films and has production offices, issues film permits, rents studios and equipment to filmmakers, and is closely involved in each stage of the film, from its inception and production, to its distribution and release.

=== Cinema of the Cuban diaspora ===

After the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Cubans who were ideologically ill at ease with the new revolutionary government made their way to the United States, where they settled in concentrated communities made up of other Cubans in South Florida, New York, and New Jersey. Unlike traditional immigrants who chose to leave the homeland behind in search of a better way of life in a new place, most of these Cubans consider themselves exiles forced out of their homeland by political or economic circumstances. Because they continue to think of themselves as Cuban even after decades in the United States, it is appropriate to talk about them as part of a Cuban diaspora that links them emotionally and psychologically to the island. Over one million Cubans have left Cuba since 1959 in different waves of immigration. Among those are talented directors, technicians and actors who settled in the US, Latin America or Europe, in search of work and creative space in the field of cinema.

&quot;Los gusanos&quot; (&quot;The Worms&quot;) (1978) produced by Danilo Bardisa and directed by Camilo Vila was the first film made by the Cuban exiles dealing with Cuban politics. The screenplay written by Orestes Matacena, Clara Hernandez and Camilo Vila has an overwhelming impact in the U.S. Cuban community inspiring many other Cuban filmmakers to tell their stories with their cameras.

Orlando Jiménez Leal, one of the best known exile filmmakers, produced &quot;El Super&quot; (1979), the first Cuban exile fictional film, directed by Jiménez Leal and his young brother-in-law, Leon Ichaso. Based on a play by Ivan Acosta, the film was broadly distributed in the U.S. and won awards at film festivals in Mannheim, Biarritz and Venice. The film examines the trauma of the Cuban middle class, showing them as displaced from their former life and unable to adapt to new circumstances. It also highlights generational conflicts between Cuban-born parents and their teenage children who have been raised in the U.S. and reject tradition in favor of the North American way of life. Jiménez Leal went on to make documentary films such as &quot;The Other Cuba&quot; (1983) and &quot;Improper Conduct&quot; (1984) in collaboration with Néstor Almendros. &quot;Improper Conduct&quot; is a highly controversial film that deals with the treatment of gays in Cuba. &quot;The Other Cuba&quot; is a bitter denunciation of the Revolution told from the point of view of the exiled community. The director&#x27;s strong anti-Castro stance gave voice to the growing community of Cuban political exiles in the U.S. in the 1980s.
Leon Ichaso&#x27;s best known film in the U.S. is &quot;Bitter Sugar &quot;(1996), a fictional film that strongly criticizes life in post-revolutionary Cuba. The screenplay, written by Ichaso and Orestes Matacena shows the disillusionment of a young Communist and his girlfriend, who are pushed to the breaking point by a repressive society. In tone and theme, it is similar to Jorge Ulla&#x27;s &quot;Guaguasí&quot; (1982), which had less distribution in the U.S. The &quot;Guaguasí&quot; screenplay, written by Orestes Matacena, Clara Hernandez and Ulla, portrays a simple man from the countryside, played by actor Orestes Matacena, who is brutalized by his experiences with the revolutionary government in Cuba. The reactionary stance of directors like Villa, Ulla, Ichaso, Almendros and Jiménez Leal has made them the cinematic spokespersons for Cubans who believe that Fidel Castro is personally responsible for negative changes that have occurred in Cuba since 1959. &quot;Bitter Sugar&quot; has been shown to the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, Switzerland and to the US Congress.

An important theme in cinema of the Cuban diaspora is the coming and going of people in exile, and the difficult process of adaptation to a new culture. Iván Acosta made the film &quot;Amigos&quot; (1986) to show the painful bicultural existence of Cuban-Americans living in Miami. Although it is a low-budget film, it does an effective job of capturing the problems of the younger generation of Cuban-Americans who are torn between the desire to fit in and the pressure to uphold tradition. &quot;Lejanía&quot; (1985) by Jesús Díaz is the first film to deal with the issue of Cuban exiles returning to the island for visits with relatives. &quot;Cercanía&quot; (2008) by Rolando Díaz, the brother of Jesús, shows a recent arrival from Cuba attempting to reconcile with his family in Miami after decades apart. Rather than address political themes in a direct way, these films focus on personal issues related to adaptation and culture shock. &quot;Honey for Oshún&quot; (2001) by Humberto Solás, a Cuban director who remained in Cuba, addresses the clash between Cuban-Americans returning to the island and those who never left. It hints that reconciliation is possible, as long as those who return are willing to accept Cuba on its own terms and not force capitalist ideology on the Cuban people.

In Cuba, films made by Cuban-Americans or Cubans in exile are not widely distributed or well known, in part because the films deal with the Revolution in a negative light, but also because Cubans on the island dispute the notion of a Cuban diaspora and believe that those who live in exile no longer represent Cuban reality in an authentic light. They take the position that directors who experience life outside Cuba represent Cuba through a distorted lens, and that the films they make are largely works of propaganda.

Many important Cuban actors now live in exile. Among them are César Évora, Anabel Leal, Reinaldo Cruz, Francisco Gattorno, Reynaldo Miravalles, Tomás Millán, William Marquez, Orestes Matacena and Isabel Moreno. Cuban American actors who were born in Cuba but grew up in the U.S. include Andy García, Steven Bauer, William Levy, and Tony Plana.

=== International co-productions ===

The international co-production of films has become very important for the cinema of Cuba and also for the rest of Latin America. An internationally co-produced film is one in which two or more production companies from different countries are involved, or the financing has been sourced from more than one country. Co-productions are becoming increasingly common today but even as early as 1948 were common between Cuba and Mexico.

International co-productions began to take off in the 1960s and 1970s, many with the aim of increasing political awareness and highlighting common problems in Latin American countries. Before its dissolution, the USSR also played a role of co-producing films in Cuba such as Mikhail Kalatozov&#x27;s &quot;I Am Cuba&quot;. The increased importance of co-produced films was inevitable due to globalization, and in the case of Cuba especially, due to a lack of economic resources. A film created with the cooperation of two or more countries nearly always guaranteed distribution in both countries, resulting in a greater audience and increased revenues. This also allowed for more exposure of regional cinemas.

Beginning as early as the 1930s Spain played a role in producing Latin American and Cuban films, but began to invest more heavily in the 1990s. In 1997, Ibermedia was created for the purpose of promoting co-production between Spain and Latin American countries. There are 14 countries involved in this organization and Cuba is one of them. Two examples of Cuban co-produced films are Humberto Solás&#x27;s &quot;Cecilia&quot; (Cuba/Spain) and Tomás Gutiérrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabío&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated &quot;Strawberry and Chocolate&quot; (Cuba/Mexico/Spain).

There have been mixed opinions about the development of co-productions. For some it is a necessary evil. Humberto Solás states that &quot;For established filmmakers there is not a single cent for production. We are obliged to seek co-productions. If a film is not co-produced, it will not be made.&quot; The problem with finding foreign funding for Cuban films is that, often, the financiers want to have some amount of influence over the final product so that it can be successful in their own countries. Frequently there are also stipulations that require a certain number of cast and crew to be working on the film from each of the producing countries. For example, a Cuban film that was co-produced by Spain would require a certain number of Spanish actors, writers or directors, and production technicians. This makes it difficult for Cuban national cinema to hold on to its identity and also creates issues when determining the nationality of a film. Julio García Espinosa agrees that the benefit of co-productions is that it has allowed for films to continue being made in Cuba and Latin America, but believes that the most successful co-productions are those that exist solely between Latin American countries.

Cuba has been involved in aiding in the production of other Latin American films, but through technical assistance rather than acting as a financier. One example is Chilean director Miguel Littín&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated &quot;Alsino and the Condor&quot;, which was shot in Nicaragua and received technical support from Cuba. Also in the late 1980s, Cuba created the Third World Film School to train students from various third world countries in the art of filmmaking.

==Imperfect cinema==
Cuban cinema and Latin American films communicate many different meanings, messages, and focuses. Cuban film director Julio García Espinosa was well known in the 1960s for his contributions to cinematography and culture. He was a founder of the ICAIC and the President of the Section of Cinema of the Cultural Society. The main objectives of Cuban cinema were production, distribution, and screening films that recorded the ongoing revolutionary process from the perspectives of ordinary people. According to Davies, the films that were shot on location and featured local people were shown free of charge across the country in city cinemas and on makeshift village screens to spectators who were encouraged to participate actively in the films&#x27; reception and interpretation. In 1968–88, the most common and desired form of film used in Cuba was Imperfect Cinema.

It can be acknowledged that Imperfect Cinema was creative, innovative and possessed a distinctive style that is typically a very thought provoking original work of art, Oscar Quirós concluded. Imperfect films captured the viewer&#x27;s attention because the relevance of the story line matched what the audiences were experiencing in their own lives. Imperfect Cinema is a form or theme found through audiences that have struggled in life and are aware of the hard times the people were going through. Only in the person who suffers people perceive elegance, gravity, even beauty; only in him people recognize the possibility of authenticity, seriousness, and sincerity. Not only does imperfect cinema represent the struggles of the people it also reveals the process which has generated the problem. The subjective element is the selection of the problem, conditioned as it is by the interest of the audience-which is the subject. The objective element is showing the process-which is the object. Imperfect Cinema uses the audience as the subject to show the process of the problem as the object.

Aside from indicating the demonstrative, communicative and inquisitive qualities, these characteristics also convey an implicit utilitarian quality. In other words, Imperfect Cinema possesses utilitarian features because it must perform a particular political function within society. Cubans felt included by the films which gave them a sense of importance and pride. Cuban and Latin American films were successful in the international market even though they did not always fit the hegemonic models or use mainstream film languages. Imperfect Cinema is a great example of film that is accepted internationally even though it does not fit into the Hollywood genre or codes of representation.

Style for Imperfect Cinema is thus defined by the specific techniques and qualities contextualized in orthodox Marxism&#x27;s aesthetics of content over form, such as the use of &#x27;type&#x27; characters, harsh imagery made by scratches, under/over exposure, high contrast, excessive movements of the camera, presentation of historical events and the wide use of hand-held cameras. This form of film was very popular among the revolutionary people because the films were portrayed in a manner that was very easy to relate to and shared a common feeling and interest among the people that were experiencing similar situations that were occurring in Cuba at the time. The revolution provided alternatives, supplied an entirely new response, enabled the country to do away with elitist concepts and practices in art, and was the highest expression of culture because it abolished artistic culture as a fragmentary human activity.

Imperfect Cinema was responsible for making a reputation for Cuban film, but by the mid-1970s, Cuban filmmakers were purposely making a different style of cinema. Chanan, for example, concludes that by the late 1970s Imperfect Cinema had just about disappeared. He believes that since then Cuban cinema has given up the challenge of creating its own style in favor of imitating Hollywood. For Garcia Espinosa and many of his fellow Latin American filmmakers, Imperfect Cinema was the answer to the need of creating a form of art that demonstrates the process of the problems ... not a cinema to beautifully illustrate concepts and ideas they already know. The purpose of this revolutionary form of film was derived from the revolution itself. By 1989, Cuban cinema had the formal sophistication to carry any revolutionary message, or none at all, Quirós indicated. Imperfect cinema was no longer interested in quality or technique. It can be created equally well with a Mitchell or with an 8mm camera, in a studio or in a guerrilla camp in the middle of the jungle.

Since all of these critical operations require new approaches to film directing, they cannot expect flawless results every time. Films built on the consecrated conventions of traditional cinematography are more likely to attain technical &quot;perfection&quot; than those necessarily &quot;imperfect&quot; attempts to challenge established conventions and search out new approaches. The opposite of imperfect cinema is &quot;perfect&quot; cinema which is basically described as films that are portrayed as perfect, flawless, and contain beautiful scenery. The majority of scenes that are shot in a &quot;perfect&quot; film are in a beautiful place, typically the film is not produced to make the viewer think, and they&#x27;re usually more aesthetically pleasing rather than meaningful. They maintain that imperfect cinema must above all show the process which generates the problems. It is thus the opposite of a cinema principally dedicated to celebrating results, the opposite of a self-sufficient and contemplative cinema, the opposite of a cinema which &quot;beautifully illustrates&quot; ideas or concepts which already possess. However, the aesthetic changes that were better perceived after the mid-1970s were a reflexion of the social underlying changes in the ideological Marxist fabric away from Orthodox Marxism and more in tune with the Marxian ideal of emancipation. The new Perfect Cinema is not a cinema to move away from the social, political, and economic issues of Cuban society, but it is a move forward to better illustrate the Cuban social whole. These aesthetic changes that characterize Perfect Cinema predate the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the end of the Cold War underlying the significance of this new Cuban style of cinema as both as manifestation of social changes and a leader of such a change.

Modern authorship is established and valued mostly as a matter of output and public success. &quot;Perfect&quot; films are valued by critics, awards, and merchandise that are produced because of the film. Compared to &quot;perfect&quot; films, imperfect films focus on the art, sending a message, and creating substance. Most Latin American films can only achieve success in the international market if they emulate hegemonic models and borrow from mainstream film languages. The &quot;perfect&quot; films are difficult for Latin American and Cuban film makers to compete with because most viewers are interested in watching films that are visually attractive and don&#x27;t require a lot of thought while watching. It stands to reason that today&#x27;s changing circumstances of film production and consumption determine that genres cannot exist by mere repetition and recycling of past models but have to engage with difference and change. Art will not disappear into nothingness; it will disappear into everything.

===Post-Cold War era===
The post Cold War period is known as the &quot;Special Period&quot; in Cuba. During this time period the Cuban cinema industry suffered greatly (as did the Cuban citizens due to severe economic depression). This is best phrased by Elliott Young:

The state expected artists, filmmakers, and intellectuals to become economically autonomous and not rely on state subsidies; this new market orientation forced cultural producers to seek foreign financing or simply to leave the country altogether. The impact of the economic crisis hit the Instituto Cubano del Arte e Industria Cinematográfico (ICAIC) directly, leading to an exodus of personnel and the slowing down of production to the extent that, in 1996, the Institute did not release a single feature film.

The films that were produced were no longer made solely for Cuban people, but mainly for foreign audiences. Pastor Vega states &quot;Before one only thought about the Cuban public. Now you have to think about &#x27;marketing&#x27; and &#x27;profits&#x27; and all that&quot;. However, the films that were produced for the Cuban people, tended to take a more drastic turn towards more controversial issues. One of the biggest genres that came out of this period was about homosexuality. One of the most popular movies that come out of this time period is called &quot;Fresa y chocolate&quot; (1994, &quot;Strawberry and Chocolate&quot;). The success of this movie &quot;can be partially explained by the way the film elicits multiple recognition from the Cuban viewer&quot; and that it makes the viewer think/look at the film in a different light.

During this time the producers and directors had to always think about cost of production. In the past, going on long excursions to make films were the standard rather than the exception. A perfect example of a movie that was made through this time period is called &quot;Madagascar&quot; (1994), directed by Fernando Perez. Ann Marie Stock states (about the production of &quot;Madagascar&quot;):

&quot;Madagascar&quot; (1994), was made against all odds, during a time when Cuba&#x27;s state sponsored film institute was experiencing shortages of virgin film stock, fuel to transport crews and equipment, food to provide a meal to those working long days, and the hard currency necessary to edit, produce and distribute films.

The films that were lucky enough to be put into production, found them that they were being produced as close to the ICAIC (Cuban Institute of Cinematographic Art and Industry) as possible, or found that the major cities (Havana, Santiago de Cuba, etc. ...) became the backdrop to the plot of the movies. This allowed the directors to use ordinary citizens in the movies instead of having to bring in extras for production. The director could even use citizens&#x27; homes as a backdrop, if the owner agreed to allow the director to use it.

<text>Dan I (1354 – 23 September 1386) was the ruler of Wallachia from 1383 to 1386. He was the son of Radu I of Wallachia and the half-brother of Mircea I of Wallachia.

The circumstances surrounding his death are unclear. Laonikos Chalkokondyles claims that he was assassinated by his stepbrother Mircea I in collusion with a boyar party. However, the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle states that Dan I was assassinated during a campaign fought between 1384–1386 against Ivan Shishman of Tarnovo purportedly in favour of his half-brother Ivan Sratsimir of Vidin, but ultimately part of the early Wallachian rulers&#x27; attempts to expand their rule south of the Danube.

Dan I&#x27;s descendants were members of the House of Dăneşti, one of the two factions descended from Basarab I, that were claimants to the voivodeship of the Principality of Wallachia in subsequent centuries. The other rival faction was the House of Drăculeşti.

<doc id="1047559" wikidata="Q2292358" url="?curid=1047559" title="Brazilian Army">
<text>The Brazilian Army (; EB) is the branch of the Brazilian Armed Forces responsible, externally, for defending the country in eminently terrestrial operations and, internally, for guaranteeing law, order and the constitutional branches, subordinating itself, in the Federal Government&#x27;s structure, to the Ministry of Defense, alongside the Brazilian Navy and Air Force. The Military Police (; PMs) and Military Firefighters Corps (; CBMs) are legally designated as reserve and auxiliary forces to the army. Its operational arm is called Land Force. It is the largest army in South America and the largest branch of the Armed Forces of Brazil.

Emerging from the defense forces of the Portuguese Empire in Colonial Brazil as the Imperial Brazilian Army, its two main conventional warfare experiences were the Paraguayan War and the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, and its traditional rival in planning, until the 1990s, was Argentina, but the army also has many peacekeeping operations abroad and internal operations in Brazil. The Brazilian Army was directly responsible for the Proclamation of the Republic and gradually increased its capacity for political action, culminating in the military dictatorship of 1964–1985. Throughout Brazilian history, it safeguarded central authority against separatism and regionalism, intervened where unresolved social issues became violent and filled gaps left by other State institutions.

Changes in military doctrine, personnel, organization and equipment mark the history of the army, with the current phase, since 2010, known as the Army Transformation Process. Its presence strategy extends it throughout Brazil&#x27;s territory, and the institution considers itself the only guarantee of Brazilianness in the most distant regions of the country. There are specialized forces for different terrains (jungle, mountain, Pantanal, Caatinga and urban) and rapid deployment forces (Army Aviation, Special Operations Command and parachute and airmobile brigades). The armored and mechanized forces, concentrated in Southern Brazil, are the most numerous on the continent, but include many vehicles nearing the end of their life cycle. The basic combined arms unit is the brigade.

Conventional military organizations train reservist corporals and privates through mandatory military service. There is a broad system of instruction, education and research, with the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras (; AMAN) responsible for training the institution&#x27;s leading elements: officers of infantry, cavalry, engineering, artillery and communications, the Quartermaster Service and the Ordnance Board. This system and the army&#x27;s own health, housing and religious assistance services, are mechanisms through which it seeks to maintain its distinction from the rest of society.

== Roles ==
The Brazilian Army is one of the three singular forces that make up the Brazilian Armed Forces, alongside the Brazilian Navy and the Air Force, all of which, according to article 142 of Brazil&#x27;s constitution, act in the defense of the homeland and in guaranteeing constitutional powers and law and order, in addition to subsidiary attributions defined by complementary laws. The army forms the nation&#x27;s land force, acting primarily in its external defense, but it also has a whole series of internal missions. Its declared objectives include deterring external aggression, gaining prominence on the international stage and contributing to &quot;sustainable development and social peace&quot;.

Historically, previous Brazilian constitutions defined both external and internal functions for the Armed Forces. A large workload is dedicated to the doctrine, planning, preparation and execution of law and order operations. The army has a long history of internal defense and state structuring, defending political regimes and addressing threats from unresolved social issues that have resulted in internal conflicts. Throughout Brazil&#x27;s republican period, it is the most politically powerful of the three forces due to its past positions, its presence throughout the country&#x27;s territory and its larger strength.

Covering the incompleteness of the national State, filling gaps that should have been satisfied by other institutions, is part of the army&#x27;s culture. Through its &quot;Presence Strategy&quot;, it occupies demographic voids, acting as a &quot;colonizing army&quot;, whether through the military colonies it established in the 19th century or through current border posts, and sees itself as the only factor of Brazilianness in these remote regions of the country. Subsidiary roles are constant. Possibly at the expense of preparing for war, the army operates in the scientific-technological and socioeconomic fields, carries out engineering works, receives refugees (Operation Acolhida) and distributes water in Northeastern Brazil (Operation Pipa), among many other missions.

==History==
The Brazilian Army originates from the defense forces of the Portuguese Empire in Colonial Brazil. A Brazilian national army was designated by law for the first time in the Brazilian Empire&#x27;s 1824 constitution, but land forces had already been fighting under the Brazilian flag since the proclamation of Independence in 1822. Command of these forces, until then dispersed among the viceroys and captain-generals of the captaincies, was unified under the Secretariat of State for War Affairs (later the Ministry of War) in 1822.

Since 1994, the Brazilian Army has officially commemorated the First Battle of Guararapes, fought on 19 April 1648, as the moment in which the &quot;seeds&quot; of the institution were planted. There was still no &quot;Brazilian nation&quot; or Brazilian Army, however, and no current military organization in the country has institutional continuity with those that fought in 1648. Several current units, however, trace their history back to the colonial period, such as the Old &quot;Terço&quot; of Rio de Janeiro, from 1567, whose heir is the 1st Mechanized Infantry Battalion.

The highest authority in the army was the Adjutant General, whose body, the Adjutant General&#x27;s Office, was created in 1857. The Adjutant General was always a military officer and served as an intermediary between the army and the Minister of War, whose position was a political one. When the office was abolished, the chiefs of the Army General Staff (; EME), created in 1899, and the Ministers of War began to compete for primacy of command. The Ministry of War won the dispute. In 1967, it was renamed Ministry of the Army, which was later transformed into the current Army Command, subordinate to the Ministry of Defense, in 1999.

=== 19th century ===

==== First reign ====

The Brazilian War of Independence divided the military forces present in what is now Brazilian territory: some joined the Brazilian cause and others remained loyal to Portugal. The Brazilian victory in the war did not break the continuity with the military organization and doctrine of the Portuguese Army, whose characteristics would be visible in the Brazilian institution until the beginning of the 20th century. Portuguese professionals, landowners, European mercenaries and &quot;ordenanças&quot; came together in a heterogeneous army.

The hierarchy had feudal aspects. Promotion criteria were poorly defined. Some officers progressed in their careers within the institution, but others, coming from the civilian elite and the aristocracy, moved between the ranks and politics. Officers did not serve far from their birthplaces, and it was only later that service rotation in the provinces emerged. Soldiers were generally obtained by impressment, although there were volunteers, including fugitive slaves. Until 1830, and again in 1851–1852, foreign mercenaries served in the ranks, and even staged a revolt of their own. Military service, stigmatized, was known as the &quot;blood tribute&quot;.

In December 1824, the nominal force numbered 30 thousand men of the 1st line (paid troops) and 40 thousand of the 2nd line (unpaid militia and some paid police, veterans and irregular troops). Lack of training and politicized recruitment limited the military capacity of the 2nd line. The 1st line was organized into regiments, battalions and some smaller units called &quot;corps&quot;. In December 1824, it comprised three grenadier battalions, 28 (light infantry) battalions, seven cavalry regiments, five horse artillery corps and 12 field artillery corps. Five brigades briefly existed in the Court (Rio de Janeiro), but throughout the century the army did not maintain large formations in peacetime. Provincial &quot;commanders of arms&quot; were subordinated to local governments, whose presidents were in turn appointed by the Emperor. This organization would undergo numerous changes. The structure of the Secretariat of State for War Affairs was small, and there was no general management body for the army in peacetime.

The army was initially an instrument of emperor Pedro I&#x27;s authority, closing the Constituent Assembly in 1823 (the Night of Agony) and suppressing a separatist movement, the Confederation of the Equator. Its greatest difficulty was in the Cisplatine War, when it faced logistical obstacles and a high desertion rate.

==== Regency period ====

At the beginning of the regency period (1831–1840), the Liberal Party, predominant in politics, did not accept a large-scale professional military force, associating it, since previous years, with military losses in Cisplatina, mercenary revolts and the possibility of a coup. The 2nd line troops were replaced by the National Guard, which was considered civilian and was outside the jurisdiction of the Secretariat of War. The army did not have a monopoly on legitimate violence, which was shared with the National Guard and the justices of the peace, parish priests and police chiefs, who had authority over recruitment. Personnel were drastically reduced: in 1837, the entire force numbered just 6,320 men.

Faced with the numerous rebellions of the period, the political elite realized that territorial fragmentation of the country was the greatest danger and could not be controlled with the National Guard alone. Thus began the reconstruction of the army, which put down the Cabanagem, Balaiada, Sabinada and Ragamuffin uprisings. It is for this reason that the Duke of Caxias, the patron of the army, is known as the &quot;Peacemaker&quot;. The army&#x27;s official history emphasizes its role in ensuring national integrity.

==== Second reign ====

By 1850 the political consensus was already in favor of the army. The force grew to 15–16 thousand men. By the 1851 organization, the army had eight rifle battalions, six &quot;caçadores&quot; battalions, four light cavalry regiments, one horse artillery regiment, and four foot artillery battalions. These would be the &quot;mobile corps&quot;, intended for operations in any region. A series of small corps and companies were designated &quot;garrison corps&quot;, responsible for the internal security of the provinces. Officers&#x27; careers were professionalized from 1850 onwards, with the adoption of formal criteria for advancement in the hierarchy and mandatory education in military courses. The sons of the civilian nobility, who preferred to serve in the National Guard, gradually disappeared. Except in Rio Grande do Sul, officers were recruited from social groups with lower incomes, especially children of military personnel.

With internal conflicts quelled, the Empire of Brazil used the army in external interventions in the Río de la Plata region. In 1851–1852, four army divisions, the National Guard and regional Argentine allies campaigned in the Platine War. The intervention was successful, but the risk of war remained in the region, and the government did not pay adequate attention to defense. When the Paraguayan War began in 1864, the Paraguayan Army had 60 thousand men, compared to 16 thousand in Brazil, whose war effort was marked by improvisation. Technologies of the Second Industrial Revolution, such as the rifle, the telegraph and the observation balloon, coexisted with Napoleonic tactics, such as the infantry square, the &quot;cult of the bayonet&quot;, cavalry as a shock weapon and artillery fired at close range, with grapeshot. Lack of cartographic knowledge, good use of the terrain by the Paraguayans, logistical difficulties and epidemics delayed a decisive victory in the period before December 1868.

The campaign was long and exhausting, on a much larger scale than the War of Independence. Ground forces were expanded to 135,000 soldiers, including 59,000 from the National Guard and 55,000 Homeland Volunteers. At least initially, there was great popular enthusiasm for military service. Three army corps were fielded. The army&#x27;s official history recognizes Paraguay a second historical milestone after Guararapes. The institution became aware of its importance for the country, but it did not benefit after the victory in 1870: the budget was drastically reduced. Officers&#x27; nonconformity with political leaders grew. The participation of slaves in the struggle brought abolitionism to fore.

A new military service law attempted to reform recruitment in 1874, but was not enforced due to popular resistance by the so-called &quot;list rippers&quot;. In the same year, officer education was completely separated from Civil Engineering and concentrated at the Military School of Praia Vermelha.

By the end of the Empire, the officers were divided between &quot;scientists&quot; and &quot;tarimbeiros&quot;: the latter, veterans of the Paraguayan War, normally without a degree, and the former, trained at Praia Vermelha. The curriculum, unrelated to military disciplines, did not produce good troop commanders but rather intellectuals, engineers, bureaucrats and politicians, who competed with civilians with degrees. The 1888 organization defined 27 infantry units, ten cavalry units, four field artillery units, four position artillery units and two engineering units. The distinction between mobile and garrison corps disappeared. Units were very small, but would theoretically be expanded to a &quot;war footing&quot; when necessary, although there was no mobilization system.

With no apparent external danger, the authorities used the army in public order, capturing fugitive slaves and controlling elections, which outraged the new generation of officers. New positivist ideas were spreading. In the 1880s, a series of incidents with civilian authorities, known as the Military Question, strained the army&#x27;s relationship with the monarchy. The army had already become a political force, capable of making a minister resign. In the end, young officers, old leaders and civilians proclaimed the republic in a military coup that deposed emperor Pedro II.

=== 20th century ===

==== First Brazilian Republic ====

Until 1894, a period marked by the Federalist Revolution and the Navy Revolts, the new republican regime began under the tutelage of the army (the so-called Republic of the Sword). The military were not united and lost power to the civilian oligarchies, which were alienated from the officer class and transformed the Public Forces of the most powerful states into &quot;small armies&quot;, a major obstacle to the expansion of the Armed Forces&#x27; power. The period was one of struggle to assert its relevance. In this context, the federal army guaranteed central power against regionalist tendencies.

By the 1890s, the army&#x27;s operational capacity had fallen to a level sometimes inferior to the insurgents it faced. This and foreign policy fears sparked a military reform movement. The First World War (1914–1918) favored reformism, although direct Brazilian participation in land operations was limited to a mission of 26 officers to the French Army. Seeking a successful army as a reference, groups of officers (known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot;) were sent to intern in the Imperial German Army in 1906–1912, and a French Military Mission was hired to advise on the reorganization of the Brazilian Army from 1920 to 1940. Strategic planning had the Argentine Army as its hypothetical enemy, at the time more modern and supported by a railway network that was denser than the Brazilian one. Armament also had to be imported, as the arms industry was very limited.

By 1919, the training of officers at the Military School of Realengo was already very different from Praia Vermelha: a curriculum dominated by professional subjects, field exercises and strict discipline, training officers with a strong sense of distinction from civilians. The introduction of compulsory military service through the Sortition Law, in 1916 allowed the abolition of the National Guard two years later, changed the army&#x27;s relationship with society, made recruitment more judicious and allowed a gradual and continuous expansion of personnel. In the long term, this strengthened central power at the expense of regional oligarchies. Military Aviation was introduced and remained in the army until 1941, when it was absorbed by the newly created Brazilian Air Force.

The organization of these forces in peacetime was rudimentary until 1908, when commanders began to build a modern order of battle with regiments, brigades and divisions. In 1921 there were five infantry divisions, three cavalry divisions, a mixed brigade and independent units. The actual organization differed greatly from the formal one, with many incomplete regiments. Throughout the century, each new organization was somewhat fictional. The force was estimated at 37 thousand men in 1919.

The operational history of the period has two major conflicts arising from social issues in the interior of the country: the War of Canudos (1897) and the Contestado War (1912–1916). In Canudos the force faced peasants without military training, but the terrain was adverse and well used by the opponent. The war concluded with the settlement of Belo Monte, in the interior of Bahia, burnt and littered by the bodies of thousands of inhabitants. The army suffered immense casualties. In the 1920s the army had difficulty suppressing a mobile enemy, the Prestes Column, as its French-influenced doctrine was for a conflict in the style of the Western Front of the First World War. On the other hand, the rebels were unable to threaten Rio de Janeiro. In 1924 there was an experience of urban combat and the bombing of São Paulo by army artillery.

Military revolts and interventions in politics marked the period, such as the proclamation of the republic itself, the Manifesto of the Thirteen Generals, Hermism/Salvations Policy, the Sergeants&#x27; Revolt of 1915, &quot;tenentism&quot; and the Revolution of 1930, which ended the First Republic. Most of the revolts involved the lower ranks and did not represent the army as a whole, damaging the hierarchy. The &quot;Pacifying Movement&quot;, a military coup that made the 1930 Revolution triumph, differed in that it was planned by high levels of the army and navy. This was made possible by organizational changes, such as the development of the Army General Staff.

==== Vargas Era ====

Getúlio Vargas&#x27; first period in power (1930–1945) was one of great modernization and expansion for the Brazilian Army, which was introduced to the center of political power. The military received investments and positions in the administration. But the army was deeply divided. Revolts by sergeants and corporals threatened the hierarchy, to the point of overthrowing the government of Piauí in 1931, and the officers also rebelled. A large part of the São Paulo garrison joined the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, which was defeated due to the loyalty of the rest of the Armed Forces and state governments to Vargas. Army units rose up in the Communist Uprising of 1935, which was quickly put down. In 1938 the army also participated in the repression of the Integralist Uprising.

To homogenize the institution, the government and army leaders carried out several purges of the officer ranks. Revolts by young officers became less and less likely for organizational and technical reasons. General Góis Monteiro, considered the &quot;first great ideologue&quot; of the institution, wrote about the need for the &quot;army&#x27;s politics&quot;, not &quot;politics in the army&quot;. The military aligned with the authoritarian and developmentalist ideals of the Estado Novo dictatorship, established by Vargas with a coup in 1937. The army served as the strong arm of a centralized State, and the Public Forces were placed under the control of the Ministry of War, putting an end to the phenomenon of &quot;state armies&quot;. Military engineers participated in the development of the steel and oil industries in the country. The concept of security, for the army, had been expanded, encompassing planning, energy, transport and industrialization.

According to EME studies on the 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution, the army had evolved in its doctrine and organization, but was still unprepared to face an external aggressor, as evidenced by the deficiency in the ammunition industry. The Chaco War (1932– 1935) between Bolivia and Paraguay helped the army to continue expanding its numbers, which exceeded 60 thousand men. Anti-aircraft artillery and mobile coastal artillery were implemented. Later on, Brazil&#x27;s entry into the Second World War in 1942 gave the army its &quot;only experience [...] in a conventional war along the lines of a total war&quot;. Fighting alongside the Allies, Brazil received weapons (via Lend-Lease) and sent officers to study in the United States. The army&#x27;s strength grew from around 80,000 men to 200,000 in 1944, organized into eight infantry divisions, three cavalry divisions and a mixed brigade.

The army&#x27;s participation consisted of reinforcing the northeastern salient and sending the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB) to the Italian Campaign. The Brazilian government promised three infantry divisions for the war effort, but due to mobilization difficulties, it was only possible to send the 1st Expeditionary Infantry Division (1st DIE), subordinate to the IV Corps of the United States Army. The Battle of Monte Castello, which it fought in 1944–1945, was not the most important of the IV Corps, but it stood out within the experience of the FEB, which overcame its inexperience and won after several demoralizing defeats in the offensive. Tactics changed from French to American: from frontal attacks to flanking enemy positions and attacking in multiple directions. The FEB was demobilized even before returning to Brazil, as it was considered a political threat. This did not prevent the ousting of Vargas by the Armed Forces in 1945, after which democracy was restored. The army had changed a lot, and in addition to its technical modernization, had become politically autonomous and convinced that it could form a well-trained elite.

==== Fourth Brazilian Republic ====

The Brazilian Army adopted American doctrine, organization, manuals and methods after World War II, although the absorption was partial, as older materiel of European origin and French concepts remained. New equipment was obtained through the Brazil–United States Treaty. Since the war, motorized vehicles began to replace carts and mules. The use of armored vehicles, until then very limited, was consolidated. The training of sergeants was centralized and professionalized at the &quot;Escola de Sergentos das Armas&quot; (Combatant Sergeants&#x27; School). From the 1950s onwards, sergeant revolts disappeared. The movements of enlisted personnel in the rest of the Armed Forces had less repercussions on the army.

In 1960 the force comprised seven infantry divisions, four cavalry divisions, one armored division, the core of an airborne division, a mixed brigade and a School-Unit Group. These forces were grouped into four Military Zones in 1946, later called Armies in 1956, equivalent to the current Military Area Commands. The new structure was sophisticated, but the doctrine did not correspond to reality. Infantry divisions were supposed to have 15,000 men each, but averaged 5,500. Officials feared Brazil&#x27;s military fragility. On the other hand, the relative power of neighboring countries was declining. The hypothesis of war against Argentina lost relevance and coexisted with concerns of the Cold War: nuclear war, revolutionary war and peace operations, of which the first with Brazilian participation was the Suez battalion (1957–1967).

The institution&#x27;s political participation was continuous. In 1955, Minister of War Henrique Teixeira Lott carried out a &quot;preventative coup&quot;, opposing the Navy and Air Force, to ensure the inauguration of president Juscelino Kubitschek. In 1961, the three military ministers (army, navy and air force) tried to veto the inauguration of João Goulart as president, but a split in the army allowed the victory of the inauguration cause. Finally, the 1964 coup d&#x27;état began with the main commands of the army in loyalist hands, but officers defected &quot;en masse&quot; and the president was removed without a fight. Military personnel aligned with the deposed government were purged, including 22.5% of the generals serving in 1964. The ideological basis of Goulart&#x27;s opponents was anti-communism, developed since 1935, and the doctrine of revolutionary war.

==== Military dictatorship ====

In the subsequent military dictatorship (1964–1985) the center of political power was occupied by generals, although the institutions formally remained those of a liberal democracy. Generals disputed among themselves and were challenged by junior officers. Political repression activities were centralized in the army, whose Internal Defense Operations Centers (; CODI) coordinated the Armed Forces and the police. Military personnel were responsible for illegal detentions, torture, executions, forced disappearances and concealment of corpses, and the army played a fundamental role in the genocide of the Waimiri-Atroari indigenous people.

The armed struggle against the dictatorship was faced mainly by high-ranking intelligence bodies, such as the CODI and the Army Information Center (; CIEx). Large-scale use of conventional troops for counterinsurgency occurred rarely and was ineffective. The Araguaia Guerrilla (1972–1975), the most extensive rural insurgency of the period, could only be defeated by the principle of &quot;fighting guerrilla with guerrilla&quot;: extensive intelligence work, infiltrated plainclothes patrols and the participation of the Special Forces Company.

The &quot;economic miracle&quot; allowed the re-equipment of the army in the period 1969–1974, with a focus on conventional warfare. Counterinsurgency did not make the military give up external defense, in part as a way of demonstrating the state&#x27;s prestige. There were two hypotheses of war: a &quot;revolutionary war in South America&quot; and a war between the Western and Communist blocs, with Brazil contributing an expeditionary army corps to the Western bloc. Equipment inventories were rapidly nationalized thanks to the development of companies in the national arms industry, such as Engesa. Rifles, machine guns, artillery and armor were replaced by 1980.

After a century of emulating foreign armies, the Brazilian Army sought a doctrine more suited to local needs. The order of battle was reorganized, suppressing infantry and artillery regiments and creating brigades, which became the main large maneuver units, a system that still remains in the 21st century. Total strength was at 170 thousand in 1970. In 1980 the army fielded 13 ordinary infantry, one airborne, two jungle infantry, three armored infantry, one armored cavalry and four mechanized cavalry brigades. But not all goals were met, and there remained a technological delay in relation to the Argentine Army.

==== Redemocratization and post-Cold War ====

Argentina&#x27;s defeat in the Falklands War in 1982 shocked the Brazilian military. The United States did not support a South American country against an extracontinental power, and the Brazilian Armed Forces would clearly be out of date in a similar conflict. Basic equipment was lacking and operational capacity was very low. The EME began to study the hypothesis of a war with a country from the Western bloc, economically and militarily superior to Brazil, in the Amazon region, at the same time that it planned the &quot;army of the future&quot;, devising the &quot;Força Terrestre 90&quot; (FT 90), &quot;Força Terrestre 2000&quot; and &quot;Força Terrestre do Século XXI&quot; programs.

After the end of the military dictatorship in 1985, the army distanced itself from political-ideological confrontation and began executing the FT 90 and its successors. By the end of the 1980s, the social and economic standards of officers had declined, and by the beginning of the following decade, the army&#x27;s strategic priorities had become undefined. Traditional threats (communism and Argentina) were giving way to non-traditional ones. The United States Army once again became the &quot;model to be followed&quot; by winning the 1991 Gulf War, inspiring the Brazilian &quot;Delta Doctrine&quot;. The Brazilian arms industry collapsed.

In 1991, the incursion of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) into Brazilian territory and the subsequent Operation Traíra redoubled attention in the Amazon. Army officers viewed transnational crime, Colombian guerrillas, and environmental and indigenous issues as possible pretexts for foreign intervention in the region. At the same time, public authorities often use the army for operations to guarantee law and order in places such as Rio de Janeiro, as well as for subsidiary missions, which are, in a certain way, accommodated by the political class. Abroad, participation in international UN missions increased.

===21st century===

Total personnel grew from 194,000 in 1985 to 238,000 in 2007, below the large quantitative expansion planned in the 1980s, due to budget restrictions. The army of 2007, despite not being much larger than that of 1985, was more specialized, with new technologies. Electronic warfare capabilities were acquired and the roster of rapid action forces was expanded with the new Army Aviation Brigade (1989), airmobile infantry (1995) and the expansion of special operations forces (2003).

The first Brazilian main battle tanks were acquired, the Leopard 1 and M60 models, and the structure of Brazilian armored brigades was made equivalent to their Argentine counterparts, despite good bilateral relations. An attempt was made to reduce dependence on compulsory military service, but the costs of professional soldiers limited the measures. The Amazon Military Command&#x27;s two brigades of jungle infantry were reinforced by another three.

In 2012 some generals gave the press an overview of the army, describing its aging equipment and technological obsolescence. Since 2004, only 9 to 10% of the budget was available for funding and investments, with the remainder being spent on personnel. The guidelines for the Army Transformation Process had just been published, with ambitious goals for the year 2030, just like the planners of the 1980s, who had defined 2010 as the year in which the &quot;army of the future&quot; would exist. The drivers of the Transformation Process are strategic projects/programs, such as ASTROS 2020, for the expansion of missile and rocket artillery (Astros II) and the development of a cruise missile (AV-TM 300); Guarani armored vehicles, with a new family of wheeled armor; Anti-Air Defense, with the renewal of low-altitude anti-aircraft artillery and acquisition of medium-altitude artillery; and the Integrated Border Monitoring System, Cyber Defense and others.

A notable peacekeeping operation during this period was the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) (2007–2017). Most of the Brazilian battalion commanders in Haiti achieved generalship.

The occupation of Complexo do Alemão in 2010 was the largest law and order operation since the promulgation of the 1988 Constitution, and was considered more difficult than Haiti. When confronting organized crime in Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s favelas, the military had to change tactics and equipment. They recognize the difficulty of police work, in which they are not specialized and there is a risk of collateral damage. There were protests by local residents against abuses of authority, torture and excessive shooting and use of tear gas. In the federal intervention in Rio de Janeiro in 2018, an army general held the position of Secretary of Security in Rio de Janeiro, and other generals held roles in that secretariat and in the federal intervention office.

Strategic projects suffered from contingencies and cuts in military spending resulting from the economic crisis of the mid-2010s, and by 2019 their deadlines were already being extended, some until 2040. When the Guyana-Venezuela crisis began in 2023, the army reinforced Roraima, but still did not have cruise missiles, medium-altitude anti-aircraft defense or Centauro II tank destroyers available.

==Personnel==

Military personnel may be on active or reserve status. If active, they may be career military personnel (with guaranteed or presumed lifetime status) or temporary personnel. The number established by decree for the army in 2023 was 212,217 active military personnel, of which 149 were generals, 29,220 other officers, 46,773 warrant officers and sergeants and 136,005 corporals and privates. Out of 214 thousand in 2023, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) quantified 112 thousand conscripts. There are much lower estimates of the proportion of conscripts (30%). In addition to active duty personnel, the IISS estimated the reserve at 1,340,000 military personnel in 2023, but did not distinguish between the three branches; Frank McCann estimated over a million Army reservists in 2017. The Brazilian Army is historically one of the largest in the region.

=== Ranks and uniforms ===

Hierarchy and discipline are formally defined as the basis of the organization of the Armed Forces. In the army the hierarchy comprises 19 levels, called &quot;&quot;postos&quot; on the upper levels (officers), and &quot;graduações&quot; on the lower ones (enlisted personnel). &quot;Postos&quot; and &quot;graduações&quot; are grouped into social coexistence circles: from highest to lowest, they are the circles of general officers, senior officers, intermediate officers, junior officers, warrant officers and sergeants, and corporals and privates. In peacetime, the highest rank is that of army general. The rank of marshal may be created in wartime. Enlisted personnel can be called &quot;graduados&quot;&quot;, except for privates, which form the lowest level of the hierarchy and are considered &quot;non-graduated&quot; military personnel.

The greatest separation in the career is between officers and &quot;praças&quot; (enlisted men), as the officers are the active leading element, trained from the beginning for command, while the enlisted men are trained to apply orders. Aside from this, there are mechanisms for merit-based social mobility, and the army emphasizes that every general was once a cadet, that is, a student at the officer academy. 

Respect for the hierarchy must be maintained even outside of service and even upon retirement. There are rules of coexistence between different military circles (for example, sergeants and officers do not sit at the same table), and disrespecting them is known as &quot;hierarchical promiscuity&quot;. There is always a superior and a subordinate between two soldiers. Within the same position, the difference is seniority. In the case of officers from the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras, seniority is defined by the date of the last promotion or, if it is the same, which is common among officers of the same class, by the classification (final grade average) at the academy.

Rank is indicated by insignia on the uniform, along with military organization badges and course badges and brevets. The most famous color in uniforms is olive green, which is one of the main elements of the army&#x27;s visual identity. First adopted in 1931 in place of khaki, the color was also used on field uniforms until the 1990s, when the use of camouflage became widespread. Olive green is the standard color for berets, but specific troops distinguish themselves by different colors: red for paratroopers, brindle for jungle troops, marine blue for aviation, gray for mountain specialists, beige for the airmobile brigade and steel blue for officer and sergeant training schools. Some units wear traditional historical uniforms, such as the Presidential Guard Battalion and the 1st Guard Cavalry Regiment.

=== Military instruction ===
Military teaching and instruction can be defined as the army&#x27;s main missions in peacetime. This system encompasses education, instruction, and research. Privates&#x27; and corporals&#x27; activities correspond to elementary education, sergeants&#x27; to secondary, technical or higher education (technologist) and officers&#x27; to higher education. Practically all military organizations have some responsibility for training soldiers. Active-duty organizations have a fixed personnel, but annually train a variable number of reservists. There are organizations exclusively focused on reservists: the Reserve Officer Training Bodies (; OFOR), which consist of the Preparation Centers (; CPOR) and the Preparation Nuclei (; NPOR), and the . Other organizations train career military personnel (officers and sergeants). By law, military education is regulated exclusively by the army itself.

Officers in the military education line, who carry out the army&#x27;s core activity (warfare), enter the institution early, in the equivalent of the first year of higher education. After the Army Cadet Preparatory School (; EsPCEx), in Campinas, they graduate from AMAN, in Resende. Officers&#x27; careers are organized into study cycles; AMAN trains officer candidates, a degree from the Officer Improvement School (; EsAO) is necessary for promotion to major, and a degree from the Army Command and General Staff School (; ECEME), to brigadier general. The AMAN degree is a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Military Sciences, EsAO&#x27;s degree is a master&#x27;s degree in Military Operations, and ECEME&#x27;s degree is a doctorate in Military Policy, Strategy and Administration; ECEME also offers a post-doctorate program.

Career combat sergeants graduate in two years, the first in one of the thirteen Army Technological School Units (; UETE) spread across the country and the second in the Combatant Sergeants&#x27; School (; ESA), Logistics Sergeants School (; EsSLog) or Army Aviation Instruction Center (; CIAvEx). EsAO&#x27;s equivalent is the Sergeants&#x27; Branches Improvement School (; EASA). The Military Institute of Engineering (; IME), Army School of Health and Complementary Training (; EsFCEx) and the School of Specialized Instruction (; EsIE), among others, also participate in teaching sergeants and/or officers.

The schools are complemented by specialization courses, extension courses and internships. In 2006, there were 66 specialization courses for officers and 76 for sergeants, eight extension courses for officers and six for sergeants, 47 internships for officers and 32 for sergeants. This even covers education that is not strictly military, such as language courses offered by the Center for Personnel Studies. In the most difficult and coveted operational courses, such as those for commandos, jungle warriors and pathfinders, the rate of voluntary dismissal is high.

The Brazilian Army also maintains twelve Military Schools, at primary and secondary level, but their students do not necessarily pursue a military career. These schools offer the possibility of keeping officers&#x27; children in military education from a very early age. The Military Instruction Schools (; EsIM) are also secondary education, designed to allow students to carry out military service without interrupting their studies.

According to the army, the training is rigorous, but ill-treatment, violence against lower ranks and bodily injuries are isolated cases and the instructions are controlled to avoid risks. Cases of violence by instructors exist; from 2005 to June 2015, the Rio de Janeiro Military Court judged 299 incidents in the army, navy and air force. Critics point to the institution&#x27;s corporatism as an obstacle to complaints. The aggressors are tried in the Military Court, but the compensation is paid by the federal government. An emblematic case was that of cadet Márcio Lapoente da Silveira, who died during training at AMAN in 1990, leading to a complaint to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The superior officer involved later reached the rank of colonel.

=== Branches, cadres and services ===
Troops are subdivided into several specialties, called &quot;branches&quot; (), &quot;cadres&quot; () and &quot;services&quot; (), according to their missions and characteristics. Seven of them, the military education line, directly carry out military operations, and their officers are exclusively trained at AMAN; they are the infantry, cavalry, engineering, artillery and communications branches, the Quartermaster Service () and the Ordnance Cadre (). Colloquially, they are called &quot;&quot;. Infantry and Cavalry are the so-called &quot;base branches&quot; (), as they come into direct contact with the enemy. Artillery directly participates in combat, but from a distance, providing fire support. Engineering and communications are support branches, but they also act directly on the battlefield. Quartermasters and Ordnance are the theater of operations&#x27;s logistics.

The other areas of officers, with different origins, are the Military Engineers (; QEM), Auxiliary Officers (; QAO) and Complementary Officers (; QCO) and the Health and Religious Assistance Services. Army Aviation, which is not a branch, has officers from different branches. Warrant officers and sergeants belong to their own Military Qualifications (; QMS), covering, in addition to the seven areas of AMAN, Communications Maintenance, Topography, Aviation Maintenance, Aviation Support, Music and Health.

Officers and NCOs choose the branch in which they will serve during their training. This decision accompanies the soldier for the rest of his career and determines where he will serve and what commands he will be able to exercise. However, more than a specialty, the branch is a social atmosphere of its own, determining the soldier&#x27;s companions for the remainder of his career. Along with the class in which an officer graduated, the branch is the basic component of an officer&#x27;s identity. Temperament and disposition are presumed from branch collar insignia. Each branch has a &quot;spirit&quot;, an association between the personal characteristics required in military operations and the individual&#x27;s personality: &quot;rustic&quot; infantrymen, &quot;fast&quot; cavalrymen, &quot;methodical&quot; artillerymen, and so on. There are even negative stereotypes attributed to each branch by the others.

The best students, based on the general classification, choose their branch first, and the last ones are &quot;compelled&quot; to fill the remaining vacancies. Until the 1990s, the students&#x27; preferred branches were infantry, cavalry and artillery, prestigious for being the combat ones, to which the most famous generals in the history of the army belonged. From then on, the Quartermaster and Ordnance, areas closest to civilian activity, became the most sought after by the new generations of cadets.

=== Officers ===

==== Subdivisions ====
Career officers from the military education line, also called &quot;AMAN officers&quot; or &quot;academy officers&quot;, are the backbone and elite of the institution, in which the army invests to represent it legitimately and, in the future, lead it. They are the majority of generals and all army generals, the top of the hierarchy. But there are several other officer careers.

2nd category reserve officers (R/2) are recruited through OFOR. The Military Engineers Cadre (QEM) (not be confused with the military line Engineering Branch), is trained at the Military Engineering Institute and has skills closer to those of a university-trained engineer. A QEM engineer works in science, technology and the production of weapons. The Auxiliary Officer Cadre (QAO) is made up of sergeants and warrant officers promoted to the officer ranks. The Army&#x27;s School of Health and Complementary Training trains the officers of the Complementary Cadre of Officers (QCO), Health Cadre (QSau) and Military Chaplains Cadre; QCO officers already have a prior degree in a civil higher education course, and military chaplains have prior training as Catholic or evangelical ministers. Temporary Technical Officers (; OTT), also with prior academic training, are recruited after an internship and remain for up to eight years.

==== Profile ====
The majority of officers come from middle-class families, often with military parents, in a pattern of endogenous recruitment that has existed since at least the 20th century. Increasingly, in the last decades of the 20th century, these military parents are junior officers and enlisted men seeking social advancement through lifelong public service. The children of senior officers often attend civilian universities. Salaries have historically maintained officers in the middle class.

Young people do not enter AMAN thinking about leaving the military career in the future, or if they do, they are conditioned to change their minds. Officer status will follow each person until death. Permanent availability, exclusive dedication (i.e, the legal impossibility of assuming other positions), geographic mobility and restriction of labor rights are the characteristics of the career, according to the army. Geographic mobility means a nomadic career, with constant transfers. The result is a homogeneous army, but this brings difficulties for the officer&#x27;s family and prevents rooting in local society. Due to exclusive dedication, the army advised against taking degrees outside the military, but this is changing in the 21st century.

An academy officer&#x27;s contacts are established primarily within the institution. Officers and their families share a large part of their living, leisure and study environments, and the institution promotes internal social interaction, in which wives are fundamental. The family&#x27;s presentation and behavior influence how an officer is qualified in professional life. The military family is also a bridge between the army and society as a whole. The notion of &quot;Military Family&quot; can be broad, encompassing military personnel and their families.

The profile of QCO officers is different, as they bring the worldview of academia and broader society into the army. R/2 officers have a different social origin: they are mainly university students, and the declared objective of the course is the &quot;education of citizens, future members of the national elite and who have knowledge mainly of the values that are the bases of the Brazilian Army&quot;.

==== Career ====
Out of a class of 400 AMAN officer candidates, only four become army generals. Rising through officer ranks takes decades and involves the principles of seniority, merit, choice, and in wartime, bravery. An example of a successful officer, Fernando Azevedo e Silva graduated from AMAN in 1976 and was promoted to army general in 2014. The political-military leaders of the 1960s graduated from the Military School of Realengo in the 1910s to 1930s.

An officer&#x27;s year of formation reveals his rank, his AMAN class (a group with great familiarity with each other and their own name, such as the &quot;Independence Centennial&quot; of 1989), and within it, his seniority. There is a period of eight to ten years from AMAN to EsAO and three to ten years from there to ECEME. About a third of each class manages to enter ECEME, through which officers enter the Active Duty General Staff Cadre (; QEMA). This opens up advisory and decision-making functions to them, and therefore, greater prestige and power. The other officers are part of the General Supplementary Cadre (; QSG), where they will have bureaucratic and/or executive functions until the end of their career. Only QEMA officers achieve generalship.

Once it&#x27;s time for promotions to general, most of the class requests a transfer to the paid reserve. Only a minority is promoted to brigadier general, a political decision whose criterion is choice. The decision involves the Army High Command and the President of Brazil, who traditionally respects the names indicated by the High Command. Promoting a candidate junior to his peers usually pushes them to the reserve. An officer spends a maximum of twelve years as an active duty general.

=== Warrant officers and sergeants ===
The motto &quot;sergeant, the fundamental link between the command and the troops&quot; summarizes the role assigned by the army to this rank. The sergeant is both a leader and executor. In general, he is the one who maintains direct contact with the privates, for whom he has the responsibility to discipline. His training aims to create a practical executor, who, if necessary, puts into practice what the officer thinks, but does not know how to execute.

Sergeants have never been an elite, but their training is a priority, albeit secondary to that of officers. A career sergeant is expected to have obedience to officers, critical thinking, greater culture and technical-professional preparation than his subordinates and a robust professional identity. The students at the Sergeants&#x27; Branches School are, for the most part, the children of civilians, but many have previous military experience, especially in mandatory military service. They are older than AMAN cadets (18–28 years old upon joining, most often in the 20–24 range) and from families with lower incomes.

Officers and sergeants in a military organization come from all over the country and transfer throughout their career. Among sergeants, this is less frequent and over shorter distances. In his career, marked by training, specialization and improvement courses, the sergeant acquires professional stability after ten years of service. Having graduated as a third sergeant, he can rise to sub-lieutenant or captain of the Auxiliary Officer Cadre. There are also temporary sergeants who were privates that rose through military service and temporary technical sergeants, who are volunteers incorporated through an internship.

=== Corporals and privates ===

Privates in combat units are incorporated through initial mandatory military service. Enlistment is mandatory for men the year they turn 18. Of the three singular forces, the army is the one that most depends on compulsory military service. Conscripts are a considerable part of its force, unlike the navy and air force, in which they are a small minority. There are several alternatives to this type of military service, including the , dispersed in municipalities across the country, where reservist privates, known as (shooters), have part-time training.

Military Service Boards, the lowest administrative level of conscription, are present throughout the entire country. However, only in tributary municipalities, chosen for geographic and economic reasons, will enlisted men continue to the next stages of the process. Each military organization will receive recruits from the surrounding areas. By the end of the process, around 5% of those enlisted are sent into active service. In 2012, 92% were volunteers, according to the Army.

The official justifications for the system are the same as those made by its defenders (such as Olavo Bilac) when compulsory military service was implemented at the beginning of the 20th century. According to Enzo Martins Peri, the army commander in 2007–2015, the current model is &quot;more democratic, universal and, socially, more fair and equitable&quot; and complements the &quot;formation of citizenship in the spiritual, moral, physical, intellectual, professional and civic aspects&quot;. The army seeks to mold recruits into an ideal of an orderly, productive and patriotic citizen and even undertakes professional qualification initiatives, but this social function only applies to a small minority of enlisted personnel called up for service. In the case of the , the low frequency of military exercises, leaving most of the time to cleaning, maintaining facilities and civic-social activities, can be a factor of frustration. 

The ideal of compulsory military service as a republican leveler, in which all social classes serve, does not correspond to reality. Young people are mostly recruited from low-income families, for whom military service is an alternative to the lack of opportunities in the job market. A recruit&#x27;s pay, however, is less than minimum wage.

The recruits, or variable force privates(; EV), serve for one year, during which they are meant to be transformed into a reservist fit for combat. The recruit is only considered ready in the last part of the cycle, the training period, which lasts around four months. This creates an operational gap of two-thirds of the year. One of the solutions is to vary the schedules so that, throughout the year, some units are operational and others are not. It is not clear in which part of the year the entire army would be trained and ready.

Privates are temporary personnel and do not pursue a career. Volunteers interested in serving for more than twelve months can re-engage, that is, extend their time of service, depending on vacancies and the army&#x27;s judgment. The reengaged private moves from the EV to the Base Core (; NB), which also includes career military personnel. NB privates undertake professional training and advancement courses, and may be promoted to corporal or temporary sergeant. Re-engagements can be requested annually up to a maximum of 96 months of service. The goal set in 1998 was to have a workforce of 75% NB and 25% EV. Some brigades have more professional personnel; the Parachute Infantry Brigade is made up entirely of volunteers, and the 26th Parachute Infantry Battalion is made up exclusively of NB personnel.

=== Women ===
Women are exempt from mandatory military service in Brazil, but may volunteer as career or temporary military personnel. The Brazilian Army was the first in South America to allow women as career soldiers. 

The first formal participation of women in the Brazilian Army was in 1943, with FEB nurses. Female participation returned in 1992, following changes in society and the opening of the navy and air force to women. Initially occupying administrative and technical positions in QCO, throughout the decade women were also admitted to the Health Staff, the Military Engineers Staff and the temporary officers and sergeants staff.

EsPCEx welcomed its first female students in 2017, opening the military line to women, but they can only choose the Quartermaster and Ordnance branches. The army plans to open the communications branch to women in 2024. Women made up about 6% of active personnel in 2023.

=== Reserve ===

At the end of active service, soldiers join the reserve, from where they can still be called up in a war or emergency. Officers and NCOs with at least 30 years of service, known as R1 military personnel, join the paid reserve. Only upon reaching an age limit or physical incapacity is a paid reserve officer or NCO released from mobilization and, instead of a reservist, becomes a . Ostracism and difficulty adjusting to civilian life are among the army&#x27;s reasons for financing its pensioners and reservists.

Temporary military personnel are part of the unpaid reserve. For five years after the end of service, the &quot;availability&quot; period, they are subject to the Reserve Presentation Exercise (; EXAR). Every year, a certain number of reservists are called up to renew their skills and participate in an operation. According to historian Frank McCann, the reserve is immense, but there has never been a full call-up, and therefore, it is not known whether it would be successful. There is no organized reserve like in the United States, with reserve units responsible for preserving the skills of these soldiers.

In principle, the 1988 Brazilian constitution designates the Military Police (; PMs) and Military Fire Brigades (; CBMs) as auxiliary and reserve forces of the army, although in practice they remain separate entities, at state rather than federal scope. The military police, unlike the Armed Forces, deal with the Brazilian population and not with an external enemy. The army controls these institutions through the General Inspectorate of Military Police (; IGPM). The army&#x27;s interference in the PM&#x27;s internal affairs has reduced since the end of the military dictatorship, but it still has veto powers. The IISS includes the military police in the category of &quot;gendarmerie &amp; paramilitary&quot;, estimating 395 thousand men.

== Traditions and culture ==
The army clings to its values and identity even as it modernizes; in this sense, it is a conservative institution. Incorporating individuals from society transforms them more than they transform it. Lieutenant colonel and sociologist Everton Araújo dos Santos defined it: &quot;conservative, traditional, hermetic, austere, reserved and averse to investigations&quot;, having &quot;very well delineated contours of the social roles to be played by each of the individuals who compose it&quot;. The army can also be conservative externally, in relation to civil society and the State.

Military values are based on a distinction between the &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; worlds; the military world is considered more organized, honest, and patriotic than the civilian one. According to the Military Statute, the &quot;essential manifestations of military value&quot; are patriotism, &quot;civic virtue and the cult of historical traditions&quot;, &quot;faith in the elevated mission of the Armed Forces&quot;, &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, love for the profession and technical-professional improvement.

To protect itself from external influences, the army offers services so that &quot;upon entering it, its member [can], within and throughout his life, in isolation and protected in a familiar and sufficient world, see a good part of his needs satisfied, and those of his dependents&quot;. The army&#x27;s own healthcare system, FUSEx, covers all healthcare needs and is mandatory for military personnel and pensioners to participate in. When traveling, officers, sergeants, and dependents can be accommodated in army transit hotels. Catholic priests and evangelical pastors are assimilated as officers to cover religious service. There are leisure areas exclusive to the &quot;internal public&quot;, such as the Imbuí beach, in Niterói. It is possible to reach generalship by attending, from childhood, only military institutions, and the highest priority of military education is moral training, thus serving as yet another protection mechanism.

To reinforce established practices and behaviors, giving them the respectability of the past, and to assign an identity to the army and specific units, the institution worships traditions, usually symbols, rites, and ceremonies. These include the cult of &quot;patrons&quot;, the order of precedence between branches, cadres, and services, the noble or honor halls, the galleries of former commanders, the &quot;historical denominations&quot; of military organizations, the army&#x27;s motto and the designation of the First Battle of Guararapes as the landmark of the force&#x27;s founding.

=== Patrons and dates ===
Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, the Duke of Caxias, is the &quot;maximum representation of authority, order and tradition for the Brazilian Army&quot;. On the centennial of his death, in 1980, Army Minister Walter Pires called him the &quot;personification of the army itself&quot; and a &quot;perfect model of a soldier&quot;. Caxias is designated &quot;patron of the army,&quot; and his birthday on 25 August is celebrated as &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Day.&quot; The &quot;cult&quot; of Caxias was made official in 1923 and promoted by military authorities as a symbol of a disciplined and loyal soldier. Until then, the main celebration was 24 May, the anniversary of the Battle of Tuyutí, and Caxias was less celebrated than Manuel Luís Osório.

At a level below Caxias, the branches, cadres and services have their own patrons, such as Antônio de Sampaio, patron of the infantry, Villagran Cabrita, patron of engineering, and Emílio Luís Mallet, patron of artillery. Sampaio&#x27;s birthday, for example, is &quot;Infantry Day&quot;. Some specialties and social circles, such as special forces, aviation, and the military family, also have designated patrons. All are historical figures used as examples of attitudes and virtues necessary for military activity. The cult of these figures was consolidated in the 1960s.

The only date with equivalent importance to Soldier&#x27;s Day is the Army&#x27;s Day on 19 April, the anniversary of the First Battle of Guararapes. This celebration evokes the belief that the army was born with the Brazilian nation, comprises the &quot;three races that form the essence of the Brazilian people,&quot; and defeated a more powerful foreign invader through guerrilla warfare and ambushes. The commemoration of Guararapes can also be associated with the defense of the Amazon and the &quot;resistance strategy&quot;.

=== Symbology ===

The Brazilian Army has visual symbols — coats of arms, flags, banners, and pennants — and musical ones — drumbeats, cornets and bugles, songs, shouts, and war choruses. In parades, its dominant musical genre is the , played by military bands and fanfare bands. There are hymns and songs of the army, branches, cadres and services, military organizations, and traditional songs. Likewise, specific troops have their own battlecries. The most traditional are &quot;&quot;Selva&quot;, from the jungle warriors, and &quot;Brasil acima de tudo&quot;&quot; (&quot;Brazil above everything&quot;), which originated among paratroopers and later disseminated. The army&#x27;s visual identity includes a coat of arms, a banner with the coat of arms and a symbol, the &quot;elliptical cockade&quot; with concentric national colors. It first appeared in uniform regulations in 1951 and has been applied to vehicles since the 1990s, replacing the Southern Cross inscribed in a circle that had been used since World War II.

Some military organizations carry banners, which are their &quot;war flags&quot;, and all have badges. Commanders, chiefs, and directors are identified by insignia flags. Branches, cadres, and services have their own heraldic symbols and colors. Organizations with banners have &quot;historical names&quot; referring to dates, places or characters related to the history of the organization or its predecessors, such as the &quot;5th Light Infantry Battalion – Itororó Regiment&quot;.

==Organization==
As part of the Brazilian Armed Forces, the Brazilian Army has its superior direction exercised by the Ministry of Defense and its Supreme Commander is the President of Brazil, who appoints an army commander suggested by the Minister of Defense. The army&#x27;s structure, complex and well-demarcated territorially, is centered on the Army Command, which has functional autonomy. The Army Headquarters is located in the Urban Military Sector, in Brasília, the capital of Brazil.

The Army Command has a General Management Body, the Army General Staff (; EME), four Superior Advisory Bodies, six Direct and Immediate Assistance Bodies, an Operational Management Body, the Land Operations Command (; COTER), and six Sector Management Bodies (; ODS).

The operational arm of the Army is the Land Force. COTER, created to relieve the EME of the executive aspects of operations, evaluates the operational capacity and instruction of the Land Force. The EME formulates military doctrine, strategic planning and general action guidelines. The Army High Command (; ACE), made up of army generals, is only a superior advisory body, but it was a general management body, coexisting with the EME, until 2006. The Brazilian War Materiel Industry (; Imbel) is linked to the Army Command.

Several ODS have technical links with Land Force units. The Department of Science and Technology (; DCT) is also linked to Imbel and has the Army Technological Center (; CTEx) in its structure, a research body responsible for projects such as the Saber Radar, ALAC and MSS-1.2.

=== Commands, divisions and regions ===
The Land Force is made up of eight Military Area Commands, each responsible for a portion of Brazil&#x27;s territory. When created, the territorial subdivision had a certain similarity to IBGE&#x27;s 1969 regionalization. Military Area Commands evolved from the four numbered armies and two area commands that existed until 1985. They encompass large operational commands, the Army Divisions (; DEs), and large administrative, logistical and territorial commands, the Military Regions (; RMs). Some RMs command combatant military organizations, but this is not the norm. DEs are brigade coordination commands and do not have a fixed constitution.

=== Brigades and units ===
According to the Brazilian Army&#x27;s doctrine, the brigade is the &quot;basic large unit (; GU) of combined arms&quot;, &quot;with the capacity to act independently and last in action&quot;. Its main components are infantry battalions and cavalry regiments, which are supported by command, field artillery, logistics, reconnaissance and security, anti-aircraft artillery, combat engineering, communications, and Army Police elements. Each type of brigade has a fixed formation, but the actual formation may differ from the doctrinal one, and several brigades are incomplete. A brigade&#x27;s strength can be less than 2,000 soldiers or more than 5,000.

The Armored Cavalry and Armored Infantry brigades are heavy brigades. Their composition is identical, with two tank regiments and two armored infantry battalions as its main components. The Mechanized Cavalry and Mechanized Infantry brigades are medium brigades; a Mechanized Cavalry Brigade has two regiments of mechanized cavalry and one of armored cavalry, while the Mechanized Infantry Brigade, with three battalions of mechanized infantry, can be compared to the United States Army&#x27;s Stryker Brigade Combat Team. The others (Motorized Infantry, Light Infantry, Parachute Infantry, Jungle Infantry and Pantanal Infantry) are light brigades, consisting of three infantry battalions of various types.

Brigades are subordinate to an Army Division or a Military Area Command. In an equivalent situation, there are Divisional Artillery, Engineering Groups and commands for specific use: Aviation, Special Operations, Anti-Air Defense, Artillery, Communications and Electronic Warfare and Cyber Defense.

Battalions (in infantry, engineering and communications), regiments (in cavalry), groups (in artillery), parks (in Ordnance) and depots (in the Quartermaster Service) are called &quot;units&quot;, consisting of a single branch and commanded by a colonel or lieutenant colonel. In combat branches, units have 500 to 900 soldiers. These include &quot;subunits&quot;: companies (in infantry, engineering or communications), squadrons (in cavalry), batteries (in artillery) and flights (in aviation). Some subunits are independent, with their own administration.

=== Geographic distribution ===
The distribution of troops across Brazil&#x27;s territory follows strategy and keeps remnants of past guidelines. The country is widely dotted with barracks, even on the most remote frontiers. Construction engineering battalions work on various road and rail routes. Throughout history, each reorganization and increase in personnel filled more spaces, as recommended by the &quot;Presence Strategy&quot;. This differs, for example, from the Chilean Army, which has become compact and mobile since the 1990s. Still, the Brazilian Army has strategic reaction forces in the &quot;central core&quot; of the country, between São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília, from where they can access any other region.

The greatest concentration of troops is in the Center-South, despite the priority given to the Amazon&#x27;s defense. The centers of political (Federal District) and economic power (São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) and some border states (Rio Grande do Sul, Paraná, Mato Grosso do Sul and Amazonas) have greater numbers of combat, logistics and administrative support units. Historically, the most politically important garrison was that of Rio de Janeiro, as the country&#x27;s capital was there until 1960; furthermore, the main military schools are in that state. The other historical area of troop concentration is in the South, targeting the border with Argentina, Brazil&#x27;s traditional rival on the continent. Rio de Janeiro lost several brigades from the 1990s onwards, while the Southern Military Command maintained its primacy. In 2011, it commanded 90% of the army&#x27;s armor, 100% of its self-propelled artillery, 75% of its engineering units and 75% of its mechanized cavalry.

=== Employment groups and Readiness Forces ===
The Land Force is divided into three &quot;employment groups&quot;: the General Employment Forces, which reinforce the others, the Immediate Employment Forces, which operate along the border, and the Strategic Employment Forces, which can move anywhere in the country and are &quot;forces with combat power that enable, in situations of crisis/armed conflict, strategic imbalance, through deterrent and offensive strategies&quot;. There are also support modules and Specialized Strategic Employment Forces. In the distribution of materiel and personnel, priority belongs to the Strategic Deployment Forces and some General Deployment ones.

The employment groups were defined in 2017 and replace older categorizations, such as the &quot;Strategic Action Forces&quot; and, before them, the &quot;Strategic Rapid Action Forces&quot; (; FAR Estrt), understood as the strategic reserve of the army, highly mobile and fully trained and manned. A number of companies and battalions were designated as regional FAR. The other forces, known as &quot;Operational Military Organizations&quot;, would have greater shortages of personnel and materiel, and would be mainly responsible for forming the reserve. Until the 1990s, the Parachute Infantry Brigade was the only strategic ready-deployment force.

The Strategic Employment Forces, Specialized Strategic Employment Forces, priority General Deployment Forces and support modules make up the Readiness Forces (; FORPRON), which maintain a rotation of professional personnel. FORPRON are made up of unit-sized forces provided by each of the brigades, with a total strength of 9,150 soldiers in 2023. The Brazilian Army plans to have, in total, a division made up of two brigades from the FORPRON. From the FORPRON, the army can select an expeditionary force or peacekeeping force to send abroad.

=== Specialized components ===

==== Special Operations ====

The army&#x27;s special operations involve &quot;highly specialized training of the combatant, the use of unconventional weapons and equipment, missions with high political sensitivity, the heterodox application of the principles of war, and the exploitation of limited opportunities&quot;, in irregular warfare missions, direct action, strategic reconnaissance, counterinsurgency warfare, counterterrorism, psychological operations, search and rescue, and humanitarian assistance. Forces with these missions are part of the Special Operations Command (; C Op Esp), based in Goiânia and subordinate to the Planalto Military Command, with preparation and employment links to COTER. The exception is the 3rd Special Forces Company (Force 3), in Manaus, which is subordinate to the Amazon Military Command, but linked to C Op Esp.

Its main units are the 1st Commando Actions Battalion (; BAC) and the 1st Special Forces Battalion (; 1st BFEsp); both are elite units and difficult to join. The training of 1st BFEsp personnel, also called &quot;FEs&quot; or &quot;ghosts&quot;, is comparable to the American Delta Force and includes long patrols in the Amazon jungle and urban crime fighting strategies.

==== By terrain ====
Present in all biomes of Brazil, the army has specialized troops for mountain, Pantanal, caatinga, jungle (which, in the army&#x27;s context refers to the Amazon), and urban environments. Specialization courses and internships in these environments are carried out in some battalions or in instruction centers.

Jungle training largely occurs in military organizations in the Amazon, but there is a specialized training center, the Jungle Warfare Instruction Center (; CIGS), in Manaus. With extreme physical and mental demands, it is highly competitive and internationally renowned. The Brazilian jungle infantry is characterized by survival in a hostile environment, decentralized fractions, river and air movements and flanking maneuvers. Brazilian army theorists recognize that the country would not resist an invasion of the Amazon by a superior military force through conventional means. Inspired by the Vietnam War and their experience in Araguaia, they propose guerrilla warfare to wear down the invader&#x27;s will, in the so-called &quot;Resistance Strategy&quot;.

These specialized forces comprise the six Jungle Infantry Brigades deployed in the Amazon: the 1st in Boa Vista, 2nd in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, 16th in Tefé, 17th in Porto Velho, 22nd in Macapá and 23rd in Marabá. Some of its Jungle Infantry Battalions (; BIS) are designated &quot;Frontier Commands&quot;, encompassing Special Border Companies and Platoons (; CEF, and ; PEF); although essential in surveillance, these platoons have very limited military power. Recruits at border posts are largely local indigenous people, but there are tensions with the local population.

Military mountaineering instruction takes place at the 4th Light Mountain Infantry Brigade, in Juiz de Fora, and does not include snow operations, as in mountain environments in other countries. Internships in Pantanal operations take place at the 17th Border Battalion, in Corumbá. Employing waterway and air transport, it continuously patrols the border and is subordinate to the 18th Pantanal Infantry Brigade. 

The Caatinga Operations Instruction Center (; CIOpC) is part of the 72nd Caatinga Infantry Battalion, in Petrolina, Pernambuco. Caatinga fighters are distinguished by their reinforced leather uniforms, to protect themselves from thorny vegetation. The Urban Operations Instruction Center is part of the 28th Mechanized Infantry Battalion, in Campinas.

==== By air transport ====
The Parachute Infantry Brigade and the 12th Light Infantry Brigade (Airmobile) are the two brigades listed by the IISS in the &quot;aerial maneuver&quot; category, that is, trained and equipped to reach the battlefield by transport aircraft and/or or helicopters. Outside the brigades there is another airmobile unit, the 1st Jungle Infantry Battalion, in Manaus. Mountain infantry, as it is also light infantry, may be airlifted.

The airmobile brigade specializes in helitransport operations (along with Army Aviation), but as it is light in equipment and weapons, it can also be transported in air force planes or civilian vehicles such as vans, buses, trucks, trains and ships. Its operational concept is focused on infiltration, extraction and airmobile assault behind enemy lines, employing Army Aviation helicopters. Subordinated to the 2nd Army Division, the brigade is headquartered in Caçapava, São Paulo, in the Rio-São Paulo axis region, where it is close to the Army Aviation Command. Army Aviation has two battalions in Taubaté, one in Campo Grande, one in Manaus and a detachment in Belém.

The parachute brigade, in turn, is focused on airborne assault, although it has never carried out a mass parachute jump outside of exercises and maneuvers. Its great usefulness lies in the immediate transport of its troops, and its recent employment situations tend to be in an urban environment. Its official mission is to &quot;move quickly [...] by airlift or airdrop&quot;, arriving within 48 hours at any point in Brazil. Paratroopers are considered an elite troop within the army and a &quot;showcase&quot; of the institution. 

The brigade receives many more volunteers than it has vacancies, it is more rigorous in selection and cultivates a &quot;paratrooper mystique&quot; and its own identity and values. Some traditions visually distinguish paratroopers, such as brown combat boots, red berets and silver wings chevrons. Headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, the brigade is subordinate to the Land Operations Command and the Eastern Military Command.

==== Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense ====
Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear defense (; DQBRN) is carried out by the 1st DBQRN Battalion (subordinated to the Eastern Military Command), the DQBRN Company (subordinated to the Special Operations Command), the School of Specialized Instruction and the DQBRN Institute of the Army&#x27;s Technological Center, in coordination with its counterparts in the Armed Forces, the National Nuclear Energy Commission and international organizations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. They can be used in response to accidents (their first real use was in the Goiânia accident in 1987), terrorist attacks and in a war environment, to recover forces attacked by such weapons of mass destruction. To this end, they perform the recognition, identification and decontamination of QBRN threats.

==== Army Police ====

The Army Police (; PE) is, in the generic sense, the military police of the Brazilian Army, and should not be confused with the state police forces (&quot;Polícias Militares&quot;). Its soldiers are identified by an armband with the letters &quot;PE&quot;. It is a specialized infantry troop available at each level of command: Military Area Commands have PE battalions, divisions have companies and brigades have platoons. The PE monitors troop discipline, prevents and investigates crime, provides security for authorities, guards prisoners and patrols facilities, among other duties. It is used both in conventional military operations and in combating crime. Current PE doctrine recognizes broad and hybrid action in &quot;humanized terrains (urban or rural)&quot;, in which there are &quot;actors acting in spaces that go beyond the battlefield&quot; and multiple dimensions — physical, human and informational — of the operational environment.

==== Guard infantry and cavalry ====
&quot;Military guard organizations&quot; belong to the infantry and cavalry and are dedicated to security and military ceremonies. In law and order operations, they can carry out search and arrest, overt patrolling and riot control, among other activities. The three guard cavalry regiments are the last ones still mounted on horseback in Brazil.

Two guard units alternate security at the ramp at Palácio do Planalto, Brazil&#x27;s presidential workplace: the Presidential Guard Battalion (; BGP) and the 1st Guard Cavalry Regiment, known as the &quot;Independence Dragoons&quot;. The BGP has guard and ceremonial duties for the president, foreign heads of state and the diplomatic corps. During demonstrations, it acts as riot police, armed with shields, batons, pepper spray and rubber bullets.

==Equipment==
=== Armored vehicles ===
In the Brazilian Army, forces centered on armored combat vehicles are classified as &quot;armored&quot; if their vehicles move on tracks and &quot;mechanized&quot; if they use wheels. The &quot;backbone&quot; of armored forces and cavalry is the Leopard 1A5 BR tank. In 2023, the army operated 220 units of this model, 41 of the Leopard 1A1 BE and 35 of the M60 A3 TTS, for a total of 296 main battle tanks (MBTs). They are complemented by 660 tracked armored personnel carriers (APCs) of various M-113 and M577A2 models, at least seven armored engineering vehicles, thirteen recovery vehicles, and five bridge launchers. Armored brigades have no infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs). Mechanized forces have around 575 Guarani and 46 EE-11 Urutu APCs , 408 EE-9 Cascavel armored reconnaissance vehicles and 32 Guaicurus light mobility vehicles. The IISS includes 13 Guaranis armed with 30 mm guns as the Brazilian Army&#x27;s only IFVs.

Quantitatively, the Brazilian Army has the largest fleet of MBTs in South America. However, only the Chilean Army has modern MBTs, according to the IISS classification. This condition of numerical advantage, in tanks and in armored vehicles in general, is the same as that observed in numbers from the 2000s and early 2010s. Qualitatively, the region&#x27;s armies, with the exception of Chile&#x27;s, operated armored vehicles designed in the 1960s and 1970s. The Leopard 1A5, for example, has technology from the 1980s, but was purchased by Brazil in the 2000s. The spread of anti-tank missiles in the armies of neighboring countries is already a threat to Brazilian armored forces. The Armored Forces Subprogram Implementation Guideline, in 2020, recognized that the majority of the armored vehicle fleet was already close to the end of its life cycle.

=== Artillery ===
The artillery branch is subdivided into groups and batteries of field artillery, missile and rocket artillery and anti-aircraft artillery. The IISS estimated a total of 1,881 pieces of field and missile and rocket artillery in 2023: 1,245 mortars (of which 1,168 are 81 mm caliber and the rest 120 mm), 431 towed artillery pieces (336 105 mm and 95 155 mm), 169 pieces of 155 mm self-propelled artillery and 36 missile and rocket launchers. However, there are smaller numbers of several models. The number was similar around 2009, representing a slight numerical preponderance on the continent.

In terms of technology, modern missile launchers coexist with howitzers manufactured in the 1950s, with an average range of ten to fifteen kilometers. The most sophisticated systems are in the missile and rocket artillery, with ASTROS II platforms organized into two Missile and Rocket Groups, totaling 78 launch, command post, communications, radars, workshops and meteorological vehicles. They are headquartered in Formosa, Goiás, and subordinate to the Army Artillery Command. This is the army&#x27;s strategic artillery, with the greatest ranges — up to 90 kilometers with cluster munition rockets or 300 kilometers with cruise missiles, although the latter were not yet in service in 2023.

Self-propelled field artillery units, which support the armored brigades, have several models of the 155mm M109 howitzer, supported by M992 A2 resupply vehicles. The rest of the field artillery uses 105 mm howitzers such as the M101 and M102, and M114 155 mm models. Paratroopers and light infantry are supported by Oto Melara M56 and L118 airborne howitzers, both 105 mm. The 120 mm M2 heavy rifled mortar is also important.

Anti-aircraft artillery forces have 34 Gepard armored vehicles, distributed among the armored brigades, and 9K338 Igla-S, RBS 70 and RBS NG portable surface-to-air missiles (MANPADS). All are of low altitude and range. The Brazilian Army does not have a medium-altitude anti-aircraft defense system.

=== Aviation ===

In 2022, Brazilian Army Aviation operated 95 helicopters of the HA-1 Esquilo, HM-1 Pantera, HM-2 Black Hawk, HM-3 Cougar and HM-4 Jaguar models. In the early 2000s, the Brazilian fleet was the second largest among South American armies. In line with most army aviation forces in the region, it focuses on transport helicopters and has no dedicated attack helicopters. The transport capacity of the aircraft based at the Taubaté Aviation Base in 2020, close to the 12th Light Infantry Brigade (Airmobile), is not enough to transport an entire infantry battalion in one wave.

<doc id="1047564" wikidata="Q1047298" url="?curid=1047564" title="Vlad I of Wallachia">
<text>Vlad I (? – 1396/97?) known as &quot;Uzurpatorul&quot; (the Usurper), was a ruler of Wallachia in what later became Romania. He usurped the throne from Mircea I of Wallachia. His rule lasted barely three years, from October/November 1394 to January 1397, while others suggest that the accurate ruling period was from May 1395 to December 1396.

== Early life ==
There are disagreements about Vlad I&#x27;s origins. He was either a nobleman or the son of Dan I and brother of Dan II. Other scholars have reservations about establishing any degree of kinship between Vlad I and Mircea the Elder due to the lack of supporting documents.

== Reign ==

Vlad I of Wallachia supposedly took the throne after the great Ottoman offensive in the fall of 1394, during the Battle of Rovine (dated by several Serbian chronicles to 10 October 1394). However, according to Serbian historian Radoslav Radojičić, Vlad I actually took the throne on 17 May 1395. This theory has been accepted by Romanian historians such as Anca Iancu. At the end of 1395, Sigismund of Luxembourg mentioned that Vlad I was sovereign of Wallachia, referring to his pro-Ottoman policy. In a document dated 28 May 1396 (Hurmuzaki, I / 2, pp. 374–375), Vlad Voievod gives special privileges to the Polish kingdom, confirming that he had contact with the Polish king.

Vlad I removed Wallachia from the anti-Ottoman coalition, leading to his official non-recognition by the Hungarian kingdom and its allies. However, the treaty with Poland made through the Moldovan prince Stephen I indicates that Vlad remained a powerful ruler in his country. This position is confirmed by the coins that were issued. Struggles to remove him from the throne and return Wallachia to the coalition continued throughout his reign, though when the expedition of Stephen of Lozoncs in May 1395 ended in a military disaster, the Hungarian king said that &quot;Walachia was lost and the Danube fell into the hand of the enemy&quot; (Victor Motogna, Foreign Policy of Mircea the Elder, Gherla, 1924, p. 42). 

In July 1395, a Hungarian expedition led by Sigismund, probably seconded by Mircea the Elder, captured the Turnu fortress and left a garrison loyal to the king. Throughout the following year the struggles to remove Vlad I continued. These were interrupted only by the participation of Sigismund and his vassals, including Mircea the Elder, in the campaign which resulted in defeat at the Nicopole. During this expedition, the territory of Wallachia was bypassed in order to avoid the Wallachian and Ottoman military forces stationed there. After the defeat, those who tried to find their way across the Danube were either ransomed or executed. This reaction from the Wallachian voivode can be attributed to the massacres by the Crusaders of Bulgarian Orthodox Christians in the conquered cities.

In October 1396, another military expedition headed by Stibor, the Transylvanian voivode, led to the defeat and capture of Vlad, who died in captivity. This allowed Mircea the Elder to regain the throne in January 1397.

== Controversy ==
In establishing the paternity of Vlad I, PP Panaitescu starts from an account by the Hungarian chronicler Johannes de Thurocz (1435 – 1488 or 1489), which speaks of a struggle between Dan, supported by the Turks, and Mircea, supported by King Sigismund. The chronicle mentions that both were of the same blood. Taking into account the theory of Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, according to which the struggle described was carried out between Dan I and Mircea in 1386, Panaitescu rejects the assumption of C. Litzica that a battle between Michael I and Dan II took place in 1420, and describes the account as a mistake by Thurocz, confusing Vlad with Dan, and not Mihail with Mircea. He explains that the source of Thurocz&#x27;s confusion was the fact that Vlad I was the son of Dan I.

Gh. Bratianu shares Panaitescu&#x27;s theory. Al. V. Diţă describes the episode from Thurócz&#x27;s chronicle as a &quot;nebulous narrative&quot;, &quot;an imaginary conflict reminiscent of the theme of &#x27;enemy brothers&#x27; in folklore&quot; and &quot;fantasy without a historical theme&quot;.

<doc id="1047567" wikidata="Q7247904" url="?curid=1047567" title="Profane use">
<text>Profane use is a term used in the Roman Catholic Church to refer to closed parish churches that will no longer be used as churches. This is often done in preparation to sell the former church building to another party. In this context, &quot;Profane&quot; does not refer to swearing, but rather to the older definition of those things that take place outside the temple.

With church buildings that are to be sold, first the sacred items (such as consecrated hosts) will be removed from the church. The Diocesan Bishop (or Archbishop) will issue a decree stating that the church building has been relegated to profane use. This has the effect of deconsecrating the church building. Once this decree has been made the building is no longer an official church building. The diocese will sell the building for any use as long as it is not .

<doc id="1047568" wikidata="Q3058669" url="?curid=1047568" title="Penjing">
<text>Penjing, also known as penzai, is the ancient Chinese art of depicting artistically formed trees, other plants, and landscapes in miniature.

Penjing generally fall into one of three categories:
* Shumu penjing (樹木盆景): Tree penjing that focuses on the depiction of one or more trees and optionally other plants in a container, with the composition&#x27;s dominant elements shaped by the creator through trimming, pruning, and wiring.
* Shanshui penjing (山水盆景): Landscape penjing that depicts a miniature landscape by carefully selecting and shaping rocks, which are usually placed in a container in contact with water. Small live plants are placed within the composition to complete the depiction.
* Shuihan penjing (水旱盆景): A water and land penjing style that effectively combines the first two, including miniature trees and optionally miniature figures and structures to portray a landscape in detail.

Chinese cultural hegemony gave the practice influence over other cultures, engendering &quot;bonsai&quot; and &quot;saikei&quot; in Japan, as well as the miniature living landscapes of &quot;hòn non bộ&quot; in Vietnam. Generally speaking, tree &quot;penjing&quot; specimens differ from &quot;bonsai&quot; by allowing a wider range of tree shapes (more &quot;natural-looking&quot;) and by planting them in bright-colored and creatively shaped pots. In contrast, &quot;bonsai&quot; are more simplified in shape (more &quot;minimal&quot; in appearance) with larger-in-proportion trunks and are planted in unobtrusive, low-sided containers with simple lines and muted colors.

While &quot;saikei&quot; depicts living landscapes in containers, like water and land &quot;penjing&quot;, it does not use miniatures to decorate the living landscape. &quot;Hòn non bộ&quot; focuses on depicting landscapes of islands and mountains, usually in contact with water and decorated with live trees and other plants. Like water and land &quot;penjing&quot;, &quot;hòn non bộ&quot; specimens can feature miniature figures, vehicles, and structures. Distinctions among these traditional forms have been blurred by some practitioners outside of Asia, as enthusiasts explore the potential of local plant and pot materials without strict adherence to traditional styling and display guidelines.

== History ==

Classical Chinese gardens often contain arrangements of miniature trees and rockeries known as penjing. These creations of carefully pruned trees and rocks are small-scale renditions of natural landscapes. They are often referred to as living sculptures or as three-dimensional poetry. Their artistic composition captures the spirit of nature and distinguishes them from ordinary potted plants.

=== Origin of the components ===
The container known as the &quot;pen&quot; originated in Neolithic China in the Yangshao culture as an earthenware shallow dish with a foot. It was later one of the vessels manufactured in bronze for use in court ceremonies and religious rituals during the Shang dynasty and Zhou dynasty.

When foreign trade introduced into China new herbal aromatics in the 2nd century BC, a unique incense burner was designed. The &quot;boshanlu&quot; stemmed cup was topped by a perforated lid in the shape of one of the sacred mountains/islands, such as Mount Penglai – focus of a strong contemporary belief – often with the images of mythical persons and beasts throughout the hillsides. Smaller versions of the &quot;pen&quot; dish were sometimes used as bottom pieces either to catch hot embers or to be filled with water to represent the ocean out of which the sacred mountains/islands arose. Originally made out of bronze, ceramic, or talc stone, some later versions were believed to be stones which occasionally were partly covered with moss and lichens to further heighten the miniature representation.

Since at least the 1st century AD, Daoist mysticism has included the recreating of magical sites in miniature to focus and increase the properties found in the full-size sites. The various schools of Buddhism introduced from India after the mid-2nd century included the meditative &quot;dhyana&quot; sect, whose translations of Sanskrit texts sometimes used Daoist terminology to convey non-physical concepts. Also, floral altar decorations were introduced and floral designs started to become a dominant force in Chinese art. Five centuries later the Chán school of Buddhism was established, in which renewed Indian &quot;dhyana&quot; Buddhist teachings were merged with native Chinese Daoism. Chán maintained its more active, vital spirit even as other Buddhist sects were becoming more rigidly formalized.

=== Earliest versions ===
While there were legends dating from at least the 3rd and 4th centuries of Daoist persons said to have had the power to shrink whole landscapes down to small vessel size, written descriptions of miniature landscapes are not known until Tang dynasty times. As the information at that point shows a somewhat developed craft, (then called &quot;punsai&quot;) the making of dwarfed tree landscapes had to have been taking place for a while, either in China or possibly based on a form brought in from outside. 

The earliest-known graphic dates from 706 and is found in a wall mural on a corridor leading to the tomb of Prince Zhang Huai at the Qianling Mausoleum site. Excavated in 1972, the frescoes show two maid servants carrying penjing with miniature rockeries and fruit trees.

The first highly prized trees are believed to have been collected in the wild and were full of twists, knots, and deformities. These were seen as sacred, of no practical profane value for timber or other ordinary purpose. These naturally dwarfed plants were held to be endowed with special concentrated energies due to age and origin away from human influence. The viewpoint of Chán Buddhism would continue to impact the creation of miniature landscapes. Smaller and younger plants which could be collected closer to civilization but still bore a resemblance to the rugged old treasures from the mountains would also have been chosen. Horticultural techniques to increase the appearance of age by emphasizing trunk, root, and branch size, texture, and shapes would eventually be employed with these specimens.

From Tang times onward, various poets and essayists praised dwarf potted landscapes. A decorative tree guild from around 1276 is known to have supplied dwarf specimens for use in Suzhou restaurants in the province of Jiangsu.

=== In Japan ===

Although imperial embassy personnel and Buddhist students from Japan had returned from the mainland with miniature landscape souvenirs since the 6th century, the oldest known depiction of a dwarfed tray landscape in Japan dates from 1309. The fifth of the twenty-scroll &quot;Kasuga-gongen-genki&quot; masterpiece depicts the household of a wealthy Japanese individual who has an outdoors slatted-workbench holding a shallow wooden tray and ceramic dish of Chinese origin with dwarf trees, grasses, and stones. By this time Chán Buddhism had been developed in Japan as Zen. Its influence of &quot;beauty in severe austerity&quot; led native Japanese dwarf potted landscapes to be distilled into single, ideal trees being representatives of the universe. What is termed bonsai derives from this.

=== Middle years ===

Since at least the 16th century, shops at the &quot;Garden of Dragon Flowers&quot; (Longhua) to the southwest of Shanghai, were engaged in cultivating miniature trees in containers. (These would continue to the present day.) Meanwhile, Suzhou was still considered at century&#x27;s end to be the source of the finest exponents of the art of penjing.

The earliest-known English observation of penjing in China/Macau dates from 1637.

During the end of the 18th century, Yangzhou in central Jiangsu province boasted landscape penjing that contained water and soil.

=== 19th century ===
In 1806, a very old dwarf tree from Canton (now Guangzhou) was gifted to Sir Joseph Banks and eventually presented to Queen Charlotte for Her Majesty&#x27;s inspection. This tree and most others seen by Westerners in southeast China probably originated at the celebrated Fa Ti gardens near Canton.

By the first half of the 19th century, according to various Western accounts, air layering was the primary propagation method for penjing, which were then generally between one and two feet in height after two to twenty years of work. Elms were the main specimens used, along with pines, junipers, cypresses, and bamboos; plums were the favored fruit trees, along with peaches and oranges. The branches could be bent and shaped using various forms of bamboo scaffolding, twisted lead strips, and iron or brass wire to hold them in place; they could also be cut, burnt, or grafted. The bark was sometimes lacerated at places or smeared with sugary substance to induce termites (&quot;white ants&quot;) to roughen it or even to eat the similarly sweetened heartwood. Rocks with moss or lichens were also a frequent feature of these compositions.

The earliest known photograph from China which included penjing was made c.1868 by John Thomson. He was particularly delighted by the collection in the garden of the Hoi Tong Monastery on Henan Island near Guangzhou. A collection of dwarf trees and plants from China was also exhibited that year in Brooklyn, New York. In America, laws such as the Chinese Exclusion Act led to Japanese bonsai becoming more familiar to Americans. This led to the prevalence of knowledge of the Japanese forms of dwarf potted trees for the next several decades and prior to Chinese forms.

Near the end of the 19th century, the Lingnan or Cantonese school of &quot;Clip and Grow&quot; styling was developed at a monastery in southeast China. Fast-growing tropical trees and shrubs could be more easily and quickly shaped using these techniques.

=== 20th-21st centuries ===
Established in 1954, the Longhua nursery in Shanghai included the teaching of classical theory and all aspects of the practice of penjing, a process which could take student-gardeners ten years.

As late as the early 1960s, it is reported that some 60 characteristic regional forms of penjing could be distinguished by the expert eye. A few of these forms dated back to at least the 16th century.

During the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution (May 1966-April 1969), one relatively small effect was that many collections of penjing in mainland China, especially around Beijing, were damaged or neglected because they were seen as a bourgeois pastime. After their trees were gone, some Chinese penjing masters, men in their sixties and seventies, were forced to do something considered socially redemptive—many were sent to fields to plant rice. However, in other areas of China, especially in eastern and southern China, penjing were collected for safe keeping.

Wu Yee-sun (1905–2005), third generation penjing master and grandson of a Lingnan school founder, held the first exhibition of artistic pot plants jointly with Mr. Liu Fei Yat in Hong Kong in 1968. This was a display of traditional aristocratic penjing which had survived the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution by leaving/being protected from Mainland China. The two editions of Wu&#x27;s Chinese/English book, &quot;Man Lung Garden Artistic Pot Plants&quot;, helped develop interest in this older form of what the West only knew as the later-refined Japanese art of bonsai.

The Yuk Sui Yuen Penzai Exhibition was held in Canton in 1978. This was the first public show in ten years with approximately 250 penjing from private collections displayed in a public park. Antique pots were also shown. The Shanghai Botanical Garden opened that year and permanently displays 3,000 penjing. The First National Penjing Show was held the following year in Beijing with over 1,100 exhibits from 13 provinces, towns, and autonomies.

One division of the Hangzhou Flower Nursery by 1981 specialized in penjing, including over fifteen hundred once abandoned older specimens being maintained and in the initial stages of being retrained. The art of penjing would again become vastly popular in China, in part due to stability returning to most people&#x27;s lives and the significantly improved economic conditions; growth would be most pronounced particularly in coastal provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong as well as Shanghai. There would be increasing numbers of good public and private collections, the latter with anywhere from several hundred to several thousand pieces.

By the end of 1981, the China Flower and Penjing Association was formed, and seven years later the China Penjing Artists Association was likewise established.

The Hong Kong Baptist University opened the Man Lung Garden in 2000 to promote the Chinese heritage of penjing. Temporarily located on the university&#x27;s Shaw Campus, in February 2005 a permanent site was set up at the Kam Shing Road Entrance of its Ho Sin Hang Campus.

==Aesthetics==

Using artificially dwarfed trees and shrubs, these arrangements are created in special trays or pots which are placed on ornately carved wooden stands. Often, rocks, miniature ceramic structures (like buildings and bridges), and figurines are added to give the proper scales as part of the natural scenery. These miniatures add to the symbolism of a penjing specimen, by providing a social or historical context in which to interpret the overall penjing design.

These miniature landscapes include trees which are frequently over a hundred years old. Like the plants in the Chinese garden, they have been carefully selected and tended so that they develop into twisted and gnarled shapes reminiscent of their full-size counterparts in the wild. Like Chinese gardens, these miniature landscapes are designed to convey landscapes experienced from various viewpoints - a close-up view, a medium-range view or a panorama.

As an art form, penjing is an extension of the garden, since it enables an artist to recreate parts of the natural landscape in miniature. Penjing is often used indoors as part of a garden&#x27;s overall design, since it reiterates the landscape features found outside. Penjing pots grace pavilions, private studies or living rooms, and public buildings. They are either free-standing elements within the gardens or are placed on furniture such as a table or bookshelf. Sometimes a lattice display stand is built which adds particular prominence to the penjing specimen and exemplifies the interplay between architecture and nature.

Penjing seeks to capture the essence and spirit of nature through contrasts. Philosophically, it is influenced by the principles of Taoism, specifically the concept of Yin and Yang: the idea of the universe as governed by two primal forces, opposing but complementary. Some of the contrasting concepts used in penjing include portrayal of &quot;dominance and subordination, emptiness (void) and substance, denseness and sparseness, highness and lowness, largeness and smallness, life and death, dynamics and statics, roughness and meticulousness, firmness and gentleness, lightness and darkness, straightness and curviness, verticality and horizontality, and lightness and heaviness.&quot;

Design inspiration is not limited to observation or representation of nature, but is also influenced by Chinese poetry, calligraphy, and other visual arts. Common penjing designs include evocation of dragons and the strokes of well-omened characters. At its highest level, the artistic value of penjing is on par with that of poetry, calligraphy, brush painting and garden art.

<doc id="1047569" wikidata="Q1047304" url="?curid=1047569" title="Michael I of Wallachia">
<text>Michael I (), (? – August 1420) was Voivode of Wallachia from 1415 to 1420. He was the only legitimate son of Mircea I of Wallachia, who made him his co-ruler. Styled as prince from 1415, Michael became sole ruler after his father died in early 1418. His support for a Hungarian campaign against the Ottoman Empire caused the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I, to invade Wallachia, forcing him to agree to pay tribute. After Michael failed to respect the treaty, the Ottomans gave assistance to his rival, Dan, who crossed into Wallachia in 1420. Dan and his Ottoman allies defeated the Wallachian army, and Michael was killed on the battlefield.

== Early life ==
The son of Mircea I of Wallachia and his wife, Maria Tolmay, Michael was Mircea&#x27;s only legitimate son. Alexander Aldea and Vlad were Michael&#x27;s most prominent illegitimate half-brothers, who, in accordance with local custom, could have claimed the throne of Wallachia. To strengthen Michael&#x27;s position, his father made him his co-ruler.

== Reign ==
Although Michael was first mentioned as Mircea&#x27;s co-ruler in 1391, it was only from 1415 that he was consistently styled as &quot;voivode and prince&quot;. Michael was still his father&#x27;s co-ruler when in 1417 he refused to send the tribute that Mircea had promised to pay to the Ottoman Empire. Michael became the sole ruler of Wallachia after his father died on 31January 1418.

The first year of his reign was peaceful because the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed I, was still occupied with the internal consolidation of the Ottoman Empire. Michael supported Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire in the autumn of 1419. They captured the city of Turnu Severin that Michael&#x27;s father had lost to the Ottomans, but it was put under Sigismund&#x27;s control. In retaliation, the sultan broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael to cede Giurgiu and other fortresses on the Danube to the Ottomans and to pay the tribute he had failed to send during the previous three years. Michael was also forced to send his two sons, Michael and Radu, as hostages to the Ottoman Empire.

Michael&#x27;s cousin, Dan, then laid claim to Wallachia. Many of Michael&#x27;s boyars (including the influential Albul and Utmeș) defected to the pretender. Dan crossed into Wallachia in early 1420. Initially, Michael was able to resist, but since he had failed to implement all provisions of his 1419 treaty with the Ottoman Empire, his cousin was able to obtain military assistance from the Ottomans. Michael received support from Hungary, but their united forces were routed in the summer of 1420. Michael was killed on the battlefield.

<text>The Yakovlev Yak-26, OKB designation Yak-123, was a Soviet tactical supersonic bomber aircraft flown at the Tushino air show on 24 June 1956. The model did not enter service.

==Design and development==
The Yak-123-1 prototype was developed from the subsonic Yak-25, and in parallel with the Yak-27 aircraft family, with the main goal of operating at supersonic speed. Although the Yak-123 kept the Yak-25&#x27;s layout, it had a more streamlined and longer fuselage with a glazed nose for a navigator-bombardier, replacing the Yak-25&#x27;s radome. The engines were upgraded to the much more powerful RD-9AK afterburning turbojets and the wings modified. The Nudelman N-37 cannon was replaced with two NR-23 23 mm guns. The next prototype, designated Yak-26-3, had a tail barbette with two more such guns, but it was removed altogether after testing. An internal weapons bay was added for of bombs, including the nuclear RDS-4 &quot;Tatyana&quot;. Additional bombs could be carried on underwing pylons. Engines were upgraded to RD-9F.

Although these designs showed potential for a supersonic bomber, they did not feature a radar, limiting their usefulness, and suffered from insufficient stability at high velocities, being prone to aileron reversals. This led to a refinement of the design, resulting in the preproduction-series Yak-26.

Although flown at the Tushino air show on 24 June 1956, only ten were produced, and the type did not enter service.

<text>The phrase man bites dog is a shortened version of an aphorism in journalism that describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences (such as a dog biting a man.)

The phenomenon is also described in the journalistic saying, &quot;You never read about a plane that did not crash.&quot; It can be expressed mathematically; a basic principle of information theory is that reports of unusual events provide more information than those for more routine outcomes.

==Origins==

The phrase was coined by Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe (1865–1922), a British newspaper magnate, but is also attributed to &quot;New York Sun&quot; editor John B. Bogart (1848–1921): &quot;When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often. But if a man bites a dog, that is news.&quot; The quote is also attributed to Charles Anderson Dana (1819–1897).

The result is that rarer events more often appear as news stories, while more common events appear less often, thus distorting the perceptions of news consumers of what constitutes normal rates of occurrence.

==Effect==

To some extent, a focus on unusual occurrences is unavoidable in journalism, as events that proceed as expected are simply not &quot;newsworthy&quot;.

The reasoning errors caused by this phenomenon are also associated with the availability heuristic, which is the mental shortcut that relies on the immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a specific topic. For example, because airplane crashes are frequently reported, they are easy to call to mind. This leads to people having inaccurate perceptions of how dangerous air travel is.

Some consider &quot;man bites dog&quot; stories about unusual events a sign of yellow journalism, and in the internet era, headlines about them may be phrased as click bait.

===Mathematical analysis===
A basic principle of the information theory, which studies the mathematical theory of communication, is that reports of unusual events provide more information than those for more routine outcomes. The amount of information conveyed by a message about an event can be expressed in terms of its &quot;surprisal&quot;, with surprisal formula_1 defined as formula_2 for an event of probability formula_3. Measured this way, an event that is nearly certain to happen (formula_3 very close to one) carries almost no information, while an extremely rare event (formula_3 very close to zero) provides a very large amount of information.

==Examples of literal use in journalism==
In 2000, the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; ran a story titled &quot;Man bites dog&quot; about a San Francisco man who bit his own dog.

Reuters ran a story, &quot;It&#x27;s News! Man Bites Dog&quot;, about a man biting a dog in December 2007.

A 2008 story of a boy biting a dog in Brazil had news outlets quoting the phrase.

In 2010, NBC Connecticut ran a story about a man who bit a police dog, prefacing it with, &quot;It&#x27;s often said, if a dog bites a man it&#x27;s not news, but if a man bites a dog, you&#x27;ve got a story. Well, here is that story.&quot;

In 2012 there were at least three instances: On May 14, the &quot;Medway Messenger&quot;, a British local newspaper, ran a front page story headlined &quot;MAN BITES DOG&quot; about a man who survived an attack from a Staffordshire bull terrier by biting the dog back. On September 27, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, a Canadian newspaper, ran the story headlined &quot;Nearly Naked Man Bites Dog&quot;, about a man that is alleged to have bitten a dog in Pembroke, Ontario. And on December 2, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported about a man that bit a dog, headlining it &#x27;Man bites Dog, goes to hospital&#x27;.

On May 5, 2013, &quot;Nine News&quot;, an Australian news outlet, ran a story headlined &quot;Man bites dog to save wife&quot; about a man who bit a Labrador on the nose, after it attacked his wife and bit off her nose.

There were at least five instances of the headline in 2014: On March 12, Rosbalt, a Russian news agency, reported that a man in Lipetsk had burnt a bed in his apartment, run around the city in his underwear, and, finally, &quot;bit a fighting breed dog&quot; following an hours-long online debate about the situation in Ukraine. In April, CNN reported a mother bit a pit bull attacking her daughter. On June 14, the &quot;South Wales Argus&quot; ran a front page teaser headlined &quot;Man Bites Dog&quot; about a man who has been accused of assaulting his partner and her pet dog. The Online version of this story was later amended to &quot;Man bites dog and escapes jail&quot;. On September 1, the &quot;Coventry Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran an article about a man who had bitten a dog after it attacked his pet. And on December 17, the &quot;Cambridge News&quot; ran an article with a headline starting: &quot;Man bites dog then dies&quot;.

On November 4, 2015, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; ran an article with the title &quot;Man bites dog. No, really.&quot;

In 2018 there were at least three instances: On January 25, &quot;The Hindu&quot; reported that a man bit a police dog in Houston, Texas, while trying to evade arrest. On April 10, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; ran such an article about a man biting a dog to defend his own dog. And on May 4, the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; ran an article about a man biting a police dog while being taken into custody.

On July 8, 2019, the &quot;Daily Camera&quot; ran an article about a man biting a dog in a supermarket.

On April 22, 2022, the Associated Press ran an article about a man who bit a police dog while officers tried to take him into custody. 

==Dog shoots man==
There have also been a number of &quot;dog shoots man&quot; news stories.

As an example of a related phrase, a story titled &quot;Deer Shoots Hunter&quot; appeared in a 1947 issue of the Pittsburgh Press, mentioning a hunter that was shot by his own gun due to a reflex kick by the deer he had killed. And in 2005, in Michigan, there was a case of &quot;cat shoots man&quot;.

==Man bites snake==
On April 12, 2009, Kenyan farm worker Ben Nyaumbe was attacked by a large python. During his struggle to escape from the snake&#x27;s coils, he bit its tail. He was rescued after it eventually relaxed its grasp enough for him to get to his mobile phone.

<text>(Manx for &quot;the gathering&quot;) is a cultural festival in the Isle of Man which celebrates Manx music, Manx language and culture, and links with other Celtic cultures.

==Origin and history==
The forerunner of &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; was founded in 1924, and was known as &quot;Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh&quot; (&quot;Manx national gathering&quot;). It was the idea of William Cubbon, the second Director of the Manx Museum, who was also the Honorary Treasurer of both &quot;Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh&quot; (The Manx Gaelic Society) and the World Manx Association (WMA).

Programmes from the early festivals state that &quot;&quot;Yn Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh&quot; is held under the auspices of The World Manx Association and The Manx [Gaelic] Society in commemoration of our great National Poet and with the object of preserving national sentiment.&quot; The &quot;great National Poet&quot; referred to is Thomas Edward Brown (1830–1897) whose poems, including lengthy verse-stories in Manx dialect (of English, though with some Gaelic words), were published by Macmillan.

The &quot;Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh&quot; was organised by William Cubbon through the WMA&#x27;s &quot;Ellan Vannin&quot; magazine, which he edited. The festival was a one-day, competitive event held at Hollantide (Allhallowtide), with participants from the island (though at least one of the judges, Dr J E Lyon, came from &quot;across&quot;, i.e. from outside the island). Members of the various sub-committees included Archibald Knox, J J Kneen and Mona Douglas. The event included singing (including in the Manx Gaelic language), music (including a grand concert as a finale), arts, crafts and cookery. The festival came to an end with the outbreak of the Second World War.

==Post-war revival==
It was the aim of one of the leading figures in Manx traditional cultural affairs, Mona Douglas, to revive &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; as a Manx national festival. A cultural revival starting in the late 1960s led to renewed vigour in the Manx language, in Manx traditional music, and particularly in Manx dancing. Mona recognised that &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; could provide a focus for cultural activities and a way to give greater recognition to Manx traditional culture, particularly in the wider context of an inter-Celtic festival.

In 1977, Mona Douglas organised &quot;Feailley Vanninagh Rhumsaa&quot; (the &quot;Ramsey Manx Festival&quot;) which was held on 1 September in collaboration with the &quot;Ellynyn ny Gael&quot; (Arts of the Gaels) organization. The programme&#x27;s front cover bore the modern symbol of &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot;. The programme announced that the festival &quot;will be revived in Ramsey August–September 1978, and this time it will be a five-day Inter-Celtic Festival&quot;. It was held on 21–25 August 1978. Mona Douglas&#x27;s programme note in 1979 states that &quot;It was decided to stage &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; in Ramsey, the only town in the Island which had no important festival of its own, and which, like Peel, was a recognized centre of the national revival.&quot;

==Inter-Celtic festival==
Whereas &quot;Cruinnaght Vanninagh Ashoonagh&quot; had been a festival only of Manx culture, Mona Douglas conceived &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; in its modern form as an inter-Celtic festival, giving an opportunity for the six Celtic nations of the Isle of Man, Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall to participate. Mona Douglas was particularly pleased to receive official recognition for &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; from &quot;Oireachtas na Gaeilge&quot; in Ireland, &quot;Gorsedd y Beirdd&quot; and &quot;Yr Eisteddfod Genedlaethol&quot; in Wales and &quot;Am Mòd&quot; in Scotland.

Events have been held throughout the island as part of &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot;, but the main focus from 1978 to 2006 was the town of Ramsey. The relationship of &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; with Ramsey has been an important factor over the years. The festival enjoyed venues and facilities throughout the town, including a variety of hotels and the Town Hall, various churches and even the livestock mart. As many of these venues and facilities ceased to be available, a marquee became a feature of the festival. However, with the usual plot in Ramsey for a marquee no longer available in 2007, &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; had to reconsider its siting. In 2007, the main focus moved to the Centenary Centre in Peel.

The development of traditional arts in the Isle of Man has continued apace since the late 1960s. Mona Douglas recognised that the energy associated with it could be harnessed to revive &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot;. Further development would undoubtedly have taken place in its own way. However, &quot;Yn Chruinnaght&quot; has provided a focus for thinking about and arranging traditional music, and has been the spur for new creative work drawing on traditional themes.

<text>The Turkmenistan national football team () represents Turkmenistan in men&#x27;s international football. It is controlled by the Football Federation of Turkmenistan, the governing body for football in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan&#x27;s home ground is the Kopetdag Stadium and their head coach is Mergen Orazow. The team represents FIFA and Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

==History==
After the country gained independence, they played their first match against Kazakhstan on 1 June 1992, and against fellow Central Asian nation Uzbekistan on 28 June the same year.

=== 2000s ===

They qualified for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup by winning the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification, where they were placed in group G, alongside the United Arab Emirates, Syria and Sri Lanka. In the autumn of 2003, in the first leg of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, they defeated Afghanistan 11–0 in Ashgabat. Begench Kuliyev and Rejepmyrat Agabaýew each scored a hat-trick, while Guvanchmuhammet Ovekov scored twice. Other players on the scoresheet that day were Nazar Bayramov, Omar Berdiyev and Didarklych Urazov. In the second leg the team won 0–2, with both goals scored by Begench Kuliyev. In December 2003, the national team of Turkmenistan reached the top 100 in the FIFA rankings for the first time in its history, reaching the 99th position, thanks to the successes in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup and the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. In the 2004 AFC Asian Cup that took place in China, Turkmenistan was placed in group C, with neighbours Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. They were knocked out in the group stages following two defeats and a draw against Saudi Arabia.

=== 2010s ===

In February 2010, Turkmenistan&#x27;s national football team was coach by Ýazguly Hojageldyýew, who was working for HTTU Aşgabat. Under his leadership the team went to Sri Lanka to participate in the 2010 AFC Challenge Cup. For the first time, they made it to the final, only to see them lose against North Korea in the penalty shootout. In the same year, the Football Association of Turkmenistan invited a native Turkmen, the head coach of FC Rubin Kazan, Kurban Berdyev to resume leadership.

In March 2011, Turkmenistan successfully entered the final round of the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup, beating Pakistan, Taiwan, and played in a draw with India in the qualifying competition in Kuala Lumpur. In the summer of 2011, in the race for a spot at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, they faced Indonesia in the second round. After managing a 1–1 draw in the first leg in Ashghabat, they were eventually defeated 4–3 in the second leg, 5–4 on aggregate, thus were knocked out of the contention for qualifying to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

In winter 2012 the team gathered for a training camp in Turkey. In preparation for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup, Ýazguly Hojageldyýew arranged a friendly match with Romania, which saw them lost 4–0.

In March 2012, the team went to Kathmandu to participate in the final tournament of the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup. They beat the hosts Nepal 3–0 and Maldives 3–1, while the final group stage match with Palestine ended in a goalless draw. In the semifinals, Turkmenistan defeated the Philippines 2–1. However, as in the previous edition, they lost the final match to North Korea with a scoreline of 1–2.

In October 2012, Turkmenistan&#x27;s were invited to the 2012 VFF Cup held in Ho Chi Minh City and finished as runners-up in the tournament, beating the teams of Vietnam and Laos, only to lose in the final match against the South Korean University Selection team 0–4.

On 23 March 2013 Turkmenistan defeated Cambodia 7–0 in Manila, in the qualifying round of the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup. In the second round, Turkmenistan was to meet Brunei, but the team did not arrive at the tournament, thus Turkmenistan was awarded a default 3–0 victory. In the last round, Turkmenistan lost to Philippines 1–0, but managed to qualify for the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup finals as the best second placed team alongside Laos.

In January 2014 Rahym Kurbanmämmedow was again in charge of the national team. They held three training camps in May and participated in the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup, where they were eliminated in the group stage, thereby losing the chance to qualify for the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. In June 2014, as a result of their poor performance at the AFC Challenge Cup, the entire coaching staff was dismissed, including the head coach.

In the spring of 2015, Amangylyç Koçumow was appointed as the new head coach of the national team to prepare the team for participation in 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. The team started off badly, losing to one of the weakest team in Asia – Guam national football team 0–1. On 16 June 2015, for the first time, the Turkmenistan national team held a match outside Ashgabat, at the Spot toplumy Stadium in Dashoguz in the presence of 10,000 spectators, the Turkmenistan team played a draw with Iran (1–1). Then, the team lost Oman 1:3. In the home games that took place at the Kopetdag Stadium in October 2016, Turkmenistan beat India 2–1 and Guam 1–0. In November, the Turkmenistan held a friendly match with the UAE, which ended in a 1–5 defeat and an official match with Iran, in which the team lost 1–3. On 17 November 2016, the national team of Turkmenistan in the home game sensationally beat the national team of Oman 2–1. In the final stage, the Turkmenistan national team defeated India 2–1. The Turkmenistan team took the 3rd place in Group D, which did not allow the team to go to the next stage of the qualifying games for the 2018 World Cup, but gave the opportunity to fight for getting into the 2019 AFC Asian Cup.

=== Back to the AFC Asian Cup ===
Turkmenistan had finally qualified to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup for the second time in history, having finished second after Bahrain. In the tournament, Turkmenistan was grouped with Japan, neighbor Uzbekistan and Oman. The Turkmen side played pretty well in their first match against Asian powerhouse Japan and even took a lead until the end of the first half, but eventually fell to Japan 2–3. The next match against Uzbekistan was a complete disaster when Turkmenistan decided to play duel with more experienced Uzbekistan, leaving the team defeated 0–4, all four goals were scored in the first half. Turkmenistan then tried to make a fight against Oman, but lost 1–3 with two Omani goals scored in final minutes, thus the team was eliminated without scoring any point. Coach Ýazguly Hojageldyýew resigned in the aftermath of the tournament.

In March 2019, the Football Federation of Turkmenistan named Croatian Ante Miše as the head coach of the Turkmenistan, signing a one-year contract. Another croatian specialist, Sandro Tomić will help to train the national team of Turkmenistan. Croatian coaches are set to develop the overall football in Turkmenistan, not just the national team. His first game, 3 month later, was a 0–0 draw at friendly match with Uganda.

In the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Turkmenistan was then grouped with host Malaysia, Bahrain and Bangladesh. They would go on to lose against Malaysia (1–3) and Bahrain (1–0), and despite winning against Bangladesh (1–2), Turkmenistan did not manage to qualify to the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. In 2023, Turkmenistan participated in the inaugural 2023 CAFA Nations Cup held in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.

In November, they lost to Uzbekistan 1–3 and drew 2–2 against Hong Kong during the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualification.

<doc id="1047595" wikidata="Q92792" url="?curid=1047595" title="Blake Ross">
<text>Blake Aaron Ross (born June 12, 1985) is an American software engineer who is best known for his work as the co-creator of the Mozilla Firefox web browser with Dave Hyatt. In 2005, he was nominated for &quot;Wired&quot; magazine&#x27;s top Rave Award, Renegade of the Year, opposite Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Jon Stewart. He was also a part of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2005 hot list. From 2007, he worked for Facebook as Director of Product until resigning in early 2013.

==Early life and education==
Born on June 12th, 1985 in Miami, Florida. He has an older brother and sister. Ross created his first website via America Online at the age of 10. By middle school, an interest in &quot;SimCity&quot; led him to piece together a couple of rudimentary videogames. He attended high school in Miami at Gulliver Preparatory School, graduating in 2003 while simultaneously working for Mozilla, based in California. Ross graduated from Stanford University in 2007. He is of Jewish descent.

==Mozilla and Firefox ==

Ross is most well known for co-founding the Mozilla Firefox project with Dave Hyatt. Ross discovered Netscape very soon after it open-sourced and began contributing, his mother&#x27;s frustrated user experience with Internet Explorer being the main driver. He worked as an intern at Netscape Communications Corporation at the age of 16. In 2003, he enrolled at Stanford University. While interning at Netscape, Ross became disenchanted with the browser he was working on and the direction given to it by America Online, which had recently purchased Netscape. Ross and Hyatt envisioned a smaller, easy-to-use browser that could have mass appeal, and Firefox was born from that idea. The open source project gained momentum and popularity, and in 2003 all of Mozilla&#x27;s resources were devoted to the Firefox and Thunderbird projects. Released in November 2004, when Ross was 19, Firefox quickly grabbed market share (primarily from Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Explorer), with 100 million downloads in less than a year.

Ross is the author of &quot;Firefox For Dummies&quot; (; published January 11, 2006).

==Career==
Ross founded a new startup with another ex-Netscape employee, Joe Hewitt (the creator of Firebug who was also largely responsible for Firefox&#x27;s interface and code). Ross and Hewitt worked on creating Parakey, a new user interface designed to bridge the gap between the desktop and the web. Ross revealed several technical details about the program and his new company when featured on the cover of &quot;IEEE Spectrum&quot; in November 2006.

On July 20, 2007, the BBC reported that Facebook had purchased Parakey.

In early 2013, Ross left Facebook to pursue other interests.

In 2015, Ross wrote a spec screenplay for HBO&#x27;s Silicon Valley. 

Ross took a job with Uber in August 2017.

== Personal life ==
Ross has aphantasia, a rare condition preventing him from visualizing things in his mind. In a blog post, Ross wrote:I have never visualized anything in my entire life. I can’t &quot;see&quot; my father&#x27;s face or a bouncing blue ball, my childhood bedroom or the run I went on ten minutes ago. I thought &quot;counting sheep&quot; was a metaphor. I’m 30 years old and I never knew a human could do any of this.

In 2015, he wrote a fan fiction original screenplay for the HBO television comedy series &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;, which gained attention.

<text>Davies is a crater on Mars located at 46°N 0°E on the fringe of Acidalia Planitia near Arabia Terra. It is approximately 48 km in diameter. The crater&#x27;s name was formally approved by the IAU in 2006.

It was named in honor of Merton Davies (1917–2001), a pioneer in the cartography of planetary bodies. An employee of the RAND Corporation, he assisted NASA in mapping Mars with colleagues Gérard de Vaucouleurs and Harold Masursky and defined the prime meridian of Mars as passing through the crater Airy-0. Davies Crater lies on the prime meridian, appropriate because Davies was responsible for its delineation.

<doc id="1047605" wikidata="Q2466486" url="?curid=1047605" title="Recursive definition">
<text>In mathematics and computer science, a recursive definition, or inductive definition, is used to define the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set (Aczel 1977:740ff). Some examples of recursively definable objects include factorials, natural numbers, Fibonacci numbers, and the Cantor ternary set.

A recursive definition of a function defines values of the function for some inputs in terms of the values of the same function for other (usually smaller) inputs. For example, the factorial function is defined by the rules
:formula_1

This definition is valid for each natural number , because the recursion eventually reaches the [[Base case (recursion)|base case]] of 0. The definition may also be thought of as giving a procedure for computing the value of the function , starting from and proceeding onwards with etc.

The recursion theorem states that such a definition indeed defines a function that is unique. The proof uses mathematical induction.

An inductive definition of a set describes the elements in a set in terms of other elements in the set. For example, one definition of the set of natural numbers is:
#1 is in 
#If an element &quot;n&quot; is in then is in 
# is the smallest set satisfying (1) and (2).

There are many sets that satisfy (1) and (2) – for example, the set satisfies the definition. However, condition (3) specifies the set of natural numbers by removing the sets with extraneous members. 

Properties of recursively defined functions and sets can often be proved by an induction principle that follows the recursive definition. For example, the definition of the natural numbers presented here directly implies the principle of mathematical induction for natural numbers: if a property holds of the natural number 0 (or 1), and the property holds of whenever it holds of , then the property holds of all natural numbers (Aczel 1977:742).

==Form of recursive definitions==
Most recursive definitions have two foundations: a base case (basis) and an inductive clause.

The difference between a circular definition and a recursive definition is that a recursive definition must always have &quot;base cases&quot;, cases that satisfy the definition &quot;without&quot; being defined in terms of the definition itself, and that all other instances in the inductive clauses must be &quot;smaller&quot; in some sense (i.e., &quot;closer&quot; to those base cases that terminate the recursion) — a rule also known as &quot;recur only with a simpler case&quot;.

In contrast, a circular definition may have no base case, and even may define the value of a function in terms of that value itself — rather than on other values of the function. Such a situation would lead to an infinite regress.

That recursive definitions are valid – meaning that a recursive definition identifies a unique function – is a theorem of set theory known as the recursion theorem, the proof of which is non-trivial. Where the domain of the function is the natural numbers, sufficient conditions for the definition to be valid are that the value of (i.e., base case) is given, and that for , an algorithm is given for determining in terms of , formula_2 (i.e., inductive clause).

More generally, recursive definitions of functions can be made whenever the domain is a well-ordered set, using the principle of transfinite recursion. The formal criteria for what constitutes a valid recursive definition are more complex for the general case. An outline of the general proof and the criteria can be found in James Munkres&#x27; &quot;Topology&quot;. However, a specific case (domain is restricted to the positive integers instead of any well-ordered set) of the general recursive definition will be given below.

=== Principle of recursive definition ===
Let be a set and let be an element of . If is a function which assigns to each function mapping a nonempty section of the positive integers into , an element of , then there exists a unique function formula_3 such that

: formula_4

==Examples of recursive definitions==

===Elementary functions===
Addition is defined recursively based on counting as
:formula_5
Multiplication is defined recursively as
:formula_6
Exponentiation is defined recursively as
:formula_7
Binomial coefficients can be defined recursively as
:formula_8

===Prime numbers===
The set of prime numbers can be defined as the unique set of positive integers satisfying
* 2 is a prime number,
* any other positive integer is a prime number if and only if it is not divisible by any prime number smaller than itself.
The primality of the integer 2 is the base case; checking the primality of any larger integer by this definition requires knowing the primality of every integer between 2 and , which is well defined by this definition. That last point can be proved by induction on , for which it is essential that the second clause says &quot;if and only if&quot;; if it had just said &quot;if&quot;, the primality of, for instance, the number 4 would not be clear, and the further application of the second clause would be impossible.

===Non-negative even numbers===
The even numbers can be defined as consisting of
* 0 is in the set of non-negative evens (basis clause),
* For any element in the set , is in (inductive clause),
* Nothing is in unless it is obtained from the basis and inductive clauses (extremal clause).

===Well formed formula===
The notion of a well-formed formula (wff) in propositional logic is defined recursively as the smallest set satisfying the three rules:

# is a wff if is a propositional variable.
# is a wff if is a wff.
# is a wff if and are wffs and • is one of the logical connectives ∨, ∧, →, or ↔.

The definition can be used to determine whether any particular string of symbols is a wff:

* is a wff, because the propositional variables and are wffs and is a logical connective.

* is a wff, because is a wff.

* is a wff, because and are wffs and is a logical connective.

==Recursive definitions as logic programs==

Logic programs can be understood as sets of recursive definitions. For example, the recursive definition of even number can be written as the logic program:
even(0).
even(s(s(X))) :- even(X).
Here :- represents &quot;if&quot;, and s(X) represents the successor of X, namely X+1, as in Peano arithmetic. 

The logic programming language Prolog uses backward reasoning to solve goals and answer queries. For example, given the query ?- even(s(s(0))) it produces the answer true. Given the query ?- even(s(0)) it produces the answer false.

The program can be used not only to check whether a query is true, but also to generate answers that are true. For example:
?- even(X).
X = 0
X = s(s(0))
X = s(s(s(s(0))))
X = s(s(s(s(s(s(0))))))


Logic programs significantly extend recursive definitions by including the use of negative conditions, implemented by negation as failure, as in the definition:
even(0).
even(s(X)) :- not(even(X)).

<doc id="1047608" wikidata="Q1059969" url="?curid=1047608" title="Dan II of Wallachia">
<text>Dan II cel Viteaz (? – 1 June 1432) was a voivode of the principality of Wallachia, ruling an extraordinary five times, and succeeded four times by Radu II Chelul, his rival for the throne. Of those five periods on the throne of Wallachia (1420–1421, 1421–1423, 1423–1424, 1426–1427, and 1427–1431), four were within a period of only seven years.

== Early life ==
Dan was the son of Dan I of Wallachia. His father was the eldest son and successor of Radu I of Wallachia. After Dan I was murdered in 1386, his brother, Mircea, ascended the throne. Dan was loyal to his uncle during Mircea&#x27;s reign. Mircea was the first ruler of Wallachia to be forced to pay an annual tribute to the Ottoman Empire. He made his only legitimate son, Michael I, his co-ruler.Dan appears first in the records leading a contingent sent by his uncle Mircea I to assist Musa Celebi in taking Adrianople during the Ottoman civil war in 1411.

After Michael succeeded Mircea (who died on 4 February 1418), Dan laid claim to Wallachia. The Ottomans defeated Michael in 1419, forcing him to pay tribute and to cede Giurgiu and other fortresses along the Danube to them. The Wallachian boyars started to defect to Dan. After Michael did not respect his treaty with the Ottomans, Dan broke into Wallachia in early 1420. Initially, Michael could resist. However, Ottoman troops joined Dan, enabling him to defeat Michael and his Hungarian allies in the summer of 1420.

== Reign ==
Dan II first took the throne in 1420, losing it in 1421, but regaining it that same year. He was primarily able to regain the throne many times because he was an able military commander in the field. In 1423, Dan II led an army against the invading Ottoman Turks, defeating them in battle. The Ottomans were invading in an effort to place Radu II back on the throne. In 1425, he again defeated the Ottomans, winning an important victory in a battle that was the first recorded mention of Wallachia using mercenaries in their army. In that battle, Dan II had employed a large number of Bulgarian soldiers. In the spring of 1427, Dan II removes Radu II from the throne for the last time, again defeating the Ottomans in battle, taking back the fortress at Giurgiu. In all likelihood, Dan II killed Radu II either during or after that battle, as the latter disappears from historical records afterwards. However, written accounts of the time are sparse at best, and it is not known for certain. On 3 June 1428, Dan II led an army against the Ottomans at Golubac Fortress, which ended with a treaty that would allow Dan II a semi-peaceful rule until 1432.

In 1432 his country was invaded by a large Ottoman army. Dan was defeated and killed in battle. He was succeeded by Alexandru I Aldea, a son of Mircea cel Batran, who would reign until his death from illness in 1436, and with him being replaced by Vlad II Dracul, father to Vlad Tepes. Dan II&#x27;s son, Basarab II, would replace Vlad Dracul&#x27;s son Mircea II in 1443. However, his son lacked the military ability of his father and would lose the throne within a year to Vlad Dracul.

Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra, an indefatigable traveler, possibly the most well-traveled prince of his time, and brother of Henry the Navigator, met with Dan II of Wallachia during Pedro&#x27;s service to Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor.

<doc id="1047609" wikidata="Q450706" url="?curid=1047609" title="D. C. Fontana">
<text>Dorothy Catherine Fontana (March 25, 1939 – December 2, 2019) was an American television script writer and story editor, best known for her work on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

After a short period working for Samuel A. Peeples as a secretary, Fontana moved to work for Del Reisman, a producer on &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;, whose creator was Gene Roddenberry. Though &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; was soon cancelled, Roddenberry began working on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and Fontana was appointed as the series&#x27; story editor, but left after the second season to pursue freelance work. She later worked with Roddenberry again on &quot;Genesis II&quot; and then as story editor and associate producer on &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. During the 1970s and early 1980s, she worked on a number of television shows including &quot;The Streets of San Francisco, Bonanza, The Six Million Dollar Man, Logan&#x27;s Run, The Waltons&quot;, and &quot;Dallas.&quot;

Roddenberry hired Fontana to work on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, but, while she was given an associate producer credit, the experience soured their relationship and resulted in a claim put to the Writers Guild of America. She later wrote an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and an episode of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan-made series &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;.

Fontana was inducted into the Museum of Pop Culture&#x27;s Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame. She was also awarded the Morgan Cox Award in 2002 by the Writers Guild of America, and was twice named to the American Screenwriters Association&#x27;s hall of fame.

== Early life ==
Born in Sussex, New Jersey, Fontana was raised in Totowa, New Jersey, graduating from Passaic Valley Regional High School in 1957.

Fontana decided at the age of 11 that she wanted to become a novelist. During her youth, she wrote horror stories featuring herself and her friends. She attended Fairleigh Dickinson University, where she graduated with an associate degree as an Executive Secretarial major. After she graduated from college, she went to New York City, where she got a job working at Screen Gems as the junior secretary to the president of the studio. Shortly after his death, she returned to her home state briefly then moved to Los Angeles. She gained employment in the typing pool at Revue Studios, working as the secretary to writer Samuel A. Peeples during his time on the Western television series &quot;Overland Trail&quot;.

When the series was canceled, Peeples and Fontana moved on to &quot;The Tall Man&quot;, and Fontana sold Peeples a story called &quot;A Bounty for Billy&quot;. She was 21; it was her first story sale. She continued to work with Peeples on the western television series &quot;Frontier Circus&quot;. During her work with Peeples, she sold six story ideas, including one on &quot;Shotgun Slade&quot; for Nat Holt. She was restricted in that particular episode, since the series only allowed for four main speaking roles including the main character. Another episode on which she worked had to be re-written to remove any outside scenes, as it was raining during the shoot, which could not be delayed for the weather to change. These were all created under the name of Dorothy C. Fontana. Peeples moved on from the company, but Fontana stayed and returned to the typing pool.

== Story editing ==

Fontana saw a position on a Marine Corps-based series called &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; and applied; Fontana began working as a secretary for producer Del Reisman. Around this time, she adopted the gender-blind pen name D.C. Fontana for her writing, to prevent her pitches being prejudged on the basis of her gender, as she was one of the few female writers at NBC at the time. &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; was created by Gene Roddenberry, whom she ended up working directly for after his secretary fell ill. After finding out she wanted to become a writer, Roddenberry encouraged her. In 1964, she published her first novel, a Western called &quot;Brazos River&quot;, with Harry Sanford. &quot;The Lieutenant&quot; ran for one season.

After the series was canceled, Roddenberry began work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and Fontana was introduced to science fiction, which had not been a previous interest of hers. Following encouragement from associate producer Robert H. Justman, and as she had been working on the show from the start of the development, Roddenberry assigned her the task of writing a teleplay on an idea he had for an episode called &quot;The Day Charlie Became God&quot;. She worked the premise into the script for &quot;Charlie X&quot;, although she gave Roddenberry the story credit and only took the teleplay credit for herself. It was broadcast as the second episode of the series. Although this was an adapted story, she also wrote &quot;Tomorrow Is Yesterday&quot; from her own idea. By the middle of the first season Steve Carabatsos, the story editor, had already left the production, and it appeared that the second editor, John D. F. Black, was also planning to leave, so Roddenberry gave Fontana the task of rewriting the episode &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. Both Roddenberry and the network were satisfied with Fontana&#x27;s work, and she became the new story editor instead of Roddenberry&#x27;s secretary in September 1966.

Fontana subsequently came up with the ideas for the episodes &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; and &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot;. There were other works that she was formally credited with based on the Writers Guild arbitration that were only re-writes of episodes. She later recalled completely re-writing &quot;The Ultimate Computer&quot;, as the original writer was unwilling to make the recommended changes. She said that this was a common issue: &quot;You either had to do a light polish, sometimes just on dialogue and then you took no credit for that of course, because it would not be fair, but when you really do a total script overhaul, then it has to automatically go into the Writers Guild for arbitration.&quot; She was one of four writers to re-write Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;The City on the Edge of Forever&quot;, alongside Roddenberry, Gene Coon and Carabatsos who had all made changes at different times to Ellison&#x27;s displeasure. Fontana&#x27;s draft, submitted on January 23, 1967, was superseded by three further versions by Roddenberry.

Fontana left the team prior to the third season, but continued to write scripts on a freelance basis. These included &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot;, &quot;That Which Survives&quot;, and &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;; the last two were credited under the pseudonym Michael Richards. She disliked some of the changes made in &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot;, such as the size of the cloaking device, and found working with her replacement difficult, as the new story editor, Arthur H. Singer, did not understand the basics of the series, such as what the transporter did. She had a further disagreement with producer Fred Freiberger as to how old Leonard McCoy was meant to be as &quot;The Way to Eden&quot; was developed.

Leonard Nimoy credited her for expanding Vulcan culture within &quot;Star Trek&quot;. He was unsure when &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; was proposed, as Fontana had changed the romantic lead from Hikaru Sulu to Spock but he enjoyed being able to act out emotions with the character, and also praised her work on &quot;Journey to Babel&quot; and &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot;. Nimoy also felt that unusually among &quot;Star Trek&quot; writers, Fontana was able to write believable female characters who were fully developed in the screenplay.

Fontana&#x27;s freelance status meant that she could write for several series, including Westerns once again. In 1969 she was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for an episode of &quot;Then Came Bronson&quot;, titled &quot;Two Percent of Nothing&quot;.

== Becoming a producer ==
During the early 1970s, Fontana acted as Roddenberry&#x27;s assistant on &quot;The Questor Tapes&quot;, but was not involved in the writing; she did however write the novelization. Fontana also wrote a script for Roddenberry&#x27;s projected &quot;Genesis II&quot; series. She was hired as story editor, associate producer and &quot;de facto&quot; showrunner on &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;. Roddenberry (credited for the first time on a &quot;Star Trek&quot; project as &quot;executive consultant&quot;) retained nominal creative control but relinquished most of his authority to Fontana while focusing on other television endeavors and lecture tours. Accordingly, one of her responsibilities on the show was to receive pitches for episodes, which she would then relay to Roddenberry. The series won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Series in 1975.

After that project ended, Fontana became the story editor on &quot;The Fantastic Journey&quot; (1977). Although it was soon canceled, working with Leonard Katzman led to Fontana writing for the &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; (1977–1978) television series. She also sold stories to several other science fiction series, including &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot;, and &quot;Automan&quot; (although the latter never became an episode due to the cancellation of the show). Fontana wrote scripts with her brother for &quot;The Waltons&quot; and under her own name again for &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;. One possibly apocryphal story involves Fontana&#x27;s experience writing for &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. She was reportedly so dissatisfied with revisions made to her script for &quot;Gun on Ice Planet Zero&quot; that she used a pseudonym; the story spread, resulting in other well-known science fiction writers refusing to work on the show.

When work on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; began, Roddenberry asked Fontana to join the team, and she offered to pitch some story ideas. After he suggested something involving an alien space station, she worked up the idea to become the pilot &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;. She was offered the position of story editor on the crew, but wanted to be an associate producer. Writer Robert Lewin found this difficult initially as, due to her being registered with the Writers Guild of America, he could not contractually ask her to do certain tasks. Since she had offered—and Roddenberry was expecting him to do it—he did anyway. She was eventually given her associate producer position.

Lewin said that this fight caused some resentment between Fontana and Roddenberry, and she left during the first season. She had written a story that would have brought Nimoy onto the show as Spock, but it was rejected by Roddenberry. When the actor and character later appeared in the fifth season episode &quot;Unification&quot;, she felt that her original take on &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was the right one. Her work on &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; was expanded by Roddenberry to add the character Q, as when she wrote her draft it was unclear whether it would be a single or double episode. She had her work on the episode &quot;The Naked Now&quot; credited to the pseudonym J Michael Bingham. Her relationship with Roddenberry became so strained prior to her departure that she began tape-recording their conversations. After she left, she put in a claim with the Writers Guild that she had also worked as a story editor on the series, but was never paid for it. This was settled amicably with Paramount Television.

== Later work ==
Pocket Books editor Dave Stern approached Fontana to write a &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel, and she proposed writing the story of Spock&#x27;s first mission on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, joining a crew led by Captain Christopher Pike. &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Glory&quot; also included Scotty&#x27;s first mission and an exploration of Number One. She described this as a pleasant experience, particularly working with Stern.

Fontana returned to the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, with &quot;Dax&quot;, an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. Peter Allan Fields brought Fontana onto the series after he had previously worked with her on &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. She found the episode difficult to write due to the characters not yet being fully explored since it was early in the first season. The nature of the character of Jadzia Dax&#x27;s opinion of her previous symbionts had not yet been settled and was only resolved when Fields re-wrote part of Fontana&#x27;s work. The duo were jointly credited with the screenplay.

Fontana wrote the episode &quot;The War Prayer&quot; for the first season of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, based on a premise by series creator J. Michael Straczynski. Only the pilot was available for research purposes, so she spent some time speaking with Straczynski to get a feel for the series. She went on to work on the episode &quot;Legacies&quot;, which was the only installment of the first season that was created by a freelancer, but not based on one of Straczynski&#x27;s ideas. He asked her to pitch and chose the idea for &quot;Legacies&quot; over a premise of his own. For her season-two episode &quot;A Distant Star&quot;, she wrote the script based on an idea by Straczynski. Straczynski was so impressed with her character Neroon from “Legacies” that he became a recurring role.

Together with Derek Chester, Fontana also wrote the scripts for Bethesda Softworks video games &quot;Star Trek: Legacy&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Tactical Assault&quot;. Todd Vaughn, Bethesda Softworks&#x27; VP of Development, described her as &quot;one of &quot;Star Trek&quot; most prolific and distinguished writers&quot;.

Fontana wrote the episode &quot;To Serve All My Days&quot; for the fan-made production &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot;.

Fontana&#x27;s work on &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot; in the third season of &quot;Star Trek&quot; led to IDW Publishing seeking to have her write a sequel in comic book form for &quot;Star Trek: Year Four&quot;, titled &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Experiment&quot;.

After joining the Writers Guild of America in 1960, Fontana served on the board between 1988 and 1990, and between 1991 and 1993. She was awarded the Morgan Cox Award for services to the guild in 2002. She was inducted into the American Screenwriters Association hall of fame twice, in 1997 and in 2002.

== Personal life ==
In 1981, Fontana married visual effects artist Dennis Skotak.

On December 2, 2019, Fontana died of cancer at a hospital in Burbank, California.

<doc id="1047619" wikidata="Q7154184" url="?curid=1047619" title="Paul W. Fairman">
<text>Paul Warren Fairman (1909–1977) was an editor and writer in a variety of genres under his own name and under pseudonyms. His detective story &quot;Late Rain&quot; was published in the February 1947 issue of &quot;Mammoth Detective&quot;. He published his story &quot;No Teeth for the Tiger&quot; in the February 1950 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Two years later, he was the founding editor of &quot;If&quot;, but only edited four issues. In 1955, he became the editor of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; and &quot;Fantastic&quot;. He held that dual position until 1958. His science fiction short stories &quot;Deadly City&quot; and &quot;The Cosmic Frame&quot; were made into motion pictures.

==Career==

Fairman left Ziff Davis, the magazines&#x27; publisher, when he was hired as managing editor of &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; in 1958 by its new publisher B. G. Davis, who had left ZD to found his own Davis Publications, and purchased &quot;EQMM&quot; from Mercury Press as his first major act; Fairman continued till 1963. when he left to focus on writing his own work, often under different names. He ghost-wrote several juveniles, such as &quot;The Runaway Robot&quot; (1965), based on outlines by Lester del Rey, whose name appeared on the books. He also wrote the Sherlock Holmes part of Ellery Queen&#x27;s &quot;A Study In Terror&quot; (1966), in which Ellery is anonymously sent a previously unknown manuscript written by John Watson, M.D.

==Movie and television adaptations==

His short story &quot;Deadly City&quot;, which appeared in the March 1953 issue of &quot;If&quot; magazine under the pseudonym Ivar Jorgensen, was made into the motion picture &quot;Target Earth&quot;. The story is about an alien invasion of Chicago and the evacuation of the city. The aliens had destroyed several Michigan towns, killing all the inhabitants, and had moved on to Illinois. The plot revolves around five characters who remain in the deserted city. They have to survive in a city devoid of people and facing annihilation by alien invaders.

His short story &quot;The Cosmic Frame&quot;, published in the May 1955 &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, was made into the 1957 science fiction movie &quot;Invasion of the Saucer Men&quot; and was remade, although uncredited, in 1965 as &quot;The Eye Creatures&quot;. The 1960 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;People Are Alike All Over&quot; was based upon his 1952 short story &quot;Brothers Beyond the Void&quot;. His short story &quot;Some Day They&#x27;ll Give Us Guns&quot; was filmed for the 1952 TV series &quot;The Unexpected&quot;, which was also known as &quot;Times Square Playhouse&quot;.

His short story &quot;Beast of the Void&quot; (currently available in Weird Science Fiction Tales: 101 Weird Scifi Stories Vol. 2, Civitas Library Classics) was published in 1956, and introduced the concept of amorphous intelligent matter in space capable of re-forming as perfect living copies of creatures from the memories of human explorers, including the protagonist&#x27;s lost wife. (A similar theme was greatly expanded by Stanislaw Lem for his 1961 novel &quot;Solaris&quot;, which was later filmed by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1972 and by Steven Soderbergh in 2002.)
